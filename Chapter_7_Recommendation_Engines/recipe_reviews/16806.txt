wonderful tangy change for a chicken dish. though I made a few subtle changes. first I used chicken breast cut into large strips, pre cooked them, didnt have plum jam, so used rasberry  instead, all other ingredients were the same, but upon reading other reviews, I added 1/2 a cup of water to the sauce mix put all into 9x13 dish sealed with foil then into the oven. after 45 mins then added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch mixed with a little water into the sauce. Family went crazy over this one, including fussy daughter, DH got pouty cause daughters BF cleaned up the leftovers.  Thanks Liza this ones a keeper.

This recipe is the bomb!  So easy yet, delish!  Used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of chicken pieces.  Adjust cooking time accordingly (30 - 40 mins).  Thanks, Liza for a great recipe!

First - I LOVE the fact that this has 4 ingrediants (that you ussually have around your house!!). Second - it is very good. I too used raspberry jam instead of plum (it was all I had) with very good results and used 5 whole chicken breast halves instead of peices.  My ONLY complaint: the onions in the soup mix are still hard even after the chicken is done (Not enough "liquid" to make them soft?) - so they were scraped off the chicken. Overall - very tasty and very easy.

I too used raspberry jam since it was all I had.  Definately adjust cooking time for boneless breasts, I didn't and not only were they fairly dry but most of the sauce had cooked away since there was no fat from the chicken.  But even so they were still good.  I can't wait to make them again to see how they are when cooked correctly.  Even my mom who hates barbeque sauce had some and liked it.  She said they taste more like teriyaki than barbeque.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!! It really needs more stars! It was simple!! My family literally "ate" this one up! I cooked frozen noodles in the chicken broth and homemade mashed potatos, it was awesome! Even my very picky 15 mos. old "snarffed" it up!! It's a keeper in this family. Next time I will try "playing" with different ingredents.

This dish was very yummy!  I used boneless chicken breast and strawberry jam as all I had in my house.  I cooked the chicken for 40 minutes in the oven and I also put 1/4 cup water in the mixture as others suggested.

I thought this dish was fantastic.  I used blueberry preserves instead of plum and made the sauce 2 hours prior to baking so the onions would be soft.  You could remove the skin as suggested but it may dry the meat out.  Try covering the dish.

very easy and very good.  i couldn't find any plum jam so i used grape jam instead and it tasted wonderful. next time i think i would remove the skin from the chicken (except the legs/wings) because the skin on the breast didn't seem to get crispy at all and i ended up pulling it off before eating it.  the remainder suace that was in the pan i put in to a gravy boat and it was wonderful poured over the chicken!

My family loved it, but me I couldn't eat it.  I followed the recipe but it was just too much barbeque sauce for my liking!  So I will give it a high rating cause I was out numbered...

An outstanding recipe! Everyone loved it when I served it at a recent family gathering. The old, the young, and the in between. This will surely become a family favorite.

This was inedible--it was super salty and just tasted strange with the onion mix. I even added some cream cheese to the sauce/juices to try and temper the salt and cut back the onion mix favor to salvage dinner. We love all the ingredients but the flavors didn't meld.

Very flavorful.  I doubled the sauce for a 5 lb bird, but still only used a single onion soup packet.  I soaked the soup mix in a cup of warm water prior to adding it to the sauce.  I also substituted plum jelly for apple jelly because it's what I had convenient in the house.  I used Full Circle Tangy BBQ sauce and it was marvelous.  I stuffed a half of sweet onion and a few cloves of garlic in the cavity.

The Chicken cooked nicely.  I wasn't as fond of the sauce. :( It wasn't great but it wasn't really horrible either.

This is an odd one to review.  It's better than it sounds AND it sounds better than it is.  :/  Really.  Reading it, it sounds interesting.  Making it, "what's the big deal?". No, it isn't bad; but it is sweetened barbecue sauce with onions - not too many if you're an major onionlover, but the onons are definately a BIG part of the taste - even with my having three times the sauce amount (including addtinal water).  Close your eyes & it smells like onions with barbecue seasons.  I made my own sauce (1c) & let the dry onion soup mix sit in a quarter cup water.  Only had 3T grape jelly.  I think if I make it again, I won't make it again.  :?  :D  I'll just sautee minced onion then add my homemade barbecue sauce ingredients.  Don't think the grape jelly did much, but I have heard of it as being key in chili recipes - so yes, I could be wrong.  :)
More for me, but here's the sauce recipe:  1c tomato sauce; 1/4c brown sugar; 1/4c apple cider vinegar; 1 1/2T worcestershire; 1/2t hot pepper sauce; 1/8t garlic powder; 1/32t cayenne.  Thickened with 1 1/2T cornstarch using 1/2c cold water.

just made this tonight and loved it.  I also used raspberry jam because I didn't have plum jam on hand, but I have added it to the grocery list for next time just to see.  As one of the other commenters had trouble with the onion staying hard, I added the soup mix to 1/2 cup water and let them soften while I put everything else together.  It was perfect.  We had brown rice with it.  So yummy!

Thanks Liza.  This is a keeper for the quick and easy.  I read all the reviews and found them very helpful.  Added 1/2 cup of water, soaked the dry onion soup and reduced the cooking time as the reviews suggested.  My wife loved it.

pretty good. It was a bit odd smelling when all the ingredients where mixed together.  Kept getting whiffs of the vinegar in the bbq sauce while it was cooking and was getting nervous that it would blow your sox off when done.  It was actually much milder tasting than it smelled!  Family liked  it.  Served it over rice.  It was a bit salty, but i'm not sure how you would fix that since bbq sauce and onion soup mix are the only salty ingredients!
overall, a good, quick easy recipe that i'll make again when i don't have much time for prep.

This was really yummy. I loved the sweet/savory thing it had going on with the BBQ sauce and jam. I did substitute orange marmalad since that's what I had in the fridge. I also browned the breasts in a skillet prior to baking, adding a little bit of chicken stock to deglaze the pan and mixed that in with the sauces. Based at 350 for 30 minutes and the chicken came out wonderfully juicy. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Will make again!

Nice chicken dish.  Can't say it's a wow but it is a keeper.   I needed a new recipe so i can feed a crowd very soon.  I did a test run on my family tonight and they liked it...so this is what I'll make for the group.    I tried it with thighs, legs and breast.  Used blackberry jelly that I had on hand since I couldn't find the plum jam at the market.    I did add about 1/4 c of water to thin it out a tad.  And I skinned some of the pieces, not all.  The onion soup mix gives it a little extra umph.  And about 40 minutes in I basted with the sauce it makes (keeps the onion bits from getting crispy).  Ate it with mashed taters, pork and beans and broccoli.     Super simple!!

This dish was so easy and very good!  Like other reviewers I used raspberry jam, 5 boneless chicken breasts, and added a little water.  I wish I had hydrated the onion soup, butthere's always next time.  They were cooked to perfection in 40 minutes. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was a hit!

Love this recipe!  Followed suggestions- used raspberry jam, and soaked the soup mix in half a cup of warm water for 20 minutes before adding it to the jam and BBQ mix.  I also made separate sauce on the stove top to top the long grain wild rice and the chicken.  Will definitely be making again and again!  Thanks!

I used Grape Jelly, mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, I cubed my chicken to coat it better in the sauce, but it was yummy. I never follow a recipe exact, but this one came out yummy!

Honestly I don't even try a recipe on this site unless it's over 4 stars but I needed a new chicken dish to feed my family.  I picked this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It actually turned out really good and I will keep it in my file.  The only thing I changed was used grape jelly instead of plum and used chicken breasts that I browned on the stove first.  Very easy dish to make.

WONDERFUL way to prepare chicken.  We loved the tangy flavor of the jam and bbq mixed together.  We had ours served over pasta, but this would also be good served over rice.  If you don't have plum jam, I think this recipe would work well with orange marmalade.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was good! The onion mix had a good taste with the sauce. I did like most and used rasberry jam instead of the plum (its what I had) and it was really good.

It was a hit. We both really liked it. Definite repeat. I used breasts and thighs only because I had to use them.
Quick and easy, then into the oven for an hour. Had it with mashed potatoes.
Use a good BBQ sauce.

It was a complete crowd pleaser! My kids gave it 2 thumbs up. My 12 year old daughter was watching mix the BBQ sauce & jelly then the onion soup and was disgusted.. but she LOVED it! I too had to swap grape jelly for the recommended plub, but it was still yummy! I did frozen chicken tenders and I also covered with foil for 30 minutes and then uncovered and finished cooking.

I used raspberry jam instead of plum.  I thought this recipe was OK.  It needed more of sauce.  If I makes this again I think I will double the barbecue sauce.

I used sugar free blackberry jam and 3/4 C chicken stock. I scored the chicken breasts as they were rather thick and let the marinade seep into the cuts. Let the chicken marinade for an hour or so before baking. I kept the foil on the top and just broiled for the last 5 min to crisp up the skin.

I really enjoyed this recipe I did add an extra 2 tbs of jam which was the 'mixed berry' type.  It was good and easy - my 3 kids under 9 did not like it however but they are sooo darn picky!  I still would recommend this.

Yummee! Doubled it because I had more chicken. Gave it four out of five stars because the kids said it was too sweet...they must be someone elses kids!The sauce was great on mash patatoes. I will take the skin off next time. It got kind of mushy.

Very disappointed with this one.  After reading reviews with the majority of them being positive, I thought this would turn out better.  It was very easy to prepare, but the taste was not good.  Basically, we thought it tasted like very salty bbq sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using grape instead of plum jelly.  I won't be making this again.

Everyone at my family reunion really enjoyed this chicken recipe. What was nice for me is that I baked the breast pieces well in advance of the party, and then reheated them with the sauce in restaurant-size chafing pans. People remarked that they just loved the sweet/tangy combination of flavors. Thanks for sharing, Liza.

This was really simple and fast to put together. I used boneless breasts and Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce and some homemade sand plum jam from my father in law. I didn't have the whole packet of onion soup, what I had was already opened with a little bit gone for another recipe. This had a nice flavor and was sort of barbecue but not really. Good enough to serve again. My husband suggested this would be even better served as nuggets and keep the sauce separate and use it for dipping instead. Thanks.

Made this for a crowd and served on top of Southwestern Rice by Michell D. from this site. Rave reviews it was such a hit!

I forgot the dry onion soup mixed and was afraid it wouldn't turn out. I added garlic salt & pepper to the sauce and, after pouring it over the chicken, I sprinkled finely diced onions over it so I could get the onion flavor. Despite the rave reviews I will use the dry onion soup mix next time!

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I will be making this again and i may do as other reviewers suggested and try Raspberry instead of Plum, though the Plum was great!

I loved it. i had used about 5lbs of chicken and double everything execpt the dry onion soup mix. I also set the onion mix in 1/2 cup of water to make the onion mix softer. Then before i poured the other mixture on the chicken i added them together. I loved it and plan on useing the recipe again.

I've been making a chicken dish like this for years.  I've used almost every jam but my favorite is raspberry.  I use skin-on chicken breasts, add a little chicken broth and make it in the slow cooker.  I serve it over couscous.  It's a keeper.

The onion soup mix should definitely be left to soak in to the sauce for a while, otherwise the onion pieces are hard and crunchy. Overall this dish has good flavor.

I appreciated that this dish came together super easily and with only 4 ingredients!  We did think, however, that the onion soup over powered the other flavors of the dish.  Maybe next time we'd use a combo of onion powder and garlic powder (perhaps with some other seasonings?) instead of the soup mix.

I made this recipe using slices of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I shortened cook time because of that and it came out great, good recipe.  I am going to try it on the grill next. I will be making it again.   Thanks!

Honestly...I HATE cooking chicken. Like handling it, seasoning it, waiting for it to cook, And this recipe kind of addressed all those concerns lol.  It was quick , super tasty, and I only made slight modificatinos.  Used fresh blueberry jam from Maine and skinless chicken breasts so I only cooked it for 45 minutes.  BY FAR the juiciest, tastiess, easiest BBQ baked chicken I've ever made.  Bought some chicken legs today that I'm going to use the same recipe on!

My kids loved this once I got them past the look of it.  I made it with boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot and used grape jelly.  I served it with fried rice, almost like orange chicken.  Excellent!

I had high hopes for this recipe from reading the reviews, but we were disappointed.  I was hoping that the jelly flavor would overcome some of the BBQ flavor, but the combination of ingredients just was not appealing.

This turned out pretty well with the modifications I had to make.  I used two cans of cooked, chopped chicken, blackberry jam, and 1/2 cup water and just stirred it all together.  I poured it into an 8x8 pan and baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes covered (then I uncovered it for a few more minutes).  I made rice and served this on top of the rice.  This is definitely an easy one to keep in the recipe file!

I just made this for dinner and it was AWESOME! My 4 year loved it and my 7 year loved it till she tasted an onion from the soup..lol, so next time I'll just use onion powder instead. Also I used strawberry jam bc that was all I had and I added a lil over 1/4 cup of water to the sauce like someone else on here had suggested and I used macaroni noodles to put under the chicken. I will def be making this again!! =)

Although I haven't tried this exact recipe (had to put in stars according to the rules) I do make something similar with catalina dressing and apricot jam (which we love).  What I want to know is who actually made THIS recipe.  Every review I read they used a different jam and used boneless breast instead of bone in pieces.  How can I get a proper sense of whether this recipe is any good??  Doodlemama

this was really good. May try leftovers served over   a spinach salad. I also used chicken breasts - cooked about 40 min. and covered. chicken was very moist - plenty of sauce - used raspberry because that's all I had.

This was delicious, everyone liked it. I did add about a half cup of hot water to the onion mix and let it sit for about 10 minutes before mixing the ingredients together. We served the "gravy" it made over rice, tasty!

I first made this recipe using chicken breasts, and I thought it was a good recipe especially since it was so simple.  Last night, I made this recipe using 1/2 inch pork chops in place of chicken.  The sauce was an excellent flavor for pork chops.  This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for me.  I seasoned the pork chops with a generous dash of salt and pepper and then browned them in the skillet.  I changed the recipe by doubling the ingredients for the sauce except for the onion soup.  I mixed the onion soup with 1/2 cup water and let it sit for about 20 minutes so that the onions would be plump and not dry.  I will be proud to use this recipe with company or just for our everyday meals.

I made this in slow cooker, placed onion soup mix on bottom of slow
cooker. Placed bonless chicken breasts on top of soup mix. Increased 
B-Bque sauce to 1 cup and used Strawberry Preserves increased to 6
Tbsp. mixed well and poured over the Chicken. Set on low for 8hrs.
When finished, I made a rue using 3tbsp of oleo and gradually added
2tbsp of flour. Removed chicken from slow cooker and slowly added
the rue to the ingrediants in the slow cooker and let simmer on low
for about 10min. Keep chicken warm during this time. Then serve the
chicken wth mashed potatoes and the gravy from the slow cooker!!!!!!

I have been making this chicken for years. I, however, match the color of jam/jelly to salad dressing. ie. Russion dressing with current jelly,  We eat alot of this in the summer served on rice or noodles with corn on the corn or a cold, crisp green  salad.
