this is really easy and perfect when you swap out blue cheese dressing for the ranch and Frank's Red Hot for Siracha. We like it a little milder so I used about 2/3 cup of Frank's and 1/3 cup of reserved broth.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added two things (smoked paprika and salt). I am going to make it again, however, there needs to be an adjustment for the amount of liquid because it was too soupy. I think after the chicken is taken out, I will either boil out some of the liquid or pour it into a cup and add if needed to get the right texture.

It was okay, I felt like the chicken needed to be doubled.

Great recipe! Thank you! because we really like spicy, I made a couple of additions. I tripled the garlic chili sauce and added garlic buffalo sauce to the mix. This recipe is fantastic!

i used my instant pot and covered the chicken with water instead of chicken broth. When done i retained .5 cup of water for the dip and drained the rest. Shredded the chicken, put aside while i heated the rest of the ingredients, added the water and chicken back in, waited for everything to melt/blend and left it no warm for serving.

Just okay. I added lime juice to give it some punch and did not use the liquid like the previous review did   I think adding some jalapeños or onion would do the recipe justice
