Super easy  and delicious! I wasn't sure I liked beets, after having avoided them for many years. We always ate them either canned or pickled when I was growing up. I used fresh steamed beets and skipped the sour cream for a refreshing summer salad.

This recipe was great. I used one cup of watermelon and used a bit of parsley (dropping the cilantro). The family loved it! 5 huge stars! Made it 3 times this week!  Mom, who has dementia, will eat things that are sweet. This was great as it requires no added sugar!

This is the most unusual combination and I'm pleased to say that it worked. I used fresh beets that I roasted until tender then peeled. I will double the watermelon next time. Very fresh tasting dish. Thanks mab575.

I loved it - strange combination. I'm not the hugest fan of cilantro, so I'll probably leave it out next time. The flavors all really worked together nicely. Will make it again!
