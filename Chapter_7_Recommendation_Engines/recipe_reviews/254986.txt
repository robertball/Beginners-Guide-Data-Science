I assembled the sliders in a different order but that is the only change I made. This is a great way to incorporate some freshness to the nugget for the kiddos.  Bacon really does make everything better  however it is impossible to keep the bits from falling out in this. My suggestion is to replace the bacon with half a slice of cheese and that way the kiddos are getting some dairy as well. Regardless, these are fun little sandwiches that kids will love.
