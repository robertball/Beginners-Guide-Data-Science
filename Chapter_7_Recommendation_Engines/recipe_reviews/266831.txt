This is a winner! It comes together quite easily and packs a punch of flavor! I used the store-bought matchstick carrots and edamame from the freezer section. The peanut sauce I used was Kikkoman Thai Style peanut sauce. Very tasty! I made some to take to an outdoor concert/picnic and everyone was asking for the recipe. I also added precooked shrimp for a protein boost. I bet it would be good with chicken too.  I'm definitely making this one again!
