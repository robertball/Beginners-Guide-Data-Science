This is a great simple pizza crust recipe.  I make mine in a mixer with a bread hook, but be careful not to over mix and the crust will be tough.  I didn't prebake mine any and it came out perfect.

So far this produced the thinnest crust pizza, which is what we were looking for. I used this recipe and made two pizzas with it. With the first pizza I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes on the middle rack (on a pizza stone) then added the toppings. It was thin but the middle of the pizza could have been crispier. With the second pizza, I prebaked it for ten minutes on the lowest rack in the oven, added the toppings and returned it to the lowest rack to finish. This made a BIG difference. This was incredibly easy to make. *****Update*****I've made this several times now and have gotten my technique down on how to get it nice and thin and CRISPY! :) I divide the dough in half and use one half per pizza. After spreading it on my stone, I bake it for 10 minutes on the lowest rack at 500 degrees. Then I lower the temp to 450, add the toppings and bake til the cheese is bubbly. When you bite into the crust you can actually hear it crunch! SO so so happy I tried this recipe :)

This is the best crust recipe i've found so far. It was pretty good, though it was a little too much like a biscuit.

This is a great, simple pizza crust recipe. I find I also get rave reviews if I use bread flour rather than all-purpose flour. It makes the crust even more Valentino's-like ;)

I have tried many of the pizza dough recipes on this site to get the "perfect pizza parlor" crust.  there have been several that were not too good and some that were great.  But in the end This pizza recipe by far is the best.  I made no changes to the actual ingredients.  I only added a tsp per cup of flour of King Arthur Pizza seasoning that a friend recommended to me.  But the crust was great with or without the seasoning.  (fabulous with the seasoning and I highly recommend it!).  I played around with the cooking temps and time and found 500 degrees bottome shelf for 5 minutes for pre cook and 450 for about 15-20 on the next shelf up with toppings. I am a happy girl...now I move onto toppings.  thanks to all of your responses.  This site helped me in my quest for a great homemade crust.

This was my first attempt at a homemade pizza crust and it turned out great!  I threw in about 1/4 cup of wheat bran to kick up the health factor a bit and also used a pizza stone to bake the crust on.  Before spreading the dough on the pizza stone, I spread a bit of corn meal on the stone, which baked into the dough and gave the crust an extra crunch.  I also baked the pizza for a full 20 minutes and the crust came out a beautiful golden brown color, but I think next time I'll bake for an additional 5 minutes or so, as I prefer an extra crispy crust.  All in all, this was a great recipe, and I'll definitely use it again!

Excellent pizza crust! I usually double the recipe and make a large 16 in pizza with it. It has quickly become a favorite around my place.

This was fantastic. I followed recipe exactly, and added dried thyme, basil and oregano to dough. I let it rise longer than suggested (got distracted) and pre-baked for 8 minutes before adding toppings, then baked for 15 minutes with toppings. It was thick, chewy and wonderful. Picky 16 yr old said the crust was the best part of the pizza! I especially liked that it didn't take hours before we could eat!

The 10-minute preparation is the eye catcher!  Pretty good results from a simple and fast recipe, although the dough is extremely sticky.  Don't try rolling it on the pan with your hands ... just 'pour' in on and use a wooden spoon to smooth it.  It's not the best crust you will taste, but for 10 minutes, I'll take it.

This is just a regular old pizza recipe that you can find anywhere.  How about using some real flour, like Durum, Semolina, or a high gluten flour.  Try experimenting with the flour and the liquid(v-8 makes an interesting dough) to find the one you like best.

I've made this crust about 6 times and registered just so I could review this. Very easy to make and turns out good but the taste of the dough is "doughy." I added more sugar,salt, pepper, oregano to the dough and it is now perfect. I don't have a stone so I just covered the bottom with polenta and cooks perfectly. Since i've started making this I haven't had pizza delivered!

An Absolutely wonderful crust! I finally bought a couple of pizza stones. (No need to prebake for 5 mins)I just sprinkle a little course cornmeal on the preheated stone and make the pizza.  (Original review: Before I had the pizza stones.)  Okay! I have a family of eight. This pizza dough was QUICK, EASY, and DELICIOUS. I followed the recipe exactly, anything I added to it was after I made the dough. (Next time I will add some spice to it when mixing and I'm pretty sure it will turn out great.) This dough takes on any flavor/spice well. I did a cheese stuffed crust pizza, two regular pizzas and a garlic crust pizza. Yummy! I did place my crust in a heated oven for 5 mins. I did the same thing with the stuffed crust also. I then finished making up the pizza and baked it for 15 mins. Everbody loves this pizza crust. (The dough will seem sticky after you mix it together. DO NOT add more flour. Just let it stand for 10 mins. Then just put a little olive oil on your fingers and work the dough into place on you pan.) This one is a keeper.

This was an excellent recipe, i used margarine instead of olive oil and honey for the sugar. i got a soft, slightly sweet(not too sweet) slightly chewy pizza crust,the entire thing dissapeared in minutes, even my son who is a very picky eater, ate two peices!oh and i must add, for those who have used this recipe, and gotten a biscuit like crust, try UNBLEACHED all purpose flour,it stretches better for a less starchy, and more chewy texture.

I have not had a lot of success with homemade pizza crust, but this one turned out perfect. The only thing I did differently was to let it rise once, knead it for a few minutes, then let it rise again before spreading onto a greased pan. I sprinkled it with cornmeal and pre-baked it for a few minutes before adding my toppings and baking.

Just the right amount of fluffiness and crispy crust! This was excellent! I meant to put some garlic powder on the crust and I forgot! However, it was still great! Made a veggie pizza out of this with broccli, red, yellow, and green pepper, mushrooms, and lowfat mozzerella. Pizza Hut eat your heart out! :)

This is an excellent crust.  I've made it three times in two days.  I mixed it in a mixing bowl with my Kitchen Aid and the flat beater.  I dumped it on a large pizza pan and pressed it as thin as possible.  I drizzled with olive oil, topped with cheese and then pepperoni and jalapenos.  I baked at 450 degrees until browned and it was really good.  The second one was pretty much the same.  For the third one, I mixed it up in the Kitchen Aid but let it rise for two hours.  I pressed it onto the large pizza pan as thin as possible making a really nice thick edge.  I drizzled with olive oil and added chesse and then pepperoni and italian seasoning.  I baked at 450 also and it was really, really good.  This crust is so easy - keep working with it until you can make it the way you like it.  It was extremely easy!  Have fun!

this is a great alternative to going out to pizza.  It only takes 10 minutes to rise, you throw the toppings on and bake!!  It would also be good for garlic bread.  Put a little butter and garlic salt and bake...Love it!

I have made this crust many times, but I always add 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. of pizza seasoning to my flour, so I don't know how it is without them, but I do know that every time I have made this crust, everyone has loved it. I have used all purpose flour, bread flour, and also whole wheat flour...all winners. I have made this crust also as deep dish pizza, and also makes a nice thin crust, in other words...very versatile. If this crust didn't turn out right, I'm sure you made a slight mistake, and that happens sometime, but try it again...carefully. Thanks Valentino for such lovely and quick crust. Oh yeah, I forgot...I have also used honey in place of the sugar when I used the whole wheat flour.

I love making this with my toddler!  She can help pat it out whereas rolling would be beyond her current skill level.  My family and I are also huge fans of thick crust, and this one is wonderful without being too dense!

Outstanding recipe.  For future cooks, read this: Let the dough rise for 30 minutes, covered with a towel, rather than letting it rest for just 10 minutes.  Then sprinkle 1/4 cup of extra flour on a surface and knead the dough for 5-7 minutes, or until dough has absorbed the flour.  This will help you roll it out better and it will rise beautifully in the oven.

WOW!!!  This is how I make my pizza crust.  Only thing I do differently is use 1 tsp of sugar.  I don't have a sweet tooth.   I also cut the dough in 1/2 to make 2 pizzas because hubby likes a thin crust.  I like both.  A keeper recipe no doubt!  I make mine on a pizza stone or sometimes on a air bake pizza pan (small holes in pan).

Great pizza crust recipe!  Not hard at all.  I have baked it BEFORE putting toppings on for a crispier crust, AFTER putting toppings on for a breadier crust, and also tried thin and thick crusts.  All work well!  Very verstile dough.  I always add a teaspoon of pizza spices (oregano, etc) into the dough.  I have also made cheese sticks out of this--just the dough, brushed with butter, and mozzarella on top.  Yummy!

This is going to be my go-to recipe for crust now!  I did add some fresh basil & thyme from my garden to the crust, and I brushed the edge with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt and grated Parmesan.  Yum!!

Love this recipe.  As written it's great. With 1/2 wheat flour it's great. With AP flour, great. With breadflour great. Stirred and 10 minute rest, great. Kneaded and risen, great. One a stone, great. One a cookie sheet, great. It is a very soft dough when followed as written, but it gets an A+ for speed and ease.  If I follow the directions, I like to bake it a little closer to the bottom rack to get a crispier crust if using a cookie sheet. My favorite goto pizza crust recipe.

Really good pizza crust. I followed recipe exactly and didn't feel the dough was too sticky to handle at all. I added garlic powder to the crust and divided the crust to make two thin crust pizzas. I don't have a pizza stone so I just used a regular cookie sheet, greased just a little with some shortening. I topped with canned pizza sauce, mozz and chedder cheese and some dried basil. The kids loved it and so did I. A nice quick meal and something you can do a lot with. On the second pizza, after I took it out of the oven, I took it off the cookie sheet and put it back in the oven for a few minutes to really crisp up the crust. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Good and easy basic crust. Could use a little more flavor...but that's just a matter of taste. Good start to experiment with.

I love it!  I love it!  I love it!  Wow!  Everything I want in a pizza crust.  Easy to make and really tasty.  I'm no where near being Italian so I'm not sure how "Italian" this is but it works for me.  Thank you.
P.S.  I did add Italian seasoning and some cheese to the dough.  Tasty.

This was great, baked my pizza at 450 for about 15 minutes immediately after letting it set for 10 minutes and it was great! I used whole wheat flour and I would definitely add half the sugar next time.

This is quick & easy, but did not work well without a pizza stone. It tasted fine, but was poofy-  weird texture... Not like pizza crust at all. If you prefer thin, crispy crust- you will be disappointed. But to be fair, I didn't use a pizza stone. I did like the instructions to have oil dipped fingers - very helpful!

Delicious and EASY. I spread the dough over a large cookie sheet that I had spayed with cooking spray, added salt and pepper on top and pre-baked for 10 minutes at 425*. Then I added fresh basil, tomato sauce, olives, artichoke hearts and capicollo ham, and mozzarella cheese and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Crust was perfectly cooked, thin and crispy, but still held up well with the toppings. This will be my go to pizza crust!

This is the easiest pizza crust recipe you will ever find.I made this as my first attempt to make homemade pizza and it was perfect. I attempted another recipe and failed so I am without a doubt sicking to his FOREVER! I have since made it 4 times and it is great every time. The only thing I do different is after it cooks in the pan I move it to a pizza screen and bake for about 5 min to give the bottom more of a crunch. Enjoy

I tried this recipe because it didn't need a lot of rise time.  We loved it.  It is a lot a dough though - made 2 pizzas with it.  I'll definitely keep the recipe, and will do a couple of large thin crusts next time.  The dough rose like crazy, so don't be scared to make it thin.

Not bad for quick & easy.  I found I needed to cut the recipe in half for my pizza stone in order to make a thin-crust pizza.  I also flavored the crust with a couple cloves of pressed garlic, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, some oregano, & some red pepper flakes.

Such a great pizza crust!  Whole family ate it and no one left the crust behind.  Husband said it tasted like a pizza from a pizzeria.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did let it rise for about an hour instead of only 10 minutes--I am not sure if that makes a big difference or not.  My mom and dad liked it so well, we planned a big family pizza making get together so everyone could try it.  If you are looking for a nice tender crust that is not too bready, chewy, tough, or crunchy, this is the one for you!

I did not like it.   The crust was not fluffy but thick and hard.  There is another recipe on this site that is much better.  For all that yeast used why did we not let the dough rise??  Just a nasty rusty crusty.

I had my doubts about this crust bc it seems like a recipe this quick for dough wouldn't be very good...wrong!! This is an awesome dough, perfect for a busy family! (I toped mine w sauce, ham, pineapple, caramelized onions, & cheese ...sooo good!! Can't wait to make it again :)

I had unexpected guests drop in over the weekend, so I needed a fast pizza crust recipe. Not only is the recipe fast and easy, it tastes amazing. It's a thick softer crust, which makes it versatile for bread sticks by adding garlic powder. I also added rosemary, thyme and fennel seed to my crust. It received rave reviews and no one was ever aware it was the first time I made it. All my guests requested the recipe. Amazing, will use again.

I was looking for a quick pizza crust, but I'll keep looking. This was super sticky, hard to handle, and it tasted like biscuits - hardened crust on the bottom (but didn't get crispy) and fluffy on top. Not good for pizza.

This crust was just ok.  It was very bland even after adding garlic and Italian spices.  Also, after baking it was kind of bready, I prefer a crispier crust.

Wow!!! We really loved this, talk about the EASIEST dough i have ever made, it is not in the instructions to kneed but i did a few minutes worth. My son said it was my best pizza i have ever made and he's my biggest critick! don't be turned away by how simple this seems, go for it, WONDERFUL! Note - the crust takes a bit longer than the rest of the pizza to be done, so maybe cook it 5 or so minutes first then use your toppings. I mixed Thyme and Oregano into my dough, thank you SO MUCH - this will be the only pizza dough i use from now on! Bon Appatite!

Amazing taste!!!  I used a pizza stone (with parchment paper underneath the pizza) and the crust actually came out pretty soft.  I was hoping it would have been a bit crispier, but since I'm new to making pizza crust at home, maybe it was just something I did wrong.

This crust is great, but I have to add just a few caveats:

1) I had to let the dough sit in a warm place for more like 30-45 minutes in order for it to rise.
2) I needed to bake the pizza for a bit longer than required in order for the crust to cook through completely.
3) It made enough for two pizza stone's worth of pizza.  However, I had vastly different results for each stone.  On my older pizza stone, which has been used for years, the crust did not stick at all.  However, on my much newer pizza stone, the crust stuck to the bottom and is impossible to get off, which kind of ruins the pizza.  I would definitely suggest dusting the pizza stones with flour or cooking spray before putting the dough on.  I'm wondering if the reason the crust didn't stick to the old one is because it has years of build-up (maybe similar to a much-used cast iron skillet?).  But who knows. 

Flavor is great, texture is great, and home-made crust is so much better than store-bought.

It was good! I added dried oregano and garlic salt. I rolled the dough out and sprayed my pizza pan with pam and stretched it out and thinned it as much as I could and baked it for a few minutes on 400 then flipped it and baked for a few more minutes till it started to get crispy. ThenI added my toppings. This helped it stay on the crunchy side. will make again everyone ate it up:)

I loved this crust! I added rosemary and oregano when mixing in the olive oil. After I flattened it on my pizza stone, I added basil on top. Then for the pizza: I spread some pizza sauce on it, topped with spinach leaves, some chopped up garlic, then mozzarella cheese, then cooked sausage, pineapple and tomatoes. I baked it for 20 minutes and it came out perfectly!

We like thin crust pizzas, so I divided the dough in half for two 12" pies.  It really cooked up fine, but it just didn't measure up to what we think of as really flavorful "pizza crust."  With all the wonderful reviews, I don't mean to be too critical, but I think it's just a matter of personal taste.  It was easy and good, but tasted more like a freshly baked dinner roll.  I'll continue my search for homemade crust, as this one didn't turn out to be exactly what we're looking for.

This was a great pizza crust recipe, but the amount really makes a thick-crust pizza, so half it to make thin.

Great recipe ~ I did make this a little differently by making the dough in the bread machine.  I also added a tablespoon of Italian herbs to the bread machine.  I thought the dough was a wonderful consistency to handle, not sticky at all.  I used a hot stone, sprinkled with corn meal.  I cooked the dough for 5 minutes before adding any toppings.  I did have to bake for a further 20 minutes.  I did enjoy this crust, but it was not as crispy as I usually like, the edge was perfect but the rest of the base a little doughy.  Still a good pizza though...

My kids and I all LOVED this recipe...fabulous flavor.  I had extra time, so the crust was able to rise longer and develop even more flavor.  I will use again and again and again!!!!!

AWESOME recipe! here's a couple additonal tricks & tips (my boyfriend used to work at Godfather's pizza and helped me make it!) : 1.) After spreading the dough on the baking pan into your desired shape/size, place the dough in your preheated oven for about 3-5 minutes. This will help the dough rise without actually cooking it (common trick of baking loaves of bread). Then take the dough out and you press it with your hands to make it larger/flatter/whatever you want. This is also a good time to shape the crust of the pizza because the forms you make will stay unlike when the dough is completely new on the pan. We added a lot of parmesan, garlic powder, and oregano to the dough. It was VERY good. The cheese makes the dough stickier when kneading it, you can put a little olive oil or butter (will make the crust nice and light brown) to help stop the stick. I will ALWAYS use this nice, EASY, delicious recipe. :] Thanks so much!

I let the yeast, sugar, and warm water sit for 10mins before adding anything else. Plus I kneaded the dough for 5mins, just to get the flour mixed in well. Always brush the entire pizza with garlic oil before spreading sauce and toppings. Very yummy... I did let it rise a bit in a warm oven before putting toppings though. (15mins)The crust turned out really soft and poofy after baking! I use a 9" pan for half the recipe, and it bakes perfectly in 18mins. Just had a few complaints about a yeasty smell/taste- probably b/c much more yeast is used in this recipe so the dough can rise faster.

My new FAVORITE pizza crust.  I always use Jay's Signature Pizza crust from this site but no more!!!  I baked the pizza on a large square cookie sheet and it covered the entire sheet.  Crispy on the edges, tender in the middle, YUMMY!  I added garlic salt and parmesean to the crust and it was great!  Try it, you won't be sorry!

I would not recomend this for under a 16 inch pie. It is very much like a biscuit with pizza toppings. The flavor is good and it is tender. But it seemed to want some sausage gravy more than pepperoni's.

!*!*!* WOW!*!*!* Great crust,tender and light.  We refrigerated the dough for about 4 hours,(the dough still did rise) this step resulted in a tender and chewy crust which was great.  With the left over dough I made bread sticks, toped with butter and garlic and cooked on the pizza stone.  I will never order pizza again!  Will only use this one!

I tried a few variations of different pizza dough, and this is by far the easiest to work with for me.  I started making homemade pizza so that I can shape the pizza to bake in my toaster oven.  My husband and I both love thin crust, and this recipe can make 3 portion of 10 inch by 10 inch thin crust pizza  (I have stretch it to make 4 portion of super thin crust).  I just put all the ingredients in my bread machine to let it knead for 10 minutes.  I don't own a pizza stone yet, but I find that pre-baking the crust first to a light golden brown at your highest temperature setting before adding your toppings really makes a difference.  I also let it rise in the fridge at least overnight.  It's not necessary, but I always have a hard time rolling out pizza dough.  If I let it sit for at least a day or two in the fridge (after I portion out the dough), I can just press the dough into whatever shape and it doesn't bounce back.  Excellent recipe!

valentino's pizza crust, is the first homemade pizza I have tried . I read dozens of the reviews and took something from most , here is all the reviewers helpful hints I used. I added 1/4 teaspoon of the following onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, oregano, basil, followed the rest of the recipe . I put olive oil on my hands so they did not stick to the dough"great idea". I do not own a cooking stone so, I put olive oil on a round tray and sprinkled it with corn meal  another -"great idea". I placed the pizza in the lowest level of the oven, for 7 minutes, on 450 degrees. I Then put the topping on and followed the recipe 425 for 15 minutes in the middle rake of the oven. The Pizza turned out perfect. I read some people felt it was like a biscuit , I think it makes the entire dough eatable, even the crust. I can not wait to make this over, and over changing it, as I go . :) thank you for another great recipe and help from the reviews.

This is my go-to pizza crust recipe.  I love it because you don't have to plan ahead to let the crust rise.  I just letit rest while I am getting the toppings together and grating the cheese.  I also use a small can of tomato paste mixed with a tablespoon of olive oil, and garlic powder and Italian seasoning to taste for my sauce.  The crust comes out just right.  It is not as chewy as the pizza restaurant, but it tastes great and is not left soggy in the middle.  We use this once a week at least.

This is an excellent recipe.  After trying countless recipes, this is the only one I make anymore.  I throw every ingredient in the bread maker and let it run on the dough setting, then half it and let it rest before forming it into a circle by hand.  I preheat my stone on the grill (to about 500 degrees) and grill the whole pizza (with lid closed) for about 5-6 minutes - depending on size and toppings.  It is an absolutely amazing crust: crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Fabulous.  Do yourself a favor and make this.

Real tasty except it always takes about 40min for mine to cook all the way through. I usually have a hard crust and an overly soft middle of my pizza. Not sure what I'm doing wrong?

Great crust.  Really easy to prepare and doesn't take a lot of time to rise.  A big hit at the pizza party I had the other day.

This was a good crust especially because of the ease and little time it required. It was very fluffy and soft, not a good choice for those who like a crispy crust.

Really great and easy! Will make again, only cutting the sugar down to about 1/2 of what it calls for. :0 thanks for sharing such an easy recipe that actually tastes good!

PERFECT crust! I lightly coated the ball of dough with cornmeal before I spread it into the pan. It gave it a good crunch.

This crust is nothing short of incredible!  My entire family absolutely loves it.  I do add some seasoning to the dough, though.  I add 1 T italian seasoning, 1/2 T garlic powder and about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan.  While mixing, I usually end up adding a couple of teaspoons of water to keep the dough together.

I absolutely loved this dough recipe.  Quick, easy and tasty.  I did pre-bake for 5 mins, dusted the pizza stone with corn meal and brushed the edges of the pizza with garlic butter before adding the sauce and toppings.  Yum-o!

This was easy to make and turned out pretty well.  I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and it turned out fine.  I also didn't pre-bake it.  I just rolled it out really thin and baked it for about 22 minutes.  It was pretty okay.  I'll make it again.

I love this pizza dough!!! I use it at least twice a week because I have a house full of boys that love pizza. This is easy to make and i also rub the crust with olive oil before baking. I bake the crust 5 minutes by itself and then take it out of the oven, add the toppings, and bake for 10 more minutes. I find that the crust is way crispier when I do it that way...Then when I get it out of the oven fully done, I make garlic butter and brush it on the outside crust and let it set for a minute or two....AMAZING!!!

This crust was very easy to make and turned out great. We grilled our pizzas and the crust turned out chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, just how we like it. I did have to add more flour while kneading as the dough was too sticky. I let it rise about an hour and it was great!

Nice base recipe and it will do, but I found it entirely too sticky for my taste.

Suggestions: Bump the flour up to 4 cups and add 1/2 cup cornmeal.

Came together really nice and easy. I added basil, oregano, garlic powder to the dough, and it still was a little bland. baked for 15 min in oven on cookie sheet (didn't have a pizza stone) then took off sheet and put it back in on the oven rack for about 8 min.

This pizza crust helped me out in a tight situation. I had made my mother in laws pizza crust recipe and it was suppose to make two pizzas. Suprise it didn't. Used this recipe and wow! This was really good. Didn't add anthing because I use the pizza sauce I or II. The one that requres no cooking. And we had a lot of other toppings. Fantastic. I will use this recipe always. The only thing I did was grease my pans with olive oil and dust them with corn meal. Nice crispy crust. I do not have pizza stones I use cookie sheets with the sides on them. I make two to three pizzas at a time. Did not prebake it either. Wonderful recipe!!! Thank you!

This is a really good pie crust.  It makes a thicker crust which really holds up to alot of toppings.  Sprinkled corn meal on the baking stone first then made as directed.  Made this with "exquisite pizza sauce" from this site (way too sweet).

The recipe was OK, though it was very easy.  The crust was very dense and chewy.  With so many other pizza crust recipes on this site, I will try another one.

Although this is truly yummy, it's also quite dry. My family called our pizza the "Pizza Cracker". I cooked it for 13 mins, and it burned!

I have never reviewed a recipe online, and I've found some incredible ones.  That should give you an idea of just how delicious this pizza dough is!!!  The only change I made was to add basil, oregano, and thyme to the dough.  Keep in mind that the dough will be very sticky after it's mixed, but it will be much easier to work with after it's risen.  Be patient, and DO NOT add more flour!!!  Also, the direction don't say this, but it's important... be sure to spray the pan with non-stick cooking spray before putting the pizza dough on it!

I liked the looks of this recipe because it sounded super easy to make.  However, even though I followed others' advice to add seasonings to the dough, I found it turned out too doughy.  In order to keep the crust crusty and not soggy, next time I will throw the crust in the oven first for a few minutes before adding the sauce and toppings.

This is an easy recipe and very good!  Everyone in my family loved it-a rarity for sure.  The crust was soft and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  I used generous amounts of olive oil on my fingers to spread the dough, as well as a thin layer on the pans.  I sprinkled thyme, oregano and garlic powder before spreading sauce on the dough.

I had to make this a few times before it became easy instead of work (as with any recipe.)  I also found that using oil on your hands rather than flour when pressing out the pizza dough makes a much nicer dough.  Delish!  And a family favorite.

I let this raise for 30 min to an hour and then cut in half.  Half covers a cookie sheet really thin perfectly.  I then prebake for 5 min and add topping and continue.  REALLY good thin crisp pizza.

This couldn't be any easier or any better!  Followed recipe exactly.  Let rise for a couple minutes as the oven was preheating.

Good pizza crust.  It makes a doughy crust and I actually like a crispy crust.  Probably won't make it again because of that, but it was simple to make and if you like thicker crusts, this is the one for you!

This was an Excellent Chewy, Fast and Easy pizza crust recipe!!  I only had infused sun-dried Tomato sunflower oil/Olive oil on hand, but it still turned out really nice cooked on my pizza stone.  It's a very sticky dough, because you don't have to knead it, so don't put it on a pizza paddle to get it ready.........this is what I did, and even with cornmeal underneath it stuck.  But I know not to do that next time:)  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Oh. My. Gosh.  AMAZING! This was so delicious! I could almost make it in long strips and have breadsticks. It was such a flavorful, crispy and fluffy crust. Awesomeness.   I also melted some butter, added parmesan cheese and garlic powder, then brushed that on the crust about five minutes before taking it out of the oven. Wonderful recipe.

This pizza crust was great! Wouldn't change a thing!  I was really impressed how easy it was to work with after only 10 minutes of resting in the bowl.  Not  needing to kneed it was great!  5 stars for simplicity and 5 stars for taste and of course the look was fabulous as well.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is a perfect recipe, I follow it to the letter. I love how foolproof it is and no kneading/rising time required. The ten minute rest time is usually just long enough for me to make the Alfredo or tomato sauce. I make in a rectangular pan with sides (like a small jellyroll) and don't prebake it. I do usually dust some kind of herb on the crust to complement my toppings. This is the start of every pizza I make, thanks so much for sharing :)

Quick and easy---ya can't ask for much more than that!  I used my KA stand mixer and it came together easily.  I was too lazy to dig out my pizza stone, but I will next time since I ended up scooting this directly onto my oven rack for the last 5 minutes to crisp up the bottom. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Added some seasoning (basil, oregano, garlic powder) and dusted the bottom of the crust with cornmeal.  The crust was well done on the bottom so it supported a lot of toppings well without being burnt to a crisp

This was ok. To me, the taste was kind of off and the pizza didn't seem to get done all the way in the center. I would recommend pre-baking thecrust for a few minutes before adding your toppings or better yet use rapid rise yeat in place of the regular kind.

Excellent quick dough. I made this last night and it turned out good. I added 1/2 t more of salt. And, 1 tsp Italian seasoning and 1/2 t crushed rosemary. Its a very soft dough and a bit *watery* when just mixed. I let rise for an hour then turned it into my oiled jelly roll pan. Turned out crisp on the bottom while really light when you bite into it. I just miss the yeasty flavor of dough that has rose twice. BAKE ON THE BOTTOM-MOST RACK for best results.

Made this as the recipe stated but had enough time to let it rise and develop more flavor.  This is a great pizza crust that will become my go to recipe.  I checked the oven about 5 minutes before it should have been cooked and wow.  The dough had risen so high that I thought I might lose the toppings.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

I love this crust. The second time I made it; I added a tablespoon of white corn syrup to the dough and rubbed the exposed crust with additional olive oil adding to the crispy texture.

Delicious, quick, & easy. This recipe is similar to the "Quick & Easy Pizza Crust" recipe on this website, but the texture and taste were a bit better. We'll be using this one from now on.

I baked this pizza on a stone and the end result reminded me of a thick stale cracker.  For the leftover pizza I heated it on the stovetop in a covered skillet on low and the crust browned nicely on the bottom and got crispy.  Who would've thought reheated pizza could ever be better then fresh out of the oven?

This is a very easy and quick recipe to put together - with ingredients I always have on hand.  So it definitely gets 4 stars for that.  However, I only have a 12" baking stone and I would highly recommend pre-baking the crust at least 10 minutes.  I had to bake my pizza for 45 minutes so the middle wasn't doughy.  The flavor is very good and I will continue to use but will pre-bake next time.

I mixed this up in my KitchenAid mixer and the dough had a perfect, barely sticky texture without any more flour. I sprinkled cornmeal on the pizza pan and pepper, garlic powder, oregano and rosemary on top. My dough rose like crazy once it went into the oven and was a good 1 inch thick, so roll it out thin if you don't like deep dish! We love deep dish though and my boyfriend said this was one of the best pizzas he's ever had. I agree, it had great texture and flavor! He even ate the crusts!

Mine was on the sticky side - I will add a little more flour next time.  If you like thin crust then this is probably not the recipe for you - I happen to like thick, chewy crust and was happy with this recipe.  It reminded me a little bit of DiGiornio's pizza.

Very good and easy recipe! I also added garlic and italian spice. I ended up having to add a little more flour as the dough was still very sticky. I baked it on a cookie sheet pan for 15 minutes at 425 without any toppings, and then added the toppings and baked for an addtional 10 minutes. It was awesome!

I previously rated this with only 4 stars because the first time I made it into only one pizza, and it was way too thick, but this has become a recipe I use several times a week and love! It makes two, not overly thin, thin-crust pizzas. It's easy, fast, and delicious. The trick is that you just have to really work it down to a thin crust, just like the way those pizza dough packets work. Do this by patting it with fingers, spinning it in the air, or rolling it with a rolling pin.

My family loves homemade pizza and after trying many crusts, this is now the only one I use. I love the convenience of not having to pre-cook the crust and it tastes great.  I substitute a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of the all-purpose and use honey instead of white sugar.

Awesome recipe. I needed a crust that was fast, and this filled the bill. I followed the recipe, and as suggested pre-baked for about 8 minutes, then topped with sauce, and toppings. My son loved it. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

Although I prefer the chewier crust my daughter made this since it was faster than the others. It was great and fast! My daughter said it was the perfect crust because it was lighter and softer than the other crusts.

This was the best pizza crust recipe ever!!!  I even messed it up and it still turned out great!  (I accidentally let is sit out too long on top of the preheated stove and it started cooking itself in the bowl!)  But it still turned out moist and tender.  This was easy to spread out too, it didin't tear easily like some other doughs I've tried.  The final product tasted great and I will definitely be making this again real soon!

This is an easy to make pizza crust that tastes great. I tried to make pizza crust one other time, a few months ago, and it did not turn out that well. The only thing I would do different, and it would depend on the pizza, would be to add some herbs and/or spices.

I have never made pizza crust before so I don't really have much other than take out crust to compare it to, however I am giving this recipe 5 stars because this was by far the quickest and easiest one I could find in a pinch. If you are looking for convenience this is the one for you! It did have a nice crust on the outside and was moist inside. Thanks for a great recipe.

Awesome pizza crust...after rolling it onto the pizza stone I like to brush it with EVOO and season it w/ garlic & pizza/italian seasonings & bake for a few min. before adding additional ingredients. Gives a little boost of flava

Great pizza crust. I let it rise too long, and it made for a really thick and light crust- more like bread.  Don't make my mistake!  When I did it right, tasted great!  Want to try it with calzones.

My favourite, easy, quick, basic pizza dough. I have  used this recipe for years now. I usually make it as written, but sometimes I have fun with the recipe. Some of the ingredients I've mixed into the dough include (in various combos): garlic powder, Italian seasoning, thyme, basil, grated or chunks of cheddar cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, bacon, etc. I've successfully used the dough to make mini deep-fried pizza pockets, pizza rolls, calzones, pizza bread, frozen mini pizzas. I've also baked it in the toaster oven, on the bbq on a pizza stone and as mentioned, deep-fried. It's always comes out perfectly awesome. And it can be ready in 30 minutes. That's faster than driving to the store for a frozen pizza!

This crust was perfect for our 'Reuben Pizza' from AR.  I did have to add quite a bit more flour as our humidity level was at 92% today.  I threw the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid and let it do the work.  Once the dough was made, I left for yoga class and when I got home, it had risen, a lot.  I just inflated the dough and continued on with the pizza.  It baked beautifully - a little crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Since I was making a Reuben pizza, I added caraway seeds to the crust and that added great flavor.  Yes, I would use this crust again.

I used honey instead of sugar, garlic salt in the place of salt and a bit of onion powder. I don't have a pizza stone so I just used a small baking sheet, brushed the dough with olive oil and baked for 17 minutes, but it needed just a little longer. Quick, easy, and tasty!

I tried this recipe a few days ago and it was really good.  I used corn meal on the stone and the crust wasn't crunchy but i had a 12" stone and i think if it was a little bigger it may have worked.  Like other reviewers i made two crusts with the recipe and i added italian seasoning, basil, garlic salt and onion powder to the crust as i mixed it.  My DH loved it and he's a very picky eater as well as my other guinea pigs.  :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dough is soft in the center and has a nice crunchy bottom. We baked ours on a pizza stone and ended up making one 12" pizza. Baking it on a pizza stone resulted to a smooth bottom that was a little different than its delivery counterpart, but not horrible. I would make this again. Quick and easy! And no kneading mess!

This recipe is amazing, I looked at a lot of other crust recipes, when I started wanting to make my own pizza dough & I'm glad I went with this 1! Have made it so many times I've memorized the recipe! This recipe makes plenty of crust, for cheap... I made 3 of these crusts for my family & it fed 10-12 of us! I usually just half the amount of dough I make (if there's some you don't use roll it out & put in the freezer), put it on a cookie sheet & it's good to go! 
**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS RECIPE IS TO PUT IT IN THE OVEN... THEN AFTER ABOUT 7-8 MINUTES TAKE IT OUT & ADD YOUR SAUCE & TOPPINGS! This is THE BEST WAY TO KEEP THE CRUST CRISPY!
One day I let the crust rise for extra time & didn't notice a difference at all in the taste of the pizza or the consistency of my dough. Hope this helps!

After years of trying to make a delicious pizza dough from scratch, I finally found the perfect recipe!!! This is just so perfect and tasty!!! A pizza stone is a must!!!!! The whole family devours it every time!!! Great on the grill too!! Make sure your pizza stone is HOT before placing the prepped pizza on it.

If you add cornmeal to the pan before spreading the dough, it bumps the recipe up to 5 stars for me.

As soon as I figure out how to separate it from the stone, I'll let you know how it tastes. This recipe creates a pizza that' becomes cemented to a baking stone. Going back to my old recipe. Pizza night FAIL on this recipe.

Of the various crusts I've made, this one is the best. One tip would be to bake longer. I had to bake this for 30minutes and the center was still not cooked. Next time I will try baking the crust for 5 minutes BEFORE putting toppings on. Then, I will still bake for 30 minutes.

Quick, easy and tasty!  Following the recommendation of someone else, I baked the crust alone for 10 minutes on the bottom rack at 500 degrees before topping and baking the pizza for another 15 on the middle rack.  Toppings I used:  pizza sauce mixed with pesto, diced garlic and parmesan cheese, onion, green pepper, orange pepper, yellow pepper, turkey bacon, olives, mushrooms, spinach, pineapple, cheese, tomato.  Yum!

I love this recipe for many reasons. My biggest ones though are it's easy and fast! I have made others and I do love them but I hate waiting for them to rise. This one is so easy and you are putting your pizza in the oven in 15 minutes. I did bake my pizza on a pizza stone and it came out fantastic. This is great recipe for a quick dinner or one of those days when you all of a sudden want pizza.

My Dad lived in Italy as a young man and he RAVED when I made this, saying it tasted like real Italian pizza. He begged me to teach my sister the recipe before I got married, actually! It's in solid rotation in my dinners now, and we love the thick crust. I add Italian seasoning to the dough, or BBQ seasoning for BBQ chicken pizzas, and sprinkle some seasoning over the other ingredients. I spread cornmeal on my pizza stone before putting on the dough to keep it from sticking.

This is my go to pizza recipe. I use about 1/3 white and 2/3 white wheat flour. One time I goofed and put the yeast in the flour instead of dissolving it in the water. Just kept going and it all turned out fine.

Perfect recipe for a quick pizza dough.  I did not have to make any adjustments, and it turned out great.

Goodbye Boboli pizza crust and hello Valentino!  This was so easy that I thought for sure I had done something wrong, but when it came out of the oven, it was perfect.  For the first time in my life, I didn't have to fight with a pizza dough.  Thanks so much!

Love this one!  I let my yeast proof with the sugar and water for about 10 minutes, then after mixing the flour and salt in, let it rise for about 30 minutes.  It was really good, light and fluffy and I have pizza made in a short amount of time.  My sons and husband loved it, I usually make Jays Signature Pizza Crust from this site, but it takes alot longer.  I will use this one from now on.

I add Italian seasoning to the crust before I mix it together and it gives it a nice flavor without adding a bunch of salt.  

I also recommend adding the salt to the flour instead of the yeast, since salt kills yeast.  It makes for a more traditional flavor and texture.

This is our favorite crust recipe!  We make it as is, then brush melted butter and sprinkle garlic around the edges of the rolled out crust before we load it.  We've also made garlic bread sticks with it by stiring in some garlic powder, then rolling it out and baking it for about 10 minutes, then coating it in melted butter minced garlic mixture.  Let it sit, then repeat a few times, then sprinkle with garlic powder and finish baking!!  Any way you fix this crust it's great!

I doubled the recipe to make two large pizzas and they turned out great!  The only thing I did different was to use bread flour because that is what I had.  I will definately throw away all of my other pizza crust recipes.

Excellent dough recipe for thin crust pizza!  It rolls out great.  Perfect taste and texture.  It rises just the right amount. I cooked it on an oiled pizza sheet and brushed oil on the crust.  Baked it for 15 minutes.  Mmmmm. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

As a qualifier, please note that I'm yeast recipe challenged - I simply cannot get dough recipes to turn out right no matter what I try. This recipe was so easy that even I made an unbelievably tasty, flaky pizza from scratch in under one hour. I followed all the steps exactly and used a Kitchenaid mixer dough attachment just until the dough was blended (not to over mix). I then spread this perfect amount of dough for 1 two person pizza onto a pizza pan (holes on bottom) and brushed it with olive oil seasoned with all sorts of Italian herbs and roasted garlic, etc. before adding toppings. Baked for 15 mins at 400 and it was phenomenal texture, taste and thickness (imagine medium thick with an end piece no one wants to waste). My picky husband loved it too. It could not have been more straightforward or tastier. Please try it!

I love this pizza crust! Although, and this could be considered a con - it is so easy to put together I probably have it too often, now!

I don't have a pizza stone, so I split the dough in two and use a half-sheet baking sheet for one of them, which is perfectly sized. I usually make it just for me, and put half in a covered bowl in the fridge, where it keeps fine for a couple of days.

I recommend adding some oregano, basil, and/or thyme to the dough itself, rather than sprinkling on top. I haven't tried a dessert variation yet, but it's been good with every savory topping I've tried so far. Highly recommended.

Bit of advice, though - don't make it too thick. I like 'deep dish' crusts, but this can be a bit too dense and chewy even for me if I don't shape it thinly. Trust me, even rolled thin, it is very good, and quite sturdy.

Great! Foolproof! And definately good on a pizza stone. Double the batch and have extra for Olive-Garden-like breadsticks. (brush with garlic butter and sprinkle on a little cornmeal and parsley.) Or roll then into pencils for crunchy breadsticks. We made a stuffed-crust by rolling string cheese in it around the edges.

Great pizza crust. Would have liked it a little more crispy on the bottom but didn't use cornmeal on the pan so need to try it again. 
I will be using this to make pizza from now on either way. You can't beat the simplicity of it.

We make homemade pizza every Friday night and have experimented with many different ways make crust, but this one is the winner!  The only changes I made to the way the recipe was written was I let the dough rise for about 30 minutes, and before I put the pizza in the oven I brushed the edges of the crust with a little butter and a tiny bit of salt.  This is my new go-to pizza crust recipe!

Good pizza dough. I like mine a little thinner so I used bread flour and kneaded it for about ten minutes then let it rest in refrigerator for 20 to 30 min. This seems to help make it more thin and crispy. Don't forget to proof before adding sauce and toppings. I also added a bit more salt, Italian seasoning and granulated garlic. It also helps to butter the outside crust ring before putting it into the oven. Hope you enjoy!!

Probably the best and easiest pizza dough recipe. I did let mine rise, just because I made it in advance. I also baked it for 10 minutes then topped it with the toppings and stuck it back in for the remaining time. My family loved it.

Great thick crust pizza!  If you love thick, pan style pizza dough then this is the recipe for you.  I doubled the recipe which made three large 12 inch pizzas which I baked at 450 degrees in a preheated oiled cast iron skillet.  This dough has great flavor and reminds me of Pizza Hut's dough.  I mixed this in my bread machine and did have to add about 1/2 cup extra flour.  I will use this recipe often thanks!

I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings, added garlic powder, basil and rosemary to the crust, let it rise for an hour, patted it out and topped it with sauce, cheese and portebello mushrooms, then baked for 15 minutes at 425. It was awesome!

This crust tastes great. It didn't quite get done in the middle when I cooked it at 425 for 17 mins (edges were beautiful). So the next time I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400 and it was perfect.

More like bread than pizza crust.  Fast and really easy but really heavy and not much flavor. I made one with all-purpose flour and one with whole wheat. Same outcome on both try's.  I will keep searching for a better recipe.

Where i live i cant get a pizza with crust like this. It is all thin crust. I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. I misread the directions the first time, but once i made the dough and topped with spicy taco meat taco sauce and Mexican blend cheese i was in heaven. Great Recipe.

I love Valentino's Pizza, especially their crust. I got what I bargained for; a pizza crust. There was nothing spectacular about it. One thing that I do recommend is to not use olive oil on your fingers to work with the dough; but if you like the taste of olive oil, then go for it. I will dust my fingers with flour next time, or dip them in water. Overall, it was a nice pizza crust!

I really enjoyed this crust.  I've struggled making pizza crusts in our German oven; but, this one worked really good.  It is very thick.  The flavor was wonderful.  Would work good as a dessert pizza also.

This crust is delicious and so easy. I usually use my mixer with a dough hook, but just mix it enough to combine everything. Over mixing creates a tougher crust. I also add in a tablespoon (or more!) of Italian Seasoning to add some flavor to the crust. And then before pre-baking the crust, I spread on a lightly cooked butter/garlic mixture. It makes my pizzas wonderful. Go easy on the garlic if your company isn't a huge fan. :) Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

PERFECT! Easy to use convenient crust! I did proof the yeast first though. Doesn't add much time on. This recipe made a 14 inch and 9 inch and they were pretty thick crusts on both. Only thing Id do different is add some seasoning to the crust:Italian seasoning,parm and or garlic powder. But we learn as we go!

I had a great time making this with my kids! It's so quick and easy. The taste and consistency is in between pizza crust and breadsticks, but we loved it anyway. We did end up brushing the edges with olive oil and garlic powder (I think it would have been too plain without it)

Soft  fluffy crust.  Flavorless, maybe because I forgot the salt.  Will definetly try again.  Maybe adding pizza seasonings next time.  Update: made again.  Still thought the crust tasted like flour.  It's to soft for my liking.

So delicious!! We made it for a pizza party last Saturday, and it was a huge hit. My husband hadn't had homemade pizza before, and now he's hooked. It's so quick and easy. The only thing we had to adjust was the flour, had to add a bit, but little by little got it to the right consistency. Cooks up nice and crispy and the flavor is very well balanced. Thanks for sharing!!

I would make two pizzas from this one recipe. It was too much dough for one pizza.  But that's just me I like a thinner crust; that's the only reason I gave this 4 stars. Good job Jody! It's real easy!

This was fantastic pizza crust!!  I have tried a lot of recipes, and this is the best. Nice, soft, chewy, tasty.  I did add some spices to the dough and used rapid rise (what I had on hand at the time), but I don't think that affected it much.  Trying it again with a tad bit of whole wheat flour in place of some white.  I found it to be QUITE sticky and a pain in the tush to work with, so will propably add 1/4c more flour so that it's more managable.

This turned out really well. I substituted a half cup of the all purpose flour for whole wheat and I added onion powder to the dough. Will definitely make again.

Way better than another pizza crust recipe I used on here!  I added dried oregano and dried basil to my crust as I mixed the dough.  Instead of 2.5 cups all purpose flour, I used 2.25 cups whole wheat flour.  This is now the new standard crust.  Thanks!

This makes a fantastic thin crust.  I've used another recipe for years, and this one is quicker, easier, and far better tasting!  I've made this recipe twice now and my family loves it.  I added a little dried oregano and garlic powder to add extra flavor to the crust.

Quick, easy, and good. Replaced the salt with garlic salt to add some flavor, and threw in some herbs. Just what we needed to keep being "snowed in" from being boring. :)

Great pizza crust - the family loved it! We like our crust thinner, so I actually used the recipe for one crust to make two pizzas. It was still soft in the middle and a little crispy on edges. Perfect!

Excellent!  Made my house smell so good!  I also, added seasonings to my crusts.  Generous on the olive oil made the crust taste wonderful. My whole family enjoyed this.  Way better than your Pizza Hut or Papa John's, etc.

This is a fabulous recipe! It turns out great every time. I used honey (the same amount) instead of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Making it a tad healthier means you can grab an extra piece!

Very good texture, but it was too yeasty and lacked flavor.  Also not a good choice if you want a crispier crust.  Not horrible, just not impressionable.

SO EASY!  It's truly a no-brainer recipe for those who have limited experience in making a homemade crust and tastes much better than anything you're going to buy in the store.  One thing I added was corn meal on my pizza stone that helped the crust spread out a bit easier and it added good texture when eating.

Excellent recipe! I've tried others and this by far is the best...added italian seasoning and garlic salt to the dough and pressed it into the dough to make it set.  Makes the dough taste great!  I did use the active dry yeast and only had to have my dough rise for about 20 min.  Then I did roll it out and add some more flour (bread flour) to get rid of the sticky-ness of the dough.  Thanks for posting this.

Soooo good!!!  My hubby and I looooved this crust.. will now become our standard!  We prefer thin crust and this recipe makes too much dough for just one pizza so I froze the other half of the dough to use next time... but it was  easy and delicious!

Bread flour at 550 degrees 8-10 min watch it close. Go to a pizza parlor and watch them make pizzas all day, then tell me if they ever had to pre-bake a crust. No! No! No! That's because they know how to make a dang pizza! Get your oven hot. All the way hot! Assemble it quickly and slam it in there. Look at the crust just like they do, and yank it out when it's just the way you want it!

The best pizza dough I've made thus far. Similar to Val's crust, but not quite the same.

This is THE best pizza crust recipe.  I substituted 1 tsp garlic salt for the salt and added 1/2 tsp dried basil to the dough mixture.  I plan to add 1/3 to 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to the next batch.

Great recipe!  I have been trying to make adjustments to get it just right.  I think I need to invest in a pizza stone.  The last time I made this I substituted garlic salt for the salt, added some Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese with the other ingredients.

I have made this at least 4 times now; it is the easiest pizza crust and doesn't have a ridiculous rising time! Certainly comparable to any canned pizza dough you would purchase, and tastier than most frozen pizzas, this crust offers ease and cost savings. Adding italian herbs and garlic gives it a nice flavor, and  be sure to oil your hands when pressing out as it is VERY sticky! I also find that using bread flour produces a nicer texture than AP.    GREAT!

This recipe is so easy!  I have made it atleast 10 times now.  I usually replace 3/4 of the flour for whole wheat and add herbs and garlic.  It is also really good without toppings as sort of a herb and garlic flat bread mmm

This crust is really easy and good. I was using one that required the bread maker but this is way easier and takes a lot less time. Didn't change a thing, just added a bit of garlic powder to some olive oil and brushed it on the crust after the pizza was done cooking. GREAT!! Will use this every time i make pizza from now on.

I LOVE this recipe! I used it while working abroad in Russia and it is one of the most forgiving recipes I have ever used. I had to guess nearly all the measurements and we had no idea what temperature the oven was set at, but it still produced a stellar crust every time. Highly recommended.

Pizza Stone a MUST!  I used this recipe and made two pizzas.  I made one on my pizza stone and the other on a round pizza pan.  The pizza stone was FAB!!!!  However, the pizza baked on the pizza pan was spongy and had the texture/flavor of a canned biscuit style dough...  I used the recipe exactly as written; sprinkles with herbs and olive oil - it was delicious.  Just BE SURE to use a baking stone!

I followed the directions but when we ate it, the edge was overcooked and very crispy like a thin crust pizza and the dough in the middle was pretty much raw. I think the rawness could have been prevented if I baked it on a lower rack in the oven but the outside would have probably been even crunchier.   Also, the dough was so wet that I couldn't handle it to roll out until I worked in more flour.

This was awesome!!! I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough to taste. We made Easy Pizza Sauce I from AR. We made 3 pizzas. 2 small and 1 big. With both of mine I put a light layer of EVOO on my pan before baking. DH put non-stick spray and flour. My pizzas crisped up perfect, almost  like our favorite Dallas pizzeria where a small is $12. His was soft (but done) on the bottom but not crispy like we prefer. I am so excited we found a dough we really enjoy.

This is good if you like cake-like pizza dough, like Pizzeria Uno's. So my husband liked it a lot. I prefer a chewy crust more like the Philly/Jersey pizza I grew up on.

Quick and easy pizza crust! Tastes great and has a good texture, too. I add Italian seasonings and garlic powder to the dry ingredients most of the time, and occasionally coat the crust with garlic butter.

I searched quite a bit for what I wanted - something along the lines of Anthony's Pizza crust and settled on this one.  I had time to let it rise (about 30 minutes) and maybe that made a difference.  It was the nice, thinner type crust I was looking for - my kitchen smelled like an upscale pizzeria.  I made no changes for high altitude either.  Thanks for this one - we'll be using it quite a bit.

Followed the crust to a T --was a very good thin crust pizza.  Next time I will add some spices to the crust---a nice change from the thick crusts I normally make...thank you for sharing!

I have now used this recipe for over a year and no one has a better pizza crust than Valentino's!!!

A year ago, I said:
I have used this pizza crust 5 times now. I finally got to put it in a real pizza oven next door and the crust puffed up bigger than ever and made a perfect fire baked pizza!

Excellent!  This was very easy to work with, used half white flour and half nutri blend (ran out of whole wheat!).  I did throw some seasoning into my dough as I mixed it.  Added our toppings and baked on our pizza stone (as always) and the result was a nice and tender, soft crust...not too heavy or dense as some can be!  Such a drastic difference when you make your own fresh dough!

Best crust recipe on here.  I did, however, let it double rise and rest before cooking.  I also par baked for 2 minutes @500 then topped and cooked at LOWEST rack in oven.  Delicious.

This is a very good easy recipe! Though, I let it rise for 30 min. while I made my pizza sauce. I also didn't use a pizza stone which didn't effect it. To make it spread easily around the pan, I spray bakery spray or oil on my fingers, so the dough doesn't stick to my fingers. This is a very good recipe!

I really like this recipe. I have tried many pizza crust recipes and this one is the best. I don't have to look anymore. I make thin, thick, and medium crusts. This recipe is good for all. Thanks for sharing.

Truly awesome dough! I made it even an hour in advance and it just made it better. I added a little garlic powder to give it a little something extra!

Overall, I liked the crust and it was so easy to put together.  I ended up using only half the dough because I prefer thin crust. I froze the other half for another time.  I need to play with this a little more to figure out what I think was missing from the crust. It turned out crispy on the outside with a little bit of a chew to it, just like I like.  I just think the flavor wasn't what I was looking for. I will try again for sure.

Very easy crust to work with. I generally use a bit more olive oil--approximately 1/4 cup--and a mixutre of whole wheat and white flour. I also generally pre-bake the crust before topping. Makes it a bit crunchier and keeps the toppings from burning!

Yum!  I replaced 1/2 cup white flour with whole wheat.  I thought the dough was too wet after I made it as directed, so I added a few tbsp of flour until it was easier to work with.  I baked it in a pizza pan and it was soft on the bottom.  Next time I'll cook it for 5 min or so, flip it over, and then add my toppings before baking the rest of the time.  Great, easy recipe, thanks!

This is a great recipe. So simple and it tastes great. Next time I make this dough I am going to add some garlic and butter to the outside crust for a little added flavor.

Pretty easy and basic recipe, I tend to add some extra flour to this recipe as it  is a little sticky. I let it rise once before baking.

This is a favorite recipe for quick dinner nights. The ten minute rest is just enough time to gather toppings and make sauce (add your favorite italian seasonings to one can tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes). I have also used this for focaccia bread. Just top with herbs, a small amount of cheese, and more olive oil.

This is a quick-fix pizza crust, but it's too biscuity for my liking. I might make it again if I'm pinched for time, but I prefer a more traditional raised pizza crust. I'm sure a lot of busy, time pressed cooks will appreciate this recipe for it's short prep time though.

This has been one of my Families Favorite recipes for about 4 years now! This is our standard Friday Pizza Night recipe, I have been asked for the recipe more times than I can remember. Both of my younger sisters who are beginner cooks have tried this and said how easy it was to make! The recipe is so quick easy and delicious!! I have found that the type and quality of the yeast is very important!!! Thanks so much for this great recipe!!

I was skeptical of the short resting time b/c ingredients are the same as a Williams-Sonoma recipe, so I placed a piece of plastic wrap over bowl for the 10 min, I too used my stand mixer w/ dough hook for great results, added in some Italian seasoning w/ flour, I put on rack closer to the top and need to keep in the middle of the oven so bottom of the crust crisps at the same time as cheese browns, this will be my weekly pizza crust recipe - Thanks!

Not as good as I thought it would be based on the previous reviews.  It was very bland and too thick and heavy.  It really does need a little more spices or salt.  It was easy to make and did look very pretty however.

Good stuff.  I made this as directed, leaving the dough still a bit wet and pressing it into a baking pan.  I thought I'd be clever by laying it out real thin since I don't tend to prefer thick, chewy pizza dough (I'm more into thin and crispy).  Even so, it rose quite a bit.  This ended up okay since my family ended up eating it all and they love thick crust pizza.

My uncle, who doesn't really believe in compliments, said it was some of the best pizza he'd ever had.

The only change I made, one which I thought worked out really well, was to sprinkle herb de provence over the crust after I put it in the baking sheet.  The crust itself is mild in flavor and the rosemary, thyme, basil, etc. complimented it nicely.

I recently made this pizza crust and how easy it was i was just amazed.It was so easy that I made two batches of this crust, I used one for pizza and used the other one to make stromboli with. And it was great the only thing diffrent i did was I let it rise for about a half and hr instead of ten mins. But i would highly recommend this recipe to anyone. I have given it several of my friends all ready. Enjoy because it is very good!!!

I'm from Lincoln, NE and was hopeful for a crust similar to our local "Valentino's Restaurant" which is one of my fav's.  
This had a flavor more like a biscuit.  I had made one pie with cream of mushroom soup seasoned with oregano for the 'sauce' and chicken, mushrooms, olives, and cheese for the topping.  May make again for this recipe, but not for pizza.

I made this using 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  I loved it!  I parbaked it for about 8 minutes at 425.  I made it on a large rectangular pizza stone, with cornmeal.  I didn't use all of it as it seemed it would be too thick.  It wasn't "bready" at all.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I have been using this recipe for several months now.  I follow recipe as written, however, I do pre-bake for 10 minutes, add topping, then bake for 10 more minutes.  So much better than store bought. (and faster than delivery)

Jody, great pizza crust. I replaced the sugar with honey and added garlic and onion powders and Italian seasonings to the mix. Because I had time, I let the dough rise and used this recipe for calzones. I made this right in my food processor. Not only ridiculously quick and easy to make, but also very easy to roll out.  Excellent and thank you so much!

Simply put...The best for thin crust pizza.
I have tried them all and this is the easiest to make of all. If you like thin crust pizza this is the recipe. I used a cookie sheet and a pizza stone.....both were crispy. The stone was even crispier...I will use this one from now on!
Enjoy!

This is a decent crust recipe. Dough was really easy to work with, handled well even for these still learning to make bread dough hands. Very generous amount of dough, I could have made a large pizza and a small pizza from this. Bready in texture, like breadsticks. This was a great basic recipe and put together ready for the oven very quickly. This is good for what it is, a really quick fast crust without an hours wait of rise time. Worth a try at least.

For a pizza crust that didn't require rising, it was very good.   It was fairly quick and very easy.  I used bread flour instead of regular flour and I added about 1/2 more flour than called for; without the extra flour it seemed too gooey.  That may not happen if you use regular flour, which I didn't have on hand at the time.   I also used a pizza stone instead of a pan; just sprinkled from cornmeal first so it didn't stick.  I then put the sauce on it and baked it for about ten minutes and THEN put the toppings and cheese on it and cooked about another 15 minutes.  I will definitely make this again, especially when short on time and craving pizza!

This crust has a great flavor, but the texture was a little too soft for us.  "Tender" was the right word for the submitter to use in the description.  It was very easy to make and I might try it again when I'm in a hurry.

Very good, fast pizza dough. It keeps my boyfriend from ordering in all the time. ;) I didn't have enough oil for my fingers so I used flour (unbleached), and I didn't have a pizza stone, so I used one greased perforated pan, and (because I doubled the recipe) one greased and floured pan. Both turned out lovely. I was impatient to get these in the oven, so I didn't really let them rise much, but they still turned out very nice. I will have to try making bread and breadsticks with this recipe. I think it would be ideal.

I love this pizza crust.  I have tried MANY different crust recipes, and I have never come across such a soft, tender dough.  Most dough is tough and very elastic, but this was so soft and so easy to handle, not to mention delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

The dough came out too sticky so I had to add nearly one cup of flour until it was at proper consistency for baking.  Other than that, it was very, very, good and made an excellent deep-dish pizza crust.

I needed a crust in a hurry--I was hungry--and this one fit the bill.  I kneeded the dough for 8 minutes before letting it rest.  The first pizza baked for 20 minutes was too browned.  The second  made from frozen dough baked for 15 minutes--perfecto!

This recipe is definitely quick and easy. However, the crust lacked flavor and was too “bready” for my taste. I prefer a thinner, crisper crust.

This pizza crust is so simple and so fast. Best yet- it is thick and chewy.  I prepare the crust and then while I am slices and chopping the toppings, the crust has plenty of time to rise. Who would have thought- a homemade crust in 10 minutes!

Great pizza dough.  Cooked as is - light fluffy and slightly crisp.  Pre-cooked for 10 mins or so, super crispy crust.
I added about 60ml of chopped oregano to the water mixture and put that into the flour etc.  Made for a great taste in the dough.  Next time I am going to experiment with chilli and tomato paste - "some like it hot".

It was nice not to have to wait 30 min. to an hour for dough to rise.  It was kind of sticky to work with when forming it on my stone, but it baked well and gave good results.  I prebaked it with my sauce for 5 min. then topped it with mozzarella and basil and baked for another 10-15 min. The dough was ready by the time my mozzarella started to brown.

I made this crust for a BBQ chicken pizza, and found it to work quite well. I recommend sprinkling olive oil and Pizza or Italian seasoning on the crust before baking. Great for cooking on a pizza stone.

I’ve been using this recipe for three years and my family still loves it.  It works great for your general pizza toppings as well as for breakfast pizzas. Tips: cover your dough bowl with a thin cloth while it’s at rest  to help maintain temp for your yeast. Work the dough so it’s smooth and shape on parchment paper. Don’t forget to poke some small holes in the bottom to keep the crust from getting air bubbles. Try sprinkling flour on your pizza pan lightly after oiling to get the crust to slide off easily. Brush crust edges with olive oil and a touch of garlic salt.

I have been using this recipe for years, and will continue! It makes the absolute BEST pizza crust, and is especially good on a pizza stone. After making it the first time, I am spoiled for home made pizza. If you haven't invested in a pizza stone and love pizza, do so! You will never go back to ordering out (no matter HOW good the place you order from is!).

This is my go-to pizza crust! I love how quick and easy it is to make. The flavor and texture are terrific - especially baked on a pizza stone. I have used bread flour, regular unbleached and whole wheat and have never had an issue. Sometimes I add dried oregano or Italian seasoning for extra flavor. Love, love this recipe!

Love this recipe!  Kind of reminds me of the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee (sp.?) box  I had growing up - but I can now make from scratch, and with organic ingredients!  Thanks so much!  As other reviewers said, so easy to personalize with herbs and spices of your choice!

Very bready!  Tripled recipe, well needed to make 3 pizzas.  Of the dough I made, One 12in round, came out thick even though we rolled dough about paper thin.  One 18in iron griddle (round) again, came out thick.  and TWO 13 x 18 cookie sheets that are more deep dish than Chicago.  Dough is not crusty, more like a nice soft bread.

Way easy...made me more willing to make pizza crust from scratch in the future, the kids loved it. Added thyme and basil to the top, probably let it rise too long.

Really great crust!  Easy to make!  I made this into one 14 inch pizza, cooked it at 425 degrees without toppings for 10 minutes, added toppings and cooked for another 10 minutes, took out of pizza pan and put directly on pizza stone for another 3 minutes.  Perfect!

This was good but next time I will pre bake the crust first before adding toppings (not quite as done as I'd like in the middle)  or cut it in half like another reviewer did and make 2  thin crust pizzas. I did add a little garlic powder and Italian seasoning. It is a good basic pizza dough.

Very easy, nice texture. I baked the crust for 10 minutes in a cast iron skillet, then added the toppings and returned it to the oven. The flavor is a little bland. When I make it the next time I plan to add some garlic powder.

This is excellent thank you SOOOO much.    I have made this several times.  My only change is a gluten-free flour blend.  It still turns out amazing.  I often add Italian seasoning to the dough or flavor infused olive oil as a twist.

I can see how this could be a great recipe but unfortunately I must have done something wrong.  the texture of mine tasted like the pre made varieties found at the grocery store.  the flavor was off (I did add Italian seasonings).  maybe next time I will try letting it rise longer.  for my first time, it wasn't too bad though

I added garlic and italian seasoning to the crust, baked for 5 minutes before adding the toppings. It was wonderful for such a quick and simple recipe. I also brushed butter, garlic, and parmesan onto the the crust when adding the toppings. I used a four cheese rosa sauce and an italian cheese blend for my toppings. I also put some corn meal down before the crust.

I really liked this crust! I followed the recipe, and made 1 large 14" pizza crust. I preheated the oven to 450 degrees with my pizza stone in the oven on the lowest rack. I formed the dough on a piece of parchment paper, the same size as my stone, and slid it onto the stone with my pizza peel. I pre-baked my crust for 10 minutes, lowering the temp to 425 after putting the crust on the stone. I removed the crust from the oven, slipping the pizza peel between the crust and the parchment, and then left it cool on top of the pizza peel on the kitchen counter.  When it was time to bake, I preheated the oven to 425 with the stone on the middle rack this time. I added the toppings and slid the pizza directly on the stone and baked for another 6 minutes, then switching the oven to broil for about another 4 minutes until the fresh mozzarella on top starting to bubble and brown. The crust was about 1/4" thick, and nicely brown on the bottom and edges, with a slight crunch to it. Would use this recipe and method again! Thanks!

Excellent  pizza crust.  I made the dough in my mixer using a dough hook. I used a pizza pan with lots of holes in the bottom of the pan.  The crust baked just fine.  I also did as another reviewer suggested: place the dough  in the pan on the lowest rack and bake in preheated oven at 500* for 10 mins.  Then remove the crust and top it with sauce, cheese and toppings. Return the pan to using the middle rack and bake at 450* for an additional 15 mins. My family gave it rave reviews. The crust was nice and crispy as we like it.
Thank you goes to both the author for a great recipe and to the  reviewer with a great baking suggestion!!

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients, however I let it sit out for over an hour.  It was okay, I am curious if I would have used it after the 10 minute rest period maybe it would have been better.

Was easy and delicious! I forgot about it and let it sit for 1 hour instead of 10 min.  Will use this as my go-to crust. Hands down a great chewy crust!

Absolutely wonderful!! I added italian seasoning and garlic salt to the flour before mixing it into the water, yeast, sugar and oil. Smelled just like a pizzeria when we were pre-baking. This recipe is a keeper!

this will be the new pizza crust of choice after trying many on this site.Very easy.. the only change I made was to substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose and I did use other's suggestions and add herbs to the crust.

This is my go to pizza crust. I double the recipe and substitute the olive oil for melted butter (or vegan margerine if my dairy allergic son will have some.)  The butter gives the dough so much rich flavour. I made it with olive oil once and it was bland.

The dough worked nicely , and I only let it rest for 10 min.  I doubled the recipe and baked on three cookie sheets . One large , med. and a small . Produced a very thin crust with chew , plus crispy to hard ends.  After it baked i brushed end crust with melted butter garlic. Also followed reviewers sugg about oven temp and time . Pizza was cooked all the way through (yeah). Tasted good enough to make feel like I was glad  we didn't order out ! Update /single recipie/ used buttered 13x9 rect stone pan at  425 for 15 min resulting good chew/soft  crust again with crispy ends. This time no dough resting,straight into pan .  keeper ...thanks!

I think that , ideally, the most flavorful crust is made the day before, but if you are like me and don’t plan well, this will work out fine.  I would decrease the sugar a little but it was a nice, crisp crust.

This recipe is great if you like a good thick crust that isn't greasy. It's so easy to make. I've used this recipe to make pizza and also for Stromboli's (just cut dough in half and it's enough for 2 large Stromboli's).

Great starter crust and so easy!  I used half wheat, half white and decorated it with thyme and basil before adding toppings.   Baked per recommended time and it turned out great!  Next time we'll add a little more sugar and garlic to the crust.

This crust turned out great after I added extra flour. I made it as instructed but it was very moist, almost runny. Is the flour amt. correct?

Fantastic! I used Goat Cheese Arugula Pizza - No Red Sauce! And Pesto Sauce from AR. Put in a medium jelly roll pan. Prepared exactly as is with the exception of flipping pizza dough halfway through the baking process and flattening out to get a thinner crust.

I've Made this recipe exactly as is probably 30-40 times. I sometimes make a few adjustments but even as is this is a tried and true five star recipe.  I sometimes add garlic salt instead of regular salt. I also sometimes add pizza seasoning. I've also replaced 1c of all purpose flour with 1c whole wheat flour. It turns out great every time. It makes a perfect size pizza for my family of five (three smaller children) I've also used this recipe to make cheese sticks and calzones. It's a great basic recipe.

It was easy to make, pretty tasty with added seasoning, and cooked perfectly through with a crispy bottom in about 12 minutes. Unfortunately, the rest of the pizza was like a giant, fluffy biscuit.

I wonder if it was the recipe, or something I did wrong. At least I know how to make biscuits now!

This is good!  The dough is sometimes a little under cooked on the bottom and over cooked on the top, but other than that its a great recipe! sometimes I add a little bit more yeast than what it calls for if I don't want as thin of a crust

Love this recipe! I use it once a week! I add Italian seasoning, pepper and garlic powder to it :) I've also made donuts with this recipe! Add a bit more sugar, cut into little squares, fry and roll in sugar! Yum! And crowd favourite :D

I made this crust tonight and wow it is so easy to make. I love the simple ingredients and prep to cook time. The only change I made was using bread flour instead of AP flour. I really never buy any flour besides AP but I thought I'd try it and I'm glad I did. The bread flour really helped to crisp up the crust. I spread the crust onto a baking sheet and baked it at 500 for 5-10 minutes (I forgot the exact time but somewhere between these, just keep an eye on it). I took it out, spread pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings on top and baked it at 450 for 15-20 minutes. The crust was good but next time I think I will make 2 pizzas so I get really super thin crusts which are my favorite. Overall, a tasty and easy crust recipe and I will use again.

We tried this recipe because it seemed the easiest. Neither of us had made a pizza crust from scratch. I was doubtful at first because the dough seemed so dry, & I didn't think that once we stretched it out onto the pan that it would hold all our toppings. (Admittedly, we put on a lot.) I also spread liberal amounts of olive oil onto the dough just in case. Anyhow, the pizza & crust turned out perfectly! Kudos for the best pizza crust recipe ever.

Significantly better than any chain restaurant pizza. Made in a bread machine substituting bread flour for the all purpose and rapid rise yeast. Was perfect!

. I dont have a pizza stone so i used a cast iron pan  it worked to make a great thick crusted deep dish pizzaThe first time. Today I doubled the dough and rolled it out into a thin pizza crust and still baked in a cast iron pan the pizzas turned out great both ways! Next time I think I'll make calzones!

This is an excellent recipe. When I followed the recipe exactly the dough was a bit sticky. Too sticky to work with. The next time I added 1/4 cup of flour and let it sit for 45 min. I liked the texture and consistency. I have used both a cookie sheet and a pizza stone. The dough was much crispier with the stone. I also added some olive oil and dry Italian seasoning to the top of the dough. This gave the dough much more flavor.

Not horrible, did what it says on the tin, but more like cheapo frozen pizza than good crust. Rise time probably would help.

Good, easily customizable recipe that came out well on regular baking sheets. Next time I'm pressing it out thinner and preheating the baking sheet so it crisps even more.

This is my favorite pizza crust recipe. It's good, easy, and fast! I add garlic and butter or cheese to the crust sometimes. It's been a staple in our house for over a year. Every time I make it for guests, it gets GREAT reviews!! :)

A quick, easy pizza crust that's easy to change up! I use whole wheat flour and add some garlic and italian seasoning for some extra taste. It works great with any type of pizza and has a nice taste!

This is a super easy recipe. I found that the crust was a little too soft so I prebake mine for 5 minutes and the crust came out perfect. This is the only way we eat pizza now

I have deviated from this recipe and like it much better.  I don't add the sugar, but instead add garlic salt (I never measure it but I probably use about 1 1/2 tablespoons) to the yeast/water/oil mixture before mixing in the flour.  I also sprinkle more garlic salt over the crust before adding remaining ingredients.

Made this recipe exact and cut the dough into 4 pieces to make margherita pizzas on a pizza stone on the bottom rack at 500 degrees.  I didn't have to pre-bake the dough.  Just rolled out the dough, added toppings and cooked each pizza for about 8 minutes.  This recipe creates a crispy and tasty crust.  I will definitely be making this one over and over and over again! Thanks for submitting!

This was a really good crust that baked very well. I will definitely use it again.  I made it according to the recipe and cooked it on a baking stone.  I brushed the edges of the crust with olive oil after it was dressed.  I added a sprinkle of cornmeal onto the preheated baking stone and it did not stick at all - it slid off onto the peel with ease!  When the pizza was sliced, you could pick it up and the pizza did not droop at all as the crust was perfectly crispy with a nice golden color.  The only part about it was that it didn't have a lot of flavor which could be easily fixed by taking the advise on the recipe and using seasonings on the crust or even in the dough.  I only used seasonings atop the cheese so will use seasoning in the crust next time.

The best! I proofed the yeast first, then added everything into my bread maker (I added 1tsp garlic pwd) on the dough and rise cycle. Then I rolled out and added toppings and baked as directed. The crust was airy and crisp. I've been searching for this recipe!!!

I use to purchase pizza yeast to make my crust. Not anymore. My family really enjoyed it and it was very easy. The rest time for the dough was perfect since I really only had to wait long enough for the oven to preheat

I have made this crust a couple of times and I usually let the crust rise for about an hour or so. The outside gets crispy but the inside is fluffy and delish! Now all I have to do is learn how to make it into a circle!

We made this for dinner tonight (with half white whole wheat flour).  It didn't taste the way I expect pizza crust to taste, but was delicious and I'll be using it again.  It actually tasted more like the soft rolls that came with dipping oil before the meal at a restaurant we used to love before moving.  It held up well under the weight of the toppings, though, despite its softness.  Note that the olive oil is the dominant flavor.  If you try to swap a different oil, or reduce the amount, expect to feel like something is missing.

I think I'll cut the sugar a bit (too sweet for me). It was also more crumbly than chewy. Great when you are in a hurry, though.

Excellent recipe! I used 3 cups flour though otherwise it gets a little tough to handle, also this one will definitely make 2 thin-crust pizza's about 10-11inch each.  Only thing I'd recommend if using a pizza stone, brush crust edges with olive-oil, this will golden-brown them nicely and also you'll avoid risking the crust stuck to your stone:)  thanks for sharing awesome dough!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but let it rest for closer to 20-25 minutes.  I spread the dough out onto a lightly oiled pan sprinkled with corn meal.  Then I sprinkled the top of the dough with oregano, basil, and a little garlic powder.  Baked on the lower rack of the oven for 5 minutes, then took out and added sauce, minced garlic, and mozzarella & provolone cheeses, and brushed the crust edges with a little olive oil.  Baked for approx 14 more minutes on the middle rack.  Pizza was very good, and the crust was very thick, which I like.  So if you like thin crusts, you'll want to use a very large pan or make two pizzas with this recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a quick and easy pizza crust to make. I really had a craving for pizza today. I used whole wheat flour when I made my crust and it came out great! To those people who said the crust didnt have any flavor well of course you have to add to some herbs or something to give it a taste. Before I put my toppings and cheese on I spread some pesto the crust and it came out fantastic.

I have tried a lot of different recipes for pizza crust before and this one is tops.  I will say before I start that the first time I made this recipe I followed the directions as written except I got busy during the 10 min rise time and it ended up being more like 30 or 40 min.  It turned out so good that I decided to just stick with the extra rise time, each time I've made it.  This makes a lot of dough.  I usually double the batch and freeze half of it.  Mine has always come out thick like a deep dish pizza, however, it's not to dense.  My husband raves about how good the pizza is every time I make it.  Says it's better than any where we could order in or get take out from.  My most recent experiment with this recipe was to try and make it a little more healthy.  So I used one cup of whole wheat flour and a cup and a half of spelt flour, I double the batch so the other 2.5 cups were A.P. flour.  It really worked well and I think next time I'll just do away with the A.P. flour all together.  Additionally on my last experiment with this recipe I also substituted the sugar for honey.  It worked out quite nicely.  If you don't want a thick crust then you can just cut the rise time or let it rise and then just spread the dough out real thin.  If you want it thin you can probably get almost 2 pizza out of the recipe as listed.  
Thank you Jody for sharing this very tasty recipe.

This is delicious crust!  I made it just as the recipe states, except I added some garlic powder since others mentioned it needed more flavor.  This dough plumps up nicely in the oven which is what sets it apart from most other recipes I've tried for homemade pizza crust. I think I've finally found a recipe I can stick with!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  My 3 yr old daughter and I decided to try to make our own pizza's with just what we have in the house instead of having to run to the store.  She had a lot of fun making her own, it was simple and it turned out delicious.  Now I know how to quiet the older ones anytime they fuss for pizza :D I plan to make some for dinner tonight with many topping ideas

My kids love pizza so I usually buy them frozen. After just making this recipe a few minutes ago I will NEVER buy frozen pizza again! This is by far the best and easiest pizza crust I have ever made. It blows Jay's Signature Pizza Crust out of the water, and I didn't even have to knead it! It has all the texture and flavor we love with none of the work! It rises in the oven like a dream, and the best part is there are no artificial ingredients, just homemade goodness. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! And since my very picky 12 year old is home sick today it has been kid tested and given a high approval rating!

Very balanced.  You can roll it thin as it crisps up nicely at 425 deg F.  We used a baking pan and proofed (raise dough 5 mins at 250).

This recipe is definitely easy. And you'll love it if you are a fan of thick crust. But if you prefer thin crust, use a different recipe. That is the reason for my low score. It's way too thick for pizza. Almost like a fluffy pancake.

LOVE this crust. My family goes crazy when I make pizza.  I usually add oregano and garlic salt to the mix before I stir it all in.  After the crust is spread out on the pan, I add olive oil, basil, and grated parm.  this makes the crust crispier and adds a little bit more flavor and color to the crust making it taste, look, and smell like a parlors pizza.

As in another review, my edges were perfect, but the middle wasn't baked through. Next time I will partially pre-bake it first, then add the toppings and bake again. Or as another did, bake at 400 for 20 min. I added basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the dough, and sprinkled corn meal on the pizza stone. I can't wait to try this again...LOVED the crust!

Awesome by itself, I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic and italian seasonings, fresh... Made two baby pizzas for the babies, and some bread sticks and a braided loaf, so soft, so fluffy and light. LOVE IT!!!

I think my yeast was a little old but this still turned out great!  Tasted good, had good flavor, and super simple to make!  I used the baked potato pizza on this and also made one with pepperoni and olives!  Thanks!

Easy to make, easy to shape, easy to eat!  Made it for the family.  It came out looking like we ordered it from one of the pro's - it was an instant hit!
I use this recipe to make a crust that covers my entire pizza stone.  There is plenty of room to stuff th crust when I feel a little froggy!

This is an excellent quick pizza dough recipe. It makes two twelve-inch, thin crust pizzas, or one really thick one. I prefer Jay's Signature Pizza Crust when I have more time (more flavorful), but this is great for most days. Thanks so much!

I will definitely be using the recipe again! I was so surprised how good it turned out. I did not think it would with how easy the directions were! It was pretty sticky, therefore it was too hard to get onto the stone that was already in the oven preheating. With my first pizza I slipped it onto the stone once the crust crisped up and cooked it the rest of the way on the stone. My second one I cooked the whole way on the pizza pan (on top of the stone) and the first one (on the stone) browned up better. Both were delicious. Super easy and super fast! Thanks for a great recipe, Jody!

Unfortunately, this dough just doesn't rise quite right. It dries out very quickly, and the flavor is lacking. My recommendation is trying a different recipe! :/

Perfect.... I love the crust. I used it to make Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I sprinkled garlic powder and parmasan cheese on the crust as well as using basil with my sauce. Will make again for calzones or vegetable pizza.

OMGOODNESS. Who ever put this recipe up. Thank you. This is the best pizza crust recipe ever. The only thing I did different was pre-baked the crust then added toppings and baked till cheese melted.

I've used this recipe twice now; once for pizza and once for calzones. I add garlic and oregano to the dough with the flour and brush it with olive oil and more garlic before baking and it has come out great both times. I recommend rolling the dough out pretty thin if you're going to make calzones and extending the baking time. Great recipe! Thanks.

This dough was so easy to prepare and work with, and it tasted good.  Texture was pretty good - somewhat crisp edge, but not too hard.  It was a little bit doughy, but if I had spread it out a little more I would have gotten the type of crisp/chewy crust we prefer.  I brushed the edges with olive oil and sprinkled with parmesan before baking, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.

One of the best pizza crust recipes I have found so far.  I substitute a tsp of garlic salt for the salt and then add 1/2 tsp of salt.  I also add 1 tsp of basil, and 1 tsp of oregano to the mixture before adding the flour.  I use a 9x13 glass pan greased with olive oil.  The crust turns out with just enough crunch and tastes great.  I love it with a white sauce... (butter, garlic, olive oil, oregano and basil) and top it with tomato slices and nicely seasoned boneless skinless chicken tenderloins... Great!!

6/6 say this is a great dough! I just added some thyme, basil, oregano, and rosemary and it was so delicious! It is best to use a mortar and pestle to grind the herbs down and relese the oils before mixing it in. Just about 1TBS of each, added in with the salt worked fantastic!

This was pretty good! I added honey instead of sugar, and slightly less oil. We baked it at 475- first prebaked it with no toppings for about 4-5 minutes, then did about 11 minutes with toppings. It was a nice thicker crust.

This recipe was great! However, I made it about two hours sooner than I should have and rose to about triple it's size! I would suggest using it as soon as possible.

I really enjoyed this crust. Simple to prepare, fast, and tasty. The crust was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I will certainly be adding this one to the rotation. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I added Greek and Italian seasonings to the dough as I was making it. My kiddos loved it and said it was a make again recipe. Very easy to make, did mine in a stand mixer.

I have searched long and hard for a really good pizza crust recipe & tried several & even came up with my own. But I had lost my secret recipe & decided to go with this one & you know what, it was really good & on point. I just substituted 1/2 of the white flour with wheat flour. So, if you like a thin pizza crust, this is the one to choose : ) Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I thought this was a great pizza crust. It came out great. My picky three year old is on her second piece.  I, like everyone else, added in Italian spices into the mix and some garlic, and I also subbed a cup of whole wheat flour- which gave it a great texture and more nutrients. I baked at 400 for 20 minutes and it came out thick, soft and flavorful.

Good basic dough recipe. I doubled for two pizzas; reduced olive oil by two tbs; good thing because I thought it might have too much liquid and it would have. It was almost just right, had to add just a little flour.

I know, I know, I shouldn't rate a recipe that I make a ton of changes on but I thought it might help others.  This was great! I used kosher salt instead of regular, added a couple of shakes of garlic powder and a hefty pinch of Italian seasoning to the liquid portion before mixing in the flour.  I used it for calzones instead of pizza and as I don't have a baking stone I preheated my cast iron skillet and baked on it on a piece of parchment paper.  Will definately make again!  Very flavorful and the texture was nice and fluffy.

This was super fast and easy. I subbed in 1 c of whole wheat flour for the AP. I used it to make calzones instead of pizza. Great for a quick and easy pizza dough!

Not impressed. Went together easily and rolled out very nicely but the texture was really off.  Not soft and doughy like we are used to.

This is much better than the recipe I had been using.  Next time I will pre-bake my crust (don't have a pizza stone) and divide it b/t 2 pans for a thinner crust.  This is like a hand-tossed crust, which is good, but thinner=less calories!  I also used 1 c. wheat flour and 1&1/2 white, and decreased the olive oil to 2 T.  I used this crust to make the Buffalo Chicken pizza from this site-YUM!

Delicious!! I have made Paula Dean pizza crust many times before this and it is not as good or easy as this.  I baked it on a lower rack of my oven because I found that the top got done before the crust was golden brown.  I used corn meal on my pizza stone to prevent sticking.  I found it is really good to brush the crust with melted butter that has parmesan cheese and garlic salt added to it.  Absolutely delicious!!

This is one of the easier pizza crusts that I've made. Love that it is super easy to mix. The directions were straightforward.  Used some of the suggestions in the other reviews such as extra flavorings on the crust. A smashing hit. Thank you!

I enjoyed  this recipe, been making my own crust for some time but this recipe comes out softer and is much quicker than the last one I was using.  I did substitute 1 c. of whole wheat flour and decreased the AP flour to 1 1/2 cups.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved it!  I haven't had much luck with pizza crust in the past but this was great!  I substituted 1 cup of the all purpose flour with wheat flour, which turned out really good!  Very quick and easy too, which is always a huge bonus for a mom :)

Thought this turned out great and was extra easy  except was too much dough for my pizza pan. Next time I'll try it on my larger baking sheet.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  I added garlic and italian seasoning.  Rather than making a pizza crust I made bread sticks.  Topped each stick with a little cheese and baked.  Made it to partner up with spaghetti.

This has been our standard pizza dough for a while.  Not even half bad with whole wheat flour although the water has to be adjusted. Lately, I've been doubling the recipe and using 1/2 of the dough for bread sticks.  I add an additional teaspoon or so of salted Italian seasoning to the bread sticks to give them a bit more flavor - as breadsticks they need a bit more salt.

I made 2 batches at the same time because I wanted 2 big pizzas.  One I made by hand and the other I made in my bread machine.  They both turned out EXACTLY the same, no one could tell them apart.

Very simple, delicious recipe.  Sprinkled sesame seed on the counter and placed the dough on top, using oiled hands I made a 6" diameter round (I have a pizza pan with the holes, if I had a stone or a solid pan this could be done on it).  I used white cheddar, garlic, hot banana pepper and mango for the topping, it was excellent and the hour it took to put together was no longer than it takes the local pizza place to deliver.  Thank you!
added July 2010...the second time it was better than the first, especially the crust, simple, light and delicious.

This was an alright recipe.  It didn't cook all the way through, even though I rolled it out to more than a 12" round.  It tasted like your average pizza crust.

Read other reviews, crust is too doughy. :-( After baking at 425 for 15 min. I removed a few pizza slices from foil and toasted on med. high for a few minutes in toaster oven. Crust became crispier:)

Just made pizza tonight using this and only adding a special italian blend of seasonings, and it is just AMAZING! Better than order-out or store-bought, and even makes the best breadsticks and cheesybread :-) if you want thinner crust, it's hard to achieve but possible! Just stretch thin, poke holes ALL over the dough including the crust area, and keep brushing the crust with butter :-)

This was very good.  My family loved it!  Better if you let it cool off a little before eating.  Put it in the oven for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings so it wouldn't be soggy.  Will definitely make again!

Super easy and tasty!  I added herbs in with the flour and also brushed the crust with olive oil while baking.  I didn't know how much it would rise, but actually made a fairly deep crust.  I'll probably do 2 smaller / thinner crusts from the dough in the future, but the recipe is DELICIOUS!

I used 1/2 wheat flour in place of the white.  I also prebaked crust for 10 minutes on pizza stone before I added toppings!  This truly is better than any of the chains!!!

This is a FABULOUS crust! I use it all the time, in fact, it's the only one I ever use. And you simply MUST use a pizza stone. I bought one and have never gone back!

I have this same recipe from a bread machine cookbook and wanted to share it works fantastically in a bread machine.  I omit the sugar and add a tablespoon of italian seasoning to the dough as well.  Very good!!

This was just a little different from another crust I make but my husband said it was harder to manipulate. Is there not a recipe out there for a crust that can be tossed? Tasted great though!

My first time making a crust... followed the directions exactly.  Like other people said, the crust comes out biscuit-like in the middle which tastes strange with the pizza toppings.

i think this is my new all time favorite pizza crust recipe--finally one that crunches up on the bottom! i played around with the proportions a bit to use 3. c. of flour (for two crusts) but it came out so wet i had to add at least a cup more of flour. on the stone it came out cracker thin----in a 9x13 jellyroll pan it rose quite nicely! great both ways!

The best pizza crust I have ever had. I usually have problems with pizza crust baking up evenly. This one baked evenly. It was simple. I did sprinkle it with garlic powder too and it was totally delicious!!!!!!!!!!!

This was an excellent crust. The only thing I did different was to roll out the dough using a rolling pin,and sprinkled about 1 tablespoon of cornmeal on the pizza stone. No need to precook the dough.

great and simple pizza dough recipe. it doesn't get any simpler than this, but it tastes great. make it for any kind of pizza - but i'd recommend adding some garlic, onion, or parsley (or any herb really) and that'll make it taste like what u'd get at a home-style pizza place.

This is a great quick pizza crust. I was able to whip out 2 homemade pizzas in about an hour ( doubled the recipe ). I let my yeast mixture sit for about 5 min. to develop. The texture was nice and chewy. Next time I'll brush the edge with olive oil to give it a little more crispness. Thanks.

This is the best pizza crust.  I have had compliments that it taste better than your local pizza delivery.  It is very simple to make, just make sure you get a good rise.  I like to add olive oil to the bottom of my pizza pan for a crispier crust.

The only thing I did differently was to roll the dough out before transferring it to my pan.  After resting for 10 minutes the dough was really easy to handle.  I baked it about 18 minutes on the bottom rack of my oven.  Great pizza, quicker than delivery!

This is a good crust, just not the best I've ever had.  It was my first homemade crust.  I typically double the batch of the Great Value brand crust mix from Walmart - and it turns out amazing!
And I didn't think it tasted like Val's.  It was more like Pizza Hut's without the grease.

This was a pretty good pizza dough. I made it using my Kitchen-Aid Stand Up mixer. I don't think I let it mix enough, or maybe it was too much, it just had a rough look to it. I didn't change the recipe at all and this is the first time I have made a no rise dough, or a dough that wasn't made in my bread machine. I think I'll go back to using my other recipe for the time being until I can get this one worked out. It was off some how, very doughy and soft. I prefer a crunchier crust and so does DBF. It is worth giving a chance if you are short on time.

I have been making homemade pizza for my family for several years.  We recently moved and I misplaced my basic dough recipe, so I searched on the site and picked this dough to make.  My family LOVED it!  They told me I didn't have to keep looking for the old recipe! :0)

I did add a bit more sugar.  And note, the dough is pretty sticky so you'll be tempted to add more flour but don't!  I'm convinced that's why it bakes up so nicely!  Also, I prebaked my dough in the pizza pan for about 15 minutes to make sure it would cook all the way through, then added toppings & cheese and baked for another 15 minutes.  I topped it off with about a minute and a half under the broiler.  

All the way around, this pizza crust was great!  It reminded my husband and I of Uno's Restaurant in Chicago.  5 stars for sure!

without question the best crust I've made...and I've been working on it for a while.  I added 3 generous tbls of oil and let it rise for 2 hrs.  I used garlic oil in the dough and brushed the crust with with it when it first came out of the oven, then dusted it with parm cheese.  delish!!!

This pizza crust is awesome!  It has one more tablespoon of olive oil than the recipe we've used in the past, and it makes all the difference.  Bakes up thick and soft and delicious. Thanks!

I would have given this 5 stars except I had to make a little adjustment.  The dough seemed very dry and after adding a little more water it worked out ok.  I did add 1/2 teasp. garlic powder, 1/2 teas. onion powder and 1/2 teasp. italian spices.  Next time I will add a little more of the spices.  I also took the advice of others and baked it about 7 minutes before adding the toppings.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks!

I love this recipe I will never need another recipe for pizza again. We sprinkled pizza seasoning and garlic on the crust before adding the sauce. We were so impressed with this recipe. At first we were a little leary because it was still a little sticky, but it rose beautifully and turned out to be one of the best crusts that I have ever tasted!

Good, but kind of bland.  I did substitute garlic salt for the salt.  I made two big pizzas.  One I baked on a pizza stone and the other on a normal pizza pan.  The one in the pan turned out better - the crust rose more and the bottom was nicely done.  It was also on the lower shelf of my oven.  I would have given this recipe 4.5 stars if it would have let me.  It was very good, but not perfect.

tried it once on a pizza stone and it was a little to crispy for me (and great luck to you trying to get in onto the stone!!), tried it again on insulated baking sheet... LOVED IT! my husband even ate his crusts, he usually doesn't touch them!  will use again and again!

This is the recipe I have used for years for deep dish pizza. It's not personal favorite as I have worked with many pizza crust recipes over time, but it's absolutely foolproof and you know what to expect every single time you make it. Yum!

I really liked this recipe because you can whip it up without much prep time. When we made it, we cooked it for a few minutes before putting on the sauce and toppings and it was great!

I purchased a pizza stone about three months ago and haven't used it once, until today.  This recipe rocks, my pizza crust turned out perfect! I am definitely keeping this receipe as a solid base for pizza dough when I don't have enough time to allow it rise.  Next time however, I will be adding seasoning to my taste.  Otherwise, this is a very simple, basic, easy recipe that I will be using for years to come.

I am really annoyed right now. 

I decided to make this for my 16 month old son for lunch. It was a fantastic idea at first as he used some of the dough as playdough while I made the pizza. 

I cooked it a few minutes before hand w/ olive oil on it. Then I topped it with sauce and cheese. 

It has been in the oven for almost 40 minutes and it is STILL DOUGHY. 

I followed the directions to a T! 

This is so frustrating. 

Any ideas what I did wrong. BTW I am not a novice at cooking!

Pretty good.  I used 1 1/2 cups of whole grain wheat flour, so the texture was altered.  Next time, I will prebake the crust for a bit, before loading the topings.
Thanks for sharing

This crust was really easy and quick, but I really didn't like the texture.  I agree with other reviews that said it just tastes like bread.  I think next time I'll invest the extra time to make a different crust or just buy pre-made dough.  Thanks, though!

Like a previous comment, it tasted like pizza on bread.  It wasn't horrible tasting, but I'd buy frozen pizza before making this one again.  Good pizza takes time.

My husband gave this 4 stars, but still said Boboli & Pizza Hut were better.  It was very bready.  I tend to like my crust a little more crisp/chewy.  It was very quick, which was great.  And for those of you interested - I used a pizza stone...

There isn't anything wrong with this pizza crust, but it also isn't anything spectacular.  It tastes very very similar-in taste and texture- to the inexpensive bagged crusts that you just add half a cup of water and stir.  It just doesn't have that homemade pizza crust taste.  I may make it again if I  don't have time for my normal recipe for homemade and I have no bag crusts on hand.

This was a good pizza crust.  I did try adding cornmeal on the bottom of it and it was a nice touch.  The only think I would change is to make the crust crispier wich I will work on next time I try it.

This is fantastic!
I have been looking for an easy, quick pizza crust recipe to have on hand, and this is it. From the time I printed the recipe to the time I was eating my pizza, it was less than one hour. You can't do better than that.

I am foremost rating this on ease.  I could think of many scenarios when this recipe would be at one's fingertips. (unexpected company, sudden craving)  I didn't change anything.  I spread this out onto a cookie sheet and baked for 17 minutes (thinner crust) **I sprayed my fingertips with cooking spray and that worked like a charm!** There was no doughiness at all in the middle(and I used fresh sliced tomatoes)  I used this on a chicken garlic pizza so the crust was brushed w/alot of garlic and herbs so honestly, couldn't tell if the crust was bland.  I don't care for a thinner crust but this is great in a pinch.

Delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. The only semi negative thing is that it stuck to my pizza stone. That could be because it was only the 2nd time I had used it. It didn't really matter though, it was so good that I will totally make it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this today and my family had it for lunch, they are eating the leftovers, cold, right now. I decided I better get on here and rate it, since they loved it so much. We make pizza a lot and I just decided to try a new recipe for the crust. My husband says this one should replace my old recipe!

not bad for a quick crust, but it was a little difficult to work with and as mentioned elsewhere did have a biscuity texture.

Easiest pizza crust I have ever made and the tastiest.  It spread out in the pan in seconds.  I looked down at the pan shocked at how easy and quick it was.  No messiness or stickiness.  I made the best white/olive oil pizza I have ever eaten!
