It was good but the portions were off. I had to add extra milk to make enough sauce for all the pasta, For extra flavor I added a half a can of chicken stock and let it cook down a little. But I enjoyed it.

I used chicken cooked with sambal oelek chili paste, an idea I found in another recipe to add some spice and didn't add asparagus. Also substituted sunflower seeds for the pine nuts. Didn't quite get the sauce right so I added corn starch to thicken. It turned out great. I will definitely make again.
