I've made this at least four times as it's a quick and easy recipe to master. I like the consistency and the flavor of the sauce - not too thin or runny, yet not so thick I can't pour it on pancakes or spoon over Panna Cotta. I prefer this to store bought as it is not overly sweet and I know what ingredients are in it. Just use a little more sweetener, like a a few more tablespoons, if the blueberries are sour(taste them first) or do ALL orange juice - instead of 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 cup orange juice - do 3/4 cup orange juice. If the sauce is too thin use more thickener (cornstarch) and/or cook it a little longer. Most times the sauce thickens pretty well on its own in the fridge, however, if it's too thick - use less thickener and/or less frozen blueberries (thaw and drain) next time. Same with the lemon flavor being overpowering - use a little less. It's a fairly forgiving recipe. Experiment and make the recipe your own. Thanks you Bri bri for the recipe - it's become a family favorite.

After seeing so many beautiful pictures and good reviews on this sauce recently, I decided to make it as a topping for pancakes this morning and a filling for crepes tomorrow.  My citrus loving daughter can't get enough, but I think that I would have preferred a sauce without so much citrus flavor.  No fault of the recipe (hence the name), just a personal preference.  The way the recipe comes together and thickens is terrific and easy.  Will probably use this again, but reduce the OJ or omit the lemon juice.  Thanks!

I just love the the flavor the cinnamon and citrus adds to the blueberries. Yum! I used fresh blueberries because they were going bad and I wanted to use them. Because I used fresh rather than frozen blueberries, there was less water so I should have used less cornstarch. My syrup was a little too thick but, tasted ooooh so good!

Wonderful flavor, but was alittle to runny in my opinion. Will make again to see maybe I did something different that made it runny.

Delicious!  Served on pancakes and it was a nice change from the overly sweet maple syrup.  I fresh squeezed my OJ and I think that makes a big difference.  Had some left over and I can't wait to try some on vanilla ice cream!

Delicious berry sauce.  I used fresh berries but other than that followed as is.  Great flavor, loved the citrusy undertones. Used as a topping for pound cake and was a huge hit.  Will be making again for pancake topping.  Thanks for the great topper!

I like the tart tang the lemon gives this sauce. The cinnamon is a nice touch too. Subtle. I used dried wild blueberries in place of frozen, using half the amount called for, and it resulted in a much thicker sauce than I am sure is normal. I thought I may have to reduce the sugar as well because of the dried berries, but it was perfect. The lemon keeps it from being overly sweet. Served over blueberry flax panakes (allrecipes) it made for a double dose of blueberry deliciousness.

The texture of this sauce is spot on. I used to top mini cheesecakes. I thought this would be a good topping since the cheesecakes were naturally sweet, but it didn't work out that way. The orange and lemon juice made it too sour. This is a good sauce, just not what I was going for.

Yum!  I had blackberries to use up, so used this recipe as a guideline, substituting blackberries for the blueberries.  Yummy over pancakes, and we look forward to having it over vanilla ice cream...  I will definitely make with blueberries as well in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

First recipe I tried for a blueberry sauce and it is a winner.  I love the recipe exactly as it is listed.  I also like to switch out the berries with blackberries or make it a triple berry sauce.

I had about 1 cup of fresh blueberries that needed to be used. I changed the recipe a bit to fit the amount of blueberries I had. I was out of orange juice, so I substituted a bit of lemon juice. I cooked the blueberries and water till boiling. I then placed mixture in blender and pureed. I returned the mix to saucepan; added other ingredients and cooked until thickened. I served with fluffy pancakes(from this site). I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I don't usually write reviews but this sauce was so delicious, I feel inspired to do so! I made it the night before and reheated it in the morning to serve over waffles.  It was such a hit!  As others described, this is not overly sweet, but just sweet enough.  My dad is very picky and he even kept going back for more!  This is a keeper! :)

This was a wonderufl topping for pound cake. I made it with lemonade instead of OJ because that's what I had, and I could tell that the OJ would have been wonderful. I had a number of people ask for the recipe.

Super easy! I didn’t have oj so used pineapple juice instead and I didn’t use white cane sugar I substituted coconut sugar. Great easy treat to compliment weekly pancakes.

This is a great recipe.  Just the right amount of lemon juice and orange juice.  Wonderful on ice cream.  So easy to make, and very quick.  This is certainly a keeper for us.

This was delicious. I did not have enough frozen blueberries so added equal amounts of frozen cherries and I would always make it that way!  Served it with Norwegian pancakes, powder  sugar.  I think it might be great on ice cream too!

Super easy and delicious! I always increase cinnamon and add nutmeg in anything with cinnamon (my personal preference) and it tastes great in this recipe as well! My whole family loves this! We use it over ice cream and pancakes. Yum!

I did not use dark brown sugar, used light brown sugar. I've had my delicious blueberry citrus sauce over vanilla frozen yogurt, as a desert sauce and for breakfast with plain greek yogurt so good haven't had it yet over pancakes or waffles. That's for this up coming weekend.

I found it a bit too tart, added 2 tbsps of extra sugar, next time 1 tbsp lemon juice to see if that helps. Great served over cheesecake.

It was pretty good. It tastes a little too much like lemon, though. It was hard to taste the blueberries. Next time I will just add a little bit of lemon at a time instead of all of it at once. Will make again.

I made this as a quick topping for my lemon cheesecake.
The sauce came out great and melded well with the flavor of the cheesecake.

Made this according to the recipe except omitted the zest (didn't have any) and substituted light brown sugar for the dark. Consistency was just right, flavor tasty and a bit tangy. Delicious!

I followed it and loved it. Nice syrup with a slight hint of citrus!

This was very tasty, and my family enjoyed this on top of their pancakes that we shared this morning.  The only thing I did differently was to use half the amount of cinnamon because I kept thinking that I couldn't think of those tastes going together well.  And definitely the next time I'd leave out the cinnamon altogether because it made a rather weird taste for us.  This will be made again!  Thanks, Bri Bri!

Tasty sauce and not too sweet. Consistency is great. I didn't include the lemon zest.

This sauce is wonderful. My husband was concerned that the berries would to too mushy. However the berries held up really well and the lemon flavor was a perfect match to the blueberries. This recipe will be enjoyed for years to come on our family.

I didn't care for it very much because it did not thicken as I would've liked and it was a little too citrus y.

I've made this recipe a few times now. It is delicious, especially on Belgian Waffles.  A nice balance between the blueberries, the citrus flavors of the orange juice, lemon juice and zest, and the cinnamon.  The only alteration I have made is to add a pinch or so of salt to the berry mixture as it comes to a boil.  Doing so enhances all of the other flavors and makes them pop.

Recently I got a heart waffle iron and had a brunch featuring Scandinavian Sweeteheart Waffles from this site.  As I live i Finland I wanted a sauce made with one of the local berries that we pick int he forest, so I tried this one out using blueberries that I had frozen from last year.  This sauce is divine.  Citrusy and with a fill-your-mouth-with-blueberries feel.  I followed someone else's advice and added extra brown sugar and still I think I could have added more, as we ended up combining it with the other topping (maple syrup) to make it sweeter.  This was great, thank you very much for posting such a simple yet delish little treat!  :)

Great recipe, subbed out blueberries and used blackberries.  Added some sugar as my hubby has a huge sweet tooth.  Overall, GREAT and will make it again.  Husband approved!!!

We had an abundance of peaches this year, so I made a peach upside down cake in a cast iron frying pan on a camping trip.  We had just picked a bunch of blueberries, so I whipped up this sauce and served it with the cake and vanilla ice cream.  It was a huge hit!  The sauce has the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  The lemon brightens the blueberry flavour, and the consistency of the sauce was perfect.  It's fast and easy, and the flavours go with a million things.  A real keeper.

This was okay. I didn't care for the orange juice/citrus taste. The next time I make this I will substitute grape juice for the oj and leave out the lemon zest.

I love this recipe.  I made mine with fresh blacberries from a local farm.  We served it over angel food cake with Coconut Sorbet.  VERY Yummy.
