This recipe makes a hugh serving, enough for 2 people. I poured it into a measuring cup and I ended up with almost 3 cups, 22 oz to be exact. With so many flavors going on, I am surprised that only the banana came through. The pineapple and coconut were lost. I thought it was just ok, not something I would make again. Thank you for the recipe.
