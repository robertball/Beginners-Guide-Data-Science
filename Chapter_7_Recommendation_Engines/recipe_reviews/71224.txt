We really didn't enjoy this recipe.  It was edible, but none of the flavors were really interesting.  I regret adding the ground beef in with the vegetables and then adding the rest of the ingredients; perhaps I should have browned the beef in a separate pan, drained, and then added it to the soup.  As it was it was way too fatty.  We won't make this again.

As the author of this dish, the fish sauce is supposed to be optional in place of salt for more of an asian flavor.  I guess that got lost in allrecipe's editing.  Anyway, feel free to add your favorite vegetables to the basic stew.  I find that parboiling the potatoes first in a separate pot, then adding them near the end, prevents them from soaking up all the salt.

I didn't really care for this. It's pretty salty, and yes, not draining the ground beef makes it a bit fatty. I added cilantro because I had it on hand, but I don't think it made much difference.

I made it as written except I used canned tomatoes and cooked the ground beef seperately.  I served it over rice.  The family loved it.

Very good and very easy to prepare.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and 3 beef bouillion cubes.  Left out the fish sauce because I didn't have any on hand.

I thought this was a really good base recipe. I didn't have any fish sauce so I substituted with some chili powder. We like our food spicy anyway. I also added some celery because I had some to use up. I just threw everything in a pot and let it simmer. Really simple and really easy to clean up.

I gave this a 5 star for its simplicity and ease.  It's also different from the other stews because of the addition of the fish sauce.  It gives it a bolder flavor.  Be careful with it though...if you're not used to it, it might be a bit much.  So cut it down to just about 1 tbsp.  It is definitely meant to be eaten with rice.  And don't use ground beef with more than 15% fat otherwise it'll be too greasy.  Thank you for the recipe.  My boys loved it!

Delish! This is a wonderful soup! I made a few changes.. added two tomatoes instead of one, and a small chunk of ginger. I also cut the amount of fish sauce to 1 tbs. Its very tasty and wonderful over rice.

I used tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes. I also added some cumin and a teaspoon of Italian salad dressing and I added egg noodles instead of making rice. it was a one pot delicious meal. I used some grated parmesan cheese for flavor,  I served homemade garlic bread with it. Yum. I also increased the water to about 8 cups because I added the noodles to the soup, not on the side.

Loved it. Originally held back on the fish sauce. After a final tasting, added more fish sauce. Also added Thai peppers. Love a little spice. Will make this again.

I just couldn't bring my pregnant self to use the fish sauce. I bought it, I opened it but then I smelled it and I couldn't do it. Not for me. Obviously, I have never used this before and it was a bit of an adventure but without the fish sauce and with an extra couple of potatoes, it was a decent tasting stew.

Very delicious!  We don't like fish, so I left out the fish oil.  I did add 2 dashes of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce as it was a little bland when I did the taste test before serving.
