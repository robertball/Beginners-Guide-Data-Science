I made this with corned venison that we canned this year, which is also on allrecipes.com, I also added buttered bread crumbs.

We used left over corned beef from St. Patrick's day. It was nothing special. The noodles overwhelmed the rest of the dish. My wife thought it should have been covered - the noodles on top got quite crispy.

My husband loved this.  I made a few tweaks, of course.  I layered the ingredients: sauerkraut, corned beef, homemade Thousand Island dressing (about 2/3 cup), sliced cheese, egg noodles, buttered panko crumbs.  Next time I'll get rye or pumpernickel to make crumbs.
This was a great use of leftover corned beef!

Tastes like a reuben, but needed something extra. Something with some crunch, maybe.

Great flavor & easy to assemble, but could stand to be creamier. Might add some milk next time.

This has become a favorite recipe for my 2 year old daughter as well as all our family and friends. Anyone who has tried it has taken the recipe home.
