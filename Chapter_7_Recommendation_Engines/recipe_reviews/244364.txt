This was really good! I was looking for something to use up brown bananas and an extra box of cake mix I had on hand. I didn't want to make just regular banana bread again and this was perfect. I made it as directed but poured it into a bread pan and baked it longer. It was more brownie texture than cake texture,  tasted delicious. Sweet enough it didn't even need frosting and my kids loved it.

It was easy to make and it was moist but I just did not care for the taste  not sure why. I donâ€™t think I would make it again . Just for information purposes I did follow the instructions exactly.

Taste was great! Texture and presentation? Not so much. I think it needs the eggs. I did it in a bundt pan and it looked good when it came out of the oven, but had deflated down to about an inch within 20 min. The inside was too soft and gooey. Husband said "who cares what it looks like? It tastes good!" LOL - typical.  Was easy though.

I always use thawed out frozen bananas,  which have this glorious juice I use to substitute for any liquid in the recipe.   Didn't have to worth this one.  Wow.  It was awesome.  So moist. It's a favorite now.

It was easy to make with very few ingredients which I like very much, also very tasty. Quite flat ten minutes after coming out of the oven, and a little mushy inside but still was very much liked by everyone.
