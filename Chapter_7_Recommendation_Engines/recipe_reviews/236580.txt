This was an excellent pesto!  Some folks might not be aware that a true pesto is an herb flavored sauce, however, since "basil" pesto became so popular first, it is commonly assumed to be the only "true" pesto.  HTH!

LOVE THIS! I didn't have the artichokes but I will make sure I have them for next time. I did have a little difficulty blending everything in the blender but a splash of evoo fixed that issue. I used this to top potato pancakes and that was wonderful. This has a great light fresh flavor that I really REALLY enjoyed...This is a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

Wonderful sauce but a bit misleading calling it "pesto". As pesto is a sauce made with basil pine nuts and olive oil.

I used marinated artichoke equal amount of cilantro and basil and substituted whipping cream for cream cheese. It was the best pesto ever!

Good in its own right but not what I expected. With cilantro onions & jalape√±o I expected a bit more zing. Also tried Amy's creamy cilantro on this site & preferred it as side dressing for chicken.

Used 1/2 cup cream cheese no artichokes added a bit of EVOO. Makes more than a cup of sauce. Made it for a cold shrimp dipping sauce. This will be a nice creamy dressing for a future salad.
