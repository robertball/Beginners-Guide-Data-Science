This was well received with the Sunday football crowd.  I didn't use the bean sprouts as they are nearly impossible to find around here these days.  (Something about re-calls etc...)  Oh well, it was great without them.  I guess I could have added some shredded romaine.  Thanks for a very pretty dip.

So easy to make and so good!  Can't get bean sprouts, so added lettuce instead.  The first two layers just make it!! I will definitely make this again and again!

I have made this a couple of times with great success! I use guacamole & add tomatoes, yellow peppers & green chiles to the layers & extra cheese!! So very delicious!

I made this for an appetizer potluck.  It was delicious. The only changes I made were to add some spices to the refried bean/avocado mix (cumin, chili powder) and instead of bean sprouts on top I used sliced black olives. I didn’t have any bean sprouts. The avocado in the beans was delicious.

I made this for a recent gathering, and it was a hit! The dip was completely finished by the end of the evening. The only alteration I made was using the entire package of the seasoning, because I didn’t realize until it was too late that I should have only used half.
