Easy!  I actually skipped the chicken as I didn't have any, but I added some cranberries, walnuts and grapefruit.  It was great.

Excellent!  I only had two avocado's and it still came out wonderful.  I agree with another reviewer, the cilantro makes it!  It was great the next day on top of mahi mahi taco's we made.  Great recipe.

This one was different. I can't say I didn't like it, but my husband and I agreed that it wasn't our favorite. I may try this one again b/c I didn't have white balsamic vinegar.

Three avocados may be too many--or perhaps the ones I used were too big.  A little too much, either way, but it was delicious on a fresh loaf of rosemary bread.

This recipe is a hidden gem!  We were looking for a quick, healthy dinner.  I normally don't like chicken salad but the avocado made all the difference.  It totally rocked.  We will be making this again.

Delicious salad.  Sherri's photo inspired me.  I added some sliced tomato and served it over some Spring Mix Greens.  It was easy and so yummy!

Sorry but I just didn't like this one... which is especially strange because I enjoy chicken and i enjoy avacado. I guess it was the texture more than anything else, it just kinda felt like I was eating baby food :(

Chicken and avocado are one of those match-made-in-heaven food combinations. One of my favorite salad combos for them is to add chopped scallions (green parts only), baby peas (bought frozen, then nuked and shocked in cold water, and drained), and some diced fresh jalapenos, plus blue cheese salad dressing. For a more substantial meal, I'll use the same ingredients and just add either cooked macaroni that's been rinsed in cold water and drained (for a macaroni salad), or cooked white rice (for a warm rice salad). Some sliced black olives can't hurt, either. For these starchier salads, the blue cheese dressing can be stretched with mayonnaise. Or I substitute a regular macaroni salad dressing made from: 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup cider or rice vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. sugar, all whisked together. But never make more avocado salad than you'll eat. Avocados won't keep!

The salad was a great addition to the regular meal or in other words it made the meal a hit with the wife. She is requesting it again. That doesn't happen unless she really likes it. IT WAS GREAT!!! Will make it a part of our  monthly rotation.

Added bacon as one reviewer suggested, and used an apricot balsamic (white) to make a simple vinaigrette.  Served on spring mix. Outstanding!

This recipe is wonderful!  We added some celery for crunch and a few fresh tomatoes as garnish, served in a lettuce cup. A great summer recipe or for those on a low sodium diet.

Easy, light & very good. We tried in a wrap as others suggested, but next time we'll do as a salad. We did add tomatoes & a little cheese.  For those hot summer days coming, this will be a good choice for a meal.
10/27/2018 update: We've had this several times in wraps which is good, but today we did again as a salad & used sweet red peppers & that was really great. It really brought the flavors together nicely.

This was ok. I don't plan to make it again. I have to agree with another reviewer that the avocado's texture changes. It is slimey and not enjoyable to eat.

I substituted turkey breast (since that was what was available at the cooked meats section of the store) and it was delicious! Simple and quick, and satisfyingly flavorful!

This was good, but when I make it in the future I will make a couple of changes.  First, I think the ratio of avocado to chicken was heavy on the avocado.  I love avocado, but I think 2 would have been more than enough with only one pound of chicken.  Also, the red onion flavor was to strong with the avocado and chicken.  Next time I will use a yellow onion to balance out the flavors.

Great recipe as written & as a base for other add ins. Wonderful on flat bread sandwich. Second time I made this, I omitted the chicken & added in tomatoes, cucumbers, & put it on pita with deli lemon pepper turkey breast. Versatile component for creative sandwiches (great way to sneak those veggies into your child's meal!) I also love that dressings can be changed up to give a different taste to it dish -texmex, Italian, ranch- the possibilities are endless, limited only by the imagination & daring do of the cook. Cubed turkey or chicken or, even Genoa salami/pepperoni(kids would love it)! from the deli would be a great way to have proteins on hand to add in. I can see this as a great whole meal summer dish with a fruit dish for a simple dessert. Love this! Infinite possibilities!

This is a tasty, delicious and easy to make salad. I did add pico de gallo, almonds and dried cranberries, which enhanced the taste. I'm adding this to my recipe collection.

This was so good.  I added some shrimp to half the recipe and left out the cilantro as I don't care for it.  Served it on pumpernickel toast points.  Will  definitely make this again!

The Chicken Avocado Salad was soooo good. This is a salad I can eat all day every day. To change up from the chicken try shrimp also.

Made exactly according to recipe and it made a really nice wrap (for me) and salad (for my wife).
We used a little extra of the chopped cilantro and red onion and mixed with three  diced mangoes and juice of one lime for a nice, healthy salad.

I confess I haven't tried this recipe yet (though it looks absolutely delicious), but I have to say that in Chile, the most popular lunch sandwich made by  convenience stores that turn into cafes at lunch time is called "ave con palta," which is a peculiarly Chilean way of saying fowl (chicken) with avocado. Together the two foods yield a synergy much greater than the sum of the sandwich. So I have tried the sandwich, found it incredibly delicious, and am looking forward to making this salad.

This is a great lunch time salad but I needed more quantity w/out the calories so I added butter lettuce and chopped romaine hearts.  I didn't give it five stars b/c I thought the purple onion was so strong it took away from the other flavors.  I will omit next time.

This was  fast and easy to assemble, which is what I appreciate in recipes.  I think this recipe lends itself to a of options, depending on a person's likes.  I left out the cilantro (don't like it) but added chopped red pepper, red grapes and some walnuts.  I didn't have the dressing called for, so I used my favorite:  Paul Newman's Light Honey Mustard Dressing.  Wow!  This was my dinner and I will definitely make it again.
