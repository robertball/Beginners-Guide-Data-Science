This was an easy recipe.  Thanks. The taste, however,  was rather bland. Perhaps an overnight marinade would have enhanced the flavor.  I love tofu and its versatility.  I will try it again using another reviewer's suggestions.

I marinated mine overnight in ginger,orange juice and soy sauce. Then dried the tofu and coated with corn starch before frying. Then dip in sweet and sour sauce.

Very easy to make.
My only change would be to dry the tofu for longer. It's still going to have a lot of moisture after only 20 minutes. I usually go 40-60 minutes. The texture is great. Definitely needs to be paired with a good dipping sauce. Great recipe! Thank you!

I fried garlic cloves in the oil, removed them bore burning, then added the tofu pieces. Excellent way to get protein into the littles!

So good. I wanted to recreate the fried tofu I used to order from this restaurant in my home town. I made a really simple sauce with honey and garlic and soy sauce and served with udon.

Exactly like when I had tofu for the first time. Over 20+ years ago. Will definitely make this again. I just topped the tofu with salsa verde for additional flavor, but ate quite a few pieces on their own. Delicious.
