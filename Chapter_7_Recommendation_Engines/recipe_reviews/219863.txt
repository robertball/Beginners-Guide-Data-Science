Instead of this brand's "butter spread", I used melted margerine. I also used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I made muffins from this recipe, I got 9 muffins that were a little on the bigger side. 350* for 20 minutes was just right for me. This turned out well for me, no complaints. All of them were gone by 7 this morning.

I am using your recipe, however, swapping your Melt butter stuff out for regular butter. I am going to cook it at 375 in a standard loaf pan. You are missing a few details in your directions.

Pretty good banana bread recipe. It's good if you don't have an exorbitant amount of browning bananas sitting around. I made my usual adjustments: half a stick of butter (4Tbs) v 5 and a third Tbs; 1/2 c sugar v 1/3; added 1tsp vanilla extract. Came out very sweet with the chocolate chips (I am a fan of semi-sweet myself)
