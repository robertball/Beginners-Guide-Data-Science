I served this new recipe to a bunch of our friends at a BBQ this summer and it was a giant hit.  The ingredients were different but blended so well and kept the chicken very moist and tender, thanks!!

WOW!!! Thats' what everyone commented on this recipe. Only thing I changed was less habenaro, and more rum. Also, I marinated them for 3 days before throwing them on the grill

Tasted just like Jamaican jerk chicken.  When I made mine, I added less habenero than was called for and it was still plenty spicy.  I think the full amount would be too much.

I added some coconut cream to this recipe and it was delicious - a real taste of the Carribean!

I don't know what went wrong with this but it didn't turn out good at all. The only change I made was to use one pepper out of personal preference. In doing so I cut the molasses back. Using both onion and green onions seemed like overkill and I love onions. The onions really were not the problem though. Something happened in the fridge overnight. Instead of the alcohol and other ingredients tenderizing the chicken, it became tough once grilled and no it wasn't overcooked. The flavor might have been okay but the texture was bad. Sorry but I won't ever try this again.

I don't think I've ever left a recipe review, but this is a must.  Is there a way to give it zero stars??  It's hard to mess up chicken.  It's hard to mess up chicken marinade.  Really hard.  This thoroughly succeeds.  I make wonderful jerk chicken (some similar ingredients / flavor profile) with my time-tested recipe, and I thought this would be a variation of sorts, lending a little variety.  It was AWFUL!  One of my 6 kids said it was "ok".  The rest of us wouldn't even eat it.  We like rum, and I used a fraction of what the recipe called for because I knew that could be a strong component.  It was all you could taste.  We love the ginger, lime, hot pepper, green onion, spice combo - not our first time around the marinade block - the only ingredients in question here were the molasses (which we like) and the rum (which I cut way down).  For whatever reason, it was horrible.  If you care about chicken, if you care about your family ... for love of marinade ... run for your life!
