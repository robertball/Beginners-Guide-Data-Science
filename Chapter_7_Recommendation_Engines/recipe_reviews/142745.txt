I made this for dinner with salmon and rice.  I thinned the soup down a bit with some water.  That seeemed to help make it easier to spread over the cheese.  I thought the flavors were a little strong.  I stirred my rice into the casserole and thought it was much better.  I will make this again using the rice.

My family gave this a "thumbs down". To much cheese, couldn't taste the asparagus, which happens to be a favorite veggie in my house.

This casserole dish was absolutely delicious!  I made it for a group of 3 friends, and they all had seconds and thirds, and demanded that I make it again soon lol.  The only difference that I made with this recipe is that I felt that it needed a topping on it, so I crumbled up Cheez-Its and sprinkled them over the top before baking it again for five more minutes.  It gave the liquidy casserole a bit more substance to it.  Excellent recipe, will definitely be making it again!

This dish was SO simple to make. I didn't have enough asparagus, so I added mushroom and green beans. I also try to avoid any kind of fried food, so I traded the onion rings for rye bread crumbs. The green beans gave it a lovely crunch and the rye bread crumbs gave it a great aftertaste. I'll definitely be making it again.

This was just cheesy, soupy mess (and we love cheese.)  Could not taste the asparagus.

Glad I had this one saved. Made it last year for Easter dinner and got a last minute request for it this year.  I do cut back on the cheese (I also just use a shredded bag of mixed Italian cheeses) a bit and add a splash or two of milk to thin out the soup to make it easier to spread. Great alternative to the ever popular green bean casserole and a nice way to bring asparagus to dinner that is familiar taste to so many.

Very good, but wish i would have used thinner stalked asparagus, as the thicker ones stayed crunchy. I will do that next time.

Canned asparagus works better. The raw asparagus was stringy and tough due to not getting done enough.

I made this asparagus casserole and followed the recipe.  The taste was good, but it was too runny for our liking.

will definitely make again. My family loved the Provolone cheese in this dish.. So cheesy. The golden mushroom soup gives it a little something extra.
