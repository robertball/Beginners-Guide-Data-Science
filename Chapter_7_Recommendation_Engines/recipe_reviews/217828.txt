Wow - What a fabulous recipe! I mean a dessert just doesn't get any easier or any tastier than this! Definitely not for those counting calories...although I'm sure it could be lightened up a bit if you wanted to! I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I also had to sub Sprite for the Mountain Dew as I didn't have any on hand. These baked up beautifully and made the house smell wonderful. They were perfect with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream and the side -YUM!

I've been making this recipe since I first learned when I was a kid. I always use brown sugar and I wisk in the cinnamon and a little nutmeg in with the brown sugar. This is really awesome with cinnamon ice cream or fresh whipped cream. GREAT white trash party offering. EDITED REVIEW: I made this the other day using reduced fat crescent roll, half the amount of butter, half the amount of brown sugar Splenda in place of the sugar and Diet Canada Dry. Even using the lower fat ingredients, this was still freaking awesome. I ate one portion, the boys literally ate the rest in 15 minutes. My husband even remarked that it's better than it usually is!

This is an amazing dessert.  I do not cook the sugar mixture & use 2 large apples.  Also I use lower fat crescent rolls, Splenda for the sugar & sugar-free Mountain Dew.  No one can tell the difference.  I get requests to bring this to potluck all the time.

Very simple and easy to make. I am not certain if I didn't read the reviews in their entirety but didn't know this: REMOVE DUMPLINGS FROM PAN WHILE HOT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKING OUT OF THE OVEN. Once cooled, the sugar and soda caramelizes and it is extremely difficult to remove dumplings. Also, add sugar and cinnamon to apples too for added flavor. I paired this with butter pecan ice cream and my significant other loved it. Will make again for those I love!

My husband has been making these for years...another recipe on this site called Country Apple Dumplings. Only difference is this one calls for vanilla extract, which he added any ways.
Regardless, a family favourite. Yum

Delicious and so easy! I use 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup sugar and diet Dew.  Still wonderful. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

Every year we go to a nearby apple orchard and pick apples with our kids.  We got a whole bushel of apples this year and after we got them home, we realized it was a lot more than it looked like at the orchard! I made these yesterday and they are soooo good! I have shared the recipe with my husband's Aunt and I am making some more for my husband AND my in-laws today!!

So easy, so delicious, quickly became a family favorite. I had my 15 yo daughter make them with these changes, Gala apples(what we had on hand)Sunkist orange soda, (also what we had on hand)and brown in stead of white sugar. I love recipes that adapt well, and will use this one over and over. TY!

After our annual trip to the apple orchard today I made this recipe with the help of my mother, mother-in-law and husband.  We all agreed that it deserves more than 5-stars for it taste and simplicity.  Thank you for posting, Kathy!

Easy and good. Also I substituted carbonated water (berry flavor) for the soda, and it was plenty sweet.

These were so easy and yummy! I used a can of cream soda instead of the Mountain Dew. We served it warm with whipped cream. They were eaten up so fast, the pan was still warm and they were GONE!

I've made this recipe many times. It's fast, easy and delicious, and always gets rave reviews, what more could you ask from a dessert (okay dumplings aren'r by nature pretty but that taste . . . ).

Personally, I've never tried it with apples.  Instead, I've swapped in peaches ... many of peaches, and called it a "cobbler".
Swap in peaches in place of the apples, then further place peaches between each "dumpling" and along the edges of the pan as well.  This usually takes 2 large cans of peaches to pull off.

End result is a peach cobbler that has turned me away from even thinking about getting a frozen store one ever again.

I just made this for the first time and my family loved it!  The only apples I had were Gala, they were perfect for this recipe.  My family decided that we have a new holiday dessert.  Thank you for sharing such a fun, delicious, easy to prepare recipe!

This recipe was amazingly simple and easy to make. Unfortunately, I didn't have a can of soda or citrus-anything. I used 12 oz. of apple cider and it was absolutely delicious. I will be making this for another dessert option at T'Giving. Kudos to the inventor of this recipe.

Wow! I found this recipe after reviewing grandmas apple dumplings with my changes and found this recipe followed my way almost exactly!
Grandmas used 2 sticks butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar which I lowered to 1 stick butter and 1 cup sugar! Perfect!
I used ginger ale as that was on hand, but will do the Dew next! Use less butter too! (and way more cinnamon!)
Thanks!

I LOVE these dumplings.  They are so quick and easy to make, and as others posted, make the home smell wonderful.  I got this recipe from my cousin except there were a few differences.
2 sticks of butter. Melt butter, sugar, and vanilla. 2 large apples instead of 4 small ones. Spray pan instead of greasing it. I used 1 Granny Smith Apple and 1 Pink Lady Apple. I've used Sprite and 7-Up.  Either one is OK to use.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar and nutmeg over the prepared dumplings. Next time, I will add the brown sugar and nutmeg to the sugar, butter and vanilla while it's cooking.
Another reviewer said her dumplings were hard to remove from the pan if you didn't remove them right away after baking.  I've made them twice in the past 2 weeks, once for home, and once for work (E-mailing the recipe to co-workers now.), and I didn't have a problem with them sticking to the pan.  Of course, my pan was sprayed, and it was glass.

I've made these twice so far, they're wonderful! You can cut down the calories by using a non calorie sweetener, reduced fat rolls, and zero calorie flavored sparkling water.

The recipe should read "carbonated", not caffeinated can of clear citrus flavored soda. The caffeine is not a necessary ingredient and does not do anything. I used 7-Up, but you could use Sprite, Fresca or whatever clear soda you prefer. I also used large apples instead of small and increased butter to 1 cup and used Splenda instead of white sugar to reduce calories.  WONDERFUL!

OMG, so good!! I took some advice from others and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on the apples before wrapping them, used diet Mt. Dew and only used about 1/2 cup of it. DEEELISH! Even had the kids help make them and they loved it. I also used the grand size cresent rolls and just cut them in half instead of using 2 full cans.  Will definitely keep this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I made this with my left over crescent roll dough from my potpie. My husband loved it expecially when it is warm with vanilla ice cream.  Now I am making more with the entire pkg of crescent roll dough.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. It came out perfect. I used three apples instead of four, but using an apple corer I was able to have plenty of apple for each crescent roll. I used the exact amount of sugar , butter and vanilla. and I used a bottle of squirt. It was perfect. The very top of the dumpling gets a nice little crunch to it and the inside is a nice tender apple with just the perfect kind of sweetness. I did Think that maybe next time I might sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top to give it a little more of a sweet crunch but you absolutely don’t have to do anything to this other than maybe next time have some vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on hand.

I have made this many times and everyone loves it. I tweaked it just a bit by sprinkling cinnamon on the apples before I roll it up in the dough and also using some brown sugar too. I also drizzle caramel syrup over dumplings as soon as they come out of the oven and then yes definitely serve with ice cream.

This was such a huge hit in my family.  Made it for extended family as well and they LOVED it.  My husband said it was better than apple pie, but do NOT serve without ice cream.

Very tasty. I forgot the vanilla, but made up for it by serving dumplings with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. i thought the crusts were a bit soggy. I think next time i will try pie crust cut into 8th's.

Easy to make and everyone loved them! I used half white and half brown sugar as suggested by others and tossed the apple pieces with a bit of the sugar and cinnamon mixture before wrapping them in the dough. Also added a pinch of nutmeg. Served with vanilla ice cream. I also cut up two extra apples, tossed in the sugar mixture and placed them in the dish to cook with the dumplings. It was really good!

This is fantastic.  It sounded so weird I thought it would never be crispy!  I did not have crescent rolls so I made my own pie dough.  I think I will stick to using my own dough.  I think next time I am going to try to cut down on the amount of sugar.  Also I think it is easier to take a small walnut size of dough.  Roll out and wrap apple in.  This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

These were very good! I used 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar.  I also tossed the cut up apples in cinnamon and sugar and added some nutmeg like suggested by another review.  I also added the soda around the pan and not on top. I will definitely make these again.

Loved this recipe...super easy to make. After reading some reviews took advice and used some brown sugar and the rolled the apples in it before rolling the apples. Definitely will be making again and hubby said it was a keeper.

I  found this recipe somewhere else originally and though it sounded weird, tried it with fresh plums and diet lemon lime soda.  I only made a half a batch with one can of crescent rolls.  The two of us practically finished the entire pan!  I also baked it on convection mode.  And a dollop of sour cream on top, cut the sweetness and was a nice addition.  OK, I was out of ice cream - drat!

This recipe is my favorite.  I did add a couple of shakes of cinnamon and a tablespoon of brown sugar to the apples before rolling them in the crescent rolls.   This apple dumplings goes great with vanilla ice cream.  My family loves it.  I love that it is very easy to make and taste great.

I used gala apples and gingerale instead because i cannot stand Mt. Dew and they where yummy.
So easy to make, it only takes about 10 minutes to put it all together then pop it into oven and just wait...i had it with vanilla icecream.
Thanks for sharing this.

I cut this recipe in half because it's just the two of us at home. I also used half white sugar, half brown sugar per previous reviewers suggestions. We had orange soda in the house, so that's what I used. It was still delicious. (I would assume any citrus carbonated bevarage will work.) We paired with vanilla ice cream. I would definitely make this again, perfect for guests, as even halving the recipe resulted in a large quantity.

This is better than previous recipe--less butter, and the addition of vanilla is great. I want to lesson the sugar next time. I always have to send extra with my husband s lunch--they get grabbed up so quickly!

This recipe is THE BOMB!  We make these for our church community meal and our "customers" feel that these are such a treat.  They're so easy to make and the taste is amazing!

I tried this recipe a few days ago and it came out perfect!  I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the sugar and butter mixture.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and sugar to each apple slice before rolling in the crescent roll and they were delicious!  I served them with French Vanilla Ice Cream and my family loved them.

Delicious--use Sierra Mist instead of Mt.Dew, much healthier for teeth and a lot less sugar content and added calories.

Unbelievably easy, fast and DELICIOUS!
I have served them with a scoop of Low Fat Cool Whip. 
I will invite guests to impress them with this piece of heaven made by me!

I followed the exact recipe when I made these. They turned out perfect. I will never again make the dough from scratch. These were so easy to make that my 10 year old did most of the work!

We don't heat the mixture, just combine and pour it over.  Oh, also, we call them 'Dew Dumplins'.
