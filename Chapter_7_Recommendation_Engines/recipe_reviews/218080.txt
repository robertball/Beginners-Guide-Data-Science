So good my husband couldn't get off the foot of the stairs because he was so full. I did make some minor alterations. First, I grilled the ham and tomatoes. Then, I layered the pork chops with mozzarella cheese, slice of ham, shredded gouda, grilled tomatoes, then garnished with a mixture of salt, pepper, chopped oregano, and chopped parsley. Excellent and well worth every bite! Served with Grilled Green Bean Bundles and Southern as You Can Get Collard Greens.

Easy to make, but nothing special. Nothing to entice the taste buds. I think ham is the wrong choice, maybe bacon or a spicy capricola.

Sounds good, but cooking the pork to 160 isd to much, pork needs to be cooked till 145 degrees.

This was amazing! I was really worried that the cheese and Italian seasonings wouldnt pair well with the pork but I was wrong. I didn't make this with tomatoes simply because I didnt have any but I will try it next time. I paired this with alfredo pasta and garlic toast. DELISH!

Wow, when I first saw this recipe I was definitely looking forward to trying it.  I have to say that this recipe was a hit in my house.  Everyone loved it even my son who is a very picky eater.  He even ate the tomatoes that were on it and he hates tomatoes.  This will definitely be made again and again.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was excellent.  Very easy to make.  I changed the regular ham to Italian Hot Ham "Capocollo" and OMG that was so good, it smelled excellent while grilling and all the flavors just blended so well.  This is a keeper for sure :)

This recipe has a lot of potential...Next time I will do a garlic butter injection and use fresh basil. I think oregano does better on italian cuisine...thanks! :)

Really easy to make and easily customizable for your tastebuds.  My husband is lactose intolerant so I opted to use Swiss cheese for half of the batch.  I used Italian seasonings instead of just the oregano on both sides of the pork chop and I baked it instead (I don't have a grill right now).  Salt was only added to the one side after I had laid it on the baking sheet.

So simple yet delicious (even with Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella).  It really did only take 10 minutes to prep it.

So my boyfriend like plain pork chops.  I made these and he's a changed man!  We had my daughter and 2 son-in-laws over and they all loved it.  Wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  Perfect and it gave the boyfriend the thrill of grillin!

I made this in the oven. I seared them first. About 2 minutes in each side. Weren't very think. Then I put the tomatoes on the pan just a little to make warm. Place them on the hot chop. Sprinkle cheese. Broiled it. Didn't use ham. In total it was just a few minutes. In the beginning I rinsed the chops, dried them, then seasoned them. Then searing. My partner and I Loved it!

Amazing! The only thing I did differently was to use proscuitto instead of ham, since it's an Italian dish! Will absolutely make again!

I turned this recipe into stuffed Italian pork chops. I started with three-quarter inch butterflied chops that I had intended to stuff and bake but decided to use this recipe instead. I took oversized, deli slices of ham that were on the thick side, topped those with grated mozzarella cheese, oregano and basil. Then I rolled the cheese inside the ham like a burrito. Then put the stuffed ham rolls inside the butterflied chops, sealed them with tooth picks and grilled them as per the directions. In the end, I put a little more mozzarella cheese, the slices of tomato and some additional oregano and basil on top and heated for an additional minute to melt the cheese. We thought it came out great.

Nothing special, but easy. I ex'd the ham and used a balsamic vinegarette glaze, which made it pop as desired.

made this today exactly as described. Both my husband and i really liked the recipe. my chops were about 1/2" thick. I sliced a good quality ham thinly. Used fresh mozzarella and firm fresh tomato. I think in the future, I would place the ham, mozzarella and tomato on the chop for last 3 minutes of cooking.the chops instead of an additional 2 minutes of cooking. I found that I lost grill heat from having to place the ham, mozzarella and tomatoes, it didn't have enough time to warm up. I didn't want to add additional cooking time and risk drying out the chop. Also, I would assemble the ham, mozzarella and tomatoes before opening the grill; then just pop the assembly onto the chop. very good recipe though. will definitely make this again.

It was good and easy.  I substituted a couple of Hot Coppa slices for Ham, added Italian Seasoning and olive oil on the thick loin chops with the salt and pepper.  I did add the Coppa, fresh moz, and romas 3/4 of the way through cooking the 2nd side so everything was done and the meat wasn't overcooked.

I liked it but omitted the ham, I thought the chop was plenty. Bought chips from Costco and cut them in half because they are rather thick. Did like recipe but put in broiler to melt the cheese so the chops did not dry out. Great quick dinner!!

Make sure all of the topping are ready to go.  Otherwise pork will be over done.  Used dried oregano.

The best part of this recipe was how simple and quick it was. I used fresh basil and fresh mozzarella because that is what I had on hand at the time and everyone liked it!

I have a big family so I tripled the recipe. I used prosciutto instead of regular ham. It was awesome. Definitely a recipe I will make again!

made some alterations and it was great! No ham and roasted the tomatoes... also marinated in Italian salad dressing.
