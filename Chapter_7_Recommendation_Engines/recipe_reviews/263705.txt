11.27.19  What a lovely soup.  I scaled this down to two servings and made this for lunch today, but I think a cup of this would be an elegant starter for a fancy company (or family) dinner.  The caramelized onions were so incredibly sweet that I’ll probably reduce the amount of sugar in the future (could be personal taste preference).  The combination of caramelized onions and the brussels sprouts share equally in producing a complex, but balanced flavor profile.   A crumbled bacon garnish might be nice on this soup. I really think even brussels sprouts haters would enjoy this (just don't tell them what they're eating).  carenough2, thanks for sharing your recipe, this one’s a keeper.

I usually don’t give low ratings but this one just didn’t work for me. I went by the recipe and found it very bland. It didn’t Specify what kind of onion so I went with white.
