The cuke salads that I've had usually have more tang than this one.  But, honestly,  I'm really not familiar with how Hungarian cucumber salad should taste...this could be spot on.  IMO still thought it was a little bland, but probably just because it wasn't what I was expecting.

This recipe is very similar to the one I learned from my mum. I used apple cider vinegar and a mix of chopped fresh and dried dill. I seasoned with salt and pepper when I added the vinegar and dill. My mum would salt the cucumber and onions first and let them sit in a sieve for about 15-30 minutes then squeeze out the excess water before transferring to a serving bowl and adding the dressing. Doing it the way it says in the recipe just cuts about a half hour of prep time, the result is the same. Yummy!
To give the salad a bit more colour I also added a bit of thinly sliced red bell pepper.  
Another option is to also add some cherry tomatoes, crumbled feta cheese and kalamata olives. The salad goes from Hungarian to Greek!

Precisely what I was looking for! I had this type of salad in the Czech Republic and fell in love. I've tried many recipes, but this is the one that comes closest to what I remember. I think the oil is the trick!

This was tasty. I made a half a recipe and got about 4 servings. I used a sweet onion, but cut the amount in half. I also halved the salt and pepper and just sprinkled additional salt to taste. I took the pic. and realized I forgot to add the dill. I just added 2 pinches of dry for half the recipe. It improved the flavor. For some reason, this salad tasted like non tart pickle slices. It tastes great cold and just made, but like most salads with salt I didn't care for it after it sat. I would definitely make it right before serving.

Made this for an office picnic as I was intrigued with this oil and vinegar recipe. I made a large batch so served it to my family first. I thought it "meh" but my husband really liked it. Both of us said it needed MORE vinegar as there wasn't much of a zing to it. The overriding flavor was of the dill and I used the amount listed in the recipe. Took it to the picnic the next day and several people complimented me on it. Based on my observations, this recipe has a 50/50 chance of being considered "good" by someone.

this is the cucumber sald that I remember from my childhood! To give it a bit more flavor make one or two of the teaspoons of vinegar blasamic or some other flavored vinegar (preferabley whitish). I prefer less salt as well.

The only changes I made were using cukes from our garden, using a red onion, and using chopped up dried dill, about a tbsp. It was delicious. Perfect balance of flavors.

I've never really been a fan of cucumber salads, but I really do like cucumber. (Normally I put them on a platter as part of the crudites, or slice them in tossed green salad.) But my husband does like cuke salad, and his health demands that he eat a lot more vegetables, so I tried this for dinner this evening. It was a big hit! Son's girlfriend loved the dill, hubby had thirds, and once I found the right balance of salt to vinegar, I had seconds! Well done, and thanks for sharing it!

Great, easy summer side dish!  I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil (taste preference) and used it sparingly.  The first time I made this it did seem a bit too "oily", so maybe start with half and add as you go.  I also used fresh regular cucumbers and half-peeled them in stripes so they weren't too tough.

Changed out white vinegar for Rice vinegar. I'm allergic to apples. It is milder but still wonderful.

I really liked this! I had bought one of those huge Armenian cucumbers at the Farmers Market for making a cucumber salad. We were out of sour cream so I looked for a new recipe. This was very nice and light. I used red wine vinegar and olive oil, dried dill weed, coarse grind black pepper, about half of a red onion. Just a small sprinkle of salt. Yummy!

Love this!  I've made it 5 times already.  Was interested because it doesn't have sugar or sweetener like many cucumber salad recipes.  I made as written the first time (used dried dill).  Since then have increased vinegar to half cup .  I used regular cucumbers once, was still good but the English is better.  I always slice paper thin with a mandolin.  Worth the effort. Right too about tossing in vinegar first.  So good, and right again about letting it mellow for a couple days. The cucumber aroma just makes your mouth water and the taste is just as good. Of course I'm a cucumber fanatic.  This is perfect for me.  Thanks!

Going to sound weird I'm sure but I put this on hotdogs. I dont use as much oil, and I chop thing super fine and cut up everything into quarters. Throw in some banana peppers with mustard and ketchup and its freaken amazing. Crisp, Fresh, and the flavors with and all beef hotdog are great.

This turned out to be a great summer salad.  Using dill instead of sugar that is in some cucumber salad recipes made a large difference.  I prefer using a sweet onion and it went very well in this salad.

My family absolutely loves this salad and it doesn’t have all the sugar that some other cucumber salads have! We cut the oil back a little to make it a little healthier as well! A summer time staple in our fridge!

This tasted light and fresh!  After reading other reviews I added another tablespoon of vinegar (I used 2T of white vinegar and 2T of red wine vinegar). I was expecting more "bite" with the vinegar, but still it was pretty mild. My husband asked if I was going to put Italian dressing on this and I laughed and said "No".  I guess he liked it since he went back for seconds!

I made this salad today, left out the dill because I don't care for it, and the  sugar and salt for dietary reasons and added more vinegar and oil so there was more of the marinade.  My mom used to make this for us when we were kids and we hated it.  Well, Mom, we love it now!  This recipe is almost better than Mom's was.  I will certainly be making it again often because my garden has so many cucumbers I am trying everything to use them all before they go bad!  Highly recommend it!

Just like my Mom used to make.......delicious! I didnt change a thing, with the exception of a couple teaspoons of cold water added after tossing the oil and vinegar in....just for personal taste preference!

This is something I've wanted to make for so long, and finally did!  I found it a bit "blah" as written (but still yummy), so I added more vinegar and some minced garlic.  Next time I will try apple cider vinegar and/or balsamic vinegar to mix it up.

I messed this one up and forgot to add the dill. Even then, it was EXCELLENT! I took it to a BBQ and had leftovers for lunch the next day (still mighty excellent).  I'll definitely make this again and hopefully remember the dill!

Omitted the oil and added 1/2 cup sour cream also used white balsamic vinegar. I did this because my friend loves the sour cream version but there was none with fresh dill which I had already purchased. It came out great! Everyone loved it.

My family loved this cucumber salad.  If you  don't have fresh dill, USE 1/8  cup of DILL WEED  instead of the FRESH DILL. It comes out great. I don't have fresh dill but do have a big crop of cucumbers this year so this works out for me. My husband can't wait to have some even before it's ready. Enjoy it as we do.

Ate this salad a lot growing up in central NJ,  made the same way as directed...BUT if you take out the vinegar and oil and instead use sour cream OR plain yogurt  to taste  it is also cool and refreshing.

This is my new favorite way to serve cucumbers, especially during the summer months.  Note I eliminated the onion as I am not a fan of onions, and the dish still tasted wonderful and refreshing.  Next time, I might (might!) try dried onions.

I did not have fresh dill but used dry dill. I used the same amount of dill. I used olive oil instead of veg oil.

I made it ahead of dinner two hours and let it chill.

Very good.

I added tomatoes to the reside for some more flavor. The flavor was a little dull without the added tomatoes. Still, it's a nice, easy, light salad for those hot summer days.

This is a quick, simple recipe that my family loves. I've made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks and am making it again for a cookout tomorrow. Will double the recipe. So far there's been no leftovers! Great way to use the fresh dill from my garden!

Used an extra tablespoon of vinegar, red onion, dried dill, and regular cucumbers. Like others have said, it's milder and less tangy than would be expected but still good. Depends on your tastes. I will probably look for a recipe with more acidity or modify this one, but it's a good base!

Used half of a really large red onion and that was more than enough, my husband thought it was too much.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable. This had a mild flavor that went well with the Curried Turkey Meatball recipe from this site.  I will make it again.

It's great as a side or a healthy snack during the day. It has quickly become a family favorite, thank you!
