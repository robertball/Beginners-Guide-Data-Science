This was a nice, tomato based vegetable soup. I used a vegetable tomato sauce from AR site instead of the bottled cocktail. It is a hearty soup that will warm you on an early Spring evening. I followed some of the cook's notes and added rice and used water instead of chicken broth. Thank you Jenn Fry Delan for sharing your recipe.

This is a nice, simple vegetable soup. I sprinkled in some Italian seasoning. I think some pasta would be good in it, which is suggested in the Cook's notes. I used summer squash instead of zucchini and left out the cabbage.

Delicious veggie meal. Made it for my vegetarian girlfriend and it was awesome. Served with some grilled cheese, itâ€™s bomb!

Skipped cabbage. Added kale. Used mushroom stock instead of chicken stock. Sauteed onion and zucchini fon high irst to give more body. Used rest of bloody Mary mix bottle as base instead of v8 (blue crab Bay sting Ray). Delicious!

Excellent soup!! I use a 48 oz V8 and omit the 14.5 oz cans of tomato . I like the flavor better this way . Sometimes I add potatoes or beans . Throw in whatever extra veggie you have .
