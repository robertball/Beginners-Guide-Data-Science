Fabulous!  I added 2 stalks of celery, because I had them, some garlic powder, and used an entire can of chicken stock (what I had on hand).  Everyone loved it and there are just enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks!

An awesome and easy family dinner! The chicken was moist and delicious! I recommend only 1 TBS of Rosemary and 1 10 oz package of biscuit dough. We had a ton of dough and the rosemary was a little overpowering for our taste. Otherwise it turned out perfectly cooked!

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! 
I followed the recipe pretty closely, but didn't have a couple specific ingredients! NOT TO WORRY! I took a risk of subbing for similar things and it was AMAZING!
-Didn't have 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom, so I used 1 can CoM, and 1 can Cream of Chicken.
-Didn't have can biscuits, so I subbed in crecent rolls (gently pieced and rolled into dumplings)
-Didn't have veg broth, used chicken stock. 
-I like color, so I added veggies. I also like being lazy, so it was a half bag of frozen mixed. ;)
-Did this recipe call for poultry seasoning? totally forgot poultry seasoning.. lol 

I don't feel I changed much of anything drastically, but this is a recipe one can definitly piece together with whatever you've got!

SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD!

Answer for WENDY....Sorry for late reply(didn't know how to get it out there) Chicken pieces do not have to be cooked first, as a matter of fact I put them in still frozen and they came out great! Let me know what you think after you have made this.

Definitely an easy go to meal to make with  great taste!! I made a few small changes since I only had to cook for 2. Instead of 4 chicken breasts, I used 3 small ones and cut them up into pieces. Also used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken, 1 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 tablespoon of rosemary instead of 2 and only used 1 16oz of premade biscuit dough, added a small bag of mini carrots cut up too. Came out amazing, and the perfect amount for just me & my boyfriend to have 2 bowls full.

I enjoyed this recipe. Next time I am going to cut back on seasoning. Maybe half the amount.

I made this with some additions. I added another can of cream of mushroom soup, more chicken (which I cubed instead of just halved), and a bag of frozen peas and carrots. I cooked it a little longer since I had more in there, but it turned out delicious. I also did my own seasoning: minced garlic, pepper, salt mix, etc. I’m actually thinking of adding diced potatoes next time. It was a great meal and I will definitely do it again!

Ok, let’s try this again... here is what I did: used 6 breast halves, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 1/4 cups onions, 2 stalks chopped celery, about a cup of chopped carrots, 2 tbsp chopped fresh rosemary, 2 tbsp butter, about 1 tspn black pepper and one tspn “yep” seasoning (it’s a mixture of pepper, sea salt, sugar, garlic, onion powder, appliance and other spices). 1 can of biscuit do egg was plenty. I added the biscuit dough about an hour before serving. Cooked on low for 5 1/2 hours. Serve with fresh, hot crescent rolls. Came out great. Served 5 people, with enough for everyone to have seconds.

This was delicious, but I made a few alterations. I didn’t have rosemary, so instead I chucked in extra black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (I never measure seasonings, but I used a heavy hand.) I used frozen chicken breasts, and removed them at the 3:30 mark to dice them into fat morsels. I didn’t have broth, so I used 2 cups of water and two ground up chicken bouillon cubes to cover the chicken. When I removed the chicken, I decided there was too much thin liquid, so I cut in 4 tbsp of corn starch (that would be 2 tbsp for anyone who only added 1 cup of broth.) I let the liquid cook on its own until the 5 hour mark, at which point I put the diced chicken back in and added 1 can of biscuits (cut into 8ths.) It took 70min for the biscuits to cook—they were still quite raw after 30min. Next time, I’ll add some carrots. My husband and I both had seconds, it’s great comfort food and I will probably put this on the rotation for Fall/Winter.

Wow! Simple and delicious! I adjusted the recipe and used one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of chicken, I used chicken broth and only 1 tablespoon of rosemary. I cooked this for 5 hours. At 4 hours, I added frozen green beans, corn, carrots and asparagus as well as added the biscuit and let that cook the remaining hour. The chicken came out perfect! Definitely a winner for me!!!

I added a couple stalks of chopped celery and a can of corn and the family loved it. I also used a biscuit mix instead of canned, but, in a pinch I'm sure canned would be fine. The family loved it. Definitely a keeper.

This is a fairly easy recipe and one I go to when I don't feel like making my Chicken & Dumplings from scratch. The only thing I did to alter this recipe was to add some mushrooms at the beginning and then put in frozen peas about thirty minutes before it's done. Also, instead of getting 2 10oz cans of biscuits, I get a bigger can (it's about 16 oz) and that makes plenty of dumplings. Aside from those changes, this is very tasty.

Very tasty and the aroma while it cooked nearly drove me insane with impatience. I cut the recipe in half and added a stalk of celery. I think when I make this again, I'll add some carrots.

This is a great recipe! Really tasty and super easy. I took the advice of others and only put in 1 tablespoon of rosemary, swapped the vegetable broth for chicken broth, added a bit of garlic powder, and went for onion powder instead of mincing an onion. So, some

I made this as a lunch meal prep for the week. Luckily, the dish reheats well. 

This was SO delicious. I didn't have any rosemary and wasn't going to include it, but i'm so glad I picked some up because it made all the difference. It added an undeniable perfumey, herbal quality to the entire dish that was just right for the creamy chicken and mushroom-flavored sauce. I didn't measure the rosemary, just used one "stalk". Otherwise, I pretty much made as directed.

And the dumplings were so dense, chewy, and delicious. Ah, I'm in love. Overall the dish is really heavy, but it is what it is.

I think chicken thighs would have worked better because the breast dried up a little. But I’m impartial to white meat as it is.

I only had 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom--both healthy request Campbell's. I only had crescent rolls and it took about 1 hr extra to get "dumplings" done. I though it was too salty but my husband said it was fine. It was very simple to make though.

I added slow roasted thighs and breasts, exchanged one can of mushroom for cream of chicken soup and used all chicken broth, no water or other broth.  HUGE hit in my house and its now requested to be added to the meal rotation every other week.

One of my husbands favorite! It's so tasty. I highly recommend this recipe. I don't tear the biscuits though I use them at their full size.

Good recipe!  I highly suggest using 1tbs of rosemary and I used 9 biscuits instead of 10. I used one can of mushroom with roasted garlic and one mix of chicken and mushroom can. I love the taste of this recipe overall!

Biscuits take much longer than 30 minutes. More like 1.5 hours. But once done, it was very tasty and filling. I used chicken broth rather than vegi broth too.

I found 2 tablespoons of rosemary was overkill and the end result was very watery.

I agree with everyone else, too much rosemary. But very good other than that. A great meal to slip in some vegetables.

We all loved this! I also added a little chopped celery and some dry minced onion along with rosemary and poultry seasoning. I didn't have any vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. It was delicious!
