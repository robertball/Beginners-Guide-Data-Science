I made this with one red and one yellow pepper in place of the green pepper and onion because that is what we prefer.  I used Mediterranean Herb hummus which worked well for us.  A side of rice paired nicely. After tasting the finished product, we felt that the chicken would be better with salt and pepper sprinkled on it before coating with the hummus, and that the paprika was overpowering the hummus a bit.  Next time I would decrease the paprika by half.  Overall, I thought this recipe was easy and tasty and used things I normally have in my house.  I really like using hummus in a main dish.

I consistently use AR for ideas and the reviews are invaluable.  Tonight I'm cleaning out the fridge and freezer as my daughter prepares for a major move in two days.  I used this recipe as a launching pad and substituted what she had on hand.   Two leeks and a huge fresh jalapeño instead of the onion and bell pepper....half a container of spicy red pepper hummus from Costco....two chicken breasts and two ground chicken patties.   I marinated the chicken for an hour in the juice of the other lemon half, along with sriracha, cumin, salt and pepper....and then quickly seared it.  I baked at 450 according to directions and then sprinkled with toasted chopped macadamia nuts.  It was absolutely delicious served with brown rice and yogurt-cumin roasted cauliflower.   A gourmet meal from odds and ends!   Thank you, submitter of this recipe, for a great idea and for graciously allowing me to post modifications.   --Cooking with love

I cooked it on the stovetop and added green olives.  I used 20 oz chicken breast tenderloins and an entire container of hummus.  It was very good, but I think 1/2 cup of hummus isn't enough.

Added fresh garlic & feta on top of the chicken breast, forgot the lemon juice & just sprinkled a little paprika on top. Delicious!  Only 30 minutes to bake for me. Served with brown rice and everyone loved it.
Made again with black bean hummus (recipe on site) and everyone liked it even more!

Wasn't bad but as I do with almost all these recipes I made modifications where I saw fit. For starters, the hummus. I went with the "supremely spicy hummus" by Sabra to help prevent the bland flavor I see all over the reviews. Swapped the green pepper for a red pepper. No lemon juice either on one breast to compare flavor. Personally I liked the contrast of spice and citrus but it's your call. Also didn't need that much paprika for only 2 breasts, need about 1/2-3/4 the quoted amount. Still was a little on the bland side so after it cooked I added my own mixture of spices to flavor it up. I suggest playing around with what flavors you like to see what you need to add or change to reach your desired level of taste.

This was such a delicious and easy way to cook up some chicken. I used a homemade recipe for the hummus so that it was extra flavorful. Also, before putting the chicken over the vegetables, I sautéed the peppers and onion with pesto and garlic. I think this may have been the most delicious dish I have ever made. Try it out! And remember to always keep it irie :)

Just got this in an email today from All Recipes.  Loved it!  I used orange and yellow peppers in place of green.  I also used red roasted pepper hummus.  Served with organic long grain rice - delish!  Would definitely make again - great for a quick dinner on a weeknight!

My version:  1 lemon, 1 8 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes, one onion, a round package of red pepper hummus from the store (8 oz) paprika, cumin.   I think it had too much onion. I did the fire roasted tomato to get more flavor. I put the onion and one can of fire-roasted tomato in base of casserole dish, laid the chicken on top with the hummus on it. Squeezed an entire lemon and added paprika, cumin across the top.  My husband rated it a 6.5 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 as the best. He put hot sauce on top.

I made a few alterations to the recipie. I added rosemary to the the rub, used red instead of green peppers and topped with feta cheese and french fried onions 5 minutes before removing from the oven. I served this over the top of garlic couscous.

Easy, delicious, one pan dish. I used homemade garlic hummus and a red pepper (sweeter than green).

I was surprised at how good this was.  I used Cedar's Sundried Tomato Basil Hummus and substituted broccoli and cauliflower for the peppers and onions.

Loved it. Added just a sprinkle of salt, besides that actually followed recipe for once and it came out great; although I was skeptical.

We don't like peppers so I substituted broccoli and zucchini.  As others suggested, I also garnished with a bit of feta cheese  My husband loved it!  We tend to like things that are a bit more bland and found it to be quite tasty.  Next time I am going to add tomatoes to the veggies, as I think it will compliment the flavor well.

It was okay. I used garlic hummus and still found it to be a little bland. If I do make it again, I would maybe use a spicer hummus and maybe add more veggies.

Easily a family fave! I coated sliced chicken breasts with vegetable/garlic hummus and siracha powder and seared quickly in a cast iron skillet. Squeezed the juice of one lemon on top and baked on a bed of onions, peppers, and capers (coated in olive oil and salt/pepper) at 450 for 30 minutes. Mixed in frozen/steamed greenbeans and added more lemon juice. Served with a side of  pan roasted sraeli couscous and shredded carrots. Yum!

I have made this several times now and it is a family favorite which, with 3 little picky eaters , is a feat in and of itself! We prefer it with roasted red pepper hummus and substitute red and yellow peppers for the green pepper. The fact that it is gluten free is an added bonus for me!

I had chicken breasts I needed to use, and looked for a recipe that would incorporate the hummus I had in the frig. I didn't have peppers or other veggies to substitute, so I just used the onion. I used Trader Joe's Spicy Hummus, which I  spread thickly on both sides of the chicken (which I had sliced in than halves). It was quick to prepare and cooked in only 30 minutes. It was very good (and spicy!) served over brown rice. With a nice butter lettuce salad, it made an excellent, quick and easy meal. My husband and grown son both liked it a lot. Will definitely make it again.

We thoughts it was good. I did change it up a bit ....to the onion, peppers I added a sliced potato, garlic and a splash of chicken stock. Next time I make it I'll sprinkle zaatar on it, see how that goes.

I also added cherry tomatoes cut in half and cut broccoli. Served it with baked potatoes on the side.  The next day I served it over cooked egg noodles.  It was delicious!!  Happy to be a new member of allrecipes!  I can see some new emails have arrived with some more recipes I look forward to trying.
Thank you!

This turned out amazing! I did change a couple of things: I used a red and a yellow pepper instead of the green (because that is what I had); a lot of people said it was bland so i added a jalapeno in with the peppers and onions as well as a bunch of garlic; I added salt and pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning on top; and I used Thai hot pepper flakes instead of paprika; and I used Tuscan herb Hummus (that is what I had). It turned out so good It was hard to stop eating it! thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I marinade the chicken w/ Siracha and spicy (horseradish) mustard prior.  And then use supremely spicy hummus.  I sautee whatever veggies we have on hand w/ whatever spices I feel like using... and then place the marinated chicken on top of the sauteed veggies to bake.  We've done several variations based on what's available at the time.  Hasn't turned out bland or bad yet!   W/ lots of veggies we just skip the rice/grain side.

A great way to use left-over hummus!  I prefer smoked paprika for a little extra flavor and fresh parsley for color.

I used artichoke hearts instead of the bell pepper and different chicken pieces.  Pretty good and easy!

Made this for the family and everyone LOVED it! The chicken was so tender and juicy and the flavor from the hummus was amazing.
