Very good as is, but next time I will add black beans. I cooked this in a glass 8x8 dish, but it bubbled over, so of course i will be using a different casserole dish next time as well, but an over all hit with every member of my family. Will definitely be put in our monthly rotation.

I made it and it was great but I have one question... it is unclear whether you add the broth that was used to cook the chicken in back into the final pot.  I did and it made A LOT.  Serves more than 6.  The next time I make it, I will try not adding that back in and see what happens.

Super yummy comfort food.  Just watch the salt.  Would be best with low sodium taco seasoning and low sodium soup.

I think this recipe is a great base to experiment with.  I knew that I'd find it bland as written, so I made a few changes.  I sauteed some onion and garlic in the butter.  Then added a cup of salsa, a can of black beans, and some green chilis.  I then reduced the amount of chicken broth substantially.  I was happy with the results, especially the leftovers.  Next time I'll skip the small can of green chilis and instead add roasted poblano peppers, cilantro, and some cayenne pepper.

This recipe was really good. It made a huge amount. I made it in one of those large foil pans. I drained a can of Rotel and added that to the top before the last layer of cheese. I also added black beans. The next time I make it, I will add some garlic to the sauted butter and maybe a few peppers.

Tasty but a little too moist. Next time I'll cut down on the liquid.

I made this tonight with a few changes to make due with what I had on hand. Used chicken boullion, made my own taco seasonings because I was out. Added beer for both flavor and tenderizing properties. Used chopped chillis, sour cream and used tortilla chips instead of soft ones. This absorbs excess soupiness and holds it together for easier cutting and serving.

Only used 1 can of cream/chicken. I think I'll use less than 10 tortillas next time and less cheese (a little overwhelming). Made it with the rice, but it doesn't need the rice; it's good by itself. Will think of adding corn and black beans next time to give it even more flavor. It would actually be good to make and use as a burrito or soft taco also (if tortillas left out of casserole). Overall very good!

Chicken was great however I didn't care for the tortillas in it and I didn't want to serve it on rice with the tortillas in it. If I make it again I wouldn't add the tortillas and serve it on rice or just put the chicken in whole tortillas. I did add Rotel and green onion as others suggested.

My 4 kids and hubby loved it!  Kids fought over who got the leftovers!  Think I might try it rolled in tortillas as enchiladas next time for something different!  Although, this was super fast and easy!

Good.  I cooked the chicken on the stove in order to prepare it sooner.  I halved the cheese and it was still very cheesy.  I added green peppers which helped, but next time I will try adding more veggies to make it a more rounded dish.  (Perhaps mushrooms/onions/more peppers?)

This was very good. Quite easy actually other than the shredding of the chicken, which really did not take very long. Next time will add a small can of green chilies and a can of diced tomoatoes.

The flavor of this recipe was good but I didn't care for the consistency. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too runny for me.  Next time, I will omit the stock and use more soup instead.  I will also do what other reviewers suggested and add sour cream.  I served it over rice and it was the perfect combination.

I made this recipe with some mods.  Due to the numerous suggestions to use less liquid, during step #4, I only mixed a half cup of chicken stock in with the soup, remaining taco seasoning, etc.   I also added some garlic and cayenne pepper to the butter.  I served this casserole style without the rice and my family raved about it!  I will be making this again...very soon!

Everyone loved it!  I followed other instructions to add 1 can of green chile peppers & black beans.  Used a can of cream of chicken & then one can's worth of sour cream.  Added 1 cup of water & some Better than Bouillon (chicken) instead of the broth.  I had chicken all ready shredded so I didn't follow the first crockpot aspect.  Used 6 taco-sized shells.  Also added the onion, garlic & other mexican seasonings (cumin, cayenne, & ancho chile pepper).  9x13pan for 20 minutes

I liked 1/2 of this recipe...hence 3 stars.  I didn't like it served over the rice.  I think the chicken mixture would be superb as an enchilada instead of the tortillas being cut into strips. If I make it again I'm modifying it

I made this tonight and really liked it!  I added black beans as some other reviewers suggested. It has a good flavor, but you could definitely jazz it up if desired. I wouldn't put it over rice as the recipe states--it already has tortillas in it, we ate it as is, like a casserole. I will definitely make this again!

Made this for dinner tonight with a couple changes. I used broth, not stock (not realizing it until after I had already made it), and I used 8 corn tortillas instead of flour. It turned out great-- the corn tortillas get crispy in the oven so it adds great texture. Didn't have it over rice though, we just ate it by itself (had rice the night before...too many carbs in one week!) Next time, I think I will add some black beans, corn, and more spice to it! Overall yummy though!

My family loved it. I didn't add the tomatoes or mushrooms but thats personal preference. I add a few spices and used frozen tortellini it way cheaper. I only cooked it for maybe an hour and it was excellent.

Awesome recipe! !! me and my friend loved it and I would only tweek one thing.  instead of using all that chicken broth I used the 3 1/2 cups in the slow cooker but I just used half new and half used of the broth for in the frying pan ^.^ it turned out so good and really easy to make!

This was a fantastic recipe, but really complicated. I feel like maybe it would have been better with all of it done in the crock pot. But still tasty! Would add some peppers and onions next time.

Its a great recipe. The thing I did was add chopped cilantro in between the layers, after putting the cheese on. We are going to add green onion to it the next time as well. :)

I made this the other night, with a few modifications, and it was a hit!  Firstly, I bought a 3lb jumbo rotisserie chicken, removed the skin and wings, and shredded the rest of it instead of slow-cooking breasts.  I added one can of campbell's soup, 1.5 packs of mild taco seasoning, and 2 cups of chicken stock.  I layered it as described above, but I added a layer of drained, seasoned, black beans on top of the chicken mixture.  I then added chopped, fresh tomatoes to the final layer of cheese. I think a layer of drained corn would be a nice addition as well!

Easy meal to make. And tastes great too! The only thing though is that the recipe didn't say if the stock you used in the slow cooker needed to go into the soup mixture. I made it without it this time, as I thought there would be too much liquid. Nevertheless, I was hoping that the tortillas would have been soaked up with the soup and cheese, but they turned out a bit dry. In this case I thought that you really don't need the rice. The casserole was good how it was. Next time though, I will add the chicken stock used to cook the chicken and put it in with the remaining chicken stock and soup mixture. I expect the tortillas to soak up any extra liquid so that the casserole will still come out with a good texture and not be too runny. I'm already looking forward to another batch! Good stuff!! A new family favorite!!

I really liked this recipe but made a few changes...I added a bit of hot sauce instead of the taco seasoning...and a can of Rotel...it was great...i don't think the rice is really needed because the tortillas provide enough carbs.

I thought it was kind of weird to put flour tortilla pieces into the chicken and then serve over rice.  I was wrong, it tasted very good and was something the whole family enjoyed (but who wouldn't love something with FOUR CUPS of cheese).  I made no adjustments to the recipe.

this was really good.  My family loved it.  I didn't put 10 tortilla shells in I only used a total of 4 which made one layer on each layer (2 layers).  I also only used 2 small cans of chicken broth (4 cups) when i shredded the chicken and took the chicken out I used the broth from that (after all it does have the seasoning in it) This I am sure is going to be a regular in my house.  For my picky eaters they loved it.

Not lovin it ~ it was okay, but a little bland, a little mushy, a little too much shredded chicken for my taste.  And too serve this with rice after all the tortillas are already in the casserole was a little bit too much dry for lack of a better word.  This isn't a real saucy dish, so when you plop this onto a bed of rice, it doesn't blend so well.

Easy to make, but too bland for my taste. Needs some thing such as green chilis or some scallions to spruce it up. We added hot sauce to give it some umph.

It's just 8 hours for some shredded chicken in cream of chicken soup. The casserole part doesn't make it better. I won't be making it again.

Not bad. Very bland, like one of the casserole dishes people would bring to church potlucks back in the day. But not bad at all either. Overall, it was good not great. Nothing offensive but we wouldn't make it again.

I served it with rice, I tried to eat it on soft shell tortillas, but it just slid out, best to eat it with fork/spoon. I added black beans ^& corn for color. This dish is really creamy & cheesy!!

Mmmm OMG so good with some changes! I added course black pepper in the crock pot with the chicken. After I added the soup it tasted soooo bland, so I added lots more course black pepper, extra chili powder, and cayenne pepper! I added a pinch at a time of the cayenne so it wouldn't burn my mouth. Gave it a little extra heat. I also added fresh corn to it. Yum! Definitely make this again!

Wasn't bad but not at all what I expected. It was very bland and tasted like chicken spaghetti. I tried saving it with refrained beans and rotel tomatoes but still not what I expected.

It was very very good we made this with fresh homemade flour tortillas. I would of given this 5 stars but it wasn't really a full slow cooker meal. I would make this again though.

I have the broth, chicken, and seasonings in the crockpot right now and it smells amazing! I'm stuck right now. Nowhere in the recipe does it say to prepare the brown rice and at what point am I supposed to add both cans of the cream of chicken? Does it get added to the chicken mixture?

This was excellent.  However, the ten tortillas made it far too bread-y.  Next time I will make sure there is one thin layer, perhaps using five or six tortillas total.  I added sauteed onions and a can of chunky Rotel for some flavor.

I am about the picky-est blandest person in the world, and this was too bland for me, and everyone else in my family. It could use some rotel, some pepperjack cheese, jalapenos, something...it needs more flavor. I made this recipe exactly as writen.

This was ok, but it seemed like something was missing.  The chicken was cooked very well and fell apart easily once done in the slow cooker.  The dish though was lacking.  Maybe by adding lettuce, tomato, salsa and sour cream at the end would have helped this?  Not sure if I want to go through the work to find out.

I didn't think this would be very flavorful, but boy was I wrong! I made it exactly as written and it turned out very good! The top layer was a little crunchy, and the inside layer was gooey and cheesy. I was pleasantly surprised with this one!

Not to our taste, a little mushy.  I have been making chicken like this for years.  I normally put several meals worth of chicken in the crockpot because shredded chicken freezes very well.

Loved and was super easy to make! I used low sodium chicken stock and it was perfect.
