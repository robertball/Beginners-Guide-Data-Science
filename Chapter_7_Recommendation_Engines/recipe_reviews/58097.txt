Good recipe. If you're worried about the peanut butter breaking up the tofu, do what I did-whip the peanut butter into some coconut milk! Worked like a charm and made the dish extra creamy. I used enough to make the peanut butter kind of warm frosting consistency, maybe a tad thinner. This plus jasmine rice equals heaven to reheat for lunch at work! Cue jealous coworkers!

I found this recipe very simple and fast.  I liked the fact that it used mostly ingredients I already had around.  The prep time was minimal and the cooking time was brief.  I cook at a student cooperative house full of 20 hungry college students, so I scaled the recipe to 10 times its published size and used a large wok with excellent results.  I found that the finished product was somewhat bland, so I added a bit of extra ginger and a pinch of cayenne, which gave it some needed extra kick.  I also found it to be a bit dull and colorless, so I added some grated carrots, which gave it needed crunch and color.  With my modifications, my housemates gobbled it up and made me promise to make it again!  I recommend serving with rice.

I liked this recipe, but I thought the ginger flavor was too subtle, and consequently the dish was a little bland so I added a bit of Thai Chili Sauce and that really made all of the flavors 'pop'! Also, I agree with adding a bit of water before stirring in peanut butter. The water helped to deglaze the pan and prevented the tofu from breaking apart. I will make this one again with slight augmentations...

Very, very good with just a few alterations.  Added shredded zucchini to "bulk up" the mixture a bit.  Also added extra green onion (you could easily double called for amount) as well as a few red pepper flakes.  A delicious and quick recipe!

Dip the finished peanutty tofu into the "Sweet Chile Dipping Sauce" (from the Thai Grilled Chicken recipe on this site). WOW! great flavor!!! Like some of the other reviewers have noted, this recipe needs a bit of moisture added to be at it's prime.  I simply added some water (about a half cup or so) to the tofu right before I stirred in the peanut butter. I'm getting so hungry just thinking about this dish... time to go make it again!

This was extremely tasty, but more importantly, super easy!  The rice took longer to cook than the main dish.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it needed a few improvements.  It seems like the meal would not be substantial enough on its own, so I added broccoli.  Next time I might add peppers or snow peas as well.  I also added garlic and more soy sauce.  Next time I think I will increase the amount of coconut flakes.  Overall, a cheap, healthy, scrumptious recipe that is ready in minutes!

Upon reading the reviews of this dish I took it upon myself to embelish as well. I decided to add some fresh cilantro and curry powder (but omitted the coconut flakes-- personal preference).  The end result was very good; my whole family enjoyed it, despite being finicky eaters!

Good job on a fantastic base, but I suspect it would be rather bland without some tinkering.  Still, thanks!

Per other reviewers, I added Sriracha garlic chili sauce and added water to my peanut butter for extra sauce.  Because of the extra water, I had to add extra peanut butter too.  I don't like coconut flakes with rice, so I omitted that, but otherwise the ingredients I used remained the same.  This tofu dish is way better the next day when it's had time to sit with all the chili/garlic/peanut butter.  Next time I will add brocoli to the dish to make it more of a main meal.

Yum! We made this one tonight and I was pleased to find a fast and flavourful dinner, that is also quite healthy!

The changes I made:
- used peanut sauce instead of peanut butter
- used garlic instead of green onions
- added some green curry paste (about a tsp)

Next time we will cook the tofu a little more before adding the sauces, as we like it quite crispy. We cooked it longer this time to crisp it up, but it dried up the sauce in the process!

A great, simple recipe that I will be tailoring and using again! Thanks!

Pretty good, I added sauteed broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and onions and served it all over jasmine rice for a more complete meal. Also took the  advice of others and thinned the peanut butter out with some coconut milk (fattening but delicious!) I also marinated the tofu for 30 mins before cooking using soy sauce, ginger, garlic, rice vinegar, and chili sauce. This recipe would be definitely be better with a kick, I had to add some more chili sauce at the end. I gave it 3 stars because I think it would probably have been pretty bland had if I hadn't added the additional ingredients.

I'm giving this a 4 because it is pretty good and could easily be improved upon.  I found the serving size (and thus the fat content) to be rather large.  I would say this makes 4 servings.  Next time I will definitely all more soy sauce and something to spice it up, probably red pepper flakes or maybe some thai chili paste.  I found it to be bland, and I expected the taste of thai peanut sauce, which has a bit of kick to it.  Also, I agree with the other reviewers about adding some water with the pb.

I just made this today for lunch.  I didnt want to make a lot because I wasn't sure it will come out to be my liking.  I cut up 24 cubes of tofu as this first trial.  I was going to use coconut milk to add into the peanut butter but decided not to go through the hassle and added hot water instead.  I stirred the mixture until all the peanut butter blend in and pour it into the pan together with the tofu.  As for the tofu, I fried them first before adding the green onion because the green onion tend to cook faster than tofu.  To add a little kick into this, I added a pinch of fresh minced red chili, and it made the whole dish tastes like Thai.  Love it.  I also added minced garlic due to personal preference.  Once I transferred the tofu to another dish, I put refrigerated rice into the same pan and added a little soysauce and  garlic and made fried rice to serve with this tofu dish.  The dish turned out great and now I wish I made more than I started off with....

We really like this (even my 15yo picky stinker). I used extra firm tofu and used peanut oil in place of the olive oil (which I thought would be an odd ingredient for this dish). Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this dish. I've made it several times and I always end up adding a shredded carrot, a tsp of hot sauce, and topping with cilantro. To make the tofu texture more appealing to the rest of the family, I cube the tofu and put it in the dehydrator or in the oven on low for a couple hours or just until it starts to firm up and becomes slightly chewy. Then I let it sit overnight in the tsp of soy sauce before stir frying. Whisking the peanut butter with 1/8 cup hot water helps it smooth during cooking.

Loved this recipe! So did my boyfriend. I sauteed some zuccini, red bell pepper, and snow peas before adding the green onions. I used natural crunchy peanut butter and tried to thin it with warm water, but it made it even thicker! I ended up adding some chicken broth to break down the pb and added about a tablespoon of srirach for some spice. Served it over brown rice...DELISH! And great leftovers for lunch today.

Delicious!  This was very simple and easy.  I did take the recommendations below and mixed the PB with coconut milk.  I mixed some sweet chili sauce in there too.  I also added shredded carrots.

Awesome!  I added some broccoli and actually used chili sesame oil for a little heat.  I served over rice.  I accidently omitted the flaked coconut but didn't notice.  Will definitely make again.  My dinner guests really enjoyed it...one thought it could use a little more heat so I may add red pepper flakes next time as well.

Excellent flavor and simple to make. Instead of flaked coconut, I just mixed some coconut milk with the peanut butter. I also added steamed broccoli and served over jasmine rice.

Very bland. Mostly just peanut butter.  Some people like the recipe after adding many ingredients to it.  But the recipe as is, is not good.  Very sticky and not saucy.

I followed the directions and even blended the peanut butter with some hot water before mixing it in the wok.  It essentially tasted like tofu with warm peanut butter since the peanut butter did not incorporate into a sauce.  I think the directions should be to cook the tofu first (or prepare it by dry-frying and marinating), set tofu aside, make the sauce in the wok (will probably need more liquid of some kind to give it more flavor - coconut milk?), and then put the tofu in.

This was pretty good, but I felt that the tofu would have benefited greatly from marinating overnight in the soy sauce instead of sprinkling it on, as the inside of the tofu was still flavorless when cooked. Other than that, the coating is delicious!

it was ok, i had to use red oniion instead of green, i can't see that making too much of a difference though.  I would definitely add hot sauce to spice it up if i had a do over.

I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, but I was in a hurry for dinner and happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  This dish was incredibly delicious!!!  I was nervous that it would not be particularly flavourful as the instructions did not call for the tofu to be marinated at all, but trust me when I say it didn't need it!  This was extremely tasty and will be on permanent rotation in my recipe box.

To me it tasted like tofu w/ peanut butter and coconut. Not a great combination. Also, there was almost no sauce aside from what was on the tofu, so there was nothing to put on the rice.

I used smooth Peanut butter and mixed it in a bowl with a few tablespoons of vegetable bullion and coconut milk, then added it to the tofu. Simply delicious! :)

I added some coconut milk and some minced garlic and it was a hit with my meat-eating husband and 23-month old! I will definitely repeat this recipe but I think I'm going to add some more veggies

Absolutely delectable. Used almond butter instead of peanut butter, also added minced garlic and a little cornstarch with extra soysauce at the end so there was more of the yummy sauce to pour over rice.

Absolutely gorgeous! This came out the favourite of a six dish oriental feast I made tonight! I love the fact that the tofu is not fried before being added to the recipe so keeps the consistency of soft tofu. My vegetarian boyfriend said that it was one of the nicest meals he had eaten for ages! 
The only alterations were more fresh ginger & used spring onions as am not sure what 'green onions' are - US term I imagine.
Thanks for the recipe. Will eat it again soon!

This was good and it was very simple.  My 5 year old didn't care for it, but my 2 year old loved it.  I didn't have green onions, so I used reular onions and I also used shredded cocnut rather than flakes.  This will make a good stand-by for those nights I need a quick dinner.

I tried this last night and it was fab - the fresh ginger gives it a really good bite. It looks like you've gone to a lot more effort than it actually takes.

I followed another user's suggestion to mix the peanut butter with coconut milk and it came out perfect. I like it spicy so I used a little extra hot sesame oil.

This was one of the best tofu recipes I have ever made. I did, however, change some things. This is what I did. I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so I used smooth. I mixed the peanut butter, which I microwaved for 30 seconds to make it more mixable, with the soy sauce, added the juice of half a lime and some chili paste (about a teaspoon was enough for me). I added this to the pan once the tofu cubes were crispy and sautéed for about 5 minutes. I didn't sauté the green onion. Instead, I mixed the green onion, some chopped peanuts, the coconut, the sesame seeds (toasted) and some chopped fresh parsley and topped the cooked dish with this mixture. It was absolutely wonderful. Thank you for the inspiration!

I concur with everyone else about the peanut butter. Definitely use water with it to avoid breaking the tofu. I added 1 additional teaspoon of ginger, some red pepper flakes and it was perfect!

It was ok. The flavours were great but I wasn't a fan of the pasty texture.  I didn't have sesame oil (maybe that would have made a difference).  I felt like i needed a sauce  To be fair my daughter loved it as is.  Will likely give this another go with a yogurt sauce on standby.

*note:  used GF soy sauce.

Made some modifications (which is why I only gave four stars), but it tasted wonderful! Used canola oil instead of olive oil, and sauteed some chopped garlic and ground turkey that I had marinated in soy, garlic, and teriyaki sauce before adding the tofu. 

Microwaved the peanut butter to loosen it up a bit, and added a little more soy sauce (and extra teriyaki sauce) than the recipe called for to make the sauce a thinner. Spiced it up with a spoonful of chili sauce. Very filling and delicious dinner! Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good!!! I didnt have chunky PB on hand so I added some chopped peanuts and it worked out well. I also added some carrots as this recipe is seriously lacking in colour and vegetables. I will be making it again though...and will probably add lots of peppers, broccoli, snap peas, and perhaps pineapple..for an added kick

I added some ingredients for better flavor.  For the green onion I chopped two bundles which was about 12 stalks. Instead of soy sauce I use tamari which is like a soy sauce but made for cooking with. And added steamed broccoli to the pan at the end and stirred and let it sit for about 3 minutes. All was served over brown rice.  I skipped the coconut and sesame seeds.

This was pretty bland. As suggested by some of the other reviews, I added cilantro and chile paste, and even then I ended up adding Sriracha sauce to the rice I served this with. However, it was very quick and easy, & I plan to keep tinkering with the basic recipe.

Needs more of a liquidity to the sauce.  It was very chunky, but the flavor was good.

You might want to cut the tofu up into smaller pieces. Also found the peanut butter to be more sticky than saucy.

Wonderful quick and easy recipe. Everyone in my family loves it, even ones who do not like Thai food. Add chili paste to add a little spice and it is fabulous. We also serve it over a brown rice medley which picks up each unique flavor individually.

A good base recipe. I've tweaked after several attempts and am very happy with the results.   First, thai chili sauce really works well with the flavors already in the recipe and makes everything "pop". I dabble on to taste since some of the chili sauce can get quite spicy. Next, I like to add carrots based on a suggestion by another viewer, it varies the texture nicely. I like to up the fresh cilantro to play of the spice from the chili sauce. Finally, if there is anything you can omit, it's the coconut flakes. While I don't mind them, they don't really add much flavor or texture to the dish (unless you really love coconut).

Nothing amazing here. Kind of bland with the ingredients that are listed. I added in a bit of salt and pepper. A splash of rice vinegar and some thai garlic chili sauce. I also added in some red peppers and mushrooms. For a similar dish on this site that is fantastic, try "Swimming Angels" on this site. However this recipe was good for an easy dinner, just needed a bit of tweaking for my personal taste.

The color of mine was kind of funky... grayish, but the flavor was really good. Maybe even better the next day... Oh, and I added the sesame oil at the end.

Delicious and easy! I doubled the ginger and also added water before adding the peanut butter to smooth that out. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and was happy with the result!

Not for me. Flavor was rather bland and the final product gummy and thick, even after I added milk to loosen it up. Won't make again.

This has to be tweaked a lot to make it edible. Didn't like it at all. Had to increase  the amount of soy sauce. Needed to add water as it is really difficult to add peanut butter without breaking the tofu pieces. Unless, one pan fries the tofu to begin with; can't be done with spring onion in the wok cause it will burn. I love tofu and thai food but this was so bland. Not worth it.

This recipe was really good but the next time we make it I think we will add some garlic & crushed red pepper to the recipe.  The tofu was really tasty and adding some broccolli to the tofu was a good call.

If you mean for this to taste Thai, it should be over jasmine rice, not white rice.  Huge difference.

I concur with several of the other reviews... this recipe is off to a good start, but needs to be jazzed-up a bit.  I used Thai chili paste, which helped.  I would definitely recommend using some water to break-up the clumpy peanut butter, and to make more sauce!

this recipes still has a ways to go. definitely pat the tofu dry before adding to the oil. add spices or it'll come out bland. add less peanut butter..i think smooth is better than chunky. also maybe add lots of veggies. I added mushrooms and carrots.

Great recipe, especially considering how simple it is. I did not change a thing and this came out wonderful! I was amazed at how little oil you need for this to make it taste great. We put it over whole wheat wide noodles and the flavors were delicious. Definitely makes 4 servings.

This is a nice, quick dinner however I had problems blending in the peanut butter - I had to add hot water to the skillet because it was initially one big lump, perhaps as it was a natural p.b.?  I would also adjust the seasoning next time as we found this a bit bland for our taste.  Good idea, though.

i made this exactly as written, except used soy peanut butter (can be substituted with a 1:1 ratio) due to an allergy. honestly, i was disappointed. based on the majority of the reviews, i thought we’d be in for a treat.

Tried this tonight and it was pretty darn good.....I added carrots, snow peas, and broccoli so I doubled the recipe (other than the tofu) so that there was enough of the ingredients to cover all the tofu and veggies.  I didn't use any coconut (my husband is anti) but I did use a bit of curry powder at the end and I also added a couple tablespoons of thai chili sauce, per the other reviewers' suggestion.  The chili sauce definitely added that kick! I think next time I will use a tad bit less peanut butter and a tad more chili sauce.  I added a dash of buttermilk and about a 1/4 cups of water to the peanut butter and whisked it up before adding it to the tofu mixture.

The other reviewers were right when they said this was bland. I made it the way the recipe specified, then decided it was far too bland for me and added more of all the seasoning, plus garlic and sriracha. That made it better, but still not good.

This recipe was my first try at tofu and i wanted to keep it simple but after reading the reviews it seemed as though everyone embellished the original a bit so i did just that-

I used almond butter instead of chunky peanut, added kale, used more green onion and ginger, then omitted the coconut in the tofu and instead served it over coconut jasmine rice (made with almond milk) & pineapple chunks as a garnish.

the final product is delicious recipe i will make again and again!

Tasty! ... and it was super easy to cook for a novice like me. Used the recipe as a guide. Peanut butter was a bit odd adding but once it gets heated it coats the tofu fairly easily.. I ended up using a lot more coconut to coat my tofu ... Terrific recipe! Definitely will cook again!!!

Good recipe if you take the advice of several of the reviews here. I added 1/3 cup light coconut milk, 1/4 cup water, 2 cloves of garlic and TBSP of Sriracha chili sauce. Oh, and juice from 1/2 a lime. I also marinated the tofu in 1 Tbsp Bragg's aminos, Tbsp water, 2-3 tsp ginger and 2 pressed cloves of garlic w/ 1 tsp sesame oil (while at work) and then I broiled it in the oven for 15 minutes. I already had everything in stock and I don't mind the extra work so this was fine for us. Thanks!

I've been using this recipe for about a year now. Prior to that, I really didnt care for tofu. Now I love it! I've never added the coconut thoug--just because I never had any. I add everything else that the recipe calls for. Once it's cooked, I serve it over brown rice and top it with a scrambled egg, a healthy amount of fresh cilantro, and a dash of sesame seeds. Id really good with Srirachs (the red rooster sauce). Enjoy!

Very good flavor. I thinned the peanut butter out with about 1/4 cup of coconut milk, fried the tofu in sesame oil and vegetable oil because I like the crunch and because it holds up better in my opinion. I then removed the tofu from the pan and warmed the peanut butter mixture, added the ginger and soy sauce, and then added the tofu back in. It held its shape wonderfully. I did double the sauce to make sure I had enough to serve on rice... excellent and I will make this again!

I don't think it had the taste of a thai tofu sauce. There was all to much peanut butter involved. I also found that I needed to add much more soy sauce and chilly flakes.

Not quite a 5 but it was good! I smoothed out the peanut butter by microwaving it 10-15 second intervals. After incorporating it to the tofu, I felt it was too thick, so I let it toast in the pan longer to dry a bit. I don't deal with thick texture very well. I also added a touch of thai chili garlic sauce.

As written this recipe is ok. I made so many changes to it this is really just a base recipe. I love the ginger in the peanut butter. You definitely need to dilute the peanut butter sauce with something. I used water and added soy sauce.

This was pretty good as a start, but needs some tinkering.  I increased the soy sauce and added ~ 1 TBS sugar and some water to the peanut butter before I mixed it in.  Could have added even more sugar, and I might try coconut milk and a little vinegar next time.  It's missing a bite, and the vinegar might help.  I also sauteed some julienned carrots and string beans separately and added them in when I mixed in the peanut butter mixture, which went well.  Good to generously sprinkle raw chopped scallion on top when serving. I'll make it again, but with a lot of modifications.

This recipe has potential, but needs more peanut butter and maybe to be marinated.

I was very disappointed in this dish.  It was bland and I had to add more soy, lime, and tamirand juice to give it a bit of complexity.  Would not make again.

I subbed out the olive oil and used peanut oil. I also made a peanut sauce out of peanut butter, rice vinegar, yellow curry, garlic and ginger for a previous meal. It all came together nicely. Serve it hot!

Not good! It was bland and two peanut buttery. I will not be making this one again and I suggest you don't either. Even curry couldn't help it.

This was easy and so delicious.  I used the suggestion to combine the peanut butter with some coconut milk, and that worked beautifully.  I thought the flavor was perfect, not too overpowering, but still strong enough to be satisfying.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very filling! One needs to add water right before adding the peanut butter. Many users say that the recipe needs more pep or kick. If you REALLY like ginger then take their advice, otherwise stick to the recipe. I added red pepper flakes to give this more kick and my husband added chili sauce for more kick. We also added more soy sauce.

This was really delicious.  I used tofu that had been frozen, and was prepared to add water as some reviewers suggested, but it did not need it.  I've been trying to eat more tofu, so thanks for this great recipe!  Oh, and I also added a little crushed red pepper flakes, which were good.

My peanut butter coagulated and gave the dish an unpleasant texture. Maybe I did something wrong. Based on this alone, I will not make again. The flavor was OK; I added a sprinkle of fish sauce, which gave it a true Thai smell and taste (but is not vegetarian).

i have made this three times and i think it tastes best with keeping the liquid down somehow the peanut butter kind of gets chewy instead of your average peanut sauce.  use powdered coconut milk  and add sweet chilli sauce after you take it off the burner

This was pretty bland, I have to say-- I added lots of stuff because of the other reviews, put in cilantro, basil, extra garlic and ginger and coconut milk. I think  it might be good if you spice it up a bit with some thai chili sauce, and halve the amount of tofu though.

Suprisingly yummy.  Having never cooked tofu before, I was not sure what to expect, but it was delicious.  Even my two-year old loved it.  Very easy.  Great weeknight dinner, too, because it is fast to make.  I bought the tofu that was already cut into cubes to save time.  Served it with fried rice.

This was a really good recipe, I have never tried tofu before and this one was a real hit.  I used the suggestions listed here and cooked it longer before adding any sauce, then I thinned out the peanut butter a bit and added a little chili paste, YUMMMMM!

Needed more soy sauce and overall on the dry side. However, unless you deep fry tofu or make it with gravy, it might just be the nature of tofu (low fat). But I'd make it again because it's quick.

This recipe is delicious! I love finding new ways to cook tofu and this flavor combination was a pleasant surprise. I served it over brown rice and it tasted very good. I did make the mistake of buying the ingredients without noticing that it only serves 2!! There are 6 of us but it still worked out because 3 of my children would not eat it (note to parents!). I plan on making this again, hopefully my kids will be a little braver next time! Thanks for the great recipe.

I served it with Thai rice noodles, drizzled with toasted sesame oil and soy sauce. Nice!  I had no leftovers for the tofu—my husband the vegan scarfed it up!  A+, y’all!

Very good! I followed the suggestions of adding Sriracha sauce and water to the peanut butter to thin it out before adding to the tofu, which worked beautifully.

This is a very flavorful and easy recipe. I do agree to thin out the peanut butter. I actually used all natural peanut butter which is already soft but when heated, it got more dense. I also added some shitake mushrooms and the juice of one lime,  just because I like lime.

Disappointed with this recipe. Made it last night, instead of tofu I subbed green beans, carrots, and chickpeas - keeping the measurement about the same as the recipe suggested for tofu. I agree with others, the peanut butter needed some serious thinning out, I don't know if it was just because I used a natural peanut butter that is a bit on the thicker side, but even with warming it up, mixing in some milk and water it was still really thick and "gloppy" and overly peanut buttery, even for someone that likes peanut butter. The combo of ingredients is good, but the measurements need some serious adjustments. Taking this off my "favourites"

Peanut butter does not dissolve/ melt while cooking. It probably needs to be whipped in soy sauce or oil before adding.

My girlfriend and I made this recipe and absolutely loved it! However, we made a couple alterations and will make a few more next time we make it. First, we partially dried out the tofu beforehand so it stayed firm and didn't break up. We took the advice of other reviewers and added coconut milk (1/2 - 3/4 cup) to the peanut butter, mixing that up before adding it to the wok. Depending on how creamy/saucy you want it, you could add even more coconut milk. We also added about 1/2 cup diced red pepper halfway through the saute time to give some crunch. Finally, we felt it definitely needed salt to taste. We served it with brown Jasmine rice, and the whole dish together was awesome! We decided next time we'd add more coconut milk for a creamier sauce.

Quite good.  Did add broccoli, water and some hot sauce, as recommended in other reviews, and served over brown rice for a complete meal.

Not amazing. Way too many flavors here. Peanut, ginger, coconut, sesame? That is almost every thai flavor you can think of. The peanut butter was too much. I fried the tofu beforehand instead of putting it into the dish while it's still soft. The dish tasted better as leftovers heated in the microwave. After a day or two, the flavors all had a change to combine. I probably won't even make this again.
