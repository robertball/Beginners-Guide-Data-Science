It was amazing! The lemon juice added the perfect amount of zest, but maybe try replacing the sugar with Stevia or another healthy alternative. All-in-all, it was delicious and I definetly recommend this recipe for someone who has a sweet tooth. Works better using frozen strawberries if you're in a time crunch!

Why not 5 stars?  Because this recipe makes such a small amount. My ice cream maker only turns out a pint at  time. The volume on recipe amounted to a third less than a pint. Also putting mixture through a fine sieve is essential to smoothness. Not much trouble to do that,  with the reward more than worth it.

Still delicious even when I tossed all the ingredients in a blender then chilled in the fridge for an hour. I used plain lowfat yogurt and added a 1/2 teaspoon of  vanilla extract on account of not having any plain greek yogurt. Easy and very fresh-tasting.

This is a great recipe! Four ingredients and a little of your time you can have delicious homemade froyo! This is the perfect balance of sweetness and cream packed with the taste of strawberries.
