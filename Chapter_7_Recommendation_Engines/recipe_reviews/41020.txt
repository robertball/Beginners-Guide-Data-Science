This was the first apple pie that I have ever made. It was soooo good. It was sweet and crunchy and delicious. I am definitely keeping this recipe and making it again.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  It put the pumpkin pie to shame.  Made it with a mix of gala, granny smith and golden delicious apples.  Used a low fat caramel ice cream topping and it tasted marvelous!

This pie is awesome.  I made a few adaptions and entered it in the county fair where it won best of show!  Great start, with  many options.

A very good recipe.  I use somewhat more than pecans and caramel than called for.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was such a hit my Father-in-Law requested it for Christmas.  Wonderful with Vanilla Ice Cream!

This was an absolute hit...the favorite among
many desserts at a recent party.  Many said it
was the best apple pie they had ever tasted.  I
used Pillsbury pie crust, a combination of Rome
and Granny Smith apples, and added cinnamon to the topping. Brought a taste of it home to my
teenager who begged me to make one for us.  And
it is SO easy!

I have made this pie for every occasion during the last year and it is always a HUGE hit! Everyone always asks for the recipe! I use a nut chopper to grind whole pecans into small pieces and use extra pecans and caramel on top. I also add a dash of cinnamon to the topping before baking. This pie is wonderful with cinnamon ice cream! The ready-to-use Pillsbury Pie Crusts are also great if you don't have time to make the crust from scratch.

This was a BIG hit last Thanksgiving. Nobody was interested in any of the other pies we had, and there was an arguement over the last piece.  It's SOOOO GOOD you'll want to fight for the last piece.

The first time I made this pie, the tin bent as I was taking it out of the oven and it fell "face" first onto the floor. It smelled so good that me and my friends picked at it anyways. Even my dirty kitchen floor could not stop this pie from being delicious!! I made it again the next day to fully realize it and it was heavenly. I put the nuts into the crumb topping and that was really good. You could put that crumb topping onto any kind of fruit pie and it would make a lovely top crust.

It was easy and delicious!!!!  I love the addition of pecans and caramel.  Instead of making the pie crust, I bought a box of Pillsbury pie crusts that come 2 to a box, are folded, and found in the refrigerated section of the store.
It tastes like homemade crust. We served the pie heated and topped with vanilla ice cream.  YUM

Excellent pie, lots of crumb topping, makes more than enough for a deep dish pie.

Absolutely delicious!  It is a beautiful presentation.  I took it to a potluck and the whole pie was eaten in no time.  People loved the change from the usual apple pie.  If you adore caramel apples, you will love this pie.  Use Golden Delicious apples.  Yum!

I brought this to a dinner get together and it was gone in 10 minutes.  Everyone loved it.  I added extra caramel topping and pecans.
