Very good, but here's what I did differently the second time I made this dish. I skinned the Eggplant, cubed it, and marinated it in Soy Sauce for 20 minutes. I used more than 8 cloves of Garlic ( 12 ). I used a store bought variety of seasoned Bread Crumbs ( Italian ) and found that mashing the cooked Eggplant aided in the mixing of the ingredients. Excellent!!!

Very tasty and wonderful texture. I am not always a big eggplant fan but I couldn't get enough of these. We served them with spaghetti. I prepared the mixture and then froze them in balls before baking. I took them out when I needed them, baked them and they were very good.

Words can not explain this creation. My favorite veggie is eggplant - these absolutely deserve 5 stars.  I test froze one cooked patty - still excellent.  Next time I will cut the eggplant a tad bigger - maybe a little bigger then the size of dice - I also added chopped banana pepper & jalopeno to the rest of the batch (I made double right off the bat).  I made patties and fried them in a LITTLE olive oil in a skillet on the stove.  This is a great base to make your own veggie burgers - I will be adding waterchestnuts, chopped onion, shredded carrots.  Can't wait until I make meatballs.
This recipe is going to be a big hit at family gatherings!

If you like lots of flavor and spice - consider my variation on this theme:  I jazzed up this dish by adding 2 extra cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar and 4 tbsp white wine while steaming the eggplant.  I left out the egg.  I formed the mashed eggplant into 1/4" patties and baked on a lightly greased cookie sheet per the original instructions.  They are incredible!  Far more than I hoped for and we'll be making this dish often.  Served with a side of pasta and marinara sauce.  Leftovers, if there are any, would be great cold in a pita sandwich.

Thank you, Aunt Mary!  These were ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  i didn't even have the time to refrigerate them at all, but agree that it would only make for an improvement if i had.  i peeled the skin off, because of preference, and mashed them after steaming (you need to stir them every few minutes) and only baked them for twenty minutes because i finshed cooking them in my pot of sauce.  My husband and his male friends (sorry to be stereotypical) preferred them to my meatballs!  I can't wait to make them into a veggie burger, too!!  This recipe will live on in my family.

This is somewhat similar to a family recipe of mine, very yummy...even my brother who hates eggplants will eat this way!!!
Just a suggestion, after baking or frying these add them into a pasta sauce and let them absorb the sauce, it will give them a different flavour!!!

Being an eggplant lover, I find this recipe just wonderful. My wife, however, detests eggplants, but was successfully fooled when I made her these. She loved them too! These also work well as an alternative falafel. Lastly, I agree with other reviews concerning adding seasonings and mashing as you saute.

A little messy to make into balls at first, but with my trusty ice cream scooper it got a whole lot easier! This is a great substitute for meat balls. Very hearty and filling, not to mentiond delicious!

Didn't need extra breadcrumbs as I only used one egg and they held together fine. Refrigeration before forming balls or patties is an important step and helps them hold together better.  A very versatile recipe for adding your preferred spices before cooking and different sauces when serving.  Other additions that work are, mashed cooked lentils, diced spinach, well drained extra firm tofu (crumbled), finely chopped pretoasted walnuts.  Sprinkled flattened patties with additional seasoned breadcrumbs and drizzled with a little garlic olive oil, for a nice baked crunchines. I got 5 large patties and 10 small balls. Froze the unbaked balls for later to bake with a sauce. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Awesome! I added 8 oz of finely chopped mushrooms & then adjusted the breadcrumbs according.  I used a small cookie scoop to make the balls & baked at 375 for a slightly drier meatball.  My grandson "hates eggplant & won't eat mushrooms", downed 8 of them.  Don't ask don't tell.  Thank you sooooooo much!

My boyfriend and the women in my bookclub all loved this recipe.  If you like eggplant, go ahead and include total of 6-7 cups of eggplant to the recipe (rather than 4C),and add one eggwhite.  Using Italian breadcrumbs adds some nice flavor.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and texture. As they cooled they were a little firmer and easier to toss in pasta and sauce, gently.
I added fresh garlic chives,basil and oregano and also seasoned bread crumbs. This gave them so much flavor and are similar to a Boca Burger Veggie patty. I would suspect these would freeze well but haven't tried it yet.  A Keeper!!

I made these today and I can say they are divine!  I shaped them into 9 nice sized "meatballs", baked them and put 1 cup of Prego Heartsmart spaghetti sauce on them with a topping of 2 tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese.  It just blew me away!!  Next time I will make them into "burgers".  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe Lynette!

5 star with some alterations: added onion powder and some basil and paprika.  Chopped eggplant very small so it cooked quicker and the balls were more homogeneous.  DELICIOUS!   Especially with spaghetti sauce.  Good texture too.

I didn't notice a lot of flavor with this recipe, but my husband enjoyed them.  I increased the breadcrumbs, and also the chill time.  I did enjoy the crispiness the balls took on from baking.  I will try them again, but modify the recipe somewhat by straining the eggplant before mixing in the other ingredients.

The end result is a very tasty additive as a side dish, but getting there is a little rough.

First, I peeled the eggplant.  The 1 tbsp of water is just not enough to get the eggplant moist and make it steam.  It took almost 45 minutes before the eggplant was soft enough to "mush" up.

Two add'l 1/4 cups had to be added w/the breadcrumbs. I even added in a little corn starch to give it a holding consistency.

Refrigerating it should have been for 1/2 hour (not 15 minutes).

I baked them for 45 minutes (not 30).  They come out brown, and are very, VERY tasty when they're done.  But, you must have patience and the right ingrediants to make it worthwhile.

I took the advice of some of the reviewers and use this recipie to make vegi burgers.  They come out amazing.  I did add a little to the recipie though.  I use about 8 cloves of garlic.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of shredded carrot and and one diced small hot pepper.  The end result is amazing. It has become a family favorite and a great meat alternative.  Thanks for posting.

I loved this recipe!  I love eggplant so this was perfect! I put the steamed eggplant in a food processor and pulsed it a bit before adding the bread crumbs and other ingredients.  I only used one egg since I did this but added about 2 T of milk.  I also added a little bit of basil and crushed red pepper.  Thanks to the other reviewer about using an ice cream scoop.  Made it so  easy! This recipe is going to be made alot!

These meatballs are extraordinary!  I used 5 garlic cloves, cheese and crumbs called for, black pepper and no eggs or parsley.  I had to beat my husband away from them so I can use them for supper!  Great recipe!

Well, these are definately not the prettiest things, but, boy, are they good! I used more garlic than called for, just one egg and eyeballed the bread crumbs until I could shape them (also added a little salt and pepper, to taste). My eggplant only needed to steam about 10 minutes or so. I formed them into small logs...they are really good! We make a recipe similar to these, but they are fried, so this was a nice, healthier alternative. I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

So good! This was the first time I've ever tried eggplant. OMG, the best for a meatball substitute! I made these exactly as directed, then I mixed them in a pot of spicy marinara sauce. I served it over spaghetti with garlic bread and voila! Fabulous, especially the next day :)

These were awsome and fun for something different at dinner! We went the mediterranian route by adding a little curry and served with pita's and yogurt sauce. There is so much you can do with a recipie like this - thank you for sharing

Great!  I made a double recipe and think I will continue to do so in the future, as it`s too many steps for a smaller batch.  I peeled my eggplant (1 medium-large eggplant=4 cups)and added more water while steaming.  To make up for that, I cooked it an extra 10 minutes uncovered while mashing with a fork.  I also oiled my baking pan with a bit of olive oil and had no trouble with sticking.  For seasonings I used much less parsley, maybe a quarter of what was called for, and the parsley taste was still strong.  After reading other reviews I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar, more garlic (after cooking the eggplant) and some red pepper flakes.  The end result still didn't have a strong flavor, but it was very good.  I think this would be excellent cooked in a sauce as you would with meatballs; it's the texture that makes it great.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous. I make this to take along to all occasions and it becomes the talk of the table - everyone wants the recipe. I team it with tomato and basil sauce and often partner it with fresh pasta for a tasty meal. Note: add some mozzerella for an extra cheesy taste.

The proof is in the kids!  I made these with spaghetti and use them as the "meat" balls.  The kids never even realized they weren't eating the real thing.  (my son noticed the skin, but i just told him it was spices1) I might try peeling them first next time to prevent that.  I tried one right out of the oven and got the impression they would be great with ranch dressing as an appetizer.  I put them in the sauce this time.  I'm so glad I decided to try this.  I did increas the bread crumbs to 1 cup and I used italian bread crumbs.  Excellent!  I'll recommend them to everyone who's afraid of eggplant!!! :)

I would cut up more eggplant next time and cook it a little longer.  Needed to add more breadcrumbs even though I used only one egg.  I also added some crushed red pepper when I mixed it all up.  I sauteed some sliced red bell peppers with onions and added some tomato & basil spaghetti sauce, then the eggplant balls and served them on hoagie rolls for a veggie Italian sandwich.  Yum!

I loved this recipe and my boyfriend also loved it! I made it into patties rather than balls, and do noticed that the thicker patties remained mushy in the inside, while the thinner ones got all yummy and crusty. I didn't have any Parmesan cheese available, but I used a cup of shredded cheese, and it worked wonderfully.

It would be important to add a previous step, which is to salt the cubed eggplant and leave it for about an hour and then rinse it. Skipping this step could ruin the recipe.

WOW! Excellent! I have a profound eggplant hater in my DH.  My daughter and I just LOVE eggplant.  couple of times a year i do the fried eggplant patty as a treat for us (calories! - fried, you know) and then we rather avoid it.  This recipe is WONDERFUL - even DH says they're ok.  I find it absolutely marvelous that they're steamed and baked - and are as crispy as I like them when they come out of the oven! Flavorfull !- an awesome original idea to create "meat" balls and patties with eggplant. The only thing i do different here are my herbs and spices - I add/change only to my family's taste (I add a bit of grated onion, - bit of italian seasoning - more garlic)  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

I LOVE eggplant....but I hate to say this recipe didn't do much for me, and my pet peeve is bland food.   Totally lacking in flavor, needs more garlic & much more seasoning.  The final product tasted to much like egg for me and had too much breadcrumb which created a mushy consistency.  I had high hopes for this recipe...
I may consider trying again because I'm always looking for creative eggplant recipes, but will make sure to make many changes to suit our tastes.

This was my first time making eggplant and it was success. I crossed my fingers that my boyfriend would like it, and what-do-u-know- he thought it was really good :) I rinsed with sea-salt to let the bitterness sweat out before adding to the garlic mix. Added extra bread crumbs and parm cheese. We ran out of fresh parsely so I substituted with some dried basil. I love herbs so I'm sure the full parsley amount would have been heavenly. I flipped the mini patties over 15 minutes through then sprinkled cheddar goat cheese on top the last few minutes in the oven, and served with tortellini. Great recipe, a keeper, thanks!

yum, yum, yum!  I made this last night and loved it.  I didn't have grated parm cheese and I think if I had that it would have been even better.  Also didn't have fresh parsley so had to add dried, but even if I had it I don't think I would have added an entire cup. I added a few of my own prefered spices, made into patties and served with sauce on top. I will be making this again and again! Thank you Lynette!

Just made these as burgers for lunch.  They taste okay, but it's missing something.  I tried strawberry jam and then hot sauce, but it just didn't work with either.  I will not be making these again, unless I was in the mood for spaghetti and had some tasty spaghetti sauce to use atop.

We made these last night, and we loved them!
I added shredded carrots and a bit of red pepper flakes and some pepper and oregano and served them on a bun with warm homemade tomato sauce.  Also, I used a cup of bread crumbs and i still felt that I need more to make the consistency easier to ball up.  My husband had two helpings, which is saying a lot.  Next time I would add some onion and some other spices.  You could do a lot with this recipe and get creative!

These were really good and worth the time to make them! The recipe made too many for my husband and I to eat in one night, so I froze the remainder. I heated them for 15 minutes in a 350 oven from frozen and they were great as a lunch!

This was great! I actually used 1 big eggplant, a handful of sliced mushrooms, and 1 whole cubed zucchini. i added a couple dashes of soy sauce and some Mrs. Dash. After it cooked, I mushed it all together with the back of a spoon. I added parmesiano regiano while they were still hot. Once it cooled i added 2 eggs and i used enough toasted french bread crumbs to be able to shape them without them falling apart (i didn't have dry breadcrumbs on hand). I formed them into balls and baked them in the oven! these taste wonderful, kept their shapesand my boyfriend loved them. he wants me to form them into patties next time for veggie burgers. hopefully these will freeze well :D thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were great. I peeled the eggplant first(my personal preference).I found it easier to steam the eggplant in a larger pan when using one large eggplant. I also mashed it when blending the ingredients. When baking in the oven, I turned the balls over 1/2 way through to get that golden brown look and a better texture. More garlic and a couple dashes of of red pepper flakes gave it a great kick.

Super.  I'm always looking for healthy food that actually tastes good.  These fit the bill.  I've baked them on a seasoned baking stone with no oil.  Just a touch of cooking spray will keep them from sticking to an ordinary pan.  I put everything in my food processor & used a large spoon to scoop & flatten it into patties.  They freeze well unbaked.  Thanks Lynette!  I can't believe that I actually like veggie burgers.

I recently cut out meat from my diet.  This was a wonderful alternative to meatballs.  I didn't have parsley so substituted dried oragano (1/2 tsp).  They browned very nicely, and tasted superb!

The finished product is delish, but the recipe needs some adjustment.  When I checked on the eggplant after just five minutes of steaming, it was sticking to the pan and about to burn.  I'd suggest another way of cooking it - or paying VERY close attention during the steaming process.  In addition, I needed MUCH more than 1/2 cup bread crumbs to make the mixture hold together - and even then, the balls were sticky and tended to spread a bit while baking.  Maybe 1 cup bread crumbs, and say half an hour in fridge before attempting to roll the mixture into balls - and fry them, don't bake, so you can turn them and help them keep a ball shape.

Ifollowed this recipe to the letter.  Not enough water to steam burnt some of the eggplant.  Not able to form into balls, tried frying and baking and both ways ended up with mush which fell apart.  Bitter because the most important step was missing which was to salt, plate-press and rinse the acid from the eggplant before cubing.   Because I was lazy today and did not feel like making eggplant the way I know how, I ended up unhappy. I'd skip the cubing process, eggwash, breadcrumb and fry your slices.

These were great!  I did do a few things different (going by the suggestions of previous reviews).  I did have to add extra water to steam the eggplant.  I also used extra garlic and breadcrumbs, at least twice the amount, added an italian seasoning type mix and pureed everything in the food process.  Will definitely use again!

This was REALLY great! I made it for our vegetarian Christmas dinner and made a few modifications...  First, I followed other recommendations and added a bit of balsamic vinegar when frying up the eggplant. I also made a point of mashing the eggplant while frying it (once it was soft enough). I also added about half a cup of shredded carrots and a cup of shredded zucchini and fried it with the eggplant (I ended up putting in more breadcrumbs to balance things out as well). Finally, we made two variations: one with chopped walnuts, and one with finely diced hot red pepper. Both were delicious and I will be making this again !! 

p.s. It's really great with a mushroom gravy as well!

Oh my goodness! I can't even describe how wonderful these were... I made them into patties. Prepared them 5 days in advance (we made them for no-meat Fridays in Lent). Wrapped them individually (uncooked) and froze them. We took out 2 today, threw them in the oven and baked them until they were brown on both sides... They were perfect! Wow. These make the best veggie burgers ever! Next time I'll probably double the recipe, because I have a new favorite food... Thank you for these!!!

EDIT: We had surplus zucchini from the garden, so I used zucchini instead of eggplant this time. It also works very well!

I made these eggplant balls and tried frying them in a fry pan.  They tended to fall apart, I will try baking them next time.  The taste was good, and we ate every bite.

I made them again, and baked them in the oven.  They were much better and did not fall apart nearly as much.  I served them with pasta and a simple marinara sauce.  Next time I will try stirring in 1/4 cup TVP for improved texture.  This recipe is definitely a winner!

This was very good. We really enjoyed it. My daughter who does not like eggplant said this was good. I did as another reviewer suggested and added 1 extra clove of garlic, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes. I also topped it with marinara sauce and mozzerella cheese for the kids. Thanks for sharing.

These are pretty good.  My mother always make these, but I didn't have her recipe so I came here.  These came very close.  I mashed the eggplant after it was done cooking and i also peeled the eggplant.

This is a good recipe.  I would have enjoyed it more but I found the skin tough. I will try again with the summer Japanese eggplants to see if that helps.

This is a great recipe.  I read the other reviews and knew ahead of time to add more bread crumbs.  Also, I made fresh bread crumbs from seasoned bread.  They taste better than meatballs!

This recipe was very tasty.
I didn't have enough breadcrumbs as called for in the recipe so I used the eggplant to stuff portabella mushrooms.  After a trip to the store the next day I made "hamburger" patties with the leftovers. I found that if you coat the burgers with breadcrumbs they bake better and don't stick to the pan.

My hubby LOVES eggplant and I would turn my nose up to it..didn't like the texture..but eggplant made this way is AWESOME!! I only used 1 beaten egg and seasoned up with 2 teaspoons onion powder and 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning. I also substituted dried parsley for fresh, using 1/8 cup...These are addicting!! Freeze wonderfully..Now if I am hungry I pop a few in the microwave for a minute, top with sauce and eat on a bun!!

Always popular at every party I bring these to. They do take a long time to make, but it is worth your time. Add spices you enjoy to customize it. They do well in a crock pot. They are even delicious cold! Thank you to whoever posted this recipe!

This recipe was put on our meal rotation board before we had finished eating.  Just the right kind of tooth and smell and taste.  We dubbed them vegetarian dinner cookies and will love them forever!

But it all started on one or those nights, you know.  Friday 10 pm and I still hadn’t managed to get a healthy meal together.  I had two eggplants that needed to be eaten soon, so I saw this recipe and went for it.  And then the normal “that kind of night” stuff stared to happen. What I thought was parsley was cilantro and I had to smash up some bagged croutons with a shoe because it turned out we didn’t have bread crumbs either.  Oh and I froze it instead of refrigerated because I didn’t want to wait but then forgot about them for an extra half hour. 

I doubt anybody wants to replicate most of my mistakes, but do try it with cilantro sometime.

These were very god. I added more garlic to the recipe. I would suggest to double the batch as I only got 15 balls for the original recipe. It is a little time consuming. They turned out really nice looking too. Just like a meatball, only veg.

Thanks for sharing,

I know I have already rated this recipe, but I have to rate it again! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I made this recipe last week and I shaped it into pattys. I just took one out, put in the oven for 20 minutes and then put it in a small amount of sauce and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. I put it on whole wheat bread with a slice of American cheese and it was amazing! Next time I will put onions and peppers in the sauce :) Now that I know these freeze well, I will be sure to always have them on hand.

Pretty tasty, but next time I'll dice the eggplant much smaller to hide it better. I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted a teaspoon or so of Italian seasoning. Served them with pasta sauce.

These were super easy and complimentary to a simple pasta sauce. I LOVE that these are baked instead of fried! I preferred to bake the balls longer and at a higher temperature to get the desired crispiness. I raised to 450 after 15min and baked another 10 minutes. Next time, and there WILL be a "next time", I will make my balls flatter and shaped like patties. This allows for a dish that strongly resembles a VERY EASY eggplant parmesan and cuts out several steps. Served over wheat penne topped with homemade sauce and Parmesan. Great meatless meal and very filling. Thanks for this uncomplicated easy recipe for eggplant!

These were definitely different, but I liked them. I don't cook with eggplant often, so it's a bit of a learning experience. They sure weren't pretty, but hubby and I both enjoyed them. I served with "Pesto Pasta" from this site. I will make these again for a nice vegetarian option. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good! I had some eggplants and didn't know to use them up, and this recipe was perfect! I followed the recipe and made balls and sauteed them then simmered in a previously made spaghetti sauce. Everyone enjoyed the spaghetti and "meatless" meatballs!

These are awesome! I make them in balls for spaghetti and "meatball" dinner and I use this recipie to make burgers, add typical hamburger topping and enjoy!  To make forming the balls/patties easier I mash the cooked eggplant.  This recipe is a staple for me and my boyfriend especially since they freeze and reheat well!

Ok so at first glance you think oh another aurbergine (eggplant) recipe. HOWEVER, this was beautiful and surprisingly filling. I had no eggs though so just left them out and to be honest they held together great without them. I served with a basic tomato and red wine sauce and wholewheat pasta. Delicious and BF would like them next week too (this is the guy who hates aubergines!!!!). These would be great as finger party food with a nice dip or in a pitta bread with salad. Well theres no end of possibilities. I posted a photo too. Well done Aunt Mary!

With tweaking I think these will be really good.  Parsley is overpowering.  I subbed more bread crumbs for the parmesan to make non-dairy. They were a little dry.  I will try them again though.  Once the recipe is tweaked, it's another great way to use the lovely eggplant.

This turned out delicious! We let the eggplant "sweat" before cooking, but otherwise followed instructions exactly. We made patties out of these and baked them - yum! I found no flaws with the flavor, but will definitely be trying some of the suggestions other reviewers have made, next time I make this!

I love eggplant and was really disappointed in the way this turned out. I followed the recipe and I thought it tasted like stuffing (and not very good stuffing at that).  Next time I want an eggplant burger I will just cut thick slices and bread and bake the eggplant. This also took so long to make - Sorry.

These were really good.  We made them into patties instead of balls.  Then we added a roasted garlic sauce over the top.  It was a great addition.  Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and it was a great meal!

I eliminated the olive oil, opting for non-stick spray and a non-stick pan. Used food processor to grate the eggplant (used the long, slender Japanese eggplants). Very pleased with the results. Will definitely make these again.

My husband and I are on a diet and I thought these would be a perfect replacement for real meatballs. They're not bad... I'm eating them right now in a pita with Zaziki (greek yogurt sauce with cucumbers and garlic)... I added more garlic, gyro seasoning, pepper, and onion powder to the mixture, which made them smell wonderful while they were cooking in the oven. The flavor is pretty good but it's definitely no meatball substitute as it does not have the texture I was looking for. I might try to make this again with lean ground beef instead. I guess I expected them too much to taste AND feel like meat. They look really good, they smell fantastic, but they just don't feel like how I thought they were supposed to. I'm sure vegetarians will like this recipe, but for carnivores and meat fans like myself, it just doesn't cut it.

I took all the advice and this is what I did.  I used 1.3 cups of crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I could'nt decide between baking and frying so I did both.  I baked at 350 for 15 minutes then I flattened and fried (used just a tad of olive oil, but probably could have done as well without) on each side until golden brown, put them back on the cookie sheet and put a teaspoon of riccotta cheese on each and put back in the oven for about 10 minutes. They were really good.   My 5 year old daughter just loved them.  The only reason I bought an eggplant is because she liked the way it looked.  I have never made an eggplant dish.  I guess it must be beginners luck.  And one other thing; I used romano cheese instead of parmesan. I think I better get another eggplant.  Oh, they could use a little salt.

The "meatballs" actually tasted even better the next day. They can even be eaten cold and dipped in a sweet and sour sauce.

Absolutely the best eggplant dish I have ever made!  I love eggplant but a lot of dishes you can’t taste the actual eggplant. These are not pretty but they make up for it in taste. From other people’s recommendations I did add more garlic also added red pepper flakes And some caramelized onions. Baked at 425° for 15 minuets turned and gave them 10 more as I like the crunch on the outside. Amazing!!!

These were fantastic!  I made a couple of changes, because of personal preference.  I peeled the eggplant and added about 8 cloves of garlic. When it was done steaming, I lightly mashed the eggplant.  I used Italian flavored bread crumbs.  Baked them as instructed and used my homegrown/homemade sauce and thoroughly enjoyed them!

These were definitely good but of course we all need to made changes... here are mine- (1) skin off (2) eggplant in the chopper for a finer texture (3) 3 eggs, a bit more cheese and bread crumbs (4) I used the ice cream scoop and baked them in a greased muffin tin (yes) (raw too) no pre anything) (5) 300 degrees for 30 minutes and about 15 minutes into it I flipped them over. (6) top them with sauce and cheese or whatever you like.

I think this is a great base recipe that you can adjust to personal preference. Like another reviewer I added some balsamic to the eggplant and lots of red pepper flakes. I made patties and they were a little soggy so I'll reduce the amount of liquid next time. I'll also make them a little smaller.

I made two batches of this, one following the recipe and one where I added diced fresh Jalapenos. The Jalapeno batch was amazing. I tested them out on my coworkers all of whom asked for the recipe and something to drink.

These are phenomenal! When I have made they they require at least double the amount of bread crumbs, but that is mentioned in the recipe to get them firm enough.

I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions exactly except I peeled the eggplant and used seasoned crumbs as others had suggested.   I steamed the eggplant cubes for 20 minutes.  Not soft. Another 5 minutes, still not soft. So I took the cover off and sautéed the eggplant over medium heat until it softened  (more than 35 minutes total cooking time).  I then let the eggplant cool.  When I mixed the ingredients, I could not get it to hold together so I ended up mashing the eggplant as others had suggested trying to get a better consistency.  Continued on with the recipe as stated. I found them dry and overly  bready.  Won't make again.

These turned out amazing! I modified the spices in this recipe to suit my own taste. I also used panko bread crumbs instead. They browned real nice in the oven. This was also a nice change up to making eggplant. Can't wait to share this recipe with friends and family. Thank you!

I made the patties instead of the balls! This recipe is absolutely amazing! I put my own little twist on it. I added cilantro and some shredded cheddar cheese since I didn't have much Parmesan. I substituted cornflakes for the bread crumbs. I just put the corn flakes in the food processor to get the same consistency as bread crumbs. This recipe is fast enough to make on a regular basis when you don't have a lot of time.

These turned out wonderfully!  I didn't have any parsley so I just used some Italian seasoning.  They were great, but I'd like to try them with the fresh herbs.  But either way they were easy and delicious.  We will definitely make these again!

We loved this recipe! After cooking the eggplant, I put it into the food processor to break it down a little more. Also added enough breadcrumbs to make it easy to handle. After making the balls, I froze them. Then, when I wanted them I baked them for 30 minutes. They were awesome and one of our new favorites! Thanks!

These were great, although I don't think they can replace balls from chicken, pork, or beef. Kids liked them, too, but they like eggplant already. I have been really cutting down on meat, so these are great. I can't wait to try them on a pita with some Greek yogurt. 

Thank you, thank you!

These lacked flavor but were interesting and have potential.  My vegetarian Grandaughter and I made them and we did not hate them but even with marinara sauce to dip them in they need something else.  They were easy to make.

My husband and daughter love eggplant, my son and I not so much.  This has been a great option for our family of four.  I'm a vegetarian so I've made them into patties, varying the seasoning, and eaten it on nights the family is eating meat.  They make great meatball sandwiches and of course spaghetti and meatballs.  I make a double batch of this every week while harvesting my eggplant and freeze them.  I use Japanese eggplant.   If you chop it up in the food processor the final product has the look and consistency of meat.  Even my eggplant hating sister will eat patties made this way, with lots of condiments, of course.

Outstanding.  Added roasted peppers, cause I had to use them up, and it added  a little color. Great recipe.

I peeled the eggplant. I also used dried parsley. I then rolled these into tiny balls and baked about 15 minutes. I put them on a pizza for my vegetarian daughter. She loved it. I plan to bake some more for the freezer. That way I can just toss them on the pizza frozen and bake like usual. These come out very much like the vegetarian meat substitutes that are so expensive.

I did peel the eggplant and didn't measure it, just used a whole one.  Had to add some extra bread crumbs, and I did use the italian crumbs. I was worried about this recipe, because I'm only partially fond of eggplant, but they turned out so good!!!  I'll be making these again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!!  I did make them with some homemade pasta sauce over noodles.  I'm not a cook yet, but was highly impressed.

These were wonderful. However I did change a few things to what I had on hand, but the overall idea is great. They are very flexible to personal tastes which them priceless.

The eggplant balls came out a little bit too moist after baking for about 30 minutes.  I think it was the egg since thy seemed fine before I added it.  I didn't want to add too much extra bread crumbs since I thought it would make them bland.  I think that next time I will use less egg and possibly increase cooking time.  I did use egg substitute...so that could have been the issue rather than the recipe. I do plan on making this again, but will use more garlic to satisfy personal preference.

Yum-o.  I have a new favorite "meat"ball.  I used breadcrumbs from the Costco bread with cloves of garlic - it's very firm.  As other reviewers suggested, I smashed the eggplant while it was cooking, added a little bit of mozzarella and pine nuts.  I served these with marinara sauce for dipping with the Alla Checca sauce with pasta from this site for a little twist - pasta with a light sauce, these yummy, hearty eggplant balls with a heartier sauce.

This was very good but I couldn't give it a 5 because I felt like it could be done a little better. The flavor was good but I added some of my own seasonings. I felt like they needed to be bound a little better together. A friend suggested ground up sunflower seeds or maybe ground up pine nuts. I think I'm going to try that next time and yes, there will be a next time..

This was great.  I made a sauce of yogurt, fresh dill, parsley and fresh cucumber and served the eggplant balls on focaccia rolls.  My husband was forced to  eat eggplant as a child and consequently hated it.  The only way he will eat eggplant is in parmesan.  The eggplant balls are a keeper.

After reading all the reviews, I kept an open mind when trying this recipe. I mashed a cup of wheat thins to bits to use for bread crumbs as i had none.  That didn't make a dent, so I scrounged through my cover and settled on corn meal. Not for everyone, but it adds an interesting crunch. I too used more water than called for, and it desperately needed salt. Other than that, tasty veggie dish, and healthy!

Well, I didn't have breadcrumbs so I substituted ground almonds and couscous. I also accidentally forgot the cheese. I had too much bok choy so I chopped a bunch up extremely finely and used that instead of parsley.
And why this recipe scored an extra star? My toddler LOVES this!

Tasted pretty good too.

This was a good recipe.  It tasted great with spaghetti sauce! I am definitely going to use this recipe in the future.  
(I added more bread crumbs and more parmesan cheese that detailed.  And I fried the "meatballs" until this were golden brown on the outside.)  Great recipe- tasty results.

Fantastic! Just altered it a little for preference....salted the chopped, peeled eggplant and let rest for 30 min in a colander in the sink. Sautéed the garlic with a bit of red pepper flakes before adding the eggplant, then I used broth for the water for steaming. After it cooled, I only had Panko...then added Italian Seasoning to make up for  the 'blah' factor...added the other items per recipe. The mixture  sat in the fridge 30 min and then I balled them up, sprayed them with olive oil and air fried them on 350 till they were brown, turning half way. I served them over zuchinni noodles topped with a spicy tomatillo marinara sauce.  The meat-eating man was crazy about them!

I followed recipe as written, only changes were to increase quantity of ingredients as I had 6-7 cups of diced eggplant. I used 6 cloves of garlic, almost a cup of seasoned breadcrumbs. I think 2 eggs made it too wet but I needed the mix to hold together. I did refrigerate, which did help firm up. I used my cookie scoop but they came out too small. I fried in canola oil. I can see as vegetarian meal with pasta  as they are hearty. Certainly looked like  a meatball, great appetizer with a tomato dipping sauce.

Very good!  I did remove the outer skin and added some sauted spinach I had left over.  My husband even said it tasted like meat to him and said make this again!  I used them in a sweet and sour recipe.

I love the idea of this recipe, I just didn't think it would have enough flavor written as is. I used 3/4 of a cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, 1/2 of a cup of parmesan cheese, 1 teaspoon each of basil, oregano and parsley, 1 egg and no water (I didn't sweat the eggplant), oh and I peeled the eggplant (personal preference). It's a great recipe, I just like a punch more flavor

Excellent veggie burger alternative to black bean and sweet potato versions that I know.  I added  some chopped onion and portabella mushrooms along with some herbs. Texture was excellent and they crisped up nicely in the oven. I flipped them once.

I made these with pasta and tomato sauce with some other vegetables in it.   The flavour of the eggplant balls is great but they are to bready to be served to with pasta (in my opinion).  I will use this recipe in the future to make smaller eggplant parmesan (maybe eggplant parm bites) but I wouldn't serve it with pasta again.

It tasted more like a bread crumb and parmesan cheese ball.  I will definitely use more eggplant if I make this again.  Also, omit salt if using Italian style bread crumbs.

I made so many changes that it's practically a different recipe, so I can't really rate the original (using tips from other reviewers). Here are my changes:
I had 2 large eggplants which resulted in 12 cups of peeled & diced eggplant, therefore I tripled the recipe.

2 large eggplants, peeled & diced
5 Tbsp olive oil
15 cloves garlic, minced
3 Tbsp water
6 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
4 Tbsp cooking sherry
3 shredded carrots
8 oz mushrooms, diced
1 1/2 cup grated parmesan
1 Tbsp each: dried parsley, onion powder, basil, oregano
2 eggs, beaten
2 cups bread crumbs (Japanese style)

My husband said it smelled like an Italian restaurant when I was cooking it. They were quite yummy and ended up making approximately 50 "meat"balls, each about 45 calories.
I froze all the extra and they'll be great for a night when I don't want to cook.
After baking them I added them to some jarred pasta sauce and heated them on the stove. I found they didn't really hold together, so I may have to tweak the recipe a bit more. Perhaps more eggs next time...

Followed another suggestion and marinated the cubes in soy sauce but also added just a bit of Worcestershire sauce on hubby's suggestion. I had more than 4 cups eggplant and should have added more breadcrumbs. Meatballs held together but could have been more solid.

I made these with the intention of using them as veggie burgers. They were fantastic! Couldn't have been easier! I like a little spice, so I added a little crushed red pepper flakes when I sautéed the onion and garlic. I am making again today as a healthier alternative to the meatball parm sandwiches I'm also making for Football Sunday.

We did not care for these. Followed the recipe exactly, but used basil instead of parsley. I baked them on a greased cookie sheet but they stuck like crazy. Their texture was unappealing. Very disappointing.

The only change I made to this recipe was that I used a LOT more minced garlic (which I kinda do a lot for recipes...I like garlic).  My husband and I both loved this recipe, he loved the texture of them and how it reminded him of a traditional meatball.  The next time we make this, we're going to try the patty option, which will be soon since we bought 2 eggplants and only needed 1 of them to get the 4 cups of cubed eggplant.

I made this tonight and wanted to love it but the consistency was a little too mushy. The taste was nice and I added shallot to the garlic. I will try them again and will make the "balls" a lot smaller. I also won't finish them in the sauce as they fell apart when I was fishing them out.

I liked it, but hubby didn't. Followed the recipe exactly, but I peeled the eggplant (I don't like it), and thinly sliced the garlic (where's the mincer when you need it?!). I did have to add about 1/2 cup more breadcrumbs, and after baking them for the 30 minutes, they were still mushy inside. It's tricky to find meatless alternatives, but I'll keep this in the rotation, with a bit of doctoring.

9 6 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/18088/aunt-marys-eggplant-balls/ ... I want to give this recipe more than three stars, but not quite four.  :)  I liked these, but they are pretty bland - even with the major addition of 1/2T soy sauce - but afterall, we are talkin' eggplant here.  ;)  'Couldn't taste the soy sauce at all.  Some saltiness needs to be added sometime to help with that.  I wasn't so sure I'd like these so cheated a bit & added 1/2t each onion powder & garlic powder; 1t dried parsley.  The eggplant mixture was still quite wet with 3/4c breadcrumbs.  I ended up adding 2c & it still could've used more really; or one less egg(?)  They just came out moist, not in a bad way, but also not crispy except for the bottom.  :D  While I'm not too much into balls of anything except maybe peanut butter balls (Mmmmm!), I could see adding cornbread crumbs with cornbread dressing seasonings or more crumbs with traditional bread dressing seasonings & having hits.  Put on a toothpick for a holiday appetizer.  Soooo, I did like these & they are a good starting point for your imagination.  I oiled the pan & they stuck.  Maybe coat in breadcrumbs or instant potatoes if I make 'em again.  I'm upping this to four.  They're good.  They are.  One more thing:  I peeled the eggplant.  That skin is pretty tough; can't see it softening too much.   Note4Me:  sugg: add 2T Balsamic, spices/Italian bread crumbs.  One less eggs has ya not adding more breadcrumbs.  Add 1t red pepper & 2 or mo

The eggplant balls were not very firm to the touch but the flavor was very good. I tried pan frying instead and baking was the better of the two options. I froze them for later use, and then added them to a soup and they turned to mush. Not sure if the freezing process contributed to this. As I said, the flavor was very good but it would have been nice if they had a firmer consistency.

Loved these eggplant balls!  They only thing I changed was cooking of the eggplant.  I cut a large eggplant in half, brushed the cut sides with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Roasted it, cut side down along with a whole head of garlic on a sprayed cookie sheet @400 degrees for 30 minutes until soft.  Cool until easy to handle.   Scraped the eggplant into a bowl, squeezed half the roasted garlic on top then added the rest of the ingredients.

Very very good! 
I didn't have parsley so I used what I did have-cilantro, turned out really good actually. 
For the record-one medium eggplant is about four cups becasue I had enough to double the recipe with two eggplants. 
I also suggest flipping the balls over and baking another 5 minutes after the 30 minute cook time.

I only had about half the bread crumbs I needed, so I added flour to thicken the mixture, which made the eggplant balls soft and fluffy. I then put them in the toaster oven to get them crusty on the outside and soft inside. I thought the parsley was overpowering, and thought it lacked salt. I'd use another reviewers suggestion of substituting the water for soy sauce to get some extra salt.

Awesome recipe.  I added crushed red pepper flakes to the mush for some spice and some balsamic vinegar while steaming the eggplant for some extra flavor.

I was disappointed.  They weren't bad but nothing exciting.  They didn't have much flavor and seemed  too much like bread crumb balls.  I followed the directions exactly.

I made these because my 10 year old is a vegetarian. I had tried these at a restaurant and like them. He loved them! My 15 year old son and I also liked them and I will make them again even though they took a while to make. I used two medium eggplants, added a bit of balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce while cooking, and used a cup of Italian breadcrumbs and Egg Beaters instead of actual eggs. Yum!

Loved this recipe - I added mushrooms and used Cilantro instead of Parsley and added a little bit of Onion Powder.  I made paddies instead of meatballs.  It was amazing!

Wow.Who knew! Vegetarian dish can be tasty! Most wonderful as balls or stuffing for mini peppers. Mom in law, even asked for the recipe! I'm experimenting on a vegan version of if... Watch for Vegan Eggplant Ball.

I really loved these!  I had only used eggplant with mozzarella/tomato/basil combo in the past, so I was looking for something new.  I think these could be better than real meatballs!  What a great flavor.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I used parm. out of the jar, and I used jarred parsley.  I added fresh rosemary.  I think you could change it all up and it would be awesome.  Even better for me, this makes awesome baby food that is nutritious and full of flavor.  We all really liked it, thank you!

I used a cup of bread crumbs and these came out tasty and with a very nice crunch.  I'm willing to bet they make a nice patty as well.

I made these and used a few mods suggested by other reviewers. I peeled the eggplant and sweated it with salt after dicing to remove bitterness..it was a very large eggplant. I added a little balsamic vinegar and crushed red pepper flakes while steaming. I doubled the recipe because it is a pretty labor intensive effort. I was hoping to fool my son, who does not like eggplant, but does like zucchini. I was hoping I could get more vegetables into his diet. Unlike other reviewers, it didn't win him over. My husband and I like them, but we didn't love them. For all the work, it wasn't worth it to us.

We loved this recipe, but made a few modifications.  We used nondairy Daiya cheese instead of parmesan cheese and we put the recipe in the cruisinart blender and made small balls.

My family never really liked eggplant until we made this recipe.  I didn't change a thing, and it is absolutely delicious.  We make it every time we get eggplant from our farm share.

This is a lovely recipe! One of the best eggplant balls that I have ever tasted! I had a large eggplant that gave me 8 cups so I decided to try this recipe first as written, and then again with minor modifications. I did find the baked version to be a bit bland but went really well with aioli. The second time around I slightly browned the garlic, which added more of a garlicky taste, and I also added a bit of salt. I fried the balls in a bit of EVOO (about 1/4 inch of oil in frying pan) and it really boosted the flavour. To prevent it from falling apart, cut the eggplant into tiny cubes (1/4-1/2 an inch). This will help hold it's shape when cooked. I was also surprised how well the parsley works well with the eggplant (I would have used basil instead). This is my go-to recipe for eggplant balls. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Lynette Marie!!

Delicious! Had a lot of eggplant to use up from the garden and this did the trick. Made mostly as written, added a little extra garlic and threw them into a pot of simmering sauce for a little bit.  Super easy.

Very good - I cooked eggplant as instructed then used hand potato masher so further soften.  Used a combo of Italian breadcrumbs, matzo meal and panko - Important to use the full cup of fresh parsley - really brings out the flavor.  I only needed one egg - I think that varies by the amount of moisture in the eggplant.  Perfect!

LOVED these!  And with the unbelievable amounts of eggplant available these days, I'm going to be freezing a bunch of these.  I made them almost the same as the recipe stated (I peeled the eggplant and mashed it) and they were delicious and easy.  My 9 year old ate them thinking they were turkey meatballs until I finally told her they were eggplant.  She said, "I guess I like eggplant then!"  :)  Thanks Aunt Mary!

Unbelievably good! I modified it so that it looked like meatballs, put a little bit of mozarrella cheese in the middle and fried it in a bit of EVOO. The result was a delicious subsitute for meatballs - great in sandwiches. Thank you Aunt Mary!

Very pleasant surprise.  Tasty even though neither I nor my husband like vegetables.  
Making them into balls didn't work so well.  In the future, I will peel the eggplant and make sure the cubes are completely coated with breadcrumbs, then toss with the other ingredients

This was pretty easy, kind of messy but got great reviews. I DID add chili pepper flakes and a bit more salt and break crumbs. Friends of ours ate this with a falafal yougurt/dill sauce in pita bread. Next time i'm going to try the balsamic vinger/chili pepper steam/cooking suggestion by one of the other reviewers.

Terrific as a side dish or appetizer! I sauteed the diced eggplant in a drop of olive oil and a little water until it turned soft & mushy. I ommitted the egg and formed into balls, rolled in breadcrumbs and fried in olive oil. This one is a keeper!

The eggplant smells funky when steaming, but after adding the breadcrumbs and baking, it was very good! These were great as leftovers all by themselves too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is yummy!  I, too, added more bread crumbs and made patties and fried them.  Put 'em on onion buns with some cheddar, mayo, dijon, red onion and tomato.  Great vegetarian sub for a burger.
