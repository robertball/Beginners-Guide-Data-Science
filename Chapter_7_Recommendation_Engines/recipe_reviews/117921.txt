I made a few changes to this recipe and it was very good.  I served it with chicken and it was delicious.  I used white wine vinegar in place of cidar vinegar, 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (not 1/4 cup), and omitted the bacon.  To cut back on preparation time, do not thaw peas, just add them directly to the hot couscous, as they thaw they will cool the couscous.  I look forward to making this again!!

i made this dish today to sell at my cafe. we decided it's best to add additional curry powder into the couscous and replace the bacon with crumbled feta. We added roasted sliced almonds and cranberries for more color and crunchy texture. So good this way! Fairly sure it'll be on our menu to stay!

I had high hopes for this as I love curried couscous salads. However, I was very disappointed. The problem was the dressing. It tasted very odd and very oily. Could have reduced the oil, but the flavour itself would still remain unappealing. I have never had a curry dressing that tasted like this. The rest of the ingredients together are great but the dressing was a definate no-go for me.

So easy!  Omitted the bacon, added dried cranberries, halved the oil and used whole wheat couscous =  much healthier!  Will add a bit more curry powder next time for a stronger curry flavor...it was very slight with the amount indicated in the recipe.

It's a very good way to make couscous salad, curry gives a very nice taste to it, and then fantasy helps a lot in making a delicious dish. Thank you!

I omitted the cucumber, parsley and bacon, used only one green onion (not an onion fan) and used frozen peas and carrots. I also added chopped, roasted almonds. It was a big hit but it was a bit oily, even though I did not use up all the dressing. I doubled the entire recipe the first time but the 2nd time I made it, I doubled the amount of couscous but made half the amount of dressing and it was still plenty.

This recipe was outstanding.  I changed the kind of veggies I threw in and it was delicious.  A summer must have.

I made this for a potluck and it was a big hit!  I substituted bacon with feta cheese, modified some of the veggies (to use veggies I had on hand), and added more curry.  Delicious!  I look forward to making it again.
