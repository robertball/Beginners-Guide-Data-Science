My rating is for the recipe as is, it's very good.  I won't change a recipe then rate it based on the changes. And quite frankley I don't know why allrecipes allows that, it's certainly not fair to the submitter.  Having said that, IMHO adding an egg to the cream cheese/sugar mixture turns this into a 5 star recipe!

I have been making this dessert for some time.  My whole family loves it!  An easy way to enjoy cheesecake.  I also looked on this site and did not find this recipe and added it 2 weeks ago.  I don't know what happened and why it did not register.  You can also add a can of pie filling of your choice; peach, cherry, apple, etc. before adding the last layer of crescent rolls.  Yummy!

Simple and scrumptious.  I put a layer of pecan pieces between first crescent layer and cheesecake layer.  Drizzled honey over cheesecake when removed from oven.  Check oven starting at about 38-39 minutes, might not require full 45 min to bake.  Definite keeper...

Wow this was really good.  I almost didn't make it because of the creasent rolls but I am so glad I did.  It was super easy.  Followed the recipe exactly. Like someone else said besure to use real butter.  And when it came out of the oven I drizzeled honey ALL OVER it.  That is how I like my Sopapillas...but if your a chocolate fan you could drizzle that too.  The whole pan got ate up and everyone loved it. Thanks!!!!

I gave this only 4 stars because I have to make a few alterations after which I would give it 5 stars! The flavors are really excellent and I get soooo many requests for this recipe! The changes I make are to cut the sugar in the cheesecake portion down to 1 cup and in addition to the cream cheese I also add about 1/2 cup sour cream and one egg. For the topping I add an additional teaspoon of cinnamon and sprinkle a little bit of the topping onto the bottom layer of crescent roll dough before the cream cheese layer. Lastly, a half cup of butter is unnecessary in my opinion and I only use about 6 tablespoons instead of 8. Don't shy away from this because it uses prepared crescent dough, it doesn't detract from the dish at all!

One of my patients told me about this recipe, so I had to make it.  Made it last night for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit!  The only thing I changed was that I sprayed my baking dish before putting down the crescent roll dough and I did not use the almonds.  You have got to try this recipe!!!

Thanks for sharing.  I substituted 1c. ricotta cheese for 8 oz. of cream cheese.  Drizzled honey on after it came out of the oven.  Yum!

WOW!! So simple and SOOOO delicious. The only thing I did different is I drizzled honey all over the top when it came out of the oven. I didn't think it would be too good after the leftovers were refridgerated, but boy was I wrong.

I was looking for a quick dessert, and came across this recipe at another site, really was skeptical about the 3 packages of cream cheese, but I figured, what the heck, can't have to much of a good thing, so tried it, minus the almonds, and was really surprised when it turned out so well.   Think next time I will try 2 packages of cream cheese, and dot with some pie filling before putting the top layer of dough on. BTY I found "Crescent Recipe" rolls of dough, that you don't have to close the perforations on, it is all one rectangular piece, perfect fit for the 9x13 pan, just remember NOT to spread the filling all the way to the edge of the dough, leave it just before you reach the side of the pan. Great dessert, and soooo simple!!!!!

FANTASTIC recipe! Very well-received at a recent dinner party I hosted. Also, extremely easy to make. I didn't even bother rolling out the crescent dough on the counter with a rolling pin; instead, I just unrolled it straight into the pan and pinched the edges together. Per another reviewer, I omitted the almonds and only used 1 cup of sugar for the first step instead of 1.5 cups. I doubled the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and drizzled honey on it as soon as it came out of the oven. Will be adding this to our list of faves!

With the changes made this was a 5 star dish, as is it has a LITTLE too much sugar/butter.

I used 1 cup of sugar in the filling and 1/4 cup sugar on top, as well as 1/4 cup melted butter on top. I also added the egg to the cream cheese mixture. And cooked for 35 minutes.

This was fantastic. Made two pans for a pot luck at work and ALL the drivers (our workers) were crazy about it and devoured it like mad men. I may have received a few proposals. 

Run, do not walk, to make this recipe. You will not regret it. Though your waistline might.

This is an excellent dessert however, our family makes it a bit different we spread herseys baking kisses and pecans on top of the cream cheese mix  than add the top layer of crescent roll dough.. Once it is finished baking we top it with a little butter and honey..

I've been making this for years...it is always a hit!  Even to those who 'don't like cheesecake'...they still love this.  It is more like a donut filling inside instead of traditional cheesecake.  Don't be afraid & give it...you won't reqret it!  FYI...roll the top layer of crescent rolls out on wax paper to the size of your pan.  After you spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom layer of crescent rolls, just flip the top layer on top and peel off the wax paper...easy!  Also the almonds are only optional...I never use them.  enjoy!

I was so surprised at how amazing this dessert is! I was influenced by the reviews and high ratings given to this creation.  I will definitely make it again, but I will make these improvements in the topping:  1/2c butter is too much.  1/4 will work well.  1/2c sugar, again, is overkill.  The delicious dessert becomes too sweet, and the sugar masks all the wonderful flavors of the cheesecake.  I used less than 1/4c of sugar, and the topping baked wonderfully.  I still had a light, crispy, sweet crust.  Wonderful, wonderful dessert!  Rave reviews from your guests are guaranteed!

I get requests for this at potlucks.  Very good.  I cut the butter down a little.  I didn't like seeing it sitting in puddles on top when I took it out of the oven.

Wow! I tried this for the first time, following advice from other reviewers, and my boyfriend went crazy over it! He said it's among the best things he's EVER had and said I have to make this the next time we have company. I found it quite easy to make, too. The changes I made were: cut sugar in cheese mixture to 1 c., add an egg, sub 1/2 c. sour cream for last 1/2 c. cream cheese and add extra tsp. vanilla. I melted all the butter and used all the sugar called for in the topping mixture, but added an extra tsp. of cinnamon. I ended up only using about half of the butter and the sugar mixture in the end because I was afraid it would be too greasy and sweet for our tastes. I also cut the baking time to 35 minutes and served with vanilla bean ice cream right out of the oven...I had no problem with cutting it at all. This was INCREDIBLE and will be my go-to dessert to impress people when I feel like impressing someone. Thanks so much for posting! :)

This was fantastic.  I had a hard time wrapping my mind around using crescent rolls, so I used puff pastry instead--amazing!  Also, I added both vanilla AND almond extract to the cream cheese. (and I don't know if it made any difference, but I baked it for and extra 5 min) It was a huge hit and I will make this again.  : )

Followed the recipe exactly--delicious.  Made for a party and it was a hit.  People asked to take the leftovers home.    Just a couple tips: 1.Assembled the dessert the night before 2.Baked the dessert while everyone was eating dinner.  Served it freshly baked and warm. Perfect.

I made this last night for a large dinner party. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar for the filling and it was just right. I also added a fruit topping on  top of the filling and it needed a bit more. It was really great and my guests loved it, but it was missing something. Maybe next time I'll add more cinnamon, maybe some almond extract to the filling will kick it up a bit. I also didn't roll the dough, I just pinched it together as another reviewer said and it worked fine. I melted 1/4 cup butter for the top but didn't need all of it. I did add brown sugar to the butter and completed with honey all over the top crust. As others said, 45 minutes is too long. 35-40 is all that is needed.

Um, really, really addictingly good.  We had some exactly as the recipe states, and that was good, but then we tried them drizzled with a little honey, and that took them over the top (4 star w/o honey, 5 with).  Tasted like ChiChi's Fried Icecream, if any of you remember that...  I'll be making these again, soon!

This is a wonderful super easy dessert! This was gone in no time, and I loved it. Only addition I made was to drizzle the top with honey straight out of the oven. It's very important that this cools completely before cutting into squares. I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you :)

This was certainly a very quick and easy dessert to make. A bit too rich and sweet, and everyone agreed the sugar, cream cheese and butter can all be cut down to make this a five star recipe.

This is a great recipe and a family favorite. I usually modify recipes and only make two minor modifications to this one. Used half brown sugar half white sugar. This makes is a bit more flavorful. Also increased the vanilla almost double. This comes out great every time. Agree with the previous reviewer. Don't bother rolling out the rolls. Just lay them in the pan and pinch the seams together. Done this several times and it is quicker, easier and cleaner than rolling out the dough. The out of the tube size fits perfectly in the 9 x13 pan. Excellent recipe!

I made this dessert for a potluck at work.  Everyone enjoyed it so much I was asked to make it again later in the week for a co-workers birthday.  Had to make it at home as well because the family wanted to try it.  I omit the almonds because I knew some aren't fans of nuts and it didn't need it.  I have given this recipe out more than any other.  Super easy recipe!

this was amazing, and so easy to make. i will say its definitely better the second day. the crescent rolls were a little tough on the first day, but the second day they had softened up some. delicious!

My family loved this.  I always add more vanilla than the recipe calls for, so I just poured and eyeballed that.  I didn't use another 1/2 cup of sugar on the top.  I already had a cinnamon sugar mixture, and I sprinkled that on top.  I do think that it's way too much butter, and I'll cut back on that by half next time I make it.  Half the pan was gone the night I made it and even more the next morning.  It's best within 24 hours for us, and refrigerating it REALLY ampliflies the sweetness.  I'll half next time so we don't have to refrigerate.  Oh, and thanks to all the reviewers who mentioned the honey--that takes it to a whole new level!  Yum!

The 4 of us who were eating this were groaning with pleasure! Don't waste time using a rolling pin, but do spray bottom with Pam. Press a can of rolls on bottom and a stretch a can over the top. I used peach pie filling, and more almond slivers. 35 mintues for me. AWESOME! 6 stars.

I liked the recipe because it called for 3 packages of cream cheese.  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup for the cream cheese mixture.  I did also make it with adding two eggs, this will give it more of a "cheesecake" texture and taste.  But I also like it without the eggs, it make the filling more dense.  The first time I made it when I kept it in for 45 minutes, and this was too dark for my taste.  It came out nice and golden at 35 minutes.  If you like a thicker crust, you can use the larger crescent rolls that are out now.  I still prefer a thinner crust though.

This has become our family favorite!! It is so easy and gets recipe requests every where we take it!  I only use 2 pkg of cream cheese and it works fine.  It is also great with pie filling spooned on top after baking--we love strawberry!

Made this for a family cookout and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe fully and had great results.  Next time, I may try adding an egg to the cream cheese filling, to make it a bit firmer.  Delicious and worth making again and again!

I follow the recipe exactly- except for one thing... I add a layer of fresh blueberries and chopped strawberries in between the cream cheese and top crescent layer. It adds a wonderful layer depth and is very pretty to look at too. I also drizzle with honey when it is fresh out of the oven as recommended by others.  Delicious!!!  Everyone always asks me for the recipe.

Awesome.. Made this to take to a church potluck. I cut back a little on the butter and sugar and it was fine. I used light cream cheese and reduced fat crescent roll dough... delish!

for fewer calories and no less flavor, use low fat crescents and low fat cream cheese.

Loved it. The first time I made this exactly as the recipe states. It was very good as is, but we modified the second time to match our personal taste preference. We decreased the topping sugar by 1/2 and doubled the cinnamon. I serve with honey on the side for those who want a more authentic sopapilla experience! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an amazing, SIMPLE, delicious dessert.  I used 2 (8 oz) cream cheese and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, added an egg as other reviewers suggested.  The first time I baked this I baked it for 45 minutes...it was too long a time...bake it for 35 minutes for perfect sopapilla.

I made this recipe exactly as stated a couple of years ago, took it to a reunion, and everyone loved it! Got requests for the recipe. I've made it several times since. Definitely my go-to dessert for something quick and delicious! You can also make fruit toppings to serve on it, but def not necessary. Make sure you use the "good" crescent rolls...not cheap ones or the sheet kind...makes a huge difference in my opinion. Thanks for a great recipe!

The general recipe was ok and the only reason I rated it this low is because there is WAAAY too much sugar. I thought that 1 1/2 cups was too much,however, decided to follow the recipe as is.  I also cut the 1/2 cup coating to merely 1/8, still horribly sweet (and i love sweet cakes). The recipe would be better with half the sugar indicated.

OMG!!! This cheesecake is fabulous! So easy too, I am known for my cheesecakes and this is definately one of my very favorite! I love the addition of the almonds. Thank you for such a wonderful dessert! (I did only use 1 cup of sugar in cheesecake,and only 1/4 cup sprinkled on top with cinnamon, only because I thought it might be too sweet for my taste)

This is a delicious, easy, quick dessert. I took this to a family dinner and it got rave reviews! The first time I made it, there was just a little bit of butter pooling on the top, so I used 1 T. less the second time, and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The crescent roll dough gives this "cheesecake" a fantastically flaky crust.  Per another reviewer's suggestion I tried this with cherry pie filling but definitely think it is better as a stand alone.  Make it exactly as written and it is delicious.

Wow, this was wonderful.  I followed the directions except I didn't use quite as much butter after reading some of the other reviews.  In hindsight, I don't think it would have hurt to use it all.  I also dropped my bottle of vanilla on the floor so was forced to use almond extract instead.  I don't think I'll ever make it any other way.  I think it went well with the almonds on the top.  This is a great recipe and so incredibly easy, too.

This was my first time making any kind of cheesecake. I did it exactly as the recipe. Very fast and easy and  one world will be enough to describe it: DELICIOUS. I bake it at the evening so it will have enough time to cool during the night, and had it next morning with cup of coffee. It was even better 2 days after that. Try it. You want regret.

This is awesome and sooo easy to make.  I added a teaspon of lemon extract based on other reviews just because I like lemon flavor.  I'm make 3 more of these this week of holiday gatherings!

I have made this Cheese cake two times and the first time I think it was alittle too sweet so the second time around I only put 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/2 cup of white sugar in the cheese mixture along with one beaten egg. On the top I only use 1/4 cup of sugar and the one tsp of cinnamon. It is a keeper and I want to thank Shelly for sharing it.

This was so good!  I took it to our family reunion and the very first person that had a piece asked for the recipe.  Many others followed!  I did add an egg to the cheesecake mixture and added honey to the top as others suggested.  Will be making again many times, in fact I made it last night again!

Now this is what I call a little slice of heaven! So good and rich. And so insanely easy, which is the best part since I don't make very many desserts. I am glad that I found this recipe because it would be a good one to either serve to guests at our house or take if I am asked to bring a dessert somewhere. Everyone that had it tonight loved it and my mom asked for the recipe. The only change I made was I only put almond slices on half of the cheesecake and left the other half without - I wasn't sure if everyone liked almonds that I was going to be serving tonight so thought I would split it evenly. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Made this for a company picnic dessert contest and it was a winner!  Held on the nuts because it was going to feed the masses and people can be funky about nuts, sometimes.  I also drizzled some honey on the top when it came out of the oven (just to add a little shine and go with the sopapilla theme).  Everyone loved it.  My new favorite easy dessert!

This has become my 12 year old son's favorite dessert.  I made this with only two blocks of cream cheese rather than three.  It was still perfect and very rich.  The melted butter with sugar makes the most delicious crust.

I love sopapillas so I knew these was something to try.  Made them for a church potluck and EVERYONE loved them!  All the other desserts were pretty much ignored!  I thought they were tasty and not too sweet - although the baking time is questionable....mine were a little burnt on top, but were still good.  Just didn't look as appealing.  I'll just decrease baking time next batch.

This is an incredibly easy and sooooo good recipe! The only problem is all the fat and sugar, so this is a special occasion recipe! Used it at a baby shower and people kept going back for more and more! Already been requested by the family for Thanksgiving! Thanks!

When you hubby tells you that he could eat the whole pan....you know its good!  Delicious, actually....I used low fat crescent rolls and decreased the sugar to 1c. in the filling and 1/4c. for the topping....plenty sweet. I also decreased the melted butter to 1/4c. It was so addictively yummy. Loved the cinnamon sugar. Will make again....thanks!

Someone made this for our family beach week and everyone raved about it. I loved it. They did say they couldn't find almonds so they had to use pecans, but it is GREAT with pecans!! First served as dessert, but many folks ate it for breakfast he next day.  Thanks for posting this!!!

We love this dessert -- most of the time cut it in bar size pieces.
It is especially easy to make now that you are able to buy crescent
rolls in single sheet so you don't have to close perforations.

Saw this this morning on e-mail.
I needed something quick. I didn't want too much left over so halved the recipe and used a 8x8 square glass pan. Had a little extra dough left. I did not roll the dough just put it in as is. By the time it bakes and is topped and drizzled no one would know. It looked and tasted Fabulous. Oh boy my husband wants this one again, me too!

Yummie!  I actually have cut the recipe into a smaller serving.  Using 1 crescent roll package, and using 1 pkg Philadelphia cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, small amount of vanilla.  I use an 8x8 baking dish, and use half of the crescent roll in the bottom of the dish and the other half on the top.  Cut the topping down to 1/3 also.  It is wonderful and enough for my smaller household.

Such a great recipe!  I didn't change much, just added an egg to the cheesecake mixture.  I think it give it a better texture.  I also omitted the almonds for personal preferences.  This is super simple to make and such a hit at potlucks.  Definitely recommend.

Made this to bring to a friends house for dinner; we wanted something different.  This was a great dish and loved by all!  I read over a lot of reviews and made a few changes.  I used 1/2c brown sugar splenda and 1/2c white sugar in the cheesecake mixture, which cut out 1/2c sugar.  I only used about half of the butter recommended, I just covered the pastry layer with melted butter until it was covered and discarded the rest.  Drizzled honey on top as many suggested - it was plenty sweet and very very good!  I think a little extra vanilla extract would be nice next time.  We topped it with apple pie filling and cool whip - devine!
I used the Pillsbury pastry sheets instead of crescent rolls - this makes it very easy!

Found this with a search for a Mexican dessert. Easy, quick (just leave enough time for cooling) and really delicious. Took it to a friend's fancy Taco Party. Everyone loved it. I used the thin sliced almonds and lots more than the 1/4 C. in the recipe. Served 14 adults with leftovers (and leftovers make a good breakfast).

Easy and delicious.  This is a rich dessert.  It feeds a lot of people because a small piece is all you need.  It doesn't get more simple than this. Enjoy.

Adjusted based on reviews by adding 1 eggyolk to the cream cheese mixture, cut back on the sugar for the centre to 1 cup, increased the cinnamon and very lightly drizzled honey over the top after baking.  Unfortunately, this was a mistake for me.  I found the dessert extremely rich and much too sweet for my taste.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty. The only changes I will make next time is to use only one cup of sugar and half a stick of melted butter.

GOOD STUFF.  Make no changes or additions they are just not needed.  Took it to a gathering of a Plant Swap Group that I am a member of, everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Very easy to prepare and very tasty.

I made these for the first time this weekend and they were a huge hit! I was a little reluctant to make it when I read it was made with crescent rolls, but they tasted great and were super easy to make.

WOW!!!!  
  I have to admit, at the Pot Luck that I took this dish to, it sat in the corner for a while... it didn't have the visual appeal of the professionally prepared cakes/pies with their precision flowers, glazes, etc.  But... once one or two people got there teeth into this desert, it was the most popular of the day and the portions were gone!
   One person asked me for the recipe and I brought it in for them.  Eventually, more than 20 copies were made, and gone in a wink!!!!
  I have recieved more complements for this dish than any other that I have ever prepared.

Great recipe. Followed some of the other suggestions. Used the sheet crescent rolls. I cut back on sugar. 3/4 c in cream cheese mixture and 1/2 c for topping. Did 2 tsp cinnamon and brushed on melted butter. Am going try pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture.

I made this for a neighborhood Labor Day picnic. When we got to the picnic, people had already served themselves and were enjoying their pig, dogs and beer.  I put this dessert on the table, and made sure to take a little right away because it sure smelled good out of the oven.  I am so glad I did! By the time I got my pulled pork, and came back for salad and sides, people were asking me for the recipe! There was practically none left in 5 minutes! (and my daughter wanted to bring brownies!)I did take the suggestion of others and added cherry pie filling.

Made this for the first time today.  Followed the directions exactly.  Turned out excellent.  Husband loves cheesecake, and this item is no exception.  He's not a fan of the almonds, but ate it anyway... almonds and all.  :)  
We sampled it, not wanting to take something that didn't turn out well to our church potluck tomorrow.  Hubby's response, "You might need to leave that here because it might make everyone at church sick," which he followed up with a big grin meaning he really, really, REALLY liked it.
Next time I make it, I might have to add an egg to the cream cheese mixture as another reader suggested, to see what that does to the texture/consistency.

This recipe was fantastic.  Next time I will leave out the almonds basically because I did not like the taste it added.  I had a bite soon after I took it out of the oven and it was wonderful!  It was great after coming out of the fridge, too.  I did spray the bottom of the pan with cooking spray and spread honey over the top.  Yum!

Wow, this was amazing. I took it to a Mother's Day dinner and everyone loved it.  I used Pillsbury Crescent Seamless Dough Sheets instead of the crescent rolls. I plan on making this again.

Delicious!  I did have some difficulty making it though - I tried to use Pillsbury 1/3 less fat dough and I could not get the dough to roll out to 9x13 to save my life.  I ended up doubling the amount of dough (luckily I had two extra cans) and I still couldn't quite get it big enough - I don't know if this is the type of dough I used or if it was due to my cooking inability, but I would not recommend the Pillsbury 1/3 less fat dough just in case.  A definite keeper despite my troubles - everyone loved it.

WoW! This was delicious, I made no changes. I wish there was a way to re-heat it, because the best time to eat it is when it is still warm in the middle! My whole family loved it.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my family all loved it, and devoured in no time!  I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so my opinion is biased.  I will say, for a cheesecake type recipe, even I thought it was pretty good.

Served this at our progressive dinner last night, what a hit.  I also added the honey which is a great idea.  By the time it's cool it has such a nice delicate crunch.  I will try adding fruit next time, all my guests suggested apples.  Everyone wanted to take home leftovers.  This is a keeper I will be making it for our next supper club, yes, I belong to two dinner clubs, Love to Cook!!

How could this be bad? Crescent rolls and cheesecake? YUM! It tasted so devine. I've made this several ways. I love to follow the recipe as is, but add drizzle honey over the top once it's baked and you're ready to serve. You can only add a can of any kind of pie filling. It's just amazing!

I wasn't too sure how much we would like this but it turned out great. This is a rich treat and a little goes a long way. OH! we ran out of almonds and used chopped pecans and it came out just as good.

Super easy, a little expensive to make, guaranteed raves.  I cut sugar in filling in half and took my dessert to the event and topped it there with honey.  ALOT of honey.

With crescent roll dough not coming in sheets, this recipe is all the easier. You can get by with half the sugar and butter. Brush the butter on.

This recipe was excellent!  I made it for my office's Cinco de Mayo potluck and *everyone* asked for the recipe.    The amount of butter was very scary when I poured it on (that amount doesn't drizzle, it pours) but everything cooked up perfectly.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly with just a few exceptions... I'm always heavy handed with my vanilla so I'm sure I used more than the 1 1/2 tsp the recipe calls for.  I also forgot to buy the almonds so I had to leave those out.  And I already had cinnamon sugar made up so I just used a 1/2 cup of that.  But I think it was probably a bit more cinnamony than the ratio in the recipe.  I suggest pinching the seams on the dough before rolling it out and I really only needed it to roll it one direction, to make it wider.  It was long enough for my pan.  This dessert is SOOOO good!!

This was a huge hit!  I received so many compliments on this dessert.  I made only one change - I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture and it turned out fabulous!  I will most certainly be making this again.

So easy and so good.  I've made this twice now and going to make it again tomorrow. Added 1 egg to cream cheese mixture.  Giving it 4 stars bc I had to reduce the sugar amnt by so much otherwise it w/b too sweet and there was too much butter. Reduced sugar by 1/2 C for filling and by 1/4 C for topping for just the right amnt of sweetness.  Reduced butter to 1/4 C. Drizzled honey after taking out of oven. Tried it with cherry pie filling but prefer it w/o.  Will try it tomorrow using apple pie filling.

I don't usually ever say something is too sweet but this was. The topping would be best to cut back. It didn't go over very well. I had lots of leftover when I left the party.

This was amazing! The top becomes almost like creme brulee- everyone LOVED it and it was so easy. I used the crescent dough without seams which was really helpful- I only had to stretch it out a little on the sides. No rolling necessary.  As for changes, I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture which made it nice and fluffy. I used the whole amount of buter, but I think 1/4 cup would have been plenty. I think next time I'll try it with apple filling too. I'm sure it would go really well with the sugar/cinnamon crust on top.

Easy and very versatile. I cook this about once a week and add different  things to it such as a verity of fruits, And nuts. Top with butter sugar and shreaded coconut. Makes a nice breakfast with coffee.             
 02/21/15 made this with adding 1 tsp of Almond extract to cream cheese and sugar mix! It was much better if thats possible!

It wasn't that bad at all. I think the butter topping was a bit too much and should be reduced to 1/4 cup with a bit less sugar. It cooked through completely with about 15 to 20 mins extra in the oven. I made the mistake of including the honey with the butter mixture and it made for a nice gooey topping.

I made this for work one day and was a great success. I get requests for it all the time. I have also added blueberry pie filling under the last layer of crescent rolls

Excellent, always a hit at potluck suppers and seems like you worked hard, but so simple to put together.  I've done it with no changes and adding 1 egg to filling.  I like it with the egg that makes the filling a tad denser, but either is delicious.  Thanks so much for this one - a family and friends favorite.

Added one egg like another review suggested and it turned out pretty good. The outer edges got done well before the center. Maybe decreasing the cream cheese to 2 packages instead of 3 would help? Very tasty though!

Most amazing dessert! Definitely don't even need half the butter. I skipped the almonds and drizzled honey over it when it come right out of oven. Heavenly!

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!  Just as promised on other reviews, I got bombarded with compliments and requests for the recipe when I brought this to a restaurant for my parents anniversary.  I did cut down on the butter a little ( I used between 5-6 tablespoons) but you really do want little pools of butter laying on the top crust because when you add the sugar cinnamon and bake it, it makes this delightful crispy, sugary goodness.  It's like getting the benefits of deep frying without the grease or pain the arse.  I also separated one egg, beat the yolk with the cream cheese/sugar/vanilla mixture then whipped the white a couple minutes and gently folded it into the rest of the mixture.  The ONLY thing I'll do different next time is remove a little more of the dough before baking (just where it overlaps too much or gets bunched up in the corners).  Again, OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!!

This was great! I made some changes as some others suggested, reduced the melted butter to 1/4 cup and it was enough, I also sprayed the pan with coconut oil, added a layer of pecans on top of bottom dough and then put honey on top when it came out of the oven. I took it to a quilting group and everyone loved it.  I found it easy to make, I also did not roll out the crescent rolls as another person suggested, just layed them down and it was fine that way, and faster.  Great recipe, thanks!

I brought this to my Bunco group and those who tried it really liked it.  I followed reviewers' advice to cut down on the sugar and butter; but I think I would add all the sugar the recipe calls for if I make it again.

Wonderful dessert.  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  I did cut back on the melted butter that you pour on top.  I only used half the amount and it was enough.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit.  When people took the first bite, I heard alot of "This is SO good."  My only tip would be to cut back on the butter by 2 tablespoons.  I spooned about that much off when it came out of the oven.

This was just ok. I think pie filling would have made it better. My husband really liked it though. He said it was like stuffed cinnamon toast but rich.

If you like cheesecake, and you like sopapillas then make this NOW.  So easy, and sooooo tasty.  I have made this so many times because it's high on the request list from family and work.  I don't even worry about rolling the crescent rolls.  I just roll in into the dish.  Personally don't like the almonds, and it doesn't need it.  If you really want to do into a diabetic coma, you can add a little honey when you serve it.

Oh man, does this recipe deserve 5 stars! So quick, so easy & so very delicious - I was actually surprised! I also love that it's easy to tweak for different tastes. Next time I'll add an egg to the cream cheese mixture & maybe some lemon zest also. This time I served it with raspberry sauce on the side, the possibilities are endless. I was afraid there was too much butter, but baked up perfect & the only sad thing is that there are no leftovers!

Great recipe! I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, cut the sugar in the cheesecake down to 1 1/14 cup, and cut the topping butter and sugar down to 1/3 cup each. This dessert is still plenty sweet with less sugar

Made this for a Mexican-themed group dinner.  Everybody raved about it.  I was a little concerned about reviews that called the dish too sweet, so I added about 1-1/2 tsps. of fresh lemon juice to the filling.  Couldn't taste the lemon.  I also used unsalted butter (recipe doesn't specify).

I made this for our engagement party this weekend and it was the hit of the party! I made 4 dessert but no one could stop talking about this one.  It was the first to go.  I was asked for the recipe numerous times.  I did not have any almonds and so I had to leave them off which I think in the future I will do as well.  I also drizzled honey on top before I served it.  I highly highly recommend this recipe.  Super easy, super good!

Was really really good.  But some notes:  do not waste 1/2 cup butter you only need like 4 tablespoons  with a pastry brush, would have been way too buttery and greasy with the full 1/2 cup.  Also, I only used like 1/4 cup of sugar for the topping and added a little more cinnamon.

This was awesome!!! It's very sweet, so I almost think you can cut down on the sugar mixed with the cream cheese. I followed the recipe, left out the almonds (allergy), and added some raspberry pie filling. This was SUPER easy and I plan on making this again and again. 

I brought it in to work today and people were raving about it!

This is a great recipe!  I forgot to put on the almonds but it turned out great without them.  Took it to a family gathering and everyone raved about it.  I made them the night before and baked them the next day.  I also added honey to the top before serving as others had suggested.  Easy to make and delicious!

The recipe is so easy. I added some meyer lemon zest and juice to wake up the flavor of the cheese. I  cut down the sugar by using stevia(Truvia) in the cheese mixture and half stevia and half white  sugar on top.   I also used low-fat crescent roll dough. It came out yummy!

This was SO good served either warm where the cream cheese is smooth and creamy or chilled where it tastes more like a traditional cheesecake. To-die-for deliciousness all in a quick, easy dessert. What's not to like in the list of ingredients?  The only thing I did differently is use pecans on top instead of sliced almonds. Yummy for my tummy but not for my hips!

5 star rating for taste and ease of preparing!  I was skeptical of the crescent roll dough in it, but it worked great!  So easy to make - buy the crescent roll dough in sheet form it saves a ton of time!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is fantastic! It's so simple, but so yummy! I listened to the reviewers and added an egg to the filling, and doubled the vanilla. I also didn't roll out the dough, and I added honey to the top right after the oven. My entire family loved this recipe!

Very tasty and very easy. Will make again often. Very rich ( not a bad thing ) so it goes a long way. Will cook next time 35 to 40 minutes.

I've made this quite a few times and everywhere I bring it they can't believe how delicious this is.  I saw another recipe just like this but they put honey on it ..... I might have to try that one time but this is soooooooo good as it is I don't know if I want to take a chance on it.

I made this last year for a family dinner. When one of my aunt's brought me a napkin and pen to write down the recipe for her, I was really shocked. Everyone loved it. Luckily, as I had made it the day before(for the 1st time), I actually remembered the recipe. Making it again this year to take. ..ps..also told everyone to go to allrecipes.com...lol

I took this to a potluck, and it was well received, but I thought it was a bit  too sweet.  I will cut some of the sugar when I make it again to better taste the tartness of the cream cheese.  There was another one of these desserts at the potluck, but I was told by a couple of folks that mine was better as it wasn't too cinnamony as the other one was. Looks like this is a dessert that is gaining in popularity.

Took it to a BBQ potluck and everyone liked it.  At least 3 people asked for the recipe.  This was very easy to make and a hit.  I did cut down on the cinnamon sugar on top...only used 1/3 of what the recipe called for.

I made this exactly as recipe reads minus the almonds! Not only was it super easy but it was soooo delicious! My 11 year old niece helped me prepare it & we had so much fun! When everyone came home they were yelling "What smells like heaven?" And "When will it be ready to eat?"! Going into my favorite recipe box for sure!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made.  It was so easy and delicious--got rave reviews at work!  I will definitely make this again.  I substituted half-Splenda and half-Stevia for all of the white sugar to attempt to reduce sugar/carb intake, and my kids did not know.  Thanks, Shelley!

Loved this!  I made it for a family gathering but did not have time to cook it, so it was not until the next day that I cooked it - excellent!  Everyone raved about it.  I did forget to put the honey on, but will do that next time.

Amazing! the only thing I tweaked was to increase the amount of almonds to 1/2 cup. I could eat the whole pan!

This recipe was phenomenal! I made it last week for a Mexican-themed potluck party at my job, and everyone loved loved LOVED it! One guy even demanded I make it again, saying he'd even pay me for it, ha! I'd also made some extra for my boyfriend and I at home and I took some of that with me when I went to see my mom and brother over the weekend so they could try it, and they loved it too - especially my mom! My brother thought it was a bit too sweet, but my mom was borderline obsessed with it! She was even trying to get me to make it again while I was visiting and there while I was visiting, saying we could go out and get the ingredients right then and there! She also asked for the recipe, saying she wanted to make that for whatever next party they have at at her job! This cake was just a huge hit all around. My boyfriend thought it was the best thing I've ever baked (and I've baked quite a few cakes & such, including this banana nut cake that we both love).. I was almost tempted to say the same, but I'm not sure - at the very least, though, it is definitely up there, top 3!

As for the recipe, I pretty much did everything in the original recipe, except I doubled it all in order to make enough for both the party as well as my boyfriend and I at home. Doubling everything went pretty well. I struggled a little with the crescent rolls - trying to stretch it out as the recipe mentioned.. That was what took the longest. Also, I drizzled honey at the end, as mentioned by reviewers.

All I have to say is YUMMO!!! The only thing I did differently was to leave out the almonds due to a nut allergy!!!

Delicious, served it a a pot luck and nothing was left.  I did over bake it a little by accident, because I didn't think the middle was done.  Still great just won't cook so long next time

Look at the list of ingredients, how could it not taste good?  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 40 minutes.  Didn't mix cinnamon and sugar together, just sprinkled generously on top and omitted the almonds.

I was skeptical at first about making a dessert for company using canned crescent rolls, but make no mistake, this is absolutely FANTASTIC! My guests raved about it. When it was done baking I drizzled honey all over the top.......WOW!!!

This recipe is super easy, but if you want to make it even simpler use the pre-made cheesecake filling Philadelphia makes. The almonds are optional too. It's just as good and it saves a lot of time.  People will go nuts for it, trust me!

Wow! Delicious! I had this at my son's home, and my daughter-in-law left it out on the counter.  As I cleaned the kitchen I kept going back and cutting one more small piece..those small pieces ending up looking like someone was devouring the cheesecake, which I was, and decided I'd better stop and save some for others.  It is very addicting in so many ways..The blend of cinnamon, cream cheese and butter is divine! I'm afraid to make it since I live alone...you know as well as I do what will happen.....

This is awesome!  The first time I made this I made it exactly like the recipe.  The only change I have made in the past few batches of this is to half the amount of butter.  The recipe calls for so much that it pooled on sides of the dish.  Cutting it in half not only makes it just a little bit healthier, but it actually tastes better too!  Be sure to spray the bottom of the pan well so it comes out nicely.

This was amazing!! People raved over it and I've given out the recipe twice already! I doubled the ground cinnamon and cut back on the butter. I put all the butter on, but it looked excessive so I spooned some of it off.  This was a big hit! It was the first dessert I have ever made, and was super easy.

This is INSANELY delicious. And addicting, I might add. I had great results using two fat-free cream cheeses and one regular cream cheese, plus low-fat sour cream. Bring copies of the recipe to the party... because you WILL be asked for it!

Easy. Delicious. Absolutely fabulous.  Everyone loves this cheesecake.  Next time I prepare I am going to try with a little bit of warmed up, canned, apple pie filling on top.

I made this dessert for a progressive mexican dinner.  It was a huge hit!  So much so, that several guests asked for the recipe.  I made it again for a pitch in at church and everyone there loved it too.  It's a simple dessert to make, but looks and tastes like it would be difficult.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a hit at a ladies bible study.  This dessert is done 1000 times here in Texas, but usually more gooey and without the almonds.  So it was received like a new dessert, crisper top and more sophisticated.  Thanks!!!

My husband was skeptical about this dessert but ended up loving it.  I followed the recipe exactly other than I left off the almonds (didn't have any) and it is sooooo good warm or cold.  As easy as the no-bake kind but tastes alot better.

I made no changes. It's perfect! I took a full pan to work and it was gone, down to crumbs, within 15 minutes. Very popular! I am repeatedly asked to make this again, which I plan to. Just be aware that stretching the crescent dough to fit the pan was very hard to do for the bottom layer, but the top layer was easy. I'm not sure if this is due to touching the glass casserole dish or the non-stick spray? It still turned out terrific!! 2 thumbs way up!

What an easy desert to make. I followed the exact directions and it turned out wonderful. Everyone at the gathering raved about it. I especially liked it when one lady had only half a piece and quickly went back for the other half! It’s that good. I’ll keep this in my arsenal when I need something quick and easy.

I checked it at 35 minutes thankfully. If I’d given it the full 45 it would have been burnt. At 35 minutes it was already a bit over done. The filling is delicious but the crescent dough gave it a bit of an odd flavor. I think this would be better with something like puff pastry.

It's delicious, I cut a bit of the sugar out of the recipe the second time I made it and I preferred it, not quite as sweet.  Delicious either way though, the family loved it.

I Used one can of rolls and a 8x8 pan. I made it just as the recipe said except for cutting it down to one can of rolls, and it was great. Someone complained of it being too sweet. That's not a reason to give it a bad grade, that's just your personal taste. Cut the sugar down if that's an issue. This was easy and delicious.

I've made this a couple of times, years apart. When I made it last week, my husband exclaimed that it was the best thing I've ever made.  :)  I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture as some others have suggested. Prior to adding the cream cheese mixture, I sprinkled sliced almonds and brown sugar over the dough. On top of the cream cheese mixture, I spread a can of apple pie filling sprinkled with extra cinnamon and brown sugar. Next time, I am considering using two cans of the apple pie filling instead. On top, I used a lot more almonds and used a combination of white and brown sugar (1/2 to 1/3 of mixture was brown sugar), using as much cinnamon sugar mixture as seemed appropriate (I just mixed up a dish of it). I used the same amount of butter called for in the recipe. I baked it for 55 minutes, and the majority (especially the middle) of the cream cheese mixture was still very soft. I'd like to have it set up/dry out more like an actual cheesecake. Any pointers (do I need to add a second egg??)? Anyway, it was absolutely delicious. My son and husband went crazy over it. The topping made it crunchy, which was a real plus for us. I plan to make this again for Thanksgiving dinner.

I will definately make this again.  I received so many compliments.  I did follow others' suggestions and used only 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 cup of sugar for the filling.  I also added an egg.  I also used less butter topping, but next time i will use the full amount.

On Wednesday nights, I cook dinner for 60-70 people.  This is one of the most requested desserts!  I triple the recipe in order to have enough (as well as make a second dessert).  FABULOUS!

It's a hit every time. I am making one change though. I place the sugar cinnamon topping on before dripping the butter. More stays on top and less goes down the side where it can get a bit greasy. I'm a beginning baker and this dessert was my first real success so I keep going back to it. I don't even need the recipe any longer. Thank you.

Made this to take to a potluck. It was a hit. Fairly easy to make. I left the cream cheese out for awhile to make sure it was nice and soft to mix with the sugar.  I found I didn't need to use as much butter as it called for. I'd start with 1/4 cup butter and then melt more if needed.

i'd give this 8 stars if i could!...  easy to make, sweet, but not overly so...  added a touch of nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar topping and followed the suggestion to add a bit of honey after it came out of the oven...  guests went bonkers over it!!...

Recipe was awesome. I took out the extra half cup of sugar in the beginning of the recipe and I mixed in some of a pumpkin jello no bake cheesecake packet with the cream cheese. I also used sweet Hawaiian crescent rolls instead of regular and held back a little on the butter poured on top. Turned out fantasic. I'm sure the original is just as good.

I made this as-is and it is absolutely delicious. I was looking for an easy recipe for a last-minute work thing and wanted something I could quickly  throw together the night before. Normally when I try a new recipe, I will look through the comments to see if there is anything helpful, but I didn't have time on this one. So glad I made it as written as everyone at work loved it and wanted the recipe. Oh wait... I did have to use pecans on top instead of almonds because that is what was in my freezer. Otherwise as-is. Several reviewers added an egg to the filling but I don't see the need as it has a nice consistency without the egg. I did not add honey on top as someone suggested and am glad I didn't as the sweetness was just right without it. I know that real sopapillas are served with honey, but with the cinammon sugar topping and the cheesecake filling, this recipe does not need more sweetness.  I also did not cut down the sugar as some suggested. A definite keeper- will probably make it for Easter.

Was enjoyed by family and friends! Comments that it was really good! Didn’t too honey due to  being plenty sweet with the amount of sugar on top as well as in the filling.  
Will definitely make again.

Great! Easy! I did follow some suggestions to substitute 1 cup ricotta because I had two cups I was trying to use up. Also added an egg as someone suggested. I tried to roll dough out,  but it stuck and tore. I just put it in the 9x13 pan. (greased) It fits perfectly and the small perforations disappear in baking. I just unrolled the top crescent roll crust onto the cream cheese, ricotta, egg, vanilla mixture. Mixed sugar and cinnamon with finely chopped pecans because that’s what I had in the refrigerator. Baked 45 minutes. Perfect. Even better the next day straight from the fridge!

Fantastic and so easy. You can reduce the butter by 1/2 or 1/3 but it was really great with all the butter. I added an egg as one reviewer suggested (definitely do that). Wow. I had no idea this would turn out so crunchy, crispy, gooey. I always thought this recipe was "hard." Will be a go to recipe.  Amazing and beautiful. My fam raved over it.

I made this twice and added 1 egg and 1/2 c. sour cream as suggested by another cook. I used 1 t. almond extract along with 1/2 t. vanilla and added a can of cherry pie filling on top of the cheese cake mixture. Everyone loved it! I made it for my card club ladies and also for a luncheon at church. Several asked for the recipe. I have added this to my favorites list :-)

It was good, but I really think it needs an egg in the cream cheese mixture and a little less butter on top. Otherw iui se, tastes good.

Brought into work and had many people ask for the recipe!  Quick, easy and affordable.  I made it easier by using regular pure vanilla, putting parchment paper down in my pan instead of oil.  I didn't worry about rolling out the crescent dough, I was able to just tap on it to stretch it a bit in the bottom of the pan and then just laid the top layer over the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle the top with the cinnamon and sugar mixed together then put thin slices of the butter on top of that (saves your wrist from mixing the sugar/cinnamon with the softened butter).  Very good!

It was a simple recipe that I did alter a bit by putting less vanilla, but otherwise I made it as written.  Took it on an outdoor picnic. A great hit!

Easy ! The Pillsbury dough sheets are tricky to use but works out ok. I add fresh raspberry to the crème cheese filling and some brown sugar as well to finish the topping. Needs to set overnight in the refrig'. Great hit for a small crowd.

Shelley, you did good on this recipe.  It is so wonderful. People (especially me) love it.  My adult niece who doesn't like sweet desserts kept coming back for more, and this is really sweet. I made it twice but next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will try a reviewers suggestion to not use a rolling pin and to just push it into corners right in the 9x13 dish. It saves time and clean up. You can't miss on this one.

A keeper!  Made a few adjustments so it was less sweet and added an egg, after baking drizzled with honey.  Gone before I could take a picture!

GOOD.  Used one cup of sugar.  Next time do not use crescent rolls.  Try something else.  Cut the sugar for the topping to 1/4 cup and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.

Love this recipe! I wouldn't change a thing. I bring it to work and parties and everyone raves about it. I recommend smoothing the filling out as much as possible to avoid pools of butter.

This is such an easy recipe! I have made it vegan, using dairy free ingredients (some crescent rolls are vegan) and I have made it as written. It’s an amazing and addictive dessert that is very forgiving with what ingredients I’ve had on hand. I’ve made it using one can of crescent rolls In an 8x8 pan. 
 Thank you for posting it!

I made this dessert for a neighborhood Christmas party and it was a smashing success!  I used the Pillsbury crescent roll sheets and that made it so quick and easy! The only change I made was to use reduced fat cream cheese and that seemed to make no difference.  I was asked for the recipe multiple times.  This is now my go-to recipe for potlucks!

Sweet Jesus.... This is so damned good, it'll make you wanna slap yo mamma. Not kidding! Add an egg to the cream cheese mixture before baking. It takes better cold, believe it or not, so chill it before eating.

Everything I was hoping it would be. Rich and smooth cheesecake with a crispy sugary crust on top. The almonds are a nice touch and a little mild flavored honey makes it incredible. I found the crescents fill a 9x13 enough its not worth getting a roller dirty. Just pinch closed the perforations and move on. Great recipe thanks!

I would definitely make this again. This was the first time I made it and didn't make any changes. In the future, I will probably use less melted butter, it seemed like a lot and just pooled on the top prior to baking. However, the finished product wasn't greasy or too buttery (if there is such a thing).

I followed the recipe with one small change I used pecans because I didn't have any almonds.The video said you could put them on before adding the top layer so this is what I did then put the top layer on followed the directions then added a few pecans on top for looks.
Be sure to keep a check on your time in my oven it only took 30minutes to cook
This is a very simple recipe to follow don't change a thing except maybe the nuts as I did.
We all loved it,my husband said it's his new favorite cheesecake!!
I will be making this many times in the future.

I made this for a friend's Mexican themed New Year's Eve party.  The dessert was a big hit!  The only change I made was the honey drizzle on top.  I had caramel sauce so I used that instead.  I think this is even better the next day after being refrigerated overnight!  Delicious with coffee in the a.m.!  I'll be making this again!

I prefer this to the 2 package of cream cheese version.  Much more like true cheesecake.  I did cut down on the butter like another on line recipe.  It doesn't need all the fat.  Next time I may use the low fat crescent rolls since I already use the reduced fat cream cheese.

This is delicious! I changed it a little after reading reviews. I used 3 cans of cresent dough and only 1/2 cup of sugar with the cream cheese, added 1 egg to the cheese mixture and sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on bottom layer of dough before adding cheese mixture. It cooked on the top really fast and was doughy in the middle on the bottom because I could not leave it in the whole time. Next time I will turn down to 325 degrees so it gets done equally on top and bottom.(may be because I have gas oven). On top I drizzled honey. It was very delicious and everyone loved it! This will be a regular at our house. Thanks!

I'm not sure what happened, but this did not turn out for me as expected.  I followed the recipe, but instead of getting a layer of cheesecake between the layers of crescent rolls, the cheesecake layer melted into the dough and I ended up with what amounted to a 2 inch thick cinnamon cheesecake flavored pastry crust.  I only baked it for 30 minutes instead of the recommended 45, but it was still too long, apparently.  I rated it 4 stars because the taste was good and perhaps I did something wrong (don't want to blame the author for my mishap :) but I was disappointed in the end result.  I'm hoping someone may have a suggestion as to how to avoid this in the future, because it looks like a good recipe and I'd really like to try eating it as it is intended to be made!!!

As written I feel this is a four star recipe. Pretty darn good, but not stellar. However, if you add an egg to the cream cheese mixture it will easily and deliciously turn this into a five star dessert. And just as a matter of preference, I also cut the amount of butter used in half and find it still to be plenty.

This was a big hit at our office!! This was beyond easy to make, and I just let it cool in the fridge overnight. On a side note, if you make this late at night, your house will smell like sweet cinnamon when you wake up in the morning. That's another win!!

This is my new go to dessert.  I get rave reviews wherever I take it.  I haven't made it with the almonds because a lot of people, including my husband, are not fans.  The one thing I did change is the amount of butter.  The first time I made it the whole dish was swimming in butter.  I now melt 1/2 stick and brush it on liberally, and typically don't use the whole amount.  You can't ask for an easier, mighty tasty dessert.

This was really easy to make. I was able to find the crescent sheets that don't have perforations at my little Safeway. I think you can add the sugar to taste before you bake it.  The baking didn't seem to change the sweetness  that much. I went sparing on the melted butter, just enough to brush on.  I added thinly sliced fresh pear to the top of the cream cheese layer just before putting on the top layer of crescent roll dough and that added a little fruit flavor.  Mine baked in about 35 minutes so watch the baking time.

I was very easy to make, and I followed the recipe carefully. The only thing I did differently was cut the dessert into much smaller squares (1.5"x1.5" roughly). This dessert is very rich, so the smaller-sized squares helped people be more in control of the amount of sugar and fat they wanted to consume.

This is a great recipe, I use it all the time for cook outs.  I like to make it in a foil pan so I don't have to worry about clean up.  I use 1/4 cup butter as I have found 1/2 a cup tends to pool up after cooking.  Finally, I have been using crescent sheets instead of the crescent rolls dough.  It comes without seams so you can skip the rolling or pinching of the dough.  I hope you enjoy it as much as my family!

Made it today, it was pretty good. I did make a change, I added home made apple pie filling because we have a lot of apples to use up. Everything else was the same. It turned really good.  Although I wish I had some vanilla ice cream! We had it warm and are looking forward to it cool.  Might even be good in the fridge. Fast and simple. Thanks for sharing.

I've made this twice now and it is fantastic!  I did follow 2 adjustments that helped.  Add an egg to the cream cheese and use half the recommended butter.  I tried it both ways and it was great but the tweaked way is better.  One tip I would give is to really roll out the crescent dough and trim away the excess.  The more dough you have the less cheese cakey it is.  My kids call this churro cheese cake since the topping tastes almost exactly like a churro.

I am sure this would have been a 5 star recipe even without my changes.  I used  puff pastry instead of crescent rolls and a larger (than 9x13) baking pan, and added 1 small container of smooth ricotta cheese in addition to the 3 cream cheeses.  My family went crazy for this.  Thank you for the recipe!
If you decide to use the puff pastry instead of the crescent rolls, you don't need to use too much butter.  Just brush on the butter. (about 4-5) tablespoons.

I give this a 4 Star rating because of the ingredients and the taste of the final dish. However I did tweak it as follows: I used one cup of sugar I used two packages of cream cheese and I added one egg. I also cut down on the butter. I sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar on the bottom of the pan before the first pastry layer, again on top of it; more went on top o on top of the cream cheese mixture. Before going into the oven I gave another sprinkle oh cinnamon-sugar on top. It's quick together he oven and a nice finish to dinner with a cup of coffee or tea.

Very tasty, and it makes the whole house smell like churros while you make it! Based on the feedback from other reviews, I made the following changes:

-Used two packages of regular cream cheese and a half package of light cream cheese.
-Started with only 3/4 cup of sugar, and added a little more to taste. For me, just over 3/4 c. was sweet enough. 1.5 cups would be way too sweet!
-Added a little more cinnamon
-Sprinkled a little of the cinnamon-sugar mix on the bottom crescent roll layer.
-Melted a few tablespoons of butter and brushed it on the top. Not sure why a 1/2 cup of butter is called for when a few tablespoons will do!
-Used only about a 1/4 cup of the cinnamon sugar mix on the top layer, and it was still generously sugared.
-No nuts.
-Used an all-natural crescent roll dough instead of the standard Pillsbury rolls. It still cooked up fine, and tastes great. 

It cooked a little faster than the time listed, maybe 30-35 minutes.

Would make this again for sure! It is very rich, so thinking that using more light cream cheese may cut the richness a little.

I have made this several times...always following the recipe but sometimes adding nuts to a the bottom layer or pie filling (cherry is the favorite)...it is always a hit.  Making it again this weekend for softball girls and I do NOT expect any left-overs.  Thank you for this great go-to recipe.

Made it exactly to the recipe, other than grinding whole almonds for the top cause that's what I had!  I overbaked it a little, but everyone still said they really liked it. It was really easy, quick to get in the oven & yummy, so I'll be making it again!

Used a little less butter and sugar on the top, and added a few chocolate chips on the top.  Have had several requests for the recipe along with rave reviews. And its so easy!

This dessert is awesome.  I followed the comments of others and cut back on the amount of butter, because you don't need as much as it calls for to pour over the top.

this is the best cheesecake dessert I have ever had,  I take it everywhere that calls for a pot luck, along with the recipe as everyone wants it.
I have played with using lower fat options (cream cheese and even with the crust) and sugar subs and it still tastes great (mind you never all at the same time,  (insert ugly face smily here, LOL)

Of of my family's favorite desserts. The crescent rolls don't need to be a deterrent to making this scrumptious dessert. Use parchment paper. Tear off a sheet larger than 9" x 13". Carefully unroll the crescent roll dough and lay it flat on the parchment paper. Tear off another sheet of parchment paper approximately the same size as first. Lay it on top of dough and gently use your rolling pin to flatten your dough to the required size. Remove the top parchment paper and transfer the dough to baking dish with bottom parchment paper. Once dough placed is in the baking dish like you want it gently peel the parchment paper from it. Repeat for top layer of crescent roll dough. Always best done when dough is cold.

Delicious. I loved it just as the recipe is written. Next time, instead of sliced almonds, I'll try using Apple compote with pecans.

Made this recipe when looking for a dessert to bring when invited to a taco dinner. Made just as written- also a little worried about using the crescent roll dough, and most sopapillas I have had included honey...but everyone loved this cheesecake. My whole house smelled like cinnamon rolls! So happy to have a new go-to unusual dessert recipe in my book!!

Wow! Simple, yet amazing! Made this for Christmas Eve and had other desserts -- but everyone ate this  and came back for more until it was all gone! I did not use the almonds -- but everything else as written. Amazing! Would highly recommend this recipe!

Made it exactly according recipe with the tiny addition of 1/4 tsp almond extract because I happened to have some on hand. So delicious but incredibly rich, a little goes a long way. Next time I might make a half pan. So easy to make, will definitely make again. Thanks!

I read and followed the options of adding an egg and cutting down slightly on the sugar. I also drizzled honey on the top. 45 minutes was too long for my oven. I served it at our Moose Lodge weekly Saturday night dinner and it was a BIG hit. It's a keeper!

It's sweet and it's a fast bake but on the whole, kind of a sub par recipe. 2 stars.

Delicious! I cut mine into 20 servings since it is so sweet. The crescent roll is a great shortcut to a surprising and different dessert. I used brown sugar with the cream cheese and still tastes great. I also drizzled the too with honey. Hope my mom will enjoy for Mothers Day!

I changed this recipe according to another persons review. I used an egg and 1/2 cup sour cream and two blocks of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I added raspberry jam to the top of cream cheese. It was a very good dessert day at my house! I like reading how people change things according to what they have on hand. Gives me different ideas and such. To those who think it's wrong to change the recipe and comment on them, boo hoo. It's still a free country, last I checked.

Love love love this!!! Made it for new years one year and making it again tonight for a Mexican food themed pot luck. Im not much of a sweets fan, but this dessert is perfect! All the right sweetness. Not rich, but not bland. I didn't change anything though one time I did make it without almonds due to a nut allergy, but I'd have to say it's better with almonds.

I made this recipe with "multigrain" crescent rolls which I had bought by mistake. I don't think it made any difference to the taste but maybe a wee bit healthier. I also added fresh cut up peaches, mango and apricots before adding the last layer of crescent roll. I think that made it better and would add even more fruit next time. I found the filling to be a little gooey and am trying to think of a way to make it more like the firmness of regular cheesecake. I'm thinking of adding eggs next time and par cooking it before adding it to the pan. Input from anyone else out there would be appreciated. It go rave review from all who ate it, including my husband who doesn't like cheesecake (finds it too rich) so I will definitely be making it again.

I made this for a Mexican themed dessert to go with a family Christmas gathering.  It was a huge hit!  They all raved about it non stop.  It was very easy to make. The only change I made was I added an egg to the cream cheese mixture.  Also, it wasn't noted whether to grease the baking dish. I did not grease it and the squares came out fine.   I made this ahead if serving time and refrigerated it till serving. Highly recommend!

This was really easy to make and was very delicious! The only problem I had was with the top crust ending up very hard - almost impossible to eat with a fork! Has anyone else had this problem, or have any advice for the next time I make this? I don't think I overcooked it because the rest of the dessert was absolutely PERFECT!

I can't even BEGIN to tell you how many compliments this recipe has received!  Too many to count, that's how many. :-)  The only addition I made was to add sliced strawberries to the inside, layering them comletely across the cream cheese.  Yummmm

Made it for Cinco de Mayo work potluck. Was a huge hit with everyone and several people wanted the recipe. A coworker got the recipe and made a double batch for a party at her home and it was a huge hit there and completely demolished. She kept to original recipe and I added more cream cheese following others comments. Either way it was excellent. You can't go wrong with this one.

This dessert was so delicious.  The first time I made it, it came out wonderful.  It didn't fall apart when I cut the pieces into bars.  Like some of the other comments, I too wasn't sure about the crescent rolls, but it was very tasty.  It was easy to make, appealing to the eye, and most of all--it tasted great! A definite keeper!

Tonight is now the 5th time I have made this recipe, and the requests keep coming. This is by far the EASIEST and probably cheapest recipe I have ever done for potlucks, and it has gotten RAVE reviews from coworkers. If you need something quick for a get together, definitely give this a try!

Delicious!  I don't think there needs to be as much sugar or butter on top though. I used my own judgment and cut down a bit the next few times I made it.  It's even better served with fruit topping.  This recipe is a keeper!

Just ok for me.  A fairly expensive dessert to make with the  crescent dough and cream cheese and I didn't feel it was worth the cost.  I much prefer the taste and texture of a traditional cheesecake which is only a little more work.  The bottom crust seemed 'bready' to me.  I did add an egg to the cheese mixture to make filling smoother, and reduced the butter a little.   Probably won't make again.

This is easy and delicious! Always a hit.  I like to add 1tsp almond extract to the cream cheese mixture as well.

This is one of the easiest recipes I've tried. I couldn't make it exactly because I didn't have all the ingredients. But still came out very well.

I only had one can of crescent roll so used that for the bottom. Two packages of cream cheese. Didn't have enough white sugar so used that for the cream cheese. For the top layer used left over puff pastry. On top of the puff pastry I mixed half powdered sugar and half brown sugar. Melted beautifully on top of the puff pastry. I used a pie dish instead of a 9x13.

The dish came out great! The pastry on top was perfect. Crispy, flaky and gooey. Everyone loved it. I think next time I'll use puff pastry again but also add a little bit of cinnamon to the cream cheese. This one is a keeper.

For the ease of this recipe it deserves 5 stars. It tasted very good, but it seemed to be missing something. Maybe a little lemon juice or zest? I will definitely make again. I used the crescent dough that's in a sheet rather than perforated. It couldn't have been easier. Thanks for sharing.

My family loves this recipe, but I always have a problem working with cresent roll dough, so I substitute puff pastry sheets from the grocery store.  It is excellent.

I made this very simple recipe yesterday and it came out awesome. I had actually tried another recipe in this site similar to this one that came out really soggy. The difference was the definitly the crunchy topping of sugar and cinnamon with almonds. Will make again.

awesome! i was looking for an easy recipe for a mexican themed dinner and found this...sooo easy especially if you are not a baker like me.it was delicious, the hit of the evening.  you can probably use a little less butter and sugar  for the drizzle if you are concerned but you're not going to eat this everyday so you might as well enjoy  it!

So so so good and easy to make. Even with the crescent rolls, it doesn't taste overly store bought. When I make this I use a smaller round dish, and use the left over crescent roll/filling to make "cookies" (make a "dumpling" with crescent roll and the filling inside, dont worry with the edges arent perfectly closed, roll in the suger/cinnamon mixture and bake until a toothpick comes back clean... about 20 minutes.) Changes I make to this dish are minimal: smaller pan, I add an egg and cinnamon/nutmeg to the filling, I add extra layers of nuts and cinnamin sugar, and only use 1/2 a stick of butter.  Even better cold the next day! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was good, but I thought it tasted a little store bought with the crescent rolls. Quick and easy though!

Excellent recipe.  I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  This recipe is better than other Sopapilla Cheesecakes I've made in the past.  It has more volume and better flavor.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Let me just say that I never take the time to write a review but I have to tell you about this dessert. I was asked to make this for a co-workers birthday today. When I read the recipe and say Crescent Rolls I actually turned up my nose thinking this was not going to be good. So I decided to make a separate dessert along with this one in case no one liked it. I want to say that it got rave reviews. It was gone before even half of the other dessert was eaten. This was a winner and am giving the recipe to several that requested. I sprinkled powder sugar to roll crescents in and after the cream chees layer I added a layer of pecans before I layed the 2nd crescent layer. It was so good I had to let you all now. You must try this...

This recipe was perfect; I just added 1 egg to the cream cheese mixture to make sure the filling would hold together.  So yummy...I brought this into work for a birthday party we had, and they were gone within seconds.  Today, I am making them again, but I'm adding a layer of cherry pie filling before the final top layer...thought it would be the perfect dessert for our Memorial Day Weekend BBQ!  :o)

A really excellent dessert. I served at a party last night and folks loved it. It's very sweet, so I cut the pieces for serving much smaller than indicated. We all agreed we would probably name the dessert Benuelo Cheesecake...since the taste reminded us of benuelo's rather than sopapillas. No matter, you aren't going to go wrong with this recipe.

This was delicious and so easy! I reduced the butter by almost half and didn't miss it. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. All of the ladies at my Cinco de Mayo party asked for the recipe. It was a huge hit! In the future I'll be making a half recipe with one can of crescent roll dough and 2 blocks of cream cheese in an 8x8 pan so I don't end up with so many tempting leftovers.

These were awesome!  Next time I think I can use less sugar and butter to top it with before baking.  1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. sugar just seemed to be too much.

I am a TERRIBLE baker, smuck up everything, but this my friends was a masterpiece that not even I could have messed up ;)  It was so simple (I didn't even really measure things exactly...probably why nothing ever turns out good!) AND INSANELY DELICIOUS!  Another reviewer said it is hard to stop eating it...agreed, it is dangerous!  A 'Must Try'!

My family thinks this is the bomb. Anyone who wants to discount this is off base. I did add the egg to the cream cheese mixture and add the honey after baking. It is sooooooo good. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent! Did add 1 egg to cream cheese mixture and apple pie filling on top.  Reduced butter to 1/4 cup.  Drizzled honey after taking out of oven and served cold next day.  Next time will reduce sugar by 1/4 cup for both filling and topping.

In my daughter's words - this is amazing! I reduced the sugar in the cream cheese mixture by 1/2 cup, reduced the butter by 1/4 cup, and increased the almonds by 1/4 cup.  This is definitely a keeper.

This dessert was excellent from the first bite!  My guest took home my printed recipe, so I had to print out another one.  It was great at room temperature after cooling for about 3 hours, and it was also great the next day cold from the fridge.  I did not add an egg to the cream cheese mixture, but I did drizzle honey on top after it came out of the oven.  EXCELLENT DESSERT!  I can hardly wait to make it again for a large group of ladies.

Made this for our Super Bowl Party.  It was a BIG success, with many requests for the recipe.  Creamy, not too sweet with the crunch of the sopapilla and sliced almonds. Wonderful!

I have made this three times in the last two weeks---everyone LOVES it! I used a few ideas from other reviewers: added one egg to the cheese mixture to fluff it up a bit, sprayed my pan lightly with cooking spray, and drizzled honey on top when I took it out of the oven. I don't use any nuts in case someone is allergic. Also, I only needed to bake it 38 minutes. A new favorite! Thanks, Shelley!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed some of the suggestions and drizzled honey on top of the cheesecake which made for a crystallized sweet ending.  You will love this recipe!

This dessert is absolutely delicious! I made for some girlfriends to go with Mexican menu of chicken enchiladas and pico. Perfect! Put the honey on top when you pull out of oven. This stuff is great (maybe even better) the next day. Thanks Shelly!

My mother-in-law made this for a recent family reunion!  It was a huge hit!  I live in South Texas and took it to work.  Many of my co-workers are Hispanic.  They loved it and said they were going to make it for their families.  Was it exactly a "Hispanic" dish, no.. but they liked the twist on an old favorite.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these for my husband to bring to his office party and they were a hit!  I can't wait to make them again for us!  I thought it was too much butter at first, and thought it may flop, but it worked and wasn't greasy.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I made this for my Bunko group which was having a Mexican themed evening.  Everyone loved it and begged me to send them the recipe.  It is very rich, however, so make sure to tell people to save room if you are serving it after a large meal.

Ok, I'm probably not being completely fair to this recipe cause I did change it a little, but overall, I felt like it was just average tasting. (I added brown sugar on top instead of white is all I changed) It was very attractive looking moist and super easy to make, but I wouldn't make it again.  I'm looking for a recipe that I will serve company and they won't be able to stop talking about how incredible the dessert is.  This isn't that recipe.

I made this as a dessert for my boyfriend's birthday celebration with his family. Talk about nervous! However, this dessert was EXCELLENT! Everyone raved about it and it was so easy to make. I made it exactly as the recipe said but we drizzled honey on it right before eating. WE LOVED IT!!!

I had 2 tubes of crescent dough I wanted to use up, and had been browsing through Pillsbury's site looking for a recipe.  I came across this one by accident because it was featured in an Allrecipes daily email, and voila! Crescent dough! It is really too good--my husband couldn't keep his hands off of it, and actually asked if I was trying to kill him.  I do have a cookbook, "How to Kill Your Husband", and it has all these really rich recipes. LOL I did add 1 egg to the filling as one person suggested, as most cheesecakes do have eggs.

Made this for a party and everyone loved it... they asked me to send it to them. It is simple, but great. Did add the honey over the top, but not sure if it added much.

This is really really good - and an excellent way of introducing Cheesecake to my husband.  I did cut the sugar a little in the (Neufchatel) cream cheese.  I only used half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, which was fine - but next time I'll up the cinnamon... A LOT.

I have been making this recipe for some time now and have never been disapointed. I have occasionally added a can of apple pie filling on top of the cream cheese mixture. Makes a whole different kind of dessert.

This is the best dessert I have ever made. It was so easy to make and was gone in minutes. My friends were burning their tongues just because they couldn't wait!

This is very yummy and EASY!  Took this to a Potluck tonight and got compliments from EVERYONE!  It also turns out pretty with the cinnamon sugar almond combo all over the top!  I did drizzle lightly with honey after baking, may drizzle a little heavier next time (adds a nice authentic taste).

Very easy! If yo need something for a party with not too much effort, this is your recipe.  It is very sweet.  I sprinkled some cinnamon on the bottom crust before putting in the cream cheese mixture.  It had a great flavor!

I made this dessert for our superbowl party.  It was a huge hit.  I made one change and added some fresh blackberries (cooked down with a bit of sugar and corn starch) on top of the cream cheese mixture.  It gave it a wonderful fruit punch. This was a wonderful surprise for my family/friends.  They all asked about the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.
