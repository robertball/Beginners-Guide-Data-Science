My wife and kids think this is a great bread. We really enjoy the flavor. I experimented and substituted honey for the sugar. It was great! The conversion for the yeast is .25 oz. = 2-1/4 tsp.

I really liked this.  Made some changes...used 1 1/4 cups orange juice (no water) fresh squeezed; used canola oil instead of margarine; used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour; and 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar.

There was no light orange color -- but I suspect the whole wheat flour masked it.  Lightly tangy, a hint of orange, tender...it made the best french toast I've ever had.  

Thanks for the recipe!

I love to make this bread in the evening and use it the next day for french toast.  Try serving it toasted and topped with honey or apple butter.  It's wonderful!

This recipe made a very good bread.  I took some to work and it was a real hit! I sliced it and put a cinnamon roll frosting (orange flavor) on it. It's great at breakfast too.  I gave it 4 cards on the premise that nothing is perfect.

Most people who bake bread don't purchase yeast in the small packages as it is so much more costly.  The measurement should include fast rising and reg yeast in teaspoons.  Didn't really care for the flavor, though

Help!  I'd love to make this recipe -- but, how can I make it vegan?  What is a proper substitute for egg and margerine in a bread machine?

My bread was very heavy, not light and fluffy.  I tried it twice to see if I had done something wrong.  I did warm the O.J. Maybe that was the problem.  Was it suppose to be cold?  I did like the flavor.  I will try 1 more time.

On it's own: probably about 3 stars.  This could be my fault as I assumed that in using fresh oranges for the zest, I should be using those oranges for the orange juice listed in the recipe.  I think that (gasp) bottled orange juice would be better in this bread, as my loaf did not have any sweetness, very little orange color, and the zest left a somewhat bitter taste (yes, I was careful not to use the pith) very similar to a homemade orange marmalade. The bread does smell divine while baking, and is DELICIOUS as french toast the next morning.  Also, sliced and toasted with butter and honey is definitely 5 star, so I've split the difference and given this unique recipe 4 stars.

Made this in the evening to use for breakfast the next day.  I liked this as French toast, but not sure I would want it any other way.  I used two whole oranges and made juice out of them in the Blendtec - no water.  I think this would make delicious orange-cinnamon rolls as well.

This bread turned out great.  I reduced the flour to 3 1/4 cups.  Instead of baking in the machine, I set it to dough, breaded the bread and baked in the oven. I also made a powdered sugar glaze with a little orange juice and about a tsp orange zest.  Turned out very nice.

I omitted the orange zest since I didnt have any on hand and the recipe turned out well. Has a very mild orange flavor. I was hoping for abit more of an orange taste but possibly with the orange zest added it might be more flavorful. All in all tho I was pleased with the turnout and would make this again.

I made this on 2/6/05 and used reconstituted orange juice, reduced the sugar to 3 Tbs., the salt to 3/4 tsp., the jarred orange zest to a scant 2 Tbs., and the yeast to 1½ tsp.  Did add 1 tsp. of water to the mix cycle as it was just too loose, and another 1/4 tsp. to the knead cycle at the beep.  It turned out very good, but a bit mild on the orange flavor.  Next time I would delete any water in the original mixture, use 1-1/3 cups orange juice, and use the whole 2 Tbs. of jarred orange zest.

This bread was very easy to make, and almost raised the top of the bread machine when baking! :) Next time I will probably transfer into a loaf pan and bake in the oven to make it prettier...but just because it wasn't pretty doesn't mean it tasted anything less than great!! I followed the recipe, with the exception of using 1 cup Simply Juice OJ and 3 tsp. Penzey's minced orange peel (because I had no fresh oranges).  I should have probably used more, but this was very refreshing and not a normal sandwich bread.  The best part was that I followed previous reviewers' comments and used this to make french toast this morning and it was awesome!  I will definitely be making this again.  Tastes like a bakery bread, perfect to "show off" to your family or friends. :)

When I made this I had the eggs and the orange juice room temp and warm water not hot.  Put all the liquid ingredients in first.  Made the yeast rise very well.  Had a wonderful flavor and everyone loved it.

Granted, I left out the zest (I don't eat oranges by themselves so...no zest), but otherwise as directed and it smelled amazing but the actual flavor wasn't greatly noticeable. Perhaps some orange extract may help for the zestless.

Very good but i forgot to buy an orange so I omitted the zest which would have made it much more orangey. Still a nice bread but i miss the zest.

One of my favorite bread recipes. I make it in my bread machine. Perfect for French toast. Have your fresh butter ready when this is done... you won't be able to resist a hot slice with the melted butter !

Baked up nice and big. Very tasty and fluffy. I was hoping for a more "dense bread," but was not disappointed with these results. It just wasn't what I wanted at the time. Especially delicious toasted with a bit of butter and cinnamon sugar.

I wanted to make Christopsomo, Greek Christmas bread, in my bread machine. My 1st attempt (with my own adaptation of the recipe) was a disaster. Then I saw this recipe & realized with the addition of spices, nuts & dried fruit I would have Christopsomo with a fraction of the the effort. And VOILA, it worked perfectly! (In the interest of complete transparency, I did say the required prayers over the bread machine!)

I had too many oranges and decided to try this.  It's a good bread--nice and light for breakfast, slightly sweet.  I used 1-1/4 fresh squeezed OJ (and omitted 1/4 c water), and substituted one cup of wheat flour for one cup of bread flour.  We'll make this again when we have extra oranges!

I think this recipe has the potential to be  better than it turned out for me.  I think the problems I had with it were my own fault. I didn't have bread flour, and I wanted to make it healthier, so I used whole wheat flour and some all-purpose flour.  I used 1 and 1/4 cups of orange juice, no hot water, as someone else recommended. I think that was a mistake, my loaf didn't rise, I think the hot water is essential to activating the yeast. The orange flavor was good though. My loaf wasn't all the way done either, I should have used the whole wheat bread setting, since I used wheat flour. If you follow this recipe exactly as outlined, it probably turns out just fine.

I made it with a medium large orange. I zested the orange, saving ~1 tsp for the frosting. I then shaved off the 1/2 the pith (next time I would use all the pith), pulled the core, then threw it into the blender (saving maybe 1Tbs for the frosting). For good measure based on other's suggestions of being too bland I added ~1tsp of dried orange peel + 5-10 drops of orange extract. Adjust your moisture to make it very slightly sticky while it is kneading by adding water as needed. Yum!

I made this exactly as instructed on the Basic setting and it rose too high resulting in the top not being baked through. Tips on what to change next time?

The remainder of the loaf was tasty though.

I made this by hand (stand mixer & oven) because I don’t have a bread maker and it turned out great. I also  used blood oranges instead of “normal” oranges. The more intense flavour of the blood oranges worked really well in  this bread.

I used unbleached all purpose flour. Fresh squeezed orange juice, and added 1 c craisins  and 1 c pecan/walnut mix. (was at the bottom of both containers and wanted to use them up) Brushed top with egg wash and sprinkled torbinado sugar on top.  Baked at 350 till completely cooked. OMG, this bread is delicious!!!!!! Thank you for posting this recipe!!!!

Love that fragent smell of orange from the bread and the citrus flavor. I did use a fresh orange for juice and zest. I added about a tablespoon of pulp from orange and a tablespoon of dried orange peel. I love this bread warm without any spread on it.

Turned out really great.  The next time I make this, I will use at least a cup of whole wheat flour.

The  only changes I made were I used white spelt flour and doubled the orange zest. It was delicious, will definitely make again, I might try lime zest and ginger spice next time. This recipe is a keeper!

Yummy and easy- However after it was in the bread machine I noticed it looked almost like a batter bread and was very sticky. I did add another 1/2 flour and it was perfect. I did go heavy on the orange zest since I like a strong orange flavor. 
I buy the yeast in the giant package at Costco and I find 2 tsp works well. This is a keeper and will be great to have for overnight guests.

Very good.  A common complaint in the other reviews was that the orange flavor was not strong enough, so I did twice as much zest as the recipe called for.

This makes great sliced bread for PB&J sandwiches!  My only changes to the recipe is that the cup of OJ I use is the frozen reconstituted WITHOUT adding the water to the OJ - it gives it more of an orange taste and a little bit sweeter.  I also leave out the zest and put a teaspoon of orange flavoring.  Oh, and I never actually bake in my bread machine, I only do the kneading and rising...I prefer to do the final rise in a bread pan and to bake it in my oven to get a regular loaf type bread.  The bread machine loafs are always kinda strange shaped with that paddle hole in one end that bothers me.

Didn't care for the orange taste as much as I thought. Seemed too orange. Otherwise a good recipe, easy to follow.

I've made this bread several times now.
It is simply delicious.
I substituted the hot water for orange juice (didn't warm it), and replaced the orange zest with a 4 oz. container of orange rind/peel. The orange rind really gives the bread a wonderful orange flavor and texture.

This recipe is defiantly a keeper 
and is oh-so-yummy.
