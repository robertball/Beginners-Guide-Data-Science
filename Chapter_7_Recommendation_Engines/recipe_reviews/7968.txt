Great cake!  The crunchy layer on top was so yummy.  I read one of the reviews that said there was not enough chocolate so I made a chocolate glaze and drizzled it over the top.  YUM! Peanut butter and chocolate is the best combo and to have it in a cake, wow!  Grab a glass of milk before you sit down to eat it however, cause it rich!

Incredible!! So moist, and delicious. Didn't change a thing, won't change a thing. Hubby had a buddy over, and he had not one, not two, but 3 pieces!! I will make sure I have the ingrediants on hand for this one. Super easy to make, in fact, my 8 year old daughter did most of it!!

I brought this to a BBQ and got great comments! Super easy too! I used 1/2 cup of each kind of chips in the batter and 1/2 cup of each kind of chips on top. I also used crunchy peanut butter and it turned out really well!

This is a EASY and delicious recipe!

Next time I will put 1/4 cup of each of the chips for the topping and put the rest in the batter.

Thanks!  I really enjoyed making this and tasting was even better.  :o)

This smells divine when you're making it! One thing, next time I will put it into a large cookie sheet (11x15) to make thinner bars. This was tall like cake.

I have made this cake many times.  It is very like one from a magazine I subscribe to.  Since my family does not like even peanuts or any crunchy thing in their baked goods, I put white chocolate chips in instead of peanuts.  I keep getting rave reviews from my kids and hubby.

This is a nice cake for a change of pace  when getting away from the all chocolate mind set.  I love PB so this was right up my alley!  Thank you for it.

I have made this recipe for a couple of years and it never fails to get compliments.  Who can resist this moist peanut butter cake with its crumbly topping of nuts, chocolate chips and peanut butter chips - I haven't found one yet!

Delicious!  I didn't have peanut butter chips so I added more chocolate chips. I used dry roasted peanuts for the topping and though I usually like salty and sweet, I thought the topping was the weak link in this cake.  Will make again, probably omitting the topping altogether.  The cake part was just perfect!

I tried this straight out of the oven and wasn't a fan (neither was the s.o). But I ate another piece a day and half later and really liked it. I prefer it cold to warm. I didn't use the peanut butter chips b/c I didn't have any and used cruchy pb instead of regular. Thanks for the recipe:)

this was pretty good! i love peanut butter anything so i knew i would like this. it is a tad on the dry side, to help when i serve it i add some chocolate syrup and microwave it for a few seconds. i think a glass of milk is the perfect companion when eating this! overall pretty good!

This is delicious-super moist! I love PB and chocolate. While mixing ingredients, I decided that 1 cup PB was probably plenty, so I used all chocolate chips and no PB chips. I put 1 cup in the batter and 1/2 cup in the topping. Yummy!

cake was delicious, but very heavy. i used only chocolate chips, which was good, b/c the PButter adds enough peanuty flavor. Also, because I used a slightly smaller baking dish, my cake didn't quite finish cooking all the way through, so be sure that your cake is done before you take it out of the oven!

This cake was a hit - peanutty and chocolatey! The topping is excellent. I couldn't find chopped peanuts at the store, so I just used the regular dry-roasted ones that come in the big glass jars. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Oh man! This cake is terrific! I was going to freeze part of it for later, but it didn't make it that long! I baked it for the full 40 minutes but it probably could have been shortened a few minutes. It's dense without being heavy, and tasty without being overpowering. I'm definitely making it again!

This recipe was delicious! I ended up using a few more chocolate and peanut butter chips than it called for, and I turned it into cupcakes instead of a cake. It was huge hit.

This was very tasty. I had it all to myself, and polished it off in 8 days (that's about 900 calories a day!). One thing I'm not used to yet in baking recipes is what kind of peanuts to use when a recipe calls for "chopped peanuts" as this one does. Does that mean raw, or dry-roasted? Salted, lightly salted or unsalted? For this recipe I used dry-roasted salted nuts, which I chopped myself, and they worked out fine. Beyond that, I made the recipe exactly as written (except that I baked it for 42 minutes total; I live at altitude and a toothpick test at 40 minutes showed it wasn't quite done yet.) I enjoyed this quite a bit - thanks!

Wow this is good cake!  47 1/2 stars!  I was even a little short on the peanuts and chocolate chips, and it was still yummy.  As it was baking the aroma just about drove hubby & the kids nuts.  Now I've got ideas swimming around in my head for variations of this.  Can't wait to experiment, but I know I'll also be utilizing the original, too.

This was a hit at my dad's birthday party.  I made it into a 2 layer 9 inch round cake with store bought chocolate icing in the middle and around the outside edge, but not on the top.  Milk or ice cream would have been a great accompaniment, but we were on a picnic in 90 degree heat, so that was not feasible.  There were 3 cakes, but this was the only one that disappeared!

This is a great cake and so easy to make. The only changes I made is that I added vanilla to the batter and used only chocolate chips because it's what I had on hand. Thanks so much.

what a unique cake!  the flavors are right on, and it's wonderfully moist.  I NEVER follow a recipe exactly, and "almost" did this time.. decided a tad bit more peanut butter was called for, is all!  :)  co-workers, family & roommate loved it - thank you!!

This is great snack cake... and for dessert.  Used one small package maybe 2 oz. of the slivered nuts.  So, it was not very nutty.  Buttered and Criscoed the pan with flour before baking.

This was great, but verrry rich.  Be sure to have some milk handy.  I made two layers, and iced in between the layers and the outside with a store bought choc fudge icing.  I left the top of the cake open to crumbley topping.  My husband loves peanut butter, and he loved this cake.

Not impressed.  Cake was very dry and a little dense.

SUPER cake!  For some reason, I didn't like it the first day - just didn't like the extra peanuts on the top, and didn't like the mixture of sweet and salty.  I tried it again the second day, and it was wonderful!  Go figure.  Guess it just needed time to sit and let the flavors meld.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good. I wasn't sure about the chopped peanuts on top since I am not a big nut person but chopping them small and mixing them with the cake mix crumb turned out really good. I agree with another reviewer though that it didn't seem chocolately enough so tomorrow I am going to make up a chocolate glaze and try that on half. My husband's work has a bake-off using a bake good with peanuts so this would be perfect!

I will definetly make this cake again! It was YUMMY! I used crunchy peanut butter and then bough the chopped nut mix for ice cream, it kept me from actually chopping peanuts. And the edges got to dark before the center was cooked. Next time I will cover with foil.

This cake is amazing!!  Sooo easy!!  Everyone loved it.  Even my husband loved it and he's not big on sweets.  He ate 3 pieces today, which polished it off.  I bet he would have ate more if there was more to have.  The only thing I did different was I didn't have peanut butter chips so I used butterscotch.  YUMMY!!

I made this exactly as written except for omitting the peanuts, as I didn't have any. Baked it for exactly 40 minutes. It turned out good, but I would like to increase the moistness as it fell apart very easily. Made it a little messy to eat. Any suggestions for getting it to bind together better? The taste was good.

Made this cake a few days ago.  Baked for 45 minutes.  It was too dry.  Sorry, would not make again.  Husband didn't like it either.  Threw it away.
Sorry.

This cake is super! I made it for the teens at our church, and they described it as "a fluffy cookie."  I used chocolate chips in place of the peanut butter chips, since the cake already has a peanut butter flavor.  It's yummy!

This cake is great, very tasty and easy to make. My only comment/criticism is that it needs more chocolate! Next time, I will not add any peanut butter chips, and instead replace them with chocolate chips. I will very likely make this again - yum!

This cake was very easy to make and tasted great! Its the perfect cake for people who don't like rich cakes. I actually used pecans on top - I'll probably do that again. Thanks for the great recipe!
