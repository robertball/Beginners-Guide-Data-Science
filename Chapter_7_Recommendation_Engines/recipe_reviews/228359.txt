I absolutely love this salad.  Made a few modifications...added sliced avocado, went with a full cup of feta cheese, did sliced tomatoes on the vine instead of cherry tomatoes and went with balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

This is really good! I have an abundance of sweet yellow cherry tomatoes to use up, and I'm glad I found this recipe. The only thing different I did was to add a bit more olive oil to the dressing. After I whisked it up, it was just a bit too tangy. I probably added another teaspoon or two until it was just right for me.

Tasty and so simple to make. I had to substitute red onion for the shallot and it was great!

I used green onions because thatâ€™s what I had and went heavy on the feta and basil because I like them. Very tasty.

My daughter said this was the best salad that I have ever made. I made it with a few changes: I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and added a touch of sugar. Also, instead of just basil, I used a mixture of fresh garden herbs (basil, oregano, parsley and thyme), then served it over a small bed of spinach.

This was dish as shown.  I added some quinoa for protein and it was even better.

Delicious! My husband who doesn't enjoy vegetables took seconds of this salad! I took another reviewer suggestion and switched out the white vinegar with balsamic vinegar and omitted the feta.

I didn't have white wine vinegar so used balsamic vinegar. It's my hubby's favorite salad no w.  I had lots of homegrown tomatoes & fresh basil so making it often.

I liked this a lot. Bought multicolored cherry tomatoes at the food coop, grown local:-).   Used a very good olive oil and basil from the garden. very good.
