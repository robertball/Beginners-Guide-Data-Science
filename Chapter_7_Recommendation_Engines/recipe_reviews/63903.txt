I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my husband!  I can't believe how easy it was.  I did bypass the water and use a whole cup of red wine.  Delicious!!

This was just delicious! And unbelievably quick and easy too! Followed the recipe to the "T" using baby portobello mushrooms and the chops came out perfect! Very tender :) Served this with Garlic Green Beans and Very Easy Risotto (also from this site). Everything went together very nicely! 
Whole family really enjoyed this!

Delicious and moist!  Sliced up Baby Portabellas for a dressier feel.  On other reviewers advice used 1 cup red wine.  One word of warning however, if you omit the water, don't add the bouillon cube as the sauce will turn out a tad too salty.  Next time I will add a half cup of beef broth to the 1 cup red wine and not salt pork chops prior to cooking....that way I can control saltiness.  Otherwise this makes a very special meal.  Also added fresh rosemary sprigs per reviewers, removed before boiling down sauce, made a heavenly sauce.

This meal was great! I have been looking for a porkchop recipe to add to my book and this will be one. It was pretty simple to prepare. I did not have cooking spray on hand, so I just used butter to cook the mushrooms. I also rubbed pepper and garlic salt into the pork before adding the dijon mustard. I then followed the recipe accordingly. The sauce turned out to be salty, but I think that is because I added the garlic salt. Next time I will use garlic powder. Nevertheless, it was a great recipe. My parents really enjoyed it. Thanks!

This was good.  I did have to add a thickening agent to help with the sauce because it was just too runny.  I also added the meat to the sauce for the last 5 minutes to stay warm in the sauce and to get more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

Have made this twice now.First time followed the recipe without changes...excellant.Second time,finished the recipe in a 325 degreee oven after I browned the chops on top the stove over medium high heat. Sauted a sliced onion till golden in a little butter,using same pan. Added the mushrooms at this point, and cooked till tender. Returned chops to the pan,and continued with the recipe. Baked everthing at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. Removed the chops to a plate to keep warm. Reduced liquid in pan to about half,and served over the meat. Lovely.

This is one of those recipes that tastes so "professional" that it's hard to believe it took so little time and was made by such an amateur (like me).  My son and wife both raved about it--and that's not like either one of them.  My best "addendum" tip came from another reviewer who recommended adding corn starch.  I suppose the consistency of the gravy/broth is a matter of personal preference; I happen to prefer thicker rather than thinner for most recipes.  So, I added around three teaspoons of corn starch, which was exactly what was needed.  The taste was exceptional, the appearance wonderful and the ease of preparation couldn't have been better.  Only one final tip ... I only let the chops cook in the solution for maybe ten minutes after browning.  Any longer, they would have been more done than I would have been comfortable with.  The broth/gravy tasted like it was done by some chef at a fancy restaurant.

I just prepared this dish tonight after reading the one negative review submitted yesterday and me and my husband both enjoyed it.  As suggested by a previous reviewer, I added one full cup of red wine and no water and seasoned the pork chops with fresh ground pepper and salt prior to adding the mustard, which I mixed with crushed rosemary prior to adding it to the pork chops.  I will definitely make this again.

Modifications needed to be made when I accidentally bought the chicken bouillon cubes instead of the beef. – end result – the flavor was like a gourmet meal!!!!  I use ¾ cups wine, ¾ cup beef broth, seasoned with a little garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Added double the mushroom (hubby’s fave) and then at the end I used 1 Tbsp. cornstarch to thicken it up just a bit.  The only complaint (by myself) is that the chops were so thick, it took approximately 50 minutes to cook them.  Next time I will be butterflying them.  This recipe is very very good and I will be making it again – a real special occasion meal!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was great.  I didn't have any bullion cubes so used canned beef broth, omitted the water, & added just a tad bit more red wine.  I will definitely make this again.  Wonderful flavor.

I can no longer say, "My boyfriend does not cook." He made this recipe while I wasn't home to "supervise", and phoned me to describe how great it turned out. I had it for lunch the next day and indeed, it couldn't be better! As for simplicity, it only took him 35 minutes start-to-finish! We used pork sirloin chops instead of regular chops, and they were as tender and delicious as any I have ever had. Oh, and the best part is, it's only 3 CARBS PER SERVING! Yippee! Thanks for such a quick, flavorful recipe!

We really enjoyed these.  I think it is better not to use thin cuts of pork.  We used thicker ones. Don't use cooking wine, use a nice hearty melot.  These turned out great and nice an juicy.  A repeat for when you have that leftover glass of wine

This was delicious.  After reading the reviews and having a few say it was salty, I increased the water to 3/4 cup and added flour to thicken the sauce.  I will definately make again!

I made this recipe for myself and my boyfriend.  I thought it was delicious and my my boyfriend absolutely loved it!  I took the suggestion of putting in a full cup of red wine and leaving out the water.  That was definately a good choice.  I used the bouillon powder instead of cubes and that worked fine.  Next time, I might add just a bit of cornstarch to thicken the remaining juices, but it was still excellent without that.

Sophisticated taste - kids won't like it.  Omitted the water and added extra wine.  Added a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken the sauce.  Smearing the mustard on the meat is not necessary - just combine the mustard with the wine instead and pour over chops.  This dish IS salty, but hey, I like salt.

This was THE most disgusting pork chop I have ever eaten. It was only me tonight so I halved the sauce and only used 1 pork chop. It started out looking good. Then I smelled something burning as the all the sauce was cooked out of the pan. So I made more sauce and kep on cooking. In the end I had a purple pork chop that was EXTREMELY salty. Nasty, nasty, and still nasty. I threw it out.

After reading the suggestions of other reviewers, I made some modifications and thought I was going to have a spectacular meal.  I sauteed sliced baby portabellas in a little unsalted butter first.  Then, when adding the liquids, I substituted low sodium beef broth for the bouillion and water.  Somehow, I ended up with tough, extremely salty pork chops.  Also, I must have had the heat too high, because the dijon mustard on my chops burned onto the bottom of the pan.  The chops didn't really get any color.  I just had a burnt layer of mustard on the bottom of my pan.  On the plus side, both my kids (4 & 2)seemed to enjoy the chops when I sliced them up into very thin slices.  My four year old said they were deliciously salty.  She also thought it was neat that they had basically turned purple from the wine.  I, on the other hand, did not think that purple pork was really such a great thing.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, as many other reviewers really seemed to enjoy these, but I was definitely disappointed.

Not as good as I expected.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the pork chops to be a little dry and the sauce a little bland.  An okay recipe but there are better out there.

This was GREAT! I did not have fresh mushrooms, (small town, the store was all out) so used 14 oz. of canned mushrooms. I poured the wine over the drained mushrooms to marinate about a ahlf hour before cooking. I added a bit more wine to the sauce while cooking. I also had to use a grainy mustard, rather than Dijon, but added a sweet onion mustard, to make it more like Dijon mustard. I will definitely be making this easy, delicious recipe again.

We found these porkchops to be extremely tender and tasty.  I followed some of the suggestions in previous reviews and these are the changes I made to the original recipe:  I rubbed the pork with garlic powder and black pepper before cooking; I used 3/4 cup red wine (I used the shiraz in my fridge) and 1/4 cup water; I used 1 1/2 envelopes of the Herb-Oz boullion (not the cubes); I added sprigs of fresh rosemary to the sauce; and I thickened the sauce at the end with about a tablespoon of corn starch.  I recommend using the Herb-Ox brand boullion - it only had 5mg of sodium per unit, the boullion I had in my pantry had 810 mg. of sodium - this might explain why some reviewers found the pork so salty.  Ours was delicious. Thanks!!!

Very disappointed. This was awfully salty, and I only used 1.5 bouillon cubes. If I ever do it again I may completely eliminate the bouillon cubes and add garlic and a few spices.

The red wine was fantastic with the dijon mustard and mushrooms.  I added 1 tsp corn starch to the sauce when it was boiling the last 5 min.  It was still a little too soupy for us.  Also next time, I would only put dijon mustard on 1 side of the pork chops - it was just a little too strong.  It still had great flavor though!  I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish for my employer's birthday and she loved it.  I made a few of the modifications that was recommended my some of the other reviewers such as onions with the mushrooms, using 1 cup of wine instead of water and skipping the bouillon.  I don't eat meat, but would gladly recommend it to others.

I was nervous about trying this one, but it turned out well.  I rubbed the meat with a salt/pepper/garlic powder mixture and then coated them in the mustard.  I skipped the boullion cubes and subbed in 2 TBSP of chicken broth.  We really enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again.
