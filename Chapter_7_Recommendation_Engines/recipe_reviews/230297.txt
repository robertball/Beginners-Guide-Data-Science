This is an awesome soup. I didn't have poblano or cherry peppers so I used jalapenos and red pepper flakes. I also used milk instead of cream. I ended up cooking this for 5 hours on low. I'll be making this one again!

really turned out great. lots of flavor! i was afraid it would be to spicy for our kids so i left out the jalapeños. everything else the same as the recipe. the poblano peppers etc. give a great flavor and mild spice.

Don't be fooled by the inexplicable high ratings. It's not just bad.... It's nothing more than cooked vegetables in hot milk. Look at the ingredients - no seasoning whatsoever, not even a grain of salt. To make it edible, you're going to have to dress it up so much that you might as well look elsewhere for a better chowder recipe to follow. Also, this makes an enormous quantity, filling a large crockpot to the brim. You'll be eating this mess for a week.

This is the best soup ever!  I always make this for our Lenten Soup suppers and it is the FIRST soup to go!!  Great recipe!  I did make some minor adjustments.  For instance, when cooking the veggies, I sautéed some minced garlic before adding the veggies.  While they were cooking, I added a little more butter (butter makes it better) and 4-5 dashes of cayenne pepper.  In addition, before adding the chile into the soup, I cooked it a little with some garlic and onion salt.  It definitely brings out more of the chile flavor when you do add it to the soup!  I should mention that I substituted all the various peppers for just Green Chile Peppers (not to be confused with bell peppers).

I had never had corn chowder and wanted to make and  taste.. I'm sure glad my first experience was great.. This soup is so good, my family loved it too.. I do know next time I'm adding  more carrots and celery and less onion.  Everything else was perfect.. Yum..

This is very tasty, yet very spicy! If you're not into very spicy food, definitely take the pepper count down or use less spicy peppers .

This was full of flavor and warms you right to the tips of your toes on a cold day.  I cooked it for 3 hours on low but the slow cooker was so full that the liquid was spilling out onto my counter so I transferred it to a large pot and continued simmering it on low on the stove for another hour. I may have been too generous in the amount of vegetables I added which didn't leave much room in the slow cooker. But  it was still really delicious!

Couldn't find the hot cherry peppers so i substituted with red jalapeño. Also this recipe takes up the entire crockpot all the way up to the lid. Next time I will add more peppers, was't super spicy.

SO yummy! I used fresh potatoes and garnished individual servings with shredded cheddar. Every one LOVED it!
