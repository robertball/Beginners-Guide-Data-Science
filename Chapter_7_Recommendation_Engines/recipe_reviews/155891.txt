GOOD IDEA, BUT RESCUE THIS RECIPE LIKE SO:  The idea for this recipe was almost certainly gleaned from a bed & breakfast cookbook, the idea being that B&B owners are very busy in the morning, so they do as much prep the night before as they can.  You can still accomplish the convenience, however, without the awful (think wallpaper paste) texture of crock-pot cooked oatmeal, and still avoid having much to do or clean up in the morning.  Here's how:  THE NIGHT BEFORE: toss together the following, and store in an airtight bowl in the fridge: sugar, spices, salt, cut up butter, cut up apples, cranberries (I substituted raisins), and nuts (I used slivered almonds).  IN THE MORNING: put 2 1/2 cups water and the bowl full of sugar/fruit into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Forget all that juice--too sweet!  Notice that the total liquids is significantly reduced from the original recipe, because it's not sitting all night in a crock pot, getting "pasty".  When it just begins to boil, add 2 cups regular rolled oats and cook 5 minutes.  Done!  All you had to do in the morning was combine pre-prepared ingredients and cook 5 minutes.  You get delicious gourmet oatmeal without the "yucky" texture, and your kitchen is still clean in the morning because you did all the prep and clean-up the night before.  One more tip, for those looking for home-made breakfasts without the chaos and mess (and time!) in the mornings:  You can make pretty much anything the night before and just bake, cook,

To avoid burning my crockpot, I used a Reynolds turkey cooking bag and lined my crockpot with it. I made this for my husband's family and they loved it- even the avowed non-oatmeals eaters!  Just because I love the spice with apples, I added cardamom to the spice mix.  I tripled this recipe (I have a very large crockpot) and it held up just fine.  The only thing I would do differently, when I enlarge the recipe is cut back on the cinnamon, because tripling that was way too much.  I loved the combination of cranberry and nutmeg.  This also reheated very very well-- after leaving my husband's family, the oatmeal sat for about and hour and half, before I plugged in the crockpot again at my parents, and it warmed back up delightfully.

We thought this was wonderful.  I sprayed the crockpot with pam, and didn't have any problems with sticking.    I have an extremely hot crockpot, so I only put it on "keep warm" about 2am, and it was ready and perfect by 7am.    Loved it!

My first recipe choice this morning didn't pan out so this was my second start at a hot breakfast for the family. I did not make this in a slow cooker, I didn't have time for that.  I actually made this recipe in my rice cooker! I didn't need AS much liquid, I used a cup and a half of water and a cup and a half of apple juice. I just kind of guessed. This worked out well for me and the smell of it cooking was amazing. The amount of sugar and spice was perfect and the fruit cooking along with the oatmeal gave it such amazing flavor. I loved that I could just throw everything together and let it go. Even though I didn't cook it in a crockpot, I think I got the best of the recipe without all the gumminess or burned oatmeal. I think cooking it in my rice cooker could use a little playing around with as far as the liquids go but for me, it was still a winner. Thanks for this great recipe--it's a keeper!

My husband and 15 yr old son love oatmeal so I made this for Christmas morning.  Followed recipe and cooked on low about 8 hrs...smelled and tasted wonderful.  Nice base recipe to play around with.  The only thing I would do different next time is to not cook it so long- found it to be a bit mushy, which is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5...
Thanks for this very different and yummy breakfast treat!

It burned my crockpot past repair.  Perhaps if the sauce was mixed in before cooking it would have been allright.  The flavor was great, and it was easy. It was popular with the guys.  They all thought it was great.  Flavorful, sweet.  I didn't have enough nutmeg so used 1/2 nutmeg and made up the spices with a bit of coriander & mostly pumpkin pie seasoning.  I don't think it is critical as long as you get enough spices in it.

The flavor reminds me of an apple crisp.  I stuck to the recipe but had to sub 1 extra cup of water for the apple juice (didn't have) and used 1 cup of crangrape for the cranberry juice.  I will probably use the steel cut oats next time.  The rolled oats are a little mushy (I did not stir until I served it). I will also add more apples and cut in larger pieces. Great idea!

Took my crockpot with us camping, and made this recipe for our last morning.  Worked great to have a tasty, no fuss, few dishes meal before packing up to go home. (we had brown and serve sausages with it) HOWEVER, a word of caution for anyone wanting to increase the serving size.  I needed to feed a group of 12, so I tripled the recipe.  However, 12 cups of liquid (6 cups of water and 6 cups of juice) seemed like way too much.  I decreased it to a total of 8 1/2 cups liquid, and it was still a bit more soupy than we would have prefered.  7 or 71/2 cups would have been enough liquid.  Also, it was quite sweet.  If I triple the recipe again, I'll only double the brown sugar.  I have a large crock pot (20 cup capacity) and the triple batch (with 8.5 c liquid) filled it almost to the top.  And yes, we had a lot left over.  A double batch would have served 12 easily, even though almost everyone had seconds.

This is absolutely the worst recipe I have ever tried. I followed the recipe to the letter, and my oatmeal burned. It was way too sweet. I had to mix in milk and nuts to make it somewhat edible. Even then, it was sickeningly sweet. I ended up throwing it all out. I will stick with my tried and true cinnamon rolls for Christmas morning from now on. This oatmeal was disgusting.

I made this recipe a couple of years ago and it has become a family tradition. It's great! My family loves it. Don't use quick oats. ( My first mistake.) Maybe adjust the cooking time, but I think you'll love it.

Have made this and variations several times.  Measure the nutmeg carefully (don't over use).  Never had an issue with it being too dry.  Fun to wake up any morning with tasty hot oatmeal ready to eat.

Very tart - but good. Next time I'll use a different type of apple and maybe cut down on the cranberry juice. Good and super easy to put together. It's best served and cooled slightly before eating.

Made as written, it isn't that great - too sweet and too liquidy.  Though, unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with the slow cooker burning.

The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe, but left out the walnuts.  I also used less water and juice and brown sugar.  This time it was perfect and I'm planning to make it again soon.

It's a good idea, but I'm glad I tried it before Christmas morning to avoid the great disappointment.  This was really dry and over cooked. This may work with some alterations, such as...more liquid!!

I wanted to love this recipe, but I should have listened to the majority of the reviews.. As soon as I lifted the lid, it smelt bad and the apples were bland and tasteless.  The oatmeal was very tart from the Cranberry juice.

This oatmeal recipe is not good.  Way too much going on - the amount of spices was too great, and there just wasn't enough oats to make it seem like oatmeal.  I hate that I wasted my time with it for Christmas breakfast!!!  (And I even read the reviews; now I wish I would've listened!)  My husband thought it had too much spice in it, and he usually likes everything.

This had to many flavors going on. I think simple cinnamon would have been fine. After reading other reviews about burning the crockpot, I sprayed mine with PAM and nothing stuck to it. 

This was not very good at all.

Awesome recipe! I used Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. I didn't use cranberry juice, not a fan, just apple juice & water. Served it with light cream & pecans! Stores great in frig for leftovers!

I double the fruit, leave out the butter, and sometimes substitute the juice for milk. Still very sweet and a family favorite. Also, I like to add the nuts in at the end (about last hour or so), otherwise they don't add as much to the dish. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I used 2 1/2 oats with 2 n half cups water, 2  1/2cups nonfat milk. Used fresh bananas (2) and strawberries ( about 8) ,3 tblespn brown sugar and truvia sugar, 2 tablespoon light tablespoon butter...cook 2 hours low, 5 hrs warm and then 2 hrs hrs on low. perfect. I did leave strawberries and bananas - 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 2 tablespoon  sugar truvia to set in fridge in 2 hours before layering in crockpot first...then oatmeal (old fashion_ with another 2 tablespoon brown sugar and truvia...make sure you spray crock pot with olive oil and canola oil (sugar and fat free) with butter spray (must be spray) first and it wont stick. Sprinkle with fat and sugar free maple syrup and a little bit more truvia...YUMMY..oh and I used almonds

The flavor was good, but the texture was off - kind of like pie filling.  I would use steel cut oats in the future.  My 9 year old said it tasted better than it looked.

This recipe was not great.  My kids who love oatmeal didn't even eat this.  I like the concept but the ingredients made this too sour.  I used 100% Cranberry juice not the coctail so maybe that had a little to do with the tartness.  This cooked for over 8 hours on low and I had to add another cup of oats and cook longer to thicken it up.  If I do this again I will use all apple juice and water and may substitute the cranberries for raisins.  I am not sure if I can even get my husband to try it with out the cranberry juice after tasting the origial.

No problems with crock pot burning as mentioned in another review.  I really was excited about the recipe...all of the ingredients looked great.  But my kids wouldn't even try it.  I filled my bowl and ate about 3 bites.  Too sweet for me.  I'll stick with Quaker Instant oatmeal in the future.

I really wanted to like this but I just couldn't. I took one bite and my boyfriend wouldn't even try it. It was like a big pot full of thick hot cranberry juice. I put the whole batch in the blender and mixed about 3 TBS with plane oatmeal for our 8 month old. She loved it! If you ask her it would be a 5 star recipe. I put the rest in in ice cube trays and froze it. Now we have enough home made organic baby food to last us until next christmas. Also I didn't add the butter because I didn't think any of us needed that much fat. I will try again with a lot of changes.

Despite reviews otherwise it was easy to clean up.  Very tasty, yes on the sweet side but I don’t like  my oatmeal bland anyway.  Came out the correct goopy consistency, not too runny. Cranberries made it.

Agree with the  "how to rescue this recipe" review. No need at all for overnight cooking. Just prep it the night before. However in the morning if you are cooking this with steel cut oats you must increase the added water to at least 1-2 cups more if you are following the rescue directions. It certainly does not need the juice at all because it is quite sweet from the cooked apples and brown sugar already. I also used regular walnuts not any sort of candied nut and it was terriffic. Only 4 stars because required modification. Would be great  with some sausage on the side as someone had already suggested

Last fall I was looking for a new oatmeal recipe and ran across this one. Wow! It is now our go to oatmeal recipe. With the fruit and juice it needs very little sweetener (I only use one third cup brown sugar) and it is almost more like a dessert than a breakfast cereal. I use the slow cook feature on my 6 quart DUO Instant Pot and it is done in 2 and a half to three hours. If I do not have any juice on hand, I use one can of evaporated milk mixed with water to make the required 4 cups of liquid. For spices I have used various combinations of cinnamon, fresh ground nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, almond extract and maple extract. If I don't have dried cranberries on hand, I use raisins and whatever apples I have on hand. It always turns out great!

None of the 4 of us liked this, it had too much nutmeg and a weird aftertaste.  I so wanted us all to like it because I doubled the recipe but we just didn't care for it.  It also has an astronomical amount of sugar from various sources.

My oatmeal loving children hated it.  It was very sweet despite my omitting the sugar.  The consistency as others have stated was VERY mushy.  A good deal of the oatmeal stuck to my slow-cooker which made this a wasteful recipe.

2 stars based on the cooking outcome, not flavor. This recipe did not work for me or my crockpot.  There was way too much liquid, the oatmeal was mushy and the oatmeal burned to the side (thankfully I used a liner).  It smelled good, but based on the looks alone, my hubby refused to try it.  I did eat 1 bowl full, it possibly could be salvaged by adding more oats while it is still warm.

Flavor wise, I had to make some adjustments since I didn't have all the ingrdients (although they shouldn't have affected the outcome). I did use regular rolled oats (not quick cook or steel cut) I used frozen cherries as my fruit, added walnuts before cooking (big mistake-they turned out soft an inedible).  I didn't have regular apple juice or cranbery juice so I used a Motts Medley Apple (w/ carrot) it was ok, but not the best.  I did end up adding to my bowl more brown sugar, as the cherries were a bit tart.  I didn't think my crockpot would let me set it to warm for 8hrs so I used low for 8hrs, it did then sit on warm for an extra hour.  
I think this recipe may still be doable, with some tweeks for my crockpot.  Next time I will definitely try WARM and less liquid by atleast 1 cup. Based on what I've read, steel cut oats probably would give better results (but they are much more expensive to mess up on) Liner bag is a must.

Cranberry flavor was too overwhelming and nutmeg and cinnamon overpowering.  I would try it with all apple juice, cut out the cranberry jc, reduce the spices.  I would try to achieve more maple flavor and use raisins instead of dried cranberries.  The cranberries plumped up til they looked like grapes!
