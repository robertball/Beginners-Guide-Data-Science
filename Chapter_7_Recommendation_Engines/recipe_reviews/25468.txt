This recipe will do in a pinch if you all have is Vodka and Tequilla.  The tequilla soaks in well and provides a nice flavor to compliment the teriaki.  However, the vodka doesn't add much.  Vodka, if you use a decent one, doesn't have any flavor.  Since the alcohol is cooked out, it is just a filler.  Instead, try using whiskey.  It provides a rich, hearty flavor that I'm sure campers and grillers alike can enjoy.  Otherwise a very tasty recipe.

Interesting.  Made this for the holiday.  Had a zip to it.  Will try to make again when we use the grill.  We put this under the broiler.  We cooked this a little too long. Rare or Med Rare is probably better.  Will rate again after we try grilling

I also did not use vodka, just tequila, teriyaki sauce, steak sauce, a little sesame oil, and garlic. Since vodka does not have any taste, I didn't see what that would bring to the marinade.  I used flank steak and marinated for 48 hours.  It was good, but a little heavy on the teriyaki.  Next time, I will use much less.

I left out the vodka - mainly because what I had on hand was vanilla flavored.  I used the marinade on some flank steak and let it sit for a couple of hours in the fridge.  It turned out great.  The tequila gave it a nice earthy flavor, intensifying the steak's meatiness.  The other ingredients seemed like a strange mix, but the result was complex and slightly exotic without straying to weirdness.  Definitely repeat-worthy!

I followed all fellow reviewers recommendations to leave out the vodka since there was no point.  My only hesitation was whether or not I needed a filler in it's place, but I chose not to.  I stuck by the recipe exactly except for the vodka.  The teriyaki/steak sauce/lemon juice mixture was quite good, but I was surprisingly not a big fan of the tequila.  The only thing it did to the marinade was give it a very bitter aftertaste.  It wasn't horrible, but I ended up dipping the rest of my meat in additional steak sauce just t eliminate the bitterness.  If I made this again, I would definitely leave out the tequila.

I agree with the others regarding the vodka - it isn't needed. This was EXCELLENT, and a great way to use up some of the cheaper Tequlia we had around the house.

Goodness! I let this marinate in the fridge overnight as I do with most all of my meat and it was too much. I made as written and the tequila overpowered everything. The teriyaki and steak sauce got completely lost. This might have been my fault though due to how long I let it marinate. Hubs liked it boozy like that so I am giving 4 stars. Don't let this sit for too long as I did or you will get a buzz just grilling it.  Oh, and it needs salt. Just a little but it needs salt. I think this would be really good with wild game such as venison.
