Wonderful way to alter tea.  I used Welch's Light frozen Cranberry juice and 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar and it still tasted great!

I COULDN'T FIND THE FROZEN CRANBERRY CONCENTRATE
IN THE GROCERY STORE I SHOPPED IN, SO I MADE IT
WITH THE REGULAR OCEANSPRAY BOTTLED. I THINK IT
WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE USING THE FROZEN,
THE REGULAR JUST DIDN'T CUT IT! THE GODDESS WAS
NOT HAPPY-MY OWN FAULT-SORRY!  xoxoxoxo

Delicious! I used Cran-Raspberry juice to counter some of the tartness of straight cranberry juice. It was gone within hours. It was simple and fast. Something I will make again and again.

I created a different flavor combination & it worked out well. With the basic recipe in mind,(I halved the recipe because I only wanted 8 c. of liquid.) I used 1/2 a can of pineapple juice concentrate, 1/2c. of sugar, 8c. of boiling water, and I used 10 HERBAL TEA (mango apple)  bags. The flavor was terrific. A great way to use up excess tea bags. I will try other juice concentrates and tea flavors in the future. A+++

We go through about a gallon of this every day.
Cran-Raspberry is my favorite, but I have also tried it with frozen lemonade and raspberry lemonade.

This was delicious! Next time I'll probably use 3/4 cup of sugar, though. I also made it in halved quantities.. 1/2 the ingredients, and 7 tea bags for the first batch, and 1/2 the ingredients and the same 7 tea bags the 2nd time so the tea wasn't too strong. The results were more than satisfying. I absolutely loved this. Quick and easy, something I know I'll make again.

As good as Red Lobster's--maybe better! I doubled the recipe for a family get together. Not a drop was left. Looking forward to making it again soon.

I think this recipie has potential.  I really liked it, but sometimes it tasted like I was just drinking plain cranberry juice.  I either didn't steep my tea long enough or 1 can of concentrate is a little too much.  I have never had another Boston tea or Red Lobsters, so I have nothing to compare it to.  But I did like it.  I will just work on it until it comes out more tea flavored

Awesome, super easy, and oh, so refreshing! We've made this tea a bunch of times already...and our favorite way so far is to use only 3/4 cup of sugar, and then use a cranberry blend juice, such as cranberry apple or cranberry raspberry (my favorite!) The tea is not only extremely delicious, but very attractive as well. I also use one of those huge, iced tea teabags (Lipton brand) and do it either by a cold brew method or brewing a smaller amount of very, very strong tea, and filling it out with cold water. That way, the tea doesn't have to cool so long, so that we can drink it faster :) Thanks so much for sharing the recipe! It's a winner!

We do love our lemonade and our iced tea (and me my Coke Zero...) but every now and then it's fun to change things up a little when we're looking to grab something to drink from the fridge. I'm not familiar with Boston Iced Tea, nor would I have thought of blending tea and cranberry on my own.  We enjoyed this different take on fruit-flavored tea, however, we found it just a tad too sweet for our tastes and because of that, not quite as refreshing or thirst-quenching as it could have been. I wish I would have started out with a lesser amount of sugar (I used Splenda) and added it to taste if I needed to.

Loooooooove this stuff! Made this for the first time for a baby shower and it was gone before I brought out the appetizers! Tried to make this again with mixed berry concentrate--too sweet. Will stick with the cranberry. Good one for summer--thanks!

Very good flavor. I don't see how anyone could not taste the cranberry in this recipe. Nice flavor. Upped the sugar only slightly and it was perfect.

After sampling this tea for the first time, I was thrilled I had found the recipe.  This recipe makes a GALLON of tea and I was certain I would be able to have a glass of it at my cookout last weekend.  Wrong!  This tea DISAPPEARED right away while all the other drinks sat on the counter.  "Please pass that Boston tea" was what I kept hearing.  I've made it with just 1/2 a cup of sugar and it's just as good.  Try this.  It's great!

This is great iced tea! I halved it and ended up using apple cranberry juice instead of plain cranberry because I wanted to use juice concentrate that was 100% juice. I think using a cranberry-other fruit blend is good because the slight bitterness of the tea and the tartness of the cranberry *may* be too strong for a lot of people. Next time I'll try using only half the number of tea bags (used Lipton) and let it steep longer so as not to waste bags.  This tasted like the fruit flavored iced teas you can buy only without the fake fruit flavor and much less expensive. It also has such a pretty color.

UPDATE 5/28/10:  I've made this tea many times now and have the method down perfectly.  What you do is put 10 tea bags in a 1 quart glass measuring cup, then fill the measuring cup with boiling water (I use a tea pot, but you could boil the water in the measuring cup using the microwave then add the tea bags).  Let the tea steep for a couple of minutes- however long you want.  Fill a gallon jug halfway with cold water and stir in 2/3 cup Splenda. Add your 10 oz container of juice concentrate- apple raspberry and apple cranberry are my favorites.  Pour in your steeped tea, then top off with more cold water to fill the gallon jug.  Stir and enjoy!

Excellent!  Made it for a party and it was universally loved.  Made 3 quarts in a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker.  Used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 of the cranberry concentrate.  I think I would only use 1/3 of the concentrate the next time around.

Great recipe for those of us who love a nice chilled glass of tea in the summertime.  It's very close to the Boston Iced tea served at Red Lobster restaurants!

WOW..this was a surprisingly refreshing tea!  I love tea and am always looking for a new way to drink it.  I halved the recipe, then halved the sugar to try it out.  Good, but not too sweet.  Next time I make this I will substitute ALL Agave Nectar to sweeten since I'm sure the cranberry juice has sugar in it.

I make this several times a week in many different flavor combinations.  I usually only make half of the recipe at a time.  I only use 1/4 cup of sugar or less and I steep the tea for 10 mn.  Our favorite flavor combinations are pomegranate or berry tea with a cranberry raspberry or pomegranate cranberry frozen juice.  So yummy and refreshing!

I followed this recipe to the "T" and all I tasted was tea nothing else.  If I were to make this again I would use half the tea bags.  Even adding rum didn't improve the flavor.

Very good basic idea to make iced tea. I made mine Peach Tea by using Goya Peach Nectar and a can of White Grape/Peach juice concentrate with much less sugar. It came out really well! One guest at the bridal shower said that it tasted as good, if not better than the Peach Tea at Olive Garden! This recipe is great because you can adjust the sweetness as needed. Delish!

This is a great refreshing summer sip. I like to switch it up sometimes and try different frozen juices. I also sometimes substitute Splenda for the sugar. Usually, I just buy a gallon of water, that way I can just put the tea back in the gallon jug to store in the fridge when its done.

This is a great refreshing drink.  A new spin on regular tea.  I drink it everyday now.  A good source of antioxidants!

i think it's perfect as is, but some like tea sweeter than others, and som elike it stronger, so adjust to your taste. i used 5 of the large (the luzianne family size) tea bags instead of 15 small ones and let it seep pretty much until cool.

Sweet and full of flavor.  I used 12 bags of green tea and 3 bags of green tea with lemon/ginseng.  The cranberry was a great touch.  Will make again as it is very easy and you could make so many different combinations of tea.

I made this tea as directed and enjoyed it.  Next time, though, I think I might try a cran-apple concentrate for a little additional non-sugar sweetness.

Just a thought - instead of going through so many small tea bags use 3 of the family sized bags. Its so much easier and more economical as well.  So quoteth the Southerner.

Very refreshing!  I used decaf tea so I could get away with drinking it whenever I wanted, even late evening!  I really loved the simplicity....my other holiday recipes required a lot more attention and detail.  Thank You!

Excellent. I love it. I used a white grape/razberry concentrate. Only used 1/2 of it. I also only did 3/4 cups of sugar and 10 tea bags. Next time,  I might do 12 tea bags and steep it a little longer. It's very tasty!!!

What nice combination of flavors! I used 1 cup fresh bottled cranberry juice (very tart!) and 1/2 cup granulated Splenda instead of sugar. I used some fancy loose leaf Earl Grey tea that was on hand (gifts), put it in a tea ball & brewed up about 1/2 gallon very strong so that it can stand up to ice.

This was really good. One of my husband's favorite drinks! I was lazy though and bought a gallon of sweetened tea instead of the home made. We also threw in some sliced oranges like his favorite restaurant. It's perfect as is too... We've made this several times! Everyone who tries it asks for more!

Holy cow! If I could give this more than
five stars, I totally would. 

I didn't have cranberry juice concentrate, but I did have raspberry lemonade. Seeing as the lemonade is 
already sweetened, I used half the sugar
called for in this recipe. I also added
more tea bags, as my husband and I like 
a stronger tea.

So wonderful and a refreshing change from
your regular iced tea.

Thank you SO much for this recipe!

This is an awesome tea.  My 5yr old loves tea but always adds so much sugar so I tried this out.  I only added 1 1/4 cup sugar and I used 3 family sized tea bags of regular tea and then I threw in 3 bags of raspberry zinger celestial seasonings tea and the hint of raspberry is awesome.  Next time I will try it with the orange tangerine and then I will try it with the black cherry.  Even without the flavorings this is an awesome tea.

This is absolutely terrific served icy cold! Intense full flavor.   I used Splenda and 12 cold brew tea bags.  I was hoping to cut down on the sweetener - but you really do need a full cup to counter the bitterness of the cranberry juice.  I will be making this all the time.  Just be sure to serve it VERY COLD.  It doesn't taste that great lukewarm.

Here in the South we like our tea a little stronger, so I decided to muddle this recipe up just a little bit. I followed the recipe to the letter except I added a .75 liter bottle of sour mash burbon. Now thats iced tea the southern way, try it you will like it.

Soooooo good! The only change I made was to add a pinch of baking soda to cut any bitterness. I learned that from a Sweet Tea recipe on this site, and though it sounds strange, it really works.

I know I messed this one up. I guess I steeped the tea to long, b/c it was WAY too strong. But the kicker was that I only steeped them 5 minutes. If I make this again, I will use way less tea bags.  I really wanted to enjoy this too. Bummer.

Easy & Affordable, what more can you ask for? I followed the recipe and it tasted great. It was a nice change to the ordinary iced tea.

This tea is wonderful & the recipe is very easy. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/3c and may cut back even more next time to get more zing from the juice concentrate. I also made ice cubes with the tea to to help prevent diluting once served.

Very good iced tea!  Nice change to plain iced tea, this recipe gives just enough sweetness without being over-powering.  I agree with other reviewers, you can experiment with this recipe and try other juices.  It's still outstanding!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!!!  I used 12 regular tea bags and 3 Red Raspberry tea bags along with the concentrate Cranberry Juice.  Very refreshing!  People kept saying how good it was.. Tip: Combine tea & ginger ale in a glass for a nice twist!! Will be making this again... SOON!

Loved this recipe! Made it for Easter tomorrow and just got done taste testing it. I cheated a little and here are my tricks: used 4 Lipton cold brew family sized tea bags, let them steep 15 mins. Used cranberry/raspberry frozen juice concentrate and one cup white sugar. Love it will, make over and over!!

loved this tea, served it as an alternative to juice for a coffee that I gave for a woman's group and they all raved and opted for it rather than oj.  I think it is so refreshing and plan to keep in on hand all summer.  just the right amount of sweetness.  great recipe, thanks

I wasn't so sure how good this would taste to us as we aren't huge cranberry juice fans --- but WOW! We were all impressed. One time when I went to the store to buy more cranberry juice for this recipe, they were out, so I bought a cran-rasberry mixed concentrate. It was also superb. It tasted just like a raspberry iced tea you would get at a restaurant, but a much healthier alternative as it isn't made with those syrups.

I made this for the first time today, just as written, and found it to be excellent. I did not get all the cranberry concentrate in the mix though as I opened it with a yank, thinking it was frozen. It wasn't, and the stuff went all over me, the floor, the fridge and the center island. lol So I got to clean all that up and drink this after. On my third big glass now!

This was a hit at our party!  I used 10 decaf tea bags, and 2/3 cup splenda.  A great, refreshing change from regular or raspberry iced tea that I usually make.  We love cranberries and I'm sure I'll make this many times over the summer.  Also good with some fresh berries added.

This was just alright. At first I didn't like it but then as I kept drinking, I warmed up to it a bit. I'll probably have more since it's sitting in the fridge, but I wouldn't make it again. It's just okay.

This is really good.  Can't wait to try it with other frozen juices.  I could only find cranberry juice cocktail so I didn't use any sugar at all and thought it was perfect but I don't like very sweet drinks.

I could only find cranberry juice cocktail (which already has sugar), so I decreased the amount of sugar added (to about 1/2 c.). This was great.  I served it at a party with lime wedges.

I tasted this tea after adding the cranberry juice. It was very bitter. I added another cup of sugar before it cooled down. As it mellows together the taste does improve. My husband dislikes sugared tea and I guess I am just not a Boston Iced Tea fan.

Haven't been able to find the frozen cranberry juice yet, but this recipe tastes good when you sub other juices for sure! As a side note I don't recommend subbing fruit punch. It will provide the lovely red color like in the picture but imparts a flavor that took me a half-gallon to get used to!

I was looking for a flavored tea to make in place of the delicious yet pricey bottled tea that we love so much. This is absolutely delicious---5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!! Super easy to make, and better with time. Other reviewers nailed it when they said it was sweeter and even yummier the next day. I used cranberry concentrate, which was scrumptious, and I look forward to trying different flavor twists, such as raspberry lemonade and even a hard version with rum. This recipe is a keeper...thank you so much for sharing it with us!
UPDATE: I added spiced rum to this, with lots of ice, for a late summer party that husband and I threw for friends. Let's just say it was a memorable event and this beverage has since been requested...

This was excellent.  I substituted some sugar with honey to cut it back a little.  It came out great.  Thanks for a great recipe! I have also used Welch's Strawberry Breeze frozen concentrate. It was a wonderful strawberry tea!

Easy and delicious. I found that this tea tastes much better (and sweeter) after sitting for a few hours in the fridge. So, for those of you who like sweet tea, I would say to hesitate before adding more sugar until the tea sits for a while. My husband doesn't like tea, but he liked this!

Good, a little tart b/c of the cranberry.  I couldn't find the regular concentrate so I used the cocktail.  I tried using only a half a cup of sugar as the others suggested when you use the cocktail, but it was still way too bitter.  So I used the whole cup and everyone liked it and thought it was a great new way to do iced tea.  I still thought it was a bit too bitter.

One of my favorite recipes.  I chose to make a hard tea one night and used this recipe and added some flavored vodka (1/2 cup each of raspberry and cranberry) and it was delish!

I've had this recipe in my box for a while, and decided to try it tonight.  It doesn't have a tart cranberry taste like I expected.  If I made it again, I would cut the sugar.

I did not really care for this, It had a bitter taste. I will stick to plain tea without the cranberry added to it. Thanks anyway.

People seemed to like this.  I used Splenda and only 1/2 a can of cranberry/raspberry juice.  Just a 1/2 can was tart enough.

I have made this twice in two days and I have absolutely fallen in love with this tea! To be honest, there is NOTHING I would change in this recipe. The only thing I did have to "alter" was that I used 7 family sized tea bags instead of 15 regular size. This is my new favorite drink. Thank you for sharing this! Delicious....

Excellent. Couldn't find frozen cranberry juice concentrate so I made a half recipe with about 10 cups of water simmered with 7 tea bags and 3/4 cup of sugar. I simmered for about 15 mins then let steep for another 15. It was very dark brown. Then I mixed in a half-gallon dispenser with a 64 oz.  bottle of 100% cranberry juice, no sugar added, and filled to top with ice cubes. Perfect mix of sweet and tart.

I found this recipe while looking for ways to use up a huge container of cranberry juice I had left over from New Year's Eve. We keep sweet tea in the fridge at all times (my husband drinks it daily) so I tried this out and it was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of sweet tea and this helped mellow it out considerably. I think I'll have no problem using it up now. Thanks for the recipe!

I like less sugar, so after the first time making it like the recipe says to, I put in 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also found that putting in a bottle of ready mixed cranberry juice doesn't cut it...I HIGHLY suggest using a can of frozen cranberry juice concentrate!  It sure is good!  Very refreshing...oh, and I don't like my tea that strong, so I just use 6 tea bags now.  Thanks for the recipe!

SO tasty! The cranberry juice adds just the right touch - not overpowering at all. I can't get enough!
