4.7.19  Scaled this down to four servings and made exactly as written.  Although I loved the combo of ingredients, I thought flavor was a bit flat and needed more dressing.  So I mixed up more dressing, stirred it in, and that really brought it up to 5 stars for our taste preferences.  You get a pop of sweetness from the cranberries, a hint of sesame flavor, and a little crunch from the pecans, all together a very nice and different pasta salad.  One thing I will mention about the number of servings, they are “hearty, at least in this house.  Instead of four servings, we’ll get six.  Thanks for the new pasta salad recipe, this will be a nice side dish for so many meals.
