I was expecting it to be much better.  It was not worth all the work.  Everyone enjoyed it enyway and it was very pretty.  I decorated the cake with the cherries, whipped cream, and chocolate shavings.

Where to begin...  Well, this recipe produced a very dense cake (and not in the dense = fudgy sense).  It was heavy and actually a bit bland.  The frosting?  Well, I only added 3 cups of confectioners sugar, and it was virtually too thick to spread.  I had to use a hot spatula to get it to spread evenly.  I would not make this cake again.

A traditional Schwarzfelder Kirschtorte (Black Forest Cherry Cake) uses Schwarzfelder Kirschwasser-Black Forest Cherry Schnapps. You should use a cherry liquor instead of orange.

I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and everyone simply thought it was delicious.  One thing though, I had sprinkled flour on the cake tray before I put the cakes in, so there was powder flour on the cake tray and at the bottom of the cake as I was serving.  It was a little embarrassing, and I would not use flour as a non-stick apparatus anymore.  Nevertheless, everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It absolutely gets high scores for being quick which is very nice but it's too sweet. If I make it again I'll try adding more chocolate and cutting on the sugar.

I made this cake and changed the frosting. I made a barrier for the cherry filling with the chocolate  frosting then did a crumb frosting layer. I then frosted with whipped cream. It was great
