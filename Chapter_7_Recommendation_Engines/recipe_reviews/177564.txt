The recipe is okay but, there was something missing. So, I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and let it simmer for an additional 15 minutes and it was perfect. My very PICKY fiancee' and son loved it.

My family loved this recipe. We used cream of mushroom since we didn't have golden mushroom. It turned out really good.

This recipe is a keeper. It is easy and quick and very good. My boyfriend's parents were coming over for dinner, and we only had about an hour and a half to plan the menu, shop, and prep. This was perfect and they loved it!

This came out good.  I'm sure it would have come out better since I forgot to add the soy sauce and honey.  It had a good flavor to it next time I'll make sure not to forgot the rest of the ingredients.

Delicious recipe! I was looking for a fresh way to cook pork chops, and this definitely exceeded my expectations. I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce to balance the sweetness of the pineapple, and it turned out AMAZING. Instead of rice, I made couscous flavored with garlic, onion, and green pepper. The combination of flavors and textures made it seem like a gourmet meal from a restaurant. It looks and tastes like it was a lot of work to prepare, but it was incredibly simple. I will definitely keep this one in the front of my cookbook!

Instead of browning chops we place the chops in a baking dish raw and top with the remaining ingredients. Cook on 350 for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The pork chops soak up all the delicious flavors and are fork tender.

Slightly altered due to the amount made - I used 6 chops, 2 cans of soup, one 20 oz can of pineapple, and doubled the rest of the ingredients. I also added 1/3 cup brown sugar. I might try it again with proper proportions - there was waaaay too much liquid. It was okay.

A tasty alternative to the pork would be chicken.

It was just "okay".  Quite bland, was missing something, but not sure what.  Maybe some green pepper and/or vinegar?  I actually don't think that would have been enough to perk this up.  I was expecting more of a sweet-n-sour flavor, but it didn't have it.

I loved this recipe.  I added a can of cream of celery soup in addition to the mushroom soup to increase the amount of sauce. I used left over pork chops that I had pan grilled the day before.  I made white rice with a couple of packages of ramen noodle seasoning in it, and it was very good.  The dish came out wonderful.  The pork chops were fork tender.  I am such a picky eater, but I gobbled this one down.  My husband didn't think it was all that great, but he doesn't like things on the sweet side, and this was a little bit sweet, but not much.  I will make this again!

Yummy! Read many of the reviews that said this was bland, & a couple said they expected more of a sweet & sour flavor. This is NOT like the typical "sweet & sour pork" recipe, the sweet/sour flavors are very mild & IMO very delicious. I used the exact ingredients/amounts stated, the pineapple chunks I used were "in 100% pineapple juice" & along with clover honey it had a lovely hint of sweet/sour flavor. My soy sauce was regular Kikkoman & I did not find it too salty as some said, I hate too much salty flavor & I thought this recipe was spot on (& what's up with someone saying the salt flavor was too much because the pork is already salty....what kind of pork are they using that's already salty?) The sauce is a bit on the thin side so if you prefer a more gravy-like sauce I'd suggest omitting the water. I personally prefer a more tender pork chop that can be cut with a fork, so I went ahead & simmered for perhaps 25-30 minutes longer than the recipe states which also made my sauce thicker. I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars for flavor, but bumped it up to 5 stars because it's so incredibly easy to make.

Good flavors. Although I expected more of the pineapple flavor to come through. Next time, I'll add more. Did not taste like sweet and sour.

Very soft and tasty.  This is a quick and easy recipe.  However, the flavour doesn't have a chance to soak into the meat.  It might be a good idea to marinate the meat in pineapple juice before beginning this recipe, thereby giving the chops more flavour.

These were so wonderful. Even my husband said it was awesome after the first bite...and he doesn't like pork.  The sauce came out tasty and was a great compliment to the pork. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I added, when I warmed the dish up for left overs, i added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I would like it just a little sweeter.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It is so easy, too.

I used a fresh pineapple vs pineapple from a can. I might also try marinating the pork in the sauce overnight and then use a slow cooker to get the pork a bit more tender.

My family loved this! We're suckers for sweet/sour flavors. I changed up a couple things because I was short on time and space in my skillet. I seared eight thick chops both sides and set them in a casserole dish, cooked up the onions with some chopped garlic cloves, then put that on top of the chops. Mixed double the soup, honey, etc, in a bowl then dumped that all over the top and baked it at 400 degrees checking every 10min til it was cooked thoroughly. Mine took a little longer because I made the mistake of trying to use half frozen chops instead of thawed! Oh well, still came out great! We made some plain rice with mixed stir fry veggies on the side and used the extra sauce from the pan as a nice drizzle. Next time though, I would probably use less water! It seemed to be very runny, less saucy than I wanted it. :) Cheers!
