Hands down one of the best pot roasts I've ever made. Marinated overnight. Only had fresh mint so that's what I used. (8 whole leaves). Reached temp at 6 hours so we took it out of the roasting pan and wrapped it well in tin foil for an hour before we shredded it. It just fell apart. The juices have a fair amount of oil so if you want au jus you need to skim that fat! Balsamic is prominent but not overpowering. This is a fantastic recipe! Thanks DrObviousSo!

I crockpotted this for our family and while it was edible no one was impressed enough for me to make it again. I halved the vinegar because I didn't have 2 cups and it was plenty. But for me it was too vinegary. I'd prefer something else but if you love vinegar give it a try.
