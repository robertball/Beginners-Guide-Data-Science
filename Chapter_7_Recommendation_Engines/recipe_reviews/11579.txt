I used a smaller pan than specified, because I wanted the bars to be a little thicker.  These are best eaten warm (with a plate to catch the crumbs!) with a big glass of milk!  Also - it's not noted in the recipe - but use UN-salted peanuts!!!!   Thanks - I loved these - the sweetness level was very subtle - which was refreshing!!

The cookies were not very tasty and had a texture that made them even less appealing.

This was very thick. The pan size used is wrong you should probably use something smaller. The batter sadly tastes better than the finished product. If you want something good share make something else not this. Sorry to be harsh but it's not that good.
