I decided to try these in my slow cooker, as I don't own a pressure cooker and they were wonderful!!  I didn't precook them, and just doubled the recipe, adding the spices to the water and ketchup, along with some minced garlic.  I cooked them on low for 10 hours and they were so tender, the meat fell off the bone.  They didn't taste like barbecue, but they had an incredible flavor.  I'll definitely make these again!!!

Very quick, very easy, and loved by my kids.  We adjusted the following, though, removed hot sauce, put in worcestshire sauce.  Its hard to introduce kids to a new recipe, but this went over well!

This is an easy, excellent and most tasty receipe for cooking country style pork ribs.  The meat was so tender it simply melted in one's mouth!

I served it with macoroni and cheese and creamed spinach.  It was a big hit!

Quick and easy.  Taste was okay, but somewhat bland.  There wasn't much "rib" taste; if not for the bones, you would not have known what cut of pork was used.  There are much better rib recipes here.

I didn't really like this.  My Husband did like it and it was a different way to make Pork Ribs. Cooked in the slow cooker and it came out really tender but the flavor isn't my gig.  I am not a fan of hot pepper sauce or barbeque flavor.  I would make again for family though.  It was pretty easy.

Nice and tender but really bland.  Needs more spice.  Something was missing.

This is so good and so easy - not to mention it is ready in no time!  I add a little extra ketchup and chili powder, it makes a super tasty gravy, and I serve it over rice. YUM!

Made this in the crockpot (first time purchasing and eating country ribs - it was on sale) and it came out nice and tender after 9-10 hours.  The ketchup mix really thinned out though and I didn't taste that or the chili. I would add worcestershire sauce to it and other spices next time.  Won't buy this cut of meat again though - not really into that much pork - but I will use this recipe in the crockpot for other dishes.  It's a very gentle flavor that doesn't overpower the pork.  But not a BBQ flavor though so don't be misled by the name.

Excellent recipe.  Like another reviewer said, it's not a barbecue sauce flavor.  Instead, it's a tomato-ey sauce that thickens upon standing and is even better the next day.  I made it in the pressure cooker and substituted some worcestershire sauce for the hot sauce (didn't have any).  Would be great over rice or with potatoes.
