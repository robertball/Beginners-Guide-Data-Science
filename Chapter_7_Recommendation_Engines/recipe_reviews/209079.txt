I made this exactly as stated, and it was good but INCREDIBLY spicy. It was very hearty - a good warm, autumn meal, and the pork was delicious and fell right apart - but almost so spicy I couldn't enjoy the other flavors. I ate with a side of cottage cheese to counteract the spice. I'm extremely curious to see what this is like without any peppers. I do enjoy mild spice, so next time I will leave the peppers out completely and use red pepper flakes instead, which will allow me to start with a little and add more to taste. The two chipotle peppers in this recipe just seem a little too overpowering! I'm also considering the addition of some fresh apple slices and brown sugar. I do think it was a fun, autumn-y concept, and I will make again, although I will try toning down the spice from super-hot to mildly-hot.

I cooked this tonight and it was a big hit with the family. Instead of the canned apple pie filling, I used three large fresh fuji apples, sliced and coated with a bit of cinnamon and raw sugar. I removed the seeds from the peppers to tone it down a bit so it wouldn't be too hot for my 2 year old, but I think I will leave them next time because it wasn't spicy at all. Even without the bit of spice I was hoping for, it still turned out delicious and I will definitely make this again.

Very good! For those who do not like food very spicy just cut open the chipotle peppers and take the seeds out with a knife. This will cut down on the heat a lot.

DO NOT LEAVE THE CHIPOTLE PEPPERS OUT! The flavor of the smokey Adobo Sauce is what makes this recipe great.  It will not be achieved by red pepper flakes!  In fact, if I were you, I would pour a little Adobo Sauce straight in the gravy.    Here are my thoughts:  Do it for 6 to 8 hours on low heat.  Doing it the quick way makes it slightly too tough.    Add the apple pie filling just before it's done.  Like maybe an hour or less - other wise they dissolve (though the sweet flavor is amazing).  When I make this again, I'm going to put fresh apple chunks in as well (from the beginning).  My husband says this is the best thing I've ever made. If you have some super-sensitivity to heat, stay away.  But if you enjoy flavor, dig in!

A good dish with a true balance of sweet and hot! Very different. Husband really enjoyed it. Based on other reviewers here were my tweeks: I used a good piece of pork shoulder, two chipotles (with some seeds), two heaping teaspoons of adobo sauce, I used fresh apples peeled and cubed coated with cinnamon sugar which I added during the last hour of cooking. Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I may try using yams rather than sweet potatoes, I will add one additional chipotle pepper and more adobo sauce, and I will try cooking the apple even less time so they aren't so mushy. Otherwise, the flavors are very good.

This was an incredible slow cooker recipe!  I skipped the pie filling and used fresh apples seasoned with sugar and cinnamon, as suggested by other reviewers.  It will make a perfect fall/winter meal.

This turned out great!  I did only put in 1 chipotle pepper and that was plenty of heat.  Left it sit all day in the crock and the meat just fell apart.  I didn't end up thickening the juices but it was still very good!

My family loved this recipes.  I have 7 growing boys so I had to add extra sweet potates and added 5 extra apples and cooked it on slow for 8 hours.  The gravy was the best part and it turned out perfect!  Will defintely make it again!

This is very spicy!!! Even my husband, who loves spicy food, said to cut down on the pepper next time. I had used 2 peppers and about a tsp. of the sauce. I didn't add the apple pie filling until about an hour before it was done as others suggested. I had sliced the sweet potatoes, but I wish I would have just quartered them or cut in half, because they turned to mush.

This was really tasty.  I made it as stated except I added 10-15 baby carrots, and one peeled, chopped apple.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and the meat was juicy, tender and flavorful.  I really enjoyed the spicy smokiness and will definitely make this one again!

made as directed only leaving out the peppers and using crushed red peppers to taste instead. the meat was dry, tough, and tasteless. the potatoes practically disolved. i ended up making grilled cheese for my 2 year old, and then decided i'd rather have that too. my husband ate it and said it was ok, but he didn't go back for seconds and didn't complain when i didn't save the leftovers.

I made this last night.  Liked it and will serve it again.  No Pork Shoulder at the store, so I used a Pork Loin Roast.  Things I would do differently:  ONE chipotle pepper is more then enough!!  I used two and even scooped out 98% of the seeds and there was still a lot of HEAT!!  I might up the salt to a tsp as well.  I also substituted regular potatoes for the sweet potatoes.

This was fabulous - very tasty. The meat was extremely tender. I did everything as-is, but I left out the peppers - 'cause of my little kids. My 16 yo daughter ate a second helping later for dessert :)

I took the advice of other reviewers and took the seeds out of the peppers.  I also used white potatoes since my family won't eat sweet potatoes.  Very good flavor and everyone gobbled it up!!

Very spicy. I loved it! I will definitely make it again. Used the low heat for 8 hours.  Used fresh, chopped apples at the start. Delicious!

Prepared according to the directions,  this was good enough to try again. It was only a little spicy; nobody at the table found it at all objectionable heat-wise.  Next time I'll try putting the veggies in the crockpot first and use chicken broth instead of water to thicken the gravy which needed a little more flavor.  I'll also try using fresh apples with sugar & maybe some cinnamon as others have mentioned.  Pork was very tender, cooked on low heat for 7 hours.

I made this and it was a hit. I did not think it was too spicy at all, so base your chipotle needs on personal taste.  We got two meals out of this, too. The next day I shredded up the pork and made bbq sandwiches with it, using bottled bbq sauce and some of the leftover gravy from the roast. Then I mashed the leftover sweet potato and apple mixture and heated that up for smashed sweet potatoes. It was really good!

I would make this again, the pork is succulent, it's an easy recipe, the sweet potatoes are very tender and the sauce really doesn't need thickening. It's lightly spiced from the chipotle, but it is missing something. A little more salt and pepper helped, some cinnamon...still not quite right. I'll figure out what it is the next time I make it! I would recommend not adding the apples until about half way through the cooking time so they keep their shape a bit.

I did not care for this & my 11 year old & husband were not impressed either.  Too sweet for me.  I was expecting smokey & spicy like the description said, but I guess with the apple pie filling & sweet potatoes & the name of the recipe, I should have known it was going to be sweet.  Several reviewers said two peppers were too much.  Not in my opinon.  Still too sweet.  I cubed the potatoes bigger hoping they wouldn't be mushy, but they were just not good either.  The pork was somewhat dry around outside, but moist in the middle and the bottom.  My son & I ended up using Famous Daves BBQ sauce with the pork just to eat it.  I will not be making this again.

This is the BEST fall dish with the sweet potatoes and apples. I've made it in the last two years. I just omit the chile peppers, as I don't like spicy food. You end up with a sweet and hearty pork meal.

Very easy and lots of delicious flavors going on.  Just take the seeds out of the chipotles if they are too hot for you.  I had alot of the veggies and stuff still left, I just pureed it into a yummy sweet potato soup, that I topped with parmasean cheese.

This dish was delish! And the ease of it really made it a winner. Both my husband and I agreed that it wasn't spicy enough, and I used three peppers instead of two. I halved the potatoes and left the peel on, and added them the last two hours of cooking and they came out perfect. I will make this again!

This was a great recipe but I changed a lot... I couldn't find chipotle peppers so instead I dumped half a jar of salsa on top of the pork. Didn't have apple pie filling so I just cut up some apples, mixed with brown sugar and cinnamon and dumped on top. I loved it this way! Not too spicy and a great different recipe than plain old crock pot pork.

The chipotle chile peppers saved this dish, imo... otherwise, I think this is too sweet, even though I had used fresh apples instead of the apple pie filling and 3 chipotle peppers instead of two,

Wow! This recipe was delicious!  I,of course, tweaked it a bit to ingredients I had on hand, and halved the recipe to fit in my 1 quart slow cooker.  I used 1 lb boneless pork loin chops and instead of the sweet potato(which I didn't have), I threw in some left over mashed sweet potato and a fresh apple cut up with a sprinkle of cinnamon on top instead of the canned apple.  Cooked on low 6 hours.  Definitely will make this again!

This was good, but not my favorite thing.  My husband and kids LOVED it, though.

Sorry but I followed the recipe to a "T" and all I can say is... It was icky.
What a waste of a beautiful pork roast and sweet potatoes. It's the apple pie filling it gives it a queer taste. A taste that is just awful. I tried doctoring it up afterward but there is nothing on this earth that can help this. It was a very stomach churning, taste with the chipotle peppers as well. Sorry but will never make this again :(

3* as originally written, but with the potential to be much better.

Per other reviewer's suggestions, I used fresh apples coated in cinnamon and sugar. I added them a few hours after the pork and sweet potatoes, to keep them from getting mushy. Also added white wine in the crockpot.

Next time, I will use 1/2 or more of a small can of adobo chiles, with the seeds scraped out--my first try turned out too bland.

I made this recipe as stated with one fairly big exception, using fresh apples instead of the canned pie filling.  I didn't add any sugar, and thought it tasted great.  I may have found it too sweet if I'd used the sweetened pie filling.  I used one apple that I chopped finely, so it had mostly dissolved into the sauce, and another I diced into bite sized pieces.  Added both at the beginning of cooking.  I liked this and will make it again, but it's not quite a 5 star recipe in my book.  I'll update my review if I figure out any additional tweaks to bring it up a notch.
