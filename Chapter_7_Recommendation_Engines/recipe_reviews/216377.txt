I had a friend that made me porcupine balls and i wanted to find a recipe similar to it, but this was not it. I did not like the texture of the meatballs, and wish I had browned them first before letting them simmer in the sauce, otherwise they seemed too mushy to me. The overall flavor was okay, I added onions to the meat, and some Worcestershire sauce and mustard to the actual sauce for more flavor.

Very fast and easy plus good on a budget. I did put my own twist on it and fried meatballs before putting in sauce. Served with extra rice on the side. Will make again thanks.

Made this for my family tonite and thought it would be a bigger hit than it was. Took the advice of Jillbby.xo and added chopped onion and garlic salt, but my family was not excited. If I make it again will add sweet bell peppers.

Didn't like that the meatballs were cooked in the sauce.  Meatballs didn't have any flavor.
