Absolutely fabulous!!  I was looking for a nice recipe to use some of my friend's home grown rhubarb, and I am SO glad I tried this one! I didn't have any white sugar left, so I used brown instead, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out beautifully, and drove me crazy with the wonderful aroma while it baked. I managed to control myself, wrapped it in foil when it had cooled, and allowed it to sit overnight. I had a piece the next morning with a cup of coffee and couldn't believe how delicious it was! You definitely do need to let it sit overnight though. It was difficult to cut even then as it was so moist and tender! Use a serrated knife for the best outcome. The next day, it was easier to cut, but it is quite a delicate cake even though it is fairly dense at the same time. 

I will be making this a LOT! And I'm sure it would be a great recipe to change up a bit, too, like using blueberries and almonds, or apricots and walnuts, but I must say the rhubarb is so delicious, I'll be sticking to the original recipe for the most part.

Love it love it love it, and thanks for sharing!

I baked the bread in mini loaf pans to give to several neighbors. My family ate it all up before I could give it away. Mini loaves baked in 36 minutes. Will make again. Apples would work well in this recipe.

It was delicious--moist and so good with the cinnamon and nuts. I would make no changes.

Made it per recipe.  Used thawed, previously frozen rhubarb.  Came out moist and delicious.

this is an outstanding bread.   Not too sweet (except for the topping), and stays moist for a few days.   Very, very good.  I will make this many times again in future!

The loaf turned out just as pictured and got rave reviews at the coffee hour to which I brought it. 
I did need to bake it another 20 minutes, perhaps because I used a Corning Ware baking dish. My one disappoinment was that it didn't taste like rhubarb. I could have used milder berries for the same sweet taste.
