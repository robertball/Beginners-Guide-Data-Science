I liked these a lot, I don't think my guests enjoyed them as much.  I think it depends on how much you like the unique flavor of black walnuts.

I used regular walnuts (had them on hand)...and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips and a little extra vanilla the first time I made this...EVERYONE LOVED them! And it's so easy! I'm making them again today...it's now the 3rd time in 2 months my boyfriend has requested "those walnut cookie things"...Thanks for the recipe!

I know the pic I added to this recipe doesn't really depict the cookie as recipe is written. I was having a Halloween party and waanted to make witch finger cookies. I had black walnuts I neeed to use and knew the nuts in them would make it look like warts on the fingers..LOL
I think they are delicious and have been wanting to make these again after trying them a cpl yrs ago...and this was my opportunity. Next time I make them, I will make them in balls as the recipe dictates...and there will be a next time because I just love black walnuts.

I used pecans, since as a child we always had Noel Nut Balls.  My favorite cookie all time.  This was the exact recipe I was looking for.  Thanks

Five stars for ease of making! My 5 year old nephew helped me mix and roll these up and we had a great time! You must REALLY like black walnuts to like these, they carry a strong flavor! I got rave reviews on them, and them some people just flat didn't like them. A close friend of mine even threw it away after one bite. Then my grandmother raved over them...so...4 stars!

The black walnut flavor comes through very strongly, which is wonderful for those of us who LOVE black walnuts.
