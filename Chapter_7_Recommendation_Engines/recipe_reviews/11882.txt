This salad was a hit both times I made it.  The second time I made some chages that I think made it better:  I used a pint of grape tomatoes cut in half, 1 red onion, and a green pepper.  It gave it a little more color and texture.  I also used bow-ties, which made it a little easier to handle, the macaroni is hard when you don't have anything to hold it together, and doubled the ground mustard for extra flavor.  Very refreshing and perfect for a summer party!

I have served this salad many times, and always get asked for the recipe.  It's a wonderful salad.  The only thing I do different is that I substitute Tri Colored Rotini for the macaroni, and if making a 1 # box of Rotini, I triple the marinade portion, while adding appropriate vegetables for the size I am doing.  It's worth trying.

This was a nice change from the mayo type macaroni salad. I had something similar to it in a restaurant and it was very tasty. I've made it a couple of times and will keep the recipe to make it again. I've also used the vinegarette dressing ingredients by themselves in some other dishes that are variations on the macaroni salad when I didn't have all the exact ingredients for this dish.

I really really liked this salad.  I usually like a creamy salad, but couldn't find a recipe I liked, so I settled with this one and was really satisfied with it!!  I don't like sweet salads, and reading some of the comments beforehand, decided to use just 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2.  I also used a whole english cucumber instead of the 4 the recipe called for, an entire bunch of green onion instead of 2 regular onions and added about a half of a green pepper as well.  It's just delicious, and I will definitely, definitely make it again.............soon.

Wow!! I really like this salad.  It is lighter and more flavorful than the mayo versions.  After reading what some of the other reviews were, I cut the sugar to a half a cup.  I also used celery, onions, green pepper and canned diced tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again

This has become a family favorite and my daughter will be making this for our Christmas family get together this year. I had to look it up again to print out a copy for her so thought I would leave a review. Thanks to Rina for sharing. Very easy and very good!

Made this for a recent party and tripled the recipe, except I only used about 3/4 C. Sugar total, and adjusted the vegetable amounts.  Added sliced black olives, diced red and green peppers, and used Bowtie pasta. It was a huge hit and more than one person asked for the recipe. Everyone loved the fact that it was not made with mayo, but a vinaigrette-style dressing.  Thanks for a wonderful salad recipe which I'll be making often.

We really enjoyed this.  I ended up trying this at the last minute since I had made Kim's Macaroni Salad (on this site) and realized that Kim's would be way to spicy for many, especially children.  I ended up serving both salads and they both disappeared - I guess I satisfied tastes of both kinds.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe.

My daughter made this salad. We used various tomatoes from our yard, english cucumber, and corn sliced from the cob. We also substituted fresh mint for the parsley and used penne because we had it on hand. It was terrific!

Made this recipe for a luau.  Got rave reviews.  It is definitely a keeper.  Did not put the dressing over the macaroni until about an hour before serving, that way the macaroni did not soak up all the dressing.

I wasnt sure about this recipe while making it, but it was a hit at dinner and at work the next day.  For lunch at work I marinated & grilled some chicken breast to add to it for protien.  Everyone was impressed and it is soooo easy to make, this is a keeper

I thought this was a great mac salad.  A little too sweet so next time I would decrease the amount of sugar.  I also used baby cucumbers and added black olives it was a worthy addition.  I will definitely make this again.

Not too bad. However, it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but everyone else liked it. I usually like macaroni salads with a creamier dressing. I would probably make this again.

I hate cucumbers[lol], so I made this without them!  I used 2 very large Jersey tomatoes and also added a tablespoon of chopped chives and sun-dried tomato flakes.  (I also used white wine vinegar)  It was AWESOME!  A super recipe for tomato lovers.

This is an excellent recipe. It seems like alot of veggies and pasta compared to the dressing but it works out perfectly as it is written. I used dried parsley instead of fresh, because that is what I had on hand. I will definatly take this dish to my next picnic or family reunion.

This dressing was horrible. I tried adding all sorts of things to it to save it (fresh garlic, more vinegar, mayo, soya sauce) and while they made it taste better than it did at first, I still ended up chucking the dressing. Thank goodness I tasted it before mixing it into the veggies and macaroni! I made a simple dressing out of ranch dressing and mayo, with some spicy brown mustard for a little kick... At least I didn't have to discard the pasta mixture. Thanks for the recipe, but I'll stick with ANYTHING but this. :)

AWESOME!!  I had a  potluck at work today and made this salad for the 1st time..needless to say they LOVED it.  I could have made more!  My hubby finsihed it off tonight and said it was the best macaroni salad he has ever eaten! SUPER!!

I doubled the mustard and garlic powders (cuz I like them)used 1/3 Cup of Splenda in place of the white sugar.  Made it "friendlier" for my WW friends and it was still AWESOME! :O)

Thank you for such a super recipe!!

This salad is great! I made it for a barbecue instead of the usual macaroni salad because I ran out of mayo. What a surprise! This salad is light and refreshing. Noone missed the regular macaroni salad and there were no leftovers. I substituted wine vinegar and omitted the fresh parsley. I added some sliced black olives for color. Thanks for the recipe Rina.

This recipe turned out very well with the little changes I did.  First, I omitted
parsley just for preferential reasons, 2nd, I used 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon of balsamic 
vinegar for a different taste.  It came out great.  I used the vinegarette on some
rib eyes we had and they gave a really great flavor.  Good all around recipe.

This was really well recieved by a group of people I made if for.  One person thought it was a bit too sugary.  I made it again with a little less sugar (called for half, used a third) and also added in about 1 cup of shredded carrots.  Not bad. Really worth making.  Best if you have something that can cut up the cucumbers for you! :)  Also, best after sitting overnight!

This salad was quick and easy to prepare.  Even the kids liked it.  I added grape tomatoes too and it was a smash hit at the barbeque.  Thanks.

A nice pasta salad with a non-creamy dressing.  This worked great with the fresh veggies from the garden.  And, it held up well in the fridge for a few days.

Fantastic!  Tried this last night and  I think I'm going to make this again today. Just delicious and I prefer this over creamy macaroni salads. Thanks for the recipe!

Added some sliced kalamata olives and chopped yellow bell peppers for a little more color, otherwise, followed the recipe.  This is a nice break from the heavier, but traditional, mayo-based macaroni salad.  It had just the right balance of sweet-sour for us.***UPDATE 4.9.13***Unlike mayo-based macaroni salad, this held up very well overnight.  Had for lunch today.
