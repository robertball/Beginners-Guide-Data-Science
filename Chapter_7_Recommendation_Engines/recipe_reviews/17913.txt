Although this cake came out looking very good, I found it a bit too bland and a little dry.  Next time I would put in more butter and some vanilla flavoring.

Was very good tasting but I think there may have been an error in posting of the recipe. It said cook for 20-25 mins at 350. It  took at least double that time. It was still a great cake and I used a buttercream frosting that went wonderfully with the cake. Thank you.

Good poundcake!4 stars only to leave room for improvement.After the review saying the cake was dry and bland I decided to add 1/2 cup butter,1/2 cup sour cream,1/2 t mexican vanilla(Poundcakes are expensive and I didn't want my ingredients wasted on a dry,bland recipe).I used a greased and floured bundt pan.It turned out beautiful and tasted delicious.The ONLY thing I would change is that it was a little porous for my taste.I like a DENSE pound cake.We ate with strawberries and whipped cream.It was a big hit!

I picked this recipe because I had most of the ingredients on hand. it was really easy to make and tasted great. I did add some vanilla extract when i was creaming the sugar and butter. it was a very sweet cake but still good

This cake did not turn out very sweet, which may be a good thing, depending on who you're serving it to. The taste of the eggs is quite strong also. In the future I would try to reduce the number of eggs and increase the amount of sugar just a tad.

My whole family liked the cake.  We used is with strawberries and ice cream.  PERFECT!  Light and sweet.  I made cupcakes with it however and that didn't work so well.  Next time I will try making a loaf as suggested.

I should have read the reviews first - need to double the baking time - needs more butter and you need to add vanilla extract

I am making the cake for the first time tonight. I had the cake in the oven for 30 min and it still wiggled and was undone. I am planning to cook for at least 45 min. I added vanilla extract for flavor and am planning on sprinkling with nutmet and cinnamon once I have it out for eating.

The crumb was coarse and dry. It offered little more than an eggy flavor despite adding pure vanilla to the recipe. The baking time was incorrect for bundt cake baking, as it was still unset and wiggled at 25 minutes. I baked this recipe for 40 minutes. The firm crust was more tasty than the cake's body.
