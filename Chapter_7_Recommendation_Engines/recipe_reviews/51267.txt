after reading this recipe 5 years ago, I suggested to our chamber of commerce director we do this for our food booth at the annual Senior Pro Rodeo only make it as a filling for breakfast burritos.  Our booth is there only for the participants.  We have to have the coffee hot and donuts fresh at 7:30 in the morning, because they are getting ready to go through their trials for the nights line-up.  I found this and tweaked it for 50 servings, substituted cooked, ground sausage for ham, nixed the bell pepper, bought flour tortillas,salsa and extra shredded cheese.  We cook this overnight at home, bring the crockpot to the food booth and assemble to make breakfast burritos. We take a tortilla, a decent serving of the omelet, an extra sprinkle of cheese, wrap up individually in foil, and lay them in another crockpot that has a damp towel at the bottom. the damp towel keeps everything steamy hot.  as they are bought, they put their own salsa on. We made them in 25 serving batches.(Two smaller crockpots) word spread quickly we had something better than donuts. we have sold out every year after the 1st year (once they found out)   we also found the second morning (after the first nights show, afterwards they went into town for the dance and drank alot) we sold out faster on the second morning than the first morning.  so we didn't make as much the first morning, and had more for the second morning. it is not labor intensive, and we 3 volunteers get together the night before the rodeo

Love the versatility of this recipe!  Have made this recipe several times at the request of my co-workers.  I have tweaked it each time depending on what type of group I was serving. Have used browned italian sausage (mild to spicy), pre-cubed ham and even bacon. For ease, frozen chopped onions/green peppers and for color, yellow/red peppers.  Used shredded mexi-cheese for a spicier taste or four-cheese blends for a mild one.  In the eggs, I added dry mixed italian seasonings, chopped garlic and a dash of dijon mustard.  Cooked just fine at about 11 hours on low.  For sides, I have served it with hot sauce, fresh salsa or pico de gallo, sour cream and more shredded cheese so people could season it more if they liked.  Haven't had a complaint on it yet :)

The first time I made this exactly according to the recipe and took it to a meeting.  It was well liked but had quite a bit leftover.  I'm not a big fan of ham so this time I made it with sage sausage and red bell pepper instead of green.  I also added 1/4 tsp of ground mustard and used a fresh potato instead of frozen. Since the starch turns brown, had to rinse it.  I should have rolled it in a paper towel to absorb the extra moisture.  That was the only issue I ran into using a fresh potato - the extra moisture.  I took it to my meeting and it disappeared.

The first time I made this recipe just as written and have made this a number of times with some changes. So you don't end up with dry eggs; the type of  crock pot is very important to the cooking time.  Your narrow, tall cylinder time will take longer to cook then a large oval crock pot by 1 to 2 hours difference.  I love this recipe because you can make some changes to your family or guests tastes.  Place all the ingredients in your crock pot the night before retiring for the evening and your breakfast is ready in the morning.  These are some of the ingredients I have used: Purchased frozen hash browns with onion, green and red peppers.  Try using 2 pounds cooked, crumbled, well drained, sausage instead of ham.  We prefer 1 # original and 1 # hot sausage for that extra zing.  I use pepper but fine sausage or ham have enough salt for our family.  Try using your families favorite salt free seasonings for a different taste.  Mixed in the egg mixture.  Also try different cheese blends.  I prefer using half and half instead of milk and increasing by an additional 1/2 cup.  Using skim, 2%, whole milk, half and half or cream will alter the taste.  Experiment, you might be surprised of the difference in taste and texture.   If you use a purchased liner for your crock pot before adding the ingredients; clean up is a breeze. I would give this recipe a 10 star rating if I could.

This recipe was good but definately needed some tweaking.  I did not put hash browns or ham in.  I browned a pound of sausage, added the onions, green peppers, eggs and milk and put them all int the slow cooker.  In the morning when it was done, I sprinkled the cheese on top.  We loved it.

I read some of the reviews on this and modified the following: changed ham to half a pound, browned up half pound of sausage and added it.  Changed the cheese from cheddar to the Mexican blend.  To the eggs I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I got some great feedback from everyone eating the breakfast!  Will make again!

Loved the variation with hash browns - hadn't tried that before.  Omitted the onions and peppers due to finicky children and included ham, sausage and bacon.  Took to a school class breakfast and it was gone in no time and had several ask for recipe!  I made 1 1/2 recipes and it filled the the 5 qt crock pot.

I have a few comments on this recipe  and previous comments. The recipe is vague on two things: what size crock pot to use and amount of salt. Lots of people said it was dry and flavorless, some suggested salt and other spices. I used seasoning salt with powdered garlic and onion and I used 'bout 3/4 tbsp. It was enough to give it good flavor. I added pepper on after cooking because my daughter abhores pepper. Ham definitely isn't enough. I used bacon and ham, but I think sausage would have been good too. Also, personal preference, I used two peppers; one red, one green; makes it more colorful and have more variety. And after it was done cooking, I cut up some tomato and put it on top too. I think this recipe is perfect for a 4 qt. crock, which is what I have and it came out perfect. For the gentleman who came out with a "burnt paper weight", who redced the recipe to thirds, I believe he probably had a 6 qt. Either that or he took the cook time at face value and just halved that. I made the full recipe and it is done in 6 and a half hours. He should have made it for a brunch, as 3 hours probably would have been more than plenty. If reducing the recipe, the crock should always be at least 1/2 full with something like this or you probably will wind up with something charred. The woman who said eggs aren't meant for the slow cooker I believe to be unadventurous. Yes, this would work in the oven. But it is also good in the crock as long as you don't cook it for half a day.

I adjusted recipe to 4 servings and after 9 hours woke up to a very burned and hard breakfast. My wife came to the rescue and made us an omelet and it tasted great.
Makes a good boat anchor or paper weight.

Yes, this recipe was very simple.. the hardest was chopping the pepper, onion & ham.  Great having breakfast ready when you first get up.  I would like a little more stovetop, browned flavor, but then I find that true with many slow cooker recipes I've tried.  It gave a pretty appearance as I substituted green onion for white and red bell pepper for the green.  Would probably look nice for a Christmas morning breakfast.

Made this several times, and have never had the trouble others noted with burning/overcooking/dryness...now I am wondering if it is because each time I use egg substitute instead of cracking a dozen eggs? (I'm a lazy cook!)...maybe the more liquid/fluid nature of the EggBeaters helps permeate the other ingredients?  Still tastes great! I do add a full 2 cups of cheese, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  For this morning, I prepped one crock pot with sweet Italian sausage and a bit of onion and regular eggbeaters...in the other, red and green peppers, onions, fresh mushrooms, and southwestern style eggbeaters.  I love, love the breakfast burrito idea--this is how we serve them every time! (build-yer-own, with  small flour or whole wheat tortillas, salsa, green salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese, and tobasco as desired).  Family/Friend Fave!

I  put this in a 6QT slow cooker, used sausage instead of ham, used evaporated milk instead of milk, and added some seasonings as recommended by other reviewers. I cooked it on low for 6 hours, pushing the contents down further into the crock pot after about 3 hours (til the liquid came up to the top). Turned out great. I'll definitely be making this again.

Breakfast made easy – if you have an older crockpot/ slow cooker.  I made this as written with the addition of fresh spinach.  I wanted this for dinner, so I stated the crockpot before leaving for work.  It was on low for 8 hours and it was done and was probably done at the 7 hour mark.  It would have been burnt if I had cooked for 10-12 hours.  I made this in newer crockpot and they cook much hotter than the older models.  This was good and very filling.  I let rest about 25 minutes before serving and it served nicely in wedges.    I believe the edge of the casserole gets brown from the cheese touching the sides of the cooker.  I like the idea of this recipe, but will try a smaller version in my older, smaller slow cooker.  This egg casserole was served this with toast and fresh fruit.  It makes a lot, so we had leftovers for breakfast.  This recipe has been around since 2002, before the newer cookers.  That being said, knowing that the new slow cookers cook much faster, I'm still giving this 4-stars with the warning to keep an eye on this dish.

I'm giving this five stars based on the following changes:  Don't cook it in the crockpot.  I use a 9x13 pan (can prepare the night before and stick in the fridge, then pop into a 375 degree oven until the eggs are set).  I also use bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled, instead of the ham.  I wait and put the cheese on top at the end of the cook time.  It *will taste bland* unless you salt and pepper it - you have to remember there are a dozen eggs in here plus the hash brown potatoes, neither of which has any seasoning.  I am normally light-handed with salt, and prefer to let each person adjust seasonings on their plate.  I also hardly ever use the full dozen eggs - I cut it down to 6 to 8 depending on how many people I'm feeding.  It WILL stick to the pan unless you spray it VERY well, or you could use parchment paper on the bottom for quicker cleanup. As this recipe is originally written, I can understand why there have been so many unhappy reviews.  With some tweaking, this is can be a very good recipe which is easy for breakfast if you assemble the night before.  :o)

Good and easy.  I wanted to test this recipe, so we had breakfast for dinner tonight.  I made 1/2 recipe, and cooked on low for 4-hours in my old, trusty 4-qt Rival Crock Pot.  I used  XL eggs, no green bell pepper, but otherwise followed the directions.  (I would not want to cook this any longer than 4-hours with 1/2 recipe.  Maybe just 3 1/2  hours.)  Next time I will add the green bell pepper, use a spicy sausage instead of the ham, and other ingredients/spices.  Also, I liked the review "Paperlady" made on 31 July 2008---good idea for breakfast burritos.  This is a good slow cooker recipe that may be adapted to suit everyone's taste.  Reviewers comments were helpful too. Thank you CSBCOKE for sharing your recipe!

Not sure what went wrong.  I put it in layers as the recipe called for, used sausage I cooked and started the omelet on low about 11pm.  By 6am it was burnt all around the edges and the middle was mush.  I won't make this again.  I think the concept was fantastic, but not so good in flavor.

Great recipe.  Just make sure you keep the cheese away from the bottom and sides of the slow cooker because even in 8-9 hours it will start to turn dark and taste bad.  Great for busy mornings before kid's basketball games.

Very dry and rather bland.  Appearance was overall blah, as was the taste.  Wasted a dozen eggs on this one. Maybe cutting down on the amount of potatoes or adding more liquid would help.  Would not make again!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and had a burnt-on mess after about 5 hours on low. The water from the hash browns made the eggs separate in a very odd way.  Something is terribly wrong with this recipe as written.  Sorry!

Cooks up more like a crustless Quiche IMHO and this is what I grew up with as a "Denver Omelet" while the "Western Omelet" I'm familiar with has browned ground beef, sliced mushrooms & onions and provolone cheese.  Must be a regional thing.

This was a great recipe...however it did NOT take 10-12 hours it took 6 hours so because it needed to sit in the slow cooker for so long the edges burned a little bit but the middle was great and it was so easy!  I omited the green peper and onion and it was still great.  I did add some onion powder and that added great flavor...Do not cook it for as long as it says!

Very versatile! I did follow other suggestions and only cooked this for about 6.5 hours on low and it turned out wonderfully! There are only 2 of us in the house so I froze the remaining portions and we had it for breakfast for a month!

Was visually unappealing. I love all of the ingredients and the idea of a slow cooker omelet.  In reality though, it just doesn't work.

Very tasty and easy to assemble. I used browned sausage without the green peppers. Even when the power went out and I woke up to a cold, partially cooked meal, I was able to finish cooking on High and serve for Mother's Day on time. I plan to make this every Monday morning for my 3 sons.

I made this recipe for 18 on a 6QT ceramic crock pot set on LOW.  At 9 hours it was burning on the edges, bottom and top.  Interestingly, the flavor was good and the eggs were eaten right up to the "burned crust" that created a bowl of sorts.  I used 1-1/2 lbs Bacon Pieces rather than ham, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper.  It was plenty salty and flavorful; just unattractively dark and burned looking on the outside. I served with hot tortillas with salsa, and tabasco condiments.  I'll make again; but, will definately tweak the cooking time.  Even for 18 servings the cook time could easily be 7 to 7-1/2 hours on low, maybe less.  I might even try 2 hours on High.  Thanks to all for sharing the recipe and ideas!

My fiance and I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out really bad.  Not only was it WAY overdone, but it was really bland.  We threw it out - totally wasted 12 eggs.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and it was a total flop. I started it on low at 12:15am and by 7am it was overdone, dry, and burnt. My slow cooker is a 6 qt. but I thought that the decreased cooking time would make up for the larger pot. Plus the recipe says 4 qt. or larger. I would not try this again...even adding more ingredients to make a larger dish.

This recipe tasted ok but was not much to look at.  My husband would not even try it and my kids were not thrilled that I made them eat it.  My husband has strongly requested (forbidden) that this recipe not be served in our home again. If you do try this recipe here is a hint, I used the hashbrowns that had onion and bell pepper in them instead of chopping up my own.

I adjusted this recipe for 3 servings and it came out delicious! It cooked in about 6 hours. Next time I want to substitute a can of drained spinach for the ham, onion and pepper, for a spinach omelet. I imagine you could use anything you would put in a regular omelet.

Was a little hesitant to try this, where eggs and milk were involved; especially when it took a while to cook it. However the results were delicious! Absolutely delicious!!!

The only change I did was instead of using salt and pepper, I used Italian seasoning; and the results are out of this world! This recipe is a keeper!

I made this for a breakfast pot luck for the office.  I followed the directions exactly, but followed the suggestion from another and used sage sausage instead of ham.  Cooked for 8 hours and smelled wonderful!  But when we went to eat it, it was dry.  Needless to say, I still had half of what I brought in. I don't know where I went wrong?  I think if I baked it, it would have been better.

Some important things to note about this particular recipe...  While the idea of having a ready-made breakfast is quite appealing, I must say that eggs were not mean to cook for ten hours.  They just weren't.  This cooking time is way too long.  Waaaaaay.  To give you an idea, I put it in at nine, and happened back down at midnight, and it was done and starting to darken to burnt on the edges.  God knows what seven more hours would have done to it.  Also, it is too much potatoes for those expecting an egg dish with potatoes in it....as is it makes a potato dish with eggs in it.  As other have said this needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper and perhaps some herbs.  So, to review:  1.  Lower the cooking time, because even on low you don't need more than three hours.  2.  Add some seasonings.  3.  Lower the amount of potatoes, or raise the amount of eggs.  I might make this again, however it would be on a morning when I wake up before the family and just don't feel like doing the whole eggs, bacon and pancake shebang.

Okay so I made this recipe with the slow cooker the first time and found that, like many others, this recipes doesn't need 10 hours cook time! At 2 am it was ready but I decided to follow the recipe and leave it in 7 more hours. It was absolutely burnt in the morning and tasted like bland rubber. 

So I took the advice found here in the comments to bake it in the oven rather than the crock pot. I also adjusted the ingredients a bit. I didn't use near as many hash browns. I baked it at 375 F for about 45-50 minutes and turned out very good! I will definety add some more salt and pepper and change things up a bit to taste, but the second time around I must say was a lot more rewarding!

Big Disappointment. I was excited to fix this because it is so unique. Either my crock pot is too hot, even on low or I missed something in the preparations becuase this didn't turn out. First it was overcooked to the point of being brown on the top and sides. Then it was pretty tasteless and the texture was very odd. I hate to give a bad rating but I didn't care for this at all.

I made this last night just so we could have a lazy morning today and I am glad I did. I did use the crock pot liner which will help with clean up. The only "problem" I encountered was a little grease at the top from all the cheese. I removed that with a paper towel and all was well. I will add more seasonings next time just to pump up the overall flavor. It is a good base recipe that you can tweak to make to your own likings.Green chilies would be great in it.

The idea is ok, but the result was not. It's really hard to tell if the omelet is undercooked, cooked or overcooked. Mine was overcooked. If  we could have a temperature to hook a temperature probe. It would cut the guessing game.

I was apprehensive about making this dish for the first time for a office christmas breakfast but it turned out absolutely perfect.  I used one pound of fried ground breakfast turkey instead of ham.  Used half & half instead of milk only because none in the fridge.  Just to make it simple I used frozen cubed hash brown with green peppers and onions along with one carton of egg beaters.  So simple and so yummy.  I was careful not to layer the cheeze close to the sides of the crock pot.  Only cooked for 6 hours and the sides did not burn and the middle was fully cooked.  Definitely recommend.

I wanted a camping breakfast.  Made it as stated except my frozen potatoes weren't frozen anymore- due to being in the cooler.  My omelet was done in 6 hours on low.  Luckily I read other reviews and was prepared for an early finish... I woke up at 3am cause I smelled it.  I turned the crock pot off.  3 hours later when we ate, it was still warm but seemed to be too much potato and it kinda settled at the bottom.  Either way, delicious!  I tossed all of my eggs into a large ziploc bag to "scramble" with milk and used a crock pot liner. Easy cleanup!! :)

This turned out horrible, glad I didn't make for guests and experimented on fam. &they are adventurous eaters. Made as is - it cooked faster than stated & was ready waaaay sooner. when I got home from work I had burnt sides (and I allegedly had 2+ hours more to go)! Only way we salvaged this & got everyone to eat one more time was by serving as suggested in tortilla w/ homemade salsa. I've never had such a horrible result off a recipe on this site.

This is fantastic for those busy families on the weekend or holidays.  This was fantastic for my hunters.  Whenever they came in from there hunt, they would grab a bit, warm up and off to the woods again.

I love my crockpot but this just wasn't cutting it. I had 2 lbs of sausage I wanted to use so I subbed that for the ham. And, I used red and orange pepper for the green. Other than that, everything was the same. It didn't really look bad when I took the lid off but putting it on a plate.... It was not appetizing looking at all. The taste was alright but I'd rather not do it again. I used a 5 qt oval crockpot and it filled it up.

I subbed cooked breakfast sausage for the ham, plus a bit of salt and pepper on top of each layer of hash browns, and made this overnight to take to school.   It was a big hit and was gone by the end of the day.

Pretty good, but I thought it was a bit bland. Putting the leftovers in tortillas with salsa and freezing them to make frozen breakfast burritos turned out great!!

I woud not use this recipe again.  I did not care for the taste. I used ham and I thought it turned out very soggy.  Might be better if cooked in oven, but I don't think so.

Was really disappointed in the way this turned out. I substituted sausage for the ham and cooked for slightly over 8 hours but it was too long. The bottom was burned and it tasted too mushy. My opinion is it needs at least 6-12 more eggs and maybe with a larger amount- the cook time would work out better. I did give it 3 stars because the taste was not horrible and i think it has potential to be better. I also omitted the pepper and added ground mustard and garlic powder, but i think it could use a little more seasonings too.

I made this a few weeks ago and got rave reviews. My daughter took it to school for an early morning meeting. All the teachers asked for the recipe. I'm gonna make it now so we'll have a hot breakfast in the morning and I won't have to cook then!

This was great! Like some others suggested, I substituted sausage for the ham. I also used Southwestern style/flavored hash browns for a little extra kick. This turned out great, and I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas morning since my oven was broken this year.  It was an easy recipe and overall good. Would make again for the filling in breakfast burritos, but probably would not serve it plain again.  Had lots of leftovers and everyone thought it was just alright. 4 stars for how easy it is to make and customize.

Really good.  I have NO idea how people burned this.  They must have had a huge crockpot.  This FILLED ours to the brim.  I didn't think it would all fit.  I had to pour  the eggs so slowly over it to make sure they didn't overflow.  If anything, ours was too moist, but I think that's because our ham we used was frozen and kind of old, so there was a lot of moisture in it. Instead of layering it, I mixed the potatoes, veggie, meats and cheese together in a huge bowl and them dumped them into the crock pot and poured the eggs and milk over top.  I also added 8 oz package of precut/washed mushrooms, about 4 brown and serve sausage links I happened to have laying around that I sliced up and probably an extra 1/2 cup- 1 cup of cheese (it didn't look like a lot when I put it in gotta have cheese! ). Also we used the seasoned shredded hash browns  because that's what I had on hand.  Pepper and about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the eggs topped it off. Like I said, ours was kind of watery and my husband thought the eggs weren't set.  They were fine.  We cooked it for 10 hours.  I will do this again.  Pretty darn yummy for minimal effort in the morning!

We made this for a ski weekend breakfast - it was fast and easy to put together. I used the O'Brien hashbrowns to avoid having to take extra ingredients. Next time I'll use only 1 lb of hashbrowns as we have a lot left over, it could use some zing...I'll try adding bacon and/or pepper jack cheese next time.

This was a very easy recipe to follow. I brought this in for a work potluck and everyone loved it. I am giving it three stars for that and would give it more, but it was a little bland. I even added a whole 7 oz. can of diced chiles! I didn't have any issues with it being overcooked and I cooked it on low for 10 hours like directed. Next time I am going to add a little cayenne pepper to the egg mixture, and add a second bellpepper. I used turkey ham, but might also try this with a mixture of bacon and chicken breast.

We enjoyed this recipe, made it for Easter morning.  Woke up to a nice aroma, and no fuss no muss.  Made exactly according to the directions--except 12 eggs wasn't enough to cover everything so I added 7 more so that it just barely covered.  Also added 3/4 cup more cheese  Cooked 9 hours and it was very moist, not leftover tasting at all.  Husband asked me to make this a regular; he loved the great combination of flavors.

You really can't taste the egg component, and the dish tastes mainly like hash browns.  It was a fun experiment, but not something I'd make again.

I cooked for 10 hours on low and it was way overdone.  Also, not a lot of flavor to it.  I took it to work and we decided it needed less cooking time, and maybe a can of rotel to jazz it up a bit.

I have made this twice and wish to have more color and definition between the layers.  Today had over 27 for breakfast and the Slow Cooker Western Omelet was part of my presentation.  It does not present itself well in the slow cooker.  I thought about dumping it on a serving plate.  All who eat it like the taste.  I have 1/3 left over.

This is not a good recipe. It burned on the sides, was hard, and looked and tasted unappetizing. If you want to save time in the morning, prepare the ingredients the night before and cook up a fresh omelet in the morning with the hash browns on the side. If you have the time, try one of the many tasty and freshly made breakfast casseroles on this site.

It turned out mushy.  It reminded my husband of corned beef hash with Ham instead and my 6 year old would barely touch it.  I thought it tasted ok but it was not at all the texture I thought it would be and had I left it in the crock any longer it would have burned.

The recipe needs a little sprucing up.  I would recommend chili's and some other spices to spruce it up.  I followed this recipe to the T and woke up to a burned mess in my crock pot.  I gave it a 3 because the person writing the recipe cannot control my crock pot.  

I did taste what wasn't a burned mess (in the center) and it was really bland.  I think this would be easier and tastier if it were just made in the morning in the oven.  Skip the crock pot all together.

I had put this together for an Easter brunch today and will be stopping at the market to get a fruit plate as I cannot serve this.  Best of luck to you!

The only difference I made to this recipe was using sausage instead of ham.  It was delicious! The only problem was the cooking time.  I did two recipes, using two different brands  of crockpots (they were even different shapes), and they were both done cooking in 6 1/2 hours.  I had to add extra milk to avoid burning.  It still tasted great in the breakfast burritos that we made, but the hasbrown were way overcooked.  I'll definatly make again and adjust the cooking times.

I leave out the potatoes and ham. Use a crock pot liner!! Take soft tortillas and fill with omelet, bacon, cheese, salsa, lite sour cream...it's a winner!

I changed it up to make it spicy - I used fresh, bagged hashbrowns from the produce section, 1/2 pound of spicy sausage & 1/2 pound of regular.  I changed out the green bell pepper to be jalapeno peppers and after the first layer, put salt, pepper, season salt & Tobasco and then did the next layer.  I used it as burrito stuffing with sour cream, shredded cheese and salsa to top it.  Almost the entire thing was gone and it went FAST.  It was spicy but not overwhelming and delicious!

I make an oven omelet when my family come.  The last time I made this one for a small portion of the family and they liked it.  I will be making it for 14 next Christmas.  It will be nice to wake up to it already cooked!

I made this recipe as is but without the onions.  I thought it was very tasty!  Next time I will shorten the cooking time to 8 hrs.  My slow cooker has an option for 10 hrs. on slow, which is what I used.  But I found that was still too long to cook it.  Great flavors.

EXCELLENT! So versatile this is! Crockpot cooking is easy & different. Remember unless you brown/cook 1st (hash browns,bacon) you're not going to get that crispy taste you're looking for (unless you do it in the oven-which you can!) if you brown first- slow cooking will soften crispy hash browns/bacon etc. I like hash browns so I  brown first, but I also like diced soft potatoes . if you do use the diced/sliced potatoes or broken up hash browns make sure they're well seasoned otherwise they'll be soft AND not overly flavorful & btw, Use a liner or WELL greased crock pot always.  lightly greased does not work well so use a GOOD amount butter/or spray -- nothing worse than having to scrub out a crock pot, even worse when the pot doesn't come out (& best to spend a few extra & get a crock pot that does come out of the base!) Remember-liquid & oil don't "cook out". Be careful how much liquid you add to your eggs. I use 1/2 & 1/2 mostly, because it makes eggs so creamy & I use less than called for. I also use water-it makes the eggs fluffier. I also add seasoning to the eggs (garlic,parsley,black pepper) keeping in mind to complement the seasonings used in the potatoes. Also, beware of cooking times. Crock pots cooking times vary, times definitely vary if you decrease or increase the amounts called for. This recipe as is,is only 7 hrs on low for me, so half a recipe would be 3 or so hrs-make this when you can watch if the 1st time so you have a time base for the future

This recipe needs a lot of tweaking. Also, for my crock-pot, did not need to cook for 12 hours. It didnt even need to cook for 8. This recipe is tasteless. I was very disappointed.

Edges browned nicely, center was a little soggy, taste was ok, nothing outstanding. I used crumbled bacon and breakfast sausage and those bites were great, next time I will add more meat and cheese for sure and less potatoes and give it another chance, it was really great to have a hot breakfast waiting for us when we woke up. Would also be great with a sausage gravy over it.

Made this today.  Not sure about a time saver as eggs are so quick to throw in pan.  But, anyway, the ratio of veggies and meat to eggs is very generous.  Nice flavor in every bite. (BTW, I slightly browned ham and sauteed veggies). I didn't use the hash browns. I have a very fast slow cooker (yeah, how can that be right?).  It cooked perfectly for me in about 5 hours.  Put knife in the middle came out clean.  I left it another 30 minutes til it had a light browning on edges and top.  Perfect!  And, my dh gave it two thumbs up.  We've already packed our lunches with it for tomorrow.  Next time I will try precooked breakfast sausage for a switch.  Served with lemon cake mix muffns.  Yum!

Slow cookers vary a lot, some cooking faster than others. I decided to try this for supper so reduced quantities as suggested and put it on mid morning on lowest setting. By mid afternoon it had set solid. I found it quicker and easier just to do this as I always have - part cooking ingredients beforehand then adding them with the eggs, cheese etc to non stick pan.

Hmm.  This was all right, but I'm glad I tried it at home first prior to taking it to work for a breakfast meeting.  I have a large oval slow cooker that turns to warm after the cooking time is reached, so it kept it warm and not overcooked when we woke up.  It was, however, a bit too moist and mushy.  I'm thinking that if I feel like trying this again I'll use a towel under the lid as someone suggested to reduce the moisture; that might've led to the mushiness.  It wasn't bland, as others have stated, but perhaps that is because I used spicy ground sausage, sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper on the potatoes, and put parsley, salt and pepper with the eggs as well as canned green chiles.  I didn't have fresh or frozen potatoes; all I had was canned white potatoes, so I sliced them and layered on the bottom.  I only did one layer each of every ingredient since it seemed too much otherwise; I did, however, top with the remaining cheese.  All in all, this was okay, but I think I'll bring something else to my breakfast meeting next week.  Thanks for the recipe!

With the exception of swapping sausage for ham, I made the recipe without any changes. I must have a 5 or 6 qt crock pot and the reviews are correct - the cooking time is too long. It did burn around the edges but the middle was great. Trying it again this weekend for a church breakfast and I think it will be perfect this time.

I did not have frozen hash browns, so I shredded raw potatoes and let them sit in water for about 5 minutes, drained them well and added them to the crock pot. I added just a touch extra milk as other reviewers suggested, and I used sausage instead of ham, just personal preference, and I did not add salt since the meat was already well salted. I cooked on low for 7 hours, it was perfect! Super easy, super tasty breakfast! Very versatile, easy to add different meats and veggies to suit your tastes.

My corckpot may be a little strong, but I only cooked this for 6 hours & it was more than done.  Took it to work for a potluck & the coworkers loved it!  I used 2 cups of cheese & probably could have used even more, but we love cheese at my house.

This was pretty good inside of a tortilla as a breakfast burrito.  I didn't like how brown the edges go.  If I make it again, I might use the diced potatoes rather than shredded to give it a better texture.

I made this recipes for family who was visiting from out of town. We were excited about the prospect of waking up to a cooked breakfast. The dish was easy to put together, and the hashbrowns and onions smelled great when we woke up. The breakfast did not look very appealing though, and the taste was ok. The sides were a bit burned after cooking for only 10 hours, and the texture of the egg make the dish taste a bit gritty, somewhat like fried rice. I would rather bake a casserole in the oven. I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

As I suspected when I was pouring everything in my slow cooker, WAY TOO MANY POTATOES! Next time I will ony use half of the bag. I added a little seasoning on each layer of potatoes, and used 1 lb cooked breakfast sausage instead of ham. After 6 hours on low, it was ready. Some slow cookers heat differently, so your best bet would be to check on it periodically. I loved it, and will definitely be making it again!

We have made this recipe several times for breakfast!  We always use a pound of bacon instead of sausage, though.  We have also doubled the recipe.  Turns out great every time!  This makes a great breakfast for our family to have on a busy morning!

Made whole recipe and cooked for 10 hours and it was burned all the way through.  Caution-error on the safe side and check after about 6 hours, I'd say.  Makes it not overnight friendly though.  Will try it again.

Am trying this next week.  So I will update this.  I just wanted to add a note that for our hash browns, we don't use the frozen.  We put the real potatoes quartered with the bell peppers that are asked for in a blender, fill with water run blender a few times until you have a choppy consistency you like then pour through a colinder.  The water keeps the starch from looking burnt and it makes a very colorful presentation.  Also the uniformity in pieces size helps it cook better.  I will update after we cook this and tell how it went!  ;)

Perfect for tailgating!  Ingredients can be swapped out to make any type of omelet (love it with spicy sausage, mushrooms & cheddar cheese).  But beware....6 hours cooking time is all that needed.

Pretty good but the timing and spice is so wrong.  I put it in the crockpot about midnight and I got up at 5am and it was completely done and starting to really brown on the sides.. ON LOW!  This just won't work for overnight breakfast.  It was so bland, it needs a lot more salt in my opinion.  I did save it by adding some homemade pico de gallo so it made it edible.  I won't be making this again.

I adjusted the recipe for 9 servings and added some chopped mushrooms. I cooked it for 10 and 1/2 hours and woke up to a burnt mess. I do not know what went wrong.

Used the western style hashbrowns b/c they already have the peppers in the bag.  Made a very large portion and a great way to use up that Christmas or Easter ham!

I made this for our dinner yesterday with a few modifications. I do not like onions so I did not put any in and I did not have any green peppers so none of them either. I do think the green peppers would have been good in it. I mixed some fat free sour cream with some skim evaporated milk. I like sour cream in stuff as it adds flavor and also makes it creamier. I cooked it on the medium setting for about 6-7 hours. My hubby and I both loved it. I topped mine with some salsa. He likes his food less spicy than me. He said he definitely would like to have this again. It was quite simple and fast to put together and then just forget.

I made this according to directions, and
was very bland, wasted a whole dozen
eggs. I took it to a MOPS meeting and 
only 2-3 spoonfuls taken. I won't be 
making this one again.

I've made this recipe for at least the last 4 years on Christmas morning--we love it!  Sometimes I add sausage, and sometimes I make 2 different kinds.  I don't typically like baked egg dishes, but this recipe always comes out great.  Thanks!!

Everyone loved this.  It made quite a lot but perfect for a large brunch crowd.  I substituted red peppers with frozen, diced fire roasted red peppers.  And I used Mexican and taco seasoned shredded cheese.  
It was delightful to wake up to the delicious smell of this dish.

This being my first time making an omelet in a slow cooker, I was a bit worried it wouldn't turn out ok, but was surprised at how well it turned out.  My wife doesn't like ham, so I substituted 3 lbs of bacon and, based on other posts, I skipped the potatoes.  It came out great and was a huge hit for Christmas breakfast!!  Thank you for sharing!

This was okay.  I like it better cooked in the oven or on the grill.  This would be great if you are in a hurry and cook it the night before.

I too precook the breakfast sausage drain well . We did not use ham and used the Obrien hash browns, they have bell pepper and onion already in! 
I think 12 hours is just a bit to long. 10 would be fine and yes use a crock pot liner, spay it with veg or butter spray. 
We did this on a camping trip! More time to enjoy friends and family!

This was a definite hit at our family camping trip.  It was nice to wake up to a cooked breakfast on Sunday morning.  Very little clean up since I cut up all the ingredients before we left and just dumped in the crock pot the night before.  I accidently grabbed a bag of Southwestern hash browns.  It was a pleasant surprise and added some zip to the recipe.  Everyone wants me to make it for the next camping trip.  We thought a layer of sausage gravy in the middle might be a good addition.  I hope it turns out.

I make a strata every week in the oven so we can slice it and take to work for breakfast.  I change up the ingredients according to what is in season.  I hate heating up the oven when it is hot as it makes the whole house uncomfortable.  This worked great using a slightly modified version.  I sauteed the vegetables first since I use a lot of them and used 6 whole eggs and about 8-10 egg whites beaten together with no milk.

I fixed this for my wife's departmental breakfast.  I used turkey keilbasa to accomodate those who don't eat pork.  I didn't get to taste it myself, but the reviews were excellent and the slow cooker came home empty.

Hit at a brunch for women! Did as the recipe directs but added some cumin and oregano, omitted the salt, thought the ham would add enough salt for most people.

I made this with a few changes.  First, I used a 1 pound 12 ounce bag of potatoes o'brien thus I omitted the onion and bell pepper the recipe called for.  I also used 1 pound regular ground sausage and 1 pound hot ground sausage in place of the ham.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly except the cook time.  As others noted, 10 hours is WAY too long.  Mine was done in 5 hours.  It is delicious by itself or inside a tortilla with a little extra cheese on top! :-)

AWESOME!   Used 1 cup heavy cream instead of milk Used additional 1/2 cup milk and 5 more eggs that was poured over the top. Didn't use all the hashbrowns.  Used 1/2 the bag. Used ham and 1 pound pork sausage.

Definately an easy recipe but I would look to add more veggies next time for taste and texture. Luckily, I put it in later as at the 8 hour mark it was way past done.

I made this overnight for an office brunch celebrating Administrative Professionals Day today.  Since I am not a cook, I listened to my mother and sister tell me that the cooking time seemed a bit much for it to include eggs!  I was afraid not to follow the recipe to the letter and followed the directions exactly and cooked it for 11.5 hours.  It actually came out pretty good!  It was eaten and it made a lot more than needed as some people do not eat eggs and others, no meat.  I did not use ham but cut up sliced smoked mesquite turkey instead.  I had to guess at the salt and pepper, but all told it was ok. I will make this again and cut back on the cook time and add some additional seasonings like others suggested which I read today AFTER I had made this the first time out!

Potatoes are short on flavor and they just can't beat crispy home fries. The recipe is good though and nice and easy. It's good to wake up to breakfast in the morning without having to cook. I did this recipe once with ham and the next time I used diced sausage patties. The patties definately had more flavor. I am sure I will be making this again in the future.

This recipe is a keeper. Due to the bad reviews it got, I gave it a little tweeking. Spiced it up a little more with some tabasco, onion powder, red pepper flakes, garlic. I added some sliced mushrooms and a little sliced japaleno since all the fam likes them. Be sure to keep an eye on it. Mine was a little overdone at 6.5 hours!

We liked this one.  I used red pepper, sandwich meat ham and Mexican 4 cheese.  It was very good and will use it at our next school meeting in the morning.
