This was very quick and easy, but I had trouble getting the family to eat it. I thought it was okay, but the rest of the family thought it was too bland and needed more spices. Also, without the extra spices, the pumpkin tended to be bitter.

I used pizza dough made with spelt and barley flours instead of the puff pastry, but kept the filling as the recipe called for.  More spiciness would make this a tastier product!  I'll probably use chipotle pepper seasoning next time!
