This was the best almond macaroon recipe I found!  I made them as part of my French display on Bordeaux at Foreign Language Day, and by the end, there was only one left.  It was hard keeping my family away from them- they loved the almond taste.  I left out the chocolate (because it didn't seem very French), which was fine.  Make sure you use wax paper or similar or else the bottoms get a bit too dark.  This was a wonderful recipe, I highly recommend it.  Bon app!

WOW, I AM SO GLAD I TRIED THIS RECIPE EVEN THOUGH THE RATING WAS  A FOUR. IT WAS A HUUUGE HIT WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY! I DID NOT HAVE WHOLE ALMONDS, SO ESTIMATED AND USED 1 3/4 CUPS OF GROUND ALMONDS INSTEAD. STILL MIXED THE WHOLE THING IN A FOOD PROCESSOR. USED CHOCOLATE CHIPS INSTEAD OF CHOPPED CHOCOLATE. THE BATTER CAME OUT REALLY PASTY AND STICKY, WHICH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO MY DAD'S ALMOND COOKIE RECIPE. SO I WORKED WITH IT AS IS. USED A MINI ICE CREAM SCOOP AND PLACED ON A PARCHMINT PAPER LINED COOKIE SHEET. DID NOT PRESS THEM DOWN, THEY FLATTENED PERFECTLY IN THE OVEN. THESE WERE SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!! ONE OF THE FEW RECIPES THAT I WILL HAVE TO REPEAT MANY TIMES!

I was on a wheat-free diet for a while and really missed cookies--wish I'd had these gems!  They are scrumptious and, with a food processor, a snap to make.  Gave a batch as a gift to a friend who's off wheat and she just adored them.

My cookies turned out very flat.  They have a chewy texture but the chocolate was a little over-powering.  I think I was looking for more of the almond flavor than the chocolate.  I will try this recipe without choco-chips next time.

These aren't really macaroons per se. That's not to say they're not delicious! I bought a large chunk of dark chocolate and shaved that so that it melted more in the oven. I didn't have any paper to put on the pan so I just greased it heavily and made the cookies very small. Then, I put chocolate frosting between them (which melted when they were warm--it was amazing). Very good and quick recipe!

I cut the recipe in half, and used 1 egg. I also had ground almonds on hand, so I wasn't sure how many cups ground would be 1 cup of whole almonds. After doing a little research online, I ended up using 1-1/4 cups ground almonds (for the half recipe that I was making). Not sure if this is correct, but they did turn out pretty good. These are kind of a chewy, sticky cookie - but they are very tasty! Not sure I'd call them a macaroon (because they really don't have that "puff" factor), but they are chewy like a macaroon. Overall, I'm glad that I found this recipe to use of the ground almonds that I had on hand. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
