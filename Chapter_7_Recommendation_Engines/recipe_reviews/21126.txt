This was a good recipe, I found it too bland for my taste, so I added at the 2hour cooking point about 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of Oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme. Also after the first 2 hours of cooking it covered, I let it cook uncovered to reduce it, making it thicker and more flavorful. I will make again with the additions.

This was my very first time making tomato sauce from scratch. We have a bumper crop of Roma tomatoes this year, more than we know what to do with so I decided to try out this recipe and hopefully freeze off the extra sauce for the winter months.

It was fantastic! Only I can see why some folks might be having problems with this recipe, the recipe says "10 Tomatoes' but does not specify how large the tomatoes should be. For all practical purposes, it should say "10 large Tomatoes" because the size and the amount of the other ingredients DOES make a difference! Having said that, I quadrupled this recipe (using the portion converter) since I had 40 very medium Roma tomatoes, cut down on the amount of peppers and carrots, I used chopped baby carrots too since that made it much easier to cut into small pieces. I also threw in 2 dried red chillies (you can get them from the Indian grocery) along with the bay leaves and celery stalks while the whole thing simmered, in order to give it a bit of a kick. I also replaced the Italian spices with fresh thyme and oregano like other posters had recommended. It was superb!
It freezes well too and can easily be warmed up and be added with either cooked ground veal or pieces of Italian sausage for a non-vegetarian sauce for later on.

This is a great basic recipe!  Easy to follow and easy to do as this was my first attempt to make homemade tomato sauce.  I did make changes.  I carmalized the onions and omitted the carrots and burgundy.  Also, after the sauce had been cooking for two hours, I poured it into the blender to puree it;  my kids hate vegetable chunks in their sauce, so I did this to disguise the other veggies! Sneaky, huh.  Also, I added salt and used oregano, thyme, and parsley instead of a general Italian seasoning.  Overall, this was a great recipe starter for a tasty sauce!

Very good recipe. Always looking for good tomatoe sauce recipes and found one in this one. Everyone enjoyed the spagetti and meatballs. One thing I recommend is to score the bottom of the tomatoes with an X as this makes it easier to peel.

It takes a lot of time but the result is well worth the wait. I made big batches and froze it for future use.

A great way to take advantage of the summer harvest! I've made 3 batches of this already and I've got another month of tomaote season left. I made this in the slow cooker and it was wonderful. Instead of Italian Seasoning I used fresh sage, oregano, thyme and rosemary...I just cut large branches of each herb and placed it on top of the crushed tomatoes. Before packaging I removed all the stems. This is definately a keeper!

I used Roma tomatoes so it was nice and thick without having to leave it uncovered the last 2 hours of cooking. However I did add 3/4tsp fresh thyme, 3/4tsp fresh oregano, 1tsp Lawry's seasoned salt and 1/2tsp fresh ground pepper. I pureed everything as other readers did. I used this sauce to make lasagna and with what was left I served as a side dish with Italian sausage.  This is a good sauce to make if you are serving to people who do not like spicy, hot. For just my husband and I, I would also include a tsp of red pepper flakes. Thanks for a good basic recipe using fresh tomatoes!

This was very tasty except....don't forget to add salt (I used about 1 1/2 tsp.) and some sugar if it's too tangy (I used about 1 tsp)I also used the tomato paste to thicken it up a bit.

After going to a local event called the Tomato Festival, I was able to get 20 tomatoes for only $4.00.  I always wanted to make tomato sauce from scratch.   I doubled the recipe.  I fried pepperoni in the beginning and used the grease to cook the onion and pepper.  I managed to get away with not using any tomato paste after simmering it for over 8 hours to reduce it.  I added a 1/2 cup of Romono cheese, and cooked the sauce with whole carrots and later removed them.  I pureed the sauce then added 3 drops of red food coloring to bring back the bright red color. Excellent recipe with a great taste!

Absolutely delicious !!!!!!     I used one red bell pepper instead of the green, only one carrot and no sugar at all.  I substitute the wine for ½ cup of beef broth.  As mentioned by other readers, I added more salt and double the seasonings and also added dried oregano, 1 dried red chille pepper and ½ teaspoon red pepper flacks.   Two fantastic hints that helped me a lot:  1) Make an x at the bottom of the tomatoes before put them in the  boiling water. It peeled so easily!  2) Blend everything after the first 2 hours.  I included the celery to be added to the puree.   My hint – Discard the bay leave and red dried chilli before you put it on the blender.  I almost forgot!  No more grocery tomato sauce for me. This is too good!

I didn't measure or count out my tomatoes, garlic, or onions as I had so much to use up from my garden.  I also skipped direction one and just chopped the tomatoes (skin, seeds and all) put into a large pot and simmered everything for about 3 hours, then I put the tomatoe paste in and simmered some more.  It reduced down about 1/4.  I allowed it to cool for about 1/2 hour and then I put the sauce in the blender and pureed it. (you couldn't see the seeds and the skin stewed away and got pureed) It came out nice and thick.  I did season it to taste. THX.

This is a truly great sauce that leaves much room for improvisation. I, of course, used it as a blueprint and ended up using 6 cloves of garlic, 1 whole onion, 1 red bell pepper, 10 roma tomatoes, olive oil, butter, red wine, a rib of celery, fat-free creamer, fresh basil, dried oregano, dried rosemary, dried sage, dried thyme, salt, pepper, a small can of tomato paste (made it dark red like in the picture!) and, at the end, a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms. I simmered for 3.5 hours and served over polenta and with roast chicken. DIVINE SAUCE! lots of room to play with ingredients and flavors, but a great base for anyone who needs a good tomato sauce starting point.

This recipe is great. I tried it w while ago, when trying to figure out ways to keep our grocery bill down. Since it dis not specify what type of tomatoes to use I have tried them all. I get the best results with Romas and my husband loves it. I cut the celery into small pieces with the onions, garlic and carrots, and don't use green peppers (we don't like them). I make huge batches of this and keep lots in the freezer. Add to cooked gr. beef or with meatballs and this is amazing.   I had my family over for supper the other day and my mom asked where I bought the sauce in the lasanga. I was super proud to be able to tell them that I had made it from scratch:) Thank you MOLSON7 :)

wow! This is a great "base" sauce to spice up to your own likings. Once I tweaked this, it was amazing!!  my changes are-   -Omit butter, completely unnecessary  -Omit carrots and celery all together -use all fresh herbs, thyme, oregano, parsley as opposed to italian seasoning. This is a fresh recipe, so go with the theme! -double the wine -add 3 tbsps of romano cheese -add 1/4 tspn red pepper flakes

This is a wonderful recipe. To make the removing of the tomato skins easier I cored them first and with a sharp knife I carved a small X on the bottom of the tomato. This makes the skin come off much easier.

I used this recipe to make my first batch of tomato sauce ever.  It was a good base, but some of the comments were helpful for making adjustments.  I suggest increasing the proportion of spices, omitting the fake, canned tomato paste, and simmering to thicken.  I am really pleased with how it turned out!

I just made my second batch of sauce using my crop of tomatoes.  A 30 minute prep time is a little ambitious unless you are a super fast chopper!  I chopped the onions, pepper, carrots and garlic first...had them "sweating" while I skinned the tomatoes.   It took me about 60 minutes to get to the point where I could blend the tomatoes and combine all ingredients.
With regard to salt:  I didn't miss it at all with my first batch but I do with my second.  I suspect the flavor of your tomatoes as they change over the season is the driver.    I recommend “season to taste” but only just before serving.   You never know how the flavors will mature.   
Also, I used sweet red pepper instead of green--my personal preference.   
I love the recipe and expect to get another batch into my freezer before the end of the season.

This sauce was great, but as others have noted, needed a few modifications.  I left the seeds in because I wanted to retain as much of the tomato pulp and flavor as possible.  At the two hour cooking point I added 1tsp of salt, 1/2tsp black pepper, a bunch of fresh thyme and rosemary, and some tomato bouillon powder to cut through the tartness.  I also dropped in a whole dried chili pepper that I took out with the bay leaf when it was all done. The pepper really enhanced the flavor without adding too much heat.  I did leave the pot uncovered at the two hour point which really helped to thicken up the sauce and left it nice and chunky, just the way I like it!  Just make sure to stir frequently so nothing sticks to the bottom.  The celery stalks fell apart toward the end of cooking so I'll chop them up next time because it still tasted great, and probably double the wine because I couldn't detect it at all (I just used some shiraz that I had at home, didn't want to buy burgundy just to use a little of it).  With about 15-20 minutes left I added some leftover grilled squash and banana peppers just to warm them up, and served over angle hair pasta.  A few sprinkles of parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast made it an amazing meal!  As a bonus, it was even better the next day!

I followed the recipe for the most part. I did add a red bell pepper and some chili flakes, for a little heat. Since I did not want to be tied to the stove, I put everything in my slow-cooker, set it on high for 8 hours and then blitzed everything in a food processor. And to make clean-up easier I used one of those slow-cooker liners. (Love those!) Yummy, yummy sauce! Will definitely make again!  YUM!

This is my staple sauce after two tomato seasons!  I saute the carrots longer than usual so they break down more.  I love all the veggies in this sauce.  I freeze this for excellent sauce all winter long.

This is pretty good.  It has that "raw" taste that fresh spaghetti sauce has, so you could probably simmer as long as you wanted to get a different flavor.  It also wasn't quite as thick as I wanted (I like a THICK sauce) so I added more tomato paste.  You could also easily jack up the seasonings in this to get more italian flavor.  But those are minor criticisms, really, as this sauce is robust and filling.  It's also nice and chunky, which is easily adjusted if you prefer a smoother sauce.  It was a nice sauce over cheese tortellini.  I had a bunch of fresh tomatoes so I quadrupled the recipe and froze a good portion of it; this will be wonderful for later pasta dishes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with much of what was said and recommend adding the sugar, extra salt, extra tomato paste (I doubled it), garlic powder and a small amount of shredded parm. It did take around 45 minutes for the prep, but it was fun and the result is amazing.  Oh - and DO NOT wear a white tee shirt while preparing :-)

I found this recipe works best with roma tomatoes.  They're meatier and have less seedy parts. 12 roma tomatoes made just enough to serve 5.  I added Italian sausage, chopped mushrooms, chopped artichoke hearts, and seasongings galore (oregano, parsley, sage, basil, bay leaves, tried to keep it simple).  Don't be shy with the salt, it brings out the flavors!  The great thing about tomato sauce is you can add almost anything you want and it will be great.  This recipe is a base, experiment with it and have fun. Oh, and scoring the tomatoes with an X helped a LOT with the peeling!

great basic recipe. there def. needs to be clarificatino on the size/lbs of tomatoes. I used 20 med tomatoes, 1 pepper, 1 onion and 1 carrot, only because that's what i had on hand. I used salt, sugar and a pinch of cinnamon. It made 12 cups of sauce.

Not bad! The only thing that bothers me though is what exactly is 10 tomatoes??  10 Romas definitely constitute a different amount of total tomato than, say, 10 Beefsteaks.  Total poundage would be better IMHO.  But alas…I used 12 Romas and it worked out.  I did not puree any, but rather just coarsely chopped all tomatoes because I like a chunky sauce.  I also added mushrooms since I had them and fresh rosemary, thyme, oregano and sage instead of dried Italian seasoning.  I also chunked the carrots and removed them with the celery later.  In the end, the sauce is good, but far more work than it is worth for one 28 oz jar of sauce.  It took much more than just 30 minutes to do all the prep work, and I am pretty good at overlapping tasks.  So I don’t know if I will do it again…maybe in a slow cooker.

I was looking at a gorgeous box of tomatoes our friends brought from their garden thinking "what in the world an I going to do with all of these?".  This recipe was the perfect solution!  I added a little more carott, and some sugar to cut the acidity.  Just a little red pepper flake and extra salt/pepper.  A terrific recipe, thanks so much!  I can't wait to have our friends for dinner and feed them their tomatoes!  They will be thrilled, and so am I.

Wonder rich sauce which I make in the summer and freeze to have in the winter. I puree some portions and make a chunkier sauce for other portions. Everyone who has tried this sauce has loved it. I do add oregano, thyme, and salt and pepper after the first two hours.

Great recipe.  Easy to follow for a 1st timer like myself. I used 8 lb of tomatos. Left the butter out and also omitted the wine and tomato paste. I left the carrots and celery whole and simmered them until the end-then discarded them with the bay leaves(2). I added 1 tsp each of salt, thyme and oregano. The most important step is removing the seeds.  I have already made this a 2nd time and plan to make again with the wine.

We had a great tomato crop this year & made sauce from scratch for the first time. This recipe was great. We used the crockpot to simmer for 4 hours. Cooked on the stove for 30min then transferred to the crockpot. Used 20 small to medium tomatoes. I also pureed all of the veggies for a smooth sauce. Used an open bottle of merlot for the wine, 1/8 cup dried basil instead of fresh.  and as someone else suggested at the 2 hour mark added 1 tspn salt, 1/2 tspn pepper, oregano and thyme. We will be making this again. Thank you.

This was great! Very FRESH and healthy tasting. It definitely tasted "homemade." I put everything in the blender and pureed all of it before adding to the pot. It was somehow still slightly chunky at the end, but in a good way. I used 20 small size tomatoes of different kinds from the garden. It was a bit sweet for my taste, so at the 2 hour point I added about 1 1/2 tsp of salt, about 1/2 tsp of pepper, and a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity. I also added some dried oregano and tyme, and a bit of garlic powder to jazz it up a bit, but thats just my personal taste. It does REALLY need the salt though! It was still a bit sweet, but really good. Its even better the next day, so make it a day ahead if you can.

I found this recipe helpful as a starting guide only.  I was shocked that the recipe does not call for any salt or pepper.  I took 10 tomatos to mean 10 medium size tomatos and the recipe ratio was fine.  I omitted the carrots and celery and doubled the onions, garlic, and green pepper.  I added heaping handfuls of fresh basil, thyme, and oregano, and added salt and pepper to taste.  It was a raving hit with everyone.

Great recipe!  I only cooked mine for 3 hours.  I left out the carrots and celery for fear it would turn into a V8 sauce.  I also added a 6 oz can of tomato puree.

Very good. I made the following changes:
only added 1 tbsp tomato paste--
used merlot--
added 8 or so stems of thyme--
used 20 roma tomatoes--
cooked for 4 hours--
added 1 tsp seasoned salt--
after cutting up the tomatoes, I pureed them using a hand blender with the carrots, onions & bellpeppers--
after cooking and removing bay leaves (3), thyme stems and celery, I then used the hand blender again to make the sauce completely smooth--
My sauce was lighter in color than most of the pics here. Looks more like vodka sauce. Next time I may skip the carrots and bellpeppers.

Had some of my Grandmother's tomatoes to use and am so glad this was what I chose to make!  Sauce turned out GREAT ... a little chunky, which is perfect for us.  I'm planning to add some red pepper flakes and make an arrabiata style sauce.

I made this sauce today with the fresh tomatos from the garden.  I added parmesan and romano cheese after the tomato paste was added.  It thickend up quickly after that.  My husband is not a big fan of chunky sauce so I put the sauce in the blender and blended it until smooth.  It came out awesome!

This sauce came out fantastic!  I made some changes--didn't have any celery, bay leaf, or burgundy wine.  I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the sauce, as well as a spoonful of sugar.  The carrots and peppers added not only color, but a great flavor.  The result was well worth the time it took to peel, seed, and chop the tomatoes.  I have enough tomatoes left to make another two pots of this sauce, and am looking forward to it!  I have several containers of sauce in my freezer now, and am looking forward to adding to that, as well as sharing with family.  Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making sauce from scratch.  My father sent me a bunch of tomatoes from his garden.  I followed recipe almost exactly, substituted beef broth for wine, ommitted carrots and added mushrooms.  I am so happy, it turned out terrific, even my husband (who loved his Italian mother's homemade sauce) said it was very good.

I have never made home made tomato sauce before, and it was fun to try something new. My sauce turned out very nice with great flavor. I took the advise of other reviews and blended all the vegies together for a more flavorful sauce. The only thing I would do differently next time is not to blend the carrots, because it took away from the color of the red sauce, and I had to compensate by adding extra tomato paste to bring the color back. I used the sauce in a chicken parmesian and the whole family loved it..it had to be the sauce!

Excellent recipe!  It tastes like something you would have in an upscale Italian restaurant.  I used tomatoes, bell peppers, carrots, and basil from our garden, and it was out of this world!

I didn't simmer it for 4 hours, though.  I can't see how you can do that and have anything left!  I cooked it for 2 hours, one hour covered and the other hour uncovered.  I also used only 3 garlic cloves and 1 stalk celery, and it still came out great.  I may use the recommended amounts next time, though.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.

This was so good!  I did use 2 small cans of tomato paste and 2 small cans of tomato sauce and a pinch of cinnamon.  My sister and husband said it was the best they ever had. It was definitely worth the work and I'll make it again.

Fantastic recipe!!  I used home grown San Marzano tomatoes and I roasted the pepper for added flavor depth. Simple (albeit a bit time consuming) recipe. I highly recommend giving it a try!!

It only takes 10 seconds or so for tomatoes plunged in boiling water to remove the skins. Don't boil for one min. The ice water bath is recommended. I have been skinning tomatoes for years and 1 min. is way to long unless you want to cook them.

I'm rather new in developing my cooking skills.  

This is my first time making a tomato sauce.  At first, I was concerned that there was too much garlic and basil but however have learned that fresh basil is milder in taste and the garlic cooks down well to make a very good balance.

I do think one should pay attention to the size of carrots selected.

I was pleased with the results and would recomend this recipe, as is, to anyone.

hmmmmm... this was not what i expected AT ALL..
i followed the recipe to a T.. except i substituted merlot.
my hubby was not pleased w/this.
he said it was too sweet & cinammon-y.
he had to take over by adding practically every spice in the house, thinning it out w/ watter ( even though i insisted he used chicken stock) & smashing it w/ a bean/ potato masher.
this was too thick, chuncky for pasta. 
it was like stewed tomatos texture.
i will never make this again!

turned out really good but i tripled the recipe and added lots of salt, garlic salt, extra Italian seasoning, a couple shakes of red pepper flakes and extra garlic.  just be sure you DE-STRING THE CELERY!!! I didn't and keep finding celery strings in my sauce even after I took out all the celery and the bay leaves.

The sauce tasted like carrots.  I was pretty much like pouring V8 over spaghetti noodles.  I followed the recipe to a T and it didnt turn out right.  I had to cut it with store bought tomato sauce to make it better.

Made this with homegrown tomatoes (heirloom and big boy). It was bland, albeit a great tomato flavor. Added a couple cans of tomato paste as the tomatoes were really watery. Also added some salt and pepper.

Made this twice now and think it's a pretty good recipe and a nice way to use up our garden's tomatoes!  Very time intensive, but sauce is.  I added a jalapeño pepper and some red pepper flakes the second time around.

The recipe is great.  It does require you to taste and adjust.  Mainly because of the size and ripeness of the tomatoes.  I had 8 plum and i followed the recipe exactly but pureed everything after 2 hours then added some honey and white sugar to sweeten it up then a bit of salt to bring out all the flavors.  I also added additional paste for more color.  A fine recipe.  Thanks for posting.

My first time making homemade tomato sauce and I had fun doing it. The recipe didn't say what kind of tomatoes to use so I picked my favorite ones - roma tomatoes.  I used 9 ripe roma tomatoes. I had fresh basil, chopped. In placed of Italian Seasoning I used a small amount of fresh sage, oregano, thyme and a tiny sprig of rosemary- all finely diced. I added the rest of the ingredients called for in the recipe and simmered, covered, for 2 hours. Towards the 2 hour mark I tasted it and thought it needed just a pinch of sugar to cut down on the amount of acidity and a little salt, to taste. I continued to simmer for a while more, uncovered until it thickened a little. Tasty, flavorful after simmering for a while. Next time I make this I will make it a point to cut down the veggies into really small pieces or better yet, grate it into the sauce.

This came out well, nice texture and fresh taste.  Needed seasoning though, kind of bland and a little bit tart.

This is the best pasta sauce I have ever eaten. I used to buy canned sauce and add meat to it, however, after eating this I will continue making sauce from scratch. With all the filling vegetables there is no need for meat, poultry, fish etc.

I made this for dinner two nights ago. My family all thought it needed  'something' after it was done simmering. The solution was about a scant 1/8 of a cup of sugar to cut the acidy level. I used 20 Roma tomatoes, so no need for the addition of the tomato paste. Will use this recipe for canning the bumper crop of Romas!

This is a nice sauce.  I doubled it and added mushrooms as well as more olive oil.  It does need the tomato paste and for a doubled recipes I used a regular size can of paste.  It's very hearty and has a nice flavor!  The picture makes it look far less chunky than it actually is.  If you want a smooth sauce, you should def. puree or food process your veggies!

I found the recipe to be a little unspecific....10 Tomatoes? I ended up using 14 good size Romas and still had to had a big can of tomatoe sauce, I would've liked to see a weight for the amount of tomatoes instead of a number. That being said, I followed the recipe, only adding in some extra squash from my garden and It was Great! I will be making this again. My family and my grandparents really enjoyed it.

This tomato sauce was generally a good recipe but I do have to agree with the other reviewers who said it was bland. I added more herbs as well as more wine and tomato paste. It was good but I will also try other tomato sauce recipes before making this one again.

This was a good tomato sauce. I would recommend however, if you don't have any fresh basil on hand, greatly increase the dried seasonings. I found it needed more to get flavor. I also added salt and pepper to the sauce to get it flavorful. I also want to emphasize how important it is to squeeze out the seeds becuase we did not and had a very watery sauce until it cooked for several additional hours.

This is a great sauce to use up all those extra tomatos from your garden!  I added a wee bit of sugar to help with the acidity level.  I have made it several times this summer.  Big hit

I am just about done cooking this sauce from a bunch of free tomatoes we just received. I can say even now, before the sauce is completed, that it's AWESOME. I too don't like chunky vege's in my sauce, so I pureed them all. (I added roasted peppers also that I pureed).I had to add more seasoning 1/2 way through because it was a tad bland and I had to add sugar because it was too tart. For us, it looks and tastes like homemade sauce. I tripled the recipe to fit the amount of tomatoes I have and I will freeze.

This recipe turned out to be a great use for my garden tomatoes. I followed the recipe, but I did puree the sauce after the 2 hour simmer time (as suggested in a previous review - thanks.) I froze the leftovers and it still tastes great after thawing. It was just what I was looking for!

This was my first attempt at making tomato sauce, but it seemed like a good use for our overabundance of regular tomatoes this year after we'd shared several pails. Since we didn't have Roma tomatoes, I gave each tomato an extra squeeze to remove extra juice before tossing them in the food processor. The sauce was tasty, but tasted a little too much like plain tomatoes and I was looking for more of a spaghetti sauce. I added several diced mushrooms, 2 teaspoons of sea salt, a tablespoon of sugar, and several shakes of oregano. It was delicious, and I froze several bags from the tripled recipe to enjoy this winter.

This is a great recipe. I thought that it needed just a little bit more flavor, however. I added 1 T. of sugar, 1 t. of salt, 1 t. oregano, and 1 t. of fennel seed. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I do have a large crop of tomatoes and I make a Pomarola, which is same as the recipe, 
I scald the tomatoes, peel, cut up in chunks and put them in a large container with the juice then I remove the chunky tomatoes with a slotted spoon, drain the liquid in a colander ( Save the juice )and remove the seeds. Do this two or three times.
chop the celery, green peppers, carrots and onions, since I make about 16 quarfs at the time I saute the veggies in batches, while I saute the veggies the tomatoes are on the fire to a boil and I add the sauted veggies as they cook.

Bring to a boil and cook for about one- two hours, then I take an immersion blender and puree the whole batch 
Add spices such as basel Italian seasoning salt pepper sugar red wine and pepper flakes and I also add a couple of 15 OZ Pastorelli pizza sauce.  The pizza sauce will add same zest and brighten up the sauce.
I freeze it in Freezer bags  2, 1/2 cups is enough for one pound of pasta.
When ready to use I cook some Italian sausage and 93% lean ground beef for sauce with meat.

I made this sauce today and it is absolutely fabulous. I had about 20 tomatoes of various types (pureed all), used 7 cloves of Garlic about 6 baby carrots and the whole can of tomato paste. The other amounts stayed the same. I also added salt to taste! Since its summer time and i rather go golfing then stand in front of a  stove, I put everything in my crockpot on high for 4 hrs and then switched to low for another 4hrs. I will make this alot and freeze it. It tastes like summer. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I quadrupled this recipe using home-canned tomato puree.  I left out the celery and used dried basil, oregano, thyme, marjoram, and crushed rosemary instead of the Italian seasoning.  I simmered, covered, for 2 hours and then removed the lid and simmered another hour and it was extremely thick.  I added a little sugar to cut the tartness toward the end.  Delicious! This will be my go-to sauce from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great flavor!  But its going to look "chunkier" than the picture.  Next time, I will puree the sauce at the two hour mark for a smoother appearance.

This was tasty, and I accidentally chopped up and put in the celery instead of the whole stalks -- still good. I used my bounty of fresh tomatoes from my tomato plants, froze in batches and look forward to this fresh tasting tomato sauce with pasta this winter! Also added salt to taste at the first 2-hour mark. Very necessary.

My 19 year old son made this with garden fresh basil,onions, and some tomato but supplemented with paste and 1 can chopped tomato as we did not have enough fresh,instead of burgundy added a cabernet shiraz blend.  Did not add bell pepper but minced onion tops. Did not simmer 2 hours only 10 minutes.Sauce was so excellent I had to leave this review. No salt was necessary.

very rich and tasty.  I agree with others that the size of your tomato matters.  Also it is pretty chunky next time I will puree all tomatoes.  I added salt and pepper and finely chopped my carrots  I omitted the celery since I didn't have any on hand

I particularly liked the omission of salt.  Cooking for someone on a no or low salt diet is difficult, and having this fine recipe as a base for so many good things is wonderful.

The only part of this recipe I really followed was boiling and peeling the tomatoes.  I wanted a recipe that didn't use canned tomatoes but fresh instead!  So easy and great.  I added my own spices (crushed red pepper, black pepper, sugar, basil, salt, oregano, etc).  I also made it into a vodka sauce.  Great easy recipe!!

This recipe is good.  Next time I make it I will use a red pepper/capsicum as I prefer the taste to the green and I will dice the vegetables much smaller...maybe even grate them.  I added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of sugar at the end of the cooking time.

This recipe is perfect for those who want their sauce completely from scratch (tomatos and all).  I followed others advice and allowed it to cook the last two hours uncovered.  My sauce was perfectly thick.  I highly reccommend you add fennel to the recipe, as it adds a whole new, tastey dimension to the sauce.  Also, I added additional seasonings at the first two hour mark.  This sauce is great alone or makes a great sauce for chix/eggplant parm and other Italian dishes requiring red sauce.  Oh, one other thing: I pureed the whole sauce together before cooking because I don't like chunky.

Nice recipe but the fun is adding the extras at the end like pesto, parmesan, fresh chopped basil etc! Beef! Turkey! Sausages. Its always good to refer to a base recipe like this. My husband ate it all week and thinks I took cooking lessons! I'll take it! :) Thanks!

I used the basic recipe used 16 various types of tomatoes, 8 big cloves of garlic fresh herbs plus two fresh Jalapenos,BAM! our family loves a little blast to there sauce!  What a Great way to use up the tomatoes when there coming to fast for salads and such...  As for the time it takes the rewards of not buying premade sauce is Well worth it! Enjoy

I was looking for an easy first time homemade sauce recipe as well and this was pretty good.  It was easy to follow and turned out very tasty.  I just made this yesterday and added some salt, a bit more garlic and about 10 dashes of hot sauce to give it a kick as well.  I added the salt at the 2 hour mark. The next time I make it I will puree it to hide some of the veggies to trick my kids who are used to smooth jar sauce.

This recipe rules. This is my only go to pasta sauce recipe now. Like others I try adding other herbs to taste. Rosemary, thyme, pepper, etc. I use Roma tomatoes because I like a thicker sauce. I also double the recipe because after boiling it and reducing it it often yields very little compared to the amount of time it takes. Overall, a very good recipe!

I'm sorry to say this - but I followed the directions to the letter.  It was too watery (after de-seeding etc) and was very tasteless.  I followed all directions, used fresh basil etc.  I was so upset to spend so much time on this and I ended up mixing it with jarred it was so bland and m'eh.  :(

I followed the basic recipe but added salt and sugar to taste. I also added a dash of baking soda to cut acidity.
I used a red bell pepper, which I roasted on my stove burner, peeled off the skin and then chopped and added to the tomato mixture. I caramelized the onion while sauteing the carrots. When everything cooked down, I tossed out the bay leaf and celery (but not the celery leaves). 
I pureed everything once again, using my immersion blender. I was very happy with the intensified flavors. I am going to use it over spaghetti squash!

I had so many tomatoes in my garden I had to find something to do with them. This recipe is simple and delicious! My family said it was the best I ever made! I added a little crushed red pepper for some zing and ground beef too!

I have never made tomato sauce from scratch. I doubled the ingredients as my tomatoes were quite small. I made it per the recipe, but then added a 6 oz can of tomato paste, a little sea salt, sauteed ground beef and used an immersion blender to blend it all together. Definitely a keeper! :D

This turned out pretty good and for the most part was pretty easy! I did make some changes to my version however. We didn't have any wine so instead I used beef broth. I also added a couple of pinches of crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little bit more flavor. It didn't make it spicy at all just gave it a  little more flavor. Over all I'm very happy with the way it turned out and will probably make it again.

I omitted the wine, celery, carrots, and bell pepper. I wanted a plain tomato sauce, and this recipe served as a good base. I added much more garlic & used my homegrown heirloom tomatoes. The process was fairly easy and the recipe easy to follow. I also omitted the butter and used only EVOO. I did not add chunks, as I like my sauce thin. I let this cook covered for two hours, adding in thyme, italian seasoning, bay leaves, oregano, extra salt & pepper. Then I added 1 small can of tomato sauce and let cook for another hour uncovered. Added another can tomatoe sauce, some more pepper & fresh oregano then let cook on low for another hour and a half. This came out great. I made a triple batch and was able to freeze quite a bit. The whole family was impressed, even both of my kids. I have definitely added this recipe to my book & it will remain there! Thanks so much for sharing.

Great recipe for my first homemade sauce. I made two small changes.  First, I omitted the italian seasoning and replaced it with 1/2 tsp dried oregano, dried thyme and dried parsley. Second, at the two hour mark I pureed it for smoothness and thickness carefully removing and replacing the bay leaf and celery stalks.. The sauce is thick and succulent.

YUM!!  I left the peppers and onions as larger chunks instead of sending them through the food processor.  The consistency and flavor are great!  We used home-grown tomatoes and it tastes so fresh :).  I will definitely make this again and again!

This was really good but I prefer a little sweeter sauce than this recipe produced.  I added about 1/8 cup of sugar during the last 2 hours of cooking.

This "from scratch" tomato sauce recipe is awesome!  My husband raved about it. I followed it exactly, adding my grandmother's meatball recipe to the sauce and let it simmer for four hours.
This will become part of my final recipe collection to be made again and again. Can't wait for next summer's tomato crop!

This is a great sauce especially when you have excess tomatoes in your garden. I used it only as a guide and added extra spices. I agree with others that you need to blend all the ingredients at the half way point. I also added extra spices, salt & pepper when I added the tomato paste. I have made this 3 times now and will continue to use this recipe, but as a guide only. I didn't use carrots but did use courgettes and mushrooms - this is where blending is a good idea.

I made this for Christmas dinner to serve with stuffed shells. So delicious! I used two 28oz cans of whole tomatoes instead of fresh ones to lessen the work load. Next time I will try from scratch. The fresh veggies made it so yummy and healthy. I used five cloves of garlic and cut out the butter. I also increased the italian seasoning to one tspn. and added a 1/2 tspn. of sugar. I also added a tspn of salt at the two hour point and pureed the entire batch at the very end. Big hit!

I have a garden full of so many tomatoes I didn't know what to do with them all.  I have been giving them away at an amazing rate.  Still I needed something to do with all the rest.  I found this recipe and have used it several times now.  I love the carrots in it and the burgundy wine gives it a great flavor.  I add 1 pound each, browned hamburger, browned hot italian sausage at the 2 hour time.  My family loves this sauce over spagetti noodles.

This was the first time I ever made tomato sauce from scratch.  It came out very good.  I did make a few changes - I omitted the carrots and celery and used red, yellow and green peppers.  I added salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and a dash more italian seasoning.  I also made a bolognese with ground beef and veal.  This made the sauce very thick, so I added a touch more red wine.  Excellent recipe that I will definitely use again.

I made this yesterday with fresh tomatoes from my garden.  I really didn't care for it.  It wasn't full-bodied, but kind of watery tasting.  I didn't add the burgandy wine...maybe that made the difference?

This recipe was just what I was looking for! A great way to use up your summer harvest as some others have stated.  I like my sauce a little thick, so I took the advice of another reviewer an left the lid off for the last two hours.  Also - don't make the mistake I did and overcook the tomatoes in the beginning.  It will make it extremely difficult to seed and peel the tomatoes.

Good, a little tart, but that is to be expected with fresh tomatoes. A couple of teaspoons of sugar took care of that. I also added some ground meat to make it more hearty.

Definitely too many vegetables.  I used half of all the veggies except tomatoes and carrots.  I should have halved the carrots also.  The sauce is orange and tastes like carrots.  I had to add a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce to cut the carrot taste and salt.  Very bland.  Not sure if I'd try this particular one again.

This was really delicious sauce. I was low on time, so I simmered it for an hour, added homemade meatballs (that had been browned), and let them cook in the simmering sauce for 2 hours. I added about 2 tsp sugar and about 4 tsp. mixed salt.

Good recipe. Only thing I did different was I used a Victoria strainer to do my tomatoes. I then put all the pulp and juice in a zippered pillow cloth and hang it to drain for several hours. Believe  it or not the only thing that drains out is a greenish tinted water. Cuts cooking time in half.

It's a good basic tomato sauce. I didn't use the wine, puréed the veggies w/ the tomatoes (wouldn't want my boys to know that there's veggies in red sauce. Gasp!), and let it bubble in my crockpot all day. It's easy to set and forget after the initial prep. :-)

It's the second year for this recipe.  Used 35, 3/4 to 1# Big Boy Tomatoes.  Chopped 3 Jalepeno peppers for a little kick.  1 tbl. salt, 1 tbl. oregano.  Second simmer was 4 hrs., uncovered, to get thickened.  Produced 36, 4oz. servings.  Great!

This recipe is fantastic and worth the extra work.  After the initial cooking of the sauce, we added a bit of cooked chicken and Italian sausage and served with bowtie pasta.  Just wow is all we can say!

This sauce is a wonderful base for pasta sauce. I followed the recipe, but had to add salt, garlic powder, and more wine to jazz up the flavor. I added the rind of some Parmesan cheese and used a whole small can of paste as I used a few more tomatoes than 10. I love the flavor and the smell in my house is wonderful. I will make this sauce again as it is so delicious and full of possibilities. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed Patricia's lead except I forgot the Black Pepper. Best darn sauce I ever made. I canned it for a later meal. Those that have tasted it want me to make them some. Thank's Patricia.

Made this for the first time this morning. The best tomato sauce ever. I am going to freeze the remainder if it is not all eaten tonight. Very good way to use up all the extra tomatoes out of my lovely garden. All the tomatoes I used were Celebrity Tomatoes. Also used my Bell Peppers, Onions and basil fresh out of my garden.. :)

Terrific if you want a sauce with an italian type spice mix. I wanted a sauce that I could use to make enchilada sauce and tomato soup. The flavors were too italian. Very icky. Once I discovered that, I left the sauce in the freezer until I was making italian. Terrific as it was other than that.

We grew a lot of tomatoes this year and used this recipe to use up the ones that were overripe. It was delicious! We poured it over chicken breasts and topped with mozzarella. We also ate it over pasta. As always, we left out the sugar entirely and alternated the veggies we put in it, using zucchini and summer squash instead of the peppers. Scrumptious!

I made two batches of this sauce on two different occasions.  Both turned out excellent - with rave reviews from the family.  I won't go back to store bought sauce.  In the second batch I added in some hot peppers from the garden and it added some 'zing' to the sauce.  I also added in 2 tbsp of brown sugar to the second batch  (approximately 10 cups of sauce) - really added nicely to the sauce.  I used it to make lasagna the next night.  Wow!!

As the recipe stands I have to give it 3 stars.  I found it took a lot longer to thicken than 2 hours and I added more spice to flavour the sauce.  Good base...season to taste.

Hearty and worth the effort.  Multiplied the recipe by 4 times and it came out fantastic.  The only thing I did different was add a 1/4 cup of fresh Parmesan per batch, wow this is great stuff.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  It was definitely time consuming, but worth it if you can use tomatoes from your garden.  I had one lone tomato that wasn't popping or starting to peel but my advice is to pull it anyway from the pot.  When I finally pulled it, it was so mushy and gave me very little fruit out of it, that I was bummed b/c it was the largest tomato from the batch.  I also have a bag of jalapeno powder from Hatch, NM.  I added a pinch b/c it gives anything just a little pop when I am looking for flavor.  :-)

This is really good. Some advice I have is that you seem to need more than the 10 tomatoes recommended. I was lucky enough to have some cans of diced tomatoes to help even out the proportions. You also need to run some of the sauce through the blender or it will be all chunks. I cooked it the entire time with no lid because it was so soupy. I also added salt and pepper, which I think boosted the taste.

This is the first time I've made sauce from tomatoes from my garden.  I agree with other reviewers that not specifying the size of tomato or how many pounds made for an educated guess. The sauce is more on the orange side due to the carrots, but I like the thickness and consistency of the sauce.  A very good base with the basic ingredients, I added more of the spices, some sugar to offset the tomato paste, and mushrooms. I had to use tomatoes that I defrosted from the last harvest, so it was hard to tell what size they were or even what type.  I had at least 3 types of tomatoes in the garden this year, and they were all frozen together.  I also had difficulty removing the seeds because of the consistency of the tomatoes after defrosting Maybe puree then run through strainer?  Looking forward to adding meatballs and freezing some for later.

This was my first attempt at homemade tomato sauce with fresh tomatoes from my garden. It was definitely good for my first attempt. I took another reviewer's advice and blended the carrots instead of just taking them out altogether. That gave it an unique flavor, but next time will try it leaving the carrots out.

Turned out better than I expected.  The colour was a bit more orange than red but not off putting.  I scaled down the recipe without a problem.  As with the concerns other have had about the seasonings - just season to taste.  The type of tomato used will depend on the taste of the sauce.  I did puree the sauce because I have a veg phobic 4yr old.  No problems at all and he ate every last drop of sauce on his plate.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used a tomato press which saved time.  I also added more tomato paste and a can of chicken broth or beef broth, also some parmesan cheese at the end.

Great starter and then add your own preferences.  I'm only 3 hours in cooking and can't stop tasting it.   I did add more garlic, garlic salt, salt, pepper, some chicken bouillon granules, red pepper flakes, some sugar and hot italian sausage.  Awesome...  still tasting it on my lips.  :)

I had some "less than wonderful" tomatoes from my garden that needed to be used up so decided to try this.  My sauce looked nothing like the picture!  Even after running through the blender it was still a little chunky and was orange rather than red, but it really did taste good!  I combined it with my Italian neighbors meatballs and let them simmer for a couple of hours.  It actually got too thick so I had to thin it a little bit.  Really a good sauce but I won't do it often.  It was pretty labor-intensive.

Good for a basic sauce, but definitely needs something. I tripled the recipe as I had a lot of tomatoes and I think that must have scewed the ingredient proportions as it turned out very bland. But with everything.. taste test, and add as you please!

The recipe was a little bland for my tastes maybe because i didn't add wine... I suggest adding more tomatoes than the recipe calls for as they reduce to almost nothing. I cooked it for 3 hours

In addition to my previous review, I dehydrated 4 cups of the sauce until it was the consistency of a fruit roll up.  This made a very interesting gift for a visiting friend who is on a low sodium diet and is travelling by air.  Folded and sealed in bags, there's no worry of a bottle breaking and sauce leaking during the flight.

This was really good but had to guess on tomato count. I used a variety of tomatos out of my garden and doubled the recipe. I aslo added red pepper flakes for a kick. This takes a long time but is worth it to use up the crop. I will make again next year!

This is a great basic recipe.  I made it again with more spices, and was very happy with the result.  This works nicely with Roma tomatoes.  I hate peeling tomatoes, so I skipped that step and threw everything in the blender at the end- worked perfectly.  I agree with other reviewers that the recipe is rather small, but I thought it was worth it.

This is an excellent recipe.  This was my first time making sauce from scratch and it was easy.  I used green, red and orange peppers, onions, carrots and loads of spices.  I also added a jar of tomato sauce and have plenty left over to freeze.  I cooked the veggies and then pureed them along with the tomatoes and the sauce turned out perfectly.

Great recipe!  I modified just a little, adding some fresh chives and parsley from my garden (in addition to fresh basil).  Also omitted the celery and added red pepper flakes as my family likes heat.  Everyone in my family gave it a thumbs up.

This was excellent.  I used tomatoes from our garden, so it tasted incredibly sweet and fresh.  I left out the wine and added a little salt and pepper and it was just wonderful.  I also pureed all the veggies so it was more kid friendly.  I'm going to use all our extra tomatoes to make batches to freeze for over the winter.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely amazing, and so simple to make. Like a few others on here, I pureed all of the tomatoes (I don't like chunky sauce.) I also omitted the burgandy wine, using wine and garlic seasoning instead. I will never use another tomatos sauce recipe again!

This was a good place to start for making homemade sauce with all my garden tomatoes.  I used extra seasonings, including a dash of red hot pepper flakes, parsley and salt.  I also used an entire small can of tomato paste since I like my sauce a little thicker and omitted the butter.  It does take time to make but it is so refreshing to have a nice, garden fresh sauce!

Definitely not one of my fave sauces. I wanted to try out a different sauce recipe from my own (just to try something different) and picked this one because of the reviews. I made this exactly like the recipe... Disappointing, to say the least. Very bland and chunky! I had to put it in the food processor several times to try and get a creamy, velvety sauce. Just could not get that consistency. I blended it so much, the carrots made the sauce turn orange! My husband thought it was a Vodka sauce. We tried to add more seasoning after the 4 hours, but it was too late. You could probably use this recipe as a base to work with, but definitely add more seasoning!

Delicious, and a new staple recipe in my kitchen! I didn't change much except "eyeball" the ingredients and adjust accordingly since I used fresh local produce that isn't necessarily as big a size as the size of vegetables from the supermarket ("one" onion, "one" bell pepper, etc.).  I used meaty paste tomatoes, which are typically smaller, so I used more than 10. Instead of a food processor, I used my granny's hand-cranked food mill which separated out the seeds nicely without much waste (but using a food mill is labor intensive).  I found no need to add any extra sugar (tomatoes and onions are naturally sweet and carrots have been historically used as a sugar cane substitute in cooking). The sauce is flavorful enough on its own without added salt, but adding meat or grated cheese to the dish with this sauce will give a saltier flavor without ever having to reach for the salt shaker.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  This was the best sauce we've ever had.  It was so goooood!  So light, so fresh and pure and so healthy! My husband loved it so much that he wants me to make more and take it to our local farmer's market to sell.  Then he began talking about how rich we were going to become after selling this wonderful sauce!  I think it's safe to say it propelled him into another dimension.  I used a variety of approx. 20 ripe tomatoes from our garden: roma, early boy, beefsteak and grape tomatoes.  I didn't have any burgundy, so I used Merlot.  I didn't use the tomato paste to thicken.  Instead, I uncovered the sauce after 2 hours and simmer, simmer, simmer...for a total of 8-9 hours.  Then I put the sauce into 2 quart glass jars and into the refrigerator for 2 days to allow the flavors to meld.  Wow!  The flavor was terrific!  My first use of this sauce was an arrabiata version because I added red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.  Chorizo sausage, green pepper, Vidalia onion, mushroom, minced garlic and tri-color penne pasta with this wonderful sauce.  I'm going to take advantage of the season at hand and get a bushel of tomatoes and jar/water bath this sauce.  It will be nice to have the taste of Summer in the middle of Winter.  This will be my go-to sauce from now on.

Excellent recipe that I have used both with the garden harvest and in the interim with canned crushed tomatoes.  I usually use baby carrots and pull them out with the celery and bay leaf.  I don't know if it makes any difference but it always comes out great!  We usually freeze some for later as well.

Great recipe: Changes I made:  I didn't have burgundy wine but Pinot Noir is a perfect substitute.  I made this for my lasagna and should have doubled the recipe to make enough sauce for it.  If you're using it just for topping other things then the measurements are perfect.  Other changes: 1. tripled the tomato paste, blended all the veggies (used green and red pepper) with the tomatoes instead of just chopping them, added a ton more seasoning: red pepper, all spice, basil, celery salt and pepper.  It was amazing!  yum!

Made this recipe today...I agree with many that it is a "good base recipe"....as written...it comes out very bland.  I used black pepper, thyme, additional basil, and additional Italian Seasoning to make it taste great.  One great variable is the type of Tomatoes you may be using.....I am using Southern Tomatoes....Big Boys...and Better Boys...I used no sugar.  I also added at least a tablespoon of salt.  If you "play with it"....I am sure you can make it work for you.

What a Great recipe! I am eating it right now for lunch. We had an abundance of Tomatoes and Peppers this year and I figured I would try making sauce to can. I didn't need to add the tomato paste, my tomatoes were very meaty and after the 2 hour I added more oregano, thyme and Marjoram. I also kept the celery stock in -I used the heart of the celery so it would not be so dominate.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!

My husband made this recipe for the first time today.  The flavor is great with the exception that it needs more spices.  He followed the recipe to the letter, did't and still doesn't know why the carrots, using the recipe scaler program on this site.  We added salt and more fresh itialian spices.  He was looking for a smooth tomatoe sauce for use later and this was much chunkier more like a pasta sauce.  We took the sauce from the stove at the 2 hour mark, remove the bay leaves, and pureed it celery and all.  The sauce turned an orange color like a vodika sauce and thickened up nicely.

We will use this recipe in the future and see if back on the carrots will let it stay red.

We used San Marsano tomatoes, and my husband put in marsalla instead of burgundy.  
 Thanks to all who have commented and to the person who submitted this recipe.

This was my first time making tomato sauce. Having time on my hands and an abundance of tomatoes in the garden., I thought I'd give it a try. I followed the recipe as written until after the 2-hour mark. Then I added extra spices and herbs. It didn't make much but next year I'll plant more tomatoes!

Wow... this sauce tastes incredible!!! I was skeptical when I started because it was just so tomatoey and runny at first. I doubled the recipe because I had more than 20 organic tomatoes from our CSA. Other than doubling, I followed the recipe completely with the exception of adding just a bit of red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and sugar. The one thing I wasn't crazy about was de-seeding the tomatoes because I felt like I lost too much. Next time I may de-seed and just run that stuff through the blender longer than the tomatoes.

This is the best and I added a hot pepper to it and it really kicked it up a notch.  Also, I didn't need the tomatoe paste as it was nice and thick.  wonderful.

This is a very good BASIC tomato sauce recipe.  However if you follow it exactly, you will end up with a very basic and bland sauce.  

I use this recipe as a base, then add vinegar, sugar, worchestershire sauce, salt, and peppers to taste until it pops.

this was my first attempt at making my own tomato sauce, and it came out great!! I did not use carrots or celery. I kind of tweaked it a little and added more wine, garlic and more herbs than the recipe called for and I didn't cook it for 4 hours either, I only cooked this for 2 hours and it was still good.  I also added sausage for a little meatiness!  I will make this again for sure!!

Never thought I'd say this, but this sauce is better than Mom's! You can use crushed bay leaves if you don't have a whole leaf, and you don't have to remove them, and the sauce will be fine. I halved the recipe because I only had that many ingredients, and it was amazing. Thanks for a lovely vegetarian sauce!

Overall this is a yummy sauce.  I just think everyone has such different tastes when it comes to tomato sauce.  There was a bit too much italian seasoning for me.  I ended up adding more tomatoes to even it out a bit more.  I also added sugar as we tend to like sweeter sauces.  Making this one gave me a good base recipe and confidence to try some of my own alterations to tomato sauce though :)

I loved this recipe and did add some extra salt for flavor. I also added some ketchup as I do to all spaghetti sauces as for some reason it adds this little kick that I love. The carrots add a nice sweetness too.

I really appreciate this recipe. I definitely seasoned to taste (more salt and pepper, a tiny bit of sugar, more herbs).  It cooked down beautifully. I did a small dice on my veggies, but still decided to do a quick whip with my stick blender at the end. Mine was pretty red too.

i really do not like giving a recipe such critisism, but I did not care for this. first of all, WAY too much carrot!! the sauce was orange, not red. the carrots did not blend in-- and i shredded them instead of chopped them. the suace was extremely thick. it appeared to be dried out by the time it was finished cooking! then, on top of all the appearance problems, it tasted bland! if other eviewers had not mentioned adding salt, i wouldv'e totally forgot, and i think it would've tasted even more plain.  i will keep searching for a tomato sauce using fresh tomatoes. i am sorry.

This took way too long to make. It was very thin, so I had to blend it to get it thicker. The flavor was terrible and didn't taste like tomato sauce at all.

I wanted a slow simmered sauce and this one is great, full of flavor. I had an abundance of tomatoes so I doubled the recipe. The only change I made - I prefer red over green bell peppers and I added a couple serrano peppers from my garden for a touch of spice. ??

Delicious! I had over a dozen tomatoes become ripe all at once, so tried this recipe. The whole family commented how good the house smelled while this was simmering. They were even more impressed when I served this sauce over angel hair pasta with a bit of shaved Parmesan and fresh basil on top! This one is going into my favorites!

First time making with our fresh garden tomatoes, easy to follow recipe.  Great tips to cross cut tomato, poke holes, and core.  All peeled and de-seeded very easy. Will use for soup base and spaghetti sauce.

Our twin boys, Cody and Brody, came home for the first time since going off to college. As a special treat, we wanted to serve them some traditional homemade Italiano cuisine. This recipe sounded incredible and the community really seemed to love it. Unfortunately, the type of tomato was not specified. We now know that Roma tomatoes are best for this type of sauce. We used some beautifully plump heirlooms, but the juice was squirting all through the squeezing process. Might advise skipping out on all the vegetables too. The bay leaf did give it a certain Jan-a-say-kwa, which delighted the dog (NO, we did NOT feed the dog sauce, just let him smell).

Like many people in this group, I adapted it a bit (more garlic, no butter, no carrots because I didn't have any, lol).  It was the first time I made sauce from fresh tomatoes, and this was a very good "how to" for me.  thank you

Next time I make it I will omit the green pepper and substitute something else green, green olives, zucchini, parsley or cilantro.  the green pepper overshadowed the dishes flavor.

I used 13 romas. I recommend using at least that many. I also used an 8 oz can of tomato paste because it was too runny. It thickened it perfectly. I omitted the bay leaf, the peppers, the celery and the italian seasoning. All the other ingredients were perfect and the carrots was a nice addition! Came out delicious!

I actually made this 2 times!
The first time, I made it without the tomato paste. It was delicious!! I added tomato paste and it lost it's flavor.
So, 2nd time, no tomato paste!
   I also added a tiny bit of hot pepper to give it some zing!!
and some salt, and doubled up the carrots!! My kids love this!!!

I can hardly wait to make this tomato sauce.  I read a lot of the comments and the sauce sounds wonderful.  
 I prepare tomatoes to freeze every year.  I tried to make tomato sauce this year and it tasted okay.  But now I'm excited  to use this recipe and fresh herbs which I have in my garden.
When I prepare tomatoes for freezing, I put them all in the sink and rinse them off very well.  Then I cut them in chuncks and put them in my blender and puree them and pour them into a large pot.  I continue doing this until I've used up my tomatoes or my pot is full then I simmer them till they are cooked down let them cool and put into pint containers for freezing.  No spices or herbs or anything added.  When I get the tomatoes ready to puree I DO NOT remove the skin.  When the tomatoes are pureed there is no sign of the peelings.  I've been doing this for years and everything I make with the tomatoes tastes fine.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was very tasty.  Mine did turn watery.  I followed the directions pretty closely - no wine, but I substituted a little chicken broth.  Just too much work for the results...even though I had lots of tomatoes to use up!   Going to have to find something else to do with them the next time :)

Not bad, I would consider making it again with the additions I made. I read other people's comments and followed them. I  added beef stock as I did not have wine on hand. I also added zucchini  and summer squash to the sauce as well as other herbs, a smidge of brown sugar and some cayenne pepper to give it an oomph. I cooked it for 2 hours, then allowed it to cool O/N in the fridge. The following day I used an immersion blender before I cooked it another 2 hours.

Thank you for a great recipe! I had never made a sauce from fresh tomatoes before and was apprehensive. I had 18 pounds of tomatoes from the garden to deal with! But I set aside a cool evening and started. The skins do slip right off if you score the bottoms with an "x". This recipe, plus reading the other reviews, gave me the confidence to just go ahead and put all kinds of veggies in there. I'm going to wait and see how it thickens, before I decide to maybe immersion-blenderize it a bit. It's pretty chunky! Thanks to all cooks!

It was way too chunky so I put it through the food processor again and it looked and even tasted better.  I added salt and pepper since they weren't included in the recipe.  I canned the sauce, so I've not tasted it over pasta but the spoonful I tasted was very well rounded and complex.  The celery did break down alot so I had to fish it out bit by bit, but I'd add it again because I believe it added to the flavor.

This was good - used fresh tomatoes and the boil/chill method to remove skins, was kinda labor & time intensive.  Mixed everything together but my carrots are still in chunks and stick out of the sauce visually.  Flavor was good but maybe I'll puree the whole thing before adding to my pasta.  I did freeze a couple bags of this for later!

I loved it but I only used it as a base. I changed abit of the recipe.  I used an orange and yellow bell pepper instead of the carrot and celery. used fresh herbs oregano, Italian parsley, basil. I also blended everything up. Used sea salt and beef broth for boiling things and inside the sauce instead of wine. I added mushrooms and sliced spinach. but I think this is hands down the best sauce that I have ever had.

This was a good start but I did change some things. I used Roma tomatoes and about 18 of them, next time I will use 30-40. This made enough sauce for about 6 servings so I want more next time. I roasted the tomatoes by cutting them in half lengthwise and removing the cores and seeds. I then put them in the oven on a sheet pane at 450 for 35 minutes or so until they started to char a bit. At the same time I roasted a whole head of garlic. I added all of that to my Vitamix when done without removing any skins. I did add some garlic cloves to the sauce as well as we love garlic. 

All great and I will probably double most of the spices and tomatoes next time. We have lots of tomatoes in the summer and this was great. 

Thanks.

I wish this had said FINELY chopped in the directions, I found my end result to be a bit chuncky for lasagna, but probably perfect for spaghetti. As a non-drinker I had to phone a friend to ask what was good so a few suggestions within the recipe here would be nice. I used double butter because I had additional tomatoes and a rather large onion. After I added meat and sautéed mushrooms I put this concoction into my lasagna dish. It took all day to make and 15 minutes to eat ;)

This turned out a little blander than I was expecting. I'll need to add more spices next time. Otherwise. the texture was good and it was a good use of too many tomatoes from the garden.

I did not add the sugar, and didn't use the wine. Next time, wine or stock.

The only way to really make delicious fresh tomatoe sauce is to use the freshest farmer market summer tomatoes.  No use using anything else, only in summer.  Also, where is the salt??  I use 4 tsp flaky sea salt, like all the Italians.  This sauce has too many ingredients to make up for flavourless tomatoes.

Delicious sauce  but you need to add salt at halfway mark.  We also added a dash of cayenne which upped the flavor profile and made it richer.

I had such high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews, but this sauce was so bland! I made it exactly like the recipe stated, and I thought it would taste similar to the sauce I've had in Italy, but not even close! To doctor it up I added more paste, salt and Italian seasoning, but it still needed something. I ended up adding left over jar marinara sauce just so we could eat it. Sorry, but this just wasn't for us.

Started making oodles of this particular recipe a few years ago when the tomatoes from our garden were abundant. Froze it and ate it all winter. Absolutely delicious! Instantly a family-favourite and our go-to tomato sauce recipe ever since.

I read through many reviews and based on that I made just a couple of changes. I did score the tomatoes before blanching which made peeling so MUCH easier, and I did add the beef broth in place of wine. This was a great recipe and I like that I can add this and that to make it better. I can't believe how the carrots cut out the acidity and added natural sweetness!

The store had vine tomatoes on sale so I used 10,,bigger than roma....peeled the tomatoes but I like the seeds left. Followed the recipe but added 1 teaspoon of salt, sliced the carrots and celery so I can remove later. Did not add sugar because carrots add natural sugar.Did not use butter and added a tish of black pepper. This is great !

I did not add any water to mine at all. I loved this recipe.  I used 2 large canning jars of my own tomatoes from my garden.  Everything else is the same.  I did add some oregono and a green pepper.  I didnt have any red wine so I put a little Moscoto and it tastes great.  I love it.  I am even using the spaghetti squash from my garden as noodles.  Mmmmmmm Good.

Very good base recipe, just wish I would have had more.  It would of been nice to can this.  If expecting to can ... you should triple or quadruple this recipe.

Was not quite what I was expecting. Definitely tasted like there was quite a few veggies in the sauce vs just tasting like a tomato sauce.

Did'nt have carrots or celery and used beef stock in place of wine. I had to leave it simmering for hours and it thickened so much I then had to add a coupla cups of water. It  was still incredible! This time (today, actually!) I'm going to add the wine and I imagine it will be even better, if that's possible.

Loved this! I added some salt and pepper and some chipotle seasoning for some kick. I also substituted the wine for vegetable broth. Was really good.

I Will never buy store bought spaghetti sauce again. What I did different is I used 2 onions instead of 1,Jarred minced  garlic instead of fresh, I used three bay leaves instead of 1, I used dried parsley, dried oregano ,some Creole seasoning ,and some basic Italian seasonings that I had in the spine cabinet.I didn't have any dry wine but I did use cupcake brand Moscato 6 ounces to be exact, since I was short four tomatoes i used a full 6oz can of tomato paste. No matter how good this is going to smell while it's cooking give it all the time it needs. Start out by bringing it to a boil and then bring it to the absolutly lowest low that you can without losing heat cover it and let it go for 3 hours. Stir it once an hour just to make sure that you don't burn it.

Im going to make more and freeze it in ziploc bags.

We had a lot if extra tomatoes and this made a good sauce overall. I modified the spices to our taste and added about a teaspoon of salt. I'd definitely make this again

Having never made homemade sauce before I tried this one. I did end up using more tomatoes than called for because mine were smaller. I followed the directions till the two hour mark then added pepper, salt, and more garlic and italian seasonings. I then let it simmer the extra two hours and added it straight to the cooked ground beef. At this point I added more tomato paste to make it saucier.  Overall I would make it again, just with my simple changes.

Added extra seasonings as suggested by other viewers which gave the sauce a more flavorful taste.  My batch came out a little more watery than expected, even after adding a bit more tomato paste and letting the sauce simmer uncovered, but overall it was a great sauce.  I pureed all the vegetables after sauteing them and my family had no clue that any veggies were in the sauce.

Hm, this was okay.  I used a few tomatoes that were "use it or lose it" and a whole onion (I like onion).  Threw in about three times the wine the recipe suggested because just a quarter cup wasn't enough depth of flavor.  Ended up adding in a can of tomato paste just to thicken and make it more rich.
Might make again, I don't know. Would really need to tweak somehow, just not sure how.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I did blend it to make my family happy.  I cooked it for less time, left out the wine, and added extra spices as suggested by others.  My two picky eaters raved!!!!
