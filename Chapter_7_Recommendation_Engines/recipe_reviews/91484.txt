I use it all the time and it's absolutely wonderful. Make sure you use about a pound of ice cubes...one tray may not be quite enough. One very important missing bit of info...make sure you rinse chops thoroughly and pat dry with paper towel before you cook.  They are best if grilled or broiled. Don't be afraid of the salt...but make sure not to marinate more than the 2 hours...slightly less if chops are very thin...this is NOT an overnight brine.

We used 1 cup water (eliminated ice cubs)  with 1 cup vinegar and brined for 24 hours.  Next time will cut back on salt 1/4 cup.  These were very tender and flavorful.  Topped pork chops with apple, walnut and bacon pieces.  We always, always, brine our pork chops.  It makes ALL the difference in the world!!

I'm very new to this - have never made a marinade, I don't think, so maybe I made some beginner mistakes 
I followed the recipe to the letter, using 2 lbs. of boneless pork chops (8 of them). I suppose that after marinating them for two hours, the instructions should have said to discard the brine (probably second nature for experienced cooks). But when I pan-fried my first two chops, I poured a bit of the brine into the pan. Bad mistake - it's not like sauteeing something in olive oil; the brine quickly turned black and burned awfully in the pan for the last half of the cooking time. After that, I got rid of all of the brine, leaving the moistened chops in my fridge.
Unlike the experience of other reviewers, I found that even cooking the chops as suggested (medium-high, or 8/10 on my range's dial), the chops did indeed turned out juicy and moist - a pleasant surprise. The flavors of the brine were pretty interesting, but the excess salt was a drawback. Should I have quickly rinsed the chops in water before cooking, as another reviewer suggested? I may make this again, and I'll try that if I do.

Was great. Only marinated for 1 hour and rinsed of any extra salt/liquid on the outside. Cooked on low heat to ensure it stayed moist. Used thicker cut chops and after marinating stuffed them with a pork stuffing.  Mmmm Mmmmm Mmmm will make over and over.

i cut the salt to 1/2 cup and added a couple cups water and some liquid smoke. I let the country ribs soak all day and BBQ'd them slow at about 250 degrees.  They got rave reviews!

Not very good.  There was absolutely NOTHING tender about my pork.  Luckily I coated my pork with a smathering of maple bacon.  I would substitue apple juice in place of the vinegar, but may never know, because I fear to subject a nice piece of meat to such brutality.

This is a great recipe...and you can always add in your own herbs and such for added flavour.
But remember this is a brine, not a marinade, so the vinegar and salt are required. The general rule for brining is an hour per pound and you must rinse the meat before cooking it. Your meat should not turn out salty if all is done correctly. If brined for too long, the salt will start to break down the meat and the result will be salty, badly textured meat.

This marinade is easy, no ingredients that you don't already have in your cupboard and I used Iowa chops with the bone in and they were out of this world tasty!

I cut the salt in half, as others suggested, but my pork still ended up WAAYYY too salty.  Just too much salt and not enough flavor.  I even finished it with a molasses glaze, and that couldn't cut the salty taste.

As Amber said in '08 this is Alton Brown's recipe and is very good.  However, the recipe as listed here leaves out some important instructions, hence the 3-star rating.

Alton calls for 1 lb of ice, the brine should be very cold when adding the pork, with even a few icecubes remaining after chilled.  Then marinate NO MORE than 2 hours in the brine.  Lastly, this is a brine not a marinade... discard the brine after use and rinse the pork well under cold running water then pat dry.  Season your chops as you usually would without salty products (the brine takes care of that) and grill as you normally do.  I like to use an herb blend or chili powder rub before grilling indirect @ 300-350º until the internal temp hits 110º, then grill direct until its done to your liking... at least 145º.

I don't know who "THEY" is that said to not smoke pork, but "THEY" is crazy.  HOWEVER, I just grilled mine and this was fantastic.  I had inch thick, boneless, center cut, loin chops that I brined for the suggested two hours and they couldn't have been better.  Due to a recent health issue (not preference) I was a "good girl" and cut the salt by half and even for this salt lover, they were lovely.  AS WITH ANY BRINE, I did rinse it from the meat and pat the copes dry prior to putting it on the grill.  Thanks for an easy, pantry friendly recipe I'll use again often.   And remember folks, the only "dry" pork chop is an over cooked pork chop!  If you cook meat too long, there's not a brine or marinade in existence that can save it.  That's why we have "gravy". :-)

Brine was great, pork was very flavorful. Left mustard out because I didnt have any and did not feel like buying more. 

For those whom say it is too salty you either forgot to rinse the brine off before grilling or you didnt use Kosher or Sea salt. This is originally an Alton Brown recipe and he never uses the iodized table salt we were used to growing up.

to those who complain this is too salty, remember this is a brine, not a marinade!  remove the pork after 2 hours and rinse it.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the pork was juicy, flavorful, and not at all salty.  if you leave it in the brine too long you'll just turn the chops into ham.  never treat a brine like a marinade

We did not care for this. After brining for 1.5 hrs, the loin chops were very salty and not tender, though they were somewhat moist. THis sounds very simple but I recommend caution if you have never brined meat. The title is "brine", but the description calls it a "marinade" so those that have never brined( like me) would be led to believe they are one and the same. Apparently they are not. While I didn't appreciate some of the pointed remarks that "everyone" should know to rinse the meat, I did follow the advice and I did use kosher salt.  Otherwise I made no changes.   Even with rinsing and not using table salt this was so difficult to eat. I had to hide it in big bites of mashed potato to finish.   I don't think it's considered "messing up the recipe" to follow the author's instructions. This is supposedly lacking vital  information but not every cook can be expected to know that. We will not attempt this again, even with alterations, sorry.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions, and used about 1/3 the salt listed. I brined pork chops for 4 hours, and rinsed well, then brushed with a mixture of balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, cracked pepper and garlic powder. They were the best grilled pork chops we have ever made. Flavorful and moist.

as another reviewer  mentioned, this is very similar to Alton  Brown's recipe. Alton's only uses 1/2 cup salt, and I would suggest following his. With the salt reduced you should be able to leave in the brine overnight. Definitely rinse the pork after brining!

The amount of salt called for vs water is ludicrous AND should specify kosher salt (it makes a huge difference!). This brine recipe calls for WAY too much salt & not enough water. You need thick pork chops for any brining as far as I'm concerned. Actually, a better use is for large pork butt or shoulder roast (overnight brining) prior to smoking or slow cooking. I get juicy, tender 3/4" boneless chops using a milder version brine (I sear & braise). A proper brine needs much more water vs the vinegar/salt ratio and a tray of ice cubes will not cut it. This brine as written is way out of proportion and will 'pickle' any pork. If you use as written..you won't be happy and don't believe any good reviews (most of them have been altered). Hope this helps somebody out there thinking about utilizing this brine recipe. Sorry, I do not like to be harsh...being honest.

I read the reviews and wanted to add something. Keep in mind when using brine that not all cuts of pork need to be marinated in brine, and adjust the time you soak the meat accordingly. if your meat is coming out too salty you soaked it too long.

I cut the salt to 1/2cup. I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1 stick of cinamon since I stuffed my boneless pork chops with goat cheese and apples. I was so pleased, my chops came out so juicy and flavorful. I think they sat for about 4hrs in the brine. I will always use this recipe from now on!!! Thank you from saving us from dry and hard chops. REMEMBER PEOPLE: you MUST wash the brine off meat before cooking it.

We tried this on thick cut pork chops and it was amazing.  Don't cut the salt down like others are saying.  Just make sure you follow the instructions exactly as stated.  After 2 hours, pull the pork chops and rinse thoroughly under cold water.  After that, place the chops in a bowl of ice water for about 5 minutes.  Pat dry and cook.  I used olive oil and fresh ground pepper and they were amazing!

HELLO, this is a BRINE, NOT a MARINADE. There is a difference. The type and cut of meat determines the brine time. A turkey goes longer and the pork chops should go no longer than 2 hours or you will have salty meat. You should alway rinse your meat after the brine and throw away the brine. The brine is changing the meat fibers to make the meat moister. This is also Alton Browns recipe, he has a video on brining also that is cool. I recommend the peeps who messed up try again and follow the directions exactly, it does make a difference.

This is our new favorite way to prepare BBQ spareribs!!!!! After marinating the slab of pork spareribs i patted them dry, place them in a baking dish with a little water and covered them with foil.  Baked in 300 oven about 30 minutes, then finished them on the grill.  You could easily do without the sauce because them flavor if the ribs are delicious as is!

Very good.  Like others, I decreased the salt to 1/4 cup.  I marinated a pork tenderloin, and it turned out very tender and flavorful.

Pork was not tender and if you dont fully rinse all the brine off the meat it will be salty, recipe calls for one cup of salt way to much maybe a 1/4 cup of salt would do better , will never use this brine again

I'm giving this 4 stars because even though I modified it based on what others wrote, it is a good brine mixture.  For 4 thick chops, I used 1 c cider vinegar, 1/4 c salt, 2/3 c brown sugar, 2 t. black pepper, 2 t mustard powder and 2 c ice water.  I think the mistake many people made was they either left it in brine too long or did not rinse well enough.  You MUST rinse brined meat very thoroughly to wash off the salt.  I let the rinsed chops rest in a bowl of ice water for about 5 moinutes, themn pat dry and cooked.

This is Food Network's Alton Browns recipe.  Amazingly it does brine the pork in two hours.  I would recommend cutting the salt in half and make sure to use kosher salt, not regular table salt.  It does make the pork chop more juicy.

As featured on Good Eats - Alton Brown, use coarse salt, not table salt.  But even still, the pork was SUPER salty and I only marinaded for one hour.  Cutting back on the salt and adding more ice water next time.  After marinading, I proceeded with the Caramel Apple Pork Chops recipe here on AllRecipes.

I followed this recipe exactly, but I used 1.5lbs of pork chops.  This was so incredibly SALTY, we had to stop eating it.  I might use 1/4 C of salt next time.

Too salty! I only marinaded my ribs for 2 hours as recommended and then I rinsed them very well and I still couldn't taste anything but salt, I put BBQ sauce on them and I couldn't even taste it, yuck!

The general rule of thumb for brines is 1 cup of salt PER GALLON of water. This recipe had WAAAAAAYYYYY too much salt. It made the meat very salty and we could hardly eat it. However, after reducing the amount of salt (by 3/4 of a cup) this brine would be very delicious. Next time I try it, I will omit most of the salt. I did add a bit of thyme to the brine as well. Can't wait to try it again with the appropriate amount of salt.

This is a great recipe (It's actually Alton Brown's recipe.) except it is missing one crucial step...You have to thoroughly rinse the meat under cold water before you cook the meat.  I always use this brine on my inch thick chops before I dust them with a rub and then smoke them for about an hour in my smoker.  Give it a try and be sure to rinse the brine off the meat.

I loved the way my pork tasted afterward. I added a tsp minced garlic and a tsp rosemary and let it set for about 3 hours (we had very thick cuts of pork) and then we grilled them. They were sooo juicy and savory.

This brine was amazing! I marinated some pork chops last night but only had them in the brine for about an hour and a half because everyone was hungry.  The pork was so flavorful and juicy after we grilled it!  I can't wait to have pork chops again because of this recipe!

Tried this recipe verbatim twice thinking that I some how made a mistake the first time. Pork and vinegar and salt simply don’t mix unless you are trying to archive some sort of pickled pork, salty and tart beyond description. The cutlets literally shrank 1/3 of there size (2) times as stated. When I removed them from the brine, only after 1 ½ hours , the culets were white (pickled) , and tuff even before I put them on the grille.

WAYYYY too much salt.  My husband made this yesterday, marinated the chops, and grilled them.  We took two bites and could not eat them because of the salt.  And I am a "salt-aholic!"  He will probably try it again and cut the salt drastically, as well as marinate a shorter period of time.  We are going to try to take what's left of the meat and chop it into very small pieces to use for fried rice or something similar to salvage the meat.

Used this for a pork loin and it turned out fantastic!  Used 1/2 cup sea salt and 1/2 cup kosher salt (just because this was all I had, I don't use table salt to brine meat).  Added a bit of liquid smoke and about an extra quart of water to cover the pork loin in my brining bucket.  3 lb loin, brined for about 6 hours (it turned a funny whitish color), roasted uncovered at 350 for an hour to juicy, fork-tender results!  No problem with excessive saltiness that some reviewers complained of.

I used the brine and then smoked the chops in a smoker. They were the best chops I've made in a long time. Not dried out.
Will definitely use this recipe again. I know they say not to smoke pork but I made sure the smoker got to a high enough temp and they were great.

Well, I should have read the reviews before I used this.  I usually do, but I guess I was in a hurry. Definitely NOT an overnight brine.  My pork chops we WAY too salty.  Will try again and not marinate overnight next time. I like the idea of rinsing them too.

This technique is super!  My thick, boneless pork chops were perfect!  Moist and tender after a few hours in the brine solution, and 15 minutes total on the grill.  I didn't change a thing, but my husband sure complained about the odor of the solution when I was putting it together. He was sure the meat would taste bad, but was he wrong!

This was very good!!!  I only had 1/2 of the apple cidar vinegar, so I used that and 1/2 as white wine vinegar.  I brined it only for 2 hours as suggessted earlier.  It had tons of bright, summery but full flavor and was very tender.  (My biggest problem with pork chops is that they are tough and these were perfect tenderness.) It was a little salty though, and even decreasing the brining time didn't help with that.  I forgot to tell my husband to rinse the chops before grilling, so we'll try that next time along with decreasing the salt just a bit.

This is so good!I only used 1/4 c of salt and didn't have brown sugar so I used sugar and honey.I used country style ribs and put BBQ sauce on it the last 10 minutes.

I tried this recipe and was very disappointed with the results.The pork chops were very salty and  we did not find the brine improved the quality ( tenderness and juiciness)of the pork chops .My husband will not eat pork( unless it is some type of shoulder roast.)I'm trying to find a recipe that he will really enjoy and I can prepare more often.
When trying a new recipe I always follow the recipe but this just didn't  produce a a tender and juicy chop.I will continue to try other pork recipes on this site and maybe come across a keeper.

My 4 yr old, who usually has to be tricked into eating meat, asked for seconds! A couple of slight changes: I didn't have any mustard powder on hand so I added a dash of cumin, and I'm cooking for a diabetic so I substituted brown sugar Splenda blend for the sugar. Stuck it in the slow cooker for about 90 minutes and it was practically falling apart it was so tender, and the taste was a great blend of salty sweet.

This is awful!  It was so salty I couldn't take but 1 bite.  I had to rinse it after it was cooked but it didn't help.  My Boyfriend is a chef and he always makes fabulous meals.  I felt bad that this was the first meal I could not eat and enjoy in the 2 years we have been together.  I definitely do not recommend this at all!  Disgusting.

It was awful!  My pork tasted like pure salt. You couldn't taste anything else. I think it should say 1 Tablespoon, not cup.  I wasted 2 lbs of pork and had to quickly come up with something else to serve for dinner

I normally do not like pork chops at all. But I have to say I seriously just became a fan of Pork Chops after trying this Brine! After they marinated for 2.5 hours I took them to the BBQ grill and just basted in a bit of home made BBQ sauce. They were to die for tender and juicy! I'll be trying it with a Pork Tenderloin next! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I used a small pork loin with this recipe.  It was great to make the pork tender and juicy but I did leave it in a little to long, my error.  Hubby still liked it with the extra flavor of the apple cider vinegar.  Next time I won't leave it in as long.

This was an epic fail. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated the pork chops for only two hours, per the recipe. I pan-fried the chops (like I normally do) but they didn't come out juicy as promised. They were rubbery and so salty that they were almost inedible. Also, the apple cider vinegar made them taste "off," almost as if they were on the brink of going bad. Suffice it to say, I'm taking this one out of my recipe box!

This gave a nice flavor to the pork chops although a bit too salty and they turned out really tough. Might try this again though.

This recipe is not for the timid.  It is way too salty, and in my case did not tenderize the chops.  Frankly, we will never try it again, even with modifications.

Even though I rinsed the marinated pork chops thoroughly in a colander for several minutes, it was too salty for my taste and inedible.  I threw it out.

Awesome...I reduced the salt by half, but followed the recipe beyond that and then grilled the chops.  This brine turned a boring cut of pork into perfection!

I have always had a problem getting pork chops tender (unless I cooked them for hours and hours) Then I tried this recipe! I used a third of the salt & soaked them for just an hour, and they turned out absolutely  wonderful! I can hardly believe what a difference the brine made. My entire family LOVED them so I will be making them again and again! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Like many other reviewers, I used way less salt than the recipe specified. Followed pretty much everything else and the pork chops tasted absolutely fantastic. They were also very juicy.

Everyone really loved it! One of my guests even said they doesn't usually eat the fat, but couldn't resist for these chops. It's a great recipe! However, though I had to double the recipe, I didn't double the amount of salt. In fact, I added a bit less than a cup and it came out fine. Truth be told, since I can't get real brown sugar here (in France), I improvised with their version (more like Sugar in the Raw) plus adding maple syrup and fresh tarragon. That could've affected the balance of sugar and salt. In any case, I'd suggest reducing the amount of salt. Other than that, it's a great recipe!

Definitely a wonderful marinade!!!!  I agree that you should cut the salt content to 1/4-1/2 cup.  It was the most juicy and tender meat I have had in quite a while! My kids (5y and 3y) scarfed it!!!

YUMMY. Moist, juicy pork chops. I cut the salt in 1/2 as others suggested. After they soaked in the brine for about 1 1/2 hours, I also rinsed them off, patted them dry with paper towels and rubbed them with a bit of canola oil to keep them from sticking to the grill. I used boneless loin chops that were about 3/4 inch thick. I grilled them for a total of 15 minutes, turning once about half way through. I will definately make this again--love the subtle apple flavor. My 4 year old kept asking for "more meat".

Did not make any changes to this recipes.  It was just okay.  Not one of the better recipes that I've been fortunate enough to obtain on all recipes.  Probably will not use this one again without some revision.  However, I believe that once I change it, it is no longer the same recipe.  Sorry, just was a bit disappointed with this one.  Used on center cut pork chops which were lean.  Was looking for a recipe that would help the chops retain their moisture.

Rave reviews from my family! I subbed red wine vinegar for the apple cider vinegar, and did a bit less salt. The chops sat in the brine for two hours and then were rinsed twice under cold water. I stuck them in the fridge for about 30 minutes before my husband grilled them. Turned out great!!

it did an excellent job tenderizing the meat in a small amount of time.  You definitely should pat the excess brine off before cooking, I didn't and things were a tad too salty.

This was okay, a little too vinegary to me, and I like the taste of vinegar.

ABSOLUTELY the WORST brine I have ever used!!!! It was so salty that it ruined 2 pounds of extra thick hand cut pork chops!!! It was completely inedible and I was mortified because I had my in-laws over for dinner! BEWARE!

My sugar didn't dissolve all the way and just settled on the bottom which worried me. I tried putting the brine back on the heat and boiling some more, but it didn't help. I continued with the rest of the directions anyway. My husband said they were a little on the salty side, but we both thought they were delicious!
