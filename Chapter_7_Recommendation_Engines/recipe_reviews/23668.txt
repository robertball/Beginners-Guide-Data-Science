The cookie looks awsome but the taste was okay. Not overly "chocolatity" or "minty." To add a little bit more mint taste, I dipped the cookies in semi-sweet chocolate, with a tsp of pepermint extract. It gave the cookies a little something extra they needed. I also like the black and white cookie look, so didn't use the food coloring. I think it looks more "upscale" with out it.

I tried 3 different pinwheel recipes, and this turned out best -- easy dough to work with, before and after refrigeration. I altered the recipe for a holiday cookie by replacing the chocolate and mint with green and red food coloring, and mixing strawberry spreadable fruit into the red dough. The cookies were the prettiest I made, although my husband did say they were  kind of bland, even with the strawberry in it.

this is a crunchy cookie, not a soft one.  they do take a bit of effort to make, but the resulting cookies are quite pretty.  this is a cookie you make for parties, not something you whip up for a sweet tooth.  i thought they were just a tad on the bland side, but still very good.

This cookie is the best, if you like cookies that are not too sweet. I like that this cookie wasn't just a one cookie taster, with this cookie you want more than one. The kids like the recipe a bit more with 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. I also did the double color some I made with green and chocolate and some with red and chocolate, very festive. And a great cookie.

I rolled the edges in green sugar for some sparkle and crunch. Very good cookie that keeps well.

A delicious, easy and attractive cookie for any plate.  Reminds me of a Laura Secord Mint Chocolate Bar!

I really enjoyed this recipe because I do a lot of candy for my Christmas gifts and this is a "not so sweet" treat to add to the bunch!  I did increase the sugar to 3/4 cup like someone suggested, and I used 3 Tbs. powdered cocoa with 1 Tbs veggie oil in place of the melted unsweetend chocolate because it keeps the dough more soft for rolling after taking it out of the refridge.  I would have given this a 5 star if I did not feel the changes were needed:)  Thanks this will be a keeper!!

For some reason, I just couldn't get the chocolate dough to work out right.  When I added the melted chocolate, it turned into a crumbly mess.  Rather than toss it all out, I melted some chocolate chips (with some peppermint extract and a little vegetable oil mixed in) and spread that over the white dough in place of the chocolate dough.  I rolled it up and cut it just like the recipe says, and they turned out great, like swirly minty chocolate chip cookies!

This was sooo easy! It took me minutes to make and i simply put them in the freezer until they became firm enought to slice. I didn't melt any chocolate, but instead used some cocoa and shaved dark chocolate that way they would give more flavour. I made them for my son's teacher as a Christmas gift ( shes prefers homemade gifts) and they are so pretty in the box! I cut them a bit thick so they would be softer and rolled them out on parchement with a bit of flour. I did however notice that they stick even to the parchment so curb any frustration i made one dough in the shape of a rectangle then did the same to the other and placed one on top of the other than I rolled it out, worked fine. Thanks so much for the recipe. It is soo hard to find a good pinwheel recipe but at last I found one that has potential.

This were easier than I thought to make.  instead of making one batch, I made two.  One I colored red as I couldn't find my green colouring, and the other I left white as I have a relative that is allergic to dye.  I did however add a little bit more peppermint just to kick it up a bit

AWFUL!  These cookies are SO bland...and the dough is a pain in the butt to work with.  It took me five tries to roll the dough out without ripping it and being able to pick it up.  They look cute, but that is all.  What a waste of time.
