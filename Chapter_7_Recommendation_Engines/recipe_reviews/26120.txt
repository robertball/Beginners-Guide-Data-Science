OMG, these are so delicious!!! I have made them three times in as many weeks! Be careful, the dough is so thick that I have almost burnt up my mixer. And I had to adjust the cooking time to 13 to 15 minutes. But give these a try... you won't be disappointed!

These were really good!  I agree that they taste a lot like cinnamon rolls...I even used cake mix with pudding in it, and they still turned out soft and wonderful...they were a real hit on my floor.

These taste nothing like cinnamon rolls (I have to admit I was already skeptical about it due to the chocolate, which is not in cinnamon rolls).  They taste like chocolate cake mix with cinnamon chips - who could have thought up a worse combination.  I won't make these again.

My family loves cookies, but this one did not go over very well.
