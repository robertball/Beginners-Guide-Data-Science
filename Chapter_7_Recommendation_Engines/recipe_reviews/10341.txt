These cookies are fantastic.  I love them also better than chocolate chip.  Mine come out so nice and crispy, and perfectly chewy at the same time, and the taste is wonderful.  I put the malted milk balls in a ziplock bag and hit with a rubber mallet to break them up.  Hope that helps.  Shannon

I really like it!!! I made these for my work mates for xmas this year, they all loved them, except that I have cut down about 1/3 of sugar and I still found them too sweet, while my workmates like them sweeter..=) Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

This cookie has really good flavor but think it would be better with 1 stick butter and 1 stick margarine - cookie wont flatten out quite so much.  Not sure why she says they serve 12 - i made 60 cookies from this recipe.  Despite above 
we malted milk balll lovers loved them and I will definately make them again.

Very good cookies but I made a couple of changes.  First I made these with 2 cups of Robin Eggs (candy coated malted milk balls) and 1 1/4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  Second I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup of each sugar because the Robin Eggs are much sweeter than the original malted milk balls.  Third I added 2 tsp of vanilla.  I had to cook longer, for about 12 min.  The cookies are very thin but nice and crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle.

This cookie flattens out WAY more than I like.  I even used one stick butter and one stick margerine and they still flattened more than I wanted.  I also added 1/2 cup malted milk powder.  I probably will not use this again because I have another recipe for a similar cookie that I like better.

What a great way to use up some halloween candy.  The malt balls by themselves are OK, but in this cookie-divine!  I didn't quite have enough, so I also broke up some crunch bars and threw those in.  Thank you!

Followed the recipe but added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. They are pretty much everything I want in a cookie. Crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. Next time I think I'll cut back the sugar to about a half cup white and brown and add 3/4 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips. Great recipe! Sorry for all the pics, I didn't think they were uploading.

Didn't change anything. Came out delicious. Chewy center and crispy edges. Great way to use up all the Whoppers candy I had laying around!

I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 pan for 25 minutes. This is the basic Nestle chocolate chip recipe with Malteaser instead of chips, how can you go wrong? My son and friends enjoyed these for a playdate snack.

After following other reviewers suggestions, I went with 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine hoping to avoid cookies flattening.  I also chilled the  dough before rolling and after putting on cookie sheets.  The finished cookie was flat as a pancake, more like a crepe ;-( .  They tasted ok, but are not presentable for anything other than family snacking, not holiday cookie platter  selection as originally planned.   Will not make again.
