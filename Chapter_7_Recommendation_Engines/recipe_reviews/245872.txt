The flavors on this pizza work so well together!  I used my own dough recipe and baked it in the oven at 525F before then putting it under the broiler briefly because I like to get the cheese and top crust a little browned.  Make sure you drain the ingredients well so that the crust doesn't get soggy in the middle.  This makes a nice summer dinner but would also be good for an appetizer.

This was a huge hit with my friends and family.  I made a vegetarian version for Ash Wednesday last night.  We had several kinds of pizza, and this was by far the favorite of the night.

I used marinated artichoke hearts substituting the marinade for the pesto.  Easy Marinated Artichokes (by KnifeForkand aSpoon) is a great way to make your own from the canned plain ones.  I used Greek seasoning rather than Italian.

MINOUCHKA -- This was so easy and fantastic tasting.  I made it w/o chicken, and I also made it w/ left over roasted chicken au lieu of the can chicken.  I do not care to cook w/ any can mean except tuna fish, sardines or salmon.  W/O chicken or left over roasted chicken this pizza is awesome!  ??

These were a smashing success!  This was really flavorful and everyone loved it.  I modified it somewhat to use up ingredients I had on hand.  I used kalamata olives instead of plain black olives.  I added capers and just a tiny bit of minced jalapeno peppers.   I eliminated the onion because I don't tolerate onion well but I'm sure it would be delicious.   I also used individual pizza crusts that I purchased (5 in a bag).   To serve as an appetizer, I cut each individual pizza into eight slices.  This was so easy!  I chopped and mixed up all the ingredients in the early morning and when it was "show time" I had these out on the table in 15 minutes!

I cheated with a ready-to cook pizza crust, but did use my home-made pesto and our home-canned chicken. Also added some mozzarella on top to minimize hubby's protest ;) . Was excellent, got a double thumbs up from my other half. He even decided he likes Feta.

Really good pizza. I used fresh chicken cutlets instead of canned chicken and added some fresh mozzarella and it was awesome.

This was a really good pizza and super easy to make.  Fairly healthy too, as far as pizzas go!
