This quick and easy hero sandwich definately deserves a "5" for ease of preparation, and it's delicious to boot.  It just doesn't get any better than that. I used a 26 oz. jar of commerially prepared onion, garlic and herb pasta sauce along with 18 frozen, packaged Italian-style beef meatballs.  I topped these with monterey jack and parmesan cheese (didn't have mozzerella on hand).  This recipe is a keeper for sure and will be made again and again for a family who bugging me regularly for them.

Very good hot sandwich. I used meatball nirvana recipe and store brand sauce. I only needed 1 cup and layered the sauce on the bottom piece of bread and then the meatballs and cheese on top. Easy and delicious.

Easy as it gets :)...Now for the time and easiness of it, I give this a 5. I followed directions exactly except used the whole jar of sauce since I love sauce. Did the mozzarella but may try provologne next time heated in the oven. But original recipe was great. Will definitely do again.

Super easy and good. I used turkey meatballs and added some garlic and spices to the mix. Def something I would make again for a quick weeknight dinner.
