I liked this recipe. It is a nice alternative to other warm spinach salads. The amount of bacon and dressing that you end up making is actually quite a lot so you can probably increase the amount of spinach. Since it's turkey bacon, the meat never really gets crispy but I suppose that's what the croutons are for.

I didn't care much for this salad.  I found the recipe to be boring.  I added more vegetables, red peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers for variety.  The dressing was OK, if I make it again, I would cut down on the mustard a bit.

Had a spinach salad years ago at a Shaker restaurant in New Harmony, IN that was fabulous!  I have been searching for a similar recipe ever since and this is so-o-o close and so delicious!!  It has become a family favorite fast!!
