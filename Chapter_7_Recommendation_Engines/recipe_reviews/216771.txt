Not bad, but I'm thinking this could benefit by adding more cheese (or less cream).  Also, our heat tolerance level being "Coward," I backed off on the jalapeno quite a bit and added finely chopped mixed color bell peppers.

I doubled this recipe and it ended up with too much liquid.  I also ended up doubling the cook time and the potatoes were still not as done as I would have liked.  The flavor was delicious and I will try again but either make the smaller portion or cut the liquid and plan on cooking at a little higher heat and for longer than recipe calls for.

This was very good!  I made a few changes...I used fat free half and half as another reviewer suggested.  I also added one small chopped onion.  I didn't seed my jalepenos and this became a super-spicy dish but that's how we like it!  Easy, quick and tasty!

This recipe is a great side for a steak. Some adjustments you can make are trimming the amount of Jalapenos you use, or substituting Swiss for Gruyere. Sometimes if there are kids eating this dish, I do half with Jalapenos, and half without. This dish is very versatile.

Great recipe. I made it for Easter this afternoon and everyone loved it. I probably gave the recipe to 5 other people. 

The next time I make it I think I may chop an onion and put it in with the peppers. Possibly a little crumbled bacon, too.

This was great. A very nice side dish with a little zip.  Not too spicy but good flavor.

I give this five, because it is the first potato cheese gratin I have ever attempted that has not come out runny. We used Swiss and didn't like it, so we will be switching to cheddar or a cheddar-gruyere combo and not looking back. Also, my casserole took more than 1 1/2 hours to cook well. And I could of used more generous salt between the layers. With or without the jalapenos; good either way.

I don't know what happened but this turned out not to my liking.  I followed the instructions to a T and it was a complete fail.

I would like to try this again, but maybe increase the cheese and cream.  I thought they were just a little bland.

I've made several other recipes along this line but I got rave reviews across the board with this one.  Everyone said this was the best potato dish yet. That's saying a lot. I made the recipe exactly as written and won't change a thing the next time I make it. Gruyere and jalapeños. Yum!!

I made this twice. First, I made it for 90-people community dinner. I used cheddar and Anaheim chilies. It was a huge hit! A lot requested servings to take home and many came up to me to compliment it. The second time I made it at home for myself. Was not a fan of the combo of gruyere and jalepeños at all! The Anaheims had better flavor and better paired up with cheddar. I realize the difference in cheese and addition of peppers sets this apart from traditional, but having made it 2 times so close together (2days apart), I feel confident with my conclusion. I love the ingredients and thought this was going to be fabulous; unfortunately, as presented here, I was disappointed. We all have different tastes and this wasn't horrible. I mean no offense to the original poster if the recipe.

This is awesome!!  I used only 2 jalpenos and the flavor was great but not too hot!  I made this for a pot luck and everyone wanted the recipe.
