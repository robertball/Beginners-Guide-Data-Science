Sorry, but I don't think this makes a serving; if you double it, yes.  This was OK, but you did get a little bit of an aftertaste from the Truvia simple syrup.  But it certainly was imbibed without complaints from anybody!

This was a delicious (AND low carb) version of a margarita!  I didn't notice an after taste from the Stevia.  We did like the drinks better blended than on the rocks.
