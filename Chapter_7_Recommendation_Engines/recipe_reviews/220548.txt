This is a nice recipe however I suggest cooking the leeks and adding the flour to the leeks to cook off the raw taste of the flour for a few minutes before adding the broth etc...   I had to use white skinned potatoes which were fine.  I imagine that you could even use left over mashed potatoes to make this.  It is very filling and makes for a good cool weather meal.

Worked out very well.  Used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth (to appease the vegetarian in the house) and used milk instead of half & half (because that's all I had in the fridge).  Very good dish and my first use of leeks ever.

As the recipe is written I think it would have turned out to be more like mashed potatoes than soup.  Half a teaspoon of dill was too strong, 1/4 tsp might taste better.  I ended up using 4 cups of broth and 1 leek.

I made this recipe and didn't like it. It was bland and I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I will not be making this one again.

Good thick soup.  Mine turned out more like mashed potatoes rather than soup, but the flavor was good.  I made the recipe as written.
