I chose this recipe for my son's International Week at school.  His class was studying Australia and he wanted an Australian dish for the potluck.  When you are baking these cookies, the wonderful aroma just permeates throughout the whole house.  And they taste wonderful too!

I wanted a fairly simple and quick cookie recipe to bake and give as a hostess gift.  This recipe fit the bill, but I did not get 50 cookies.  Maybe I was too generous with the dough.  Nonetheless, these are terrific.  They almost melt in your mouth and are wonderful with coffee, tea or hot chocolate.
I didn't have pitted dates on hand so I increased the raisins and chopped walnuts.
Next time I'll use dates also.
Watch the baking time!  8-minutes was all it took.
