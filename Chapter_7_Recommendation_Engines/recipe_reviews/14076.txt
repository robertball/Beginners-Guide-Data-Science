I loved this recipe and my boyfreind as well. He is a huge sweet bread fan. I used the recipe for portuguese sweet bread for the bread machine, that I got from this website.  A definite keeper.

Made this recipe with Italian Pandoro and it was wonderful. Had bread pudding consistency in dish 
and toasted on top. It was the hit of our Christmas Eve brunch. Easy to make, but has a sophisticated flavor. We cut the Pan d'oro in half vertically, then in 1/2" slices horizontally. Laid them in the glass dish at 45/angle. Pretty presentation. Smells great when it cooks. High awe factor. Don't overbake. Make sure this delicate dish doesn't burn.

This is good, but next time I'll lay the bread pieces out on a single layer and bake on a sheet pan.  The stacking made the "connected" parts *very* soggy.  I used freshly-baked Portuguese sweet bread from the site and next time I need to use not-so-fresh bread.

This is so very good.  It reminds me of a bread pudding.  I like to use thick slices of bread and omit the butter on top. It seems to come out a little more crispy on top which is the way we prefer it and nice and custard like in the middle. So good,you have to try it.

This recipe was wonderful...I made it for company the first time and it was a huge hit.  The Portuguese massa (sweet bread) really gives it a special flavor and texture.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks

This was great! I added some chocolate chips to the layers and it turned out great.    This could probably serve 8-10 people since it is so rich and heavy.  Since there are only two of us, we have been reheating it and it's still great!

This turned out really well.  I made it with the Portugese Bread from the bread machine recipe here, and the consistency was perfect.  Light, not soggy at all, with a very nice flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it.

I followed the recipe, and half the bread was emerged in the mixture, half was sticking up, but it was still gross to have half mushy bread. Won't make this again.

I made my own portuguese sweet bread from scratch. I assumed that the casserole was meant to make the night before so that the bread could really soak up all the egg mixture overnight--that's what I did. I served this with homemade maple vanilla syrup. For us, the flavor was good but we didn't care for the mushy texture of the casserole. I would make this again but I would cook the french toast in the skillet in the butter instead.

this was fantastic! i made it twice... once with 2 day old Portuguese sweet bread and once with 3 week old sweet bread. Both times were great! As other reviews said, bake it in a single layer on a cookie sheet. The 2nd batch i made with the older dryer bread I put in a casserole dish and let soak over night, then baked in a single layer. everyone loved it both times.

Pretty good.  It's French Toast with a personality disorder . . .the bottom is like a custard and bread pudding French Toast as others have said, and the top is crusty and toast like, similar to pan fried French Toast. If you don't like a crusty top, I'd recommend covering it; if you don't like custard like French Toast, I'd recommend laying it flat as others have done instead of stacking.  It's actually pretty good; hubs and I ate our portions today with syrup and fruit on the side.  This makes a lot of French Toast; we have enough for leftovers to toss in the freezer, but I flipped the remainder and put back in the oven so it will freeze okay--I'm thinking the custard part won't be so good in the freezer.  I halved the recipe and still got 4 servings.  I didn't use Portuguese bread for this; used a Christmas bread my godparents send us every year that has been hanging out in the freezer just waiting for recipes like this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Took other reviewers advice and increased sugar to half a cup and added one extra egg yolk. I baked at 350° for 20 minutes and an 8 inch round pan. Turned out fabulous didn't last long in our house. Can't wait to make it again.

The folks who are down rating this recipe are, I think, expecting it to make classic French toast.  What it actually makes a kind of bread custard.  And as such it is EXCELLENT.  I fix it for special occasions like Thanksgiving or Christmas breakfast, and we love it.  Be sure to submerge all the bread in the milk mixture and put it in the fridge overnight before baking.
