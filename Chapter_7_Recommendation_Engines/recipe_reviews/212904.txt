I made this tonight, and everyone was very full after nearly half a bowl! The only negative is that it was very sweet. Maybe half the molasses and leave out the honey next time. Also needed salt.

I don’t think I have ever made such an ingredient full recipe. I halved the recipe and it still made my 5 quart pot full.  Kitchen sink accurately fits. Good flavor, but a little too sweet. Not a spice or herb in it. Sodium content is out of bounds and this would feed way more than 18 people. I just don’t see a need for all those extra beans and meats in a nice bean soup. Instead of butter frying the limas they could be added a little before the others to cook in the mix. I'm sorry, but I can't see myself making this again. Thanks anyway.

I am giving this 4 stars because my husband loved this. It was an awful lot of work for what tasted like your average bean soup with a twist. Very sweet, almost too sweet for me. I will make this again, with less sweetness. If it was just up to me I would not put all the effort into it for the taste. It is not bad but just tastes like bean soup really.  It makes a huge amount so start with a very large pan, and don't worry by the time it's done it will fill it. So be prepared, I had to change pans half way thru, start large and be prepared to watch it grow. My husband absolutely loved this soup, maybe it's a guy thing.  Thanks for a stick to your ribs meal.

4 stars cuz i thought it was a soup recipie, it took along time and i almost grew outta the pot i  was using!!! And what the heck are Fordfork limas?  I can't even find 'em on google!  Other review helped..i omitted the honey and added salt and Emeril's Essence.  Not a big green pepper fan so only used 1/2 of one. I sauted my onion, carrots, celery and 1.5 teas. of minced garlic before adding the non-Fordfork limas!  Next time i will add Market Day brand roasted corn and pepper blend cuz i will use a huge caldron.  We have enough for several days and they are really really good! A keeper on my regular recipe list!
