This is the best liver pate!!! It is truly the perfect combination of ingredients, and the pistachio nuts enhance it's amazing flavor even more! I know of many other people who have tried this recipe & it remains the top pick & favorite of them all. This recipe gets all the raves & compliments that are well deserved! You would be hard-pressed to find a more perfect liver pate than this! Your dish will be the only one empty at all the parties with this recipe! P.S. - you better have recipe cards ready... because everyone will want it after trying this perfect pate! It's a winner!

Truely yummy.  I wanted something less artificial tasting so I chopped 1/2 onion and 7 garlic gloves and cooked them with wine and the livers.  Outstanding!

The pate was delicious. I would suggest using additional pistachios left whole and divide the mixture into small chafing dishes for serving before refrigerating.

This pate is the BEST pate I've ever had.  The only change was that I sauteed an onion in the butter on low heat for about 30 minutes before adding the liver and fresh garlic.  I used organic chicken liver and organic onion bullion.  I also substituted cooking sherry for the wine.  Even if you don't like liver, you'll love this!

This was a good recipe and the pate tasted great.  I was a little nervous because the picture turned me off a little but tried it anyway, glad I did!  I did everything to the same but squeezed a little pate on a cracker for a nice presentation.

Absolutely delicious! No more store-bought for me. I used real onion and garlic instead of the powdered. Used 1/3 cup of wine, 95% fat-free cream cheese. Butter-flavoured margarine instead of butter. I served this after only chilling for almost two hours; I think overnight would be best, but it still tasted amazing. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe for my first pate.  I also used fresh red onion and fresh garlic.  It firmed up well, and was just divine.  A++

I had "Beefy" Onion soup mix and used that. I found i did Not need to add onion powder or garlic powder. I could not stop eating this pate and my neighbor wanted the recipe after I gave her some!
