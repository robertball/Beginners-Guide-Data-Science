WOW - very good and easy.  I would agree with a previous reviewer that this is a keeper - we always have the ingredients in the pantry.  My 4yr old and 2 yr old even loved it.  Next time I will cook up some red onions with the chicken and BBQ sauce.

Simple and delicious dinner. I changed a few things but didn't stray far. To make it even healthier I used egg substitute and instead of the oil I used cooking spray. I also added hot sauce and 1/2 an onion, chopped. It was perfect. Will be making this again.

This recipe was so simple to make and came out delicious! The only thing I did differently was add a little more of the bisquick mix on the bottom. It really fluffed up and served as a nice stuffing with the chicken! Definitely plan on making it again!
