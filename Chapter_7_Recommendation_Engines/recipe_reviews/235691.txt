I followed the recipe's ingredients but started them out in an aluminum foil hot pack. I roasted the pack on the grill over medium heat turning every 5 minutes, for 15 minutes. I also thinly sliced the garlic knowing they would toast nicely in the olive oil. I transferred the contents into a medium bowl then added the lemon juice, additional oil, and cheese; pre-grated Romano in the green plastic shaker, but that did the trick. Fantastic!

So yummy! Wish I would have cooked more. I added asparagus in with the broccoli. I did end up pulling them out of the oven at 15 min but I had chopped them up pretty small to begin with. Will definitely make this again, even my 8 yr old daughter loved them.

I've also tried this recipe without lemon juice and added Panko bread crumbs, and I loved it even more.

This is the best broccoli I've ever had and my family loves it. I've made it multiple times now.  I use 2 heads of broccoli and so I double the recipe. I place the ingredients  in a large ziplock bag, add my cut up broccoli and shake it around a few times so everything's coated, easy peasy. I like cooking it a few extra minutes because I love the crunchy dark parts that form on the broccoli- delish! I usually just do a quick once over sprinkling of lemon juice once done, not a lot,  and use the fancy shredded Parmesan cheese. You won't be disappointed!

This a great recipe if you like all the ingredients.  I added 10cloves of garlic with 2 heads of broccoli.  I especially liked it cold,raw and marinating in the olive oil and garlic, salt.

Good recipe. The broccoli got a little brown while baking but other than that turned out well.

Very easy, and I thought it was tasty but hubs was "indifferent".  I seriously got that answer, so I guess he didn't love it but didn't hate it either.  I only put a little bit of lemon juice in it, but maybe that was his issue.  Not sure, but I love the roasting method so maybe I'll make this again without the lemon juice and see if that makes him happy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! That one word about sums this up. What a simple, yet deliciously tasty dish. My only regret was that I hadn't made more -- at the end of dinner this dish had been completely polished off, leaving no leftovers.

Tried this recipe to bring to a Thanksgiving gathering.  I loved it and so did everyone else.  Easy to make, doesn't take a lot of time, and  smells amazing while it's cooking.

Will use a lot - matter of fact taking it to my office pot luck Christmas lunch!

My new favorite go to veggie recipe. Tonight I added cauliflower to the broccoli and it worked just as well. My 10 year old son has seconds of this every time I make it.

Super fast, easy to put together and very tasty. Any recipe that has the family coming back for seconds of their vegetables is a hit in my book. Shared with my parents and they loved it too.

I thought it was just okay.  I will probably make again, but without the lemon juice.  I found it to be pretty tart and odd with the cheese.  I did test the broccoli before adding the lemon juice and thought it was very good!

I may never steam broccoli again. I had to adjust the temp in order to coordinate another part of the meal that also required oven time: chicken recipe needed 1 hr+  at 375, and this recipe wanted 425 for 20+ min. Hmmm. I compromised by setting the oven at 400, putting the chicken in for 30 min, then added the broccoli for another 30 min. This caused a little charring on the veggies (I added red bell pepper), which was delicious! Next time, I will just roast the veggies by themselves, but will watch the roast to make sure I get this yummy char again.

Very delicious! I made it for myself and my dad and we both loved it. We added a handful of unsalted pecan chunks to it and it gave it a nice occasional crunch

Fantastic!  I omitted the lemon juice (was serving with halibut already marinated in lemon juice & EVOO, plus lemon butter), tossed other ingredients into a ziplock and added broccoli to coat.  Spread broccoli on a sheet pan and roasted for 18 minutes.  Turned oven off, sprinkled w/cheese and popped back into oven for additional melting.  Superb!

This was delicious!  I doubled the garlic and sliced it instead of mincing.  I also only used 1 tsp of lemon juice.  Next time I will reduce the cook time to 15 minutes.

An ideal recipe for anyone who does not like broccoli!  They may not know they have eaten it as the dish is so full of flavour.  The only change I made was with the Parmesan cheese.  I guess the make you mention is American.  I used no-name found in Canada, as that is all we have.

Really good recipe, I used double the amount of garlic and no lemon juice. Also instead of Parmigiano I used sheep cheese, so an entirely different recipe, but still delicious !

This is now my wife’s favorite way to eat broccoli.  Didn’t have lemon on hand so one time was without it... just as good and my wife said she liked it better without.

We all enjoyed this recipe. My kids were unsure but after a couple of bites they liked it very much.

Very good.  My college age daughter said she doesn't usually like broccoli, but this was very good!  I followed the recipe, and added some cauliflower, too.

This turned out well. I found it tasty. My husband, however, wouldn’t eat it nor would my toddler (who LOVES broccoli) So I took one star off for each of them. While my toddler couldn’t quite verbalize his dislike my husband said it was too tart. Perhaps if I had returned it to the oven for a few after tossing it in the lemon juice? I probably won’t be making this again because I have other broccoli recipes that they prefer.

This turned out great! It’s super easy. I used minced garlic  instead of cloves and cut down on the lemon juice and it turned out perfectly.

A little salty, otherwise good. I used grated Parmesan which baked with the broccoli and it stuck well in the tiers of the broccoli.

Just made it for the first time.  Family loved it. A little garlic goes a long way, though.  Twenty minutes was enough if pieces are small.  Made this with roasted sweet potatoes and slices of fully cooked ham I heated in the microwave. Quick, easy, delicious dinner.

Followed recipe exactly except added red peppers and 4 garlic cloves instead of 2. Family loved it and will definitely make this again. Very simple and delicious. Served with some nice T-bone steaks for an iron rich meal.

I added mozzarella cheese balls throughout recipe. My boyfriend just had & said it was the best broccoli he ever had. Instead I added dashes of Lemmon juice & douced in parmision cheese. Paired with steak tips & mashed potatoes. Better than any restaurant around us!! I will be making again. So good!!!

Excellent!  A nice new and exciting way to serve broccoli.  I'm already a fan of roasted veggies and this takes it up a level.  We topped with some roasted pine nuts at the end.  A big hit!  Thanks!!!!

Easy to make, very tasty with good flavor & crunch. I did omit the lemon juice as I used this as a side with Chicken & Shrimp Fettucine Alfredo and I didn't think the lemon juice would pair well. But will definitely try that addition with a different meal.

This was delicious. I wanted something besides plain old steamed broccoli and this recipe fit the bill. I just estimated all the measurements so I can't say that I made it exactly as described.  I did include everything and it turned out quite well. My wife and mother in law loved it too!

This was wonderful one dish meal for a meat free evening supper.  I loved it. One small addition was a little soft organic goat cheese instead of parmesan just for something different.  However goats or parmesan are delicious .

This recipe is a huge hit with my family! My husband requests it regularly and I've shared the recipe with my parents and siblings. Everyone loves it!
