Wow! This is really great, tastes just like what you would get at a restaurant.  I removed the pulp and seeds from the tomatoes and used dried basil.  Used red onion and used 2 tbsp oil and 1 tbsp balsamic. I also think kalamta olives would be tasty.This is superb and makes a great snack.

Made a wonderful, tasty and healthy appetizer. I followed the recipe exactly and thought the portions came out very generous. I served on thinly sliced italian bread that I sprayed lightly with an olive oil spray and toasted in the oven.
