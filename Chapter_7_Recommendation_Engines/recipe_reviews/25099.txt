Very good, although like almost everything I make, I modified the recipe a bit.  Instead of using the egg whites I used one whole egg, I increased the oatmeal and reduced the flour a bit.  I also added more chocolate chips.  I got almost 3 dozen cookies using heaping teaspoons full.  It's kind of a flat cookie. It's also a crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside cookie. THX

These were great with the changes I made. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the shortening, raw sugar instead of white, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 white flour, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 whole eggs,  2 TBSP creamy peanut butter, and an extra half cup of oatmeal.

These cookies were fabulous! The whole family loved them. They turned out chewy-soft and delicious. I did use two whole eggs instead of just the whites and regular sized chocolate chips.(about 3/4's cup) I also made the cookies larger and got about 3 dozen yummy cookies from the recipe. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Remember people - it's nutritional value PER SERVING; the reason it appears to be so low in fat is because it claims to make 100 cookies, one hundred from this amount of ingredients... I don't think so - - maybe 36?

I thought these were really good. To get the full amount of cookies they have to be pretty small, but that was okay since I'm doing Weight Watchers. I only needed a few to fill a craving, so I used half the dough and let my daughter make a mess with the other half. We baked it anyway, and daddy ate the whole pan. :)

Don't let the "low-fatness" of this recipe disuade you from trying it. My husband (who incidentally hates anything labeled diet or low fat) scarfed these babies down like a goblin. Maybe someone should tell him that when you eat 30 at a time they cease to be low fat.

I love the texture of these cookies!!!  Although, I added a TON more chocolate chips than it called for (maybe about 1.5 or 2 cups total) because my roommates are all about the chocolate.  I guess it's not really that low fat with all that chocolate, but they sure were tasty!!! Thanks for the great recipe Allison!

These cookies turned out great!! They stayed soft for a long time afterward.  I added extra oatmeal and a little less flour because when I followed the original recipe you couldn't taste the oatmeal much.  I didn't even get close to 100 cookies even when I made them very small.  Overall they are excellent and I have already made them many times!

Great recipe! I found I needed 10 minutes to cook them properly. I also used 2 eggs, and more chocolate chips(1 cup). Thanks

Oh my yummy, chewy goodness!  Wonderful recipe!  I cooked exactly as directed and they turned out so good.  I took them out of the oven when they barely started browning on the edges.  At first I thought I undercooked them, but it turned out that they were perfect.  I loved that the oatmeal was not overpowering.  I used large chocolate chips because that's what I had.  I think minis might be better because there's not a lot of chocolate compared to regular choc chip recipes and it could "spread out" the chocolate flavor better.  Are these really low fat?  They sure don't taste it.  This is my new favorite cookie recipe.  I don't think I'll ever make regular choc chip cookies again.

I really liked this recipe but I changed it a bit.  I used 1/4c butter and 1/4c applesauce.  And 1/3c white sugar and 1/3c brown sugar.  I also used 1c flour and 1 1/4c oats. I cooked them for 10 min and they were nice and chewy inside.  My husband didn't even know they were better for him.  They were gone in 2 days. I would have given it 5 stars but I changed some of the recipe.

these are more like chocolate chip cookies with oatmeal, rather than oatmeal cookies with chocolate chips in it, if that makes sense. if you are looking for a more hearty oatmeal cookie don't use this recipe. but i loved them and they taste fantastic! :)

These cookies were not the best i made a few the size of teaspoons and some half teaspoons and i did'nt get even 50. And after they baked they were paper thin. Yeah of course they're gonna be 35 calories if their that small!!! they taste reasonable, the texture is not very good though.

These cookies are amazing! They were the best snack ever!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing I would change is put them in the oven for less time. I put it in for the time it said and they turned out HARD... nut nothing a piece of fresh bread can't fix. I put the piece of bread in at night and when I got up the cookies were so yummy and soft!!!!! This is one of the best chocolate chip recipe EVER! 

You rock ALISON!!!!!! Mmmmmmmmmmm

My changes: All whole wheat flour, reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup (still VERY sweet in my opinion), used one egg, reduced butter (used instead of shortening) to 6T and used 3T of applesauce, eliminated water, added 1/4 c ground flax, increased oats to 3/4 c.  The result was a flat, delicious, moist, chewy cookie.

sooooo good!  I used one whole egg and it seemed to work fine.  I'm not sure if my oven in acting up but I had to cook them longer than it says...i just kept an eye on them.  But they are chewy in the middle and crunchy on the outside!  Soo good!!

These cookies were pretty good. I used 1 1/4 cup  whole wheat flour and 1 cup of oatmeal.  They are nice and chewy on the inside. And I just used butter instead of butter flavored shortening, guess they're not low fat.

The taste of this recipe was indeed fabulous but the cookie spread out too thin while baking. I don't know why some CC cookies recipes do that but I prefer a cookie which has more form to it. I also felt it did not have enough chocolate chips so I doubled the amount called for and still the cookies didn't seem to have enough cc's.  (when one half the cookie has no chips in it, that's not enough for me.)  Overall, this was a great cookie though, if taste is what counts.  FYI - I used half splenda in the sugar and 1 cup of oat flour instead of all-purpose. The other 3/4 was whole wheat flour.  I also added 1/4 cup of chop pecans.

Not the absolute best oatmeal cookie I have ever had, but they are very good nonetheless, and they are a bit lower in fat. You can make them with some whole wheat flour too.

I was disappointed w/ this recipe. I have a wonderful chocolate chip recipe, but wanted to make something healthier. It tasted OK but the oatmeal was almost non-existant here. I'll try again sometime, but reduce the flour to approx. 1 c. & increase the oatmeal 1 1/3 c. and maybe add a little applesauce or vanilla yoghurt so it's not too dry (I've done this w/ all sorts of baking w/ a great deal of success).

FIANLY a baking success! All my previous attempts at baking all turned into disasters BUT THIS WAS PERFECT. Like another reviewer I added extra chocolate but I didn’t have any chocolate chips on hand so I chopped up a few chocolate bars and added some extra chocolate on the top of the cookies to let them melt then harden. (So much for low-fat.I think I increased the calories to 900 per cookie LOL) but nevertheless followed the recipe exactly (Which was probably what I should have been doing all along with my previous baking ;)) and these are the best cookies I have ever had. They are soooo moist and melt in your mouth.  Even my Greek husband who is VERY picky couldn’t stop eating these. Next time I think I will put raisins instead of chocolate so I don’t feel toooo guilty!!! Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe. I have regained confidence in baking and I am feeling like a domestic goddess today! :D

This is a wonderful recipe! I am a cookie monster, and was looking for a friend on a heart healthy diet that was missing her morning cookies. She loved them, and so did my husband who hates anything low fat and CC chip cookies are his favs. I did everything like the recipe reads, but added 1/4 cup extra  C.chips. I only got 65 cookies and they were 1/2 dollare size, I could not imagin how small they would have to be to get 100 cookies like it say's. The best low fat, low cal., no cholesterol cookie I have found thus far. Thanks

Very yummy! But it was quite watery -- needed to add more flour, and more oats. Makes about 60-70 if very small.

I just made it. i gave it a 4 because, i found it a little too sweet.Maybe  the white sugar should have been 3/4cup. The oatmeal should have been more which I added and the flour should have been 1.5 cups. All in all it was good, it came out crispy. The bake time is exactly 8 minutes. will bake again with the changes. thank you for the recipe.

Added butterscotch chips. Baked for 9 minutes. Put a piece of bread in ziplock bag to keeps cookies moist:)

This was a great recipe I don't know if it was my fault or not but I found they stuck to the sheet even after the first batch and I added a little grease ? I used 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 cup extra oats I think I would even add a little more oats next time . I also used flax meal instead of eggs I am vegan it worked fine . Very sweet treat

This was a great recipe. I used coconut oil instead of shortening. I also used whole wheat flour. The baking soda was a little too strong the first time so I only added half the second time and they were perfect! Kids and adults loved them. Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Cut the recipe in half because I didn't want too many cookies... I used about 1 1/2 egg white instead for the half recipe, also used whole wheat flour (1/2 cup) and grinded up oats (1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons) as a substitute for white flour. I also used organic cane sugar instead of white. I also used regular butter to reduce the amount of processed food. Transformed the cookies to healthier and less processed cookies! Yummy! :)

Best cookie I have had in a while!
Most of my cookies spread but these dont;they are like cookies from heaven.
They're pretty too.
Soft and moist in the inside, crunchy on the outside. My new favorite recipe.
Make these!!!!!!

I've already ate 7!!

This was a very good tasting cookie recipe. However, there were a couple problems with it in my opinion. I'm completely new to this cooking thing, so take it as you will.

1. The cookies spread out way too much. This left them kinda crunchy on the outside and lifeless. I prefer mine with more shape.

2. There wasn't enough oatmeal. It tasted more like sugar (probably because of the sugar amount being greater than the oatmeal). It tasted good, just not what I was looking for.

3. Because the cookies spread out so much, they tended to fall apart when I was trying to take them off the cookie sheet.

Overall, a good recipe. Though I will probably look for another that is more attuned to my tastes.

Ah, so-so. Came out kind of cakey. Tasted good--I was just looking for a different texture.

Not bad, the flavor is decent but they are too chewy.

Delicious!  I only had Quick Oats and they worked fine.  Note that my batch only made about 35 cookies, and they weren't even that big.  Definitely not a lowfat taste.
