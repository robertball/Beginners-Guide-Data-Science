This is one of our all time favorites.  Tastes like a shortbread cookie.  Helpful Tip:  I keep an eye on this while it is cooking as my oven cooks unevenly.  If the edges are browning before the middle is finished, I cover the edges with foil and use a toothpick in the center to check doneness.

Make this recipe in a 10x15 inch pan and cook for 25 - 30 minutes, and it turns out very well.  This delicious cookie is a favorite of my family.  The red and green candies with drizzled white frosting make this a pretty cookie that is easy to decorate.

This was a holiday mess!  They were over done on the other edges, and underdone in the middle.

Had my son pick out the red and green coloured mini 'chocolates' while I prepared the dough. Baked these much longer to cook the 'middle' but still it was kinda gooey while the edges were becoming overcooked. A hit at the family Christmas tho and will make again.

I got this recipe from my mother-in-law.  She uses red cherries only, does not chop the chocolate candies, and bakes them in a jelly roll pan.  They look beautiful and taste great!

What a simple, tasty treat! The only bad thing was that it took forever to bake at the recommended heat, since I'm at high altitude; next time, I'll try it about 25' hotter. On the other hand, the slow baking ensured that it baked evenly all the way through - no gooshy middle. Another idea (specifically for the holidays) is to use just red or red and green candy pieces, to make it look more appealing; one of the other reviews for this was right - the multi-colored candy shells makes them look funky.  By the way, if you have a mixer, use it! Mixing this by hand takes a lot out of your muscles.

This short-bread type bar is excellent. It's hard to really describe - but it's great. I took it to a gathering of diverse individuals and everybody loved it!!

A definite do-over and very pretty too!  I followed the directions exactly and I did not have any problems.  The bars cooked evenly.  I would think in a larger pan they would be extremely flat---almost cracker like.
I tinted my glaze red.

It just is not the holidays without these yummy cookie bars.  A family friend has been making these for over twenty years and I started making them last year.  It is fun and sticky to make but well worth it.  A wonderful holiday tradition for the family.

I made these for Xmas and I loved them.  They were ugly but they tasted awesome.  I think the fruit and chocolate thing deterred people from trying them but once they did they really liked them.  If I make them again, I think I will try to conceal the m & m 's a little better.

Its the middle of July and I had box of candied cherries, so what do I do???  Made this wonderful recipe and omitted the M&Ms. Instead I sprinkled sliced almonds on top and added almond flavoring to glaze.  So very good!!!

I make this every year. Quadruple recipe, with white chocolate or royal icing glaze. They are perfect every time.

Great tasting - like shortbread.  Too much icing (only used half).  Also used vanilla extra instead of almond due to allergies.  Kids loved it too!

I used a pastry roller to flatten the dough into an even depth all around, and I didn't have any trouble with burnt edges. Second batch I took out the green cherries, and used crushed candy canes sprinkled on top. Looked great, and tasted delicious!

Absolutely gorgeous cookie bar!(and delicious).... I did NOT chop up the mini M&M's, only used red/green (obviously) haha.  It DID take a long time to bake at 300, it probably took a good 37 minutes. Keep and eye on it, don't let edges get brown! I'm about ready to ice them, but I will definitely be making these EVERY Christmas!!!

I love this recipe.  Have been making it for years.  During a move, I lost it.  Thank you so much for posting it.  Can't wait to make it again.
