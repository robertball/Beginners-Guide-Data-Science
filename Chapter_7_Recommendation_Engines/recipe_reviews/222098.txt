I didn't make the crust as stated. Used 2 - 8" graham cracker crusts as I didn't want to take the time to make my own crust. I used fresh black berries instead of rasberries as that is what I had. Still came out great - restaurant quality taste. I wasn't so great at layering the berry sauce or making pretty designs in the cake (I"ll have to practice) but the cake(s) set nicely and didn't burn,  at 325F for an hour, even without the water bath.

This was a really great recipe! I used graham crackers as well for the crust and it certainly didn't hurt the flavor. I used light butter and splenda for 1/2 cup of sugar (the rest I used real sugar), and it was still really good!

This was delicious!  I was not able to refrigerate it for 8 hours, so it stuck to the knife a little bit.  One of the 3 packs was low-fat cream cheese and it was fine.  I created more work for less sweetness by only melting one cup of the white chips into the batter.  I separately melted dark chocolate and added a little extra milk so I could swirl it in with the raspberry sauce.  Also I used pre-crushed graham cracker crumbs instead of the chocolate cookies for the crust.
