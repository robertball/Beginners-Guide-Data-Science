I'm an expirenced cook, and after looking at this recipie I couldn't figure out how it could possible work and taste good.  I was wrong.  These are awesome!  They are not as chocolaty as I normally make, but they are only 1/3 the calories as my usual batch.  I glazed them with a simple to glaze to make them richer, and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipie, I will definatly make these again

Wowie Zowie!  I didn't believe that low-fat brownies could be, well, good.  You have proved me wrong, Anna.  I made two changes:
1.  I substituted 2 ounces of the semi-sweet chocolate for unsweetened (actually makes them lower in fat, plus the hubby and I like a really dark taste when it comes to chocolate); 
2.  Added a simple, thin frosting of 1 tbsp. butter, 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate, 1 tsp. powdered sugar and a tsp. of fat-free milk
Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!  I will definitely make this again and again!

These were very good!  They had a consistency that was a little bit thicker than cake and a moderately sweet chocolate flavor.  I'll definitely be making them again.

For those concerned with portion control, I recommend using a muffin/cupcake pan.  I did this and they turned out just fine.

When making a recipe like this, one must always keep in mind what the title and the ingredients are, and what they are intended for.  These are, of course, not going to be as good as the butter rich, fudgy brownies that we all dream about.  But for what they are, these are pretty decent brownies.  One thing they do have is a rich, chocolatey flavor.  They are moist, but not really fudgy.  I baked 1/2 of the batter in a mini muffin pan and drizzled those with vanilla glaze.  Then I had enough for a small pan as well.  I cut those, topped with light cool whip, and some leftover raspberry sauce.  Now that was good.

First, let me say I made a few changes. I used milk instead of water, about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 2 eggs instead of 4 whites (I only had 2 eggs on hand). That said, this was a very good recipe. They weren't as good as regular brownies, of course, but for being lower in fat than regular brownies these were great. The batter was very thin, and I was a bit worried, but they cooked up nicely. I will definitely make these again!

These brownies turned out nice and moist! However, they need a bit more chocolate to them so next time I will add more chocolate and a bit less sugar. I also substituted half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour just to add a bit of nutrition!

yum, these brownies are good! for some reason i needed to baked mine for almost 30 minutes. the edges baked up fine & pulled away from the 8" pan however the center never set. i layered chunks of the baked brownie with cherry pie filling & cool whip (both "lite") in wine glasses for my valentine. this recipe should've earned 5 stars for taste & the presentation but seeing what i could not use the middle gives this 4 stars. thanks anna!

These are incredible and so easy to make! I used chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. Took about 30 min. in my oven. We like them better than the high calorie brownies we've made.

Good but not great.  Lots of other brownie recipes are much better.  tasted much better the next day.  I truly don't understand the 5 star ratings given by others.   5 stars should be for the best!

Sorry to be negative, but these were terrible.  Very cakey, lacking chocolately flavor.  Tastes like something my daughter would make in her easy bake oven.

Love them, with a few slight modifications. I almost doubled the amount of chocolate, probably to about 10 ounces (I used chocolate chips). Than I added about a teaspoon of instant coffee to the chocolate chips once they were melted. Than I put them in cupcake pans so they would cook evenly and be nice serving size.

Excellent recipe, very easy.  The brownies are very light & airy - nice texture. Change to baking time: after 25 minutes, the center was still very gooey, so I reduced temp to 300 & let them bake for another 40 minutes. Edges firm, but not hard and center cooked through.

I am sorry, but these weren't that good.  I knew I wasn't going to get a ooey-gooey fudgy brownie...but these came out like a spongy-airy german chocolate cake.  I did add a couple Tablespoons of mini chocolate chips to the batter...and when they were done...the chips sunk to the bottom of the brownie.   I had to put fudge frosting on these to pass them off to my family!  I can eat anything chocolate, but these didn't come out like I had expected!

These were unfortunately pretty tasteless and dry. I think if I were to try them again, I would probably add some apple sauce.

I changed this recipe up a bit. Use 1/3 cup all purpose flour and 1/3 cup whole wheat flour-1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup splenda-1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips. I totally space out the pinch of salt, whoops.  I divided them into a mini muffin and cooked them for about 15 min. I sprinkled a bit of sea salt on top and let them cool. They came out awesome!!

These are good!  I used 2 whole eggs & 2 egg whites.  I also put pecans in them.  It reminds me of a Wacky cake my mom used to make in the 50s-70s...as thee

This a dieters dream come true!!!! I have been looking for a chocolate cake/brownie recipe that could satisfy my chocolate sweet tooth and be low in fat and calories and still deliver flavor. This certainly did...Mine baked for 30 minutes and were perfect. If you wanted a more fudgy brownie taste, pop in the refrigerator, then cut into bars. I have one a day (sometimes 2) and it doesn't wreck havoc with my weight. These are a must to try for those that watch calories and fat!

They are very moist but they dont have much taste to them! Maybe some chocolate ice cream to go with them would be perfect!
