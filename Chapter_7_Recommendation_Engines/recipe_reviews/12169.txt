All 5 stars plus more.  This was a fantastic recipe. And I do mean fantastic.  Just the right amount of sweetness & buttery taste.  Will do this one many more times to come.  Made adjustments: roasted walnuts; use 1/2 c. karo, and 1/4 c. 100% maple syrup.  I think that is what made the difference.  Again fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Turned out beautifully, much like a pecan pie.  I substituted a little maple syrup for some of the corn syrup and loved the aroma while cooking.  I had to bake mine an extra 25 minutes.

The second time I made this I added an extra egg.  This decreased the cooking time and I didn't need extra time in the oven.

This was so easy to make, and while we did enjoy it, we agreed it would have been better with a combination of walnuts and pecans. Served it with Ambrosia custard. Not bad at all. Thanks!

I going to add one more 5 star review to this delicious pie. It's FANTASTIC! I did switch dark corn syrup for the light corn syrup and I like the added depth of flavor. I read a lot of the reviews that said they used maple syrup and I can totally see that happening and being really good, but I don't like maple. I did add an extra 1/3 cup of walnuts, but that's just my gig, I like walnuts. I really like pecan pie but it's go GAWDAWFUL sweet and rich that I can't eat more than a tiny sliver. This is not like that...it is sweet, yes, but, seriously, I could eat this whole pie...it's that good! It's great with a cup of coffee, which is what I'm doing right now. Thank you, Vivian, for submitting this delicious recipe and I'll be making another one of these for Thanksgiving.

I have brand new oven, yet after 45 minutes, on 300, the pie was barely beginning to set.  I increased the temp to 350 and baked 15 minutes longer.

This is the same pie recipe that "Dear Abby" would give out occasionally. It has been a hit at every gathering I've taken it to.

I give this five stars for amazing taste and ease of preparation. I did experience some difficulties in the cooking process, but I know that was due to my inexperience with making walnut/pecan pies and also because of my horrible oven and its temperature issues.  I followed the baking directions exactly, but my pie was still noticeably underdone even after an extra 20 minutes.  I raised the temperature, but it was still hard for me to tell when it was done, and eventually I overcooked it.  I did some post-baking research and found a link on savorsa dot com (which I can't apparently post in this review, because it was removed) which discusses the various baking times/temperatures for pecan pies and how to tell when they are done. It was very useful for me as a beginner with pecan/walnut pies, so I wanted to mention it in case it helps other people, too.  Again, this is an excellent recipe.  Clearly, the baking time/temperature works well for other people, so I'm not going to be one of Those People who 1-star a recipe based on what are obviously their own personal issues.  But if you think you might need more information than the recipe provides for knowing when the pie is done ("continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes" is kind of vague for non-experts), then check out some other resources beforehand.  I will definitely make this again using this recipe's ingredients, but I will use a different baking time/temperature.

Quick and easy!  Just sweet enough without being too sweet.  What's not to love here!  I followed the recipe as stated except I did use 1 1/2 cups of walnuts just to use up what I had left.  The timing and temp worked great.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed this recipe, but added a 1/4 cup evaporated milk and 1 tbsp of flour, just to change the texture of the filling. Very easy and delicious.

we loved this pie! i used half pecans and half walnuts because it is what i had on hand. it was a big hit! i live in texas but came here from new york years ago and the one thing about a lot of southern desserts is they are too sweet! i found this pie to be just right..not overly sweet. this pie is in my recipe box for my go to pie. i am a good cook but never claimed to be a good baker. this pie made me look like i was!! thanks for the great recipe.

100% the best pie I have ever had.  I have made it at least 6 times in the last month.  My husband (who WAS a pecan pie lover) can't get enough!

Delicious!  If I hadn't made it myself, I wouldn't have known it wasn't made with pecans. I'm not crazy about walnuts, but I will definitely make this again.

This pie was so disappointing.  It never setup and just look like lots of syrup with walnuts floating in it.

This is my all-time favorite kind of pie, especially since I live in an area surrounded by walnut orchards and have neighbors that let me glean the nuts.  Since I also allow beekeepers to overwinter their hives on my property, I am compensated with a dozen quarts of honey a year.  This year I substituted honey for the corn syrup, making super delicious walnut honey pies. 3 teaspoons of corn starch insures that the filling is not the least bit runny.

DELICIOUS! I had my heart set on pecan pie this Thanksgiving, but with the price of pecans, I knew that I had to find another alternative...this fit the bill! While it's not a PECAN pie, it's very yummy and filled the craving. This will definitely be made again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Didn't have the 3/4c of light corn syrup on hand so I substituted 1/2c of Agave Nectar instead -- the pie came out absolutely delicious. ..Will make again soon to use up all the extra walnuts I have in my freezer.

I love desserts my husband does not.  Even he loved it & requested it for all our holidays from now on.  I like nuts & only added about 1/4 cup more of finely chopped walnuts.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an easy recipe to follow and the pie was good. I made a few for Thanksgiving and everyone (20 people) tried it and liked it. Not as flavorful as pecan but still good.

My husband said this is the best pie he has ever eaten!  It is easy and absolutely delicious!  Neither one of us like Pecan pie because it is so sweet and rich.  This is not as sweet as Pecan pie and tastes so much better.  You can actually eat more than one piece of this one!  :-)  I made it as the recipe said except I used 1/2 corn syrup and 1/2 100% pure maple syrup per other reviews.  I already have requests to make it again for Christmas!  I used the Pillsbury ready made refrigerated pie crust dough and it worked great.  I did brush the bottom with egg whites before baking to keep the bottom from getting soggy.  Awesome recipe...will make again and again!   Thanks!

Super good! So easy to make! It does taste like a pecan pie...but not as sweet. Let it cool down for a bit after taking it out of the oven so it'll have time to thicken.

This is very good! I used walnuts and liked it but some people said they'd prefer pecans but said it was still good with walnuts. It's the perfect sweetness and a terrific texture. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this pie a few times and it always turns out great.  The last time I made it I only had half the required amount of corn syrup (oops!) so I substituted real maple syrup (not table syrup) for the rest and it still turned out wonderfully.  This is my favourite nut pie recipe!!!

This was terrific! I got so many compliments on this pie. Everyone loved the way it looked most of all! I had planned on making more pecan pies, but ran out of pecans and made this instead. Now I think I have to bring this every year for THanksgiving.

This pie was SO good! If you like pecan pie, you'll love this pie! I didn't have any pecans and I really wanted to make a pecan pie, so I decided to try a walnut pie instead! It was very good!
 Thank-you.

This pie is delicious! Just a note for those who have had bad results with the filling setting up; I live at a higher altitude which causes pie fillings to cook slower so i increased the oven temp to 325 degrees and the cook time to 1 hour. It turned out perfect!

I love this pie! It’s better to me than any pecan pie I’ve ever had!
I did make one adjustment and added only 1/2 cup sugar because I don’t like food that’s too sweet.
I really liked the buttery flavor and the sweetness level was perfect. I can’t wait to make it again!

Followed recipe exactly. It is definitely not a deep dish pie. Did not come close to filling up my deep dish pie pan. Will make again it was yummy was  done at 35 min for me, but next time I make it will use my regular pie pan.

Attempted this recipe for a baby shower and it was a huge success!! (With my g-grandmother's pie crust recipe)
I made tartlets instead of a full pie and they were amazing!! Didn't have corn syrup so I used brown sugar with boiled water as a substitute. Also, with the small size, cut down the secondary bake time by about 10 minutes*.
*our oven is fickle about temperature so I cant say the oven was exactly where the original recipe said it ought to have  been.

This was super easy to make and came out perfect.  It's great with a dollop of whipped cream on top.  I added an extra half cup of nuts and traded off some of the corn syrup for maple syrup.

My new favorite pie! This is my second time making it.  Both times I have used 1/2 more walnuts and the second time around, l used 1 cup more finely ‘course’ chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup truly course chopped.  I like the more nutty taste and I love that this isn’t as sweet as traditional pecan pie.  Excellent recipe!!  Super easy to make.

I stumbled across this recipe a few years back. I accidentally grabbed walnuts instead of pecans for Christmas pies. In a panic I searched walnut pie and this was the first to pop up. My family who LOVES pecan pie said this pie was amazing and they wanted me to make again next Christmas. I’ve been making it for three years now for every Christmas and no longer do we eat pecan pies for the holidays.

Delicious and easy to make!  I've actually never made a nut pie, but it turned out very well.  It took about 53 minutes instead of 35 to 45 until the sides were set and the middle was soft set.  (Remember to start at 400 degrees and drop to 300 after the first 10 minutes of baking--I can't help but wonder if that is why people have had pies not set.)  I set my pie on a cooling rack for a good 2 hours or so to let it finish setting up, and then gave it a try.  :)  This recipe is a keeper!

Wonderful British pie for the holidays, or any function that will amaze the palate. Similar to the American Pecan pie, yet not as earthy.

Followed exactly, checked @35mins, still jiggly, let it go the full 45 and it appears to have set fine. Won't cut until tomorrow (Thanksgiving) Hope it tastes as good as it looks!

I made this pie because pecans were so expensive and a neighbor had given me a bag full of walnuts. This pie was so delicious. My husband and elderly father requested a repeat pie. It was easy and simple to make. Its a keeper!

I love, love, love this recipe. I follow all instructions exactly, save for two things:
I use a LOT more walnuts. Like, a cup+. Just eyeball it.  Yes, it makes for a dense pie, very crunchy, but if you like that nutmeat texture it's A+. 
Also, after crushing the walnuts, I uhm.. I put em in a pan with a hefty tbs of butter and 'fry' them until they're warm and toasty and coated in fat.  (Wait for em to cool down before mixing with the eggs, though!)

Brilliant pie. Absolutely brilliant.

Needs a thickener like pectin....or if you don't add that, make sure you let it sit overnight before eating....it thickens reasonably well overnight

The consistency was too gooey, the crust was too hard & it was way too sweet. I think one could get away with just doing 1/2 cup or sugar & 1/2 a cup of corn syrup or substitute at least one, if not both, for a lighter option. I'm only giving it 4 starts because after your teeth stop hurting from the sugar, it tastes actually pretty good.

Don't be confused by reference to deep dish crust.  Use a regular pie pan.  Cook toward the long end of time range  but do not over cook.  It is like a custard filling so the center will be soft until it cools.  I find 42 minutes is about right.  I use 1 1/2 cups walnuts.

This is my third time making this awesome pie.  As one reviewer suggested, I added one half cup of Karo syrup and one fourth cup maple syrup.  It is no short of amazing.  Tastes strangely similar to baklava!?  My friends love it and request it at all our gatherings.

Among the 5-6 xmas desserts, everyone loved this one the most. Per the comments, I added an extra egg and a tbsp of mollasses, and also never chopped the walnuts.  I also substituted half maple syrup for corn syrup, and baked it about 10mins longer.

I usually make Pecan Pie, but have found that it is it tastes too sweet to many people. I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving this year. After reading the reviews, I used Dark Corn Syrup and added a 1/4 cup more walnuts. I also raised the cooking temperature for the second temperature to 325 degrees. I baked it for the same amount of time as the original. It was perfect and disappeared before the Pumkin Pie! I will definitely make this again!!

This is one of the best pies I've ever had. 10 times better than pecan pie. When people try it they always ask for the recipe.

Delicious pie I made when my mom and dad came over last Christmas and then my mom requested the recipe. Easy and good, one of my favorite recipes from this site. Didn't change a thing.

I chose this pie to make because I happened
to have all the ingredients on hand and wanted to use my walnuts to save my pecans ( the latter seems to get used up faster). I was not disappointed. This pie was a hit with my husband who's fav is pecan pie. He was a little put off when I told him it was walnuts at first but he changed his tune after the first bite. Easy peasy and delish. I made my own pie crust using, 2 C all purpose flour,  3/4 C shortening, 1 tsp salt, and 6 Tbs  ice water. Cut shortening (lard) into flour and salt until crumbly. Add ice water 2 Tbs at a time. Roll out. Makes 2 - 9" crusts. Thank for the wonderful recipe.

Very good!  We thought it was better than pecan pie.  Just the right amount of sweetness too.  Great recipe!

This pie was so easy to make, and excellent.  I made it for our neighbors, who are chefs, and also have a pie business.  They loved it, and thought it was better than the traditional pecan pie.  I sprinkled a few walnut halves on top after putting the filling in the crust, and served with whip cream.

This was the first time I have ever tried to make a nut pie of any kind. It was so easy and not overly sweet like other nut pies I have eaten. I will certainly use this recipe again.
