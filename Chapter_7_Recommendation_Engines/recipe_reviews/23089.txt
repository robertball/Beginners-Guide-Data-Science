I used a frozen banana, Stacy's nonfat organic vanilla yogurt, two tbsp. homemade fruit jam and fat free milk. The kids thought this was great.

Pretty good - I used fat free vanilla yogurt and since I didn't have blueberry syrup or rice milk I used honey and skim milk.

I really like the combination of fruits on this smoothie. Since I used all frozen fruit, I had to increase the amount of milk. Also, instead of blueberry syrup I used 1/2 scoop of protein supplement. Thank you Penny, this is a great smoothie!

Really good!  I used honey instead of the blueberry syrup and fat free peach yogurt, just because it's all I had.  I also added a little more rice milk because it was a little too thick for me.  I'll make these again!

I tried this since I had already tried all the others and noticed no one had left a review. I found it to be very bitter tasting so I tried it again using vanilla yogurt instead of plain and 2% milk instead of the rice milk. I also used a dash of vanilla extract. It was a little better, but still very bitter. Not my favorite here. So sorry.

I wish I'd had some blueberries but I didn't, nor did I have any rice milk.  I added a little more non-fat yogurt to replace the rice milk and did not add the syrup as we don't like anything overly sweet.  The end result was fantastic to us.  I made 6X the recipe to take to a retirement home tomorrow...will serve over ice.  I expect rave reviews...hubby swooned over his serving!!!  Wish I'd had some of those blueberries.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I love the fruit combination in this smoothie as well!  I didn't have fruit syrup, but I did have jam, and so I used that instead.  That's the only change I made.  Delicious!

I used Chobani's  peach yogurt, peach pur√©e, a  dash of soy milk, and a handful of blueberries....and then froze to make pops.  Drinking the few ounces left, I can see a slight sweetener would be needed, hopefully frozen that will not be the case, as It was too late to add it to the pops! Using a banana would have helped, but I didn't want to dilute the peach/blueberry taste.

Because I was freezing it, I strained the mixture to get a smoother creme pop.  

I like this recipe because it uses peaches and blueberries.....tired of the endless strawberry/banana based smoothies!

I didn't care for the syrup in this, it gave it a weird taste.
