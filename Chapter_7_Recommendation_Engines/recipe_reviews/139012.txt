Absolutely the most addicting dip ever! I was skeptical that the ingredients would taste well together, and nothing more should be added (like bacon). Well, I used fresh parmesan, and it was perfect, better than cheddar. I tried adding bacon and it detracted from the taste. The dip was not mild, but not tearfully spicy either, so if you need it REALLY hot, doubling the jalepenos would suit you. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using panko (Kikkoman makes a grocery-store version) crumbs on top of the parmesan (10/08 UPDATE TIP!!! MIX the 1/2 cup panko crumbs WITH your FRESH grated parmesan and sprinkle the mixture atop. It comes out SO crispy and golden, and prevents the cheese melting into a hard crust you can't scoop through. Perfect, perfect!); and you'll bake up a beautiful golden, crunchy coating -- that "deep-fried" taste! Do bake in the oven. Last but not least, the large crowds that have devoured this agree that the best DIPPER is TOASTED FRENCH BREAD slices (place on pan under the broiler for a couple *careful* minutes per side), distantly followed by butter crackers. Tortilla chips are the least favorite, and sourdough bread (my usual favorite) seemed too sharp to accentuate the dip. Hope that helps any questions YOU might have! =)

Thank you for all of the wonderful comments!  I also use a whole 4 oz can of jalapenos, because I like it spicy.  I use REAL shredded parmesan on the top.  It does make the best "popper" flavor.  You just have to trust me.  In order to get the correct consistency, you have to stick to the recipe.  Do not substitute with sour cream and you must use the mayo.  The best presentation you can do is REAL shredded parmesan cheese on top, and bake it in the oven in a glass pie dish.  It comes out golden brown and gorgeous!  Mmmm...  Also, you'd think bacon would be great in this.  It's not.  Again, you just have to trust me.  People rate this recipe less than 5 stars when they add to it and that's not the recipe that I've shared.  Please stick to the recipe for the best results, and use the baked variation with real shredded parmesan cheese (not the green can stuff).  Enjoy!!!

I took this to a football party & it was DEVOURED! i did what others suggested:  used 6 fresh jalapenos, used 1/2 C mayo & 1/2 C sour cream, omitted the chiles, added 1/2 C shredded cheddar, & finished it off with italian bread crumbs & a sprinkle of cheddar.  I served it with sliced baguette.  next time I make it, I'm going to try adding some pepperjack cheese.  It could have been a bit spicier for me.

W-O-W!  This is SO yummy.  I took the advice of others and used more diced jalapenos - - I drained a 7.75 oz. can and used that.  The dip had heat, but no one said it was too hot for their taste buds.  I also used shredded Cheddar cheese (1/2 in the cream cheese mixture and 1/2 sprinkled on top.) because that is more an ingredient in poppers than Parmesan.  And because others suggested it, I also sprinkled lightly with bread crumbs for that "fried" popper taste.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and served it with Tostito Scoops. This "dip" tasted exactly like jalapeno poppers.   Try this, you will not be disappointed.

Just Awesome!  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Used a fresh parmesan/reggiano mix and I would DEFINITELY recommend topping with bread crumbs, because even though this is the tastiest dip around, it does not look very appealing.  I would also bake it in the oven (350 for 20-30 minutes). Served with toasted baguette slices...perfect!!

I used the baked variation.  I used fresh parmesan and accidentally used the whole can of jalapenos, but it was really good.  I served it as an appetizer.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!  I will be making this again soon.

This does taste like poppers. I used about 6 fresh chopped jalapeno's and baked it for about 20 min @ 300.

WOW!  This was fantastic.  I halved the recipe and used equal parts green chilis and jalaps.  I did not use parm, because that didn't seem very "poppery" to me.  Instead, I mixed in some odds and ends of 2% shredded cheeses I had:  sharp cheddar, co-jack, and a mexican mix. I also used 1/2 C light mayo and 1/2 C sour cream because I prefer sour cream to mayo (and per earlier suggestions).  I baked in the oven and served w/fresh french bread.  I covered the top w/bread crumbs (and sprayed w/PAM to "crisp") prior to baking.  Yum, yum!

WoW, I read all the reviews and thought it can't be that good. It is!! Thanks, it was a major hit at our 4th of July celebration. I took the hints and doubled the jalapenos and added the bread crumbs. While it was in the microwave I turned on the broiler and popped it in for just a minute to crisp up the top. I was asked for the recipe over and over again.

This is absolutely delicious!  It was a huge hit at the 4th of July BBQ party at our neighbors.  It went pretty fast with everyone going back for 2nds.  I did use a full 4 oz. can of diced Jalapeño peppers and a mix of Parmesan & Romano Cheeses, baked in 325 degree oven for about 25 minutes and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese for better presentation.  A keeper for sure!  Thank you Denise!

I made this for a party and no one really cared for it. Most of it didn't get eaten. The mayonnaise was overpowering for us. I decided to try again with some modifications. I used fresh jalapeno's. I added some cumin to the cream cheese. I used sour cream and no mayo, mixed in some cheddar cheese, and thinking of some poppers a local restaurant, I added a small can of crab meat, and added breadcrumbs to the top.  I served it again to our friends and with the modifications it was a huge hit.

I used  4oz Chilies, and 4 oz. Jalapeno warmed in microwave to soft stage. Then I spread the mixture on Tortilla wraps and rolled, place them in the freezer until firm and sliced. Awesome - easy appetizer!

This recipe ROCKS!!!   I baked it in the oven following the directions to the "T".  Took it out of the oven and placed in a crock pot to maintain the gooey warmness and it worked like a charm!   I cannot tell you how many raves reviews this recipe gets...It is unbelievable!! Crock pot is a must to keep it warm and gooey!  Tortilla Chips are a must!  ****Additional note. If you double this recipe I had to cut the mayo down to 1.5 cups to capture the same flavor as the original single recipe.

I've already made this 3 times in the last few weeks - everyone loves it! I topped it with Panko bread crumbs and parmesan before baking, which does give it a nice crunchy crust. The amount of jalapeno called for is perfect; both heat and non-heat lovers equally enjoy this wonderful dip!

What a hit!! I decided to add 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs with 1 cup of Parmesan cheese to the top of the mixture before baking. This recipe turned out absolutely delicious and was gone before I knew it. I served the dip with French bread slices and pretzels. I am looking forward to making this recipe again real soon.

This stuff is great!  It really does taste just like a jalepeno popper!  I even used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat mayo and it was delicious.  Next time I might use 2 oz. of jalepeno vs. 4 oz. I used the whole can and now I can see why the recipe uses half.  Definitely use shredded parmesan cheese.  I baked mine at 375 for 35 minutes and it went great with both triscuits and tortilla chips.

I have tried MANY different jalapeno popper and jalapeno-popper-esque recipes...none of them impressed me and all of them took SO MUCH WORK.  This recipe is completely the opposite!!  HOLY COW is it amazing!  The past reviewers and recipe submitter are absolutely correct - it DOES taste exactly like a popper and it is SOOOO easy to make!  Every single person who tried this at our 4th of July BBQ fell in love with it - they just couldn't stay away! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for this recipe!!  I will definitely bring this to many future gatherings!  I topped with Panko bread crumbs (sprayed with cooking spray) and baked for 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  UPDATE:  I've been using two cans of green chilies and a full can of jalapenos.  Sounds like a lot, but it's perfect in my opinion!  It's dangerously addicting though.  My boyfriend's brother likes to make tortilla pinwheels with the mixture - it's pretty tasty this way, but I prefer Ritz crackers.

Edit 12/06/2010 If I reviewed this every time I made it there'd be 30 pages of just my reviews. However, this time deserves special mention. I snuck out of the party early and took my bowl of this dip with me, so I actually had leftovers this time. I added a glob of dip to my eggs the next morning and they were BEYOND GOOD. Best scrambled eggs in the UNIVERSE.

Forget the chopped green chiles and canned jalapenos.   I omitted those, and ran about 8 fresh jalapenos through a blender and added that instead.  A much fresher flavor, and the dairy mutes the hotness of the fresh peppers quite a bit.

Very good!  I made this for a pool party last night, and everyone loved it.  Even the picky kids liked it!  I couldn't find fresh jalapenos, so I used "tame" jalapenos from a jar.  Because the jarred jalapenos had less heat, I used double the amount.  It had just enough kick without being too spicy for the pickiest guests.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs to the parmesan topping.  It turned out great!  I highly recommend serving this with toasted baguette slices.  I sliced the baguette about 1/4 inch thick and placed the slices on a cookie sheet.  I popped them in a 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes.  Like other reviewers, I recommend baking this in a pie dish.  I plan to make it again with fresh jalapenos for a little more heat!

I made this and loved it! (Added the bread crumbs, doubled the jalapenos and baked it) My friend made a similar recipe but served it with CUCUMBERS as a dipper and I couldn't believe how much I prefered that over sliced baguettes or crackers. Try it!

The reviews do not lie!  This is great and an easy time saving recipe.  I made it FINALLY for the first time this past weekend and spent quite a bit of time telling folks its name and ingredients.  They were like a football team in a huddle over it!  Thank you thank you thank you.

This was really wonderful.  I made is as written, but accidentally added half of the Parmesan to the dip.  The other half went on top with about 1/3 cup Panko bread crumbs.  I baked it at 400 deg. for 20 minutes and it was beautifully browned and hot.  I served it with toasted baguette rounds.  I think I will add more jalapeno next time, as their flavor was very mild.  Good, don't get me wrong, and we don't love very spicy food, but more jalapeno would make this pop!

This will be a somewhat "unhelpful" critique:)  AMAZING, had to do NOTHING differently, everyone loved it!  I had people over to "taste test" new recipes for an upcoming party I was going to have...this was one of the clear cut winners.  Of course I served it at the party as well as a couple more times since.  Definitely a good party dip!

This dip is amazing!!!! I took it to a Ohio State football party and it's a request from my friends for every party ever since! I recommend using 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. The sour cream makes it special. I also use the whole can of jalapenos (drain about 70% of the juice out first, or leave the juice if you want it extra spicy!) I recommend also mixing in about 1/2 cup bread crumbs then sprinkling bread crumbs on top along with grated parmesean. Bake in the oven then serve on toasted french bread slices! Mmmm...

A pretty good dip for a crowd!  I took previous reviewers' advice and opted for safe (mild) by using fresh serano peppers (4) and jalapeno peppers (3), membranes and seeds removed.  Added some salt as well because the canned stuff contains salt.   Pretty much everyone liked the dip even though it was barely spicey.  The topping mixture of 1/2 cup Panko and 1 cup grated parmesan gave it a pleasing crunch texture which people liked.  Next time I'll try leaving the pepper membranes intact to see how hot it gets.

I tried this because my family LOVES stuffed jalapenos.  I wanted something that was easier but real close to those.  This one is the next best thing. It will go into my keep file.  I read the reviews and also used panko on the top. I also used freshly grated parmesan, and I baked it instead of using the micro.   I also doubled the diced jalapenos as my guys really like the hot stuff.  I can't eat it when I make it this hot, but when I use the orginal recipe, it's just right for me. I made this for our camping trip over Thanksgiving, and among the 10 other appetizers put out, this is the one that went first, and was gone in less than 10 minutes.  I'm making this for a New Year's Eve party, and will make both kinds. I'm also going to try adding some bacon bits (real ones) and I think that will only add to how great this is.  I'll update later and let you know how it went over. I highly recommend this recipe.  You can't go wrong with it. Thanks Denise :)

Excellent!!!   Here's the changes I made: -2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened -1 cup Hellman’s mayonnaise -2 – 4 ounces canned diced jalapeno peppers, drained really well -3/4 cup shredded Monterey jack cheese -1 cup grated Parmesan cheese -1 cup Panko bread crumbs 1. Stir together cream cheese and mayonnaise in a large bowl until smooth, stir in jalapeno peppers and Monterey jack cheese. Pour mixture into an oven safe serving dish. Bake about 20 -30mins. at 375 degrees. Combine Parmesan cheese with Panko bread crumbs and sprinkle on top of spread. Bake again until the topping is browned and dip is bubbling hot.  Best served with lightly toasted French bread slices.  The amount of jalapenos you use depends on your taste.  I used 4 oz. of hot peppers. and it wasn’t too hot.  It also depends on if the peppers you use are mild, medium or hot.

AMAZING!!! I made this for my family thanksgiving potluck and it was GONE within half an hour. everyone asked me either to make it for them or the recipe it was a hit.
i did change the recipe up a little and i also thought it was great.
i used 3 packages of cream cheese, one package of sour cream. i roasted 8 jalapenos, removed the skin. deseeded 4 and blended it up. i creamed together the cream cheese and sour cream, added blended jalapenos and 8oz of pepper jack cheese (def do this) and topped it off ith bread crumbs and parmesan for 20 mins at 375. Definitely will be my staple go-to item for future potlucks and get togethers.

This IS a GREAT dip. My daughter and I serve it a lot and people always love it. And it's so easy. I agree with other viewers, just use the whole can. I will try the idea of poppping it under the broiler after the microwave next time or the oven, but it is good as is from the microwave. Thanks for this yummy, easy recipe!

We all LOVED this!!   I followed the recipe exactly, except for sprinkling a bit more Parmesean cheese on top and baking it for 15 minutes as mentioned in the footnote.  I think 2 oz of diced Jalapenos (2 tbs) is the right amount of heat for a crowd since not all will like it hot.  My husband, who does not like hot foods, loved this as well as my brother who loves hot and spicy foods.  It met all taste preferences.  I did put the jalapenos and chilies in a food chopper for a few seconds so no one would bite into a jalapeno unexpectedly.   I served this with Keebler Club Snack Sticks, Original flavor (like Club crackers).  Perfect!  I'm sure it would be great with toasted French baguettes too.  The only thing I may do differently next time is to heat the dip in the microwave as indicated and/or in a small Crock Pot to keep it warm.  When baked in the oven, the cheese on top made a slight crust that I found annoying when trying to dip through it once it started to cool. I think this is best served warm. Thanks for such a great recipe, Denise!!  Can't wait to make this again . . . and again.
UPDATE:  Just made this again but this time just put all the ingreditents in a small crockpot and heated on low.  The flavor is exactly the same and the crowd loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe twice this holiday season. The only thing I add is 1 cup Panko bread crumbs to the top right before baking. This dip does not last long. Yuuummy !

Tried this recipe and loved it!! Made 1 little change, I added some corn. After having tried some Jalapeno Smoked Corn many years ago, I have always remembered what a great combination Jalapenos and Corn is. The corn adds a sweetness in each bite that really compliments the jalapeno and cream cheese. Try it...you won't regret it!!

The biggest food hit at my party!  I did double the jalapenos and although people commented that it was spicey, they also couldn't stop eating it.  I would definitely recommend baking it (I did..can't imagine microwaving it)...and I served mine with toasted french bread slices.  i had 1 1/2 loaves of the long skinny french bread and ran out of bread..people were still putting it on whatever they could find (tortilla chips..or a SPOON) but next time I will make sure i have enough bread, cause that was definitely better.  Everyone wanted the recipe, one lady literally CORNERED ME for the recipe...can't wait to make again!  Only thing i'll do different next time is mix half the cheese into the spread...although it was delicious, it did create a crust that was a little too thick and i noticed people were digging under the crust for the good stuff.

I made this to take to a shower. I made according to recipe directions except I used 4 ounces of Jalapeno's and 1 1/2 cups of REAL shredded parmesan cheese, added 1 cup cheese to spread and mixed it in and sprinkled the rest on top. I did not use any bread crumbs. I made it in a small crock pot and kept it warm. It was AWESOME !!!  Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. It was completely gone - the  dish was empty.I served it with tostitos scoops. So Easy and Sooo yummy !!! Very addicting, now I am making it again this weekend just for us to snack on. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I am loving this dip!!  My kids will especially love it when I make it for them soon!  On a different note: I have this same little bowl as in the recipe photo!  My mother originally had 6 of them years ago, and I have the only one left!  It is Fire King ware, and I love it!! Wish I could find more!

Great recipe. Not a huge mayo fan so I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Best when sprinkled with extra Parmesan cheese and baked at 350 for 30 min. This was a hit both times I made it.

This was fantastic! I followed other recommendations and made the following changes:  used the whole 4oz. Can of jalapeños, used light cream cheese & light mayo, added about 1/2 cup cheddar cheese to cream cheese mixture, topped with fresh shaved parm & panko bread crumbs and baked in the oven for 30 minutes.  Served this with toasted bread rounds!  The whole house loved it.

I was really looking forward to having this recipe for New Year's Eve since poppers are one of our favorite appetizers when we eat out. Other than using cheddar cheese, which we like in poppers, instead of parmesan cheese, I followed this recipe exactly. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with it. To me it was actually kind of bland and the taste of the mayonnaise was very evident. It would require a lot of tweeking for me to make it again. It makes a lot, so I have a lot left over. Hopefully, it won't to go to waste.

AWESOME - Def bake instead of micro wave.   And add in the parm cheese to the mixture instead of on top!    I also threw in a handful or two of extra fresh chopped Jalapeno's!

Served this Friday night to friends - we all enjoyed it.  I didn't have jalapenos on hand, so I used a boat load of green chilies.  The only other change  was adding 8 dashes of Cholula sauce.  Will make this again and again.

This was a hit!! I toasted some breadcrumbs to put on top to give more of the jalapeno popper taste and there was none left at the end of the night.

My men LOVE this! Surprisingly for me, I followed the recipe without any "tweaks." On the day after (if there is any left) my men use it as a spread on sandwiches. Says it gives them a real kick!

This is just the best spread EVER!!  As others said, totally addicting flavor.  Made it for my son's Super Bowl party, and everyone raved about it!! In order to control the heat, I used 3 fresh jalapenos, seeds and membrane removed - placed the halves in boiling water for only a couple of minutes, just to soften a bit, then cut into small dice.  I also mixed 1/2 cup Kikkoman panko crumbs with 1 cup of shredded parmesan (the kind in the small plastic tubs) and sprinkled over the top, then baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  This is fantastic hot, but any leftovers (good luck on that!) is great cold with crackers or baguette slices, or anything else you may have on hand!  (NOTE:  preparing the jalapenos as above resulted in NO  HEAT - ONLY FLAVOR - great for those of us who cannot tolerate spicy foods!)

I have made this several times (over 20) and it has been a hit every time.  I have also made extra and put it in a small container, pressed plastic wrap on top of the dip and put it in the freezer.  It works great for drop in company.

EXCELLENT! I made this recipe for an office pot luck and it was gone in an hour! I took the suggestion of another viewer and baked mine at 350 for 20 minutes. I also whipped everything up the night before and put it into the frig overnight and baked it in the morning.

How can something this easy be this good?  I served this for our sons birthday party - one of many appetizers.  The little bit that was left was even better the next day.  I, too, added sliced jalopenas on top.  This will definitely be a regular for us!

I made this dip for an easter appetizer and I couldn't keep the chips coming fast enough.  I added the entire 4oz jar of jalapeno instead of just 2oz.  Everyone loved it!!!!  Thanks, I am already sending out the recipe to guests.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I was looking for a crowd pleasing recipe for my end of the school year department party, and this was a huge hit!!!  I did make a few changes to the recipe though.  I doubled the jalapenos to 4oz and added about 2/3 cup parmesan cheese into the mixture.  Then on top I covered with a combination of 3/4 cup panko and 1 cup parmesan cheese.  Bake uncovered at 375 for 15 min, then broil just until browned and beautiful.  I served with homemade crustinis (just bake the bread slices brushed with melted mixture of butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic salt).  DELICIOUS!!

I made this for a surprise birthday party and it was a huge hit. I used fresh Parmesan and the panko breadcrumbs on top like other users suggested but otherwise didn't change anything. I've made this a few more times without the chilies or without the breadcrumbs and it was still delicious.

This is SO good.  I make it for potlucks at work and everyone always expects it and asks for the recipe.  I make it a little lower in fat sometimes by using half Greek yogurt, half mayo, and low fat cream cheese.  Lowfat or non traditional mayo and nonfat cream cheese works ok, but doesn't taste nearly as good.  I also top it with cheddar or Mexican blend instead of using Parmesan.  It is delicious warm or cold.

Wow! I love this recipe and joy of jesus hints. I originally made it for all the guys in the family and was I ever surprised. We all loved it! I was looking at the recipe again for football day and realized I've never rated it. This is definitely a 5 star recipe.

Very tasty, served with Wheat Thins.  I used a loaf pan and baked it and would recommend using a larger pan, as the parm. cheese was pretty thick after adding it all.  Can't imagine if you used a bowl.

I never heated it. I just severed it cold and I added four cooked pepper bacon slices chopped up in it as well. One of the other reviews mentioned that how she did her "regular" poppers and I thought why not!update I used Rye Triscuts at Thanksgiving because I had some that needed to be used, and this was very good with the Rye flavor!

This is amazing! The only change I made was using 4 oz of jalapenos versus the 2 oz and I didn't use one cup of parm ... I used 1/2 cup and stirred it right in. Made mine in a small crock pot. THANK YOU! IT IS A HIT!

I couldn't find canned diced jalapenos, so I diced canned whole jalapenos.  I used four, but will probably use more next time.  And there will be a next time.

This dish improves with age.  So next time, I will combine all the ingredients a couple of days in advance.  It also can use a bit more jalapenos without becoming too hot or spicy.  I served it with Fritos and Tostitos Baked Chips.

WOW!  Best dip for a football party ever, hands down!  Guys went crazy over this.  I made exactly as written with just a little more cheese, and placed in a 9" pie plate.  Baked at 350 for about 40 minutes (it was just out of the fridge) until a light brown around the edge and bubbly.  Yummy stuff!  Thanks for sharing, Denise.

This is wonderful!!!  Instead of serving it as a dip, I cut a loaf of french bread longways and toasted it in the oven (350 degrees, just for a few minutes).  Once it was a little bit browned (not so much that the bread was hard, but just enough so the spread wouldn't make the bread soggy), I spread this along the length of both sides.  I put it back in the oven to warm up for about 10 minutes and pulled out again to cool to room temperature.  When it was cool enough that the topping wasn't too gooey, I sliced the loaf into slices and served.  Everyone raved and many asked for the recipe!  I will make this again very soon!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Took this to a card party and had many requests for the recipe. I did take other reviewers advice and used two cans of jalapenos, 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream, put half of the parmesan cheese in the mix and mixed the other half with panko breadcrumbs and sprinkled on top. I didn't microwave, but baked it at 350 for about 15 mins until the topping was browned and the dip was bubbly. Served with Fritos Scoops corn chips and Triscuit Thin Crisps, and everyone liked the Triscuits better. Will definitely make again!

Very GOOD. I scaled recipe down to 8 servings. My cheese separated after coming out of the microwave (or it was green chili juice). After cooling some, it did mix better. I only added some Jalapeno after the kids ate their share!

This was the hit of the party.  

Only use freshly grated parmesan - this will alter the taste if you don't.  When I used the Kraft stuff this dip was good...but not like a jalepno popper.  More like a parmesean cream cheese dip.

Changes: whole can of jalapenos and 3 fresh chili peppers (this was a spicy dip).  Sprinkled a little bit of bread crumbs on top w/ the parm.  

TASTED JUST LIKE A JALAPENO POPPER!!

Served with bite-sized Tostitos.

I made as written except adding an entire 4oz can of chopped jalapenos versus 2oz. It is very good but quite rich even though I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Next time I will use in a larger pie pan versus a smaller round dish b/c the topping was too thick and it needs to be thinner.

This was not spicy enough for our tastes, even though I did double the amount of jalepenos to 4oz. The first time I baked it, I followed the recipe exactly, except for the doubling of the jalepenos. The second time I made it, I used the suggestion of another reviewer and put the mixture into little phyllo cups and topped with fresh Parmesan and jalepeno slices. I may try this again, but if I do, I will add another 4oz. can of jalepenos and maybe try it with the panko breadcrumbs on top as someone else suggested. Definitely fell short of my expectations, given the reviews.

I prepared the recipe as written and it was delicious!  So easy! I was a little nervous about microwaving rather than baking but it came out great, in fact I think if it was baked the crust that would have formed would have been difficult to spread. I serve with pita bread and it was a hit! I will be keeping the ingredients on hand to prepare for any spur of the moment needs. Thank you Denise!

I brought this for a potluck at work and it was good but a little too much mayo. I'd say maybe cut the mayo amount in half and add more diced chilies. I used a cake beater to mix it all up and it made it look a little creamier. I recommend this.

Awesome dip!!! Will definitely make again!  I made this for a work pot-luck and followed the recipe exactly (no substitutions).  The only modification I made was to heat it up in a crock pot. I cut the cream cheese blocks into smaller pieces and threw all the ingredients in the crock pot and heated up on low for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally to make sure everything melted and blended. Right before serving I topped with the Parmesan Cheese.  Served it with Pretzel Thins and Bagel Chips and it was gone by the time I went up for seconds. Had so many people ask for the recipe! Thanks so much!

Oh, my GOSH! If you love Poppers, you will LOVE this recipe! 

I did what MANY other reviewers said to do. Added 4oz of Jalapenos, used half sour cream - half MAYO, added a little cheddar to the mix AND the dusted it with breadcrumbs & baked it. PERFECTION!!!! Thank you for this recipe!!

By the way, for any reviewers giving this a bad rating because you're NOT following the recipe? Not fair. ESPECIALLY if you substitute MIRACLE WHIP for MAYONNAISE. Miracle Whip should not be used in this recipe.

I made this receipe for Christmas Eve appetizer party and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone wanted the receipe.  I changed just a few little things...I used the fire roasted green chilies, used 2-3 fresh jalapenos instead of the canned, added some chopped garlic and a little bit of chipotle Chulola sauce (its like Tabasco).  I topped it with a mix of Panko breading and shredded Parmesan cheese to mimic the breading on a popper, and baked for 30 min.  I served it with tortilla chips.  I thought my family was going to lick the dish clean!!  My boyfriend enjoyed it so much he asked me to make it again for New Years.  **As a side note, I did add some bacon, just 2 strips chopped, but it really didn't add anything to the dip.  When my cousin asked what was in the dip he was suprised that there was bacon in it.

Fantastic!  Just took this out of the oven a half hour ago and three of us have already devoured half of it.  Used the same ingredients but as others suggested I used l/2 mayo and l/2 sour cream and the whole 4 oz can of jalapenos.  That made it just right.  I also added l/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the mix.  To the top cup of grated parmesan cheese, I added l/2 cup of plain panko bread crumbs.  We liked eating it with a sliced french baguette and tostitos but it woud be absolutely wonderful on anything.  It fit perfectly into a l0" round baking dish.  Baked at 350 for l/2 hr.  Thank you for this great creamy delicious spread!!  LOVE IT

It's good as is but I like to add a thin layer of cheddar on the top and broil at the end... delicious and looks a bit more interesting.  I also use 4 large fresh jalapenos instead of canned and bake at 375 for 20 minutes.  Absolutely amazing.  Oh, I find it faster and easier to puree the mayo with the peppers, and then use a hand mixer to whip the mayo mixture with the cream cheese - really mixes it well and gives it a silky smooth texture.

I would recommend tripling the amount of peppers in here, otherwise it just tasted like warm cream cheese.  If you don't want too much heat, do it with the chile peppers and not the jalapenos.

I made this to take to an office Christmas party.  Of the 6 women there, 5 immediately asked me for the recipe - it was THAT good.  So simple to make that I'm making it again this weekend for our Sunday School Christmas party!   I did use "real" parmesan cheese grated (not the green stuff in the can) and mixed it with 1/2 C. Panko bread crumbs and I think this made all the difference in the world!  I also baked mine in the office for a nice crispy topping instead of in the microwave.

Wow-this is a great recipe!  I stuck to the script, but with a little extra jalapenos, and I did mix the parm with some Panko bread crumbs.  I baked according to the direction's variation.  It was awesome!  Served it with thinly sliced and toasted french bread (way better than tortilla chips, which you think would be good...but not so much)!  I bet this would be awesome on little pieces of fry bread or fried sope bread!  I will make this again!

This dip is awesome! I combined bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese on top to give it a crust like real poppers. Definately bake it so it gets crunchy. I served it with bread and pretzels, the pretzels were my favorite!!

Sooo good - hot or cold!  I made it for a company potluck and had several requests for the recipe.   I did double the jalapenos to a 4oz can, and just stirred the parmesan cheese right into the spread.  I made it the night before and then just popped it in the microwave before the potluck. Served it with french baguette slices and tortilla chips.  Super easy and delicious!

I made this wih Tofutti nondairy cream cheese and it turmed out very well. So nice to find a dip that I can easily make lactose free! I put everything in a food processor but when I make it again, and I will, I would stir in some of the green chilis or minced jalapenos so that they are more visible. Based on other reviews, I topped with crushed crackers and baked it. Really very good!

Great recipe.  Tastes just like jalapeno poppers.  I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed 1/2 cup of panko (japanese bread crumbs) with the parmesan cheese.  Served with sliced french baguette.  Took it to a party recently and it was very popular.  Made it in a glass 8x8 pyrex dish. Baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  Next time I may add more jalapenos for a little more spice.

This was terrific. Everyone raved about it at my son's birthday party. Even the people who didn't think they would like it. I did do two things slightly differently, I only had fat free cream cheese and light mayo so I added a 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to increase the cheese flavor. I then topped with the parm. cheese but also a few breadcrumbs sprayed with Pam so that it browned up nicely. I think next time I would use full flavor ingredients (would have this time if I had them) and will skip the bread crumbs. I don't think they need them.

This is a go to for me.  I always have the ingredients on hand anyway so it is great last minute.  It is a 5 star as written.  I do make some changes because I can't seem to help myself.  I use 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo.  I also add some bacon bits. Ymmmm.  Thanks for the post.

This dip was a hit! Had alot of requests for this recipe, I made this for Thanksgiving appetizer. I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, sharp cheddar instead of parmesan, more jalapenos, and used a mix of seasoned bread crumbs mixed with melted butter for the topping before baking. I recommend using the sharp cheddar because it really tasted like poppers. I will be making this often, Thanks!

Not a fan.  I LOVE poppers, and I love dips, but the green chilies ruined this for me.  I tried upping the jalapenos and omiting the chiles, but that wasn't right either.  It  wasn't bad, just noy great.  i won't make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time on New Year's Eve.  I made only a half recipe as I had many other snack items on the menu. BIG MISTAKE!!  This was gobbled up in no time flat!  I served the spread with tortilla chips, as that is what I had on hand.  I did bake for 20 minutes at 400*F.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!

Great quick yummy appetizer.  I used a 7oz can of sliced jalapenos/drained and it wasn't too spicy.  Sprinkled with both the parmesan cheese and some toasted bread crumbs I made with french bread. (Tear the bread and pulse in the blender until fine and then toast dry on the stovetop.)
I had to take to a party the next day so I microwaved everything but the topping in a plastic bowl the night before. When I arrived at the party, I reheated in same bowl, then poured into pretty bright red dish and microwaved 2 minutes with topping.  Add whole jalapeno for presentation

Took this to a party last night and it was a huge success.  Realized at the last minute I only had Miracle Whip so used a half and half mix of Miracle Whip and sour cream.  Also added all of the juice from the jalapenos and green chilies because I was putting it in a crockpot and didn't want it to dry out.  I mixed all of the Parmesan into it and it lasted great for hours.

Would really give it about 4.5..
very easy to put together, used a whole small can of chopped chilis, 2 fresh jalapenos chopped finely. put in the 1/4 Cup parm cheese and served warm. Most people loved it, a few thought it could be hotter, but that would scare others away! Served with wheat crackers and triscuits. YUMM!

A HUGE hit, especially with teens and guys!  We spread it on pre-sliced baguette rounds.  To make it more like the deep-fried poppers in restaurants, I have been sprinkling the top with Italian breadcrumbs (enough to barely cover) and then spritzing that with butter spray, before baking.  This recipe is a must for the next game!

This is SO good!!!  A big hit at a little get-together last night - thanks for sharing the recipe.  I used 4 fresh jalapenos (seeded and chopped) and it was just right - a bit of kick for those who like it yet not overly strong for those who don't.  Sooooooo good!

Delicious!  Adjust the  amount of jalapenos to suit your taste.  I used freshly grated romano and subtituted sour cream for half the mayonnaise -- I wasn't trying to be creative, just using what I had on hand.  The dip was fantastic.  I will definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this, but no one in our family cared for it. I agree that mayo was overpowering. I added some cheddar cheese and hot sauce to it, but it didn't really help. I would pass on this one.

To celebrate the start of the football season my work had a contest to see who could make the best dip. I won! Apparently the big grand prize is a trophy for a year and "bragging rights". My department Director has been talking trash all week about how he was going to win. After I won I loudly bragged about it until he told me to leave early.


I used four fresh jalapeno's and one fresh green chili. Took out all seeds and gave them a quick hit in the mini food processor.  Mixed them together with the mayo and cream cheese and put in the fridge overnight. Next day covered with a mixture of panko bread crumbs and fresh Parmesan cheese before baking about 30 minutes at 350. People at work kept opening the oven while it was baking so the oven was most likely around 250 - 300 while baking.


Served with pieces of thinly sliced Baguette bread.


First, but definitely not last, time I will make this.

Thank you!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I was in a rush so wasnt able to read through all the reviews so I just microwaved it. Reading through the reviews, I will definately bake it next time (there will be a next time) and try the cheese and panko topping.  The only thing I changed up a bit was I love more heat so I added  10oz of canned jalapenos and I also added some canned artichoke hearts. Yummy!! Thanks for posting Denise.

ADDICTING is an understatement! I added a whole can of jalapenos & the whole can of chilis. I certainly didnt think it was too spicy. I did the panko breadcrumb & parmesan cheese mixture on top & baked. Wow! Took to a family party & it was gone instantly! Served with tortilla scoops. What a hit!

Very good and always a hit.  I make a half batch because it's not really good for you.  I use a mix of fresh and canned jalapeno for a little fresh flavor.  I have found that people like this better with toasted French bread or those tiny square cocktail toasts they sell in the deli.  This just doesn't seem to go well with tortilla chips.

This is the best dip!! It is the first thing to disappear when I make it for parties. Everyone always wants the recipe. I always add more jalapeños to the top. Gives it a little extra kick and also lets guest know that there are jalapeños in it. Making it to take to a party tonight.

I wanted a new recipe for our Girls weekend. Since it was just for me to try, and so many cooks used different ingredients than what was written, I wanted to test it both ways. I made half of the recipe-1 cream cheese,1/2 cup Mayo and 3 large fresh jalapenos w/ seeds. Mixed that up real good, then I split it in half. For the "original" one I added  some green chilies, freshly shredded parmesan and some breadcrumbs on top. For the other half I added some fresh garlic, cheddar cheese and only breadcrumbs on top. Baked at 375 about 30 minutes. I LOVED the original version!!  The cheddar cheese version was just ok. I ate it with fresh french bread (warmed but not toasted--tasted great with the bread soft & warm) and Tostitos Cantina Tortilla Chips...they are wonderful(extra thin and crispy)!! The original version has made it to the Girls Weekend! Thanks for sharing Denise! Original Version RULES!! And yes...it tastes like a popper!

Super-quick, inexpensive and delicious! Tasted just like jalapeño poppers. I made this for a party and it came together very easily and was a hit. So glad i didnt double the recipe though, makes plenty. I couldn't find canned jalapeños so I used about half a 15 oz jar of sliced jalapeños and diced them in the food processor. (be sure to use mayo, not miracle whip). I stopped at panera and got a French baguette sliced thin for $3, tortillas , veggies or crackers would work too.

I LOVE this recipe! My favorite way to make it is to get a bag of mini, multi-colored bell peppers (try the produce section or Trader Joe's), cut them in half, fill them with the spread and then sprinkle a mix of Parmesan and panko bread crumbs on top. Bake until warmed through and the cheese/bread crumb mix is crunchy - delicious!

I made a variation on this recipe that I absolutely loved.  I took this recipe and turned it into a mac and cheese.  

My grocery store didn't have canned diced jalapeno peppers, so I used 2 tbls of a jar of chopped and I diced them up myself.  I mixed it according to the directions but instead of putting it in the microwave I mixed it into a pan of macaroni noodles.  I put that mixture into a baking  pan and topped it with handfulls of shredded cheese and on top of that i liberally sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Baked on 350 for about 15 minutes and it was absolutely amazing! 

Thanks for this lovely recipe, I never would have thought of it myself!

I made this using a four ounce can of jalapeños.  It gave it a nice, medium flavor.  The beauty of this is you can add more or less jalapeños, depending upon the level of heat you'd like.  I also think adding some cooked, crumbled bacon to this would be heavenly.  I served this with a sliced baguette.

I loved this recipe and so did everyone else. I used fresh jalapenos and canned minced green chilies and jalapenos in the jar. Mixed fresh shredded parmesean cheese with Chipotle flavored panko crumbs for an extra kick. Wow! So good.

I'd give it 10 if I could.  I wasn't so sure about this one but followed as written (no sour cream, no onions, no bacon!) with the exception of using 5-6 fresh jalepenos chopped (because I had them)It gets devoured in a flash. I've tried a reader suggestion and added panko to the top - it was good too, but it doesn't need it.  I agree with the submitter, use fresh grated parmesan on top (yes, I thought it was weird too - it's not the same without it and green top jar stuff is a poor substitute)  
You have given us a new family fav.  Thanks so much!  (PS - having it tonight for dinner - oh my bulging thighs!)  SO worth it!

I guess I had very high expectations for this dip, based on all the reviews. It was good but not the best dip I've ever had. I did halve the recipe and I used the mayo/ sour cream combo along with some fresh jalapenos. Also added the bread crumbs to the cheese on top and baked it like everyone suggested.  Maybe it would be good as a filling for jalapenos (if you were to make your own). It just seemed to be missing something on its own. I will definitely try it again though.

Very easy and a huge hit at our Super Bowl party, with several requests for the recipe. Score! I made the following suggested changes: Fresh jalapenos to taste, Parmesan mixed into dip and sprinkled on top with Panko bread crumbs, baked at 400 degrees for 20 min. until browned (which people loved), served with toasted bagel chips. Enjoy! Thank You, Denise.

I made this dip to take to a Super Bowl party.  Unfortunately, no one there had ever tasted a jalapeno popper before.  Some were reluctant to try it for fear of the spiciness/heat.  I used 3 fresh jalapenos instead of the canned, and followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, then 1/2 of the grated parmesan mixed into the spread while the other 1/2 baked on top with some Panko crumbs blended with it.  Baked until brown on top at 350 for about 30 min. and served with toasted baguette slices.  While I thought the dip was pretty good, I was a bit disappointed.  According to the reviews, it was going to transcend me into another universe...that just didn't happen.  Sometimes reviewers go to the extreme with their reviews, sounding as if they have never eaten good food before!  It builds the  expectation for an out-of-this-world experience, which ultimately results in a bit of a let down.  It was good, but not heavenly.  UPDATE:This dip tasted much better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld overnight.  I would probably make this again, only I would blend it a day or two ahead of time and bake it on the day I want to serve it.

Delicious!  I have made this several times and it always gets great reviews and many requests for the recipe!  I do prefer to use freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  And I like to bake for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees for a better texture on the top.

Oh yeah! Though I did use the suggestions regarding the addition of Panko breadcrumbs, I can tell that this would be a five-star without it. Very good combination of flavors and great balance. The browned crust of bread crumbs and Parmesan... YUM! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is delicious!  I modified according to other suggestions by adding a handful of cheddar, but won't do it next time because it really doesn't need it; besides, the cheddar tends to separate from the rest of the creamier ingredients.  Very, very good!

My favorite!  I use shredded cheddar instead of Parmesan and I sprinkle the cheddar on top.  I make it in a pie plate so the melted cheese is on almost every bite.  Great with Ritz or Wheat Thins.

I have no words to describe how tasty this is! I am so happy this was posted. I LOVE jalapeno poppers but never make them because it's just time consuming. This has that yummy popper flavor and all its missing is the breading. I have served this on small toasted bread rounds, crackers, chips and my kids favorite... celery sticks. It's so easy to make and a great flavor. I make it like the recipe calls but we prefer to eat it after chilled over night. I also take some raspberry seedless jam and mix in a little cayenne pepper that I keep on the side, it adds a little fruity zip like some places have to dip the poppers in. Everyone loves this recipe!

This dip was hit and a easy dip to make! I used lowfat cream cheese and light mayo which I normally don't like but this dip was so good. I did add a little extra parmesan into the mayo cream cheese mixture and some on the top.

Tasty with just the right amount of spice. I replaced the canned jalapeño with a fresh one, and used half Parmesan and half habanero cheddar cheese for a little extra kick. I also cut the mayo in half to sneak it past a picky eater- which worked! I kept it in a little crock pot at the party so it would stay hot and not thicken up.

Declicious! This is going to be my new go-to dip recipe.  I did not make any changes to the mix.  The only thing I changed was sprinkling panko break crumbs on top along with shredded parmesan cheese (instead of grated).  Everyone loved it.  I cannot wait to make it again!

This is so easy to make. We love parmesan cheese so I added much more than was called for. Then I put more on top. I also added more jalapeno to it....twice as much!! Just a tad more mayonnaise made it creamier because of the extra ingredients I added. I popped it in the micro when we got to the party and it was gone in about 10 minutes flat. Great recipe!! Thanks Denise!

Had a great taste and could be used for other things such as on a bake potatoe as a toping. I used 8 fresh deseeded jalapeno peppers chopped fine. A little thick, I thinned it just a little.

Amazingly good! I did sprinkle panko bread crumbs on the top and bake in the oven like one review suggested. I put it in the crock pot to keep warm for serving. Rave reviews and and an empty dish at the office Christmas party! Thanks!

I have made this dip several times now & it is a hit every time!  I double the Jalepenos & top it with shredded parm mixed with bread crumbs.  I bake it at 350 for 25 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Serve with toasted french bread & Tostido Scoops.  Its amazing!!

This is a quick, easy, spicy dip.  I halved the recipe but used a full can of green chilies and jalapeños as we like it spicy.  Also, I used half light sour cream and half light mayonnaise.  Also, I doubled the cheese and mixed half with the mixture and used the other half on top.  I heated it in the microwave and everyone loved it.

Very good, I especially like it as a spread on bagels so I omit the topping. I just mix some of the freshly grated Parmesan cheese into the mix before baking. It's especially good toped with a little hot pepper jelly...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Make sure parmesan cheese is room temperature before baking otherwise it just becomes all crusty and not melty.  In other words if you refrigerate it for later baking, add the cheese/panko mixture to the top just before baking.

This deserves 6 stars. I used the canned chopped green chilies but since I have an over abundance of both jalapenos and serrano in my garden I minced up fresh ones, seeds and membranes NOT removed. Dear Lord this stuff was best served on a spoon. We couldn't leave it alone. I added a bit of fresh grated garlic and chopped cilantro.

GREAT AND EASY!!!  I tweaked the recipe a bit by using neufchatel instead of cream cheese and Olive Oil Mayonnaise, for a lower fat version.  I topped with the Panko (highly recommended), and Romano cheese instead of Parmesan since that is what I had on hand.  I would also recommend to use the 4 ounces of Jalapenos instead of the  2 that is called for.  I do not like spicy things and the 4 ounces was perfect for my delicate palate.  It was a hit at my football party, everyone loved it and wants me to bring it next time!

This is pretty  good.  Not over the top great but pretty good.  I have a party comming up next week and decided to give this a run by.  I never serve anything I haven't tried first.  People suggested canned Jalepenos and fresh Jalapenos so I split the recipie and tried both.  I also used a digital scale to measure ingrediants cause that is how I do things.

I preferred the canned Jalopenos because they were hotter but my wife preferred the fresh ones.  The real test was how did it taste the next day.  The fresh Jalapenos won but not by much but the real test was, can this be made a day ahead.  The answer is yes but bring it to room temp before you serve it.

Overall, It will be at the party but it is NOT knock your socks off.

This was a good dip for my men's prayer group get together. It didn't have too much of a "bite" and was very cheesy. Next time I may add more jalapenos, thats just my own preference.

Always a hit.  I use about 4 tablespoons jalapenos and then about 1/4 cup crumbled bacon or Jimmy Dean sausage.  Yummy!

This was wonderful! It was so tasty, though it didn't have much for spice, so I added a dash of cayenne pepper and Tapatio (hot sauce). The little bit gave it just the right flavor without overwhelming hot. So great with chips or bite bagets. Will use again.

Big hit at office party today.  People kept going back for seconds and ignored things like salsa and hummus that are usually very popular.

Made it exactly as written.  It was mild enough for everyone.  I put some jalapeños on the side so others could make theirs spicier if they liked.

This stuff is addicting!  I used 2 fresh jalapenos with the seeds (made it super spicy) and a large can green chili's.  I didn't have any breadcrumbs but highly recommend them as the cheese was very crusty and hard to break through.  Otherwise it was super!

Now the most popular dish I make for parties but I do make it differently.  I do 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, use diced nacho jalapenos and use Mexican blend shredded cheese, not Parmesan.

I've made this several times.  My family and friends love it.  I do not use the microwave.  after mixing together the creamed cheese, mayo, chilies and peppers, I put a handful of cheese (romano or parm) into the mixture, probably a good half cup.  then I spread the mixture into a pie pan.  Take another handful of cheese and stir it around in a bowl with a handful of panko bread crumbs.  Sprinkle this over the top and bake for about 30 minutes at 350 until golden on top.  It's great warm and also cold if you have any left over.

This dip is requested by almost everyone around the holidays and for potlucks at work. I always add more jalapeno for more spice and serve in a small crock pot with Frito scoops. The fritos are a great substitute for the deep fried outside of a typical jalapeno popper! Awesome dip!!!

What a great, easy, appetizer.  The only change I made was adding shredded cheddar cheese rather then parmasen cheese since most popper recipes called for it.  What was great is the ability to just add more jalapenos if you like it spicier. It was also good not warmed up, but at room temperature.  The jalapenos intensify with the warmth.  A make over for sure

So good and so addicting!  Once I make this I can't stop eating until it's gone.  I do spread mix the parmesan into the dip, spread it into a baking dish, top with panko bread crumbs and a little parmesan and then bake it until the crumbs are golden brown.  Yum!

Not sure why some people are saying this is greasy, mine turned out GREAT!! It was not greasy at all.Hubby said it is 7 stars and my neighbor had to leave otherwise she would have eaten it all. LOL I cannot personally rate this because I do not like cream cheese, mayo or jalapenos :( I did use only mayo and used 4oz jalapenos (hubby likes it hot) although he said it was not really hot even using the extra jalapenos. I did mix the panko and fresh parmeson, then put on top and sprayed with PAM and baked in oven. I am definitely going to be making this again. Hubby and neighbor both said it tasted just like jalapeno poppers!! thank you for such an easy and yummy recipe!! :)

Everyone else loved it, but I thought it was a bit rich.  Maybe would be good as a sandwich spread?  Easy easy easy to make!!

I will never buy poppers again! This dip is UNBELIEVABLE! The first time I made this recipe, I did so exactly as specified. It was REALLY good, but I tweaked it the next time using other posters advice and and it was perfect! I used fresh jalapeno peppers (enough to make just over a cup once chopped) omitted the green chilis (only because my grocer didn't have them in stock), used 3/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream, added the parmesan cheese to the cream cheese/mayo mixture, used panko crumbs on top - I feel this is the key to making it taste JUST like poppers, and made the day before eating (I found it was that much tastier the next day as the flavors had chance to really meld together)....OH MY!! I also agree that this dip is DELICIOUS cold! Will make this again and again!

This dip is perfect! Not too much heat, but just enough for a little kick! I've made this recipe 4 times in the past month and everyone loved it. I do this recipe x's 1 1/2 and it fits perfectly into a 9x9. I always bake mine in the oven for 350, like it's recommeneded to. And I also serve it with cripsy bread... it's a hit!!

Like so many have said - it really does taste like jalapeno poppers, only much easier to eat. Made it with only 1 block cream cheese, 4 oz green chilies, about 3 oz chopped jarred jalapenos, maybe 1/2 c light miracle whip; added about 1/2 c shredded cheddar in the mix. Topped w/ the canister parmesan (all I had), and panko crumbs sprayed w pam. Gone in a flash - we were divided over whether we preferred it on toasted baguette or tortilla chips - delicious on both! Thanks for an awesome recipe.

As others suggested, double the jalapenos.  I still thought that was tame but so good and totally acceptable at a party (not blazing hot).  Plain panko breadcrumbs on top are the perfect addition.

This is my favorite dip recipe on this site!  Served up with some club crackers, I can't get enough!  After numerous batches, the only changes I have made were to add two fresh jalapenos finely diced and cut the parmesan in half.  Absolutely fantastic!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent!  I made this for a party and everyone loved it.  I added half of the parmesan to the cream cheese mixture and blended the other half with panko and sprinkled on top.  Instead of microwaving it, I baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes.  Served with tortilla chips.  Everyone kept talking about how addictive it was!

Best 'go-to' appetizer EVER.  Everyone loves this!  So easy to make and because it's microwaveable, you can take it along to a a party.  I use the full 4oz. of jalapenos and use 1/2 C. shredded Parmesan cheese and 1/2 C. grated Parmesan cheese.  I put a handful of the cheese mix in the popper mix and the rest on top.  FABULOUS!  Thank you!

WOW!! Amazing!  I love jalapeno poppers with cream cheese and this really does taste like them! I did the revisions that the 1st reviewer suggested: Mix the 1 c. parmesan with 1/2 c. panko crumbs, sprinkle on top, then bake at 375 for 25 minutes. I also used her suggestion of toasted french bread - awesome!

This dish was really very tasty.  I made it for a gathering and everyone devoured it.  Per other reviews, I used 4 fresh jalapenos.  I also used 1/2 cup of panko breadcrumbs along with the Parmesan cheese and baked at 375 degrees for 20 mins.  Served with baguette slices.  YUM.....

I just took 2nd place out of 13 dips at an office party using this recipe.  I mixed it up the night before and the day of the party I put the parmesan cheese on top and then used a kitchen blow torch to brown the cheese since we didn't have an oven at work.  I served it with sliced french baguette, untoasted.

This got rave reviews.  I thought it would have been even better with a whole drained can of jalapenos.  It was very good.  I used the low-fat cream cheese and it was fine.

UPDATE:  I have brought this to several parties since my first review and it is ALWAYS a winner, and gone so fast I usually can't get any.  My only alteration is that I use the whole 4 oz of jalapenos. 

===============

Made this cold for my company potluck.  Needless to say, 8 people asked for the recipe.  We had probably 20 different dishes but this dip was the super hit.  Thanks for sharing.  PS, since we have only 1 microwave and 30 employees I served it cold without heating and it was still #1!!

I follow this recipe exactly except for using a 7 ounce can of green chiles and light cream cheese. I also stir in all of the parmesan cheese to avoid a crusty top from the microwave. I prefer baking it in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes until it bubbles on the sides. This is frequently requested by family members.

This was AMAZING!!  I took this app to a ladies evening in my neighborhood.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  My changes: I couldn't find chopped jalapenos at my grocery so I bought a 7.75 oz. jar of jalapeno slices for nachos and chopped them up myself.  I used about 3/4 of the jar so I figure I used about 6 oz.  The dip was not too hot and quite honestly probably just right, though I might tempt fate next time and use the whole jar!  I creamed the mixture the night before and put in refrigerator overnight.  I took out 1 hour before baking. I used real shredded parm cheese which I tossed with 1/2 c panko bread crumbs.  I topped the filling with the bread crumb cheese mixture and then generously sprayed it with olive oil Pam to ensure a crispy topping.  I baked in 400 oven until internal temp registered 165.  Then I broiled for 2 minutes.  I baked and served this in a shallow Corningware dish.  I served with French bread toasts that I prepared myself - slicing the bread, brushing with olive oil and sprinkling with kosher salt before crisping in a 450 oven.  Oh!  SO AMAZING!

I don't know if I messed something up but I had high hopes for this recipe and was disappointed.  The flavor was very bland.

I have made this recipe several times over the last few years and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  I have never made any alterations to it until yesterday and I would like to share.  I added a box of defrosted frozen chopped spinach and omited the parm cheese and it turned out fantastic.  I really make this recipe all the time so if it is your first time follow the exact original directions and next time if you'd like somthing different try the spinach!

OK...My tweak is that I roast fresh jalapenos on the grill, till golden not burnt,( you can broil them) seed and dice them. Forget mayonaise and go for light sour cream and light cream cheese. Mince a 2-4 teaspoons fresh onion, finely grate some cheese,(cheddar or Monteray Jack are my faves). A a couple of tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro. Mix it all together & chill...Now if you want to get exotic, mix in some chopped cooked shrimp and serve it in a papaya, canatlope. Serve it with cucumber strips or fruit wedges. the cool & hot compliment each other very well.

quick and easy to make and it tastes just like Jalapeño Poppers.  I used several fresh peppers in place of the canned.    The only down side to this recipe is its looks, it just doesn't look very good, but it does taste good.    Use a shallow baking dish for this recipe, so the dip is spread about one inch or so deep.

Wonderful dip. I did bake it in the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes instead of using the microwave since my microwave caught fire and burned up last week. LOL. Definitely a keeper.

My husband and I made this recipe for the first time as a appetizer for dinner guests. What a hit!! We used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, and topped it with shredded mild cheddar and baked it. Next time will stir in the cheddar instead so every bite has cheddar and dips easier too.

Great, excellent!!! Have made several times. I too bake mine for about 30 minutes, with fresh parmesan on top and bread crumbs. Definately good with Round buttery crackers.  I've lately been mixing in some cheddar cheese with the cream cheese/sour cream and that is an excellent additions. I usually double the jalapenos and its not too hot. The great thing is you can make this however you like, hot or mild, depending on your preference. Everyone asks for this recipe. You will not be dissapointed.

Oh my! This was a-mazing! The flavors melded perfectly together and really did taste like a popper. I used panko bread crumbs and freshly grated parm on top as suggested. I could've eaten the whole darn thing. A must for any party!

I made this last Sunday for my Super Bowl "Party of One". So, I cut it in 1/2 using 1 pk. cream cheese, 1/4 c. mayo, and 1/4 c. sour cream. But when I added the peppers, I also thought it didn't have enough of a "kick", so I threw in an entire 4oz. can of both the chiles and jalapenos.  It does get hotter as it sets, but still not overpowering.  I mixed a bit of grated parm in with the dip, but then topped it with 1/2 c. grated parm and 1/2 c. of Panko bread crumbs.  This was my first time using Panko bread crumbs and they are wonderful--gave the dish a really nice appearance.  I baked it at 375 for 30 mins and then broiled it til the bread crumbs were lightly browned.  This was my "test run" and I am making this dip again for our church's Souper Bowl of Caring mission project wrap-up.  I'm sure it will be a big hit!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Definately tasted like a Jalapeno Popper!  I used freshly grated parm - 1/2 in mix & 1/2 on top.  Topped w/combination of parm, panko and olive oil.  Only thing - the store was out of canned jalapeno so I had to use fresh.  I used 2 1/2 and scraped the seeds for fear it'd be too spicy.  Could've safely doubled it.  You could taste the jalapeno but there was no real kick.  Everyone loved it though :)  Great recipe.  Thanks!

Oh my goodness this was sooo good!  Everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  Of course I had to make a few changes-used half sour cream and half mayo, as I am not a huge mayo fan and other reviewers had success that way.  Also I used 5 fresh jalapenos finely diced, used panko crumbs with the parmesan, and baked it in the oven.  This is going in the family recipe book!

The only reason I give this recipe 5 stars is because it tastes exactly like its suppose to.  Now having said that, it is a little to rich for me with the cream cheese and mayo.  I used it as a dip with tortilla chips and I think next time I will use it as a spread (as intended) on bagels or garlicky toast.

This was excellent!  I have to admit that it was difficult to not devour the entire dip myself!  I've made the baked variation several times using fresh jalapenos and adding a bit of extra cheese.  Fantastic!  Thank you for this gem of a recipe!

This was delicious. I made it for the first time and took it to our annual family Christmas party last night. NO LEFTOVERS. I did as others had recommended and combined 1 c. grated parm. cheese w/ 1 c. Panko bread crumbs. I baked it 30 mins., then put it under the broiler for approx. 3-5 mins (just until it was a light brown). It created a yummy, crunchy topping...just like an actual popper. Served w/ Wheat thins, but I'm sure it would have been great w/ Triscuits or toasted french bread. Packs a little punch too.

WOW! My husband and I both LOVED this recipe! After reading all of the reviews, particularly the review by the original recipe submitter, I decided to make the spread according to the recipe the first time. It was absolutely delicious. Many of the changes made by other reviewers, such as adding other cheeses or additional seasoning, are sure to be delicious but just make this into a jalapeno cheese dip. If you want the authentic popper taste, follow this recipe. We did add 4 oz of jalapenos as the recipe submitter said in her review that she does. I am sensitive to spicy food and this was a little too hot for me, so next time I will make it with only 3 oz of jalapenos. Also, as the spread cooled, the layer of parmesan on top did kind of toughen up, so next time I will stir 1/2 or more of the parmesan into the spread and then sprinkle the rest on top. We ate the spread on sliced, toasted baguette and also tried it with Ritz crackers. I highly recommend the sliced baguette. This spread is sure to be a hit at social gatherings! I will make it again and again.

We really enjoyed this dip.  It is very good (even though my brother called it "a heart attack waiting to happen." :-)  I served it with tortilla chips and the salty chips were great with the spicy spread.  I eyeballed the jalapenos and also chopped up a fresh jalapeno and put most into the dip, then left a few slices for garnish.  I might use a little more peppers next time.  I added about 1/2 cup of sharp chedder to the spread and then sprinkled some on top.  I'm glad I used some cheddar.  I also added a dash of garlic powder and may add more next time.  Although this dip was good, next time I may do 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. sour cream instead of the 1 c. mayo.  Try this spread.  You won't be disappointed!

A winner. Warm, creamy, with a kick. Works as a dip/appetizer but also as a sandwich spread. All the yummy goodness of a jalapeno popper without the mess of a biting into one and having fiery hot cream squirt into your mouth. Delicious!

YUMMY!  Used low fat mayo, low fat cream cheese, freshly grated parm, 1 small can of green chile's and 2 of the jalapeno's including the juices for more flavor, a dash of onion powder and garlic powder.  Toasted panko bread crumbs with some parmesan cheese until golden brown.  Took it all to work in separate containers.  Then I microwaved the dip until bubbly hot.  Then I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top.  Served with tortilla chips and toasted baguette.  Tasted very rich despite the low fat version!  Winner!!!

This is so good!!! I'll add extra peppers or red pepper flakes the next time for a little more kick! I used pita pockets cut into 8 triangles, spread lightly with olive oil and lightly sprinkled with canadian steak seasoning or herbs. Then baked in oven until lightly toasted. You can make them ahead of time. They were so good and a great addition to the dip! Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for our weekly poker party last night.  Served it with toasted baguette bread from the "day old" rack at Walmart.  Everyone loved it!  The only change I made was to add a generous splash of pepper sauce. It really seemed to bring out the flavor and cut back on the richness of the cream cheese.

As good as everyone says, I served it for dinner guests and brought the leftovers to work and I gave the recipe to many colleagues! I served it at home w/ thinly sliced baguette but since I didn't have any of that left I just grabbed a bag of pretzels and we smeared it in the spread... yummy!

I made this for a family get-together today and everyone loved it. I just now noticed that I didn't follow the recipe exactly--I used an 8 oz can of sliced jalapenos that I whizzed in the food processor and no green chiles--not sure how I got that out of reading the recipe, but it was delicious. I'm so glad to find this recipe--it will go on my do-again list!

I thought this spread was wonderful, and has been a huge hit both times I have made it now.  I used the whole can of jalpenos, cause I like it hot, and only about half the parm cheese on top.  1 cup seemed like an awful lot to me.

This was a definite hit at my Christmas party, and I have no doubt that the recipe is absolutely delicious as written.  But I did vary mine a bit.  I omitted the mayonnaise and just used the cream cheese.  I used 2 4-oz cans of diced jalapenos and 1 4-oz can of green chilis.  I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and omitted the parmesan.  I served it with tortilla chips and everyone went home with the recipe.  Thanks for the great dip recipe!

Yummy. This does taste just like poppers, but without the work! I used fresh jalapenos, added some cheddar, and just mixed in the parmesan cheese. Put in the micro for 45 seconds, then sprinkled with panko bread crumbs and broiled for a minute. Served with blue tortilla chips. Fabulous. Gone in minutes. Will make again.

If you like Jalapeno Poppers, you will absoutely LOVE this recipe! I used all jalapenos (6oz) and no green chilies. Also, I only used about 3/4 cup of parm cheese. I topped it off with bread crumbs and baked it. Based on other reviews, I added about half a cup of mozzerella cheese...Bad idea, it made it very very oily. The dip was still delicious, but next time, I won't add the mozzeralla cheese. Can't wait to make this again!!

I've made this quite a few times this summer!  It's a big hit.  I did change it up the last 2 times that I made it though and used a 6oz can of chicken breast in it.  I also upped the chopped jalapenos for more spice!!    VERY YUMMY!

As I put this recipe together I was not sure about it.  I made it for a large family gathering.  This was a huge success!!  I have been asked to make for other occassions and have been asked for the recipe.  My only mistake was not making a double batch.

Followed the recipe to the letter and ended up bringing home an empty dish. Only addition was extra jalapenos and some Panko breadcrumbs. Delish!!
Update: made this another of times and have had success every time. I add 1/2 cup parm to the cream cheese / mayo mix and then top with another 1/2 cup mixed with 1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs. Also 4 oz of Jalapenos. Bake covered and then uncover last 5-10 mins to brown.

So yummy!  I brought this to a football party and it was a huge hit.  I baked it for 25 minutes at 350 instead of microwaving which gave the parmesan a nice crust and I added 4 oz of jalapenos. I'll definitely make it again.

I think it's fair to rate this, even though I made some minor changes. I followed the advice of a couple of other reviewers and used 6 (picked right from the garden!) jalapeños, chopped and mostly seeded. I also melted about 2 TBS butter, which I mixed with about 1/2 cup panko crumbs and the fresh Parmesan, and then topped the cheese mixture with the buttery crumb mixture. I baked the dish at 375 F for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown and heated through. I only had Ritz crackers, but we could hardly stop ourselves from finishing the whole plate in one sitting! Thanks for an easy, marvelous recipe!

Great dip that really does taste just like jalapeno poppers! Mixing half a cup of bread crumbs with fresh parmesan on top and baking in the oven makes it perfect.

New to this website and this my first review.  Recipe sounded very easy and also delicious. Finally made this tonight. I  followed the directions, only thing I did was add the whole can/4oz of Jalapeños because I mean, we are mexican, we like spicy. Got everything mixed in, sprinkled top with cup of parmesan cheese and I left it in the fridge  about 45 min, I wanted the jalapeno flavor to mix really good. I then put in microwave for 3 min and my kids were in the kitchen while in the microwave because of the delicious smell. It was amazing, everybody loved it. The only thing I will do differently is add more jalapeños because I want a lil bit more punch. Thanks!

Delish! I baked this, used 6 fresh jalapenos, and left out the chilies just because we didn't have them. My family loved it. I will add the chilies next time, we would have liked it just a little spicier. But we like super spicy foods. Great find!

I've made this probably 100 times. My family is obsessed, right when it's done we stand around the bowl like hungry wolves and devour it. Definitely use toasted french bread, we've tried chips but it just isn't as good. I use fresh parmesan on top and omit the grated parmesan. Every time I make this I'm asked for the recipe.

Amazing!  Have had it requested at three different events this week.  I skip canned everything and remove seeds first then blanch jalapeno's fresh.  I added extra 1/4 C sharp cheddar, 1/4 tsp jalapeno seasoning and topped with panko and bake for that crispy touch.  For those hard core hot budded souls, I made a relish with the seeds and inner's from the jalapeno:  run jalapeno seeds and rinds through processor for a few seconds and add 1/4 cup each of water, rice vinegar, fish sauce and 1 TBSP sugar, 1 TBSP Lemon or Lime juice.  Just a dab on top of spread, Very hot but incredibly good!

This is a great, fast easy recipe. I made this 2'x so far, both times left with an empty container.  Was told this was the "hit of the party" as far as the food.

Tastes great and easy to make! I added about 1 1/2 tsp of lime juice for added flavor.

I soften the cream cheese in the microwave first.  I also add a squirt of Sriracha sauce and pepper.  My husband loves this dip with tortilla chips

This is a simple yet delicious recipe. I followed as instructed with the exception of the Jalapenos, added more as I like things spicy. Also I didn't have the full amount of parmesan cheese needed and added sharp cheddar. Everyone at my Christmas dinner raved about this recipe. I think the key to this dish is to use real cheese. I served with both pita chips and tortilla chips. I think the consensus was that it was better with tortilla chips. Definitely a keeper!

I added 1/2 of a finely diced jalapeno pepper. maybe next time i will only use fresh and omit the can altogether. I mixed a 1/2 cup shredded Parmesan to 1/2 up Panko and sprinkled on the top before baking in a small cast iron skillet. Served with toasted baguette. Everyone loved it.

Made the day before with 4 ounce can diced jalapenos, but without the parmesan. Next day mixed 1/4 cup parmesan with the dip. Mixed remaining 3/4 cup parmesan with 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs. Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Warmed French baguette slices to go with it. Spicy, creamy, and delicious!

Oh my - who knew such simple ingredients could be so good!!  Very easy to make and I did add some bread crumbs on top as some people suggested, but other then that, followed recipe exactly.  I did mix 1/2 of the freshly grated parmesan in the mixture and then spread the other 1/2 on top.  My husband refused to try it at first because he doesn't like the jalapeno poppers, but then he gave in and couldn't get enough! So far we have only eaten with tortilla chips and that was fantastic!  I am sure is good with bread and such as others have suggested.  It's a must try and I will be making many times again!

I made this in a mini-crockpot instead of baking.  Yummy! I did what other people suggested- doubled the jalapenos, used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, and used cheddar instead of parmesan.  Next time, I will add some pepper jack cheese and delete the green chiles (they made the dip too tart and overpowered the other flavors.)

Not good! Was thick and I didn't think it tasted like a Jalapeno popper. Not worth wasting the cream cheese on this spread.

This spread is incredibly good. Used Cubanelles and jalapenos from my garden, roasted. The roasting of the peppers gave them a nice smooth taste and texture yet still having heat. Love that good char taste from the grill. I swapped out the Parmesan Cheese with shredded Monterey  Jack. The Monterery was so so good but eliminating the Parm also eliminated the salt element that the spread needs so I garnished this with crumbled bacon. I baked off Phyllo Tart Shells, heated the spread, filled the tarts and garnished with bacon crumbles. WOW Thanks for sharing Denise.

This is perfect as is! Sometimes I add extra jalapenos and panko on top, but other times I just make it as written. I always serve it with soft, Italian bread, torn into bite size pieces and Wheat Thins.

Delicious!  I used 6 fresh jalapenos from my garden, but I removed the seeds and membranes and I think next time I will either use the whole pepper or use more peppers because the dip was very mild.  I followed the recommendations of others and used 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream, and added some cheddar to both the dip and mixed it with the fresh parm on top.  I didn't have any breadcrumbs but we didn't mind the "cheese crust" that formed.  We tried it with cucumber slices and that was tasty, but our favorite was Italian bread, thin-sliced and toasted (the store was out of French bread).  Thanks for this great recipe!

Just love this recipe. Whole family loves it too. We eat it with either chips or celery sticks. So more like a dip. Only things different I do is keep out the parmesan cheese. Also I add some of the juice from the jalapenos to give it some kick. Friends and family love it when I bring it to parties too.

I make this dip often and always get rave reviews! I decided on day to see how this would taste as a mexican inspired mac n' cheese. My guests loved it! All I did was stir in cooked mini seashell pasta to make a really tasty side dish! Bake in oven until bubbly.

This dip takes just like a jalapeno popper!  Going to add more jalapenos next time as I did think it was a litle mild.  Will be my stand by dip if I need something for a party.

This was a big hit at a superbowl party I attended. It definitely had a bite to it, even though i de-seeded all the jalapeños.... I left it in the fridge for a few days after and tried it again, and it was almost too spicy to enjoy! Used ritz crackers as dippers and they complimented the dish well.

I've made this dip SO many times and even after its gotten cold people still attack it :) I usually add a cup of shredded Chedder or pepperjack to the mix and reserve the parm to mix with the breadcrumbs on top. I do bake it instead of micro, I usually broil for 5 min so the top gets crispy. Overall very good base for a dip that you can add your own twist to for those who like it muy caliente :)

I've made this three times now, and all three times it got rave reviews. The last time I made it, a friend  of mine actually heaped a spoonful of this onto her plate and ate it with a spoon not knowing you were supposed to eat it with the supplied crustinies, and she loved it!!!

Fantastic - Everyone loved it. French bread toasted was the best, buttery crackers were OK. I lefted the party with a empty dish and everyone wants the recipe. Followed recipe didn't change a think, I did combine the parmesan cheese with panko crumb for the topping and toasted in over till light brown. Great Recipe - Thanks!

This spread was such a hit at a superbowl party and also at work.  I used two cans of jalapenos, it gave the spread a kick but was not too hot.  I will be making this again and again.

The beautiful grandaughter and I decided to go on a cascade of wonderful creaminess and delight. This is the recipe we chose. It did not disappoint ! Be warned ,it is quite rich and oh so yummy yummy. So give this one a try and if you want to top it off add some grated montery jack cheese on top and slip under the broiler for a little bit of browning .

This was great.  The guys made short work of it during the football game.  And, much easier than making the popper themselves.  Thank you for sharing.

just kind of blah - made it with a buffalo chicken dip which has so much flavor - which is maybe why this one was so bland tasting. Probably wouldnt' make it again.

This is delicious!! From the reviews I mixed half the parm into the dip and mixed the rest with 1/2 cup panko to sprinkle on top. Then baked it for 20 min or so at 350. I also used 6 fresh jalapenos that I sauteed a few minutes first instead of the canned chiles.

Perfect recipe - easy and delish! And not as spicy as i feared. I used pickled jalapenos since that's what i had, and i cut out the veins & seeds. Just the right amount of zing. And go through the effort to bake this.

While it did taste like jalapeno poppers, it did not wow anyone who had it.  This was the only appetizer I served for a superbowl party that didn't need to be replenished.  I really wanted to like it seeing as there were so many fantastic reviews.

Made this for Super Bowl party, omitted the mayo but will probably use the hint for sour cream. Had a selection of crackers and it was a big hit! Also, stuffed some fresh jalapenos and wrapped with bacon and baked until the bacon was crisp. This was the best stuffing I had ever used for peppers. This is a double plus for me!

Very good dip.  Made exactly as stated.  At first I used only 2 ounces of jalapeno.  That didn't have enough "kick" so I added the rest of the can, for a total of 4 ounces of jalapeno.  Tasted alot better, but still wasn't quite right.  I think when I make it again I will make sure the jalapeno peppers are chopped up real fine, instead of how they were chopped straight from the can.  If they were more finely chopped, the pepper flavor would be more consistent throughout the entire dip.  In my opinion it would be more like a "popper" that way.  I also will try baking the cheese, maybe with some bread crumbs as others have suggested...just to get the crispy popper experience!

I have to say I was surprized at the high star rating.  I found the dip to be extremely bland.  I was kinda sad as I had high hopes...maybe I had bad jalapenos.

This was okay.  I put the entire 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos, but I think I cooked it at too high a temp in the oven so it separated.  It was tasty, though and worth a repeat, but I will half the recipe.

Fantastic!!! I did bake it instead of microwave and added panko bread crumbs to the parmesean like the other reviewers suggested. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. There were 5 people at the party and this 32 serving recipe was barely enough!!!!

I took some other reviewers' advice and put 1/3 of the cheese into the dip, added 1/2 cup of panko on top (sprayed with e.v.o.o.) and baked at 350.  I like this and got good reviews on it from my guests.

After all the rave reviews, I could hardly wait to make this.  I followed the recipe exactly and was somewhat disappointed.  Wasn't crazy about the Parmesan cheese so will try Pepper Jack next time, or omit the cheese altogether, as I do not care for "warm" spreads. I did use a full can of diced jalapenos and will actually use more next time, as living in NM, we really like everything spiced up!

I've made this dip many times, I was just wondering if you guys use the canned parmesan or freshly grated from a block?

Love this Dip!!  Have customized it to my tastes but original recipe still awesome!  I use 1/2 c SourCream, 1/2 cup Mayo, Add 1 or 2 fresh jalepenos diced(I still use the canned too), double the green chiles.  I mix all ingredients, microwave and then keep warm in crock pot.  YUMMO!

This is WONDERFUL!!!  Big hit at the office pitch in.  I've had many requests for the recipe. I mixed 1c of the cheese into the dip and used an additional 1/2c mixed with Panko crumbs for the top.  I made it all in my smaller crock pot to keep it warm.  Will be making this again and again.

This has to be my all time favorite dip recipe and I make it any time I get the chance.  I've even just used sandwich bread for dipping when I made this last minute with things on hand.  So Good!

I'm not sure where I went wrong with this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but what I ended up with was an intensely salty dip that was inedible with tortilla chips.  I ended up adding a cup of sour cream the second day and we were able to eat the dip, but not a hit with my family.

VERY GOOD DIP!! I HAVE MADE IT THE WAY THE RECIPE CALLS FOR, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ADDING THE BREAD CRUMBS TO THE TOP. I HAVE ALSO MADE IT USING THE OTHER VARIATION PEOPLE RECOMMENDED BY USING THE FRESH JALAPENOS. I WILL HAVE TO SAY THE ORIGINAL RECIPE WAS SO MUCH BETTER! I USED 6 GIANT JALEPENOS AND IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS NO FLAVOR AT ALL. JUST STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL RECIPE WHEN MAKING!!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I only made slight changes to it.  I added Panko bread crumbs on top and the parmesian cheese and then baked it until it was hot.  I seemed a little runny when I took it out but the consistency was great as it cooled.  Also, I used real jalapeno pepper (3) but took out the seeds and membrane and although I love hot this was good for anyone...just perfect.  My guests loved it!  I made it the day before and put in the refrigerator and only popped it in the oven as guests were arriving...This is a KEEPER!

Everyone in my family LOVED this!  My family love spicy food, and they gobbled it up with garlic pita chips.  I also served tortilla chips, but they seemed to prefer the pita chips with it.  The cup of mayo seemed daunting to me, so I used about 2/3 c mayo with 1/3 c sour cream instead.  Also added a FULL four ounce can of jalapenos plus a few left in the bottom of a jar I had.  My family likes hot stuff, and it was indeed hot.  Really does taste like poppers!  Thanks for a new "keeper" recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on my alterations.  I could not find a can of chopped jalapenos so I purchased the jar of pickled ones.  Not sure how the pickled jalapenos would taste I opted to put in 3 fresh chopped jalapenos.  Despite the fresh jalapenos and the can of chili peppers, the dip needed more bite to it so I added about a dozen of the pickled jalapenos and about a TBS of the juice from the jar.  I also added about a TBS of Romano cheese (I didn't have parmesan on hand) to the mixture.  After the dip was heated through, I added the bread crumbs (with some cheese mixed in) and broiled it until toasted on top.  It was delicious and everyone loved it!

The only changes I made to this recipe was I used 2 (4 oz) cans of green chilies, threw in some shredded monterey jack and on the top I used panko, shredded parm and shredded monterey jack.  I could have eaten the whole plate of dip myself!  Excellent!  This is definitely my new "go-to" appetizer.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for Christmas appetizer and it was just ok...need to use crusty bread and not a thin chip as it is a little thick. I will make again and try some ideas from previous reviews, it does need baked, but needs more flavor from somewhere, just not quite sure where yet...so I just gave it 3 stars.

Ok, so I used a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies, chopped them finer. Then added a handful of fresh chilies, I like spice. I also topped it with the bread crumb and Parmesan cheese topping. I kept some of this mixture to the side and stuffed mushrooms with it. SO GOOD! I pulled out the stems to the mushrooms and sauteed them with a little red onion and mixed it with the cream cheese. I sauteed the whole mushrooms for a few minutes, then added the cheese mixture and baked in oven at 350 for five minutes. 

Delicious. Btw, this is my absolute favorite dip. I LOVED IT! I devoured it.

This dip is awesome! I made it for my son's birthday party and it was completely gone. I had lots of requests for this recipe.  I used hot green chiles, a 4oz can of diced jalapenos, 1 fresh jalapeno chopped, mixed in half of the parmesan cheese then topped with the remaining parmesan and topped that with panko bread crumbs. I baked it in the oven until bubbly. I tried serving it with tortilla chips, but didn't really care for it that way but then served it with pita chips and that was way better!

Made this with the cheese on top and baked (per author's variant). Was quite tasty, although I think it could have used even more cheese on top.

Fantastic recipe. I added a 1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella cheese to this and baked in the oven at 325 degrees for a 1/2 hour.  Would make this again in for sure.

This dip is so easy and so good!!!!  First time I made it I used the microwave method and it was good, 2nd time I mixed 1 cup of Parmesan cheese with 1/2 cup of plain bread crumbs, baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and it was AWESOME!!!!!  I used the Parmesan cheese from the dairy, not fine parmesan that is used on spaghetti.

Excellent!! I used half sour cream and half mayo, one can of chiles, and 3 jalapeno peppers. I mixed some bread crumbs (will use less next time) in with parmesan/asiago cheese and baked in an 8x8 pan at 350 for about half an hour. Will definitely make again!

This was ok, but tasted exactly like the ingredients it contained.  A bunch of mildly spicy cream cheese and mayo.

Go ahead and dump the WHOLE 4 ounce can of jalapenos in this dip (drain them first, of course). This wasn't spicy at all, and I think the extra jalapenos would help it a bit. I loved it though, I served it with triscuits and slices of a fresh baguette.

We love this recipe.  I use fresh diced jalapenos (2-3, depending on who is eating it) and fresh diced anaheim peppers (3 or 4).  I also use a cup of japanese bread crumbs mixed with the parmesan cheese on top, and bake rather than microwave.  Delicious!!!

I was skeptical at first because it tasted very much like mayo when it was cold.  I took it for a work potluck, threw the ingredients in a small crock pot to make/keep it hot and stirred in the parmesan cheese instead of putting it on top.  Served it with garlic melba rounds.  A hit!

This dip was delicious!  Tasted just like a popper!  It was a big hit at our party.  I had a jar of diced jalapenos in my fridge I used instead of the 2oz can.  And I know I added more than what was called for.  But it was some seriously good dip!

This is soooo good. It's so simple and everyone loves it. Unlike spinach dip and some cheese dips, this dip is good even after it cools to room temperature. I serve with baguette slices or Wheat Thins.

I was disappointed with this recipe--especially seeing that there were over 2000 reviews and a 5 star rating.  I just didn't think it was very tasty.  I added more jarred jalapenos and two fresh ones.  I'm not a big fan of cream cheese.  I would never take this to a party.

This has got to be the easiest recipe ever!  I did double the jalapenos, used "Hot" green chilies and half mayo to half sour cream.  Served with baked pita chips and my friends griped for days that they couldn't stop eating it (it is a little on the fattening side)!  

I saved a little and mixed with scrambled eggs the next morning!

Awesome!  Added sausage, cooked and grinded.  Also added more jalapenos, as we like it hot and spicy, prob about 3 times as much, grinded. Everyone loved it.  Will make again!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  I made this for a tailgate party yesterday and there was not a DROP left!  I did it in a crockpot on low for 3 hours - used 4 oz of canned jalepenos and served with triscuits.  It was a huge hit!!!

very dissapointed. i make a version of this for spread on burgers but this had such high reviews that i thought id give it a try. all you can taste is mayo, its gross. i put bacon in it, and that didnt even help. i think i will stick to mine which gets awesome reviews. soft cream cheese, fresh jelapenos, and a little garlic salt.

revision: i didnt want  to waste this so i fixed it. add green onion, chipotle powder, minced garlic, and some pepper. made it taste way better.

I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be from the other reviews, but this is still a pretty good dip. I believe the problem was that I didn't have mayo so I used Miracle Whip instead. The Miracle Whip was kind of overpowering. When I make this again I will reduce the Miracle Whip and I might try using some sour cream in the mix too. Another thing I changed was I mixed some of the parmesan into the dip and put the rest on top. I agree with the other reviewers about increasing the amount of jalapenos. I was afraid to use more than the recipe called for but next time I will add a few more so it has more zip. I served with tortilla chips and pita chips. I preferred the tortilla chips but some preferred the pita chips - both were good. I will be keeping this recipe!

I'm going to jump on the bandwagon... yes, this really IS that good and this easy.  I made it mostly as presented: just cut the amount of peppers in half, since I am not good with a lot of spices.  But even with that cut down, they still give this dip a wonderful flavor.  I also mixed some cheddar-jack cheese in with the parmesan on top, and added the Panko crumbs others have suggested.  I also sprinkled a little paprika on top for color.  Baked it for 20 min. at 450. My young adult son asked me yesterday if I could make some cheese dip just for the family.  This is so different than what we usually make, that I wasn't sure it would be what he had a taste for.  He took one taste and said, "Oh, yeah! This is exactly what I was after, I mean, it's better than I was after!"

Addictive appetizer and sooooo easy to make!  I tried several versions of this recipe and preferred with 2 fresh (including seeds)and 2 oz. canned jalapenos as well as bake with panko mixed in with the parmesan. Toasted baguette added nice texture to the final dish.

This was delicious and easy. I used a 7 oz can of chopped green peppers and probably more than 2 ounces of jalapeno peppers. By mistake I mixed the Parmesan cheese in the cream cheese mixture. I sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs over the top and baked in the oven. I spread the dip on toasted home-made baggette slices and I don't know how it could have tasted more delicious!!!

It was great - my son who is a chef (and hard to please) really liked it too!!  Used 4 oz of diced jalapeon's and will go to 6 oz next time.  Just a little more kick would be pleasant!!  Good Good Good!!!

Yes, this dip is yummy! I would leave out half of the Parmesan next time and add more jalapenos. Tried it with Keebler Buttercrisps but I bet this would be yummy on a bagel.

Yum! Made this for a football party. It was a hit! As others suggested I added more than 2 oz of canned jalapenos. I used 1 8oz low fat cream cheese and 1 regular. I also used low fat mayo. Otherwise made as written. I think the extra jalapenos made up for any flavor lost with the low fat ingredients Will definitely make again.

Big hit...I took it to a party & it was gone in no time. I had a guy actually tell his wife he wanted to marry me because of the dip & asked if she would mind another wife. LOL

Followed recipe exactly.  Very tasty and it was the first dish to go empty at the party, as in 15 minutes.  Should have doubled the recipe.  I highly suggest.  Yummy and affordable.

Will be taking this to the next department potluck at work. Thank you for the Oh So Easy recipe!

Made this for Potluck but next time will use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 yogurt. Added finely diced celery (1 stalk) and 4 diced jalepeno peppers, 1 red bell pepper chopped, cumin and garlic powder.  I also let it sit in frig overnight to blend spices because it didn't have alot of spunk. However, everyone loved it and ate it up!

I can hardly wait to try this; it looks marvellous and just what is needed for our very cool fall parties.  We have several friends who love the jalepeno poppers but this is a more interesting presentation.  I've read most of the reviews and I'll stick to the recipe, maybe with more jalepenos for the extra kick!

EXCELLENT!!! I get so many requests from my friends for this dip!  I prefer fresh jalapeno to canned though!  I do use half sour cream/half mayonnaise, just personal preference.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe! I also add some fresh garlic, the whole can of Jalapeno's and 1 fresh diced jalapeno with the seeds. Some fresh parsley and 2-3 diced green onions as well as using half grated parmesan and half shredded parmesan. Bake in the oven at 350 for 25 or so minutes! YUM!

One of the best dips I've ever tasted! I added shredded cheddar to the cream cheese mixture, omitted the parm and topped with panko bread crumbs instead to give it the crunch that poppers have. Used french bread slices to dip. Phenominal!!!

This was very good, but definitely needs to be more spicy.  I followed the recipe exactly, and next time I will double the jalapenos.  Other than than, this is definitely a keeper - super easy and will be great for potlucks, parties, BBQs, holidays, games, etc.

I think sour cream would be a good subsitute for the mayo and use fresh chopped green chilies and jalapeno peppers.  I would use grated parmesan chees, asiago or romano.  The flavour would still be there and would be great as a dipper or bagel spread.

As good as everyone says.  This was completely gobbled up by about 6 people!  I actually messed up and broiled it and burnt the top when I cooked it so I had to scrape the top layer off and re-cover it with parmesan.  I actually liked it with just parmesan; the top was not a hard shell the way it was when I combined the parmesan with panko crumbs, but this might be because I only cooked it for about 5 mins with the parmesan (maybe adding the cheese on top near the end is a good idea).  I definitely recommend using all 4 oz of jalepenos, and I might try more next time.

This dip definitely lives up to the hype! So simple to make, yet so delish. I didn't really measure ingredients, everything was more or less to taste. Omitted the chilies since we like hot food. Lots of jalapenos! Used low fat cream cheese, will use regular next time. Will add bread crumbs as well. We love jalapeno poppers and this tasted exactly like the declicious filling!

this is just what i was looking for ... creamy, spicy, satisfying! oh, and easy! my only modifications were using an entire 4 oz. can of diced jalepeno and mixing in the parmesan cheese before microwaving. delish. fattening. yum! :) 2 oz. of jalapeno wouldn't be spicy enough for me.

This was such an easy dip! Plus it tasted so good! It makes a huge batch, which is good because it goes really fast. I didn't change anything, but I'd like to try it with the bread crumbs and parm mixed on top. It was wonderful as written too!

Goes over well at parties.. We liked it better without the green peppers, with Parmesan cheese mixed in and sprinkled on top and then baked in the oven (we don't have a microwave) and served with baguette.

I would rate a 10 if i could! 2nd time making it in a week. I am addicted. Tastes just like a popper! I half the mayo with sourcream and add cheddar cheese to the cream cheese mix then panko and parm mix with a little bit of butter for browning baked for 30 min at 350. This says HEAVEN!

I made this for a SuperBowl party, and everyone wanted to know how I made it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I added some bread crumbs to the topping, and baked it.  It was delicious.  If you like really spicy food, you might want to add a few more jalapenos.

I too baked this, using a pie plate that was sprayed with Pam, for the specified baking time & temp. There were a few changes. I used the Hellman's Mayo w/ olive oil which is what I had in my fridge. I used 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs mixed with the 1 cup of FRESHLY grated parmesan and sprinkled that on top. SO GOOD!!!! I'm not too crazy about jalapeno poppers but I loved this dip & it had a nice, mellow kick (though two guys considered it more than enough of a kick). Served it with thinly sliced baguette that I broiled for a few minutes.

Double the jalepenos if you want any spice at all.  I mixed panko and parm together for topping and it was easy and tasty.  Served with toasted french bread slices.  I will make this again- very simple.

Made this for a work function and it was a hit - literally had about 15 people ask me for the recipe. Made mine in a small crockpot. The only change I made was to add the entire 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos, as opposed to just 2 oz.  So easy to make and delicious. Also discovered that leftovers (if any!) are good cold, right out of the frig. Thanks for the great recipe, Denise!

So good!  I do mix the parm w/ the bread crumbs, but I've found that it can be a lot of topping so I reduce it by about 1/3.  For extra spice, dice a fresh jalapeno and stir into the mixture.  I also will slice (but seed) a couple add'l jalapeno's and place them on top of the spread before the topping mixture.  I recommend the baking option.

Everyone loves this!!  Many people have asked for the recipe!!  I did change a couple of things.  I substituted 1/2 the mayo for sour cream.  I also added breadcrumbs with the parm cheese and browned in the oven.  It's great for football party's.  I serve it with tortilla chips.  Delicious!

Fantastic!  Took this to a party and it was one of the first items gone.  When making it just for my family, I think I'll increase the jalapeno peppers since we like things very spicy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I dont like mayonnaise, and Im not really a fan of cream cheese (lactose intolerant, so i try to avoid the stuff). But my friend made this dip using some of the tips on the website such as half mayo, half sour cream (which i also don't like) and baking it for 30 minutes. OH MY GOODNESS, DELICIOUS!!! We had a party of about 10 people and it was nearly gone within 10 minutes. I will make this over and over and over. GREAT job.

This is fantastic.  I have used sour cream in place of mayo.  Everyone loves this when i make it as a dip for chips or mini pitas or veggies!  I also finely grate cheddar or mozzarella in place of parmesan.  Love it!

Made this and got rave reviews. I will definitely be making this a party staple. So easy. Can be prepped in advance. Quick microwaving means if your guests show early or late your dip is still perfect!

Made this for foot season and my husband loved it! I'm not a huge fan of the jalapeno but it was tastey just a little hot for my taste. Will be making it again for New Years Eve. Good with tortilla chips and crustinies

This is a great quick dip to make. I made it exactly as was called for and used tortilla chips to dip in it. My husband said this is a must keep recipe and he said he could eat spoon fulls of it. Looks like I will be making this again :)

A big hit at the Christmas party this year, with the adults and even with the young kids!  I did use a full 4 oz can of jalapenos.  I also mixed 1/2 c up of the parmesan in with the mayo and cream cheese and 1/2 cup over the top.

This was one of the dishes that I brought to a staff Christmas party and DEFINITELY the one that was most commented on as being so fantastic! My only changes were as suggested by some other reviewers - 4 oz. of chopped jalapenos as well as 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs on top ... baked at 350 for 40 minutes. I accidentally mixed the parmesan cheese right in instead of putting it on top but this was still so wonderful :)

Oh wow, this dip is awesome!  Even the dog sat and howled for more!  I added 1/2 c shredded cheddar, and sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top before baking in the oven at 400 for 25 mins.  This is my new go to dip for game days.

Delicious. I used neafaundlin (sic?) creme cheese, light mayo, 2 4oz cans of diced jalapeno & added about a cup of jack cheddar along w/ some on the top mixed w/ some italian seasoned bread crumbs.  It came out fantastic.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but did use the tip of adding 1/2 cu Panko breadcrumbs to the Parmesan cheese topping - then I baked it (uncovered) 350° for 30 min. until lightly browned.  I took it to a potluck tonight and it was the FIRST thing gone.  With the Panko addition this REALLY TASTES just like the true Jalapeno Poppers you get in a restaurant!  I served it with good crackers.  Easy...fast... deeeelish!!  LOVE THESE!

Excellent dip! I added a few more chopped Jalapenos as others have suggested because I like the heat. I split the recipe in half and took half to a party the same night and it was great. The second half I took to another party the following day - it seemed much hotter I guess the jalapenos married with the cream cheese. I really don't think you have to bake this recipe - it is great cold too!

My husband loves jalepeno poppers so when I first saw this recipe I decided to give it a try. Personally I am not a fan of jalepenos but this dip is to die for. I made it for every party occasion last holiday season and intend to do so again this year.

I have made this so many times! I use the whole small can of diced jalapenos, so good! Also sprinkle parmesan cheese on the top and bake it in the oven at 425 for 20-25 mins! It also works great for parties, just bake it and then put it into a small crockpot on low or warm setting!

I have made this dozens of times, literally.  I somtimes add more jalapenos (up to 4 oz) and use the baked version when I am taking it somewhere and the microwave when it's just for home.  I have NEVER taken it somewhere and not been asked for the recipe!  In fact, now that I have given out the recipe I have to make sure no one else is making it before I take it to get togethers!!  My fave thing to serve it with is toasted baguette but it's good on just about ANYTHING!

This is so yummy!  I changed it up a little though.  When I order poppers from Arby's I always get the raspberry sauce to dip them in, so I heated 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam and poured it over the top just before serving.  It was a HUGE hit and looked pretty too!  Gave it a spicy sweet taste.

This recipe is frequently requested at our functions.  I add panko crumbs to the cheese before topping and I bake in the oven.  Excellent flavor and best served with sliced toasted bagettes with a little butter and garlic sprinkle on top.  Yummm.  Because I have a lot to do the day of our functions, I prepare this the day before and cook the day of.

I read the reviews, and didn't know how this would possibly taste like poppers, but it does!  It is awesome!  I served w/ Triscuit and Wheat Thin crackers.  This will be in our football watch party rotation from now on!  Awesome!

This is the best dip!  I made it the first time about a year ago for a ladies night with neighbors.  I have made it several times since and each time, the dish is empty.   If you want to make it hotter, add some of the juice from the peppers!

People! Do NOT change anything other than adding extra Jalapeno's if you like it extra spicey.  Other than that this recipe is EXACTLY how it should be! So FANTASTIC and oh so easy!!  Enjoy!  I liked it w/ Stacey's bagel chips (Parmesan flavor). Oh and use FRESHLY GRATED Parm. it's soooo much better as it says.  Enjoy....again! :)  M.M.

Fantastic!  Made as stated, but I baked for 20 min until bubbly at 400 and mixed the fresh parmesan with some fresh bread crumbs, about 50/50.  Served with sliced french bread (didn't have time to toast, still was devoured!) and tostitos and salsa.  THANKS!!  Great recipe.  We had 10 adults, and this was literally inhaled in no time...so if you have a large group I would reccommend a double batch in a shallow baking dish.  (definitely bake, it allows the flavors to blend!)

Fabulous recipe Denise! I used half parm and half cheddar and fresh jalapeno's instead of the canned. (note: if using fresh, please wear gloves while dicing  the peppers as the juice ended up settling under my rings and gave me a pretty good burn) I topped the dip with a sprinkling of parm and panko bread crumbs and placed in the oven instead of the microwave so the panko could crisp up. This dip lasted about ten whole minutes! Thanks Denise!

This recipe is really great - its quick and easy, very flexible (you can substitute fresh jalapenos for canned, or cheddar for parmesan, etc), and a real crowd pleaser.  I'm not normally a big jalapeno popper fan, but this dip is addictive.  I always make it in a shallow baking dish, topped with breadcrumbs sprayed with Pam to give each bite a little crunch like the fried version.  I often halve the recipe if its just for a few people.

What a great recipe...my friends are still asking about this one. Now i did switch it up a bit. I added 3 tbsp of sour cream and a can of Mild Rotel tomatoes and chilies (so I left out the chilies the recipe called for). Now if you are on Weight Watchers, use low fat cream cheese and sour cream, it knocks off about 3 pts. Happy eating:)

This is a fan favorite when we take the meetings, parties, special events.  We always add the entire 4oz can of jalapenos to the recipe and I promise it is a big hit and not as spicy as you would think.

I took this to a potluck and smiled while I watched everyone stand there and devour it. I'm not much of a cook, but this couldn't have been more simple to prepare. I couldn't find diced jalapeno peppers but used 1 can chopped chilies and 1 can hot chopped chilies which I did not drain. (they didn't seem to have that much liquid) Pefect! I read many reviews and followed the advice given. I  grated my own parmesan and mixed about a 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs to sprinkle on top. Baked at 350 for 30 mins and served with sliced baguettes. My husband has now requested this for a potluck at his job next week. This is a keeper!

Really awesome as a spread or a dip. Followed others' suggestions: mixed some cheddar cheese in and topped with a cheddar cheese/bread crumb mixture then baked. I liked this even better than actual jalapeno poppers.. Took it to a friend's game party and everyone really liked it. Served with toasted french bread slices, but goes nicely with tortilla chips too.

Loved it! This was a hit at our barbecue. Really tastes like poppers. I followed the recipe exactly, had the perfect amount of spice for my liking. Not too spicy, but yummy!

How have I not rated this yet?  I've made it a dozen times, at least! I mixed the parmesan into the dip.  I sprinkled panko crumbs and additional parmesan on top, and baked it at 350 til hot instead of microwaving it.  Oh yeah, and I used the parmesan in the green can. It's fantastic! Its

WOW!  What an easy and tasty appetizer.  I typically modify for lower fat - I used 1 fat free cream cheese and 1 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese.  I also used 1 cup fat free mayo and used 4-5 oz. of diced jalapeno.  As others suggested, I topped it with 1/2 cup parm. cheese and 1/2 panko and baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It was delicious and my family ate this up in no time.  Thank you!

Every time I make this people love it!  I do add more green chilies and jalopenos to it.  I also add some of the jalopeno juice to it.  I season it with a little "Slap Your Mama" (you can use Tony's Cacherey instead). Be careful not to over-season it as it gets stronger when cooked.  I like crostinis with it but we usually just serve it with tortilla chips.

So simple and very delicious.  I doubled the peppers and I followed one reviewer's advice and topped it with a mixture of parmesan and panko crumbs to give it a golden, crunchy topping.  However, I didn't think it looked unappetizing without it, as one person suggested.  Either way, this is a new staple dip.

This makes a lot.  I divided it up to serve hot in batches but didn't use quite all of it for a small group.  Leftover dips with cream cheese and/or mayo will flavor a wide variety of other foods.  Stirred into cooked rice, drained hot corn or any veggie, spread on bread and lightly toasted, spread on baked potatoes.  There are lots of ways to use it to spice up your next meal.

We just made this for a party tonight and made a side sample batch and it is sooo GOOD we can't stop eating it! Not to mention easy to make. It tastes just like the jalapeno poppers you get at a resteraunt. However, we did make a few alterations.  We added alot more Jalapenos because we love spicy and added 1 cup of shredded chedder. We will certainly be making this again and again. Thanks!!!

Definitely an easy, crowd-pleasing recipe!  I more than doubled the jalepenos and the flavor was great (not too spicy). Serve with pita chips.  A super simple party recipe that's made for a crock pot.

If you like the taste of the Jalapeno Poppers from Sonic Drive in (I do), you'll love this recipe. They are nearly identical in flavor. I doubled the diced jalapenos as suggested by many of the reviewers and am glad I did. It was great. Thanks, Denise!!

I just made this for a Super Bowl party and it was AMAZING!!! I did add extra jalapenos and some of the jalapeno juice. I microwaved for 3 minutes, then  I mixed a cup of bread crumbs and a cup of parmesean cheese for the topping, and popped it in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes.  This last step was key to getting that fried taste of the poppers. So easy! So yummy! Love this recipe!

I made this for our church Super Bowl Party and it won for best Spicy Dip out of about 30 dips!  I followed the directions, except I added the parm to the spread, not on top,   4 oz of cheddar jack cheese, and a 4 oz can of jalapenos  Everyone loved it.  I just kept it hot in a crockpot.

This is sooooooo yummy!  My mom used to make a dip with mayo and parmesan cheese for parties, she piped it on Triscuit crackers and put them on a cookie sheet and put it under the broiler to carefully brown.  I tried this dip that way and it was really good.  This is my new favorite dip recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Unbelievably good........and easy!  I use more jalapenos than the recipe calls for because we love it hot.  I usually cook it in the micro and then brown it for a few minutes in the oven.  Every one I have made it for, absolutely loves it.  Thanks, Denise  P>S> I have been making this for a couple of years and just realized I had never rated it!

since discovering this recipe two weeks ago i've made it for a girls' night gathering and an office potluck - big hits both times and everyone wanted the recipe.  (i've also tried it with cheddar mixed in with the parmesan but found it to be greasy, so i suggest sticking with parm.)  panko on top and baking is definitely the way to go, but it does reheat in the microwave well.

This recipe was easy and great!  Took it to a party and it was the first thing gone.  I did not have canned jalapenos so just used some of the pickled jalapenos.  I served with crackers which I prefered but some dipped tortilla chip scoops and liked that also. Will definitely make again!

I am required to take this to EVERY family gathering. I double the green chilies and use a tiny bit more jalapenos. We use Ritz, toasted baguette and celery to dip.  Just Fabulous!

Very big hit at our house!  Much better then going to the trouble of making actual poppers!  Used a little more jalapenos, baked it and when it was done, we stirred it...Fantastic.  Thank you...

Excellent!  Made for Christmas Eve and it was gone so quick that my husband complained he didn't get any.  I subbed 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream and grated fresh parm. cheese.  Mixed 1/2 with the dip and 1/2 with panko and baked it.  Everyone loved it!  I also used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned.  You could taste it but there wasn't alot of heat.  Next time I'll try 2-1/2 to 3 peppers instead just to kick it up a little.  Served with triscuits, sliced baguette and totstitoes.  The tostitoes are by far the best choice with this dip IMO.  Thanks for submitting this wonderful recipe!! Will make again and again

The men stood around the dish for the 20 minutes it took them to completely inhale every last bit of this dip.  It's insanely good and authentic.  My only changes just to be a little healthier, I did 1/2 cup mayo 1/2 cup sour cream, chopped 6 fresh jalpenos, omitted the greens chilies (don't like the flavor).  I also added a little mozzerella cheese to the mixture for the stringy cheese effect.  I've served with melba chips, french bread (untoasted) and club cracker dipping sticks.  The bread is the best but it goes well with all three.  Everyone loves this dip. It's a keeper for sure!

Absolutely wonderful.  I brought it to a work christmas party and it was the first thing to go!  A week later I still have people emailing me for the recipe.  I did add parmesan cheese into the mixture and put it in the crockpot on low so it would stay warm during the party!

Absolutely a big hit at our Christmas party. Slight changes, added the 7oz can size of green chilies, instead of the 4oz, and a little more jalapenos to get the right heat "like it spicy" and a 1/2 cup of mexican blend cheese's into mixture. this is a keeper!

If you are even thinking about making this - DO IT! It is one of the best dips that I have ever tasted and everyone who tries it agrees!  I mixed together equal parts panko (or regular bread crumbs work) and parmesean cheese and sprinkle it on the top - amazing!

This is a wonderful appetizer recipe.  It is so delicious and couldn't be easier to make too!  I added 1/2 cup panko crumbs with grated parm on top before putting in the oven at 375 for 1/2 hour.  I served it with baguette slices, which was good, but next time I will serve with baguette slices, pretzels, and triscuits, I think the last two taste great with this dip.  This is a perfect football party dip but was good enough for a ladies' holiday party for me!

I made this dip last weekend for a party.  No leftovers at all.  I skipped the green chilies because I used a 7oz. can of jalopeno slices.   I remembered  to removed a lot of the seeds, otherwise it would have been TOO hot.  I took one reviewers advice and used bread crumbs to top it along with parmesano/raggianno.    EXCELLENT !!!!

Easy, easy, easy and great flavor.  I've made it 2x so far.  The 2nd time I wasn't as careful measuring the mayo and ended up adding a little too much.  I noticed because I'm not a big mayo fan, but it was still good.  I'll be sure to be more accurate while measuring the mayo because it was a better  balance of flavors the 1st time.  I also used 1 cup of freshly grated parmesan and 1/2 cup of Panko.  Nice addition of flavor and texture to the crust.

Put it all in a small crock pot for two hours.  Tasted just like a Jalapeno Popper.  I too added the whole 4oz. can of jalapenos.  It was not too hot for me but for some it might be.  It went great with beer.   Thanks for the recipe - I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious! I've never had jalapeno poppers but this was fantastic. I did mix the parmesan with bread crumbs as suggested by some. As I was preparing the dip, I taste tested and could not find any flvor or heat. As a reult I added a second can of green chiles and the majority of my 7oz can of jalapenos. Go figure, the baking is what brings out the flavor and heat. My dip was extremely spicey! I didn't receive complaints but it did catch someone off guard who had a big mouthful for the first bite. However, the dip was devoured. I'd add just a scoop few jalapenos next time but I'd definitely add more than the recipe calls for. This is a keeper and will be made many more times!

Took this to a Halloween party and was a total hit...tastes exactly like jalapeno poppers.   I took advice from other reviews and used 5 fresh jalapenos (seeds removed) and chopped fine in processor.  The fresh jalapenos really were great in the dip.  Even the kids loved it, what little was leftover (it wasn't much!) was even better the second day!

The HIT of the party.  EVERYONE raved.  I mixed everything as directed but instead of a microwave dish...put everything in a small dip crock and sprinkled the top with the parmesan and some extra diced jalapenos.  Plugged it in at the party and mixed it up when it got warm.  The guys were calling it "crack in a vat" because they couldn't stop eating it!  Will share this recipe with EVERYONE and take it to every party!  Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  so easy!   can use reduced fat C. cheese and mayo too.  i threw in a pinch of cumin, and cayenne.  also sprinkled some panko on top and broiled for a minute to get a little bit of a crust on top!  followed another reviewer and used toasted bread chunks for dipping...very addicting!

I love stuffed Jalapenos, so this recipe intrigued me. Could I actually have the flavor without the mess of making them?  Yes!  This is great!  I took it to a Halloween Party and it was gobbled up w/ many people asking for the recipe. To make= I blended the cream cheese (lite) and mayo (lite) together until smooth w/ hand mixer.  I added 4 oz. of EACH jalapenos & green chilies.  I then stirred in the parmesean cheese.   I baked @ 350 for 30 min.  Cannot wait to make this again!!

we've made this several times now, changing it up for perfection.  here's my advice.. ~it does taste best with toasted french baguette slices so don't bother adding breadcrumbs to the recipe..they failed to improve the spread.   ~use half grated parm, and the other half fresh shredded ~double your jalepenos if you want some heat ~better yet, to really taste like poppers use fresh jalapenos.  i recommend 4 and you can take out all or some seeds to tame the heat ~bake at 350 for 30 mins ~used reduced fat cream cheese and mayo and it was still fantastic!!!

I rated this 4 stars as written, but it gets 5+ stars when following the advice of others by adding panko to the freshly grated parm topping then baking in the oven at 400 for 15-20 minutes.  It's fantastic and was a huge winner with all in my family.

Easiest most delicious dip I have ever tasted.  I did as others suggested and used a whole 4 oz. can of jalapenos, topped with parmesan mixed with panko, and served with toasted baguette slices.  There was nothing remaining in the bowl when the party ended.

a great game-day dish!  i used lite cream cheese, mayo, and sour cream, which no one noticed.  i also doubled the green chilies for more flavor.  sprinkle bread crumbs on top and bake in the oven for a bit of crunch.  the fellas loved this!

I followed the recipe for the dip exactly and baked at 350 for 30 minutes in a hollowed out bread bowl. Delicious!

We absolutely LOVE this dip! I do add extra jalapenos for a little more kick, but it's fantastic just as written. Sometimes I put it into mini phyllo cups, top w/ panko crumbs and parm. cheese and bake until browned. Everyone loves it either way it's served! I don't microwave it, I put it in a 350 degree oven for about 20 mins. or so, until brown and bubbly. This dip is a staple at all our get-togethers! Thanks for posting. :)

I brought this to a dinner party and have been begged ever since for the recipe, and to bring it back.  It was super easy to make, and delicious. Bonus:  I have celiac's and can not have traditional poppers.  This was a delightful alternative for me.

This was awesome! I love this recipe and so did my guests! My brother took the recipe home with him and he isn't a cook- he just loved it so much.  I used the baking method, I totally recommend that, it was GONE! I will definitely make this again. I did use a whole 4 oz. can of jalapenos though- it gave it alot more kick which was loved by all!

I made this dip.  I was not thrilled it was good but not being a fan of mayo it stood out to me and overwhelmed the cream cheese. I will make it again and will change the mayo to 1/2 cup and do as the another rater and add breadcrumbs to give it and additional crunch besides the bagel crisps I did use.

I also use this ontop of little cherry tomatoes. I pipe the spread out ontop of the tomatoes, serve tomatoes by nesting each one in a doritos scoopables, simple, easy and quick for the unexpected company.  Great recipe.

I found this to be really bland and disappointing.  When I try again (which I'm only doing b/c I bought the stuff to make it for a family gathering today) I'll add way more jalapenos.

I thought this was great..only had about 2/3 cup of mayo and it turned out excellent.  I sprinkled a blend of asiago, parmesan and romano cheese (Sams club) and turned out awesome~  next time might try adding bigger chunks of jalapeno.

The Best! My husband can't get enough of this spicy, tasty and nicely different dip! Thanks for the great recipe. I can't get canned chiles so I subbed a half of a red hot pepper. So with the red pepper, green jalapeno and white cream cheese mix it will make a nice christmas color dip also.

This is now a family favorite!  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of mayo and swap fresh for canned jalapeno. I still used the canned chiles and it was such a hit.  I think the next time I make it I will try the other suggestions to use some sour cream, the right balance between mayo and sour cream would probably be perfect.  This is a keeper!!

Where has this dip been all my life???  We absolutely loved it!  Somehow, it reminded me of the Chicken Wing Dip we also love...guess it's the heat.  You HAVE to make this...it's a cinch, too.

This recipe is just way too easy to get such rave reviews!  Everyone absolutely loves this spread.  I use the full 4 oz. can of jalapenos though (sometimes another whole can, depending on the crowd...) and I definitely recommend doing the panko crumbs mixed w/the parmesan on top and baked in a 350°oven for about 30 mins.   This stuff goes like crazy!!  I also agree that toasted french bread slices are the best way to go to really get that "popper" taste.

I made this for the first time last week for a pot luck,made it again three days later for Father's day, everyone LOVED this recipe, they could not get enough.Came back to work today and all of my coworkers kept asking for the recipe.This is FABULOUS!!! I always get my recipes from this website and this recipe has by far had the best reviews. Consensus from work and at my BBQ is that the dip is best with warm bread, honestly though when we ran out of that  people were using anything they could get their hands on to dip in it. Followed other reviews did 1/2 cup mayo,1/2 sour cream,added cheddar cheese to the mixture,topped with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese then sprayed with butter flavored pam and baked for 30 mins.This dip will be what I take everywhere from now on.  THANK YOU SO MUCH DENISE!!!:)

This is a great base recipe that you can add lots of different ingredients to.  I omitted the canned chilies and jalapeños and used fresh jalapeños.  I threw all of the ingredients into the food processor along with half a vidalia onion.  Then I mixed in some shredded monterrey jack cheese and put it in the microwave.  It tasted really good with Wheatables crackers.

I made this dip for a few barbeques and potlucks and it was always a hit! Now evertime I'm asked to bring it. It's just so quick and easy, perfect for disorganized people such as myself. I, however, did use 3 fresh jalapenos instead, added about 2 tbsp of horseradish and 500g of chopped up bacon and baked it for 20 -25 minutes instead of microwaving it.

Awesome recipe.  I used 4 oz of jalapenos and cheddar cheese instead of parmesean.  I sprinkled the top with a cup of Panko crumbs and baked at 400 for 20 minutes.  Delicious.

Wonderful.  I add fresh roasted jalapenos and crushed buttered saltines for a topping.  bake it in the oven instead of the microwave.

A definite favorite and crowd-pleaser!!  I've made this numerous times and it's always a big hit.  I love jalapenos and usually double or even triple the amount of jalapenos (hey, I'm a Texas gal and we love our spicy food!  :)  I've done this in both the microwave and oven.  Both work great.  I don't think you can mess this one up if you try.  It's a winner!

I have made this dip at least a dozen times, all I can say is delish delish delisl, I do bump up the jalapenos to give it more of a heat kick, my hubby and the guys love it. It freezes well too.

I made this for my husband's poker party and all of the men ate it up!  I added panko bread crumbs per other's suggestions and I can't imagine making this without them.  I served it with Tostitos scoops and it was a real hit!

I used this recipe at a party for about 70 people.  I had many appetizers but this went first.  I liked being able to make ahead and heat in the microwave.  I then added it to a small crock pot.  It's a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe

Big Hit!  People couldn't get enough.  I did make some recommended changes: used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, and 1/2 Parm cheese and 1/2 cheddar.  Served with tortilla chips and had to hand out the recipe several times.

Yep it's a five star for sure.  Took it to a party tonight.  They loved it. I did the same as others in the review.  I lessened the mayo and added a little sour cream.  I used fresh baby parmesean on top mixed with bread crumbs.  Amazing.  We had it with mini pitas and rice tortillias.  I will make this again it was sooooooo easy.

This is a great dip! Every time I've taken it to a party, i always get asked for the recipe. I used 3 fresh jalapenos instead of canned, and I also mixed bread crumbs with melted butter and sprinkled them over the top. I think that deffinately makes it more like a popper.  I baked it, and that toasted the breadcrumbs nicely.  Try this, you won't be dissapointed

I took this to a party and the dish was empty by the end of the party.  Some people were hesitant to try it, but once they did, they loved it.  I doubled the jalapenos because I like it hot.  I also mixed 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese for the top and baked in 400 degree oven for 20 min.  The best!!!!

This is an easy, crowd-pleasing recipe that can be changed up with your mood.  We can only eat half a recipe, and this time I added drained marinated artichoke hearts to combine several of my favorite dips.  I used one 4-oz can of diced jalapenos and the 7-oz can of diced green chiles.  Next time I will do as someone else suggested:  serve it with sliced baguettes!  So yummy!

This is good and really easy to make.  I made it for a Superbowl party.  I suggest serving it in a crock pot so it stays hot.  It is spicy... doubled the jalapenos as suggested by most readers.  Also made it with low-fat mayo and cream cheese and you couldn't tell at all.

This is a very good dip to serve when you want to put it out on the table and forget about it. It is awesome when it is warm, but still very tasty when it reaches room temperature! As suggested, I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated, sprinkled a little Italian seasoned bread crumbs on top (don’t really know if it was necessary), and baked it in the oven instead of microwaving. It wasn’t great as far as presentation goes, but that sure didn’t stop my guests from chowing it down. Next time I may place a few slices of colorful bell peppers or a sprig of parsley on top after baking to add some color to the dish.  Definitely serve with French baguettes. I say baguettes because you need two to finish off the dip. One is not enough.  I sliced the baguettes and lightly toasted them in the oven. I tried it with a cracker and it wasn’t as good. Thanks for the recipe.

This has become my all time favorite recipe on this site.  I have served it at family gatherings, super bowl party, football tailgating...I even had a friend's wife ask me to make it for a birthday gathering for her husband he likes it so much.    I have been asked for this recipe more than anything I have ever made.  I always have to make a double batch if my college age kids are around.

This is wonderful.  5 stars is not enough for this great recipe. I made it to take to a friend's house and 4 of us ate almost the entire thing.  I did use some of the changes suggested by others.  I used 1/2 mayo - 1/2 sour cream.  I could not find canned jalapeno peppers so i used the sliced ones in the jar & chopped them.  I increased them amount to 2/3 cup.  I used a Mexican blend cheese instead of the parmesan and stirred it into the spread.  Topped it with toasted bread crumbs with about 1/4 cup Romano cheese.  I had to travel with this so i put it in a crock pot and right before serving put the toasted bread crumbs on top,  It was Heavenly.  This is a real keeper

This spread tasted good, but looked pretty gross due to oil sitting on top. I had to drain the oil off of it and then there was still so much incorporated in the spread that i couldn't get a good consistency or look. IF I made this again, I would leave out the mayo.

Awesome recipe!  I made this recipe for a get together and everyone loved it (especially the men).  I made it with light Hellman’s mayonnaise because it was all I had on hand and thought it was just great.  The next time I made it, I decided to use regular Hellman’s mayonnaise and it turned out too greasy!  I actually prefer the light (not low fat) mayonnaise instead.

I've made this several times, and it's always a huge hit! I serve it with buttery crackers and tortilla chips. We like things on the spicy side, so I do add a little bit more jalapenos to it - YUM!

Ok, hello, where has this dip been all my life? :) It is amazing! I made it last week for a superbowl appy and it was a total hit. I used all mayo, but would try the half sour cream. I also used the jarred, pickled jalapenos, and we could not believe how much this is like the real poppers. I think my husband ate most of it! We dipped with toasted pitas, and also sliced green and red peppers, which was simply perfect. I don't think you can go wrong with this, I'm making a double batch for company tomorrow. I think you could either omit of use the parm cheese, and it would still be great. TRY THIS DIP! you will love it! Thanks so much for this one!!!

This was a winner!  I made the spread for the Super Bowl party and they ate the whole thing! 2 People asked me for the recipe too! I will definitely do a repeat on this appetizer.    I added some of the mexican blend of shredded cheeses to the cream cheese mixture.  I layered the top with shredded cheddar then put the mixed parmesan and bread crumbs on the top.  I browned the bread crumbs on top in the broiler before serving.  To reheat, put in microwave for a few minutes.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dip.  We thought this was perfect...not too spicy, but just spicy enough.  I added more parm. cheese and had to buy a 16 oz jar of jalapeno peppers because my store didn't carry a small can.  I guessed on how much to cut up and put in and it tasted fine.  I put it in the oven for 400 degrees for about 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested.  I'll probably throw it in a crock pot when we have a party to keep warm next time I make it.

This was so good!  I made it for a football party and it got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  I made it the night before and just popped it in the microwave when people started arriving.  I served it with bread, tortilla chips, and those thick hard pretzels.  Yummy!!!

Haha, I made this for my family and they completely desmembered the bowl in 20 minutes flat (they ignored the fact that they were burning their mouths because it was hot, that's how good it was!). I made the "French Baguettes" recipe from this site as the bread. I formed it into long thin rolls so when it was baked and sliced, I got nice medallion-like slices of bread, perfect for scooping the spread. I did stir in some parmesan cheese as well as sprinkle it on the top. I used panko crumbs to add crunch. It turned out well. I microwaved the whole bowl till hot (3 or 4 minutes), then broiled it until the crumbs were nice and browned. The heating procedure took about 10 minutes total, making this a very easy and very fast snack.

I followed the recipe and the only thing different is I used Mircle Whip. It was awful. I made it for my family for Christmas and boy was I embrassed.

Delish! Left out the jalapeno and added extra green chilies. Also, took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled with bread crumbs. That made it taste like a real jalapeno popper! If you make this in advance, remember it will get spicer in the fridge over night.

Wow, this really does taste like a jalapeno popper.  Per the suggestion of other reviews, I also doubled the jalapenos, and used fresh shaved parmesan and 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs for the topping.  It was delicious! Beware, however - the amount of "heat" you get will depend on the peppers you used.  I used the jarred "pickled" jalapenos (the ones you use on nachos) and this dip came out EXTREMELY hot (and trust me, my tastebuds are tough; I love hot, spicy food!) Using these peppers, I probably should have stuck with the recipe and only used 2 oz.  Only those who can tolerate really spicy food (like me) could eat this at the New Year's Eve party I took it to.  While you may need to play around with the peppers to find the right "temperature" for you and your guests, it's definitely a recipe you'll want to try.  Yummy and so easy, too!

OMG! I thought everyone was crazy, it couldn't be THAT good, and it couldn't taste THAT much like a deep fried popper - but it IS that good and it does taste that close to it.  Made if for New Years for some friends that love the hot stuff and it was a huge hit.  I did 3/4 cup parm cheese in the spread and 1/4 on top with a little cheddar on top too.  I used the entire can of jalapeno as others had suggested.  Perfect.

WOW!  I made this for my New Year's Eve party and my friends devoured it--one was trying to scrape the bowl to get the last of it.  It really does taste like a popper, and this recipe was so easy.  Instead of microwaving it, I did bake it and then broiled it for a minute so the parmesan got nice and brown.  Served with toasted french bread slices, it was a HIT!!  Now I get to share the recipe ; ).

I made this last week for my hubby to take to an office Christmas party. It received rave reviews. Served with "Scoops" tortilla chips. I didn't get to taste it but everyone loved it and only one person said it was "hot". I'm sure when I make it for just us, I'll add more peppers to make it a little warmer. :-)

Oh My Gosh!  This tastes soooo good cold; I can't wait to heat it up for my party this afternoon.  After tasting, I added the entire 4 oz of diced jalapenos to kick up the heat.  Incredible!  The flavor is even better than my homemade poppers (which I thought was impossible).
Great recipe -- thanks!
UPDATE:
Just as good hot. This mellowed incredibly in fridge overnight.  Awesome recipe.

This was a hit with our family & extended family.  Pretty much followed the recipe as is except I substituted Ramono for Parmesan cheese since that is what I had.  Was great with the toasted french bread as someone else had suggested.

delicious flavor!  Would have given it 5 stars, but the cheese on top got so hard after putting in the microwave that the chips kept breaking making it very difficult to eat.  Other than that, great dip!

Very good - but I would add a bit more jalapeno next time.  It makes a ton of dip too, so I think I'll half it as there were 10 adults at the party (and 2 other apps) and we ate only about 1/4 of the dip (although people loved it).

This was very good. I got a lot of compliments at the party. I used 4 whole jalapenos that came in a jar, just first removed the seeds so they would not be too hot. I also mixed shredded parmasean cheese and panko bread crumbs to top off the dip. I sprayed the top of the bread crumb/cheese mixture with some butter flavored spray so it would brown-up when baking.

This was great! I doubled the jalepenos, and it wasn't extremely spicy. I used half mayo & half sour cream, and sprinkle some bread crumbs on top, which gave it a good appearance. Served with tortilla chips...everyone loved it!

I made this for a pot-luck at work and it was devoured by all. I also made it for my mother - she is VERY picky about foods like this and she practically ate the ENITRE pan. I will make this again.

Awesome.  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added 4 oz of each jalapeno jack and white cheddar cheeses, and sprinkled a bit on top.  I used the green chiles as the recipe states and used 6 fresh jalapenos instead of canned.  I put mine in the refrigerator overnight so all the flavors could marinate together.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for my husband and his friends last weekend and they absolutely loved it!!  My husband says that I NEED to make it more often!  Some changes that I made were to use 4 oz. (a whole can) of jalapenos and I also added half a cup of panko bread crumbs to the parm cheese and then baked as suggested for 30 minutes.  This came out so yummy and delicious!  I served it with sliced french baguettes and chips!  A definite keeper!  I will make it for our next party!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was SO good!  I decided, despite the reviews of others with tips on enhancing the recipe, to go with the exact recipe as written.  It turned out absolutely perfectly.  Tasted just like a jalapeno popper, even with the Parmesan cheese, which was freshly grated.  Served it with slices of french baguette.  The only thing I did differently, was to bake it at 300 F for half an hour in a glass 9x9 square baking dish.  As it cooled down, I just popped it back into the microwave to re-heat it.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  My suggestion is, do not stray from the original recipe until you've at least tried it.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I followed others' advice and mixed 1/2 cup panko with 1/2 cup shredded parmesan and 2 teaspoons of paprika for the topping, spraying with Pam. I omitted the grated parmesan. I baked this at 350 degrees for about 22 minutes.  It made a very pretty and appealing appetizer that I took to a birthday celebration.  Can't wait to make it again for just us!

Absolutely delicious!! I am not a big fan of chunks so I put my chilis with the juice and jalapenos in a food processor till smooth. I also added 1/2 t salt and more jalapenos for extra heat. : ) I used lowfat everything...so I could eat more of it and not feel guilty. Because trust me, you're going to want to eat more of it!!!

I baked this recipe for last thanksgiving for a dip. It was a hit addicting to almost everyone even though everyone also said, "it's sooo hot!" I used extra peppers like other people suggested; will stick to recipe exactly next time.

Tasted just like poppers with out all of the mess.  I even used this mixture and stuffed it inside of Chicken Breasts and Hamburgers.  It was great with everything!  I will continue to make as a dip and a stuffing!!

I made this yesterday for a family gathering and everyone loved it.  I used 3 fresh jalapenos from my garden and finely chopped them but I think I'll use 6 next time.  Didn't use a full cup of parmesan and I also used the Panko crumbs on top and baked in the oven instead of microwave.  I might also try putting some cheddar on top and then the Panko crumbs some time in the near future !!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone absolutely loves this recipe -- served with Wheat Thins.  I have made it three times and let everyone know its from Allrecipes.com.  I did increase the amount of jalapenos to approx. 7 oz to up the flavor but not necessarily the heat.  It is not too "spicy" just right.  Also, please don't use the pickeled type of jalapenos -- too vinegary and briney.  Also, definately bake in a pie plate util golden and bubbly.

Very good!  I used a full 4 oz. can of jalapenos and that was just right.  I mixed the parmesan cheese into the dip but will cut it back to half a cup and put on top.  I thought the parmesan flavor was a little too much.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great dip to bring to parties.  Much easier than stuffing and deep frying jalepeno peppers AND tastes exactly the same.

OMG!!!! Are you kidding!!! This is the best dip EVER. It actually tastes just like a popper. NO need to mess with the recipe. Make it as is. I used fresh Jalapenos, my store did not have any in a jar. Just use 4 large ones and you will be good to go. This is SO CHEAP to make. I think it cost me $3.58 TOTAL!! You honestly can't go wrong. SERIOUSLY try this recipe!!! A++++++++++++++

I read some of the reviews before I made this, I added shredded cheddar cheese used low fat cream cheese and mayo, ommited the green chillies and added bread cumbs (though I wont add the breadcumbs next time). This dip is wonderful and tastes JUST like poppers whenmatched with ritz. Its rich and filling. I cannot wait to make it again!

I made this twice.  The first time I added bacon & used fresh jalapenos and I didn't really care for it.  The second time I made it exactly as written except I baked it in the oven and we didn't like it at all.  My husband and I both like jalapeno poppers but we didn't think this tasted anything like them.  Given the great reviews, I really expected to love this recipe but unfortunately I just ended up with a high calorie, greasy mess that I ended up tossing.  It was a great idea though!

Fantastic recipe...got plenty of compliments and requests for recipe.  A male co worker said it was great "manfood."  Followed tip on topping with bread crumbs.  If you spray that with a good dose of cooking spray it crisps up even better in the oven.

This is incredible! I double the jalapenos, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. I always make the baked version, not the microwaved. I have made this for several parties since I came across this recipe right after Christmas, and have never had any leftovers! I like it best with sourdough toast, Ritz crackers or the Hint of Lime tortilla chips. But this is too easy and to delicious NOT to make!

I made this for a superbowl party. It went super fast! It tasted just like a popper. I took some advice and added the bread crumbs on top & drizzled a little olive oil. YUM!! My mouth is watering thinking about it now. THanks for the great recipe!

This was positively awesome.  I used some jalapeños from the jar, because that was all I could find in the store, and chopped them up myself.  I also used more than what the recipe calls for because we like it spicy.  I sprinkled regular Parmesan cheese on top, and just a small amount of shredded cheddar, because not having cheddar on something feels strange to me.  :)  I also used a small amount of bread crumbs and drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil over that.  

We used the scoop tortilla chips to dip, but I'm sure anything will work.  It was perfect!  ETA: I baked it the oven per someone else's instructions.

I have made this twice and both times got rave reviews. After reading all the reviews I did add half cup parmesan in it and half on top with bread crumbs, no cheddar, and the full can of jalapenos. I found 1 regular cream cheese and 1 reduced fat and only 3/4 of mayo worked fabulous.

I brought this dip to a family gathering where there is usually so much food that nothing gets finished...except for this dip!  Everyone loved it and I was asked for the recipe more than once.  I pretty much doubled both types of peppers and didn't find it too hot at all.  I also added cheddar cheese and bread crumbs to the top and baked it.  I will probably not do this again as it was harder to dip crackers in and didn't add much to the dip.  Easy and excellent recipe!

I never really review recipes but this one is fantastical!!!!  My hubby and I ate this for dinner last night LOL  I am trying it before I bring it to a Superbowl party this Sunday, and it will be a hit for sure.  I did add more jalapenos and chilies and I did use the breadcrumbs.  I mixed a cup of breadcrumbs with a tablespoon or so of olive oil, so they were not too wet.  I used parmesan and asiago cheeses sparingly on top.  Also, I sliced french bread and toasted in oven right after I took the spread out, and cooked them for about 3 minutes, they were crunchy enough to withstand the spread but not so crunchy that they tore the roof of your mouth up. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!

This is so easy and so awesome! I've made it twice now- once for a Halloween party and again for a party last night. I've never reviewed a recipe but after my friend jokingly proposed to me after tasting this dip, I thought I should let everyone know how good this recipe is! I used 1 1/2 fresh jalapenos without the seeds. I think I could have used 2, I like it a bit more spicy. I put it in a pie dish and baked it in the oven at 350 for like 10 or 15 mins. This way the parmesean gets a little brown. The recipe doesn't need to be modified. The first time I made it I used cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top and it wasn't as good. Looooveee it.

I used double amounts of chilies and jalapenos, refrigerated overnight, and then baked with fresh parm.  It was gone in minutes and I can't wait to make it again.  I think I will try fresh jalapenos and see if I can spice it up some more!

UPDATE: I cannot stop making this. Everyone loves it and I crave it now. I make it hotter every time. I use more jalapenos, fresh and jarred, and have also added fresh serrano peppers. This is the easiest recipe.

I used a whole 4 oz. can of diced Green Chilis and an whole 4 oz. can of Diced Jalapeno peppers.  The recipe only calls for 2 oz. of Jalapeno peppers but I didn't want to waste the other 1/2 of the can so I dumped in the entire can.  Boy did it turn out spicy!  YUM, we love spicy!  Served it with cubed Sour Dough French Bread and Corn Chips.  It was a big hit for New Years Eve!  I'm thnking of spreading the left overs on french bread slices and broiling them till browned and bubbly.  Served up with a bowl of Tomato Soup for dinner it should keep us toasty warm on the inside while the winter storms rage outside.  Quick and easy dinner on a weeknight and a great way to use up the leftovers!

This dip is wonderful - I get so many compliments - my only alteration is I use about 1/2 of the mayo because I think the mayo makes it too rich - still very good/tasty as is, but just a little too heavy for my liking.  Side note, the cold dip, if there are any leftovers, is awesome on a toasted bagel the next day.  I've made this using both grated and shredded parmesan and I, personally, preferred the grated.

This dip was the hit of our Christmas Eve party!  It was simple to put together, great hot or cold, and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were to use 4 ounces of jalepenos rather than 2, and to substitute cheddar cheese for the parmesan.  I stirred half of the cheddar into the dip and sprinkled the rest on top.  We will make this often... thanks for a great recipe!

This was REALLY good!!! I Made it the night before, I used the bigger size can of jalapenos and the chilis. I also added chedder cheese in the mix. I topped it with parm. and bread crumbs and sprayed it with pam. Baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes. YUM-O. My husband loved it, and he is very picky. You will love this dip!!!

I seem to be in the minority, but I didn't care for this recipe, and neither did anyone at our party.  I followed the directions exactly, and I thought it just tasted like warm jalapeno cream cheese.  Everyone else on here seems to like it, so I'd say its worth a shot to try!

Great recipe! I put half of the parmesan in the spread mixture, and I mixed the remaining with 1/2 cup bread crumbs for the topping. The bread crumbs made it more "popper like".

This was pretty good. I doubled the amount of jalapenos, but the cream cheese really overpowers them so I'll add even more next time. Mixed about a 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella into it and also used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream. Sprinkled the top with parmesan and bread crumbs, then baked @ 350 for about 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Whether for Southern Living Party, BUNCO party, Texas Longhorn Tailgate, everybody has raved about it!  I cut the mayo in half, microwave it and blend it all together and then top it off with Jalapenos and bake it!  It is absolutely awesome and everyone always asks for the recipe.

This was outstanding... I made two minor alterations based on prior comments. I used a 7oz can of jalapeños (instead of 4oz) and I added panko to the parmesan prior to topping the dip. I cooked it in a round Correlle dish for 40 min at 375.  The dip was demolished at the party and everyone wanted the recipe.

Made it exactly as the recipe was written.   It tasted strongly like mayonnaise, in spite of the other ingredients.   It could be the brand of jalapenos I had, but there was no heat, so I opened a jar of jalapenos and diced them and then added them and it made a world of difference.

I made this for a party, tripled the recipe and served it in a small crock pot with tortilla strips and crackers. I used sliced jalapenos and a little extra juice. It was gone....quick!!!

This was a hit at the potluck! And came together so quickly. Per other reviews I mixed in some of the Parmesan with panko for the topper - I followed the baking directions rather than microwaved it . The remaining half of the Parm I mixed in with the cream cheese, etc. I did 4 oz. HOT jalapenos and 4 oz. mile green chiles.

this was a great recipe.  I microwaved because I didn't have time and was skeptical how it would be.  NO need to bake it.  Microwave and it doesn't separate.  Only used Fresh chilis, cayennes, red and green jalepenoes, then threw some pankos on top meaning to broil them but never did.  It was the hit of the party!  will defeinately make again

This dip/sauce is wonderful!!! I give it a 10 star. Unfortunately I didn't have green chillies, but I added some green and black olives, chopped up, and a good pinch of crush red pepper flakes; which added to the flavour.

Made this and followed the recipe exactly- amazing as is! The canned chilies add the perfect tang to the dip and contribute to the authentic jalapeño popper flavor. Everyone was raving about this at my party, definitely a hit!

This was very popular when I served it to a group. They cleaned it up. The only modification I made was I used fresh roasted chili's that I bought at the farmers market and had already roasted. At first I thought it might be too hot but everybody loved it and said it wasn't too hot. I added crumbled corn tortillas chips to the top. A good way to use up the broken chips at the bottom of the bag.

This is a favorite. Sometimes I throw the ingredients in my small crock pot and stir occasionally until it is very warm and blended. My son won "best dish" at a contest in college when he brought this simple recipe.

Super yummy! I did the recipe exactly except for doubling the peppers like most reviews suggested. I did do that. Amazing how much it actually does taste like a popper. It does make a lot and can go a long way at a party.

Came out awesome.  Baked it at 350 for about 25 min ties and did use a few panko crumbs on top, and toasted French bread to use as a scooper.

Great way to use up garden jalapenos!  I add 6 or so depending on hotness, finely chopped.  Use fresh Parmesan cheese; the veggie peeler does quick work of shaving it down and it will add creamy, smoothness to the dish making it more dip like and less spread like. Make ahead, too, so the peppers have time to flavor the dish.
I serve with soft pretzel bites.  Everyone loves this!

So so good!!!

I double the green chiles and jalapeños, top with shredded cheddar or Colby jack, and then panko breadcrumbs. Bake until hot and broil if needed to make crunchy crispy crust.

OMG... I haven't even put it in the microwave yet and it's already to die for!  I had three home grown jalapeños that I blanched in boiling water for one minute before seeding and dicing. Fresh is so much better than canned. This dip/spread is seriously amazing.

People could not stop eating this dip - or talking about how good it was! I've served it twice now and it's a keeper. So easy too. I took suggestions and doubled the jalapeno peppers (still very mild), mixed 1/2C parmesan with 1/2C panko and sprinkled on top before baking. I served with salted pita chips. Yum!

I've made this for several get togethers and it's always a big hit. I do add more jalapeno and green chilies that it calls for because I like it spicy.  definitely a crowd favorite. last time I made it everyone wanted the recipe.

Too mild for us, but will give it 5 stars for EZ.  See the top rated most helpful review for crust and dipper suggestions.  I'll try this again with more jalapenos and leave some seeds for heat.

I took a double batch to a potluck with a big crowd and brought a lot home.

Made this because I didn't want to hassle with actual jalapeno poppers.  It was so delicious!  I baked it for 25 minutes.  I used half sour cream and half mayo.  Next time I will omit mayo., I just didn't like it. I will also add more jalapenos and omit the chilies.   I also added about some grated cheese because I wanted it to be cheesy.  It was a hit!! Kids said it tasted just like jalapeno poppers! Thanks for the recipe.

A huge hit! I doubled the jalapeño peppers and added some panko bread crumbs to the top and everyone LOVED it!

The Bread Crumbs are a must!  It does give it that popper flavor. I heavily sprinkled with grated Parmesan,(out of the jar)and then the crumbs. I used only fresh Jalapeno seeds and cartilage I had leftover from another recipe.  I used the 7 oz Fire Roasted can of diced Green Chiles and added half of a chopped red onion. Came out great; a little kick (I think baking for 20 minutes tamed it) and I did finish with the broiler on high  a couple minutes for the toastiness of the crumbs.

Delicious! Made it for the NYE party and it was a hit. The crowd I was serving was very health-conscious, so there was about half left over, but everyone gave me lots of compliments on it. 
The only thing I'd have to say about it is that the stated amount of jalapenos is definitely too little if you have spice-lovers in your crowd. The can I had was 7.75 oz, so I'd measured in exactly 2 oz first but realized that wasn't going to be nearly enough. I knew that my crowd loved hot/spicy food, so I just dumped the ENTIRE can in and that made a nice difference, visually and texturally.
I did put freshly grated parmesan cheese over it, followed by breadcrumbs and then baked it for 30 minutes. The breadcrumbs didn't toast entirely, so perhaps try the broiler for a toasted top.
I served it with the smaller Triscuit triangles.
Canned jalapenos are milder than fresh, apparently. 
But the dip definitely tastes like jalapeno poppers.
I took the advice from other reviewers and melted the leftovers into scrambled eggs the next morning and it was delicious.
Great recipe!

It came out just tasting mostly of the cream cheese. The chiles and peppers flavor needs to be stronger. I think if you doubled or more the peppers it should be much better.

This dip didn't sound good to me, but I needed a dip and this was quick and easy.  I put it together and took it to a family Thanksgiving dinner.  I heated it per instructions and tried it and it was delicious.  I had to talk others into trying it, and the word quickly got around and everyone was loving it.  I will be using this over and over.  It is addicting and I have to make myself stop eating it.  I spoiled my Thanksgiving dinner because I ate so much of this.

Amazing recipe! It was a huge thanksgiving hit with everyone.  
I combined a bunch of advice from everyone and came up with the following:
No chilies
5 fresh, chopped jalapenos (had some heat but not too much)
Reduced fat mayo
Fresh parm I grated myself mixed with 1/2 cup Panko and spread on top.
I baked for 20 minutes on 300 then broiled for a minute to get it crispy on top. I could have baked it longer as it wasn't SUPER hot in the middle so that was my one suggestion.
Otherwise amazing-will be my new quick go to!

So easy to make, and you can adjust how spicy you want it by adding more or less jalapeños.  I will make this again, and maybe play with using fresh roasted peppers.  It's equally good with sourdough bread or tortilla chips.

Made this for company to snack on while the pizza was cooking. Used parmesean-Romano cheese and topped with panko mixed with the cheese. Baked in the oven for 25 minutes. They asked for the recipe.

Delicious! This was a huge hit on football Sunday. I made a few slight modifications; used reduced fat ranch rather than mayo because I was out, used only one package of cream cheese, used 4oz of jalapeños and added a little cayenne because the jalapeños were on the milder side. I considered adding cheddar cheese based on a few reviews but it was perfect with shredded Parmesan cheese. It came out amazing! If you like it milder then I think it would be perfect without modifications

I just made this recipe for a beer tasting party I attended last night.  I was a bit skeptical about how this was going to  taste given such few ingredients and the ease of making it.  It turned out pretty darn tasty.  Here's what I did and didn't do to it.  I forgot to drain the can of green chilies and jalapenos.  The dip consistency was great.  So, this recipe just got easier.  Then, I used most of the can of jalapenos which was a 4 oz. can rather than a 2 oz. can.  That was the perfect amount of heat for me.  I also mixed in some fresh grated parmesan and then microwaved as suggested.  Then I topped it off with a mixture of parmesan and panko bread crumbs as others have done before me.  I broiled it in my toaster oven to get it lightly browned and viola!  In my opinion, the best thing to serve with this dip is thinly sliced french bread.  I didn't toast the bread, just sliced it.  The crowd devoured it!  All gone!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the easy and delish recipe!

It was gone within minutes.  I made extra but next time I will double it!  I dumped everything in the crock pot in less than five minutes and stirred it once before I served it.  I doubled the jalapenos as others suggested (I used the kind in the jar, not fresh, chopped in my mini food processor) and used cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan and served with Club crackers.  I thought the mayo might be too much but it was not.  I made this in an emergency when I needed to bring something cheap and easy to feed a huge group of hungry people.  If I'd had more time I would have added bacon, next time!

I have made this recipe multiple times and each time people have raved about it and asked me for the recipe. I add about double the jalapenos (the hotter the better as far as I am concerned) than the recipe suggests and chop them up very fine so you get a little with each dip.

I make this for every party and it's always gone within minutes of being served. I added half a sweet onion instead of green chiles and used half a cup of Romano cheese. I also only use half a cup of mayonnaise, sprinkle some chile powder in and some drops of tobasco. I serve with pita chips. Delicious and always gone instantly!

Super yummy guilty pleasure. I served with toasted baguette slices. Followed the recipe exactly as written, but added panko bread crumbs and parm to the top. Will definitely make again (and again, and again!). Thanks, Denise!

My family adores this dip!  I also made it for a baby shower and the women gobbled it up, so it's very yummy!  You can heat it up by adding more jalapenos to suit your taste, but this is definitely a crowd pleaser!

I made a few changes, so I can't really give this one a full 5 stars, even though what I made was a real 5 star dip! Good bones to the recipe though, and I will make this again!

I also added ½ cup Panko bread crumbs along with the Parm Cheese & when you bake it in the oven at 375 for 20-25 minutes the top gets a little crispy!

So good! I mixed about 3/4 cup of panko breading with the parmesan. Drizzled a little melted butter. Really good, really easy, very well received.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! The only thing I do differently is add extra chilies, and then I bake it in the oven with seasoned breadcrumbs on top. It is so delicious!

Delish! I used a whole 4 ounce can of jalapeno peppers. And instead of microwaving I baked it at 375 until bubbly. It was a big hit when severed with crostinis and chips.

Made this for a party and it was gone in a flash! People asked for the recipe, which is always a compliment. I halved the recipe and omitted the canned green chilies. I also used 3 large fresh jalapeño peppers WITH ribs and seeds as I wanted all the heat I could get out of them. It was medium heat. Next time, I will add another 1 or 2 whole jalapeños for more heat. I also mixed the parmesan with some panko breadcrumbs (just eyeballed about half and half) on top and baked it.

This recipe is incredible.  Tasted just like jalapeno poppers.  I baked it with a 1/2 cup of panko mixed with the parmeseam and served with a side of strawberry preserves.  Heaven!  My 4 yr old daughter declared that I am the best cook in the world.

I added bread crumbs, used only 1/2 cup of mayo and used 9 whole jalapenos canned (finely diced by hand).  I baked the dip, then served in a crock-pot.

I did use a lot of jalapenos.  This was the perfect amount of spicy for me, but some guests thought it was too spicy.  I would not suggest using a crock pot because the oil tends to separate rather quickly.  While the dip still tastes really good the mouth feel and presentation are kind of gross.  This is obviously from the constant heat.


I think letting the dip sit over night would help to combine flavors a lot better.  I probably wouldn't bother with breadcrumbs again.  Pair with some sort of garlic chip/cracker/pretzel.

This is awesome! This and the chicken wing dip are the two appetizers I am always asked to make. I do also add more jalapenos but that is all a matter of taste. Have also tried the half parm half panko bread crumb topping and I prefer that to just parm. Very good thanks for sharing this easy and wonderful recipe!

Loved this recipe! Was a big hit as an appetizer for our early Christmas celebration. I did substitute the mayo with sour cream, just a personal preference. Super fast to mix up and was gobbled up nearly as quickly! I served it cold with scoopable tortilla chips. I also seeded the jalapeños because kids were eating, but would leave some in for heat if serving to spice-loving adults. Will be making it again in 2 days and I'm sure many times more! Thanks for posting!!

I followed the recipe as-is the first time, using fresh parmesan and it was good. The next time I added fresh cooked bacon and that's the only reason I didn't give the recipe 5 stars--because I feel like that addition really made the recipe for me. Next time I might mix up more fresh parmesan with the cream cheese and mayo because I think that gives it another level of flavor. But overall a stupendous recipe with a lot of compliments from the parties I've taken it to.

This dip is great. You definitely have to increase the jalapeños. I used 5 fresh jalapeños and I probably could have used 6-7 given how much heat these lose in baking.  I served with pretzel thins and it was great. Will definitely make again.

Very good and simple as written.  My friends and I have made this several times, and we prefer to use fresh jalapenos when we have them.  We live on a ranch and are always needing a good dip for brandings and such.  My favorite way to prepare this dip is to use 13 chopped and baked jalapenos, cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, and no green chilies.  I'm making it today, in fact, and I am also going to add some bacon.  Everyone loves this recipe.

I made and served it with crackers, but I added 1 c. Panko crumbs, mixed with 1/4 c. melted butter & 1/2 c. parmesan, mixed together as a topping before I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes.   It was sooooo good!

Oh my goodness this recipe is sooooooooooooo good! I made it for a party and everyone loved it I served it with On the Border restaurant tortilla chips. Everyone said it reminded them of being in high school and ordering jalapeno poppers because that's exactly what the recipe tastes like. Thanks so much for sharing :)

Wow, this tastes just like a jalapeno popper!  I mixed in some shredded cheddar cheese and topped with a mixture of Panko crumbs and shredded cheddar cheese, rather than the parmesan cheese.  Baked in the oven on 400 for 20 minutes and toasted a thinly sliced baguette under the broiler.  This was delicious!  Next time, I will add more jalapenos for an extra kick.

If I could give it 6 stars I would!  This spread is so delicious and disappears every time I take it to a party!  Its different so no one ever has it and I haven't gotten one complaint about it.  I too use the whole can of jalapenos instead of just half...gives it that extra kick!  You can't go wrong with this spread!

I found this recipe when my sister was having a small gathering and just wanted to serve snacks. I read her the recipe (since we live almost 2000 miles apart) and she was a little skeptical about it... to spicy for guests, etc. But she decided to make it anyway and have a couple other things non-spicy. 
She said that this dip went so fast that she and her husband didn't even get any. So about 3 days later she called me from her grocery store and asked me to look up the ingredients so she could make sure she had all of it to make up a batch just for the two of them.
After that I've made it several times for family gatherings. My step-daughter's family hovered around the bowl of dip and ate all the tortilla chips - even the crumbs - until the dip was gone. 
I can't say how good it is from personal experience as I am allergic to cheese, but I'm rating this on the raves I got from my guests and the many times I was asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is my new ALL TIME favorite dip! I did however add an entire 16 oz package cooked bacon. Everyone at my party was begging for the recipe! Next time I might add more jalepenos for extra heat and flavor but that of course is personal taste. Fantastic as is though!

The best spread/dip we have ever had.  Each time I bring it to a get-together, everyone wants the recipe, so now I always have copies with me.  This recipe never fails.  Yummy.

I made this for my husband. I'm not a fan of spicy food. I thought it would be a nice treat for him. He really liked it and it was simple to make.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I made it exactly how the ingredients are listed. I made mine in the microwave because I was pressed for time but I will try the oven next time. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.

Unfortunately, this was not a hit at the party. When this dip is hot, it tastes like a bowl full of warm mayonnaise with a kick to it.

I regularly make this spread for parties and serve with toasted french bread rounds.  Very easy to make and gets lots of 'yums'.

I made this for a Super Bowl party I went to.  Despite the large quantity of food there, most of this dip dissapeared!  I also used the whole can of jalapenos, and it wasn't too spicy.  And I followed anothers advice and mixed breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese for the topping and baked.  It was delicous!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Brought this to a Super Bowl party it was a big hit! I was glad most people were full so I got to take some home! Even my 7 year old loved it. The only change I made was as one reviewer suggested and mixed panko crumbs with the Parmesan.. Loved the bit of crunch added, will definitely make again... And again.

Big hit at my book club! I had split it up into 2 containers so I could use one later. Not such a good idea - if I do that again, I will cut back on the parm on the top because it was about 1" deep! For my garden club who generally are older & think pepper is too spicy, I think I would omit the jalapenos! Great last minute take-along dish - super easy and fast!

I hate restaurant jalapeno poppers, but this is nothing like it.  This is AMAZING! The only thing it needed was more salt, but that would have been taken care of if you used a better quality Parmesan cheese.

Delicious! I followed suggestions and used 6 fresh jalapenos and also used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream! It was a huge hit. We tried it with homemade french bread and tortilla chips and honestly the chips were better for this dip.

Loved this dip. I followed the advice of other reviewers and mixed panko with the Parmesan and baked until the topping started to brown. The dip was quickly devoured! Delicious.

I really loved this recipe. I added the panko bread crumbs and baked for 30 mins on 350* and it turned out wonderful. I also did 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and just one package of cream cheese. 

It was really hard to stop eating and everyone loved it!!! - Next time, I'm going to bake in a more shallow pie(like) dish, so each bite has the breadcrumbs on it.

Easy and really delicious!  I added 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs to the parm, as another reviewer suggested, and followed the "Baked Variation" cooking instructions.  I used pita chips for dipping. So good!

I was really excited and had this at our Superbowl party.  I think it's a good idea but the mayo was so overpowering even though I used 16oz of jalapeños.  I knew better and should have used sour cream. Maybe it's just my taste though.  We love Tex-Mex!

wow, this will definitely be a mainstay on my party food menu! Tasted just like the real thing, but in a much more enjoyable and decadent dip! I took others' advice and doubled the jalapenos to 4 oz, which made it really quite hot - definitely something you should add or subtract to your liking.  I mixed about 1/2 c panko breadcrumbs w the 1 cup FRESH grated pram, and baked uncovered at 375 for 30 mins.  Produced a golden crust that just put this dip over the edge!

This is unbelievable! I added the parmesean/ panko crust on top . Still nuked it then under broiler for a few minutes.Soooooo good! I halved the recipe since it was just hubby and myself and ended up making another batch at  half time, my husband said he wanted to lick the plate! Recommend thin slices of toasted French bread.

This dip is so easy and such a crowd pleaser! I used two cups of freshly grated parmesan cheese and stirred one cup into the mixture and also used the whole can (4 ounces) of Jalapeños and I definitely recommend baking and adding the Panko breadcrumbs on top. It was just the right amount of spicy and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this following the suggestions made.  I did add bacon to the spread, and it was incredible.  Everyone wanted the recipe, and there was no dip left.

Just made this for "treat day" at work - it's getting rave reviews! I made it as per the original recipe and only warmed it in the microwave as I don't have access to an oven at work - delish!

I made this dip with the following changes.  Used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, 8 fresh jalapeños seeded and deveined.  I pureed these ingredients with the cream cheese using a hand blender and put in a pie plate and covered with the bread crumbs mixed with shredded cheddar cheese and used a tbls of olive oil to moisten the bread crumb mixture.  Baked until bubbly in 350 degree oven.  I couldn't believe how much it tasted like the poppers.  I will definitely make again.  The dip was not in the least bit spicy.  So, if you want something spicy then probably add some cayenne pepper or something like that.  We used Tostito chips as well as baked french bread slices.  It really is very yummy.  Please give it a try!

I was kind of disapointed considering the high reviews... 
I did not take the advice to significantly up the amount of peppers like some cooks did- and I really should have- its an absolute must-
I also used low fat mayo and low fat cream cheese which may have affected the outcome... It did taste like a jalapeño popper ... But you better LOVE cream cheese if Want to make this... Very cream cheesy!

Made this recipe as written the first time and it was good.  Made it again and modified the ingredients a bit which really enhanced the flavor.  I replaced mayo with sour cream which has more of a tang to it.  I also incorporated about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar to the dip  Finally, I mixed melted butter, bread  crumbs, garlic powder, salt and pepper and spread it evenly over the top of the dip.  Poppers are usually breaded, so this step makes it taste like the real deal. :)  10 minutes before the dip comes out of the oven, I also sprinkle a bit of cheddar on the top and allow it to melt.  Enjoy! Served this with cubed rye bread and guests literally wanted to lick the plate. Everyone asked for the recipe...so thanks for postng!

This dip was fabulous! I baked it a little bit after microwaving with the Panko breadcrumbs (and sprayed w/Pam) and I think that added a wonderful flavor/texture. My son couldn't resist before guests, so I just added some more breadcrumbs in the one corner and broiled for a minute. Great leftover if there is any!

Delicious, and it really does taste just like jalapeno poppers! I followed some of the other comments and used pepper jack cheese, fresh jalapenos, and 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo, rather than 1 c mayo.

I added grated cheddar and 1/2 the parmesan to the dip, and mixed 1/2 cup panko and 1/2 parmesan for a topper, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Served first with toasted french bread crostini first, and tortilla chips the next time.  The tortilla chips were good with it, but the crostini were better.  YUMMY!

We are huge popper fans and this dip tastes just like the real thing. Before warming the oven, we liked the suggestion to mix 1/2 cup of panko breadcrumbs to 1 cup of fresh parmasan cheese.  Sprinkle on top. Bake 30 min in 375 oven.

Made this and it was excellent!  Just remember the longer it sits the spicier it will get.  I made it a few hours in advance and at first I thought it just tasted like cream cheese but I decided to let it sit and give it a chance.  I tasted it a few hours later before putting it in the oven and it had nice flavor and I nice kick.  I followed others' advice and I mixed the parmesan cheese with about 1/2 cup or so of Panko bread crumbs and put it in 350F oven until the bread crumbs/cheese were golden brown (about 20 minutes). Definitely serve with toasted bread rounds.  Will make it again for sure!

This is my regularly used pitch-in recipe.  Everybody loves it.  The only two things I've done differently from the original is stir the shredded parmesan cheese into the other ingredients whenever I heat it using a crock pot.  (I agree with the author, though; baked is the way to go.)  Also, sometimes I sprinkle some dry breadcrumbs on top before baking.

I halved the recipe and added half the Parmesan with some cheddar jack cheese. I bet it will be even tastier after it sits and the flavors meld. I thought it was even tasty cold! Great with pita chips!

It's a 10!  I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic , 1 fresh jalapeno pepper, 3 tbsp buttermilk, and 1/4 tsp salt just for flavor preference.  On top I used the kraft fresh shredded italian cheese blend - what i had on hand.  It's incredible!

Loved this! I added a few more jalapenos slices then called for and it definitely had a bite, but in a good way! I am making this again for a New Year's celebration.

Delicious.  Solid 5 stars for me.  Stick to what the submitter said.  I used real parm & added a whole 'can' of jalapenos (strong jalapeno flavor but not too hot).  Sprinkled panko & parm on top.  Heated in 450 oven, along w/a pan of lightly buttered baguette 1/4" slices.  Lightly browned the baguette for about 5 mins & dip about 15-20 mins. I really like this dip, an alter to my usual spinach dip.

Big hit at this year's holiday get together.  I ALWAYS make the recipe as written, or I won't review it.  However, I did had panko and parm on top.  Baked it in a pie plate.  It not only tasted great but was gorgeous when I set it out!  Had one guest just eating it with a spoon, and asking for the recipe several times.  That right there makes it a keeper!

Love this dip & everyone who has had it loves it too. I have made it the way the recipe calls for & I have also made it with some substitutions & everyone has loved both ways...
Substitutions consist of 1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt in place of the Mayonnaise for a healthier version. Also using fresh jalapenos in addition to the canned ones. Also adding some of the juice from the jalapenos also adds a nice kick.
Adding mixed cheeses also was a substitution I tried... Pepper Jack, Parmesan, Cheddar, etc...

As a side note, there were just as many who favored the healthier version as did the original version.

This dip was AMAZING !!! The only change I made was to add 1/2c of parmesan into the dip and then sprinkle the remaining cheese on top before heating.  It was absolutely devoured by both the guys and the gals at a cocktail party we held.  Have already been asked 5 times for the recipe.  Will definitely be made again and again !!

This spread really is delicious! Even if you do not care for jalapenos (as I don't), the dip is fabulous. I just had to review this one; mostly to let you know that BACON in this recipe is wonderful. I know the original submitter mentioned that you would think it would be good, but it's not -- so I just wanted to let all you bacon lovers out there know that it is VERY good! Be sure to cook the bacon until very crisp and either chop finely or throw in the food processor for a few pulses. I actually put both my bacon and fresh jalapenos in the food processor to avoid any large chunks, which my guests found unappealing the first time I made it. Give the bacon a try. I think you'll like it! Also, whoever mentioned making it ahead of time and resting in the fridge is brilliant - so much better the next day! And even cold!

I stumbled upon this recipe just in time for a potluck at work. It was a huge hit! I keep getting requests to bring it in again. I topped it with half parm half panko bread crumbs and baked it. It is great on bread (I had french bread on hand). A definite go to dish for an appetizer and a real crowd pleaser.

I guess I have to jump on the bandwagon.  I made this based on the reviews and took it to a Christmas party.  It was a hit.  Three people asked me for the recipe, one being the party host.  There was so much food, and a lot of half eaten appetizers.  Not this one.  Even though it went out late because I had to bake it there, it was completely gone.  I did the baked version, mixed half the fresh parm into the mixture, sprinkled the rest on top,, and used panko.

Just had this dip at a friend's Tupperware party!  WOW!!  Delicious!  She used the tweaked recipe..adding Panko bread crumbs to the Parmasean, and baking for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  I am CERTAINLY going to make this recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of Jalapeno Poppers, but this dip..BEST THING EVER!  She served it with several options, but I liked the pita chip type cracker she served it with!  WONDERFUL recipe!!!

This is amazing! I made it for thanksgiving and everyone wouldn't stop saying how good it was. I'm for sure making this again. I mixed plain bread crumbs and parmesan and put on the top before baking at 350 for 25 min. It was perfect!

I used 1/2 regular cream cheese, 1/2 fat free. I added shredded, sharp cheddar cheese and combined grated Parmesan, Romano, Asiago and Panko bread crumbs on top. I heated in microwave BEFORE adding the cheese-Panko and browned in oven after sprinkling that on top. I also almost tripled the jalapeños. REALLY good dip!!! I agree with the person who said toasted French bread is the best for dipping!

We bake this in a bread bowl in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350, and it's amazing! Add a little jalapeno Tabasco for a little kick. Have to make this for all the family gatherings now!

WOW! Addictive! It's creamy, spicy, and to die for! I did double the jalapenos(I like spicy), and add a tsp of garlic powder, but frankly if I hadn't, it would have been just as grand. After eating some of it, I did end up mixing the Parmesan into the dip, rather than just leaving it on top, and it didn't ruin the texture at all. Try it for your next party, or just for your own family's enjoyment. A smaller crock-pot would work wonderful for this recipe if you want to keep it warm for your guests.

I love jalapeno poppers and this was better than the real thing! You can decide how spicy you want the recipe to be and the mayonnaise is interchangeable with sour cream (if someone has an egg allergy). I did mine in the oven and it was absolutely superb!!

Absolutely delicious, the heat hits you at the end. I added real bacon bits, too. This winter I am going to make this, add a link or 2 of hot Italian sausage (browned and crumbled) and stuff the mixture into jalapenos, then bake for a bit. I am guessing it will rock the football party.

This is a huge hit at parties, and super easy! Use fresh jalapenos if you can - about six should do it- and bake it instead of microwaving.

This is terrific! I used all jalapenos and omitted the green chilies. I also mixed some shredded montery jack cheese into the dip with a little extra mayo and about a tblsp of juice from the jalapeno jar. I topped it with both parmesan and montery jack cheeses mixed with a little panko bread crumbs and then heated it in the oven. We used toasted french bread drizzeled with Tuscan olive oil and a touch of garlic for dipping. A new family favorite!

This was an inspiration for a fantastic spread! Instead of the green chilies and jalapenos, I just used a can of the Rotel green chilies and tomatoes.

This is delicious. And really amazing mixed into mashed potatoes! I've made this with full fat everything, and with 1/3 fat cream cheese and light mayo. I've also tried it with Parm. cheese, Mozz cheese, and cheddar cheese. (I always double jalapenos) All awesome.

Everyone loved it.  We all agreed that it really does taste like jalapeno poppers.  Followed recipe..except...heated in microwave, then put grated parm on the top mixed with a little panko bread crumbs, like so other reviews suggested...then put it under the broiler for a min. or so, until nice and golden brown.  Excellent - everyone wanted the recipe.  Couldn't be easier either.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love jalapeno poppers.  And this was a fantastic dip.  I added the panko bread crumbs to the top with fresh shredded parm and baked it.  Served with toasted baguette slices.  Delish!

Very delicious dip!  I loved it!  I thought it had a perfect heat. I cut the cream cheese, mayo and parmesan cheese in half due to making it for 2 people (and we still had a lot w/doing that).  I used 3 oz of chilies, 2 fresh jalapenos chopped up, about 2-3 tbs of jar jalapenos chopped up and about a 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese mixed all together.  As recommended I mixed the parmesan cheese w/ 1 tbs bread crumbs, but I only had roasted garlic and savory spices bread crumbs.   Baked at 375 for 30 minutes and then broiled for about a minute to brown the cheese a little more.  Ate w/tortilla chips and triscuits.

Success! I cut it down to eight servings, since it's just two of us, and it was a success. My husband [who is a very big fan of jalapenos] ate almost the entire thing. This is definitely going to be a favorite of mine from now on for entertaining. Thanks Denise!

This is so easy and yummy! I followed the original recipe and only added more jalapenos and also added 1/2 cup of panko breadcrumbs to the cheese. Baked it in the oven and Wow! I can't wait to take this to the next tailgate party!! It is GREAT! :)

Yummm! Definitely agree with whoever posted about adding the panko bread crumbs to the Parmesan topping! Everyone loved it and said, 'this stuff is addicting!" I did add about 1/2 old cheddar to the mix but that's all!

I took this to a retirement party in the Oregon countryside and it was such a hit, it was all gone before I made my plate on the buffet line! I used jalapenos and serrano peppers from my garden instead of canned products. 1 shot glass =1 oz canned peppers and it was a smash.  I also microwaved it for 2 min at their place and broiled it on low for 4 minutes or so, watching very carefully to not brown too much on the top. SO easy and I will definitely make it again before the garden dies this year.

Delicious and easy to make. I used the jarred jalapeño slices bc I couldn't find them diced in a can. I also put about a cup of real bacon bits inside. Soooooo good! Even my husband who hates jalapeños loved it. Great for football parties.

Very good base but being from Texas I needed to spice it up a bit. I added garlic powder, cayenne and cumin. Mixed it all then topped with real bacon crumbles heated it up! Sooo, good!

Wonderful.  My wife doesn't like such things so I halved the recipe.  I probably should have cut down the heating time as the Parmesan melted into a solid skin over everything else, but other than that it was top notch.  Next time I will eliminater the parmesan all together, or use much less..

Made according to recipe, no changes. Very tasty. I served it on toasted french bread rounds topped with chopped cilantro and minced fresh jalapeno. I had to use 6 oz chopped canned jalapenos to get any sense of bite. Might try next with cheddar, 1 c parm was salty.

I made the following adjustments per other reviewers suggestions.  2/3 c maynnaise, 1/3 c sour cream.  I used 6 fresh from the garden jalapenos.  I used half cheddar cheese and half parm.  I put some cheddar into the mixture and then I put the cheese on top.  I sprinkled regular bread crumbs on top of the cheese and microwaved for 3 minutes.  AHHHH-mazing!  We LOVED it.  It wasn't too spicy, so if you really want a kick, I'd suggest using even more jalapenos.

Huge hit! Used 6oz of jalapenos and whole bag of parm. cheese ( 1 1/2 cups), by the end of the night besides the bag of chips that went with it, it was the only thing completely finished. So yummy and addicting!

This spread is a crowd favorite!!  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe - it doesn't need any in my opinion.

This was great! My son and I were looking for recipes using the jalapenos we've been growing in the garden. We made this with a little change. Instead of using the canned chiles and canned jalapenos, I seeded and chopped 7 medium jalapenos (we like it spicy). I made up the cream cheese, mayo, jalapeno mixture ahead of time, then refrigerated it for a few hours. I then topped it with the cheese and we baked it. Sooo Good!

Everyone at our party loved this recipe. I added a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and decreased the parmesean cheese to about a half cup and stired it into the recipe instead of sprinkling on top. I increased the jalapenos to 4-6 oz and served it cold because it was an outdoor event. Wonderful, wonderful recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent!  Due to a gross miscalculation on my part I added WAY more jalapeno peppers than I should have...but it was still good! 

After reading the reviews I did opt for using panko on top tho in the end I don't think I needed it because we used tostidos with them and that sort of took the place of the breading...and if I do use them next time I will probably mix with a bit of seasoned bread crumbs as well.

This is SO good baked.  I use fresh Parmesan and mix it with panko bread crumbs.  I serve it with toasted baguette slices or bagel chips.  Also, instead of canned jalapenos, I add 8 fresh deseeded jalapenos.  Next time I'm going to try leaving a couple of the peppers seeded for some heat.

I had seen this recipe mentioned many times on the recipe buzz, when someone is looking for an appetizer to take to a party, and just tried it. I surprisingly had all of the ingredients in the house, but used the calculate button to make 8 servings, or 1 cup, to test it. I would use a shallow dish as the parmesan cheese on top really adds to the dip and I think it would be better spread out. It is so quick to make in the microwave, but I wonder if it wouldn't have been better in the oven. This though makes a very quick and easy dip for a pot luck or party.

Like everyone said... it was a hit! I baked it at 400F for 20 minutes in a round Pyrex and topped it with a mixture of Panko breadcrumbs and freshly grated Parmesan cheese as others suggested.

This is a wonderful dip! You can make it spicier by adding more jalapenos (I wouldn't add more chilies). Made as directed, with the exception of adding jalapenos and served with sliced baguette bread and wheat thins. Everyone loved it!

This morning I was in a pinch--I forgot that we had a Cinco de Mayo potluck at work and had to scramble to figure out a dish. A quick search brought me to this recipe and I am so grateful! This was soooo easy to throw together with one quick run to the store, and it tastes delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is, the only thing I think I would change is to add 2x as many jalapenos but that's because I like the spice. Even as is, it's quite good :) Thank you for this life saving recipe!

This was SOOO good!  Tasted just like a popper! I used a whole jar of jalapenos, and I mixed the1c of parmesan in with the other ingredients and also added some on top with breadcrumbs and baked it in a pie plate in the oven on 350 for 15 minutes.  Came out super!  Will definately be making this A LOT!

I would rate this 5 stars with the edited version. I'm not a mayonaise person so I use cream cheese instead. I've probably made this 30 times, and always asked to bring it again. Pretty amazing.

This recipe is very easy and tastes exactly like jalapeno poppers...except for the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  The Parmesan cheese has an overwhelming initial flavor that I think could be omitted from the recipe.  The leftovers are easy to use also, top triscuit crackers with a spoonful of the dip and bake at 350 for about 15-20 minutes! The triscuit crackers crumble when you bite into them and taste just like poppers with a crunch breading!

Very good. I served it at our Christmas dinner and I received so many compliments on it and request for the recipe. Very good. I love it warm with chips and hubby loves it cold on crackers. I also like to mix the Parmesan cheese in it vs on top.

I found this recipe and made it for a birthday party.  EVERYONE raved over it and were even disappointed when I didn't bring it to the next event.  I also added panko bread crumbs to the top to give it more of that popper taste.  It's amazing!!  I usually dip those square waffle pretzels or french bread into the spread.  Yum!

This dip is always a huge hit.  I have never left a party without being asked for the recipe.  (I generally add the whole 4oz can of jalapenos and do the baked version).

This was WONDERFUL. It sounds nasty becaue the huge cup of mayonnaise. but it tuns out so yummy. I actually mixed the whole amount of parmesan into the mix. put some cheddar on time but some crushed crackers on top also.

Wonderful Best dip ever!!! Easy to make and extremely good you cant go wrong, everyone raves over it and always asks me to bring it now. The only changes I make is I DO NOT bake / warm the dip, its SUPER without. Plus we like things a little more spicy so I dice about a half of a jar of sliced jalapeno's, and top with some itilain bread crumbs along with parmesan. Serve with crackers its great!

The concept alone for this recipe deserves 5 stars.  As written it isn't spicy enough (i'm saying that in comparison to real jalepeno poppers) I tripled the jalapenos and it was perfect.  Don't worry-  the cream cheese really chill out the spicyness.  I am trying this again with a topping of mixed mexican cheeses and bread crumbs.  thanks for the inspiration Denise!

I mixed the parm cheese into the dip.  It was good, but not very spicy, and I used hot jalapenos.  I will add more jalapenos next time.

I made this dip and I was amazed at how tasty it was.  It made a huge amount though, so I had a lot leftover.  I will definitely make this again, but for a larger group.

This was a big hit for the football Sunday crowd. The entire pan was gone by halftime. I used fresh jalapenos (about 6) instead of canned and also added 1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs to the cheese. It was phenomenal. Real mayo (Hellmann's is my favorite) keeps it creamy. Also, the Parmesan cheese needs to be an actual block that is shredded. The fake stuff in the green can probably would have killed the recipe. I'm not sure about replacing some of the mayo with sour cream. I didn't do it that way, so I won't say it doesn't work. However, I can say that the recipe as is does work quite well.

5 stars is not enough for this dip - this recipe is to DIE for - I am a huge appetizer fan and try new recipes all the time.  I have made it about 10 times so far and everyone asks for the recipe.  I did add a few extras - I added some shredded cheddar and real bacon bits to the mixture.  I also used fresh jalapenos - about 3 chopped.  If the recipe is not hot enough - cuz you never know whith japs - I chop fresh ones and put them on the top after it comes out of the oven.  I will be making this recipe for years to come - yum yum!!!

Seriously addicting dip.  I've had to give out the recipe on several occasions already.  I've baked it and microwaved it and been satisfied either way.  I tried just using just the parmesan on top and I also tried adding panko crumbs to the parmesan on top as someone suggested.  Either way, the top gets a little too tough when it cools off a little.  I've since started to simply add the parmesan to the cream cheese mixture.  Problem solved!

Yummy, yummy! My sister brought this appetizer for Thanksgiving in 2009 and we all loved it. I have made it since then and really like the flavor, although I add more jalapenos for heat. But a milder version is good too.

This is great, wish I could give it more stars because it deserves them.  Everywhere I take this dish I am begged for the recipe.  Recently took it to a baby shower and I thought a fight was going to break out over the last of it.    I use one 8oz full fat cream cheese and one 8 oz reduced fat.  I always double the jalapeno peppers, and I'd love to try it with habanero peppers!  It is perfect as it - resist the temptation to add artichokes, tomatoes or bacon until you first try it as written - you won't be sorry.  I

This was excellent and so easy.  The only changes I made was added 1 cup of parm to the dip and then more on top and baked in the oven for 1/2 hour.  Made twice once with regular cream cheese and the 2nd time with Neufchatel.  It has 1/3 the calories and fat and figured you wouldn't miss them with all the other goodies in the dip. Brought to a neighborhood party.  A the end of the party, the dish looked it had been licked clean!  Thank you. This was wonderful.

Blah.  I even added the whole 4 oz can of jalapenos and it's still an overwhelming flavor or creaminess...no kick at all.   I'm cooking turkey bacon right now to crumble in to hopefully add some flavor.   What a bummer.

This is a perfect appetizer, particularly if you're hosting guys. There is never a drop left! I prefer it served with toasted baguette slices. It can be made well in advance and popped into the oven when you're ready. Definitely top with Panko bread crumbs, as recommended earlier...

only with these changes: Bake 400 for 20 min. The mayo makes it bake nicely.  Microwaving it is no comparison. Used freshly grated parm and mixed throughout. Used about 7 oz drained diced jalapenos instead of 2 oz. Added about 2 cups mild cheddar throughout & reserved some for the top. Topping:  combine about 1/3 to 1/2 cp bread crumbs, 2 tblsp melted butter, and remaining cheddar. Sprinkle on top.

Added extra jalapeno to please the hot-heads at the party.  Doubled it and still took home an empty dish.

Made this for a recent party. Everyone gobbled it up! It was great. Only change I made was to add 1/2 C Panko bread crumbs to the cheese on top. Also used the baked version. Would make again and again.

I tried this recipe because it sounded similar to a dip my husband and I had at a restaurant recently that was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted wonderful. And very much alike to the dip we tried at this restaurant. I made baked tortilla chips from freshly made flour tortillas, which were great paired with the dip. Will definately make again and again.

Yummy!  Tried once with fat-free cream cheese and it was horrible.  Will splurge and use regular cream cheese from now on.  I like it with a little more jalapenos mixed in.

I have made this several times now to rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I have been adding the entire 4 oz of chopped jalapeno for a nice, but not overly, spicy-ness.  Also, per other reviewers, I have done 1/2 C parmesan and 1/2 C panko bread crumbs for the topping.  This also is better in a bit shallower dish so the ratio of topping to spread is more even.

This is DELICIOUS and tastes just like a popper.  I've only made it once and followed recipe exactly except after microwaving I put fresh Parmesan and bread crumbs on top and put in broiler for just a couple minutes.  Just add more jalapenos if you prefer more fire in your food.  Your guests will be all over this recipe!  I will be making this again and again.

Outstanding!!!  No one could stop saying how good it was!  I did 4 oz instead of 2 of the diced jalapenos as another reviewer suggested and added the panko crumbs to the cheese before putting on top of the spread.  I also baked it in the oven and served with toasted french bagette slices.  OMG!  Will make many times in the future.

Took this to a party and came back with half of it.  Not sure why because it really is very good.  I followed the recipe except for adding 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs mixed with the parmesan on top.  Gave it more of a deep fried taste.

This was not my cup of tea. I made this for super bowl sunday and it wasn't a hit w/the family. It was a little too sweat for us. When i read it had jalapenos in it i was all in and this had great reviews so I thought this would be a great snack dip. everyone had their prefrences and this was not mine.

I really like this dip. It is sooooooo good. I add more Jalapenos though.  I just keep adding them till I like it. Ive made this twice and each time I have had people ask me for the recipe. In fact I'm craving it just thinking about it right now. I have made this several more times. Every one loves it. Please try this dip it is greatnes . I think it is heat with wheat thins.

This dip is a hit every time I make it.  I'll usually add more jalapeno peppers though, to make it a little bit hotter.  I also get the real shredded parmesan cheese (not the stuff in the shaker) and mix it wil 1/3 cup Panko bread crumbs for the topping.  This makes a delicious cripy top, like fried poppers.

For something so simple this dip really packs a huge flavor punch.  I served it at my housewarming party with buttery crackers and the casserole dish was scraped clean.  I wil definitely be making this again.

The first time i made this recipe it had a strong mayo flavor and tasted like it was missing something. I made some changes the second time. I added another 2 ounces of jalapeno peppers cut the mayo to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. i also halved the Parmesan cheese and added 1/2 cup mozzarella and then mixed it with panko bread crumbs before putting it on top of the spread and baked it. the second time it was awesome. But as the recipe is written i wouldnt give it more than the two stars

I made it exactly how the recipe states. My guests gobbled it up in no time. Tastes just like a jalapeno popper!

I made this for a superbowl party. I thought it was good, not quite great. Everyone else enjoyed it as well. I would like to try it again with cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top.  That might make it five stars. My husband insisted on serving it with tortilla chips but I think baguettes or crackers would have been much better.

I made this for the Gold Medal Olympic Hockey Game, and it was such a big hit!  As per some reviews, I addded the whole can of jalapenos, and I mixed panko bread crumbs with the parmasan cheese on top.  Everyone was amazed that they taste exactly like jalapeno poppers!!! As a matter of fact, when Team USA scored with 24 seconds left in the game, the entire room was totally dejected, and holding our breath with wide eyes, someone piped up, "well, at least we have this jalapeno popper dip!!"  That is how good it is!  GO CANADA!!!!! WOOO HOOOO!!!!

So easy and SO good. Really does tast like Jalapeno Poppers. The next time I make it I think I will add another can of Jalapeno's. I did not find the spread spicey enough, But thats just my tasts. I was tempted to add other ingerdents, but going off the advice of other reviewers I did not. I am so glad. It's perfect the way it is! Don't change a thing! (Unless you love spice..then add more jalapeno!)

Great dip!  I used a lasagna dish and baked it at 350 for about 20 or 25 minutes.  I put half the parm into the dip and then sprinkled the other half on top with about a cup of Panko bread crumbs.  Next time I will add more jalapenos to give it more of a bite!

I love this dip! I have made it twice (oven method) and have gotten rave reviews both times, both from others and from myself. I've been using fresh jalapenos since that's what I had on hand. Two peppers makes it quite spicy, especially if you leave in some of the seeds, but that's exactly what my crowd likes. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This dip is so delicious! Has an awesome flavor and really is so easy to make. I used 6-7 fresh jalapenos in place of canned and just dice them up myself. I also omitted the green chilies because I really don't care for them.

I will admit, I didn't follow the original recipe, how could you after reading all the other reviews. I ended up adding fresh and canned hot peppers, chedder cheese and parmesan.

This was DELICIOUS! I modified it slightly to use half the mayo and added more jalepenos. It was hit at a party I attended and my friends asked me to bring it to the next two parties after. Yummy! People could not leave the dip bowl. This will stay in my recipe box FOREVER! Thanks.

Fantastic!  A huge hit!  I couldn't find green chilies at my grocery, so I used a homemade wiri pepper sauce instead.  I also added some of the brine from the jalapenos.  I think I'll try using this as a casserole with chicken!

Made this for Superbowl Sunday and it was a Super Hit!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I topped it with a mixture of panko bread crumbs and more parmesan (yes, the real stuff) before heating in the oven.  I also used extra jalepenos because we like stuff spicy.  I would hesitate to use cheddar because it is greasy and stringy when it melts.  I would keep the recipe as is.  It's perfect!

I think the serving size is wrong. It should say it serves one because I ate the whole thing. In my defense I halved the recipe so I only ate 16 servings! LOL

Really, really good! This was the biggest hit at the party. One reviewer stated about mixing bread crumbs with the cheese and bake in the oven....that is a must. I melted a little bit of butter and mixed in bread crumbs then the cheese. sprinkle all over the top and bake at 375 of 30 minutes....wonderful!

I made this for my brother to take to a superbowl party and he said it got rave reviews.  He served it with bread and Tostitos scoops.  He had about 1/4 cup of dip leftover, I heated it back up and had the rest of it.  YUMMMM!  This is incredible dip.  I followed the directions exactly.

This is THE #1 requested appetizer that people ask me to make either at my gatherings, or when I'm bringing something to theirs.  It's PHENOMINAL.  I always add the Panko bread crumbs other users have recommended and I definitely recommend oven baking over microwaving.  SO SO SO delicious!! People just stand around the dip until it's gone!

I followed this recipe but I used 4 ounces of diced jalapenos. I mixed the parmesean cheese with some panko breadcrumbs and it was delicious!  Baked at 400 for 25 minutes and broiled for a few for extra crispiness. It tasted just like a popper!!!

Halved the recipe but used 3oz of chopped jalapeno.  Perfect for us spicy food lovers, but I'd tone it down a bit if I was bringing it to a party of wimps :).  I mixed 1/4c of panko with the parm and baked it in the oven.

This was fantastic as is! Do not add bacon! It would ruin the flavors unless you are the type who likes bacon on everything. I did add panko to the parm topping. Came out golden brown and rally did have the just deep fried taste.

Fantastic!  I've made this several times and it's always a hit!  I find it funny that people change recipes on here and then rate it low based on their own nasty substitutions.  So, when I made it as written it got 5 stars.  I do sometimes top it with panko breadcrumbs and use shredded parmesan cheese (not the green can stuff) and it's great either way.  Keep the "base" of this recipe as written and have fun!

That's A LOT of mayo. I stuffed my jap halves and wrap them in half slices of 1/2 cooked bacon-Baked for 20 min-Didn't add the mayo-and used 1/2 the parmesana and 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Delicious. The mayo-Not so much. Gave it 5 stars because the mayo is a personal view and I'm sure it's good.

I take this to parties all the time now...it doesn't get easier or tastier than this. I've left the jalepenos out to make it less spicy before & really didn't change the flavor too much.

I made this last weekend and it was absolutely delicious.  I used fresh parmesan and cooked it in a round pie plate in the microwave.  The only thing I didn't like was that the fresh parmesan formed a crust on top and made it hard to dip the crackers.  I would eliminate the parmesan next time (or might try the kind in the green can.)

Super yummy dip.  Made a small batch to test before super bowl.  I microwaved for a minute after adding jalepeno then put under broiler with the cheese/seasoned bread crumb mix as many others suggested.  Love it can't wait to make it next week!

Made as directed w/the exception of adding all 4 oz of jalapeno. I did use light crm cheese & light mayo.  This was delish!!!!  My wine club gals called it addicting.  I topped w/Panko & Parm & toasted for a few min & served w/baguette.  In permanent rotation.

Big hit at the office pot luck!  Everyone was saying how hot is was.  Really?  hmmm.   When I got home, I check the recipe.  I scaled the recipe to make 15 servings, but,  mis-read the directions and put the whole 4oz can of jalenenos in the mixture instead of only 1 oz!  LOL  They all still loved it and ate all of it.  Some wimps could'nt handle the heat though.

This recipe is amazing! I have made it for several parties and always get asked for the recipe. It is my go-to dip for any occasion. I usually make two batches, one with extra jalapenos for extra kick. This is so easy to make that the students in my special education class can make it independantly. Everyone should try this dip!

Loved this dip! I increased the amount of jalapenos to 4 oz. as others suggested. Spread into a 13x9 inch pan and topped with shredded parmesan before baking. Tasted great! We enjoyed with Triscuits thin crisps and tortilla chips. Best enjoyed warm. The cheese hardens as it cools making it difficult. May try making this in the crockpot next time.

It is requested that I make this often. I have made this for quite some time now. Only thing I do different is add extra green chiles. I use a large can and a half of a small one.

I have made this several times. Every party I go to I am expected to bring this dip. I have even made it while camping. It is an absolute show stopper. I do make couple of changes. #1 I do not use the green chilies. #2 I use a 4 ounce can of jalapenos (I like it spicy) When I initially used this recipe I mixed the parmesan in instead of sprinkling it on top. It turned out so good I havent changed it. I find that using a small crock pot works well to keep it hot during potlucks and dinner parties. I use sourdough baggette slices but people seem to use just about anything to dip into it.  I wouldn't suggest using reduced fat or fat free mayo or cream cheese-I had a friend do it and it was less than perfection. This recipe is fattening, enjoy it, thats what its supposed to be!!!

I don't write reviews at all but I felt the need to share with you all that this recipe is perfect!  I got creative with it and used the spread as a stuffing for mushrooms which went over well with the entire party!  I HIGHLY recommend using this for your mushrooms too!  I followed the reviews of others and added the bread crumbs and baked in the oven to give it a golden top...everything was so awesome.  Will definitely make again.

This is so amazing--but the panko bread crumbs are a MUST! 1/2 cup bread crumbs mixed with 1 cup parm. cheese--it's so yummy!  Tastes just like the breading on traditional jalepeno poppers.  Serve with mini sliced baguette, toasted the last 5 minutes in the oven with the dip.  It turns out perfect!

yes please.    this is sooo good. I used 6 medium sized jalapenos, a can of diced green chiles, and the other stuff (mayo, cream cheese, etc) I did use parmesan, and put about 1/2 cup in the cream cheese mixture, then also on top.   This is like the Uber-Superbowl Dip people.   I served with triscuits and wheat thins.

This dip was really good served with Tostitos. The only issue was, after it started to cool, it began to harden and the cheese oozed grease. The taste was good, but just make sure that you eat it fast while it's still hot.

This is now my go to dip.  I use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  And as others have suggested, I mix half the cheese in the dip and the other half with 1/2 cup of panko and put on top.  Then bake this at 350 for 20min.  We have never had any left and someone always asks for the recipe.  I had to sneak and make a small batch just for myself so I could eat all I wanted...

I followed the recipe to a tee (baked it) and it turned out perfect!  Received compliments from those I served it to - will definitely be making this again.

Made this up the day before and it seemed to  mellow over night so I added more canned jalapeno. I ended up adding double the amount of jalapeno, a dash of worchestershire sauce and garlic powder. I stirred half of the Parmesan cheese into the mixture. By the time I heated this up in the oven, the heat of the jalapeno really intisified and it was too hot for me. But everyone else loved it. I used pita chips, toasted french bread and Triscuit crackers. Triscuits were the most liked.

Wonderful! Made it the first time and served it at Christmas as a dip with butter flavored crackers...the second time that I made it I used crescent dough and made little cups using my mini muffin pan baked them until just baked and then put about a Tablespoon of the filling in each cup and then finished baking until crescent cups were a light brown....FRICKEN INCREDIBLE!!! 10 stars in my book....i just got puff pastries shells and I am will try those and see if they are tasty, they would be more time saving that is for sure!!

My whole family loved this spread.  I sprinkled Panko breadcrumbs on top and sprayed them with Pam to help them brown.  The addition of the Panko breadcrumbs gave the dish a little color and texture.

I thought this was great, though I did slightly alter the recipe. I halved the recipe (just 2 of us, and this was still MORE than enough) and instead of using 1/2 cup of mayo, I used a tablespoon of light mayo and a tablespoon of light sour cream. My cream cheese wasn't softened, so I stuck it in the microwave for 45 seconds- everything mixed together smoothly.  I also added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  We served it with tortilla chips and I had to take the dish away, for fear that my husband would eat almost an entire package of cream cheese in one sitting.

This was one of the best spreads I have ever tasted! I don't believe you can find anyone who doesn't love this, not unless they don't like jalapenos. I don't like it when others try to do their own thing to the recipes on here and then try rate it...I know I'm not the only one. Follow EXACTLY what Denise says, even using the shredded parmesan...NOT GRATED! I have not tried the microwave version, nor would I,  I only use that to heat things up- not to cook :) Everyone I have made this for wants the recipe, it's just that GREAT! I too used the whole 4oz. can of jalapenos like Denise does, we like the heat--isn't that what a jalapeno consists of?? The baked version is the only way to go! THANK YOU Denise, this is so AMAZING! To Katie, asking if anyone has made it the night before, I haven't but I can't see any reason why you couldn't! The green chiles and jalapenos are drained so there shouldn't be any worry, BUT this is so quick to throw together that it really doesn't need to be assembled the night before, then again, I don't know your circumstances.

This spread is so easy to make and is addictingly amazing. Ive been making it for the past two weeks. I had brought it to our family's christmas party and everyone wanted the recipe. Now ive been making it for home for movie snacks! Its wonderful...just be careful if you choose to slice your own fresh peppers...use gloves they burn!

I just got done mixing this up for a party this afternoon.  It's not even in the oven yet and I can't stop eating it!  I did change it up a little...used fresh jalapenos (3 with no seeds) some fresh garlic and cheddar cheese instead of the parm.  I also did 1/2 and 1/2 low fat mayo/sour cream.  When I bake it I'm going to mix the parm with some panko like other reviews suggested.  I can only imagine that it will get better!  Thanks for a new dip recipe!

Tasted just like the name says it will. We were skeptical of the mayo, but used it because of the reviews. I also baked it in the oven, and used some panko bread crumbs mixed with the cheese topping. Delish!

This dip was OK.  I added the entire 4oz can of jalepenos and bread crumbs on top, baked in the oven and served with toasted french bread slices.  It seemed like it was missing something.  I think next time I will try mixing in cheese to the dip before baking.

Oh my goodness, this was just pure piggy heaven!  I didn't realize it made so much!  I had my 3 teenage boys, my sons girlfriend, my fiance and myself for Xmas eve brunch and we had half leftover.  My fiance and I reheated it last night and we still have leftovers again!  I baked mine but I actually thought it tasted even better the following day when I microwaved it.  A keeper for sure!!!
I just wanted to update my review, my husband hates mayo...can't even look at it but he loves this dip so much he has me make it about twice a month.  We love to nibble on it with a loaf of french bread...yummy:)

This was the hit of our Christmas appetizers. Based on other reviews, I used 3 cans of jalapeno's (our family likes spicy), I mixed 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs into the parmesan topping, I baked at 350 for 20 minutes without the topping, then another 10 minutes with the topping.  The result, a crisp crust atop ooey gooey deliciousness.  It really does taste like jalepeno poppers.

Made it for "finger food day" at work. Got rave reviews from everyone!! Making some today for Christmas snacks. Going to try filling Tostitos Scoops with the filling, sprinkle topping on & brown in the oven. Tip: I recommend mixing everything except the topping the night before so the flavors can meld.

I am constantly asked to make this dip.  However, the mayo kind of grossed me out, so I haven't used that since I first made the recipe. In lieu of mayo, I use sour cream. I also always use low fat everything..never have any complaints!!

Had this at a holiday party recently and it was FANTASTIC. Came on here immediately to save. Even my incredibly picky husband raved over it.

This dip tastes like hot mayo. I used the real stuff and real cream cheese, which i never do. Not spicy at all, either. Overall I'm really disappointed.

I love, everybody who's had it loves it.  I decided to kick it up a bit and used about a half of a fresh jalapeno instead of canned, delicious!

YUM! I made this for a baby shower. It was absolutely the hit of the party - for real. Lots of people complimented it & wanted the recipe. I used fresh jalapenos from my garden. I used 1/2 c sour cream & 1/2 c mayo. I added shredded cheese to the cream cheese & on top. I mixed the parmesan w/bread crumbs. Baked it at 300 degrees for 30 min or so. I served it w/Roasted Veggie Ritz crackers but it was also good w/chips. It was awesome & I will make it the same way soon! Thank You Denise!! - Update 5/23/11: I have made this dip many, many times.. It's what I make for almost every get-together that I go to. I have people ask me to bring it & EVERY time I take it somewhere, someone asks me for the recipe. I still love it very much!!

This was so easy - I think next time I would add some parmesan into the mixture as well on top, the more cheese the better!  Used fresh jalepenos and put crumbs on the top too.  Make it at least a day ahead to let the flavors mingle, the longer the better - everyone loved it - will definitely make again.

Awesome!  Took it to a party and it got rave reviews.  Like other reviewers, I put a half cup of parm cheese in the cream cheese mixture, 4 oz of jalapenos & added a half cup of panko to the cup of parm that gets spread on the top.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing.

This is SUCH a hit whenever I take it to any event. I change just a couple of things, I add 2 small cans of the green chiles drained, and 3/4 of a can of jalapenos drained. I also include 3/4 a bag of parmesan cheese while mixing. After putting it in a dish, I sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cheese on top and pop it in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes or until it's bubbling. (So much better than the microwave in my opinion) :) Happy cooking!

Everybody loved this.  It was gone before our dinner was ready.  I grew up in Texas and am used to hot foods.  This dish could have been a little hotter for me, but most of my guests grew up around Massachusetts and they felt it was just right.  My husband said to put this in our list for things to make as a regular company appetizer!

This is not to be believed -- people can't get enough of it, especially the guys.  I added the entire 4 oz can of chopped jalapeno peppers and it gave it the perfect 'bite'.  You won't have to worry about any leftovers with this dip!

This dip great!  I make it whenever we are having a large group over to snack on before dinner, and it disappears every time.  I recommend adding Panko bread crumbs to the topping as suggested in the review from 10/13/08.  It makes a big difference.

ok, this was amazing!  Made this Sunday for my sons Birthday and the whole family loved it.  even the kids were chowing on this.  made as written but think i added a touch more green chilies and also baked in oven instead of microwave.  used the small baguette breads that I broiled in oven for a few minutes and it was really the best for this dip.  This is now going to be at all gatherings from here on out and so quick and easy to make!

I accidentally realized that this would be good eaten as a cheese ball. I made this and had some left over and in the fridge. When it's cold it's the consistency of a cheese ball.  Just spread it on a cracker and eat. The heat is more pronounced when it's cold, too.

While I loved the dip - I only assigned 4 stars because it really needs some additions to be 5 stars.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added more jalapeno peppers - I basically doubled the amount of jalapenos and green chiles.  I also added about a cup of Cheddar Cheese to the mix to give the dip a little more substance.  I did not microwave - I cooked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.  I served with frito scoops and round tortilla chips so people had a choice.  Everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.

I stuck to this recipe just as it is, and it was amazing. People flip out over this stuff! I did do as one reviewer suggested and mix the crumbs and cheese together. So I guess I'm a little bit of a liar, but the basics remained the same and it turned out flawlessly.

I just made this for my family as a test to make sure it was good before I prepared it for my Culinary Arts Class.  For the first time in my life, I followed a recipe exactly, served with Townhouse crackers. It was an absolute hit with my family, I will definitely be making it again.

Such a big hit! I've made this twice now and everyone always loves it.  I use the oven variation, with panko and parmesan, and a LOT of extra jalapenos!  Surround it with toasted baguette slices or Frito Scoops and it will be GONE in no time flat.  Even people who didn't like spicy stuff said they couldn't stop eating it!  Oh, a word to the wise, be careful when warming up leftovers in the microwave.  I did this and one of the jalapeno pieces kind of burst out at me when I removed it from the microwave oven!  I literally have a scar!  But I'm kind of accident prone.  :D  Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing, and super easy.  I have made this a few times since I found the recipe and everyone keeps asking for it!  The only thing I have changed since I made it the first time, is MOREEEE jalapeno!  My family loves spicy foods, and the original recipe just wasnt hot enough for us.  We found the perfect amount for our taste, its a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly and initially thought it was too mayo-y and I couldn't taste the jalopeno flavor at all.  I added significantly more jalopenos, but still thought it was lacking. I refridgerated it and served it warm several hours later and it had somehow gotten much more spicy. I've never cooked with jalopenos so I wonder if that is normal or just a fluke. Either way, the dip was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved it.

This is absolutely delicious! The suggestion from another reviewer to use panko bread crumbs mixed with the parm on top was perfect as it helped create a true, crunchy, "popper" feel. This is my new favorite dip recipe! Thanks Denise!

I thought this was a great recipe. My husband liked it so much he said he was craving it the next week! Its easy to tweak and use what you have available or the low-fat versions and it still turns out great. Thanks!

By far the EASIEST dip I've ever made!  Tasted great and everyone loved it.  I followed the directions exactly except added bread crumbs to the parmesan and broiled it after microwaving.  Used baguette slices as a dipper.

I've used this site for years, and this is the first time I have rated a recipe. OUTSTANDING!!!!  I made this dip for a football party yesterday, and everyone raved about it.  I was asked for the recipe at least 10 times.  I followed the recipe, but like other viewers, I used Cheddar cheese instead of parmesan, and I used canned whole jalapeno's. About 7 of them, chopped and seeded.  Will make this often, it was great. Thank you for sharing!

I made this for my son's handy Manny fiesta bday party and it was the first thing gone. I should have tripled the recipe. It was AWESOME! I used a whole 4oz can of jalapenos and green chili. It had the right amount of kick for us. I grated fresh Parmesan on top then topped that with panko bread crumbs and baked it. I have already been requested to make it for our monthly poker game. This is a keeper!

Oh my god... this was the best! Completely foolproof. I used 1/2c sour cream and 1/2c cup mayo per reviewers suggestions. I also used 1/2c shredded mild cheddar throughout and topped with panko breadcrumbs. I mixed the whole thing in a foil pie tin. 20 mins at 350 and it was steaming hot and delicious. I served with baguette slices. My friends were scraping the bottom of the pie tin frantically to get every last bite!

Within minutes of putting this out, it was gone.  Everyone loved it.  Per the suggestions, I did 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and topping 1/2 parm and 1/2 crumbs and baked.  Thanks for posting - it was easy and delicious.

This dip was so good.  My neighbors loved it for our Labor Day party.  I did not change much to the recipe except added a tad more jalapenos and added bread crumbs to the parmesan.  I baked it until golden. The french bread toasted a bit in the oven made it really good to dip with.

This was a huge hit!  I baked it in a pie dish and served it with lightly toasted baguette slices and tiny little crunchy mini-toasts from Trader Joe's.  So tasty and definitely addicting! It's culinary crack!

This is my favorite party dip and people always request it. I warm cream cheese in microwave, add cheese and other ingredients, and warm again until soft enough to stir together.  Then, I refrigerate for a few hours if possible.  I serve it in a fried taco shell bowl and sprinkle panko crumbs on top.  I serve it with both bread cubes and chips.  It is delicious baked too!  I always use light ingredients and BE SURE TO USE MAYO!

My husband loved this dip. I used five fresh jalapenos, without the seeds. He said he would like it a bit hotter, so I'll probably keep some of the seeds in or use more peppers next time. I also added a layer of bread crumbs and cheese on top. He also spread it on a hamburger and loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

You cannot get any better than this! You may want to put it in front of your guests and step back quickly because they will run you over to devour it! I thinly slice french bread & baked it in the oven for a bit (until crisp) then rubbed it with some raw garlic to serve with the dip. yum yum yum.

I have to say this dip is fatty and rich, with a little kick. I didn't care for it because you really can't eat very much before getting sick and the flavor doesn't lend itself to effortless snacking.

To test the recipe I 1/2'd all the ingredients.  Now I have to make more  because everyone ate it all!  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of the parmesan cheese.  I mixed the cheese with with the other ingredients and then placed a generous layer of cheese on the top.  I baked it in the oven on 350 for about 20 minutes until the top was lightly browned.  I served with tortilla chips.  Next time I will use fresh diced jalapeno.

where has this dip been my whole life?! i planned on making this for my baby shower, but wanted to test it out just to make sure it was actually as good as everyone says. i didnt have any parmesan cheese on hand, i used way more jalapenos/green chilis than the recipe called for im sure (i just eyeballed the ingredients to my taste) & i topped it with crushed butter crackers before i baked it. it was heavenly! thank you for posting this recipe!

I made this dip for an Easter get together that I could not attend.  My husband took all the credit. I doubled the recipe and hubby said it was gone within an hour.  I had people calling me the next day to get the recipe.  A few months later one of the friends was on vacation and called to get the recipe over the phone.  It's a hit and I will keep making for future parties and get togethers.  Thanks

This is a good recipe, it tastes remarkably like a popper.  Definitely stay away from the microwave, use the grated parmesean on top and throw it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I use 6-8 fresh jalapenos, I dice them but do not remove the seeds.

Very good!  I made as is and it was a hit at my BF's party.  I like my dips hot and spicy but since most of our family doesn't I didn't add any extra jalapenos!  I served with pita chips.  Delicious!!!

I make this for every party we have and it's always the first thing to go! I make it exactly how the recipes states but use all lowfat products. Lowfat mayo, cream cheese and parmesan cheese. I also bake it for about 25 minutes at 350 and it gets a nice crust at the top, sooo goood!

I was amazed at how good this turned out.  The recipe didn't sound like it would taste that good, but there were so many good reviews that I had to try it.  I doubled the jalapeños and mixed the parmesan with bread crumbs for a topping.  The topping baked up very nicely.  I followed the suggestion to broil some french bread for dipping.  One note - I used miracle whip (since I had no mayo), and it gave the dish a very slight sweet note.  I will be sure to use real mayo next time.

Delish! I used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream per some other reviewers suggestions.  I used way more jalapenos than the recipie called for...at least double.  I may even add more next time.  I like things with a good kick! I also mixed the parm cheese in instead of putting on top.  Made this for a girls night and they devoured it!  Might try adding some cheddar next time.

Made this exactally how it was EXCEPT added 1 can of artichoke hearts & extra parmesan cheese.  Tasted twice as better as the artichoke dip you get at costco.  This recipe always gets great reviews & there are never leftovers. thank you for this recipe..im making it again tonight.  Also good on top of steaks.

Totally rave reviews from my crowd!  They couldn't stop eating it.  I did use a 4oz can of jalopeno peppers and mixed the panko crumbs with shredded cheddar cheese.  Then just popped it in the oven at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Super easy!

OUTSTANDING!!! I've made this several times and with several different cheeses now... the best way I've had it is using fresh Parmigiano/Reggiano mix and bake for sure with the Panko topping. I've made it with Monterey Jack Cheese and only mild chilies, it was very bland but if you're in a pinch it works. I found that hot sauce helped give it a little more of a controlled kick if your worried about the spiciness.  ***Update*** Kraft now makes a grated Parmigiano/Reggiano mix that works really well in this.

Amazing!  I couldn't find a 2oz. can of diced jalapenos, so I got sliced ones and used what I thought was 2ozs. worth.  I made sure no seeds got it.  This made the dip almost mild.  I will make sure at least a few seeds get in next time to give it a kick!  Definite party keeper!

I made it as directed and we did not like this recipe at all.  I am going to try to salvage it tomorrow by putting in canned chilli, cheddar cheese and hot sauce thus trying to convert it into something else.  I made this to "try" before a big party next weekend and I am glad I did.

I actually served it cold and it went over so well at a party recently!  I missed the part about serving with bread so I used Club and Ritz crackers.  Because of its success and the fact that it's very easy to make, I'm making it again for another party this coming weekend.

This dish was awesome.  I served it at Bunco and it was a total hit.  I doubled the amount of parmesan cheese, but mixed it in instead of sprinkling on top.

Delish & the hit of a recent pool party we took it to. Served it with plain pita chips (Stacy's brand) and used the full 4-oz can of diced jalapenos, since we like things spicy. The bowl was cleaned and scraped within 15 minutes of arrival. Thanks for a terrific and EASY recipe!

Sorry this didn't work out for the reviewer just before me; you really need to follow this recipe to a tee in order for it to be its fabulous self. You just HAVE to use jalapenos and parmesan, no doubt about it. I made this for my husband's 50th birthday party last weekend and got raves raves raves. This week I sent the link to partygoers who insisted on having the recipe, and one I know is making it for her book group this weekend. This is a perfect recipe and a definite keeper. Thank you, Denise!

Easy and fast! Since I am one of the few out there with no microwave, I made this dip in the crock pot and LOVED the end result. At our dinner party, guests couldn't believe how few ingredients there were because the flavor was rich and complex. I will definitely make this again.

Everytime I make this I am asked for the recipe.  I added real bacon pieces and a clove of minced garlic.  People want to lick the bowl!!  I don't even use the canned green chiles or canned pickled japs.  I used three fresh jalapenos chopped with seeds, more if I want it spicier.

I've made this twice & each time I get asked for the recipe!I doubled it and ended up using an entire jar of jalapeno's (we like spicy food!). Must serve with french bread, tastes exactly like a jalapeno popper you'd get from a restaurant!

i gave this 4 stars just because it was kind of boring.  too much cream cheese and mayo and not enough other stuff.  great base recipe though.  i would add in more jalapenos, maybe more green chiles and some garlic powder.  great taste, just needs a little more.  thanks!

Ive been meaning to make this forever and finally made it last night for game night. I used half mayo and half sour cream (not a huge mayo person). I also used pickles jalapenos since those are the ones I liked. This was SO good. I would definately make this again for a potluck, party or game day. It goes fast so you need lots of crackers :)

Took this to Bunco, everyone that tried it asked for the recipe....Taking it again today to a pool party.  The only difference I did was add a little shredded parm. in the recipe and shredded on top, not grated parm.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Made this this weekend and was very excited about it.  Followed the directions to a "T".  There were ten adults and no one was overly impressed.

I absolutely loved this appetizer! I followed what others have said about adding some of the shredded cheese in the dish and some one top. I also added the bread crumbs to the top! I am actually making it again for a party this next weekend!!!

I love this dip!!!! I randomly decided to make it as a snack for my husband and I. It was sooo delicious and addicting... I ate more than enough. :) I did take other people's advice and put bread crumbs on top, however, I think I would have preferred it without them. I'm excited to introduce this recipe to my friends and family. Nice work!!!

Made this dip for New Years Eve. and it was a huge hit.  The only thing I did wrong was I didn't drain the Chilli's and the dip was a little watery, but that didn't stop my family from devouring it!  Thanks for the recipe!

4 stars as is...maybe? I made a lot of changes. First I halved the cream cheese to one 8oz box. I added 2 cans of diced green chilies, and 1 fresh, chopped jalapeno pepper. I kept the parmesan cheese amount the same, but stirred it into the dip instead of letting it set on top. I also added a clove of minced garlic. Instead of putting it in the microwave, I baked it in a pie plate for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. It was fabulous!!

This is the first time I have been "moved" to leave a review.....OMG this is to die for.  I have made this several times and EVERYONE raved and wanted the recipe! The dip disappeared much to fast!  I did bake in the oven for a nice brown crusty top. Excellent

I have brought this to two different parties now and everyone loves it.  I don't drain the chiles and I use light cream cheese and mayo.  I do bake it in the oven topped with a cheese and breadcrumb mixture, as was suggested.  Served it with sliced baguette.

This was the hit of a tailgate party I threw last football season. Jalapenos and cream cheese is a combo that proves there is a God and she/he loves us very much.

I love this dip, it is awesome.  My favorite dip from this website, and I love the warm artichoke and spinach dip and also the dill cucumber toasties.  Make it as is, no panko/bread crumbs, as suggested, and no baking, just microwaving.  It is definitely not spicy.  If you love spicy, then here is what you do [NOTE: this modification is if you are making 1/2 a recipe]: Take a 4 oz can of diced green chilies and a 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos.  Drain both. Combine in a microwave safe dish.  Return 2 oz. (half a can) of the combination to one of the cans and refrigerate for later.  Add 1 cream cheese, 1/2 cup mayo, and 1/2 cup grated Parmesan.  Mix and microwave.  AWESOME.

This was a hit. I used fresh japs, omitted the chilies, used half sour cream and half mayo. I also didn't serve as a dip. I cut a loaf of french bread in half (long ways) and spread the dip on there, then topped with the bread crumbs and cheese and popped it in the oven until the cheese on top was really melted.  My family was eating the falloff on the pan I baked it on!  Also I had to stick toothpicks in the bread to make it stand right, and bake on top. Apparently I pinched the loaf too hard while I was cutting. It kept falling over. :)

I used 2 fresh jalapenos and 4 oz of jalapenos from the jar, then topped it off with parmesan and breadcrumbs. (Pairs best with toasted French/Italian bread!)

This was a pretty good dip.  I did as others suggested and baked it in the oven, and during the last five minutes of baking, I added shredded cheddar cheese and bread crumbs.

I made this spread yesterday to bring to a family party and it was a huge hit! After I completed the dip as per the recipe(minus the parmesan),I put a cover of shredded sharp cheddar over the top followed by a layer of panko bread crumbs.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 and then garnished with fresh jalapeno slices and some cilantro.  I toasted thin slices of french bread and it was to die for! This will definitely be a new staple on my appetizer list. A+++

This is delicious, but I added more jalapenos than what the recipe stated.  I think I ended up with about 5 ounces total.  I used sliced jalapenos from a jar and processed them in a food processor.  And please note this recipe doesn't re-heat pretty the next day.  The mayo components will separate out.  It still tastes delicious but it does not look pretty!

I love this dip! Everywhere I take it everyone loves it and asks for the recipe! I usually add some diced fresh jalapeno's to really kick it up and do half mayo and half sour cream. This has become a favorite dip of ours. Thanks!!!

I made this recipe for a party and it was fantastic. I did add a bit more jalapenos for more bite- some people found it too spicy but those of us that love spicy food- couldn't get enough of it. I added crushed ritz crackers and parmesan cheese to the top. Excellent recipe- I'll definately make this again!!

This was super good! Such a huge hit at the superbowl party. Don't fear if it doesn't taste great when you first mix it...the flavors meld when you cook it & it seems to just get better day after day in the fridge!

I hate being the voice of dissent! But this recipe just didn't do it for me. It did get eaten, but i felt it wasn't better than any other dip recipe. I used all mayo and maybe that was the problem? I might have liked it better if I used part sour cream as suggested by other reviewers. I did bake in the oven. Just wasn't enough going on in the recipe to make it exciting for me I think. I would rather have a velveeta and salsa dip, or something like that.

Although not the healthiest dip for you it is certainly worth all the fat grams and calories!! I tried both heating methods (microwave and oven) and I have to say puttin git in the oven is 10x better.  This dip was the hit of all the food at my party.

Fantastic! Cant go wrong with this - great crowd pleaser.  Took this to a family bday party and it was swarmed. I slightly adjusted after reading many of the reviews. Used 4 oz. of jalapenos, used fresh shredded parmesan cheese and crushed maybe about 10 Ritz crackers and mixed that with the cheese. Put in a 8 inch pie plate, topped with the Ritz/cheese mix and backed at 350 for about 35 minutes. Did serve with toasted homemade italian bread. Was definitely a "bread" dip and not a "tortilla chip" dip. Also, used lite mircale whip and still tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

this is just delicious! even though I changed somethings cuz I am not a big fan of mayo ... so i just used half sour cream, half mayo and put fresh jalapenos in it! and instead of the real parmesan, I used cheddar cheese ( i didnt have parmesan at home)!  and it was just great...

This recipe got raves at a recent baby shower. The only change I made was to put it under the broiler just before serving. It made the Parmesan toasty brown and gave it a little more texture.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  I did make a few alterations. I went against the advice about not adding bacon and I did add some crumbled bacon because thats how I make my jalapeno poppers.  I also added some chedder cheese and montery jack cheese along with the fresh parmesan cheese. I did half sourcream and half mayo instead of all mayo ( I was a little leary of using mayo) This was so yummy.  I will absolutly be making this dip again.

I made this for company exactly to the recipe. I must be honest and say it was quite dissapointing. We make our own jalapeno poppers and it didn't even come close to tasting like them. After I doctored it up with more jalapenos, more green chilis and a cup of grated cheddar, it tasted alot better.

Love it! I do need to add diced fresh jalapeno peppers to the mix because we like the added kick.  I have made this three times now because people at work keep requesting more.  A keeper for sure!

I made this for a Superbowl party and it was gone before the game even started! I thought that the Mayo/Cream cheese mixture was going to turn out weird, but I was so wrong! I can't wait for the next party just so I can bring this!

This was a big hit at our Superbowl party.  I did add some bread crumbs and cheese on the top and broil it for a few minutes to give it a little crunch.

Great recipe! My husband and I cater and this is his new favorite dip. We like it spicy so I add a little extra jalapenos and crumbled ritz crackers on top, or some panko breadcrumbs would probably be good too.

I made this along with 3 other dips and this by far was the favorite!!!! A matter of fact I wasn't going to make it cause I thought oh it going to be spicy but it was perfect, the flavors are outstanding and it will be a standard dip I make when I go out to gatherings!

Very tasty!  Perfect for when you want the taste of a popper, but not the labor.  I agree 100% with the reviews that said to use breadcrumbs on top.  I used panko and can't imagine it being as good without that crunch on top.  I sprayed the cheese/breadcrumb topping with cooking spray and it browned nicely.

Every time I serve this dip everyone asks for the recipe.  I lighten it up by using fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream (in place of the mayo).  All the taste with none of the guilt!  It is also great in tacos and burritos.

This dip is fantastic!  After reading suggestions in other reviews about needing more jalapenos, I used quite a bit more jalapeno than suggested in the recipe, and WOW, I think the recipe might actually be a better guide for me. Still, this was delicious and simple to prepare.  I did use the bread crumbs on top as suggested by another reviewer, and it was really good that way - had a genuine deep-fried jalapeno popper taste.  I got quite a few compliments on this dip, and will prepare it again!

Wow! This was fantastic! As others suggested, I doubled the jalapenos, and so glad I did, because it was perfect. I also topped it with both parmesan and panko crumbs, baked for 30 minutes, then broiled till a nice crust formed - everyone just loved it! I served it with Scoops, and French mini toasts (my personal favorite), and it was gone in no time! Can't wait to make it again!

What a great recipe!  I had several requests for the recipe when I brought it to a Ladies' meeting.  I would recommend throwing in some Cheddar cheese for additional "popper" flavor.  Update: A friend of mine loved this so much that she served it at her daughter's wedding!

5 stars only if: you triple the jalapenos. Way too mild otherwise. I used a combo of jarred and fresh peppers and served with sliced, toasted baguette bites. It was devoured.

This was so delicious!  I used 6 fresh diced jalapenos and a 8oz can of green chilis.  It was so tasty and satisfying!   I also put bread crumbs on the top with some chedder cheese.  I personally dont think it needed the extra cheese because I couldn't really taste it.  I brought some of the leftovers to lunch today and my coworkers shared a small piece of heaven with me!  word to the wise, when chopping jalapenos where gloves! my hands were on fire all night and today :(

Talk about a winner! And I have NEVER eaten a REAL jalapeno popper in my life!(never expect to either when I can have this) Found the recipe here and was feeling adventurous-that and an office party I was tired of taking the same old stuff to!)I actually miscalculated and added more jalapenos and everyone (including me) loved it. Now I can make this stuff in my sleep!! Every time I take it to any function,it is gone within minutes and I am always asked for the recipe.One thing I do is put it in a 2qt. crock pot (on low of course) and top with seasoned bread crumbs. Dont worry about it overcooking-because it is ALWAYS gone before that can happen!!

I added about 3 oz diced jalepenos to this recipe, as suggested by others, and it added just the right amount of kick. We've eaten it with crackers, bread, and chips, and they are good each way.

This was very good and was well-received at a recent party.  You can't beat it for ease of making either.  I used a hand mixer to combine everything.  I tried it both ways and I prefer to mix most of the Parmesan cheese into the dip, reserving enough for a good topping.  I also topped with some finely crushed breadcrumbs as some suggested.    I will probably also double the jalapenos next time as many have suggested.

This is fantastic! Everyone asks for me to bring this to parties, and I am happy too because it's so easy. I whip the mixture in my kitchenaid mixer to make it creamy. And I add about 1T jalepeno juice to spice it up and eat with celery to cut down on calories!

Everyone that tries it loves it. Even people that don't like regular poppers. If you don't want it as spicy, you can use green chilis, if you want it spicier, you can use more jalepeno.

This recipe is so great I almost didn't get any when I made it for my sister's 50th birthday party! Put it together early in the day and then just heated it up later. Will be making for Superbowl Sunday for sure!

This recipe is da bomb!  I would definitely cut the mayo in half and use 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also added monterey jack cheese to the mix and then used 6-7 fresh jalapenos diced, and used Panko bread crumbs and parmesean on top.  This is my favorite app to bring to parties!!!

I love this recipe! Jalapeno Poppers are one of my favorite appetizers when eating out.  But I don't like the calories associated with them.  I have made this recipe with low fat using fat-free cream cheese, and low-fat.  I also use a whole wheat or toasted multi-grain baguette (pop a few in the toaster for an individual fun meal!).  I added a bit of bread crumbs to the top also, as recommended by others to keep the parm cheese from crusting over.

I have to agree with Jennifer. I didn't change anything in this recipe.  No one would eat it and I ended up throwing it out.  It tasted nothing like a jalapeno popper.

Incredible!  Tasted exactly like the restaurant style poppers!  Caution: broil for only a FEW MINUTES to avoid charring the top!!!  :) (If this does happen... just scrape off the top and its still amazing!!!

Excellent spread.  I followed some of the suggestions and added more jalapeno and chilies and I think it was a bit too hot for some of my guests. I will try it just as the recipe says and I think it will appeal to everyone.  Otherwise it was super tasty and easy to make!

This was the bomb diggity! I made this for a New Years Eve party and it was gone. People were asking me as they were eating their first bite of this how to make it. I used all of the ingredients as listed, but used an extra can of jalapeno peppers and used crushed croutons on top. I baked it for 30 minutes on 375 and served it with a fresh sliced french bread. It is the best

I had my doubts about such a simple recipe but this was a big hit! The dish was scraped clean early into the evening and was the only empty appetizer dish on the table. 
I cut jalepeno slices and placed them around the edge of the dish so those who wanted more pop could help themselves and baked it to brown the cheese. 
Got a loaf of french bread, had them cut it at the bakery then cut those slices in half, misted them with spray oil and toasted them under the broier.
Had a bit of trouble getting the cream cheese and mayo smooth (might not have let the cream cheese soften enough?) but was able to whisk it smooth where the spoon had failed. 
Awesome recipe, Thanks!

I tasted this at a Christmas party and it was the hit of the party!  I liked it so much that I made it for New Year's with a couple of small changes to the recipe.  I left out the Parmesan and added a little mexican cheese blend and I used the whole can of diced jalepenos.  It was just the right amount of heat for us.  I served it on sliced french baguettes.  Easy and fabulous!!  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again and again.

Loved It !  I did not read the directions correctly and put the Parmesan Cheese in the whole dip.  I used "REAL" shaved Parm on the top with the suggested bread crumbs lightly sprinkled on top.  Baked it 20 min in 350 oven.  Then took it to a New Year's Eve party in the neighborhood and popped it in my friend's oven for 15 min on 400.  It was GREAT !!  Rave Reviews from all who ate it !

GREAT dip. I brought this to a party and it got rave reviews. I added double the jalapenos and topped it with shredded parmesan cheese. When I baked it, the cheese became nice and brown on top. I'm a fan of mild spicy food, so I really enjoyed this, as did others at the party. I may make a smaller extra hot dish next time with more jalapenos.

This was so good!  It was the first thing gone at my Christmas party.  I didn't have canned jalapenos, only fresh.  I used four, just kept tasting after every one since the heat can vary from jalapenos.  I also used previous suggestions and topped with bread crumbs and baked.  I will make this over and over.

OMG DELISH!!!!!
I made this just like the recipe following some of the  other reviewers suggestions of baking @ 400 for 20 mins w/ Panko bread crumbs.  It was a huge hit.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for such a wonderful appetizer!

I followed a previous suggestion to create a topping out of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs. It was soooo good. The dip tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper. My family used Kashi 7 crackers to scoop up the dip and it gave it a nice crunch. This recipe will definitely come out for many parties in the future.

Great dip! Those who didn't like it at first had it grow on them after a while. I  didn't use as much cream cheese and doubled the jalapenos (i like heat!) and it was fantastic.

Okay, when I first made this and tasted it myself, I thought, "eh....it's okay...." Then I took it to a party that I catered and people couldn't stop eating it! They were actually fighting over it! lol. So it's definitely a keeper!

This is awesome!  My husband ate it and he doesn't even like the original poppers. I made it all fat free and it rocked!  P.S. the leftovers were great with pizza!

Fantastic!  I added about 6oz shredded cheddar cheese to mixture and omitted the parmesan cheese on top.  Baked for about 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  Many compliments.

I took this to a party and it was a hit!  I used 4oz of both peppers and the shredded cheese with Panko crumbs and baked it.  The only issue was the cheese created more of a lattice on the top which had to be cut but it was delicious!  It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe!  This can be made ahead of time. Because I refrigerated it (minus the topping), it needed more cooking time.  I covered it with foil and baked it in the oven for about twenty minutes.  I then took the foil off and then added the topping(so it would not burn). I used twice the jalapenos.  I also used Panko bread crumbs mixed with shredded parmesean cheese.  I did spray the topping with a few sprays of Pam cooking spray.  If you like jalapenos and cream cheese, you'll love this recipe.  I think this recipe is best if not altered.

YUM!!! As others suggested, I baked this dip in an 8x8 pyrex dish instead of microwaving it, and the parmesan cheese gives it such a wonderful crust. I added about an ounce more of jalapenos than the recipe called for, but that was the only change that I made. I made this for Thanksgiving, and again for a cookie exchange. My one friend loved it so much that she made it last weekend, and now we're fighting over which one of us will bring it to the next event!!!

This is so good! I used this recipe for my daughter's graduation party, instead of serving it as a dip I used it as a spread to make tortilla roll-ups. They were gone! Next time I'll make it as the dip. This recipe is a keeper!

I had leftover cheese ball that I didn't know what to do with, so I used it in place of the cream cheese.  Also used entire 4 oz can of jalapenos and sprinkled with cayenne (I like it hot!)  Served with toasted French bread bagette slices...everyone loved it!

Great dip for a party.  I doubled the Jalapeno Peppers, I used Mont/Colby cheese blend b/c thats what I had on had and I mixed about 1 1/2 cups of it in the dip and topped with another cup of Mont/Colby and Panko crumbs. Baked @ 375 for about 30 minutes and served with toasted Italian bread slices. Very, Very good and I will be making it again...soon.

This was excellent!  I brought it to a holiday open house and it disappeared!  it's hard to stop eating it!  I used 2 ounces of canned jalapeno rings and chopped them in my pampered chef chopper because I couldn't find them already chopped.  I served with the Tostitos Flour tortilla chips (which I understand are being discontinued)...it was a perfect pairing!

This was pretty good! I listened to others and increased the jalapenos to 4 oz. For the 1 cup of Parmesan cheese I put 1/2 into the mixture and 1/2 on top (along with Italian bread crumbs). This was very good. Thank you!

Ohhh wow... This was THE hit at thanksgiving! I doubled the recipe and it still wasnt enough. If you like heat and poppers this is your recipe! The only change i made was halved the mayo (used lite m. whip) it tasted funny with that much mayo. Gets spicier when heated up. Thanks a bunch!

Great, easy dip to serve or bring to a get-together.  I made the mistake of putting too many jalapenos in the first time.  When I tasted it before it was baked, it seemed OK but after it was heated, not so much.  Only the people who loved spicy food could eat it but it was still good!

WOW this was really great!  It really tasted exactly like poppers.  I pretty much followed directions, however; I could not find canned diced jalapenos, I bought a 7 oz can of pickled jalapenos, diced them and added.  I did not feel it was hot at all so I added 5 fresh diced jalapenos, still really no heat so next time I will add some of the seeds.  I used the green chilies, 1/2 c miracle whip and 1/2 c sour cream.  Added half the grated cheese to the mix and the other half to the top with the panko bread crumbs sprayed with pam (for bit of browning) and popped in the oven at 350 for 20-30 min.  Served with toasted bread and ritz.

Addictive and super easy!  I added more jalapeno, as I like it a little more spicy.  I heated ours in the microwave since I took this to a party.  Don't worry if your cream cheese is a little hard or lumpy from being cold.  When microwaved, it comes out creamy.

This recipe was delicious!  

My dad (who was picking up the ingredients) accidentally grabbed chipotle chili peppers instead of green and that, I thought, was what really made this recipe fantastic.

Try it! It also makes the dip orangey/red, which I think makes it even more appealing. :)...and perfect for the holidays!

Very good. Taste like the Jack in the box jalepeno poppers.  Big hit at my party.  I read all reviews and added 1 full can of diced jalepenos and it was perfect. I also baked the dip.

I thought for sure this would be a real winner because I love JPs and this recipe had such wonderful ratings.  However, my hopes were too high because I felt this recipe was lacking.  It wasn't nearly as good as the real deal.  It wasn't spicy at all and had to at least triple the jalapenos to make it have a flavor other than cream cheese.  I served it with chips as recommended however, I think it would be better on bread.

We have made this a few times & it is always a huge hit.  I don't use mayo - sour cream instead.  Also, have added more peppers and used cheddar cheese - it is always great!  We serve with pretzel bites & it is outstanding!

This was just ok! It is not something I will make again. We ate some of it but it wasn't something that was addicting.

Fantastic recipe! I made this for a party and it was well recieved. Tasted exactly like jalapeno poppers! Only thing I changed was that I used the whole can of jalapenos and mixed the parm cheese with panko bread crumbs which created a nice crust. Next time, I would add more peppers, we all felt it was not spicy enough.

DO NOT MICROWAVE THIS! Bake it in the oven for 30 min. on 350. I also increase the jalapenos to 4 oz. This is always a hit served with bread pieces.

So popper-ish and perfectly delicious.  I actually followed the recipe (almost) this time.  I did end up using fresh jalapenos (about 7- and only a few seeds because these were muy caliente ones) and just 2 blobs of mayo (I don't care for mayo).  Used grated parm (I was generous here) and some panko.  The top could stand to brown some more.  We'll make it for T-day and serve with sliced baguette and hunks of fresh veggies.  Winner, winner.

As mentioned in the title of the recipe, tastes just like Jalapeno Poppers that you order in a restaurant.  Great for a football party on a chilly day!

Luv this recipe!  This is my first time posting a recipe review but this recipe has been such a success that I just had too!  First of all it's SUPER QUICK & EASY!  Huge pro in my book!  Second, EVERYTIME I make it I have multiple requests for the recipe and many, many rave reviews!  Initially I decided to try this out based on all the positive feedback and thought my guests and family might enjoy it.  I didn't really think I would...I really don't care for mayonnaise for one.  But to my surprise, I love it too!  It can be quite addicting!  Definitely give this one a try!  You definitely won't be disappointed!

This is sooo good. I have made it twice now and both times I have had people begging me for the recipe. A few things that i do differently- half the mayo and use sourcream for the other half portion. Add shredded mexican cheese and topp with cheese and panko flakes (bread crumbs) and bake. The crusty top just makes it the best!.

Wanted SO BAD for this to be a 5...maybe I did something wrong.  But to me, it was way too rich, and it wouldn't stay warm very long.  It definitely tasted like a jalapeno popper...just a little rich.

This is awesome!  I made it for a football get-together and everyone loved it.  My chilis & jalapenos were really mild so I added fresh jalapenos.  Remember...the creaminess of the dip really cools the heat of the peppers.  I baked it with panko crumbs and a drizzle of olive oil.  Served with toasted french bread slices...it disappeared in minutes.

What a disappointment!  I LOVE Jalapeno Poppers, but this didn't even come close.  Turned out soupy and tasted too much like the mayo and not enough like the cream cheese.

This was great. I made this for work and everyone asked for the recipe I served it with toasted baguette rounds and tortilla chips once you start eating this it's hard to stop. I will definately be making this one again.

Scrumptious! I've made it twice and it just gets devoured. I followed most reviewers advice and added more jalapenos and green chiles.

The chef is correct - do not substitute anything in here.  It is perfect just the way it is.  And I agree with her updated comments on baking in a glass pie dish with fresh parmesan - that's the only way I've prepared it and it's always devoured and I'm asked for the recipe constantly!  It's fast, easy and waaaaaay addicting!  Love it, love it, love!  Thank you!

I took this to a Halloween party & it was a big hit!! I had 2 ladies almost tackle me for the recipe! I added the whole 4 oz can of diced jalapenos, & it honestly could have used a little more!(And I don't even like hot/spicy things!)Definately bake it, & next time I will stir the Parmesan into the mixture. I did as another user suggested & mixed the cheese w/ Panko bread crumbs. It was ok but it made a hard crust on top which I found myself digging under to get to the good, creamy stuff! Also served w/ Crostini & sliced baguette both. The baguette was perfect, the Crostini took a little bit away from the flavor. My new fave dip recipe!

Love it! This is so great. I've wanted to make this for so long but no one in my house likes jalapenos but I finally decided to make it for myself and I'm glad I did. I mixed some of the parmesan cheese into the mixture and then topped it with the rest. I also did bake it in the oven so it had a nice crust on top. I toasted up a french baquette and this was my supper tonight. I can't wait to eat the rest of it tommorow.

I took this dish to a Potluck and had to pass the recipe out. That is when you know it's really good. I served it with toasted french bread slices and it was one of the few dishes that was gone by the end of the party. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right, not too spicey. If you prefer more 'heat' add the full 4 oz. can of Jalapenos, it won't hurt it a bit. YUM!! Thanks for a keeper!!!

This got rave reviews at my housewarming party and is now a football party staple!  The first time, I made it exactly like the recipe, now I use light mayo, 1 block of regular cream cheese and 1 block of the reduced-fat cream cheese.  I also add a cup of shredded cheese (usually cheddar).  No one noticed the lower-fat subsitutions, still getting raves!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh, this is good! My guests couldn't get enough. It tastes EXACTLY like a jalapeno popper! I did take the advice of a couple of others and added Panko crumbs to the top. I sprayed the top of the crumbs with spray butter and baked it in the oven. It was crispy on top and creamy underneath. I also used the whole can of jalapenos, and it wasn't too spicy at all. I can't say enough about this recipe and will make it again and again! Thanks for sharing!

Wow, so easy, so good.  I just made this for the first time and won an appetizer competition with it!  And I'm a cooking-beginner so that's saying something for the recipe. Ok details:  Used half sour cream for mayo, made the topping with a thin layer of shredded cheddar, then parmesan, then bread crumbs.  Used the oven method and it came out great.   I didn't double the jalepenos like others suggest because i wanted to appeal to as many folks at the competition as I could, but for my own tastes, thought it could have used more.  I'll try spicing it up next time too.  Great dip!

This was the best. Definitely a keeper. I made it for my mom's b-day and it was gone instantly. I followed the recipe exactly and chose to bake it in a casserole dish. For the parmesan cheese I used the pre-shredded parmesan by sargento. I have already shared this recipes with friends and family. Thanks.

I hesitated to make this because it sounded really spicey hot and my family is not keen on that type of thing-with me as an exception. What I decided to do was take it to a church gathering. Wow!! there was none left, and I am really glad I tried a few bites at home because it was gone before I got any! I tested cooking up a small bit of it in the microwave and was not at all impressed with the way it turned out-guess the parmesan is really oily. Did the rest of it in the oven as some others suggested and it turned out beautifully!

This was awesome!  I was short on time and needed something for a party.  I usually hate taking something that I haven't made before, but after reading the reviews I felt pretty confident.  Boy was I right!  This was such a hit!  I used the baked version and did add about a half a cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture and sprinkled a little on top with some Panko bread crumbs and sprayed it with olive oil pam and it was perfect!!  Will make this one over and over.  Thank you!!

This was so good.  I made it when I was invited to a last minute cookout.  I baked it in the oven alongside a loaf of beer bread which I served it with and everyone loved it!

Excellent - I did what others suggested and mixed a little bread crumbs with the 1 cup of parmesan and tossed with a little olive oil and spread this on the top. I served with toasted baguettes....very good!

I made this dip tonight for my friends and it was a huge hit by all. I forgot to buy the freshly shredded parm and used the stuff in the green can and it was still delicious. I am sure it would be even better had I used the fresh and will try this next time. I also tossed bread crumbs with olive oil as others suggested and sprinkled that on top. It was a great dip that was loved by all- thanks so much!

I cannot believe how good this is!  I followed the directions step-by-step then did what others suggested by adding some panko on top and baking it in the oven.
I bought a french baguette, sliced it thin, drizzled with olive oil and baked on a cookie sheet at the same time that I baked the spread.  The only reason my husband and I didn't eat the entire bowl was because we ran out of bread first!  I'm not kidding, it's that good.

Made this exactly as recipe stated and was disappointed.  Definitely needs cheddar and more jalapenos (heat) - all we tasted was cream cheese and chiles.

Fantastic recipe!  I serve this every year for opening day of football season and preprint copies for all of those who I know are going to ask for the recipe.  I doubl the jalapenos, add chopped fresh jalapenos to the top for garnish and sprinkle with bread crumbs as well.  I also bake it for 15 minutes at 350 instead of microwaving it.  I serve it with bagel chips.

So good! Could easily use more heat though. Next time I will definitely increase the # of jalapeno's used. I did bake this and put a mix of melted butter and bread crumbs on top to get that "fried" effect.

I made this for a Poker Party and it was a hit!  It was gone within 20 minutes.  As suggested by other reviews I used the full 4 oz can of jalapenos and topped with Panko bread crumbs before I baked it.  YUM!

WOW - this got excellent reviews from our family and friends! I have made it five times in the last two weeks with just a few chagnes.  Instead of the parmesan cheese, I used 2 cups of mexican blend shredded cheese.  I added 1 1/2 cup to the mixture before putting it in the pan, then added the other 1/2 cup on top.  On top of that I crushed some Fritoes corn chips and sprinkled them on the top.  It was just great, and gave it a nicer looking presentation.  I would give this six stars if I could!

Absolutely a winner!!! This is so good and was devoured. I was hoping for leftovers after a small get together...and it even though it makes a good amount...it was gone! Loved it. I did do half sour cream/half mayo because it's what I had. And I also added a cup of cheddar cheese to it. I served with New York Style Bagel Crisps and they were perfect. It kind of substitued the breading that is on poppers. But buy the big bag at Sam's Club! Awesome. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I usually serve the same type of dips and spreads but I wanted to try something different. I served this at a couples baby shower and it was a HUGE success!! The guys raved over it! Perfect for any occasion big or small.
Thanks!

I love making this.  It's so incredibly easy to make and everyone loves it.  I'm a bit of a spice freak, so I add more Jalapeno when making it for those that indulge in spice and it's easily toned down for those that don't like the heat.  This is one recipe that I've found that I don't have to tweak to add flavor.  Everyone loves it!!!  I lighten it up by using reduced fat or fat free ingredients...you don't miss a bit of flavor.  YUMMMM!

Fantastic!  I halved the recipe and replaced all the peppers with 6 oz canned jalapenos.  It was HOT but delicious.  I topped with a blend of parm and breadcrumbs (about 1/4 cup each) and baked it in a ramekin (baking is a must!) at 375 for 20 min.  I served with toasted french bread.

Excellent.  Made it for a party, it was gone in minutes.  Had it with toasted baguettes, ritz and my favorite Tastefully Simple Beer Bread.  I put half the parm in the recipe and mixed the other half with bread crumbs and put on top.  Can't wait to make this again.

This really is as awesome as everyone says.  I didn't have access to a stove so I threw everything into a crockpot.  Turned out great.  I love sour cream so I took the suggestion of others and used 1/2c mayo and 1/2c sour cream.  Delicious and easy!!!

this dip was amazing and everyone at the party loved it!!!  I will definitely make it again.  I used fresh jalapeños (no seeds or veins) as I had them in the garden and mixed some shredded cheddar and the parmesan into the mix before I baked it.  I sprinkled a bit more parm on top and baked it.  Before i served it i sprinkled chopped tomatoes on it for a bit of color and it was just delicious!  I agree that is is equally good cold as it is hot!!   thanks for the great recipe!

OMG this is fantastic and my teenage boys loved it too.  I used fresh jalepenos and chilies instead of canned and also stired in the cheese to the dip then put panko on top and microwaved.  WOW!!!!

This was so simple to assemble it should be ILLEGAL!

I wanted to get it ready for tonight, for when my husband got home. Jalapeno Poppers are one of his favorite foods ever, and I've been wanting to make this ever since I saw it on the site.

Only thing different I did was throw the 
peppers in the blender with a bit of mayo, blend until smooth and then add it to the spread ingredients. Made for a more uniform jalapeno flavor. I snuck a bit out for myself to try before he got to it and boy, is that good! I added a little Frank's to mine, just for more kick.

This is going to be a regular in this house for sure!

This dip, made according to directions I felt was just okay. The second time I made it, I halved the recipe, still used 4oz of green chiles, one fresh jalapeno (instead of canned jalapeno), a few dashes of hot sauce, and the parmesan from the can. I did not bake it and this tasted much better! One lovely thing about this recipe is that you can pretty much make it however you like it! Thanks for a good base recipe.

This was a huge hit! I like mine super spicy so I doubled the canned jalapenos and added half of a diced, fresh jalapeno.  I followed other reviewers by adding some breadcrumbs in the mix as well as on top mixed with the parmesan.  Then I baked it for 15 minutes and broiled it to make a crispy top.  Served with baguettes and was delicious!

I have made a lot of appetizers for numerous parties over the years, but this one got the most attention of any. Delicious and easy to make. I did add a little more jalepenos for extra zing. Thanks for the terrific recipe!!!

Loved it!!!! But FYI: I like spicy so I added extra jalapenos, tried it before baking and wasn't tasting the heat so added extra.  The heat comes out a lot more when you bake!!!  I used almost a whole 12 ounces jar and no chilis (didn't have any) and although it was spicy it was excellent.  I also used the bread crumbs per others suggestions and it really adds to the "popper" taste.  Fabulous!!!

Delicious.  I made this ahead of time and used peppers from the garden and it was absolutely wonderful.  People are still talking about it.

This was really good.  Enjoyed by everyone.  I mixed about 1/2 cup of parmasean in dip then I put about 1/4 cup parmasean, about 1/2 cup Planko bread crumbes and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl.  Mixed and topped the dip w/ this prior to baking in the oven.  Excellent!

My family devoured this dip!! I doubled the jalapenos, stirred 1/2 C cheddar cheese into the mixture and microwaved it until it was hot.  I then topped it with more cheddar and fresh break crumbs mixed with butter and broiled it in the oven til the crumbs were lightly browned.  Served it with toasted italian bread.  They liked it so much I had to make another batch as soon as the other one was gone!! Great recipe!!

I added cheddar cheese, a little cayenne and topped it w/ panko breadcrumbs before baking! The crumbs add a nice crunch and make it seem even more like poppers. It's a keeper!

Just a couple of comments...It would be good with all 4oz of jalapeno rather then only using 1/2 a can.  I heated this in the microwave, it took closer to 5 minutes to heat thoroughly, then I popped it under the broiler until cheese was brown and bubbly.  I brought this to a girls beach trip and it disappeared fast.  I served with Ritz & All Bran crackers, the Ritz were a little better.

Followed suggestion to add bread crumbs with a touch of olive oil and I heated in oven instead of microwave at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Big hit at party.

This is my boyfriend's fav! He asks for it at least once a week. The only thing I do different is add in moz+parm. It seems to make it more creamy. I also add ground red pepper and garlic powder for extra kick! I cannot say enough good things about this dip!!!

Oh wow! I've just made this for a Father's Day BBQ and I'm afraid it won't actually make it to the BBQ! My family can't keep thier paws out of it! I tweaked it just a little bit. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder, a little salt and pepper, used the entire 4 oz can of jalapenos, added half of a 4 oz package of shredded parmesan to the mix, topped it with bread crumbs, sprnkled the rest of the shredded parmesan to the top, and baked it. If there's any left, I'll stick it in the microwave for a little bit when I get to the party. But at this rate, it's SO good, I'm just not sure there'll be any left.

Thanks for the phenomenal recipe.

This is yummy!!!!!  It does taste just like a popper...very cheap to make.  Whole frozen poppers are so pricey, so this is a VERY good alternative.  I did add a handful of cheddar cheese, mixed some parmasean in the cream cheese miture and sprinkled some on top along with a small amount of dry bread crumbs.  This WILL be a staple in my house!!

I gave my daughter a graduation party this weekend, and with all my usual party foods, I tried three new recipes. One one this dip, and it was the one everyone raved about. It is delicious! I added almost the whole can of jalapenos, and bought a 7-ounce can of chopped green chiles instead of the 4 ounce. Used freshly grated parmesan cheese and then topped it with a few extra chopped jalapenos for color. Microwaved it for about three minutes and serve. So good! Had lots of requests for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

THE BEST TASTING, EASIEST DIP IN THE WORLD! Next to no prep time, no need to chill first. Super Easy & Delicious!! I nuked is for 3 minutes when I got to my party & then put it under the broiler till it turned brown. Served it with Melba Toast. It was the hit of the party! 

(A little sidenote...I used one package of regular cream cheese and one package of low fat, and you couldn't tell the difference. I also only had grated parm, not shredded, and it worked just fine.)

Thanks for the recipe...it is my "signature dish" from now on!

Very good recipe.  I agree with the other users that this is much better in the oven then the microwave (although the latter is pretty good too!).

I made this last night to take to a last-minute barbeque.  I only had half an hour after getting home from work and luckily this was just as fast to make as everyone said it would be.  It turned out excellent and got lots of compliments! I only made two teeny little changes and that was to add the bread crumbs on top and split my parmesan by mixing half grated into the mix and then the other half fresh shredded on top of the bread crumbs.  I usually have a somewhat liberal hand with jalapenos and this was spicy, but not too spicy for everyone to enjoy.  I served with baguette bread that I sliced and stuck under the broiler on the top rack just long enough to lightly toast it so that it was strong enough to stand up to the thick dip, but still a bit chewy.  Thanks for such a great fast and tasty dip!

Excellent recipe.  Even people who aren't necessarily 'hot food' fans loved this recipe.
Following instructions the recipe is perfect, but I have also added Asiago cheese to the mixture, as well as the parmesan on top.  
It's so easy to be a successful hostess with this recipe.

My guests shamelessly mowed right through this dip....it's like they couldn't stay away from it.

I made it early in the day and chilled it to let flavors blend. I used jalepenos from a jar and probably more than the recipe called for. I mixed about half of the parmesan in with the other ingredients and sprinkled the rest on top..along with some cornflake crumbs for a little crunch. (I intended to use the Panko crumbs like other reviewers mentioned but forgot to look for them at the store). I baked it in the oven and served it with Townhouse Bistro Cornbread crackers.
Thank you to the poster of this recipe for sharing!

Wow!  This was delicious and so beyond easy.  I served this with the Ritz crackers that are pretzel on one side and cracker on the other and it was perfect.  I was sort of concerned that this wouldn't really taste like a popper without crunchy outside.  The crackers added the perfect crunch to this without adding any extra steps to make a top on the dip.  I love that you can just stir this together in under 5 minutes, pop it in the fridge until you are ready to serve it, then just pop it in the microwave for 3 minutes, open a bag of crackers and you have wonderful homemade appetizer.  This is perfect for parties since you don't have to do any last minute prep.  Also, once it cools off it still tastes great and still looks appealing.

This was very good.  I made it as listed, but added 1 C mozzarella cheese and seasoned bread crumbs on top.  I baked this.  It got all eaten up at a Mother's Day lunch.  Thanks!

This recipe is seriously unbelievable. Trust the recipe. Don't go adding stuff to it, it's unlikely you're going to make it much better, if at all. Also, when microwaving, it's okay if it bubbles a lot and looks like it's overcooking. It's not. just stir it up when it's done. It blends the flavors, otherwise you just kind of end up eating spicy cream cheese.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was not nearly as good as I expected.  It wasn't terrible, but I won't make it again.  It was too creamy and not very spicy.

This was soo good! I am always looking for appetizer recipes for Happy Hour and everyone loved this one! I changed things up a bit though - I cooked some bacon, crumbled that and added it. I put shredded sharp cheddar, along with the parmesan cheese and I added the whole can of jalapenos. I also baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 miutes versus the microwave. Sliced and toasted french crusty bread - YUM! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is sooooooo good!  We have brought it for a few family parties and you should see the crowd gather around the bowl!  We bake it in the oven for a few minutes and serve with the Frito Scoops.  Yum!  I am constantly trying to find excuses to make this!

This dip was really good and easy to make...tastes just like a jalapeno popper. Baked with breadcrumbs on top and it did add a nice crunch. Tortilla chips do not taste right with this...the toasted french bread allowed you to taste the full flavor of the dip. Couldn't find the small can of diced jalapenos so i had to cut some and just guestimate on the amount...had to laugh when my father in law started to break a small sweat.

I tossed all the ingredients into my little mini crock pot. Heated it on low for a couple of hours, stirring occasionally. Used approximately 4-5 ounces of jalapeno peppers and it suited everyone's taste buds. No one complained of it being too spicy. Also used light mayo and light cream cheese. This one will be made again soon!

Delicious!  My family loved it.  I accidentaly added the whole can of jalepenos instead of what was called for.  It made the spread spicer...everyone still enjoyed it, but I would have preferred less 'jalapeno' taste.  So watch your measurements. :)

Good, but not exceptional.  After reading reviews, I used 4 oz of jalepenos and switched cheddar for parmesan cheese. I think it would be better with less mayo... it was a little overpowering. It was really easy to make.

*UPDATE* i have made this dip AT LEAST TEN TIMES IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS, EVERYTIME IT HAS BEEN THE BEST DISH AT THE PARTY. ALSO - I THINK IT GOES BEST WITH FRITOS SCOOPS. i made this dip for a super bowl party and everyone loved it!!!! i thought it would be super hot w/ all of the peppers, but it was very tolerable. i used light cream cheese and light mayo and it came out perfect. i had a hard time find those size cans of each pepper, so i used a little more than what was called for, and it only made it better. i would recommend this recipe for any kind of get together. it is very quick and easy and i promise everyone will love it!!

It was a little plain. Spicy yes, but could use a little something extra. Not sure what it is though. Maybe I'll try the bread topping next time.

Love it!  I followed the recipe exactly but based on other reviews it seemed like it might not be hot enough so I used a little 12 oz can of jalapenos and diced them up.  It still wasn't hot enough for us and I think next time I'll try fresh jalapenos for the extra kick.

I read the reviews and added panko to the top and baked in the oven. I would not do it that way again. I used sour cream, which worked well and doubled the jalapenos. Although very tasty it was very mild. I think this would be best in a small crock-pot with the Parmesan mixed in. We did prefer it with the toasted french bread rather than corn chips.

I was very skeptical of this recipe especially when I scoured the grocery store looking for "canned" jalapenos.  So I bought a 12 oz jar of pickled jalapenos and a 4 oz can of diced green chiles.  I drained the jalapenos and put about 1/2 the jar in the food processor to chop them.  Mixed as directed, scooped it into a 9" pie plate, topped with real Parm cheese and sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top and baked 375 for about 30 minutes or until nicely browned.  Even out of the oven, I was worried it wouldn't be good but BOY was I wrong! Tastes just like a popper and perfect amount of heat to it!  It got rave reviews!

Holy cow was this good!!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Like others suggested, I mixed panko with melted butter on top before baking it.  This gave it a sort of grainy crust that mimicks the breading on jalapeno poppers.  We sliced a french baguette thin, put the pieces on a cooking sheet, sprayed with a little olive oil and salt and baked til toasty.  It was perfect, and it was gone fast!!!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except doubled the jalapenos (and I would definitely do that again.) Grated parmesan cheese tasted great and made it easy to dip. I served it with Fritos and tortillas.  This was a hit and many people asked for the recipe!

I made this Friday night for a group of friends, and it was a big hit.  After reading reviews, I added some breadcrumbs to the top before baking in the oven.  I served it with New York Style Sea Salt Bagel Crisps.  I used two cans of green chiles and no jalapenos b/c of some of the people that would be there, but next time I'll definitely add the jalapenos to make it more spicy!

This is excellent dip! And just like it says - addictive! I mixed it up and put it in a mini crockpot on low. It worked out really well and everyone loved it! update: I've made this dip about 20 times now, because every time I get invited somewhere it's requested. Now I just take along copies of the recipe because I know everyone will ask for it.   I've heated in the crockpot, baked it in the oven, microwaved it, and even heated in on the stove top and it turns out equally yummy every time. I do mix the parmesan in when i bake it, rather than leave it on top though - I like it a little better that way.

The best. I only made half of the recipes as we were only having a few people over for poker. Needless to say my daughter volenteered to go the store and get more ingredients if I would make more. Do not let this one pass you by. Made it just as it says.

I made this last night and took it outside to share with the neighbors during our "happy hour."  Five STARS!  Everyone loved it, especially the men.  I served it with Ritz crackers.  I just guessed on the amount of jalepeno since the jar I used was huge and was in grams.  I would add more next time.

I will definetly make it again!

I was expecting something great when I made this, but it is just ok.  Very easy to make.  I used the crockpot.  I made it for a group of people, but the only person who seemed to enjoy it was my husband.  It is very "heavy" and we tend to enjoy healthy food.  Perhaps that is why we didn't like it as much as other reviewers did.

Very good! I made this for New Year's Eve for a quiet family night at home. It was a big hit. I added the bread crumbs, and I'm not too sure about them. If I use them again, I would just put a small amount on, maybe 1/4 cup. Too bad you can't deep fry the bread crumbs for that great crispy taste! This will be used often. I can't wait to take it to a party.

Absolutely delicious! This was definitely a hit at our New Years Day get-together. I was asked for the recipe twice. I used the baking method with freshly grated good quality Parmesean cheese. I wouldn't change a thing about this!

Uh-oh... here's my new addiction.  This is phenomenal and, as the recipe submitter indicates, you really need to use real parmesan cheese, not the powdered junk by Kraft.  I only used the jalapeno peppers and I love the heat it leaves even after sampling a bite or two.  Thankfully, to reduce the calories/fat, I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Smart Balance mayo without compromising flavor or texture.  Good Job, Denise!

This was WONDERFUL!  I made this for a New Year's Eve party. I put in 4oz of Jalapenos, this was a little spicy for some women but I loved it along with the men.   I will definitely be making this at the next party!

This was the first dish empty at our Christmas Eve get together.  It was very good and easy to make.  I don't know how many times I was asked for the recipe.  I added the extra jalapenos and 1/4 c.  bread crumbs to spread and 1/4 c. bread crumbs on top as others suggested...also baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful! I made this for an adult, card party and it didn't last 10 minutes. I used 4 oz of Jalapeno and it didn't make it too spicy at all. I also browned the cheese. Very easy to make-- I made it the day before and put it in the refrig until it was time for the party. Yummy!!!

I made this twice for Christmas functions--once with additional cheddar cheese and once just as the recipe states. We preferred the original recipe. The spread with additional cheese was greasy and did not spread as smoothly. I did add some bread crumbs which made a nice crust. I baked mine in the oven to brown the crumbs. Everyone loved it.

Took this to a Christmas party and it was a hit. I added more Jalapenos and used half the cheese in the mix and half on top with bread crumbs. I baked it on 375 for about 15 minutes. I served the dip with corn chips. I am making it again for my next party.

This recipe was a hit at my family gathering. I listened to the comments and doubled the jalapeños and also added a 1/2 cup of fresh Parmesan cheese right into the mix so the cheese flavor would be carried throughout the dip instead of just on the top. I did sprinkle the top of the dip with more Parmesan and baked it in a 375 oven for 15-18 minutes until the the top was lightly golden brown.

This will quickly become a favorite at my house.  I added twice the amount of jalapenos and about 1/2 t of chipotle hot sauce, this really kicked it up.

Excellent!  I used six-seven whole jalapeños, sprinkled bread crumbs on top and baked in the oven for about 30 minutes.  This recipe is a good one to make the night before and everyone I've made it for loves it.  Thank you.

Very addictive!  My mother-in-law can't stay out of it.  I also added some crumbled up bacon I had left over and boy did that add to the flavor.  Next time I think I might add some crushed pineapple as well for a twist.  Thanks for the recipe I will enjoy experimenting with this.

AWESOME!  Tasted just like a Jalapeno Popper.  I will be making this again tomorrow for another party.  I did not add the green chiles, instead I added an entire jar of Jalapeno's (sliced) and fresh peppers on the top.  I can't wait to have it again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome, I made this the night before a party because I thought it would travel well.  I tasted it when it was just made and it was so good but the next day was even better.  It gets spicier as it sits over night.  I was told that I am bringing this for Christmas.

Outstanding!!!  This dip is amazing!  The dip is not very pretty if you use the parm on top, but that is really the only downfall to this recipe..  I think I am going to try cheddar next time..  Can't wait to eat this stuff again!

Delish....I made this recently for the first time and brought it to a party which I hate to do in case it's not a good one.  But I have to say it was awesome and everyone loved it!  I did add one fresh chopped jalapeno pepper as suggested for an extra kick....So many asked for the recipe!  I highly recommend it.

This was eaten in a quick hurry.  Sooooo  easy.  I baked it to brown the cheese, used a preshredded Italian blend I had in the fridge.  You can vary the spiceness by adding more jalapenos.  A must try.

This was great!! Had to use sour cream instead of cream cheese because that was all I had. To make it thicker I added a bag of mozzarella, a few more jalapenos, and some garlic salt. Turned out great and was gone in no time. Thanks for posting this dip!!

I loved this dip, although it was a little hot for myself and some of the guests.  I used about 4 oz of pickled jalapeños, and used the baked version.  It comes out looking golden and delicious.  Next time I am going to use less jalapeño and add some shredded sharp cheddar to the blend!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to give this a try.At first I thought it was a tad bland. Didn't want to waste it, so I added the following: 6oz. thawed spinach,sliced green onions, minced garlic, and "Johnny's" Garlic Spread seasoning. Sounds weird I know, but it was good . Now it's a family favorite.

I made this for a pre-fourth of July party and it went over so well (everyone was trying to guess what made it so creamy... hint: it's the mayo). 
Recipe is perfect. Wouldn't change a thing and I will make again and again. The only thing I did different was keep it in a crock pot to keep it warm and double the recipe! Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  I made this for my son's birthday party and it went so fast I only got one taste.  At the end of the party everyone wanted me to send them the recipe.  I am making it tonight for us and some neighbors.  Can't wait to have more than one bite!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent.  Tastes just like a good popper.  I used a 4 oz can of jalapenos removed most of the seeds and chopped it up.  I tried the oven but it was taking too long so I ended up sticking it in the microwave and it was great.  The only thing bad about this is the fat content and the fact you could eat the whole thing yourself!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made it exactly as written in the recipe and it turned out AMAZING! I went for the oven option cause I like browned cheese, and it was exactly as I’d hoped!!

This was fantastic. I used a 4oz can of chopped  jalapeños instead of a 2oz.. However, everyone agreed dbl that amt would be even better! So using the 7 1/2 oz can the next time. Used 1/2 mex mix shredded ch and 1/2 parmesan. Used panko bread crumbs on top. Baked for 30 min till bubbly and golden. (Also try adding shredded chicken.) Served with scoops.

This is the best dip ever! I  use a mixture of panko bread crumbs and shredded parmesan cheese to top the dip.  I bake it instead of putting it in the microwave.

Spicy heaven! Perfect for parties, loved by everyone! I did double the amount of jalapenos & used half the amount of mayo replacing the rest with sour cream. Served with soft warm baguette slices.

This dip was delicious and was a huge hit at our New Year’s Eve Party. I add it exactly according to the original recipe except I added the whole 4 oz. can of jalapeños and mixed 1/2 c. of Panko with the 1/2 cup of parmigiana for the topping and baked it in the oven. I will definitely make this again and again.

This dip is a big hit at every party I have taken it to.  I modify it depending on who the dip is for.  If they don't like spicy, I make it as written.  If they are a little more adventurous, I double the jalapenos.  Either way it is delicious.  Serve in a small crock pot to keep warm.  Sometimes I use Parmesan and Romano cheese mix.

After reading other reviews I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. Also, I used one fresh jalapeno instead of the canned. It was delicious and a big hit at the party I brought it too. It was delicious as it but next time I'll add bacon to make them even more like the 'real' jalapeno poppers. This spread was great with crackers and with veggies.

Made this today!! The only thing I changed was adding the bread crumbs to the top. Absolutely the best dip!! I think we could have ate the whole thing between my husband, son and myself! It really does taste like a jalapeño popper!! Oh, I did use fresh jalapeños from my garden, also. Definitely a keeper in our house!!!

Was too much mayo taste for me, but that is  just me!!!   I cut the mayo next time in half with no problems!!  No green chile, but doubled the jalapenos.   I used a combination of crushed Ritz, panko, a handful of finely shredded Mexican cheese blend and fresh fried and chopped bacon on top--it was da BOMB!!!!

I made this for a last minute dinner at my Sister's.  Everyone loved it, and they requested I make it on our upcoming vacation trip.  I did make two adjustments..  My family tends to like things hot, so in addition  I added an extra 2 oz. of the diced Jalapeno's, and I added approximately 2 tsp. crushed red pepper.  It was a hit.  I served mine with Tostito's "scoops".  I did not add the Panko Bread Crumbs, but I may when I make it on vacation.  Great recipe!!

This was a hit a a St. Patricks Day party, but it would be great any day of the week!  I added fresh jalapeño pepper to it instead of canned and I sprinkled dried crushed chili flakes on top of it.  I brought it to a party last night, I had a little tase of it went back a few minutes later for more and it was gone!!

Very yummy. Cheesy, mild heat.  I didn't like the cheese/breadcrumb layer, so will probably just do cheese next time. Baked mine and added more canned jalapenos.  Made for a party and ended up putting leftovers on everything! I will make again.

I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the spread, put it in a small cast iron skillet and baked it  in a  350* oven for about 15 to 20 mins. Served it form the skillet.  YUM!

Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo. I also doubled the jalapenos and added bread crumbs to the top and baked ~30 min at 350. Delicious and sooooo easy! I've brought it to a few parties and have had several people ask for the recipe.

This was a big hit with my Christmas appetizers. Not hard to make at all. Very good with baguette bread.

This recipe is always a huge hit anytime I bring it anywhere! I tend to adjust the recipe each time (sometimes less jalapeños and sometimes more, etc), but I have consistently done 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of 1 cup mayo and we LOVE it that way! I also add breadcrumbs mixed in and sprinkled on top.
This is soooo good and people ALWAYS ask me for the recipe!

Love this recipe! I made it for my surgery crew and now they ask for it for every potluck! Don't change a thing; unless you like it spicier, then add more jalapenos! Thanks!

I took this to Thanksgiving party. It was devoured in minutes with folks asking me for the recipe. I made according to directions, except that I used 1/2 cup chopped jalapenos (from a jar). I also took another reviewer's advice and added panko bread crumbs to the fresh shredded parmesan cheese before baking (375 for 30 min). I will definitely be making this again.

Oh my goodness this was amazing!  I did take another reviewers suggestion and added 1/2 cup Panko to the Parmesan cheese on top. It was a hit for all!  This is going to be my new go to for parties or gatherings. Easy and yummy!  Thank you so much for a really wonderful keeper recipe!!!

Delicious. Will add twice as much of both kinds of chiles next time. And a pinch of salt. Added about a fourth measure of Panko to the amount of cheese used. I halved the recipe, so.... It did help brown the topping nicely. Oven was best I think. Will make again.

This was a big success.  I used Trader Joes sweet pickled jalapeno slices and fresh grated cheese on top.

Next time Ill use a shallow serving dish so I can get a larger surface for more cheese on top and will pop it under the broiler Ill also use more jalapenos.

Got many raves on this dip. I followed the recipe except for using fresh jalapeno. I didn't use enough (I used 1 large w some seeds) thinking it would be hotter. Use several if fresh. This was so easy!

I made this for Super Bowl, what a Hit! So easy and fast. I mixed plain bread crumbs and dry Parmesan for the topping. 3oz of jalapeño and followed the rest as directed. Served with sea salt pita chips. This will be on my appetizer rotation from now on.

Like other reviews, I used 6 fresh jalapeños, fresh parm cheese and unflavored panko. Baked at 300 for 35 minutes. Let me just say, if you like poppers then this is the real deal. Incredible

I  wasn’t able to get a good picture before my dad already dug into it. We all were big fans of this recipe. I followed recipe except I used can chilies, jar jalapeño, and diced fresh jalapeños. Put into a pumpernickel bread bowl. Loved it.

I have been making this for years now and it always gets devoured! I use a whole 4oz can of jalapeños and a 4 oz can of green chili’s. For the cheese I use a bag of Mexican cheese blend. I add a cup to the dip and after baking at 375’ for 20 minutes, I sprinkle another cup on top and bake another 10 minutes. So delicious and easy.

5 stars for the flavor profile. Super easy to put together and my dish is always scraped clean at parties.

I do have recommendations which others have also highlighted:
1. Do not use a whole cup of mayo - reduce to 1/2 or 3/4 cup. When you use 1 cup too much oil can come out when baking.

2. Bake it! It really helps develop the flavors and gives the top a nice color. I like using a 9X13 pyrex so there's more surface area for the topping.

3. Sprinkle panko breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan on top before baking! I put 6 oz of parmesan in the mixture and about 3 oz on top mixed with panko.

4. I use more jalapenos than it states here, and the kind in a jar... about 5 tablespoons chopped up with a little bit of the jarred liquid. If you use the slices meant for nachos it's not very spicy but has good flavor. For an added kick, use the hot jalapeno jarred slices.

5. Serve with Ritz crackers. I haven't tried french bread as one reviewer stated, but Ritz crackers were much much better than chips.

My boyfriend was a big fan of this dip; I didn’t love it quite as much. The bites with a bit of heat from the peppers we’re good, but the pepperless bites were a bit bland. Maybe a little too much mayo?

We ate this with pretzels. I made some slight modifications: 7 oz of chili peppers and about 3-4 oz of the jalapeños.  I didn’t really measure out the Parmesan cheese and just sprinkled some on top from time to time. Used organic mayo.

Amazing!!! I made the dip part exactly per the directions, and I wouldn't change a thing!!!  I did add 3/4 cup of panko bread crumbs to the parmesan topping, and it did help to prevent the cheese from forming an impenetrable 'crust'. I'd recommend doing that, it browned nicely and added a nice crunch. Also, I didn't have time to toast baguette, and wheat thins were awesome with this dip!!!  Definitely making again and again!!!

I've made some variations just for fun. I've used Fiesta Blend cheese instead of the Parmesan. I've also left the cheese out and served it cold. I've increased the peppers for more kick. It's great on anything!

I made this for a party with people from 3 different countries.  It was the hit of the party!  I skipped the chilis and did 6 huuuuge jalapenos.  So many people asked for the recipe.  I love that it was so simple but so delicious!  So good!

I can't get over how good this dip is. I like to mix the ingredients in a small crockpot and set to low a few hours before a party.  French bread cubes, tortillas chips, or a spoon are all amazing.  This makes quite a bit and you will definitely want to share otherwise you will eat it all yourself!

Perfect dish.  I usually stear away from dips like this, but I will use this again for sure.  I used fresh jalapeños to give a tad more crunch.  Other than that, I used it word for word.

If you really want it to taste like jalapeno poppers, add chopped bacon.  Everyone knows poppers are wound in bacon before cooking.

Everyone loved it at the BBQ. Didn't adjust the ingredients as listed on the recipe except for adding about 2 additional ounces of jalapenos. When I tasted it before I baked it, I thought it needed a little more flavor and I was out of green chilies or I would have added those instead. After baking, as other reviewers warned the parm cheese will turn into kind of a thick glob on top of the dish which as it cools becomes harder to "dip" through with a chip or baguette. Thus I put a spoon in the dish to help people scoop through the cheese layer. No one seemed to mind. Next time will mix in 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs with the parm cheese as others have suggested to help the cheese be easier to dip through. This is a keeper!

This was fantastic! I baked it instead of microwaving and the creator was right- the Parmesan gives a nice brown crust. I used it to top grilled burgers and have some left over for a French loaf. Yummy!

Very good, even better the next day. I used about 1/4 of a 12 oz jar of jalapeños because the people I was serving it to are not fond of a lot of heat. I also used the Parmesan and panko  and baked for 15 minutes at 350*. Next time Id put all the ingredients in the food processor. Topping with  the parmsean and panko b fore baking.

This dip is AMAZING! I brought it to a Super Bowl party & it was a hit. People wanted this recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly except I like super spicy foods so I added 2 fresh diced jalapeños & rather than microwaving it I baked it. Again...AMAZING! I will definitely be making this again especially because it's so easy & cheap to make.

This is a fantastic dip and very easy to make.  I usually use the entire 4 oz tin of jalapenos - definitely hot but delicious!  Sometimes it's difficult to get the green chilies where I live so I've also replaced the chilies with a 4 oz tin of green chili sauce and it still tastes terrific!  This dip is a family favorite and gets lots of requests.

it was definitely easy.  I followed the recipe exactly but found it came up short comparing it to a jalapeno popper flavor.  after tasting it beforehand, I went ahead and added the other 2 oz from the can but it didn't do much to add any jalapeno flavor. I think what is missing is the fresh taste of jalapeno.  this may be better using fresh jalapenos instead(as one would find with eating an actual popper) and roasting them beforehand then chopping them up to add, instead of using canned.  I also didn't care for the parmesan on top and found it a tad strange that this was the cheese of choice, seeing how most poppers use cheddar or a cheddar jack. the two flavors didn't mesh well for me.  I used fresh parm too.  maybe adding the cheese to the mixture then crushing some ritz crackers, or some dried breadcrumbs on top might make it seem more true to the name.

Very good dip though I did make some changes to it.

Firstly for a jalapeno dip i found it a bit bland so I doubled the jalapenos and added about 2 tsps of of red chili flakes.

Excellent dip! I used fresh jalapeño and it was excellent. Barely made it to the event I made it for because I had to keep sampling it

This was soooo good!!  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Also added some garlic powder.  I accidentally added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar...OOPS!!!  But it was still delicious.  Served it with toasted baguette.  Will be making this for Christmas Eve!!  Merry Christmas to us!!

I made this on the fly for a quick appetizer I took to a party. I left off the bread crumbs because I wanted to be able to reheat it after baking. It looked a little funky but it tasted wonderful. I added a little more jalapeños as I like mine a little spicier than most. It came out simply delicious and I will be making it again.  I used crackers for dipping.  I think the sirrachi crackers out now would be fabulous with this dip.

This is very good.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and make the following changes:  1) added more jalapeños, 2) add bread crumbs into parmesan for topping and 3) Baked at 400 for 25-30 minutes.  Served with french bread, Ritz crackers and scoops.   Ritz were the favorite.

So easy, so good!!  Everyone raves about this dip.  I do recommend either using toasted bread or plain bagel chips; they seem to bring out the flavor of the dip best and offer nice crunch.

Made for my husbands fantasy football draft. I used almost 4oz of jalapeño and it was a huge hit. I served it with French bread as recommended which they liked but they also liked Tostitos with it.

I've made this dozens of times as request at gatherings. Do the half mayo half sour cream. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bread crumbs on top and use bit of cooking spray. Few Tbs of pickling juice from jar of jalapeños. Dash of Tabasco jalapeños sauce and Tabasco chipotle sauce too.

This recipe is a hit!  I used low-fat cream cheese, reduced the mayo (lo-fat)by half, and replaced the other half with lo-fat sour cream.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I omitted the green chilies and used fresh jalapeno peppers.  I also mixed panko bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese, sprinkled it on top, and baked in a 375 degree oven about 1/2 hour.  I was serving this for 3 people, so made half a recipe, planning on left-overs, but it was gone in no time.
Thank you for a simple, delicious recipe!

I've made this a couple of times now. The first time I made it exactly according to the recipe. And it seriously rocks!  I also made it with topping… I used shredded cheddar, which is all I had, topped with Panko crumbs. The topping kind of added the crunch you would expect from tied poppers. I love this. Probably my new favorite!  I used hot jalapeños. A full 8 ounces.  I'm not somebody who loves extremely spicy stuff but the heat did not bother me. Love love love!

Made this now twice, with full mayo and 6 fresh jalapeños. Never changing that. Never a leftover. Toasted baguette and cucumber slices two great ways to serve.

Basic recipe is very bland. I did use the suggestion of half mayo and half sour cream, with fresh jalapeños. To give it more flavor I added the Parmesan to the mixture then added cumin, cayenne pepper, black pepper and fresh cilantro. It's ok now. Not the best.

This was superlative! Took this to Christmas brunch yesterday and it was a huge hit. So easy to make and take it to a party and heat in microwave on arrival for 3 minutes. Since I like more heat, the only change I made was to also add one diced fresh jalapeno. There was NONE left!!

I have made this recipe for years.  It is a hit at every occasion and my friends and family always request this.  I have found it is best when you double the jalepeno and chiles.  Top with freshly grated asiago if you're feeling fancy.  It is well worth it.

I have made this recipe many times.  I've taken it to many different parties for work, church, baby showers, etc.  It has become my "go to" party dip.  I am now known for this dip.  People beg me to bring it.  I say this because I've read other reviews where people didn't like this or that about it.  Follow the recipe.  I live and work in a very culturally diverse area.  My friends come from many different cultures.  This is a huge hit with everyone, I never bring any home and I am forever being asked for the recipe.

Overall good base receipe; however, I found it a little bland. I added garlic power and Mrs. Dash Jalapeno seasoning. I also substituted the mayo with greek yogurt.

This is my go to dip for most parties.  Tip: use a fresh jalapeno and add bacon. So yummy!

We love this dip & everyone wants the recipe!! I use the low fat cream cheese because the mayo has plenty of fat. Fresh Parmesan &  5 jalapeno's. Panko on top is a must!! Bake @ 350 for 30 min or so. I like it browned up

I made this dip recently with a couple of changes:  (1) Canned jalapenos are no substitution for fresh.   Take the time to use fresh and it will make the difference.  I used six as was recommended by another reviewer. 

(2)  Poppers in restaurants near me often include ground sausage.  I added 1 lb. of browned Bob Evans Zesty Pork Sausage which was a nice addition to the dip.  

(3) I agree with the other reviewers and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I also used panko bread crumbs on top for a nice crunch.

Made this for a potluck and we couldn't get enough, it was the first dish that ran out!  Only change is I added extra jalepeno's for more heat. Perfect for football season, will make again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this for years and it is requested and raved over by friends and family at every event! Slight changes are I add 6-8 oz of jalapeno for a spicier dip. Also I mix in the majority of  parmesan cheese and sprinkle a small amount on top. (fresh parmesan only and I only use Hellman's mayo) I bake until golden brown. I've tried many variations over the years but the simplicity of these few ingredients always turn out tasting the very best!  It's perfect every single time!

This is a very good dip, and would appeal to anyone who enjoys jalapeno poppers, however I did make some changes as stated below.  

I made this twice; the first time, exactly as indicated in the recipe, except I added a panko and parmesean mix to the top before baking.  Because everyone's heat tolerance is different, and it is so subjective, I will try to give you an idea of the heat in this dip, as I made it a few different ways.  I would rate the "heat index" as follows:  if you can barely take any heat at all, then make it with the 2 oz. of diced, canned jalapenos.  After I tried it when it came out of the oven, and realized that the heat was barely noticeable--mostly a mayo and chile taste.  I decided to just mix in another oz. of the diced canned jalapenos.  This made a small difference, but not much.  

The second time I made the dip, I used the whole 4 oz. can, and it definitely bumped up the heat index, more to a level of a mild popper, while still appealing to most taste buds, in my opinion.

I am not a huge heat lover, but I will say that over the last few years, my tolerance is increasing. The second time I made this, it was fine for my taste buds.  Just enough.

I think this would've  been better with the topping cheese mixed in with the cream cheese and peppers. I use half reg cr cheese and half Neufchâtel cr cheese. Mixed the parm. with the panko crumbs but the parm didn't melt at all. Threw in 2 fresh jalapeno's also. It was easy to make and I made the day before. Probably would try again with my changes. BTW I did bake instead of microwave.

OMG--delicious.  I used fresh jalapenos--2 without seeds/ribs and 2 with.  Just the right amount of heat.  I mixed in half the parmesan and sprinkled half on top, but next time I think I'll mix all of it in, as the top got a little too hard when it started to cool.  I used red and yellow bell peppers as dippers and could have eaten every bit of it all by myself!!!

Update 9/18/2015:   This dip is fantastic.  I've made it many times and it is now requested by everyone at work whenever we have any kind of party.  I usually use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, but I made it last weekend for a shower and afterward realized that I had forgotten the mayo.  Not to worry--it was even better without it, not quite as greasy.  I do mix all the parmesan into the spread, as putting it on top made it harder to eat, in my opinion.  And I highly recommend using fresh jalapenos.  I can't tell you how many people have asked for this recipe.  It's really delicious!!

I skipped the Parmesan cheese and used mozzarella. Pretty simple and for a group I would stick with the original recipe of jalapeños.  It's good no questions. Serve with pita chips or sourdough chips. I used this as a spread inside chicken burritos also. Topped with queso blanco.

Great recipe!  Restaurant quality dip!!  I didn't have green chilies so I chopped up about 3 fresh jalapeno's(removed seeds). I also followed the recommendations of others and mixed 3/4C of panko with the parmesan cheese.  I doubled the recipe and gave it to my family and friends.  They loved it and asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!!

It turns out wonderful every time. I usually just put in all in a crock pot, let it heat up, and the enjoy it. I have used canned jalapenos from the store and freshly jarred from the garden. This recipe is so flexible depending on what is in the pantry. I do tend to use less than the recommended amount of Parmesan cheese due to wanting a smooth and creamy texture. Using fresh may increase the flavor without compromising texture as well.

Really yummy! A non-cheese-lover also said he liked it and asked me how to make it for himself. I did skip the parmesan, but it was fine without.

As with everything, I added extras to this recipie. I added a bit of brown sugar to sweeten it. I also added a couple fresh Jalapenos that had been chopped. I added back some of the seeds to spice it up and  instead of just adding the Parm. I made a 1/2 and 1/2 parm- panko bread crumb mixture and baked it in the oven until golden brown. I put it in at 350 and let it go about 30 minutes.

Took this to a BBQ and everyone loved it and said it tasted exactly like the inside of a popper! It was really yummy. Since I love spicy food, next time I'll use the whole can of jalapenos. A may use a little less parmesan also as the bowl was too small for a whole cup piled on top. I mixed the parmesan with panko bread crumbs and the presentation was beautiful.

I've made this a few times and everyone LOVES it! I followed the recipe as is the first couple of times and it was fabulous, then decided to double it and add sharp shredded cheddar cheese to it. We liked it even more with the sharp cheddar in it. Definitely double this recipe if you plan on bringing it to a party... it's always the first thing to get gobbled up and everybody wants the recipe! I bake it in the oven cause I the melted crusty top, then in order to keep it hot I just put it in my crockpot and keep it warm. This is a keeper!!!! thanks for such a great, easy delicious recipe!

I have made this one a few times now and always seem to get lots of positive feedback. As per some other reviews I add a little extra jalapenos as well as I mix panko bread crumbs with the parmesan for a crunchy top. Very good!

Wow, this was spot on for the taste of poppers.  I sub'd only a little using sour cream, and whipped cream cheese, plus just a small bit of mayo for the creamy base.  The suggesstion of mixing panko with the parmesan for the top crust is a good one.  I'll make it again next super bowl party.

Another "keeper"! Served this at this years Annual Super Bowl Party (75 people) and not a smidgen was left. It was extremely easy to assemble, which I did the day before, and 30 minutes before the party started, we popped this in my trusty Breville Smart Oven and Viola! Yummy goodness! The only thing I changed, based on another reviewer's suggestion, was to mix 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs with the freshly grated Parmesan cheese for the topping. It really came out to perfection. Being a Texan, many of my friends like a little spice, so I chose this for the "hot and spicy" offering to go along with Guacamole, BLT Dip and Red Pepper Bean Dip. Everything was enjoyed, but this was the only dip that was completely finished. Had planned on serving with toasted french bread but the server burned it (Oops!), so we used Pita Chips. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is excellent, although it really should be called a dip rather than a spread and more people might find the recipe this way.  Made it last year for the Super Bowl and nobody really ate it, but I was pleasantly surprised and took what I couldn't eat into work the next day and they devoured it!  Now I make it regularly for work birthdays and everyone loves it, even people who can't handle a lot of heat.  I sprinkle the cheese on top and bake for 350 for ~20 minutes until the cheese is melted and browned a little...I have never tried microwaving it. Great with butter crackers, but tortilla chips are also good.  Plus, if you love lots of "pop" you could add more jalapenos to your liking.

This is a family fave for the Super Bowl. I use fresh, diced jalapenos rather than canned, mix the cheese in, top with panko bread crumbs, and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.

DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe as listed, but as suggested by reviewers I added Panko/fresh parm mix as a topping and baked at 350 for 15-20mins. They lick the dish clean every time!  I like to serve with tortilla chips and fresh red pepper strips.

I made this recipe with the whole jar of jalapenos and toasted some panko bread crumbs in butter to add to the top. Everyone loves this and the panko really makes it taste just like a jalapeno popper.

This tastes exactly like poppers.  I do think the secret is to serve it with Triscuits.  It's not as good with other crackers.

Excellent!  I've been making this one for a couple of years.  My husband begs me to make it for special events.  Follow the other advice to add the shredded parm and Panko at the end of baking.  I usally use light cream cheese, cut back the mayo to 3/4 of a cup and add one fresh jalapeno finely diced for some extra kick!  Yum!

This was a hit- even my 21 month old was asking for "dip". 2 people at the party asked for the recipe, so I consider that a success. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe! It was devoured within minutes at our family get together. I also used fresh jalapenos, sour cream and mayo as suggested for a more authentic taste. I also sauteed garlic, shallots in melted butter and mixed with a cup of panko for a topping.Amazing!! I served it with multi-grain tostitos for an appy. Everyone wanted the recipe!

I have served this dip at many parties. I never have any left. Everyone loves it! I serve it with sourdough bread. I slice it thin, drizzle olive oil on top, then bake until they're just crisp. A surprisingly yummy cheesy dip!

Fantastic recipe!  Definately go with the fresh jalopenos and real parmesan cheese.  You will not regret it.  Baking it with a bread crumb mixture (crumbs + bit of butter + more parmesan) makes it incredible.

made this awhile back. I love jalapeno poppers, but hate making them. This was nice and easy, but not as much of a hit at a party as I expected. I will probably try again. Maybe I just lacked something. I put extra hot peppers - maybe I over did it.

OMG, This was wonderful and loved by all! I doubled the amount of jalapenos and i was perfect. Since I already had a large jar of them, I simply diced them myself and used the green chilies can to measure equal amounts of both. This was sooooo yummy with sliced baguettes. So easy, fast, and delish! I read the ingredients quickly before shopping and had to use the "green can" style parm, too, but it was still very good. I didn't measure it, but just generously covered the top - probably less than what the fresh parm called for. Thank you! We will be having this again very soon! Almost forgot - I always use Publix brand neufchatel instead of cream cheese as this brand tastes identical and is less fattening. Do NOT use other brand neufchatel cheese, Publix brand is the only one that tastes just like cream cheese.

A big hit at a football party! I was not sure about the mayo mix but it was great! I used fresh jalapenos and baked on 350 for 15 minutes instead of microwave. Had crackers and tortilla chips on hand - personally liked the crackers best. Perfect football pitch in dish!!

I opted for a vegan mayonnaise replacement (vegannaise)and used slightly less cream cheese than was called for and we still found it a bit too rich! However, I may try this recipe out again and make a few adjustments or play around with it a bit. I would definetely recommend using vegannaise in place of mayonnaise if you have found it too "eggy" or "rich" in the past. However my family is not used to eating dips quite this creamy so it may just be our adjusting taste buds!

Due to an egg allergy, I substituted sour cream for the mayo. It still created the most delicious and addictive dip ever!

I really liked this dip and will make it many more times.  I made it just as written and it was really good.  Having said that, I think the next time I make it, I'll try 1/2 C. of mayo.  I can always add more in later.  I didn't have fresh parmesan :-( and I think that would have made it much better.  I also think that baking it in the oven would give the flavors time to meld together.  Other than that, it's a keeper and a winner, unlike the Dallas Cowboys today.

I've made this several times for parties and I always get asked for the recipe.  I double the jalapeno peppers to 4 oz and I top with 1/2 cup parmesan cheese mixed with 1/2 cup bread crumbs as other reviewers suggested.  Tastes like a jalapeno popper for sure.  Easy and delicious.  p.s. I serve it with Town House (wheat) crackers.

Fantastic!  Super easy, super good!  I used chopped fresh jalapenos from my garden - worked great! Big hit at my party!  I served it with quartered toast (like I use for BLT dip from this site) and crackers.

This is a fool proof dip. Served with wheat ritz crackers and tortilla chips. Crackers were better. Mixed bread crumbs and parmesan for crust in equal amounts but it was too powdery so next time I will just add a little bit of bread crumbs to the parm. Really does taste like poppers! Might try ranch flavored crackers next time since I love to dip my poppers in ranch dressing. Cant wait to make it for super bowl.

This is an EXCELLENT dip! The only thing I add to it is 1-2 stalks of chopped green onions.  It gives it just a wee bit more pizazz!

I made the recipe more or less as written except for doubling the jalapenos to 4 oz. and adding 1/2 Cup of Panko bread crumbs to the Parmesan cheese topping before baking in the oven. It was excellent and I received many compliments on it. It was spicy enough to really enjoy the jalapeno heat without going overboard. Thanks.

I served this at a picnic and it was a huge success.  It gets 5 stars because it tastes so good, and is so easy to make.

We absolutely love this dip! It is a MUST to bake it and we bake it for about 45 minutes instead of the 30 that the recipe suggests. We like the texture better "well-done." I am wondering though if anyone can help us with the parmesan. It always comes out super greasy! We have been using the powdered stuff and it is not even near the taste of real cheese. Please help!

Very nice (addictive) dip!  My guests were divided between which dipper was better between toasted french bread and tortilla chips.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Denise Millar Ramsey!

Fantastic!!  Best recipe discovery this year for me!   If I made this every day I would be 500lbs because it is so good.  I try to limit myself to only make it once a week.

Its good, I used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and I used 4 oz of jalapenos. The extra peppers gave it more of a kick but using miracle whip gave a tangy bit to the mixture. Different from regular poppers but not bad.

Loved it! I mixed ingredients with an electric mixer for a smoother texture. Added sharp shredded cheese to the mix. Baked with bread crumbs. I served this with pita chips and everyone loved it. Said I should make it for every party. So easy I am sure I will be making this recipe a lot.

Absolutely my favorite dip recipes.  I leave out the green chilies, use fresh jalapenos and top it off with parm and plain bread crumbs to give it a nice crunch.  Always a clean bowl :) Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe and has been a hit everytime I bring it to a gathering. I also made some changes. I omitted the chilis and used 4 oz of diced jalapeno or fresh if available. I also added 4 red hot peppers choppeed for extra kick. We love hot stuff. I also used cheddar instead of parmesan because that is how I eat my poppers. It is a great dip and very good on pita chips!

Made it with only one addition: breadcrumbs (probably 3-4 Tbs) mixed with parmesan cheese on top.  Tasted exactly like a real jalapeño popper.  Tried with both toasted french baguette slices and baked pita pieces.  Definitely best with french baguette.  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.  DELICIOUS!

Had to buy a large container of jalepenos, so I skipped the diced chilis and put in about a half cup of chopped jalepenos. It was very good! Thanks for sharing with us, it will become a College Game Day special in our household!!

The Best Ever! I baked in the oven and sprinkled just a little of bread crumbs on top with the parm and also a little cheddar. It comes out so nice and brown and tastes fantastic! Everyone raved about it. Served with wheat crackers,  veggies, almost anything works with this spread.Thanks so much for this excellent recipe!

I mix it up a bit. Cook 3 slices of bacon on stove, Cut bacon real fine. Add bacon grease and chunks to dip. Instead of 1 cup mayo, I do 2/3 cup mayo, 1/3 cup sour cream. I add 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to dip as well. For the top, I layer it with about 1/4 cup cheddar, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, and 1/4 cup Parmesan! So delish!

I made this for my Bunco group and everyone loved it.  I used light mayonnaise, but regular cream cheese.  I will try light next time.  I followed the advice of another review and topped it with fresh grated parmesan mixed with panko crumbs, and I doubled the amount of jalapeno.   I baked it instead of using the microwave.  I served it with a french baguette that I sliced and sprayed with Pam on each side, then baked at 350 until crisp.  This recipe will definitely be one that I make often.

So very good! I cut this in half and put in a glass 8x8 dish (no microwave method at all). I followed the top reveiwer's method w/ the panko and parm on top and it was fab-u-lous!! I also used fresh jalapenos from our garden, 2 of them. Had a kick that was prefect. We LOVED this!

Very tasty at first...made this for guests and everyone enjoyed first few bites.  After that it became kind of greasy tasting...maybe as it cooled down?  I used Panko and parm as the topping.   One guest said he would have like it better without the parm.  Probably won't make again unless having a huge crowd to eat it all even though I cut the recipe down the first time.  Again, very tasty at first, though.

I am speechless.  I took one look at the teeny-tiny list of ingredients and thought, "It must need SOMETHING"!  Wrong!!!  One of my co-workers mentioned at the end of the day on Thursday that we should have a "dip day" on Friday to celebrate the coming weekend.  I saw this recipe and since I had most of the ingredients, I thought - why not.  So glad I did.  I completely agree that with others that it should be heated in the oven.  The only time I strayed from the original recipe was when I added Tex-Mex shredded cheese on top of the dip and then mixed the parmesan with breadcrumbs (as others have suggested).  My dip was the hit of "dip day"!!!  Will use this at every gathering from now on!!!

Awesome!! Took to a Halloween party and everyone loved it.  Only change I made was to the topping.  I added a cup of Italian bread crumbs to the Parmesan cheese to add a little bit more crunch.  Very Good-Very Easy-Very Fast

Good but not spicy enough for us. Next time I will definately triple the amount of jalapenos (double it already and still wasn't hot enough)

WOW tastes exactly like the real jalapeno poppers! I've made this a few times now and it disappears within minutes. I did replace the parmesan cheese with cheddar cheese and I finely diced 3 fresh jalapenos (seeds removed) from our garden. Broiling the breadcrumbs on High for 2 minutes at the end makes all the difference in taste and appearance. 
Thank you Denise for sharing this recipe.

This was oh so good, and tastes just like the expensive poppers we order from our local pizza place. I will now be making this when we get the urge for poppers.  


I did not have any bread crumbs but had a sleeve of Ritz whole wheat crackers, so I stuck them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes to get any mositure out. Once they cooled I smashed them into crumbs and sprinkled on top, baked according to the directions, and served with Scoops.

Great recipe for Football day!  I grated 6 fresh jalapenos and used only 2/3 cup parmesan cheese.  I served it cold and dipped it with Doritos.

If you like all things creamy, like cream cheese and mayo then this is the recipe for you. I tried it out on a bunch of ladies at our supper club and it was gone in 5 minutes! I even got one of my friends who hates sour cream, cream cheese and mayo to eat it and she loved it. Planning on making this again on Sunday night for my husband.

Made this for a family gathering and there wasn't a bite left!!  I microwaved it for two minutes to help make the mixing easier, then topped it with panko bread crumbs and a parm mixture.  Then I baked it for 20 min for a nice crispy topping!!  Fantastic.

I made this dip almost exactly to the 'T'! The only thing changed was that I didn't have canned jalapeno's so I used 4 oz. of fresh jalapenos instead. The dip is great, but not spicy at all. Not sure if that was because of the change in jalapenos or not but overall this dip is fantastic! Next time I would like to really change up the ingredients to get it a little healthier, even if it won't taste exactly like a jalapeno popper. Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious but very rich and a little oily.  I would probably decrease the mayo and parmesean next time.

This was delicious!!  I used most of a 4 oz can of jalapenos and chopped up and added 4 fresh ones (seeded) as well.  We like things spicy!  I also used a thin layer of cheddar jack cheese on top of the spread ingredients and then put the parmesan cheese with bread crumbs over that.  I sprayed the top with Crisco cooking spray.  It created a wonderful "popper-y" kind of breading.  I baked for about 40 minutes at 300 degrees.  Everyone really loved it, especially my husband!  We love jalapeno poppers, but they aren't easy to make at all and this was just as good.  We used buttercrisp crackers for serving, but I think next time we will use plain bagel chips.  Really great spread/dip, perfect for gatherings and football games!

I made this dish last night to entertain friends.  It was a hit!  I did however use all light products to cut down the fat and added extra fresh jalapenos and cayenne pepper (personal preference because I prefer my food very spicy) and the dip was delicious.  Thank You for sharing the recipe, I will definately be making this again.

This recipe is AMAZING! It was a huge hit with my large family. My modifications: 4 fresh jalapeno's instead of canned. (more if you like it spicier) I still added the canned chilies. I also used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan because thats what I had on hand. YUMMO!

I made this for a party recently. I always heed reader reviews so I made sure not to deviate from the recipe. I used shredded parmesan-not powdered. I browned it in the oven. I served it in a little mini-crockpot. It was a HUGE hit. I would have thought my healthy foodie friends would be too particular to eat it, I was amazed how they ate it up!

I made this for Monday night football. Everyone loved it so much that is was gone before the first quarter was over! As suggested by another reviewer I put some bread crumbs on top and sprayed them with butter. It was delicious and tasted like a popper! It's so good I don't think it matters what you use to dip in it!

WOW!  Terrific dip.  I just made it today for the big football games.  The only thing I did different was I added some panko bread crumbs on top with a little melted butter and parm cheese; made a wonderful crust.  If you like poppers, you'll like this.  I served it with Jalepeno tortilla chips.   Thanks so much for sharing!!

Excellent dip!!!  I'll definitely be adding this one to my collection of dip recipes.  I used 4 oz of jalapenos instead of 2 because I like things on the spicy side.  I took it to a pot luck and it got rave reviews.  yum yum

I made this last night for a birthday gathering.  It was a great hit!  Only variation was that I used finely shredded Parmesan cheese and stirred it in to the cream cheese mixture.  I also increased the amount of jalapeno peppers (used 4 ounces - but probably would add even more next time).  Delicious!!!

Very delicious, very inexpensive, very convenient snack!!! I was a bit skeptical with how few ingredients there were and unfortunately it's not healthy at all but soo delicious. I figured with the ratings being as well as they are and having so many great reviews it was worth a shot. I used 4 oz green chilis and 4 oz jalapenos. It was tasty.

So good! So easy and quick to make! Adding to the original recipe i used more jalapenos, added some chili pepper and also topped it with shredded cheddar cheese before heating it. Delicious with corn tortilla chips or pita bread. We especially enjoyed dipping the 'pigs in a blanket' into this dip!

Awesome recipe!!!  Great for football parties, potluck, and any occasion that you want a super tasty and easy appetizer.  I used all 4 ounces of the canned, diced jalapeno peppers and I thought it gave it the perfect amound of heat.  It had a little kick without burning your mouth.  I mixed the cream cheese with the mayonnaise, then added the peppers and parmesan cheese.  I stirred it until everything was well blended and then put it all in my little 2-quart crockpot.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours and then turned it down to warm.  I took it to work and it was gone before lunch was over.  I served it with Triscuits and tortilla chips.  Everyone went crazy over this dish, and I had many, many requests for the recipe.  I'm making this again this weekend for my granddaughter's birthday party.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful dish!  :)

Wow! It took me hardly anytime to prepare this yet I heard compliments ALL night long! On the advice of other reviewers, I added 1/2C panko mixed in with 1C (shredded) mozzarella on top and baked the dip till it was golden on top. Perfection!

I am a big fan of jalapeños and love this dip!  I have brought it to several parties and everyone raves about how great it is.  I prefer to mix the Parmesan cheese in rather than sprinkling it on top and instead of canned jalapeños, I use three real ones with the seeds.  I also add 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions.

I made it; they LOVED IT!!! Oh my God this was so good! It was mild enough for everyone but a few mentioned that they would like it to be more spicy. When I make it again, I'm doubling the jalapenos. So good.

Made this for my husband to try before I brought it to an upcoming event where we all try to outdo eachother. My husband LOVED it and it was gone in 1 sitting. Yes, I may have helped a bit but he did the majority of the damage. He does not like mayo so I did switch for the FF Sour cream, us 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fresh parmesan cheese. THIS IS DELICIOUS! I am proud and excited to bring it to the get together. Taste JUST like a popper even in the lowfat version. Texture was great.

As written, the recipe does not work well together in the microwave.  The time is not correct.  The cheese on top does not melt and the taste is so/so.  It seems like most of the reviews changed something about the recipe.  Baking might improve the texture.

People go nuts when I make this! My husband wishes that I would just make this every week and keep it in the fridge for him to eat all the time and put on things. It is really good and everyone I've served it to loved it. I think I put quite a bit of shredded parmesan cheese in it than the recipe calls for but that's my favorite part.

I made this the other night.  I made on the "mild" side with a few less jalapeno's, but those eating it still thought it was great.  I didn't cook it in the oven, but I did microwave it.  Definitely tastes better warmed up.  Next time I'll add more peppers

Really was a hit at our superbowl gathering.  I more than doubled the jalapeños and used fire roasted chiles.  Added panko and Parmesan to the top and sprayed with Pam as others suggested.  This did taste like poppers, although it is missing the flavor of popper breading, even with the panko.  Might add more next time.  Really good though!  served with toasted baguette,

If I could rate this 10 stars, I would... The baked version, with breadcrumbs (panko is great, but regular/italian/seasoned works just fine) mixed into the parmesean is AMAZING and totally addictive. I add about 1/2-3/4 c shredded mexican blend cheese, and the whole 4oz can of jalapenos, also I use a 7oz can of green chiles.. Bake at 350 or 375 for abt 30 until brown, and OMG! The microwaved version works pretty well though, esp if you dont have the option of baking.. Definitely a new go-to potluck/party standby!

Amazing .... I recommend adding 1 cup of breadcrumbs on top, and baking in the oven. Also I substituted the mayo for 1 cup sour cream, and the green chilies for additional canned diced jalapenos.

This was excellent!!  I did, however, use 2 (4oz) cans of jalapeno and omitted the parma cheese and served cold, alomst like a cheese ball.  Everyone loved it!!  Thank you Denise.

Awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1/2 the parmesan in the mix and the other 1/2 on top and baked for 1/2 hr.  I had whole canned jalapenos so I chopped up 5 large ones and it had a nice kick. I brought my dish home empty!

I've made this twice now-once following the recipe exactly and the second time with some minor changes:  double the quantities of jalapenos (I used canned) and mixed the parmesan with an equal amount of panko as some other reviewers suggested.  Much better the second time!  I think it also best when cooked in a wide shallow dish so that there is lots of crunchy, cheesy topping.   Big hit with my friends!

SUPER RECIPE!  I've brought it to many parties, and there is never any left over and I am always asked for the recipe by several people at each party.    I actually DOUBLE the diced drained jalapenos to give it a real kick, and everyone loves it that way - but I am in southern Texas, so take that into consideration!  If that sounds like too much jalapeno for you, try increasing the jalapenos just a little at a time.

Wow! This is terrific!  I followed the directions pretty closely, I couldn't find a 2 oz can of jalapenos, so added the entire 4 oz. can.  I mixed everything in the mixer and got a nice, smooth dip.  I covered the top of the dip with parmesan and bread crumbs.  I served this with Club crackers, they worked great!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I'm always looking for new things to make and now I'm stuck again because all my friends and family want me to make this all the time....  O'ya I put this in the oven instead of the microwave 350 about 1/2 hour not covered:)

Very good! I followed the advice of the reviewer who recommended mixing some panko breadcrumbs in with the parmesan. I also used 7 fresh jalapenos instead of canned. I thought it was perfect, but some did say it was a little hot.

AMAZING DIP! I didn't have parmesean, so I added a little mozzarella to the mix.  Luckily, I cut the recipe and only made a quarter of it because I ATE IT ALL to myself. Haha. Great recipe. Yummy!

Awsome, I just used straight jalapenos since I like spice.  The sugestion about mixing some bread crumbs was great it makes it easy to break throught.  I used plain bagels cut up and it was great. I also tried a bit of garlic powder and cayenne in the topping.  This is great and you can make it your own with easy little tweaks.

Holy YUM!!  As others suggested, I doubled the jalapenos, added about a cup of cheddar cheese and just a little parmesan instead of the 1C parmesan.  I put panko breadcrumbs on the top mixed with melted butter and baked.  This disappeared from the buffet in minutes.  :)

Simple and delicious!  I do the baked version, and double the jalapenos. (I use the kind in a jar.)  I suggest using 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  The first time I made it, the flavor of the mayo was way too much, almost overwhelming the dish.  I also mix Panko in with the parmesan, 3:1 ratio.

This is the most popular dip at any party. I always double the recipe, but I substitute sour cream for mayo and always sprinkle Panko bread crumbs on top and bake in the oven. I personally like plain pita chips with this dip, but tortilla chips are a close second.

This was a huge hit at our party. I used an entire can of jalapenos, didn't have mayo so I used sour cream like another reviewer suggested, and I didn't read the directions and ended up mixing the cheese in the spread. I sprinkled more on top as well. Served with tortilla chips and bagel chips, not a bit left.

I made this for my fiance's birthday party.  He loves cheese and he absolutely adores anything spicy so I thought it would be the perfect dish to serve as an appetizer.  It definitely was!  Everyone ate it up and loved it!  Next time I will have to make a double batch because it went quick and everyone wanted more.  I did change a few things, I added some shredded cheddar cheese into the mixture and sprinkles fresh parmesan cheese and panko breadcrumbs on top.  I used the baked variation because I really wanted a crunchy top-just like a baked jalapeno popper!  It turned out great- the spice factor is just right, I think if you added any more it would take away from the taste of the dish.  Very easy to put together, and cheap to make-I think the most expensive part was the parmesan cheese! I served with regular & jalapeno flavored tortilla chips.  Definitely a hit!

Very delicious. My group of friends eats mostly organic and definitely all natural foods so I made the mayo myself from the article on allrecipes. I also spiced it up by using about 1/2 c. jalapenos. I thought the dip tasted awful before I baked it and was sure that the mayonnaise ruined it. But after it baked it was GREAT! Everyone was totally impressed and my boyfriend said he heard someone saying what a great cook I was :)

Oh my gosh. So yummy! Made it as directed with the addition of panko on top and baked rather than microwaved it - addiciting! Will definitely make again.

I can't believe how much this taste like poppers, but even better! I hate mayo, so I wasn't sure that I would like this recipe, but you can't taste the mayo at all.

Wonderful!  This is always a hit and I usually use this as my "dish" for potlucks and parties.  The only thing I do differently is use fresh jalepenos for the crunch and flavor.

I made this dip exactly as written for a party and it was a huge hit.  Really, really good.  I would like to try mixing panko and cheese and baking next time.  But the original recipe is great as is!

SoOooOOoo Good! I served the spread with "Wheat Thin" crackers, it tasted JUST like a jalapeno popper! I was very pleased. Very easy to reheat also, just pop back into the microwave! This is definately a keeper! Thanks!

Wow is right! I followed the directions & the ingredients exactly & this came out perfect! My husband & I could not stop eating it, it was so good. You are really doing the recipe a disservice if you start changing the ingredients or adding things to it. It is awesome the way it is & needs nothing added.

Made this for our guests at the beach house over the Memorial day holiday.  Totally loved it and had to make two more batches throughout the weekend!  I added way more chopped jalepenos than called for to make mine spicy and also mixed the panko and cheese into the mixture before putting into the baking dish.  I then put more cheese and lots of panko on top and baked at 350 until toasted and bubbly.  A new favorite dip for sure!!  Everyone could not seem to get enough!

i tried very hard to follow this recipe completely, but was unable to. Sadly my local grocery store doesn't have canned chili peppers. Grrr. I used a little more of the jalapenos (jarred not canned.. same reason) and cut up a fresh pepper of an unknown name. i know it to be extra spicy so i took out most of the seeds.   because of the changes i couldn't help (and the fact that i took out most of the seeds of the one item that was hot), the dip was way to mild. i ended up adding a shake of a chili sauce. little shake, not much.   despite all the changes i couldn't prevent.. the dip was very well liked. it had the yumminess of the jalapeno peppers without being overpowering for those who don't like spice.   sadly, I didn't get to take any home. next time i will make some to keep at home too!

A huge hit with our family-I took the advice of others and mixed in half the cheese and tossed the other with some bread crumbs. Baked in a 350 degree oven to toast the breadcrumbs. Sooooo good!

AWESOME!! I hosted a margarita party and served this dip along with other "spanish" themed appetizers and this was everyones favorite!! I could have added more jalapenos as everyone said it wasnt hot enough!! I did add the panko bread crumb topping and baked it and it was the best ever!! I've been invited to be the chef at friends' parties as long as I make this!! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I brought this to a function and people went CRAZY over it. It's delicious. The bread crumbs are a nice added touch. I could eat this everyday if I could. I used more jalapenos then it said and it was not too spicy. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!

This dip is seriously addicting. I've made it as the recipe is written and it is really good, but using suggestions of other reviewers it is even better.  I mix the parmesan cheese into with the rest of the ingredients and add a layer of panko crumbs to the top. Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 and it comes out PERFECT. Make sure you get grated parmesan if you can - it's SO much better. Depending on who is eating it I adjust the amount of jalapeno as well. OMNOMNOM

I stuck to the recipe but just added 1/2 panko and 1/2 parmesan cheese mixture to the top and baked it in the oven.  (I like it spicy so I also added some fresh jalapenos.)  One alternate serving suggestion that people seemed to like:  
I baked cornbread (thin layer) and spread jalapeno jelly on the cornbread, topped with the dip (and panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top) and then broiled it.

This is a wonderful and easy dip to make!  I will definitely make again!  The only thing I changed was that I added 4 oz of diced jalapenos instead of 2 because we are a jalapeno loving family!!!  :)

This has to be one of my favorite recipes from this site.  I have made it MANY times to RAVE reviews.  When I am thinking of appetizers, this is the one that always pops in my mind to make.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed!!!

The first time I made this I accidentally doubled the jalapenos. I also used plain bread crumbs with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I baked it for about 20-25 minutes in the oven at 400. I thought it was yummy like that! I just made it again and used Panko crumbs with fresh grated Parmesan cheese, still doubling the jalapenos and baking in the oven at 400 degrees. YUMMY! It was even BETTER!!! It is a spicy, so if you don't like spicy leave the jalapenos at 2 oz. (I happen to like clearing out my sinuses every now and then!) The Panko crumbs really do make all the difference making the topping all crusty. I highly recommend those over regular bread crumbs.

This recipe tasted good but even after using low fat ingredients the dip still had a large amount of grease that puddled on top of the dip and in the bowl. For me, the taste isn't worth the greasy guilt. I'd rather just eat jalapeno slices on tortilla chips without all of the grease. Deleting from recipe box.

This is a regular staple appetizer in my home since finding it on here. Talk about affodrable and easy (let alone delicious). The only change I made was I use low fat cream cheese and low fat mayo (Hellman's of course). There is no change of flavor from full fat version. I serve with fresh veggies and tortilla chips. My friends love, love, LOVE this recipe. Thank you!

So easy and delicious! I served with tortilla chips and used extra jalapenos as other suggested for a little more spice.

I did as others suggested and used 4 oz jalapenos and fresh parmesan cheese and microwaved it and WOW! This stuff was delicious. I toasted french bread in the oven and spread it on top and then tried some on Ritz crackers. I was just blown away at how good this stuff is! Thanks for a great recipe=)

This was a big hit. I followed directions exactly and baked in the oven for a nice crusty parmesan layer on top. Served with tortilla chips.

This recipe is super easy to make, and tastes EXCELLENT!  I have taken it to 2 family functions and gotten rave reviews both times.  I use approx 7oz of diced jalepenos and it is still not too spicy.  Definitely bake this....when I top with the grated Parm, I add some plain breadcrumbs on top as suggested in reviews.  Also, sliced french bread broiled for a couple min. is the perfect compliment to the spread.

I have made this twice for different parties and it was a favorite both times!  Tastes just like the "poppers", but I added ALOT more jalapenos (probably double) to give it more bite.  If you eat poppers, you will probably want more heat in your spread.

RAVE REWIEWS ON BAKED VERSION!! After returning from a long weekend of camping, I needed something fast and simple to make for a house warming party.  This was fast, simple, and most of all absolutely delicious!  I made it again the very next Sunday for a family birthday party.  It was the talk of the party.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  First of all, I couldn't find chopped green chilies, so I used 1/4th cup diced hot yellow peppers and 1/4th cup diced jalapeno peppers (these peppers are HOT, so the cut back IS necessary, but will still make a spicy dip). Also, I used 1/2 of an 8oz parmesan cheese package and also added shredded cheddar.  I placed the mixture into a aluminum throwaway baking dish, and then lightly coated the top of the mixture with breadcrumbs that were tossed with the remaining parmesan.  Lastly, I placed sliced jalapenos on top to decorate.  MUST BAKE!! Bake at about 400 for 20-30 minutes.  I baked it about half way at home, and finished baking at the party.  The breadcrumbs and parmesan will turn to a nice golden brown. Well worth the wait.

Just made this for a bridal shower. EVERYONE wanted the recipe - they were eating it on toasted baguette slices... tortilla chips... with a spoon... you name it. It is AWESOME. Made the recipes as is, except I had half a fresh jalapeno, so I chopped added it (no seeds) with the canned...and I mixed 1/2 cup of parmesan into the cream cheese mixture and topped the whole thing with the other 1/2 cup, so the cheese on top wouldn't be so thick (I used a smaller rectangle dish to bake). AND, I baked it in the oven for about 20 minutes until bubbly. OMG. It was just delicious. (I used low fat mayo... you'd never know).

This recipe is KILLER!  I've made it a few times now for different events and it's a hit every time.  I serve it with sliced fresh French bread and I like some of the other reviewers bake the dish instead of microwaving it.  Served right out of the oven this appetizer is FABULOUS!

My brother and I ate almost 1/2 of this the first day!  The jalapenos I used were not pickled in any way, so it was not as hot as my family could take, but the flavor was great.  The next time we had it my parents loved it as well!  Totally the right dip for my spicy loving family! I used toasted french bread as the dipper.

DESISH!!  This dip was so amazing we could not stop eating or raving over it!!  I made it for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a hit!!  The only change I made was I used fresh green chili from our garden - hello? - why wouldn't you??? If you do not have fresh I recommend getting the frozen it has a lot more kick than the canned!!!  YUMMO!!

I made this last night for St. Patty's day.  I hate jalapenos so I made it mainly for my hubby and some of his guy friends.  I microwaved it w/o the cheese for 3 minutes and then I mixed the cheese and some bread crumbs and sprinkled it over the top.  Then I broiled it so the top was golded. DESLISH!  I liked it and don't even like jalapenos.  I used a full 4 oz can of jalapenos.  Everyone who had some loved it.  Great recipe!

It's OK, but it didn't wow the guests and was too creamy... there are better party dips that are just as easy to make.

Excellent!!  I am sure the original recipe tastes great, but I doubled the jalapenos and added the Panko breadcrumbs as suggested.  All of my game night guests raved about this dip.

I made this dip for a potluck party with friends and it was gone in less than 30 minutes.  I served it with bagel chips.  The guests were hovering over the crockpot like there was gold in it.  One of the guests said it resembled a dip from Kozumels Mexican Restaurant.  This is now one of my favorite dips.  Thanks for sharing.

Just made this the other night and it was great!  Everyone really enjoyed it and I will be making again.  I halved the recipe due to the size of our group and it was the perfect amount.  I usually don't change things in the recipes the first time, but I did double the jalapenos as I knew the group liked hot, and I am glad I did.  I used fresh parm and used the microwave cooking method because of time.

I love this dip! It is sooo good!! I used a 1/2 c of sour cream and 1/2 cup of mayo. I topped it with panko crumbs and baked in a pie dish for 20 minutes. I added additional peppers because I love spicy food. My family and boyfriends family loved this!

This was good, but i did not really see what the big deal was.  I think people at our party liked it better than I did, as I did have someone ask for the recipe, so maybe a matter of taste.  I used panko on top as another review suggested and that added a lot - I can't imagine that it would look very nice or taste as good without that.

Good all around party dip. Good with tortilla chips. If you like spicy food, add more peppers. This one's kinda mild.

This was fine. But it wasn't fantastic. I followed the recipe, but I did add a second can of jalapeno peppers since some reviewers mentioned this dish needed more spice. If I make it again I will cut the mayo by half.

Tasty and creamy when warm but gets a bit "gloppy" when it starts to cool down (Still tasted good though).  Did do as others suggested and added Japanese bread crumbs to the top to add a nice crunch when you scoop.  Added chopped "hots" from the jar rather than cutting up jalapenos.  Ate this dip with tortilla chips.

BEST HOT DIP EVER!! Everyone loves this one.  It's great cause you can adjust the amount of heat with the amount of jalapenos you use.  Even better baked in the oven, use 1/2 the parmesan cheese in the dip and sprinkle the other half on top and bake about 30 mins at 350F, or until golden brown!!!TO DIE FOR!!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  Made it for my fiance since he LOVES jalapenos and all things hot...but the rest of us enjoy it too.  I am not too much of a fan of spicy food at all.... I bought the regular Great Value brand of sliced jalapenos in the 12 oz jar, and used about 1/3 of the jar, and it has a bite to it, but not so much that I can't enjoy it too.  The idea about using the Panko bread crumbs mixed with the parmesean and baking in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes is a fantastic idea....gives it the exact popper taste.  Thanks so much for sharing... I will be making this again and again I'm sure.

Like everyone else, this is a great dip!  I double it and make it in a 13x9 pan for large parties and it's always gone.  It's particularly good served w/pita chips or the corn "scoopers" style chips.

This dip is delicious!  Just like eating jalapeno poppers.  I added habaneros and more jalapenos to make it even spicer.

This is a fantastic dip that my entire family loved.  It is so versitile.  You can either follow the recipe, heat it in the microwave, and it is delicious; or you can play with the recipe and make even more delicious.  I love this dip!

Easy to make and everyone loved it!!!  I did use more jalapenos than was called for (about double) and it was spicy but really good.  I also followed someone elses suggestion about using panko on the top mixed with the parmesan cheese and it was awesome.

This was a huge hit at our super bowl party. Just the right level of spice with a creamy texture that works well for those who don't like the texture of jalapeno poppers. Much easier to eat too. We had the dip with New York Style, lightly salted pita chips which were fantastic.

This was a huge hit at the super bowl party.  I used about a half a can of diced hot jalapenos and it was plenty to give it some kick.  I put the mixture in a pyrex pan and baked it...I think that crisp it gets on top is worth the baking rather than microwaving.  Served with pretzels and triscuits, everyone loved it.  Definitely adding to my arsenal of fun apps to bring.

This is a tastey dip.  I used 5 fresh choped jalapenos instead of the can type.  I also put some celantro in it.  I will use this for my party dishes now.

I absolutely love jalapeno poppers and I just had to try this.  This was a huge hit at a party I recently had.  I did add the panko crumbs and cheddar cheese.  I served it with toasted french bread, but I think next time I will try bagel chips.  VERY good!!!!

The recipe is good but just the parasean cheese made me knock this down to 3 stars. It was way too much on the top and just threw off the whole flavor. And it all clumped together for leftovers and the texture made me feel sick at my stomach. I might make this again, but I'll definitely leave out the Parm cheese. It's that bad...

This dip is AMAZING! I served it at my superbowl party but nobody seemed to like jalapenos so I ended up tossing a bunch away. The people who did eat it asked for the recipe and one went home and made it the next days just to snack on. I will definately be making this again.

This is a very popular recipe. I added some sharp cheddar cheese over the top and put chips stuck in all around the edge when it went in the oven. Also substituted sour cream for the mayo and roasted fresh chilies.  I used a combination of jalepenoes, chile aneheim, and chile gueritos..those yellow ones about the size of jalepenos. This was the hit of the superbowl party..the fresh roasted chilies really make the difference

This was the best... I don't think I'll ever buy Jalapeno Poppers again! Everyone agreed it was the bomb! Definitely serve it with the toasted French bread and you'll need a few loaves, not just one! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Fan-tab-u-lous!

everyone who tried this loved it! even people who wouldn't normally like anything jalapeno.  The only thing I would change for next time is the amount of diced jalapenos. I use 4 oz instead of 2oz and it still could have been a little bit more spicey. not much of a bite to it. still very yummy and high praises.

So delicious....everyone ate it all up at my Super Bowl party. I made it a day ahead, stirred the parmesan cheese into the mixture, and baked it off right before everyone arrived. Must admit that we couldn't wait and microwaved some for hors d'oeuvres. Either way it was yummy...will make it again soon.

Have made this recipe three times now, first two times I followed the recipe to the letter, made it for my Superbowl party yesterday following another reviewers suggestion of subbing half the mayo for sour cream and making the topping half panko half parm. It was fantastic! It was devoured before it got a chance to cool off, this is now a party staple.

Great recipe...as others suggested I added the panko on top with the parm and baked in the oven.  Had a 4 oz. can of jalapenos, added 2 oz. to the dip and garnished the top with the rest.  Served with pretzel crisps and tortilla chips.  Took to a Superbowl party and it was a hit!  Will definitely make again!

Mmm...yummy! Secretly, this was the highlight of Superbowl 44 for me. It was so scrumptious :] Everyone loved it. I did double the jalapenos to make it spicy and just served it with Fritos. It really did taste like a jalapeno popper! Thank you for a delicious dish Denise. I can't wait to share it with other people.

This was great!  I served this at my Superbowl party for the first time and everyone loved it!  I had a can of sliced Jalapeno peppers in my pantry and I chopped them up and added about a teaspoon of the juice to the mixture.  It wasn't as hot as I thought it might be!  I also added more Parmesan cheese and mozzarella!

I loved it, but it needed more flavor.  I added probably 2 teaspoons of garlic, and people thought it could've used more.  But it was definitely a decent dip.

Yummy!  Halved the recipe because I was only making it for my husband and me.  Used fresh jalapenos, and did a half parmesan cheese, half bread crumbs mixture.  It  was so delicious! The first time I only had Triscuits ( the new flavored ones and it wasn't a good marriage).   The second time we had it with Trader Joe's Veggie and Flaxseed tortilla chips and that was a lot better.   Looking forward to sharing it at the next family function.           at the next family gathering.

Yum….this was so good.  I mixed panko bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese and baked in the oven as suggested by other reviewers.   I think it makes a nicer presentation.  I served it with crostini made by slicing a baguette into ¼ inch slices, brushing with combination of olive oil and melted butter (2T each) with crushed garlic (4 cloves), and cooking in 350 oven for 8-10 minutes.

Great!  Made half a batch with low fat cream cheese and olive oil mayo... Big hit!  Creamy and not very spicy - might amp it up a bit next time! Served with tortilla chips.  Enjoy!

Like other people I was skeptical about putting mayo and cream cheese together.  I normally hate anything with Mayo in, but with this really good.  I used an immersion blender to make it creamier and thicker. It only took me about 15 minutes to make.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.

I accidentally mixed the parmesan cheese in with the other ingredients, so I baked the whole thing and it was still amazing!  It makes a lot, so invite a crowd or be prepared to go to the gym because you'll want to eat it all!

I really liked this recipe. I tried both the orgiginal version and the sour cream subtitution both were good.   I deep fried some Wonton wrappers and crumbled them onto for crunch and visual appearance..and served with with tortilla chips and deep fried wonton strips.

Awesome!  after reading the reviews and then the reply by the original author, I decided to keep the original recipe exactly as-is except for one thing - i put 1/2 cup fresh grated parmigiano in the mix and the other 1/2 cup added to 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and then spread on the top.  i warmed the dip up in the microwave and then put it in my toaster oven to lightly toast the topping.  I'm glad i didn't heat it the whole time in the oven or the topping would have become too toasted or even burned.  Also, i would recommend using a shallow dish to heat/serve if you use this amount of breadcrumb mix so the proportion of dip to topping is better.    I was skeptical about using the parmigiano, like one of the reviewers said - cheddar or jack seem more appropriate but the flavor mix was really great.  I also took the author's recommendation to double the jalapenos if you want a little more heat.  It ended up comfortably warm, no one thought it was too much.  (by the way, i used 'pickled' jalapeno slices that i chopped up - nice tangy heat)

Excellent!  I am making this for a Superbowl party today.  I figured I better try it before I took it, so I heated a little in the microwave.  HOT, but sooo good! I am going to put it in a crockpot so I mixed the parm right in the spread.  I sampled it on a butter flavored cracker.  Very good.  I will be serving it with crackers and french bread.  I can't wait to see how it goes over!  I LOVE this!

Very good.  However, I liked it better with less Parmesan cheese and double the jalapeno.  With the specified amount of jalapeno it just doesn't have enough jalapeno flavor.

I have made this so many times since fining the recipe.  I make it just as the recipe states except I add shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture.  I took the advise of others and made a crust for the top to give it some additional texture.  Cheese straws work great but I can never find them in the store.  My husband has decided he likes crushed Doritos's and Parmesan cheese are his favorite combination.  It is always the 1st dip to go and I get requests for the recipe!  Love it!!!

Yummy!  My husband and I loved this.  We added 4 oz of jalapenos because we didn't want to waste half a can and it was spicy!  We'll be making it for the Superbowl for sure!

Made this according to directions and do not like the overpowering mayo flavor in it.....I believe it would be better substituting sour cream and using the seasoned bread crumbs on top with the cheese.  I used real cheese and baked it in the oven. Mayo was miracle whip as regular mayo is too strong in dips for my liking. Even my kids who are NOT picky eaters didn't like it. For extra kick, I did layer some sliced jalapenos on top and that turned out well. It's the flavor of the base we don't like.

Very good.  I used non-fat cream cheese and sour cream instead of all mayo.  I did use a tablespoon of low fat mayo.  I used non fat cheddar cheese and everything was great.

Still a great dip (everyone asks for it), but made exact as recipe this time, did not brown up like I thought it should and the oils separated even though I incorporated with hand blender.  In past made changes, added parmesan and mozarella to body and breadcrumbs to top.

This is amazing...i made it for work, and it was a big hit. I added more jalapenos, garlic powder, and a bit of red pepper flakes to bump up the heat. I used 1/2 cup of parmesan & 1/2 dry bread crumbs, then baked in the oven until brown...YUMMY! Thanks Denise for a great recipe!

This spread went over well at a playoff game party, I did add some cheese to the spread, and on top and added pannko bread crumbs on top to give it the taste of breading on a jalapeno popper, and I did bake it.  Awesome.....will make again, and again.

This is absolutely amazing! I don't even eat spicy food and I ate like about half of it by myself! I did follow someone's suggestion and doubled the chilies and jalapenos. (I used canned) I promise it just gives more of a kick, doesn't really add on to the spicy level. I baked the bread first before I added the dip.

I made this by adding equal parts mayonnaise, parmesan and 2 times the cream cheese. This way I could control the amount, I then added jalapenos by eye. Microwaved for 3 minutes. There was a layer of oil on the top which I tried to mix in, it didn't. So for a party, doesn't give a very good presentation. Tasted good, I ate with rippled chips but I can imagine it being much better with corn chips. Nevertheless, it wasn't wow.

This is a FAVORITE in our house and very easy to make.  I bake is for about 20 mins at 375 instead of microwaving. We usually double the jalapenos also!  The spicier the better in our house!  Thanks Denise!

I am just amazed at how easy and fantastic this dip is!!  I made it for a football game and it was a HUGE hit.  It took all of about 5 minutes to make, which is perfect if you need a quick appetizer. Thanks!!

I made this one time during the holidays to try it...Well turns out I ended up having to take it to EVERY party we went to!! It is just amazing and never got sick of it!! I plan to add bacon one time to see how that is like a bacon wrapped jalapeno popper!  I have also used lower fat cream cheese and did 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup plain yogurt!, to make is healthier. No one noticed a difference and there were no leftovers!

First time I made this was back in August and it was the hit of the party.  Made it many times over and each time I was asked for the recipe by just about everyone who tried it.  Baking with the panko bread crumbs is the way to go.  I experimented a couple times by adding just a few drops of chili oil, gave it a little extra kick. Great recipe!!!

I made this for a holiday gathering and it received rave reviews! Then I ended up giving the recipe out to friends and relatives who took it to parties and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is great, thanks so much for sharing. I will certainly be making it many more times.

I brought this to a potluck, and not many people touched it.  I think they didn't know what it was.  It doesn't look that appealing, but it TASTES amazing!!!  I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes instead of microwaving.  I brought the leftovers home and my husband and his buddies thought it was SOOO good!

I loved it, though I made it too hot.  I used 6oz. hot food club brand jarred jalapenos, and while it tasted fine cold, after I baked it, it sure got spicy hot.  I'll only use about 3 or 4 oz. next time.  Added bread crumbs to the top too.

This tasted like cream cheese with some peppers in it. It was way too rich and thick for my taste. We even roasted our own peppers instead of using the jarred kind and it just wasn't very good. I'd also seriously consider halving the recipe because it makes A LOT of dip (which no one really ate).

Great appetizer.  I don't use the canned chilies or jalapenos.  I've found that using 6-10 fresh jalapenos works great for taste and heat.  If you like it hot just cut up the jalapeno. Or if you don't want things too kicked up, clean out the seeds and white membrane to get the level of heat you'd like.  To get more jalapeno taste, I cut cut each jalapeno ring in half so there's more coverage in the dip.  I also bake in the oven for 30 min at 375 and then stir the parmesan throughout the dip after I take it out of the oven.

We made this over New Year's. I was skeptical about it tasting just like a popper.....I was so wrong. This dip is awesome the day you make it, the next day reheated and even off your finger as you scrape the last little bits from your baking dish.

My family devoured this dip.  I added bread crumbs and a bit of cheddar cheese, as well as the Parmesan cheese on top and baked in the oven until it was heated through.   It was wonderful and passed the inspection of all my avid jalapeno popper fans!

This dip is amazing!  As some other reviewers suggested, I used 4 ounces each of the diced chilies and jalapenos, and added about 1/2 cup each parmesan and panko, mixed together, at the end and baked it.  I served it with toasted french bread slices.  At my work holiday party, I had 6 different people ask for the recipe.

I made this for two different Christmas parties and it was the hit of both.  I ended up posting it on my FaceBook, it was so much in demand.

This was a awesome recipe.  Tried it for Christmas and it was on of the first apps gone!!! I did bake it, and I also added bacon on top.  It reminded our family of the poppers we put on the grill during the summer.

Absolutely AWESOME!!! The only things that I do different are that I double the jalapenos and put them in the food processor so they are minced. I also add more cheddar while mixing it up & on top mixed into the bread crumbs before baking. Everyone has loved this!!!

This is very yummy and DOES taste a lot like poppers. We made a half batch and it still made quite a bit. It is very rich so unless you have a lot of people to help you eat it you might want to make a half batch. I made it in the oven...about 15-20 minutes at 350 and the parmesean cheese on top was nice and melty. I tried one side with just the cheese and the other side with cheese and bread crumbs (like others had recommended). I didn't really like the bread crumb side as well, so next time I would leave them off. It tasted great on chips, would also be yummy on Triscuits or bread, I think.

What a great tasting dip! I followed the suggestions of others who have rated this recipe in the past and added panko to the parmesan for a delicious result. I would have given it 5 stars--but my family and I like it spicy. I will definitely make this again, but I will be adding MORE jalapenos!

An excellent dip.  Very addicting.  Control the spicyness of the dip by how much jalapeno pepper is used.  Definitely use fresh grated parmesan.

Great recipe and super easy.  The only difference I did to this was that I used fresh Jalapeno's and diced them myself.  The canned ones didn't have enough kick/taste to them.  Everyone loved this dip!

I made this in advance for our New Year's Eve party and ended up making another batch just to share at work.  Loved it and didn't even put the parmesan cheese or heat it up, it was fantastic cold!  My son tried it and said it was ok but then kept coming back for more and more and smiled and said "addicting".  Thanks so much for an easy great recipe!

Just made this for our appetizer lunch on 12/31/09.  We liked it very much with using 1/3 lower fat of the cream cheese and fat free mayo.  I used some panko crumbs mixed with the parm and it was really good baked in the oven.  Served with tortilla chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

OH MY GOSH! This has to be the most amazing dip I've ever had. I made it for a party for a friend. I did put a lot more jalepenos in it than it calls for, probably double or triple. I just kept chopping them until I thought I had enough. I put the parmesan and breadcrumbs on top, and then baked a small amount to taste it. Baking it brings out the jalepeno flavor. That was good.... BUT, since I was making a lot of snacks for this party, I decided to make this ahead. I mixed it up and put it in the fridge and baked it the next day. Being in the fridge overnight REALLY brought out the jalepeno flavor. In the future, I will ALWAYS make it this way since it was SO much better the next day. There were only about half a dozen people at the party, but this dip was gone in about an hour. Its just about the best thing ever.

Absolutely flaweless...I am now known to make this recipe at any function. I think people come up with functions just so I can make it lol. I usually add a little more jalapeno's then asked as we like it spicy and not so much mayo. I usually serve it cold but warm is also good...thxs so much for this recipe :)

This is awesome!!!! I did substitute miracle whip for mayo when I made it but had already tasted it with the mayo. My friends thought it was out of this world. However, I prefer it with mayo. Since miracle whip is sweeter, I think it took away from the flavor of the popper taste.

This is so easy, simple, and yummy!  I made this last night with some friends coming over and everyone raved about it.  It is perfect as it is, but could see adding full 4oz can of the jalapenos for more of a kick.  Definitely keep this recipe around!

She's right, don't try to change the recipe - it's perfect as is!  We microwaved instead of baking because I ran out of time.  The flavor was delicious but I will be baking it to get the golden brown topping this weekend when I make it again.  Yum!!!

I made this recipe for the first time on Christmas Day for a VERY large family gathering.  EVERYBODY raved about how delicious this was!  I followed smileymom's advice and used Panko flakes and baked in lieu of microwaving.  This definately tastes better with toasted bread rather than crackers or chips.  Thank you Denise for sharing this easy and tasty recipe.  I'll definately be making this recipe again and again!

Sadly, it didn't go over well at all at my Christmas party. Was really excited to try it with the five-star rating and all, but, really, all it tastes like is  a pickled jalapeno.  It begs for more texture.

I really had great expectations for this recipe after reading the reviews, however it wasn't quite what I expected.  I followed the recipe exactly, and baked the dip, and I found the texture to be a bit lumpy and overall just not worthy of 5, or even 4 stars.  I would not make this again.

Definitely a great tasting dip. As is, it wasn't hot enough for me so the next time I made it (and there have been many)I used the entire can plus of jalapenos plus the juice and less parmesan cheese. I have made this for several parties and get togethers and it's gone in nothing flat. Sometimes on weekends while watching movies I will make this for my husband & I, it's that addicting!

This was pretty good, but I think I'll stick to my artichoke/green chili dip. It seems to have more substance than this one.

Scrumptious!  We added 1/2 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese in the mix, spread a few bread crumbs on top and then the Parm cheese.  Served w/warm chunks of French bread is delicious!

Added the entire 4oz can of jalapenos, divided the 1 cup of parmesan, mixed 1/2 cup and sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup on top.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes and served warm with tortilla chips.

I cant give 5 stars because I did not like this.  4 stars because several others did.  I did not follow the recipe exact, which could be the prob, I used miracle whip (probably my prob but I dont like mayo). I also mixed 1/2 parmesan cheese inside and rest on top with bread crumbs. Next time I will try real mayo but use 1/2 amt sour cream.

Super easy and got rave reviews from nearly everyone.  I was short on oven space, so I heated the dip on a warming tray and then at the last minute I topped with the parmesan and some panko breadcrumbs and broiled till golden brown.  Great recipe!

I have had made this a dozen times or so and every time it's a hit.  Instead of diced can jalapeno peppers, I use 3 fresh jalapenos without seeds and diced.  Also I add two cans of chopped green chilies instead of one.  The fresh jalapenos gives it a nice crunch.  It's a very quick recipe that you know you can turn to in case of a last minute party or pitch in.

I used  3 fresh jalapenos instead of canned.  I took it to a party with fritos and Triscuits. When I went back to get the dish, it had been scraped clean!  I highly recommend this if you have to take an appetizer or snack to a party.

I have made this three times over the holiday season...everyone loves it. I took it to work for a Christmas party and it was eaten up! I was even asked for the recipe by a couple of co-workers. Instead of microwaving, I did pop it in the oven at 350 degrees until the parmesan cheese melted. There is also a similar recipe on the site that recommends mixing the parm with the other ingredients and putting in a bread bowl. i think I will  try that method next as the parm makes the taste for me. Thanks for sharing...i loved the Kraft spreads and this was better!

Unbelievable!!  Put it in a bread bowl (forgot the grated cheese), the whole thing went.  I did not think it too spicy, just perfect, tastes EXACTLY like a jalapeno popper from the pizza shop.

Easy to follow recipe, and everyone loved it. All of it was gone. Had people ask me for the recipe. Personally it was not my favorite, tastes too much like cream cheese. However, I was the only one at the party with this opinion. I will not be making it again, but many of my friends will.

I made this dip for two different parties. Someone told me to just leave a pile of recipe cards next to this dip! At the 2nd party, it was gone before all the guests arrived. It really is delicious...I could eat it with a spoon!

Absolutely fantastic!  I doubled the jalapeno to 4 oz and mixed in the parmesan cheese.  If you bake the spread, mix in most of the cheese and then sprinkle cheese on top for a cheesy crust.

I have made this dip many times and EVERY time someone asks for the recipe.  It is a hit and taste just like those yummy poppers.    I usually double the jalapeno and also mix panko and bread crumbs w/ some butter to top it off.  I always bake so the top gets golden brown.  French bread seems to go best.  YUM.

Very rich treat that got devoured while the troops waited for Thanksgiving dinner.  I served it with slices of toasted french loaf and veggies.  I did use fresh over jarred peppers, and I think I may add a bit more next time.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Even my husband, who doesn't like jalapenos, loved this dip.  I combined suggestions from a few others, using cheddar & Panko crumbs on top and serving with tortilla chips.  Very good & EASY!

This recipe is so easy and delish! Did not have any parmesan cheese so I used white cheddar and added some panko bread crumbs on top and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min. Talk about yummy in the tummy!

This tastes just like a jalapeno popper. This is so easy and very addicting. Not too spicy really and we like things spicy so I added more jalapenos.

This is awesome! Made this as an appetizer for a family get together, but substituted 8oz of sour cream for the mayo (sister-in-law hates mayo), and used 5 fresh jalepeno peppers (leaving about 20-30 seeds for heat). Served with Tostito tortilla chips. YUM!

I really liked this and I didn't even follow the directions! I guess it's a very forgiving recipe. I used canned jalapeno pickled slices and although it really didn't taste like a popper, it was a very good dip. Thanks for the recipe!

We were getting tired of our family favorite chilli dip so for a recent party I decided to try something new. This is our new family favorite. Everyone loved it and the bowl was empty before anything else. I used a whole small can of the diced jalapeno peppers.  This dip has a nice bite at the beginning, but not overpowering. Be careful it's addicting!

Excellent. Tastes so much like a cream cheese jalapeno popper! I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, no chilis, put increased jalapenos to taste, also added a cup of shredded cheddar cheese. It was gone in no time. Will definitely make again!

This dip was a hit!  Made it just like the recipe said, except I combined the Parmesan cheese in with the mixture, then microwaved.  Tasted JUST like a jalepeno popper! Served it with tortilla chips and sourdough bread.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this to bring as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I served it with Ritz crackers, and it really does taste like Jalapeño Poppers!  I did make a few changes, based on other reviewer's suggestions:  I doubled the jalapeños for extra kick, I used fresh grated Parmesan mixed with 1/2 cup of Panko crumbs for the topping, and I baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

This was an absolute hit at our thanksgiving dinner.  One of the guests though it was "catering" quality and everyone kept going back for more.  I did add 1/2 cup of panko crumbs to the parmesan before baking.  This is definitely a keeper!!

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I prepared it the night before (minus the parm & bread crumb topping). I used 1 C. Miracle Whip=next time I will use only 1/2 of that or maybe 1/2 MWhip and 1/2 sour cream? The next morning I mixed abt 1 C. Parmesan cheese and 1/3 cup breadcrumb on top of the spread and baked at 350 for 25 minutes (like others suggested) everyone really did rave about it. It was good! I will be making this again soon!

Used baked option for my first attempt at this.  Was told "that is the best thing I have ever tasted" and "Yum, yum"... throughout the night.  Be warned, something about this just keeps bringing you back for more.  I felt like a stuffed jalapeño about to "pop" myself when the evening was done because I found myself back nibbling on the dip all night long.  Simply done, simply superb, simply delicious.    I followed directions but did use 4 oz jalapeño and added 4 that were seeded and sliced on top for decorations.  I cooked the dip in a glass pie pan, after 20 minutes placed sliced jalapeños on top, and cooked another 10.  Nice presentation.    Seeded and sliced jalapeños were not too hot, nor was the rest of the spread.  Most anything placed into this "spread" or "dip" was very good.    Many people like to "tweak" recipes and I am one, so I may try the bread crumbs variation next time, but why mess with something that is so good just as it is.   This will certainly be a keeper and will be presented to family and friends as long as I have a kitchen to cook in and an event to prepare for.   Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

I needed something quick for last minute plans to have guests for watching football.  Very easy and everyone loved it! I did what others recommended and mixed a couple of handfuls of Panko bread crumbs with the fresh Parmesan cheese on top and baked it in a glass pie pan. I also used 4 oz. of jalapenos instead of 2 oz. I served it with Club crackers. If you like jalapeno poppers you will certainly like this. I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe to a T. I took it to a party last week and by the time I got over to get some, it was GONE! Great recipe. Next time I'll make twice as much and put them on opposite ends of the "munchies" table.

This is really good and easy. I mixed the parmesan in with the mix and also added a couple of shakes of bread crumbs in the mix as well as a bit on top. I served with tortilla chips , pretzels and crackers. all good.

Best dip ever!  I did bake it as others suggested and added crushed croutons to the top for a little crunch.  The ladies at the luncheon all loved it and asked for the recipe.

Made this for an engagement party and it was a big hit!  I added panko bread crumbs and covered with foil at the beginning, then removed the foil and broiled it for 3-5 minutes at the end of baking. made a nice crust!  I will be making this again and again. Tastes just like a popper!

SOOOOOO GOOOD!! Everyone loves this spread. If using breadcrumbs as a topper, baking is a must. It gives the crunch you associate with a popper! Yummy TY for this one!

This dip is FANTASTIC! I use the baked variation and add about 1 cup of Parmesan cheese to the cream cheese mixture and then a coating of Parmesan cheese on top. So so so yummy!!!!

This dip was so awesome and easy to make...I was a little leary about putting cream cheese in the microwave, but it turned out great!!  The only thing I did different was the second time I made it, I didn't add so much parmesan cheese..maybe about two tablespoons...Still the easiest tasiest appetizer I have ever made...every time I take it somewhere I get rave reviews!!

Insanely good. Guests at my party couldn't get enough of this spread. It's amazing how much it really tastes like a jalapeno popper. I doubled the amount of canned jalapenos and added 1 fresh jalapeno. It gave it just the right amount of spice.

I made this as a cold dip and it was delicious.  I didn't have any jalapeno peppers on hand, so I used about 2 tbsp. of chili puree with garlic to give it the heat.  I also doubled the amount of green chiles I used.  I used light cream cheese and mayo. I served with tortilla chips and toasted pita crisps.  I'll try it hot next time!

It was pretty good...not quite sure what the HUGE deal was about. Did anyone else have trouble with the Parmesan melting on the top? I used  fresh shredded, but maybe it had been on the shelf to long...didn't melt like i hoped. People did eat it up though...just not my thing...maybe I would have liked it more with more jalapenos...

I followed others advice and used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo.  I also threw some cheddar cheese in.    I put the dip in a crock pot until it was heated through, then put the shredded parmesan cheese mix under the broiler for a few minutes.  The crock pot kept the dip warm until it was gone.  Everyone loved it - thanks for the recipe!  I'll use it often.

Liked this one a lot. Changed with other's suggestions: used 5 fresh jalapenos, finely diced; half mayo/half sour cream; added 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese; added 1/4 cup cilantro. Topped with 1/2 cup panko and parmesan mixed.  I'll reduce the panko to 1/4 cup next time - seemed too crumbly to my liking.  Coooked in oven instead of microwave. Served with broiled baguette slices.  My husband thought bacon would be good, but others mentioned it wasn't.  I'm thinking maybe crumbling cooked bacon over the top after it's done, instead of in the dish itself, would be an idea.

A huge hit, two weeks in a row!  I used 1 regular  and 1 lowfat cm. cheese as well as 1/2c regular and 1/2 c light mayo.  Add as many jalepenos as you want, I just kept tasting as I added them. Whip cream cheese first for smoother consistency with a beater or imersion blender.  Added in about 1/2 cup  parmesean cheese from the can into dip, then put the shredded on top.  Bake 350 for 1/2 hour, spread on toasted bread, triscuits, or wheat ritz.  Men couldn't step away from the food counter!!  Now a new regular in my "mix" of appetizers.

If I could give this 10 stars.....I would!  I am not a spice food fanatic but my husband is.  We both loved this!!!!!  Be careful though-----the next day's leftover dip (if there is any leftover)  is much hotter than when first made.  Everyone who I have served this to loved it.  I did use panko in the topping and the 4 ounce can of jalapenos.  Any other recipes, Denise???

This is a pretty good dip, but I did follow some of the suggestions in the other reviews. I mixed some parmesan cheese in the creamcheese mixture and then added panko bread crumbs to the cheese on the top. It was good, but I find it to be a very expensive dip when I think I would really rather have the actual jalapeno popper.

I've made it a few time and love how easy and spicy it is. I like it best with panko bread crumbs and Parmesan on top and broil or bake for a few minutes at the end to create the crispy topping.

This is wonderful!  So easy to make and such a crowd pleaser.  I perfer to bake in the oven as it dosen't seem to be as much oil released from the cheese.  I also add a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs with the cheese and stir it into the mixture when it bubbles and resprinkle with a little parm cheese so it looks nice.

SO GOOD! I didn't use the green chilies because I was worried about how spicy it would be. I loved the end result otherwise. Maybe next time I'll try it with the chilies! Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is not what I was hoping for. I used store brand mayo and followed the recipe EXACTLY and it tasted like mayo with jalapeno peppers in it. I wonder if I should have used better mayo or if it's supposed to taste like that! 5 stars only because I haven't tried it with name brand mayo.

I don't run into very many few star recipes on this site but this is one of them. This really lacked in flavor.  Served at a BBQ I had and there was a lot left over.  Not sure what I could do to make better?? Maybe add a little hot sauce. will continue to look for a better popper dip. sorry

Pretty good.  Definitely needs more jalapeño if you want it to be spicy.  Served it at a football party with baguette and everyone loved it.

This dip was awesome!! Tasted just like a jalapeno popper. I used 2 jalapenos cut up and made it the night before but would recommend more jalapenos it didnt seem too hot. Very delicious gonna make it again. Also, used panko crumbs and parmesean cheese on the top and baked it in the oven definate must. At the last few minutes put it on broil so it got a nice crunch on the top.

When I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to try it. I have a candleshow coming up in a couple of weeks and have been looking at different recipes but I like to try them out before making it for anyone. Wow! This is a good one. I didn't have the green chilies on hand and did not have the amount of cream cheese to make the large serving.  I used 1/2 cup jared jalepenos instead and used 1/4 cup sour cream and 2 Tbs. Mayo and 4 oz. cream cheese. I also mixed in 1/2 cup shredded cheddar then topped with the breadcrumb and italian cheese mix. This made enough for 2 I used a little soufle dish and baked for 1/2 hour. I crisped up some flatbread to make like crackers, was excellant. I will use this for my party and any event I have coming up. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe Denise.

I thought this was quite delicious, and makes a TON! I served as an appetizer at a dinner party at our house recently. Multiple guests asked for the recipe. It does taste like jalapeno poppers for sure. However, I put mine in a casserole dish, threw some panko crumbs on top and baked at 350 degrees for 45 min. Something about the idea of the microwave just turned me off....

This was delicious! I halved the recipe and it was plenty for 8 people.  Guests devoured the whole thing! Perfect with a french baguette, I omitted the green chillies and increased the jalapenos.  Also followed the suggestion to mix panko and parmesan and bake for 30 min. This is going to be a party staple!

Okay, I agree with a lot of people.  I used twice as many jalapenos and next time will use just a few more.  I would make ahead and let sit for a bit.  And I definitely made mine in the oven which is my personal preference.  I thought it was best served with bread.  Thought the combo with tortilla chips was a bit salty. Everyone was in love with it!

Made this for a family birthday last night.  FANTASTIC! Doulbled the jalapenos and halved the green chilies.  Mixed the parm cheese in with the other ingredients then put extra on the top with buttered bread crumbs and baked.  My mother the cook of all cooks asked the recipe and my husband asked for 4 more to go to the shack during deer season.  Will be making again. Thanks.

Very good spread. I made this for a party this past weekend and it was well received. I used the entire can of diced jalapenos. Gave it a nice kick. I also used the Panko crumbs with the cheese and baked in the oven for about 25 to 30 minutes. Was asked for the recipe several times. I am so glad I tried it. Thanks.

This was very good. I used more jalapenos. Everyone who ate it liked it.

EXCELLENT!! I had a big crowd so increased as I thought fit and the results were perfect.. used 3 blocks of cream cheese, a 4 oz can of chopped jalapenos, a 7 oz can of chopped grn chilies and stuck w/ 1 c of mayo. I put all of this in an 8x8 dish topped w/ parmsean and bread crumbs (I really wanted to use panko but I was out, I will next time) sprayed with olive oil and baked at 325 for 25 min. everyone went nuts over this and I even had men emailing me for the recipe the following day. I could have easily doubled what I did and it would have been gone! The kids loved it as well. I served with Triscuit Thin Crisp and Pita Chips...This was a winner!

What a hit! Took this to a tailgate and everyone loved it.  Pretzels are the best as the dipper - kind of neutralizes the flavor and adds some saltiness.  I served cold, without parmasean - the parm makes it too greasy.

Wow, this is so good!  I made the recipe as stated, used jarred jalapenos, and baked it. I did add some breadcrumbs on top and fresh parm cheese. Tasted just like a popper.  I served it with plain Melba toast.  Tasty!

I used this recipe for a pot luck and everyone ate it up!  I the only changes I made were to double the chilies, add a small amount of Mexican blended cheese (2 oz. or so), and top it off with bread crumbs before I baked it. Next time I think I will try some of the other reviewers suggestion and sub 1/2 the mayo for sour cream.  I will be making this again.

1st thing gone at the potluck. (:  Took others suggestions to use Parmesan/panko topping before baking.  Also used the whole 4oz can... added a nice kick.  Will make again.

I love this recipe!  I made this for a party and one guy literally stood and ate this till it was gone!  Many compliments on it.  I baked it in a bread bowl and it looked very nice.  Also, I did not have canned jalepenos and instead chopped 4 jalapenos but I would suggest adjusting that to your taste.

Very easy and great flavor.  I took this to a BBQ everyone rave about it.  I did use 3 fresh jalapenos chopped with seeds and real Parmesan cheese ( not that stuff in the green can) and mixed in bread crumbs

Soooo delicious! Tastes just like the middle of a jalapeno popper. I love spicy food but knowing that my guests probably don't all have the same spice level as me I didn't make it as spicy as I would personally have liked. I used fresh jalapenos and as suggested topped it with panko bread crumbs which gave it the perfect crunch for some texture, I also did not use as much mayo as called for.

I made this dip as an appetizer yesterday.  It was really, really good!! I used fresh jalapenos that I cut up and sautéed in a pan until the skins turned almost black.  I used 6 jalapenos, but think it could have used more; however, I like things a bit spicy!  I will definitely make this at my Holiday Open House this year.  Thank you for the recipe!!

MAJOR yum!  I followed the advice of a review and added 1/2 cup Panko to the top and baked for 30 mns at 375.  It was FABULOUS!  I served with butter crackers.

Yum-o... great with nacho chips.  I used a whole can green chilies and whole can of Jalapeno and I would not say that it is too hot at all... ( and I don't really like things spicy).  Real parmesean cheese mixed in and it's fantastic!

I served at Half Time and it was GONE by the time the Bears were back on! Sooooo good! The store was completely out of canned jalapenos, so I carefully chopped up 1/2 c. jalapeno rings from a jar. Also mixed the fresh parmesan with 1/2 c. breadcrumbs before topping the dip. Served with Ritz, but I swear I could've eaten with a fork! Very rich, though = tummy ache the next day lol

This dip is AWESOME!!! The best ever. Depending on my guests and their heat tolerance, I will use more jalapenos versus green chilis or more green chilis versus jalapenos. I warm up the main ingredients in the microwave, cover it with the parm and stick it in the toaster oven to get nice and toasty. The most difficult part of this recipe is fighting off the family while I am getting it to the table!

Amazing!  I have made this a dozen times already.  People keep requesting it and it keeps getting devoured.  I sprinkle plain breadcrumbs on top and bake at 350 for 20 minutes then serve with toasted french bread triangles.  You could even make this as a bruschetta topping.  This is now my signature dip that everyone knows me for making.

Excellent!  I took advice of others and used 1/2 mayo. 1/2 sourcream. I put around 1/4 cup of Parmesan in the mix.  I couldn't find diced jalapenos so ended up dicing one fresh one.  It added plenty of taste and heat.  I didn't want it too hot since children would be trying it.  It was excellent.  I topped with with the panko and parmesan and baked it.  Served with toasted (olive oil, salt and pepper)bagette slices.  Fantastic!  I have received requests for recipes, so you know it is good!  Thanks Denise!

This was a good, easy dip - very similar to others I've had/made, but with a kick. I used a 4 oz. can, and the 1/2 c panko/1 c. mozzarella mixture. It was spicy but not too spicy. I did have quite a bit leftover though, and no one in the house wanted to finish it since it's so fattening!

Very tasty. My husband told me it tasted better than the jalapeno poppers he got at the restaurant. Didn't change a thing, other that cutting it back to 16 servings.

Excellent, except that I will use a different topping next time. I did not care for the parmesean topping, probably will use the bread crumbs a user suggested.

I made this for a race party and nobody would eat it. No one ate hot peppers. I took the dish to work and heated it up and everyone liked it.  I had a co-worker take the rest home. I did use fresh parmesan cheese and the smell almost chased us out of the break room at work but it was good and not too hot. I misread the directions at first and thought it asked for 2-4oz.cans of jalapenos and I had poured one can in. When I re-read the instructions it said a 2oz.can so I picked half of them out.  I think 1 can of 4 oz. jalapenos would be fine.  Anyway, to make a long story short, thanks for the recipe. It is very good and easy.

This is a BIG hit every time I make it. I add breadcrumbs to the parmesan topping and bake in the oven. I leave out the chilies and double the jalapenos (add a little juice too!). Tastes great with Frito Scoops! Great recipe –thank you!!!

This was awesome. I followed another persons advice and used 1/2 c. Parmesan and 1/2 Panko and sprinkled it over the top then baked it for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I used french bread that I buttered and seasoned with a little garlic salt and toasted. It flew out of the bowl. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, even my picky brother liked it!  I also used half sour cream, half mayo, I added salt, pepper and garlic powder. And I used panko mixed with the cheese to create that crisp top. YUM

As written,the dip is good but very, very rich.  I toned down the Mayo and I liked it much better.  IF you're not a big mayo fan, you'll want to add 1/2 cup and then taste the mixture.  Add more if you like.  I love the combination of the cream cheese and jalapenoes! It's even better the next day.  I had some left over and I used it as a topping for hamburgers.  Really good.

I made this for my husband, and he loved it! He loves all things spicy, so I did double the peppers. It made me wish that I liked spicy foods! It had a really great flavor, though. Next time I might stick to the original version for myself, and he can add his extra peppers in later! Thanks!

Great recipe.  It was a hit at our picnic.  I used the suggestions of others and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo.  I also used three large fresh jalapenos in place of the canned.  That change added a nice fresh taste. Delicious!

I made only one change to this recipe;  I added probably more than double the chopped jalapeno.  I just kept adding until it tasted right.   I took this to my niece's birthday party, and everyone loved it...a new party staple!  I served it with pretzel chips.

SO simple and so easy to make.  Always devoured whenever I make it.  I serve it with tortilla chips, but crackers and bread would probably also work well. I add some cheddar cheese and I sprinkle bread crumbs on top.  I've even added shredded diced chicken for a heartier version.  Highly recommended!

This was excellent. The only change we made was to add 4oz of diced jalapeno peppers instead of 2oz, but we like it HOT!!!.  I will definitely make again.

I made this dip twice and it was a hit both times. The first time I made it with the two jars of jalapeno cans and it was pretty spicy hot, but it was addicting. The second time I used one jar of jalapenos and it had all the flavor of jalapeno without the heat. It depends on your audience, but everybody loved it.

Wow. I don't understand why such a simple recipe is so good, but wow.  Thanks so much for the suggestions/reviews....I used fresh jalepenos and added just a smidge of some extra jarred jalepenos I had on hand....I smushed the parm cheese in and then topped off with some buttered itialian bread crumbs...'heated in the microwave and it was ready to spread on some toasted bagette bread and wow, soooo good. Thank you so much.

I made this for two different parties just 4 days apart and it was a huge hit at both of them - it ALL got eaten.  The recipe is simple to make and easy to remember!

Like others, I used 4oz jalapenos, threw some shredded parm and cheddar in the mix and topped it with panko crumbs/parm and baked it.  It was really good, I got some good reviews on it, but it didn't WOW them.  I will definitely make it again and give it another try, but for now my heart is with The World's Best Bacon Cheese Dip (on here) as the big crowd pleaser!

I loved this recipe! So did all the guests at the BBQ. There was practically a fight over the last bite.  I did the baked version and used about a 1/2 cup of bread crumb so that the cheese didn't harden to the point where crackers broke when someone tried to dip.  The other thing I noticed was the dip was very versatile. I saw it eaten like a side dish, on burgers and hot dogs, even tossed in with salad. 5 stars!

Dip is awesome, every one loved it and asked me to make it for another party. The only thing I did was add less of the caned jalapeno peppers. It was just right. And the next day what was left ( not much) was hotter yet.

I took this to a 4th of July picnic.  OMG! everyone went crazy for it!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions- omitting the green chilies, adding 4 fresh jalapenos finely diced to the jarred, used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, substituted shredded Mexican blend cheese for the Parmesan.  I topped the dip with 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs that I mixed with melted butter.  I served the dip with thinly sliced baguette slices (that I drizzled with olive oil, dash of garlic salt, and toasted in the broiler) and Triscuit Thin Crisps.  The Triscuits were the preferred dipper!!  Everyone said that it tasted just like a jalapeno popper!  One friend said he'd eat this off a bumper!  So delicious!  Thank you Denise, for the great recipe!!

Great recipe.  I added 1 cup of mexican blend cheese and 2 4-oz. cans of jalapenos for some extra kick.  I also topped the dish with a sprinkle of parm cheese before baking it.  Everyone loved it.  It's truly addictive.

Delicious!  I love how this recipe makes a HUGE batch.  I split it up into two dishes; baked one, froze the other... But when everyone inhaled the first half I had to heat up the rest.  So good!  My tip:  don't put the cheese on top... mix it with the other ingredients so that it doesn't harden on top when it cools.

Yum, I mixed in some cheese blend and cut out the parm. Topped with panko crumbs. This was great! I cut the recipe in half and ended up eating half of it for lunch today. Thx for a great recipe ;)

A Keeper.  Excellent recipe as is. I did add extra peppers for our taste, we like things spicer but other than that left the recipe alone and everyone enjoyed it. Wonderful taste and so much easier than stuffing and handling the peppers.  I usually have all the items on hand so throwing together for the unexpected is going to make this a go to recipe in my box.

I know it's not fair to rate a recipe once you've modified it, but the reality is I love to cook and I can never follow a recipe as is. I read so many responses and took from them what I thought would turn out to be yummy. I did like so many, 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, that combo never fails. I also added about 4 oz. of sharp cheddar cheese into the mixture, an absolute MUST. I did the parmesan cheese/panko topping. It was really fine without it. I think my parmesan was too authentic, it didn't melt well quickly, so it sort of came up as a whole piece when on low broil. I pulled it off and the dip alone was fine. I'd probably skip out on the parmesan topping next time. And yes, use a toasted italian bread or pita crisps. A definate re-maker.

This was delicious but if you like things spicy, make sure to add the whole can of diced jalapenos.  I, like others, used cheddar instead of parmesan.  I put 1/2 c. in the dip and then topped the dip with 1/4 c. cheddar and a handful of bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs and cheddar really make the dip taste like a popper!  Great recipe!

Excellent & the best part is you can control the heat! I used chopped fresh jalapenos & green chilis and boy was it hot!!! Tasty but hot! I used the left overs in my bean burritos in place of sour cream and it was sooo good! I would make this again :>)

OMG!  This tastes exactly like a jalapeno popper in your mouth!  This is absolutely delish!  I used fresh jalapenos and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I also added some bread crumbs to the parmesan cheese topping as others suggested and loved it.  I baked in a 375 oven for 20 minutes and then broiled the top for a few minutes until brown.  I served with sliced baguette which was great and then tortilla scoops after the bread was gone.  Both ways were good!  A keeper for sure!

I have made this recipe over 20 times. Every party I go to, people request that I bring this dip. The only modification that I make is I use parmigiano reggiano cheese and instead of spinkling it on top of the mayo/cream cheese, I mix the entire amount in. This has given me the best feedback. In addition, I have found that the most popular things to serve the spread with are mini pita rounds (cut in half) and small tortilla chips (the little round ones). Thanks so much Denise!

This spread was fabulous!!! They only thing I did different was to add some panko on top before I microwaved it. I took it for a potluck at work and everyone raved about it! I actually had to print off several copies of the dip to hand out! Next time I will put it in the oven to compare the taste and textures. I served it with toasted french bread slices and a co-worker had brought some Wheat Thins and it tasted great with both. Thank you so much for the recipe. I can't tell you how many compliments I got on it!!!

I should give this 5 stars, EXCEPT I followed someone else's advice and used fresh jalapeno's.  I didn't think about it like I should have, and just diced it up and added it in.  The peppers were so crunchy!  It was gross!  My husband LOVED this appetizer!  I would have loved it had I followed the recipe and used a can of peppers instead or cooked the fresh ones first.  So, it was my mistake.  I still do not think it would be worthy of 5 stars, but it was yummy.

Made this last night for a hockey party- we didn't win, but the dip sure was a hit! I used a Mexican cheese blend and mixed it in with everything else, doubled the jalapenos then topped it with panko bread crumbs per some other suggestions, and it turned out great. This will be a standard party appetizer for me!

Delicious and so much easier that trying to get breadcrumbs to stick to the jalapenos.  I could eat this everyday.

UNBELIEVABLE!! Absolutely fattening, but worth it! The only thing I did differently was adding about 3/4 of a cup of shredded mozzerella cheese to the spread before baking. I served it with toasted slices of french bread. YUMMY!

The plate was practically licked clean!!  Everyone loved this recipe!  I doubled the jalapenos (used a whole 4 ounce can) and it seemed to have just the right amount of ZING! If you like jalapenos ... you're in for a treat!

Not what I was expecting...it was good but I was expecting maybe something more gourmet.  Although I took it two different places in a week and have never had such reviews!  Everyone LOVED it, couldn't get enough of it, asked for the recipe and it was the first thing gone on the table.  It's a winner!

I followed the suggestions (amendments) and used the Panko vrumbs. I ended up having to turn the oven to lo broil once it was simmering, to brown the bread crumbs. Next time I am just going to microwave it, because if someone can't enjoy the flavor without it looking pretty, that is on them. I quadrupled the recipe because I was going to a party with over 100 guests. I toasted the french bread slices, but many people just used the Tortilla chips as well. I think the Fritoe Scoops might make it too salty. By far, the easiest and tastiest app I have ever brought to a party.

This is so easy to make and yes, it tastes exactly like a jalapeno popper! I brought this to a housewarming and it was devoured first and then everyone was asking if I brought more to refill the bowl!

I liked it but didn't love it.My company however loved it! Followed another reviewers directions and used a 1/2 cup panko crumbs mixed with parmesean cheese, baked in the oven. I also used toasted baguette slices, which went over well.

I loved this. I also mixed the parmesan with panko bread crumbs and topped for the last 15 minutes of baking. I used fire roasted jalapenos. It had a wonderful kick.

i made this dip simply because of the amazing reviews. i was questioning how good it would actually be because the ingredients were some simple. boy was i surprised. this is one of the most delicious party foods i have ever made. there was a ton of food there too, but my dish was cleaned out. everyone was asking me for the recipe.   i also changed the recipe as suggested by others. used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour creme, added bank bread crumbs on top, baked in the oven, and added about 3 ounces of jalapenos. it didn't have enough heat with just 2.   served with fritos, but people were also eating it with tortilla chips from someone's other dip.   *** the parmesan cheese hardened on top after i baked it in the oven and let it cool. made it kind of difficult to break through the crust to get to the warm dip part***

Party hit! I ended up mixing the parm cheese into the dip instead of pouring on the top because I was serving it in small batches at a time. I served with blue tortilla chips, toasted french bread slices and fresh whole jalapeno's as a garnish. Everyone asked for the recipe!

I took this to a cookout a week ago.  It was so good.  As soon as people tasted it, they wanted the recipe!  There was none left.  I baked it in the oven and added the panko bread crumbs as suggested.

Amazing. I've tried a couple of variations, and I like sliced jalapenos over diced. It makes for a spicier dip.

This dip is fabulous for parties!!  It tastes just like a jalapeno popper!  I use a whole 4 oz. can of jalapenos to make it extra spicy and serve it with tortilla chips.

Awesome!  I made a mistake while preparing the dip and stirred in the parmesan cheese rather than putting it on the top.  Didn't seem to affect the taste it was great.  I will try to do it right the next time and see what happens.

Made this for my boyfriend's poker party... was the first appetizer eaten!! I also put breadcrumbs on the top and broiled after baking. They ate it with tortilla chips - don't think they cared what they were dipping in it!

A BIG HIT!! this will definitely become a cookout standard! I did make some of the changes suggested such as the Panko bread crumbs and parm. cheese for the topping. Also did half mayo half sour cream and added juice from slice jalepenos for an added kicked. Served wiht toasted baguette slices. No leftovers, darn it!

I made this over the weekend for some friends and everyone raved about it!  Like otheres, I did top mine with breadcrumbs and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes. I also used 4 ozs of jalapenos and it wasn't too spicy at all. This is definitely going to be a keeper and will be served at many social gatherings to come!

Excellent dip! Tastes exactly like jalapeno poppers! I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled the amount of jalapenos and topped the dip with bread crumbs, baking at 375 for about 15 minutes. Everyone loved it & there were definately no leftovers!

This was a big hit at a bunco party I had.  I baked it until warm at 375 degrees, instead of microwaving.  I served it with bagel chips.  I may add more jalepenos next time I make this but I was definately make this again.

very easy and a bit hit.  I made it a few hours ahead then put in the micro for a few minutes before serving- it was great.  not too spicy but had a kick (I'm really whimpy with spice).  Most considered it just right.

Great!  I read the reviews and mixed a bit of Panko with the cheese on top, as some suggested.  I actually think I would like it better as written, with just cheese.  Very easy.

This dip is my go-to recipe for parties and it gets rave reviews every time. I make it exactly to the recipe except I vary the amount of jalapeno depending on the crowd. Fritos are my favorite dipper to serve it with.

This stuff is great. I can't find canned diced jalapenos so I dice up 3-4 whole peppers. I’m ashamed to say but I’m a little lazy so I use the Parmesan cheese in the green can instead of grating up a cup of the fresh stuff but I do bake it and everybody at work loves it.

Wow, I was worried because even if recipes get great ratings I always seem to do something wrong.  I followed recipe very closely except added 4 0z. japs and about 1/3 diced serrano, I only had 3/4 cup of mayo left so I substituted the remaining sourcream. Mixed parm with dip, microwaved (cuz was running late) for 3 minutes, sprinkled more parm on top and broiled for about 6 minutes.  Rave reviews, not a drop left.  Men and Women both loved.  It def had some kick to it from the serrano. Yum thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper!

STIR IN MOST OF THE CHEESE, BUT LEAVE A LITTLE OUT TO SPRINKLE ON TOP; THEN DUST W/BREAD CRUMBS; SPRAY W/BUTTER PAM; BAKE 375 20 MIN.  AWESOME.  THANKS FOR AN EASY GREAT ONE!

I hate to review this recipe lower than a five, but I thought the cream cheese was a little over powering. Otherwise, the taste was pretty good. I did what other reviewers suggested and added bread crumbs to the top before baking for 25 minutes at 400 degrees. I think 1/2 cup is too much, if I make it again I'll use more like 1/4 or maybe even less (mixed in with the fresh grated parmesan). At the party I took it to, half RAVED about it and the other half didn't really have much to say. It makes a lot more than other spreads/dips I've tried, so next time I might scale it back to half!

I made this dip for a party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe but agreed it didn't have enough "heat."  I used the whole 4 ounce can of chopped jalapenos but it still wasn't enough.  Next time I will try fresh or chop the sliced jalapenos myself.

Double it. This was gobbled up. I used fresh serrano peppers plus canned green chilies, and sprinkled bread crumbs lightly on top.

Doubled the jalapenos as recommended by others.  Way too hot.  Will make again, but only use 2 oz jalapenos next time.

I add extra jalapenos for a spicier kick.  The left-overs warm up well in the microwave.

Was good but I could still taste the moyonnaise.  The next time I will add less and see if that improvies it.

Every single time I make this, people ask for the recipe (thankfully it is easy!!) and ask me to bring it again. Wonderful to put together ahead of time and then bake before you serve (or simply warm up).

I love new recipes and this one was a bit hit! chelleafouse was wondering why hers was so oily, I think alot of baked recipes using mayonnaise call for "Hellmann's" Mayonnaise.  It seems to work best. Give it a try, not as greasy.

A delicious appetizer. Of course, I did change the recipe a bit. Other reviewers suggested cheddar cheese..so I used both parmesan cheese and about 1/4-1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese and because I had them handy I drained a small can of artichoke hearts chopped them and added to the dip. I omitted the chilies and only used the jalapenos, sprinkled some cheddar on top and baked.  We served this with tortillas chips and watched it disappear.

This is a wonderful spread.  If you want to turn it into an INCREDIBLE DIP cut the cream cheese to 1 8oz bar.  It comes out rich and creamy and delicious!  I divide it into two seperate baking crocks and bake.  We love it with tortillia chips.  When having a party I make 3-4 batches for 6-8 crocks to set out.

Fantastic!  I used 4+ ounces of chopped jalepenos and cheddar rather than parm.  I added a 1/2 cup of cheddar into the mixture then put the other cup on top.  I topped with bread crumbs and sprayed with butter before baking, it needs the crumbs for the popper effect.  Served with Ritz and scoops.  Everyone LOVED it.  Will now be added to my party food list. Thanks:-)

I followed the recipe exactly, but after each dip of the chip, oil would fill up the hole where we dipped...we tried digging into this because the top layer was yummy, but the amount of oil on the bottom of my dish was unreal and unavoidable after a while!

Utterly fantastic! Tastes just like a cream-cheese popper. I bake mine @ 350 for 25 minutes or so which tasted better than microwave to me. This is one of those appetizer dips I am repeatedly asked to bring to the party~

Great recipe! I only had the green chillies    on hand, so I did not add the jalapeños and it still was fabulous.  I took the advice of others and added half mayo and half sour cream.  Recipe is definatly a keeper!!!

I can't go one house party without a million requests for this recipe to be made.  I love it and the boys can't get enough of it.  Tastes JUST LIKE a jalapeno popper!  One suggestion - Don't skimp on the brand of mayonnaise you use.. the last time I used the cheap store brand it came out worse than usual.

Delicious!  Made two small changes.  Added Panko to cheese topping, as others suggested.  Also added about 1-2 T. melted butter to cheese/Panko mix to aid in browning.  Wonderful on really well-toasted bread slices.  Big hit at party.  Uncle requested recipe for another get together and he said it was just as popular again.

Amazing!! I used both cheddar and parmesan cheese. I also left out the chilies and added more jalapenos to make up the difference. Just a matter of personal preference. Do not pass this one by!

I didn't like this very much.  Perhaps I did something wrong or used the wrong bread to dip.  I plan on using the leftover to incorporate into an enchilada sauce to use it up.

WONDERFUL!!!!  I made this for a large crowd this past weekend, and it was a BIG hit.  So quick and easy, too.  I took another reviewer's advice and mixed 1/2 cups of panko bread crumbs with the Parmesan cheese, baked in the oven, and served with toasted French bread.  Everyone was asking for the recipe....especially the men!  I will definitely be making this again soon.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is the perfect appetizer for a party.  Guys love it just as much as the girls!  I make mine with fresh roasted green chilies when available during roasting season.  I also serve mine with the sliced toasted bread from the bakery.

I have made this spread about 15 times now. I first saw this recipie in December of last year.  I wanted to take something different to take to a Xmas party at familys get together. This was such a HUGE success that i MUST make this all the time now. Everyone just loved this and even the teenagers asked me what it was because it was just sooo good. I have to say I have found the best recipies on this site. Its so amazing, everyone thinks im such a wonderful cook.:) Thanks a million for sharing such a great recipie. MUST MAKE THIS!!

This dip was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as directed, and added the Panko and baked it in the oven like others suggested. I served it with the toasted sliced french bread and this was a total hit. So good!

Oh yeah...this recipe is a keeper. I love it and so does everybody else when I make it. It's perfect as it is. I bake it in the oven at 350 until bubbly.

I have been making this for every party I have because my guest keep requesting it. It is a hit! I bake mine for 20-30 mins because I like the cheese on top a little crusty, but otherwise it is perfect!

Made this last night for a party at the neighbors...everyone loved this dip! Completely addicting!  I added the Panko bread crumbs on top of the parm cheese, as others suggested.  I also doubled the jalapenos b/c we like the heat.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes and served with sliced french baguette...devine!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it really lacked in flavor.  I think I'll follow other advice next time and add more jalapeno.  I don't like hot foods and was afraid I couldn't eat it, but it turned out a little bland.

Made this last night, everyone loved it!! I added the extra hots and bread crumbs. I think next time I made it I may add some shedded cheese to it, just a bit to creamy for my taste.

Awesomely easy dip!  I followed another viewer's advise and used panko for topping.  It was fantastic!  The only problem is it's gone too fast! Everyone wants this recipe-Thanks!

Made this recipe exactly as listed except I doubled the jalapenos. Way too much mayo! It might have been better if I had used half sour cream as others have suggested. Personally didn't think it tasted anything like a popper.

WOW!! This recipe is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the party loved it. I followed the recipe except I used three fresh jalapeno peppers (my grocery store didn't have canned). I did add bread crumbs and extra parm on top and sprayed it with pam threw it in the oven for 15 min and it turned out great. Even without the bread crumbs it would have been great, it was more for presentation.  Thanks so much Denise for sharing this recipe with us.

I made this for the Superbowl.  We couldn't stop eating it.  I doubled the amount of peppers since all of us enjoy a dip with a kick.  All ready making it again this weekend.

As the first recipe I've made from this website, this was completely amazing and I'm hooked! I made it for a Superbowl party and the dip was gone by halftime! I added a 1/2 cup of shredded mexican cheese blend to the dip portion.  I served with Fritos.  Excellent!

i was skeptical about this recipe, but it was a huge hit at a Super Bowl party this weekend! :)Dont judge it by the way it tastes before baking! I followed the advice of another reviewer and topped it with Panko crumbs and grated parmesan before baking. YUM!!

I made this recipie (with 4 ounces of jalapenos) for the "Big Game". I took some to work the next day, everyone was raving about it! I'm not a big jalapeno fan nor were my co-workers but I ended up going home with an empty tub! This spread is Amazing! Kudos for posting it!

OMG! This was terrific! I used lower fat mayo & cream cheese-didn't affect flavors at all.  Baked in over 30 min and browned the top a little.  I liked this with wheat thins- hubby liked triscuit.  This will be a staple in my dip file- Thank you!!

I finally made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was great!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, as others had suggested.  I also did use about 1/2 cup of jalapenos.  Most everyone in the family likes things spicy, so it was perfect for us.  I made it in the crock pot and it turned out great.

Followed suggestions of others and topped with bread crumbs mixed with fresh grated parmesan...this was a party hit!  It turned out golden brown and yummy--definitely a great addition to our Super Bowl Party!

So good! I baked it for 30 mins at 375 as suggested. I would call it moderately spicy, so next time I will add some extra jalapenos (we like things pretty spicy). But in terms of making it to bring other places, the spice is perfect as is. Highly recommend this spread! Served w/little petite toasts. Honestly, it would taste good on just about anything!

I did the baked version and did not change a thing. Alot easier than cleaning and making poppers.  A+ all the way. Will definately keep this recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is excellent as it is. I did as suggested and added some bread crumbs to the topping and baked it off. Make it as is and step back because people will hurt you to get to this spread. :)

I've been making this for months now and it's AWESOME!  I bring this to a friends house every Saturday night when we play cards and drink.  Everyone loves it!  I follow the recipe exactly...  add a sprinkling of bread crumbs to the top and bake for 20-30 minutes.  YUMMY!

Took this to a football party and everyone loved it!  Here's what I did.  I followed the measurements exactly but added a few things.  Using the ideas of the others, I mixed half of the parm cheese into the dip mix.  The other half I added to some breadcrumbs (mixed with a little bit of melted butter first).  I then baked it in the oven for about 25 minutes!  Served with pieces of french baguette bread slices, it was YUMMY!

Made a trial batch for the family before the super bowl tomorrow, and it was great.  I used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream. Added garlic and onion powder. Perfect.  I used to own a diner in the Chicago area and Jalapeno Poppers were one of our top sellers.  These are just as good, and not deep fried.

Altered this recipe with additions of cumin and garlic. Instead of the microwave, I baked it in a 350 F oven until the top was bubbly and golden. Everyone loved it! This is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe!  I substituted sour cream for the mayo since I was serving to someone with an egg allergy.  Also, followed advice and mixed shredded parmesan with panko breadcrumbs for topping.  Served on toasted baguette.  Awesome!

What a wonderful recipe.  Taste great with Pita Chips.  I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled parm cheese and bread crumbs on top.  Baked until bubbly and a little brown on top around 350 degrees.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This will become a new favorite app in our house.  I agree that you should bake in the oven.  It helps the parm cheese on top.  It tastes JUST like a popper.  I think I will try breadcrumbs on top next time (and perhaps double the recipe..it went so quick!)

The biggest hit of the evening.  People were asking for the recipe like crazy!  I added more jalapenos for extra kick but it was a bit spicy, but I like that.  I did what other reviews said by adding bread crumbs and cheese at end and baking and it was to die for!  Tasted just like jalapeno poppers!

excellent.  I made it with "hot" jalapenos (canned) and got many requests for the recipe.  Best on french bread. we even liked it cold!

I made this recipe with miracle whip instead of mayo.  Do not make the same mistake as I did.  I think this recipe probably tastes really good if made exactly to the recipe, however it is terribly fatty.  I read the reviews not to make any substitution... so I went to the store and bought mayo.  Long story short when I was reading the label and seeing the 100 calories per tablespoon I freaked and subbed the miracle whip last minute.  I will definately try to make this recipe again. It just sounds so good! Exactly like something all my friends would like... but I might try the half mayo and half sour cream option some reviewers have said.  I simply cannot justify making this full fat.

This recipe is so good!  I made this as an appetizer for dinner and we ate almost the whole thing beforehand.  I would have been satisfied just having this!  I kept the recipe the same and will definitely be making again!

This is an amazing tasting spread!  My picky, picky husband and all his family loved it!  I made it exactly according to the ingredients, but I did stir the parmesan cheese into the mixture of cream cheese instead of placing it on top and then put it in the oven to bake according to the instructions provided.  I never was a fan of jalapeno before but I loved this one.  It was the only spread completely eaten during our Christmas and New Year's parties.  Tostito's scoops are awesome to use with this spread.  When eating it, prepare to sweat!!  Thanks for a wonderful party recipe.

This was great! I halved this recipe, added a bit of sour cream, diced two fresh jalapeno peppers, topped with breadcrumbs & parmesan cheese, and baked for 30 min instead of using the microwave. Every loved it. Great party food.

Very good! I subed one of the packages of cream cheese with low fat cream cheese and then half of the Mayo with low fat mayo. Made it this way and then another night the regular way. Couldn't tell the difference at all.

Delicious!  We crunched up a bunch of saltines and tossed them with some melted butter and the Parmesan instead of using the cheese alone on top.

Yum!  We served this at New Year's eve and our guests loved it.  I used a 4oz can of chiles and 2 whole jalapenos (without the seeds).  Next time, I will be sure to add extra jalapenos and some of the seeds to spice things up.  I also mixed about 1/2 cup of parmesan into the mixture (I didn't read the recipe close enough and just started mixing).  This will become a staple at all of our parties!

I made this yesterday for the first time for a get-together with 9 people.  It was gone by the end of the night!  Everyone LOVED it and wanted the recipe.  I just used fresh shredded parmesan on top and baked it in a glass pie plate at 375 deg for 30 minutes and it was a hit.  Thanks for posting such a great recipe!

It really tastes like the inside of a popper.  My husband is hooked.  I've made it a few times and the next time I'm going to cut down on the parm cheese, it gets a little greasy.

Easy and delicious...made it twice over the holidays and not a drop left each time...I did add a little more jalapenos for the extra kick.  Also, recommend baking instead of microwave..just bake at 350 until bubbly and the top is brownish

Everyone raved and raved about this dip at my New Years Eve party.  One change I made was some crumbled leftover bacon.  It made sense to me since I loved bacon wrapped jalapenos and I think it made the dip even better.

WOW! We love jalapeno poppers and this was great!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could.
This is what I did- I used the suggested cream cheese (I used Lite) and the Mayo, I added maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of Shredded Cheddar, and 1/4 cup of parm. Stirred that up and put some more cheddar on top.  
I used the suggested chiles and used FRESH jalapeno's (7 of them). 
I baked at 300 for 20 minutes....and wow...TO DIE FOR! :) This will be a staple for parties for years to come!:)
THANK YOU!

Wonderful recipe.  You can make as hot as you want by adjusting the jalapeno.  I used pickled jalapeno.  Panko is a must on top to give it that added little edge.

I can't believe how insane my family and friends went for this dip. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 4 oz. of jalapenos to get a decent level of heat. I also combined the cup of parmesan with a 1/2 cup of panko and mixed it with a few splashes of oil before spreading it on top of the dip. Mixing the cheese and panko together (instead of layering) prevents them from forming a tough crust that is hard for the bread or chip to get through. I am asked to bring this at every family function...they love it!

Took this to my sister's house for 
Christmas and people attacked it like 
ravenous wolves.  SO EASY -- you cannot mess it up.  I had to add a lot more of the diced jalapeno for my crew.  We prefer things with a little "kick" to it.  Served with Tostitos Scoops, Keebler honey wheat cracker dipping sticks, and the new thin Triscuit chips.  All were yummy with this dip.  Next time, I may add a little shredded parmesan in addition to the grated.  Didn't have time to find the bread crumbs other reviewers suggested but will try next time.  To review:  FAST and E-Z to prepare and DELICIOUS.  Yay!!

WOW!  My girlfriend made this for a baby shower. I don't usually eat jalapeno anything cuz I don't like stuff that's too hot but I took one bite of this, I nearly fell over, LOL! cuz it was so spicy (she used the whole 4oz can of jalapenos) but man was it AMAZING!! I couldn't stop eating it...it was extremely addictive for me who doesn't usually go beyond mild salsa.  I have now made this for Thanksgiving and 2 Christmas parties.  I was going to make it for New Year's too but my hubby finally said it was time to make something else :)...Thanks for the great recipe, it's perfect just the way it is!!

I brought this to Christmas dinner for the appetizer and it was a HUGE hit!  Even those who weren't big fans of jalapeno poppers loved it!  I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees F.  The thing that REALLY made it tasty for us was using raspberry preserves on top after it was baked.  Yummy!  Yummy!  Yummy!  I am going to try 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream the next time as someone else suggested.

Simple and delicious!  I doubled the amount of jalepenos, and they seemed to get hotter the longer they were in the dip.  I also baked it for 20 minutes on 400.  It was a hit at the holiday party.

Fantastic and so simple. I lightened it by using low fat cream cheese and canola mayo, but it was still VERY rich. Also the topping others have mentioned adds so much -- I microwaved the dip until warm and then put it in a shallow oven-safe dish and topped with a mix of parm, panko bread crumbs (Ian's brand is great) and a sprinkle olive oil, then baked at 400 until topping was browned and bubbly. Served with french bread slices; agree with others that chips like fritos overpower the dip.  Microwaving first and then browning in toaster oven saves time on this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a little bland for us.  Spicy, but I think it needs something more.  Not sure what.  On the other hand, jalapeno poppers can be somewhat bland as well, so in that case, it's right on!  Pretty good with toasted baguette slices.

This recipe needed some work. It was just too spicy but to be fair I did add fresh chillies instead of canned. So I added a bit of sour cream, garlic and spinach. Everyone enjoyed the spice although I didn't think ppl would and ppl actually went up for seconds even though they said it was a bits spicy but addictive!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!  I substituted 8oz of the cream cheese with the “1/3 reduced fat cream cheese” and it still turned out great.  I did add a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to the top of the dish before I put it in the oven and it turned the top into a beautiful golden brown color and was easy to break through with the baguettes.  I toasted 1/4" thick slices of a baguette in the oven and served hot with the dip.  It was a great success at our dinner.  

One note, next time I make this recipe, I will definitely mix in about 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the mixture.

I will make this again and again!

This was really good even with the modifications I made. I made this with what I had on hand so I reduced serving size down to 8. I used reduced fat cream cheese,shredded parmesan and a little panko crumbs on top. I sprayed the top lightly with Pam cooking spray to crisp up. I put it in the oven at 375 for about 25 min. I served it with tortilla chips and also Ritz crackers. The Ritz were better because it gave it the crispy texture. This was so good that my husband and I finished the whole thing. Yum.

Made this for the first time this week, twice actually for two different parties, and it was a hit both times. People couldn't stop commenting on it and asking for the recipe. We all loved it! I made it exactly as recipe said, although I did use 4oz jalapenos and added the panko crumbs to the Parmesan.  This recipe will definitely be used again and again.

Perfect!!!  No need for any adjustments.  I took it to a party last night and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  So, so easy!

SOOOOO addicting!! I brought these to a THanksgiving get together and it was the hit!! THe only thing I changed was that I added 4 oz of jalapenos instead of 2, then used a freshly graded parsmean/breadcrumb mix sprinkled it heavly on top and baked for 30 minutes at 350.  I had to write down the recipe for so many people! Trust me..you should try it!!!!

I made this for the second time last week for a potluck at work.  It is fantastic and everyone asks for the recipe.  I do bake it rather than microwave.  I also mix 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese into the mixture then take another 1/4 cup of cheese and mix with 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs and sprinkle over top.  The panko bread crumbs give it a nice crunchy top.  It is a crowd pleaser!

This is absolutely the BEST dip/spread that I've ever made!  The only thing I do differently is I mix in a little freshly grated parmesian cheese as well as sprinkling some on the top. When serving it at a party, I put some sliced jalapeno's on the top just as a clue to those that don't appreciate a little heat that this is a SPICY dip! 
Everyone RAVES everytime I make it!
Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

As is this recipe tasted like cream cheese and thats it. It didn't have enough flavor and it had no heat. I even used the hot jalapenos. I ended up adding an entire fresh jalapeno seeds and all. It still didn't have enough heat so I added hoppin jalapeno sauce. After that it was good and went over well at the party.

This dip is delicous!  I took others' advice and added the mayo, cheeses, fresh jalapenos, and breadcrumbs.  I also doubled the recipe.  I love how you can control the heat yourself by adding more or less peppers.  We ate this dip with Tostitos scoops.  Everyone absolutely loved it!

This was great. Like other reviewers I added the entire can of jalapeno's but still thought it needed more heat.  Next time I'm going to sautee fresh peppers and add them.

I wasn't quite sure everyone would like this recipe but I shouldn't have worried! This was great and gone quickly at my Thanksgiving dinner. I followed some other reviews and used half mayo and half sour cream, then put half the parmesan on top and half in the dip then baked it for 30 minutes.Outstanding!! And it did taste just like a jalapeno popper!

I used the canned jalapenos as I was making a lot of appetizers for a party.  For those people that like jalapenos or hotter dishes they will definitely enjoy this spread.  The dip does get spicer if you bake it.  Both ways are very good, baked or unbaked.

I read through pages of reviews, just to be sure of this recipe, and I can easily say it gets a 5 stars from me. Just like the reviews said I was asked for the recipe by several people and have a request to bring it to an upcoming function. The only change I did was 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes!

I liked this a lot, but I had to add twice as many jalapenos to it in order for it to taste like jalapeno poppers.

I was very skeptical of this dip at first but after making it, it is so great! The only change I made was to add more jalapenos. It heats up pretty well too. Marvelous dip!

I made this recipe exactly as written (so often the reviews say they liked this dip, but they changed everything about it, making it not this dip at all!) and it was great!  I made it twice and the second time I put in a little less mayo and I liked it even more.  I use Canola oil mayo and I think the flavor of that mayo is a little different then your usual mayonnaise.  I also just used regular kraft Parmesan cheese cause that's what I had, and it was very tasty.  I served it with white corn chips and it was sooooo good!  Thanks for the great recipe:-)

Loved this recipe!I was looking for something different to serve as an appetizer and this did it! My family raved about it and requested it for the superbowl party. Even my 9 year old grandson couldn't get enough!! I too, used some panko crumbs with the parmesan so that it would brown well.

This was just okay. I was actually surprised it has had such great ratings. I took others advice (added more chilis, panko breadcrumbs w/butter on top.. put in oven, not micro..) and it came out ok but then as it cooled it hard and tough to eat. Maybe micro is the way to go. Will not make again though, and I LOVE spicy foods, but this lacked something. I'll stick with the Buffalo Chicken Dip which we like a lot. But if you try this, I wouldn't put it in the oven, or bother with the breadcrumbs, it only dries out this dip. Good luck!

Made this the other night and it was an instant hit.  I omitted the green chilis, doubled the jalapenos, and topped it off with panko crumbs sprayed with Pam.  I then baked it at 375 until bubbly and the bread crumbs were brown (about 25 min). People labeled the dish "Heaven in a Bowl".  And yes, I did have to give the recipe out.

VERY GOOD! Made this for a shower yesterday and it went quick. Everyone asked for the recipe. I served it with toasted mini french bread slices and Ritz crackers as suggested by another member. It was GREAT with the toast, others liked it with ritz or tostitos. After the shower my brother-in-law finished it off with fritos! I am now required to make this at every event!!

Wow...this is so easy and so tasty!  I may use 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo next time.  I added a 4 oz. can of jalapenos and thought that was perfect...just enough heat.  I baked in the oven and did the fresh parmesan/bread crumb mixture on top.

I'VE MADE THIS TWICE AND BOTH TIMES  USED TWO 4 OUNCE CANS OF DICED JALAPENO BY MISTAKE AND IT IS FABULOUS.  MIX THE CHEESE INTO THE SPREAD, USE REDUCED FAT MAYO AND CREAM CHEESE.  EVERYONE AT WORK LOVED IT AND MANY ARE MAKING IT THIS WEEKEND.

Outstanding. Easy.  This went over very well at a get-together.  I followed the recipe, except I baked it instead of heating it in the microwave.  It could have been hotter for my taste, however I think it's perfect as is for taking it to a party.  Everyone has a different tolerance for 'heat'.

This dip was very good.  I made it for a recent halloween party.  I would also recommend topping with bread crumbs.  I served it with tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again.

OUTSTANDING! I have been wanting to try this recipe for so long and I am glad I did! So simple and easy it's almost too good to be true. You would think it needs something else, but it sure doesn't! I followed the recipe but added about 3/4 cup of crushed croutons to the top to add a crunch, and baked for about 20 min. instead of microwaving. I would highly recommend adding a bread crumb topping and baking to complete this amazing dip. I used tortilla chips and baked french bread chunks, can't decide which one was better liked, it was great both ways. This is my new go-to dip, and the most important recommendation would probably be to double the recipe, because it sure doesn't stick around for long!

This was great!  I could not find canned Jalapeno's so I used two fresh ones and it was just the right amount of kick for a crowd.  I did as others suggested and mixed the parm in throught and sprinkling just a little on top.  I baked in the oven at 350 for about 35 mins until bubbly!  Will make again thank you!

So good! It always gets gobbled up when I bring it to parties, and I get tons of compliments. I make it in a pie plate and do an italian breadcrumb/parmesan mixture on top and bake it so that it resembles the breading on a jalapeno popper. Making this for my brother-in-law's birthday tomorrow; can't wait to eat it!

I was really hoping this would turn out good.  I read all of the reviews and it sounded so YUMMY!  I tried doing what some of the other reviewers said and added some cheddar cheese to the mixture.  That is all I did different from the original recipe and it turned out to be pretty much mushy grease.  I mean the cream cheese, jalepeno mixture curdled up and was swimming in grease.  It did have a good flavor when I fished out some of the cream cheese jalepeno mixture onto my tortilla chip though (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one). I really want to know what went wrong :( I know it isn't supposed to be like this, atleast I don't think so anyway.  Could it be the fact that I added cheddar cheese and that mixed with the mayo produced too much grease????  Anyone else have this issue?

I tried this last night and enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half, and used "hot" vs "mild" green chilis and jalapenos.  I have a somewhat low tolerance for spicy foods, but did end up adding more chili and jalapenos to taste.  (For a half recipe, I used 4 oz green chili and almost 4 oz jalap.)  I tried this with toasted french bread (YUM!), Wheat Thins (not so great) and Cabaret Crackers (good, but bread was better).  The spread tasted better after it sat for a bit.

This was a very good dip/spread. I used both a large can of green chilies and just a small amount of chopped jalapenos. I only used 1/2 cup of mayo, and 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. I think next time I'll add very finley chopped crispy bacon- like the real jalapeno poppers.

Was great, used the panko bread crumb idea and it was wonerfull.  I also combined the parmesan cheese with the cream cheese mixture instead of on top.  No leftovers and was asked for the recipe.  :)

This was a really phenomenal dip!  The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I had to add waaaay more jalepenos than called for in the original recipe.  I like things moderately spicy so I started out with the recommended amount of peppers but I couldn't even taste them! I kept adding and tasting and by the time I was done I had used 4 ounces of chiles and 12 ounces of jalepenos!  Not one person at the party I brought this to thought it was too hot.  Do not try this dip cold,  all you will taste is mayonaise, but once heated (I baked mine) you just get the lovely cream cheese and parmesan flavor.  The consistency was really nice too,  not too runny but not too thick.  Everyone LOVED it!

This was really good....I even like it cold.  Next time though will make with 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream...a little too mayonnaissey for me but I have a thing about mayonnaise. Also mixed in the parmesan. Used the whole 4 oz. of jalapenos....wasn't too spicy at all. My 2 little grandgirls said it was "spicy" but ate it right up.  My daughter took it to a Halloween party last night and got lots of requests for the recipe. Thanks & will make it again!

Magnificent!!!  I did mix in half the parmesean and top with the other half. Next time will mix it all in and I baked it instead of microwaving it. Spread perfection.  I agree with all those who used toasted french bread and ritz crackers. Worked out great.

This was really good! I topped the mixture with panko bread crumbs as other reviewers suggested however I really didn't think that this lended much to the recipe - it would have tasted just as good without it! I tried this because I'm a huge fan of Arby's jalapeno poppers, and I would love to figure out a way to get the flavor or their "Bronco Berry" sauce into this dip. Perhaps next time I'll put a layer of berry preserves on the bottom...

I made this for a get-together and everyone devoured it.  It was gone before everything else on the table.  I was ask for the recipe several times.  The one taste I got of it was very yummy!!!  I served with thin slices of toasted french bread & I baked instead of microwaving.

This was very good and easy!  I accidently bought sliced marinated jalapenos and so I just through them in the food processor. I would make this again for sure.  Everyone loved it!

All the reviews are dead on! This is an amazing dip. I added more chilis to give it more of a zest--the more the better!

I made this dip for a Steeler's party and it was hit!! Everyone was a liitle skeptical but with a little coaxing they all loved it(even my father who hates mayo with a passion). I made no changes and used toasted french bread slices as suggested by another user. This will definetly be my new "party" dip!

The basic recipe is good but i modified the recipe to improve it.  Instead of mayo i opted for sour cream, heating slowly on the stove top.  I increased the amount of jalapenos to 4 ounces and added 2 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp of paprika, salt, and white pepper.

This dip was so easy to make. I made it last night but waited until today to heat it. 
I served it with Ritz crackers, which really makes it taste like a popper.
I also served it with melba toast and bagel chips.

Next time I make this I'll add more jalapeno and chilies because I like it with a little more kick. This version is mild but still very very VERY good!!!!

Good dip.  Used 4oz. of chopped jalapenos from a jar.  I also stirred 1/2 c. parmesan into the mixture and sprinkled the rest over the top.  Baked at 350* for about 20 min., until it was lightly browned on top.  Served with French baguette slices.

Outstanding! One thing we do add is about 1/3 cup of finely-minced PECANS. Pound pecans in a ziploc bag and blend them in w/the mixture--lots of flavor without a "nutty" taste. Balances the kick of the recipe. Easily adjusted--hotter or milder as you like it. Excellent! Thanks so much!

It tasted just like jalapeno poppers!!  I served it with Ritz crackers and that really pulled it together.  The crackers tasted like the breading.

Made a few of the changes that were recommended by other reviewers and it was such a hit.  As the previous reviewer said, it was gone before all the guests arrived. "Who made that dip" was the question on the night!  Having never made this recipe before, I was happy with the positve results.  I have been asked to make it for the next two parties that are coming up! Thank you Denise_Ramsey for a great recipe!

This was a good recipe but I made a few changes.  I used 6 fresh jalapenos that i chopped very fine, seeds and all.  I didn't use the canned chilis.  I microwaved the ingredients for about a minute to soften them and then mixed.  Spread into a pie pan and sprinkled a mixture of breadcrumbs and fresh parm cheese and baked in the oven until bubbly. Served with triscuits. Next time I will have to make a double batch because the dip was gone before all of the guests even arrived!!

also, i used reduced fat cc and mayo! :)

I have never had something go over as big as this did last night.  I took this to a camping potluck and it was all everyone was asking; who brought it and what's in it? SO simple. I did dump in all of both cans including the liquid and it was gone before I worked my way back up to get some of it.  Being in a trailer, I didn't have a nuker, so I baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I'm sure it didn't need to be that long but it did give a nice crust to the top.  Served it with Wheat Thins but will try it with the sourdough when we are at home.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this!  An absolute winner!!!

This dip is incredibly delicious! I used 2 fresh jalapenos instead of canned. The next time I might use 1 more for a little more heat, but there were no complaints. My guests wiped the dish clean with pieces of french bread. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

This dip is AWESOME!  I did use fresh jalapenos (5)...will use more next time because it wasn't very hot. Placed the dip in a small baking dish. Mix panko crumbs and oil together and sprinkled it on top and baked!  Very yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly.  My friends loved it.  Crostini was the favorite dipper.  I think next time I'll add bread crumbs as suggested by others.  Thanks for a great party recipe!

Made this recipe yesterday for my hubby and some buddies he had over for football. It was a big hit! A little too much mayonnaise flavor for my taste. Maybe will use half mayo and half sourcream next time. Also mixed in the parm cheese. Ate it with tortilla chips which was good but I thank it would be awesome with some cut up pieces of bagel. Thanks for this super easy and delicious recipe!

I made this weekend for a party, and had three people ask me for the recipe, and two others told me they couldn't keep coming back for more.  I added a little more jalepeno's than the recipe called for, just to pump it up a notch. I also made it ahead of time, and added the parmasan cheese right before I heated it. I ended up serving it in a warming bowl, and it looked great throughout the evening.....until till it was all gone!

I followed recipe as stated, just cut in half due to only having one block of cream cheese--this is really, really good. We used tortilla chips and dipped them in this--yummo!
The only thing I did not like about it was it looked kinda greasy. Other than that, it rates high in my book! Thanks!

The best! These are the changes I incorporated based on previous reviewers suggestions: 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo, 4 oz jalapenos, 1/2 c grated parm mixed into the dip. For the topping I mixed 1/2 c grated parm with 1/2 c panko, spread it on top and baked for 25-30 minutes at 375, until hot and bubbly. I took it to a party last night and people loved it.

One word...Wonderful.  Easy, inexpensive and taste out of the world.  I would just like others and add a pinch of garlic salt and the bread crumbs next time.

This was so good!  I did the baked version and used freshly grated parmasan cheese.  I also used 3oz of jalapeno peppers which made it very spicy!  I wouldn't use more than that for my taste.  I will be making this again!

I made this last night for a group of friends after reading numerous ratings and incorporating those that made the most sense: Panko Crumbs, more Jalapenos, fresh Parmesan, and baking/broiling instead of the microwave.
Taste was really good but the Panko / Parmesan became cardboard after broiling.
I'll have to revisit the topping options before I make this again.

This was great!  I did not have jalepeno peppers, so I just added some tobasco to heat it up a bit.  Huge hit.  Next time I will add the peppers.

mmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!  This was excellent!!!  I used 3 fresh jalapenos.  They were perfect.  Spicy and not too hot to handle.  I was smart enough to wear gloves to cut up the jalapenos.

Great dip!  I started out cutting down to a half recipe... one package of cream cheese, one half cup of mayo, and one half cup of grated Parmesan, since there were only going to be three people eating it.  I made it using two ounces of green chiles and one ounce of Jalapeños, then tasted it.  I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy, so I ended up using the whole 4 ounce can of jalapeños, and I liked the flavor of the green chiles, so I used the whole 4 ounce can of that as well.  Nuked it for a couple of minutes then put it into a small slow cooker.  It was truly addictive!!!  Actually only two of us were really eating it, and we just about polished off the entire batch!  Although all agreed that it was better when it was stirred together so the Parmesan wasn't a layer on top but rather mixed into the dip.  But that's just personal preference.  Also, I think I'll take it up another notch or two the next time and use even MORE Jalapeños!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, I'll definitely make this one again.

This was awesome!  I used the panko bread crumbs with the parm cheese and a little melted butter than baked it for 30 mins.  It was so good!  I left what was leftover at a friends house and now I am regretting that decision as I am craving more of it now.

This is THE BEST DIP around.  Next time I'm going to do what one reviewer suggested and use Panko bread crumbs with a splash of oil.  Also, I agree, you must use fresh cheese not in the green can.  It really makes a difference.  When I made mine, I also made tacos that night.  The next day I took the leftover taco meat and blended it with the leftover spread and threw some mexican cheese on top and reheated it.  That was delicious too.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Its a keeper.

This turned out wonderful and you get all the flavor that you would get from a jalapeno popper! The only thing I added was some panko bread crumbs to the parmesan topping and I used a full can of the jalapeno peppers. I took it to a party and it was a big hit.

The Jalapeno popper's spread had very good flavor but it needed more peppers . the spread was not very hot. I will fix this again but I will add another 7 or 8 fresh jalapeno peppers

I made this a couple hours early so I could just pop it into the oven when we were ready to eat it but could not wait to try it so I put a little into a small dish and sprinkled the parm on it and threw into the microwave...it was sooo good!
That night I took it out of the fridge,sprinkled it with the parm and baked it...it was not so good.The parm became one big sheet of cheese that did not scoop up,you had to pull it apart with your fingers.
MICROWAVE this it is waaaaay better that way!

This is our new favorite dip!  I took other reviewer suggestions and used all of the listed ingredients.  I added more jalepenos (and will add more - about 5 oz next time), some shredded cheddar and used shredded parmesan.  I also topped and baked with parm and bread crumbs with a final spray of Pam.  What a dish!!  I served with thinly sliced and toasted French bread and it was perfect.  This is definitely going into the recipe book.

This was wonderful. I had a fresh jalapeno in addition to the other ingredients, so I chopped that up and threw it in. The dip was tasty, but a little too spicy for my taste. It would have been perfect if I had just followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make this the next time I have a party!

I made this recipe for a party over the weekend and it was devoured.  I used freshly grated Parmesan and tossed it with some Panko breadcrumbs and baked it in the oven.  Broiled it for the last minute or so to get it golden brown on the top.  Served it with toasted baguette slices.  Only change I would make is next time I will add a some more jalapeno...we like it spicy!  Delicious!

Have made this several times and everybody loves it, it's usually one of the first things finished off.  I usually don't like my food too hot but do double the jalapeno in this for a needed "kick."  Just about always use fresh grated parmesan including this recipe and serve with tortilla chips.

DELICIOUS!!! I have been making this for years. I used "Tamed" jalapenos, and it gives it just enough spiciness without being overpowering. I sprinkle the top with a nice layer of Parmesan cheese, but I never measure it out. I wouldn't use bread crumbs in place of the Parmesan, because the Parmesan gives it a great flavor. I serve with sliced french bread, baguette bread, or even inside of a bread bowl.

I made this for a football party and it was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and baked it instead of using the microwave. I served it with tortilla chips. Soooo awesome! One of my favorite dips ever.

I made this for a party this weekend, and everyone loved it!  The only things I did differently were using only canned jalapenos because the store was apparently experiencing some sort of hot pepper shortage, and I put some bread crumbs on top before baking.

It was very good but I thought there was too much mayonnaise. I will definitely make this again, only next time I will use less mayonnaise. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, very easy to make.  I served with crackers once and toasted french bread  the next time.  Crackers seemed to be the favorite and easier to eat with.

I wanted to serve this as a cold dip because it's too hot up here to turn on the oven.  But because I didn't bake it, I think that prevented the jalapeno flavor from getting into all that cream cheese.  I also used sour cream in place of the mayo.  To make it give it more flavor I added 1/4 c. jalapeno juice from the jar and twice as much jalapeno and left out the cheese.  Before I made the adjustments no one was interested, but after I mixed it up the spread/dip was thinner & easier to eat with corn chips and people seemed to eat a lot more of it.

I also subbed 6 fresh jalapenos and 1/2 cup sour cream for half the mayo.  I tasted it cold and wasn't sure if it would be too mayonnaise-y.  It is soooo good warmed and just like the real poppers.  I'll be bring this one around for a while!

This is the best. SO So tasty!!! I made this at a family BBQ and it went over well. I only added 1 can of Jalapenos. We do not like it so HOT. We had it with sourdough bread. Perfect!!

I took this recipe at it word and found it to be bland for my tastes.  I would double both the canned jalapenos and green chilis in order to give it some spice.

My husband and I LOVE this dip! I adjusted the recipe by adding only a half cup of mayo and a 4 oz can of diced jalapenos. I serve the dip with sliced and toasted Italian bread. Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  It was the hit of the graduation party.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and add buttered breadcrumbs to the top for a little "fried" flavor.  Next time, I will also use a more shallow casserole-type dish as opposed to a bowl for more topping per dip.

EXCELLENT!!! This was the hit of the baby shower, everyone loved it. I doubled the amt of jalapenos and I stirred half of the parmesan into the dip and the other half I sprinkled on top befire microwaving. I had to microwave for 5 minutes. This was SO easy to make and absolutely addictive. I have a favorite popper recipe that everyone demands I make for every party, but my mom said that she liked this more! Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy and great tasting! I just made half a recipe because I only had 8 oz. of cream cheese. Used light mayo to cut calories a little bit. It was really yummy. Made a nice pre-dinner appetizer for my family. We had it with tortilla chips, but will try the french bread idea next time around. Thanks for this keeper recipe!!

I make this recipe as directed, with the exception that after heating I allow it to cool down and put it into the fridge. We prefer it cold! The contrast of the cold cream cheese mixture to the spicy/hot peppers is amazing! Will be using this party hit for a long time! Thanks!

I have made this so many times and people LOVE it!!  I love it because it is so darn simple!  I use the full can of jalapenos.  Some people say it is too hot but I think it has just enough kick.  

I don't bake it at all.  I just shred fresh parmesan and stir that into it.

Made this while my brother came to visit-he loved it, I loved it, everyone loved it!  I only used one can of jalapenos because thats all i had and 2 cans of green chilies- You can still really taste the jalepenos, perfect if you dont want it too hot.  would be good with crumbled bacon!

I really liked this!  I added more jalepeno then it called for and a pinch of cayenne pepper since I like the spice.  Mixed it together, spread it on sliced sour dough bread and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes until warmed through - Delicious!!

OMG this is so addicting. I made this for a party and was a huge hit! I added a few "extra hot" jalapenos from a jar I already had. In fact 3 days after the party I made some just for myself! Not only did I use it as a dip but I used it on burgers! YUMMY! Thanks so much!

This is SO fabulous!  I have taken it to every potluck and picnic since I first saw it and every time I am asked how to make it.  I do add the whole can of jalapeno's (4oz) instead of just the 2 ozs.  Gives it a bit more zing.  Terrific!

Excellent!  I plan to make this again and again.  I had a glass jar of jalapeno's leftover so I just chopped some of those up.  It wasn't quite spicy enough for my taste, so I added some finely chopped giardianaire (it's actually called Tuscany Pizza Topping by Phil Stefani and is sold at the grocery store by the rest of the hot peppers.  It comes already finely chopped too!  It contains green & black olives, hot & bell peppers, carrots, celery, cauliflower, pimentos, and various seasonings/spices.)

This is so good. I know that the submitter said to not use Sour Cream in place of the Mayo, but really it's okay. I used Sour cream in place of the mayo and then topped it with a bit of cheddar cheese, the Parmesan (not a full cup), and bread crumbs, then a little melted butter. It is a crowd pleaser.

Awesome!  Definitely use REAL Parm. Cheese.  Everyone loves this stuff!  Also, I used about 8 oz. of jalapenos and it still wasn't that hot.

Delicious as written,, i halved it for boyfriend and myself and he loved it (he does not particularly care for hot food). I disagree with whomever said it wasn't an attractive dish, my dish was baked to perfection !!! i served it with toasted french bread slices... awesome.

This was a hit both times I made it - followed recipe exacatly as is except I added a bit of whole wheat Ritz cracker crumbs to the top along with part of the parmesan cheese. The last few minutes I put the broiler on to brown the top a bit.  Very tasty - asked for the recipe by everyone.

Made for the office on "Fat Friday" and was such a hit I had to email the recipe to the whole branch. I went the extra step of flame roasting 2 Anaheim peppers in place of the canned green chiles but pickled jalepenos are a nust as is mixing together breadcrumbs with the parmesan before toasing it all the oven. Muchas Gracias!

This dip is fabulous....it was a little oily, but I think that was my error in possibly not draining the peppers enough??  Either way, it was still delicious, and everyone at the party I brought it too loved it...I will make this again...thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and added more diced jalapenos.  Served with tortilla chips and the company ate it all up!  4 people ate it all for an appetizer.

yummmmy! i added some sundried tomatoes,green onion, and fire roasted red peppers. i'm always a little skeptical when it comes to heating up mayo based dips but make sure to heat it up as all the flavors come together. wonderful!

Very good!! I followed the recipe as written. I may add some bread crumbs with the grated parmesan the next time I make this. And I do prefer baking this in the oven until slightly golden on top. There is never any of this left.

Very good. I could only find a 12 oz. jar of chopped jalepenos, so I had to eyeball the amount. It turned out pretty spicy, but thats OK-we likey de spicey! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I have already been asked to make it again.

We took this to a barbecue and everybody loved.  I cut back on the Parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup and mixed it in rather than putting it on top.  Definitely a keeper!

I followed the recommendation to spread bread crumbs on top (I used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs), sprayed it with two sprays of Pam Olive Oil and baked it until golden brown.  It gave it the crunch that you get when you eat a real Jalapeno Popper. Everyone raved about it.

This is so good and easy!  I only made 1/4 of the recipe, but used 4 oz can of jalapeños! I put it in the microwave for a minute and then under the broiler with some bread crumbs on top for another minute. Yummy!  My husband and I really enjoyed this one.

This was really greasy stuff... a but too heavy for my taste. I did add a small-diced orange or red bell pepper and I liked the addition of the bread crumb topping.

This was wonderful!!  Had it for some friends over and everyone loved it!  Used the whole can of jalapenos and also mixed in some cheese-used the panko crumbs on top.  Really good dip, a great addition to my appetizers!

This was good.  I don't know if it tasted exactly like a jalapeno popper, but it was definitely tasty.  I took it to a Memorial Day party and it was all gone.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed other's advice and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  I also added onion powder and extra peppers.  Otherwise it would've been too bland.  For the top I crushed up wheat Ritz crackers with the parm cheese and added a little asiago cheese too.  Took it to a gathering and it disappeared!  ruffles go well with it since they have alot of salt.  thanks for the recipe!

I would give this 6 stars if I could.  I took it to a party that had a bunch of fancier appetizers - but this dip was gone way before anything else!

This recipe was very very good!  I made enough to serve 16.

I added a pinch of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons finely chopped sweet onion and doubled the jalapeno peppers.  I used about a 1/4 cup very finely grated monterey jack cheese, topped with breadcrumbs and baked it.  It browned beautifully and tasted wonderful served with warmed tortilla chips.

My only complaint is it didn't last long enough....I'll have to make a bigger batch next time :-)

Very good and simple.  I baked it and added the bread crumbs on top.  I also added more jalepeno peppers than what was called for, everyone loved it.

WOW! This is delicious! Made it for a BBQ and everyone loved it! I couldn't find any chilies so I doubled up on the Jalapenos! Spicy! Was so good that you couldn't help but keep going back for more! Served with chips...didn't put bread crumbs on like others suggested. Will try it was bread to drip next time! Great recipe!

Awesome recipe. Followed it exactly except I baked it for 30 min. at 375 degrees like others had mentioned. No need for bread crumbs. Served best with French bread.

Yum!!! I made this in a pinch. by chance I had all the ingredients on hand and had company coming over in an hour.. This was perfect for something I could whip up with ease and everyone loved the spread on crackers. As an added note I have made this now several times and have eaten on crackers, fried pita chips and my son loves this spread on hamburgers. This one is a keeper in my book.. Thank you for sharing.

This is the easiest, cheapest, best dip EVER! Anyone who gave this less than 5 stars, must not have followed the recipe! I wanted to make this for a party this weekend, but tried it for my family first, they LOVED it. I followed the recipe exactly, but added breadcrumbs on top. All I can say is "YUM"!

This easy-to-make dip was delicous -- everyone at the cookout I brought it to came back for seconds and thirds and ... I couldn't find canned jalapenos, so I diced one jalapeno. It was mildly spicy, so next time I make it I'll use two or three jalapenos for a real kick.

I admit it, I am addicted to this dip and make it once every week or two.  I usually increase the amount of jalapenos and I substitute the mayo with sour cream. It gives it a much better taste and consistency, in my opinion.  I mix the parmesan in with the remaining ingredients and top with bread crumbs prior to baking at 350 for about 30 minutes.  I haven't grown sick of it yet!

Had a birthday party for my son and everyone raved about it and several asked for hte recipe.  I used italian bread crumbs and parmesan on top before baking.  I think it tastes better baked rather than microwaved.  The oven gives it a crunchy brown crust.  Tastes just like the jalapeno poppers! This is a keeper!

this dip is awesome. i have made it about 4 times since the first try, for a variety of crowds, and everyone loves it. make sure not to put more mayo than the recipe calls for (i try to use a bit less). if you overdo it, the dip gets jiggly and the mayo washes out some of the flavor. i've only served it with tortilla chips. i'm interested to try it with bread, but have no complaints on using chips. still super delicious!

Wonderful dip, made it for memorial day and received rave reviews from the family. Made one small adjustment, sauted red onion (1/2 cup) and 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added them to the cream cheese mixture before baking. I also used an entire can of jalepenos and green chilis. This was a huge hit it will be appearing at many more family events!

This is the first recipe I've ever tried from this site.  It was great and gone in minutes.  Especially good right out of the oven with Ritz crackers.  I used real Parm as some others suggested it made a delicious golden crust over the top.  YUM!

I love jalapeno poppers and this dip was very good, but I made the recipe as written with toasted baguettes for a party and it was not the biggest hit, probably not even the top 3.  I would make it again but would try more peppers and breadcrumbs next time as recommended.

I thought this was pretty good, but I made it for a family gathering and everyone LOVED it.  Even the kids talked that yummy dip for a couple of months afterward.

This is fantastic. Used fresh jalapenos (4) instead of canned. Topped with panko. Served with tortilla chips. Rave reviews from party guests!!!

I have made this recipe three times in the last month and it is a hit every time. Everyone always wants a copy of the recipe. I don't change anything but substituting light mayo. YUMMY!!! I serve it cold with celery and hot with either toasted french bread or tortilla chips.

I liked it on tortilla chips, which helped to add a tiny bit more salt. I agree with previous posters who said to use Panko on top.

I couldn't find canned jalapenos so I used 2 fresh, diced. It still was lacking some of the desired spice. Perhaps some of the other modifications would have helped, but all-in-all it just tasted like jalapeno cream cheese.

Thanks for posting a great recipe.  I used the baked method and added some buttered breadcrumbs to the top as others had suggested.  For dipping I used fresh plain bagels cut into dipping sized pieces--the firmness of the bagel was great for dipping.

I took this to a ladies afternoon at the local VFW and it was a hit, described as "to die for".  I made 1-1/2 times the recipe with about 6 oz. chopped jalapenos, then baked it topped with panko crumbs sprayed with cooking spray. DH even said it was really good, and he's told me for 35 years that he does not like Parmesan cheese.  Great recipe.

This was a huge hit with our guests! I used fresh jalapenos instead of canned and I cut the recipe in half. I also used a parmesan, asiago grated cheese blend. Delicious! I served it up with crackers.

I have made this several times using the Parmesan cheese in the container with the green lid, & it was very good!  This time, I read through the reviews & came across one from the original submitter of the recipe to use REAL shredded Parmesan on top.  So, thats what I did this time around, and it was SO MUCH BETTER!  My husband claimed he was full, but kept going back for more.  I had a surplus of fresh jalapenos & banana peppers in my garden, so I used those this time instead of the canned ones, and its even better.  But it also really really good with the canned ones!

Family didn't care for it but the office people loved it.  I think it tastes alot like the poppers.  When I brought the rest home and no one at them - I just added the left over batch with the italian bread crumb topping to spaghetti I was making.  It was great and the family never knew the secret ingredients.

Delicious! Everyone loved it at my party, they said it tasted just like the poppers. And it was all gone way to soon. I did use the whole can of sliced jalapenos, used the Panko crumbs on top and real parmesan. It was totally awesome.

This was DELICIOUS and a total hit w/ my friends! I'm only giving it 4 because I altered it a bit to lighten it up: I used 3/4C light mayo, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, a full 4oz jalapenos, and a cup of freshly grated parm on top and at least a cup of panko that had mixed in melted butter. There was a lot of panko but it was great because every bite had that crunch. Absolutely delicious!

I made this for a couple of get togethers and it was so good!! I used some of the suggestions. I used a 4 oz. can of jalapenos, topped with 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, & baked instead of microwaved. Everyone loved it, they all asked for the recipe!!!! Yum!!!

I thought that this was very good, yet needed a few changes. Like other reviewers, I baked it, and since I didn't have breadcrumbs, I used crushed butter crackers with the parm cheese and oil on top.  I also put cheddar cheese in the cream cheese mix. With these changes it was perfect, but very spicy, so I won't use as many jalapenos next time.

Absolutely addictive! I brought it to a party this weekend and practically everyone there asked for the recipe. Only changes: I added almost 4 oz of the jalepenos instead of 2, topped with bread crumbs as suggested by others, baked it and served it with sliced french bread baguette. Dee-lish!

This was rockin'!  I subbed yogurt for mayo because I can't stomach the stuff.  I also couldn't find canned/jarred chilies at the store (they used to have them, wth?!), so I just left them out.  Since I like spicy things, I upped the jalepenos, but I added too many, LOL, it burned, but I kept eating ...  I added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp each black pepper and garlic powder, used romano both in the mixture and on top.  Was in a big hurry, so I microwaved for a couple minutes then finished in the oven.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Bf seemed to really like this, which was good, as I made it for him.  I halved the recipe since it's only two of us, and I'm not a big jalapeno or dip fan.  I used hot jarred jalapenos and to me it was spicy.  However, I don't normally eat jalapenos so I'm sure my taste for them isn't developed!  I served with some bread cubes I had made and bf's only complaint was that I cubed the bread too small.  We have leftovers, but I'm sure he'll eat them since he ate a good bit on his own with dinner tonight.

Very good! I halved the recipe and just estimated the amounts of peppers to use. I served it with tortilla chips and it was a hit.

Everyone said the spice was just perfect just enough. I made this last weekend then again because I cut the recipe in 1/2 so I had an additional cream cheese. SO I made the dip again and spread it on whole wheat tortillas the added grilled chicken put at top that was spread with the dip and used some kraft mexican cheese and baked them for about 10 minutes and cut then into wedges. WOW You can't go wrong with this one.

-10-12 dashes hot pepper sauce
-used 6 oz parmesan cheese (pregrated..in refrigerator cheese section)...mixed 3/4 bag in dip then rest on top
-used panko breadcrumbs on top
-microwaved and breadcrumbs were fine & good
had several people ask for recipe..an indicator of a great recipe

This is a five star recipe! I made this for my son's birthday party and have had guest asking for the recipe ever since, guest could not get enough of it. I followed the recipe exactly accept for on the advice of one review added the panko bread crumbs on top which I sprayed with butter pan spray and then baked. Thank you for a appetizer I will make again and again!!!

This is one of the best dips I have ever made! I was recently informed by a friend that this was to be "my thing" for bringing to any parties at his place. The first time I made it I did not find it very spicy, but I have since learned that the key to optimal flavor and spice is to make it at least a day in advance a let it sit. It definitely gets hotter with time. I have also made this with sour cream in place of the mayo (because I ran out) and it didn't affect the flavor much.

Soo good and easy.  Exactly like the middle of a popper.  I used low fat cream cheese and mayo., doubled peppers, dash of hot sauce, topped with panko crumbs and the shreaded parm and baked.  Takes like 5 minuts to make - great for when someone stops by since all ingredients are normally in the house!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and everyone loved it.  I put the leftover in the fridge and took it to work the next day.  I heated it back up in the microwave before serving and everyone thought it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great dip recipe.

Good, but rich.  Fiance liked more than me.  My preference would be more jalapenoes and a little creamier.

Big hit at the superbowl party!  The contents are a little scary (Cream cheese and a CUP of mayo) definitely not good if you're on a diet.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I added double the jalapenos.  That barely gave it a kick, so I'm glad I did that.  Next time I make it, I might experiment with low fat mayo and cream cheese...  one or the other

This dip is wonderful!  My very picky teenager even ate some and declared it the best dip she has ever had...she felt it tasted like the inside of fried jalapeno peppers from local restaurants.  As for the rest of my family, this was gone almost as quickly as I removed it from the oven.  Delicous and I will be making this again and again.  The only changes I made (beside cutting the recipe in half) included baking it, topping the top of the dip with bacon and adding a handful of Colby/Montery jack cheese.  I will definately make a whole recipe next time.  This is addicting!

Made it for a party exactly as the recipe stated.  I would change two things.  1st.... I would mix some of the parm in the mixture and not add it all to the top and second I would add more jalapeno's.....I prefer it more hot.  But it was definately a keeper and everyone enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This dip has now become a favorite for me and my husband.  I made it for the Super Bowl and got rave reviews.  I followed the recipe as is but added the Panko breadcrumbs on top.  Very nice touch.  I forgot to mix in a little oil with the breadcrumbs, so I think I'll do that next time.  I toasted and sliced up a French baguette and used that to eat the dip with.  My husband and I both agreed that the bread was much better than using our favorite tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again....yummm.

My husband made this recipe for a super bowl party we went to.  It was awesome!!  Even a picky 8 and 11 year old ate it and loved it.  Keep in mind we kept the "kick" of the jalapeno pepper to a minimun since we knew there would be kids, but it was a winner.  He added bread crumbs with the parm cheese and backed at 350 for 20 minutes.  Will make again for sure, but this time we'll kick up the "bam" factor with more Jalapenos

This stuff is awesome!  If you like poppers, you will love this.  I took it to a superbowl party and of all the cream cheese type dips there it was the most popular.  I used the 4 oz. can of jalapenos and it was really spicy, but when I commented I might make it with less everyone said, "NO!, this is perfect!" Thanks so much for this recipe.  It's really easy and REALLY YUMMY!

This dip is awesome. It's even good cold. I served it with both scoops and bread-most people liked the bread better. I didn't make it too hot, but next time, I will add more jalapenos. I also baked mine so the top got brown. It added look, but it was harder to rewarm that way. Overall, though, awesome!

Wow!  I made this for the appetizer cook-off at a SuperBowl party, and won second place....everyone loved it!  I mixed 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar in with the rest of the ingredients, then topped with 1/2 c cheddar and 1/2 cup parmesan, then 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  Great with toasted french bread!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

YUM YUM YUM.  Had this today and it was out of this world good.  I did double the jalapeno's, next time I will not, just a little to spicy for me.  And I baked it and served it with toasted french bread.  But I am so glad I finally tried it, this is going into my recipe box.  Thansk so much for the keeper.

All I can say is WOW! This is great. We are eating it with blue corn chips. So many things you could do with this. I might even use it to make stuffed jalapenos. Added way more chilis & jalapenos but this is a versatile recipe that you can make to taste. Next time I might even sneak in a few artichoke hearts. It reminds me of hot artichoke dip. YUM!

oh yeah! this was great! I found it when looking for ways to use the never-ending supply of hot peppers that my husband grows. I used a combination of fresh, blanched jalapenos and serrenos (about eight.) and I used half mayo and half sour cream and serve it with Scoops. like most reviewers I enjoy the accolades when i bring it to parties.thanks for the excellant recipe!

This dip is amazing!  I decided to put it as a spread on sourdough bread slices, topped with the parmesean cheese and then broiled for a minute or two.  It's a little bit of extra work but these little bread slices got rave reviews.  Sometimes I also had a handful of shredded cheddar cheese.  I make variations of this dip constantly as everyone begs for it!

This was absolutely delicious!  Tastes exactly like jalapeno poppers!  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added some Planko bread crumbs to my cheese and cooked in the oven.  Made for a wonderful crunchy crust.  Everyone at our Saturday night card game asked for the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really is just like a jalapeno popper.  I added spice with cayenne pepper.  The cheese on top doesn't thrill me - makes it difficult to get to the dip underneath.  But people really like this dip.

A very tasty dip.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Not too spicy, not too mild and super easy to make.  I used fire roasted chiles and they were delicious.  I served the dip with tortilla chips and fritos.

I'm always asked to bring this dip to parties. I pretty much follow the recipe, but now mix the cup of freshly grated Parmesan into the cream cheese mixture, reserving a small amount for the top that I mix with some Italian bread crumbs. I always bake it till edges are just starting to brown.  Add in more green chilies and mild pickled jalapenos for more flavor. The dip still remains delicious once cooled.

This was very good, though I think I would have prefered it more spicey also. Next time I will try more peppers and the cheese on the top, it was not the most attractive dip but tasty!

I made this for New Years Eve and everyone loved it!  I used about 2/3 C Cheddar in place of the Parmesan b/c I didn't have enough Parmesan and the cheddar was great in it.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used 4 oz jalepeno's and that gave it a perfect kick.  I would definitely make this again.

Sorry...we thought this was just okay and we had lots leftover.  I added the whole can of jalapenos + some diced fresh jalapenos and it still never seemed spicy to us.  I stirred the parmesan throughout and added a little bit of cilantro for flavor.  My 17 month old ate a bunch of it and we have snacked on it but probably won't make it again.

I had really high hopes for this, but it turned out just ok.  I did up the jalepenos and baked it and used bread crumbs on top, but it just wasn't anything special at all.  Sorry!

Holy Smokes this was good.  Since we couldn't decide what to have on New Year's this year, my husband and I decided to just make two appetizers to pick at throughout the evening and WOW was this everything it promised to be.  I can't wait to have friend over and surprise them with this one!

This recipe is exceptional. I have shared it with several people and they've all made it multiple times. It's so refreshing to find a new recipe that really knocks your socks off! I've always made it in the oven and tried various cheeses for toppings. Nothing is better than fresh parmesean though.

Excellent recipe !!!!

This went over well at a recent party I brought it to.  I used a 4 oz can of jalapenos, sprinkled with shredded parmesan, topped with sliced jalapenos, then baked until bubbly.  Soooo good and really easy!

This IS as good as all the reviews! I put jalapeno rings on the top to make it more eye-appealing and broiled it to brown the top. Next time though I would add more chopped jalapenos to the dip as others suggested. Everyone asked for the recipe!

Very Good! I made this for Christmas and the family enjoyed it! I accidently grabbed mild jalapenos which made the other ingredients over power the jalapeno & green chilies taste, so next time I will get the hot.
Again, Very Good, Thank You!

LOVED it! Made it for a party, and it was a hit. If you know your audience, you could probably use more jalepenos to give it even more kick!

If you love poppers, you will LOVE this recipe. I forgot to add the parmesean and it was still yummy.  I took it to any appetizer / ornament exchange party and it was a hit.  I alomst felt guilty because it was so easy to make.  Everyone took home the recipe. A keeper.

Overall an easy and yummy recipe.  It did not give off the flavor and hotness that I had hoped for.  Will try again with some of the suggestions others have posted.

I was hoping this would be exceptional, since I love mexican junk food,  but it was only OK.   I used sour cream to replace the mayo, added more jalapenos (maybe a few too many)  and less parm then called for.   Wouldn't make it again.

This was incredible! And so easy. I followed the other suggestions and added bread crumbs with the parmesan. The bowl was licked clean. I served it with Frito's Scoops! Delicious!

Great idea - thanks for sharing! I followed the general idea of this recipe, but changed parts of it to suit what ingredients I had on hand. I made a smaller batch using about 6oz reduced fat plain cream cheese, 2oz spinach cream cheese, 1/4c white american cheese (cubed), 1/4c mayo, and two fresh jalapeños (cleaned and diced.) I put the mixture in an oven-safe baking dish, topped it with grated Parmesan and a thin layer of breadcrumbs and baked it until hot and bubbly. Still tasted good, like jalapeño poppers, but it could have used more jalapeño. Next time I will try it using the canned chilies and maybe some cheddar cheese.

Let me start out by saying I LOVE jalapeño poppers!!  I did like this spread.  I only used about 3/4 of 1 can of jalapeños and thought that was the right temp for us, spicy but not 'knock your socks off I can't eat another bite without some water' spicy.  I do recommend to mix in some cheddar cheese with the spread instead of on top for a more realistic jalapeño popper taste.  I also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top and sprayed with butter.  I ABSOLUTELY recommend warming up this dish in the oven!  Also, I think next time I make this I will add 2 cans of chili's and only 1 can of jalapeños.  We served with scoop tortilla chips and that was good, but I'm sure there is a better "dipper" for this recipe....Thanks!!

This dip was delicious and got rave reviews by everyone at the party where I served it.  I tend to like things spicy, so I used close to 4 oz. of the canned jalepenos, rather than the 2 oz. that this recipe called for.  I mixed the ingredients with a hand mixer, which was easy and made it fluffy.  I used about half the amount of parmesan that was called for, and I sprinkled the top with some chopped fresh jalepenos.  I baked in the oven until it was hot through, and then turned on the broiler for just a minute or two to brown the top.  It was wonderful!  Will definitely make again.

I have been looking for something new to serve at parties and this is IT!  I used the suggested 2 oz and thought that it could use some more.  If your group likes it hot, go for 4 oz.  Served with the sccop corn chips and it was a huge hit.  I will make this time and time again.

This was an excellent make ahead dish.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add more jalapenos because I love things HOT!  Great recipe.......thanks.

This is so delicious!  What a good recipe, I only made a couple of changes; I used all jalapenos and substituted part of the mayo for sour cream.  It was divine.  I have a little left over and I think I will use it to stuff a couple of chicken breasts.  These should be even better than the spinach/blue cheese kind.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Awsome!  I liked using fresh jalapenos in it for a spicier kick but this is always a hit and the plate is always the first one empty.

In a word... WOW!!!  I have been making this for parties for the last few weeks.. A HUGE HIT!!  I added a dash of garlic powder, white pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  This is my fiancee's fav!!
