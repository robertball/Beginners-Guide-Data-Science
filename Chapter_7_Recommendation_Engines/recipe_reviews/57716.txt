My family is chinese and owned a chinese restaurant and this is a certifiable great recipe! I make this all the time. I especially like the shrimp marinated in sherry and corn starch. Gives it a great flavor. Just as good as something my dad would make. Thanks for the recipe!

I'd love to try this recipe with LOBSTER PASTE!

(see: SUBMITTED BY: Victor 
Good Flavor. Lobster Paste does add a bit more flavor.)

Can anyone (Victor?)tell me where I can buy a can of lobster paste?  Tried all over but can only find case quantities on the net...

This was just great. A forever keeper.  It was easy to prepare and quick.  My husband and I tried it and loved it.  Can't wait for more family members to visit so I can serve it to them.  Also, for more flavor, I used canned chicken stock instead of plain water.  Much better taste.

Wonderful Recipe - better than my local Chinese food restaurants!

I made the following changes which made it even better:
1. Dissolved a beef bouillon cube to the cup of water in the sauce.
2. Used 1/3 lbs. ground veal instead of ground pork.
3. Added more cornstarch at the end to make it a bit thicker.

This is an amazingly easy and delicious recipe. I highly recommend it! Note: I added a bit of green onion during cooking (finely chopped). It added a great layer of flavor.

We followed the recipe but perhaps because we have no idea what Cantonese food is like, were disappointed.  It does look like the picture so there is no appetizing color to the dish.  I love lobster and if there was to be a taste like that, to me I missed it.  Over all bland and no special wow for us.

Very good! my picky husband loved it, said it tasted just as good as any Cantonese Restaurant.  I added peas for some color and subtle sweetness and doubled the liquid ingredients as previously suggested by others.  This is a keeper!

I make this recipe all the time - it's my favorite!!! I've learned that if you want it to look more, cook the egg in a separate pan and add in to the sauce when it's done. It's not so gray and bland looking.

This is just like eating at a Cantonese Chinese restaurant.  I never thought I could make my favorite Chinese meal at home.  Easy to make.  I doubled the ingredients, as previously mentioned. The texture of the shrimp was perfect.  Served with fried rice for the complete meal.  Drizzling the beaten egg in the simmering mixture at the end tops it off for 5 stars!  Excellent dish!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I’ve made it twice.  The first time I substituted Seafood Stock for the water and used Harvey’s Bristol Creme.  It was awesome, tasted just like or local Chinese restaurant.  The second time I made the recipe exactly like it was written (didn’t do any substitutes), but I doubled it because the first time we didn’t have enough.  It wasn’t as good the 2nd time.  I think the Seafood Stock added a lot of flavor.  I will definitely use the stock in the future.

I am a very picky Chinese food eater as I have been eating good chinese food for years.  This is not something you would find at one of those super buffets.  It's an exceent dish that i have been eating since I was young.  That being said,this recipe was EXCELLENT!  It's very similar to restaurant quality.  Great!

I made this tonight, tastes just like P.F. Chang's! I loved it and will make it again and again. I would be proud to serve this to guests. (I didn't have any pork, so I just made the recipe without it. It was great!)

this is very good...i turned out a little greasy for me but i think that is my own fault for not adding the beaten egg to the sauce at the end...i did add a few tablespoons of sweet red pepper for color (and i have them coming out of my ears in august)...also some fresh ginger and flat parsley...i served lo mein and enjoyed it very much

Oh man!  This recipe SO GOOD!!!  And, very authentic! The only thing I did different was that I added some about a tablespoon of black bean paste. It reminds me childhood when my Dad would bring my brother and I to this one Chinese restaurant when we were living in Los Angeles.  You know? The kind of Chinese joint where they have their Peking ducks hung in the window...And, they served their Shrimp w/ Lobster Sauce with black bean sauce (not too much, it's very strong).  I never knew it was so easy!  Thanks for bringing one of my favorite dishes from a restaurant I can no longer go to into my kitchen:)

Like others suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients.  Wonderful recipe; the shrimp were perfectly tender, with the delicate coating created by the sherry/cornstarch combination.  Since the pork was also doubled, we even had shrimp left over and it didn't toughen up with reheating, was just as good the next day for lunch.  If you like shrimp with lobster sauce from a restaurant, here is your chance to have it at home whenever you want!  Very, very good!

I'm super picky about my shrimp with lobster sauce, so I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, having never attempted to recreate my favorite Chinese dish, but I am so glad I did!  The only changes I made was I halved the shrimp and added water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and a chicken bouillon cube per other reviewers recommendations.  It just really needs some sort of veggie, so pick your favorites and add plenty of them since there is enough sauce to go around.

Really good recipe, but I have thought the best Shrimp with Lobster Sauce have the fermented black beans added (should have at any Asian store).  Just soak a handful and throw them in when browning the pork and garlic.  I added these and this recipe is spectacular!

We are from back east and have lived out west for 6 years, I have searched every place for this meal (my husbands favorite) with no success until now. THIS IS IT!!!! I made this for his birthday dinner, he was thrilled and loved it, now I have to make it at least once a month. It is wonderful!!!!!

I doubled the 1 cup of water, sugar, cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of cold water. Added 1 chicken and 1 beef bullion cube with an extra 1/2 cup of water. Was much closer to the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce I have at my local Chinese restaurant.

I made this for my moms bday and everyone loved it.  Very easy and uncomplicated.  I used regular sherry instead of cooking, and I did add some green onions at the end of cooking, as some of the reviews suggested.

This has always been my favorite to order at Chinese restaurants and I was pleasantly surprised how much this tasted like take-out!  I never knew that ground pork was the "lobster" in the lobster sauce!  Thank you!

First of all, this recipe does NOT need all this oil. I made it with half the oil and there was still plenty. Enough to be greasy.  It was ok but I had to add seasoning to the end because it was bland. Overall, not something I would bother with again although it was ok enough to eat. Too expensive, too much trouble (and I love to cookand was looking forwar to this all day) and didn't tast more than just ok.

I love this!  You don't need a passel of ingredients to make it and its delicious.  I Basically double all ingredients and make double batches because the family just eats it up.  I sub low sodium chicken stock for the water as suggested by another reviewer.

Awesome recipe. As good as any I've had in any restaurant, and I've had it in many "authentic" places. I added a little green onion and a few water chestnuts. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. I can now cross this one off of my bucket list

Very good recipe. I dont always have ground pork on hand, but its still good without it. As other reviewers, I substituted chicken broth for the water and sprinkled a few stalks of chopped green onions at the end. Very short prep time as well, especially if you buy e-z peel shrimp. Great for weeknight dinners.

Not bad. Didn't use as much oil as called for and subbed ground beef for the pork.  Omitted the salt, as soy sauce has enough!  Also added some frozen veggies.  Not a very strong flavor, but something kept me going back for more...

It was great!  Used to make it many years ago, and had lost my recipe and this one tastes how I remember.  I did add a little chili oil when cooking the shrimp for a little spice.

We had this at a fine Chinese restaurant months ago and I raved about it. My daughter found the recipe here and she used all pork this time.  Last time she used 50/50 beef and pork. She said if she has green onions she throws them in at the end. We had the opportunity to compare the restaurants version and hers. Hers (this recipe) is better. She said it's easy to make and of course, a lot cheaper as well. GREAT DISH!

This is a great recipe. I followed it to the letter only adding scallions and peas. The end result was that of a sit down Cantonese Chinese restaurant rather than a cheap, Fast- food styrofoam container meal. Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this again and again.

I made this recipe for the second time, but now modified some of the ingredients. Instead of using water, I used low sodium chicken stock.  It came out ten times better than my local Chinese restaurant without the monosodium glutamate.   Wow, and how easy..I will make this often!!

Loved this recipe.  It has become a standard now; even when I cut it to 2 portions.  Served over white rice, it is 'authentic'.  -tara

This was great. I made it to the recipe the first time and my husband loved it. Next time after he sugguested a couple of tablespoons of Oyster sauce, he raved about it.

Picky Hubby gave it a four star!  That's a five to me!!  Did use more liquids with chicken stock but less soy sauce as the color should not be too dark.  Thanks for the recipe!

Lots of prep but once prep is done, everything goes quickly. Have made several times with no changes. Better than most Chinese restaurants.

This is pretty good, but I added MSG (I can't help it--I'm an MSG nut) and also fermented black beans.  My father learned his trade in the big Chinatown restaurants in DC years ago, and you gotta have those fermented black beans.

I did not care for this recipe, and  I measured everything exactly to the "T". The shrimp mixed w/the cornstarch and Sherry is great, but it goes down from there. Way too salty!

This is a great recipe. I altered a little though. I took the suggetion of a couple of the other reviews and used Chicken broth instead of water and it came out more soupy which is what i wanted. I used 2 lbs of shrimp b/c that's what i had and I sauteed 1/2 container of onion, green onion mix, added 1/2 chopped bellpepper and garlicthen added the shrimp when this was 1/2 way done. I kept all the other ingredients except I eliminated the pork and sugar.

This was good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was nervous making this because I don't usually cook with shrimp and I was a bit intimidated trying to cook chinese for my husband (he grew up in San Francisco-which has the best chinese food!), but he enjoyed it and would like to have it again.  I am not a big shrimp fan, but I enjoyed this. I will be making this again.

This was good but not great.  If you add in the time to peel and devein the shrimp, the prep time goes up quite a bit.

This was really good, I didn't have ground pork, but I did add snowpeas, bok choy, and cabbage. It needed a tiny bit more flavor, but it tasted pretty close to a Chinese resturant.

My wife is allergic to fish and shell fish, so I replaced the shrimp with chicken. With the ground pork and the yummy sauce, it really took care of my craving for Chinese take-out.

Loved it. It tasted just as good as any Chinese restaurant. I added fermented black beans and would cut out the salt as the soy and black beans are salty enough.

Absolutely delicious! I did up the amount of ground pork just a bit and my husband added red pepper flakes to his dish because he likes quite a bit of heat. Will definitely put this in the regular dinner rotation.

I didn't have pork on hand, and I had 1.5lb of shrimp. I still doubled the sauce recipe and its was the PERFECT amount. It was delicious! I served it over rice with the garlic roasted broccoli and lemon recipe on this site. Next time I'll add some mushrooms and peas, it'll be just like PFchangs :)

This is an easy, and simple recipe, that produces a Chinese Restaurant worthy lobster sauce. I personally add more garlic, and use a drizzle of molasses in lieu of the sugar. I find the molasses provies a deeper taste, and color !

I would add scallions and ginger. I made it with sesame oil and added snow peas to  add some color. Next time, I'll probably add a little more vegetables at an earlier cooking stage (probably around the time I am stir frying the shrimp.)

The family loved this!  DH brought home a pound of ground pork so I decided to quadruple the recipe (we like a lot of sauce!)

Swapped out shrimp for two bricks of tofu, and added some pea pods, straw mushrooms and finely sliced napa cabbage for color and veggies.  Served over steamed broccoli instead of rice.  Used chicken stock in place of the water and didn't add the salt (figured between the stock and soy sauce it would be plenty seasoned).  It was better than what we get a the local Chinese restaurant.  

Wish I found this years ago, will definitely become part of the normal meal rotation.

This dish is supposed to have fermented black beans.  I used very little oil and increased water to 2 cups.  Added about 1 tbs of fermented black beans (rinsed and chopped) and stir-fried with the pork.  Also used 2 eggs instead of one because my family likes  extra egg.  Beat the eggs and drizzled into the pan at the end.  Waited a sec for the egg drizzle to set then stirred slightly.  Added chopped green onions and served over hot rice.

Great recipe. I used a little less oil. I used low fat ground pork and  added some frozen peas at the very end, after adding the egg. The peas are a great addition.

I have made this over and over again.  If you want it the true Cantonese way omit the soy sauce as this makes it bitter.  I usually double the sauce as that is my favorite part.  sometimes I'll use sesame oil which gives a nice subtle flavor to the already amazing dish.  It's been my mom's favorite dish to order since she was little.  Now s g email won't order it instead she has me make it.

This recipe is excellent. It really deserves a 5 star rating. The only thing I do different is double the recipe because everyone loved it so much.

Thanks to other reviewers my dish turned out heavenly.  I added peas and minced waterchestnuts, as well as beef bouillion.  I didn't have any sherry but used white wine like PF Changs does.  I also didn't have any pork but it still came out well with just Shrimp.  I will definitely have to find that Lobster Bouillion that someone recommended.  Even my picky two year old ate it, I definitely will be adding this to our menu rotation!

I am so disappointed in this recipe I registered just to be able to comment.

I followed the recipe exactly. Only the shrimp came out edible. There is far too much cornstarch and far too little flavor in this recipe. It is nothing like the shrimp in lobster sauce I have ordered in restaurants, and I order it a lot in many different cities. The cornstarch also makes it very messy to cook.  The sauce should be off-whitish, this one is the color of mud and has a similar consistency.

This was surprisingly good.  I did not have any gr.pork and omitted it, as others did.  Instead, I added broccoli, carrots, onions and doubled the soy sauce mixture. Not the greatest Asian shrimp dish, but I would probably make it again. I even got my 4 1/2 yr old whose extremely pick to eat some. Served over steamed rice.

I have to put four stars because I changed it a bit. I added onion with the garlic and omitted the ground pork. It was GREAT. Hubby and kids also loved it!

Great recipe.  Next time, I'm going to omit the pork and I also added capers.  The recipe that way matches one of my husband's favorites from a restaurant we used to go to as newlyweds!!  Thanks for the great recipe.
