Really a nice fresh-tasting salad and nice to look at too with the variety of colors.  I found it a little bland so added about 1 teaspoon of ranch dressing mix.  That did it!  Really great taste and good for you too!  What more could you ask for?  Will definitely make often, especially when the garden squash and zucchini are about to take over!

Great way to use all the summer veggies.  I choped my veggies into small pieces, but not small enought.  I recommend that you target 5mm cubes

This salad goes into my recipe box. The only alteration that I did was to use one teaspoon of ranch salad dressing mix. Thanks for the great recipe.

I like the idea of this, but I'm not so certain I'm sold on it.  The salad is pretty bland, and that's after I added the salt and pepper and tossed in some Old Bay for good measure.  While I like the crunch, I'm not convinced I like squash uncooked this way.  It was, however, a nice idea and I'm glad I tried it.  I'd just need to do some reworking in order to make this again.  thanks for the recipe!

Somehow this went south (maybe moisture from the veggies made dressing weirdly watery)
