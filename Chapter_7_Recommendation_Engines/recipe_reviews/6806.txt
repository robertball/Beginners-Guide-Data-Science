I use this recipe all of the time.  (The only change I make to the dough portion is that I add some "Italian" seasonings- oregano, garlic powder, and pepper) I make 1 and 1/2 of the recipe, split the dough into 8 pieces, and then flatten and stretch it into small pizza shapes.  Then, I put the stuffing in (NO PIZZA SAUCE) and pull all of the sides up and seal all of the toppings inside.  (we use motz. and pepperoni for my kids and husband, and I love sauted onions and garlic with motz. and cheddar cheese for my toppings!) I bake  them for 20-30 minutes, and then we use pizza sauce to dip them in.  

My kids would rather have these than delivery pizza!  It is their favorite meal!

I admit it, I cheat on these and use store bought cans of pizza dough. One can of dough makes two very large calzones. Then I fill them with the sauce, pepperoni, veggies, salami, cheese, etc. fold over and crimp, brush with melted butter. My family adore these! One thing that I have learned: make sure to buy quality meats, the more quality the less grease that runs off. I always have marinara sauce on the side for dipping. My teenage boys and hubby go gaga over these!

Oh My Gosh!  This was the bomb at our house. I made the dough and fixings and everyone filled their own to bake.  I cut the dough into 6x6" pieces and formed them like "hot pockets".  Still munching on leftovers (it makes alot for four) 3 days later!  My husband and I fought over the last 1/2. I made the dough ahead & folded it in thirds and refridgerated it while fixing the rest.  Pulled it out, puched it down, rolled to final size, sliced, filled, sealed and baked as directed.  I also added 1 xtra Tbls. sugar and a 2 second count of olive oil to the dough, and did not do this in a bread machine. Very versatile dough! Outstanding!  Easy! Thanks for submitting this recipe!*Also, baking on parchment paper keeps it from sticking, over browning, and makes clean up easy.

Very, very good!!  I, too, made the dough w/o a bread machine.  I let it rise for about 30 mins.  The dough turned out wonderfully, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  I sprinkled garlic powder and basil after brushing with butter to add some seasoning and color.  Excellent!!

My family loved these. I only used the dough recipe though and then I added a mixture of ricotta, mozzerella, an egg, chopped spinich, mushrooms, and tomato to fill it. I served it with a side of homemade pasta sauce. My husband LOVED it. I am going to make it again this week. It will definately be a regular in our house.

So easy and so great!  Even made the dough by hand since I do not own a bread machine.  I added some oregano, garlic salt and parsley flakes to the dough and it turned out great.  Sauted some onion and garlic to add to the pizza sauce and stuffed with veggies instead of meat.  Came out very tasty and smelled delicious!  Thanks!

I use the bread and fill it with everything.  Basically you are making your own Hot Pockets, just choose a filling, add cheese, and a sauce if you choose, BBQ is great.  Then bake.  I make 6 (small) portions for individual size calzones.  4 would be a generous size.  This is really easy. Love it.

This is our "guests are coming" recipe.  Instead of ordering pizza we serve this instead.  It looks beautiful, and smells wonderful cooking.  Guests will think you're a chef!  I'm almost embarassed to say how many times we've had this in the past month!  I make the crust in the bread machine.  We've tried many stuffings, but pepperoni and extra cheese is our favorite.  We like 1 large one better than 2 smaller ones.

The first time I made this the dough turned out way too soft and I ended up adding more flour, but my husband REALLY loved the end results, so I made it again, and it turned out fine.  I used pepperoni, onions, green peppers, mozzerella and ricotta cheese for the filling, and can't wait to try it with ham and pineapple!

When I served this to my husband, he told me "This is the best calzone I've ever had!  If we were at a restaurant, I'd say we have to come back here!"  I split the dough in half, so that we could each have our own and I could use different fillings.  Because I didn't want extra work, I didn't cut the dough and lace it as described.  I folded it in half, as I have seen done, and folded over the edges, as though it were a pie.  I cut 3 slits on top of each and brushed the top with butter and sprinkled it with garlic powder, oregano and basil.  It was absolutely delicious!  So good, in fact, that I had to make it a second time a couple of days later!

We liked this. The dough was very good. For my filling, I used 1/2 C ricotta instead of tomato sauce (real calzones don't have tomato sauce in them, you are supposed to dip it in the sauce that is on the side). 1 1/2 C. mozzarella, 1/2 C Italian sausage, & 1/2 C broccoli. I added 1/8 t each of oregano, parsley, garlic powder & pepper but will prob make more next time. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was great. My husband and I both agreed this was the best homemade calzone crust we've eaten! This one definitely goes into my recipe box. NOTE: I have now made this with both all-purpose flour by itself and all-purpose flour with gluten added (to simulate bread flour). I prefer it with just all-purpose flour. It makes for a pizza-ier crust.

Thanks for the easy dough recipe. My picky stepson loves calzones. Tonight i'm going to try stuffing with cheese only and brushing with garlic butter and parmesson cheese and cut into bread stick sizes.

This was an awesome dish!!! It was worth more then the 5 stars I gave it.  The ONLY problem that I came to was the fact that even though this recipe was basically for a bread machine; the yeast that was mentioned in the recipe was not bread machine yeast.   The recommended amount for active dry yeast is different then bread machine yeast in any bread maker that I have ever used.  I was just really surprised that NO ONE (that I saw anyway) mentioned the conversion.  I hate fractions with a passion so, I will help the next cook who only has bread machine yeast and not active dry, on hand.    Recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast.... use 1 1/3 teaspoons of bread machine yeast and it will come out PERFECT! If you don't have a 1/3 teaspoon, just use a heaping 1/4 teaspoon and you will be good to go.    Another poster mentioned that the calzone was doughy.  If you follow the recipe exactly, (you may need to add a little extra flour, I did) then you will NOT be disappointed.   We stuffed ours with pepperoni and onions and it was out of this world.  After I put it in the oven and it began to bake, I brushed melted butter onto it and sprinkled dry basil, garlic powder and black pepper on it.  (Another poster mentioned she added herbs to the dough but didn't really taste them.  We tasted ours but it was not over powering, just the right amount.  This was by far the best calzone I ever had and I will make many more times in the future.

Found that I would rather make a pizza, these recipe was more of a hassle plus there is too much 'crust' for my likes.

I use this dough for EVERYTHING!  It's so versatile.  Like other reviewers I do NOT use a bread machine.  I proof the yeast for about 10-15 minutes, mix everything else in, and let rise about 30-45 minutes.

Some of our favorite fillings are - 
Shredded chicken, BBQ sauce, and cheese.
Taco meat, refried beans, cheese, salsa and olives
Diced Chicken, Chipotle Sauce, bacon, cheese

Just to name a few...

Amazing. It's so simple to make yet tastes absolutely wonderful. The second time, I brushed top with olive oil and sprinkled with coarse sea salt. I also added garlic powder and oregano to the dough. Will be a family favourite!

I used this dough to make four generous calzones in the traditional semi-circle shape. Each was completely devoured! Go light on the pizza sauce (or leave it out and just use some for dipping) or it will tend to squish out the sides when you seal the dough. I used a variety of fillings according the to taste of the person who would be eating the calzone (mine was ham, genoa salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, pepper rings, and cheese.  Delicious combo!) I cut three 1" vents in the top of the calzone before baking, plus I used the melted butter, a light sprinkling of pizza seasoning herbs, and a light sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan.  Very good!  I baked them the same way I bake pizza--on a pizza stone in a 450 degree over for 15 minutes.  They were beautifully done, golden brown and not too doughy.

This recipe was delicious.  I cut the dough into 4 pieces and filled it with cheddar cheese, parm cheese and ground beef.  I added italian seasoning to the mixture to give it more flavor.  I didnt have dry milk so I used 1/2t of 1% milk.  I will definetely make this again.

This makes a great calzone! After rolling the dough out, I put the filling down the center as called for in the recipe then I folded the short ends in about an inch and brought the long ends to meet in the center and folded them together to seal. Then I made several slits on either side of the center to vent. This seemed easier than criss-crossing and it turned out beautiful.In fact my family liked it so well that I had to make a second one for later!

seriously the best dough ever.  We have made it twice now in a week, once for calzones and once for pizza.  Just add your own ingredients.

This made great calzones.  I decided to make two calzones out of this, and it has enough dough that it makes two extra large ones.  I could tell while rolling them out, that this dough was very airy and light.  The end result was great and gave a nice chewy texture to the calzones.  I made sure to put a few vent holes in the calzones and they took about 30-35 minutes to cook on a pizza stone.  I also brushed them with garlic butter and sprinkled with italian seasonings.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I am giving this 5 Stars, but I did make some beginner mistakes so I thought I would list my mistakes to help others.  First, I follow recipes exactly and think it would have been great. But...  I told the hubby what I was putting on it and he said great. Rolled out the dough, put on the sauce, cheeze, pepperoni, olives.  Then, he says, hey I want sauteed mushrooms!  So, sauteed mushrooms are prepared and added to the prepared calzone.  But wait, we are not done, now he wants bacon.  So bacon is added. Now, the sauce has run and needs to be dabbed up with paper towels and the dough has risen.  So I wrapped and baked.  It turned out good, but much larged then any calzone I have every seen.  LOL!  I am still giving it 5 stars though.  Will definately make again, will just make sure "ALL" ingrediants are ready before assembly and once assembly begins, no additions allowed!

Excellent recipe! My husband made sure that I saved it to my recipe box to make it again. I did roll it up like a jelly roll instead of traditional calzone style and it made for a perfect bite each time!

Excellent! I was looking for a new calzone dough recipe & this was perfect ~ much better than the one I had been using.  I didn't criss cross the dough ~ just folded it over ~ & it turned out just fine.  Also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top after brushing with butter.  Delicious!

We use this recipe about once every two weeks.  It is a great recipe and I never had to add any flour or water - it always turns out perfect.  I don't ever keep milk powder so I just replace some of the water with a little milk.  A full recipe easily serves a family of four.  Everyone can make their own calzone and put in it what they like.

Fantastic! I followed others suggestions. I added Italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion salt and granulated garlic to the dough with garlic and Italian sprinkled on top of the butter. Used one less T. of water. When the dough was done, I put it in a bowl in the fridge for 3 hours while I was gone. We are not fans of pepperoni and so I didn't have any. I made a sloppy joe filling. Rolled dough out as stated and cut it into 4ths. Put a heaping 1/2 cup on each plus cheese, then folded over and under like pie crust and used a fork to seal. Let rest on the stove for 15 minutes. These bake bigger so next time I will cut it into 6 pieces. My dh said "don't make them any other way!" Oh but the ideas are endless. I LOVED the dough, can't wait to dip it in spaghetti sauce. Thank you!

Very yummy recipe, very user friendly for me who is a very inexperienced cook.  I used a bread machine and it came out perfect.  I would divide into a minimum of 3 portions.  I made 1 and it was the size of a loaf of bread.  I have a convection oven and 35 minutes was too long at 350.  Next time I would limit to 28 minutes.  Crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside.
thanks for sharing!!

i just made this an hour ago and it turned out pretty great! my changes: >made the dough by hand >used all purpose flour coz i didn't have bread flour >did not use any milk >added 6 tsp extra virgin olive oil, & 2 Tbsp oregano  >let it rise for about 40-50 mins(i forgot it lol) >added about 2 Tbsp of flour after i discovered i forgot it lol >divided into 6 little balls, tried making a rectangular form instead of a circle. >after closing, i brushed with generous melted butter, sprinkled with garlic powder, & oregano, then a lil parmesan(too much will get too salty)  my filling: >sauteed 5 cherry tomatoes, 1/4 red onion, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1-2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp honey,  sliced vienna sausages(2 small cans) in 1 cup left over spaghetti sauce  **added mozarella and cubed sharp cheddar cheese on top of the filling before closing it  note: the 3 cups of four yielded 6 huge servings of about 7" each

One classic error here is the cooking temperature and time.  As with any pizza style food, it must be cooked at a VERY HIGH TEMP FOR A SHORT TIME.  This recipe produces a dough that tastes undercooked and is mushy in the middle.  It is far preferable to cook the calzone at a bake temp of 500 F for 20 minutes.  The dough will be golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  And don't worry, the contents will be plenty cooked.  Also, use only a little sauce inside.  It cooks far better the drier it is.  You can always heat some sauce and serve it on the side or drizzled over top.

The calzone turned out very nice. The dough was perfect, easy to work with.
The kids loved it (13-19 year olds).
I made two calzones for five people, had half of one left over.

I love this recipe!  I used part whole wheat flour and made the dough in my bread machine.  I rolled the crust thin, did not mess with the lacing this time, added some spices on the top and served the sauce on the side, as many suggested.     It was perfect and I will make it regularly.  I used mozzarella with home made cottage cheese (less fat and salt and no preservatives) and added onions, garlic and green peppers, no meat.  I split the dough into 5 pieces, made 2 small calzones and  one small pizza and froze the other two.  Loved the thin crust pizza, as well as the calzones.  The frozen dough is just as good as the fresh.  Can't wait to try different combinations!  Thank you for the awesome recipe and all the helpful comments.

Delicious.  The dough was very easy to work with, and the top looked like it was braided after baking.  The filling could be anything you desire, but I followed with the recipe and used pepperoni (turkey) and cheese.  Kids and husband were huge fans of this for dinner, and we are already planning on having it again for Halloween.

I used this recipe as a base for a new calzone recipe I was creating- the fact that the calzone dough was made in a bread machine really saved me a lot of time, which I appreciated. My rating is for the dough only, as I added my own filling. Turned out super yummy! Thank you for this recipe- it's a keeper in my recipe box!

I loved this!  Pop it in the bread machine, and go do other things!  My two finicky little girls loved this.  Just a few minor changes/additions: I needed a BIT more flour, and my husband and I added some ricotta cheese, provelone slices, and thinly sliced ham. I think next time, I'll add some sauteed veggies like onion and peppers!  Great Job, D!

Wow, Amazing recipe!  My family loves this better than any pizza plaze.  I did make one change with the dough, instead of powdered milk and water the recipe calls for,  I used 1 Cup water and 1/4 Cup of skim milk.  Then filled with our favorites, leaving the sauce on the side

This was realley Good! I took out 2/3 cup white flour and replaced it with wheat flour. I also added Italian herbs and spices to the dough. I made the dough in the bread machine then divided it I only maked 1/4 of the dough the rest went to the freezer. I rolled it realley thin and filled it then baked it on my pizza stone. It was readey in 15-20 min.  I put cornmeal on the stone to keep it from sticking and it worked accept where the sauce came out on one side it stuck a little. Will use this one again!

I have been making a version of this for years.  I thought I had made it up in my head!  I don't go to all the trouble of the bread flour.  I just use crescent rolls and use a rolling pin and did two per can.  Always turned out super.

Yum!  Made the dough in the bread machine and split it into two calzones; one with mozzarella and pepperoni the other with spinach, mushroom and mozzarella.  I popped the veggies in the micro for 1 minute to soften them up.  Delicious.

This was a great dough recipe.  The only thing I did different was I added some garlic powder and itallian seasoning to the dough.  We made personal size calzones so everyone could fill it with their favorites.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious dough! The only thing I didn't have was dry milk powder, but luckily a neighbor had a tsp I could use:) I too made the dough by hand, and added Italian seasoning before rolling it out. Then I made individual hot-pocket type calzones and filled them with sausage, sauteed green pepper, garlic and onion, pepperoni, mozerella cheese and sliced black olives. Right before I took them out of the oven, I sprinkled on some mozerella cheese and a little more Italian seasoning, so that it melted on top. Loved the crust when it came out...crispy but soft on the inside. I dipped in marinara sauce. Next time I'm going to try a spinach and ricotta combination. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Tasted just like a pizza pop! I added mushrooms and redbell pepper. Also I brushed with melted butter on top cause I like the salty taste.

My husband raved out these calzones. I used a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment instead of a bread machine. I allowed the dough to rise in a warm oven and then rolled out the dough. I also added some dried basil, oregano, and a pinch of garlic powder to the dough. I made two large rectangular calzones and had left over dough. I sealed the dough and froze it for future use. In the calzone I added some ricotta cheese to the mix. Its a versatile dough so you could be creative with the filling. My husband requests that we have these again soon. Thanks for the recipe.

I think this is a pretty decent recipe, and I will most definitely make it again. That being said, I did make some changes to the recipe: I let the dough rest for 30 min. after it came out of the bread machine because it was too elastic to roll out right away. I also folded in some garlic powder, salt, and crumbled Italian herbs into the dough before I rolled it out. I put garlic powder into the melted butter that I brushed on top, and I sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top of that. I thought the calzone was just a touch too bready, so next time I will discard about a third of the dough before rolling it out to make the ratio more to my liking. This is a fun recipe to play with!
EDITED TO ADD: I decided that I didn't want to throw out the extra dough, so I ended up splitting the dough in half to make 2 separate calzones for us all. Worked out beautifully and eliminated the waste!

It is a little difficult to eat due to the toughness of the bread but it was good.  I am glad I sprinkled the bread with garlic powder before baking because the bread wouldn't have had any flavor otherwise.  It was much easier to eat reheated the next day when the bread was a little softer.

Made this for dinner lastnight and it was all gone by the morning. I made one with sauteed onions and leftover chunks of cooked chicken breasts and moz. cheese. The other one I made with hot calabrese, hot capocollo, pepper salame, and mozz. cheese. I also added pizza seasoning I made and store in a bottle (oregano, basil,onion flakes, garlic pwdr,thyme, blk pepper, and salt) to the dough. I took a few of the pointers of brushing the dough with the garlic butter and it was very yummy! Kids like to dip theres in marinara or pizza sauce.

This is an awesome recipe! The only changes I made was to add pizza seasonings to the dough and it turned out great! Make sure you roll the crust out thin otherwise it will be VERY thick when it is finished cooking.

My kids and I love this recipe, although the dough is a little bland if you follow the recipe exactly.  I like to spice it up with some herbs and cheese sprinkled on after brushing with melted butter.  Makes great pizza dough and breadsticks, too.

We made just one calzone with this recipe.  It was a hit with the family.  We stuffed ours with a pepperoni and seasoned ground beef mix. Delicious.

I've made this numerous times, each time I use a different filling combination. My husband prefers it when I use a white sauce as the base rather than pizza sauce; it works really well with cooked chicken, black olives, and onions.

What a hit!! I used bacon and cheese. Topped the calzone with garlic salt, salt and rosemary. So delicious. Don't overstuff with the sauce/cheese otherwise it will ooze out. I baked mine for 55min.

I gave this four stars because while it was delicious, there are parts of the directions that could be improved. For example, when we made the calzones, we wanted individual sizes so that we could each choose our own stuffing. It says that the recipe makes four, but those are HUGE calzones. Also, it didn't say what thickness of dough to roll out, and our calzones ended up with crust that was too thick (when you took a bite, it was mostly bread) and didn't have enough cheese (we'll be adding more next time).
Also, be warned. If you make the individual calzones and don't seal the edges tightly enough, the stuffing might start to seep out while baking.

Overall though, this made a yummy dinner! We'll definitely be making it again.

Oh my gosh!!! Duuuuude this is soooo worth trying!!! This is the most formidable recipe ever witnessed by my eyes. I made this recipe and my husband and kids downed them in 1 hour. Maybe thats because my husband is 453 pounds, and my older daughter is 220 pounds, and my younger son is 376 pounds. I don't know either way I'll bet your butt that your family will love em'.  Boo ya!!
Please try

ABSOLUTLY BRILLIANT!!! I have never used our bread machine until this recipe. I became inspired after trying these calzones!! They were absolutly wonderful. My husband won't stop raving to his friends about my "homemade calzones". The dough worked perfectly in our high elevation, too! We love supreme pizza in my house, so I added red onion, sausage, canadian bacon, black olives, mushrooms and green pepper. I was a big hit that night. Needless to say, no left overs made it! LOL!!!

I added turkey pepperoni and a little spinach... awesome. My husband it looked too good to eat...well almost because he almost forgot to save some for me and ate it all. You can put almost anything inside. I might try broccoli and cheese next time.

Absolutely INCREDIBLE!  And much easier than I thought it would be.  I increased the recipe by 50%, and it made two very large calzones...one "everything" for the adults, and then a plain pepperoni & cheese for the younger crowd. Sauce on the side for dipping. Everyone LOVED it, and I'll definately be repeating the performance often now.  Try this one. You'll definately be glad you did.

I loved these. I put alittle bit of spices in the dough, I couln't even tell. I made six Calzones, my husband and I like alot of different things [ mushrooms, onions, etc.] My son likes pizza pretty simple, cheese and sausage. So this way I could make them different for everyone [thank you for that idea]. I loved the dough, I used a TBLS. of Splenda for the sugar, I liked the sweetness it gave. Crust wasn't to chewy or to hard, just right. I can't wait to make these again.

I don't own a bread machine but i think it's not absolutely necessary to have one in this recipe. Added 1/2 water and 1/2 milk (no milk powder), 1 teaspoon granulated garlic, 1 teaspoon dried oregano and a tablespoon olive oil. It's a great base recipe, try different ingredients for the filling. Thank you!

I just got my bread machine and have not had much luck with any of the recipes I've tried.  I was about ready to just give the thing away.  Yesterday, I decided to give it one last shot and made this recipe.  I did make a few minor modifications but it was WONDERFUL!  I didn't have powdered milk so I used 1/4 cup warm 2% milk in place of 1/4 cup of water.  I also took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 1 tsp. of garlic to the dough.  I checked the doughball at the beginning of the second knead and it looked fine but when I peeked in after it was done kneading, it was a mess.  Looked like something had exploded and the dough looked more like pancake batter and was incredibly sticky.  It was too late to add anything at that point (it was finished kneading) so I just let it go.  When the dough cycle was done, I got some flour on my hands and pulled out a handful of the sticky mess.  I kneaded in a little more flour by hand at that point and it suddenly looked just like pizza dough!  Since I had to work with the dough in small batches, I made 4 good sized calzones (my husband and I each shared one with one of the kids and we were all full with two whole ones leftover).  I did put some pizza sauce inside along with shredded cheese, pepperoni and sausage then folded the dough over and pinched to seal.  I cut slits in the top to vent then brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  I only had to b

i made this last night and my husband LOVED it!  he said it tasted like our pizza parlor's calzones back home.  we stuffed it with mozz, pepperoni and ham.  i also added some chopped garlic to the dough, which i made in our bread machine.  some friends stopped by while we were having dinner and they ate the rest and loved it as well.  we'll definately use this recipe often!

My family loved this.  I followed the recipe to the letter, using my bread machine and the dough was great, very easy to handle. Once rolled out the dough (before folding over) basically covered the entire cookie sheet (which just barely fits inside my oven wall to wall).  I live at a fairly high altitude and found that baking at 350 was too high, the calzone was starting to burn on the bottom after only 10 minutes, the second time I turned the heat down to 300 and baked for 35 min with the first 17 minutes with the heat coming from the bottom and then switching to the heat coming from the top, which turned out perfect and tender.  I think next time I might not bother folding it over, might just use it as pizza dough.

Warning: This made SOOOOO much food!!  I expected to use the recipe "as is", except make two regular calzones, instead of one giant one, and  I ended up making two giant ones!  The taste was good, but next time I'm going to use more filling.  I felt like the ratio of bread to filling wasn't even.  I also made extra pizza sauce for dipping the calzones in, and it made it a lot better.  I really like the recipe for its versatiliy.

We enjoy this recipe at least once a week just after I've made spaghetti sauce which I use in place of the pizza sauce. Usually use store bought dough just to cut the time. For the people that complain it makes too much "crust" have you done what the poster suggested and cut it in half? No, I didn't think so. I mean, why do something intelligent when you can complain instead? When I make the dough any left over gets made into garlic bread sticks.

Delicious.  We made this over a year ago and liked it okay.  It turns out we didn't roll the dough thin enough - so it was too doughy.  Since then we use this dough recipe for our weekly pizza night.  It is delicious.  Tonight we decided to try it in calzone form again.  SO YUMMY!  We opted to use leftover smoked sausage and also left the pizza sauce out to serve on the side for dipping.  The entire family loved it!  We'll add this into our regular pizza night rotation.

We just finished eating these, and the food coma is setting in! We found the dough to be a little sticky, so I'd add a little more flour next time. We changed the pepperoni for sausage and added some mushrooms. It was a hit! I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

I don't understand what went wrong here, but every time I tried to make the dough in the bread machine, it came out like soup.  I tried it 3 times, sure that I must have mismeasured. I'm baffled, the proportions seem ok, I've used the bread machine successfully for other recipes, and there are so many positive reviews.  I cannot figure out what went wrong!  Anyways, I used a different pizza dough recipe and the resulting calzone was delicious, but as written, I could not get this to work out.

My husband loved this calzone!  I didn't use the bread machine, I proofed the yeast and added the remaining ingredients.  Then I kneaded the dough for 5 minutes and allowed it to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes before spreading it out and following the remaining directions. I also added ingredients to the filling that we like; garlic, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and parmesan cheese.  I used olive oil in place of the melted butter on top of the calzone.  The dough was soft and chewy inside and had just enough crunch to the outside.  This will recipe will be repeated in our home.  Try it, I'm sure you will love it!

So good! Simple enough to make. Everyone enjoys it. The process of layering the strips of dough on the filling isn't ideal, so I just made it up on the spot. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, it worked fine.

very easy and awesome recipe. One I did with homemade pizza sauce and the other with olive oil and garlic sauce.  The one with pizza sauce was still doughy after 45 min. (only on inside).  Next time, I will do both without sauce and use the sauce as a dip.  The one without the sauce was perfect!  Great recipe though!

I wanted to try a recipe for beef stew calzones from a past issue of Every Day with Rachael Ray that called for a store-bought dough, but I decided to make my own instead.  This recipe for dough was very good.
I made the dough by hand, and also used milk in the place of water and dry milk powder, as I didn't have any on hand.  This seemed to work just fine, everyone liked them alot.  I look forward to trying the filling part of this recipe with the dough in the future.

This is the first homemade dough I have ever made.  It turned out perfect, even my 7 year old who doesn't like the crust on pizza, ate it and liked it.  I'll use this recipe many more times.  I didn't use a machine, but did it by hand. Kneaded the dough for about 11 minutes

This is the best recipe for calzones that my husband and I have ever tasted.  We wonder if it originally came from an italian cook.  Regardless we use this recipe EVERY SINGLE TIME!!!!  IT IS TOTALLY THE BEST RECIPE EVER!!!!!  We use this same recipe for calzones, pizza and my husband even uses this recipe for pizza that he cooks on the BBQ!!

This is a terrific recipe.  I did try what one poster said & cooked at a higher temp for less time - would NOT do that again.  Had "cajun" calzone.  Next time I'll follow the cooking instructions!

This was really, really good.  Pizza dough is always such a challenge for me!  So sticky.  Make sure you use plenty of flour on your surface and rolling pin.  I put spinach, mushrooms, basil, sauce, pepperoni and cheese.  I was worried about the spinach and mushrooms because they tend to add a lot of liquid on a normal pizza, but the crust held up just fine with no sogginess so that is a bonus.  I will be making this again and again.  It was tastey and easy and cheap!  You can not ask for more than that.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love this recipe and so does my family!! I get three calzones out of this recipe,just roll the dough very thin, but we like our crust a thinner.  I add seasonings to the crust too,from dried garlic to a dired tomato basil seasoning for a better taste.

Very good. The guys loved it although they said the crust to topping ratio was off... so next time I'm going to overlap the dough less when wrapping the toppings.

Made plenty of dough with the original recipe.  Came out with bell peppers, pepperoni, sausage, and cheese filling and created two of the best 5x12 calzones!

My family loved this recipe! I used more filling and extra cheese. Brushed it with garlic butter and it disapeared! Needless to say, we didnt have any left to freeze. Im just wondering what to fill the next batch with...maybe alfredo or phili cheese.

Great recipe but be prepared to have a lot of food.  I cut the recipe in half and made two regular calzones.  It was still too much for my husband and I.

This is very good and is our monthly rotation.  I like to include pepperoni, cooked crumbled bacon, ham/canadian bacon, cooked crumbled sausage and lots of motz. cheese.  In addition to brushing the top with melted butter and garlic salt, I also sprinkle with a little dried parsley for color and garnish.  It does take a while to prepare this recipe but it certainly becomes a family favorite. The end result is very beautiful and is perfect for entertaining.  I also recommend having extra pizza sauce or ranch dressing on hand for dipping.

i did this recipe and it was the best.  but i love seafood! and made a seafood calzone... my husband even loved it! by replcing the meat with, mussles, shrimp, sea legs and on occasion...octopus!  yum yum. I get a jar of bruschtta sauce mozzella and rocitta cheeses. ~Just make sure you drain the seafood WELL before cooking.

I was making this for just myself so I split the recipe in half.  I also changed the sausage to artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes, but it was delicious!  I've had trouble getting pizza dough recipes to come out right in the past, but this was easy and came out really great.

These are so very simple to make. We make the crust but divide it in two. The kids then fill the strip down the center with whatever it is they want on theirs. When we wrap them we put a toothpick on it to show who's side is who's and they couldn't be happier. My husband and I add in sauteed onion, green peppers, olives and next time we plan on making an all meat lovers one. We do add some garlic to the butter on the top for added flavor. these are amazing.

Great recipe! Per other reviewers, I added oregano, basil and garlic powder to the dough. SO good.  As for the filling, we used spinach, mushrooms, ricotta and mozzarella and had marinara sauce on the side for dipping.  We will definitely make again.

easy and yummy...i doubled the recipe which made 2 big calzones and gave us some leftovers for lunch.  Also used mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese mixed.  to cut the dough tomake the braid I cut it about 10 times on each side.  After basting with melted butter I sprinkled garlic seasoning on top.

The dough has great texture, but tastes bland, non-descript. I made the dough exactly as indicated, and it made two huge calzones--each calzone will be two to three servings per adult (four to six total meals). I filled mine with ricotta, mozzarella, spinach and I put the same on my husband's but added mushrooms and pepperoni as well. Cooking time was perfect.

This is a great recipe. I divided the dough to make four separate calzones. Also, I will add a little less sugar next time, as I thought the dough was a little too sweet.

Just used the dough recipe and our own fillings, this was a great dinner!  I made two calzones, one as written that turned out really pretty (for a dinner item) and one like the traditional looking calzone.  My husband liked them too, many possibilities with this recipe, thanks!

This was all right, but it stuck to the pan and it just wasn't anything spectacular.  If we make this again, we'll add more ingredients and put foil under the crust to make it easier to work with.

I made this last night and it was very good.  I needed to adjust the sauce and cheese for the second one(I didn't measure, just eye-balled it).  Like others have said I made 2 instead of one large and the crust was very good, my husband liked it alot.

good, even half the recipe gave too much dough for one calzone.  Half the recipe will make 2 reg. sized calzones. I just folded the calzones in half instead of layering the sides over each other, still worked

This was my first time making calzones, but I wanted to make individual calzones and found that this recipe made 6. The dough was pretty sticky so I found that the best way to separate it was not to roll it out but just pull blobs of dough and stretch them out with my hands to be in the right shape. I also found that the dough ended up being pretty thick so you have to really stuff it with as much cheese and toppings as you can fit to get a good ratio. 

I added some italian seasoning to the dough as well, but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe was written!

Yummy!  This recipe was great!  I made the dough as written except I didn’t include the dry milk powder as I didn’t have any in the house.  I found the dough to be very sticky, so I had to add flour until it became workable.  I stuffed it 2/3 with cheese and tomato sauce for the kids and 1/3 with the above plus broccoli.  Served with a side of tomato sauce.  Will make again!

I made this and my son gives it an 8 on a scale of 0-10. That is high praise for him! Looking forward to personalizing this by putting in my own filling. I also plan to make 2 smaller calzones and freeze one for later use. Hope this works well.

Will definitely make again.  I used frozen, thawed squeezed spinach,  chopped pepperoni, the stripe of marinara sauce and Italian cheese blend but will use some ricotta next time.  The bread machine does a great job on the dough cycle.

I had to knead the dough with a ton more flour, and I couldn't  get it out of my bread pan. Came out bland.

Fabulous!  I made the dough exactly as described, with the exception of the powered milk.  My stuffing was ricotta and mozzerlla cheese, leftover ham, chopped fresh spinach and red bell pepper.  Love these kind of dishes that create excellent leftovers!

I had leftover spaghetti meat sauce I needed to use, so I added some extra bell peppers and jalapenos and used that for the filling sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. The bread was fantastic and super easy! I didn't have dry milk, so I substituted the water and dry milk with 1 1/4 cup liquid milk. It rose beautifully and tasted great! Halfway through baking I brushed with butter and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. I highly recommend to try out this recipe! We will be making it the day after spaghetti night from now on.

I think it was overall good but I had to add almost an extra cup of flour to make it workable.  I don't have a bread machine so I just mixed it together, needed it a little and let it rise 30 minutes.

Very easy! I substituted dry milk for regular milk. Turned out a tad sticky, so I added a small amount flour during mixing. It turned out great, and the calzones were delicious!

This was really delicious!  I didn't realize the dough would expand so much, so next time I'll use a bit more filling, and the crust was a bit sweet for me, so I'll use a little less sugar.  I used a bread  machine on the "dough" cycle and everything else was perfect.

This recipe was easy to make and it tasted great!  I loved using the bread machine for the dough.  I think it will be a regular meal at our house.
