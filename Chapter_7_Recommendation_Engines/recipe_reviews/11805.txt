This recipe is to die for. However, I gave it 4 stars because I had to adjust it a bit to make it work. The other reviewers are right, the cheese to noodle ratio is way off. The mouse likes her cheese a little too much! The macaroni has to be doubled to 3 cups, and I found it does best in a roomy 2 or 2.5 quart casserole dish.

Since I'm not a huge fan of so much velveeta and processed cheeses, I went out in search of the perfect blend and found Kraft's "Classic Melts" shredded cheese blend. It's a combo of American cheese, sharp cheddar, white cheddar, and monterey jack. I got two of the 8 oz. bags.

I am pregnant, and this is my all-time #1 craving. Better than the Cracker Barrel's Mac & Cheese. :)

Excellent!  And I agree with "bakechef" -don't use more macaroni! This is perfect just as is, as the pasta will absorb the "soupiness" either as it sets or as it bakes.  Unless you want a gelatinous wad of pasty macaroni, "don't use more macaroni."  This is classic macaroni and cheese just as it should be - creamy and cheesey and just plain comfort food good, with no sharp cheeses or extra,  distracting spices or seasonings.  I prepared this exactly as written, right down to the seasoned bread crumbs - for that I just crushed some herb crostini toasts. I can't see a mac and cheese recipe that could possibly be any better than this one.

This is great, whatever you do DON'T USE MORE MACARONI if you want the creamiest macaroni and cheese ever.  The first time that I made it I thought that there was too little macaroni, but after it baked, it was absolutely perfect.  I have also made this using 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 american cheese and it was wonderful as well.  I would suggest if making changes to still use 1/2 processed cheese like velveeta or american, as it lends to the creaminess of the sauce since it melts so well and doesn't separate like real cheeses such as cheddar, but I love using 1/2 sharp cheddar for flavor.  This is my now standard recipe.

I followed recipe exactly.  I hate when people change the recipe then rate it unfavorly.  But I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted just OK.  I won't make again.  It tasted fine right out of the oven.  But an hour later when I needed to serve it (it was still very warm)  the cheese became lumpy instead of the creamy consistancy it had right out of the oven.  So eat right out of oven or don't eat at all.

This is a very nice, basic mac and cheese recipe.  The mac and cheese is perfect prior to baking in the oven.  Baking dries out the sauce as it is absorbed in the macaroni.  Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream or milk (skim is ok) to make sure the consistency is very creamy and liquid prior to placing in the oven to bake.  The bread crumbs are not necessary; a sprinkling of paprika for color does just fine.  I also grate a little onion for flavor, use white pepper (and this recipe is rather bland without it) and use a variety of cheeses such as a good quality cheddar (love Hoffman's extra sharp - ultra smooth, yet ultra tasty), asiago, american, a bit of parmesan.  Whatever your particular palate grooves to.  If you love an ultra creamy, cheesy mac and cheese, skip the baking and dig in!!

i've been looking for a good homemade mac and cheese recipe and this works great! although i modified this recipe right away by using 2 cups of cheddar cheese bec no one in the house likes processed cheese. i also used 2 cups of macaroni. also, instead of 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, i used  1/8 c. of bread crumbs and 1/8 c. fresh grated parmesan.

This is one of the best mac and cheese recipes, and I've tried a bunch of them. I've made this several times while adjusting the recipe and I have one word of warning...don't increase the mustard! And I haven't been able to get it really creamy without the velveeta.

I used only velveeta, but doubled it to match the recipe and this was FANTASTIC. I even scaled it larger for leftovers, added a little butter and it reheated great. My husband said it was the best he had ever tasted and my 3 year old had 2 helpings! Thanks, this one's a keeper.

My husband loved this.  It wasn't the absolute BEST macaroni and cheese that I've ever had, but I'll definitely hang on to the recipe.  When you first mix the noodles with the sauce it looks like it's going to be way too saucy, but once you bake it, it's perfect.  I couldn't find a block of American cheese at the grocery store so I used a bag of shredded four-cheese blend (which included American cheese).  I also used 1/8 cup bread crumbs instead of 1/4 cup and it was more than enough.  We're looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

This recipe is wonderful, HOWEVER, I think a key ingredient is missing.  My mother made the most amazing mac and cheese on earth!  I've tried dozens of other people's homemade recipes over the years and every single one is bland in comparison.  You MUST use 2 Tablespoons of MINCED onion (vidalia or another sweet onion is BEST to use for this, regular yellow or white makes it too strong) and cook the onion in the butter until soft then add the flour.  I also only use 1 Tablespoon of flour.  It thickens wonderfully in oven.  You also need to use 1/2 teaspoon of salt (add to onions and butter with the pepper), even though the cheese is salty, it will make it perfect!  I also use 8 oz velveeta and 8 oz shredded classic melts cheese by kraft.  I promise you won't be disappointed!

Made this dish for a staff Christmas potluck.  Everyone loved it and there was NONE left even though I doubled the recipe - I only got a couple tablespoons of it to enjoy for myself.  I'll definitely be making this again for company, and I'll make sure there are TONS of leftovers.

I did not use breadcrumbs (will try with them later this week), and I used old white cheddar instead of American.

Anyone who found this too soupy likely did not cook it in the oven for long enough. It was perfect. PLEASE do not double the pasta like some reviewers recommend. The cheesiness is perfect, and you can leave it in the oven longer if you like.

I did follow the advice of another reviewer, Cassandra, about properly making the roux. Here's what she wrote for your reference - and it turned out perfect for me.

When making the roux, the flour and butter must be stirred on low heat constantly until the color becomes a light nutty brown. If the color gets too dark, the bechamel sauce will have a burnt flavor. If the color is too light, the flavor will be of raw flour. As soon as the color is right, slowly pour in room temp milk and stir until thickened. Then add mustard powder, black pepper and cheese.

Husband's own words were, "Now, this is the way macaroni and cheese is supposed to taste." Kids inhaled it. I thought this was very similar to how Mom made macaroni and cheese when we still got gov'ment cheese AND very close to KFC macaroni and cheese. I did use sharp cheddar in place of the shredded American, only because I didn't have any. I made no other changes. I'll make this again, just for them. Wasn't my favorite mac and cheese recipe but it was theirs. NOTE: You'll be tempted to make more macaroni when you combine the partially cooked macaroni and sauce, DON'T. It'll firm up and soak up some of the cheese when it bakes. Trust me.

I've been using this website for 7 years and I have yet to review anything. Until now. 

Hands down, best mac and cheese EVER. Like another user said, I hate reading reviews where people will rate it based on THEIR changes. I want to know how this recipe is, not yours.

I did everything just as it said, and it is magic. I have never had anything that tastes this good. I will DEFINITELY make this again. It wasn't too runny nor too thick and pasty. If you like mac and cheese, then this is for you!

This was very good.  I used 2 cups of macaroni and didn't cover while baking.  Next time I will use all sharp cheddar since that is the cheese we prefer in our mac and cheese.  Melt the butter in a cup in the microwave and stir and blend in the flour, mustard and pepper...no lumps!  Pour into your saucepan and continue with recipe.  Easy and a keeper.  Thanks!

I love this recipe!  It is so easy and everyone raves about it when I take it to potlucks.  I use penne pasta and add sage to my bread crumbs for more of a "gourmet" look.

This was excellent!  Only changes I made were: Used 2 8oz bags of Kraft cheese crumbles - 3 cheese blend, shook some garlic powder in and used a whole box of seashell pasta.  It was perfect!

DELISH!  I doubled teh recipe and made it exactly as directed.  Only thing I did different was to take cover off after baking broiled the top to brown the crumbs.  I actually made this for my daughter &  son in law (they recently had a baby and thought I'd bring lunch/dinner) but I snuck a spoonful before wrapping it up.  Thanks for sharing this, I'll definitely make it again!

For Macaroni and cheese, this was perfect for my needs- a 4-year-old birthday party.  (I have a hard time giving any mac-n-cheese a 5-star rating, but the children absolutely loved it and all the moms were picking it off their kids plates!) I doubled the recipe and it fed 14 kids.  I used sharp cheddar instead of American, and topped with crumbled ritz.  The mustard was nice.  Will make again for kids-occasions for sure.  And just FYI, I know this totally changes the recipe, but i made an alternate version for the family party the next day the same way, using black truffle salt instead of mustard, white cheddar cheese, and added lobster meat.  Now that was heavenly.

UPDATE:

FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!! A brilliant, beautiful first attempt gave way to a lousy second attempt because I did not follow instructions.

My mistakes the second time were:

- Velveeta in the roux before the milk (oops)

- Dumped all the milk in at once (instead of gradually, causing the roux and milk to lump up)

- Surprisingly, thought substituting sharp cheddar for the American cheese would give it a more developed flavor...surprisingly NOT. The virtues of sharp cheddar were positively thrown in your face, ad nauseum. Too much of a good thing, I guess. 

So just follow the recipe exactly if you want those "five star raves"!

---

Fifteen Star Recipe!!!

Wow...I am a fussy SOB who has eaten at some fine fine restaurants in his day...and this macaroni and cheese takes the genre to a whole new level. It's like going from Mozart (or Salieri) to freaking Rachmaninoff...a whole other level with nuance and stacked emotion that is off the charts. Yes, this is an emotional experience!

Go make it now!!

- Matt

p.s. in response to the person in Dubai who said he/she skipped the breadcrumbs...don't! They add this beautiful, home-cooked flourish, including some excellent texture contrast (the seasoned crumbs mix with some of the sauce in spots and make this delicious little side attraction...well worth the few extra cents for the crumbs...and the rest of the container won't go to waste, as you WILL be making this recipe again :D ).

Wow -- this recipe had way more than a dash of black pepper!  The texture and cheesiness were terrific, so I will definitely make again, but I would suggest salt (not listed) and pepper to taste.  I found it easier to double the recipe to use a full box of noodles and an entire stick of butter.

I loved this...my whole family did.  I am not big on dry mac-n-cheese.  This one was so nice and creamy.  I didn't find it runny at all..just perfect.  I only made one small change.  I used Monterey Jack cheese in place of the American because I had some I needed use.  It was great...a definite keeper.

This is great. I made it the night before (no breadcrumbs) and didn't bake it.  The day of my event, I let it get to room temperature and then baked as normal. Delicious

Having a cheese craving for lunch, I made this with grilled cheese sandwiches (some days, I just gotta have my cheese!).  I used more noodles and a little less cheese (6oz American/4oz velveeta). Also, I used Italian style bread crumbs. Not too cheesy but enough to ease my craving. Very good mac n cheese Mouse! "Ahhhh- the power of cheese!"

Yum!  If, like me, you rarely have dried mustard powder in the house, 1 tsp powder converts to 1 Tbsp prepared.  Worked wonders.

Macaroni soup :(  Followed recipe to a tee, no moderations.  It bubbled up so much in my oven I now have to clean it - before Thanksgiving no less. It also has chunks of cheese even though the sauce was creamy from the stove top.  Wish I had just poured half the sauce on the cooked macaroni and called it a day.

Just made this for supper...it was FAB! I used Medium Cheddar cheese instead of American cheese out of preference. This is now on our family menu. Thanks!

I made this for my son's preschool Thanksgiving feast and chose this recipe because of it's simplicity since my husband informed me that "kids don't like baked mac and cheese". Boy, did I prove him wrong! They LOVED this dish and all the moms asked me for the recipes afterward. I doubled the recipe and followed the instructions exactly except I used an entire box of elbow macaroni instead of just three cups and had plenty of sauce and I used a block of Medium Cheddar instead of American since Velveeta IS American cheese and I didn't think it needed two kinds of American cheese. I'm making this dish again for Thanksgiving so the kids will have something they're sure to love to eat.

This is my second attempt at this recipe and I just can't love it as written. The texture and consistency are perfect, nice and creamy and soft, but I just don't love the velveeta flavor. I may try mixing and matching with different cheeses, but I am sure it will be hard to come up with a sauce that is both tasty and rich and velvety.  

This is a nice basic recipe to get a good roux base and get the proportions of sauce to Mac, but the taste is just not for me. Also, it makes a ton!  I halved the recipe and it made enough for 4 as a main, way more than enough as a side with leftovers.  **Updated** Attempt #3 with diferent cheese.  I followed the original recipe (cut in half) and used one 8 oz. bag of "Kraft cheddar cheese blend with philly cream cheese".  The taste was great, but I lost the consistency.  It was grainy and clumpy, but the flavor was great.  I suppose next time I will try with half american and half cheddar blend and see if I can reach a happy medium.

This was good, really really good. I even liked it leftover. I used 2 cups of macaroni and added a couple of shakes of onion powder. Other than that, it was exactly as written. I will be using this recipe again.

Thought this was very good. I made two different trays. One with American cheese and the other with Sharp Cheddar. The one with the american cheese tastes almost like Velvetta shells and cheese from a box. The one with sharp cheddar had a nice flavor. Liked both of them. I added shredded cheese instead of bread crumbs. I baked uncovered in the oven to let the cheese brown. Cant go wrong either way. I also made this with penne pasta noodles since they are a bit thicker and macaroni can get mushy if over cooked or saved for the next day.

Good recipe! Instead of Velveeta I used an 8 oz. bag of a blended cheese along with the 8 oz. cheddar.  I use a 2 qt. casserole dish so it doesn't bubble over. Thanks Mouse!

It was clear that I needed a new Mac-n-Cheese recipe when I noticed my fiance melting Kraft Singles on top of leftovers of my Mom's recipe. I figured this one would be good, it already had the processed cheese in it!   I used Velveeta Singles and Kraft Sharp Cheddar. I also used an entire box of elbow macaroni which was probably too much so mine wasn't as creamy as some of the pictures but still delicious! I added a little salt to the cheese mixture since I used unsalted butter.  Might have to kick my Mom's recipe out for this one!

For the perfect sauce/cheese ratio, use a 16 oz (1 lb) box of macaroni noodles and double the sauce recipe.  We prefer half velveeta and half sharp cheddar (instead of american). This makes a nice large amount for potlucks, and it's very creamy and cheesy.  We just add the cooked noodles right into the sauce and it doesn't even need to go in the oven.  With the recipe as written, there's hardly any noodles.  I have made the recipe as written also, and I would still rate it 5 stars.  It's just not a large enough amount to make for most occasions.

This is great.  I agree with other reviewers, DO NOT add more macaroni, when you first add the macaroni (before putting it in the oven) it really does look like a soupy mess, but as it cooks it thickens and sets. wow - so good.  Perfect consistancy!

I only gave this 4 stars, because after making it as written, I found it too peppery and otherwise kind of lacking something. I made it a 2nd time with some tweaks and then a 3rd time with some more tweaks and found the perfect balance of cheese and seasoning. 

My changes were: 
1. 1/2 tsp of black pepper (instead of 1 tsp); 
2. add 1/2 tsp of salt; 
3. add 1 tsp of onion powder; 
4. add 1 tsp of paprika; and 
5. reduce American cheese to 4 oz and Velveeta to 4 oz and add 8 oz of Cheddar cheese. 

I was making this for a party, so I trippled the recipe, completely cooked the noodles and put everything in a crockpot on low for one hour and on warm the rest of the time. I left out the bread crumbs and did not use all of the sauce, but if I had par cooked the noodles and baked it in the oven, I think I would have used all of the sauce, since some of it would have been absorbed by the noodles during cooking.

I was absolutely amazed by the results! This is probably the best mac and cheese I have ever eaten, although it is VERY rich. Definitely best as a side dish. It got lots of compliments and I passed along the recipe. I will definitely make this again and try baking it in the oven!

Absolutely fantastic!!! A lot of reviewers seem to think that you should double the pasta or reduce the cheese sauce and I have to disagree completely. I doubled the entire recipe (except I left the mustard & pepper the same). After mixing together I dumped it all in my slow cooker and set it on "Keep Warm". It set up beautifully just doing that without the baking step - I did skip the breadcrumbs. I was serving this at a poker party, so doing it this way just worked out perfectly for me. I used mild cheddar instead of American out of preference. Everyone really raved about this; I'll make again and again!

Perfection!  My whole family absolutely loved it -- even those who normally hate mac n cheese!!!  I only changed one minor thing--I used French's fried onions sprinkled on top instead of bread crumbs.  Scrumptious!  Thank you!  I've been looking for the perfect mac n cheese recipe, and this is it!

MMMMMMMMmmmmmm!!! I served this over the holidays when everyone wanted a 'comfort food' night and this was a hit with everyone! I scaled it to 10 servings, used 2C grated medium cheddar, and a brick of Velveeta and even tossed in a half brick of cream cheese I had in the fridge, and replaced a half of the milk with half&half I had on hand, but these changes I'm sure weren't necessary, they were just so that I could get rid of stuff in my fridge. The cheese mixture on the stove seemed 'soupy', but after baking with the macaroni, much of it was absorbed, yet the result was still creamy and not at all dry! I also used Panko crumbs on the top instead of bread crumbs since I always use them for everything else...  This recipe is THE keeper mac and cheese recipe! Family members took the recipe home, it's that good and yes, very comforting! I served it with a Waldorf Salad and Italian bread.

I made this recipe for the first time and everyone loved it!!!!  I used a variety of cheeses: some 2-year old white cheddar, some medium cheddar and some sharp cold-pack cheese.  I was careful to use whole milk, following the recommendations of other readers.  Delicious!

Wow.....delish!  I couldn't decide who was "right" about how much pasta to use, so I used two cups....we thought that was the perfect ratio.  I used skim milk and substituted Colby for the American cheese.  Thanks, Mouse!

This is great macaroni and cheese. I agree with the reviewers saying not to double the amount of macaroni! This is creamy and saucy...the way I like macaroni and cheese! One of the things I don't like about homemade mac and cheese is that I always feel like it comes out dry and like there isn't enough cheese. This was delicious though. One of the warnings I will give about this though is serve it right out of the oven. Unfortunately my mom and I both cooked Christmas dinner and my food was done on time and her's wasn't, so the mac and cheese sat for awhile. It still tasted great, but the cheese started to solidify and it became very thick. 5 stars but serve immediately!

I made this exactly as written without reading any of the reviews.  Based on the ingredient list, it looked perfect.  I ended up being disappointed with the result.  After eating some, I went back to look at the reviews and found a few others that had the same result as I did - graininess.  My first assumption was operator error but after reading others' reviews I don't think so.  It was grainy right out of the oven - it was even more grainy upon reheating.  I thought the mustard powder and pepper were great so the flavor isn't the issue here.  I tried to salvage the leftovers by doctoring individual servings with a bit of sour cream, a bit of milk and a bit more velveeta.   The result was a better texture, but then the flavors are off.  So, 5 stars for flavor but the texture issue drops it down significantly for me.

plain awesome.  i always hunt and search for the velveeta recipe as its only printed on the inside of the small box of velveeta.....this by FAR AND AWAY is better than that recipe.  TY mouse!!!  i did NOT put more noodles in...even though every fibre of my body told me to lol...and im glad i did because much of it was absorbed while it baked and the rest settled nicely for leftovers!
thanks so much!  ****DONT PUT MORE NOODLES!!***

yum yum! prepared just as stated, comes out excellent every time! Only thing I don't care so much for is the bread topping. Don't get me wrong, I love the crispy topping but bread crumbs just don't do it for me. Looking for something crispier! Super recipe! Thanks

Rated 4 because the family loved it.  Personally, I was looking for a more creamy, saucy mac and cheese.  I will prob add for velveeta next time and a little more half and half.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. Some reviewers have said the end result is too cheesy, and all I have to say is, "Whaaat?" No such thing.

I didn't use the same cheeses as the recipe specified; instead, I opted for sharp cheddar, a casserole blend (Kroger brand), and a couple handfuls of a hot pepper cheese blend (also Kroger brand). It came out to 16-17oz of cheese, per the recipe measurements. 

As for the bread crumbs, I used plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned (it's all I had), and added a bit of garlic powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper to taste. I've also found that lightly browning the breadcrumbs in a skillet with a bit of butter really brings out the flavor, so I will do that next time. 

This is a great recipe as is, but part of what I love about making mac and cheese in general is how easily it can be experimented with. So really, any melt-able cheese is fair game.

Also, it tastes possibly even better warmed up as leftovers. Mmm.

Doubled this and made in a 9x13 with a pound of pasta. Used 1 lb velveeta (imitation) and 2 cups of Costco's shredded cheese mix. Added mustard, cayenne and onion powder. Topped with parmesan instead of bread crumbs. Great, thanks! Edited: Made this again today but substituted mustard for mustard powder, need to halve the mustard for future uses.

Yummmmmm_YYYYYYYYY! :o) We loved this...the only reason I am giving 4 stars is that I changed the recipe to broil the breadcrumbs to make it crisp on top. VERY good!!

i made this the night before thanksgiving and was a little nervous how it would reheat since there is so much real cheese i was nervous.  well it was a huuuuuuge hit and the cheese stayed nice and creamy as intended (im pretty sure the velveeta was key). i just threw it back in the oven for another 30 min or so.  i tripled the recipe and used gruyere cheese and mozzarella instead of american simply because i like a stronger cheese and thought it would add a bit of flavor.  it was just perfect and a huge hit.  anyone who complains about too much cheese is crazy! its not like youre making this to be healthy, its unhealthy as it gets but SO GOOD.  also, for the crust, i used equal parts panko crumbs and grated parm cheese.  this will def be my staple pot luck item.

**UPDATE: made this again served it right away...i did see what some were saying about it being soupy, but it really wasn't a problem for me, but i understand why some people do prefer to add more noodles. Next time i might add a bit more noodles if im serving it same day, or i could just let it cool off for a few minutes to thicken, but for a pot luck and reheating i think as is is just perfect.

This was really a cheesy recipe.  I even increased to 2 cups of macaroni and it was too cheesy for me.  My boyfriend and son liked it well enough but I think I'll keep looking for something more home-style.

I made this last night (all but the baking) for dinner tonight. It was delicious! I didn't have mustard powder, so I just skipped that ingredient. I used 8oz of shredded cheddar instead of the American. I also used 2 cups of macaroni - penne, because no elbows in the pantry. I was afraid it wouldn't bake up bubbly from making it ahead, but it turned out perfectly creamy and bubbly. I refrigerated it overnight and took it out about an hour before popping it into the oven. I let it bake for 30 minutes just to be sure it heated through the middle. This will be our family's mac and cheese from now on! I can't wait to make it for a potluck.

This is the best mac and cheese ever! It seems like there's too much sauce compared to pasta, but once you bake it, it's perfect. I'll never use another recipe again. Oh, and instead of the "American cheese", I used an 8 oz. bag of shredded cheddar. I did use the Velveeta, too, as the recipe calls for.

I used (2) 8oz bags of the shredded Kraft Easy Melt cheese instead of the Velveeta (processed cheese) and then also added approx. 2 cups of shredded extra sharp cheddar, instead of the cubed American cheese. This was plenty of sauce for the entire box of elbow macaroni. Oh and I leave off the bread crumbs, just my family's personal preference. So very, very yummy. It has become my go-to Macaroni and Cheese recipe.

My husband has made this twice, and it's delicious.  The first time he used a pound (16 oz) of elbow pasta, and the bread crumb topping came out very crisp.  The second time he used a 13.25 oz box of Dreamfield elbows, and the topping wasn't as crispy.  He made one batch, and then I mixed steamed vegetables into mine and he mixed browned Italian sausage meat into his.  We will definitely be making this mac and cheese again, but we may try a topping of crushed Ritz crackers mixed with butter next time.

Yum! The touch of mustard is perfect.  I am not a fan of Velveeta, and prefer organic ingredients, which worked very well.  Also, using shredded vs. cubed cheese cuts helps make sure the sauce isn't lumpy.

Very creamy indeed.  A little too much pepper to be a kid pleaser in my house, but a great substitution for those who like a little spice is to use Velveeta pepperjack cheese...I loved it!

I added carrots to the macaroni boil.  Gotta have veggies.  I used one can fat free evaporated milk instead of 2 cups milk.  It tasted a little bland before baking, so I added about one teaspoon "Onion Plus" dried onions to the mix.  Maybe boosting the mustard to 2 tsp or adding parmesean cheese might perk up the flavor.

Outstanding! We had this last Friday night, and it disappeared. I couldn't find a block of American cheese for the recipe, but used an 8 oz. bag 4-cheese blend (finely shredded), which worked out great. This is our new homemade mac and cheese recipe from now on!

I was looking for something easy and fast. This recipe was the one! My daughter, who is a die-hard boxed Mac and Cheese fanatic, absolutely loved it and wondered, "Why, in all my 15 years, have we not had this before?" I took it to a football tailgating party, and it was definitely a crowd favorite. I did use sharp cheddar instead of American, but I think it's just a matter of personal taste. Try this one!

I was looking for a kid friendly mac n cheese that would get eaten like Kraft's blue box, and this totally fit the bill!  I made a full crockpot of this for a kids' birthday party (at the birthday boy's request) and it was devoured by kids and adults alike (some went back for 4ths!)  I was shocked at how much got eaten.  I didn't use the bread crumbs or bake it since it was going in the crockpot.  I just made the sauce in a large stockpot then added the cooked noodles and transferred to the crockpot and kept it on warm.  I quadrupled the recipe but kept the ratios the same except for pasta (used a full lb box of macaroni per previous reviews).  It was just right in terms of sauce/pasta in my opinion.  At first I thought it was too soupy but the pasta soaked it up.  Great recipe for a no-frills mac n cheese!

I mostly made this as written but a few subs. Iused white pepper so it wasn't as noticeable to the kids, and evaporated milk for half since I ran out...OMG, this is just what I wanted. I had to do a test run as I'm bringing a big pot to a Superbowl party and this will do it! It was too much sauce for me, but I just made more noodles:) Great by itself, but I'll be adding some garlic, bacon and green onions for the adult version. Yum!

Mouse's Macaroni & Cheese = Delicious! Taste just fancy restaurants's Mac & Cheese. My personal notes is I think the mac to cheese ratio is too much cheese, so I would do 2 cups of macaroni instead of 1.5. 1 tsp of Mustard Powder = 1 tbsp of Mustard. I'm going to use 1/2 tbsp of Mustard next time just because I'm not a huge fan of the taste of Mustard.  I'd cut the pepper in half too, has a very peppery taste.  Approx 12 slices of American cheese = 8 oz. Also, this recipe says to use a 1.5 qt casserole dish, I did that and it was at the edge. It spilled over and made a mess in the oven and dripped all down the sides. So I'm going to use a 2 qt dish next time! But all in all this is a superb dish! :)

I love this recipe. It was so good everybody in my family liked it. I did make a few changes though. Instead of American and Velveeta, I used a chicken. An instead of macaroni, I used rosemary, garlic and lemon slices. It was the best I have ever had. I will definitely make it again.

The recipe is nice. I had halved the recipe &used sharp Cheddar & parmigiana "half the quantity".It was sufficient enough without the cheese extra load.Also i found the sauce consistency too thick, even though I didn't cook it too long& by the time it was done cooking it was already do thick that I don't think it needed the extra oven baking. I did bake it but when it was done I found it little dry.it needed extra liquid.i did add some boiled milk to get the right consistency. Anybody making this, half the cheese &fully cook the pasta before adding it to the sauce.No baking required. It'll come out prefect.

This recipe was phenomenal!! Best macaroni and cheese I or my husband have ever had hands down. I did tweak the recipe by adding 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese for a kick and 8 oz cream cheese because I am in love with cream cheese and it came out just PERFECT. The original recipe alone was to die for either way, I just customized this batch for our flavor. Enjoy and have fun modifying to your liking because its quite simple!

This was good, but the sauce relies on processed cheese which makes it a little bland (and very salty, FYI.) I would recommend throwing some shredded cheese on top of it before sprinkling on the bread crumbs just to give it a little something else, just watch it closely in the oven to be sure the cheese doesn't start to get too hot.

Totally, absolutely decadent.  I made as written.  Fed 2 adults and 3 teens with small bowl of leftovers.  Only change I made was to use shredded cheddar rather than the American cheese component as it was what I had on hand.  This is the kind of recipe you hate to love.

I chose this recipe because I was trying to find a homemade mac and cheese recipe my granddaughter would eat. It definitely tastes like processed cheeses! She loved it though, so if she'll eat it happily, I'll give it 5 stars!

This is very cheesy. Hubby liked it alot but I tend to like less cheese. I did a few things differently. First off, all I had was velveeta cheese so I used 16 ounces of that instead of using another kind of cheese. I also added some cooked, diced bacon in at the end for some protein and it was great! Make sure you love processed cheese before doing it my way!

You MUST double if not triple the pasta! 1.5 cups would be good if you wanted Cheese soup with Macaroni! It wasn't a huge hit as I was expecting even with the adjustment of pasta. Probably will not use this again.

Very good. This is my usual recipe except I use cheddar cheesse,  Grey Poupon mustard instead of dry mustard and use more bread crumbs. 3/4 cups toasted breadcrumbs and then I stir in 1/2 cup grated cheese for topping.

I am a HUGE macaroni and cheese lover and typically like to eat my mac n'cheese gooey and right out of the pan, as opposed to baking it. I find it cheesier and more delicious that way however, with this mac n'cheese you MUST bake it! I tried it right out of the pan and was almost ready to throw it out on the spot! The cheese flavor was gross (and i like the taste of american cheese, so that wasn't the issue) and it was just overwhelmingly fake cheese tasting. I decided to pop it in the oven since it was already "ruined" in my eyes, and low and behold, it was great after baking! The artificial cheese taste magically vanished, and it was actually quite delicious! I will make this version again, but will not even bother to eat a small bowl unless baked. Also, I used an entire 13.5 oz box of elbows because there was plenty of cheese sauce to cover it.

Doubled the recipe, substituted the dry bread crumbs for fresh ones mixed with fresh grated parmesan. Very very creamy and delicious. There is only 1 mac and cheese that beats this one, that is the mac and cheese from the Whole Foods deli counter (a recipe that they hide very well). Overall, very filling and very good!

I only did 1/4 tsp of Black pepper which was just right for my kids, and I used the large-sized elbow noodles.  I also left off the bread crumbs - my kids just don't like mac and cheese with breadcrumbs.  It was a huge success!  We had this as a side dish with homemade chicken nuggets.  Thank you for sharing a recipes that is sure to be a keeper with our family.

Don't change the pasta/sauce ratio!  It looks crazy soupy when you put it in the pan, but it comes out perfectly after cooking in the oven for the 25 minutes.  The pasta soaks up the milk and it is just fine.  This recipe is a little peppery for me (and I really like pepper a lot).  I will cut down the pepper a bit next time.  I also like the half velveeta and half american.  For the american - I just unwrapped sandwich cheese slices.

Very yummy and simple. Only 4 stars b/c it was a bit peppery for my kids (3yrs and 1 yr). Next time i think i will cut the pepper amount by 1/2.
Otherwise loved it!

The only subsitution I made was to use 1 cup old cheddar and 1 cup marble cheese (we don't eat the processed stuff).  This recipe is very easy and very tasty but the heavy, greasy butteriness was overwhelming for us.  Next time I'll cut the butter by 1/2 or more, and maybe add a dollop of sour cream or add some heavy cream instead of all milk, and add more cheese.  This is such an easy recipe, its definitely worth trying again with these modifications.  Thanks for sharing.
Oh, and do NOT add more macaroni - if you plan to bake this, the ratio of macaroni to sauce is perfect.

This is an easy and tasty recipe that pleased even my husband who doesn't usually care for mac & cheese. I used mild cheddar instead of American and evaporated milk instead of regular milk, because one on-line cooking site suggested that the processing of the milk might make the cheese sauce less likely to curdle.

I literally just made this, and am literally eating the macaroni as I type. I went with a reviewer's alteration by using Kraft's "cheese melt" (???) shredded bagged cheese instead of American and Velveeta. The truth is I couldn't find Velveeta. I'm not a very great cook. The only dishes I've made are pasta dishes and half of them were macaroni and cheese (I just love it so much), so I say this recipe is pretty easy and not much of a hassle to get the ingredients. I think I messed up and put a teaspoon extra of pepper, and I was choking on it before I started typing. I added bacon, because I like some meat and bacon is yummy. It made it a little smokey and salty, and I think the mix is very good. The ratio of macaroni and cheese is perfect. The cheese thickens and surrounds the noodles in a delicious way. I would make it again.

This was really good.  Followed the measurements other than using the Kraft shredded cheddar mixture with a touch of cream cheese in place of the American cheese.  Still used the Velveeta.  Only had plain breadcrumbs for the top.  Stirred the mixture when in the oven about every 5 min to make sure the cheese went throughout.  Kids loved it and adults ate it too!  After making this a few times the amount of cheese sauce compared to noodles is too much.  I used the shells instead of elbow and the whole 12 oz box worked good.

The only changes I made to the recipe were omitting the breadcrumb topping and using sharp cheddar cheese instead of American cheese. I made a bunch and froze for OMAC. I think it tastes fantastic, and I am generally not a fan of homemade macaroni and cheese. I will definitely be making this one again!

I used sharp cheddar, because that's all I had, but I can't see how using a different cheese could make it taste any less yummier than it was! My kids loved it, and so did I!

This was very good and pretty easy.  I didn't have mustard powder, so I used prepared mustard (about 1tblsp) and it turned out fine.   I also added 1tsp of seasoned salt.  

I like a lot of cheese so I used 6 oz of velveeta, 8 oz. extra sharp cheddar, 6 oz med cheddar, and about 3 oz of some shredded mexican blend with one whole package of pasta.  It was very good!!!   I plan on experimenting with different cheeses each time I make it.  I think next time I'm going to use all white cheeses.  I keep ya posted!

DELICIOUS!  Even picky teens love this recipe!  I've made this with macaroni elbows, corkscrew, & shells, all gluten free.  I have this with a variety of cheese combos also, all yummy!  I have made this with & without gluten free bread crumbs.  All good!

This recipe is amazing.  My 6 year old loves this and now won't eat KD.  This is my go to dish for the kids.  I use velveeta or cheez whiz as the american cheese because being canadian, I'm not really sure what american cheese is. It uses alot of cheese but it is worth it.

Very good! I used sharp cheddar for more flavor instead of american cheese. Doubled the recipe. Forgot to cover when I baked, but still turned out wonderful! This is super creamy delicious! Had some sauce leftover, used the next morning for breakfast mixed it with scrambled eggs :)

I think the proportions are a little off (e.g. too much butter, too little pasta); the cheese is creamy when warm, but becomes grainy as it cools, and remains grainy upon reheating.

I think it's important to cook that roux for at least 8 minutes before adding milk--otherwise, the flour will not cook.  The recipe doesn't say this, and I had to learn the hard way.  I have since used other recipes, and my favorite is Ina Garten's, done with the tips given by Chef John on his Food Wishes blog video.

I usually don't rate recipes when I change the ingredients because I like to read the reviews "as is", that is why I gave this 4 stars.  But, I made a couple of minor changes that I hope will be helpful.  I used penne rigate because the little grooves absorb the cheese better,I used half n half because I didn't have any milk, and all I had on hand was velveeta.  I cooked the penne for about 9 min., it will finish baking in the oven.  This was an excellent mac and cheese.  The sauce is so creamy and silky with just the right amount of cheese flavor.  I will most definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Fabulous mac & cheese!  I did change the recipe slightly in that I used a different cheese combo--the processed cheese food as called for (processed cheese may go against nature but, hey, it's really necessary for good mac & cheese--don't fight it!), extra sharp white cheddar, and fresh parmesan.  The white cheddar added a lot of flavor, but the impressive thing about this recipe are the measurements.  Yes, it will look extra saucy, but once it bakes and sets a bit, all of that sauce is soaked into the noodles and it is excellent!  Without this recipe, I would have been tempted to add more noodles when they are not needed.

It is so hard to find a good mac and cheese recipe.  Not anymore!  This one is great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The next time I make it, I will try to substitute the american cheese for something else.  We didn't care for that type of cheese, but it was still delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

My gut instinct when I first read this recipe was that there wasn't going to be enough macaroni.  Nonethless, I made it exactly as directed.  Once baking was finished, I let it sit for an hour to give it time to absorb the cheese sauce.  Sure enough, it was still too "soupy".  I quickly cooked up another cup of macaroni (total, 2-1/2 cups) and stirred that in.  Perfect!  On Day two I stirred in some chunks of leftover Christmas ham and it made a yummy lunch. Other than the shortage of macaroni, this was absolutely delicious, and will definitely go into my rotation.  Thanks Mouse... this is a winner!

I forgot to include the breadcrumbs, but it was still delicious! I used 1lb Velveeta, about 4oz american/cheddar mixture, 4 oz colbyjack, and 8 oz muenster. I did have to leave out some of the cheese mixture as it wouldn't fit in my pan.

This was good, made it for Christmas dinner. I upped the noodles to an entire box (it was 12 or 14 oz) of rotini noodles. With the addition of the extra noodles I needed to use a 2.75 qt baking dish, but baked for the same amount of time.

This stuff is dangerously good. Followed the recipe with the exception of the mustard powder (I didn't have any but will definitely use it next time) and it's SO delicious. This is the first time I've made mac & cheese from scratch and I think it will definitely be my staple recipe. Thank you!

Made it exactly as written. Was tasty but there was waaay too much sauce compared to noodles (and I love my cheese). It was almost a soup instead. Will make again but will double the amount of pasta.

I used almost 2 cups of small shells instead of elbow macaroni and I wish I had used more.  I would say either double the macaroni this recipe calls for, or cut the cheese in half.

I've been looking for a baked recipe that I like. For week nites I usually just keep it as a simple stove top deal. This is probably the one I will use. It's easy and cheesy. I was afraid that the liquid would be too much but after baking it was spot on. I would not change a thing. Thank you for posting this!

OMG!!  This is a fantastic mac n cheese dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 2 tbsp melted butter to the bread crumb topping and it turned out great.  The only problem with this recipe is that I could easily eat well over half the dish by myself!  Thanks!!

I like my macaroni and cheese saucy, but this was way too saucy -  there was probably 1.5 cups of cheese sauce left in the pan even after several very saucy servings!  I will definitely use this as my go-to macaroni and cheese recipe, though - the sauce is to die for!  But, next time I will double the amount of macaroni and perhaps thicken the sauce more by adding 2 more tablespoons of flour to the roux.  Yum!

Not enough macaroni for the sauce amount in this recipe. I also would double the macaroni as the recipe calls for. My family and I didn't care for the cheese sauce. It was a bit pastey. I'm going to stick with my traditional mac and cheese made with Cheddar cheese.

This mac and cheese was very creamy and delicious.  The only thing I would do different next time is decrease the pepper to 1/2 tsp.  I thought the cheese to pasta ratio was perfect.  My kids devoured this in no time.

This is very good. Since I havent been able to figure out the difference between American cheese and processed cheese, I just used processed - and a little sharp cheddar. Nearly doubled the mustard and pepper because we like them, and cut back on the oven time a little. Very creamy and good when fresh. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I eliminated the eggs as recommended and also used more of the cheddar cheeses and half & half.  Will definitley make again.

I've made this twice and really like it.  In addition to the mustard powder, I add garlic powder and some minced (dried) onions.  I ran short of yellow cheese while making this yesterday, and threw in about 2 oz. of cream cheese.  It was a good addition, both for flavor and creaminess of the sauce.  Thanks Mouse!

Wonderful!  My whole family raved about this recipe.  It will be a staple here.  I did substitute a 4 cheese blend for the American cheese, but otherwise followed the directions and it turned out great.

I must admit I was a little nervous about trying this recipe. I had a party and made enough for 60 people. I thought I goofed it up and almost didn't serve it. It ended up being the hit of the party! So many people asked me for the recipe! Wow! Thanks so much!

This was GREAT!  If you are looking for a classic, old fashioned creamy style baked mac and cheese, this is the BEST recipe I have ever, ever tried.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I doubled the recipe for a party, added extra black pepper for a little more zip, and threw in a some mozzarella as well, and otherwise made it as is.  I want to make it again right now just thinking about it.

Excellent!!  I made this dish for the first time for my son’s 2 year old family birthday bbq and it was a huge hit.  The kids ate as much as the adults and I had very little left over.  I scaled the recipe up to make 2 pounds of pasta.  As I prepared it, I found that it was too saucy and added another ½ pound of elbows which made it perfect!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

really good really cheesy, I thought it needed some type of veggie in it.  Shredded Carrots or Broccoli mabey.  Even without the vegetables, it was delicious, will be making it again.

2/16/2004 - made it again and added shredded carrots and steamed broccoli(I steamed the carrots after I shredded them)  It was delicious, except I screwed up on the chesse and didn't have as much in as last time because we ran out.  It was still delicious!!

5/20/05 - Finally realized how I did it the first time.  I doubled the sauce and used a whole box of elbows.  Much better that way and gets 5 stars that way, other wise, as written, 4 stars.

Our family loves Mouse's recipe and it is our go-to for 'fancy' mac & cheese (i.e. not a box).  As is, it is great.  Sometimes I don't have the right cheese and shredded cheddar with a hint of cream cheese is just as delicious.

I made this exactly as specified (except doubled, to feed more people). It turned out great. A lot of people that have negatively reviewed this recipe have not followed the recipe (i.e. using bagged shredded cheese, which is not the same people!). Let me just tell you I brought this to my husband's work function, and it was gone (two trays!). Some other wife had brought mac n cheese (even though only I was supposed to) and hers was barely touched. The difference? Creamy goodness. This is a great "creamy but not too creamy" mac n cheese that is still baked. Love it!

This was so tasty!!!  I didn't think it was this easy to make homemade Mac and Cheese!!!! Wow! We make a large batch and freeze some for quick weeknight meals. We added cashew chicken to the bottom of our pan and poured the cooked macaroni and cheese sauce on top. A little salad or veggie on the side, and dinner is done!!!

Awesome mac and cheese recipe but you have to adjust the amount of macaroni. I use 2 1/2 cups otherwise it's soup. Also add a tbs of cooking sherry or white wine.

This recipe is delicious....I love very cheesy mac and cheese. The changes I made were to switch out about half the noodles for finely chopped cooked cauliflower (I try to make it a little healthier) and added toppings like tomatoes and bacon after cooking. I will make this again. You could definitely play around with the cheeses like so many others have already mentioned. Will make again

I've made this for my family several times and taken it to a party as well. Both kids and adults love it. Recipe is perfect the way it is! I have used shredded cheddar and shredded Mexican cheese with the Velveeta/American cheese depending on what I had at the time and we've never been disappointed.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

We tried using prepared mustard since another reviewer said it was fine to sub if you didn't have the mustard powder, but it was VERY mustardy tasting.  It was still delicious, but we will try half or no mustard next time.

Hmmmm.  I'm having a hard time rating this recipe - and I want to say that I made it exactly as stated with the only change being to put a bit less pepper in it.  Although the taste was okay, the consistency of the sauce was grainy, just like some of the other reviewers had commented about.  I wanted the sauce to be ultra smooth and creamy, making your mouth water to taste this the minute you laid eyes on it.  But instead it had this odd appearance, almost looking like the sauce had separated.  The taste was okay, but the entire dish was a bit "gummy", like there was too much macaroni (ironic, since this recipe has been praised for its macaroni to cheese ratio). In the end, I was disappointed.  A boxed macaroni and cheese dinner tastes better, is cheaper and takes far less effort and time to make.  Welcome back, Kraft Shells and Cheese dinner.

My husband loved it… but I wasn't a huge fan. But as far as homestyle Mac n' Cheese, it was the best recipe I've found. 
Only 3 stars because it does NOT keep well. Eat it right when ready or don't eat at all.

I made this recipe and the fam declared it a new Sunday standard. We didn't adjust the macaroni and loved it as is. We have thought about changing up the cheese and using this as a base for protein dish. I agree that keeping 1/2 if the ratio of cheese processed will help to keep the dish creamy. We are thinking Lobster Mac. Yum!

Made as directed with a couple changes: 1 bag shredded cheddar and about 8 slices American cheese for the cheese, and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tap nutmeg to the flour mixture. Added 1 c finely diced gala apple to the final product before baking. Yum! Can tell this is a great basic Mac n cheese and it will be fun to play around with. Thanks!

This is my favorite mac n cheese recipe!!!  It's so easy to make and so, so creamy & cheesy!  I leave off the bread crumbs now and broil it for the last 3-4 minutes to get the top golden.  Definitely one of the best recipes I've ever tried on Allrecipes!!

Both my husband and daughter did not like the pepper in the recipe.  This means a lot from my husband since he likes everything.

This was good, but not great. Too bland for me so I will not be making it again.

You're going to want to add more noodles, don't do it!  I made this recipe twice.  The first time I added extra noodles because the proportions just didn't seem right to me.  I made it a second time exactly as written and it was much, much better.  The noodles absorb all the liquid.  Do not add more noodles!!

Super easy and the husband loved it also. I used half and half. I think this even beats my mother's recipe! As I was covering it to put it in the fridge after supper, my German Shepherd was watching my every move. So I plopped a couple cheesy macaronies into his mouth and he loved it too! Who'dathunk it!?

I wasn’t sure if I was going to make this particular mac and cheese, but when Heather on the Buzz said this is her go to recipe for mac and cheese, I knew it had to be a good one.  This is deliciously creamy.  I used deli cheese ends so it was a mish-mash of different cheeses and it came out perfect.  Comfort food at its best.

We enjoyed this. I'll hang on to this recipe for pot lucks.  Thanks! I do add an additional 3/4 cup uncooked macaroni. It can dry out a bit  in the oven , especially if not served right away.

Amazing! Best mac and cheese I ever had! This was my first try at making real mac and cheese and it turned out better than I expected! The only thing I did different was a little bit extra flour ( 1 tsp and it probably didn't matter much) and I used SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE instead of the American. It gave it so much more flavor! This is 100% a keeper! My boyfriend said I am never allowed to touch a boxed macaroni and cheese again! TRY IT!

My family loved this! I didn't have velveeta so I used shredded cheddar and american. It was still very creamy and had a delicious flavor and texture. I will definitely be using this for our comfort food night from now on.
Update: I made this again tonight with the velveeta, american, shredded cheddar and a small amount of parmesan. FABULOUS! Served it with french rolls with a sprinkle of garlic powder and parmesan. I just LOVE this recipe.

I thought this was very good. I had to use Velveeta and Mild Cheddar cheese since i could find cubed American cheese. I also added paprika sprinkled on top. Two of my kids loved it, but unfortunately, the one who would normally eat the leftovers, didn't care too much for it.

Absolutely perfect!  I did reduce the pepper to 1/2 tsp, and because I had only superfine ground mustard used only 1/2 tsp.  Excellent!

Excellent!  Whole family loved it.  Only change I made was to add a few shakes of worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp of onion powder.  I also used extra sharp cheese (what we like)!  Will make again!

Yummy! Converted to 14 svgs for 1 lb elbows. Based on other reviews I decreased American chz to 8oz. (I used shrp cheddar). Didnt have evap milk so used 4c 1% milk. No need to salt pasta water since cheeses are quite salty. Also halved butter & used unsalted. Everyone enjoyed it! Thx!

This was delicious!  Mine thickened up completely - even using vanilla soy milk (which was all I had in the house :)).  The only thing I would do differently next time is to use a larger covered container to bake in - at 400 degrees it boiled over and was all over the inside of my oven!  A deeper dish next time, but delicious all the same.

Hi Mouse! 
Excellent recipe. Just a little tweak - I also added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of parmesan to give it a little more taste!  Thanks for the easy recipe - My husband loved it :)

Excellent recipe as is.  The noodles soak up the sauce.  I get raves every time I make this.  I like to assemble this the night before, cover with aluminum foil and stick it in the fridge.  When I get home from work I preheat my oven as noted in the recipe.  You should check the dish after the recommended cook time.  It will probably need another 5 to 10 minutes.  A great prepare ahead dish.  Thanks Mouse.

I made this Jan 2012 exactly as written except I substituted 4 oz. sharp cheddar and 4 oz. American cheese for the 8 oz. American cheese.  I also didn't have mustard powder so I put in a couple tsp. yellow mustard.  Like another review said it was really soupy but then the macaroni soaked up all the soup and it came out of the oven NOT soupy at all and the kind of dried up after refrigerating and re-heating.  I would make again b/c it was good but would also like to try some other recipes on this site to see if there was one that I would rate 5 stars!

It's perfect just the way it is! So creamy and smooth. The only thing I changed was that I cut the milk in half and added 1 C heavy cream (I only did this because we're low on milk).

Delicious! My first time making mac n chz from scratch and was very impressed. Followed the recipe exactly. Big hit with the boyfriend. The 2nd time I made it I chopped and sauteed some onions with the butter which added another layer of flavor.

I don't think I'm writing a fair review because I tweaked this recipe (due to husband's preferences).  I omitted the mustard powder and bread crumbs and used muenster and mild cheddar cheeses.  It was VERY good!  I will use this recipe again.

Very tasty! You definitely can double the amount of pasta called for - there is a TON of sauce. The first time we made it we ate all the pasta and the casserole was still 1/3 full of cheese mixture. The next time we doubled the pasta and it was just right.

We used Velveeta and white cheddar (got that instead of American by accident) and we loved the mix. The next time we made it we used only sharp and white cheddar and we definitely didn't enjoy it as much as when it had Velveeta.

Four stars because the pasta to sauce ratio is so far off. The flavors are great, though.

I made this as written and was really disappointed.

Velveeta and American aren't real cheese! I get that you need at least one of them to get the macaroni nice and creamy, but still, processed cheese just isn't a very good flavor.

On the point of flavor, this is very one-dimensional. There's a lot of black pepper, which is a spice I typically don't mind, but in this recipe, it's very obvious and noticeable. I would have preferred a mix of pepper, or at least something to make the flavors a little more complex.

It wasn't so bad I had to throw it out, but I won't make this again.

This was the best mac and cheese that I've made, after testing several popular recipes on this site. I added a sprinkle of parmesan on top, and Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter on top. That gave it some extra flavor that everyone loved. I will definitely be making this at Christmas!

This is a very smooth textured mac and cheese except I found it a little bland. Will add salt, onion powder and try with some sharp cheddar next time.

Sorry but American "cheese" and Velveeta aren't even real cheese.  So many good mac & cheese recipes on this site.  At least use REAL ingredients.

I rated this four stars as a result of incomplete instructions.  Those who have complained about the raw flour taste have a point.  When making the roux, the flour and butter must be stirred on low heat constantly until the color becomes a light nutty brown.  If the color gets too dark, the bechamel sauce will have a burnt flavor.  If the color is too light, the flavor will be of raw flour.  As soon as the color is right, slowly pour in room temp milk and stir until thickened.  Then add mustard powder, black pepper and cheese.  I went against my better judgment and made this recipe as stated the first time and the results had the raw flour taste.  After making the roux properly the second time it was much better!

I also used shredded cheddar instead of American cheese and 1/2 of the mustard.

OK, I have been trying to find the perfect mac and cheese recipe. This one, the day we made it, it had a strange texture, and tasted ok. Put it in fridge, next day, warmed it up in micro...OMG! i couldnt get enough of it, found myself craving it at work after. So day of, prolly a 3 star, day after a 5 star easily. Next time I might make the day before, and heat it up next day

I doubled the recipe for a full-size dish and it was awesome! For the American cheese, I used a package of slices and that worked well. I also didn't have mustard powder so I used 1 tbs of spicy brown mustard and it added the perfect amount of spiciness! Cooked for just about 25 mins and it was perfect.

Wow!  So good and cheesy but hey- it's Mac and cheese!  only thing I would adjust is to go a bit lighter on the pepper.  I used half velveeta and half shredded cheddar - yum!

Amazing mac and cheese!  Get asked to make this all the time.  Lately, I used shells and they worked really well at capturing the creamy cheese!
Also, I have been using the mixed cheese ends from the deli counter (lower price). I look for mostly White American, but the few other kinds mixed in didn't hurt at all.

Outstanding Mac & Cheese!  I made it pretty much as directed except that I cut back on the dry mustard.  I also added some grated Parmesan cheese (I think you could add just about any cheese you have in your fridge and it would just make it better).  I agree with others who have said not to add more macaroni.  If your liquid is too soupy, you may have overcooked the macaroni.  The six minutes suggested in the recipe may even have been a bit long.  You want it firm but not crunchy.  It will continue to cook in the oven and soak up some of the liquid.  You can also leave the caserole in the oven longer and that will thicken it as well without affecting the taste at all.  I sprinkled some broken up pieces of thinly sliced deli ham on top after it had been in the oven about 7 minutes.  The ham browned nicely, added wonderful extra flavor and made the presentation more interesting.

This recipe has a good favor (the mustard cheesy  flavor) but there is too much liquid sauce and I follwed the recipe to use American and velveeta cheese and it was too much of that fake cheesiness..I think mac and cheese recipes are good when they have a blend of 'fake' cheeses like velveeta and american and other kinds of cheeses.

This is a very rich mac n cheese.  I would suggest to use it only as a side dish not the main dish.  Also, 1 tsp pepper is too much.  Maybe 1/2 or 3/4?

It was very good and super chessy. I made the recipe to the tee and as the dish cools on your table it gets thicker and thicker. I don't like that and to warm it up you needed to add milk. Other than that it was pretty good and next time I'll put more milk in it.

This mac'n'cheese is very creamy! I made this with 4oz sharp cheddar & 4oz american & 8oz velveeta, and used only 1/2tsp pepper. My husband & son really enjoyed the creamy texture of this, but not the cheese flavor. My husband wants me to try to combine this recipe with another one I make that has a flavor he enjoys better. I gave this 4 stars because of its easy preparation & great texture, just not the right cheese for this family. (i will post my recipe if it turns out for us!)

I made this last week and it turned out great.  Really the only changes I made were the type of pasta I used and instead of the Velveeta cheese I used a sharp white cheddar (I'm trying to get away from processed ingredients when I can).  Even my husband who thinks I go a little nutty with cheese in my mac and cheese attempts thought this was perfect!

I made this for my 2 year old neice for a party.  This is all she talks about!  She even has her mom calling me to make it for her.  I used whole wheat macaroni elbows and like the other reviewers used (2) 8oz bags of organic shredded cheese.  From the mouth of my neice - this is yummy and she loves Aunty's mac and cheese...sorry mouse.  :)

A few people suggested to double the noodles.. DO NOT do that!  Keep to the recipe!  I followed exact, and it turned out wonderful; even my picky husband even commented on it.  When you prepare the sauce, it may seem excessive compared to the noodles, but once you mix everything up and bake it, the noodles soak up a lot of the sauce.  It turns out perfect and creamy.  YUM!

This is my family's favorite!  It's special enough to be served during the holidays and easy enough to eat with Monday's meatloaf.  I always double the recipe for the holidays, cause it tends to go fast!  You'll never go back to the boxed kind again!

Yum...I made it with Velveeta and sharp cheddar.  Because I have made this before and I like it, I added cut up small onion, garlic powder, the mustard, and a little bit more than a teaspoon of Worstershire sauce and a shake of red pepper flakes (I put tobasco on it after it's cooked because I like it hot!)  Soooo good.

The only changes we made were we used sharp cheddar and added a protein.  This was fantastic - even a guy who doesn't like mac & cheese thought it was excellent.  This is a good base recipe that we'll try adding different proteins and/or vegetables to.  The reviews were conflicting about whether there was enough macaroni.  We were skeptical about the consistency of it when we put it in the oven, but it turned out to be perfect when it was done - we're glad we didn't add more macaroni.  The breadcrumbs migrated a little so that some areas didn't have any at all.  Next time we'll try baking it for awhile to let it set up and then add the breadcrumbs.

I thought this was really good! It's different than Southern mac 'n cheese, as the Velveeta and American cheese make it a much smoother macaroni. I doubled the amount of flour when I made the roux, which seemed to alleviate the issues others had with the sauce not being thick enough after cooking. My advice is to ensure the sauce is thick prior to adding the macaroni. Cooling will also thicken the sauce. Though the presentation isn't as nice, waiting until the next day ensures the macaroni is thick and the taste is still divine!  If you're looking to try a different mac 'n cheese, try this one.  You won't be disappointed if you are a cheese lover like me!

Delicious, Mouse!!! My whole family LOVED it and they normally don't like homemade mac & cheese. I made this exactly like the recipe said. I couldn't find a block of American cheese so I used 8 oz worth of the sliced American cheese and it worked just fine =) I'll definitely be making this again!

Super cheesy and creamy but it was a little too thick for my taste. Would probably use more milk/less cheese next time.

Great recipe! I didn't have any Velveeta, so instead I substituted Kraft 4-cheese Italian blend, and also used medium cheddar instead of the American cheese, since I'm Canadian (smiles to my southern friends!). I did increase the amount of pasta up to 3 cups as one person suggested, but I wish I didn't - there was a little too much pasta, so the sauce-to-pasta ratio wasn't quite right. I'll keep the recommended amount of pasta next time. Cooking the pasta to al dente is imperative... 6 minutes was just perfect, don't over cook it. The pasta really does absorb the cheesy-goodness while baking. Also as suggested by others, I cut the bread crumbs in half, and added about 4 Tbsp of grated Parmesan cheese - this was a good move, and I'll make that a permanent change in the recipe.

Yummy! The only difference I made was using 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese in place of the American cheese. Delicious comfort-food recipe, and so creamy and warm! I will be making this again and again, for sure. Be careful during step two - stir constantly, as it says, because it can burn easily in this stage. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Comfort food at it's best! This is a perfectly creamy mac and cheese. After digging through my massive seasonings/herbs cabinet I discovered I didn't have dry mustard, so subbed prepared yellow mustard. Followed exactly, but did throw in a handful of shredded cheddar in the mix and topped it off with more shredded cheddar, omitting the bread crumbs completely. Baked covered for 15 then uncovered for 10 minutes. Daughter had mac & cheese from new soul food restaurant, as a friend was raving about it, saying best she ever had. However, my daughter said this topped the restaurants by far! YUM! YUM! YUM!

This is my new favorite.  I've made it 3 times in the last few weeks!  I've tried my own variations and this is a very forgiving recipe.  My only advice is to make it once as written, then play.  Can't thank Mouse enough for sharing this!

This was delicious!  I added cubed ham but that was the only change.  I thought it would be too strong with pepper when tasting before baking but it turned out perfect.  I may try cheddar or a gouda next time.  Thanks for  the recipe!

I really hate it when people change a recipe and then give it a bad review when it didn't turn out right. Pretty lame- anyway, this was a fantastic recipe. The kids and adults at my table raved about it. I followed it exactly as described without changes and everyone loved it. It does get the cheese absorbed if you let it sit for an hour and I think it is better that way; sticky and yummy! But if you like it very creamy, served it right after coming out of the over. Either way, it's great.

Very good, super cheesy and creamy. Reminds me a bit of Old Country Buffet's mac and cheese. This did turn out a bit gritty, but stil very good. I used a mixture of extra sharp cheddar and montery jack cheese in place of the american. I also didn't use the bread crumbs, instead sprinked with a little more cheese the last 5 minutes and a few dash's of smoked paprika. I also doubled the noodles as suggested by others and this still had a TON of sauce, next time I may even more than double the noodles. I think without the additional noodles this would have been like a cheese soup with noodles!

Oh my gosh! I was SO happy with this recipe! Absolutely delicious! The only change I had to make was I used shredded mexican 4-cheese blend since I could not find American cheese. Everything else was made exact and I LOVED it! Absolutely do not be scared when you see the cheese sauce is too runny before baking. Once you bake, it becomes absolutely PERFECT! Thank you for this recipe - I will make again and again!

Great recipe!!   Added more salt and pepper for taste.  I used 16 oz of uncooked elbow macaroni.  Making it for my son's first birthday party since mac and cheese is one of his favorites!

This is the first time I've tried making my own cheese sauce for homemade macaroni and cheese... I was a bit nervous as to whether I'd like the sauce, but this is delicious, and I will be adding it to my recipe box. I followed the recipe exactly, and this came out perfect. The bread crumbs just add the perfect touch too! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Plus side: Very creamy, nice texture.  Down side: It was just macaroni & cheese.  Nothing special.  Not good, not bad - just mac and cheese.  If I were to make it again, I'd add more mustard and stir in some sharp cheddar.

This is cheesy and easy, but too creamy cheesy for our tastes.  I would make it again, however, I'd increase it to 3-5 c. of noodles instead.  And likely add broccoli or cubed ham to round it out to a meal.  Thanks Mouse!

Yummy!!!  I used 16 ounces of Velveeta instead of 8 oz. Of American cheese and 8 oz. of processed cheese and it turned out great.  I also used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs for the top. I used the amount of macaroni that the recipe called for and it was nice and creamy.

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe I have tried so far.  I can't wait to try different cheeses in place of the velveeta.  My only complaint was too much pepper!  I should have caught that, 1 teaspoon is a lot of pepper!  It was still very good.  I will use this recipe again and again!

TOO MUCH BUTTER.  By the end of my meal, all I could taste was butter.  Next time, I'll half the butter.  Consistency was good, although it did seem like a lot of sauce before baking, but once it was out of the oven the ratio was better, but maybe still a little too much sauce.  I'll make it again, but I'll reduce the butter and may not bake it, but I'll double the macaroni.  This was very easy and had a nice flavor (minus the butter).

Everyone loved this mac and cheese! I had never made home cooked mac and cheese so I thought it looked a little funny when I took it out of the oven, but it turned out wonderful! I used 16oz of velveeta but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

My kids and husband loved this.  Even my daughter who hates the boxed mac and cheese loved it.  I substituted shredded mild cheddar for the American cheese and Velveeta, only because I can't find either one where I live.  Will definitely make again!

The only reason why I did not give this 5 stars is because of the noodle/cheese ratio like many other reviewers have stated. At first when I saw how few noodles there were I freaked out and boiled extra just in case, turns out I thought I needed them because there was so much sauce and the sauce was thin. Well that was a mistake adding extra noodles because after it was baked it came out a little dry for my liking so luckily i reserved some sauce to pour over my mac & cheese. This recipe tasted great and if you want cheesy and creamy mac and cheese then DONT add extra noodles.

I have the recipe for 6 servings memorized! That is how often I make this. But instead of yellow American I use white American cheese, it is delicious.  I love this and it has become a favorite among myself and my family and friends. They all adore it, even the ones who claimed not to like Macaroni and Cheese. I have also been experimenting with different cheeses. It is so fun!

OMG! This recipe is awesome! So simple and delicious. I made this for our yearly Christmas party with friends and they devoured it! I don't even normally like homemade macaroni and cheese..what can I say I like my Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, but this recipe is a keeper! I substituted colby/monterrey shredded cheese for the american and it still came out great!

Perhaps it's because I couldn't find American cheese and had to substitute a mozza/cheddar blend, but it had the Kraft Dinner taste to me.  Too much velveta and needed a lot of salt and pepper. Sorry didn't work for me.

My kids love home baked macaroni and cheese. I tried switching this up a bit after making it as stated...still used Velveeta but added shredded Monterey Jack as the second cheese. It blends well with the Velveeta taste and still stays creamy. I also have since omitted the flour. I don't think you need it. I use skim milk & 2% Velveeta to help on the fat content. Although, comfort food, such as mac and cheese, is not usually low fat!

This is a PERFECT recipe. I make this for my friends all the time and everyone asks for the recipe. It's also one of the first things my sister asks me to make when she's visiting. The black pepper/ mustard combo is great. I've used all kinds of pasta and my favorite is either small shells or rotini. You can add some extra pasta to stretch the recipe for feeding more people, but the sauce to pasta ratio is perfect as written. It will cook down quite a bit when you put it in the oven. One of my favorite recipes from this website.

this is pretty much the only mac and cheese i make.  the only change i have made is to use 1 tsp of seasoned salt in lieu of the pepper and mustard powder.  sometimes i used crushed buttery crakers mix instead of bread crumbs and mix in a little shredded cheddar for a nice crunchy top.  i love creamy baked mac and cheese and this is creamy and cheesy.   it also works well for stove top mac and cheese, just double the macaroni, cook it until it's just tender and add to the cheese sauce.  also, it reheats very well.  my 7 year old won't touch mac and cheese, unless it's this stuff.  i just have to tell him it's "mommy's mac and cheese".  i get many requests from my family to make this.  i've made it so many times, the recipe is memorized.  better than the box, by far.  YUM-YUM!

I have always had a little trouble with getting a creamy mac and cheese, but this one worked really well.  I agree with the other reviewers add added an additional 1/2 cup macaroni.  I also added some sauteed onions.  Recommend it!

Was looking for a man and cheese recipe to make for my son, and this was really really good! I was skeptical of the mustard powder, but it definitely makes the recipe. I used velveeta and sharp cheddar and a bit more pasta than the recipe called for, but followed the recipe otherwise. Excellent!

I won't be trying this recipe again.  The only thing I liked was the flavor of the seasonings with the pepper, mustard, and flour.  The amount of processed cheeses in this is unreal.  I had cheese sticking to my teeth and fork.  I had to throw away all the leftovers.  next time I'll use different cheeses like some other reviewers.

EXCELLENT! I kept everything the same except I didnt have american cheese, so I put in a mexican blend of cheese's instead, and it was AWESOME! I will do that again in the future, why mess with a good thing? I also omitted the bread crumb topping (personal preference), and I added some garlic salt at the end. For those of you who think the macaroni vs cheese ratio is off and think its too soupy, I feared this as well, but when you blend it all up and throw it in your dish, and bake, it all gets sucked up by the pasta and to me and everyone who ate it, it was the perfect consistency - not "soupy" in the least bit, just perfectly cheezy! This is now our staple Mac & Cheese recipe!

This turned out wonderful! I followed it very closely, only using medium cheddar in place of the american cheese. Yes it does seem like a lot of cheese before it goes into the oven, but it comes out of the oven beautifully. It would be easily modified to taste by adding any number of veggies like peas or even broccoli. Next time I make, which will be very soon, I am going to add diced ham. It may need a little seasoning, and at least a little mustard zips it up. I think that different cheeses in place of the american would be a great way to change it up too! Love it!

I gave this five stars.  I did not use the velveeta only because I am not fond of processed cheese.  I substituted with a brick of extra sharp cheddar and it was fine. I used fresh cracked black pepper which I believe makes all the difference in taste.  My husband can eat this 7 days a week.  This is a keeper.

The BEST. I used the Velveeta and cheddar/jack for the rest. Don't be fooled that it's soupy at first. Firms
up nicely. Double the recipe. Great for potluck or family dinner. Be sure to stir
while blending cheese/milk.

I tried to make this with real cheese instead of processed cheese, and I think that may have been where I went wrong.

Very good. My family loves this recipe!!
Smoked or sharp cheddar takes away from any fake cheesy taste from the Velveeta.

I did not use the bread crumbs or the mustard. It came out good, my husband liked it, but it did not have the creaminess I was looking for. Tasted good as leftovers, but the sauce looked broken. I'll be looking to see if I can improve upon the texture.

A few weeks ago I made this for a group of preschool children.    they wanted Mac and Cheese and I didn't have a box.  Si I looked around until I found this.  When I saw my friend Shannon made it and I know how she likes her cheese so I picked this one.  It had a nice cheesy flavor.  I like another Mac and Cheese recipe on this site better tho...so I don't know if I will make it again.  Thanks Mouse!

I've tried many mac and cheese recipes, and haven't liked any of them.  This is by far the best.  Perfect texture, great flavor.

One thing:  I wish I'd thought to put a cookie sheet under the casserole.  It boiled over, made a mess of the oven, and smoked up the house.

I made this recipe while trying to find a staple side dish for BBQ's and I have to say I found it!  Everyone loved it.  Like others, I sauteed onions and garlic in the butter, used more noodles, used a mexican cheese mix, and half/half instead of milk.  I'm not a fan of baked macaroni, but I really enjoyed this one.  I will definitely make again!

This was really good and easy. Much better than "the box". My husband and kids like the creamier mac and cheese. I like both kinds, this was definitely a hit, especially if your family likes super creamy mac n cheese without the sharp cheddar bite.

I did not have processed cheese, but it was still great!  Next time I will use that, and seasoned bread crumbs.  I also used a squirt of mustard instead of powder.  My 3 picky kids really liked it and will LOVE it with a little more seasoning and the right cheese combo.

This recipe is the absolute best! My youngest is a very picky eater and loves it! The first time I made it I didnt have any mustard powder and substituted with actual yellow mustard and still came out great! Tastes like the kind you get in a restaurant. Thanks for sharing!

The kids really liked it (of course) and I thought it was okay.  It was really cheesy and I didn't really liked the seasoned bread crumbs on the top.  I might try a recipe with cheddar next time instead.

This was just what I needed!  We had friends coming for lunch - and it was quick and easy.  We used a light version of Velveta, and a mix of American and Cheddar cheese for the rest.  It when mixing it looked quite "saucy," but after baking it was just right.  We reheated it for dinner, just added a little extra milk.

Very good.  I made changes to suit my families taste.  I only use about 2oz of Velveeta and 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese, grated. I add about 1 tsp of Franks Hot Sauce, too.  I also use about 3 cups milk ..we like it nice and saucy.  For the topping, I grate 2 slices of French bread in the food processor and mix with 2 Tbsp of melted butter and spinkle on top.   I bake it, uncovered, at 350 in an 8"square pan.

I have been making this dish over the years and it has been fine.
I decided to make this dish for 4 people and proceeded to prepare it. I poured the mac into the sauce that was thick & smooth and the sauce was not thick enough. It was thick when I was stirring it to become thicker. I had to add more macaroni and I baked it. the recipe said to add 11/3 cups of milk to 1 cup of mac which is was I did and the sauce was runny and not as thick  as it should have been. Very disappointed indeed!!!!!!!

I loved this Mac n cheese! Unfortunately I made one change that really turned off the kids: I subbed mild cheddar for the American cheese. This makes the cheese sauce just a tad more gritty. American and velveeta will make a completely fast food type of smooth you might not get with “real” cheese!

This recipe was to die for!  I am a senior, have cooked my entire life - including so, so many mac & cheeses.  It NEVER dawned on me to add "Velveeta" to my cheese for the mac & cheese.  But wow!  Double wow!  I didn't have American, so used extra sharp cheddar and followed the recipe exactly.  The creaminess was outstanding and the flavor - without adding any salt, was phenomenal!  Totally loved it!

I made three previous recipes before finding this one and it’s perfect! Everything I was looking for but couldn’t find. Creamy, smooth, doesn’t dry it and rehears well! If you double the macaroni on this, it won’t be as creamy. When I first made it, I thought “boy, this is pretty soupy”. But I’m glad I tried the original before adjusting anything. As it bakes, the sauce thickens and the macaroni absorbs dome of it. This is why I it is perfect for leftovers! I’ve made this probably 6-8 times now since Thanksgiving 2017. The only thing I occasionally change is I’ll use Krafts 4 cheese blend instead of straight American. It comes out just as good! Try this! Try the original before making changes ??

Love! Love! LOVE! Didn't change a thing, and the other reviews are spot on by saying NOT to add more macaroni. I've been searching for the perfect mac and cheese recipe for two years and this is it. The secret is in the processed cheese. It's not the healthiest but since when was comfort food healthy? ;)

Easily the creamiest Mac and cheese I’ve ever made and the easiest.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting freshly grated regular cheddar for the American cheese.  In my opinion, the recipe’s amount of macaroni was just right.  Compliments flowed around the table last night and a guest just emailed a request for the recipe.  Will double this for Christmas dinner.  Mouse has a winner with this one.

I heartily recommend this recipe. Excellent mac and cheese. But I think I'll skip the breadcrumbs next time, unless I uncover the dish for the last few minutes. Plain, unbrowned breadcrumbs don't do much for me. And resist the urge to add more macaroni; the dish will tighten up and you'll be glad you stuck to the recipe!

The first time I made this, I felt the American processed cheese was too overpowering a flavor, so the second time (and every time after that), I used shredded sharp cheddar with the velveeta. I love it!

My two picky boys loved this dish! I added extra noodles because they aren't a fan of too much sauce.

I modified it to make it the BEST mac n cheese I've ever had in my life. Hands down. Those of you who don't like modified reviews, please move on. I sauteed 1/2 small onion in butter and added adobe seasoning to that. I crumbled 1 lb hamburg in a separate pan and sprinkled a little bit of worcestershire sauce in the hamburg (this added so much flavor). I added a 1/2 tsp. of better than bullion (chicken flavor) to the milk/onion/flour mixture (before I added the cheese), and a tiny dab of brown mustard, this creates so much depth of flavor. I then mixed the hamburg in with the cooked macaroni, mixed the cheese sauce in with that and baked it with the bread crumbs on top. Literally to die for.  I used half velveeta and half shredded cheese mixture. It doesn't get better than this.

Excellent! It may seem to have too much sauce before baking, but it does come out good with the proportions listed. I halved the recipe and also added a little Worcestershire sauce and onion powder to the cheese mixture. For the cheese, I had about a cup of shredded mozzarella that needed to be used, so I went with that as well as Velveeta and sharp cheddar, all combining for a great cheese flavor. I also topped it with crushed buttery round crackers mixed with melted butter and some garlic powder.  Keeper of a recipe! Thanks  Mouse!

I have a mac and cheese addiction... the struggle is real. This is my go to recipe. I've been making it for years. DON'T make any changes. It seems like too much cheese, but once you bake it, it is the perfect consistency. Skimping on the cheese or adding more mac will result in a final product that is stiff and slice-able: Not the creamy, gooey goodness that you're shooting for. I follow the recipe exactly, unless I decide to get a little naughty and add in some caramelized onion and sprinkle crispy bacon on top. I'd give this six stars if I could.

This is the only Mac and cheese my boyfriend will eat. Don't adjust anything. As the pasta sets, it absorbs the cheese, but I feel a good Mac and cheese should be a little "soupy". Best Mac and cheese EVER!

The taste was great but after it sits for 5-10 minutes it turns in to a globby mess.  It sticks together and hardens.  I am still looking for recipe that is smooth and tasty and more liquid.

Seriously THE BEST mac and cheese! Reminds me very much of my favorite restaurant macaroni. Only minor change I made was to use two cups of large elbows.

Made the recipe exactly as listed.  I was very skeptical while preparing it as the amount of liquid sauce seemed to drown the amount of pasta.  In the oven the magic occurred and the highly liquid sauce was absorbed / cooked down to a beautiful extra-creamy thick sauce that was perfect for the amount of pasta.  Don't add extra pasta, it would ruin the ratios!

I found this recipie and started making it in December 2014. I haven't changed anything except topping the bread crumbs with grated Parmesan before I bake it. I eyeball the pasta when I dump it in the pan and it turns out great. My boyfriend's daughter loves it. She hovers in the kitchen, "Is it done yet?"

Our favorite, only change is the pepper! we use about 1/8 th tsp.  Other than that, the kids ask for it when I come visit. I've brought it to pot lucks and it gets devoured.

Great, easy recipe.  Only two complaints: WAY too much black pepper!  And, I agree with other reviews that the noodle/sauce ratio was way off. I doubled the pasta and it was just about right.

Prepared as recipe states, minus the breadcrumbs, as I just do not enjoy them on mac-n-cheese. The Velveeta did not overwhelm the dish, which pleased me. My picky sons both enjoyed it and asked for seconds! Will make again.

Hi All, This recipe is fantastic! - did as one reference mentioned, added 2 Tbls of minced sweet onion, reduced the flour to 1 Tbls and added 1/2 Tsp salt then sauteed with butter before adding milk mixture.  Was afraid of the sauce/pasta ratio as well but turned out perfectly once cooked.  Huge Hit!!!

This recipe is amazing AS IS! It's not meant to be a sharp cheese macaroni. It is a very creamy and smooth. Everyone in my house devoured it. Do not add more noodles. I almost thought about adding less. The recipe calls for 1.5 cups of uncooked noodles...I wonder if the folks who suggest adding more are mistaking the 1.5 for cooked noodles?

I love this recipe! I have made this a couple of times now. It is so great that even my picky eating kids devour it. Although, when I make this recipe just for myself,  I sub pepper jack cheese for the American Cheese, and H O L Y  C O W! This gives my favorite food (Chinese food) a serious run for its money.

I followed this recipe as written except for the powdered mustard as I didn't have any. I doubled all the ingredients knowing how my family is with macaroni and cheese.  Everyone loved it, saying it had a great creamy texture, the noodles were cooked perfect and it was the perfect cheesiness.

By far the best Mac and cheese ever! I always receive compliments from it. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe. But you must have your mise en plase ready or you will burn your butter and flour mixture!

This has become our go-to mac and cheese recipe. Works every time with no changes. It's really soupy looking when you put it in the oven, but it comes out thick and creamy. It tastes a lot like Velveeta to me and my kids LOVE it.

I used cheddar instead of American.  Since I first made this 2 months ago my family has requested it 3 more times.  My youngest sister said it was "completely legit." It's a winner in my house.

Loved it. Double the pasta and added some sharp cheddar. Used Cavatelli instead of elbows.

First time ever making a dish like this and it turned out fabulous!!! I did substitute the american cheese with a smoked sharp chedder proportionately. I took it to an easter potluck and everyone admitted having seconds. The dish was empty! I had the host ask for the recipe, and I told her she could find it here! Thank you for a great recipe! Enjoy and share with loved ones!

OMG!  This will be my go-to recipe for mac and cheese!  I have tried other top rated mac and cheese recipes on this site, but this was by far the tastiest and smoothest.  I made a few changes, had some leftover  shredded  mexican cheese blend I needed to use up, so added that to the cheese mixture.  Also, I skipped the whole baking and  breadcrumb bit, just stirred the sauce into the pasta and called it done.  Wonderfully smooth and cheesy, with just the right ratio of cheese to pasta! (I didn't measure out pasta though, just used a 1lb box of med. shells)

bakechef and naples 34102 are right!  I made this for a church gathering and increased servings to 16, using 2# Velveeta and 8 oz. triple cheddar blend with 1# box elbow macaroni (other ingredients scaled to 16 servings as well). Everyone loved it! I was asked to make it again for Easter tomorrow. Great recipe Mouse - thanks! Also see SHICK72's review. These three reviews were the most helpful to me.

Used shells instead. Turned out perfect (shells could have been cooked a tad longer though)!

This is my go-to mac and cheese recipe. Whatever you do, don't add too many more noodles, it will dry out. However, feel free to use any combination of cheeses you like, as long as it adds up to 16 oz total. I don't like Velveeta so I usually do a sharp cheddar and Italian cheese mixture

ThIs should be named "Black Pepper Macaroni and Cheese."  I wish I had read the negative reviews first! Lesson learned. If you are tempted to try this recipe, hold off on adding the black pepper and season to taste as needed.

I do love this recipe it is very very good. I would not change anything. To ensure the mac will not burn a bit only bake it 20 minutes no more than that. My husband liked it A LOT! This recipe is definitely a keeper! By the way, I made half the recipe and used instead the sliced versions of medium cheddar and American cheese packed in single form. The result was just like using lots of Velveeta. If you like thick macaroni and cheese this is a recipe to go for. Do not hesitate using my option, because it will not be runny at all! If this had ended too runny I would have not liked it at all!

Update: I tried this recipe again but this time I did not have the American cheese. To make up of the American cheese I used the same quantity but of Velveeta.  The recipe came out in my opinion even BETTER! This recipe is worth to try.

I thought this was a great and easy recipe! I made a couple changes just for fun and it turned out great! I used medium cheddar cheese instead of American, 3 cups of uncooked shells instead of elbow macaroni, and I added imitation crab to mimic the lobster Mac and cheese from Costco because I've been craving that! I would definitely make this again!

My ten-year-old loved this.  And believe it or not, the leftovers were even better than what we enjoyed fresh from the oven.  This definitely should be baked in a larger casserole dish than what is called for in the instructions in order to avoid boil-overs.  I found 3/4 tsp pepper provided ample spiciness without being overwhelming.

First time I've ever bought or used Velveeta, and I think it all comes down to liking or not liking that artificial cheese stuff taste. We didn't. Not even the kids liked it. Guess we're just a real cheese kinda family.

I tried the recipe and followed it pretty much to the letter. I actually had my son make it (trying to teach him a few life skills) and it turned out great! It was easy (even for my son, the novice, impatient chef). I was skeptical about the amount--thought it would not be enough, so we made two batches (didn't double--but made two separate dishes) and a single one turned out to be PLENTY for four people, including a young man with a bottomless pit of a stomach. Thank you, Mouse! I will definitely make this again. 

One more thing - we didn't even touch the second dish, so I figured the next day serving would be a bit dried out. WRONG! I heated it in the microwave and it was just as delicious as the first batch.

Seemed fine when I pit it in the oven, but after the amount of time in the recipe, it had really dried out.  The taste was fine, just dry.  I would recommend baking it for less time than indicated.

DO NOT DOUBLE THE MACARONI!!! It looks like you should when you mix the pasta with sauce but resist the temptation. 1 1/2 cups only makes 6 servings so I double it but I also double the cheese sauce. The other reviews state that the recipe needs more macaroni and then go on to say it was dry. Duh! If you make this recipe according to directions you will get the most creamy mac and cheese ever. Change the cheese types to suit your taste or what's on hand but do not change the mac to cheese sauce ratio. I made this as another side for the Christmas ham and the mac and cheese led the field with positive comments. This is now my go to mac and cheese recipe. I have no need to try another. I'll just experiment with the cheese. Velveeta and american are more moist than sharp cheddar and mozzarella as examples but it's a personal preference in taste.

We tried this tonight and didn't change anythig expcept we didn't add bread crumbs.  It was very think once it came out of the oven, and witin an hour, was a thick mess.  It tasted good, but wasn't a smooth creamy, more of a thick heavy mac and cheese.  I think next time I will skip the flour mixture and instead add the cheeses and milk.  I will also add minced onion to the mixture.

I loved this mac and cheese. It was so creamy. I'm normally not a big fan of american cheese, but I really liked this. The only thing I would do different would be to not add the bread crumbs. They really didn't do anything for me. Didn't make it any better, or worse, just gave it a different texture that I'm not a big fan of. I will defiantly be making this again!

Excellent! This is definitely my new go-to Mac & Cheese recipe and easier than my other one. My only critique is I felt there was a bit too much pepper. But that is easily fixed. I used Rigatoni noodles because that is what I had on hand and i think the bigger noodles would solve some people's issue with there being "too much" cheese/sauce. I also used White American b/c, again, what I had on hand. I think that is really what made it sooo good. I even used skim milk and it was super creamy! Even the next day leftovers were creamy once re-heated.

I made this ahead so I didn't bake it. Instead, I warmed it up the next day after sitting overnight in the refrigerator and it was delish!  It was nice and creamy...not soupy at all.  The only mods I made were to use a Mexican cheese blend instead of the American cheese, halved the mustard powder and pepper, and used 2 cups of macaroni.  If you choose to bake it, I wouldn't use more macaroni.

FINALLY - a mac & cheese recipe that is creamy, not dry.  I followed the recipe exactly except for tripling it because I was having a party.  I actually didn't stir constantly as it said to do because I kept getting interrupted and it still worked out great.  Yes, it seems VERY soupy when you put it in your casserole dish - don't panic or change anything.  It comes out looking a little soupy too but it's fine.  As it cools, it thickens and is just right.  I do believe this will be the first mac and cheese that may actually reheat and taste decent for leftovers.  Amazing.  I've been searching for this recipe for years.....

Used a 12oz box of elbows, added some diced ham, about 12 oz cheddar, 4 oz American and added a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder and a punch of cayenne for my own taste.  Was GREAT, so I think the ratio of macaroni to cheese is definitely high like other reviewers said, but GREAT recipe!

Great mac and cheese.  I used whole wheat elbow macaroni and half shredded  sharp cheddar/velveeta. The grandkids inhaled it.

Very good!  Tried this last night and everyone loved it.  I would use a little less pepper next time but love that it uses milk instead of cream just to make it less fat.  It was creamy and very easy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Perfect as is but I usually add extra cheddar, jack or whatever I have on hand.  I also like to add shredded cheese to the top.

I had to clean my oven after making this in a 1 and 1/2 quart dish.  It needs a bigger dish.  I made my own bread crumbs.  Very good made according to the recipe.

I have made this for decades, but, I add a dash of Worcestershire, and about a quarter tsp of curry powder to the sauce.   Also good to add some crab meat!

My family gobbled this up! I doubled the recipe but used only 1 tsp. pepper because 2 teaspoons seemed like too much. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out of the oven creamy and delicious. Thank you!

Made this recipe yesterday and it was really good, however, I would have only rated it 4 stars then. Reheated the leftovers today for 20 min. in a 350 oven and it is to die for, definitely 5 stars.

The best comfort food! I always double the recipe, par-boil the noodles and NEVER bake it in the oven. The noodles will absorb the liquid cheese sauce and thicken as it cools.

I don't ever have any luck with homemade Mac and cheese as mine always seems dry... Not this one... This turned out really good... The only thing I would change next time is not boil my pasta quite so long as it cooks in the oven.  Will for make this again

Easy-cheesy, summer-breezy.  This is delicious.  It doesn't have the same consistency of a Mac-n-cheese casserole with egg.  It is like a reeaally good (home-made) version of the stuff in the box, so little kids will love it.  Will definitely make this (many times) again.

This is by far the easiest and best mac & cheese I've ever made.  Every kid at the dinner table loved it...the cheeses were kid friendly, nothing fancy here.  The only thing I did a bit differently was instead of 2 cups of milk I did one cup of fat free half & half, one cup of milk.  I think it made it creamier.  When you make this it will look like you don't have enough pasta in there, don't add more, it absorbs into what you have.  It came out perfect!

I LOVE this recipe!!  It's by far the best homemade mac and cheese recipe I have found.  I have never made it with the cheese it calls for however. I use a random mix of cheese ends you can buy from the deli.  I've made it twice with two different mixtures of cheese and it came out absolutely FANTASTIC both times!! This recipe is to die for.

This was DELISH!  If you have a craving for creamy Mac and cheese...look no further!  I read lots of reviews and I decided to follow the recipe EXACTLY!  Lots of reviews said to double the pasta, it will look like its not enough pasta, but don't increase it!  The pasta is undercooked so it absorbs the sauce.  Also, let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes after coming out of the oven to set up.  OMG this is amazing!

This made a perfect macaroni - creamy and delicious!  I doubled the recipe (except for the pepper and mustard), trading out the American cheese for shredded cheddar (what I had on hand), and poured it all into the crock pot after mixing together.  There was a perfect cheese:noodle ratio.  Yummy!

I have a VERY picky family.  This is the first time anything other than boxed mac and cheese was considered good.  I went ahead and used 2 cups of uncooked mac, but I wouldn't use more than that.  The mustard and the pepper give this that something special that is unique.  It really was delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I went to the store and did not find any American Cheese or the mustard powder. I however got Cheddar and Velveeta so it turned out delicious. Since it is not following the recipe to the exact ingredients it is still so good. and would rate it as to being a great recipe to follow...

This works well with any kind of cheese. I used a combination of Philadelphia cream cheese (1/3 fat/low fat) and extra sharp cheddar (reduced fat) cut into cubes. I used the same amount of total cheese. Everything worked out great.

fabulous!  Not a big mac and cheese fan but made on a cold night recently.  I added extra cheese - some swiss and a very little amount of cheddar (only bc it melts grainy) and subbed 1/2 evap milk + 1/2 skim milk for amount of milk and added dash of worchester for depth - plus I added crumbled bacon as garnish on the top before cooking... changes were recommended by others - glad I tried them - verrrry good! * I didn't use velveeta b/c I can't stand the thought of it - I used 16 oz of white amer cheese.

I don't bake it because the kids don't like a "crust" on top of anything. Delicious baked or just off the stove. Just off the stove, the kids say it tastes just like Outback's kid mac and cheese. Very Yummy.

I made this recipe just as described.  Yes, it will seem liquidy when you put it in the casserole, but take it out of the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes and your family will tell you it is the best mac and cheese they have ever had!  You don't have to change a thing for this to turn out awesome, but you do need to wait a bit after you take it out of the oven.

So I hate using 'processed cheese product' and would usually have skipped this recipe. But I had a ton of leftover pasta and a block of velveeta in the fridge, so decided to make it. This recipe is really outstanding- my husband and kids devoured it. I guess I will have to make an exception to using Velveeta :-)

Really good recipe.  You just might need to make some chages to suit personal taste.  I made it as written the first time and the American cheese taste was a little too intense for our taste.  Family wasnt crazy about the breadcrumbs.  I made it again using cheddar instead of American and crumbled potato chips on top instead of bread crumbs and those chnges did the trick for my family.  I agree with others who say that the sauce/noodle ratio as written works.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is serious Mac & Chz. I was a little overwhelmed by the cheese/noodle ratio but I didn't change a thing and it was fantastic. Do NOT add more noodles. It was perfect and creamy and not an ounce of it went to waste. I forgot the bread crumbs and it was still awesome. I might experiment with some herbs next time for a different flavor but seriously, do not alter the recipe... the cheese thickens up and it is so incredibly good. I will be making this forever!

This was my first adventure in homemade mac and cheese and we love it!  We aren't huge mustard fans so I leave that out and it's still great.  One note, the cheese sauce makes more than what I use to cover the noodles so I usually make veggies to go with it and use the cheese sauce on those!

I had high hopes for this recipe, considering all the positive ratings...but, I honestly wasn't too thrilled with it. It's a lot milder than I'm used to, considering I usually make my mac and cheese with cheddar. The Velveeta paired with the American cheese...they're both really mild cheeses and made it a little bland, in my opinion. It was also a bit too peppery for my taste. Maybe I'm being a little picky, but I'm not a huge pepper fan and I found it kind of overpowering. (Making up for bland cheese?)

As one person stated, I found it thickened up a bit TOO much if you let it sit for a while. But, then again, Velveeta does tend to do that. I've had that issue with Velveeta in the past and actually stopped using it for a while, for that reason. This recipe was my last attempt at making it work...and sorry to say, Velveeta, but you failed. It melts nicely, but KEEPING it melted...that's another story.

Overall, I thought it was pretty middle-of-the-road. It wasn't bad, but I probably won't be making it again. I'll stick with my all-time favorite (so far): Chuck's Favorite Mac and Cheese. It's the most unique recipe I've seen so far (involves cheddar, parmesan, cottage cheese and sour cream) and it's definitely the best I've had so far!

My family loves this stuff.  Yes, it looks really runny when you pour the cheese sauce over the noodles but it cooks up well. I don't care for the bread crumbs, it seems to add a weird boing to the whole thing. I always double the recipe because it goes so fast.

This is my go to dish for parties and potlucks!  It's a big hit for kids and adults alike.  I have passed it on to quite a few people who have eaten it at a party and then wanted to make it at home.  Highly recommended - recipie works as is!!

Kinda read through a bunch of recipes and this one seemed like the best bet. Even then, I used it for inspiration rather than direction. Everything was perfect, I just couldn't get myself to actually eat "processed cheese food/product" so I used more "regular" cheese. Made it a couple times with the sharpest cheddar cheese that was reasonably priced at the time. Lovely.

Not a big fan of this recipe.  I followed the exact recipe and maybe I did something wrong but it tasted kind of grainy to me. It just didn't come out creamy as I was hoping.

This is a great recipe. I made it last thanksgiving and my husband, who usually just eats what is coked, request this macaroni.  He does not eat instant mac, but last time he said he wanted some I was going to get some Velveeta in the box and he surely said, No I want the one you made thanksgiving.  I could not believe that cause he doesn't eat mac and cheese too often.

Pretty good overall, really enjoyed eating it. The only things I would changge is perhaps adding a little less milk - seems to make it more dense. But that's just me :)

This was great mac n cheese. I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was going to be really runny but had read a few reviews that said it would still turn out great and thicken up as it cooked. IT DID and my whole family LOVED IT!!

excellenet, however I added rather than mustard powder 1 tablespoon dijon mustard  and one heaping tablespoon mayo, along with one egg yolk (keeps it separated when heating up leftovers), and 1 tablespoon parsley to the sauce. Added 2 small onions minced  and 1/2 lb crisp bacon and 1/3 cup green onions to the sauce as well. Awesome !

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was fantastic!  Don't increase the amount of macaroni because it does thicken and absorb while baking.  It ends up being very thick and creamy.  My husband loved it!!!

This is such a delicious, easy recipe. I followed it the way it said, but I think I'll make a couple changes when I make it again. The sauce is a little thick, so I think I'd use a bit less flour. I'd also use a little less Velveeta, and add either more cheddar or some pepperjack. Those are just changes I'd make for my preference. But overall, this is really good. My husband took one bite and begged me to make this again once this batch is gone!

This was awesome mac and cheese! Followed the recipe, except I used mixed shredded cheddar and mozza cheese. Topped with italian seasoned bread crumbs and more shredded cheese. I also added a few dashes of chili powder to the cheese sauce. The kids loved it, they said it would be even better with hot dogs mixed in next time. Thanks :)

This is my staple with a couple of changes... I add half an onion before the flour. I add a little hot sauce and I change up the cheese. I like Colby jack or Cheddar with Velveeta best but I through in whatever I have.

Gotta say I won't make it again. It had that sort of coat-your-mouth sort of feeling that was quite unpleasant. Must've been the American cheese. I did like the creaminess very much, so for those who like the recipe, I don't agree with the other reviewers that it was too creamy. The consistency itself was great once it was baked.

Good, but I didn't like the American cheese.  Maybe will try with cheddar in the future.

I've been looking for a proper mac'n'cheese recipe since living in London. Since it's difficult to get American cheese and Velveeta, I used extra mature cheddar and Primula (which comes in a tube in the refrigerated section). Made this recipe as a side dish for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! My English boyfriend said he must had never tasted proper macaroni and cheese before and asked me to make it again the next day. No Primula available nearby, so used about 12 Laughing Cow cheese triangles which tasted great too. Like other people advised - don't worry about the soupy texture before it goes in the over as it bakes nicely and comes out perfect!

This was devine! I used shredded pepperjack cheese rather than the American, and added a bit of minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and regular mustard instead of the powder. The bf scarfed his first bowl down and begun his second before I finished my first. I'm definitely keeping this, thanks mouse!!

although I have not tried this particular recipe, I have looked up cheese sauce and roux recipes to make a base baked Mac n cheese to build on and perfect. being a vegetarian (and cheese and pasta lover) mac n cheese has been a comforting classic. I have made this recipe countless times without even knowing, but instead of American cheese and velveta, (I try not to eat processed foods and the label 'cheese food product'honestly quite scares me) I usually use a 1lb bag of cheddar cheese, probably 4/5 for the sauce and the remaining to sprinkle on top before putting it in the oven. granted, yes, it's not quite as creamy as when you use those processed cheeses, but it does have that 'real' taste. And, you can vary the cheeses, (mozzarella or such for more 'long strings of cheese attached to your fork' or more refined cheeses for a different taste and feel, and in the cheese sauce you can add whatever spices fit your preference, just a little, or a spicy feel or more savory. Perfect base recipe that you can build on for your own taste preferences.

This recipe is fantastic. I was actually threatened by my boyfriend that if I ever made any other kind of macaroni & cheese, he'd kill me! Haha! I, too, felt like there was too much cheese action before I put the dish in the oven... but it comes out PERFECT after. My dish was a double-batch. I used two 8-ounce bags of Kraft shredded cheese, one sharp cheddar and one medium cheddar, instead of the American cheese. I think next time I'll take the foil off toward the end of the bake time to get a nice golden-brown color for the bread crumbs. EXCELLENT recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Like other reviewers said, WAY too much cheese.  Also, the sauce was not creamy...it was a little grainy.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Still baking in the oven, but this smells wonderful! I take everyone's word that the soup will turn into something delicious once it comes out.  We used different cheeses and different noodles: Cheddar & Boursin tub (Garlic & Herb) and medium shells.  My hubby and I are so excited to try it, we're staying up past 10:00 pm for it.  Now that's comfort food if you ask me :)  Thanks Mouse!

This is a REALLY great recipe!  I agree with others who worried it would be too saucy, but after you bake it in the oven it comes out perfect.  It's also great leftover.  Next time I will try it with cheddar instead of the American.  So glad I found this awesome recipe!

1t was wayy too much pepper for kids! They wouldn't touch it after one bite. I added cooked ground meat to tone it down so it didn't go to waste.

This was so good. I made 2 changes. I substituted sharp cheddar cubes for the American.  I am not a big fan of bread crumbs so I used saltine crackers crumbled and tossed in melted butter.  Kept everything else the same per recipe.  Everyone loved it and it was so simple.  Will make again.

This was good and very easy to make, but there was too much pepper for my taste. I feel that it took away from the flavor. I don't like American cheese, so I substituted shredded cheddar and added a few handfuls of a bag of mixed cheeses. I also added dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. As I said before, it's a good recipe, but I would add the pepper at the end.

I used 1 and 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. Saw another's edit of grated onion so I added a heaping tablespoon of yellow onion into the butter at the beginning and it pretty much just melted into the butter. A dash of onion powder also. Didn't have mustard seed so I just did a fuzz over 1/2 tsp of French's yellow. Extra buttered breadcrumbs on top and it was awesome!!!!!!!

This was delicious but I did make the following adjustments:  I used 2 cups of medium shell pasta, added some chopped broccoli and chopped ham and used whatever cheese I had in the fridge which was yellow cheddar, white cheddar, and monterey.  I added onion powder, garlic powder and paprika to the seasoning in the milk mixture.  Then I baked it for 20 minutes and  took the cover off and broiled for another 5 minutes on 400 because my husband and I love the crunchy bread topping.  I used a 2.5 qt casserole dish since I increased the amout of pasta.  This one is a keeper.

Very good basic home made mac and cheese recipe. I use a little less to no American cheese, I don't like the flavor. I think it takes away form the other cheeses. I like American just not on this dish.

I think this is a great recipe and my husband swears it's the best he's ever had! And my kids, who are extremely picky eaters love it! I did make 1 change...I used all Velveeta and no American cheese.  I think Velveeta is much more flavorful.

Good and easy, although I scorched my flour and ended up using cheddar instead of American. I didn't tell anyone and they all ate it, so it's a keeper.

It does need something to make it creamy....it is amazing though. In the future I I would either add a little processed cheese or use the original pasta ratio.

For someone who had always made mac and cheese from a box, I think I fared pretty well. I live in Dubai, so I couldn't find all of the ingredients. I had to use rigate noodles, and I mixed cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan cheeses. I followed the directions with what I had, and was rewarded with a creamy, cheesy casserole of goodness. The noodles are merely a vessel for the sauce, and the rigate noodles soaked it up quite well.

Very good. I followed the recipe as direct, but for flavor I added a finely chopped onion and a clove of garlic. I also mixed sharp cheddar cheese and mild cheddar cheese. It was a hit.

It was a good homemade mac and cheese but I personally didn't really like the bread crumbs on top.

Waaaaaaay too much pepper!!!  I only used 1/2 teaspoon and it was too much!  Sauce consistency to macaroni ratio was good. Will make again but with only a dash of pepper next time.

Great Mac and Cheese!  Like many others, I modified just one thing - and that was using 8oz med cheddar instead of the American.  Turned out GREAT!  It was pretty simple to make, though I did find myself wishing I had an extra hand when I was melting the cheese (didn't want it to burn based on other reviews!) - but that's probably due to my lack of cooking experience.  Anyways, great recipe!!

I made this dish for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  Everyone had second helpings, it was a huge hit!  It was so creamy and cheesy.  The perfect comfort food.  I plan on making it again very soon!

LOVED this and so did my 6 year old! Used mozz in place of the american cheese and used 2 cups of macaroni - I think I could have used a little more pasta as there was quite a bit of sauce left in my bowl but none the less - YUMMY - will definitely make again!

This was really good.  My kids said "How come this tastes like the mac and cheese at the restaurant?" :-)  I only made one change... I used a mixed bag of chedder cheese instead of the american b/c that's what I had in the house.  But I stuck with the recipe with everything else.  Will definitely make again.

This was nice and creamy, but I feel like it needed something a little extra.  Can't quite put my finger on it though.  I did use a whole 16 oz. of Velveeta as I couldn't find any other melty cheese.  I put thin slices of tomato on top of the mac before adding bread crumbs.  It was really good, but I'll have to experiment to find out what else it needs another time.

Delicious!  For those who say it's too cheesy, well that all depends on how you like your mac.  I like it dripping ooey goodness, so this was perfect in my book.  The only think I did differently was to change american cheese (I don't like the taste) with a chedder jack blend.

Everyone loved this!  If you like creamy mac n cheese then this is the best.  I made two changes from the recipe as it was written.  I used the new Kraft Three Cheese Shredded cheese that comes with a touch Philadelphia for creaminess instead of American and I left out the bread crumbs.  So good!

This dish was super simple and amazing! I made it for the first time today (thanksgiving 2010) and it was to die for. Instead of doing 8 ounces of american cheese. I did 4oz of american cheese and 4oz of mild cheddar as another reviewer suggested. I couldn't ask for anything better.

This was soooo easy and sooooo good!  We couldn't find "American" block cheese, so we picked up some medium cheddar, and it turned out great!  I'm going to try it with Sharp cheddar tonight.  Since it's a bit on the unhealthy side, I'm going to try to make it with reduced fat cheese and 2% milk, and we'll see how that goes.  =P

I really liked this. I used what I had in the house which was mozzarella cheese and velveeta. I did add more noodles because there was plenty of sauce and we were feeding quite a few people.

This was good, but I DID make changes as well. I used 2 3/4 cups of elbow macaroni, more like 1/2 cup of bread crumbs on top, and 16oz of cheddar cheese. My husband (who doesn't typically eat macaroni and cheese) ate two helpings.

This I awesome, and so simple! Ive made it twice, first time exact.. Second time minor minor changes. My changes were 2 cups of whole wheat macaroni instead of 1 1/2, and instead of breadcrubms, whole wheat ritz crackers! My hubby loved it. I would say for an entree serves 2 adults and a child. Side dish Easily 4-5!

I made this recipe for my girlfriends on a chilly Fall day and it was such a hit that all of my friends asked for the recipe.  I made it exactly as it said and it was a bit runny so I emptied some of the sauce out and then baked it and it came out perfect.  So delicious.

Best Mac and Cheese Recipe ever - and a good base recipe to start from.  I often change the cheeses around a bit just to change it up, or add ham and frozen peas to the noodles before pouring sauce over them. But this recipe never fails to be great!!!

Oh my! I made this for my birthday dinner party. I had to double the recipe and used Velveeta, sharp cheddar, and smoked cheddar. Everyone has gone home and I am going back for leftovers. It was that good. I am a mac and cheese enthusiast and this was not only easy but super duper delicious!

Great flavor, but I'd make it in a smaller/deeper dish next time (not a 9x13) and use fewer or no breadcrumbs on the top.

This is almost exactly the same as my mom's recipe (which I lost and was looking to replace). I always add tex-mex seasoning, 1 tbsp dijon mustard and a little Frank's red hot sauce to the cheese sauce to liven it up. I'll also add 2 tbsp of tomato pesto if I happen to have it around. I like to take the lid off near the end to let the breadcrumbs brown.

Good recipe. I really liked the consistency once it was cooked.  Was surprised how "not-orange" it looked, more pale yellow.  Could have used a bit of salt.  Very easy, much easier then other homeade mac and cheese recipes.

Easy, great tasting mac and cheese for those who like it mild.  Made it exactly as directed, except used buttered, toasted panko breadcrumbs for the top.  Made it for a 4th of July party along with a spicy version for the adults.  Both the kids and adults loved it.  Mac and cheese is one of my favorite food groups(yes it absolutely is a food group!) and I must have 20 different recipes that I go to.  This is a terrific, easy, creamy version that is perfect for pot lucks and buffets, doesn't dry out and tastes like comfort food at it's best.  Nothing fancy, just yummy.

Wow! I can't wait for this to come out of the oven. I pumped the servings up to 20 to take camping with our friends, but I'm not sure the kids will let it out the door. I was looking for a recipe with Velveeta because I didn't want to loose my shirt buying the "gourmet" cheeses I usually use for the recipe. I replaced the American cheese portion with a blend of Gruyere and Fontina cheeses I had in my fridge. The sauce tasted like a great fondue! Definitely a keeper. Thanks to the Mouse!

Very Good!  I liked this macaroni recipe and it is better than boxed, but I am still looking for the ultimate macaroni recipe!

the best mac and cheese recipe yet!! I did use 16 oz. of velveeta (mild mexican) instead of 8 oz. velveeta and 8 oz. american. I love this recipe! I will certainly make it many more times.

At first all I could think of was "mac n cheez soup", but after baking it (uncovered b/c I did NOT READ it carefully enough *SIGH*) it all absorbed.  My only problem with it is the consistency is a little strange.  It's not as creamy as I would have liked.  It's almost like the cheese "broke down" after cooking; kinda almost grainy :(  I don't know if not covering it had anything to do with it...my 9-yr old liked it though!  Maybe I should make it again COVERED and rate it again ;)   Thank you!

I typically use cheddar to make my mac and cheese and thought that I would give processed cheese a try since my hubby is a fan.... I was VERY disappointed. One review said it tasted like cracker barrells... I thought it was salty and tasted processed! My mom and I threw it away after one bite (although my hubby liked it.) I will not make this again.

This was good although a little grainy.  I used 2 cups of uncooked elbow macaroni and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  My husband enjoyed it more than I did so I'll make it again.

The best macaroni and cheese recipe I have tried. I have made it twice already and my family loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe!
12/13/10:  I lightened this recipe up some.  I used fat free milk, 2% velveeta and 2% cheddar instead of the american.  Tastes just as good!!!

I agree, double the macaroni.  Also add 1/4 t onion powder.  Instead of bread crumbs I crumbled one sleeve of Ritz crackers over the top.

I think this is my favorite mac & cheese recipe so far... The first time I made it the flavor was great but the texture was terrible. I used crushed red pepper flakes in place of pepper and omit the breadcrumbs. I baked it covered the entire time. After I take the foil off & sprinkle Panko breadcrumbs on top and put it under the broiler on low until it was nice and golden brown! I plan on experimenting with the flour next time for an even creamier texture. Great recipe!

This was definately a creamy dish and a great base recipe.  I used a medium cheddar in place of the american cheese.  I also added lots of garlic and onion powder to the cheese mixture.  I'll have to quadruple the recipe for Thanksgiving because I know it will be another huge hit!

Yum.  I took the advice of others and increased the amount of macaroni by 1/2 cup, although I used medium shells instead of elbows.  Also, I used cracker crumbs instead of seasoned breadcrumbs.  With those changes, this recipe is outstanding!  It's my new favorite mac and cheese regular.

I've made this several times now. Since it's a little saucier than other recipes it really freezes well.  I do sub the American cheese with cheddar and omit the bread crumbs as per my family's preference.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I have been preparing this recipe, completely as written for over a year.  This is one of my vegetarian daughter's favorite recipes, as well as my brawny weight-lifting son.  Everyone in my family loves this and calls it the best Mac and Cheese recipe ever.  I think it works better for adults than kids, who favor the boxed variety.

This was a good solid recipe. Originally, I made the noted amount of pasta, but it was quite obviously not enough for the gargantuan amount of cheese sauce (I love my cheese sauce but I felt that the original ratio might have made my stomach churn), so I made an additional 1.5 cups of pasta and the ratio worked better in my opinion. It was still extraordinarily cheesy. I only gave this 3 stars because while it was tasty, it was very heavy, and I found that I couldn't eat a full portion of it. Also, I wouldn't bake this covered as the recipe states, I would bake it uncovered to let the breadcrumbs form a hard crust. Since it was covered, my breadcrumbs did nothing; they were the same consistency when it was baked as it was before.

Doubled the noodles... perfect amount. It is very rich and creamy. If I were to change anything, I might add some sort of seasoning or spices to it. But thats very much a personal decision for different tastes.

So very easy...my daughter requested mac n' cheese for her birthday dinner and I was not about to serve a boxed meal.  Everyone loved it including my picky son.  Very cheesy, great flavor and perfectly seasoned!  I prepared it about an hour before baking and I think that helped soak up some of the cheesy sauce!  Will definitely make this again!

This is an excellent recipe. I have had several requests to forward this on and everyone loves it.  I used velveeta and grated cheddar cheese when I made it and it turns out well every time. I always double the recipe and although the macaroni vs. cheese sauce ration seems out of whack, it turns out to be nice and creamy, the way we like it.

First time I ever made homemade mac n cheese, I thought this came out very good. It was creamy. There's a ton of sauce but it all does get soaked up by the noodles. I didn't have dried mustard so used a t of dijon mustard. It came out great and reheated well.

I tried this recipe and when I put the sauce with the macaroni, it seemed like macaroni soup!  However, I didn't bake it right away (about 2 hours later) and by the time I did bake it, it was perfect.  All that cheesy goodness had been absorbed by the mac!  It was the best mac & cheese I've ever made!

Such a great basic recipe, fun to experiment with different cheeses.
The mustard gives it a wonderful flavor to compliment the cheese.

I liked this recipe but I did feel it was too full of sticky processed cheese, but it didn't stop me from enjoying it.  It would have been too soupy, so I doubled the noodles and it turned out perfect.  I also left off the bread crumb topping.   oved the mustard/pepper floavor.

My entire family loved this!  Followed directions exactly except adding bread crumbs.  A tad bit dry.  I will try adding just a little more milk next time.  Otherwise, perfect!

This is the best!!! No more boxed M&C!  I think the mustard was the secret. I did use 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of the American, as that is all I had.  Added some frozen broccoli and served it with sliced ham.  Excellent, and will definitely make it again.

My family loved this macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy, cheesy, and just plain good.  I did substitute sharp cheddar for the american cheese.

Just perfect exactly as the recipe was written: macaroni and cheese, that's all.  I only had a mild cheddar and next time I'm gonna look for american cheese atr the store.  Mine tasted a little more sophisticated than I wished for, but it's easy to tell the cheddar was the issue.  This is a definite reliable keeper for me.  Thank you so much for posting it.

I've made this recipe twice with a few revisions and both times it was really yummy!  Once I took it to a pot luck event-all boys and it was gone!!  Once for my sister-in law's family (we ket a bit).  My picky 15 year old son gave it the 5 stars.

My changes:  I used a whole pund of macaroni and doubled the recipe substituting a large Velveta block and 2 packets of the Kraft's cheese melts (mentioned in the earlier review) for the cheese.  All other ingrediants I just doubled.  It was perfect.  O made it ahead the first time up to the point of mixing the sauce with the pasta nd put it in a large casserole dish and in the fridge.  I heated it up the next day and it was great.  Definitely in my to keep list!

Really good, but the other reviewers were right...too much cheese. I am not a fan of processed cheeses. They are usually more expensive than real cheese, and the texture tends to be a bit like glue. I used less cheese, that was a sharp cheddar/colby mix.

Oh my gosh I loved this recipe! I will definitely be making this one again. It was so creamy and so cheesy. I couldn't find cubed American so I used colby-jack, I used two cups of macaroni instead of 1.5, pepper to taste, and in case there wasn't enough fat I mixed the breadcrumbs with some butter before putting them on top. I can't say enough about how much I liked this. I have been looking for a mac and cheese recipe like this. Thanks, Mouse!

I don't normally review recipes I alter however I thought I would provide feedback for others.  I used 8oz of sharp cheddar and 8oz of mozzarella and it was a bit bland.  With that said, the sauce was creamy and good.  And I really like the pepper.  Had I stuck to the recipe I think it would have been excellent.  I will def make this again with the american and vleveeta cheeses.

I've never been a fan of processed cheese, but know that it does melt down very well for good creamy sauces. I used 1 3/4 cup of macaroni, then followed the recipe exactly; but I just couldnt get past the flavor of the processed cheeses. I wish I had used cheddar for the American, maybe that would've made the difference. The other problem I had with this, is the next day we decided to heat some up for lunch, but I had to cut it out of the bowl with a knife it had hardened so much! So upon re-heating, be sure to add some milk to it.

I made this recipe two nights ago and I already plan on making it again tonight.  Its the best mac and cheese I've found on this site so far. Its really creamy and excellent comfort food! The only thing that I would change is I would cut the amount of black pepper in half because it was way too much for my kids. Also instead of the american cheese I used grated sharp cheddar and sprinkled the top with fresh grated parmesan towards the end of baking. Also I increased the amount of pasta to two cups and it came out perfectly! It was so good there wasn't a bite left over.

Try using skim milk no margarine and 2% cheeses.  No one knows the difference!  Yum!  I added a little garlic powder and a dash of cajun seasoning and it made it even better!

Good recipe, but not the best.  It was a little too peppery for me.  Also, you can add 50% more noodles for the amount of sauce it makes.

This recipe was 4 stars as is--5 stars with a few alterations. The first time I made it I used Cheddar cheese instead of American and the sauce came out grainy. I've used only Velveeta since then. I also omit the breadcrumbs, as I've found they're not my cup of tea. Depending on how much of a sauce fan you are, you can use up to double the macaroni the recipe calls for. I wouldn't do any more than double, though, because that would make it too dry. I also use the larger elbow macaroni, as it makes for a nice texture. With these fairly minor changes, this is a dish that I get cravings for all the time. This will definitely become one of my staples!

I love cheesy mac and cheese so this recipe was just what I was looking for.  I had a problem with the measurements of the cheese because I forgot to switch to metric and I wasn't sure how much 8  oz was in metric (my block of Velveeta had metric measurements on it).  I basically used 3/4 of the block.  After making it though I found out that the block of Velveeta was 16 ounces so it turned out that I added 4 oz more than the recipe called for.  I should have added more milk as it was a tad thick after baking.  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.   I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I smashed up some leftover croûtons I had.  They were Caesar salad flavored sourdough croûtons and I added some shredded cheddar cheese to them.  My husband liked that; it really made a nice, yummy, crunchy topping.  I also added onion, garlic and hot sauce to the roux before I added the milk.  This was really quite tasty.  I have lots of left over so I'm going to add some milk to it and make some more croûtons topping.  Thanks for the recipe.

this is a good basic recipe...for added flavor, next time I'll grate some onion into it the butter and saute it.  I also probably wouldn't even bake it since that only dries it out more and it's perfectly delicious right after mixing it all together. In that case, though, I'd definitely add more noodles.  Any cheese combination will probably work--I used part american, part cheddar and part mozzarella, since I was cleaning out my cheese drawer and that's what came out;)

I was craving a creamy homemade macaroni and cheese and this was just what I wanted.  I swapped out a 1/2 of the milk for sour cream, used shredded cheddar and added a couple dashes of hot sauce.  I'm sure it would be great either way.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay, but I think it needed more mustard and some garlic. That would've made it a 5! I used rotini pasta because it's all I had, but it was still good. Leftovers will probably be better tomorrow!

Wonderful mac and cheese. I dont like too much of a processed velveeta taste so i used half velveeta and half a mixture of shredded cheeses.  The family loved it and it is pretty easy to make.  The best recipe for mac and cheese so far. Will make one a week at least. Wanted to add that i often make this and mix in 1lb browned ground beef or turkey and bake as directed for a complete meal.

I scaled back on the cheese as alot of others suggested. I don't think it much mattered b/c this was just really bland.

This was a hit at a potluck I recently attended - the only change I'll make next time is to eliminate the bread crumbs and perhaps try some other cheeses.

I, being the cheese lover that I am, didn't think that this was too cheesy! I thought that it was fabulous! I added some onion and garlic powder and a dash of hot sauce to the cheese mixture. I used cheddar only and just sprinkled the top with bread crumbs. Very good Mouse! Thank you!

This was great! I made a couple changes, I minced a small onion and added about 1 TBS garlic to the butter and sauteed those until the onions were transulcent. I also added a tad bit more butter because I did sautee the onions and garlic in it. I didn't have Velveeta cheese so I used what I had, which was some new Sargento cheese (Cheddar with Chipotle peppers) and then a 4 cheese mexican blend (colby, monterey jack, asiago and something else). Anyways, those were my changes, it came out awesome. Had a little bit of a little spice to it. Oh and I halfed the amount of mustard it called for. Everyone loved it.

Fabulous mac and cheese! Used Kraft "Crumbles" cheese blend and what was left over of sharp cheddar in the fridge... Omitted the mustard (I was afraid to try), but will next time! :) This is the closest to my mom's homemade mac and cheese that I've found! Thanks bunches for the recipe!!

I finally found the a mac and cheese recipe that is REALLY cheesy.  This is the real Cheese and Macaroni reversal.  There was so much cheese, I had to cook more macaroni than required.  I used sharp cheddar instead of american, and only had half the required amount of processed cheese so added mozzarella to make up the difference.  The processed cheese gives you the creamiest, choose the accompanying cheese according to your taste--we like the cheddar better.

I omitted the bread crumbs at the end. The serving size scaled down to 2 seemed to be off, it seemed more like it was a serving size for 4. I had to add a little more processed cheese & American cheese & some black pepper. I cooked for only additional 15 minutes. Tasted really good, much better than the boxed stuff.

I'm a HUGE fan of cheese. But even I found that the ratio of noodles to cheese was WAY off. To the point where I find the recipe must contain a serious error.

However, I was able to take this basic recipe and alter it--I changed up what types of cheese went in (aged white cheddar and Edam worked great). And then I added an extra cup of macaroni (and also doubled the recipe, as it wouldn't have made much otherwise). 
In then end it makes a really, really yummy mac & cheese. And I know I'll make it again.

Excellent!  However, the ratio of noodles to sauce is off.  I doubled the noodles and it was still extremely cheesy!  I also used 8 oz. Velveeta and 8 oz. med. cheddar cheese.  The best!!!!

Quick and yummy. I made one mistake and used half cheddar and half american to get a more full flavor - but cheddar just doesn't give it that creamy texture. That aside, this is so good and tasted great even the next day!

This is a fantastic base recipe.  I used shells, and ended up using 3 cups of dry shells-it was just too soupy before I added more.  I also used 8 oz cheddar and 8 oz light velveeta. I also topped it with crushed potato chips instead of the bread crumbs. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My VERY picky 8 year old tasted it and said "Now, that's what I am talkin about!"

This is without a doubt the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had.  I will look not further.  The only think I changed was I increased the macaroni to 2 cups.  It came out perfect.  Thanks Mouse!

The flavor on this was good, but my sauce turned out too watery, even after baking. I think this might be because I used skim milk. So next time, I will use more macaroni and less milk. I think I'm also going to skip the bread crumbs and use something else instead~ crushed corn flakes or grated parmesan or something. I did take the cover off and bake for 5-10 more minutes so the top would get a little more brown and crusty, too.

great recipe!  I made for family get together the 4th and had none left over.  I used the 4 cheese, mexican blend shredded cheese as some others have suggested and it turned out very well.  This would be a child friendly recipe I think.

It tasted pretty good, but the cheese curdled after I took it out of the oven. I did everything by the book, using whole milk, but I did use ALL velveeta instead of 1/2 and 1/2 cheddar. Maybe this was the problem. I also omitted the breadcrumbs.

I saw alot of positive ratings on this, and I hate to be the one to say something bad...  but, I just didn't like this.  My kids didn't, neither did my husband.  I used the dry mustard, the pepper and all, still no flavor.  I thought it needed some salt, which helped, but not that much.  I won't make this again.

Instead of Velveeta and American cheeses, I used shredded sharp cheddar (8 oz pkg) and shredded colby-jack (1/2- 8 oz pkg). Next time I will probably add 4 oz more of cheddar.  The entire family enjoyed this mac & cheese and it was easy to put together. :)

HOLY CHEESE!  I'm not sure if my 8 oz of each type cheese was different than who wrote the recipe, or if theres an error in the amount of pasta, but I ended up with WAY too much cheese sauce. I had to cook another 3/4 cup of pasta and add it and it is still crazy cheesy.  It's definitely good, but next time I will cut the cheese sauce in half.

I used a tad more elbow macaroni  & used individually wrapped white American cheese slices & 1/4 of a block of Velveeta. Guessed at # of slices & size of  Velveeta hunk to have 8oz of each. Was well satisfied and my church family loved it. Next time I will use yellow American cheese slices. Muxed in my sauce pan, but took it to church in my crockpot. Set it to warm during service.

I've been using this exact recipe since the 90's and I got it from my mom, who had been making this since the early 70's. Good recipes just never go away lol! Seriously, we make this for every single holiday, usually for the "lunch" portion of the day and it shines as much as the holiday dinner. As the years have gone on, I have made tiny changes, although just as is  tastes great too. My changes include adding a little sauteed onion and garlic to the cheese sauce. Sometimes I put extra bread crumbs on top and I sometimes flavor them with Italian seasoning.

This was a very creamy and cheesy mac n cheese. I will definitely use this recipe from now on, but for me the pasta to sauce ratio was way off. I followed the reviews advising not to add pasta, but I ended up with more a cheese soup with pasta. Next time I'll add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more pasta OR 1/2 cup to 1 cup more pasta for a double recipe which is what I made. Also, I cooked pasta for one minute less than the package directions (8 min) and still felt it was more chewy than I'd like after coming out of the oven. So next time I'll just follow package directions and cook all the way. I used off brand velveeta and fiesta blend shredded cheese from Wal-Mart. I reduced pepper to 1/2 ts and added 1 ts of onion powder and paprika and 1/2 ts of salt. I also added some chicken thigh to make this more of a complete meal and that was a great addition (2 chicken thighs for a double recipe).

Yum, yum, yum! I've made this quite a few times and it's the best creamy macaroni and cheese ever, in my opinion.  I admit, I have never used the American cheese in this, as the only way I've found that sold is in the thin, plastic wrapped slices that are meant to go on burgers and sandwiches. I do, though, use lots of Velveeta. It's not gourmet, true, but it melts like a dream and makes the perfect comfort macaroni and cheese.

This recipe, as written, is perfect. At first you may feel like there is too much sauce for the amount of pasta but once it bakes, the ratio is just what you want in a Mac and cheese. It is creamy beyond belief. I adore a little sharpness in my Mac and cheese so I added a little freshly shredded Asiago and some sharp cheddar but I know I would have loved this even if I followed the recipe exactly as written. The mustard powder and black pepper are a must - they liven the whole dish up. I’ve been searching for a good recipe for a long time and this is it. Switch the cheeses up to change the flavor a bit if you want but don’t skip the pasteurized processed cheese even if it’s not something you normally like - in many good Mac and cheese recipes this is the magic creaminess and saltiness that makes the dish great without a ton of effort.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and my family and guests loved it. I did quadruple the recipe for a party and had a ton of left overs. I found the best was to reheat it was on the stove with some additional milk.

Doubled the noodles (mixed little and big shells). 4oz Velveeta jalapeno and 4oz Velveeta original. Instead of breadcrumbs I crumbled up ritz crackers. Turned out perfect will definitely use again!

I tried it since it has such great reviews, but I don't enjoy the flavor of Velveeta, so this recipe isn't the one for me. On top of that there seems to be something missing. I think onions may have helped, but it's rather plain.

This will be my “go-to” Mac and Cheese from now on. This was amazing.... just what I was hoping for.  Cheesey and delicious. I used a 16oz pack of processed American cheese slices ( the ones where you don’t have to peel off the wrapping) found in the cheese section.

Yummy. Added extra cheese (gouda and cheddar), left off the bread crumbs and substituted 1 cup of half-n-half for 1 cup of the milk.

OMG! I love this recipe. It is so much easier than the 'country' mac & cheese I'd been making in the crockpot.
First time I followed the recipe exactly.
2nd time I added cubed ham to simplify the meal. Add a veggie & you have dinner.

Omg. Some of the best Mac and cheese I’ve ever had. I cooked it for my friends and everyone was raving and asking for the recipe. I did use sharp cheddar instead of American and used velveeta as it calls for. I also skipped the bread crumbs but that’s just personal preference. Def Don’t add more noodles. It’s perfect as is. So creamy and yummm (I’m on day 6 of the master cleanse as I’m typing this and my mouth is watering thinking about it). Highly recommend.

Made this tonight exactly as written.   It was amazing!  I will use panko bread crumbs next time for a little extra crunch, but other than that I will follow the recipe as written.  Thanks for a great addition to my favorite recipes.

I read reviews and decided to make 3 cups of pasta instead of 2 1/2.  Followed the recipe otherwise and when I combined the cheese and pasta it seemed way to cheesy.  After baking though it turned out a bit dry ... lesson learned, follow the directions.  It was tasty so will try again and follow the directions.

I have tested MANY mac n cheese recipes.  Most were pretty good.  BUT this one is a perfect balance of cheese sauce and so very good.  The flavors are spot on! .... This concludes my quest to finding the perfect mac recipe. I will stop now because I've found it here.

Do not change a thing!  The macaroni absorbs most of the liquid and once slightly cooled, it's not runny at all.  Perfection!  Best Mac & Cheese recipe I've found and confirmed by a 12 and 13 year old (aka Master judges of Mac & Cheese!)

I doubled the recipe for a potluck.  Instead of doing breadcrumbs I let that out and I’m reviewing prior to baking it since I prefer a stove top Mac and cheese.

So, I made it per the recipe with 1# pasta and doubled the cheese sauce.  After draining the pasta dumped the cheese over the pasta and mixed.

Then I PANICKED and read the reviews to use more pasta since the ratio was wrong.  So I scraped my soupy mixture into a large bowl and boiled another pound of pasta to hopefully save my dish.  When I went to add my second batch of pasta I discovered that my original soupy mix really wasn’t soupy at all anymore, and didn’t need any more pasta.  So...now I have a pound of al dente macaroni noodles that I’m not sure what I’m going to use for.  I’m sure allrecipes can help me with that, although I just might make a second double batch of the cheese sauce and make some more of this.  Prior to baking it’s amazing, and that’s how I would serve it in my family!

Decent recipe. Texture is wonderful but not a fan of mustard and that's all I could taste. Next time a little more pasta and a LOT less mustard, if any.

I made extra cheese sauce since our family likes this dish very creamy and cheesy.  I added some mustard to the sauce, as it seems to bring out the cheese flavour.  Would definitely make this again.

I have made this on numerous occasions. I have made with macaroni noodles and the noodles panera bread uses. I forget the name. Big spirals. Anyways, I love this recipe. We get so many compliments. The only thing I have done differently is the amount of pepper. To me, it calls for way too much! I use half

The best macaroni and cheese recipe I’ve tried. Simple and so yummy. I just made one change. I used 3 different type of cheese, sharp cheddar, edam and gruyere. I doubled the recipe and did add a bit more cheese and took it to a work event. I went for seconds and it was gone in minutes. Everyone was coming to me for the recipe. Thanks!

Made it to the exact  measurements, too heavy in taste, and  too much breadcrumbs, I rate this recipe as not consumable.
too much butter and cream cheese used, also slightly salty, because cream cheese also comes with salt, butter has salt in it also, cut back on the salt, also not tasty at all.

Very good Mac & Cheese recipe. I followed the recipe as written and thought that it is perfect the way that it is. My son loves this dish! He asked me to continue to make this version of Mac & Cheese -- it is his favorite. He even asked me to make it for his lunches. He said that i can put it into a thermos so that he can bring them for lunch at school!

A wonderfully simple recipie. I made it for 25 vegetarians at our school camp and was asked for the recipe many times. It was quick and kept us within budget. The only change I would make is to add about 1/4 more macaroni and decrease the cheese by about 1/4. That's all! and in my opinion they are not necessary changes, just to my taste.

I made this dish as written. Overall it had a good taste but was very rich. My husband and I couldn't eat more than 1/2-1 serving. I would make this again but reduce the ground mustard to 3/4 tsp, then reduce the cheese while adding milk. This is a taste as you go recipe. If you cover the dish the entire time, the bread crumbs will not brown, uncover for a good 5 minutes or so. Although some reviews said to add noodles, don't! It will seem soupy when you prepare it and when it first comes out. After it sits for a couple of minutes, it will thicken.

I think it is perfect as written.  It was extra saucy when served immediately from the oven which was really good and it was also was not dry when reheating leftovers which is extremely important to me since we always have leftovers.  Great recipe for quick easy delicious Mac n cheese.

I have tried many macaroni and cheese recipes and this, by far, is my absolute favorite. I have made trays of this recipe for many family events and it's always a HUGE hit. It's usually the first food gone at every party because adults and kids all love it.

This is the third time I've made the recipe with great results.  I doubled it the last two times with no problems.  My only personal tweaks have been to substitute sharp cheddar for the American cheese the recipe calls for and crumble a few pieces of bacon into the topping before baking.  Honestly, this doesn't add much in terms of taste; I just look for excuses to add bacon to things.   Anyway, although a few reviewers have suggested that the recipe is too cheesy, please try it as is before adjusting the noodle/cheese ratio.  I think it's already perfect.

I have been making this macaroni and cheese on a regular basis for about a year now and it's delicious the way it is. I'm only adding my changes here because this is how my family likes it and I needed somewhere to put my notes lol!

I used 16oz uncooked elbow macaroni. Increase the bechamel sauce by 1.5, add just a touch of salt, and brown the butter/flour mixture slightly before adding milk. add the Velveeta to the bechamel and let cook on very low heat for about 7 or 8 mins (or while macaroni boils). Remove sauce from heat and let the mix cool just a little before adding the 8oz room temperature grated sharp cheddar. This method results in ridiculously smooth cheese sauce. Not at all gritty. I had to physically stop myself from eating the hot cheese sauce straight out of the saucepan.

I also didn't even bother with the bread crumbs or baking it, just cooked the noodles enough to make it ready to eat.

I work on an oilfield platform were I cook lots of different things.  This is one of the guys favorites.  They are always asking me to make it and make extra to put in the fridge so they can munch on it later.   Very good recipe as is.  I have on occasion changed out the cheese with pepperjack.

I add extra cheese, or less milk, to thicken and use this cheese sauce as a dip, spread, or over noodles for a quick Mac and cheese. It can be stored in the fridge for a few days so I can make it before hand.

Great basic recipe! I’ve made it a few times and it’s just what we’ve wanted. I’ve tried different cheeses and all have been delicious.

SO GOOD.  My family loves this and friends ask for it during football season.  I do make minor changes - instead of plain Kielbasa I use smoked (OMG).  And I add in other flavor cheeses (Gouda, Gyurere).  I use Panko (a .5 cup) and a load of smoked Paprika in it and on top.  

Mix it all in the pasta pot and put in casserole/Lasagna dish.  Top with Panko and smoked Paprika.

This is BOMB.

Excellent classic recipe! I twisted it a little to make it taste just like my mom's by: first, doubling the recipe and then decreasing the cheese by 25% and increasing the milk by 1/2 cup. I also added a cup of finely chopped sauteed onions and skipped the mustard powder. It's perfect; thanks for the help Mouse!

This is outstanding. I'm a fan of "fancy adult" Mac and cheese too but if you're looking for classic comfort Mac & cheese, this can't be beat!

Delicious, but greasy. And the velveeta does congeal pretty quickly once you pull it out of the oven.

I liked the noodle to sauce ratio as written, but the soupiness drowned the bread crumbs. I would leave them out next time.

Very good! Use elbow macaroni and it will turn out right, third time was a charm. Substituted what I had on hand first time, too runny. Second time added extra elbow macaroni, thick and gluey, yuck.

I followed suggestions from others and doubled the amount of pasta. Next time, I'll increase it from 1 1/2 cups to 2 1/2 cups (vs 3). It was a bit dry. I love it that way, but others don't always. I also went with 8 oz of sharp cheddar and 8 oz of mixed mozzarella, jack, cheddar and parmesan. It was DELICIOUS!!

Wow, this great. I used mild cheddar instead of american cheese. I also used cavatappi pasta instead of macaroni. Everything else was followed to the recipe. I thought it might end up too soupy like other reviewers have mentioned, but after baking it was perfect. Next time I'll probably use less breadcrumbs and maybe bake the last 5 minutes without a cover to make a nice crispy layer on top. There will definitely be a next time!

I give this 4 stars, I made it following directions exactly. Next time I will cut the pepper in half, it's very overpowering. I will either toast the breadcrumbs first or use panko. The breadcrumbs were dry, pale and powdery on top. I tried putting it under the broiler to brown them up, but still the texture was off. The kids love boxed velveeta and shells, this was much like that. I agree there was more sauce than macaroni, next time I'll add another 1/2 C of noodles. It's very rich, better for a side dish than a main course.

There is a lot of debate on should the pasta be increased.  I increased to 2cups but it was thicker than I like and next time I will follow the recipe.  Also, I used Panko unseasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled with paprika.  Used half Velveeta and half colby / cheddar mix.  Loved it!!

This is a  really good "make  ahead" mac and cheese. I used a little more noodles  and  made it over an hour a head of time, brought it to the party and then baked it. It was still creamy and delicious.  Everyone loved it!

The great thing about this recipe is how different you can make it. I've made it exactly as listed and it was wonderful, I've made it an not baked it and it was wonderful, I've made it with different types of cheese and it was wonderful. I really can't say how I like it best, since it really depends on my  mood or what I serve it with, but I've liked them all.

Girlfriend asked me to find a recipe that was like her grandma's.  After listening to the flavors she remembered this was the one I chose. I have made some changes to it to. This is the 3rd time and I stuck close to original except a 1/3cup of finely chopped onion and a layer of smoked gouda over top.

This is the go-to homemade macaroni recipe at my house. My daughter is a mac and cheese freak and this is her favorite (I've tried several homemade versions of mac and cheese over the years). I don't bother with the bread crumbs and I do increase the pasta a bit but otherwise make it as written. Very good.

It was very good.   I used a little less cheese than called for.   My daughter has made this and told me it was too cheesy.  She also told me to double the recipe for the sauce, but not the noodles because it was dry.   This worked out well.   After adjustments, it was perfect!

I agree with bakechef from 2008 and here it is 2016.  DO. Not. Change the pasta ratio.  I should've rated this last year, but guess, I was enjoying what I was eating way much to remember to come back and do so. ;) lol. I've done what chef had done over the past year, too.  Used some good freshly grated sharp cheddar, also Velveeta, Sharp cheddar AND American, but I do like the taste the sharp brings to the table.  Trust me though, I'm not going to push a bowl however the above is made away from me anytime soon, thank you!  Thanks mouse, +5 stars imho.  And you can NOT make this without Velveeta.  Period.  Not this way anyway, again just my little humble opinion and, I NEVER grew up on Velvetta cheese was one of two times in my life I bought it until this recipe.

Finally a tried and true Creamy mac and cheese! This recipe is a wonderful Base recipe to make your own! The measurements are perfect! It seems like to much sauce for such a little bit of pasta but it WORKS! Delish! I added in some garlic powder I skipped the breadcrumbs as i usually do Yum Yum Yum!!! I am so excited i have finally found a GOOD mac and cheese recipe! My search is over! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

Very tasty. I hadn't had any experience cooking with this product (Velveeta) so I thought I'd better use a recipe for the first time.  Thinking Velveeta and American cheese to be pretty much the same thing, I just used 1# of the sharp cheddar flavor Velveeta and it turned out very good and creamy. Like other reviewers, I would not recommend using more pasta because the proportion of sauce to pasta seems just right for creamy mac n cheese.  Not sure I will make it again just because I'm not a big fan of the salty Velveeta flavor but it's a great easy recipe for those who do.

It was sooo bad.  I doubled the pasta like the most helpful review said.  The sauce didn't have enough liquid in it and burned and stuck to the pot.  The sauce was sooo thick.  The mustard and pepper gave it a salty taste.

This is the Mac n cheese recipe I make almost every week in the summer pool parties. Adults and kids approved. Agree with some reviewers that the sauce ratio is a bit much, so I just make it a tad less np. Also I always use the velveeta as one of the cheeses but get creative with other addons (Parmesan, mozzarella, sharp cheddar,...)

Not bad pasta needs to be tripled though, also used double the amount of flour and added diced tomatoes. Wasn't very cheesy though but still good.

I like a very cheesy mac 'n cheese so this one fit the bill. I would recommend the addition of dried mustard and a little cayenne for more flavor. I used panko bread crumbs on top which gave it a nice crunch. Will make again!

This was good but only made about 4 servings.  It was very creamy to start but by the time my six year old was ready for seconds,  the sauce had congealed and he wouldn't eat it.  I'm thinking next time I will make more macaroni and just ladle the sauce on without baking.

Everyone enjoyed this tonight. I expected it to be creamier than it ended up being, but overall the flavor was good. I would make this again.

We liked this.... except for the too-Velveeta-y taste.    We'll definitely make again.... just change the ratio of Velveeta: other cheese.   We tossed in some leftover Easter ham.  This will be even better next time.... with a little less Velveeta and a little more "real" cheese.

I love this recipe, but will make this next time with either no bread crumbs or panko instead.  I would also do a quick broil at the end to brown the crumbs...otherwise it just mixes in and adds a weird texture to the dish.

my "go-to" mac and cheese recipe! like the other reviewers state, i double the amount of macaroni noodles because this seems to make a huge amount of cheese sauce, and i skip the baking step because my kids like it creamy (and don't care for bread crumbs on top). i also use 8 ounces of Velveeta and 8 ounces of shredded cheddar for the cheeses. always delicious!

This is a great recipe. I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it, especially my niece whom wouldn't stop going on about it! The cheese ratio is perfect, once it cooks in the oven it's not "overly cheesy" like you'd think. I quadrupled the recipe and baked it in a large (deep) throw away roasting pan. It made a ton!! So double would actually be perfect for a good sized-family :) the only thing I didn't care for was the bread crumb topping, but then again I've never really liked that on my macaroni so it may just depend on the person. It just pulls from the cheesy good flavor I think. Definitely keeping this recipe! 5 stars!!!

Excellent recipe with perfect ratios. DO NOT ADD MORE MACARONI! The pasta will absorb the perfect amount of the sauce as it bakes in the oven. If yours is soupy, you've done something wrong. After making this as written several times, I began experimenting with different cheeses. I have found that the best combo is regular Velveeta, white Velveeta and sharp cheddar. The white velveeta really cuts the richness of the yellow.  Always use fresh grated cheddar or other cheeses. The pre shredded cheese is coated to keep it from clumping in the bag. That coating results in lumpy cheese sauce. I also add a pinch of cayenne.  To add some decadence, replace some of the milk with heavy cream. Yum!

Fantastic! My husband begs me to make this when he's in the mood for comfort food. Friends and family all love it, and ask for the recipe all the time. The mustard really brings it together for me. 

 I stick to the recipe for the cheese sauce, but I triple the amount of noodles. If you're feeling extra adventurous, add some chopped jalapeno or bacon. For super extra comfort food bonus points, serve in a bread bowl!

The best Mac and cheese. The only changes I made were to use a good sharp cheddar cheese instead of American cheese and I cut the black pepper amount in half. Came out great!

This has been my go-to mac and cheese recipe for years and I really should have rated it before now. It's a 5 as written, easily. However, today, I added a small can of chipotle peppers in abode sauce that I processed. WOW! Just WOW!

The ingredient amount is fine as is. I will try this again. I think the quality of cheese I used hurt this recipe, but I'm not rating this poorly because of my choices.

Way too much sauce to noodles. There also wasn't enough flour to bind it so the sauce is very loose. Lastly there also isn't enough salt despite the Velveeta. Overall this was very disappointing. Thanks anyway!

I agree that a 2 qt dish is required, but I disagree about the pasta to cheese ratio. Maybe Mouse and I are kindred cheese spirits? I absolutely loved it, but I had to make several of my own tweaks to get it perfect.

I left out the mustard powder because I didn't have any, but it didn't taste like it's lacking (although I don't know what it tastes like with it, so...) I sautéed diced onion and garlic in the butter before adding the flour and pepper. I also don't like processed cheese taste, so I just used regular cheddar, but I imagine you could sub any cheese and it would be delish! I didn't have 18 oz of cheese, only 13 so that's how much I used and it was plenty cheesy! I always use Panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, which I highly recommend. Much better crisp! I don't like "runny" mac and cheese, so I cooked it UNCOVERED to make sure enough liquid evaporated. It did require the full 25 minutes to thicken up for me, and then I broiled it for about 5 minutes to get a little crunch on the top. I also let it set for 15 minutes after coming out of the oven. I will certainly make this again, and again, and again!

My family is a LOVER of Mac and Cheese and this is by far been their favorite!!! I use Organic noodles when I make this and you can not tell. I am not a big fan of processed anything, especially Velvetta so I read some comments and realized that that is what makes it creamy. So, I could not find the Kraft Classic Melts like one reader suggested, so I used Kraft "Triple Cheddar". The Philadelphia cheese that was in it helped with the creaminess.

I changed it a tad to work for our family. I used 2 cups macaroni noodles. Added 1/2 cup 1/2 & 1/2 to thin sauce at the end. I used an 8oz pouch of shredded sharp cheddar and 8 oz of Velveeta 2% milk. I also cut down on the Mustard and pepper to 1/2 tsp. My kids do not like to see that much pepper and I don't prefer that strong of a mustard flavor. This is my go to recipe. Every time I make it everyone loves it.

I was iffy about trying this recipe because of the processed cheese. I rarely have processed cheese in my household and now I see why. Nothing beats homemade mac and cheese with REAL cheese. I made it exactly as stated but I didn't like the outcome. At first it seemed cheesy and moist but as it sat out it just kinda dried up and tasted artificial. I would consider the taste of this the same as a box of Kraft Deluxe Mac and Cheese.

I made this for the grandchildren when they came to visit, the two of them (teenagers) are as skinny as rails and they inhaled the whole thing but I did have a taste of it.  It reminded me of the old Kraft Mac and Cheese where the cheese came in a can in the package.  I used to buy it when I was a newlywed a hundred years ago, well.......fifty-five years ago.  I'm too old to eat it now, might just as well paste a serving to my hips instead!  Yummy creaminess....I remember it well. I make another M & C now that is far less fattening but I give this one a 5 Star for being the "best of it's kind".

Too bland for anyone in my family.  Processed cheese just doesn't taste home made to me, more like the cheese sauce that comes with boxed mass produced products. It wasn't bad, just wasn't great.

I have made this recipe a few times now on a larger scale for parties. It's always a hit! Although it seems like there may be too much "cheese soup" at first, it gets absorbed and thickens in the oven and comes out perfectly every time. My family is requesting this one now. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Thanks for the awesome recipe.  I've been using this one ever since I discovered it on here almost 2 years ago!  Everyone says it's the best they've ever had. Recently I added a 1/4th cup of Philly cream cheese and it makes it even better, which I thought was impossible. Thanks Mouse!!

Oh my gosh this was so good! Being a vegetarian I have been trying to find things I can bring with me to parties and cookouts. I have found it. I made this tonight for my family and it was so good. My son of course wouldn't eat it because it didn't taste like the frozen kind. Blah. My boyfriend loved it also. I will be making again soon.

Due to my daughter's allergies, we had to do a few modifications, but overall this is a great recipe.  The only thing we had to do differently was use vegan cheese and soy milk.  Wonderful stuff!!

Making this for my DH and DD, who love mac-n-cheese, I was really hoping for a better outcome. Had to sub rotini for elbow macaroni since I was out. Simply not a fan of processed cheese, I have another recipe which doesn't call for any, so I'll stick with that. DH and DD liked it, and I appreciated trying a recipe that was fast and easy, but I can't say it was really "loved."

OMG!...The best recipe! I made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it. I doubled the amount of elbow pasta (thank God) and left out 2 ounces of cheese, and it was still a hit. My co-workers ate it all up before I could even get any. AMAZING!!! 

F.Y.I-If you are feeding more than 5 people, then you need to use 6 cups of elbow pasta and double up on everything else.

This is the best macaroni recipe I've ever found! I make it for every family gathering (which happens a LOT). The only change I make to it is adding some garlic. Gives it a punch. It's always the first dish to be emptied!

My family likes to try different kinds of macaroni and cheese.  Heather, from the morning “What’s for dinner?” post stated that her family likes this recipe.  I tried it as we had not had this one yet.  It didn’t disappoint and was very creamy.  I did use the Velveeta® but used co-jack in place of the American cheese as that is what I had on hand.  I like that you make the cheese sauce first and then bake for 20 minutes.  I think that makes for a creamier mac and cheese.  The seasoned bread crumbs add a nice little texture to the top of this dish.  It was a good choice and one I will be making again.

Made a bit larger and did a few mods, made sauce larger, used just sharp cheddar as I don't use velvetta, added my touches to the sauce, a bit extra dry mustard, 3-4 drops worchestersire, 3-4 drops tabassco, 3-4 tidbits minced garlic and added extra cheese & extra milk to make it a soupy sauce. Mixed grated cheddar in with the pasta, added 2tsp melted butter to the seasoned breadcrumbs. Covered to bake, uncovered last 5 min to brown a bit, and then served pipping hot with our ham dinner! Delicious! Loved by all, even the fussy one!

This was a really nice, creamy mac and cheese! It's not heavy on any seasonings, so if you like that, add to your taste preference. This was just a really creamy macaroni and cheese and easy to prepare. I will be using this recipe again!

I tried this as an alternative to my mom's homemade mac 'n cheese, which was always my favorite. Since she doesn't have a written recipe for it (she just approximates amounts), I wanted to try to recreate it on my own. This recipe had a lot more butter than I remember her using, and it came out rather oily as a result. Also, there was a bit too much pepper for my taste. It was otherwise pretty good - if I attempt it again, I'm going to cut the butter by at least half and try a bit less pepper.

I was searching for the amazing mac & cheese recipe I made a few weeks ago that I didn't save! Boo. :( This, unfortunately, wasn't it.  I made this exactly to recipe and although it was pretty good and really cheesy, I probably won't make it again. It had an odd texture.  The only thing I can figure is that it was the bread crumbs.  That didn't appeal to me. Thanks for sharing.

Don't add more macaroni!  I didn't have any vel cheese but had a mozza/med cheese blend that I added 1 cup of.  I also added about a cup of bacon bits. mmm mmm
The only thing different I would do is put it in a 2l dish as it bubbled over and made a bit of a mess.

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients except I cut the pepper down to 1/4 teaspoon, which was still to much.  Just didn't like the taste of this dish at all.  Won't make it again.

I thought this was very good. I did not add the mustard powder (and of course I felt like it was missing a little kick, lol) but I wanted me very particular son to like it. He likes no kick. He ate the heck out of this. He says it is one of the best macaroni dishes he's ever eaten and he eats a lot. I used velveeta and Kraft shredded cheddar mix for the cheeses. Big hit  over here.

Made this last night for the family and they loved it!  My wife usually makes a baked macaroni (has been for years) and this was my first attempt at it.  She said "oh my, I don't like that you just made a better baked macaroni than me!"  Delicious! Thank you!

This came out just ok. The flavor was decent, I think the ground mustard was a nice addition. Like other posters said though, if you don't plan on eating it right away, don't plan on eating it at all. It turns hard as a rock once it cooks even somewhat. Reheated it's not as good as it was first made.

Should have read the reviews first.  Not enough noodles for the amount of cheese sauce, and I like cheese, but they were already swimming in sauce and I only added half of cheese sauce.

Very good and EASY! I didn't have the cheese listed in the recipe so substituted the same amount of Colby jack. Also used about 2.5 cups of uncooked medium shell noodles as that is what I had on hand.  It was great, although I think I may have used too many breadcrumbs, as they were rather salty.

Relatively easy to make and the first time my hubby liked mac n cheese I've made from scratch.  I would suggest cutting back on the pepper (1/2 tsp instead) if you're not a fan of spicy food like I am.  Also, it had a grainy texture instead of smooth which I believe was my fault because I used a bag of shredded cheese from the fridge instead of a cubed block of cheese.  I believe the anti-caking agents in the cheese caused this, so please learn from my mistake.  Overall, tasty and will make again, just modified to suit my family's tastes.

Due to reviews, we cut out a 1/2c of the milk. It had a wonderful consistency. We enjoyed it, it was very quick to make. Only thing we didn't like was the 'box' taste the cheese had (it was to be expected - our only small gripe.) It still disappeared quick!

This is really good mac and cheese, however, I think it was too peppery for my taste.  I will half that amount or even just do a quarter of it next time.  Also, like some of the other reviews said this was a lot of cheese and not a lot of noodles.  I would double the noodles next time too.

Made as stated except I had to use 8 oz of a colby jack/ cheddar cheese mix (the kraft kind with cream cheese) instead of American b/c I could not find it. I forgot to cover this in the oven but it still turned out great.  Really good.  The only thing that holds it back from a 5 star recipe is that it was just really good- like most homemade mac n cheese recipes- nothing stands out about this one.  Will likely make again especially of I can find the right kind of Amerciacn cheese

Since I rely on ratings for the recipes I make and this has been a huge winner, figured I better return the favor. I made this for a family get together and it was instantly decided that this was the dish I should always bring. I've always doubled the recipe. I'm sure it's perfect as is, but for the cheese I do a mixture of Velveeta, mexican velveeta and the Kraft shredded cheese/cream cheese blend. In other dishes like this I sometimes add sour cream, cream cheese but not necessary with the Kraft Blend. BEST RECIPE!

Holy cow. This is by far the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. I didn't have mustard power in the house so i nixed it but i don't feel like it's missing anything. I doubt I'll ever eat boxed mac and cheese again.

I AM ADDING TO ALL THE OTHER 5 STAR RATINGS.
MY FAMILY ENJOYED IT.  I HAD TO SUB OUT THE WHEAT PASTA FOR BROWN RICE PASTA. OUR FAMILY IS ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN SO I ALSO HAD TO USE ASIAN WHITE RICE FLOUR TO MAKE THE ROUX. SINCE WE DONT DO PROCESSED CHEESE I USED A REALLY GOOD SHARP AND SWISS CHEESE.
IT WAS GREAT AND  IT WAS A GOOD STARTING POINT TO GO BY. THANX MOUSE=)

Half as much pepper is more than enough. I mixed cheddar, velveeta, and mexican shredded and it came out well. Also cooked the noodles all the way and just mixed on the stove. Way cheesy!

Made this at the last minute. It was actually pretty easy and not too time consuming. It tasted really good. I accidentally left it in too long and burnt the cheese on top and it was still good! I would make again.

I have used dozens of recipes from this site (all 4 1/2 or 5 stars) and have never felt the need to write a review until now. I am giving this recipe 3 stars based soley on the flavor.  I followed this recipe exactly except that I used whole grain penne instead of white flour macaroni.  I am going to try it again using 8 oz. of real cheese (cheddar or some mixture) and 8 oz. of velveeta.

I was also VERY disappointed with two other things.  

First, there is WAY too much sauce.  I will double the pasta or cut the sauce in half the next time. Second, if you make this with the sauce as written, do NOT use a 1 1/2 quart casserole unless you want a big mess in your oven.  You need a larger dish!

It's delicious as is. No need to modify the recipe UNLESS you prefer your mac and cheese less cheesy or with less grain taste; otherwise this is a solid recipe for making excellent mac and cheese.

First of all, there are folks out there that love creamy, cheesy, mac and cheese. If you are one of those people, this recipe is for you. Those of you that thought it was too cheesy, must be the type that like the dry version. This was perfect and was gobbled up in no time at Thanksgiving. Thanks, Mouse for making me seem like a wonderful cook. I used shredded cheese instead of cubed because it was cheaper and it turned out perfect. I will be using this for many covered dish dinners in the future. Bravo!

Excellent recipe! In place of the American cheese, I used a shredded four-cheese blend (which included American cheese), that another reviewer recommended.  I also topped the mac and cheese with slices of bacon instead of bread crumbs, before baking it. The bacon gave it a nice smoky flavor. I'll be making this again!

Best Mac & Cheese I ever made!  Left it in the oven a bit longer to brown the top and edges and it tasted yummy!  Pretty easy too.  Oh, didn't have American cheese or Velveeta but I had grated cheddar and also some Monterray Jack cheese.  Muy Bien!

I did not like this mac and cheese, so disappointing! I followed all instructions and ended up with an overly dry not at all creamy of cheesy mess. I may try this again using more pasta and not baking it so all the macaroni gets cheesed and stays creamy like before I put it in the oven.

Great Mac and cheese!  Very cheesy but that's the way it should be. I doubled the recipe for a larger group and followed to a T.  I made it a few hours ahead and cooked it 10 minutes longer because it was cold when I put it in the oven. Did not turn out runny at all!  Don't take the recommendations to increase the pasta, it was awesome and my guests asked for the recipe!

Excellent mac and cheese, I didn't have the velveeta in the house so I used cheese slices, about 7, used sharp cheddar and also added 2 slices of swiss cheese to even out the sharp taste.  This is great! I will be making this again.

Good recipe. I used  4 cups of uncooked pasta when I double the recipe.  There was more than enough cheese to bubble and bake into a nice comfort dish of Mac and Cheese.  Placing this into my "comfort dish file"

Loved it.  Made this recipe just as written.  And like other reviewers, I was skeptical when I added the macaroni and found my mix to be more like soup than macaroni and cheese.  I resisted the urge to add more pasta before cooking it and was happy to find that it came out very well.  The cheese gets absorbed while it's cooking.  Thanks for sharing.  Will keep this one around for years to come.

pretty good...I should have followed the directions as is. I switched to using can evap milk, almost 2 cans. This was not enough milk. The taste was great but kinda thick. I will use this recipe again but follow it using regular milk. I also added salt

kids loved it, I am not much of a mac and cheese fan anyway (made it b/c I had a ton of velveeta dh bought that I needed to use up).  I like real cheese in mine when I do have it. I'll try it again sometime though.

Excellent recipe! I thought there was too much cheese before I put it in the oven, but it firmed up beautifully. Next time I'll forgo the bread crumbs, but other than that perfect mac n' cheese!

LOVE this recipe!  It has replaced my grandma's mac and cheese.  I used the cheese I had, which was 8oz Velveeta, 4oz sharp cheddar, 2oz shredded swiss, and 2oz shredded mild cheddar.  The cheese did look too soupy when I added it the noodles, but after I baked it, it was perfect!  I did have to bake 20 minutes longer.  Creamy, smooth, and cheesy!  Everyone loved it!

If you LOVE Velveeta and creamy mac and cheese, this is for you! I made this because my hubby loves Velveeta. Me, not so much. He raved over this one. My 1 1/2 year old granddaughter ate it eagerly and 18 year old son said it was great. So, I will be making it again for them, soon, I'm sure. Followed recipe, using 8 oz. of sharp white american cheese with the Velveeta and added just a sprinkling of Panko bread crumbs along with the seasoned crumbs. Also, already had med shells on hand, so used those instead of Elbow. Thanks for sharing!

Really really good!  All I had was slices of American cheese on hand, and mini shells instead of macaroni and it actually worked out well!  Right out of the oven it was almost too creamy and cheesy...but the second day, reheated...PERFECTION! This was my first attempt at homemade mac n'cheese and I'll definitely do this again.

This is good macaroni and cheese, very creamy, but a little too heavy for us.  I didn't make any changes.  It is very soupy at first, but when you put it in the oven, it thickens right up.  I'm not a fan of processed cheese, but I thought I'd make an exception for mac 'n cheese.  Like other reviewers said, it came out a little grainy, not as smooth as I was expecting.  It's good, but I'll be looking for something not so heavy and not using so much processed cheese.

The flavor of this is de-licious and it was rather quick to pull together!!  It did turn out quite thick and lumpy instead of creamy, but I'm assuming it was because of the cheese I used.  I only had some sharp cheddar and some Velveeta (Mexican-which was great for flavor!) so that's what I had to use...half of each.  I'd definitely use the Mexican Velveeta again, but for consistency, I'd stick with the recipe and use American for the other half, because I'm pretty sure the cheddar is what made it thick/lumpy.  I used small shells too, which we loved.  I would not change the sauce to noodles ratio as some suggested.  I think it's perfect as is.  And I don't think I'll cover it next time, as it just caused the breadcrumbs to soak down into the mac instead of brown on top.  In fact, this is so good it doesn't even necessarily need the breadcrumbs, and could really even just be eaten without baking first.  Definitely a keeper.  EDIT:  Made this again for company, including kids.  Used half American and half Mexican Velveeta.  The Mexican Velveeta gives it amazing flavor but is a tad too spicy for kids and those who don't like spice.  Next time for company I'll do 12oz. American and 4oz. Mexican Velveeta.  For those who love spice though...half of each is the way to go. SO good!  EDIT:  Added some frozen peas (thawed under cold water first) this time...so good!

Soo good.  I made this at my six year olds birthday party.  Everybody complimented it. What a hit!! I will be making this one again.  I tripled the recipe and it was all gone at the end.

Very yummy mac & cheese.  Per many other reviewers - do not increase pasta amount, this amount works perfectly for a nice creamy dish!  I made this for my boys (get tired of doing KD despite how much they love it!!).  I used a combo of shredded marble (about  1 1/2 cups) along with 1/2 cup light Cheese Whiz as I didn't have either of the cheeses called for.  Only other thing different I did was to cut down the pepper using only 1/2 tsp and added panko bread crumbs for about 10 minutes uncovered after this had baked for 30 mins or so.  I just personally like them much better than dry bread crumbs.

I have cooked this at least 5 times now.  I got the most compliments with 2% velveeta cheese and whole milk.  Gives it a great tatse!  Also, I add a tad bit more ground mustard and pepper.  Instead of the bread crumbs (which most off shelf products have Trans Fat ), i use a bag of saltine crackers and place them in a ziplock bag and mash them up.  The family gathering was disappointed when this dish was the first to go among a group of 10 of us with double the recipe!  Highly recommended!

I subbed mild cheddar cheese for the American cheese, added some grated romano cheese to the bread crumb topping and baked at 400F for 25 minutes.  The hubs (born and raised in the South) loved this mac & cheese recipe!  It wasn't overly creamy, but that's probably because I used cheddar instead of American.  Easy to make, just the right amount of seasoning and very cheesy/filling.  Do not alter the ratio of cheese::noodles, it comes out perfect after baking!  Update: this is fantastic reheated the next day.

I made this for the first time as a potluck dish for a family gathering. I made two batches, one followed the recipe exactly, the other I used a blend of various cheeses, some processed and some natural. Both were raved about. I think its a win-win recipe. Definitely open to moderations. Thanks Mouse!

This is a good starter recipe.  I was craving pepperjack mac n cheese, and I wanted a different recipe than my usual.  My only complaint with the recipe for sure is it needs to be cooked uncovered for 5 - 10 minutes to crisp up the bread crumbs.  I ended up using 1 cup of pepper jack, 1 cup of a Mexican cheese blend, and a can of evaporated milk instead of 2 cups milk.  Turned out very cheesy and spicy!

Hands down...the best m-n-c recipe EVER! So So creamy with excellent flavor! I added some onion and garlic as well and used 1C of milk & 1C of half n half & 2 cups of Macaroni. Put some parm cheese in with the breadcrumbs as well. It's a keeper!

My 12-year old daughter gives this recipe a 5+++ stars.  She and my husband thoroughly enjoyed this macaroni and cheese which is a relief to me since this is the 4th or 5th recipe I have tried.  My only change was to add more pasta and less bread crumbs.  This recipe is a KEEPER!!  Thanks Mouse!

This was just ok for us.  Even my 8 year old complained multiple times about it being too cheesy.  That's pretty amazing for a cheese crazed kid.  I found it to be almost the consistency of paste but maybe that's because I listened to the reviews that said to add more macaroni.

This was OK. It's only slightly better than DAIZYX69's recipe for Four Cheese Macaroni (IMHO). I actually think the baking step was the deal breaker for me... this would be excellent if the macaroni were cooked completely and then tossed with about half the amount of sauce - right off the stove. Preparation method was a nonissue for my fiance; he prefers "gourmet" macaroni (i.e. made with fancy cheeses such as gruyere, gouda, etc.). We are on a budget, so he'll have to wait until I am employed again for that kind of splurge! Another disappiontment was the lack of flavor. I didn't even notice the mustard. I've made a mac and cheese recipe in the past that called for too much mustard, but with this recipe, it was non existent (go figure!). Overall, this is nothing to write home about and certainly not the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. My search for the perfect recipe must continue! Served with fresh garlic bread and steamed broccoli/cauliflower, this was a comforting meal on this rainy, dreary day. Thanks for sharing, Mouse :)

Very good mac and cheese recipe, I can't say the best but it was right up there with the best.  I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because after it sits a bit, the cheese becomes not as smooth.

Really excellent, though I did double up on the pasta.  Probably a middle ground is better, like 50% more pasta to make the dish sturdy but saucy.

I doubled the recipe and divided into 2 dishes for 2 dinners.  I changed the American cheese to shredded cheddar.  Yes, it does look soupy when you put it in the oven but it absorbs and I wouldn't change the measurements at all.  Remember to only cook the elbows for 6 minutes, then they will still absorb the sauce during baking.  Loved by my family at a BBQ last night.  Thanks!

This is a good one!  I followed the recipe exactly, cooked the noodles until they were just firm and it was very saucy, but no problem for the macaroni absorbs the cheese sauce beautifully in the oven.  Next time I will either halve the amount of black pepper or use white pepper and use less bread crumbs.  I don't like them. For a gourmet cook, I'm the only one in my house who likes Mac & Cheese.  The great thing about this site is it allows you to calculate servings and I should've done that.  I'll be eating leftovers for a long time!  This would be very good for a pot luck picnic.  Thanks.

Very good and cheesy.  I substituted about half the processed cheese with cheddar (I might do even more next time) and increased the noodles to 2c.  I will definitely add more noodles next time.  I will probably also add sauteed onions.

Delicious! I've been using this recipe for years and should have written a review much earlier. I use a different blend of cheeses each time depending on who's eating it, some pepper jack adds some wonderful spice or fresh jalapenos for extra zip. I've thrown ham in for a full meal, the options are endless. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is AWESOME, requested by everyone at Christmas time.  The only thing I do different is use Cheddar cheese instead of American and use sharp cheddar Velveeta instead of the original (we love our cheddar lol).  I also brown the bread crumbs in butter to brown it a bit.  Again AWESOME Mac & Cheese dish.  Thanks Mouse.

This was pretty good, although I didn't have the processed cheese, I had to use a mix of mozzarella and cheddar, I did use the American though. I believe this would have been great had I used the processed cheese. Also, I had to use a smaller pasta shape. Will try this again with correct ingredients, thanks (:

It's good, don't get me wrong, but when I spend the time to make a homemade mac and cheese I want it to be awesome or very unique from a store-bought brand. The cheese came out very thick in the end, so I would opt out of baking it as another reviewer suggested as well (just remember to fully cook the macaroni then).

Oh so good! Definite comfort food. I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar in place of the american. Added way more cayenne, like it spicy, and used ritz crackers on top. I also soaked the bread crumbs in the milk. Delicious!

Way too cheesy. I made the recipe as written, but there is way too much cheese. If you absolutely LOVE cheese, then you'll love this, otherwise, I'd cut back a bit. The taste was good, otherwise.

Great recipe! My husband went for thirds and told me to give it 5 stars! I added a dash of garlic salt and onion powder to the mix. Used shredded cheese (Mexican)for the cheddar, and then crushed goldfish crackers on top for extra cheesy taste. The mustard powder gives it a wonderful flavor. I accidentally left out the bread crumbs but they were not needed. It was perfect anyway. One of the best mac and cheese recipes ever.

This was a really good mac n cheese. I increased the pasta to 2 cups and used 2% cheeses and 1% milk. Very good! My family likes lots of pepper on food but if I were to make this for company or a party, I would definitely reduce the pepper.

The recipe was good, but the "Gravy" part that makes the cheese mixture for the macaroni was way too much. I had to leave out about 1/2 to 1 cup of the sauce. Other than that, it was great!!!

Excellent base recipe which I tweaked a little. Whole wheat macaroni....in all the cheesy goodness I couldn't taste the difference and maybe it was a little more healthy. Did not change the proportions...perfect cooking for one amount. Used shredded sharp cheese and Velveeta. Added a pinch of cayenne to the cheese sauce. Used Panko breadcrumbs seasoned with Garlic powder for the topping. Delicious!!

I have been on the hunt for a mac & cheese recipe that my whole family agrees on, since my oldest has sensitivities to the food color in a lot of boxed kinds.  This is the first one I've found that we all love.  I cut back on the Velveeta and American cheeses and add some mild cheddar. It's just the right taste / consistency.

This turned out very good, even with whatever cheese I could throw together.  I used Kraft 2% slices, Kroger 2% block cheese, and skim milk.  Doubled macaroni was fine, although a bit more could have worked.  Pepper was a little much - most people would want to use about half as much as recommended.  I grated toast for bread crumbs - should have added some garlic salt, but it was still fine.  This was a hit with the family and is definitely good enough for company.

followed the recipe exactly. EXTREMELY soupy, and not only that, but we even cooked it for 25 minutes covered, then 10 minutes uncovered- it still ddn't thiken as much as it should. even after letting it rest for about 5 minutes, it still wasnt a creamy macaroni and cheese. if it would have specified whether to use a thicker milk, it probably would have turned out better. the taste is fine, but thats it. nothing spectacular. unless you dont like saltiness or are really sensitive to it, i would suggest not trying it. 
thats my reasoning for the three stars: salty and soupy. not exactly the best combination.

I've tried several different M&C recipes lately and this is the best I've come across.  My panel of tasters (friends and family) and I all like this the best.  I did substitute sharp cheddar for the American cheese and it worked well.

I add a little chipotle and garlic powder.

Also, if you double this recipe it will fill a 9x13 pan perfectly.

This is our favorite macaroni and cheese recipe. We use fontina and gruyere as the main cheeses and have added in some cheddar we had lying around as well, just trying to get the total amount of cheese to match the recipe. My boyfriend likes sharper cheeses and I like milder ones and this was the perfect mix for us. We also grate the cheeses to get them to melt easier. I've also put in a little garlic powder as well. Yum!

This recipe is super easy and delicious. I prepped this a day in advance and refrigerated it overnight, then baked it the next day. I was concerned that it might come out dry, but there actually ended up being plenty of sauce. 
The kids loved it, so I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe - except for reducing the pepper because we're sensitive to spicy-ness. It was easy to make. It tasted good for the first few bites and then it kinda got hard to finish. It was a little too cheesy. I think I'll play around with the amount and types of cheese and see if we like it better.

This is a really good recipe, well, I followed the suggestions with using half the cheese, and I too would NOT put bread crumbs on the top. But the taste and texture was excellent! We will definately change to this recipe on a regular basis!! Yum!

We enjoyed this recipe quite a bit - I used the cheese we had on hand (American and Monterey Jack). I doubled the pasta as others suggested and it was just a little too much (I'm thinking 2 1/4 cups next time). The only other thing I would recommend is to reduce the pepper to 1/2 tsp, we found it a little overpowering. With a few tweaks, it'll be great!

After trying many other recipes, this is my go-to one!  The recipe is easy and unlike other recipes, does not come out of the oven swimming in pools of butter!  I have tried other seasoning, adding tomato, and different crumb mixtures for on top - this is our favorite!

This was really good. I used 2 cups whole wheat macaroni and added brocolli ( before putting it in the oven) I also used the Mexican shredded cheese blend instead of cubed American.I am a huge cheese fan so the cheese was not overwhelming at all. Yummy!

This was delicious. For those who are having this recipe turn out a bit soupy---the key is cooking the cheese sauce a bit longer. Followed the recipe as provided and it turned out excellent.

My family really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was that I omitted the bread crumbs.  It is a very creamy macaroni and cheese.  I have tried others and they have turned out dry.  Not this one!  If your are looking for creamy then stop lookin'.  We ate it again for lunch and guess what?  Still creamy!

This recipe is very rich and creamy. It's very tasty! The only thing I changed about it was I used sharp cheddar instead of American cheese, just because that's my husband's favorite. I definitely recommend it, and it's great for small families, because it doesn't make too much!

This was a fantastic recipe. I added a little garlic because I'm a huge fan of it and I shoulf have left well enough alone, it didnt need it in the least. I also omitted the bread crumbs since I'm not a fan. 

This has a great consistency very smooth and creamy.

Just what I expected (and hoped for). After reading other reviews, I halved all the ingredients but the macaroni (rather than doubling the mac) and it turned out perfectly. Also, I used shredded Mexican cheese in place of the American b/c it's what I had on hand. Great mac and cheese!

True comfort food!  I made it for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper instead of the full teaspoon of black pepper.  That was perfect.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a good recipe.  I used 1 lb. of elbows and there was plenty of cheese sauce.  I used an 8 oz. block of sharp cheddar and slightly more Velveeta.  I think baking it dried it up a little too much for my liking.  I would turn down the temp and/or bake it for a shorter amount of time.  I am eating the leftovers as I type and it's still good the next day!  A little on the chewy side though...

I made this and used about 2 1/2 cups of macaroni instead of the suggested amount.  I used 8oz of government cheese (lol), and 8oz of shredded cheddar.  It turned out good (my husband loved it), but next time I think I will use Velveeta instead of government cheese for a creamier texture!

This was AMAZING!!! I used half a box of bow tie pasta. 8 oz cheddar cheese, 8 oz Velveeta (2% milk), and I added browned sausage. I followed the same instructions with the cheese sauce and everything. We omitted the bread crumbs. The sauce was awesome! I have always made homemade mac n cheese with a cheese sauce from scratch. But with a half and half version of both cheeses it was very good. My husband who is a big skeptic of mac n cheese loved it! I will make this foreverr:)

I really enjoyed the taste of this cheese sauce.  Everyone was excited especially after a few bites!  I had doubled the pasta like suggested by reviewers.  I think I will try a little less then double next time.  Possibly 2 cups.  
Definitely something to be added to our recipe collection

This was perfect mac & cheese. I was concerned there was too much sauce, too, but after baking the sauce really does thicken.  PLUS, the leftovers are not dry at all.  Nice job, mouse!

nice recipe, I unfortunately baked too long and it ended up a bit dry.  It had nice flavor with the topping I used. I put the end of Garden Salsa flavored Sunchips in blender then stirred the crumbs in with 2c shedded sharp cheddar.

This was the first meal I made in my new home and I was very excited to try it.  The macaroni and cheese bubbled over in my new stove.  It didn't seem like there was enough macaroni in it and it was all runny cheese.  I will not be making this again.

I have been making this recipe for at lease 8yrs now and it's the best mac&cheese ever. The only thing is I don't care for Velveeta so I just use mild cheddar or sharp cheddar cheese, and it taste sooo good. I had a cousin that would volunteer me to make this dish at every holiday event as well as her school functions (she was a teacher). I still makeit2 times a year and today is 1 of those days. Merry Christmas all and eat well. Also this recipe is really easy to make (I mix all my dry items to make it easier).

Tasted sooo good!
I made this for a Thanksgiving side and it's pretty close to being the best, but I think I'd like it a little more creamier, the cheese was pretty thick after being done, I think I may add more milk next time. And I've never been crazy about breadcrumbs on my Mac and cheese, so I may leave that off next time too. Made awesome leftovers!

This recipe is super good! The dish is pretty comparable to the boxed version of Velveta Shells and Cheese. However, if you want that "homemade" spin on macaroni and cheese this is an awesome recipe to use!

I really liked this recipe. I actually had to cut the butter in half b/c I ran out, and I only had the Velvetta (I added 12 oz only) and I forgot to put the crumbs on. It was really good and turned out to be healthier. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

A nice basic mac and cheese. Next time I will leave off the bread crumbs as they seemed to overpower it. It's a matter of taste, I guess.

Mouse, you came up with a way to have an excellent, creamy cheese filling and an nice crunchy top with out having to have that burned cheese look on the top.

Copious cheese flavor!  Very creamy, not too oily.  I used cheddar blend and Velveeta.  The pepper is the perfect amount.  I couldn't taste the mustard.
**Update**
This works with a variety of cheeses.  Also, I like to shred parmesean and let it get all brown on the top!  MMMM.

This recipe is awesome!!  I made it for our first cookout of the season and it was a big hit.  The only thing I did differently was used a combination of 2% monterey jack/chedder instead of the american cheese and used skim milk.  It had a little less fat and was excellent.

Great recipe, but I also used more pasta -- I tossed in some chopped frozen broccoli during the last few minutes of cooking, too. The veggies made a very nice contrast with the rich (and abundant!) sauce, and it's a great way to sneak some more vitamins into the dish. I also cooked some finely chopped onion in the butter before adding the flour and spices. Thanks!

Very good!  As per other reviewers, I increased the pasta to 2 1/2 cups and omitted the mustard.  Next time I might add a touch less pepper, but all in all, wonderful!

I just made this recipe with some of the suggested adjustments.  I used 3 cups of noodles and the 8 oz of velveeta along with an 8 oz mixture of shredded sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and jack cheeses.  I went a bit heavier on the sharp cheddar for the bite.  I used 1% milk which is all we ever hand on hand but substituted 1/2 cup fat free half and half for part of the milk...just seemed right at the time.  

It wasn't a difficult recipe, pretty basic so I liked that.

My mac and cheese loving (and fussy) 15 year old daughter liked it very much and so did my husband, who normally would not eat mac and cheese.

I thought it tasted very good, but I think I'll cut the noodles back by 1/2 cup next time so it will be a bit more saucy.  

Other than that, all and all a very nice recipe.

This recipe was very good, the flavor was just the way I like it.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it was a bit too thick.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge cheese lover, but I would of preferred to have the sauce a little smoother and creamier than as thick as it was.  I increased the pasta to 2 cups and it was still very very cheesy, but good.  I also used whole wheat pasta and it was delicious.  My husband said it was awesome!

Really good mac and cheese! I used 2 cups of elbow macaroni, and a squirt of yellow mustard instead of the ground mustard. Came out just about perfect! Served with Ann's sisters meatloaf (on this site) and broccoli.

I chose this macaroni and cheese recipe because I am a mustard-lover.  However, the mustard ended up giving it a bit of a strange taste.  Other than this it was pretty good, so I will try this again with quite a bit less mustard.

very good base and if you follow it you'll have a good dish.  Made the 2nd time though (I hate to change it the first time through) I read the reviews and upped the mac to 2 cups, ratio was great.  I used american cheese and white cheddar for the other.  even better!  Thanks.

This tasted pretty good, but I thought the dried mustard gave it a strange after taste.  I also increased the macaroni to 2 1/2 cups and it was still VERY cheesy. I'll make again, but probably without the mustard and with even more macaroni...

This mac and cheese was great! I look the advice of some other reviews and decided the amount of cheese was a bit too much. But rather than use more macaroni, I just halved the cheese but used the same amount of milk and butter. It was so good! I made it again with 4oz cheddar and 4oz american, and it was even better. I also used whole milk since the recipe didn't specify. If you like your mac and cheese really creamy, just don't bake it. I tasted it before putting it in the pan to bake and it was yummy then, too (but I think it's better baked).

This was yummy!  25 min and the bottom had a black crust, but it didn't effect the rest of the dish.  When I make this again, I'll but it in the middle of the oven.  I thought the bread crums were a little weird, so I'll leave them off next time.  I doubled everything, and thought it was super tasty--5 guys at the office, and my 1 and 3 year old agree!

This turned out so very good!  I doubled it for a big pan, and it was my first homemade mac & cheese.

I was so worried because it looked watery and then it bubbled over and burnt in the oven.  (Putting it on a baking sheet next time).  I used a large flat casserol pan uncovered and omitted the bread crumbs.  

Next time I might get some asiago to sprinkle on top for some extra zing.

Leave it to a Mouse to get great cheese!  Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic recipe--I thought it might be a little too cheesy at first, but it turned out to be just right!  The best mac and cheese I've ever made myself.  We'll definitely make this one again.

This is really good and my husband goes nuts over it! I've made it both ways - one time with half American and Velveeta and the first time with half American and half shredded real cheese blend. My husband and I both liked the version with the real cheese the best. I use extra crumbs on top too. I also have made it with whole wheat elbow noodles. It's good, but not as good as with regular noodles.
