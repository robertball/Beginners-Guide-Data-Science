I made this late yesterday afternoon for my daughter's quickie on the go dinner. I didn't use processed cheese, but made my own cheese sauce using shredded cheddar. She loves mac and cheese and loves hotdogs, so of course, she thought this was super! Thanks Zaina!

Five stars just for the ease of this.  I also used homemade cheese sauce (Nacho Cheese Sauce, from this site) and about a cup of it as we like it to be creamier.  The baby LOVED this! I served it with fried fish without the hot dogs and then with the hot dogs for my non-fish eaters.  Thanks Zania!

Thank you!  It was driving me crazy that I could not find a recipe like this.  When I was pregnant, I used to make boxed mac & cheese and cut up hot dogs and cook it in it.  Now I make it all the time for my son, who absolutely loves it.  (Maybe because I craved it the whole time I was pregnant with him)  Now I can try it without the box mac & cheese.  Oh yeah, sometimes instead of hot dogs, i will throw some chicken nuggets into the mix.

everyone LOVED IT! i did change a few things. first i doubled it so that i could feed my family (4 of us) from one dish. (13x9) i buttered the pan to insure it didnt stick (and it would add great flavor to the dish too!) i added about a cup of cheddar jack shredded cheese and about a cup and a half of mixed veggies. and cumbled extra crackers in the mix. mixed all that together and then topped it with more cheese and parmasian and then the crackers too. afer salting and peppering to taste, it was so yummy! (oh and i used hot dogs instead of franks.) 
its a keeper!

This recipe was AWESOME.  Although seeing as I can never leave well enough alone, I made a few modifications.  I added 1 tablespoon of Parmesan, to the sauce along with 2 tablespoons of both garlic and onion powders.  Instead of just using extra old cheddar, I added in 1/4 cup of parmesan, this recipe was fantastic although next time I think i will cook it for 15 instead of 20 mins.  I used 1lb of pasta, I found that was enough, there is no way 7 ounces would be enough.

Easy to make.  I like the flavor of northern Italian seasoning, so I use that instead of the oregano.  Instead of process cheese sauce, I use 4 slices of american cheese melted with a couple tablespoons of milk.  I make the cheese sauce in the microwave while the macaroni boils.  My 2 year old eats this up.

This was my first attempt at "home-made" mac and cheese.  It was so easy and using the tip to make my own nacho sauce from the recipe on this site was a show stopper.  Using hotdogs seemed a little weird, but the kids liked it.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers and it turned out great.  I had dinner on the table in 30 minutes.  What a treat!

You'll crave a second helping! Very easy and quick to make. Can double the ingredients. Still tasted great even when we omitted the frankfurters.

5 stars for how easy it is, and it also tastes great!  I used inexpensive canned nacho cheese, so it was very economical as well.  Added diced tomato and omitted the franks, since it was to be a side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good but added a tablespoon of goat cheese, a teaspoon of pesto, an egg, and baked in the oven for 30 min at 400F.

All my kids loves this.  I did a couple things differently: I didn't have hot dogs so I planner on using bacon, but I forgot to buy some when shopping so I didn't use any meat.  I also didn't have any oregano so I just used some fresh parsley I had in the fridge.  I also didn't have any cheese sauce but I had some velveeta.  Melted and mixed this with some milk, stirred in my parsley, added some milk, poured right in the casserole dish for a little more moisture.  Sprinkled with plenty of mixed shredded cheese on top, crumbled up the Ritz and then sprinkled shredded parmesan on the top. All I can say was wow! I have picky kids and they all loved it!  I have to admit it was my fav mac & cheese to date as well.  My oldest loved the Ritz and parmesan on top was her favorite part.  Overall this recipe was a good start to get creative with, again mainly out of necessity so I cant really speak too much to this exact recipe actually.

I too made alterations as I needed a quick dish for a potluck. In a separate pan I melted butter, velveeta, Mac n cheese packets, milk, celery salt, dried chives, Italian seasoning, dash of cayenne & smoked paprika. After mixing the cheese with the pasta I sprinkled fresh Parmesan and bread crumbs! It tastes amazing! Thank you for an awesome base!

I saw where using Nacho Cheese crackers gives the mac and cheese a snappy taste rather than using crackers and I agree but your recipe is delicious...so Thanks
