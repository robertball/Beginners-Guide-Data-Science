This was an excellent recipe. I didn't use a bag of hash browns because I don't like foods that have preservatives and other added ingredients so I used about 7 smaller potatoes and shredded them on a cheese grate. I also didn't have enough milk on hand so I used about a cup of half and half and a cup of milk. Even with those small changes it was very tasty. Will be making this again!
