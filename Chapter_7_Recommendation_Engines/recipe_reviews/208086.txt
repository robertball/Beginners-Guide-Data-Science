These are great if you are a PBJ fan! Will make again with my favorite berry jam.  Maybe try with apricot.

These are SO good! I followed the recipe exactly, only I used strawberry jam. Oh- and I couldn't find brown sugar so I googled subsitutions and mixed 1 c. white sugar and 3 T molasses in the food processor until mixed. Worked beautifully! They are very crumbly and messy- not the compact car-snack I was hoping for. I may do 3/4 of the crumb mixture on the bottom and then just plop the rest on top so that the jam is more exposed and cooks more, it stays very runny.

This is a very crunchy, very sweet treat. A lover of extra crunchy peanut butter (PNB), I used it rather than smooth and salted butter. Warmed PNB in a glass jar set in boiling water. Having no whisk attachment for stand mixer, I used two dinner knives to cut butter into oat mix. Setting bowl aside I worked on the jelly. I was short on Grape jelly so used what I had in the frig: 3/4 cup Grape and 1/8 cup Red Plum jelly plus 1/4 cup of Strawberry preserves â€“ a little short on measurement, but it worked out okay. Instead of 15 minutes prep time, it took me 35 minutes. Cook time of 25-35 minutes turned into 38 minutes. Once pan was removed from oven and mix cooled I covered it with foil and let set overnight. First piece out of pan was semi-firm and too crumbly. Baked another 10 minutes in a 375 degree oven, enough to firm it up. Since the bars are much too sweet for me, I individually wrapped them, held one out for my sweet-toothed sister and froze 24 bars. The oat mix in itself is tasty and could be used to make bars without the jelly. Thanks for the memories of eating PBJ sandwiches in grade school.

These are wonderful cookie bars. I had some goober PNB so i used that. I am going to make these for VBS lunch dessert for 100 and plan to bake a double batch on a cookie sheet. Buy the way 2 graham crackers ground in the blender equal 1/4c.
