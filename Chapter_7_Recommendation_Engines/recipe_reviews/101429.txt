Made these tonight, as I was tired of making pork steaks the same way all the time.  I was worried that not marinating them ahead of time would leave them without much flavor, but they were so good!  Even my picky husband loved them.  I did make the sauce ahead of time to meld the flavors, and I didn't have garlic salt, so I put garlic powder, and just added a little salt to the mix.  I also used honey bbq sauce, so I used only half the amt of honey, and it had just the perfect amt of sweet.  I will definitely make these again!

Very tasty.  My family really liked this - even my finicky 3 year old son!

VERY GOOD!  I used boneless pork chops in place of the pork steaks.  I liked the fact that they didn't need to be marinated before grilling.  The honey made the barbecue sauce stickier and I liked that.  These were very tasty.

Hmm, I'm a little torn on these.  The flavour is okay, but it's a little sweet and seems to be missing something.  I used pork chops and marinated them in the sauce for 6 hours but they turned out a little dry.  Not sure what could be done to improve that?

These were ok. I think it is becasue they are pork steaks and I just don't care for that meat very much. I had to use my George Foreman grill, as we had 2 degree weather!! I ended up marinating the meat in the sauce for a couple hours and brushing a bit more on it before they were completely done grilling. The flavor was good....just not a fan of the meat. I am going to try this on pork chops instead.

Excellent flavor in the BBQ sauce.  Will use this sauce recipe for other meats that we will be barbecuing.

... Bar-be-qued bone-in pork chops: the sauce is indeed epic! The one criticism I have is the lack of pre-seasoning; at the very least, rub the "steaks" with salt and pepper, or better yet, do what I did and use your favorite bar-be-que rub before putting the meat on the grill.

I wasn't expecting to love this sauce, but I had the ingredients on hand and I figured I'd give it a try.  There is something about this honey barbecue on pork steak that is just super yummy.  I tried it on chicken and while it was good, it wasn't the same.  This is a perfect combination!
