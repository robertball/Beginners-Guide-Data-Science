Happily gobbled up at a Halloween 
pot-luck party. 
NOTE: The recipe doesn't list salt as an 
ingredient and uses oil instead of 
"salted" butter. I think the flavor is 
enhanced with an 1/8 to a 1/4 tsp. of 
salt.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  The reviews commented that it was more airy than your standard bar and had light pumpkin flavor; I like a lot of pumpkin so I used a whole can of pumpkin (about double what the recipe calls for) and compensated with an extra 1/4 c of flour and only half the amount of oil.  The result:  very dense and pumpkiny, very delicious.  I also added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 c of walnuts as recommended.

These bars were very moist and very good.  I used half wheat flour and half applesauce and canola oil in place of the vegi. oil.  It worked out fine and makes it a bit healthier.  I will use another teaspoon of pumpkin spice next time.

As a low-carb dieter, I am always looking for recipes I can adapt to suit my diet, and this one worked perfectly!  The relatively small amounts of flour and sugar were easily adaptable and these still came out moist and flavorful.  I reduced the raisins and added chopped pecans to mine.  These would be great either frosted or just dusted with powdered sugar.  I will definately make them again.

I made this recipe but made them as muffins and they are so good.  my kids thought they were great.   I left out the raisins on half of the muffins.  they are moist and the pumpkin flavor is light.  I will definitely make these again.

An excellent, easy recipe for pumpkin bars!  I omitted the raisins just because I prefer them without, but I also did find out that the glaze tends to sink right into the bars if left covered overnight - so my advice is to wait until you're about to serve them to glaze them.  I'll definitely make these again, they were a big hit!

Good and moist, but I wouldn't call this a bar.  It's a light, spongy pumpkin cake.  I tend to think of bars as more dense.  I made the recipe as is and mine was done by 30 min.  I didn't have maple syrup, so I just used powdered sugar and water and lightly drizzled it on top.  This cake is very light, so cutting them into bars won't work.  I just made them into little cake squares.  My kids loved them. Good simple recipe for an everyday dessert.  I wouldn't make it for company.

Great recipe! I enjoyed  eating this one. And my friends loved it too. The only thing i changed is that i used 2 cups of pumpkin puree instead of one and a pinch of salt. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!

Great! So happy to find a recipe with much less oil. Actually, I didn't even have 1/2 c. oil (I used 1/3 c. and just added a little bit more pumpkin). Just a teensy weensy spongy, but covered in cream cheese frosting, DELISH!  These were thinner than I like, so maybe I'd use a 9x9 pan.  Didn't use raisins or maple glaze.

This was a wonderful recipe! I took it to work today and everyone gobbled it up. I used pecans instead of raisins and egg substitute instead of the eggs. Turned out terrific. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I look forward to making it again and again on chilly nights!

This tastes good but it's more like spice cake than pumpkin bars.  It's disappointing if you are expecting a dense pumpkin dessert.

Soo good! I love them! As most have already said, it is more like a cake than a bar. I used 1/2 cup walnuts instead of raisins and added some vanilla to my icing. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious.  Definitely a cake-like consistency.  The maple and powdered sugar glaze is well-worth making also.  I forgot to add the raisins until it was in the oven.  I'm sure that they would have made it even better.  I just remembered, I did use 1/2 brown sugar and half whole wheat flour.9

I first tried this one back in 2010 but was too rushed to review it.  Since I had to come back and reprint it I am taking the time to give it the kudos it deserves.  Every time I've made these bars all who try them ask for the recipe.  I skip the glaze because maple syrup is too hard to come by here in Greece but no one seems to miss it, and I use extra virgin olive oil because that is readily available and inexpensive here.  Personally the baking soda provides enough salt for my taste.  When I do add the raisins I only use 1/2 cup of sugar, if I add nuts instead then I use the full cup. I also find that if you mix the pie spices with the moist rather than the dry ingredients the flavors pop more so one teaspoon does the trick. Tasty, easy to prepare and comparatively high on the "good for you" scale!

These pumpkin bars are delicious and were a big hit at home and work. I used craisins instead of raisins. Yum! The only criticism of this recipe is the maple glaze. 1/2 cup of powered sugar and 1 Tbls of maple syrup made a gummy lump. I kept adding maple syrup alternating with small amounts of water to thin it out enough to frost. Bars were great - glaze not so much.

Took the advice of the other reviewers and used a whole can (15oz) of pumpkin, cut the oil to 1/3 cup, used brown instead of white sugar, added 2tsp cinnamon, 1/2tsp ginger, 1/2tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg instead of pumpkin spice mix, added 1/4 cup pecans. Everything else stayed the same. Turned out moist and deliciously spicy. I'm not a huge sugar consumer, so next time I would cut down on the sugar a bit and not use the glaze.

Served these at a Tupperware party...none left. I read they were kinda thin so I made 1 and a half the recipe in a 9x13 pan with pecans instead of raisins.

I lightened this up with applesauce for half the oil and egg beaters.  The consistency of the bar is spot on and very moist.  I did not care for the raisins in it and when I make it again, I would not use them.  By request I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze.  Tasty and will go well with the ham dinner tonight.

These "bars" are pretty cake-like, but they have a great flavor and the glaze is delicious. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recommendation to add more pumpkin, increase flour, and reduced oil. Chocolate chips added a nice sweetness in lieu of the raisins.

I made a few changes because I did want them to be more like a real “bar” than a cake so followed one of the other suggestions and used a full can of pumpkin, more flour (1/4 C) less oil (only 1/3 C) and used half butter and half shortening and a little heavier on the spices. They definitely didn’t rise and were flatter and denser but not sure if because my baking soda/powder were old?? The taste/texture are growing on me... we’ll see how they go over at the picnic today!

I added 1/2 cup more pumpkin as i cook my own and 1 tsp of salt.  My dinner guests and family loved it. :-) I topped it off with cream cheese icing.

I use double the recipe, and use two sticks  of butter, add two tablespoons of molasses , cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon instead of oil and spice and it  bakes wonderfully.

great tasting pumpkin bars...moist. I used 15 oz can of pumpkin and reduced oil by half as suggested in other reviews..I had trouble with icing...and blotted most of it off...then sprinkled some sifted conf sugar to cover my mistake!
I will make another batch for Thanksgiving!

I used 2 cups of sweet potatoes in place of the 1 cup of pumpkin, and added extra flour to compensate.  They are fantastic!  I used organic sugar and whole wheat flour.  I left out the raisins as my husband is not a fan.  I will be making these again!
