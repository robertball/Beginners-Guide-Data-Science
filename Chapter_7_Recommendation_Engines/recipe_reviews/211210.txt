This recipe is fantastic.  I ignored the order of the instructions as indicated in other reviews which was helpful.  I made the rice and stuffing individually using broth instead of water.  I sauteed shallots, garlic, green apples, celery and mushrooms in olive oil and then combined this mixture with dried cranberries, pecans, the rice and stuffing.  I topped the stuffed squash with French's onions and grated parmesan which browned nicely.  This recipe was flavorful, filling and tastes wonderfully of Thanksgiving!

This was fantastic. The only problem was that the recipe is listed in a bad order, I'm going to make it in the exact opposite order next time.  It was also very good with little cubes of chicken mixed in the stuffing.

Delicious!  Im a vegetarian, and I had this as my main course for Thanksgiving.  It was amazing.  I did tweak it a bit by adding poultry seasoning instead of the fresh sage, and I added dried cranberries instead of mushrooms.

Very good - the directions are definitely backwards - 1) start the rice first (I added celery and carrot), 2) then do the stuffing (on the stove top), 3) then bake the squash. I think the squash needed a salt rub before baking - it was pretty bland. My kids weren't big fans of the squash, so next time I will not stuff them, but cut them into cubes and toss them in with the stuffing and rice before baking. I ended up making only 2 squash, and did the full stuffing/rice recipe, and the extra stuffing filled up a pie pan nicely, and gave the kids a better stuffing to squash ratio.

I improvised some, but this was a fantastic meal! I had to cook the squash about 10 min longer than the recipe indicated in both places. I don't care for mushrooms, I didn't have any sage, and I only had chicken stock, so those were all left out/subsituted. I used an Uncle Ben's wild rice mix (one small box) since there weren't any bags of it in my neighborhood store, but it was great anyway! As another reviewer suggessted, I added dried cranberries, which was absolutely perfect. Not to mention being tasty, it is healthy and filling. Will be making again!

If you are veg, try and give this dish moisture by adding sliced apple. Ooooh so yum. I am not veg, but I add apple suasage slices to this. Again for the meat eaters out there, YUMMY. The sausage and apple go nicely with the wild rice. A little brown sugar and "REAL" butter are the key.

Very nice fall meal.  I added diced cooked chicken in the mixture and drizzled extra stock on top to keep it from getting too dry.  I will sprinkle pecans on top next time to add a little texture.

LOVE this recipe!! I make it ALL the time and still continue to love it. It is so easy to change up too. I like to use quinoa and cut up chunks of butternut squash in it instead of acorn squash. It's a go to recipe!!

Honestly I completely did my own thing; I give it a 5 star rating because of the concept of stuffing the squash. I’ve made two different stuffings for these and they both came out great. I love using leftovers to create new meals, I don’t like to waste. The first stuffing I made was with brown rice, finely chopped mushrooms, some onion; I also threw in some leftover lean pork cooked with fresh garlic. I had some extra beef broth so I used that and some regular stuffing mix I also had left over. Make sure your stuffing has a strong flavor; the acorn squash itself has a light flavor to it. The second stuffing which I made last night- I used brown rice again, sautéed onion and left over turkey meatballs, I used a cheese grater to grate them, beef broth and stuffing mix. I wasn’t too crazy about the flavor at first so I added, garlic powder, salt and pepper, teaspoon of butter and a little milk. I don’t measure much when I do my little creations, so I wouldn’t recommend this unless you cook the same way. Constantly taste before adding new things! Hope this helps.

This was a really great idea, but they would taste much better with homemade stuffing... it lacked flavor with the box.  Also, this recipe made more than enough stuffing for the squash... I froze a whole tupperware full of the stuffing that was left over .  We really love stuffing and squash both; it just didn't work with store bought box stuff.  Sorry.

The following day I scooped out the stuffing and added sauteed sausage and feta cheese.  Very tasty.  I guess that for us any vegetarian recipe benefits with the addition of a little meat!

Great dish! I made this dish for my vegan mom and she really liked it. I added dried cranberries, which turned the dish a little too sweet than I would've liked, but overall I got positive reviews. I think I overcooked the rice and stuffing mix because the texture turned out to be close to that of mashed potatoes. Also, you don't have to use the packaged stuffing. If you make your own stuffing, you can use that instead, because it's difficult to find packaged stuffing that is vegetarian.

It looks very pretty, but disappointing in the actual delivery. It needs a good sauce or something on it to make it worth the effort of it. Would probably not make again unless I had acorn squash I had to use up.  Changes I made because I used what was on hand:  Added  celery, carrots, zucchini and yellow squash, salt, pepper and poultry seasoning  Sub white rice, water (no stock on hand), left over pumpernickel bread (instead of stuffing)  I agree with others - needs to be cooked longer and would do in reverse order.

This recipe tasted pretty good ,I used leftover stuffing from thanksgiving and added sausage. I must say though the stuffing dried out during the cooking maybe needs to be covered in tin foil also it took much longer for the squash to be done i would preheat longer.

I've made this several different ways and everytime it's so unbelievably good. I've added ground Italian sausage, celery and dried cranberries. With the rice and stuffing base have fun adding whatever your tastebuds are calling.

As I sit here writing this, it is Thanksgiving Eve, and I'm bringing this to dinner tomorrow.  I sauted the onion in olive oil and added the garlic (I minced it) and mushrooms.  Then I added the rice and broth.  The stuffing was made separately without seasonings.  After I cooked the squash, , I removed the squash from the skin and mixed everything together before stuffing the squash shells.  I can't wait to dig into this because the stuffing tastes so good.  Next time I will add some vegetarian sausage or cranberries, as someone else suggested.

I made this recipe as is. I personally had no trouble making in the order as written. The stuffing was very moist. I can comment I would bake the squash longer. Considering squash comes in all shapes and sizes, this was not enough time for mine to be "right". Maybe another 30 minutes on top of the stated time. I used plain wild rice (didn't have mix on hand) and yes I did have extra stuffing, but not a lot. It is more on the savory side. Next time, I would add "fake" sausage (for a veggie meal) and maybe dried cherries. But that is a different recipe for another time. Pretty good over all. Thanks!

As written this is OK next time I will take some reviewers suggestions on adding things like the cranberries and I think I will also just cut up the squash and make it a one dish  meal and I think a sprinkle of cheese on top will make it just perfect.  The only thing in the recipe that I did not follow was using premade boxed cornbread mix.  I make my own cornbread I know for sure what's in it then and can make it healthier than anything from a box.

I loved this!  I used box rice with seasoning, because I didn't read the directions well before I bought it.  And I didn't want to spend almost $3 for fresh sage, so I got  sage flavored stuffing mix.  I also added turkey sausage.  I roasted the seeds and put some on top when it was all done.  I had a lot of extra stuffing, which is great, because the kids will eat it by itself.

I happen to like acorn squash very much.  I never stuffed it before so I thought I would try something different.  It was awesome.  A definite must do again.

Delicious and super flexible. I roasted the squash seeds in the oven (next to the squash) until well browned and added them to the stuffing instead of nuts. And I cubed up some stale bread and used that instead of wild rice. One half squash made a really satisfying supper.

This was dry when I tasted the stuffing. I added broth to the stuffing. I used chicken broth, but veggie would work. I also dotted the top of the stuffing with butter. Sorry vegans...With these changes, it was * * * * * !!!

This is delightful!  The cornbread and sage really add a lot of flavor to this.  I added fresh cranberries instead of dried, plus shallots and French's onions on top. The salt from the fried onions really add to the flavor and the crunch is nice.  I don't think you even need to add meat to this recipe.  Very hearty and seasonal.  Will definitely make this again!

My family is trying to eat healthier-including having vegetarian meals several nights a week-this recipe is vegetarian friendly--it only required substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth..simple to do.  It wasn't a real rave dinner but most of the family-except the 10 year old-thought it was ok-not wonderful but ok.

Son in law is allergic to mushrooms so I threw in a handful of dried cranberries-for some reason it sounded good and did add a touch of sweetness to a savory dish.

Easy to make when you microwave the acorn squash for 10 minutes instead of using the oven to soften them and again use the microwave at the end to heat the stuffed squash.  I used a rice cooker to make the wild rice mix then put it into the onion, garlic and broth skillet at the end to give the rice a bit of flavor.  

I'll try it again in a couple of months and add a leek or two to the onion mix..I love using leeks in my soups and I think it would add a lot to this dish.  I also used last nights left over corn bread as we had half a pan left and it was also left out and got dried out..perfect to crumble up and fold into the mixture at the end.

A great recipe and one I modified to make quicker by using Rice-A-Roni wild rice. The vegitarians in the family loved it. The only problem I could see is a whole half of squash is a very large portion, especially for a child, so we cut ours in quarters after we stuffed them, but the next time we will cube up the squash and serve it in individual dishes as others have suggested. I do not like squash, but from the raves I got, everyone else does! A very happy cook!

Really yum!  I tried replacing cornbread stuffing, rice and omitting mushrooms with all herbed stuffing mix and chunks of white meat chicken (like Thanksgiving).  Serve with homemade cranberry sauce!

Took a leap and made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was a hit! The only thing I changed was that  I tripled the sage to make sure some of the flavor came through. Satisfying winter meal the the whole family appreciated

This was delicious. I used an extra cup of broth because I like a moist stuffing. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. This would be a great elegant choice for the vegetarian/vegan at your Thanksgiving table.

we loved this! Definitely a keeper!!  I made it according to the instructions but it can be very versatile.  My husband suggested adding some chicken.  I think dried cranberries would be a nice addition.

when I roasted the squash initially, I did season it with some salt and pepper.

Made it exactly according to the directions and in the order listed. Turned out very good. Had some stuffing left over so I added some cream of mushroom soup, sweet corn, lima beans and cheese on top for a casserole the next day. I will definately make this again.

Roasted the butternut seeds 15 minutes with a roasted garlic, rosemary & sea salt seasoning. Topped the stuffing rice mixture to ad a little crunch. Also used vegetable broth instead of water. Yummy.

This recipe is really good, but since I buy mostly organic foods, I had to change two ingredients. I substituted an organic brand of corn bread mix and a quinoa and brown rice precooked packet.

I make this, but do not use corn bread or stuffing mix. Just rice, veggies and some cubed cheese. Sometimes I use wild rice or black rice in addition to some white rice. Soooo delish.

YUM!  I cooked my squash a full 40 mins before adding the stuffing mix.  I also added spices to our taste and doubled the stuffing mixture so I'd have a full 9x13 pan to make as well.   
 We happily ate it for lunch or dinner for a week!

I followed the order of the recipe and had no issues, not sure what confused folks. I added pre-roasted chicken breasts to the rice mix and the chicken broth. I did cheat a bit and cut off the bottom of the squash so it would sit flat and only cut the tops off the squash (they were fairly small). Absolutely delicious. It was a meal on its own and was amazing! The sweetness of the acorn squash with the chicken rice and stuffing was a wonderful fall meal.

Hearty, filling, and filled with the flavors of fall! I chopped up two slices of bacon and sautéed in a pan, then browned half a pound of ground venison with the bacon. Mixed in with the stuffing and rice mixture. Would increase cooking time on squash before filling, came out a little al dente for our liking. May try increasing the sage next time. Mmm!

Meh- I didn't realize that seasoned stuffing mix meant "Stove Top" or the generic equivalent. I used regular cornbread stuffing mix and used my favorite stuffing recipe, because that is what I had on hand. The results were just OK. I might give this another try, but I'm just as likely to try something else.

Absolutely delicious!  The listed sequence needs adjusting, as mentioned in other reviews.  It should be:  step 3, step 1, step 2 then step 4.  Anyway, I will certainly make it again, possibly with either dried cranberries or chopped apple.

Good as a side dish.  1/4 squash was the perfect amount.

Not a fan.  Just didn't taste very good in our opinion.

Delicious!  It's nice to find some meatless recipes that don't rely on tons of cheese for all their flavor.  I eliminated about half the butter from the stuffing mix, and didn't miss it.  You can speed up cooking the squash by starting it in the microwave.  I had a lot of extra stuffing mix that didn't fit into the squash but it's so tasty I won't have any trouble using it up as a lunch or side dish.

These babies got GOBBLED UP on Thanksgiving! I did add dried cranberries, but otherwise made as-is.

This was just ok. No one really ate it. I enjoyed the filling but the squash was dry and tasteless. I did have to substitute another type of squash since acorns aren't in season yet.

Dry, add something like apples for moisture. Also, cooking time for squash needs to be increased and cook stuffing first. Tasty.
