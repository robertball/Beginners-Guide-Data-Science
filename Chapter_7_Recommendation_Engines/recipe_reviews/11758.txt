Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don't need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind. This is SO MUCH BETTER than the sour cream version!

Hey yo, what's up fellow cookers??  Check it...I hate when people give extraordinary recipes ratings that they don't deserve.  I sort my recipies by "most helpful." Every person that I know who knows anything about cooking KNOWS to cover up whatever it is that they are baking so it won't dry up.  Now that I got that off my chest, I just want to say that this is definitely "HALL OF FAME" material.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe with the exception of how I layered it.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to put the sauce mixture directly on top of the ziti, then add the cheese, sour cream and so forth.  I even stirred the bottom layer of ziti and sauce together before I added anything else just to make sure that the sauce ran all through the noodles.  I may try Ricotta cheese next time just to see the difference in taste or may mix Ricotta with the sour cream. Grease the pan real well before you put anything in it....or just use a non-stick cooking spray.  If you like your meals cheesier, meatier or saucier, than you can add a little more, but that's strictly on your preference.  Oh yeah.......keep in mind that this meal does make a huge dish so you might want to have a smaller baking dish on the side for any extra that doesn't fit in the first one.  Better safe than sorry.....and trust...YOU WON'T BE SORRY FOR MAKING THIS AT ALL!!!!

I'm rating this only a 3 star because the recipe doesn't tell you to bake it COVERED!  I baked uncovered and it dried out.  Not good, and certainly not "Hall of Fame" worthy.  I'll try it again, but definitely covered when baking.

Just made this dish for dinner tonight and it was delicious. Instead of greasing the pan (I used a Pyrex dish) with butter, I sprayed a light coating of Pam; the pan was a breeze to clean afterward. Per some of the suggestions other reviewers made, I added minced garlic and had put the sauce directly on the ziti, before the provolone. Because I like the pasta to soak up the flavor of the sauce, I did the same for the top layer ziti, (adding the sauce to the ziti before the mozerella cheese). Since I wasn't sure if doing so would make the pasta too soft, I shaved a minute off of the suggested pasta boiling time. It came out perfect, this recipe is a keeper.

I love this recipe!  It gets five stars because, made as directed, it's absolutely delicious; creamy, savory and just perfect.  If I could give this recipe more stars, I would, because it's also extremely flexible.  I've made this with Italian sausage or ground turkey instead of the beef.  I've also made a vegetarian version by substituting sliced zucchini and mushrooms for the meat.  Sometimes I add chopped garlic and fennel seed.  (There's something about fennel seed that, to me, is integral to Italian cooking.  It's like cilantro to Mexican food.)  Obviously, the key to the greatness of this recipe is the substitution of a layer of sour cream and provolone for the usual ricotta.  That's what makes the dish so moist and creamy.  Who hasn't make a beautiful lasagna only to have it dry out in the oven?  I like ricotta as much as the next Italian-American, but the stuff is pretty dry and really adds no flavor.  It's essentially just a binder.  Here, the combination of the provolone melting into the sour cream is truly inspired; the sour cream adds moisture and the provolone adds flavor.  I'm planning to use the same combo instead of ricotta in my next lasagna.  The importance of using a high-quality sauce for this recipe almost goes without saying, so I'll stop here.  Thanks, Colleen!

Rewrite of review - 
This was one of the first recipes I found on Allrecipes back in 2002.  Just made it again last night for friends (including 2 kids..who including the adults..went for seconds) and family.  This dish makes plenty of leftovers - pack them in tupperware and freeze for another night. Always a fantastic turnout with this dish!!
Did make a few altercations though...as always:
Didnt realize i picked up Penne pasta instead of Ziti at the store.  I omitted the onions. Used hot italian turkey sausage (squeezed the meat out of the casings and cooked it like you'd cook ground beef).  Seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Mrs Dash.  Added 2 TBS of minced garlic to browning meat.  Added 1 (drained) can of mushroom pieces with stems.  Added 2 jars of pasta sauce and let simmer for 15 mins.  Halved the amount of (reduced fat/light) sour cream and replaced it with (reduced fat/light) ricotta.  And used the rest of the ingredients off the recipe.  Layered PAM sprayed Pyrex baking dishes like so...Ziti, sauce, Provolone, Sour Cream, Ricotta, ziti, rest of sauce and Sargento's Italian 6 Shredded Cheese Blend - Mozzarella, Provolone, Asiago and Parmesan.  Covered with foil and baked for 30 mins.  :) Yummmmy 
**TIP**
Unless you have a big family or are having company...i suggest if you are feeding up to 4 people to half the recipe. 
Thanks Colleen for a great recipe!

This is great! I use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound Italian sausage and add onion, green pepper and garlic while browning. I add 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives to the sauce. I mix the pasta and meat sauce together, place half the mixture in the pan, then the sour cream and 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining cheese. I like the pasta completely coated with sauce. I use shredded Italian blend cheese and PILE it on, at least double what the recipe calls for, and increase the Parmesan as well. Definitely use 2 jars of sauce, it sounds like a lot but other wise the Ziti will be dry. This is perfect for a family gathering, it makes a lot.

Delicious and great make-ahead recipe for entertaining.  Read a ton of the reviews and recommend following changes suggested by others: use larger dish (31/2-4 qt.), saute several cloves of minced garlic w/meat and onion, add layer of sauce over ziti before provolone/sour cream layer, cover while baking so it doesn't dry out, if making ahead and refrigerating, be sure to double the cooking time.  I used Bertolli Five Cheese spaghetti sauce with a little sugar and crushed red pepper -- excellent!  If

This was a really good recipe.  I wasn't able to find any sliced provolone cheese so I substituted it w/ a shredded cheese w/ provolone in it.  It still came out great, but it was difficult to spread the sour cream.  That was easily corrected by placing the sour cream in a zip lock bag, snipping a corner, and then evenly spreading it over the ingredients.  Everyone in my family loved it!

This recipe was easy and good, and as other reviewers have said it is very similar to lasagna.  I would make one change next time I make it and put the bottom layer of sauce dirctly on the noodles, then the cheese on top of that.  When assembled as directed, the provolone cheese layer made a barrier and kept the sauce away from the noodles below and made for a layer of naked noodles at the bottom.  I also ended up with extra sauce while assembling because it didn't settle down to the bottom.   This recipe makes a VERY full 9X13 pan, and definitely use a well seasoned sauce (like tomato & basil) and the half & half ground beef and italian sausage. My 3 year old really like it too!  Thank you!

The reason why I love this site, is to be able to try new recipes.  If you are going to suggest making a completely different recipe in a REVIEWRATE, then submit your own recipe.  It's not fair to the other person to have their version shot down completely.

**I made this and took it to a family reunion this past summer....it was a big hit!  Try it, you will be pleasantly surprised!**

This was delicious, the only thing I changed was the addition of salt and pepper and 2 cloves minced garlic. Side note:  I've noticed many of the reviews who rated this recipe low had modified the ingredients, in particular using ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.  I thought the sour cream added a wonderful flavor and feel there is already plenty of cheese flavor and no need for ricotta.  Reviewers need to remember that when modifying or customizing ingredients of recipes to their own liking or opinion it is inappropriate to leave a poor or low review or rating.

Love this Ziti!!!  Simple to prepare, flavorful, and very easy to modify based on your own family's preferences.  I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of the spaghetti sauce.  As I didn't have any, I defrosted John Chandler's sauce from his "World's Best Lasagna" listed on Allrecipes.  I'm sure using his sauce made all the difference!  Thanks Colleen for submitting this recipe!

Simply delicious! This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal.  So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I added 1/2 lb. of sausage to the ground beef and onion along with some fresh minced garlic.  And, to the sauce I added a little red wine and some Italian seasoning to give a bit of a flavor boost.  The sour cream was a nice change from the usual ricotta cheese and I just eyeballed the other cheeses when layering.  I covered it and baked it a little longer than 30 minutes leaving it uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  Great with garlic bread and a salad!

I've made this twice now: the first time with the ricotta substitution (per other reviews) and the second time with the sour cream (per the recipe). If you like a creamy sauce with your pasta, stick with the recipe.  This was more to our taste and liking.  Ricotta is too dry for Baked Ziti IMHO.  I mixed half of the meat sauce with half of the ziti for first layer (stir to coat the ziti), added provolone and sour cream, then added the other half of the ziti and meat sauce.  Topped with mozzarella and parmesan.  Cook covered for 30 min, took foil off last 5 min to brown the cheese.  It is super easy and tastes great, and worthy of company.

I hope you are still reading your reviews, Colleen, after at least 2 years.  This is the BEST BAKED ZITI!  Your recipe is WONDERFUL as it is written, not to be changed.   The sour cream and provolone is what makes it SPECIAL and DIFFERENT.  Don't substitute anything.  I used "Classico Sausage & Pepper" sauce and it was perfect, I destroyed my old baked ziti recipe.

This was great!!! I modified a few things from reading other reviews. I changed the serving size to 4 and that filled a 9x13 pan alone! I also did half ground beef and half ground sausage and used garlic powder and oregano when I browned it. I also used half sour cream and half ricotta cheese. Came out really good. I love cheese so I used a whole 16oz. of mozzarella.  With the sauce I used half in my meat mixture and mixed the other half with the ziti noodles so they were completely covered in and out. Also when you bake it, COVER it with foil and the last 5 minutes uncover it and broil it so it gets that nice crispy brown topping! I loved it and my husband did also! Definitely a keeper!!!

I was surprised at how good this was.  I used organic, low fat sour cream; organic pasta sauce and 5% fat ground meat.  I didn't expect much from this recipe but will definitely make this again.  I think the sour cream did the trick.  Now I'm wondering if sour cream would be a good replacement for ricotta in lasagne!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I must agree with a few of the other reviewers - the sour cream just doesn't fit the dish perfectly.  I love sour cream, but I think the sour cream and provolone cheese would best be replaced by ricotta cheese.  If you do that, and add in a little spinach, this becomes a very easy lasagna like dish.  WARNING!  This recipe fills a HEAPING 9x13 pan...so don't add anything unless you subtract something or it will not fit!!  You could easily 1/2 this recipe and still generously feed a family of 4 and still have leftovers.  Great staple to use in your regular menu rotation!  Thanks!

This recipe Is WONDERFUL !!!. I Made this for dinner last night with garlic cheese bread - It was AWESOME !!! I used 1.5 lb.ground beef.I added the noodles to the meat sauce so it would soak into the noodles.Spray pan with cooking spray.I put half the pasta meat sauce in the pans (I used 2 pans because it made a lot) layered the provolone, sour cream and Mozzarella. Then put the rest of the pasta meat sauce on top and sprinkled with parmesan. Make sure you cover it with foil. I did add extra cheese - I like cheesy. The provolone was kind of hard to slice – next time I will have the deli slice it or buy it already sliced. YUMMY !!!!! (update) I gave this recipe to my sister and she said it was absolutely Wonderful !!! I froze half of it. I took it out of the freezer, put it into a casserole dish and covered with tin foil - baked at 350 for one hour YUMM!!!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe !!!!

GREAT Recipe! BUT you MUST cover the dish with foil before putting it in the oven. I spotted this issue with the recipe before making it, but an inexperienced cook may not. 
Also, Mix the Ziti with the Sauce prior to layering cheeses. I just mix my pasta and sauce together, then layer 1/2 pasta and sauce mix, provolone, sour cream, 1/2 pasta, mozzerella on top. It is great. You can also add kalamato olives and mushrooms to the sauce for great flavor bonuses. I use Classico brand Tomato & Basil Sauce. It's perfect with this recipe and two jars is jut the right amount. 
TRUST THE SOUR CREAM!! I do not use ricotta. It's too heavy and not worth it. The sour cream is simple and it tastes amazing when it's done. TRUST IT.
I'll make this again, for sure. The whole family loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe, tastier than your standard baked ziti, in fact much tastier than any I've had from a restaurant.  The addition of provolone and substitution of sour cream (for ricotta) really kick up the flavor and makes it more savory.  My wife who never really cared for baked ziti loves this dish.  We use the "Old Italian Meat Sauce" recipe on this website which is really good.  A little bit of advice for everyone who thinks of using ricotta instead of sour cream.  Stop!!! Don't!!!.  Once you do that it's pretty much just the standard old boring recipe.  The sour cream is integral to making this dish such a keeper.

This was a big hit with my family.  I used a jar of Ragu sauce with Romano cheese flavoring and was very happy with the results!

I halved this recipe to fit a 8x8 dish and it was FULL. I used some leftover homemade spaghetti sauce. I also used ridged mostaccioli pasta (it's similar to ziti in shape except it has ridges on it that better hold the sauce). I also used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. My grocery store was out of provolone and I used shredded mozzarella and colby jack. Even with the alterations I made, it turned out excellent. I served it with crusty garlic bread and it was a very filling meal. One last thing, since I was using homemade sauce out of the fridge, it was cold and I had to cook it about 50 min. So if you do this too, make sure you cook it long enough to warm everything up. Thanks for a great recipe Colleen!

I can not believe the rave reviews I received from this dish. My dad said he has never tasted any pasta dish that was a good as this one!!! I only made two slight adjustments to the ingredients, I used 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb of ground sausage, and I also added garlic. 
UPDATE: I made this recipe again using fat free sour cream and cheese, big mistake, it lost all the flavor. Stick to the regular stuff

Wow!  This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it twice now, and it was great both times.  I did cut the recipe in half, and it was enough for a couple of meals for the two of us.  The first time, I used the amount of sour cream called for.  The second time, I used half ricotta and half sour cream.  They were both good, but it definitely needs some sour cream - it gives it a distinct flavor.  This is a good meal for any night, but also would be perfect for company.  It's very easy to put together.  A lot of the taste of lasagna without all the work.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a delicious recipe!  I made half the recipe for the two of us and there was a perfect amount for a hearty dinner and lunch the next day for both of us.  We're vegetarian so I made it meatless.  I did add some Veggie sausages (Morningstar), but we both didn't really think they added to the taste of the dish very much.  I did, saute onions, green peppers, mushrooms and garlic in a pot, and then added the sauce to the mixture.  I added sun dried tomatoes, italian seasonings, salt, black pepper and crushed red pepper (we obviously like it spicy) to the sauce.  Then, instead of layering the ziti and the sauce, I just mixed the cooked ziti into the sauce.  That way, there was no plain pasta at the bottom of the pan.  Then I layered with the provelone, sour cream, mozzarella and parmesean.  I did use light sour cream (not nonfat).  It barely fit into my 8x8 pan.  I'm making this again this weekend for guests and will probably pair it with a garden salad and breadsticks.  Yum!

I thought this was pretty good, but nothing too amazing. I cut the recipe in half and it fed 2 adults and 3 small children and had leftovers. I left out the Parmesan since we didn't have any.

Liked this recipe.  I omitted the onion and substituted ricotta for the sour cream per my family's tastes.  I also mixed an egg into the ricotta to make it fluffy.  I mixed the sauce and meat together and the ziti and the ricotta together.  I layered the meat sauce first, then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, and parmesan.  Ingredients made two layers.  I chopped up the provolone and topped the dish prior to baking.  Baked covered.

This is a very good, and hearty dish, BUT, next time when I make it I will do the following: Substitute Ricotta for the Sour Cream. And, substitute Ground Sausage for the Ground Beef. This I feel will make for a more delicious dish.

BTW, this is a large dish. I filled up an entire 9x13 casserole dish, and my husband, son and I did not stop eating the leftovers until the 3rd day. So, you may want to halve this recipe as it can be too big.

This is Superb! Although I did alter a little away from recipe. I added minced garlic to my hamburger meat & other seasonings. The next time I make this I will Layer it different as the bottom layer was a lil' dry. I would recommend 1/2 pasta then some sauce then the following ingredients. Daughter says its better than Lasagna which she don't care for. All in all this was good. Do put some sauce on bottom atop of pasta! Makes a pan full I used a 9x14

OK- here's my saga.  I totally disagree with negative feedback on this recipe.  I made major mistakes and it still turned out great.  What did I do wrong you ask?  Well... way too much sour cream (when it cooks it thickened and it was great), too much cheese, ingredients in the wrong order, no onion- just onion powder, and wrong kind of pasta.  Regardless of all this, the kids were waiting for it when it came out of the oven.  I served it to family (2 picky kids) and neighbor and all ate 2 platefuls.  Not too cheesy or saucy at all.  Did cook for 20 minutes longer.  Biggest hint from me: use a good sauce, as most store boughts are gross.  Good luck!

This was really great.  I used skroodles, and it was perfect.  I too was skeptical about the sour cream, but it was great.  I used light sour cream, and it was fine.  I also doctored the sauce and meat up quite a bit with fresh garlic, garlic powder, dried basil, crushed red pepper, black pepper, salt and a touch of sugar for a little sweetness (I find that it gives jarred sauce more of a homemade taste).  Also, I halved the recipe and still had tons and tons of yummy pasta.  This is going to be a family favorite for many years to come.

This is, by far, the BEST ziti I have ever eaten.  It is so easy and yet so incredibly flavorful.  It has a much more distinct flavor than the recipes that use ricotta cheese and come out tasting bland.  It also doesn't come out as dry as a lot of ziti recipes do.  It is excellent the second day, as well!

I used the 48 oz. jar of original Prego instead of 2-26 oz. jars, and it was a perfect amount and flavor.  It is a lot of food to squeeze into the small 13x9 baking dish, but it will fit, and it will be gone before you know it.  The entire family loved it, kids and adults alike.  THANK YOU!

The first time I tried this recipe, using fat-free sour cream, I didn't see what all the fuss was about.  I tried it again with full-fat sour cream after reading some reviews and discovered just how wonderful this dish is!  I was cooking for a vegetarian, so I substituted Morningstar's veggie crumbles for the ground beef, and I added some sliced portabello mushrooms and minced garlic to the sauce as well.  This was one of the easiest dishes I have ever made, and so good, too!

This was awesome! I used homemade spaghetti sauce with Italian sausage instead of ground beef and it turned out soooo delicious! Also used half sour cream and half ricotta cheese. Definitely will be putting this under family favorites.

This was AMAZING! I was a bit hesitant to use sour cream instead of Ricotta but I'm glad I did. I also dont think it's fair to change the recipe in any way and not give five stars. I abhor jar sauce (and Ive tried them all). I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" on this site and it was just perfect. The only thing I did differently was use a bigger pan and covered it until the last 5 minutes.

This was the best Ziti I have ever made. I've tossed my old recipe. Thansk Colleen!

This is one of my most requested dishes at family gathering's! Alway's a big hit and gobbled up. I love the special taste the sour cream gives this dish. 
Concerning the calories,etc.,you can use ground turkey or no meat at all,fat free sour cream.

I changed this up a little. I used ground hot italian sausage in place of the ground beef, and added 2 garlic cloves to the onions. I mixed the cooked pasta with the sauce because I wanted to make sure the pasta got coated. I used low fat sour cream. I mixed all the cheeses together and just layered them in the middle and on top. Turned out great. My mother in law asked for the recipe!

I have made this recipe several times and it is awesome!  I do make one change, I replace the jar spaghetti, ground beef and onion, with the Betty Crocker Spagetti Sauce as follows:  Cook and stir 1 lb ground beef, 1 large onion, and 1 clove garlic until light brown, drain and stir in 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp dried oregano leaves, 3/4 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp dried marjoram leaves, 1 can diced tomatoes undrained, 1 8 oz can tomatoe sauce.  Cover and let simmer 1 hour.  I usually double this recipe and whatever is leftover can be frozen for homemade spagetti later.

This is very tasty and was very popular at a covered dish dinner.  I varied it slightly, using 3/4 c. ricotta cheese and 3/4 c. sour cream instead of sour cream only.  I also used 8 oz. each of the provolone and mozzarella cheeses.  I mixed the ziti and sauce together before layering:  1/2 ziti/sauce mix, provolone cheese, ricotta cheese/sour cream mix, 1/2 mozzarella, remaining ziti/sauce mix, remaining mozzarella, and finally the parmesan cheese.

The sour cream makes this a very moist dish.  I made it without the meat.  Everyone liked it.  I made it in two square pans, one for now and one to freeze for later.  1/2 of the recipe made plenty for 2 adults and 3 small kids

This was a great recipe - the first one I have gotten off of the website. I have made this dish twice now. I would suggest using only half the amount of sour cream as the full amount was a little much for me. It was really delicious!

Oh gosh, I really wanted to give this easy to prepare dish 5 stars but I just can't.  A baked pasta dish (IMO) MUST NOT have too much sauce in order for it to come out really good.  Too much sauce = liquid and too much liquid makes the pasta soggy and drowns it with the sauce flavor.
I like my baked pasta to have that kind of chewy texture that comes from being slightly dried, otherwise you may as well make the good ol' wet spaghetti we all love.  This dish came out something more like you'd expect from Hamburger Helper or canned Beefaroni not that there's anything wrong with that, (as Seinfeld would say ;)) but that's not what I want when I'm looking for "baked" pasta.  If I were to try this again, at the very least I would reduce the sauce to 1 jar and bake it in a bigger pan so it could dry better but I'll probably keep exploring some of the other recipes instead.

A HUGE hit with my 17-year old son.  I used bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef for a little extra flavor.  Like lasagne only not as heavy, and the sour cream adds a nice zing to it.

I made this for my boyfriend last night. He loved it. He's Italian so he knows what he's talking about. He said that was the best baked ziti he ever had. I was a little hesitant about the sour cream but that made all the difference. But I used only one cup instead of one and a half. It was delicious. Try it!

I personally LOVED this...I tried to be sneaky and make the recipe without DH seeing the ingredients but he looked at my monitor and saw SOUR CREAM!!!! He hates sour cream and I can usually sneak it in if he doesn't see the ingredients LOL...funny thing is he can't taste it...I'm starting to think it's a psychological thing LOL!!!!!! Anyway, I think this was VERY easy to make and a hit with my 8 yr old, he ate every bit up! Makes a BIG dish so be sure to scale it down if you have a small family, otherwise you'll be left with a LOT of leftovers, which is also fine because it heats back up well! A deeper pan may help too...there are alot of ingredients in here. Very good stuff....be sure to try this one!

Received mixed reviews when I baked this for my family.  Was well received, overall, but I will add more meat and omit the sour cream next time (perhaps using ricotta cheese instead). The sour cream wasn't 'incorporated' well within the casserole (it was layered), and left a bad taste.

Definitely a 5 recipe card review. Works well with non-fat sour cream and non-fat mozarella. I used "Mom's Best Spaghetti Sauce " with this, minus the meatbalss, and increased the garilc by several cloves. Half of the recipe is enjoyed by my family, and the other half goes into the freezer or to a friend.  Freezes well.  You gotta try this one!

I think this is a great recipe.  I have made it a few times playing around with sour cream vs. ricotta as some reviews have suggested.  This last time I did 1/2 cup ricotta and the rest sour cream and I think that was my most favorite yet.  Straight ricotta just isn't as good as with the sour cream (for my tastes anyway).  I also found that mixing the noodles and sauce is the better way to go too so that you don't get dry patches of noodles throughout the pan.  And as another reviewer suggested - make sure you buy a good quality jar sauce.  That will be the difference between a great meal and a so so meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I am of 100% Italian descent and grew up with my grandmother who cooked nothing but fresh from scratch italian meals.  To be honest, she never really made baked ziti, mostly spaghettis and raviolis, linquine and clams.  However, I had italian aunts who made baked ziti and it was definitely delish.  But I have to say that this recipe by far is the best baked ziti ever, at least to me.  I would have never thought to use sour cream, but it adds a flavor and a consistency that regular baked ziti doesn't have.  I love this recipe and will only make my baked ziti this way from now on.  Bon appetit or as the Italians would say, Mangia!

I've made this a million times and everyone loves it.  I mix the sour cream and the ziti noodles (and I have to admit that I'm a bit heavy-handed with the sour cream so it is definitely not dry!).  I've also started doing half ground beef, half italian sausage.  Add some fresh basil on top and it is just divine.  Seriously, people rave about it and I'm known for this baked ziti.

This is pretty good.  Everyone loved it!  It certainly makes plenty!  The only thing I can comment on is that if you dont like your top layered pasta 'crunchy', then cover the dish with foil during bake time. Thx.

This is fantastic. I make one little change.  I mix just a little bit of sauce and a touch of sour cream into the first layer of noodles.  Just enough to coat everything but not enough to be sloppy. . .it keeps everything moist.  You'll also want to make sure that your layer of provolone has openings to allow the sauce/sour cream to seep through. . you want that yummy mixture to seep in pockets into the noodles.

I have doubled and tripled it for large meals and there are rarely leftovers. I also add in any veggies (onions, peppers, mushrooms) that I have on hand.

Great tasting ziti! A few suggestions - Add some minced garlic or a bit of garlic powder to give it some flavoring. I also used Garlic and Herb Pasta sauce to give it some added flavor. If you like very cheesey dishes, add more cheese, I didn't find this quite as cheesey as I'd like it to be, but still delicious, next time, more cheese! Bake for 30 minutes COVERED! The recipe doesn't tell you that, but cover to retain the moistness of the sauce. Bake for another 10 minutes (watch closely) uncovered to melt cheeses. This makes a VERY LARGE portion, so I recommend halving the recipe if there are 4 or less people you have to feed. I also drained the beef (after browning) before adding spagetti sauce which makes it less runny and retains flavor of pasta sauce. After the beef was done cooking, I mixed in the ziti with the beef and added the sauce that way so everything gets covered. I will definitely try this recipe again, though use half of what is recommended and more cheese! FYI: subsituting ricotta for sour cream will give it a more lasanga flavored taste.

This was absolutely the best baked ziti I have ever eaten.  My husband and 13 year old son loved it.  I usually don't use jar sauce but I used
Barilla's marinara and only used 1 jar.  I love a lot of sauce but the 1 jar was enough.  I cooked
3/4 of the box of ziti rigati.  I read somewhere that the ziti with ridges is better for baked ziti because the cheese is able to stick to it better. Kept to the regular amounts of 1 1/2 cups sour cream, 6 oz. provolone & mozarella.  I definitely had my doubts about the sour cream and provolone combo even after reading all of the reviews.  I was shocked at the wonderful taste.
After baking for 1/2 hour, I put under the broiler for a minute to cook the moz. cheese a little more.  Definitely trying many more times!

I want to give this recipe more than just a measly 5 stars! This has become the most requested dish that I have ever made. I have served this for dinner parties as well as for the immediate family. Always a huge hit and always make extra for those 2nd, even third, helpings. Also, I have lightened this recipe with ground turkey, fat free sour cream, and a low fat mozzarella and parmesan cheese mix. I use the Classico Sausage and Red Pepper jarred pasta sauce. Everyone at the last dinner party we had was floored to learn it was made with fat free and low call ingredients. I served the Ziti with classic Caesar Salad and croutons, Caprese Salad and Garlic Bread.

I do believe this is a grand recipe.  Loved the taste and any combination of spaghetti sauce will work.  Could even through in some sauteed mushrooms and green peppers to spruce it up a bit, but tastes wonderful as is.  My aunt just loves Baked Ziti, and this recipe fits the bill.  Thanks Colleen.

Because I was catering my brothers party, I decided to make this with the addition of ricotta cheese and going meatless. The sour cream gave it a nice tang and the provolone cheese was a welcomed change. I'm not a huge pasta fan, but I did taste and my bro's guests went back for seconds and thirds. I guess that says it all. Thank you Taylor for your advice on this recipe and I'm glad you enjoyed my onion sauce!

I was really nervous about using sour cream but you couldn't even tell it was in there. It melts with the provolone and ends up blending in well. It reminded me of lasagna, but was much easier to prepare. I used sweet Italian sausage and squeezed it out of the casing. Spray your foil with a little bit of Pam to prevent the cheese from sticking to it. I also used a bigger baking dish than called for. I find it hard to believe that this would all fit into a 9x13.

I can see how so many people would like this, WE THOUGHT it was lacking something. I guess we could go through and read every couple thousand of reviews and see how people may have altered this recipe, but I'd rather just find a different one. My husband thought the SOUR CREAM didn't go well in this dish. I liked it ok, I just thought it was missing something that gave it the "WOW-FACTOR". Thank you for a good recipe though; AGAIN, I can understand why it is a good recipe for so many others.

Good, but not "the best".  I think this recipe would have been better with ricotta cheese vs. the sour cream.

This was delicious! It tasted better than any restaurant baked ziti that I've ever ordered. I cut the entire recipe in half using the recipe adjuster. Two things I did differently based on reviews - First, I made sure to put a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the pan before the first layer of ziti. Second, I covered the dish with foil for the first 25 min of baking, then uncovered it for the last 5 min. I used an 8x8 glass pan and all of the ingredients for my half-recipe fit perfectly. I think the provolone and sour cream make this really special, yummy, and gooey. I used Prego 3-Cheese sauce. A keeper!!

I've made this dish countless times. All 3 of my kids LOVE it. My tips are as follows: If you add the cooked  Ziti to the meat/sauce mixture you do not have to grease/butter the baking dish. This recipe makes more than just one 9x13 pan so have another smaller pan for the extra's. Def. cover the dish when baking. Hope this helps!

As written, I'd give 3.5 - 4 stars. I tried it this way and prefer the way I usually make it. Like many others I use Ricotta cheese as well. I have done it with adding an egg to it and without. I add spices to the Ricotta as well. I find it adds a nice creaminess to the dish. I also spend extra time seasoning the spaghetti sauce even though it's jarred. 
I always start the layering with a little sauce on the bottom of the pan before any ziti. To me, it's more important to get a little bit of everything in every serving rather than having a nice looking layered piece (like lasagna). I always end up topping with freshly shredded Parm cheese. Remove foil 5 -8 min before serving to get that nice bubbly browned topping. I reserve a tiny bit of spaghetti sauce for any leftovers in case a little is needed after being in fridge the next day. 
This is a go-to recipe in our house because it's so simple and SO good. Serve with a simple green salad and some good bread and you've got happy full stomaches for everyone!

I have to admit, growing up in an italian family, I'm pretty picky when it comes to italian dishes.  I was quite intrigued because this dish doesn't include ricotta cheese which has always been a staple ingredient for my mom's version.  However, my children aren't huge fans of ricotta.  So I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this turned out!!  My 3 boys and hubby LOVED it!  The sour cream adds a great flavor and creamy texture that equals (and maybe surpasses) the ricotta.  Like many other reviewers, I mixed the pasta in the sauce mixture then stirred in the shredded cheese (I also added more than recipe calls for).  However, I did layer the sliced provolone and sour cream in between the two layers of ziti. Then topped with even MORE shredded cheese!  I will certainly be making this again!!!  Thanks for a great recipe that my whole family can enjoy!

WONDERFUL! All of my guests wanted the recipe! I made a mistake, in that I made it, using a larger, and deeper pan, and made 1 1/2 recipe. Consequenly, it took longer to cook (double the time). Next time, I'll follow the recommendations! Thanks for a great recipe!

THIS WAS SOOOOOO GOOD!  Everytime I make it people ask for the recipe.  I think the best suggestion that anyone has made for this recipe is to mix the pasta into the sour cream instead of layering the sour cream.  The pasta stays so tender and you get a little taste of the sour cream with each bite.  PERFECT!

As a a recent college grad who is slowly learning to cook without Hamburger Helper, I was a little nervous to cook something like this. It turned out so great that I even took a picture of it to send to my mom and sister, my cooking mentors. It was easy to prepare and delicious, and enough so that my roommate and I have lunch and dinner for the next week.

I added Italian seasoning,parsley,a bay leaf, and GARLIC to the sauce and beef/onion mixture, otherwise it wouldn't of had flavor. Also something that is left out is to cover the dish with foil before  you put it in the oven, otherwise the pasta will dry out. You should remove the foil in the last few minutes of cooking to get slight browning of the top layer.

Excellent!!!This is easy to prepare ahead of time when company is coming over.  I made it early for company and we had time to relax by the pool and visit then just baked it in the oven 30 min. before we wanted to eat. Everyone loved it and had seconds!  I used 2 large cloves of garlic and a 9x13 pan.  I will definately be making this again!  Thanks! :)

Fantastic.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories a bit but everything else was as written. My 4 and 5 year olds loved it.

This was the first time I've ever tried doing a baked ziti and it came out perfect! Only thing I did different after reading some reviews was using half the sour cream and adding in ricotta to make the 1.5 cups. I also covered when I baked it too. This is great especially if you have a lot of people over and don't want to spend all day in the kitchen.

Absolutely delicious :)
I did take the more Italian route...I boiled the ziti and tossed it with a 400 g container of ricotta and 1 egg.  I made the sauce the same way except my package of meat was almost 700 g.  I omitted the provolone cheese and added basil.  I sprayed Pam in a baking dish and layered it:
1) onion/ground beef/sauce
2) ziti/ricotta/egg
3) mozza slices
4) parmesan cheese/basil
5) repeat
cover with tinfoil while baking and after 30 minutes remove the tinfoil and put it under the broiler.

I just upsized this to make it for my Junior A hockey team (18-20 year olds).  I made six 9" by 13" by 3" deep tubs of it, and the boys all had 2nds and 3rds.  It is a SUPER recipe.  I took a chance by using a recipe I have never tried and made it for the 25 players on the team and Coaches, an equivelent of 50 people (they can really eat!) and it was a HIT!

Wonderful! I used ground turkey. I seasoned the meat with garlic, oregano, basil, onion and green pepper. I used a 6 cheese shredded cheese and topped in with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. I also mixed everything together, then added the cheese on top and covered the dish to bake. Husband gave it a thumbs up!

I adore this recipe!  Any adjustments are for personal taste, I added some garlic and a pizza-takeout package of red pepper to the sauce while cooking and we couldn't get enough!  NOTE: Do cover it with tented foil while baking (of course), and stir together the sauce and pasta before layering to really get the sauce throughout.  Spreading the sour cream on top of *slices* of provalone made things a little easier, as well. :)   I made this for game night with friends and there have been constant requests for it ever since.  One of the top recipes ever!

MM MM GOOD!!! I used ground turkey, less sour cream, added some ricotta cheese, tossed the pasta in the sauce so it would not dry out and added some Italian spices. I layered it as follows: sauce/pasta, sour cream, cheeses and repeat. Using fresh mozzarella makes a difference as well as good quality organic pasta sauce. People @ the potluck raved!!! Will make again!!! Thanks!

This recipe was great!  I didn't have ziti on hand so I used rigatoni instead.  I think I will follow others' advice and rearrange the layers.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks!

This was wonderful, thanks.  I cut it in half since there are only two of us.  My son loved it.  I love what the sour cream does to the texture. I used low fat sour cream.

A great recipe I like to freeze in batches and enjoy weeks later.  I replaced the sour cream with ricotta (I've tried it both ways, and the ricotta gives it a better flavor).  I eyeball the amount of spag sauce - it usually comes out to 1 1/2 jars.  It's like lasagna...but easier!

This was so amazing.  I made a few changes though, I used a small container of ricotta instead of sour cream, and added parmesan, nutmeg, parsley,salt, and pepper, and one egg.  I tossed that with the cooked pasta, then layered with the sauce, and topped with loads of mozzerella cheese.  OMG scruptious!!!!!

This was a great recipe to 'springboard' with!! Okay, here's my changes:).

*Instead of jars, I used my own homemade version of sauce.  
*Like others suggested,  I did add garlic to the meat/onions.  
*With the sour cream, I mixed in cottage cheese (half/half) and seasoned it with parsley, garlic granules and salt/pepper.  
*Didn't have provolone, so I substituted Swiss!
*Also took the advice of others and put some sauce on top of first layer of noodles BEFORE Provolone(swiss in my case).
*I constructed carefully as it does tend to overload a 9x13 BUT it all went in. **Tip, I used a big cookie pan under it to catch any drips, worked beautifully.**
*I did bake this for almost 40 minutes, and I let it REST,which is important, for about 10 minutes....then cut into 12 squares, AWESOME!! ALL of my kiddos enjoyed this, including my 5 year old picky eater:).  THIS is a keeper!

Thanks!

This was only ok, nothing special!  I served it to a party of six on Sunday. My grandaughter said it was too cheesy ( I silently agreed), my daughter gave it a polite "it's good" and there was no response from others---or second helpings served. I think the reviewers are very generous with their ratings on this dish!

This is the BEST recipe! Easy and couldn't be better. We will be making this one A LOT! My husband said if it was on a menu in a restaurant, he'd never try anything else on the menu. Sauteed the onion and a few cloves of garlic first. Used 1 Prego mushroom sauce and 1 other Prego sauce (had more garlic in it)Also, used rigatoni noodles instead of ziti.

My family loved this!  I couldn't find ziti noodles so I just went with "no-pre boil lasagna noodles" and they worked just fine. Thanks to all those who recommended covering it up with foil, it was nice and moist, bubbly, and no dry noodle to be found.

Three people asked for the recipe!!! I used no boil lasagna noodles (I forgot you had to cook the noodles first I was thinking the ziti was no boil noodles, and was running late) and also used Italian sausage because I did not have ground beef. I actually put the lasagna together and forgot to put the sour cream in and then just put spoonfuls of sour cream in between each layer. I couldn't believe it with everybody giving me such rave reviews! Thank you so much for the recipe it was delicious I will deftly make again!

i love an easy, 'dump' recipe w/out any left-over ingredients. i used 2 cans spagetti sauce dumped in the grounded beef, 1 16-oz sour cream dumped in with 2 bags of 4-italian cheese, layered with 1 box of zitti noodles; and sprinkled w/parmeasean(green jar) cheese.  bake in the large casserole dish.
my picky kids raved and had two helpings!

I've been using AllRecipes.com for years and have never left a review. I've also been making this recipe for a while. Here's the deal: It's awesome! Don't worry so much about the quantities of cheese or the layering instructions. I add garlic, course-ground pepper and Italian seasoning but I don't think that makes or breaks the outcome. I've made it with beef and Italian sausage - both mild and spicy - and I don't believe that makes or breaks it either. As I said, don't get too caught up measuring the cheese - it's delicious with more and it's delicious as is. As far as the layering goes I think it's key to have pasta and sauce on the bottom and pasta and sauce on top - the cheese and sour cream are the filling. I mix the pasta and sauce for the sake of simplicity. That is all. Enjoy

I didn't personally taste this, but the rest of the family did. It was kind of bland according to them unless you hit a spot with lots of cheese.  I used ricotta, added wine to my sauce with lots of italian seasoning and garlic powder. I'll be tweeking it for sure but it's a great base recipe and an easy week night dinner if you prep the sauce ahead. Might add in some italian sausage or something along those lines...MORE CHEESE! :)

Very good, simple recipe.  I had a craving for the baked ziti at a local restaurant, but this was a tight budget week.  I decided to try this out at home.  If I were preparing this dinner for only myself, I'd omit the ground beef.  I included it to suit the taste of the rest of the family.  I don't think I changed a thing.  I used fat free sour cream, which worked very well.  I"ll probably make this again.

This is the ultimate comfort food.  It was so yummy, and just as good, if not better, reheated the next day.

amazing!!! i'm vegetarian, so i made one with beef and i made one without beef…and they both turned out amazing!! super creamy, that sour cream was perfect… i had my doubts thinking that maybe it shouldn't even be in there and i should use a different cheese instead of sour cream… but i did this recipe to the T and it was perfect…next time i will tweak it and see how it turns out…but will definitely not leave our the sour cream… its the perfect thing that brings it together… sooo yummy…and it actually makes a lot, so expect to have leftovers for the next day… its going to be great...

This was a huge success!  My husband, who hates leftovers, couldn't wait to have some leftover ziti the next day.  He and his friend liked it much better than my prior recipe (which uses ricotta).  Also, I only used half of the sour cream, because my husband hates the stuff and happened to walk in as I was putting the second layer together. (I had to hide the carton so he wouldn't know.)  Next time I will use the full amount.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  I've been making it for years and recently prepared it for my cooking club.  Everyone thought it was fantastic and said it put their ziti recipes to shame.  I just added a little bit of minced garlic and a can of tomatoes to the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This ziti was dissapointing to me.  I omitted the meat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I was leery about the sour cream, but added it anyway...and I wish I hadn't.  It didn't really "mix" and separated instead.  The result was not very appealing visually, and you could definitely taste it.  I would recommend omitting the sour cream or at least using less.  Also, I would add the mozzarella to the top to get a nice brown cheese.  Will not make again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It's quite easy to prepare, and while it's definitely not diet food, it is wonderful.  I ended up using 8oz. instead of 6oz. for both the mozzerella and provolone cheeses.  And I also used the entire 2 jars of sauce.  It's such a tasty dish that it's easy to overeat, but I found that if I have a big salad first and a large glass of water, I can easily limit my serving size to about 1 cup (which is much less than the listed serving size).  Enjoy!

As other reviewers pointed out this was too much for a 9x13 inch casserole, I made the following changes to make it fit & accomodate our preferences (like MORE CHEESE!). Changed ground beef to 3/4 lb and the pasta to 1/2 lb,changed provolone to 6 oz (6 slices to cover the layer),changed mozzarella to 5-6 oz & parmesan to enough to cover the layer. Even though the pasta didn't completely make a layer, it still turned out beautifully. Oh, and I also layered pasta first, sauce, provolone,sour cream,pasta again, sauce, mozzerella, parmesan.This made 2 dinners for me & my husband. If I need to make 8 servings, I will just double the quantities I used and bake it in a lasagna pan.And of course,I covered it completely the entire baking time. We froze our 2nd half and it was as good,or better, the 2nd time around. I will be making this regularly. Can't wait to make it for the rest of the family and guests. Fantastic!

Ok, here's yet another great review for an awesome recipe.  The sauce WILL make or break this recipe- so unless you have a jarred sauce you swear by, I suggest making a homeade sauce.  The sauce I make is not very time consuming at all: 1) Add 3-4 cloves minced garlic when browning beef & onion.  2) Dump in a 32oz can of tomato sauce and 2 chopped tomatoes (fresh or stewed).  3) Add 1-2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1-2 tsp yellow mustard, 1 T sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tsp Tabasco, and salt & pepper to taste.  Just simmer for 15 minutes, and there you have it- great for spaghetti, lasagna, and definitely try it for this awesome ziti recipe!  I cook by taste, so you might want to alter the amounts to your taste- more sugar if too sour, more lemon if you want more tang, etc.

I would give this 6 stars if I could!  I divided the recipe into 2 - 9" pans and froze the extra one!  It wasn't real pretty, but the taste was superb!  Next time I will use light sour cream.

Baked ziti without ricotta, whipped with eggs, is not baked ziti. Tried this, despite reservations. This tasted akin to some sort of tomato-pseudo stroganoff mess. Terrible.

I think this recipe was ok. I made two pans, one with sour cream and the other with some ricotta cheese. The family perfered the one with ricotta cheese, next time I will only make it that way.

Amazing!!  I made this for a true Italian and he loved it and couldn't pick out the sour cream!  Kept asking me about the ricotta!  I added basil and minced garlic to the meat while browning.  This was so easy and so delicious.  Will make this again and would be great for large groups.

Finally a yummy ziti recipe!!  We've tried sooo many.  My husband wanted me to cut out the sour cream entirely next time, but I think I'll just cut it back to 1 cup.  (That didn't stop him from having 3rds.) :-) Thanks for the delicious recipe!!!

Easy, delicious way to make a meal for a crowd.  Followed everybody else's suggestions and it turned out great - like my daughter said - nice and cheesy.  I added garlic and Italian seasoning to the sauce and put in l cup ricotta and only 1/2 cup sour cream.  I baked it in a lasagna pan.

Easy and fast - my 14 month old loved it.  Much better than my version.  May add some ricotta and cut down a little on the sauce next time.  But overall, this was wonderful!  My hubby and I both thought that it tasted like lasagna, like others said.  Thank you!

Okay, add me to the list of people who like this recipe!  I made it three times this weekend - once for my family and twice to take to families in need for my church.  What a great meal!  It tastes like lasagna, but much easier!
I did wonder about the amount of spaghetti sauce though...I didn't use that much at all!  It wouldn't have fit in my pan if I had! (I used two regular size jars of spaghetti sauce, not the large ones).  Two thumbs up for this one!

Would give this 10 stars if I could! Made this yesterday, as my daughter and 2 grandkids were stopping by..In addition to the pound of hamburger, I added a half pound of ground hot Italian sausage, as husband likes it meaty..also added 2 minced garlic cloves while cooking the meat and onion..I let the sauce and meat (used 2 jars of barillo tomato basil sauce) simmer very slow, covered, for about an hour. Cooked the ziti, then added it to a big pot with the meat sauce, and mixed it all together. Put in half the ziti mixture in a 10x14 glass dish, then the provolone slices and sour cream, piped out of a Ziploc baggie, then the other half of the pasta mix, then the mozzarella slices and parm cheese, covered it with foil and baked.. Let me tell you, this was delicious! Never again will I use ricotta. The flavor is out of this world! It makes a huge amount, and we ate all but a small lunch sized serving. Everyone (5 people) left the table stuffed to the gills! This is a keeper, and is good enough to serve company. Try this, and do NOT be tempted to use ricotta as some have suggested..the provolone and sour cream are what give it it's unique flavor, and make it stand out in a sea of ziti recipes. Thanks Colleen!

Please try this recipe with the sour cream in it before bashing it.  It sounded truly nasty when I read it, but following others reviews, I decided to try it, with fantastic results.  Somehow the creamy Provolone and the sour cream blend to make the perfect creaminess.  I don't consider this a change to the recipe, simply because this is what we eat instead of beef -- I used ground venison.  Since that's not a change for me, I guess the only real change I made to the recipe was the order of ingredients.  I put a very thin layer of sauce on bottom of pan and only buttered the edge of the pan.  Then I layered it like I do my mostaccoli, pasta, sauce, cheese, sour cream, pasta, sauce, cheese.  Because the sauce it directly on top of the noodles they don't dry out (and cook the pasta shy of al dente, about 6-7 minutes, because they will cook a little more with the sauce running through it). Excellent!

Loved this dish! So easy and fast! I made it with whole grain spiral noodles that I had in the house. It tasted great. Everyone loved it and had at least seconds. I plan on putting this in my regular line up

This was SO much better than I thought it would turn out. I've usually had ziti with no meat at all, so I figured it'd turn out greasy. Not even! I followed the direction and ingredients with minor tweaks here and there. The results were great! My wife, kids, and I ate this for 3 days straight, including two days of my wife's lunch for work! We are a military family btw, so I think the army is about to have this for an event! So I hope they like pasta!!! lol

Apparently, this was quite good. I put it together for a potluck and left it overnight in the refrigerator. Used rigatoni as I did not have any ziti on hand. Hubby was hoping for leftovers, but there were none!

This was delicious and easy. I had never made baked ziti before so was a bit nervous when making for guests for the first time. I made a double batch and was impressed with how easy it truly was. I did make one minor adjustment per several reviews- instead of the 1 1/2 cups of sour cream, I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup ricotta for each batch. While I'm sure the recipe as stated would have yield excellent results, I know I will continue with the sour cream/ricotta mixture in the future. The ricotta gave a nice taste and texture while the sour cream added a lovely, mild zip. Oh, and I chopped up some garlic and added it to the onion and beef while browning. I covered the dish with aluminum foil and baked for 25 minutes then removed the foil for an additional 10 minutes of baking time. Served with an arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette and garlic bread. Perfection. Best part- I have some leftovers for another meal. Mmmmmm. Thanks for the outstanding recipe.

I have tried this recipe... a little bland for me. Next time I'll kick up the spices in the groundbeef... also, I still like Ricotta cheese and prefer it over sour cream. IMHO. But quick and easy. Will make it again.

Very good!!  I made this and my family just loved it.  The only thing I did different, was mix the sauce with the pasta so every noodle was filled.  Don't like hollow noodles myself.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exact!  This will be a recipe in our home from now on!

This is a definite keeper! I did make 2 changes though. One was I omitted the sour cream because our family does not care for it. The other change was that I added some herbs to the ground beef. We all loved it and I will make it again. Thank you.

The first "most helpful" reviewer drives me batty.  She basically gives you a whole different recipe to try saying it's better than this.  Apples to oranges...  Anyway, after making this, I'm pretty sure I'll never make lasagna again.  This is so easy and DELICIOUS!  The sour cream mixed with the provolone is to die for.  Love this recipe!

There's a reason why this is so highly rated, people! It's delish! I did what others recommended and mixed some of the sauce with the pasta so it didn't dry out at the bottom. I also only used 1 cup of sour cream, because that's all I had, and it worked just fine. Cooked come green bell pepper and mushrooms with my meat and onion mixture. I served this while my parents and in-laws were over for a visit, and everyone loved it!

4-stars for its potential; but as it's written, this is a 3-star recipe at best. First of all, jarred spaghetti sauce - no good!!! Go ahead and find a meat sauce recipe on this site and scale it to roughly the same proportions as this recipe calls for - the sauce will make or break your dish. If you pick a bad Prego brand sauce, you're going to have sub-part ziti. Secondly, sour cream just doesn't feel right in this dish. Substitute ricotta cheese or at least a mixture of sour cream/ricotta. Thirdly, there's no need to introduce butter into this recipe, just put a thin layer of sauce down in the dish first to prevent sticking. Lastly, bake this covered, as many other reviewers have already noted.

CAUTION: THIS WILL CAUSE A FOOD COMA, but it's sooo good! It's actually more like a lasagna then the Baked Ziti that I'm used to at the restaurants. I ended up altering the layers like other comments mentioned: sauce, ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, sauce and then mozzarella. I couldn't find shredded provolone so i ended up using one of the 8oz slice bags from the grocery store and just layered them evenly. Next time I'm also going to use half an onion, a full onion was a little much for us non onion lovers. We covered it while it baked with tin foil, then removed  the foil for the last 5 minutes. I'm going to do about 20 on and 10 off next time, to get a nice golden top for the cheese next time.

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that ricotta cheese can be drying.  The sour cream and provolone were perfect.  My two young adult sons LOVED it.  I did add an additional small (14 oz.) jar of spaghetti sauce at the suggestion of another earlier reviewer and it was a good move.  I also baked covered at the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and that was also a good move.  And I tossed the cooked ziti with the pasta sauce before layering.  Another reviewer great tip.  I will definitely use this recipe again - may never go back to ricotta!!

I read a lot of reviews and finally came up with how I wanted to make this. I did everything pretty much the same except I mixed the sour cream with a pound of ricotta, and some oregano and bread crumbs for personal preference. I also poured the sauce directly on top of the pasta because I wanted the pasta to soak in the flavor of the sauce. Instead of using provologne slices I used mozerella, and the kind that's alread pre sliced. Instead of shredded mozerella I used a whole bag of italian cheese blend because I'm a cheese lover. cover, and enjoy! This recipe makes A LOT . EVERYONE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH! I will def be making this in the future!

Quick and easy, plus it's good too!  Had only enough provolone for first layer so I finished with swiss.  Wasn't sure if it would taste right, but apparently did because husband ate a second serving after I put the leftovers away.

This is a great recipe as written, or for tweaking it to your liking.  I have used ground beef, turkey italian sausage, or half/half, and its great all three ways (though my family prefers it with turkey sausage).  I have made it with whole wheat pasta and white, and it's great both ways (though my family prefers it with whole wheat).  I often make the full recipe then divide it into two 8x8 casseroles and take one to a friend who is sick, just had a baby, or just needs dinner!  An 8x8 is more than enough to feed a family of four with leftovers.  The quality of the sauce you use really makes a difference here; I love to use my homemade marinara, but if I don't have it on hand I like Newman's Own or Emeril's (especially mixed together; try one jar of NO Fire-roasted sauce with one jar of Emeril's Marinara!)  Tonight I am adding a layer of chopped spinach... I just thawed a 10oz package and placed it in the middle, between layers of ziti.  It doesn't need to bake covered if you use enough sauce, and you can layer it just like it states in the recipe.  You'll make it again and again!

This was fantastic and I even forgot the sour cream.  I did mix all of the pasta in with my ground beef and sauce and then layered it with my cheeses and it turned out great.  Like another reviewer said, you must keep this covered so that it doesn't dry out.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.

Great recipe!  I followed LP's suggestion and used ricotta instead of sour cream and it was fantastic.  I took it to a pot luck of about 80 people, so I doubled the recipe and omitted the meat.  The entire thing was gone - delish!!

I thought this was very good. I will definitely make it again. I mixed my sauce directly into the pasta as others suggested. And I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef (my preference). It was a very simple dish to prepare, which is what I really like about it! As a matter of fact, I am preparing it for a dinner I am catering this week because of the ease in preparation.

Wow this recipe turned out great for me, but unfortunately I didn't use every ingredient in this recipe due to not having it on hand. I cooked the ground beef in minced garlic and dried onions with a pat of butter. I didn't have any ziti pasta so I used bowtie and penne (all that I had left over). I sprayed the bottom of a glass pan with cooking spray and added a tiny bit of spaghetti sauce to the bottom (to prevent it from sticking) I didn't use any sour cream, I just layered it with the pasta, meat sauce and slices of provolone on top. I also  grated some fresh parmesean in the middle and on top because I didn't have any mozzerella. I baked it uncovered for 30 mins and it came out wonderful. I may try the recipe exactly next time, either way it's a keeper!

This recipe was good and easy to make.  It's also quite filling!  Like other reviewers, I also had a concern about the sour cream but found that it worked just fine.  Because I have never made baked ziti before, I followed the recipe pretty closely and only added oregano and garlic powder.  The next time I make it, I will do more of what I do with my standard meat sauce:  garlic, onion, red wine, and oregano.  A little bit of extra effort will yield an even yummier meal!

My wife loves baked Ziti and always compares it to one she had at a restaurant in Brampton Ontario.  She has declared this one better than the one at the restaurant.  I did make a few changes, some mentioned in other comments.  I used mild Italian sausage in place of ground beef, a cup of sour cream and a cup and half of ricotta and a full 8oz package of shredded mozzarella.  For the sauce I used two bottles of sauce with Itaian Sausage and peppers.  It does make alot of baked Ziti.  Served with fresh bread and a beautiful Meritage red wine.  A delightful meal.

YUM.  I used rigatoni, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I did not add garlic, like some suggested.  Instead I used one jar of "garlic and onion" tomato sauce, and one jar of "4 cheese" tomato sauce.  SO good.  This is a great meal when you want to feed a lot of people.  I made it for my husband and myself with the idea of just having left overs for a day or two.... Instead I think I might be able to feed the 5,000.

For people, like myself, who don't like ricotta cheese, this recipe is outstanding.  I added some italian sausage, garlic & italian seasoning to the hamburger meet.  Used 2 jars of Muir Glen Organic Garlic Roasted Garlic for the sauce.  I mixed the sour cream with the ziti.  It helps keep the noodles moist.  I learned that trick from the Baked Ziti III recipe reviews on this site.  It's virtually the same recipe as this one.  Served with garlic bread.  I used the garlic butter recipe from this site and it was fabulous as well.  Perfect meal!

Loved IT!!! I added 1 large shredded carrot & 1 small shredded zuchini to the pasta sauce when cooking.  And added 1/2 of defrosted drained frozen spinach to the sour cream.  Everyone went crazy & got their veggies too.

WOW!! Ok I made a couple of changes (cos I couldn't get the right ingredients) I used Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream and grated mozzerella instead of Provolone (cant get Provolone here!)I mixed 6 ozs of the spaghetti sauce into the cooked pasta. I added some garlic and some tuscan mixed herbs to the sauce. Then I mixed the grated Mozz with the creme fraiche and spread this mixture over the first ziti layer. Then I followed the recipe exactly and at the end I put some sliced mozz on the top after the grated parm!! It was a very flavourful dish!!

This was a huge hit at my New Year's Eve party last night. It's delicious exactly as written and that's how I make it for my family to rave reviews. For anyone interested, when I cooked it for the party I used the following quantities. I used 4lbs of ziti, 96oz sauce, 1 pint sour cream, 10 oz provolone, 32 oz mozzerella, and 1 1/2 lbs ground sweet sausage. I layered it in an 11 x 17 pan starting with a smear of sauce on the bottom, 1/2 the ziti, 1/2 of the mozzerella, all of the provolone, dollops of all of the sourcream, all of the meat, and 1/2 of the sauce. Then the rest of the ziti, the rest of the mozzerella, and the rest of the sauce. I made it the night before the party. I cooked it 2 hours, covered with tinfoil and it came out perfect.

This is an excellent recipe - I've made it many times. I've always made it without covering it and have had no problems. Definitely NOT dry! In fact, it's very very saucy. I put a pan underneath in case it leaks while baking. 

the only thing I change is: I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom. No need to mix it all in with the ziti - believe me, it will mix itself. The layer on the bottom just insures that the sauce is touching the ziti on every layer.

There are plenty of ziti recipes out there with ricotta cheese. If you have to have ricotta, then stick to those. This is a different recipe. I actually like it better. I think the ricotta makes it more like the usual lasagna.

This recipe freezes and reheats very well. I think it needs a little more kick though. I added lots of garlic to the sauce and made a parmesan cheese and seasoned bread crumb mixture to put on the top. The bread crumbs add a great crunch and extra flavor.

We tried this for the first time and it was very good. Based on recommendations I changed the layers with the sauce directly on top of the ziti. I'm glad I took the advice. I found the sauce you use really can make or break the dish. I used one with Italian sausage and will not do again next time. Another review suggested basil flavored so maybe will try that. I also found it to be too much sauce so will add more meat to compensate. In addition, I'm a big cheese person so I will add more provolone and mozzerela next time too. As others have said, the first time around gets four stars- leftovers get five... and unless you're serving a large group you will have lots!

Perfection. I followed the recipe to the letter, did not change one thing and it came out delicious. I used Ragu Chunky Garden sauce and will continue to do so.

Quite good. I used a pound of spicy italian sausage and a half pound seasoned ground beef instead of just the ground beef. I didn't have enough sauce to layer properly so I suggest using 2 jars of the sauce or at least a jar and a  half. Because of this I ended up mixing the whole mess together,saving a cup of the cheese aside, covering and baking for 30 minutes. (covering ensures the pasta doesn't get that terrible "hard edges" curse) After 30  min I tossed the last of the mozzerella/parm on top, removed foil and baked just until cheese melted. (about 5 min) 
This was a delicious dish even without following the layer plan!

This was excellent!!!  Fixed it for dinner this evening.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit!!  I wondered how the sour cream would taste, but actually didn't realize there was even sour cream in it.  Everyone raved about it.  Definately a keeper!  Quick and easy!

I really liked how this recipe turned out. When browning the meat, I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, then only added 1 1/2 jars of sauce. (I mixed the remaining 1/2 jar sauce with my cooked noodles, just to make sure they didn't stick.) When it came time to fill my dish, I sprayed it with Pam but also put a couple spoons of the meat mix down before the noodles. I was kind of leary about the sour cream layer - after it was baked it sort of looked grainy (?) like ricotta - but it tasted good and my 2 kids AND my hubby loved it so I guess that's all that really matters! A little tweaking with the seasonings and it will be perfect.
PS - this really does make a lot. With 2 adults/ 2 kids, we still have 2/3 of the pan leftover!!

This was delicious, even with the meat ommitted.  I did make a half sour cream/half ricotta mixture (rather than all sour cream), added two cloves of garlic, and added some italian seasoning with red pepper flakes to the spaghetti sauce.  The sour cream really is what makes this baked ziti special.  I'll be cooking this again and again!

This turned out excellent, with some changes I made based on recommendations from thequalitycookdotcom, Tay and Mandy! I used sausage instead of the ground beef, and combined 1 cup of sour cream with 1 cup of ricotta with some parsley and rosemary mixed in. I then mixed that with the ziti instead of layering it.  This was really a great meal, and I'm sure I'll be making it again, thanks.

I make this with homemade spaghetti sauce.  This is a great dish to double and freeze one for later.  For the one I'm going to freeze, I just lightly cook the pasta, omit the sour cream, and put extra spaghetti sauce with a little water to thin it out.  It makes an easy and delicious meal for later.

Absolutely delicious!  I make this recipe all the time for my friends after they have babies, and they all want the recipe now.  It's quick, easy, and the sour cream adds such an amazing flavor and texture.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have ziti so I used rotelle. Froze before serving. I also halved the recipe because there are only two of us, and I still had leftovers. Not complaining though! Easy to make and tastes great!
I have made this numerous times and it really lends itself to change. I have taken out the meat and used spinach and artichokes.

What this recipe is lacking is true Italian taste. Add basil,oregano,grated garlic, fennel(seeds or ground)all added to the meat of choice as it is being browned in olive oil. To the tomato sauce (homemade or bought) add some chicken broth.  Add above to one's own individual taste. A little red wine wouldn't hurt. Also use 3 cheese (jalapeno, cheddar, mozzarella) for the topping.  It melts nicely and if put under the broiler for about a minute crisps beautifully.

I halved the recipe to 4 servings, but still baked it in a 9x13 pan and that was just right for quantity.  Used the sour cream, despite fears, but it was good; also, think it helped keep it moist.  Used half hamburger & half sausage; increased the amount of meat slightly for the meatlover in the family.  Used Paul Newman's marinara sauce.  Oh yeah, added a little chianti wine into the sauce!  Skipped the provolone and made it up in mozzarella.  Baked it covered.  For what it is, it's good; just an Italian-style casserole.

WOW!  Really outstanding.  My first thought was "Ziti with sour cream???" followed by "Ziti without ricotta???"  Well, I'm glad I followed this recipe since it was the best ziti I've ever had.  My husband can't stop raving about it!  A few notes:  I used 2 9x9 pans (1 to eat today, 1 to freeze).  I had lots of unused ziti as I was assembling...probably only needed to cook 3/4 of the box.  I don't know if my pans weren't deep enough, but I just couldn't fit any more ziti in.  I did use all the sauce, though, and it didn't seem overly saucy.  I liked the sauce to ziti ratio using less ziti.  Also, I used 8 oz of mozzerella and provolone, since that was the size of the packages I bought.  You can never have too much cheese!  Thanks, yummy, yummy recipe!

My family loves this recipe! To make the recipe fit our new healthier eating, I substituted ground buffalo for hamburger and Healthy Harvest whole wheat penne noodles for regular noodles, used one jar of sauce with one can of diced tomatoes, used FF sour cream, and cut the cheese in half. I added minced garlic to the meat as I was browning it. Did not think to cover it with foil while baking, but will definitely give that a try. I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

Just Yummy !!I used Bertolli spaghetti sauce(Basil & Tomato) only thing I did differently was add some minced garlic.
We love garlic!! Quick fix for lasagne cravings without all the work. Pan gets a bit full and boils over so I luckily had put mine on a cookie sheet. Also if you cover with foil...it won't dry out as others have mentoned. Hubby loved it and so did I ! Thanks Colleen for a easy and tasty recipe.

Great weeknight Italian dinner for the busy cook!  I added in some button mushrooms and dried basil.  It made a lot, and I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!  I served it with some garlic parmesan biscuits...it was delish!

LOVE THIS DISH!!!

Few changes I made, especially based on what people wrote before.  1.  I covered it for 40 mins w. foil and then 10 w.out.  Also added the covered cookie pan on tray below dish, and happy I did.  2. Instead of shredded moz. cheese, I just took a square and sliced peices and layered with them.  my mom use to do this for our lasagna and its delicious...cheesier.  3.  Added garlic salt to the sauce.  4.  Instead of just 2 T of parm on top, I just shook and shook until there was LOTS.  We love cheese, so the more the merrier.  

This was just an awesome recipe... LOOOOVED it and passed it on to a friend.  Makes plenty, and I will be having it for lunch/dinner today, and he will have for lunch, and we still are freezing 5 peices!  :)  GREAT dish!

This was a great, quick, and easy dish.  My husband and 11 month old son loved it and asked for seconds.  Will make again for son's 1st birthday party.  Added a bit more cheese for the cheese lovers in my family, 8 oz. of mozzarella and 8 oz. of provolone.   Also used two different flavors of spaghetti sauce for a better taste.  I do agree with others by saying that you need a bigger baking dish, but if you don't have one, like me, just put a cookie sheet under the baking dish to prevent any spills.

Makes a large lasagna pan - so be prepared.  I substitued the sour cream for ricotta cheese.  It was delicious. I served it with a side of garlic bread and a salad.  Much better tasting the next day. Mmm...

This was absolutely wonderful!!!!!
I was a little skeptical about the sour cream instead of ricotta but I wouldn't change any of the ingredients in this recipe.  My only changes to this dish were that I lined the pan with sauce before I put in the ziti and I used 8 0z of mozzarella instead of 6.  It was wonderful.  Skip the salad and save room for the main course!!!!

I own and direct a summer camp for girls, ages 7 -14 and am always looking for kid-friendly recipes.  I came across this recipe and scaled it to feed 250 (the number of campers and staff we feed at each meal).  My Head Cook opted to leave out the meat (given that 15% of our camp population are vegetarians)and onions but otherwise followed the recipe.  Baked Zita has now become one of the most popular dishes at camp!!

Excellent dish, although I did make a few changes.
Used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and italian sausage for ground beef. This is a keeper.

This is what my Italian Mom would call 'Mock Lasagne'  This recipe was fabulous!...I did add fresh garlic and would recommend using homemade sauce.  I also took a tip from another reviewer and substituted 1/2 c. of sour cream and 1/2 c. of ricotta cheese for the 1 1/2 c. of sour cream.  My husband loved this.  It is great for a crowd since it makes a lot and it is very rich and filling. Great recipe!

I have actually been looking for a recipe using sour cream instead of ricotta.  My husband loves his aunts baked ziti who uses the sour cream.  But hers didn't even compare to hers. We found a new recipe and I will be the one making ziti for his family.

This was the best recipe I've ever made. My fiancee is very picky and he ate over half of it. I used ground turkey and fat free sour creme to reduce the calorie intake. I also didnt have ziti but I used rigatoni and it came out DELICIOUS!

My husband & I really enjoyed this!  I did make some changes though.  I didn't have anyt ziti, so I used rigatoni, I then used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  To reduce calories, I used light sour cream, and only used half of the provolone cheese.  I then added fresh sliced mushrooms.  I recommend this to anyone, this is a quick & easy dinner.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My husband loves this recipe.  I have made it several times and each time he raves about it.  My Mom and neighbors have also raved about the leftovers I have given to them.  I didn't have provolone cheese on hand one time so I substituted shredded cheddar and it was good too.

This dish was absolutely delicious! It was very simple to make, and the three 24 year old boys that I made it for all raved about it! I will be making this again, and I'm passing out the recipe to my friends. The serving size was huge, and although I was concerned about the sour cream addition tasting funny, it was delicious.

This was good- not wonderful. I made  my own sauce and think I could have added alot more spice. It needs a sauce with alot of flavor or comes out tasting bland because of the sour cream and provolone. Will give it another try with more herbs.

Wonderful!  Thought this was one of the best Italian dishes I've ever tried.  The sour cream was a nice change of pace from the usual ricotta cheese.  I would say the prep time of 20 mins. for this dish is a little unrealistic and it makes a lot of food so either cut the recipe in 1/2 or plan to make it for a larger crowd.  I'm looking forward to making it with Italian sausage the next time.  Thanks for a great recipe, Colleen!

Baked Ziti YUM!.  Baked Ziti with sour cream  NOT SO YUM.  the sour cream adds an unnecesary cream. (esp for people watching their weight) It leaves a bad after-taste. And gives the baked ziti kind of a wierd filmy consistency. However, this recipe works WITH OUT adding the sour cream.  So cookers leave it out!

I made this for my boyfriend's BBQ housewarming party. We had 2 vegetarians there so I made this without the meat and onion for them. They both loved it as well as the non-vegetartians. Even the one year old couldn't get enough of it. I did however add to it. I used classico tomato and basil sauce adding garlic and fresh basil--and about a tablespoon of sugar--it was a little tart-as my future mother-in-law said. But with all of the changes I made--it ended up being one of the best things about the BBQ-a large platter of it was completely gone--will make again for other get togethers!! Thanks!

OK!!! Add me to the list, this is a fabulous recipe!  Everyone really liked it.  I may never make lasagna again! Next time I'm going to mix ground beef and Italian sausage.  Be sure to try this one, it's a definite keeper!!!

This is a great recipe! Everyone in my family loved it, even my picky 7 year old went for seconds. The only thing that I would suggest is using a 9x13 size dish instead of 8x12, it makes so much that it doesn't fit in 8x12 very good.

Really good!  The recipe makes more than I need at one time, so I divide the recipe between two  1 1/2 qt casserole dishes.  Freezes well!  Good choice for casual company!

I realize I'm suppose to rate this without making changes. But I actually followed the recipe the first time and it still would get 5 stars. I do like a richer flavor so the second time I chopped and sauteed 1 stalk celery, 1/4 large green bell pepper along with my onion and finished it off with 2 cloves minced garlic. I also put parsley in with the sour cream. Delish.

This dish is amazing!!! The only changes I made are instead of Provolone cheese I subbed Ricotta. I made my own spaghetti sauce instead of using a jar and I added garlic, oregano, basil, salt and pepper to my sauce.... I love the Italian spices and thought the dish needed some more "zing"!

I made this for my Granddaughters Baptism. Everyone loved it! I used vodka sauce instead. Also, remember to cover with foil while baking.  Made this and slipped it into a crock pot to stay warm with the rest of my after Baptism buffet. Easy and very tasty

This is the first dish the came home nearly empty from our Church Potluck!! I skipped provolone and doubled the mozzarella, added 1 tsp basil, oregano, parsley, Italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp S&P to the meat and sauce. Definitely cover while cooking, I tent my foil to protect cheese on top. The sour cream worked just fine, and I'm usually a stickler for ricotta cheese. Tasted just like lasagna!!

This is a GREAT baked ziti recipe (and I'm Italian-don't mind at all if it has sour cream-what counts is it tastes great). -----------------



Modified to easy-to-buy supermarket items: ------

3 jars (24 oz or similar) tomato sauce (Good Brand like Rao's or Victoria, Marinara Style) ------


8 oz sliced Provolone cheese, NOT SMOKED  (packaged) ------


1 pint Whole milk Sour Cream ------


8 oz Shredded Whole Milk Mozzarella (packaged) ------


13x9x3 Aluminum Pan ------



Leave out Beef and Onion for Veggie Version
Add 1 jar of sauce on the bottom of greased pan to start, then follow recipe instructions.

Have it home, or better yet, bring it to friends - they'll think you're an incredible gourmet Italian chef.-------------------------P.S. ----needless to say, but use DeCecco Ziti

Excellent! Great taste and texture and bakes up to perfection! The family gobbled this right up. The only thing I found is the recipe as written is way too much for a 9x13 baking dish, but that is easily remedied by using 2 baking dishes. Well worth the effort--especially considering the amount it makes! Will definitely make this again!

Everyone in my family loves when I make this. I was worried about using sour cream I thought it was odd and was going to use ricotta instead.  But I LOVE IT with the sour cream and wouldn't change it.  I also use more then it calls for with the sour cream and cheese.  It cant hurt it :)

My 18 yr old daughter & I made this for a Christmas party she was hosting.  We made 2 trays one for her party & one I brought to my sisters. It was a huge hit at both venues. The sour cream keeps it moist & the provolone blends nicely & gives it a great flavor. For those new to cooking, do cover it while it's baking to prevent drying.
This is my new favorite Baked Ziti recipe!

This recipe was excellent! I loved all the cheese, and appreciated the review left by another member that suggested using two baking dishes, which I did as well. It makes a lot of food! I covered my dish and was so pleased when I pulled off the aluminum foil, and the dish looked so creamy and cheesy. Thanks All Recipes!

I made this and it was deluctable! I added:
-red wine (a good Pinot Noir) & fresh pressed garlic to my sauce while it simmered
-basil sprinkled on top with the cheeses
-I used a three cheese spaghetti sauce mixed with a basil spaghetti sauce.

*I also covered my dish with foil while I baked it because some people said that theres had dried.

So delicious! It was the first time I made a baked pasta and I can't wait to try some others!

I did not change anything and it was great! I sprayed a glass baking dish with Pam and had no problems.  I layered exactly how the recipe says. Used "tomato, onion, and garlic" flavored sauce.  it was GREAT.

Every once in a while I cook up a big pot of sauce and freeze it in portions for whatever recipe I choose, so as far as the sauce goes, it was my own.. However, I was compelled to write a good review for this recipe because of one thing: Sour Cream.  I don't like ricotta cheese in my ziti or lasagne, and it never occurred to me that sour cream would work.. but it did, and my ziti was the best I have ever had!  I most definitely recommend the combination of flavors in this recipe.  I uploaded a pic but we had already munched on the ziti.  We couldn't wait! ha!

The sour cream and provolone create the perfect balance of creamy and cheesy, and the subtle tang from the sour cream lends another tasty note to this dish. Also, make sure to simmer the sauce according to the directions, which reduces the amount of liquid. I did not once, out of laziness, and there was too much liquid which resulted in slightly soggy pasty. I do replace the ground beef with Italian sausage so I don't have to worry about seasoning the meat myself. This fits perfectly into my 9x13 corningware casserole dish.

Good recipe! However, I made a few changes to make it GREAT. First, I used a whole package (about 13 oz) of provolone cheese rather than 6 ounces. Then, added about 4 ounces of mozzarella cheese (totaling 10 ounces) which is about 2/3 of a regular package. For the parmesan cheese, I used shredded not grated and then I used about enough to cover the whole pan significantly which is about 6 ounces. This sounds like a lot of cheese, but promise it is SO good. I also only used half an onion but that's a personal preference because I'm not a big fan of onions, I just wanted to add flavor. Lastly, to help with the whole drying out issue, baking it uncovered makes it dry out, but baking it covered makes it soggy, so I added the pasta first and added 1/4 the meat sauce then tossed them around together so they were mixed. Then I added provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/4 meat sauce, remaining ziti and 1/4 meat sauce and did the same thing, tossed them around. Then add mozzarella and remaining sauce. Top with parmesan cheese. This will really help your recipe!

Fantastic! Used the ricotta/egg mix, one jar of tomato sauce, one 15 oz.can of stewed tomatoes and one small can of tomato paste for the sauce. Used minced garlic from a jar. Whatever lasagna sauce you make would work here. Next time I'll use a deep dish lasagna pan as it barely fit in my 9x13 pan and I'll use twice as much mozzarella cheese. It's a good idea to spray the aluminum foil with cooking spray before putting it in the oven so it won't stick when you uncover it. Also make sure you under cook the ziti tubes to al dente so they won't be soggy when you take them out of the oven.They will finish cooking in there. Going to try the sausage suggestion next time or a combination of beef/sausage sounds good too.

Yummy, yummy recipe! I combined sour cream with 8oz. cream cheese, 1/4 c parm cheese, a sprinkle of Italian seasoning, and an egg for my version of a ricotta-type filling. I also used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of provolone. Not sure how traditional mine turned out but it was delicious!! Thanks for

This is delicious as written. For the reviewer who suggested ricotta instead of sour cream ... did you try the sour cream version first??? It's amazing. I did however mix some of the sauce with the pasta before layering. This is now a family favorite!

This recipe was FANTASTIC!!! I used my homemade ( long cook from scratch) pasta sauce and didn't have any straight provolone cheese in my fridge, so I substituted ricotta for provolone. And everyone raved about the delicious mix of favors bouncing around in their mouths. Definitely will make this one again and again. The sour cream addition perfected the dish! Another thing to note, leftovers were fantastic as the flavors blended even better as the dish sat  in the refrigerator......:):)

This is so foolproof even if you cook the meat and onion and just mix everything together (like I did because I started layering it in a pan that was too SMALL so I had to just dump it all into a larger pan and mix it around)-It still tasted good! Just top with more cheese COVER and bake! I like more Mozzarella than this calls for I used at least 8 oz. or 1 cup. If you dont have provolone use more mozzarella.

WOW! This was a hit!!  And it made a TON~ quantity AND quality!  
I omitted the beef.  I used 2 jars of Classico sauce with spinach, and jazzed it up a bit (so it wouldn't taste like it came from a jar) I added garlic, onion, sugar, italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and a can of diced tomatoes~ YUM!!  I used penne instead of ziti, also.  I layered in this order: a little sauce, 1/2 of the noodles, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, provolone slices, sour cream (a MUST!), other 1/2 of noodles, remaining sauce, mozzarella and parmesan.  I sprayed the dish with cooking spray first, and also sprayed the aluminum foil, so the cheese woudn't stick.  I used a dish a little bigger and deeper than a 9x13, and it was perfect!  I wish there was more left over! :~D

I browsed awhile for a Baked Ziti recipe. I am so glad I used this one. It was easy, and came out awesome, as good as, if not better (and much easier) than Baked Lasagna. I read some reviews and have to say wholeheartedly - Don't change a thing!!! Make it just as is and you won't be sorry. Loved, loved, loved the recipe! Beware - makes enough for a HUGE family or dinner guests.

Love this. Have made it a few times and was very skeptical about the sour cream the first time because I am a ricotta girl. The sour cream makes the dish. I only use 1 cup now (just a preference) and also put the sauce directly on the bottom layer of pasta. I also season the meat while browning. Cover with foil until the last 10 mins. Have also used bow ties and penne. So good.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I changed the original recipe.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find Ziti pasta at the store, so I chose Rigatoni instead. They worked just fine.
I couldn't find provolone either, so I used Havarti.
I treated the sour cream just like I would have in lasagna. I added half a teaspoon of super fine minced garlic, and dry parsley. This added a great flavor to the ziti rather than just a creaminess to the sauce.
I lined the pan with parchment paper so I didn't have to worry about adding any extra fat to the recipe.
I started with a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan, then spooned on a single layer of noodles. I topped the noodles with sauce, then the sour cream mixture, Havarti cheese, and mozzarella cheese. I did another layer of sauce, then a single layer of noodles, mozzarella cheese, and the last bit of the sauce. I topped the sauce with even more mozzarella cheese. I baked the lasagna covered with aluminum foil and took the foil off at the end of 30 minutes, and broiled it until it was golden brown on top.
My husband and kids don't normally go for this sort of dish, but last night they all finished their dinners. I'll definitely make this again!
*Serve it with garlic toast!

I just made this and it was SOOOO good! I have made as directed before and it's great. This time I omitted the onions (only b/c nursing baby doesn't tolerate them) and it was still great. I also used a whole lb of sweet italian sausage and a half lb of hamburger. I also stirred the sour cream into the pasta rather than layering as recommended by another review.  I really think this is the best baked ziti!  Thanks for the recipe!

Best Ziti that I've ever had!  Cook it covered to keep it moist.  Be sure the onions are cooked all the way through before adding the beef (ours were a little crunchy, even with extra time to get soft before browning the beef).  I accidentally only used one jar of spaghetti sauce, but even still, it was amazing!  I am sure the extra sauce would've made it even better.

Fabulous!!! Adjusted this to 15 servings, using an extra 1/2 pound ground beef just because I wanted to use up the package. Fed 20 people. Personally, I'd make this instead of lasagne anyday. The sour cream is a crucial element in my opinioon. Wonderful recipe!

Absolutely amazing!  I have always hated ricotta cheese so I have steered away from Baked Ziti recipes.  The only thing I did different was to put into two smaller pans and freeze the second one. (Small family.) Has anyone tried using sour cream in lasagna recipes?  Loved it!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I LOVE IT! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don't think it would have been as amazing if I had followed the recipe exactly as it was written. The layering in the recipe is just a little off. I layered mine as follows: half of the ziti, half of the sauce, provolone, sour cream, rest of the ziti, mozzarella, rest of the sauce, Parmesan. That 1st layer of ziti really needs the sauce on top of it. Also, I love onion, but if you're not huge on onion, I would recommend using half of an onion. I added some garlic, salt, and pepper as I was browning the meat as well. For the sauce I used a traditional spaghetti sauce and added my own spices (basil, parsley, fennel seed, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper). I used a 4 quart 10x13 inch pan, and it fit perfectly, so I recommend using a deep pan. Also, make sure you cover the ziti as it cooks to keep it moist. With the changes I made this recipe is fantastic! Definitely a keeper! Can't wait to make this for my boyfriend :)

I made this dish for my 5 best guy friends, and let me tell you - THEY LOVED IT!

I did as the others reviewers said - put the sauce directly on the ziti and covered it with aluminum foil with baking. Here are some other ideas when feeding a large group of hungry males:

1. Add a pound of italian sausage to go with your pound of ground beef.
2. After browning the meat, sauté onions and garlic in with it.
3. Use 8 oz of provolone cheese.
4. Use two cups of sour cream.
5. Use 8 oz mozzarella cheese.

I did the above alterations and it came out fantastically meaty, cheesy, and full of flavor. Great base line recipe, Colleen!

The ingredients itself is definitely five stars, but the directions are definitely 3-4 stars.  It's the holidays so I am going to be generous and round up! :) After reading several pages of reviews I did the following to this recipe:

1. I seasoned my meat with garlic salt, pepper & red pepper flakes before adding the sauce inside.

2. I used a 9 x 13 baking dish, but it was not going to fit.  Unless you have one of those REALLY deep metal pans a regular 9 x 13 is over flowing and over kill really!

3. I layered this recipe a different way since the "cheese barrier" makes the noodles below unsauced, and the "layering" didn't really make sense.  Why wouldn't you just sauce all of the noodles?!  The order was layer of sauce, all the noodles, layer of sauce, doubled up provolone, sour cream, mozarella, parmesean, layer of sauce, a little more mozarella & parmesean to make it pretty and BAM, DONE!

Apologies to those who insist on cooking the recipe as is before rating.  It is hard for someone who cooks a lot to do that!  Five stars for the addition of sour cream and provolone - two things I have never done with baked ziti.

Was delicious!!! I omitted the sour cream, only because I didn't have any. I added sweet italian sausage, turkey pepperoni,  hot banana peppers, chopped green peppers, and used the italian blend cheese. Made homemade garlic read and salad to go with. Quick and easy to whip up!!

Great basic recipe.  We made it with italian sausage, rigatoni and substituted a mix of 2/3 ricotta and 1/3 sour cream after seeing the experience of others.  Definately a keeper.

This is such an AWESOME dish!!!! I changed it up a little. I used 100% whole wheat penne pasta, since I couldn't find whole wheat ziti. Made my own spaghetti sauce (used the "world's best lasagna" meat sauce and this includes italian sausage). Instead of sour cream, I used creme fraiche. Using creme fraiche gives this pasta dish a very delightful, favorful taste!! I covered it in the oven like some reviewers suggested. Shared some with a friend and she loved it. Trust me when I say this tasted SOOOOOOOO good!! You can't be disappointed!!!

Nice change with the sour cream. I made my own sauce though: browned meat with onion and garlic, added some dried herbs, 29 oz. diced tomatoes, 6 oz. tomato paste, 8 oz. tomato sauce. I also toss the pasta and sauce together then layer with the sour cream and cheese instead of layering the sauce, seems to get more sauce over all the pasta.

My husband told me at least 4 times that this was excellent. My kids ate at the neighbors tonight so they didnt get to try it but they will have the left overs tomorrow. I layered like others suggested instead of the following the directions. I liked it a lot but I think that next time I will add extra sauce (personal taste) ohh....I also covered with foil while baking. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed! Just be prepared.....it makes a ton!!

Good pasta dish. I used sausage instead of ground beef. The sour cream is a must, too. I would add some other spice to kick it up next time.

Love it! Making it again tonight....Uncovered just to prove a point.....it was still AWESOME!!!!!  The sour cream is what makes this recipe unique. There are several recipes like this out there with ricotta or cottage cheese, but you will not achieve the flavor and originality of this recipe by using the "regular" cheeses commonly found in recipes like this.

This is the best recipe!  My family loves it.  I usually use Mastacioli instead of Ziti since Ziti seems so thick but I think either way, it is awesome.  This is the only recipe I use now.  the sour cream is what I feel makes the recipe.  Great for leftovers too.

This was wonderful!  I followed the directions and ingredients as listed.  While it was in the oven, I read some of the other reviews and was a bit anxious. However, there was no need for concern! My family loved it and it came out perfect.  We will enjoy the leftovers tomorrow!  Thanks Colleen!

OMG, I am so full, this is so amazing!!  DO NOT replace with ricotta!  The sour cream and provolone give it a unique taste that is so much better!  I used mild Italian sausage, and added some garlic and Italian seasoning to the meat, and I couldn't be happier!!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Like others I changed how I layered.  Next time I'll add some basil and oregano in with the sour cream.  Sour cream is key to this recipe.

This is a very easy meal to make and I love the flexibility of this recipe.  You can change it to your taste and it will still turn out wonderfully.   I used turkey sausage and instead of the provolone, I just bought a 8oz bag of Italian cheese and layered the cheese.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and covered the noodles in the sour cream before layering, which i think was a good idea.  Also, instead of using sauce from a jar, I used the sauce recipe from Linda's Lasagna which my husband has RAVED about.   The next time I make this, I might use whole wheat noodles and ground turkey.

This is really yummy and totally inexpensive.  I make it a little different.  I use Jimmy Dean Italian HOT pork sausage (the type that comes in a tube like form of 1lb of pork, typically only $3). And I also skip the provolone and just use more mozzarella, but everything else is the same.   It's less than $10 for everything and it makes huge baked ziti. We put it in tubberware and just freeze and reheat.

This recipe is SO easy and SO yummy! I put it together in the last minute and omitted the provolone and ground beef, doubled up on the mozzarella, and it came out DELICIOUS! I'm glad I read the previous review and covered it. It was so creamy. Can't wait to try it again with the beef...mmm!

Do not be afraid of the sour cream. It makes the sauce creamy!  Love all the cheese. We omitted the meat(saving money) Still very good. I baked with foil covering and turned the heat up the last 5 mins to brown the cheese. All of our kids cleaned their plates NO COMPLAINING!

I'm from St. Louis, where provel cheese is king, and replacing the provolone for provel will produce a gooier and more melty-cheese texture and flavor.  The sour cream could be upped if you like your pasta more creamy.  I personally like my pasta with plenty of sauce, so I added more red sauce, otherwise it seemed a bit dry.  
Overall, a great pasta that has a super-tasting white-red flavor.

ok...this is not what i'd call a "fast" dinner for a weeknight...i'm sure this is not traditional...and i have eaten better similar food in my life...BUT when considering a balance between all of those factors (and throwing in affordability) this recipe gets 5 stars as written all the way.  husband gave it 5 with no disclaimers.  love the sour cream...ricotta gags me b/c (even though it is actually good) it grosses me out due to the pasty texture upon preparation.  the only change i made was to add a small container of shrooms chopped pretty finely so DH wouldn't notice.  they needed to be used and i love them in nearly everything.  great recipe.  thanks!  will probably replace mom's mosticioli (sp?) recipe...but don't tell her!!!

Great with a few tweaks. Made homemade sauce, omitted the extra onion.  Layered as follows:  couple scoops sauce in base of pan, 1/2 noodles, 1/2 sauce, sour cream, provelone, little sauce, rest noodles, rest sauce, parmesan, mozzarella.  It's amazing this way; the other way is not as good the cheese acts as a barrier for the sauce, this way the sauce soaks into the noodles and makes it great!

I enjoyed this but my husband did not. If you prefer strictly Italian ziti, this is not for you. The creaminess of the sauce is quite good but takes a traditional ziti into lasagna territory. While we all enjoyed it, this is not for Italian food traditionalists.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I do cover it though to keep it from drying out. Also, the last time I made it I didn't have mozzarella and didn't want to go to the store, so I added a packet of taco seasoning after browning the meat, then used Monterey Jack cheese and it was amazing!

This was a BIG HIT with my grown boys.  I used a small container of both sour cream and ricotta cheese and added chopped spinach, shredded carrots and diced green pepper.  Also, I left out the meat because I have a son who is a vegetarian.  Everyone LOVED this dish.

This was delicious and everyone loved it.  Like others, I’ve never used sour cream in my baked ziti, now I’m not sure I’ll be able to make it any other way!  There wasn’t much of it left over, but it seems to be even better the next day! Thanks for sharing.

I've been making this for over a year now.  I make it exactly as stated (except that I use ground turkey to make it a tad heathier).  It's absolutely delicious!  People always ask me what's in it that makes it different...I always tell them that it's the sour cream!  They can't get over it!!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Colleen!!!

My husband loved this recipe, the only thing I have to add is that you should melt the sour cream just so it spreads evenly, the first time I made it there were chunks of sour cream, which tasted sour creamy, blah.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  My family absolutely loved it.  My 2 teenage daughters came back for seconds.  My husband-who isn't a pasta fan-said it was delicious and my 8-year old, who hates anything resembling a casserole, ate every bite! I did change the layering like others suggested and put the pasta, then the sauce and the cheeses.  To make it easier to spread the sour cream--I put it in a ziplock bag, cut the corner off and piped it on like you would icing and then used a fork to spread it around.  Thanks for sharing--it's a keeper!

Oh, yummmm! Fixed this for a family dinner recently (the guest list included several "rather choosy" nieces). They DEVOURED it! Wouldn't change a thing on this one. I have used a similar recipe that calls for multiple layers, bechamel, lots of pots and pans (all very well if one has bunches of time and energy...) but THIS one was JUST as satisfying and required a significantly lower time investment. Will certainly make this one again.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I only give it four stars because I totally changed the recipe and I don't think the original recipe would have been as good! :-)  I added a bit of cream cheese to the other cheeses, added lots of spices, garlic and sherry to the sauce, used full fat meat and whole wheat pasta.  It was very good!

I made it just as followed.  I thought it tasted great and welcomed the sour cream instread of the usual ricotta.  What I wasn't crazy about was the appearance of the slices of provolone cheese, when the piece of ziti is cut. The melted provolone slices looked gross to me. Next time I'll leave the provolone out.

I decided to try this recipe after my nephew served this to me for dinner. His was very good, so I could not resist trying it myself with the following changes. I used my own pasta sauce, used half ground beef and half spicy italian sausage and added some fresh mushrooms once the meat was cooked and finally added a bit of fennel seed to the sauce for added flavor, which was my nephew's idea. The result was sooooo good. Comfort food at it's best and so easy too. I just love the way the flavor that the sour cream gives this dish. This is a great base recipe that lends itself easily for you to tweak to your personal tastes and make it your own.

this makes a ton. I split mine in two 8x8 pans and freeze one for later. Great recipe if you're cooking for someone else (new moms etc.) because you can make some for yourself and share with no extra prep.

I make this for guests and new moms--almost everyone has asked me for this recipe. Make sure you use a good sauce. I like to use one that is sweeter like Prego or add sugar, garlic and basil to whatever sauce I am using. It is a nice compliment to the tangy sour cream.

Sooo creamy and delicious.  The sour cream added a nice alternative to the ricotta cheese norm.  I used sweet italian sausage for the meat and covered the pan during cooking time but did everything else according to the recipe.

I substitute ricotta for the sour cream and keep the rest as the recipe says.  AMAZING!!  I made two large dishes for a crowd and everyone raved about it.  It's delicious reheated the next day too!  As a tip, I prefer to use Bertolli spaghetti sauce... it seems to have the best flavor.

I made this about eight years ago in college and my roomies loved it.  (Back then, there were far fewer than 3,000 reviews - I'm glad so many people have found it!).  Last night my friends had thirds and fourths!  My suggestions, in order of usefulness IMO: - Cook the meat and onions in two separate skillets.  That way, it'll be easier to fit the sauce, the meat will brown more easily, and when you need to split the sauce up into two parts later you just empty one and then the other. - Simmer for 20-25 minutes so the sauce gets nice and thick.  That way it won't be as watery when it comes out of the oven and you can make nice square pieces. - Wash and dry about seven big basil leaves, roll them together the long way into a cigar, and slice into ribbons - put these on top of the baked ziti squares when you serve. - Stick a big basil leaf on the plate so that it sticks out from under the ziti square, for decorative purposes (and when was the last time you ran out of basil?). - Use ridged pasta (I think the sauce and cheese stick better to the pasta). - Use whole-wheat pasta (why wouldn't you? tastes the same in a recipe like this and much healthier). - Burn the cheese a little!  Tastes awesome. - Add bacon if desired.

Absolutely delicious! Leftovers were great as well.  I typically don't use ground beef in baked pasta dishes, so I recommend Italian or Sweet Italian Sausage instead. I think it adds better flavor and texture than ground beef. Some roasted red bell peppers mixed in would make a nice addition to this.

I did not care for this at all. I thought it would be great as it got rave reviews.Maybe i overcooked  the pasta because all i got was a soggy mess, without a lot of taste.

Yum, yum, yum. This was a hit with everyone including the kids. I was a little concerned about the onions, but since they are cooked along with the meat they blend right in. A little tip that made spreading the sour cream easier. I put a few spoonfuls of the hot pasta sauce in and mixed it together. I was then able to pour and spread the sour cream quite easily. I only had mozz. cheese on hand so that was all I used. This did make a ton and did not fit in my 9x13 pan. I will definitely make this again!!!

I loved this recipe but I did change it up a bit.  I used Classico (Fireroasted Tomato and Garlic) Sauce.  I added red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, pepper and Italian Seasonings when I cooked the Hot Italian Sausage with chopped onion and garlic.  I did mix the Sauce with 1 lb of cooked penne before layering.  I used sliced provolone, mozzarella and 6 Italian Cheese Blend.  I also mixed 1 1/2 cups of sour cream with parsley and about a cup of the Italian cheese blend which made the consistency of the sour cream thicker.  I sprayed my 9 X 13 pyrex dish with pam before layering noodles, provolone, sour cream mixture, noodles, mozzarella and Italian Cheese Blend.  I cooked this about 45 minutes.  It came out really good.  I will make this again.

This was awesome! I made it to the tee, except I only did 1 c sour cream and it turned out so good! There was a lot of cheese- just the way I like it. The provolone made it just right. I will make this one again soon I'm sure.

This stuff is amazing!  The sour cream sounded strange but I never alter the recipe the first time I cook it.  I can't wait to make this again (and neither can my co-workers that I shared it with)   ;-) **Updated: I made this again for a large group of folks and everyone really enjoyed it.  I also add some chopped spinach to the sauce for more nutrition.  My 16 yo is learning to cook and needs simple recipes to get started.  So thank you to the original submitter.**

My family agreed that this recipe was very good. I used the ingredients for the entire recipe but divided it into two baking dishes and froze one. I cooked the frozen one about a month later, and it was just as good as the original. This is also pretty easy to put together.

Awesome, awesome, awesome! I didn't change anything from the main recipe and it turned out great. This dish makes a ton of food... definitely enough for lunch for the next few days. I omitted the meat for dinners on Friday during Lent and it was still wonderful. I also made this for a dinner party of 10 and everyone went back for seconds... and some for thirds! I didn't have any left over after the party! This is a keeper in my house!

This was easy and came out perfectly.  I left out the provolone since I had none on hand (so I just substituted more mozzarella), and I used penne instead of ziti.  This was fantastic.  Try it!

Made this for supper last night and it was a hit. I followed the basic recipe but tried to lighten it up a bit with light sour cream, part skim mozzarella and reduced fat provolone cheese. I also added 2 tsp. of minced garlic and 1# of fresh, sliced mushrooms to the beef and onion mixture as it browned. It was very delicious. Thanks for sharing.

Quick, easy and yummy!  My whole family loved it!  And it was great as left overs too.  In fact the night we had it as left overs my daughter's friend asked if she could stay for dinner because it looked and smelled so good.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe...I will be making this again!

Terrific recipe.  I do think it needs  bake for another 8-10 min.  The middle of the casserole wasn't hot enough.  I used a pound of penne pasta (approx 6 cups).  The sour cream gives the dish a nice tang of flavour.  Will make this again.  Thanks.

This was an excellent dish. I added a full 8 oz. of mozarella (instead of 6 oz. that was called for), and sliced fresh mushrooms while the ground beef was cooking. The spaghetti sauces I used were Prego's Roasted Garlic Parmesan and Ricotta Parmesan, and I think those two flavors melded very well together. I split the recipe into two smaller pans and froze one. My family loved it, and so did I. Thanks for the recipe Colleen!

This was delicious. I believe you can rate a recipe high and still change it - if I wanted to eat other's recipes unchanged I would hire a chef. I added 3 cloves fresh crushed garlic and diced fresh mushrooms, celery, basil and spinach for a veggie boost to the meat sauce. A splash of red wine in the sauce and some parmesan cheese on the top layer of the ziti added complexity and perfection!

So good thank you for this recipe! I never would have tried sour cream and it really added richness and zest. Note: I too layered the "saucy" ingredients together between the cheese and pasta as others have so that the flavors would marry.

This is going in the "pretty  good" pile.  The only thing I did differently was add a little garlic to it while I was browning the ground beef.  Also, when I layered it, I took some other reviewers advice and put down ziti, 1/4 of the sauce, provolone, sour cream, another 1/4 of sauce, more ziti, 1/4 of the sauce, mozzarella, rest of the sauce and then parm.  So good the second day!

I struggled to find a dish that would be good for "giving" (like to new moms, people who just move, ect). After I made this, I knew the search was over. Besides its great taste, it is relatively inexpensive and it can be frozen if needed. Every person I have given it to has asked for the recipe. Add a salad mix and loaf of bread and it is a great gift!

A couple of tips: I add garlic, basil and italian seasoning to the meat mixture. And watch how it says to layer everything. It actually makes a big difference in the texture and how it cooks.  (1/2 ziti, ALL the prov, ALL the sour cream, 1/2 sauce, rest of the ziti, all the moz and rest of the sauce.) 

As a bonus, my one-year-old LOVES this!

This recipe you definitely want to keep. I make it whenever I have more people over and don't have much time to prepare anything. We love garlic so I add it to my meat. My daughter doesn't like meat so sometimes I make it without the hamburger meat and it is just as good. You can also use sausage instead of hamburger meat. People always ask for the recipe when I make it. Thank you Colleen.

I find that a lot of people aren't crazy about ricotta cheese, so I love that this recipe doesn't have it and still tastes wonderful. I have made both a meatless version for myself and the version with meat, and both were very well received. It tastes like it was a lot harder to make than it really was. I don't use quite as much sauce as called for.

The only change I've ever made is to mix some italian sausage in with the beef, but it's just perfect as is.  Has become one of my "signature" dishes.  Always have requests for the recipe.  Love it, love it, love it!(Cait, to make ahead, you can assemble it up to the point of baking, wrap tightly, freeze it, and then defrost it completely before baking it.  Works perfectly.  I have used it several times as a freezer meal for a new mom.)

This is one of our favorite meals at my house.  I love this recipe and it is easy to make.  I have made a couple of (very) minor changes but otherwise it's perfect.  I put a thin layer of spaghetti sauce on the bottom, rather than greasing it and I have never had a problem with it sticking.  I also use a mix shredded provolene and mozzerella from Sargentos.  It's easy and I only have to buy one bag of cheese.  It's a great recipe and everyone I've shared it with loves it too!

I made this for my son's varsity football team - the only two things I did differently was adding a layer of ricotta (a very thin layer) over the sour cream and dash it with parsley; and mixing the cooked pasta with some of the sauce before layering.  

I was skeptical about the sour cream too, but decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  I really liked the taste - and the boys inhaled both pans. My husband is a big fan of baked Ziti, and he said this was one of the best recipes I've made.

This is by far the best ziti recipe ever and so unbelievable easy.  I made it for four and I've made it for 30 (with rave reviews every time).  I didn't change a thing and my husband  is a very picky Italian who requests this one often.

This was a fun new recipe for me, but it does need some work.  I followed some previous reviewers' advice and mixed one whole jar of sauce with the noodles, and the the other jar with the meat.  I used italian sausage for a twist on the usual ground beef (turned out great!), and left the rest of the recipe intact with the exception of the noodles.  I was unable to find ziti in my grocery store, and I used rigatoni instead - probably a mistake as the noodles were too bulky and made it impossible to fit everything into one 9x13 dish.  I had to use an additional 9x9 square dish for the overflow!  I did enjoy the flavors of this dish, and the sour cream actually tasted more like a ricotta so it was not at all a "weird" ingredient for me.  I will be trying this again in the future with more tweaks so that I don't end up with such a large amount.

My middle school culinary class served this to 75 people.  What a hit!  3 weeks later people are still commenting on how good it was.  The only thing I did differently was mix half ricotta with the sour cream.

Wow!  One of the best recipes I've made on this site.  So easy and tasted great.  I halved the recipe, added garlic with the meat and onion saute, mixed the sauce in with the pasta and put all the cheese on top (added ricotta as well).  Covered it for 30 minutes, uncovered for 5 minutes more, and it was ready to eat.  Really great recipe.  Thanks.

Excellent and SOOOOOO easy!!! I am so glad I found this recipe! Whenever I cook beef I always add diced bell pepper and onion and season with garlic powder and Lawry's season salt--it adds so much  flavor. And the second time I cooked this I put a little sauce (about a 1/4 of one jar) on the bottom of the pan before layering the pasta because the impenetrable layer of provalone kind of left the ziti on the bottom naked the first time I cooked this. It wasn't a real problem though since it mixed up nicely and tasted so great. I've cooked this for friends and been asked for the recipe. I've made it three times in one month! It's a definite winner! =)

This was delicious and easy to make. I added some pressed garlic to the onions and seasoned the meat with seasoning salt. Very tasty, and I'll definitely make again.

An instant favorite in our house.  I use Mild Italian Turkey Sausage in place of the ground beef and it is fantastic.

This makes 2 small pans to feed a large family twice, instead of having too many leftovers.  It's delicious just as is, but I incorporate a layer of pepperoni to spice things up a bit.  Good to use for pot lucks or for folks that could use a prepared meal delivered!

When I made this recipe, it was for a large crowd.  The baked ziti was ok it was very bland.  The sour cream was a suprise to people, to me it tasted sort of like cream cheese in the mixture.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't really good either.

It is easy to make, and tastes good, but not exceptional. I may have been expecting more from it because of the reviews. To me, it just was like a less yummy lasagna. The sour cream is less flavorful than ricotta, and there isn't much mozzerella going on in the dish either. It has a good flavor and all, but I only give it three stars because why make this when I could just as easily make a lasagna that tastes better? Had fun making it though, and always happy to try new things. :]

I doubled this recipe, and ended up with a completely filled 9 x 13 pan, and two smaller 1 1/2 quart casseroles as well.  I gave one to a friend, who loved it.  I have rated it five stars NOT because it is the most amazing thing I've ever tasted, but is SURE is GOOD and there is NO WAY that you can mess it up!  I didn't feel like there was any problem at all with the sour cream . . . you really couldn't taste it all that much when it was combined with all the other ingredients.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and re-arranged the layers to allow the sauce to get to the noodles, and also used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage.

This is excellent! I use the inexpensive can (Hunts) sauce and add two small cans of tomato paste to the sauce. I have tried pre-sliced provolone and fresh from deli and found the fresh tastes best. I am always asked to bring this to potlucks. Thanks for a great recipe.

I had to rerate this because, This was so AWESOME!  I thought it was awesome the first time I made it, but the second time I made it was so much better.  This time when I was simmering the sauce I added three cloves of garlic and about 2 TBLS Pampered Chef Italian seasoning.  I took it to work for a coworker's bday and everyone loved it even the "picky" eaters.

I made this for a teen birthday/slumber party.  Being short on time, I used jarred sauce (original Ragu) instead of making it.  When I tasted the Ragu before making the ziti I cringed. I thought I had made a huge mistake but, out of necessity, I forged ahead.  Imagine my surprise when the kids raved and my husband and I liked it as well!  My picky daughter had leftovers for both lunch and dinner yesterday; enough said.

This recipe reminded me of lasagna.  My family of six liked it although there were no requests for seconds.  This means we have enough left over for another night (which is fine with me!).  I mixed the sour cream with half the meat sauce before layering it.  I'm not sure if the sour cream would have been apparent as a separate layer but I didn't want to take the chance as my kids dislike sour cream if they know it is there.  I used a larger casserole dish as suggested by other readers and didn't use a full pound of pasta as that seemed like a bit much.  Overall it was a great recipe that I will be making again.  Paired with caesar salad and a loaf of French bread it is a very satisfying meal.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!  My hubby, who doesn't even like baked ziti too much, loved it.  I made a boo boo and only addded one large bottle of spaghetti sauce, but I made up for it by doubling the mozzarella cheese.  But definitely next time will add the extra sauce the recipe calls for.  The mixture of sour cream and provolone really makes this dish stand out.  And the funny thing is you would never know it had sour cream in it.  Thanks so much!!

Wonderful recipe! My family enjoyed it so much that I'll make it every time. I threw in some meatballs rather then meatsauce but still great. The only problem with this recipe is that it's so good that you tend to eat way too much! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very good, but I'm only giving it 4 stars. I added lots of seasoning (pizza seasoning, and Italian herb seasoning), used a full 8 oz. of mozzarella, and next time I will add a couple more slices of provolone. I also made it with rotini because that's what I had on hand, and it worked perfectly. I layered the sauce mixture directly over the noodles as suggested by others.

This was unbelievable!! I couldn't imagine that something that was so easy could taste this good.  I made it for a baby shower and had to increase the serving size to 20 servings.  I baked it for an hour under foil to accommodate the amount of pasta I was making.  It turned out good and I will scale it down next time to make for my family.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband doesn't quite like tomato sauce dishes and I LOVE them, so I am always trying different recipes on him.  He actually liked this one.  I did follow some other's instructions and layered it a little differently.  I put the sauce over the ziti, then the sour cream over the sauce, then cheese and ziti, sauce and cheese. Cover with foil. I have to admit, the sour cream did make this recipe.

Very good, fills a 9x13 pan and fed 8 with ease. Make sure you use a GOOD sauce like Classico or Barilla. I used about a pound and half of hamburger and added fresh garlic to the meat sauce and used 8oz. of mozzarella. The kids loved it, give it a try.

Excellent!! I woildn't change a thing!! the whole family loved it!! AND! I doubled up the recipe froze the other half for 2 months.... Even better then the 1st batch, the noodles stayed firm & the flavors,.....OH MY GOD! along with a garlic bread recipe found on all recipes, fresh green salad, a btl. of blush wine & tarimisu to finish. It made me chuckle,... The meal was so good, it sounded like my family was making love instead of eating dinner.

This was REALLY great!  I added some rosemary and garlic to the sauce to give it some flavor and everything turned out just great!  I baked it for about 40 minutes with foil over it and then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes.  We reheated it for lunch today and it was maybe even better than last night!  I'm adding this to my recipe box... definitely a keeper!!

Being a rookie cook and non Italian also, I have no idea what ziti pasta looks like and I couldn't find it in the pasta section of the supermarket. I improvised and substituted the pasta that looks like little bow ties. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written. I did, however, put a cookie sheet under the 9 x 11 dish just in case it boiled over. As far as the taste... it was outstanding! This is definately a five star recipe. My wife kept saying how great it tasted! Next time (and there will be a next time) I will find the ziti pasta and see which is best for this dish. It would be hard to beat the little bow ties! I might add that the warmed up leftovers were just as good! It taste a little like lazagna... only better! I would note that this recipe does make a LOT of food.

Delicious!  A lot like lasagna, only without the hassle of lasagna noodles which can be so hard to pull apart.  I put this together in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it and then popped it in the oven about 45 minutes before dinner.  The only change I would make is to put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan before adding the ziti because I thought the bottom layer was a little dry (may be because I refrigerated it).  Also, to anyone who is afraid of the sour cream, don't be!  It thickens as it bakes and become very much like ricotta, with a slightly different flavor.  It's wonderful!

This was excellent!! I used the pre-packaged shredded "Italian Blend" cheese, olive oil cooking spray instead of butter, and added some exta spices to the ground beef. Can't wait to make it again.

What more can I add to the tons of reviews? This recipe made more than would fit in my 9 x 13. I will be prepared next time, there will be a next time. One dish that everyone in the family agreed to put in the recipe box. Yea!

My children are so used to allrecipes dishes that now they rate them at the table: "Go put five stars for this one, Mama!"  The recipe makes a TON so we invited some guests and everybody loved it.  I uesd chicken italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I almost left out the sour cream but I'm glad I didn't because it was really good and didn't shout "SOUR CREAM HERE!" the way it does in, say, stroganoff.

I made this for my family and they loved it. My son won't eat most veggies, but since the sauce I purchased had lots, I managed to sneak them in. We did substitute turkey for beef and used non-fat sour cream. I didn't have any provolone on hand either, but just split the mozzarella between the layers. Some might mind if the provolone is missing, but no one complained at the dinner table.

WOW.  This was really terrific baked ziti.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a bunch of garlic to the meat - yum!  I used one of the brands of sauce made especially for baked pasta - 2 jars worked out perfectly.  Baked covered except for the last 5 minutes, when I put it under the broiler to bubble and brown the cheese.  Went great with a caesar salad and garlic bread; the provolone and sour cream were just right.

I thought this was a good receipe - the combination of the sour cream and the provolone tasted excellent and was very creamy.  I think I will add this concoction to my lasagna from now on.  My only suggestion is to add some spices - garlic and basil.  I do think I will make this again, but will add some chopped fresh tomatoes and plenty of garlic!  Thanks for a good recipe!

Very tasty! I halved the recipe and it still filled a 9x13 dish. Definitely personlize the sauce to give it more flavor too. Highly recommend for an easy dish.

Wow, my Italian grandmother would disown me for saying it, but this baked ziti recipe is the best I've ever made.  I've never been partial to ricotta cheese and get aggravated with the "soupy" consistency typical of baked ziti (and lasagna), but with this recipe, you have neither.  I highly recommend it--my husband and 5 year old loved it, and the neighbors I shared it with said they practically licked the dish clean!

This was wonderful!  It makes a huge panful so it would be wonderful for a covered dish or potluck dinner.  The only I will do different next time is only use 1/2 an onion, but that is just personal preference.  It was just a little too much onion for me, but my husband thought it was fine.

Wow!  This is my favorite recipe off of the site yet.  I made a few revisions which I thought worked well.  I added 1 lb. of spicy italian sausage with 3 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper to the sauce.  I also just used a 16 oz container of sour cream.  I found an 8 oz package of a shredded mozzarella and parmesan cheese blend, which I used instead of adding the 2 cheeses separately.  It was SO easy and tasted SO good.  The sour cream definitely is what makes this recipe unique and tasty.  I served it with garlic bread and red wine and it was definitely a hit.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

WOW! What else can I say about this recipe?  I did not have ziti, so I used mini penne.  The combination of provolone cheese & sour cream is awesome!  My husband and I loved it! Thanks, Colleen for such a superb recipe!

A few months ago, I hosted a bridal shower in my home and everyone who helped with the party had to bring a dish.  I made 2 huge trays of this ziti as my contribution and everyone raved about it!  I had lots of left over food; except for this.  It was the biggest hit.  This is definitely a keeper!

We liked this recipe a lot.  We pretty much stuck to the exact recipe!!  Other than possibly adding a little more meat, I don't see anything else we would want to switch.  It was flavorful and moist!  We will make this again for sure.  Thanks!

This was a HUGE hit!  I accidentally bought fat-free sour cream but it was delicious.  (And I didn't mind a few less calories!)

I've made this several times for my family and it goes over very well. I use one jar of 'regular' sauce and half a jar of 'spicy sauce' (I like Emeril's Red Pepper). It adds some jaz to the whole thing. I tend to make a few less noodles because if I don't it seems like there are a whole lot of noodles and not enough of everything else. I have made this for other families when I take them meals and everyone loves it (my husband is so excited when I tell him I'm cooking for someone else because he knows that we'll get to eat it again)! Overall, an awesome recipe!

Not a keeper.  I thought with so many great reviews this one would be great. I followed the directions to the T, but the taste was not that good.  Frozen Lasagna has a much better taste.  My husband grew up on Italian food and he rated it so-so.  It was a waste of time and money. Sorry.

Wow! My boyfriend says this dish is "the best dish I have ever made." and it is very easy- the sour cream really is the key. Thanks so much!

Awesome!  Awesome!  Awesome!  This ziti recipe is wonderful.  I used sour cream, cottage cheese, shredded medium provolone, and some ricotta.  I also substituted ground turkey for ground beef. I mixed the ingredients, instead of layering.  It was still very delicious :)

I've tried this recipe twice and discovered the third time it's perfect without the sour cream.  I normally love sour cream, but it's much better without it.

This is a great recipe.  I am a vegetarian, so I left the meat (and also the onions) out and the result was excellent.  I tried others' suggestions of putting the sauce directly on top of the pasta and agree this is a good idea.  Next time I think I will also use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta, although it was fine with just the sour cream.  Better the next day.

Delicious! Per the suggestion of some other reviews, I added the sauce directly over the noodles. Also, intead of 3/4 cup sour cream, I used a mixture of half sour cream and half ricotta cheese. This turned out fantastic...my boyfriend said (with a mouth full) "this is soooo good!" Definitely a keeper!! The recipe and the boy :)

Absolutely excellent! My entire family loved it and wanted seconds before the first helping was gone.  I did take others advise about putting the sauce mixture on top of the first layer of pasta before the cheese and it worked out perfectly.  The leftovers heated up very well also.  My family doesn't like onion, so I omitted it from the recipe and it was still delicious.

This is one of my family's all time favorites, and a dish I often make when having company for dinner.  It is quick and easy, and has always gotten compliments.  One reviewer mentioned it not having enough flavor (I think it's great as it is!)--try adding garlic to the beef and onions, and try using half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage.  I always use Clasico tomato and basil and it turns out wonderfully!  Great recipe!

This was the first recipe I tried from this website and my boyfriend loved it!  I added a packet of dry Italian dressing mix and some garlic to the already made pasta sauce.  I also used 2 lbs of ground beef for the meat lovers in my family!  Easy, quick, and tastes great!

This Baked Ziti dish is great! We substituted the ground beef for chopped green peppers and additional onions to make a veggie version.  This is so much easier than a regular lasgana and the layering of sauce and cheese makes it absolutely delicious.

We tried this one and liked it very much.  Our family will make this one again.  The recipe is a little big for a small family (there is enough here to feed a bunch of folks) so you might want to cut it down in size before you make it or just freeze what you don't use.

I was really disappointed in this dish, especially since it had so many wonderful reviews.  The pan size called for in the recipe is way too small and it makes a lot of food.  It was also very bland.

Loved this recipe.  I would definately make this again.  This dish was very easy to make and it was great re-heated. My husband also really liked it and he's not one to comment on food.

I already had a really good recipe for Baked Rigatoni, but when I saw how well received this one was....I just had to try!  WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is very easy, and tastes wonderful!  My youngest daughter had thirds!  It does make plenty, I used a Casserole, and a 9X9 - which I will be having for a luncheon with my girlfriends!
Thanks so much!

This is wonderful!  It made a lot.  My husband was surprised and asked why I made so much.  Then he was glad I did when he tasted it.  My son and nephew loved it too.  I made a few changes.. I used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream and that was a perfect texture, ground turkey instead of sausage, and I added garlic.  Also, I used Classico basil and tomato sauce.  This is a keeper.

I agree with many of the other reviewers that this is a great recipe, but the sour cream was overwhelming.  I made it for company and it didn't look very 'pretty' to serve.  Everyone liked the taste though.

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe.  My very italian husband won't eat any sauce other than his mother's or his own.  I made this recipe (with Classico Tomato & Basil sauce) and he couldn't stop eating it!! He raved.  It filled two 9x9 pyrex dishes so we had lots and one to freeze!

This recipe was excellent!! Next time I'll cut it in half because it's so filling that there was way too much left over.  Loses it's excellence when reheated. Doesn't hold it's shape when removed from the pan but who cares? It tasted great.

This is really a great recipe.  I halved all of the ingredients as I was only cooking for three, and it turned out great.  I have made this without the meat and it turned out great as well.  I highly recommend this.  The leftovers are wonderful as well.

I cooked this last night and it was great!  Everyone had seconds. I added fresh tomatoes, minced garlic, green peppers, and onions to ground beef while browning.  I also added spices- basil, oregano, red pepper.  I didn't have provolone so I used a lot of mozzarella. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice. Once, with the sour cream and second with ricotta cheese. I prefer the ricotta instead of the sour cream. Also, next time I think I'll use sweet Italian sausage instead of beef. My family loved it and is real easy to make. Thanks for sharing!!!

Delicious recipe.  I added a little brown sugar and bread crumbs to the tomato sauce.  The brown sugar gave it a great taste and the bread crumbs thickened up the sauce.  My whole family loved it and had seconds.

This is the absolute best pasta recipe! I'll never
make time consuming lasagna again!!! My daughters and I dislike spaghetti but I try to find something for my spaghetti and lasagna loving husband and sons. Not only is this easy, it tastes better than lasagna, makes alot and we ALL LOVE IT. It was also a hit with my daughter's swim team.

This recipe made a huge, HUGE!, amount of food.  I took it to a church potluck and it was gone within 20 minutes.  Definately use a big pan -- my 9 x 13 was brimming over with food :)  Maybe cook it in two smaller pans?  Thanks for the recipe :)

I knew I had a winner when my husband went back for thirds on this dinner.  I read the reviews and knew it made a lot so i made it in three loaf pans and cooked one for dinner and froze the other two.  One out of the three loaf pans feeds a family of four.  I will definately keep this recipe and it will be great for our family reunions when you need to feed a lot of people.

Tasty, very dense.  This meal sticks to your ribs.  We added 4 cloves of diced garlic to the sauce to perk it up some.  Makes awesome leftovers!

This was my first attempt at cooking from a recipe I was not familiar with and my first recipe from this website. If I can make it, anyone can. I made it without beef and substituted ricotta cheese for sour cream. DELICIOUS, very cheesy, tastes just like Sbarros. My boyfriend thinks I can actually cook now. You may want to use a bigger pan (13 x 9) though. It was overflowing! Wonderful recipe. Anyone will like it.

This recipe is fantastic, with or without the meat.  I have often cooked this for guests and they really enjoy it.  I have been asked for this recipe from friends on several occasions.  I usually add red and green peppers to it for coloring and it is wonderful.

I changed the order of things. I made in the morning and refrigerated until dinner. So I skipped the sauce/ meat heating. I used Raos marinara which is delish right from jar.  Used ground mild italian sausage. Browned in pan with onion. Then pulsed in my food processor until finely ground as I prefer the texture of  finely Ground meat in pasta dishes. Buttered dish. Put a thin layer of “sauce only” onto bottom (right from jar before mixing Sauce with meat). Then half ziti. Then sour cream (scooped into baggy, sealed, then cut very small corner off. Was super easy to cover all of pasta. Did not need to spread). Then shredded provolone. Then marinara meat sauce. Then sprinkled parmesan. then the rest of the pasta. Then the rest of the meat sauce. Then sprinkled parmesan. Then shredded mozz. Then refridgerated. Took out of fridge  1 hour before cooking. Covered with foil and baked about 45 minutes. Took off foil and baked  15 min or until browned on top and bubbly edges. Guests raved and had seconds. Great recipe!.

Used the tip about ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and mixed it with egg and voted the noodles with it. Delicious. What a game changer. Used turkey instead of red meat. That for the tip and Happy Holidays!

Make this all the time exactly as written but mixing ziti with sauce on each layer.  It makes a HUGE amount but the one time I made 1/2 the family was annoyed because they like the leftovers even better.  This is the BEST “team meal” for mom’s like me that have to make a meal for an entire high school sports team the night before a game. You won’t be disappointed!

This baked ziti recipe would have been the reason my husband married me if it weren't already for my spaghetti and meatballs recipe.

Eat this as a comfort food in the dead of winter.  Don't skip out on the fat of anything.  Use it all--the taste is worth it.  If there's extra cheese in the package, throw it in there.  It's baked ziti, for chrissakes.

This baked ziti is what dreams are made of.  It would turn a vegan back into a meat eater.  When I take a bite of it I feel as if I'm covered with a warm fleece blanket.

It's no coincidence that people are still making this specific recipe after more than fifteen years of its online existence.

Okay, the only thing I did that might have been different is that when it came time to layer, I spooned the sour cream into a ziplock bag and snipped off a corner so I could apply the layer in a more easy, uniform way.  it worked well.

This dish was a hit in my family this week. My wife worked late and when she came home the food was ready and she loved it. Our 6 year old who's a very picky eater said it "was good" and even asked for seconds. I've already saved this dish in my favorites to be made again in the near future.

Delicious! Both, my husband and myself loved it. Try baking it covered with tin foil for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10 minutes. Did it and it turned out great, not dried out, as many people have a problem with.

I made this exactly as directed except for I substituted Italian style ground turkey for the ground beef and omitted the sour cream. I paired a nice mixed green salad and some crusty bread to complete the meal.  My husband and I both enjoyed it a lot!  Super nice for us, I froze the numerous left overs which will ease some work week nights.

Good mix of sweet / spicy. Semi-complicated prep is the only reason I rated 4 stars rather than 5. BEWARE - If made according to recipe, if your 9x13 is a little shallow, you'll have a hard time fitting everything in. Just something to watch for.

This recipe was delicious! I seasoned my meat well while browning it with salt, pepper, a dash of Mrs Dash and garlic salt. After adding the spaghetti sauce I mixed in some shredded cheese (Colby & Monterey Jack). I buttered my dish well and per other reviews I mixed the ziti into the sauce. I did a layer of the ziti sauce then the provolone, sour cream, the other half of the ziti sauce, the mozzarella and sprinkled the Parmesan on top. I covered it with foil and baked it for 30 minutes. I took it out and took the foil off then popped it back in the oven under the broiler on low to melt and brown the cheese a bit. I will definitely be making this again. It makes such a big dish it would be great for a family get together.

I just made this & it was excellent. I took comment suggestions and used a little more than 1/2 the sour cream called for but only added a jar & a 1/2 sauce. I also added extra mozzarella on top with the Parmesan. I added fresh chopped parsley & dill (just because I had some ready to go from a prior recipe)as well as 1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning & 2 cloves of garlic to the meat & onions. Everyone in my family was crazy about it & I would totally make it this way again!

Wow, I've seen this recipe for years here on AR but just never tried it.  I did tonight and it was delicious.  I did have to make a couple changes but I'm sure the recipe as written would be delicious as well.  I had penne pasta and only 1 jar of spagetti sauce.  I went ahead with the rest of the recipe, using havarti cheese, mozerella and a jack/colby combo.  No parm.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for posting this Colleen.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Since I wanted to make a smaller quantity (a 9x9 dish instead of a 9x13)  I followed the recipe as written, but used only  8 ounces of pasta and just one jar of spaghetti sauce.  Definitely the best Baked Ziti recipe ever!!

When I first made this recipe I didn't use all the sour cream.  It was dry.  My son who is very picky loved it.  He wanted me to make it again.  So for dinner tonight I have made it just like the recipe called for.  Looks Beautiful!  Taste Awesome!  Remember to cover it so it doesn't dry out.

The first time I made this, I didn't quite pay attention to the amount of sauce and it ended up not saucy enough (according to my husband) and something in the flavor was just missing.

Can't believe I haven't rated this recipe. I've made this half a dozen times now - its so delicious and creamy. My change is to use my own homemade meat sauce and keep everything else the same.

I loved this recipe! I followed this recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did differently was put a little extra mozzarella and provolone because the packages came in 8 oz and I didn't feel like putting a small amount back in the fridge to be forgotten. I also took the advice of others and covered it with foil before baking it. I used rigatoni noodles because the store where I shop didn't have ziti, but they are pretty close and they're just noodles, as for the pasta sauce I bought the Classico brand four cheese and traditional tomato and basil. I am still new to cooking but enjoy trying new recipes, this one was very easy and I would recommend it to beginners. I will state that I have never had baked ziti before, so I can't compare it to other ziti dishes. This dish tasted like lasagna if I were to compare it to anything. I was very happy to see that it wasn't watery, like at all. My very picky boyfriend approved and said its one of the best things I've made.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe and maybe experiment with new ingredients to make it more exciting even though it's plenty yummy the way it's written.

I am a huge fan of the Allrecipes site.  I usually look for recipes that have been well reviewed and after seeing the number of reviews for this recipe, wanted to give it a try.  Overall I would give it three stars.  I am not sure what I expected considering it was using a jar sauce and basically assembling a few ingredients.  It was good, but not great.  Not sure I would make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I don't eat meat so it was meatless, but the sour cream added a nice tang. my husband is Italian and said it wasn't actually the ziti he grew up with but enjoyed the pasta casserole none the less. Thanks!!

Everyone had 3 servings! Really great, but not good for watching your weight! Only thing I added was 5 minutes under the broiler to brown the Parmesan cheese. So yummy! Will make this again and again.

.. When I cook pasta especially in the oven after being boiled particularly ziti, I always toss the boiled ziti with a scoop of sour cream and it helps not to dry out,  it reheats very well in the microwave too, if u have leftovers. do that and it totally takes care of any issues of drying out.

A home run!  Loved this recipe.  The use of sour cream in this recipe is awesome. Who would have thought??? 

Don't make this if you are looking for an authentic Italian dish.  Make it if you are looking for an easy, yummy, tummy warming dish.  I know some "I-am-a-chef" reviewers claim a baked ziti dish must be made with ricotta cheese.  The provolone layer of cheese and the sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, combined with a layer of sour cream, is wonderfully simple and delicious.

Make sure to mix the ziti noodles in a little bit of the sauce and layer the sauce directly on top of the noodles so they don't dry out. And make sure you cover the dish while baking.

For the reviewers who said it was bland, you probably used a cheap sauce. Do you prefer more flavor? Add basil, oregano, Italian spice, or garlic to the meat  or the sauce.  

Final note: this makes great leftovers!

Great recipe. The portions of sauce to cheese to pasta were just right, and the sour cream mimicked ricotta cheese surprisingly well. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef to add a bit of spice. In the future I'll try browning the onions a bit longer than the meat, as they were still a bit crisp even after baking.

I tried this for the first time, yesterday. In fact, first time I ever made Baked Ziti.  Very easy to prepare, and everyone loved, many second and third helpings.  Someone even asked me for the recipe. Will be making this again.

Made this today, and I loved how the cheese was nice and melty!  The only thing that worried me a little was the pan size because I used the deepest one we had but not a 9x13.  It turned out well though, and I had forgotten to add the salt to the water!  It's so easy to make I'd like to do it again before the year's out!  I mixed two types of spaghetti sauce and maybe (but not sure) a little too much sour cream, but it was worth it.  Great recipe!

Delicious &5 stars as written(just 1/2 the recipe and still had leftovers).  Thank you for a fantastic family recipe that can be altered to ones own tastes etc.  Tried it with Italian sausage second time and pretty much throw whatever I have when I make it now.  Really versatile recipe!! Please try this with the sour cream as listed!!!! It provides this unbelievable creaminess to the pasta that ricotta & cottage cheeses don't!!!!  Don't be put off by it---I was at first but I felt the only way to fairly review this was to make it using the recipe--so glad I did!!

As I was saying in other review. Your afforded the luxury of tweaking recipes like this one to meet your or your families palate. As example I used 1/4 c brown sugar as many have suggested and combined with ketchup and Uncle Bobs for a glaze in top. I would mince the onions fine or run quickly thru food processor next time. Onion must be small. I added some garlic. It's a great solid recipe as is and you can change little things to your liking. Keep all the basics the same first time then add as needed

This was DELICIOUS! I fed it to a group of young children and they ALL enjoyed it, some even going back for a 3rd serving! I think I will add more Provolone cheese and mozzerella next time. Also, I covered mine when I cooked it with aluminum foil and it didn't dry out a bit. Don't be afraid if the mixture rises over the top of your pan before you cook it, like mine did, I just put a raised cookie sheet underneath it and it leaked out just a little bit. This also reheats very well in the microwave.

My family loved it. We made it exactly as the recipe except I used a 5 Italian cheese mix with all the cheeses called for plus cream cheese and one more (I don't remember what it was.) Our grocery store didn't have provolone by itself.  We accidentally overcooked it 10 minutes and it was still great. I like my baked ziti without meat and my husband is the exact  opposite.  It was a great middle ground for us. We are a family of 4 and figure we can probably get 12-15 servings out of this huge dish. I spent $18.65 on the ingredients,  so I was irritated with the price before I tasted it or realized the quantity, but getting 3+ family meals out of it makes it worth the price too!

I made this for an Easter dinner and my relatives are extremely picky about their food, but they LOVED this. Words can't even describe how much they've talked about it. Everytime we have a function, I'm asked to bring it.

We just had my aunts 60th bday party and I kept seeing ppl run to the pans to get more. I pretty much make it exactly as the recipe calls unless I'm missing something, but I use ground Italian sausage.  

I will try it ricotta cheese next time bc I just love it in Italian food.

This is an amazing dish.  I followed the advice to mix the sauce with the bottom layer of noodles and cover the dish while baking, and it turned out beautifully.  It is even better the next day, so I cook this a day ahead and heat it up for dinner the next day.  Always goes over really well when I take it for potluck lunches.  Definitely a winner!

Made this recipe last night and it was really yummy.  The only changes I made was that I used sausage instead of ground beef, just a personal preference and I layered differently as others have suggested.  It was very creamy and yummy.

This recipe was really good. It sounded like a lot of sauce, but was not too saucy at all. I halved the recipe and it just fit into my 9 x 9 pan. I also added garlic and spices (salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, thyme) to the meat while it was cooking. I used Classico roasted tomato and garlic sauce, but it would probably be even better with some homemade sauce. This recipe will be added into my comfort food rotation for sure!

OMG! This is divine. I know it's not authentic using ricotta and egg, etc. but I think that's what I love about it. It's so smooth and creamy and less expensive than a full authentic recipe. Also we didn't experience any drying on the top. Only change I made was using Italian sausage instead of hamburger.

This was great I used turkey instead of beef and added mushrooms and garlic... Big hit with the family and the kids will be making again :)

Delicious! I made this recipe last night for dinner and am finishing off the leftovers right now for lunch. I halved the recipe and it filled a 7x11 dish very FULL. I followed other suggestions and layered it as follows - ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream (put SC in a Ziploc baggie and snipped of the corner to apply evenly, then a spatula to spread, made it super easy and pretty), ziti, sauce, mozzarella, parmesan. I browned vineson (deer meat) with 1 whole small onion chopped, can of mushrooms chopped and 2 large cloves of garlic chopped, and seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and more garlic powder. I ended up baking for about 50 minutes, covered, the uncovered for another 7. (Gas stove) I was weary about the sour cream, but so many reviews said go for it! It was delicious, my picky 2 year old cleaned her plate, said she loved it with a huge grin. Sent some home with her dad, he loved it, even when he ate it cold! Sent enough with him for them both to have for lunch today, I doubt anything will be returned but empty Tupperware. Saving this recipe for future use, it is a keeper! I am a huge review reader, but never been one to leave reviews. Your reviews are always so helpful and appreciated, I've been encouraged by you all, and this delicious dish, to become a contributing member to this community. Happy cooking!

Easy to make, comforting and hearty.  The sour cream added a wonderful creamy texture and unique taste that we really enjoyed.  Based on other reviews, I mixed one jar of pasta sauce with the noodles, and the other jar with the meat (I also added fresh diced garlic to the meat while cooking it, as well as Oregano).  I substituted ricotta for half the sour cream, which worked out wonderfully.  I doubled the mozzarella and put it on TOP of the second layer of meat, then dusted with grated parmesan.  Cooked about 20 minutes while covered with foil, and maybe 10-15 more minutes without the foil.  I loved it, as did the other 2 women joining me, and we had a 2 year old child who gobbled up a nice portion as well.  Will definitely make again.

Yum yum!! This is such a go-to dish for guests! Only thing I do differently is that I either use a 4 cheese mix for the cheese and/or mozzarella cheese! It still comes out super yummy!

Good recipe. I made it with chicken instead of ground beef. I tossed bite size pieces of chicken with minced garlic and dried Italian spices. I than cooked the chicken in a little olive oil. Turned out great.

Made this exactly as the recipe says - only covered for 20 minutes during baking and then the last 10 minutes uncovered.  Came out great! Was worried that the sauce wouldn't get to the pasta on the bottom but it came out perfect. My new recipe for baked ziti.

I am just now putting this into my recipe box and writing a review though I have been making this since 2009.  Don't know how it got overlooked because it is one of my very favorite recipes on this site.  I have used different cheeses, spaghetti sauces and layering.  It always turns out delicious and a big hit whenever I serve it.  I have noticed that the flavor changes a little with each type of spaghetti sauce and have now found one (Rao) that is just right!  Sometimes I have even added a can of mild Rotel and some red pepper flakes for added zing. I sometimes even mix the pasta with the sauce before layering and it still turns out great. Thanks so much Colleen B. Smith for this outstanding recipe.

I love this quick and easy ziti recipe. I use homemade Italian sausage instead of ground beef for more flavor. I was unable to fit all of the ingredients into a 9x13 inch baking dish, so placed the remaining in an 8x8 inch baking dish.

This recipe was excellent. It was quick, very easy, and made a great meal served with salad and garlic bread. In the future, however, I will make this in two smaller containers so that i can cook one and freeze the other. Thank you for the recipe.

I always get rave reviews with this recipe!  It's a family favorite. Plus, great make ahead meal/freezer meal/take a meal to a friend in need kind of dish. Put a little of the sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding in the noodles!  I always spray the pan with non-stick spray of some kind to help with clean-up later :)

Not a very traditional version.  I would replace the sour cream with ricotta if you like, or just leave it out.  Also, mix some sauce and parmesan cheese right into the ziti before you begin to layer.  Our family traditional recipe also calls for sauce, shredded mozzarella and mini meat balls in the mid-layer.  But just using a meat sauce is a quick and easy alternative.

I made this tonight, and thought it was  the best ziti I have ever eaten!
It was not dry, as baked ziti so often is... the creamy consistency I attribute to the substitution of sour cream for ricotta.  Since I had bought the ricotta, I added  a few tablespoons with the sour cream, but otherwise used the ingredients as written in the recipe.  I took the advice of one reviewer who mixed the pasta sauce with the pasta before layering, and found it to be wonderful.  Thank you, Colleen, for a wonderful rendition, which I will make often.  Next time I will substitute sausage for the ground beef.  Delicious!

Delish as is! I followed the recipe exactly, except I layered as follows: thin layer (1/4 of sauce) of sauce so I don't have to add oil, ziti lined up in little rows for neatness and even bites, another 1/4 layer of sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, mozzarella, 1/2 sauce, parm. If you want a more traditional cheesy top, you can reserve some of the mozzarella to put on the top sauce layer, but I didn't. I think placing the ziti rather than just dumping it on is key. Forget what the other person said about leaving out the sour cream and provolone and replacing it with ricotta. I liked this recipe because it WASNT like lasagna. I already have a great recipe for that. The sour cream is worth a taste. I used light, and it gave the dish a wonderful and more unique flavor that I loved. My husband and brother liked it too, and they're picky! I decided to make it as is the first time, but I'll probably add some garlic and other spices per the other reviews. That said, give the original recipe a try first! It's extremely easy with few ingredients for what you'll get out of it: a yummy meal! Pair it with garlic bread, especially if you're making it as it. Quick, easy, delicious!

I just made this and I blended a few recipes together to get what I wanted.  I added a pound of Italian sausage to the ground beef and one green pepper, and some minced garlic. I added 1 table spoon sugar to the spaghetti sauce to cut down on the acid of the tomato sauce. I mixed in about a cup of small curd cottage cheese with the sour cream and added an egg to that.  Then I mixed 8oz ricotta cheese with the mozzarella cheese and added an egg to that mix too. The provolone came in an 8oz package so I used all the slices I covered the ziti with foil and baked it for 45 minutes then I uncovered it and added about ¼ cup Parmesan cheese and ½ cup mozzarella to the top and baked it another 15 minutes. Then I let the whole thing rest 20 minutes before serving.

Very easy and tasty. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, which worked really well for a slightly lighter version.

Very good ziti.  The sour cream gave it an interesting but good flavor.  I had to use american cheese because I didn't have provolone and it didn't seem to affect the taste.

This is a great, family friendly recipe.  The only change I ever make sometimes is to use Mild Italian Sausage in place of the ground beef.  Everyone loves it!

Really great dish and I made for a party and my friends thought it was great. Only thing I changed is I used one cup of sour cream instead of 1 1/2 and I added a little more mozzerella and parmesan cheese to the recipe.

It worked for my family!  Like many tomato-based casseroles, I assembled it the night before and let it sit in the fridge over night.  It makes A LOT, we still ate about 1/2 of it - the rest will go tonight!  Thanks for a tasty family meal!

Fantastic!   The family even said this was better than my FiL's (though he was not too happy about it).  I followed other user comments and on the first layer of ziti I mixed the sauce/meat mixture in with the ziti, then I added the cheese and so on.  I also used some garlic and crushed red pepper when I browned the meat and onions.  Finally, cooked covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 5 minutes.  Brilliant recipe and slight modifications worked well.

Halved the recipe to serve 4 people (there were still leftovers) and made it meatless.  Good basic recipe that can easily be altered to suit your family's preferences.  Using a good quality sauce is a must!  I took others' suggegtions and layered it pasta, sauce, cheese, pasta sauce cheese.  Covered with foil for the first 20 min, and it wasn't dry at all.

Instead of layering it like lasagna, I mixed the noodles and the meat/sauce combo and poured half in then added the provolone and sour cream. I also used cheddar and mozzerall to top it before baking it covered for 30 mins.

Very good! My husband and 3 kids ate well. My "growing" 16 year-old son had 3 helpings, and I still have 1/2 left (plan to freeze single servings to pack for work lunches). Since the pasta and meat went straight from my pots to the baking dish, I only had to bake @ 15-20 mins for the cheese to melt... nice time savings for rushed evenings. I'd give it 5 stars, but seasoning is key to any Italian, tomato-based dish and should "require" IMO garlic (1 t. minced while browning meat) and oregano at the VERY LEAST. I also added: marjoram, thyme, and rosemary (basically 1/2 t. of Italian seasoning). Another variance to keep the dish from being dry (as some reviewers complained of), I poured @ 1/2 jar of the sauce straight from the jar directly to the bottom of the baking dish. I did not cover, used all the ingredients recipe called for, and it was NOT dry at all. There were actually "juices" running on the bottom of baking dish. I served it with garlic toast (just sliced bread in my toaster) and spinach salad. Delicious and I will make again.

Substituted the sour cream with ricotta & egg and turned out great.  9x13 dish nearly overflowing.  Classico pasta sauces work well.

Love this recipe I use Italian turkey sausage instead of beef and add garlic. Also I used butternut squash sauce instead of regular spaghetti sauce. I also used a round pyrex dish, presents well.

I rarely rate recipes on this site and I have been using it every day for years. This recipe is amazing! Wow!! I made it just as directed. The only thing I added was garlic and doubled the cheese. Not really a modification, we just love cheese. I would never put ricotta in this.. Ricotta is grainy and yuck. The sour cream gave it a rich and creamy texture.. Whatever you do don't follow LP's advice. I did cover it the entire time it baked and it was not dry at all. Very yummy and the entire family went back for more. This is a keeper. I may try with sausage next time to give it more of a bite. Thank you!

This was ok. I had a lot of liquid at the bottom of my pan, and it wasn't piping hot after 30 minutes. It was sort of watery.

I just did this recipe and it turned out great!  I did not have provolone so I used Munster cheese.  I did not have enough spag sauce on hand so I used a 15 oz can of tomatoes to replace the sauce I was lacking.

The family requests that this be in regular rotation!  It is one of the best italian casseroles we've ever had.  I agree with previous reviewers that success of this dish is dependent on the sauce that you use.  I use two jars of Classico Spicy Tomato & Basil.  I stick with the sour cream and cheeses recommended in the recipe and think this is fabulous.  I am a huge ricotta cheese fan, but for this recipe, the sour cream / provolone + mozzarella hits the mark perfectly.  Because this does make such a big dish, I buy a deep dish disposable 13x9 aluminum pan so it all fits.  I also like not having to wash a pan with mozzarella cheese stuck all over things at the end.  

I also layered this a bit differently based on other reviewer suggestions.  I save a little bit (say ~ 1/5 of one jar of sauce) that I put on the bottom of the pan, then put a layer of ziti on that, cover with the tomato / meat mixture, then sour cream, then cheese, and repeat.  I ended up with 3 layers, but it all depends on how thick you make your layers and the size of your pan.  The casserole does not have any dry spots this way.  

I'm sure it will be very good with other variations; italian sausage, ground turkey, etc., but you do not need to change one thing!  Thank you Colleen for such a great dish!

My new favorite ziti recipe! I have been making another recipe for over 20 years and decided recently that I'm not crazy about it. I  made this for company last week and loved it! It got rave reviews, and the leftovers were thoroughly enjoyed as well! The main difference that I liked was the sour cream layer. It was much tastier than the ricotta I have always used. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was much better than I expected. I have never made this particular dish, but have tried it when others have made it and always found it dry. I think, what sets this one apart is the amount of sauce. It keeps it plenty moist while baking. I dislike jarred pasta sauce, so I used some of The Best Marinara Sauce Yet from the site. I then stretched it with some blended tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried parsley, garlic powder, mushroom spaghetti seasoning, and a little white wine. I just measured out the 52oz in a large measuring cup. I made it the night before and it filled a 13x9 pan to the very top. Only other change I made was using all mozzarella and rotini pasta I had on hand. I also used reduced fat sour cream, in which I was short about 1/4 cup, and 1.5 lbs of lean beef I needed to use up. This recipe seems pretty forgiving. I baked it for 1 hour, because I was taking it from the fridge overnight, and kept foil on it the whole time while baking. This would be great when family visits.

love this so much! been using this as my "go-to" recipe when i have company for years. i use the following modifications from someone else's comments:

Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don't need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind. This is SO MUCH BETTER than the sour cream version!

I couldn't find ziti from Safeway, so I used rigatoni instead. It was still easy to cook and tasted very delicious. I had to boil the rigatoni longer than 8 minutes though for it to be soft.

A new addition to our rotation.  Delicious!  I made it pretty much as written.  I changed the layering as most of the reviewers have suggested.  So: Noodles>Sauce>Provolone>Sour Cream>Noodles>Sauce>Mozz>Sauce>Parm.  Also I just seasoned the meat with garlic powder and onion powder instead of using the chopped onion.  Use yummy, quality ingredients - I imagine it is only as good as what you put into it!  This was easy, delicious comfort food.  You won't regret making it!

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times.  It's delicious as written, but also flexible if you want to mix up the ingredients a bit.  This makes a huge batch - so for my family of 5, I make the recipe, but split it into 2 pans.  One that I cook and another that I freeze for later.  Freezes very well.

Amazing!!! I messed up and only used one bottle of pasta sauce and it was still good. When I make this again I will use two pans instead of the one. I was smashing ziti down to fit it all in. I don't know if I could have fit the second bottle of pasta sauce in the one pan anyway.

read many reviews, opted to make it exactly as shown (not as written, as order of adding ingredients differ between them) but it was fabulous! 
Froze half for later use, just as good, if not better.

Loved this recipe, it was delicious. Did not substitute any thing but changed the layering the 2nd time I made it only because I like my cheese to be on the top. This will be on our weekly menu. Thanks for sharing!!

Very nice:) I covered it and it turned out nice. The boyfriend loved it :) I added onion powder instead of an onion(because I don't like cutting them and don't like them very much), parsley flakes, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat

This wasn't bad it just was a bit too cheesy for my liking and the noodles didn't have very much of the sauce flavor to them.  Next time I'd use a different cheese than provolone or try to find shredded provolone so I can evenly distribute it and adjust the amount a bit.  The slices of provolone were just a bit too think (especially where the slices overlapped). I'll also mix the pasta with some of the sauce before putting it in the pan so the pasta has an even coating of sauce to soak up the flavor.  I might also try half ground beef and half sausage to also add more flavor to the recipe.  Overall it wasn't bad it just needs a few tweaks to meet my expectations.

Made this the other night & it was delish.  Even hubby loved it.  Had enough left-over for 2 more meals for 3 people.  As someone else mentioned, it was some-what difficult to spread the sour cream, so I let it sit for a while to get to room temperature. I also layered it a little differently - the provolone would seem to be a barrier keeping the meat mix from seeping through, so I layered the ziti then the meat mix.  The only thing I would do different next time is use more than 1 lb of beef - probably close to 2 lbs..  Just my preference, I like my Ziti with lots of meat...:)

Came across this recipe and made a large batch for my Christmas Buffet.  Everyone LOVED it and I have shared this recipe many, many times.  I did add extra mozzarella because we all love the stringy cheese!  I also placed some sauce on the bottom of the pan so the pasta would be more moist.  My two kids away at college are always asking me to make it when they come home.

Delicious!  I covered this as other reviews recommended and it wasn't dry at all.  Made one batch with non-fat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and reduced fat provolone and it was just as good.  Added garlic and italian seasoning to the beef/onion mixture.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good recipe. Using sour cream vs. ricotta may not be authentic, but it's a great alternative when you have kids with picky palettes.

Holy Toledo was this good!  I don't know why I did not try this before.  I halved the recipe due to my needs.  Loved the sour cream in it, made it slightly tangy and luscious.  Followed this exactly and so glad I did.  Will make again for sure!

Really good. Was a little hesitant to use sour cream instead of ricotta cheese, but it made for a much creamy dish. I used 1 1/2 jars of sauce since a lot of the reviews mentioned that 2 jars were too much... wish I had used 2 jars.

Simple and delicious!  I hate making lasagna, and this dish is essentially the same thing, minus the ricotta. The sour cream *really* helps this dish!  Moist and yummy, and you can't taste the sour cream if you are worried about picky eaters.

 I only made three changes:  I used 24 oz of Sweet Italian Sausage in place of the ground beef, used shredded 4 cheese Italian mix instead of sliced provolone + mozz, and added 1 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes to the simmmering sauce for a little spicy kick.  

I slit open the Italian Sausages and broke/crumbled them as I sauteed them.  I followed the advice of others and switched the order of layering a bit so the sauce could get to the bottom layer of noodles.  I used Ragu 7 Herb Robusto for the sauce.  **Oh, and I used a larger pan than stated.  I have a 10 x 14 non stick pan and it was perfect. 

I highly recommend this recipe, which also freezes beautifully.

I have never used a recipe for baked ziti before - just always did some some combination of ziti, ricotta cheese, sauce, mozzarella cheese and sometimes beef.  I made this recipe last night and I will always make it this way from now on.  The only substitution I made was to use ground turkey instead of ground beef.  My whole family agreed this was the best baked ziti I had ever made.  Can't wait to have the leftovers today!  Something about the sour cream makes this extra yummy - and as a bonus, sour cream is a lot less expensive than ricotta cheese!

I am one of those people who could never understand why anyone would eat baked ziti.  I never found a recipe that was tasty and that I wanted to make again, until I tried this one.  Just delicious and easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a simple and fantastic recipe.  I read all the reviews and decided to stay with the sour cream instead of substituting to ricotta.  What I did change was the provolone cheese.  I didn't have on hand so I used 4 oz of softened cream cheese.  Worked out fabulous.  This is a keeper in our household.
Thank you!

I'll admit, I am a diehard ricotta girl.  I was scared of sour cream in my pasta, but oh my goodness!  Delish!
I used Classico 4 cheese pasta sauce, omitted the ground beef, and halved the recipe.  Perfect for my family of 5!  Even the kiddos loved it!

This is a good recipe, but it's a little saucy for me. Try reducing it to 1 1/2 jars sauce or replace 1 jar with a large can of drained diced tomatoes. I use sliced provolone on the first layer and an 8oz. bag of shredded Italian blend for the second and the topping. Sour cream works great, but ricotta would be good too. I coat the pan with olive oil, as butter can cause the pasta to stick to the bottom.

Had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand.  Used 1/2 pound of beef not 1 pound. Used 250g (about 8 oz) of ricotta, mixed with an egg and a dash of nutmeg (per other reviewers' suggestions) instead of sour cream.  Used all provolone, no mozzarella as I was also out of that.  Layered as follows: ziti plus sauce mixed together, then provolone, then soft cheese mixture (ricotta), then more noodles, then more sauce, then sprinkled liberally with parmesan, then finished with slices of provolone. Covered pan with tin foil sprayed with cooking spray to keep it from sticking to the cheese.  I'd like to try making the recipe closer to the original next time but am satisfied with how I had to adapt it for what was available at the time. I had about a cup of noodles left over (I may have cooked the noodles a bit too long in the beginning so they expanded in size a lot).

Totally dig this recipe. So cheesy and tasty. I browned Italian sausage and used that instead of beef, and it worked out great! There was so much food, I could have fed 6 people. Thanks for this sweet recipe!

Outstanding!!! This is definately a KEEPER. I cook alot & use many recipes on this site & this is the absolute BEST so far. If I could, I'd give this recipe 100 stars. Everyone in my family loved it and asked me to make it the next day. My daughter stopped after eating the first bite and couldn't stop telling me how good it was. They ate it all and was asking for more. I couldn't believe it because this recipes makes alot so make sure to use a large baking dish. I changed a few things after reading the reviews. I added 1/2 lb ground chuck & 1/2 lb Italian sausage. While frying, I added some chopped onion, 2 small cloves garlic-minced, salt & pepper. I used Meat Flavor Prego & added bay leaves & basil and let half the sauce simmer a little bit with the fried meat and simmered 1 jar alone to mix with the ziti before layering. I baked it 15 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered and it was not dry at all. IMPORTANT - Make sure to only cook the ziti al dente because it softens even more while baking and you don't want your ziti too soft and mushy. Another thing, I used sour cream and it made it soooo creamy. I don't think there's a person on this planet who won't love this meal. Enjoy!!!

This has become one of my families favorite recipes.  I changed the way that I layer it because of other reviewers comments.  I do pasta, sauce (1/2 hamburger, 1/2 Italian sausage), cheese, sour cream (place in a baggie and cut the corner off then you can pipe it onto the casserole instead of trying to spread it) then repeat.  Super amazing recipe!

Used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and it turned out a lot better. I also seasoned the onions and ground beef while I cooked it with trader joes everyday seasoning. I think it is very important to use good sauce otherwise the dish will not come out well. But overall it was super simple and very good for how basic it is to make.

This was wonderful. I followed the others advice and reduced the sour cream by half and added 3/4 cups of low fat ricotta.  In fact- I used all low fat cheeses and it turned out great!  Thanks for te recipe!

I just made this over the weekend- I followed several of the suggestions in previous reviews (layer of sauce on the bottom, layer of sauce over the ziti before the cheese goes one) these were very helpful tips. I have never added sour cream to baked ziti before so I was unsure how it would blend in by just putting it on the ziti - I decided to mix it into the sauce- this created a creamier sauce (if you prefer this type of sauce I suggest doing it but it can be a bit much with the other cheeses) Also the amount of cheese called for does not seem like a lot but it is probably perfect (I added more then it said and was much to cheesy).  It was still good and I will make it again but will stick to the recipe and not make the cheese changes next time and hopefully this post will help keep others from making them too. The one thing that I did change that I really thought made a positive difference is I did a semi homemade spaghetti sauce instead of the jar: the recipe I used is from this website "Tomato Sauce" by EICHORN- it is very simple and delicious.

This is a great recipe.  It's even good without beef, for those of us who are vegetarians.  I never knew sour cream could create such wonderful flavor in a pasta dish.  Thanks for sharing this quick and easy meal.

Delicious! - I sauteed chicken breast pieces, mushrooms, and onions in olive oil.  Used about 2 tbsp of sour cream only.  Everyone loved it!

Great! I added sausage to mine and that just does it. I took the advice of others and layered the sauce over my ziti. Really gotta get me a deep baking dish though. It was the right size length and width but so not deep enough. Thanks!

Followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out great.  Added some garlic/pepper, Italian seasoning to the sauce mixture and made sure to cover it when I baked it.  Really, really good.  Will definitely make it again.

As others said I changed it a bit. Adding the sauce before the provolone cheese, and covering it with aluminum foil before baking.

The 4 year old boy woke up this morning ran downstairs opened the fridge and proclaimed I want those noodles and sauce again for dinner tonight! 

That's an endorsement if I've ever heard one. Will be going in my normal rotation.

I absolutely love this recipe.  Tried it today for the first time.  I made no changes to the ingredients, only the way I layered it.  When putting the first layer of zit, I put the sauce next and mixed it some before putting the cheese and sour cream.  Also, I could only find the mozzarella/provolone mixed shredded, so I used that.  It came out wonderfully.  Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this 3 times in the past month to rave reviews and it's so simple and easy. I only needed a few revisions: added 1/4 cup of Philly Cooking creme cheese in the italian herb mix flavor, baked covered for 20 minutes and the last ten minutes uncovered and made sure the dish rested for at least 30-45 minutes before serving (otherwise it came out a bit soupy.) Instead of browning the meat, I just added good quality defrosted premade meatballs to the outer edges so the meat eaters were happy.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it! I did follow it exactly and  I covered it with tin foil. After I put it in the oven I read some reviews and got nervous. I was going to substitute Ricotta for the sour cream but I didn't thinking it would be too much like lasagna. It was a nice change and very flavorful. My 8 and 10 year old boys loved it and my husband had seconds!! I will make it again.

This recipe was good. Not my favorite baked ziti as it really tasted like lasagna. I found that the sour cream or ricotta (which ever you prefer) was not enough. If I make this again I will cut back on the meat as it was to much and add 50% more sour cream/ricotta.

This was really great.  I am Italian but I live in Greece and I used Fage 0% Greek Yogurt in place of the sour cream.  My daughter loved it and wanted leftovers until it was gone.  I actually like it better than authentic Italian...shhhh.  Thanks!

Excellent!!  Easy and the whole family went back for seconds.  The recipe makes a ton.  For my family of 4, I divide the recipe in half and freeze for a later date.   Freezes very well.  I also mix the pasta with the meat sauce to simplify the layering process.

It was excellent! I followed the recipe as is except that i layered it differently, and i added basil, oregano, and garlic. I put the Ziti on the bottom, mixed it up with the sauce, and then put more sauce on the top. I put the sour cream next slathered it around then put the provolone slices on top.. then mozarella cheese, and sprinkled with parmesean. Then i put more ziti on top. It was DELICOUS!!!! Everyone loved it! I served it with Garlic Bread and sprinkled some Basil over the top

My husband made this for us and it was amazing!  The sour cream is the secret ingredient that really gives this meal a kick.  He halved the recipe and I'm glad he did.  We had leftovers the next night (my idea since I loved it so much the first night) and the flavors were even better!  He asked if I'd make it using "World's Best Pasta Sauce" from this site, which would make this dish simply stellar.

I thought this turned out really well and wasn't difficult to make.  I didn't like the idea of sour cream so believe it or not, I used low fat cream cheese (8 oz. block).  And yes, make sure you bake it COVERED.  I also used one jar of traditional spaghetti sauce (classico tomato and basil) and one jar of Vodka sauce - that gave it a rich flavoring that I really enjoyed.  I prepared this Sunday meal for my husband and I and we had plenty of leftovers for the week.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a tasty and easy recipe for the entire family.  My husband hates lasagna (after working at an Italian restaurant and getting all you can eat lasagna during his shifts- he is burnt out), but he loved this.  I love ricotta, and was hesitant not to use it in the recipe, but the sour cream was delicious!  As suggested by some other readers- my layers were: sauce, ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, sauce and then mozzarella.  I also added lots of garlic to the meat (I used Italian sausage).  Make sure to get a good spaghetti sauce- because there is a lot of it in this meal. Even if you don't have to, I would recommend making the dish the night before and letting it sit overnight.  I thought the leftovers were even better than when we served it the first time.

I won't say that this is the most excellent Italian dish I've ever tasted, but for what it is, it's most excellent. I'm all about the 1-pot meals, and this will go into my busy weeknight rotation. Need a dish to take to someones house who has kids? This is it.

It's easy and pretty affordable, too. I added some garlic to the meat b/c, after all- it's an Italian dish! That was the only change I made.

Good solid recipe. The only changes I made -- I added some bell peppers to the onion/ground beef mix to increase the amt of veggies. I also added ricotta cheese -- did 1 cup ricotta plus 1/2 cup sour cream. Will definitely make this again.

My family and I loved this dish!  I have made it three times now.  I didn't do anything different except I didn't use cooking spray on my glass baking dish.  I didn't need it.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Very good, versatile, and easy. I added minced garlic and green pepper and mixed it all together rather than layer it (only because i was feeling kinda lazy). Be sure to cover this with foil so it doesn't dry out in the oven, and remove foil during the last 15 minutes to brown the top. The kids and husband loved it, so I will be making this again, adding a can of diced tomatoes.

I love this recipe exactly as is.  I know it's traditional to use ricotta, but the sour cream is a nice little variation.  And it WILL all fit in a 13X9 baking dish.  I have a huge Tupperware bowl that I use to mix the pasta with the meat sauce, allowing the sauce to go inside the hollows.  Then layer everything.  It works really well!

I LOVED this recipe, which was "real", trust me!  I have made the same baked ziti recipe for many years, and I can safely say that I have thrown the old one away.  I really enjoyed the use of SOUR CREAM over ricotta, as the sour cream doesn't soak up much of the sauce...which also makes it more enjoyable the next day.  No more ricotta, for me.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

What is not to love about Baked Ziti!  This turns out great evertime.  I normally half this recipe and serve in an 8x8 for my family of 4 and have put in Cottage Cheese instead of Sour Cream in the past.  Both options are good (Sour Cream/Cottage Cheese)

Wow, wow, wow!!! Great recipe.  I have been making the Pampered Chef version of this for years (with ricotta) but this is much better. I added 2 hot italian sausages to the ground beef to add a little spice (for us California girls)  Yumma!!
Also used fat free sour cream and mozzarella only in both layers.  This is a gem!!

This is the ultimate 'clean out the fridge' dinner with all of the deliciousness of baked ziti.  Had half a container of sour cream (amazing addition that i have never used before), half ricotta, half a package of pepperoni. couple different kinds of pasta sauce and a couple of half boxes of short pasta.  Came out absolutely amazing!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

My fiance absolutely loved this dish! He even got thirds! I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and it was perfect. I thought the recipe called for too much sauce but it turned out perfect. I would definitely pour the sauce over the noodles as others have suggested. I put the provolone slices on top of the sauce mixture and then put dollops of ricotta cheese here and there. It was wonderful! Thank you so much.

I really wanted this to be a hit, but my four year old son did not like it and my husband was pretty silent on the outcome which means he would not be sad if I didn't ever make it again.  It's not terrible by any means, but it's just kind of bland.  My son really likes the "Cheesy Baked Ziti at Fazoli's and this just wasn't similar to that.  I'm not quite sure what it needs but garlic, salt and fresh herbs would probably improve upon this recipe.

I really liked this!  Followed the suggestion to pour sauce directly on pasta and it worked well.  Does make a lot of food... more than enough for six adults.  Next time I might try with ground turkey. 
**update** I tried it with ground turkey and liked it even better!  Also, I only used 1 cup of sour cream and it was still spectacular!  I also used 8oz. of both the provolone and mozzarella cheese.

Nixed the beef, onion, and moz.  Only used 1 jar of sauce.  Subbed shredded cheddar for provolone.  Subbed low fat plain yoghurt for sour creme.  Added 12 oz artichoke hearts, chopped.  Yum!

This is fabulous! I first made it for my husband's boss for her birthday and she loved it, then on Saturday I made 4 huge batches for our Valentines dinner/party for about 35 people. Everyone raved about it and my friends who were staying for the weekend opted for Ziti for breakfast rather than biscuts & gravy. My husband now wants it as part of our regular menu. I didn't change a thing. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This got a thumbs up at dinner last night, I didn't tell them there was sour cream in the middle. I thought it was missing something, but I thought that about the Albondigas the other night too! Maybe it's my tastebuds that are "missing something".

Yum! I couldn't find ziti anywhere, so I used rigatoni. I also used light sour cream, and the pasta sauce that I had available, which was one marinara and one tomato/basil. I'd like to try this with some whole wheat pasta. It's also great for leftovers, since it's a huge recipe.

I made this easy recipe for a party and it was a huge hit! I recommend what others have done, and that's to stir up the bottom layer with the sauce so that the noodles are integrated in the sauce.  Also make sure you cover it with tin foil.  You can make this ahead and put it in the fridge until you are ready to make it in the oven - just be aware that if the foil touches the cheese that the foil will rip it right off the top!! So make a "tent" of foil over the top of the pan so that the foil isn't lying directly on top of your ziti!  I used fake meat for a vegetarian spin.  Boca crumbles work fantastic as well as the fake meatballs all mashed up :)

All of the important things about this recipe have already been said numerous times. I will just say that I have used this recipe for years and have made it for all of my friends and family.  Every person that has eaten it has RAVED about it.  It is my 8-year-old son's and husband's favorite pasta dish so I make it almost weekly.  You cannot go wrong with this and it's easy to make.

I am Italian and this recipe beats the Ricotta version, any day.  I used a homemade gravy (Red sauce) and dressed the ziti with the sauce before layering.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef and asiago cheese on the first layer.  My whole family LOVED it and they are picky eaters. Absolutely a keeper in my house.

This dish turned out really well. I changed the recipe by adding 3 cloves crushed garlic and using ricotta instead of sour cream.   I had made the dish the day before and it look ~2 hours too cook through (1.5hr covered .5hr uncovered) at 350 degrees. This could be due to using a deeper 3qt dish to make it in,though thought it deserved a mention.   Overall a success with plenty of left overs.

Awesome we LOVED this! The sour cream was the real winning ingredient in this dish! WOW!!! What flavor!!! Way better than Ricotta! I did put the sauce on the pasta then the cheese as other reviews suggested. I also used ground Italian seasoned Turkey.  Will make again, thanks!

I made this for Christmas Eve and took it to work as a suprise for the evening and night shifts.  It got raves, but made some changes: .5-.75 pound dry ziti (cooked 1-2 minutes less than package directions for al dente), 1 pound lean beef, .5 pound loose sausage, onion powder and garlic salt to browning, meat, Ragu Italian sausage and cheese spag. sauce, Italian blend cheese instead of provolone (24 cups shredded), .75 cup of sour cream, .75 cup cottage cheese, .5 cup parmesan cheese (mixed with sc and cc and 1 beaten egg), mixed sauce and meat with pasta before layering, and baked as directed.  I'm sure this recipe is wonderful as written, but I always make a change :)

This was an excellent recipe.. very pleasing to the palate... for those people who are complaining that this recipe did not specify the fact that you need to cook this covered at first...it's really kind of elementary...  try cooking  school before criticizing school next time.

This was perfect and delicious as written. I can never fit my baked pasta dishes into a standard 9x13 so I always use the disposable giant lasagna pans. I did add more parmesan cheese now that I think about it, just to make a little more of a cheese presence in the "crust". Do try you'll love it!

I made this exactly as written and I really think the sour cream was not the right thing for this dish. I think this could be 5 stars using maybe ricotta instead. I will try and make again with ricotta.

This recipe was not as "WONDERFUL" as some of the posts said it would be. I am looking for a ziti recipe that is similar to the ziti served at Olive Garden. This recipe was just like the homemade lasagna I make. I did take the advice of one of the other users and added 1 egg in with the noodles and used the Italian cheese mix. Still, it was not all that appetizing and I have thrown away the recipe. I would rather make the lasagna. It is easier and tasier.

Loved it and so did the whole family! Would definitely recommend putting in about a TBSP of Italian blend seasoning to spice it up.

I definitely seasoned the meat--how could you not?  I added approx.4-5 cloves of garlic, one FULL sauteed ONION, Lawrey's Seasoned Salt, salt & pepper to taste, dash of Italian Seasoning, dash of garlic salt, dash of "Seven Seasons" seasoning from Whole Foods, and Lea & Perrins while cooking.     Once the meat was done, I added the sourcream to the skillet (best to eye-ball how much) and then the Ragu spaghetti sauce.  I layered it as follows: Bottom has a light layer of meat sauce, then add some noodles, then some cheese, then meat again, lastly a light layer of noodles one more time, meat (if any left) & blended cheese on top. I baked it with the lid on top then uncovered it and baked it for an additional 10-15 or so to lightly brown the top.  I also sprinkled a Parmesan-Romano cheese blend on the very top before serving.  Awesome.  Note: I used the measurements for "4 servings" (which feeds at least 6 or 4 several times). I buy 1-1.5 lbs of 15% ground beef; 1 10 oz. traditional Ragu Sauce, and 2-six oz. packages of cheese--usually mozzarella & a sharper blended pack).

Not fantastic but was good.  I cut the recipe in half but used a full pound of ground beef cuz my boys love their beef and baked it in an 8x8 pan.  Also used ricotta instead of sour cream and 5-Italian cheese blend instead of the mozzarella just because that is what I had on hand.  I will be adding this to my recipe box.

De-Lish! I used spicy smoked sausage which I ground in the food processor only because I needed to use it up - that gave it an extra kick. We LOVED it! This will definitely go into our regular rotation! Thanks!!

I love this recipe!  I've been making it for years!  The only things I do different is that I cover with foil (as others suggested) and I mix the sauce with the noodles so that it's distributed evenly.  Like some other reviewer said, otherwise the provolone seems like a barrier and doesn't let the bottom layer of noodles get much sauce.

I started with olive oil and garlic, added onions and seasoned with crushed red pepper and oregano. Then I added ground beef, browned and finally added tomatoes (crushed tomatoes, not sauce). Tasty sauce that was a good starter. Used ricotta but added 1/4 cup of sour cream. No provolone. Even better on day two

WooHoo!!!! Another family favorite. Instead of using 1 1/2 cups sour cream, I did as someone else recommended and use a mixture of ricotta & sour cream. So so yummy. This has become a family party must.

Very good pasta dish!  I used ricotta instead of sour cream, but other than that I kept it all the same.  I'm not good at making Italian food, but this turned out really well.  When all the leftovers got eaten - I knew it was a success.

This dish was delicious!! I made a few adjustments:    I used whole wheat penne. I used one 15 ounce container of part-skim ricotta and 1/2 cup of sour cream.     I'm vegetarian so I made homemade sauce with garlic, basil, roasted red pepper, and onion.     I layered sauce and pasta at the bottom. Topped with provolone. Topped with ricotta/sour cream mixture. More sauce, pasta, more provolone, parm cheese. Then I covered, cooked for 30 minutes at 350. Then uncovered and broiled for about 5 minutes to make the top nice and brown and crispy.     Delicious!

Wonderful and kid approved!  Easy recipe.  The only changes I made were to omit all salt and to use half sour cream and half plain yogurt.

this is so much better if you leave out the sour cream and mix alfredo sauce with the spaghetti sauce. It is very similar to the 5 cheese ziti at the olive garden, but that has no meat in it.

Followed the recipe almost exactly with 2 exceptions: 1. I used low fat sour cream and 2. I mixed the pasta, sauce, and sour cream together and then layered it with the cheeses. I thought the taste of the sour cream was a bit much, but other than that, it was o.k. Not amazing. Will probably try a ricotta recipe next time.

Pretty good! My fiance came back from a business trip to Orlando on Sunday. I wanted to surprise him with a hearty welcome home meal. This was just it! I pretty much followed Colleen's directions to the letter except for one major and a couple of minor changes. Neither my fiance or I care for sour cream in Italian dishes (he doesn't like the stuff at all). I couldn't substitute ricotta because he won't eat that either. I had some French onion dip in the fridge that needed using up soooo I tried it and... viola! - an instant (and tasty!) substitute. My "minor" changes were substituting hot Italian sausage for beef (on sale and quite a bit cheaper than ground beef to boot) and changing up the layering / baking steps. To ensure that my pasta would remain moist, I mixed it with my meat sauce. I then layered everything between two 8 x 8 inch pans (saved one for later this week) as follows: pasta/sauce, provolone, dip, pasta/sauce and mozza (slices) / Romano-Parm blend cheese. I baked one casserole, covered, for 30 minutes, then broiled, uncovered, on HIGH for a few minutes to get the ooey, gooey, 'crunchy around the edges' cheese effect (mmmmmm....) :) Note: To prevent any cheese from sticking to your foil, gently spritz with cooking spray. Served with garlic bread, this was a very filling meal, certainly MUCH better than SETHALLEN's recipe (which made it into the "Favorites" cookbook and I'm not sure why...). I didn't even have room for dessert! Thanks for sharing. :-)

This was ok but I was expecting a lot more after reading the reviews. It was certainly very easy to make but it didn't have the Italian flavor I had expected.  Maybe it needed a little basil or other seasoning, but I like the ricotta cheese version better.  I made it for a party and I noticed I still had a lot of leftovers.  If I try it again, I'll do like others and substitute ricotta for the sour cream and add some spices.

Delicious!  I used Boca veggie crumbles instead of ground beef.  Also, I put a layer of sauce over the first layer of pasta before the cheese to ensure the noodles would be baked in the sauce.  The sour cream layer is what makes this tangy and wonderful.

Excellent! Made 2 casseroles for 20 ladies at my Christmas ornament party. Had half a casserole leftover. Had trouble finding ziti, they sell it at Super Target.  Used Barilla Baking Sauce, 1/2 Italian sausage, 1/2 ground beef. Also used half sour cream & 1/2 ricotta cheese. Changes per reviewers suggestions. Received 6 calls for the recipe, always a good sign!

Soooo good...to make it with a few less calories you can try it with wheat pasta, ground turkey and low fat cheese and sour cream.  This is great for a large group of people - feeds about 10-12

This is TOO good. I didn't think that I would like it with sour cream and I was tempted to try Ricotta cheese. I decided to follow the recipie exactly and I'm SO GLAD that I did. This is a keeper and I will make this often!

Strangely enough my daughter who hates any sort of pasta or red sauce liked this. It was a HUGE recipe though and I ended up with two casseroles.  The second, I froze and reheated later. The reheated one was actually better in my opinion.

My husband LOVES baked ziti- When I showed him the recipe he seemed a little skeptical about the sour cream. I used Ragu Tradional Old World Style sauce NO MEAT but I did sautee the onion and garlic in EVOO first before adding the sauce and I added about 2 TBS smart balance to the sauce as well.-(Helps to reduce the acidity of the sauce and takes the flavor to another level) I followed the advice of other reviews and mixed the sour cream with the noodles and MY HUSBAND LOVED IT. He said it was the BEST ZITI HE EVER HAD. (He is a wonderful cook himself)  DONT BE SCARED TO USE THE SOUR CREAM- its what makes this recipe truly AMAZING!! Try it - you will not regret it!

I have to admit, I never made this recipe exactly as written.  I took the advice of a couple of the other reviewers and it turned out really good...definitely a keeper recipe!  Here are the changes I made and the specific brand names we prefer...  We love the Newman's Own Cabernet Marinara sauce and Sargento brand cheeses so that's what I used.  Also, we like our dishes nice and cheesy so I used more than what the recipe called for and I decreased the onion because my husband only likes subtle onion in his food.  I mixed the sauce and pasta together before putting it in the baking dish.  I layered in this order: 1/2 the pasta & sauce mixture, 8 oz of sliced provolone (instead of 6 oz), the sour cream, the other 1/2 of the pasta & sauce mixture, 4 cups of shredded mozzarella & provolone (instead of 6 oz).  I used a baking dish that was deeper than a regular Pyrex dish so all the pasta would fit.  I baked it covered with foil for 20 minutes so it wouldn't dry out and then uncovered for an additional 10 minutes because I like the cheese to get a little brown.  It turned out moist and delicious.  I served it with Ceasar salad and garlic bread I made out of leftover hot dog buns.  My guests gobbled it up and everyone had seconds (some thirds).  Everyone loved it.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This was great! I did the same as many others and mixed the two layers of Ziti noodles with the sauce and saved some extra sauce for the top. I always add extra seasonings to my spaghetti sauce. I used Bertolli Organic Olive Oil, Basil & Garlic sauce but added more garlic powder, more basil, chipotle powder, red pepper and parmesan cheese. I like it spicy!!! We had leftovers for days! I thought it wasn't going to fit in the casserole dish but it did, BARELY!

I know you can make a number of changes to this recipe to make it "your own", golly knows there are many testaments to that in these reviews, but take my word for it, you really don't have to go to the trouble. It is great just as it is written. Thanks, cookin'mama, for a great hearty meal everyone can enjoy.

This was so good! I changed it a bit based on other reviews on another ziti recipe which mixed the pasta with the sour cream instead of having sour cream as its own layer to avoid drying out the noodles. It was an excellent modification! I also added 5 cloves of garlic, I used ground turkey and one italian sausage instead of beef. I used a cheddar mozzarella mix with the provolone. I add chili pepper flakes and italian seasoning to my sauce, and fresh basil towards the end of simmering. My layers were sloppy but tasted great so who cares! I covered for 25 minutes, uncovered for 5 and a couple minutes on broil - sprinkled the top with some fresh basil when it came out of the oven. YUM.

The best baked ziti recipe - at first I thought the amount of sour cream made it too tangy, but it must have been that particular piece. We had to line up the ziti pieces in rows, instead of a jumble, so that it would all fit in the baking dish!

I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but it worked really well in this recipe. I halved the recipe which would be plenty to feed 4. The only other changes I made were mixing the ziti with the sauce and covering the dish in the oven to keep it from drying out. I'll be turning to this recipe often.

Although I did not follow the recipe as it is shown.  I made a ricotta mixture, instead of using sour cream. I mixed together ricotta, with some mozzarella, basil, oregano and 1 beaten egg.  Then I layered it, noodles, meat, ricotta mix, shredded mozzarella, and continued until I ran out, making sure to top it with mozzarella.  Then I cooked this UNCOVERED, however I made sure to put a cookie sheet on the oven rack below it, which was a wise choice since it did dribble over a little. (I loaded the casserole dish right to the rim). Anyway, the end result was fantastic. It tasted like a cross between lasagna and ziti - and I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I first got this recipe from a family friend - and it has become a staple in our house ever since. Last time I made it I mixed the sour cream up with the ziti (someone else suggested it) and it made the whole thing so creamy and great! This also works well if you only have 2 people in your house like I do to split it between 2 smaller dishes and freeze one.

This was good, REAL good... I followed a lot of recommendations and put the sauce directly on the pasta. Also to sneak some veggies into the dish, I sauted up some mushrooms, garlic and a 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach and layered  it in middle with the provolone and sour cream. Even my 4 year old NO VEGGIES!!! eater ate this... will make again :)

I had made this dish three times already and had tried out both the original provolone & sour cream and the suggestion of using ricotta & egg instead. At my house, we definitely prefer the ricotta & egg over the creamer flavor of the original ingredients. Here are some simple changes that I'd recommend to make this recipe even better:  1) Use Italian sausage meat instead of ground beef for additional flavor. Heck, try the Italian TURKEY sausage meat as a healthier option. There's plenty of cheese and sauce in this recipe to make up for the lost fat by choosing this leaner protein source.  2) For additional flavor while sneaking in those veggies, add 2+ cloves of garlic and 1 pound of sliced mushroom while browning the onion and meat. After adding the jars of spaghetti sauce, add 2 tsp each of dried oregano and basil for additional seasoning.  3) Like I've said above, I'd recommend using 1 pound of ricotta mixed with 1 egg instead of the provolone & sour cream.  4) Since this recipe reminded me of my favorite lasagna dish, I've decided to add 10oz of thawed, drained frozen chopped spinach to the mix. Here's how I layer the dish: pour some sauce to the bottom of the dish first to prevent the ziti from sticking to the dish, ziti, meat sauce, ricotta & egg, mozarella, spinach (drained well!), ziti, meat sauce, ricotta & egg, mozarella, and Parmesan cheese to finish off.  5) Definitely cover this dish with foil for the first 25 min. Then uncover and broil for the last 5 min to bro

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and the mix of flavors was very good.  I'm sure it depends on what kind of sauce people use.  The only thing I am not sure of is how in the picture of this recipe, the ziti looks like a nice square.  When we dipped it out of the pan, it was pretty mushy.  But delicious nonetheless.  The recipe is quite big -- we eat a lot and figured this was plenty for 3 meals for 2 people.  So we froze a portion.

Tastes like it came from a restaurant .  Like one other reviewer posted...you have to COVER this with tin foil when you bake it.  Don't risk it drying out while baking.  I covered mine like that reviewer said and it turned out looking like the picture that is posted with it.

I thought this was good. I followed another user's suggestions and used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream, and I cut out the provolone. I thought it was still missing a little something... maybe garlic? Overall, a good dish. Plenty of leftovers to freeze. I will definitely make again, maybe with sour cream and provolone instead like the original recipe suggests.

I made this just as it's written except I used italian sausage in place of gr beef and halved it, cooking it in a square stone baking dish. Excellent! Even my picky 6 year old loved it! Thank you for a great recipe.

I made this recipe and my family loved it. The next time I make it I think I will put the sauce on top of the first layer of noodles and then do the cheeses. I didn't change anything else in the recipe and it turned out great.

I have never made Baked Ziti until now, it was delish, very similar to Lasagna. My entire family loved this, I never thought to use sour cream in place of ricotta or cottage cheese, it was great! I did as someone suggested and put some of the sauce over the pasta on the first layer, definately a 5 star.

This recipe was good, except for the sour cream.  It was very weird to have sour cream in ziti!  I will make this again, but I will use ricotta instead.  I also mixed some of the sauce in with the noodles because I was afraid they would be too dry if I didn't.

I wasn't sure about using sour cream, since my husband and son don't like it...but tried it anyway.  Turns out, this is a family favorite!  I use Ragu with roasted garlic and think that gives a nice depth to the tomato flavor.

This is a good basic recipe...  I followed it as written for the first time.  I was afraid it would have too much sauce, but it didn't - it was just right.  The sour cream was a nice change from cottage cheese or ricotta.  Next time I'll use more mozzarella, and maybe add some peppers or bigger chunks of onions - that's just a personal preference though.

I made this recipe almost to the tee expect two slight changes, i used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream only because i am a fan of ricotta. I also used ground turkey meat (i don't eat red meat). and it turned out GREAT. I was surprised how much it made, I had six people over for dinner and still had leftovers.

I've made this before and I'm making it again as I write this review, I agree it is a great recipe, and as far as seasonings thats up to your personal liking and the cover up is a no fail so don't blame the recipe submitter. This is great my family loves it,  I usually do 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream and mix them with the noodles, then layer sauce, noodle mixture, cheese and so forth. but to each it's own. thank you for providing me with a new meal for my recipe collection.

Delicious! 

For this dish I used Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce and made several modifications based on previous posts. I added a tablespoon of garlic and one and a half cups of mushrooms while sautéing the onions, and I mixed a teaspoon each of garlic powder and oregano into the sour cream before spreading onto the provolone layer. Being a vegetarian I also used one 12 oz package of Morningstar Farms Griller's crumble in place of the ground beef. 

Lot's of flavor here I assure you. This will replace my old ziti recipe as the new standard. Thanks for the recipe and the modification suggestions.

Family (of 4) really liked this - even my hubby who doesn't care for pasta commented that it was good.  My 14 yr old son had three helpings, and hubby had two!  I made very few/minor changes: used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef (make sure you break up the sausage for even mix!), used mostaccioli instead of Ziti, and used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded.  Sprayed casserole dish with olive oil, and it worked perfectly for clean up.  Also, covered first 20 minutes, then uncovered last five (didn't bake the entire 30 minutes) and let "rest" for an additional five.  Delightful as is.  Might try adding minced garlic when browning next time to see if that's even better.  Might also try adding Italian seasonings for same reason.  Either way, this is a keeper.  Served with plain French bread and "Roasted Garlic Cauliflower" from this site.  ---  Btw, I almost never measure anything, so cheeses and sauce may have been more or they may have been less.  I eyeball everything!

Incredible! Although this received so many great reviews, I was hesitant to make a pasta dish with sour cream and provolone. I followed the recipe exactly and am glad I did.  My family gulped this down.  Husband and both boys had seconds instantly.  The flavors blend themselves incredibly.  There is something magical about this combination, because every bite is creamy/cheesy but not in an overkill kind of way.  It is just pleasant.  Bite after bite after bite.  The portion is gigantic, but this was one dish the family gladly ate for leftovers.  I am making it for our family day-after-Christmas gathering.  This recipe is quick and easy to make.  DEFINITELY use the reader tip to put the sour cream in a baggie and pipe it on so it's even.  It was hard to spread the sour cream on top of sliced provolone on top of pasta, but it still turned out great.  Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe.

Deliciousooo!!! This is fantastic. I took the advice of others and coated the pasta in the sour cream. I think by doing this, the pasta stayed moist and didn't absorb too much sauce. This is just awesome!!! Thank you for submitting this piece of culinary perfection.

This is an absolute staple in our household.  We use it for everything from dinner to pot lucks to party entree.  I season my sauce with rosemary and whatever else strikes my fancy that day.  I bake 30 mins covered with foil, then 10-15 mins uncovered to brown the top a bit.

I've been making this recipe for about 3 months.  My family loves it!!!  I use the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this web site and ricotta cheese, instead of the jar sauce and provolone.  So Good!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This was to die for!! The provolone and sour cream make it so rich and creamy. My hubby said he like this better then my stuffed shells ..and he really LOVES my stuffed shells. I blended the sour cream with about a cup of cottage cheese in the blender. WAAAY better then using ricotta. I also added lots of fresh mushrooms, garlic and onion while cooking the beef. Use a good quality sauce! ~ Makes all the differance. And .. I used rotini pasta because ...well because I just like rotini! Mixed the beef and sauce in well with the pasta between layers. Next time im going to leave out the beef and serve with Garlic Chicken from this site. =)Deserves every one of these 5 star reviews!! Thanks =D ***UPDATE*** This time added crumbled italian sausage instead of ground beef and added canned spinach (1/2 the can) to the sour cream/ cottage cheese mixture.  Soooo yum! You can make many varaitions with this recipe =D

i had to stop myself from from just sitting down with the casserole dish in my lap and eating the whole thing. i imagine that it would also be good with italian sausage. i think that i didn't use all the sour cream or provolone that the recipe called for, but it didn't seem to make a difference!

This is so incredibly good.  I added about half again as much mozzarella and 1/2 cup heavy cream to the sauce after it simmered.  Unbelievably rich, creamy and delicious.

Everyone loved this one. I will make this many more times. Upon reading some of the other reviews, I changed two things. First I used quite a bit more of all three cheeses (I don't believe we would have liked it if we had used the called-for amounts). I also stirred together the pasta and sauce and layered it sauce/pasta, Parmesan, provalone, sour cream, sauce/pasta, Parmesan, and then ended with mozzarella.

Very good baked ziti!  Just be sure if you are a novice cooker like me to be sure and cover it while it bakes!  I wouldn't have known to cover it unless I'd read some of the reviews!  Will definitely make this again!

I have been making this recipe for several years now it is always a hit!  The only thing I change is I mix the meat sauce with the noodles and then assemble.  By doing this I never run the risk of it drying out.  I also think it makes assembly easier.  Also, I add fresh herbs to whatever spaghetti sauce I am using.  This recipe will not disappoint!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend didn't care for the sour cream, but I thought it was the best part! I used the Garden Spaghetti recipe for the sauce and it was great. Thank you for this!

Three words: Quick, Easy, Tasty. I thought this was a very tasty and easy recipe. I gave it a trial run last night as I wanted to use it for my mother's 94th birthday party. Based on reviewer comments, I added salt, minced garlic, basil and oregano (all to taste). I layered 1/2 the ziti,sauce mix and cheese and used 1 cup sour cream. I think I'll try Ricotta cheese next time or 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta. I really like ricotta but the sour cream was also good. I used Bertolli olive oil and garlic sauce. I didn't think I'd like the sour cream, but you couldn't tell. This is a keeper and a good party or buffet dish.

This was really easy, and pretty good.  I made it for a potluck and it was all gone at the end.  It uses readily avaiable ingredients.

My family LOVES this recipe. The sour cream mixes with the provolone layer to produce a lasagne-like dish. Modifications-I make the sauce with ground turkey, and I layer as follows: ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, shredded 6-cheese italian blend. I bake uncovered because we love the crunchy top layer of cheese. Super easy to make!

I am a vegetarian, so I used this recipe, but omitted the beef, instead I added some zucchini and spicy peppers, it turned so well, and my father in law even liked it, and he will hardly ever eat any type of pasta.  The sour cream layer seemed odd to me, but turned out so amazing, this will go into my recipe arsenal, and I will use it for a long time to come

This was probably the best baked ziti I've ever had and my husband said it was one of his favorite dishes I've prepared. Unfortunately I prefer southwest/hispanic flavors over italian so for me it wasn't spectacular but still really good. As others recommended I put ziti in first, then sauce. I made my own sauce using a recipe from this site (best marinara sauce yet).  I also used Italian sausage instead of ground beef for additional spices and aroma. I will make this again since my hubby loved it so much! I'll make the sauce from scratch again, use a little extra sour cream for more tang and add some ricotta for texture.

Very tasty!  If you can't find ziti - any [tube] shaped pasta will work fine, I used mostaccioli.  I decided to make this without meat (but still sauteed onion with some garlic then added the pasta sauce) and it was superb without it!  This is essentially a lasagna casserole.   I used sour cream - however, you can use any combination of sour cream, ricotta, cottage cheese, or plain yogurt (I typically use yogurt and ricotta for my lasagna because it's healthier and lower in fat).  I added a generous 1/2 cup grated parmesan to the sour cream and a couple tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley.  I doubled the amount of mozzarella!  Since my daughters don't care for spicy - I sprinkled crushed red peppers afterwards on the adults servings... it was very very good!  This recipe makes a LOT - excellent for leftovers.  Otherwise, you can prepare two separate dishes; bake one and freeze the other for another occasion!

Excellent! I improvised a bit; didn't have ground beef so used some leftover chicken breast. Also had ricotta cheese and used 1/2 cup of that with 1 cup of sour cream and used sliced mozzarella instead of provolone. It was very tasty!

Wonderful recipe!  The only thing that I changed was I added some fresh chopped garlic, and I changed the way I layered it.  I mixed the sauce & noodles up before layering into the dish so that the sauce would get into them all and there would not be any dry noodles.  Then I added the sour cream, then the cheese.  I will definatly be making this one again.  Love it!

I have never made ziti before and didn't realize I would need more sour cream than I had. However, I used about 1/2 cup of sour cream and this dish turned out really well! My husband says it's one of his favorite leftovers too. I will definitely make this easy & delicious recipe again!

I would give this recipe 10 STARS if I could.  I think it is the sour cream that really makes the difference.  One of the best recipes I've ever made.  

Also, just wanted to note that I was able to fit all of it into a 9 x 13 pan with no problems at all.

This recipe was great, but I'm not quite sure I'm used to the tangy sour cream.  My boys loved it though and had seconds and even made sure to pack leftovers in their lunches!  I did cut down the recipe to 4 servings and used half mild italian sausage/half ground beef.  I also threw some sliced olives into the sauce mixture.  We will make this again, even with the tangy sour cream it was still delicious!  Thanks!

I made this last night for dinner. My family really enjoyed it. I was unable to find ziti pasta, so I used rigatoni. It worked just as well. I did follow advice from others, and layered it differently which worked out for me. Will definitely make again. I will probably add cayenne pepper or something to give it a little kick though

I really like this recipe. Make sure to use a spaghetti sauce you love - makes all the difference.

After seeing how many great reviews this recipe received, I made it for Sunday dinner for our extended families. When I told my Father what we were having the week before, he was not impressed (he's not a pasta lover), but when he tried some he loved it!! Everyone could not say enough great things about this ziti. I made 2 dishes of it and my husband and had leftovers for a few days after. I will definitely make this dish agian! This recipe is in the front of my recipe box with the ones I use the most!

i wasn't able to take a photo of my ziti but i think ya'll know how a baked ziti looks like anyway.

i pretty much followed the original recipe except that i added a layer of meat sauce right on top of the bottom layer of ziti then the layer of provolone. that was a recommendation from other reviewers. i think it works.

this recipe is pretty fail proof. i think it would have tasted better if i had used a diff. spaghetti sauce. i bought two glasses of organic trader joes spaghetti sauces. each jar is about 26 oz. and was the perfect amount for 8 servings. the baked ziti pasta is perfect b/c it is tougher than other kinds of pasta. it holds up well even after a couple days. the ziti actually tastes better after a day or two. i think the sauce just fuses into the pasta. i also added about 4 cloves of minced garlic to the meat. it just gave it much more flavor.

i'm big spicy food so i ended up pouring tobasco sauce all over the top. next time, i would add some crushed red pepper flakes into the meat sauce and maybe even  a cup of white wine when it simmers. it was missing something in the end so i think by adding these two ingredients will help a lot. 

the secret to this recipe is def. the sour cream. i would add more of it or just add a dollop on top after it's baked. it gives it that sour tangy taste.

This baked ziti was very good.  I mixed the sauce in with the ziti and then followed the directions about layering for the rest of the ingredients.  I did not use any beef, and I still used the same amount of sauce but used a smaller baking dish.  I baked it covered with foil except for the last couple mins to brown the cheese a little.  The sour cream was good, but I think next time I'll use ricotta.

this ziti was very yummy-much richer than the average ziti.  It got rave reviews at a church potluck.

I love this website! This is one of my favorite dishes so far. I used Traditional Prego, doubled the amount of cheese and seasoned the meat with garlic salt and onion powder as well as onions. I had to make 2 batches, the boyfriend doesn't like onions, and because of that I messed up the layers, but no harm done. Tasted great!

This is my favorite Italian dish and this recipe hit it on the spot! The sour cream sounded odd at first but you can't tell when it is done that it is in there and for someone who doesnt like sourcream that was a plus! I looked at others reveiws and layered differently as well, doing 1/2 ziti, 1/2 sauce, provolone, sour cream, remaining pasta, sauce then I covered the top completely with the mozzarella! It was a wonderful dish and made a ton, but I didn't need two trays, I fit it into 1.

ABSOLUTE BEST ZITI RECIPE!  It does make alot.  Like others , I put in 2 pans & freeze one.  I have made this many times.  I also mix together sour cream, sauce & pasta before layering.  When I do make it in 1 pan it has always been a hit at sports award dinners & pot lucks.  I have been asked for this recipe many a time.  When making into 2 trays, you need more cheese.  I layer 6 slices prov. cheese per tray.  Also, I can't be bothered to measure out 1 1/2  cups sour cream so I just use a 16 oz. container.  IT'S GREAT!

This is definitely a keeper!  I've made ziti with Ricotta for years and never thought of making it with sour cream.  My husband's newest 'favorite' dinner.  He wanted to know when we were having it again!  I made it exactly as the directions said only I covered it for the first 20 minutes.  Great dish!

The recipe always turns out great for me (and I cook uncovered unlike all of the people with negative responses on here). Maybe mine is soupier, or the way I layer the top makes a difference on dryness?? I don't know, all I do know is it has never turned out bad and I always get positive comments when I make it from others!

Note: Instead of adding two jars of spaghetti sauce, I don't even pay attention to how big of cans I use, I just make my normal spaghetti recipe with either turkey meat or sausage depending on what I have in the freezer at the time and add it when I'm layering.

Very good! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did add garlic when sauting the beef. My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again. Next time I would make it in 2 smaller pans and freeze one.

The sour cream is ingenious! I look to this site for inspiration for new meals or ideas to jazz up basic recipes-then use what I have on hand. The sour cream was a 5-star addtion to a regular Ziti that I make using italian sausage, baby bella mushrooms, any pasta shape I have, mozzarella, and freshly grated parm. I dolloped the sour cream in between 2 layers of everything else (ending with a full layer of cheese), covered and baked about 22 minutes, then uncovered until it was done the way we like it. Can't wait for the leftovers:) Thanks for the awesome idea!!

This was excellent!  The only thing I did differently was that I used shells instead of ziti (didn't have any ziti on hand!) and I added two cloves of minced garlic to the sauce.  I don't know what the people who said this was bland were talking about--this was great!  Definitely going in my recipe box!

This makes ALOT. And it tastes better the next day. I used Spaghetti sauce with green pepper. We loved it. Also be sure and layer as suggested. It does make a difference. Great Dish for a crowd.

YUMMY...complete comfort food!  I ended up cutting this recipe in half as I was just making for hubby and our 5 and 3 year old boys (the 5 month old can't eat it yet!!).  So, cut everything down, didn't realize I did not have ziti or even penne in the house, so used scoobi do pasta.  Decided to layer with 1/2 pasta, half sauce, provolone, sour cream, remaining pasta, remaining sauce and topped with mozz and fresh parm!  Covered and baked for about 35 mins and then uncovered for about 10.  Did not use a 9 x 13, but used a 2.5Q round dish.  Turned out great!

This is great! I've made it several times just for our family and for friends, and everyone always loves it.  It makes A LOT, and it just barely fits into a 9x13 dish.  I sometimes divide it into two 8x8's and freeze one for later.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe.  I actually originally tried it a year ago but not having sour cream on hand, had omitted that and was not wowed.  I tweaked the recipe and created a version that I preferred but that still did not have the sour cream.  After seeing it on a Top 20 list and reading the reviews, I thought I'd try it using the sour cream.  That was definitely the key - it adds a great zip to the flavours.  I can now say I am wowed.  Both my picky Hubby AND my finicky 2 1/2 year old gobbled it up.  The version I made though used my original alterations WITH the addition of the sour cream.  I added a few spices to the ground beef mixture - 3 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley, 2 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp grilled steak seasoning and 1 tsp mixed vegetable seasoning.  I also use double the mozzarella instead of provolone, grated marble cheese instead of parmesan and 26 oz tomato sauce and 13 oz spaghetti sauce (rather than 2 jars spag).  The only thing I would change the next time, would be to use light sour cream...the richness made me worry about calories!!

I was planning on making lasagna when I realized I had no lasagna noodles. I had all ingredients on hand and this was Perfect! I will probably make this instead of lasagna going forward, it is an easy and delicious alternative. Mix sauce with noodles BEFORE the layering process. Another tip is to use more sauce then called for. Naturally some of it will dry up even if it is covered. I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but it was delicious, it really made the cheese part of the dish creamy and cheesy. I added ricotta cheese AND fresh baby bella mushrooms. YUMMO!

This baked ziti always turns out great. If you don't have ziti on hand, almost any kind of pasta works. I often use rotini. I usually half the recipe because I have a small family, but I still add a full lb of ground beef. It still makes enough for lunch the next day. The leftovers taste even better!

This was just ok.....I thought since it had so many great review...it would be awesome!!  But there was nothing really special about it.  Followed recipe to the T and it's not one I'll keep.  It was lacking something and the sour cream was not good in it. Adding to this...I thought I would give this one a shot again I added less sour cream and replaced the ground beef with sausage and got rave reviews!!  Now it's a keeper!!  Sausage was the key!!  Without it, it's very bland.....

I made this recipe for a Freshman Football Pasta Party.  Keep in mind these kids have baked ziti every night before games which is about 15 weeks in a row.  I had kids coming up to me complimenting my Ziti.  Thats huge as I have never been a very good "Italian" cook.  The receipe was easy too. I did stir the sauce into the pasta before layering and this worked out well.  I used a double receipe and it was just enough to feed 40 kids right after a practice. I would make this again.

Be sure to COAT the pasta with the sauce and COVER it when baking. I used half ground beef and half ground sausage and loved the extra flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups sour cream and thought it still could have used a little more. GREAT recipe though!

Great recipe.  I halved the recipe since I was only feeding 3 people and baked it in a 10x7 dish.  It filled to the very top so I'd say it was enough for 6 people.  I followed the recipe exactly except I layered it: ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, as others did.  I used Classico tomato and basil spaghetti sauce.  Perfect.

Put the bottom layer of sauce directly on the noodles. Also, bake covered with foil or it will dry out and spray the foil with cooking spray. Excellent.

Made several modifications: (1)  Sauteed some minced garlic with the onions (2)  Added italian seasoning, salt, pepper, parmesan cheese to red sauce mixture (3) like alot of the other reviewers, changed the layer orders.  (1/2 ziti, sauce, sour cream mixture, provolone, repeat)  (4)  To me, baked ziti just isn't baked ziti without ricotta cheese.  So I mixed  in half ricotta and half sour cream.  In the end,  1.5 cups sour cream/cheese was not nearly enough for this dish.  Double that however, and you've got a great baked ziti dish!

This has been our ziti recipe for years.  I sought it out because of the ziti discussion on the Sopranos and was curious.  I have one thing to say to you ricotta people - there are other recipes with ricotta, go and make them.  This one has sour cream.  It is wonderful.

One of the most requested meals in my home.  I make this for most parties and everyone raves about it.  I use sweet Italian sausage in place of the ground beef.  I also add about 1/2 cup of ricotta.

Awesome.  I used a pack of italian sausage in the sauce, then added the sauce mixture to the pasta.  I also used 15oz ricotta + 8 oz sour cream instead of the amount of sour cream called for.  My boyfriend loved it, too.

My daughter gave it a 5, husband 3, son 4 and I gave it a 3 so we settled on a 4.  It was good and my kids enjoyed it and told me to make it again (16 and 12).  It is just not my favorite type of thing, but it was almost completly eaten so it must have been tastey! One more thing...I would use jar sauce to cut down on the work.  I made homemade sauce and it was a lot of work!

I made this ziti for a few of my friends last night for a hang-out/dinner night and it was a HUGE success.  I did follow the suggestions of other users and mix some of the sauce in with the ziti noodles before I put them in the pan (I actually poured about 1/3 of one of the jars of sauce into the pot after I drained the noodles - it just made life easier), and it turned out perfectly.  The recipe did almost over-fill my 9x13, so I put a cookie sheet underneath it when I placed it in the oven so that I didn't have a huge mess to clean later.  I probably will put some in another separate pan the next time I make it so that it doesn't overflow.  But other than that, it was an amazing recipe, and definitely a keeper.

Absolutely amazing Colleen, thanks for sharing! Had to leave out the onion as we didn't have any on hand, but it was a huge hit. Quick and easy, and it makes a lot. We still have some in our freezer...mm...good for quick dinner.

All five of us love this. The sour cream really changes the taste of the usual hamburger, pasta, & tomato sauce.

I make this often!  3 stars because I did not like this with sour cream AT ALL...normally I love sour cream on anything, it just was not the right flavor for baked ziti.  The sourness/tang of the sour cream makes it taste as if you used bad cheese (think spaghetti with sour cream in it) so I use ricotta instead and sometimes I use mild Italian sausage for the beef.  The first 5 or 6 times I mixed the pasta with sauce first and then layered, topping off with mozzerella and letting it get golden brown on top, but then I decided to make it the way it states in the recipe and I actually like it a lot better!  So from now on I will layer it the way the recipe states.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My daughter gave this 3 stars, but everyone else in the family gave it 4 stars. This is a very good, but very rich, dish.  The ingredients almost overflowed in my 9x13 inch pyrex baking dish, so I placed it on a foil lined cookie sheet to catch the "overflow" in the oven. I did as others suggested and covered while it cooked and put the sauce on the ziti before the cheese. This is an easy dish, but it took me longer than 20 minutes in prep time. I will do this one again.

Update 1/15/17: used 15 oz container of ricotta and beat in 1 egg in lieu of sour cream.  I liked the flavor better.
Tasty and easy, but lacked anything special - at least on the night we made it but found it tasted a lot better the next day!  Also, I used 2 bottles of sauce that were 24 oz each and thought it was still pretty saucy, but that also was better the next day.

Like most everyone, I was tentative about using the sour cream. This is a fantastic recipe!  My family loved loved loved it!  I have made it 4 more times and it turns out the same every time.  I layer it like the recipe calls for the only thing I did differently was put some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan.  Your pasta won't stick that way and it gives it good flavor (kinda like lasagna).  Use the good spaghetti sauce for this!  Thanks for sharing this!

I love easy recipes like this one!  I used low fat sour cream and it still turned out great!  I think I will even use a little less cheese next time to cut down on even more of the fat-it definately had plenty of cheese.

My hubby loves Italian food and wanted me to make baked ziti.  I found this recipe and I am so glad I did!  I used half ground beef and half hot Italian sausage, two jars of the Bertolli mushroom and garlic sauce, Sargento 6 cheese Italian shredded cheese, and added a few extra spices and fresh garlic.  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I mixed the pasta with the meat sauce before spreading it in the pan.  This makes way too much for a 9x13 dish.  I used a deep 4 quart baking dish.  I baked the ziti for 40 minutes and then took the foil off and baked it for another five minutes or so.  I know the sour cream sounds a little different, but don't leave it out.  It made the ziti so creamy.  Also, I would recommend using regular sour cream, not low fat.  This is a very rich dish and can't be a regular week day dinner, but will definitely go into the recipe book.  I am already looking forward to making it for my in laws.

This was delicious! Made this to keep in my Nana's refrigerator so she wouldn't have to cook and it made so much I was able to bring home a whole dish for my own family! I used ricotta cheese instead of provolone since that's what I had and in the future I may try to get the right cheese. Still good though. The only other thing I would recommend is mixing the sour cream and cheese thoroughly as mine seemed to be separated. The taste of sour cream grossed me out a little but no one else seemed to mind. I will be making this in the future for sure.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past 6 months!  Everyone raves to me how much they love this!!! It has to not only be the tastiest baked Ziti I've ever had in my life, but it is sooo easy to put together. I know the directions by heart now.  At first I thought it was weird that so much sour cream goes in it, but it only adds to the creamy cheesy flavor!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  I use MIDS Meatless sauce for this recipe and it is perfect!! I will definitly make this one again...and SOON!!!  I'd give it 100 stars if I could!

Sorry I am going to have to rate this a 3. My hubby who is Italian told me to never make it again, he did not like the sour cream in the dish and I really didn't like it either but we are use to real italian ziti, homemade sauce, ricotta cheese and mozzarella, It really didn't sit well in our stomachs after we ate it if you know what I mean.  My 2 daughters liked it but they pretty much like all kinds of Pasta.  If you are use to real Italian food I would suggest not making this dish.  I won't make this again or if I do I will not put the sour cream in it.  Thanks anyway

Perfect! I come from a big Italian family, so if this recipe replaced my grandmothers, you know it MUST be good. My family asks me to make this for every family function. So simple and yummy. The sour cream is the perfect creamy addition to this dish. I use my own homemade ground meat sauce for this one and use even more cheese than called for.

This recipe is close to my own recipe, except I've never used sour cream in my Baked Ziti before. With all the 5 star reviews, I thought I'd try it. After all, there's always room for improvement... right? Well, after being asked "why did you have to go and change your recipe"... a couple of times too many, I decided I'll stick to Ricotta. Thanks anyway.

This is fantastic! I've made this many times for the family, as well as having taken it to numerous potlucks..never a disappointment. This recipe allows for liberal additions of whatever one most enjoys. Extra cheese? Go for it. Additional sauce? No problem. The only exception I've found is in the sour cream. - too much and your dish can end up on the salty side. The only change I make is to omit the ground beef and replace it with ground Italian sausage. Paired with a nice ceasar and some crusty italian bread, this makes for a very happy belly indeed.

Oh!  So cheesy and goey.  Even my picky husband loved this one.  It really was a great pasta dish but if you don't like a lot of cheese it would not be for you!

FABULOUS if you follow exact.  I'll make this a million times over.  I also made this without the meat and it tasted like a bowl of spaghetti sauce and sour cream.   If not using meat dramatically decrease the amount of sour cream and sauce.

Sorry, but I'm one of the few who doesn't care for this too much. The rest of my family liked it but I thought there was just too much ziti and sauce & not enough cheese. I think it might be better scaled down w/ the mozzorela on top. If you're looking for something that feeds an army...this dish is for you. It makes a ton!!!

This recipe was fantastic...very easy and the end result seems like you slaved away for hours.  I used Italian sausage and added 3 cloves of fresh garlic as it was browning.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  And it warms up almost better than it was the first time around!

The ziti was okay, not spectacular, tasted better the next day!  Just like lasagna, however I expected something that standed out a little more.

This turned out great!  Easy to follow recipe.  I customized it a tad and used olive oil on the pan instead of butter, and used 1/2 pork sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  Really, really good stuff.

This was amazingly good. I hate store bought sauce, so I used the sauce recipe from "American Lasagna" recipe also on this website. It turned out really well!!! The sour cream is awesome; don't leave it out! It makes this recipe SO good!!!

Very good!   The only modification I made was to add one can of sauce to the pasta before layering.  

My husband and daughter were impressed with this dish and had seconds.  This is a great recipe to prepare ahead of time and then pop in the oven right before dinnertime.  I served this with salad, Focaccio bread, and a bottle of red wine for the adults.

I think the secret to this recipe is the sauce -- a bland sauce will make it mediocre at best.  The other ingredients don't add much taste.

I've made this receipe so many times and it never fails to impress. It's even better if you use ground Venison....delicious! Even the kids love it! I add about 1/4 cup red wine to the meat, 5 min before adding the sauce. This is my only baked ziti receipe I'll ever need!

This was the creamiest and dreamiest baked ziti I have ever made. In addition to the listed ingredients, I added 1 cup of Ricotta cheese, a pinch of sugar and 5 gloves of garlic (cooked within the meat sauce.) Of course I can imagine the recipe is incredible as is as well!!! A++

This was excellent! I substituted mozzarella for the provolone. I also assembled it ahead of time and refrigerated it, then baked it for 5-10 minutes longer the next day. Don't let the pasta sit too long before you assemble it, like I did, or it will stick together!

I've made this a few times and it just keeps getting better. For the meat I now use Italian sausage only, and add garlic and ricotta. Very Good.

This is a really easy recipe. That is part of the reason it has 5 stars. Everyone really liked it- and it makes a lot. I used smoked provolone instead of regular and added some italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to the beef and that was really good. You can't go wrong with this recipe. Great leftover too.

Ok, I gave this a whirl to see what sour cream (instead of ricotta) tastes like in baked ziti.  Not only is it creamier and less grainy, it also tastes like ricotta!  I subbed ground turkey for the beef, used low fat cheeses/sour cream and my own sauce with spectacular results.  Makes A LOT, too; I halved the recipe to 4 servings and there is still enough leftover for 2 hearty portions.  This has become a new family favorite.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  Easy to make, tastes wonderful.  I don't eat red meat so substituted lean ground chicken for the beef and it was fab.  I agree with others on perhaps using a slightly deeper dish - I used 48oz sauce instead of 52oz and it *just* fit... one little drip over in the oven, but I was forseeing a lot more than that given how full that pan was!  Such a simple recipe, but such great flavour, I'm not sure what exactly is the secret here, but this is a keeper.

This is awesome.  I mixed the sour cream with sauce and spread over pasta first.  My family loves it along with my co-workers.  I have even made this the night before then baked it the next day, the flavors blend even more.  Leftovers heat up great.  

4-8-06  Mixed ground beef with pork sausage.  Oh this was soooooooooo good.

I'm not usually a big fan of Baked Ziti, but I tried this recipe based on the reviews.  It was probably the best Baked Ziti I have ever had. I used two jars of Barilla Campagnola Roasted Garlic & Onion Sauce.

If I could give it six stars, I would.  Oh my gosh!  I happened upon this recipe one day while browsing around the allstar recipes and saved this one to my box.  So glad I did.  It was different than my regular baked ziti casserole and I thought I would give it whirl.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  All four kids loved it, hubby had 3 helpings and I went back for seconds myself!  Made exactly as stated except for throwing in a couple of cloves of garlic with the meat (couldn't help myself!) and used 8oz. of mozarella instead of 6oz since that is how my grocery store sells it.  We will trash our old ziti recipe and switch to this one.  At first, I thought the sour cream would be a wierd ingredient, but it added just the right kick.  This will become a staple at our house.  And the best part?  Easy, easy, easy and fast, fast, fast for a busy mom!

I made this for Christmas Eve, as a substitute for my lasagna.  It was fantastic.  Everyone loved it.  I used ricotta instead of the sour cream and used grated provolone and mozzarella.  I used 1 can Bravo sauce and 1 can Italian stewed plum tomatoes since we like the tomato pieces throughout our pasta sauce.  This makes a HUGE pan of pasta!  It completely filled a foil roast pan and fed 10 people!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  This one will be a regular at our house (just in smaller batches)

Great recipe.  Was a big hit with the relatives for Christmas Eve dinner.  I used classico four cheese pasta sauce and let it simmer along with ground turkery and some added seasonings.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a GREAT recipe! The sour cream was a nice new twist in the traditional flavor of baked ziti. I added some red pepper flakes and, like others, put the sauce on top of the ziti (instead of on top of the cheese) so that the ziti would be flavorful. I actually mixed the meat sauce with the ziti because I refrigerated it overnight before baking it the next day, and wanted the ziti to be lathered in the sauce rather than stick to each other. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, easy-to-prepare recipe. This should serve 8 good appetites (w/bread - or garlic bread - and a salad). Very creamy, great flavor. I used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded (I picked up the sliced provolone at the deli counter, so why not kill two birds...?). There was no discernible difference, and you may actually save some $$$ too. Leftovers weren't as tasty as it was fresh, but when it was fresh.....yum. Quick, delicious meal that tasted like the local Italian place down the corner. Worth it! (Don't forget to grease the pan, and undercook the ziti just a bit. It will continue cooking when you bake it to make it perfectly al dente). Thanks, Colleen!

This pasta dish is absolutely out of this world.  Make SURE to get a TRUSTED brand of pasta sauce.  We used Newmans Own.  Another thing we did that made this dish to die for was adding smoked sausage instead of ground beef!!  YUM YUM. My husband, brother and son gobbled it up and went on and on about how wonderful it was!  We used the Eckerich Lite smoked sausauge. WOW.  It adds a great flaveor.  Also, I added extra mozorella because it didn't seem like enough when i was making it.  YUM YUM.  I will make this over and over!!  TONS leftover!  Thank you for this great recipe!

We LOVE this recipe!  
I used hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef and added garlic to the onion.   
I used Ragu's Chunky Tomato, Garlic and Onion spaghetti sauce.  I prefer it's sweeter taste to the other saltier sauces.  
I also loved the idea of using a pasta with ridges to "hold" the sauce, so I used mostaccioli pasta.  
No matter how many times I've tried Ricotta, I end up with the same opinion...It's just not for me.  I do, however, love the sour cream.  Thanks for making it a part of your recipe Colleen.
Reading the reviews, I decided to layer the dish with pasta, meat sauce, provolone, sour cream, pasta, mozzarella, meat sauce, and Parmesan...and cover with aluminum foil.
BTW, we did try it following the original recipe, but prefer the changes made because it suits our family's tastes better.
Thanks for sharing Colleen!

The first time I made it just as the recipe called for, which was delicious.  We are ricotta cheese fans and I thought not using it would take away from the dish, but the sour cream was simply wonderful in this dish.  The second time I made it, I added a little over half a bag of thawed california mix frozen veggies to the sauce.  It was equally as yummy and just a change to add variety.  Will switch out and make veggie and veggieless.

Excellent, and so easy!  I don't recall seeing a sour cream layer when I order this at restaurants, so I mixed the sour cream in with the sauce (used fat-free sour cream).  Would definitely do that again, as it made the sauce rich and creamy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to update my review since last reviewing it a couple of years ago. I have made this over a dozen of times and it gets rave reviews to whoever I serve it to. It is just an excellent recipe. Everyone must try it. It's my husbands all time favorite dish. Use premium brands and the results are even better!!

Loved this! Heres the changes I made. I sauteed onions and garlic with olive oil and then added 1 pound ground turkey. After I added the sauce and simmered it, I let it cool and added the sour cream right into the sauce mixture. It turned it into almost a pink vodka looking sauce. I thought this was was easier then trying to spread the sour cream on a layer and it worked wonderfully! My whole family raves about this recipe! Excellent!

I made this for our housewarming party last weekend and it was gone in an hour!  Everyone loved it!  In fact, my family has requested that I make it again next weekend for easter!The only thing I changed was I did not add an onion to the sauce/meat mixture & I used more mozzerella in place of the provolone.  Awesome recipe - thanks!!

This was a lifesaver!  Snowed in - couldn't get to grocery store.  I had most of the ingreds at hand except I had to use chopped up chicken for the meat and asiago cheese instead of Provolone.  Turned out fantastic and my husband couldn't believe what a great dinner I was able to bring to the table!  Thanks.

Three words describe this ziti - "YUM, YUM, YUM"!  This recipe is great. I used ground pork instead of ground beef, and next time I will probably add some chopped garlic with the meat & chopped onion. The sour cream gives it a delicious, creamy texture.  This was just as good leftover, for lunch, the next day.

Great recipe.  I added mushrooms to the meat sauce.  Other than that, followed recipe as stated.  Pan was very full; I lined a large cookie s heet and put under the 9x13 pan and was glad I did.  Baked for 45 minutes covered w/foil, uncovered, and baked for 10 minutes more.  Was even better the next day when I served it with a green salad and my famous garlic bread.  Definitely a keeper.

This was excellent!  I was a little leery, as was my son, when I added the sour cream, but it was fabulous.  Just made the whole thing stay moist and creamy.  My whole family loved it!  A Definite keeper.  You must try this recipe!

I loved this dish! Changed it only slightly-- no provolone cheese, just did all mozzerella, but didn't make it really cheese-heavy. I used fat-free sour cream (only 16 oz. cos it seemed to be enough) At first I thought "I don't know if this is all going to fit in the dish!" but it did! We ate it for dinner and then leftovers for lunch the next day-- reheats in microwave fine! I also added some additional Italian seasoning and a dash or two of garlic powder.

Great, I added some chopped fresh parsley and basil to the simmering sauce.  I made a mixture of sour cream and ricotta cheese and added one egg, a sprinkle of dried italian seasoning and some garlic powder.  This is a great recipe, like a ziti lasagna, only easier.  Thank you

i made this a month ago, and used a mixture of sour cream and ricotta cheese.  also snuck in a pack of thourougly drained frozed spinach.  i omitted the provolone because i didnt have any on hand but made up for it with extra  mozzarella.  my boyfriend took this to work and shared with his sister, she later im'd me to tell me how good it was.

Pretty good, however... I modified the recipe to be lower calorie and fat.  The regular recipe is 696cal per serving!  So, I only used 1 cup of sour cream and I used the light version.  I only used 1/2 lb. of extra lean ground beef instead of a full pound.  The mozzerella I used was part-skim instead of regular.  Pretty darned good! I dont know how much lower the calories are but everything helps.  Good recipe.

This turned out terrific. The whole family of seven loved it. I halved the recipe, and it was still too much for an 8x8 pan. I ended up putting the rest in another casserole dish and freezing it for another dinner. (So the original quantities must make a ton!) I used rotini pasta since that was what I had on hand and that worked great. I can imagine you could use many different kinds of pastas. My daughter said she liked this better than lasagna. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is one recipe I will be making over and over. I halved the recipe and used ground turkey instead of beef and used light sour cream. I also made sure that the ziti was covered with the sauce so that it did not dry out while baking. I sprinkled the top with shredded parmesan instead of grated. We REALLY enjoyed this and it is super quick and easy to make.

I don't know if I can fairly rate this recipe since I made some changes to it but I think even the original would be delicious.  I cut the recipe in half to 4 servings which feed three adults for two nights and left some for freezing.  I also added cooked and sliced italian sausage links and some additional spices; minced garlic and italian mix to the sauce.  The end results was absolutely delicious and would make a great meal to serve for company.  I didn't want to make too many changes at once but next time I'll add sliced black olives and sauteed mushrooms.  P.S.  The sour cream sounded strange but added a delicious flavor.

I made this for my girlfriend to a rave review!

I made a couple of changes to the dish, including a very nice 4 cheese pasta sauce and swapped out the ground beef for ground turkey which I find to be a much leaner choice...

Serve with Red Wine for the perfect romantic dinner!

I made this for my husband, daughter and sister and we all LOVED it!  I did sort the suggestions by most helpful. After reading the suggestions, I mixed the pasta with the sauce and added generous minced garlic while browning the ground beef.  I loosely covered the dish with foil during cooking, except for the last 10 min. Other than that, no changes. My husband and daughter asked that I make this regularly, and I will.

This is so good and easy.  I used a little extra spag. sauce and had to put it in a little larger pan.  My kids don't like onion so I really minced them and they didn't even realize they were in there!  I also added a little minced garlic.  My whole family truly enjoyed this tasty dish.

Excellent as is and so easy!  Don't change anything until you try it as written first.  To address some of the other reviewers- don't use more provolone than called for and the sauce WILL get to the bottom layer.  Also, don't worry if you couldn't fit all the ingredients in and had to leave some sauce out- I thought it was too saucy anyway.  I'm going to reduce the amount of sauce next time.

This recipe is great.   I make it when I have a few days of work in a row and take it for leftovers.  Italian is always great the next few days!  The sour cream adds such a great taste to and and makes it creamy.  I add extra sauce.. the noodles tend to absorb much of it.

This was delicious!  I served it at Christmas and it was a hit.  I made a separate section without meat for my vegetarian sister and she thought it was great.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again.  I highly recommend it to anyone!

What a FANTASTIC recipe! I made this for me and my boyfriend and we both loved it! I did make a few adjustments after reading the other reviews: I cut the recipe in half (and we still had leftovers 2 days later!), used turkey instead of beef, and added some spinach between the middle pasta and meat layers. The sour cream adds great flavor; next time I want to experiment with low-fat sour cream and see if it offers the same effect.

it wa ok I made it with out the meat, I didn't like the sour cream in it this dish.  It kind of mixed with the sauce and made this weird orange pink color that did not look a appetizing at all.  I probably will not make this again but if I DO i will omitt the sour cream

Absolutely delicious!  My husband couldn't believe it when I told him there was sour cream in this recipe.  I used a light version of the sour cream and the ziti was still fabulous and extremely filling.

Fantastic!  I've made it several times, and it is never a disappointment.  One suggestion: Don't try to make this a lowfat recipe.  I try to do that with all recipes, but you really need the regular sour cream on this one.  The sour cream is what makes the flavor, and the lowfat takes something away.

Very Good!  Made this dish for a regular weekday meal.  Husband loved it, said he would put sliced Italian sausage in it.  Teenage girls(finicky eaters) kept coming back for more. Will definitely be making this often.  Thanks,  Nannie

This turned out very well.  We followed some of the other suggestions here and combined some ricotta with the sour cream.  The sour cream gave just the right amount of tanginess without being overbearing.  My only suggestion for improving this recipe would be to put some of the sauce in first, or at least over the noodles before the provolone and cheese mixture so that it can disperse throughout the noodles.  Otherwise, you end up with a very full pan at the end (we couldn't fit all of the sauce into the pan).

This is delicious. I halved the sour cream and added some ricotta cheese, plus some spinach for a little extra nutrition. My husband thinks it needs more spice, but I thought it was perfect. I might add some fresh chopped garlic for a little extra kick next time.

Excellent meal!  I also added a few cloves of fresh garlic to the meat while browning.  Easy to prepare...and feeds a crowd!  Wonderful taste.

I thought that this was very good.  It was very tasty.  I added in 2 garlic cloves to the onions and the sauce was much better.  I also added some parmesan cheese to it as well.  May suggest adding in mushrooms to the sauce.  I also added more chesse than stated and slightly more sour cream.  also added an extra layer of provolone.  Very good overall.

This was great.  I could not find Ziti pasta so I used another kind of pasta and it turned out fine. I reheated it the next day for lunch and it was even better as leftovers.  Thanks.

Thank you Colleen!  This is an excellent recipe!  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  I made two changes to the recipe as I made it...I used low-fat sour cream instead of regular and I sauted one and a half teaspoons of garlic in with the hamburger.  Gave it a very good flavor.  I would recommend this one to anybody who wants something quick and easy to whip up.  Thanks again!!

So easy and delicious!  We LOVED it!  I made it in two square baking dishes and made it exactly as written besides just using 16 oz. of sour cream (don't know how much that was!) and we ate one and took one to a family who had just had a baby.  Everyone really liked it.

What a good recipe!  The layer of sour cream in the middle really makes it great!  I would think, though, that you could use ricotta or cream cheese for that middle layer with outstanding results.  Very easy too.  We took the leftovers to our firehouse and the guys loved it!

I made this, but took the advice of others and used 1/2 sour cream (light) and 1/2 ricotta cheese.  My husband and daughter loved it -- I thought it was pretty good, but not my favorite.  It was a bit too bland for me, and I got a little tired of the sour cream taste (strange, since I love sour cream!).  Next time I think I'll make it with a spicier sauce and use a little less of the sour cream/cheese mixture.  It, also, made a lot -- 9x13 baking dish was filled!

I made this yesterday with great results.  I didn't have any ziti pasta left so I used the large (not jumbo) shells in their place. Also, I only used mozzerella cheese = 4oz per layer. Very good and easy!! The sour cream is the trick to keeping the overall recipe "creamy."  We ate until we were stuffed and there were still leftovers.  But, even the leftovers were tasty too. Would make this tasty ziti rendition again! Thanks Colleen!

This was easy, but tasted like I spent hours on it!  I only had mozzerella cheese and it was still delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

To those who say this was too dry, you had to have done something wrong.  I've made this literally dozens of times and it is amazing every time.  The recipe calls for TWO-26 oz. jars of spaghetti sauce.  My guess is these folks are only using one and in that case it would be dry.

I thought this was fabulous. My boyfriend asked me to make baked ziti and I gave this recipe a shot. The sour cream is the key ingredient. I don't care for ricotta cheese very much, and this made a delicious alternative. He loved it and also commented on the unique taste.

Easy and very good.  I used low fat sour cream to cut back on some of the calories since recipe is high in fat.  Next time would probably also use low-fat mozarella.

We love this recipe-- but cut down on the cheeses quite a bit--just enough to lightly cover each layer  Also, I use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta.
I've made it twice and substituted green pepper and/or mushroom for the meat.

Turns out tasty and delicious!

This recipe is not in the hall of fame for nothing.  Excellent baked ziti!  I was a little skeptical about the provolone and sour cream but one did not even realize it when the ziti was baked.  Also, this is a great recipe for people who do not like ricotta very much.

This recipe may just replace my lazagna recipe.  It is easier to make and tastes wonderful.  I mixed cottage cheese in with the sour cream to make it even cheesier.  Thanks Colleen for a dish I will make again and again.

When I saw all the reviews I knew this was the one to try, this is a great recipe! I used 1lb of Safeway mild Italian sausage casing removed and browned mixed with 1 jar of Barilla, Green and Black Olive Sauce, left out the onion(family preference) and covered with foil during baking. The flavor of the olives, tomatoes, capers, cheese, and sour cream were a delightful change from regular pasta. My family had seconds and thirds and I still had lots of leftovers, enough for another meal. If you don't have Ziti(I can't find it in my local grocery) try this with Rigatoni. I think one jars of sauce is enough but you will have to cover so it doesn't dry out. This is good leftover,  the kids are eating it cold out of the refrigerator.

I am a big All Recipes user, but I have never written a review.  My husband and sister-in-law absolutely loved this baked ziti. My husband took some of the leftovers to work and made everyone try it, now they want me to cook some up for them too!  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've made this ziti recipe a dozen times and every single time there's not
piece of pasta left in the pan.  And who cares about the fat and calories,
it's awesome and easy!

This ziti is creamy and cheesy - just the way we like it! I make this at least once a week since the first time a tried it about a year ago. Easier than lasagna and tastes even better.

OH WOW!!! 
This was the best tasting pasta dish I have made in a while. I have a daughter that won't eat any kind of pasta, but tonite she ate this and loved it. This was the first time in 5 years I have seen her eat pasta and clean her plate.
What an awesome dish!
We gave it a definite 51/2 stars!!

I made this last weekend for a party. Noone could stop talking about this recipe! So I have to make it today for another party. Great recipe. I made it just like the recipe stated and it was a big hit. Then the next time I made it I tweeked it a bit:  I used no meat. I used White American Slices and Monterey Jack Cheeses instead of Mozarella... YUMMY Very creamy and cheesy.....

I made this recipe tonight for family members gathering for my son's birthday - everyone really enjoyed it.  My 9x13 pan was packed almost to overflowing.  It seemed to take my oven a little longer than the 30 min. to heat through to where it was bubbly - the dish was dense and there was lots of it.

This recipe worked out great.  Next time I would use less cheese and sour cream, definitely less meat, and then add some veggies, and it would be perfect.  Thanks!

I have made Ziti in the past, but this is the BEST tasting ever!!!  My husband who is used to Ziti made by an Italian woman said this tops hers by far.  He hates sour cream, but I put it in anyway, but what he don't know wont hurt him--he didn't even taste it.  I didn't have Ziti noodles, so I used bow-tie pasta--which my daughter thought was pretty cool.  Thanks for sharing!

I had  never heard of ziti until I watched 'The Sopranos' so I came into Allrecipes looking for a recipe and found this one.  It is absolutely wonderful!!  I have given it to a few people who have also said, "What's ziti?" and they, too, thought it was great.

This was delicious. My boyfriend liked it even better then lasagna. I cut the recipe in half and used a 2 qt casserole dish. I used rotini pasta instead of ziti, and cheddar instead of provolone cheese. I will make this often. Thank you Colleen.

I thought this recipe was absolutely great.  My husband ate 2-3 helpings at dinner, brought it to work for lunch, and I had some the following evening.  Very, very good!  I changed it a little -- using almost a full package of pasta but half of all the other ingredients.  I also used rigatoni pasta and sweet Italian pork sausage.  It still turned out great.

I made this last night and had enough for an 8x8 pan as well as a 9x13, and both pans were full! I added lots of garlic salt and powder. Lots of food, plan on eating this for a few days. I'd make it again, but next time I think I'll add fresh basil and garlic.

Pretty good although not THE BEST pasta recipe I have ever had. My brother in law, who is a food connoisseur and a chef said, "I'd give it 7 1/2 or 8 stars out of 10. My husband said, "I might add a little more cheese to make it a little more...cheesy."

This is a great recipe for the guys!  I made it for my husband and two of his friends, and every bit of it was gone!  They absolutely loved it, and I even used 93/7 lean ground beef, reduced fat sour cream and light cheese!  One word of advice, though, would be to make sure you drain the pasta very well-- I don't think I did, and there was alot of liquid in the dish even after cooking.  Nevertheless, it was a smash hit, and I will defintely make it again!  Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times and it always wonderful! I usually substitute with low fat sour cream and mozzarella cheese and it turns out almost as good. It is so easy to make and worthy of any dinner party. Thanks for sharing!

This was a big hit.  The recipe makes a ton, but something this good makes leftover something to look forward to.

This is now a standard in our house.  I passed it on to other family members and they are so thankful for it.  Besides the great taste the other big plus is that it is easy to make.

I changed this recipe a little.  I used a combination of very lean ground beef and lean ground pork.  After frying that, I drained and rinsed it under cool water to get rid of some of the fat.  When making the first layer, I added grated mozzarella cheese on top of the layer of provolone cheese, but I forgot the sour cream!  When it was done, I added the sour cream (I used fat-free)on top of everything on individual plates, and it still turned out very well!  If I can mess this up this badly and it still is delicious, it surely is a keeper.

This was ok. I do not think I will make it again though. If I am going to go through more trouble than sauce, noodles, and cheese, I will make a lasagna. Otherwise, traditional baked ziti instead of this. It did taste good though.

Simply delicious and very easy to make.  The sour cream was a nice change. It does, however, take a little longer than 20 minutes to prepare.

I have made this recipe several times. The only thing I added was garlic.  My son who doesn't like pasta loves this. I have given the recipe to dozens of people who begged for it. This is the easiest and best recipe for a large group of people or if you like a lot of leftovers.

This was a really easy to do recipe.  Boy was I ever glad I halfed the recipe.  This makes a HUGE amount if you make it for 8 servings.  I made it for 4 and it filled up my 9 X 13 pan.  With just 2 of us theres enough leftovers for 2+ more meals!  =)  I think it needs more cheese though so I thing I'll add either ricotta next time or dry cottage cheese.

Have made this twice.  This recipe demands a lasagna pan!  The first time I didn't use one & had overflow.  The second time I bought the lasagna pan.  Everything fit easily.  I did subsitute all sour cream for sour cream & ricotta.  Also subbed ground beef for 1/2 beef / 1/2 italian sausage.  Very yummy & and big hit with guests.

I had this for dinner tonight... it was really good.  Maybe a bit on the cheesy side, but I think most folks like it that way.  I used a spaghetti sauce that had cloves of garlic and basil leaves in it, and that made it flavorful!  Thanks for sharing!  I did use the 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream, and will continue to use both of those.

Really enjoyed this.  Followed everyone's lead and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta cheese.  I mixed up the directions and layered it differently but it was really good just the same.  Was also a little runny.

Ok, WOW!!!!   What an easy and yummy dish!!  My picky husband called this dish "excellent."  Not to mention the five people who have walked by my desk so far saying. "What smells so good!"  I brought some leftovers into work with me.  I'm gonna make a batch for Superbowl!!  Thanks!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I have shared it with countless people, who all think it is terrific.  It is a lot like a lasagne, but it is SO tasty!
Make sure you buy good quality sauce, as this will make a huge difference in the final taste!

I loved this recipe!  I cut the sour cream by half and added half ricotta instead. Came out
very rich and creamy.  My whole family loved it and I will definately make it again!

Made this last evening.  WONDERFUL!  Fast, extremely tasty and a hit at home.  This morning my husband said "let's not cook tonite, let's reheat last night's leftovers."  Served with a salad and some red wine, perfect.  May not look "presentable" to some, but when has a ziti dish ever been?  Full of melting cheeses, aaah! I can't say enough.  Made exactly as recipe states, although I halved the recipe (for four) and still have leftovers.  I may add garlic next time. THANK YOU, Colleen, for sharing.

This was excellent!! I made this last week and my mom was over, she made a comment about how good it looked and I decided to invite my dad and her over to try it with us.  I was so nervous because I haven't really cooked much for them before, and it was the first time I had tried it. It was amazing, everyone loved it-even my very picky 20 month old gobbled it up and said "Yummy."  My mom asked for the recipe.  Thanks for helping me impress my parents, and my family! WE will make this again and again!

This was awesome!  I served it with Italian bread and a salad.  We all devoured it, even my soon to be 2 year old!  I added minced garlic to the meat while browning and I only used 1 and 1/2 jars of the sauce.  I also sprinkled mozzarella on top as well as the parmesan.  I sent some over to my husband's buddy and he called me to ask for more!  I will definitely be making this many times.

I never put my family in the 'picky pasta category', but we were really dissapointed with the flavor of this dish... The sour cream was VERY overwhelming.  It was ok tasting, but not as good as when I use cottage cheese or ricotta.  I won't make this again.  With the reviews I saw, I was sure this was a winner, but I guess not for my family.  Thanks for the experiment, thought!

I made this recipe for my husband, his parents, his grandmother and sister...it was a huge hit.  I really enjoyed the dish and had plenty of leftovers. After reading other reviews I followed some of the suggestions which worked great for me: the classico tomato and basil sauce, using garlic and italian seasonings while cooking the meat (which i used ground turkey), i was going to cover it with foil but forgot and it didn't dry out at all.  It was terrific and I've already suggested it to several friends.

I couldn't believe it when I saw how many ratings this recipe had; and they were all excellent!
I wasn't disappointed when I made it. This dish was absolutely incrediable!  Probably the best one dish pasta meal I've ever made. My husband just couldn't quit raving about it.  Can't wait to make it for company.

My family absolutely loved this. I am not a big fan of rigotta cheese, so the sour cream made a wonderful difference in this classic recipe. It's really creamy and wonderful as leftovers as well.

Served baked ziti last night for supper. It was quick and easy. My family of four loved it. My 13 year old son who is a very picky eater said it looks gross, but tastes great. My husband made me take it off the table so he wouldn't keep going back for more! Great job! Keep those recipes coming!!

This was easy and really good - my family loved it - husband and 3 kids.  I used one pound of meat - next time I will probably use two pounds.  Thanks!

This dish was very easy to make and came out delicious.  Although it was only a meal for two, had my boyfriend take it home for his family to enjoy, which they did.  Will make it again!!

Husband rants and raves about it; picky daughter ate it; son was not in a proper mood to enjoy it  :)
Will definitely make again (husband ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner, so leftovers didn't last long!)

Really tasty!  My husband says this is now one of his favorite things to eat.  I too was a little wary of the sour cream, but this dish was wonderful.  Leftovers (there was very little) tasted even better the next day.

WOW! Exactly the word my husband said between just about every bite.  I was worried about the sour cream, but trusted the reviews and am so glad I did.  This was really wonderful and will be fixed frequently in our house.

I made this last night for the first time and it was GREAT! My kids and my husband loved it! I have a 1 yr old and he ate as much as daddy. If that doesn't prove it's good I don't know what does. This will for sure be a keeper in our home! Thanks so much! :)

I've made this several times and it's always a favorite.  Sometimes I add mushrooms or fresh garlic to the sauce as well and it turns out great.  Yummy!

This was excellent.  Easy to make and excellent tasting.  I prepared the dish and waited about two hours before baking.  Still perfection.  I have two very picky children and they went back for thirds!!

I was sceptical about the sour cream in this recipe before I made it, but it turned out fantastic.  The sour cream looks like cottage cheese or ricotta when baked and adds to the dish.  My family loved the taste.  My husband things lasagna looks prettier, but this dish is about twice as fast to make.  I will definitely be making Baked Ziti again.

This is a delicous recipe for ziti.  One of the better ones I've found, anywhere.  I add a little garlic to it though.  Its easy to work with too.  You can add or omit whatever you like.  The first time I made it, I thought I needed more sauce.  So, the second time - I added a can of sauce to the recipe.  It came out wonderful.  This is a fantastic, cheesy, wonderful tasting ziti! Note: I was amazed that the sour cream looked just like ricotta cheese once cooked!

If you like pasta, definitely give this recipe a try.  It was extremely easy to prepare, and it made a lot of ziti.  I fed my boyfriend and his friends (who normally wipe me out of food), and I still have lots of leftovers.  They all loved it!  Reheats beautifully!

I only used one jar of sauce and I used smoked provolone. It was delicious, I agree with using a deeper casserole dish since 8x12 does not hold the entire meal

This is a really great recipe.  It is very easy to prepare, with ingredients you are likely to have lying around anyway.  You need a deep pan or at least a 9x13" casserole in order to fit everything into the pan.  If you spoon everything in carefully, it does all fit, even with the two jars of sauce.  I followed the recipe almost exactly - I did add a shake of garlic powder to the meat, however.  I used high quality spaghetti sauce and it was just wonderful.  10 Stars!

I was so excited about trying this because everyone was raving about it.  When I finally got the stuff to make it we were all so disappointed. I make something already that we liked beter and was much easier and cheaper to make.  Won't be saving this recipe.

I was skeptical at first that this recipe would be horrible since I am of Italian heritage and have never heard of Sour Cream being used in Baked Ziti.  However, this was the best Ziti I have EVER made, and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a GREAT Ziti dish.

I have made this baked ziti about 6 or 7 times and everyone loves it. I have had many requests from guests for the recipe. It makes a lot and tastes even better the next day. My daughter made it for her new boyfriend the other night and he thought she was just the best cook.

This was great when I had family in from out of town.  I had plenty for 4 adults and 2 children and every one loved it. It makes a ton of food, I used my lasanga pan and it worked perfect. My husband, who refuses to eat leftovers, was asking for more the next day. Thanks for this great recipe!

The taste is really good and the sour cream adds a nice zing. It does take awhile to get it all together and baked.

This recipe made a lot, I had half of the sauce and noodles left over.  I used sausage instead of hamburger, it was good.  Very similar to a Manocotti recipe that I make.

Great recipe!  It's fast and easy to make and freezes well.  Tastes almost like a lasagna but better!

My son is really a picky eater.  He really liked the baked Ziti.  He even told me it was great and he'd like it again!  I doubled the recipe and froze a tray for later when I am too busy to cook.

My "spaghetti and macaroni and cheese" only family loved it.  I like the fact it was easy to prepare and minimal "chopping" for me.  The flavors blend well and it is not watery.

I loved this!  I manipulated the recipe a bit.  We have a gourmet grocery store in town and I bought some really great sausage instead of round beef.  I also used some extra spices and eye balled the amount of cheese needed.  The spaghetti sauce I used was green pepper/mushroom and garlic/onion.  The sauce will make or break this meal! I thoroughly enjoyed this and will continue to make this dish for all occassions!

We loved this. I wouldn't tell young ones that there is sour cream in it, my kids kind of went"YUCK" but once they tried it, they liked it. This recipe went in to my recipe box the first time that I made it :o)

thisa was my first attempt at what i thought would be a complicated recipe, it wasnt! i was a little disapointed with the taste. i took the liberty of adding a healthly dose of garlic  :)  that did not completly satisfy this "italian food loving african american) the ease and quickness of preparing it impressed me! can be divided up and frozen(something i love) the taste left me wishing i was born italian:)    lisahi829

Aloha Colleen:

Just tried your Ziti, although.... ala vegetarian style, as my hubby is a vegetarians, and I must
say that it was EXCELLENT!  I added lots of garlic and some extra italian spices to the sauce to compensate for the
meat and that extra added "punch"  but all in all, that is a great recipe and I am looking forward to some
more of your recipes....thanx! and as we in Hawaii say the word for "delicious" is "ono"  very ONO INDEED!

Much Aloha to all !

This was the first recipe I tried from All Recipes and my family loved it. My sons are 22 & 23 - we always have a full house with their friends and every one loves this recipe. My son even makes it for Pot Luck at his work. Last time I made it one of the boy's took some home for his girlfriend. Now they all want to know when I am going to make it. Great Recipe!!

We are picky and this recipe is excellent!  I used penne instead and also added 2 cloves of garlic when I was browning the beef.  Next time I would freeze half.  Try this one!

Liked the recipe but ran into several problems.  First you need a larger than usuall pan for cooking the beef, because adding the spaghetti sauce takes up alot of space.  Second I used a 9x13 baking pan and it filled them up to the top.

Made this for the first time tonight as I needed a fast, easy, available ingredient recipe.  Didn't have provolone slices, so used 8 oz shredded Kraft italian cheese mix in place.  Probably easier to spread the sour cream over the provolone slices.  May use ricotta cheese next time as I make lasagna once a month and I like the flavor and texture.  But recipe good with sour cream as well per my unexpected guests.  Covered it for half the time, then uncovered last half.  Would make again.  Simple. Fast. Easy. Good.  Great for larger crowd or leftovers as needed.

I put it together the day before so the pasta got a little mushy. Next time, I will prepare the pasta and sauce separately the day before, then put everything together right before I bake it. I doctored the sauce up a little to suit my tastes. The flavor was good and I would make it again.

I wanted to comment so I could clarify a few things. When ever i make a receipe i prefer to follow it to the letter the first time around rather then making adjustments before I have tasted it.  I read many comments of people being up in arms about the sour cream/provolone combo. I can tell you it is very good. I loved it instead of ricota cheese because if i wanted to make a lasagna i would have.  It has great flavor and really it ends up with a ricotta cheese like consistancy anyway. Give it a taste and make it as instructed and see for your self before your edits. 
I did use aluminum to cover it which I won't do next time as it was quiet mosit and I had a bit of liquid at the bottom when i was done. 
Flowed to the letter the receipe is amazing. 
One thing I would note is this receipe does a good job of highlighting the pasta to that effect I would say this a good recipe for better noodles. I used cheap zitti so next time im gonna try some higher end pasta. And maybe sharp provolone. 
Your flavor and variety will be in your sauce. Ground beef and a well seasoned sauce is good. Subbing Italian  sausage for the ground beef is a real easy way to up the complexity and flavor of this dish.  
I made it a second time and I mixed the sauce and noodle layers because of the comments I read. This, in my opinion is unnesacerry and runs the risk of changing they way ingredients interact. Again I advise trying this receipe one time by following it to the later before making adjustments.

I made this for my grandson's 3rd birthday family party this past weekend.  Everyone raved about it.  My grandson couldn't get enough.  He ended up having 3 helpings.  I made it without the meat because it is Lent and most of the people there were Catholic.  I did the assembly a bit different.  I mixed the ziti, sauce, sour cream and mozzerella in a large bowl.  Then I put half the mixture in the baking pan and put 6 slices of provolone and some parmesan cheese.  I then put the rest of the ziti mixture on top and topped it with mozzerella.  It is much easier that way and all of the ziti is covered with the sauce mixture.  I also used the Kraft mozzerella with the cream cheese in it.  It melts so nicely.   This is going in my permanent collection.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great. I'm not Italian, nor am I a chef but this was very good to me and simple to make. I didn't use a glass baking dish and instead of two standard jars of sauce..I used the 45 ounce jar of Prego and it didn't turn out dry. I would also recommend using more mozzarella,  I love cheese and the second (top) layer could definitely use more. Honestly the way it came out it reminded me of lasagna.  Thanks for sharing, i will definitely make again.

Favorite recipe for 10 years now. Everyone that has ever tasted this baked ziti absolutely loves it!  I don’t care if it’s not “true Italian” baked ziti. I substituted ricotta for the sour cream once and was NOT pleased with the results. I go for taste rather than heritage. I wouldn’t usually mention that from another’s review but this recipe is dear to me -as is - and it’s definitely a hit!!  Over the years the only modification I’ve made at times is adding some ground sausage to kick up the flavor.

Very very good! I did use 2lbs of meat instead of 1 and it was delicious. My kids even went back for seconds. It was cheesy and the sour cream gave it an extra boost. My mom was going to pass due to the sour cream and I got her to try it anyways and she went back for seconds. Defiantly worth a try!!!

I made this for supper last week & even my picky eaters loved it! I did cook the onions a little longer & next time will add them before the beef to brown. I also used more mozzarella cheese than called for. I almost doubled the mozzarella! This is the absolute best Ziti I've ever made! And I did cover it with aluminum foil while baking.

Excellent! I, too, was dubious about the sour cream and provolone, but decided to trust such a highly-rated recipes and did it as written. The only change was not using meat (which was suggested in the recipe itself). I sautéed about 8 ounces sliced mushrooms with the onions and then simmered the sauce. I also added a dash of red pepper flake, since we like our pasta sauce a bit zippier. Added additional dollop of sauce to coat the bottom of the pan.

I substituted the provolone for extra mozzarella, and used only half an onion. I recommend using extra cheese. I made this dish at age twelve and it was not too difficult- plus it was a big hit!

As advertised. I made the vegetarian version and it disappeared faster than I could get the camera! Thanks to a review I prepared to make a smaller version w the excess. 
I will make recipe again but next time I will play. The two things I like best are: 1) it is very easy to make  & acts as a great base to experiment 

Thanks!

I added a half cup of the pasta water to the sauce and added some Italian seasoning to the sauce mixture and it turned out fantastic!! I forgot to cover it but it wasn’t even remotely dry. If you use enough of the sauce mixture for the top layer, it’ll be fine uncovered. It is a thick pasta so make sure you use a deep enough baking dish.

I haven't actually made this dinner for my family. This is a recipe I go to when someone has a baby, or is injured. A dinner to put together for someone who just need to not worry about dinner, something they can freeze for when they're ready. And I ALWAYS get compliments on the dinner itself! Sometimes I even get requests for more! :)

we really love this recipe, and by we, I mean four of the six people in my house. I was a bit hesitant to use sour cream, but I'm not a big ricotta fan, so I figured we'd give it a go. Super easy to make and most of the house loves it, so thats a win in my book. The only change I make is making it ahead of time and pop it into fridge until ready to cook, and split it into two 8x8 pans. Be aware that this makes a lot of food, so your baking dish will be heaping, not level. Also make sure you use a spagetti sauce that has a lot of flavor, since thats were most of the taste of this dish will come from.

Continuation of previous review. Apparently the review will not format paragraphs. So, important points: 1) integral to the success of this recipe is to cook the ziti until just barely al dente. That allows it to cook the rest of the way in the oven with the ziti remaining firm. 2) DO NOT use ricotta. I think the provolone/sour cream mixture is inspired. If the texture bothers you, use provolone and 4% cottage cheese.  Today I used a mixture of sour cream and cottage cheese as I had cottage cheese that was reaching its expiration date. 3) I make my own sauce, basically using the recipe for the sauce used in worlds best lasagna.....a recipe on this site. I use Italian sausage and ground chuck. Today I chopped up 2 green peppers, 3 onions, minced 9 cloves of garlic. I sautéed that with the meat, chili pepper flakes, oregano, basil, etc.  I used some red wine and fennel seeds in the sauce. If I’m making several pans, I make the sauce a day ahead just to cut down on the work. 4) as far as baking it covered....it just depends on how much sauce I have in the pan. Today I did not cover it (8x8 pan) as I wanted some of the sauce to evaporate. It was perfect. But for a big pan, I’d cover it.   5) I’ve layered it all different ways...it’s always good as long as the ziti is al dente.  6) I’ve always had rave reviews for this recipe. It freezes great.  It’s worth the effort to have a nice meal waiting in the freezer.

It's shocking how delicious this was. As someone who speaks italian and has a plethora of family recipes- this puts ricotta baked ziti to shame and I will NEVER go back. Followed the recipe except I did a splash of gravy in the bottom of the tray first and had to use a little more than required and it turned out perfect. But, as with all italian food, what makes or breaks it is the quality of gravy.

This was absolutely delicious and I stuck to the original recipe. My boyfriend raced about it so I made it again for him.My son loved it too. Perfect for a cold night with a salad on the side.

Obviously a very simple recipe, but it was well received. We substituted ziti noodles for rigatoni without problem. Like many others have said, I found the cheese on top to get very brown and nearly burnt - if you don't like it so crispy, you may want to cover the dish or add more cheese on top.

Very good! I made some adjustments to mine. These included:
          Using ground Italian sausage,
           Red Cabernet Sauvignon wine,
           Garlic,
           Italian mix cheese and chedder cheese.
I cooked the Italian sausage with the onion and garlic and added salt and pepper. After adding the Tony Newman's sockarooni sauce I added two cap fulls of Cabernet Sauvignon red wine. Think I'll do another cap full next time. I let it simmer for the 15 min then stirred in some sour cream. I didn't measure it. Just did to taste. Layered it and I had not problem fitting it all into a 9x13 pan, but I did take time to put the noodles in line. Layered it, covered to bake and was yummy!

My favorite ziti ever. I often make it for a neighbor or friend  who needs a meal- quick and easy (i doubled it and made 3 square pans- one for our dinner and 2 to share!)  Also easy for them to freeze for a later meal.  I always get great feedback. 
It's not dry like a ziti sometimes is. The sour cream is a great addition!

I made the recipe as is, and it turned out awesome. My family loved how cheesy it was, and the sour cream really put the cherry on top. I used Bertolli's Five Cheese for my spaghetti sauce and it was delicious. I'm sure I'll end up making this every other week.

2/18/17: This was my first time making baked ziti.  I used 2 jars of Newman's tomato and basil (24 oz each) and added a small jar of spaghetti sauce (which wasn't really needed).  I did 1# pound beef and half a tube of italian sausage.  I added some garlic. I combined 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup ricotta.  I used the entire 8 oz package of provolone slices and the entire 8 oz package of shredded mozzarella.  Combine the meat and pasta. I used a 9x12 disposable pan and an 8x8 glass dish but should have stuck with a 9x13 size.  let it rest 10 minutes before cutting.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it for a dinner party for our friends and my husband co-workers. Everyone loved it and there was nothing left for anyone to take home. I used Ragu Meat Combination Italian sausage and 3 cheese, made a Caesar salad, and warmed some Kings Hawaiian rolls. I will definitely be making this meal again.

This is a winning recipe that I will definitely be making often at my house! I made a few changes- First, I used penne pasta instead of ziti (I couldn't find ziti at the store). I am a huge fan of eggplant, so I baked a large eggplant in the oven for an hour, and then diced it and added it to my meat mixture. The eggplant added a lot of flavor and texture. Yum! Also, I did the layering a little differently; On the bottom layer I mixed the pasta with my meat mixture, just to make sure that the pasta didn't dry out. I then spread on a layer of sour cream, then  covered with sliced provolone and shredded mozzarella. Then for the top layer I spread on the pasta, the remaining meat mixture and topped with shredded mozzarella  and shredded three-cheese mix. It turned out amazing!!!

I love you contributors!!! I made this recipe last night.  The first time I tried Ziti there was no meat. I also dropped the sour Creme in favour of Ricotta cheese. Mixed the Parmesan cheese  in with the Ricotta cheese (which I added an egg to thanks Contributors!!!!!). I added a cup of chopped spinach to that mix. What a hit!

I have made this in the past, but forgot how excellent it is. Made it tonight with Hempler's hot Italian sausage instead of beef. Used Rao's Four Cheese Sauce. My husband never likes red sauce and he went back for seconds. Delish!!!

This recipe was a hit! My husband, 9 year old daughter, & my husbands coworkers raved about this!! I followed the recipe, with only a few minor changes. I used tomato & basil pasta sauce (I used a few ounces more than the recipe called for). I added a tsp of sugar, garlic powder & red pepper flakes to the sauce. I also mixed the cooked noodles with the sauce, as recommended by other reviewers. I used more cheese than called for because we LOVE cheese. I considered substituting ricotta for the sour cream & provolone, but after trying it, I'm so happy that I didn't. The sour cream adds moisture & the provolone gave this dish an amazing flavor. I covered & baked for 25 minutes. It was phenomenal!!

I have made this recipe for years now as my go-to "feed an army" meal. I'm about to make it again this weekend for our Labor Day family reunion "up north." I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of mixing the sauce with the ziti and it is perfection! This is now a Labor Day tradition in our family and everyone thinks I'm a great cook! Even doubling the recipe, no flavor gets lost and the subtleties of the provolone still come through. And the best part is I can assemble it at home and bring it to our cabin ready to bake. Easy! Don't hesitate to try this. You won't be disappointed!

This was perfect! Although some of my layers were out of order (my mistake), it still turned out to be DELICIOUS. I plan to try this again (more cautiously) to "master" it...or maybe I am just wanting to try it again....to take another bite :) My family asked for "seconds" three times times, so thank you for this recipe!

This was a really nice surprise.  It was simple to put together and really tasty.  Based on other reviews, I added a pound of sweet Italian sausage, and it just put it straight over the top!   My husband is not an Italian food lover, and he is crazy about this one.   It also freezes well.  Thanks for a great recipe, Colleen!

This recipe needed some changes. Definitely swap the sour cream for ricotta! I also ditched the provolone in favor of thick slices of mozzarella--it added an excellent touch. I also changed this to be vegetarian and swapped the meat for Crimini mushrooms browned and simmered in black truffle oil with onions. I use one can of vodka pasta sauce and one can of garlic and herb pasta sauce. I season with Herbs de Provence and garlic. The result? A much more authentic, creamy, fulfilling dish that is a huuuuuge hit for any dinner party! People go nuts for the notes of truffle and herb seasoning. Even my friends who say they don't like mushrooms love this dish. Easy and quick to make!

To make it a little healthier, try using Greek Yogurt as a substitution for Sour Cream! Much less calories and fat! When cooked it tastes essentially the same! :)

Excellent starting point. I used italian sausage instead of ground beef, which I browned with the onion and two cloves of garlic. I used one jar of spaghetti sauce and one 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes. I Added extra italian seasoning, a dash of crushed red pepper, a handful of sliced mushrooms and red bell pepper. I mixed the 1 1/2 cups of sour cream withan equal amount of ricotta.  Finally, instead of making the pasta and sauce as separate layers, I mixed the two together. Then I layered pasta/sauce, then ricotta, then mozzarella, then provolone. Repeated the layers and topped with parmesan. My family LOVED it. It's even better the second day!

This is a big hit at our house! Sometimes we will add mushrooms and more mozzarella cheese at the top! So far both sides of the family ask for this.

I love this recipe!!!!! I have made it 3 times since I found it, and each time it tasted even better!!! I usually make a romaine salad and asparagus. A few tips are instead of sour cream, use ricotta cheese. This is just if you want the more Italian version.  Also, if you want it to be more Italian, then don't use the provolone cheese. You could substitute it for more mozzarella, or just pour the sauce mixture on the pasta without any cheese in between ;)  All in all this is a great baked ziti recipe!!!!!

I've made this several times and it is always yummy! First time exactly as printed. Next time I will mix more of the sour cream with the ziti to moisten them a bit.   Still good regardless and quick, too!

Came out great!  I made as directed except for using sweet Italian sausage (taken out of the casing) and I mistakenly only used half of the sour cream because I was thinking the second half went on the next layer.  Oh and I used light sour cream.  Family and guests loved it!

I've made this several times.  Sometimes I do exactly as written and sometimes I change it up a bit.  My changes-- 1# Italian sausage casings removed instead of ground beef.  1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream.  Add about 1/3 c red wine to the sauce.   Either way, this is a great baked ziti.

I made this for dinner tonight and my fiancé and I absolutely loved it! I did add ricotta cheese just because we both love ricotta cheese in pasta. I tossed the cooked pasta in sour cream, and layered ricotta on the provolone. I will definitely be making it again.

Very tasty. The sour cream gives it a eat creamy taste. As far as spaghetti sauce, I used Newman's Own Marinara sauce and instead of the provolone cheese, I used an Italian 4 cheese blend which includes provolone, mozzarella, parmesan and asiago romano. Came out perfect. Thanks.

I really enjoyed the idea of the cheeses instead of ricotta - I added green peppers and mushrooms to the sauce mixture and instead of ziti, I used fusili.  This way, I knew that everything would be coated!  Next time, I think I will also try the Italian sausage.  A 4-star recipe, but would be a 5-star if using other ingredients like mushrooms, peppers (even broccoli) ...diced tomatoes would add more of a 'chunk' too!  A huge hit!

This was great. I put a thin layer of sauce in the bottom to prevent sticking and then assembled the rest as instructed. I baked it covered so it didn't dry out. It turned out great. The only change I made was to add a little chopped garlic in with the onion for extra flavor. 

If I made this again I would use half ground beef and half Italian sausage for depth of flavor. I'd also add some extra fresh or dried herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary) to the sauce and let it simmer to add another layer of flavor.

The layering of the noodles, sauce, and sour cream combo was great.  I might use a little less sour cream next time (only per personal preference)

Very tasty recipe! I made no changes to the original recipe and it came out amazing! I love how the recipe incorporates sour cream. Make sure you cover your ziti when baking. This recipe is so good it has replaced my favorite Lasagna recipe. My husband loves it too!

I loved this recipe.  I did make some changes. I used rotini pasta (that's what I had on hand), I used vegetables instead of meat. I sautéed onion, zucchini, and red bell pepper with some minced garlic. I used an organic spaghetti sauce. I mixed the pasta, sauce and veggtables together and put half the mixture in the pan, topped it with the provolone cheese and sour cream then topped that layer with  the rest of the pasta mixture and Added the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Covered and baked for about 30 min at 325. Very easy recipe! Oh, did I mention it was delicious =)

Made this recipe and it turned out pretty well. The only differences in mine were the use of ministrone noodles instead of ziti (my local supermarket didn't have any ziti, and ministrone worked pretty well), and the use of italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef. I also only cooked it for 15 minutes, and the cheese had no probable melting in that time. Would reccomend this recipe.

Excellent recipe! I was hesitant to use the sour cream because I've always used ricotta but it was a wonderful choice (cheaper and easier to get than ricotta too) and gave the dish a bit of a tang.  I did not have any provolone but everything else was made as written. It was delicious and very easy.

This is my first time making baked ziti (layered pasta dishes intimidate me), and I am SO GLAD I chose this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and it is amazing!!! My only issue, and it's my fault not the recipe, is it came out a little watery because I forgot to drain the beef before adding the sauce. Other than that it was deliciously cheesy and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again!

This is my favorite go to recipe.  Italian?  Go ahead, I dare you to make it and serve it up to your family. I certainly did and no one knew it wasn't ricotta.  It's quicker and easier.  It's a great potluck recipe too.  I use grated and shaved Parmesan on it.  Also, I have never cooked this covered- not once- and mine has never dried out.  I agree, this one is Hall-of-Fame worthy!!

Nothing amazing but you won't hear any complaints around the table either. Gives plenty of leftovers too, so if you make this give yourself a break later in the week and heat it back up. One thing though, cover it when it's in the oven or it will dry up a lot.

Delicious and so simple.  Used 1 cup of ricotta w egg.  Mixed in 1/2 cup sour cream w 1/4 cup grated parm.  Mixed all of the pasta with the red sauce as suggested. Baked covered for 30 min so it doesn't dry out.

Not very flavourful and too dry. I would make it again and add herbs, cover with foil the whole time and add more tomato sauce.

Like all recipes on this website, I read the reviews before I dive in because I always get great tips about the recipe. This one is no different. I took the advice about cutting the recipe in half. It's just the two of us....even that was a tad much, but I blame myself. When the recipe was cut in half, the measuring amounts became odd numbers so I just rounded up to the next whole number. I didn't want to waste ingredients. I also made some substitutions based on recommendations from other reviewers to make it healthier. I changed the sour cream to plain greek yogurt. One reviewer missed the ricotta cheese so I just took my measurement of the sour cream made a mixture that was 2/3 plain greek yogurt and 1/3 reduced fat ricotta cheese. I used ground turkey instead of lean ground beef. I used reduced fat provolone slices and mozzarella cheese. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and got some quality spaghetti sauce. I was too lazy to buy additional vegetables to add to the meat sauce but that is something that you can do. I used rigatoni instead of ziti and that worked perfectly.
I followed the recipe instructions in regards to how to prepare the ziti. Quite a few of the reviewers suggested to mix the meat mixture with the noodles before you layer. I did and that was perfect. I layered in corning ware and put the lid on and put it in the oven. It came out perfect. It was lasagna with rigatoni. My boyfriend had two servings. I will make this again in a heartbeat.

This ziti is my favorite dinner in the world. My fiancée'a favorite dinner as well. I don't even like ground beef, or sauce, but wow do I love this ziti. The only change I made was, instead of sour cream, I usually toss the ziti in ricotta cheese (mixed with a bit of fresh chopped parsley and an egg). I've tried this recipe with sour cream as well though and I loved that too.  Five stars, thank you so much for sharing this, we can't get enough of it in my house!!! GREAT  for leftovers as well!

Although ricotta sounds more appealing, I made it with everything as is. Except I covered my dish with foil so it wouldn't dry out. It was delicious! Ps 175 Celsius is about 350 Fahrenheit.

Delicious!  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the ground beef and seasoned with a little salt and pepper.  I followed other reviews and mixed 1/2 the sauce mix to the bottom layer ziti before putting it in the pan.  This kept the pasta nice and moist.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly!  I thought the sour cream added a nice, smooth touch to the dish (unlike ricotta which can get a little dry).  Yum! Great dish for a crowd!

My first time trying this meal was decent! I substituted ground beef with ground turkey. I used 1.5 jars of spaghetti sauce: garlic sauce & four cheese sauce. I also only used mozerella cheese and cheddar cheese. All was shredded. I cook my meat thoroughly and seasoned it with season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, black pepper, plenty of Italian seasoning. Meal took about 1 hour total. Would I make it again? OF COURSE! My family (2hungry boys) loved it!!!!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe although I made some changes to original recipe. Only used 1 jar of tomato sauce, used mozzarella cheese instead of provolone, and ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. It came out amazing!

Really delicious, hearty, and easy to make. Halved the onion (a whole onion just seemed like way too much) and as many reviews suggested, covered it when baking in the oven. Will totally make this again.

Rich and melty - so delicious!  I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian sausage and it gave it a nice spicy kick.  Thanks this recipe is delicious!

Loved the recipe. Added Worcestershire sauce , brown sugar and crushed red pepper to the spaghetti sauce. Next time will reduce the sour cream and cheese by half.    Sweetie thought ricotta would be better.  We will try it and see!  Thanks it was great.

It is a good recipe but I omitted so much, it would not be fair to give five stars the actual recipe. I took out the provolone cheese and sour cream and I only had a pinch of Parmesan cheese. I used three cheese blend from Wholefoods instead. The entire family enjoyed greatly, even my 18 month daughter asked for thirds! Oh! And we will have leftovers, which is rear for this family of 8!

I made this dish recently for a small dinner party I hosted.  I followed other suggestions about layering and using a bigger pan.  My dinner party guests really liked it, and were going back for seconds and third helpings!   

However, I blundered a bit so I'm sharing my experience so others won't make the same goofs!

I made it the day before, and cooked it for 15 minutes then put it in the fridge.  I figured I could stick it in the oven with another dish I was making the day of the party, and finish cooking it.  I didn't want to fully cook the dish the day before, then re-heat it because I thought it might dry it out.  So day of the party I cooked it for another 30 minutes at 350 degrees, but it wasn't long enough!  The layer of provolone never melted, which wasn't apparent until I was serving the dish and I was digging into my own portion.  

I don't know if anyone even noticed, but I was a little embarrassed!  

So, if I were to do it again, I'd probably either cook it completely the day before then reheat it, or just leave it in the oven for about 45 minutes the day of the shindig if I didn't cook it fully the day before.    I'd also use a different spaghetti sauce.  (For the record, I used sauce from Trader Joe's and I didn't care for it.  One of my guests mentioned it seemed too acidic.)

I only have one word for you-AMAZING! Every single person who tried this came up to me asking for the recipe (those who knew I cooked it, that is--others thought I had it brought in from a restaurant!)
A few notes:
1. I had to omit the meat since my crowd wasn't a meat eating crowd, but I still browned the onion for about five minutes and simmered the onion with the sauce for about ten minutes in a skillet. You DEFINITELY need two jars of sauce, if you are thinking its too much--it's not.
2. I used Bertoli Tomato and Basil canned sauce.
3. I read all the reviews before cooking this and followed the recommendation to layer it a bit differently.  Instead of leaving the bottom layer of ziti "un-sauced", I mixed the bottom layer of ziti with 1/3 the sauce before then layering the provolone and the sour cream.  I then mixed the next layer of ziti with 1/3 of the sauce, followed by the mozerella mixed with the remaining 1/3 of sauce and the parmesan cheese. I covered it, baked it at 350 degrees for exactly thirty minutes, and VOILA! Instant masterpiece!!!

I am so glad that allrecipes.com gives users like me a chance to read reviews for tips and tricks---the layering was genius! I will be bringing this to work from now on. Thanks!

This is a very very good recipe.  The sour cream really brings it together.  The only change I made was to put a bit of mozzarella on top and under the broiler for a toasted top.

This was scrumptious! I made it almost exactly like the recipe, except I used ground turkey, fresh sliced mozzarella, added garlic, and layered it differently. My husband loved it and couldn't get enough! I was actually out of foil at the time so I was not able to cover it while it baked, but I just made sure to add enough sauce to the top to keep it from drying out and that worked perfectly. Will definitely be making this again!

Outstanding.  I needed a little more time in the oven to get everything melted together, and I still didn't get the sour cream completely melted, but it didn't matter as it still tasted great.  Thanks very much!

This is awesome and simple.  I added Italian seasoning, onion power and two cloves of minced garlic to the beef when I was browning it.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Of course, I covered the dish while baking, too.  This is a great, hearty meal!!

I have made this numerous times. The first time was made exactly like the recipe, the second time I added more cheeses. I added Monterey Jack, cream cheese, and ricotta cheese. I also grated 4 cloves of garlic and added it to the ground beef and Italian sausage. This was such a hit with everyone that has eaten it. My picky 2 year old even ate it. Thanks!!!

The only change I made to this recipe was to use sliced mushrooms instead of hamburger to make it vegetarian. For reference I used Prego Traditional as my sauce. The finished product did not have a "baked" consistency. It seemed like regular pasta with sauce dumped right on top - A LOT of sauce. It tasted like something I could have made in a lot less time. I think the sour cream and provolone worked well enough flavor-wise. However, I believe this dish would have been much better had everything been incorporated evenly, rather than layering the ingredients.

This was really yummy! This was a quick and satisfying meal. Instead of layering, it was quicker for me to mix all ingredients, put in a greased baking dish and top with mozzarella  and parmesan.  I also used sausage and ground beef. Like other reviewers recommended, bake covered.

This is wonderful, I added salt and pepper because I tasted it halfway through and it was a tad bland.  There's no sour cream where I life so I HAD to use creme fraiche, it was very tasty.

Lovely! I used pasta sauce with Asiago and parm and instead of ground beef I used Italian sausage along with the rest of the recipe. Freaking amazing. I didn't know it was like a lasagna.

I'm always alter recipes to my liking and add or take away things. Instead of Sour Cream I used Ricotta Cheese and mixed it with a 1/2 cup of Provolone, Asiago, and Parmesan Cheese. I also used mild Italian Sausage instead of plain beef.  I used tomatoes sauce and added my own spices but I did use about 42oz of it. I also used onions and mushrooms. I mixed about 1 lb. of mozzarella cheese in my sauce after I sautéed my veggies and I also added my meat and drained the grease off. Oh almost forgot, I beat a egg then I add it to the Ricotta mixture and blend well. I know that I alter the recipe a bunch but overall it's a good recipe, I always make a dish my own.

The recipe as written is beyond five stars, but it doesn't hurt to add a little garlic and oregano.  I've made this dozens of times and my family LOVES it.  It is also my go-to dish for potlucks or taking to families who've just had a baby.  The leftovers are even better!

This was amazing! For the most part I followed what the recipe called for. I did substitute the beef for Italian sausage and added garlic when browning the sausage and onion. I also mixed the noodles in with the meat sauce before putting the mixture in the pan. Definitely load up on the mozzarella and Parmesan! Also, cover the pan before cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

I have made and shared this recipe with so many friends and everyone loves it!  Like some others I layered it differently... I split the provolone into two layers. Does anyone know if this one is okay to freeze for later use?

I made this for a potluck and it was really popular! The whole dish was gone quickly. There were a few things that I did differently based on reviews that I read. I layered the sauce on top of the noodles instead of layering noodles, provolone then sauce. I covered it while baking to avoid drying out. I also used rigatoni pasta instead of ziti as that is what I had on hand. I used Classico for the sauce. I was happy with it and will make again.

Tasty and easy dish to prepare. I had some homemade meat sauce and wanted to serve it with something other than just plain noodles. This was the perfect dish. Instead of mozza and provolone, I used sliced Havarti as it was the only thing on hand. Great reviews at home. I'll serve this again for sure.

This was fantastic. I did not change any ingredients other than the order I put them in the pan. I put the sauce on top of noodles. I also added some minced garlic. This was so good. I have passed it on to mother in law and typically she is the one passing recipes to me. Thank you!!!

There are very few recipes that I find that I don't feel the need to tweak and this is one of them!  Even my kids LOVE this meal.   It does make a ton and is good leftover as well.
Sometimes to get vegetables in my kids I will blend up carrots/onion/celery and garlic and fold it into the sauce - they no idea;)

I really liked this recipe as I don't care a whole lot for ricotta cheese, making it with sour cream was a change that turned out to be delicious!  I used ground sausage instead of ground beef and I mixed the sauce in with the noodles as per others comments.  I kept everything else the same as the recipe and covered it for 20 minutes and then uncovered for the last 10.  Everyone loved it and will make again!

This recipe was great!! I've been making it with my dad for about 2 years and it turns out great every time. Its all in the sauce you choose though. I've baked it uncovered and it still turns out fine.

I stumbled upon this a bit ago and loved it!!! I read a review of real italian version... Well, as any italian knows it's not the way to make it italian- however, it's a great spin on something different! Half my ITALIAN FAMILY DOESNT LIKE ricotta so this was a great alternative. My entire family loves it even those who like ricotta. Don't make changes keep it the way it is. Only thing I do different is I don't buy pre made jar sauce. I make my own. Happy eating.!!

This was my first time making baked ziti and my fiancé and I loved it! However,  I did tweak it a bit. I sautéed 2 minced garlic cloves with the onion and added a pinch of parsley to the top before putting it in the oven. Although, It didn't say to cover with foil or not. I decided to cover it. I didn't have that problem with it coming out dry so I definitely recommend to cover with foil.

I love this but modify the recipe above significantly. You can really ruin this as long as you have enough sauce so customize it for your family's tastes.  I sauté 1lb hamburger, 1lb ground sausage with the onion and garlic.  I use Ricotta cheese mixed w/one egg and then toss the noodles in it before adding it to the pan.  I put my sauce down first, but still spray the pan with Pam.  I add one 15oz can of tomato sauce to the jarred sauce.  I use a whole brick of Mozzarella for this.  I slice the Mozzarella and layer the slices as I make it, ending with mozzarella on top.  And yes - cover it!  Depending on how deep your pan is, will determine how long it needs to cook.  For my recipe, I need 60 minutes minimum, then I take the foil off, lower the temp to 350 deg, and bake it for another 20-30 minutes until everything is bubbling and gooey.

Just tried this tonight and everyone loved it! Husband got seconds, and we even cut it up and gave some to our one year old who seemed to really enjoy himself. I halved the recipe because there are only the three of us, but it still seem to turn out pretty well. Plus we have plenty for leftovers which I'm sure will be delicious.

I want to give this five stars because my kids liked it so much but it was missing something for me. The ricotta adds saltiness and I did really miss that. Otherwise it was surprisingly good with the sour cream, not "hall of fame worthy" but better than I expected.

Love it!  This sour cream version is so much better than ricotta. I've been making a ricotta version forever. I'm a sour cream convert now!  I cut the recipe in half and it still fills up a 9X13 pan.

This is the best Baked Ziti recipe I've tried. I thought the sour cream was kinda weird ( I've always used Ricotta), but I used it anyway. It was great, the whole family loved it. I followed the recipe except that I had no Provolone, so I used more Mozzarella. Also, I baked it about 45 minutes.

I boiled my pasta with 2 cubes of beef "squares of broth I cannot spell", dumped the sauce/beef/onion mixture that I added about 4 cloves of garlic to back in the pot with the drained pasta, mixed in the sour cream, and did 2 layers. The mixture, topped with provolone, mozzerella, and parm, then more pasta mixture, and the other half of the cheeses on top. baked as directed. Used 2 jars of Rinaldi sauce that was on sale. One jar was garlic and onion or something and the other was mushroom and peppers I think. Turned out amazing. Especially since I am not a ricotta cheese fan.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I was skeptical at first when adding so much sour cream to a layer of the ziti but wow...it ended up being one of my favorite parts of this dish. My kids and husband both love this recipe, no one is ever hesitate to ask for seconds or even leftovers!

I tried this recipe thinking that it was going to be like other Baked Ziti recipes but was surprised to find that it wasn't like the other recipes at all.  It is excellent and reminded me of lasagna.. just with different noodles.  The fact that it called for sour cream instead of cottage or ricotta cheese was an added plus. We live in Costa Rica and cow cheese is VERY expensive here so being able to use sour cream is a money saver for us!  Hubby said I can make this anytime! He loved it even more than I did!

I Went to culinary school, studied in Italy and love this recipe. Yes, you can make modifications but don't whine and say to use ricotta for authentic Italian. In Italy people use what is fresh and what they have on hand.  Delicious and perfect .

Ok, caveat:  I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese.  And I add sour cream quite often to my pasta dishes.  I'm not going for "authentic" Italian, here.  I'm feeding my family good food.  Having said all of that - I really liked the recipe!  I gave it 4 stars because the ground beef needed something.  I did sauté' it with onions and garlic, s&P.  I think next time (and yes there will be a next time) I'll use Italian sausage.  OH!  And the jar sauce really matters.  Use what you would use plain on pasta.  If the sauce is bland this too will be bland.  Thank you for a really  nice recipe!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe but it made a lot of food! We ended up freezing half of it. And something worth mentioning, we made sure to cover the dish while it was baking which was a great tip from another review.

I made this exactly the way it was said originally but left the sour cream out n added a lil butter milk in with the sauce. It was great n I agree anyone that cooks knows to cover anything u put in the oven.

Thought it was great, I never knew sour cream tasted so much like ricotta cheese. However, the texture of sour cream is wrong. I would suggest sticking with ricotta cheese.

I have to say I have made this twice already and it has been a big hit with everyone who has eaten it. Every comment I have gotten was wow it's not the same old dried out baked ziti. The only thing I changed the second time I made it was I omitted the provolone cheese and added 1 1/2 cups of ricotta cheese with an egg mixed in . I would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone

I followed this recipe to the T! It was easy to make but I am slightly new in the kitchen. I followed also some suggestions from other members. I used Bertolli Marinara sauce. Added one tablespoon of Italian seasoning to if. And added garlic to onions while browning meat. It came out excellent. My italian boyfriend and his mother loved it! Lol. They loved the left overs even more! Lol awesome recipe!

My husband doesn't like sour cream at all, and he loved this recipe! If you want ricotta simply find another recipe. This recipe is fabulous just as it is and everyone I have made it for raves about it. I'm always forced to share the recipe and they're always surprised when I tell them it has sour cream in it. You will love this recipe!!! Yummy! Pairs nicely with a good Cabernet!

Easy recipe. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and it was great. You need to put it in a 10 x 17 dish however as it makes a ton.

Hard to beat this for a simple and baked tasty ziti. You can use whatever sauce you prefer. You can use beef, sausage or chicken for the meat and it comes out great. Makes a lot but we freeze in portion size and the kids can thaw and eat when they are "starving".

Just made this last night. The store was out of ziti, so I used penne. It worked just fine, but didn't have to boil it as long. Only about 3 1/2 minutes. I also used sausage instead of beef. I used 1/2 cup sour cream and a cup of ricotta. It was kinda watery, but not too bad. Very tasty!

I followed another review that said to layer sauce on top of the first layer of noodles. Turned out great! I only used half an onion and used 8 oz. of both cheeses since that was what the size was that I purchased! I only had 3/4 cup of sour cream left over from another All Recipe's recipe so just used less than it said. But this still turned out DELICIOUS!!!! Since i'm cooking for one, this will be my lunch and dinner for the next 5 days! (Cheap, easy and YUM!!!!!!!) but I can't wait to entertain with this recipe!! It's soo good

I tend to follow every recipe as outlined unlike everyone else who basically makes their own recipe and than they rate it. Recipe was very easy to follow and rather quick and easy.  The only flavor would pretty much be the spaghetti sauce you use.  My wife and daughter enjoyed it however they asked I add some vegetables next time such as Italian squash and or succhini.  overall a good staple recipe. PS, It is enough to feed 6 people easy. We only had three people and I could have lunch for the next 2-3 days.

Definitely a family favorite. Great taste and great consistency. Make sure to cover it when you put it in the oven or it will dry out. I did half ricotta half sour cream based on recommendations. And also added Italian seasoning and oregano for extra flavoring. Keeping this recipe.

This was a HUGE recipe that was easy to assemble.  Put it together during the day and then baked it that night for dinner.  Took half the dish and froze it in an aluminum tray.  Pulled it from freezer and baked it for 1 hour at 350 degrees and it was just as good as the first time.  Definitely a keeper.

It has been very well received at my house! My 9yo daughter has requested it for her birthday meal for two years in a row. I also take it premade for a hassle free meal when we are on vacation. I usually make my own sauce, but it is yummy with jarred sauce as well.

Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Tasty and easy! I like the sour cream change up from time to time. I also like that there is no egg. As a vegetarian I omit the meat but sometimes add zucchini. I also make my own sauce with fresh parsley and rosemary. Great comfort food.

This was the best baked ziti recipe I have ever tasted.  I have noted some comments about covering versus not covering.  I am a seasoned cook and thought twice about that myself. I did not cover and it turned out great. It has just a slight crispiness to the outer crust. Give this a five star. DELICIOUS!

Definitely loved the sour cream idea. Gave much more flavor than ricotta. Only had mozzarella, no provolone. Came out delicious. Definitely cover when cooking then uncover to brown cheese a bit. Whole family from 19 months to 39 years LOVED it. Husband requested it be put in the regular rotation. Recipe makes a lot. This is a definite keeper!

The family loved it! I put sauce down and stirred with the first layer of noodles then did the cheese etc. Cover it when baking then added more cheese on top for last 5 minutes and uncovered. Will make again!

I made this the other night. I didn't have sour cream, so I used ricotta instead. My husband and son loved it! I thought it was a good, easy meal and would definitely make it again.

Love this recipes. I have made it a couple times. The sour cream gives it the special uniqueness so please do not substitute for ricotta. The only suggestions that I agree with is putting sauce on the first layer before the cheese and sour cream since the cheese does create a barrier that prevents the sauce from going to the bottom. The second is adding some Italian sausage to the mix.  Gives it a little more kick and makes it more meaty. Make sure you have guest as the 13X9 makes a lot! Great recipe!!!!

This was incredible and so easy. The only thing I changed was I added two spoons of minced garlic to the onions and ground beef. Otherwise, I followed it exactly and served it to company. Everyone raved about it. It's a keeper! Thanks!

I made this last night for my family and it was very well received by my 8 yo and hubby :) Comforting and delicious!! I made as followed as closely as my pantry and fridge would allow... used rotini pasta (didn't have ziti :(, made my own meat sauce (didn't have jarred sauce). I did layer pasta, meat sauce, provolone, sour cream, pasta meat sauce, then cheese on top. covered and baked for 30 mins then removed foil and put it under the broiler for a couple mins to brown the cheese on top. DELICIOUS :) makes a ton and freezing the leftovers for next week! Thanks for a great recipe my family loved :)

I made this recipe today for the first time. I made a few changes based on other reviews that I read. I added pasta seasoning to the sauce while it simmered. I also added a bratwurst as that is all I had in addition to the ground beef. I made sure to cover the pan while it was baking. My husband said this was the best dish I have ever made. I will definitely be making it again.

Baked it exactly as written and was underwhelmed. Very rich and tasteless. Too much sour cream, dry and bland. Next time I will make some adjustments such as cutting back on sour cream or using ricotta,adding some seasonings, more sauce and covering it while baking. I would give it one star but my 11 year old had seconds.

Fantastic recipe! I took the advice of others and stirred the first layer a bit.  Used probably 10 oz of mozzarella and Kroger private selection sauce.... One spicy and one regular.  May add sweet Italian sausage next time,  but great as is!

I just made this recipe tonight and it is GREAT! I read the previous reviews and so made some changes. Added 4 or 5 cloves of garlic, mixed the sauce with the pasta for the bottom layer and covered it during baking. I will be making this again, many times I'm sure. Thank you Colleen!

I've tried to make ziti for years. Prob about once a year.  Always tastes like its missing something. My boyfriend found this recipe so we tried it.  We LOVE It. At first I thought it sounded kinda gross with provolone and Sour cream but this dish is amazing !!!  I have made it repeatedly.  Of course please remember to cover this so as not to form a crust on top.  You won't regret trying this one.

Nice change from spaghetti or lasagna. I mixed some sauce with the pasta for the bottom layer and covered with foil as some recommended. Didn't seem to need all the sour cream...

Excellent....The BEST Baked Ziti EVER!
I loved this recipe for Baked Ziti. I just made this for the first time yesterday, and I wish I had found it sooner. This was so easy to prepare and very rich and tasty. I made it exactly as the recipe called...I didn't alter it in any way. It makes NO sense to rate and review a recipe that has been altered...So, I made it exactly as written. It was fantastic...and I will be making this for our holiday buffet table.

Delicious recipe!!  I especially like the use of the sour cream. I was skeptical but it was (and is because I am literally eating it right now). I made this for my 3 yr old and 2 yr old so I changed it to add veggies. I used pasta with veggies cooked in it, I mashed up some carrots and peas and added them to the sauce. My kids nor my husband could even tell there were veggies added. As a mom, that was a good feeling to have my kids actually eating veggies without forcing them. They actually asked for more!!!  I see other people put that it dried out but I did it uncovered and had plenty of sauce on top.  I think that helped it not dry out.

Delicious! As other recipes suggested, I mixed the pasta with the meat sauce and opted for ricotta rather than sour cream.

This is my favourite pasta dish; it's the perfect combination of flavours! To make it vegetarian, I sub chopped cremini mushrooms for the ground beef and I change up the method based on a previous review - mix the sour cream with the hot drained pasta, put 1/2 in the baking dish, spread 1/2 of the sauce mix and top with 1/2 of the cheese and repeat with remaining ingredients. yum-o!

My wife has used this recipe many times. She makes it in 2 separate containers. This is enough for 2 dinners, putting 1 in the freezer. The only thing is she ads a can of olives. (my preference) This is one of my favorites to take to our summer cottage. She doesn't want to spend time in the kitchen. Loaf of crusty bread, a ready made salad and she has dinner in minutes. I give it 10 stars.

My husband loved this and my son loved this! I thought it a little bland. So at the dinner table i added some special pasta mix seasoning. And then it was to my liking. So overall, great recipe! It made enough leftovers for two nights.

Very good, however I did alter some things. I had penne pasta, and only one jar of sauce. I didn't have provolone, so I used all mozzarella. Used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I generously ground black pepper into the sauce while it simmered. Baked it in a deep dish casserole for only about 20 minutes (pasta and sauce were still hot, only the sour cream was cold) and it was perfect. Not DRIPPING with sauce, but not dry either.

This was wonderful and very easy to make!  The only change I made was, I tossed the ziti in a tiny bit of the sauce before putting in the bottom of the pan.  It seemes like it would get dried out without it. We don't like ricotta, so this recipe was PERFECT for us. The sour cream was a nice touch. I thought it was strange at first, but it turned out quite similar to ricotta but without the texture (which is what we don't like about it) Everyone loved it so we will surely be making it again at our house!

This was really good! The sour cream gives it a nice creamy texture. I used reduced fat sour cream and ground turkey in my recipe and used sharp cheddar cheese and monteray Jack cheese in the layers. I also sauted mushrooms with the meat and onions. If/when I make it again, I'll use less sour cream (little overpowering), a chunky veggie spaghetti sauce and more garlic. Overall we enjoyed it and it passed the picky husband test! It should taste even better the next day!

I have been using this recipe for years, and haven't had a single person NOT say that it was amazing. I use ground turkey instead of beef, and an 8 ounce package of italian blend cheese (mozzarella, provolone, romano, parmesan, fontina & asiago) instead of the 6 oz mozzarella and 2 oz parmesan. I also layer differently: 1/2 ziti, 1/2 sauce, sliced provolone, sour cream, a handful of the italian cheeses, remaining ziti, remaining sauce, and remaining cheese.

This baked ziti is SO delicious! I followed everyone's advice and covered the final product before putting it in the oven, but I didn't get a crispy ziti at the end. It was moist, cheesy, and gooey in all the right places, but maybe next time I will remove the aluminum foil for the last 5 minutes of the baking time. 

I seasoned the meat with black pepper and garlic powder. After browning it with the onions and added garlic, I poured in the tomato sauce and one can of mushroom pieces. 

After the simmering was done, I directly placed the sauce on top of the first half of noodles, and then added the cheese, sour cream and so on. Following someone else's tip, I stirred the bottom layer of ziti and sauce together before I added anything else just to make sure that the sauce ran all through the noodles. 

I sprinkled fresh minced basil on top that gave an extra twang to the dish.

My fiance and I loved this meal! I am a vegetarian, so I used Morningstar crumbles instead of ground beef and the dish tasted fabulous! The recipe made a ton of ziti, so we had leftovers for the whole week!

My husband raves about this recipe!  It is his favorite Italian dish and I make it at least once a month! I also made it for my son's graduation party and everyone LOVED it!  Such a big hit!  I follow the recipe as stated, except I mix my sauce, meat and ziti together then layer.  Also, you'll want to cover it and take the foil off for the last 5 minutes!

Followed the recipe exactly but then read the reviews about covering it while baking.  I pulled it out & covered it with 7 min left on the timer...I think next time I might cover it for the entire time although it didn't seem to be dried out at all.  It was delicious!

I couldn't find Ziti pasta in the store, so the closest I came up with was Rigatoni.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  I had cooked it with intentions of having left overs for a little while, but my husband devoured so much of it, that we barely had any leftovers for the following day! :)  He is already asking for me to bake it again!  This was such an easy dish to prepare, and it is one that is definitely good to present to guests.  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This has been my go-to ziti recipe for years because it's so easy.  It's always a hit at potlucks and my youngest son begs me to make it more often.  :) I like to use hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I also use my own sauce and add mushrooms.  That said, this is still a good basic recipe with no changes at all.

My family loves this recipe.  I make it exactly as  written before making any changes. The changes made were slight and to our family's taste only.  This recipe is really, really delicious with or without any changes. I made this recipe several times before I adjusted it to my family's taste.  I switched the noodles to Penne because the little kids in our family found the noodles too large and I cut down on the amount of sour cream to 1 cup.  I also like to put additional mozzarella on the top layer because it looks and tastes better.

Really easy and a ton of food. I snuck in some baby spinach (sautéed it with the meat) to get in some extra nutrients. 

Next time I will leave out the sour cream and up the mozzarella.....the crem got lumpy and watery.

I really debated whether I should substitute the sour cream for ricotta cheese but figured since it is the first time I am making this recipe I should follow it exactly. So I did follow it exactly and it was a great choice!! My two picky teenagers loved it and so did everyone else. I have a list of regular dinners that I make and I will be adding this to the list for sure!!!

My family love this baked ziti! The best! I always use homemade spaghetti sauce (not the store bought). Since I always have sauce on hand all the time. My 3 yr and 18 mo always go for second. The leftover taste even better in our opinion, so it always gone the next day for lunch. I always make this as it is except I use my own homemade spaghetti sauce. The best ziti!

with over 4000 reviews, there hardly needs to be another but this recipe is excellent. I had only the larger tubular pasta but it was still good. Freezes well, reheats well.  Will make it again for sure.

This recipe was easy and tasty!  My only sub was Johnsonville Italian Sausage for the ground beef, and it was more flavorful than plain ground beef.  I followed other reviewers' advice and mixed the sauce with the ziti, before creating a layer of cheese in the middle.  I covered with foil for 1/2 the baking time, and uncovered for the rest of the time.  Using purchased spaghetti sauce is a real convenience, though I'm sure home made would be much better.  This recipe filled my large casserole dish to the brim.

Yum!  Just made tonight, and both my husband and I were satisfied!  Chose this recipe to use up some extra sour cream.  Instead of meat, used veggies I had on hand, eggplant, kale, sweet potatoes and zucchini.  Next time I time I'll Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  Great Lent recipe!!

Made this for a wrestling meet. Tripled the recipe. I followed the advice of a reviewer that said to mix the sour cream with the noodles. Was originally going to make a ground beef one and a veggie (zucchini and mushroom) one but opted to combine it all. Was wonderfully received. Not a speck left!! Will definitely make again!!!

This is very good, but I prefer the versions with a homemade sauce & some cottage cheese. If you aren't accustomed to homemade sauce, use your favorite jarred and you'll love this. Don't use all ricotta, that just turns this into lasagna and you lose the lovely sour tang that is the hallmark of baked ziti.

Be sure to cover it in the oven! I use my own homemade sauce b/c bottled sauce is unacceptable in an Italians house:) Therefore I skip the ground beef b/c there is beef and sausage in my sauce. I do like the sour cream version, but if you mix ricotta with egg instead it gives it more of a lasagna taste. Both are yummy for this Italians tummy!

This was one amazing dish. I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did put the sauce on the noodles first as the other reviewers suggested. This would have been five stars except I wasn't thrilled about the provolone. I will be remaking this again but I will substitute a different cheese for the provolone.

I am giving it five stars after some tweaks. I kept the recipe, for the most part, the same. I didn't have meat so I did just the cheese version,and I mixed the first layer of sauce with the first layer of pasta in the pan. I didn't worry about doing that with the second layer and it came out great. First, COVER THE PAN while it's in the oven. It keeps everything nice and soft. Second, 30 mins at 350 is not nearly as hot or as long as needed. This recipe makes a HUGE helping. Either, bump the oven temp up and keep it at 30 minutes, or keep at 350 and bake for 45 mins. Even though, my cheese wasn't completely cooked through, my husband and my kids thought the ziti was fantastic. My husband had three servings! I saw another post that said to sub the sour cream with ricotta. I'm sure that would be great, too. But, the sour cream makes this ziti taste amazing! Ziti tastes just about the same every where you go. It's kind of hard to screw it up. The sour cream makes it stand out.

LOVED this recipe!! Soooo easy and everyone says it's DELISH! Was a huge hit with the kids and adults alike! Love that it makes enough for a large casserole pan and some left over for a little one...Perfect to take to a party etc...The only thing I did differently after reading all the suggestions...was I mixed the cooked ziti with the sauce...THEN I layered as suggested. Also I accidently omitted the sour cream once and it tasted fine! So in actuality b/c I'm not a huge sour cream person, I use a very thin layer..maybe 1/2-3/4c of a cup instead of the recommended 1 1/2 cups. Thanks for the amazing recipe!! A staple in our family now!

I really loved the taste of this ziti.  I changed the order of the sauce so that I poured it directly on top of the ziti, omitted the meat, and covered it in aluminum foil to bake.  The sour cream and different cheeses made for a flavorful combination.  I used Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I really loved this dish.  The only thing I did different was I added the sour cream to the beef mixture to hide it from my son who claims he does not like sour cream.  He had as least 3 servings over a couple of days and told his dad "mom made a really good pasta dish." Ha, tricked again!! I loved that it made a lot so we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will make it often.

I made this tonight except I followed another member's advice and used an egg with 1 pound of Ricotta instead of the sour cream.  I also omitted the provolone.  I added 1 pound of ground Italian sausage to the sauce instead of ground beef.  The family LOVED it!

This is always a huge hit at our family gatherings, but the high school boys swim team (22 of them) just went through 20 lbs. Now that's a stellar review! We used 1/2 the sour cream and subbed in ricotta for the other 1/2 - mainly because I flaked out at the grocery store.

I tried this dish and my husband and I loved, loved, loved it completely! Looking over the reviews, I did change mine a bit and used some shredded Colby/jack cheese because I had it in the fridge. I added tomato paste to my tomato sauce, used ground chicken instead of beef and layered it like this: ziti noodles, sauce, provolone cheese, sour cream, shredded mozzarella, noodles, sauce, provolone cheese and colby/jack, covered with foiled and baked at 350 for 30 minutes! Turned out delicious! Layering the noodles with the sauces allows the noodles to absurd the tomato sauce flavor!

Very tasty - layered it as other reviewers suggested and baked it covered. Came out nice and saucy! Used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Worth making again!

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I changed was I mixed the sauce with the Penne (instead of Ziti) and it baked great.  Although the sour cream tasted great, next time I will try it with ricotta cheese instead.

Luckily I doubled this recipe for a crowd of 10 people.  The two dishes were gone in no time.  I was reluctant to use the sour cream as the recipe calls for because I've always made the traditional baked ziti with ricotta cheese.  But, I did use the sour cream (the light version) and boy am I glad I did.  This dish is delicious.  I used one 26oz jar of marinara and a 29oz can of plain tomato sauce (because it tastes to fresh.)  Sauteed fresh garlic with the onion & beef.  Again, deeeelish!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I did cut it in half since my husband is eating low carb.  I was a little worried about the sour cream, but it turned out great!  I followed other suggestions and added garlic, but other than that...didn't change a thing.  My 13 year old loved it. I can't wait to make it again!

halved the recipe, put it in an 8"x8", and used some extra parmesan. plus, rigatoni instead of ziti because that's what I had. otherwise, followed exactly. It was a little liquidy but otherwise delicious. maybe I'd drain the beef and onions before adding the sauce next time?

Made this recipe exactly as is and it was so yummy. I gave some to my parents and my dad told me to keep the recipe. He really liked it. I host Bunco at my house in January and now I know what to serve everyone. This is a perfect dish that I know everyone will love.

I've made this Baked Ziti dish a couple times now and my wife can't stop saying how much she loves it while we eat. Oh yeah...I love it too; especially with pepper flakes! It's just so moist and delicious that you can't complain. I prefer mine with garlic bread, salad and red wine. 

For my family of three, this recipe is huge and lasts for at least three full meals (plus a couple of lunch bites), so I am thinking of reducing by half next time. First meal is the best; second meal is good and convenient to prepare, but we experience ziti burn out after that. I actually had to throw some out last time. :(

I finally got around to trying this recipe. I rated it five stars because it was easy and fast to throw together. I did make a couple of changes such as adding canned mushrooms, about a cup and a half ricotta cheese, and extra parmesan. My family enjoyed it thoroughly. Thank you for sharing.

This is a very good basic recipe to follow, I am sure. However I totally altered it in so many ways. I used ground turkey for which I seasoned very well in the morning w/ italian dressing mix , salt, pepper, worchester sauce, cyanne pepper, lawry's season salt, garlic powder, italian season, basil & onion powder. I did this at 9am that morning put in the fridge to marinate. I also diced up Kielbasa sausage small &   added it to regular breakfast hot sausage & chorizo  sausage.  The Chorizo added an extra flavor to it w/o making it taste mexican. I used the oil left from that to cook down the onions , fresh minced garlic, and fresh cut parsely.  I made my own sauce by added can of diced tomatoes, ketchup, & tomato paste w/ some added water to create more sauce. Like the other reviewers I mixed my pasta & sauce together then layered it w/ munster cheese, parmesan, feta, & mozzarella.  I wanted my baked Ziti meaty as well as cheesy. 

I topped the baked ziti w/ extra sharp  cheddar , mozzarella, & parmesan romano cheese which baked a nice crust on it. OMG it was so good, & it didn't feel heavy or too rich I think because I used ground turkey. 

You must definently cover the Ziti w/ foil while cooking in the oven so it will not  dry. I did a lot of prep work because of what I added but it was so worth it.. I will do this again. it was so much food I ended up with two pans, glad I made enough sauce everything came out perfect. This was my 1st time making Baked Ziti

I was wary about using sour cream in baked ziti, but it was really very good.  I used extra sauce, just my preference, and as suggested I mixed the pasta with the sauce & meat then layered it 1/2 the noodles/sauce, all the provolone, all the sour cream, remaining noodles then 8oz of mozzarella and cooked it covered for all bot the last 10 min.
Delicious!  I'll definitely make it again.
(ps- those who had trouble finding sliced provolone, check your deli counter!)

Quick & easy, kids & hubby loved it, so that makes me happy!  CHANGES: 1) Subbed 14.5 oz box wheat penne for ziti 2) added 4 tablespoons Parmesan, 1/2 tsp dry basil & 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning to sour cream 3) put small bit of sauce on bottom of pan to prevent sticking 4) layered 1/2 pasta, 1/2 sauce, provolone, sour cream mix, other 1/2 pasta, other 1/2 sauce, mozzarella.  Great go-to recipe for a quick weeknight meal that will keep them eating instead of complaining....thanks for the recipe Colleen!

I really enjoyed this and my 2 year old loved it. But I found it was a lot like a lasanga but with different noodles. Still super tasty, would like to try it with spicy sausage meat instead of ground beef next time

This is awesome.  The only thing I did was add a *lot* of italian seasoning and meat. I prefer italian sausage, so I add that along with the beef.

My whole gamy and everybody else I have made this for loves this stuff.  It seems like such a simple dish, but you would think i made them gourmet Itaian food every time I make it. I make it as is except I have added Italian sausage to it too a couple of times and they love that.

Because all the ingredients are already cooked, there is no reason to bake it for 30 minutes.  I baked it for 15 minutes uncovered and had no problem with it drying out.  Other than the baking time, I made the recipe as it was listed, and it was great!  I will definitely make this again!

I made this as directed, other than substituting low/reduced fat ingredients where possible.  I didn't care for the sour cream in this recipe and while the end result was OK, I think I will try another baked ziti recipe next time.

This is excellent!.... I just made it for a crowd and it was a big hit.... added a pound of hot Italian sausage with the ground beef, along with some garlic.  Easy to make ahead and pop in the oven.  Another review said if you do this.. double the cooking time.  I will be making this again.

This was wonderful. I loved this with the sour cream. I added extra provolone and put mozzarella on top. So cheesy and satisfying! Yum Yum Yum. I will say that I had one guest who did not like this because he tasted the sour cream and he was not a fan of that. You can taste the sour cream in the recipe so if you have someone that hates sour cream, this is not something they will like!

This was fantastic. My husband took leftovers & shared with a co-worker who liked it so much he emailed his wife the recipe and asked her to make it for dinner that same night. A very good dish to make ahead of time, even the night before & then just pop in the oven, also good for a pot luck

Baked this for the family tonight for the first time! It's a great dish, though this dish needs to be baked covered. If not, the top layer will dry out - not good eats. I omitted the onion (dad hates them) and the sour cream (don't like it) and it turned out awesome.

Delicious and easy. Ricotta cheese is dry and expensive-the sour cream was a really great alternative. This was my first time making it but I've saved it to my recipes because it was absolutely a family hit. Thanks Colleen!

This is such a delicious and easy meal to make. It would be excellent for a potluck dinner or family meal. It is pretty versitile. Some people complain about dryness and suggested substituting for the sour cream. Personally we cooked it covered and it was great. Not dry at all. The cheese and sour cream made this dish over the top tasty! I did add a clove of garlic to the ground beef and onion when I browned it. Overall, this is a crowd favorite!

You will not regret this meal. This recipe is fabulous.  The only thing I suggest is that you add two or three minced cloves of garlic and follow directions.

This was a phenomenal recipe. My husband loved it. It makes a lot and is very filling. We have tons of leftovers, which is ok by us. I did use whole wheat pasta, italian sausage instead of hamburger and light sour cream. It was amazing and you could taste a hint of the tang in sour cream. It went very well with the pasta dish. I did layer in this order: noodles, sauce, sour cream, provolone, noodles, sauce, mozzarella/parm. I baked it uncovered for 25 minutes and it was perfect.. defiinitely not dry at all.

Made it last night - soo good!! It was super easy, I am definitely a beginner and if I can do it anyone can do it! I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot italian sausage, added a little more flavor I think. Also I was worried about the sour cream, since I've never heard of sour cream in baked ziti before but it came out great!! I forgot to cover it, like others have suggested and it only made the outside pasta a little crunchy. Also, I put a little more mozzarella on top before the parmesean. This will definitely be made over and over again in the future!

So delicious! Instead of layering everything, I just mixed it all together, covered with cheese and baked. Yum! A recipe to put in the weekly rotation for sure!

Wouldn't have thought to use sour cream as a layer in this but it is so good!  I also love that the melted cheese is NOT stringy (although I did not use as much cheese as the recipe called for).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe as many others have stated.  I have made this several times pretty much the way it is.  However tonight I added half a chopped green pepper, a small can of sliced black olives, and 1 lb. of Johnsonville smoked brats (which I sliced fairly thinly) to the hamburger when it was cooking.  These made it even more delicious!  I also changed the mozzarella to Italian blend, and after baking for 20 minutes put more on the top for the last 15 minutes.  I feel this casserole needs more time to bake because of its density.  I also put it into a pan one size larger than my 9X13 tonight, and it was still full to the top!  That was probably because of the extra pound of meat, but the larger pan is a good idea - regardless.  You will definitely need it.  I bet you could add Italian sausage or pepperoni or whatever spicy meats your family likes to give it a different flair for the next time you make it.  This brings it over the top compared to a pizza pasta casserole we used to make!

This was a delicious version of baked ziti. Add a touch of cheddar as well to the top layer and a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. An outstanding meal and so easy to prepare ahead of time and pop in oven 30 min before it's needed.

Very good. Like others, I skipped the onions and did 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 sweet Italian sausage, then as I fried them up, I doctored with salt and pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasonings. I used Ragu jarred spaghetti.  Like others, I also mixed up the sauce with the ziti for more coverage so no need to butter the bottom of the pan. Used low fat sour cream sparingly and that was fine. I actually put a bit too much cheese (WHAT?! Is that possible?) so next time I'll use a bit less of the cheese.  I volunteer to help feed the homeless downtown, and this would be an easy, inexpensive dish to feed the hordes with some adjustments in quantity.

Hands down AWESOME recipe , just cover this while it's in the oven so it does not dry out. Also I added one jar of mushroom sauce just to add another layer of flavor , and also greased the pan with a lot of butter .

This is delicious! I made a huge pan of it for my daughter's baptism. We invited about 40 people to our house after the service and I got SO many compliments! I have to admit, I was a little afraid of the sour cream over powering the dish, so I did use mostly sour cream with a little added ricotta. I also made the dish without the meat. I just didn't want to deal with meat that day, but I know it would still be delicious with the ground beef. I know, I know.. I'm a recipe changer, but I do believe this dish would be delicious as is. Highly recommend!

I would not take offense at being called one of the  'Worst cooks in America'. That being said, I've made this dish twice, and both times they all loved it! The only thing I change is making it half ground beef and half Italian sausage. Great recipe!

I have made this several times and it has turned out absolutely delicious! I am not a huge fan of onion, eating or preparing it, so instead of buying an onion to cut and add to the recipe I bought the onion and garlic Prego instead of traditional spaghetti sauce.  It turned out great!

So yummy! Easy! Quick! Made a ton! 

I simply mixed the noodles in with the sauce before layering with cheese in the dish - that way I didn't have any dry noodles. I LOVED the sour cream and wouldn't change that like some reviewers. 
I did add 4 minced cloves of garlic when browning meat/onion...and salt too.
Filled a 9x13 dish + 8x8. and I loosely covered with tin foil.
My 3 year old who hates eating ate quite a bit and said "mmmm, this is yummy" :)

I usually follow this receipe exactly but I put a layer of the sauce mix on the bottom so I don't have to butter the dish.  This is a great recipe!  

If I'm wanting something different I'll change it up by using Vodka Sauce and Rigatoni Noodles.  That turned out great too.  I've also used Ricotta Cheese.  I like it best with Sour Cream and my husband likes Ricotta.  Both are great.

OMG delicious. I've made this a few times now. I'm a vegetarian and I make it by skipping the meat and doubling up on the cheese. My meat-eating friends love the regular recipe too! I will suggest adding your own favorite blend of Italian spices to the sauce. Then sprinkle some directly on the top layer of the Parmesan cheese too. So yums! Thank Colleen!!!

This is a really great recipe. I've made it a few times and everyone likes it alot. I do a few things differently. I double the provolone cheese. I also put the meat and sauce directly above the noodles, then the provolone above that. When you layer it like this the noodles get the sauce all mixed in with them instead of plain noodles with cheese on top, then sauce on top of that. Those are the only two things I do differently, this is an excellent recipe and tastes wonderful! Very easy to prepare ahead of time too!

i loved this. the sour cream really gives it a unique taste. i did what some other people have mentioned doing: i put the first half of the sauce mix right on top of the bottom layer of ziti. and it was soooo good. i can't wait to cook this for my mom :)

I made this recipe exactly to the letter and I even left off the parm cheese on top because I was all out, and this dish was AMAZING!! My family could not get enough and i served it with a nice tossed salad and some fresh roasted garlic italian bread...this recipe is easy to make and sure to not dissapoint.

My husband was soo pleased tonight when I made this, as was I! So delicious! However I made my own adjustments that I would recxomend and actually made it a tad healthier: 
No provolone cheese at all, instead of using all that spaghetti sauce add a small can of no salt added tomato sauce to your mix. Add a large green pepper oregano and Italian seasoning to your meat mixture. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Mix in some garlic as well. Use fat free mozzarella and fat free sour cream. When layering sprinkle garlic roasted bread crumbs over each layer. Cover when baking. YUM! :)

Great recipe!  I made a double batch (in two pans) without the ground beef for a potluck that was meatless.  It was gobbled up - and no one knew it was sour cream!  Definately going in our "whole group of people coming over on a weeknight" file.

No problems with this recipe at all. I do not cook and this was very easy and my family loved it. We will be making this for years to come.

Excellent Ziti recipe!  I left out the onions, and cut the sour cream in half, just for my families preference!  But everyone ate it and loved it!!

This recipe is delicious. I made minor changes and went ahead and substituted the sour cream for ricotta but followed everything else to the "T."

I've made this recipe a few times now and we absolutely love it in my house.  I definitely recommend using ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and putting a little sauce in the bottom of your pan before adding your first layer of ziti but besides that I followed the directions as listed.  I've tried many versions of baked ziti but this one by far is the best!!

Made his Baked Ziti recipe 2 days ago.  My boyfriend immediately went back for seconds!  This was so easy and very fast to make.  Even rookies will be able to make this dish!  I seasoned the ground beef with minced garlic, oregeno, a little of worchestire sauce, and added a pinch of red crushed pepper for a kick.  Just like many of the other reviewers, I also layered my Ziti differently (pasta, sauce, provolone, sour cream, mozzarella).  I spooned the sauce mixture over the noodles. I used 12 slices of the Provolone non-smoked flavor cheee, Prego sauce, and light sour cream.  I used a foil pan since it was deeper than my other dishes.  Don't forget to cover the Ziti in foil before baking. An apple walnut salad went well, as our appetizer before eating the Ziti.

I never write reviews on anything, but after my super picky eaters helped them selves to seconds, I just had to share.  They said they like this dish better than pizza and junk food. WOW!

I did have to substitute the pasta because I could not find ziti, so I used mini penne pasta instead.  Also, I used ground chicken and added some garlic power and salt when I browned the meat.

I've made baked ziti for years but this one was loved by all. i was skeptical about the sour cream and couldn't have been more wrong. I never realized how little ricotta did for this dish and how much better sour cream is in this. Compliments galore! Thanks!

Delicious! Someone mentioned that using ricotta would be more Italian. Provolone is an Italian cheese, too, and the Provolone/sour cream combo, in my opinion anyway, is much tastier than ricotta. Ziti may be traditionally made with ricotta, but personally I'd rather sacrifice authenticity for more flavorful results! This is an excellent recipe, as is. The only change I made was to add garlic. Oh, and I used penne instead of ziti only because I had penne on hand. I will definitely make this again!

I made changes - used ricotta and an egg, used only 13.5 oz whole wheat pasta, used about 1 3/4 jars tomato sauce (26 oz) added 3 cloves crushed garlic to the beef, and sprinkled chopped basil on top. This fit nicely in an  9x13. The fam definitely liked it, but I think my lasagna is worth the extra effort for company.

Really good.  My four year old neice gobbled it up.  I like it without meat & onions and mix 1/2 cup light sour cream with 1 cup fat free ricotta cheese.  I serve it with large italian meatballs (also from this site) and a fresh steamed vegetable.  Freezes well.

This was an easy, and yummy dish. I halved it and baked in a square pan and substituted cottage cheese for the sour cream. I used a garlic herb pasta sauce and ground Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Would definitely make again!

This dish is one of my favorites. I am not a good cook, sorry to say, but this is a dish I make right every time. I have made it at least 4 times and I am making it again tonight to bring to my kid's pot luck dinner at their school.

I made this recipe with the ingredients listed and just layered according to others suggestions. I only put 1 jar spaghetti sauce in with the meat and put half sauce of the other jar in with the pasta. I layered the noddles, additional sauce from jar, meat mixture and the rest as listed and then repeated. I also was careful not to overflow my baking dish so had a little extra that I just saved for leftovers. Very Good! And def use sour cream! It is what seperates this recipe from others.

Delicious! Followed recipe except made two 8X8 pans instead of one 13X9. Mixed the ziti with the sauce and then put more sauce on top, followed by provolone and sour cream, then more ziti & sauce with mozzarella sprinkled on top. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then broiled for an additional 2-3 min. just to brown the cheese. This will be added to our dinner recipe rotation!

What a delicious dinner!  My family absolutely loved this!  We have been trying to do more meals without meat.  So we opted not to use the hamburger (though , I know it would be SO delicious with it) and instead, when I spread on the sourcream, I added cottage cheese with it to!  It was just wonderful!  Hubby wants me to add this to my repertoire.  THANK YOU!!!

Great base recipe that you can alter how you want.  I used whole wheat penne and ground turkey, added some garlic and red pepper flakes when cooking the onion and meat.  Used shredded pizza cheese in place of the provolone bc that's what I had.  My kids both ate two helpings, so it was a hit with all of us!

Just fed a pack of 9 year olds this and it was devoured. I followed the recomendations of sauce with noodles then cheese. I have to say I loved it- wish I had more than a spoonful left. I will definitely make this again!!

This recipe is so delicious! I omitted one jar of sauce, one onion,and  provolone cheese.I used turkey instead of beef, and used whole wheat pasta. I'm not one for sour cream but it actually came out pretty well. This recipe is great and I have a lot of it for leftovers.

OMG - Wonderful recipe.  I used half italian sausage and half ground beef.  Added a little red pepper flakes and stuck to the sour cream instead of the ricotta. I mixed sauce onto pasta before layering.  The plate was just about gone by the end of the night.  This recipe will fill a 9 x 13 inch dish. Thx for recipe

This was my very first ziti, and I couldn't have asked for a better recipe.  I started off by browning the meat with seasoning salt, minced garlic and freshly cracked black pepper.  I cut out the onion altogether and used low-fat mozzarella and sour cream.  Oh, and I simply sprayed my Pyrex with olive oil spray.  Our grater disappeared so I very thinly sliced down a 6 oz block of mozzarella.  I layered everything as described in the recipe, making sure to spread the mozzarella strips evenly.  Based off another review, I covered the dish prior to putting it in the oven.  What I pulled out...I didn't expect.  Amazing.  I sent some down to my boyfriend's father, the first thing I'd ever cooked for him except dessert and he raved about it.  So yes, this recipe will definitely stay in my rotation!!

Super easy. Tastes great. Not a lot of ingredients so that's a plus.  It's a recipe that has become a staple for my family.

Pretty good, sourcream seemed a bit overpowering. Very easy to put together, will make again and cut back a little on the sourcream. I added green pepper and mushroom also to get some more good for you veggies. Also I used fatfree where I could and whole wheat pasta which makes this actually very diet friendly comfort food! Thank you very much. If the sour cream didn't overpower it would have been an easy 5 stars.

Made for a large group. Everyone loved it. The only additions I made was adding Ricotta cheese layer and  fresh Mozzarella on the top.

This recipe was easy, quick and tasty. I used vodka sauce instead of regular marinara and it was a hit. Typically I am a separatist when it comes to food, meaning I hate baked ziti, lasagne and the likes because there's too much 'mixing' of the flavors and touching! (I know I sound like a 5 year old) BUT, I put myself aside tonight for dinner and made this recipe. I mean how could I go wrong when it has almost 4000 reviews and it's got 4.5 stars?! I LOVED it, and my only change was the vodka sauce! I definitely recommend it! YUM, even my 18 month old wanted seconds!

Loved it- My boyfriend and I don't like ricotta cheese, so the sour cream was the perfect addition.  Very easy to make, and I will definitely make again for company.

My favorite and most used recipe on here! My family LOVES it! as do I...would give it more stars if i could, I didnt think the sour cream would work but it totally did! The provelone is great too! The ONLY thing I added was some crushed garlic but ..I love garlic in everything though and the best store bought tomato sauce I use is Francesco Rinaldi..traditional..

I thought this recipe was delicious. I did make a couple of changes, I used light sour cream and lean ground turkey as substitution. It was absolutely perfect. The hubby seems to agree! :o)

I followed the directions exactly.  It was very good!  Next time I will mix the pasta with the sauce before layering.  I like things a little more blended.

I've made this recipe for 13 people so far and everyone loves it except for my 8 year old... but the only part she doesn't like is the onions.  Can we say picky?

Easy to make, and there are always plenty of leftovers.  I think this serves way more than 8 people - maybe 16.  :)

This dish is fantastic!  I made it with italian sausage instead of the ground beef, and what a hit!  My husband doesn't typically love pasta, but with the sausage, this was very hearty and he loved it.  The sour cream and provolone make this a wonderful creamy dish!

The sourcream/provolone was excellent and easier to spread than the ricotta. Make sure you use a higher quality sauce or make your own! Also, add oregano and minced garlic to the cheese mixture for each layer. Makes 2 8x8 dishes!

I have made this recipe several times.  It is excellent.  I make this for a group of 6 teenage boys who clean the dish.  I always read the reviews and take what I like from each them.  I do not think of it as rewriting the recipe but more of a tweeking of an excellent recipe.   Thank you for a great recipe that I can serve to a group of hungry boys.

While this was good, we found it to be slightly bland.  Would add garlic and some additional spices next time.  It 'could have been' the spag sauce I used but I don't think so.  Thought it needed a tad more salt as well.  There was none listed for the ground beef and IMO should have been.

My daughter is a pasta freak and said "This is really good".  Not only do you need to cover this with foil you might consider using a baking dish with a height of more than 2 inches.  After 20 minutes in the oven it started to pour out of the dish.  I'm not a big fan of pasta dishes, but it was good.

LOVED this version of Baked Ziti.  I didn't change a single thing.  I got the provolone cheese from the deli (Boreshead) and had them slice it thin. I used Emeril Lagasse's "Homestyle Marinara" for the sauce.  I will definitely be making probably twice a month!  Even the husband is asking for it!

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my family and anyone else I have made it for. I recently catered my sister in laws baby shower and this was the main dish, everyone wanted the recipe. I do sometimes increase the amount of sour cream and provolone cheese or make it with or without meat, depending on who I am cooking  it for, but it always comes out delicious. Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

This was AWESOME!!  I halved the recipe so I cut everything in half except for the sour cream where I used used an entire 8oz container of sour cream just because it was easier.  I also used my own homemade sauce but I'm sure it would be delicious with your favorite jarred sauce so I still gave it 5 stars even tho I tweaked it slightly.  Served it with sweet italian sausage in sauce on the side.  Hubby said it was delicious and to make it for our next dinner party!  We liked the tang the sour cream gave it.

Tasty!  I took the advise of others with the layering-putting some sauce on the first layer of pasta before the provolone.  I also added some veggies (spinach, blanched chard, garlic, mushrooms) to the sauce mix.  I was surprised but delighted with the sour cream/prov result.  Will try next time with sausage/meat mix.

Fairly easy to throw together for this family of 6.  While it did lack the "traditional Italian" ricotta - it doesn't claim to be traditional, and my father in law can't stand ricotta, and won't touch anything with ricotta in it - so I was looking for alternatives.

Perfect for company!  Four adults and two teenagers ate this (along with a salad and bread), we had almost half left.  It was delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  It's so much easier than lasagne and tastes just as good.  Delicious with and without meat in the sauce.

Excellent! I normally don't care for baked ziti but this recipe had great flavor due to the provolone & sour cream. I used homemade spaghetti sauce instead of jarred, but otherwise I followed the recipe - only making a half batch for my family of 4. It is definately a make again dish!

This is a terrific and yummy recipe just as posted (I did cover with foil while in the oven).  I brought it to a pot-luck get together with friends and everyone loved it. Very mom friendly (quick and easy to make) and very kid-friendly (the 3-4 year olds loved it!).

This dish is a perfect way to enjoy a delicious meal for any occasion with almost no prep time. My family and I made this for Christmas Day and it was a huge hit! Somethings to add to this recipice would be basil and oregano on top of every layer and some cheddar cheese to sprinkle on the top. And don't be afraid to layer on that cheese! The point of the different kinds of cheeses is to taste all of their individual tastes which become hidden if you don't put enough of them on. Also the meat can be substituted for ground veggie meat for vegetarians. Also a great and easy recipe for kids too.

I have made this Ziti a few times and it's a hit around our house. I even made it for my son's birthday party for our family and relatives of about 40 people and every one loved it.  One of the major change I make in this recipe is that I make my own sauce also on this site (Valerie's Bolognese Sauce) and use it in place of the jarred stuff as instructed in the recipe.   It makes the ziti super delicious and nothing beats the taste of homemade sauce.  I always, for our own preference, double the provolone and mozzarella cheeses, mix the pasta with the sauce before layering it, and cover with a foil while baking.

Delicious!  Made this for the first time to bring to a party.  Added a pound each of sausage and chopped beef.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone said it was great!  Will definitely be making often.

My whole family loves this recipe. I made it one day after a friend made if for me and now I make it everywhere here, school, random trips to people's houses! This simple recipe always awes everyone I meet (and therefore they think that I am an awesome cook). However, I often don't use ziti noodles and substitute with whatever is in my pantry like penne. Also, if you don't bake it covered it tends to dry out just a tad but overall it is still one of my favorite recipes!!!!

The recipe was good, but I really wish I had followed the advice of some other raters and used ricotta instead of sour cream. I usually like sour cream, but in this recipe it just didn't work really well.  Overall, awesome recipe though I will definitely use it again without the sour cream.

Pretty good! I halved everything accept for the hamburger and parmesan due to a limited cooking area. A 9x9 was close to overflowing! I did use ricotta instead of sour cream because it's what I had; I added italian seasoning, parmesan and basil because I always do when I'm using store-bought sauce; I layered it putting the sauce down first. This is hearty, filling and makes great left-overs! We will have this again!

YUMMY! I just made this dish and it turned out wonderful! I  made a few changes to make it healthier: I used ground turkey instead of beef (you can't even tell the difference and it cuts the saturated fat by more than half!).  I added diced green peppers, mushrooms and fresh garlic along with the onions and meat.  I used whole wheat ziti (this is a great way to add whole grains and fiber, if you don't really care for the taste of whole wheat, or if you have picky kids, try adding half whole wheat and half regular). I used reduced fat sour cream, and substituted one cup of sour cream for fat free ricotta cheese. I used mozzarella cheese made with 2% milk. All of these modifiations made a healthier dish, but it still tasted wonderful! My whole family loved it! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my rotation!

I have to say, the ingredients seemed a little weird to me for a baked ziti recipe, but it's actually really good! It does make a whole lot, so I split the recipe between two pie pans so that I can freeze half for another night when I need a quick meal and don't have time to prepare anything. I also substituted turkey sausage for the ground beef without any problems.

I LOVE this ziti!  I've made it a few times with sour cream and a few times with ricotta, and I much prefer the ricotta to the sour cream, though both are good.

I give 5 stars, but I followed one reviewer's advice and used riccotta and omitted the sour cream. I also added egg and chili powder to the riccotta mix. I know chili powder sounds odd, but you really have to try it. It adds no heat, just more flavor. I layered : Noodles, riccotta, sauce, mozzarella. Wonderful and filling.

We had friends and family over for our weekly Sunday night dinner and it was a huge hit!  I did like many suggested and seasoned the beef a little bit with some Italian spices; separated the sauce into 1/3 and 2/3 portions.  Mixed the pasta with the 2/3 portion and used the 1/3 sauce only portion for the upper sauce layer.  Totally agree with mixing the pasta with the sauce.  The rest I pretty much followed the instructions, but was sure to cover with tin foil while baking.  In the end the dish was delicious and easy to prepare; highly recommend.

I absolutely loved this!!! My boys devoured it and were disappointed when we ran out. When we were finishing the leftovers, one of my boys said he was trying to eat it as slow as possible to savor the last of it! I did change up the recipe a little bit,  I added and egg and only put a 1/2 c sour cream and replace the other c. with ricotta. Blended it all together with mozzarella. I also subbed the provolone with 5 Italian. I mixes the noodles and sauce together and lined the bottom of my pan with sauce. Its definitely a keeper!! I love AllRecipes! oh, yea.....i also added an extra jar of sauce :)

It was good for how easy it was to make, and my family ate it. But for my tastes it was kind of bland and uninteresting.

This was delicious! I used the Morningstar Farms "sausage" links since we are vegetarian. And I didn't have any provolone so I just used sub'd it w/ mozzarella. This is my new baked ziti recipe, thanks for sharing!

Excellent and super easy pasta dish!   I followed the recipe for the most part except I used turkey Italian sausage instead of beef and mixed the sauce with the boiled pasta instead of layering the pasta and sauce.  I followed a reviewer's advice and boiled the pasta for 1 less minute so that it doesn't get soggy when it cooks again in the oven.

Loved this!  While browning the meat, I added onion, green and red peppers, minced garlic, italian seasoning, a dash of worcester sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.  Since my grocery store was out of ziti noodles, I bought rotini, and it was just as good.  I layered as suggested in the recipe.  I couldn't get provolone cheese, so I bought an italian mix which contained provolone, parmesan, emmental, and mozzarella.  On top, I sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half and there was still too much!  I'll make it for a potluck next time, where there'll be more people!

This was just WONDERFUL!!! I will definitely make this again and again! The sour cream was a definite plus. I did make a few small changes, but not enough to take away from the original recipe. I used low fat sour cream and mixed with it about 6 oz of ricotta cheese. I also used 3 cloves of minced garlic and, because I increased the amount of meat by about 1/3 lb, I used a little more spaghetti sauce. I used Preggo's mushroom sauce and put in a pinch of baking soda in to cut the acidity.  When I cooked the pasta (I used penne as that is what was on hand and it is much like ziti) I under-cooked it by half, so it would finish cooking in the oven.  I took the advice of others and mixed some of the sauce directly into the pasta and covered it so it would not dry out.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious and versatile recipe with us!

Great! Easy! I followed directions and ingredients, but halved the recipe as there's only two of us. To make one step easier, after browning italian sausage, onion, and minced garlic (my only addition), I added the sauce and the cooked noodles, then mixed all well. I layered 1/2 the mixture, then sliced provolone, sour cream, remaining noodle mixture and topped w/mozzarella and parmesean. GREAT and that simple change made it even easier!

This is comfort food at its best. I can't believe that I haven't made this yet, and I am so glad that I did.  Like others, I was a little skeptical about sour cream in an Italian pasta dish.  I had 1/2 cup of cottage cheese to use up, so I added that in with 1 cup of sour cream and used that.  I also only had penne pasta, so that is what I used.  I made my own sauce with meat, and this dish was outstanding.  All of my kids had seconds, and the great thing is that there is enough leftovers for them to have this for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a perfect pasta recipe.

This is probably one of the only baked pasta recipes I have ever liked.  Normally they are so dry and flavorless, but not this one.  It was excellent and I have no reason to look for another baked ziti recipe again.

Everyone that has tried this just loves it and asks for recipe!    I really don't change recipe around at all, other than I don't put in onion due to taste preference, and I use ground Italian turkey sausage- it gives it a nice flavor without the extra fat from actual Italian sausage.  (If you have never tried it, my husband didn't even know the difference!)    I do put sauce on the noodles before putting the provolone on.    My only complaint is that sometimes the middle isn't quite hot when cooked for only 30 minutes, so I cook it a little longer.  I use Ragu Organic sauce.  Just my preference of course.  But again, I can't say enough about this meal.  So good, and easy.  And even better the next day!  (And the next, and the next...)

Excellent. Made recipe as is (took advice of fellow reviewers and I did mix the noodles and sauce together before layering) However, the provolone and sour cream in this dish just gave it such a hearty and rich feel.. it was delicious. I urge everyone to try this recipe as written.. it is amazing and my company thought so, too. Will definately be making this again!

I just mentioned to my wife that I was going to pause for a while on the pasta dishes....until I found this one...And I am surely glad that I did...very easy to make extremely affordable (fed a family of 5 with leftovers appx 10bucks) I didnt know what 1 1/2 cup of sour cream was its appx 16oz I also used 12 slices of Provolone and 8oz of Italian blend cheese....Super Super good will add this into the rotation........Be sure to cover it with foil when baking........

These was outstanding. I made this for a bunch of teenage boys and they loved it, I did to. I did use ricotta cheese and half a cup of sour cream.  I will be making this often, wish I had found this recipe sooner.

My hubby made this recipe tonight. He made it as written but did mix the cooked ziti with the meat sauce and then layered as directed. Used the sharp provolone - Delish! Sour cream is lighter than ricotta cheese, I highly recommend this dish. PS - tired once with all mozzarella - it was not the same! Be sure to use the provolone as stated.

I couldn't find ziti at my supermarket so I used mini penne, which to me was just as good. However, I would change the way it is layered. After the noddles I would put the sauce on top because by putting the cheese (especially sliced cheese) on top of the noodles the sauce didn't really reach it and my bottom layer was just noodle that has to be mixed in. I didn't really care for this but I suppose thats my fault because I should have expected this to be creamy because of the sour cream and I wasn't looking for creamy. However, my husband devoured like three bowls which is why it got four stars. So overall, I would just make sure your sauce gets to the noodles by changing the order and this will be pretty tasty (as long as you like sour cream and want a creamy texture)

This ziti was all right. It came out well but I felt it lacked flavor. I used a name brand sauce and cooked garlic in with my onions and it still didn't have the flavor I had hoped for. A very good recipe, but in need of some tweaks. Also, it came out watery? Maybe I did something wrong, so that doesn't go against you. This was a good recipe. Thank you!

Loved it!  Made it exactly as directed with two minor substitutions (used meatballs instead of ground beef and sliced mozarella instead of provolone).  Yummy!

I just scarfed down a huge plate of this.. so good!!! I didn't have enough sour cream on hand, so I mixed it with an equal amount of ricotta. Also doctored up the sauce with some minced garlic, italian seasoning, splenda, and crushed red pepper. Awesome!!

I made this last night for 70 at our church, and WOW it was great.  Made me look like a great cook.  I went exactly by the recipe, only used the (servings help) to calculate for 70.  I will use this again soon.

Wonderful recipe! I did change some things. Replaced sour cream with ricotta and made my own sauce from scratch with fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic, white wine and ground turkey. I also layered sauce first to get it into the pasta. DeLish!

my friend made this for me after the birth of my 3rd child. and now, this is my new favorite recipe to make for other people... new moms, people who have been in the hospital, whatever.  to make it more healthy, i've changed a few things.  I use whole wheat pasta, fat free sour cream, spaghetti sauce that comes with veggies in it, plus i chop up one zucchini to add to the sauce.  i use reduced fat cheese and i also use ground turkey instead of beef.  this is so easy. i pair it with a simple salad and some garlic bread or some simple rolls... yum!  also, hubby doesn't like things too creamy so i usually use less sour cream when i make it for our family.  but, honestly, you can't really mess this one up... which makes it perfect for me!

Good stuff! I used leftover meat lover's slow cooker spaghetti sauce from this site. And to avoid the Ricotta/sour cream dilemma, I used both. Topped with Romano cheese. This recipe is almost exactly the same as on the back of the Safeway ziti box.

I made this pretty much exactly as instructed.  My only changes were covering the noodles in sauce before starting to layer and covering the dish with aluminum foil before baking.  The meat was optional in this recipe so I thought it would be a good vegetarian dish to try.  It turned out to be okay but not worth making again.  I thought it was lacking something... probably the ground beef.  I don't recommend this recipe as is to vegetarians.  If you try it, you might want to add mushrooms or some other veggies.

I made my own sauce for this recipe. My family and guests loved it. I mixed the sauce with the noodles before layering the casserole. I cooked it covered. This recipe made enough for me to make a 8x8 dish and I  froze it. I let it thaw for about 24 hours and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes. The noodles were a bit soft but it still tasted great!

Delicious.  I love this recipe.  I read the reviews before making this and did alter it a bit.  I sometimes use penne pasta.  When I brown the hamburger (very lean) I sprinkle on chili powder, nutmeg & celery salt to taste and 1 T minced onions (If I want some heat, I add red pepper flakes.  I use 2-26 oz. jars of Prego Roasted Red Pepper & Garlic sauce and 1 jar of Prego 3-cheese sauce.  I layer it in a 9x13 pan as follows:  1/2 of the pasta, 1/2 of the sauce, sour cream, about seven slices of provolone cheese to cover completely, remaining pasta, about 7 oz. shredded mozzarella, the rest of the sauce and top with shredded parmesan.  Then I cover the pan and bake.  Whenever I make this everyone raves about it and I am always asked for the recipe.

I read lots of the reviews before making this, and did make some changes to the recipe purely because we like things with more "spice".  I used both sweet italian sausage and hot italian sausage (a total of 1.5 lb), several cloves of garlic and italian spices in the pasta sauce.  I also used 1.5 C of sour cream and a half cup of ricotta cheese.  But still felt that I followed the recipe for the most part.  The result was stellar!   I will definitely make this again for a crowd - everyone loved it.

This turned out  kind of bland--should have added some chili powder to the meat mixture or something.  There was so much of it that it was above the top of the baking dish, and I couldn't do all the layers so just did the layers one time.  Wasn't that exciting, but my husband and in-laws liked it.  I just thought it was nothing to get too excited about.  Even with only one set of layers, it spilled over in the oven quite a lot.  Don't know what I did wrong on the layering??

I substitued RICOTTA cheese instead of sour cream and used a pound of lean Turkey meat instead of beef. I always use flavored spagetti sauce to make it sweeter. I also added Muenster cheese in addition to the Provolone and shredded mozzarella. Overall my family loves this recipe.   The only thing is I wish I would have known to cover the baking dish to prevent the drying out effect of the top portion. Thanks again for the recipe.

Very good and easy recipe!  I made this for a group of 25 people and when it was time for dessert, I caught three of the men in the kitchen getting a second and third helping of the ziti instead of cake!

This was great!  I'm sure it would be just perfect as written but I didn't feel like going to the store. Others reviewers mentioned it not being "real" Italian....I don't think it is meant to be.  It is just a good easy weekday meal for a hungry family.  So - I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce (yummy) and did not have provolone so used a dry aged cheddar (definitely not Italian) and doubled the parmesan.  I always pour sauce into the bottom of the pan and then layer up from there. I also mixed the sour cream with the ziti before layering so we wouldn't get a clump of sour cream.  Very, very good recipe with lots of leftovers.  thanks

This was amazing!! We couldn't stop eating it. Don't listen to the other reviews that say to use ricotta instead of sour cream. If you want a Ziti recipe that uses ricotta there are plenty on here. The sour cream is what makes this recipe! The only changes I made were that I used ground turkey instead of beef and whole wheat noodles and a mixture of fat free and light sour cream and just used the cheese I had on hand which were mozzarella and muenster. I would give this 10 stars if I could!! Oh I also mixed the sauce with the bottom layer of noodles as another reviewer suggested and I did cover it while I bakes it.

Awesome!  The fiance loved it, wants to make it a regular in our kitchen.  He only eats those crappy frozen dinners at work, one of his favorites being three cheese ziti.  So I decided to make some fresh that is also healthy (I used whole wheat pasta, low fat sour cream and cheeses, and lean ground beef).  I also mixed it all together before placing in the pan.  Not very visually pleasing, might try the layering next time.  But the taste is incredible!

I prepared this recipe for a dinner party and after reading tons of reviews I made mine the following way: Boiled one 14 ounce whole wheat penne noodles for 8 mins. While that was boiling I browned the ground beef with onions and garlic, drained, and then simmered with sauce. I layered as follows: sauce mixture, noodles, cheese, sour cream, repeat. This filled my 9x13 pan to the max. Covered and let chill over night. I then took this out an hour before I wanted to bake to let it reach room temp before cooking COVERED. This recipe was well received with most people going back for seconds. I even have a lot left over, so this can totally feed a large crowd, and what is great is that it can be prepared before hand. My family doesn't like whole wheat pasta, but cooked this way they had no idea. Loved it! Thanks.

Oh my, this is good!  Only made minor changes - mixed a little sauce with the first layer of pasta as others have suggested, and added some garlic while browning the meat.   I think the sour cream is the secret.  It's rich and creamy and restaurant quality.  I used Classico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce.

This recipe was delicious!  My family loved it.  I added minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  And I also added extra cheese.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect as is!!  I will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic!  I used ground turkey which I seasoned with pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I used ricotta cheese and mixed it with the sour cream.  I followed everything else and I covered it.  Saved in my recipe box!

Very cheesy and my family loved it.  I used lite sour cream, skim mozza cheese, added 1 tbsp. minced garlic and 2 tsps of each oregano, basil and parsley.  I upped the ground beef to 2 lbs. but not again; it's just too much.  There are a lot of preservatives in jarred sauce and next time, I'll make my own with two large cans of italian tomatoes and spices.

I made the recipe as described except for mixing the sauce with the ziti as others suggested and adding minced garlic when cooking the meat.  I used a sweet basil marinara sauce and it tasted great.

First time making.  Made for dinner with friends, which included a total of 5 kids.  Was a hit... all the kids ate it and some asked for seconds.  I would make again. Because some of the reviews said it was bland, I doctored my sauce up a lot with lots of garlic, dried Italian spice, garlic salt and pepper.  I used fresh mozzarella (slided balls).  It was delicious!!  Would make again.

AMAZING. I used extra sauce and put it under the bottom layer of pasta. Make your own sauce it's so worth the extra effort. I recommend a sweet sauce.

Delicious! My future mother in law came for dinner last night and I needed a recipe to impress- this did the trick! I did use the ricotta mixed with 1 egg because I'm not a huge fan of sour cream. The only other change I made was mixing the noodles and sauce toghether before layering. I prepared this a few hours before dinner and put it in the fridge until it was time to cook. Turned out perfect!

I have tried several ziti recipes and this is the best yet. I use italian sausage in place of the ground beef, add a little more sauce and cheese and it is a winner. Leftovers are even better.

This was excellent. As others suggested, I added 2 cloves of garlic with the onion. Also seasoned with a little oregano, pepper and red pepper flakes. Since I was cooking for 3, I used about 10 oz. mini penne pasta and just one jar of sauce. Also cut back on sour cream and cheese accordingly.  Definitely a keeper!

This dish was amazing! It was also very easy to make, seeing as how I'm not that great in the kitchen and mine came out great. I read another review and took the advice of mixing the sour cream in with the al dente noodles before layering and it made it very creamy and wonderful! I love this recipe! And the leftovers!

This recipe was really good.  Holy cow does it make a lot!!!  I used a 9x13 pan and it was filled to the brim.  I used Kay's sauce recipe from this site, and omitted the provolone (I didn't have any, and I'm not a fan of it to begin with).  Next time I might go 50/50 with sour cream and ricotta, as I liked the creaminess of the sour cream but felt it needed something else.  Even my picky 8 year old niece gave me a thumbs-up and asked for seconds!

This recipe is very good. I made half the recipe, but still used 1 pound of ground beef. I layered it as stated in the recipe but topped it with a little extra mozzarella cheese. I will be making this again.

Superb. Sauteed minced garlic before browning ground beef & onions. Added a few mushrooms & peppers. Cooked the sauce the day before thanksgiving, and assembled/baked on the afternoon of. Sour cream instead of ricotta makes this recipe sublime.

Tasty ziti recipe however it seemed a bit dry.  I have made it a couple of times, each time adding more sauce and have permanently increased the sour cream to 16 oz.  I also go heavy on the italian seasoning.  Despite seeming a bit less saucy than  I prefer, it is really yummy.

Great recipe! I make this just as written, but I use hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and I make three layers instead of two.

Used fat free sour cream, no meat and a fast saute of mushrooms, yellow onions and garlic which I added to Emeril's Gahhhlic and Eggplant pasta sauce. Used real (stinky delicious) block of provolone which I grated. Layered the ingredients with the sauce first/next to pasta. OMG!!! Rockin' perfect! Glad I made 4 separate gratin dishes of this... I will savor them all!

I made a half-batch, as it was for one person, and I thought it was delicious! I used the "ground beef" made by Morningstar, to make the dish vegetarian, and it worked wonderfully. I would recommend using a little less sour cream than what the recipe calls for, but overall, this was a great meal.

Awesome! My two and three year old gobbled this up and asked for more. Use a deep 9 x 13 pan. It wouldn't all fit in my pan. I made it according to the recipe and the provolone didn't let the sauce settle into the pan and fill in around the noodles. So next time I think I'll layer the cooked ziti, then the sauce and then the provolone, etc... Next time I think I might try using minced garlic with the onion.

I made this for my family at my grandfather's Birthday. As previously stated I added a little sauce on the bottom of the pan. I also added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, pepper, and Basil to the Sauce mixture. VERY GOOD! I doubled the receipe and made two dishes since I was cookin for alot. They all had seconds and even took some home! We all thought the sour cream added a nice zest to the dish! Will be making this again! Thanks!

This dish is amazing!  It's the perfect dinner and the sour cream really makes it better than any other baked ziti I've tried.  It's also a fairly quick meal to prepare. I usually use "light" sour cream to slightly decrease the calorie intake, but all of the other ingredients are spot on.  Excellent meal, when I ask what we want for dinner I often hear "baked ziti" and I know to use this recipe!

My family loved this ziti. However if you are like me and find that ground beef to be stringy, tough, or grainy substitute it for 1 pound of meatballs. We used frozen meatballs (because they are always on hand), thaw them in the microwave and tear them apart. It is also how they make the dish at one of my favorite restraunts!

Really delicious, Definitely plan on making it again.  I didn't change anything from the original recipe.  I didn't think the pasta seemed without sauce, mine seemed to mix well all on its own.

This was really good!  I made a few changes based on things I wanted to use up.  I don't like onions so I omitted them and used a couple of cloves of garlic.  I had a container of cottage cheese with chives that I bought by mistake so I put it into the blender with a little milk to sub for the sour cream.  Once the noodles were cooked I mixed them with the cottage cheese. I put a layer of sauce down first in the pan, then the coated noodles, a layer of the provolone cheese, a sprinkling of fresh basil, then more sauce, noodles, sauce and the shredded cheese layer.  This made an almost overflowing 9X13" glass pan.  It ended up bubbling over in my oven, next time I will put the pan on a cookie sheet to catch the overflow.  A great recipe!

I was skeptical that a baked ziti made with sour cream would turn out as good as the real thing.  I was wrong!  This meal is delicious!  Just added a few cloves of crushed garlic along with the onions to the meat during the browning.

When I was planning meals for our vacation at the beach this year, I took this recipe with me.  Excellent recipe!  It was quick to put together and fed a crowd who all enjoyed it.  I did put a little of the sauce mixture on the bottom first....my only recipe change.

This was really good.  The only difference is that I always make my own red sauce I make it with a package of sweet and a package of spicy italian sausage instead of ground meat.  Other than that there was nothing changed.  This recipe makes a lot and it will be made again.  Thanks for this great recipie.

I make a low fat version of this.  We use ground turkey, fat free sour cream, and low fat cheeses.  I usually cut the recipe in half but double the meat sauce cuz that's how we like it :) and add some extra tomatoes and shredded carrots.  Also add sauce to the bottom layer.  This is a really great dish to feed a crowd.

Good,  I was a little short on ingredients (provalone) and time, but I used sliced mozzarella and it was very good,  I will experiment with the flavor a little since it was a tad bit bland,  could have been my jarred sauce. Also cut it in half and could have made even less it made more than I was expecting.

Really good.  My new potluck dish!  I took others' suggestions and substituted 1/2 ricotta-1/2 sour cream with 1 egg and tossed with ziti; used spicy ground sausage sauteed with garlic and pasta sauce seasoned with extra salt, pepper, basil, and garlic & onion powders...then sprayed pan and foil cover with Pam...layered sauce, pasta/ricotta, sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, pasta/ricotta, sauce, mozz., parm., and layered top with provolone!  very yummy!

Delicious!  The only changes I made was to substitute penne pasta for the ziti ( I didn't have any on hand)and I only made half and cooked it in an 8x8 pan. I just used regular Prego sauce. My husband absolutely loves his mom's lasagna - and he said this was better and requested that I add it to the "favorite" recipes!  Thank you Colleen! Update: I've made this with penne pasta and ziti, and I actually prefer the penne.  It's not a huge difference, but the sauce sticks to the ridges of the penne, while it tends to slide right off of the ziti.  Still delicious either way!  Just make sure you cover the pan while baking or it will dry out.

This is easy to make, but man does it taste rich!  Very filling.  It would be great as a meal served for guests and it does make a lot.  We are a family of 3 so we'll have lots of leftovers.  Tastes like lasagna, but faster to make.  I used sausage instead of beef and it was great.

Good, simple recipe. As others did, I switched a few layers to allow the sauce to reach the bottom layer of pasta. Also, I used ground turkey instead of beef. Not quite as tasty, but healthier. A final note about the pan size: it's a tight squeeze, but once I had the second layer of pasta in, I pushed down on everything, which seemed to compress things enough for the final layers. Of course, you could just use a bigger pan...

I really liked this recipe, because I am not a huge fan of ricotta, but I appreciate its purpose!  I did mix the sour cream with the pasta just for the ease of it and so it would mix well.  This is a great recipe and I realized I need to start making it in a bigger pan!:)

I love making this ziti, however, I mix my noodles with the meat, sauce and sour cream before I bake it.  I hate layering it because some noodles never get any sauce.    Once I coat all the noodles I add half of them to the baking dish, add a layer of cheeses, then add the other half of noodles and top again with cheese.  Really yummy!

I followed the reviews adding spices and sauted garlic to the sauce, layering the sauce with the noodles to soak, and covering while baking...I halved the recipe and it turned out really good!  I will make it again!

Since I was making enough of this to feed 50, I mixed (instead of layering) all the ingredients except the parm, which I did sprinkle on the top.  Otherwise, I made per the recipe.  So easy and delish!

This was ok.  It was a basic recipe that needs to be tweaked.  I used half ricotta and half sour cream and fresh parm.  I also added some fresh basil and topped with more when served.

Excellent recipe! I took the advice to add some sauce on top of the ziti, and it came out perfect! I've made this recipe three times now and it's always a huge hit.
Recipe update: I'm STILL making this ziti and it's delicious! Make sure you mix the sauce and the ziti so it doesn't get dry, and you'll be delighted with the result. 
I bought sliced mozzarella this time and tried that on top, it was really good and looked nicer than the shredded mozzarella.

This is a very good dish, and pretty easy to put together. I had to use a different kind of pasta, because I couldn't find ziti at the store. The next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 pound of pasta. Reading the other reviews helped also. Cover before baking. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

I loved this recipe. I tried it without believing the reports about the quantity. I was proved wrong. This recipe does indeed serve 10. Wow it is a cheap and easy recipe to feed the family for a couple of meals.

This didn't do it for me.  I love baked ziti, but I don't know what it is that I didn't care for.  I followed the directions.  I felt like it needed some zest or something.  I'm wondering if it was the sour cream.  I don't know, just different to me.

We followed the recipe exactly as written.  It wasn't bad.  I don't think the sour cream added much, next time we'll try it with low fat ricotta.  I will say, though, that it tasted better the next day as leftovers.

Loved it!!  So easy and very tasty! I made two very small changes.  I mixed the noodles with the sauce and cover it with foil.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was awesomeness!  It's a bit heavy and rich so I don't make it often but when I do there are NO leftovers :)

Good recipe, pretty basic stuff but hearty and tasty.  I suppose it goes without saying, but your choice of jarred pasta sauce will make or break this recipe.  As long you choose a favorite, you're just making regular meat pasta and layering it with a little cheese.  No brainer!  I made the recipe as written.  After trying it with the sour cream, I think next time I will go back to my old lasagna stand by and use small curd cottage cheese (or ricotta) mixed with an egg for the filling.  The sour cream was good and easy, but I prefer my "lasagna" MY way :-)  Again, very basic, pretty easy, and plenty tasty (with the right sauce).

I made this recipe as written with one change.  I used minced onions instead of the fresh chopped onions as my kids are a little picky.  It was the best!  Everyone asked for seconds and thirds which is unheard of in my house.  Can't wait for the leftovers!

Rated as 4 stars because I made a couple changes. I am not a big fan of sour cream, so I substituted ricotta instead. Also, I sauteed the hamburger with onion and garlic. Instead of layering the sauce and pasta, I mixed it all together before baking. Very easy, flavors were great, easy dish and had tons of leftovers!

This recipe is phenomenal.  Do as others suggested and be sure to add the sauce on top of the bottom layer of noodles so they don't dry out.  I have three sons and a husband who are always thrilled to see me pull this out of the oven.  I've never gotten anything less than rave reviews from anyone who's eaten it.  I've also never witnessed anyone eat just one serving!   Thank you Colleen!

Made 1/2 recipe in an 8 X 8 baking dish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a little garlic to the onions and meat.  Very simple recipe (5*), very pleasant cooking bouquet (5*) and a very tasty flavor (4-1/2*). Thank you B. Smith.

Love it! I agree with most other commenter, you want to cover this dish so it doesn't dry out in the oven, and either put some sauce on the bottom or mix the noodles with sauce before layering so the sauce oozes through the entire dish. Super tasty!

This definatly was good! I made a few changes in the way I layered it and cut down on the sour cream. I think had I not I would have given this 5 stars. With that being said here is what I did: I halved the recipe (was only cooking for two) used about 1/3 cup sour cream (half would've been 3/4) used Barilla's Baking sauce and layered as follows. Half of the ziti, half sauce, prov. cheese, sour cream. Other half ziti, sauce and so on. Next time, and they're DEFINATLY will be a next time I will layer as directed exept the top layer will do sauce first then cheese. And of course you must baked covered! Yuuuum!! My fiance said it was SOOOO GOOD, and he is the HARDEST to please! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is a great one! I added a bit more provolone cheese. The only thing I changed, was adding spices. In the meat I used garlic minced, oregano, and sea salt. (to taste) I did simmer the sauce, which turned out great. I would recommend this to anyone looked to make a quick dish for the family or a potluck occasion.

Very good and makes a lot.  Enough for leftovers for lunch and diner for my family or 3.  I use cottage cheese instead of sour cream when making this.  I find I don't like the sour cream tatse in it.

I followed this recipe pretty explicitly. I had never had baked ziti but the two Italians I made it for enjoyed it. It did come out a bit watery. And it's probably common knowledge to everyone else, but brown the onions before the beef.

If you make this ziti, be prepared to share the recipe with everyone you serve it to!  This is perfect to make for large gatherings and parties.  You can make it ahead of time and then pop it in the oven when guests arrive.  This is an absolutely a fabulous dish!

Very good - ironically this recipe was on the back of the Safeway box of Ziti I bought....The only difference was that Safeway version said to cover for 20 minutes, then uncover for last ten minutes.  Also, I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream and it was excellent.

LOVE it! I've made it three or four times now. The last time I took the advice of others and placed the sauce on the noodles and you MUST cover with tin foil before baking. This made all the difference. Easily one of my favorite recipes now.

This recipe gets a five with a few alterations. I followed several reccommendations by other reveiwers. I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic with the hamburger and onion. Also added some oregano to the meat. I added 1 pound of ricotta cheese and an egg to the noodles. I put a little sauce on the bottom of the pan and layered 1/2 the noodles, then 6 slices of provolone then 1/2 the sauce then repeated the layer. Put slices of mozzarella on the top. This was very good and wonderful reheated. I served with home made bread sticks and salad.

Sorry, but I wasn't as impressed as others with this recipe.  Guess I'm spoiled having grown up in an Italian neighborhood.  I thought this was rather bland and ho hum.

We just finished having this for dinner and it was really good. I made the recipe as stated, only using a bag of shredded Italian Blend instead of mozzarella and freshly shredded Parmesan. I use Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce (from the site) and tweak to what I'm in the mood for. The sour cream was good, but I think I like ricotta better. I needed to use up some sour cream anyway so opted to try it this way as written. I'm not sure it was the "best" but it was very good this way!  I just changed my rating to 5 stars... I have this all the time now. I did sub the ricotta and actually like sour cream better, so 5 stars and "the best" it is!

Excellent recipe. The only thing I do different is mix the sour cream into the bottom layer of ziti. I usually use Paul Newman's spaghetti sauce. My family loves this recipe and it freezes well (when there is some left over). Do cover it so it won't dry out.

So quick and easy yet delish. Adding sour cream was great. Do mix the sauce with noodles to avoid dryed out ziti. I cut recipe in half for four people. Will make again!

Husband really liked, but I didn't like the sour cream in the baked ziti.  I added italian seasoning and garlic to the sauce, but it still didn't have enough zip.

I just made this recipe tonight. I had tried other recipes and they were tasty, but this one really made my guests happy. I loved the sour cream as opposed to ricotta seeing as I am not a fan of ricotta... I sauteed minced garlic and chopped onion as well as green and red bell peppers before browning my beef and adding a little kielbasa. I did mix the sauce and the pasta together in the layering process, and it stayed siper moist and turned out extra cheesy and creamy. This recipe is definetly a keeper!

I have made this many times throughout the past few months--each time without the meat. Everyone has loved it! It's a perfect adult and child pleaser! It was so good my family of four finished all 10 servings of it by lunch the next day. A must try!

I've made this recipe SEVERAL times and every time I get rave reviews. A few times I've made this for my husbands work for lunch/dinner and its ALWAYS a hit. I did change it up a bit per another reviewers suggestion. I mix the noodles with some of the sauce and do the bottom layer, then the cheese/sour cream, then another layer of the noodles mixed with sauce and pour the rest of the sauce over the top. WONDERFUL recipe. I've never served this to anyone who wasn't a fan!

This ziti was excellent! My husband doesn't tolerate Ricotta cheese very well, so I was thrilled to find this recipe! I will definitely make it again. If cooking for a few people, I would recommend making 2 smaller pans and freezing one to use at a later date.

I made this with ground turkey instead of beef because I don't eat beef at all. It turned out really well. I doubled everything and made an extra casserole and froze that. It was fantastic both times.

I'd give it six stars if that was an option. My husband doesn't like ricotta cheese so the provolone and sour cream were great substitutes. I cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us and there was at least 3 or 4 servings left that I passed on to my working daughter.

This was great! Gave it four stars because I made the following changes: used hot Italian sausage, used half ricotta cheese and half sour cream, didn't really measure it out. Provolone cheese is a must! Made the night before we went skiing and ate it after we got off the slopes, got rave reviews and feed 8 people! Thanks for a great recipe.

I had to use a mixture of big and small penne pasta in this, which worked just fine, I split the sour cream with cream cheese, used 3/4lb ground beef, 3/4lb mild italian sausage, added chopped garlic to the meat with the onions and it was FANTASTIC!!!! I will make it exactly like that all the time, whole family gobbled it up.  Defenitely used more than 2 tablespoons of parm, that is for sure!

I'm not really a good cook and I was designated to bring this dish to a family gathering. I googled baked ziti and this was the easiest looking recipe that popped up so I went with it. The whole family loved it so much most of them called later for the recipe. I think it's a great tasting, simple to make meal the whole family will love!

I didn't have a lot of mozarella and no parmesan, so I used cheddar and monterrey jack.  I agree with the others that said ricotta cheese is dry and doesn't add much flavor. The sour cream adds a nice tangy twist to the dish.  It was really good!

Excellent. I made no changes! I will definitely make this again! Remember to cover with foil before baking so it won't dry out.

This recipe was EXCELLENT. Easy to make, and very filling. Perfect for a potluck, or having people over to eat.   I'm a sauce lover, but even I thought there was a bit too much spaghetti sauce. Next time I'll eyeball the amount I need, and save the extra for dipping the bread. I will probably add a cut up bell pepper to the sauce next time as well.  I served this with a salad and Texas Cheese Toast, and it was a wonderful meal. Everyone including my very picky son had a second helping. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was very easy to make.  I, like everyone else changed a few things. I shredded colby cheese over the top and used white american cheese instead of provolone. (my kids dont like provolone)and it turned out really well. It was easy,tasty, and we enjoyed it.

This was so yummy! It makes ALOT, so invite your friends! I made a few changes based on others suggestions by mixing the finished sauce and meat mixture with the ziti so that when it baked the sauce was disbursed evenly. I used two different types of sauce, 5 cheese Bertelloni and Sockarooni. Added some italian seasoning, minced garlic, seasoned salt with the beef/onion mixture. The sour cream was sooooo much more tasty then traditional ricotta. I also sprayed my 10x14 glass dish with olive oil cooking spray rather then butter. Eat up!

This is a great recipe. I agree with other reviews it make a BIG dish so please keep an extra baking dish on hand if you find your 9 x13 to be too small. I am going to try this recipe with a deep dish 9 x13 to see if I can fit it all in. I must have gotten lucky because the first time I made this dish I did not cover it at all and I had no problems. However, I will cover it this time. Do mix the sauce in with the noodles. Great flavor.

THIS RECIPE IS TERRIFIC AS WRITTEN, but, of course I added garlic cloves to the ground beef and I stirred in fresh parsley and shredded parm cheese to the sour cream.  OMG!  Too good for words!

I just made this recipe and it was great. And for all the people that think the sour cream is a little too bland, add about a 1 1/2 teaspoons of "McCormick's" California Style garlic powder with parsley and about a teaspoon of oregano(dried). Thats the only change i made and it came out FANTASTIC!!!

This was absolutely fabulous!  Loved it, loved it, loved it!  The only thing I did differently was cut the sour cream down to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 and it was just fine.  The family had second and third helpings... made my day!

Super delicious and so easy to make.
This recipe filled my 9/13 inch pan to the top, but I did not use all of the sauce, It was away too much, next time I will only use 1 and 1/2 jar of pasta sauce.
I followed other reviewers advice and change the layering order to pasta, sauce, cheese, cream cheese on so forth..

My family gives this 5 stars, but since i made it i'm rating it 4 stars.  It was very good.  I think next time i'll make it with ricotta and half sour cream.  The sour cream gave it a nice kick, but it was missing that italian taste of the ricotta.  Good recipe though!  Defintely going into my permanent recipe book.

Sept 2009 Update - Made for family gathering, made extra just in case & still had tons of leftovers for family to take home. Added some Italian Sausage w/the beef this time but otherwise stuck to the listed ingredients.  It was loved by all.   12/26/08 - This made a ton for leftovers at work.  Great recipe, all I did was add more sauce than called for and mixed the noodles w/some of the sauce (no meat) before layering.  Other than that I followed it exactly w/the sour cream & meat.  Loved it.  Husband usually doesn't like Italian, and said he wants it again.  Thank you.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, and everyone always requests it for special occassion dinners.  We had it for our anniversary last night!  The only thing I do differently is use the whole tub of sour cream (2 cups), the entire 8 oz packages of provolone and mozzarella.  I've read reviews about using ricotta instead of sour cream, but I love the creaminess of the sour cream, and with all the extra cheese I put on there, I think the ricotta would be overkill.

After reading some reviews about too much pasta sauce, too watery, etc, I wanted to point out what I use.  I always use the Great Value brand of spaghetti sauce "Onions and Garlic".  The amount of food this makes does overflow out of the pan, but last night I tried dividing it into two smaller dishes, and that worked perfectly.

I took the advice of several commentors and substituted ricotta w/ egg for the sour cream.  After I did it I remembered a similar recipe I made with smoked mozarella and the sour cream is what gives it such a nice kick.  I'll be making it again but definitely not with the ricotta (really dry and just not enough flavor).  Otherwise great recipe - my kids loved it!

This was really good, I just thought it needed a little more spice.  Next time I think I will add some Italian seasoning.  Followed other suggestions and mixed the pasta with the light sour cream, used light provolone and didn't have mozzerrella so I used the Kraft Natural block with white chedder,parmessan and swiss.  It was really good!  Will definetly make again!

Very, very good recipe for Baked Ziti.  I used to work in an Italian restaurant and this is better than the one we made there.  I had to sub a few things as I had some trouble finding true ziti pasta and (affordable) mozzarella cheese here in Poland-but instead I used penne pasta and gouda cheese.  This was a big hit for my six person family, and the recipe made enough for everyone-that includes three adult men, 2 women, and one teenager girl.  Thanks for sharing!

this is delish!  Usually my ziti comes out pretty dry and boring, but this recipe is great.  I used fresh mozzarella cut into slices instead of shredded mozarella and I would highly recommend that.  Yum

This recipe is definitely 5 star material.  I decided to surprise my girlfriend with this recipe when she came home from work--she loved it!  I added a few small variations to the recipe itself, however.  For one, even though the recipe does not say it, I recommend you bake it covered.  Other than that, I decided to change the layer variation a little.  Instead of starting with Ziti Noodles, I started with a Ziti/Sauce mixture so that there would be appropriate moisture at the bottom.  I also added italian sausage to my meat sauce.  I recommend the sausage for anyone who likes a nice kick to their sauce.  Other than that, amazing recipe!

Overall it was a great dish.  Easy to make, easy to assemble.  Wasn't sure what to expect taste wise with the sour cream, but I really enjoyed the tang.  Kids ate it up, hubby not so much.  Tons of leftovers which I froze.  I'll most likely make this agian for a larger crowd, but will also try another recipe in hope to please the entire family!

This recipe was soooo good!  I have been making lasagna homemade for years with a ricotta cheese mixture and I was so surprised to see how the sour cream/provolone combo turned out.  I thought it was much more creamier and not as dry as if you would use ricotta cheese mixture.  From now on when I make lasagna, I think I will steal that trick.  It's a good one!

This recipe ROCKS!  I was a little concerned about using sour cream (and not ricotta).  But it added a great zing to it.  I highly recommed this recipe and the kids (8 & 4)loved it.  I had to use reconstituted onions, but no other changes made... again, wonderful, thanks for the recipe.

LOVED this recipe!! It was SUPER easy to make and delish!! I followed the directions, just added a lil garlic w/ the ground beef. I used a lil bit more cheese and I used rigatoni noodles instead of ziti. My family loved it. Served it w/ garlic bread. We even have enough for the next night!! I will be making this again!!

I have found the secret to moist baked ziti! Sour cream! Thank you for this great recipe, my ziti was very good and not dried out. I used a little bit of ricotta because I like the texture and I used the Italian 6 cheese blend shredded cheese because I had it on hand. I baked it covered for 30 min, very easy and quick. Will def. make again!

Ohhhhh such a good recipe!!! I decided to use 1 lb of Ground beef and 1/2 lb of mild sausage. I also used 2- 1 lb containers of pasta sauce, added oregeno, parsley, and a heaping spoonful of minced garlic. I thought it was important to keep the pasta moist so I layered 1/2 the pasta first and mixed it with 1/2 of the sauce/ meat mixture. I used extra provolone cheese... probably 3 oz more than called for. Don't skip the sour cream... it seems weird but it mixes with the provolone cheese and makes a creamy white sauce layer in the middle of the ziti. The last change I made was using a whole 8 oz block of mozzerella cheese. This recipe will be made all the time in my house... the family just loved it!!!

So yummy and definitely a comfort food.  Is a bit time-consuming but makes a lot - enough for yourself and to share or freeze. Best served with Pepperidge Farm mozzarella bread.

This was very good. I used a pound of ricotta, left out the provolone and sour cream. I also had to use rotini because there was no ziti at the store. I served this to conpany with french baguettes and green beans. Tastes similar to lasagna, and we have a lot of leftovers! I will try this again with spicy sausage. Thanks!

This was very good and my family enjoyed it. Like some of the other cooks I made a few changes which worked well.
I used 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream and added an egg and some dried oregano and basil.

This was phenomenal.  I grated some spinach and added it to my mozarella along with an egg and some cottage cheese, then layered it noodles, provolone, sour cream, mozarella mixture, sacue.  This was great!  My three year old never knew there was spinach in it.  I did cover it too.

Yummo!  I basically followed this recipe as listed, but added some garlic.  I was unsure of the sour cream but interestingly it looked like ricotta when it was cooked and tasted delicious.  Next time I am going to try it with soy "ground beef" for a vegetarian reduced fat taste.  Awesome crowd pleaser!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was fabulous! I did change a few things, I used 2 cups italian shredded cheese mixture,added about 1 cup of ricotta cheese to the sour cream, added canned mushrooms and sliced black olives. I planned ahead as other people said it makes alot and i made 2 extra containers to freeze at the same time. Great inexpensive recipe to make at least 4-5 meals. Love it! Thanks !

This is an easy take-to-others meal.  I usually spice up the sauce mixture a bit, then do the first layer as sauce/noodle combo.  For the top layer, I pre-mix the remaining sauce & noodles with the mozzarella cheese.

I thought this recipe had a great base for a baked pasta.  I made a few changes though after reading others reviews.  Instead of sour cream I used a pound of ricotta mixed with spinach, garlic, red pepper, garlic, and 8 oz. shredded mozarella chesse.  I also subsituted turkey italian sausage for the ground beef.  I layered as follows: 
ladel of sauce, half of ziti, half of sauce, ricotta mixture, ziti, rest of sauce, slices of provolone cheese.  It turned out great!

This was sooo good! I loved the layers, but instead of sour cream I used Ricotta cheese and it was great!! This recipe makes a lot, and so I ate the leftovers for a few days and they still tasted great. I will definately be making this again!

Tasty and easy!  (We also used Italian sausage instead of groud beef).  There are only 2 of us so next time we will make 2 and freeze 1.  

This is so good it will replace our long-standing lasagna recipe.

This was very good...even better with my additions of Marsala sweet wine, chopped garlic, onions, basil, oregano, and black pepper.  I also made a mix of 50/50 sourcream and ricotta.  Baked covered for 2/3 of the time and uncovered for the last 1/3.  Delicious!

Excellent! This was so tasty and easy.  My husband loved this dish.  The only change I made was to add 1 pd of sausage, on top of the beef.  So meaty, chunchy and tasty.  the sour cream sure makes this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Thanks for a great recipe! Definitely a standard at our house. I love how versatile the jars of sauce are and that I can add pretty much any spice, herb or vegetable to this to make it my own. Thanks again!

This is a favorite recipe in our house.  HINT:Layer 1/2 ziti, 1/2 sauce, sliced provolone,then spread the sour cream over the sliced cheese. I use less sour cream.  Also, if you can shop at HEB the sauce that makes this recipe is HEB brand SPICY RED PEPPER pasta sauce.

I really didn't like the idea of sour cream in my baked ziti, but the good rating made me try it. Absolutely the best baked ziti I have ever had.

Love this!  Soooo good.  You must try it! It makes so much and you can add things to the sauce to spice it up a bit but I have made this about 10 times plus and it is my ultimate go to recipe for big groups!  I always add extra spices to my sauce but everything else is awesome!

It will be nice and moist with cheesey goodness ;)

I don't know, this just didn't turn out right.  I made it because the picture looked like it would be very good, but mine didn't look like the picture at all and the beef didn't seem to fit - it was really bland.  Aside from the way it looked and the beef being bland, it tasted OK for a quick casserole.

Nice flavor and texture with the sour cream, but I prefer the recipe with more cheese, ricotta or some mix, instead of the SC.
Also, this recipe did not fit in a 9x13 dish for me.  Had remains that would have been overflowing.  Maybe because I had to make do with rigatoni instead of the smaller ziti... but a pounds a pound... eh?  :)

Loved this recipe. Easy, simple, and most of all tasty! The only change I made was leaving out the meat because of vegetarian guests. I'd recommend this for a good hearty dinner at home.

For the first time making this,I followed the recipe exactly.I thought it tasted fairly good.As for the rest of the family,their only complaint was not caring for the sour cream.When I made this the second time I replaced the sour cream with ricotta cheese.With that,everyone was quite pleased.

This recipe is amazing.  I made a couple of changes for healthier options.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, lite sour cream, and low fat cheeses.  I also used the previously recommended garlic and herb spagetti sauce. It still turned out incredible and you couldn't taste the difference with the turkey subsitution.  I can't wait to make this again.  I also cut the recipe in half since there were only 2 of us eating and we still had leftovers the next day; the leftovers were as good as the original!

This was good and easy. My "picky" daughter loved it. I also put the sauce on the noodles then the cheese and sour cream. The next time I'll try mixing the sour cream with the sauce as it was hard to spread.

This is sooo good! Out of all the things I make, this is my husband's favorite!! I added garlic, italian seasoning and fresh basil to the sauce. The first time I made it and followed the directions exactly...it was just missing something. I also made it once with all mozzarella since the store I went to was out of provolone and I couldn't even tell the difference. This is sooo good!

OH MY GAWD! I am a fan of baked ziti, and this is by far one of the best baked ziti I have ever had!  I used ground turkey (a lot healthier and cheaper!) instead of ground beef. Browned it with the onions, added 2 cloves chopped up garlic and seasoned it with italian seaoning, ground pepper and Lawry's seasoned salt. Then I added the spaghetti sauce...I only had one jar instead of two. And I layered in a baking dish as followed: 1/2 of the cooked penne rigate pasta (oh I used a 12 oz bag), 1/2 of the sauce, provolone, sour cream, ADDED cottage cheese (about 6 tbsp), pasta, sauce, and the italian blend shredded cheese (the 6 type one), and then parmesian cheese(i only had the powdered). Baked it for 35 mins and came out wonderful! My fiance hates cottage cheese and loved this recipe! he didnt just have seconds, he had thirds! this is now my favorite dish to make and serve! thank you thank you thank you!!!!

NOTE: The cooking time of 1 hour and 45 minutes at the top of the recipe contradicts the 30 minute baking time at the bottom of the recipe. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out just fine.

My family enjoyed this delicious alternative to my always well-received recipe for baked ziti - I thought this was much lighter in taste and creamier with a more interesting texture, thanks to the sour cream. 
I also sauted one finely chopped onion and added it to the tomato sauce for extra flavor (so it wasn't so bland).

My whole family LOVED this recipe! I did not use the prov. cheese (substituted extra mozz.) and it was soooo yummy! Kids love it, husband loves it (and he doesn't like spag. sauce). It does make quite a bit so be prepared to eat leftovers for a few days! Wasn't a problem here though...we ate this the following day for lunch and dinner! Thanks!

This is a really good recipe, made it exactly as the recipe stated. I did think it was weird to have sour cream in it but it turned out delish! thank you for the recipe. I have tried it multiple times and it is as good with cottage cheese or sour cream.

The intro to this dish is right on the money. It truely is the hit of the household. I am glad I ran across this rendition and so far have been asked for the recipe by all who have had it. Make it tonight! *Side note, I used Penne the first time making it as Ziti wasn't available in my small town and I will continue to use Penne everytime.

This turned out okay.  It really didn't taste much better than when I make spaghetti and I was hoping to have more of a wow factor.  (the first time this gets 3 stars, as leftovers it gets 4.  It's one of those dishes that actually tastes better the next day)

This recipe was good. I had to use a bigger baking dish (12x14 I think) as a 9x13 wasn't near big enough! This recipe makes a ton and lasts for several days in the fridge.

This is delicious and easy, much easier than lasagna, with much of the same taste.  I put my sour cream in a pastry bag which makes it easy to spread evenly.

Phenomenal recipe.  I've never had the sour cream in a baked pasta - but it was that extra something.  This has replaced any and all baked pasta recipes in my binder!

Yummy...I did 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup ricotta cheese(needed to use it up before it expired).  I also shredded my provolone cheese since I bought a block of it.  I layered starting with sauce at the bottom to avoid drying out the noodles(as others also wrote) and ended with a layer of mozzerella cheese since I like mine to have the cheese on top.  I also used FRESH parmesan and romano cheeses (really makes a HUGE difference to use fresh).  I never though sour cream would go well in this but it certainly did.  I did make one batch with meat and one without and they were both equally great.

This was pretty good. I loved the cheese slices melted into the layers. I also like the saucy-ness the sour cream gave it, but I didnt like the taste of the sour cream. I may try adding a little cottage cheese or ricotta cheese to the mix next time.

We enjoyed this very much. I reduced rec to 1/2 and baked in 9x9 pan. As others suggested I sprayed pan with Pam and started layers with meat sauce. No problem with sticking. I used only provogne cheese. Baked for 45 min covered. So good. Thank you so much.

very good. I did use a low fat sour cream and I suggest not doing so as you really can taste the low fat "after taste".

I added some fresh spinach to the meat while browing and while cooking for just my immediate family, I use turkey meat and whole wheat ziti, but when cooking for guests I used red meat and regular ziti. Good but not OMG good.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  I like to use hot Italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef. I also use an entire container of sour cream.  This is a staple in our house.

Another great recipe! I took advise from other reviews and combined the meat, sauce and ziti then layer like lasagna with sour cream and cheese.  It does make a lot so I cut the recipe in half-perfect for my family of 5!  Will make this again!

Our whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated however I only had one jar of spaghetti sauce and it would have been much better with two.  I will make it that way from now on.  I may also experiment with low fat cheese and/or whole wheat pasta to make it a little healthier.  Over all it was an excellent recipe.  Thanks Colleen!

This is excellent!! I added a bunch of spices to the meat as it cooked. (more garlic, italian herbs, onion powder, red pepper flakes) and used other reviewers advice of mixing the pasta right in the sauce/meat mixture rather than layering. I used penne pasta because I wasn't paying attention in the store, lol and it turned out great.
I made this a day ahead and kept it covered in the fridge until the next evening. The only thing I will do next time is make more of the cheese/sour cream mixture to make that layer bigger. I used fat free Ricotta and fat free sour cream and you'd never know it :)
Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this a few times. It is always good, but last time I used ground lamb instead of beef and it was delicious! I also use two 8x8 pans instead of one big one. Then I freeze one pan.  I thaw before cooking and of course cover with foil to keep moist while cooking. It freezes beautifully! Update: I now use the meat sauce from The World's Best Lasagna on this website for the ziti instead of the canned spaghetti sauce. Awesome!

Awesome!  I fed this to my whole family. The kids all loved it and asked for more.  My husband like it overall, but asked me not to put provolone cheese (just more mozzerella cheese) next time.  Either make to pans and freeze one or plan on feeding A LOT of people with this meal.  Loved it.

So good!  I made a few changes, I left out the onion (cause I didn't have one), and provolone cheese and also put the sauce directly on the ziti and then the cheese next as others suggested.  I will make it again.

This recipe was GREAT!  We made it vegetarian style without the ground meat, and like others on the list I cut the sour cream down to 1/2 cup or so, and added a cup of ricotta and added an egg and dried parsley (I mixed the ricotta, egg, parsley, and parmesan together and layered this over the provalone).  I also put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the dish to add moisture and a little more tomato flavor to the bottom noodles.  My husband raved over this, and it will definitely be added to my frequent recipes list.  I'll add meat, or spinach, or extra garlic, or a layer of pesto and pine nuts for variations.  This comes out a bit like lasagne, but easier and less finicky than lasagne noodles.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This is a great meatless dish.  I made it just as directed except halved the recipe and still had leftovers.  I'm basing my rating on what the dish was.  I really wanted it to be more like lasanga, but if you want something like that make sure you include extra ingredients like Ital. sausage, etc... and voila!

This was really, really good.  I am giving it 4 stars just because I did change it up a bit.  I used rigatoni.  I also used Turkey Bolognese that is an excellent recipe from Rachael Ray's daytime TV show, I think honestley, that was the key as to why it was so tasty I love that sauce!!!I make a big batch and freeze some.  I used low fat everything.  I mixed about a cup of light sour cream with a heaping 1/2 cup of ricotta.  I had some prepared pesto from another recipe and I hate for anything to go to waste so I mixed that with the sour cream and ricotta along with a handful or grated parmesan.  I also mixed the sauce with the noodles verses pouring it over as a layer.  On top I added reduced fat Sargento 4 italian cheese and also added grated parmesan.  This makes a lot but a great meal to carry over for a couple of days.  This was really good.

Here are, I hope, a few helpful notes on this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, except to substitute half ricotta cheese for the full amount of sour cream.  As noted by many others this recipe makes a lot and the sour cream makes it very rich which also makes it difficult to eat a large portion.  I believe it serves 10 - 12, unless you are accustomed to eating larger portions and are not having side dishes such as salad and bread. Some reviewers who have not liked this dish have commented on the "tangy" flavor of the sour cream.  I didn't notice this, probably because I used half ricotta, half sour cream.  That being said, the sour cream does tend to blend with the spaghetti sauce which gives it an overall cream tomato sauce look and taste.  If you are a straight tomato sauce purist you might not like this recipe.

Loved this~ made it for my son-in-law and daughter for dinner the night they brought baby Lucy home from the hospital. It made enough to freeze for another time. I think the different cheeses lended an awesome flavor. Great recipe, and easy.

This was great, much cheesier tasting than my normal baked ziti.  I used sausage instead of ground beef, and it worked out well.

I was a little hesitant to try the recipe , did'nt have provolone.  Substituted Monterey Jack, turned out great.  I will try it again when I buy some provolone but it was pretty good with the other cheese.

Very tasty and easy to make.  My sauce turned out a bit watery, though ... maybe I didn't simmer long enough.  Very yummy, I will use this recipe again.

This ziti is BOMB!!!  I made it for the first time for my Winter Solstice dinner, and everyone raved (everyone ALSO took all my leftovers).  The only thing I do different is mix the sour cream, sauce and pasta instead of layering, omit meat because I'm a vegetarian, and use all mozz caz I'm cheap and lazy, don't wanna buy the prov.  LOL!  I thought to review it because I'm making it again tonight (with whole wheat pasta).

Pretty good, and not difficult to make. I think next time I'll add some garlic to the onions, add a little less sauce, and a llittle more cheese, and maybe some basil and oregano to the sour cream. Thanks.

My 16 y.o. son asked me, out of the blue, to make baked ziti - he'd recently had some at a youth group dinner.  I'd never made it before so I used this one and it was a HUGE hit!  I did make a few tweeks - I used (2) lbs. of ground beef, nixed the onions and added 2 T. oregano -the Barilla Marinara is used was sweet, but a bit too blah without it.  Thank you for this new family dinner idea!

I'm so happy that this turned out so well. I'm never going back to my old boring recipe. It comes together so quickly and is great for potlucks. Lots of compliments! I took the advice of another reviewer and some of the sauce in with the pasta before layering it.  Delicious!

The sour cream in this recipe is a great sub for ricotta, except with an extra zing. I was pleasantly surprised.

This was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect. My whole family (including two toddlers) loved it. We served it with broccoli and garlic bread. The sour cream gave it a little zing that ricotta wouldn't have. Loved It!

This is probably my favorite recipes on this website.  The only thing I do differently is to make it in a jelly roll pan, because it makes so much and it usually runs over a traditional 9x13 pan.  All of my daughters friends request this dish when they come over.  I can't make it enough for my family.  Thanks!

I didn't care for the sour cream and the meat was bland.  The second time I made it I used ricotta instead of the sour cream along with Italian sauage and I would rate it 5 stars made this way.

My entire family LOVED this recipe.  I have 3 kids and everyone gets excited when I say I am making this and they even want to help.  It doesn't get any better than that!!

This is what my dad would call "lazy mans lasagne". I have been making this for quite a few years now and have always gotten rave reviews! To make it a little healthier I have recently started to use ground turkey and multi-grain (NOT wheat!) pasta and is just as incredible! My husbands absolute favorite...and the kids love it too. My #1 allrecipes favorite!

This was so awesome, in fact, so good that I finally registered on All Recipes to review this.  Used penne instead of ziti, really doesn't matter.  Used turkey sausage instead of hamburger, added really good flavor (just 2 links).  Definately use pam and cover with foil.  I really messed up on the layering, and it was still delicious.  Makes a HUGE amount.  It was fabulous, better than a certain Italian restarant chain's baked ziti.  Lots of sauce, love it!!

A hit!  I'm not much of a cook but I took on this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner with the family (and the first time I've made dinner for the family).  Everybody raved about it!  Even my picky brother-in-law (who always has an excuse why not to eat at family gatherings) helped himself to some!

I did eyeball many measurements, using as much sauce, cheese and sour cream as it looked like it needed.  I also used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 mild bulk sausage.  Used some extra provolone on the top, and split up the sour cream so that half was in the middle and half on top.

Hubby says this one is a keeper!

I made this for a church potluck yesterday and it was mostly gone by the end of the meal.  I dunno - I think it's borderline sacrilege to make ziti without ricotta.  However, I didn't have ricotta and wouldn't have thought of putting in the sour cream, so while I think in general, I'll stick to ziti with ricotta, this one wasn't too bad.

I had a party of 25 people over for Thanksgiving so I wanted to make something easy and fulfilling to feed an army. I made this recipe with half ricotto and half sour cream and it turned out great! Usually when people go for seconds, there's a little bit of everything on their plate, but this Thanksgiving they went back for seconds and even thirds for the baked ziti alone! Thanks!! Will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic!!!  I made it ahead, and put it in the frig till time to bake.  I mixed a little sauce with the pasta, then put a layer of meat, then the cheeses, then pasta, meat and the rest of the cheese.  I goofed and forgot the sour cream so then had to squeeze it in right before baking and it was still fantastic!!!  Wonderful recipe.  We'll be making this for years to come!

Like others, I mixed my sauce with my pasta, then layered as directed. Yumm-o! The key is the sour cream and plenty of it! I like it more than ricotta. This is easier than lasagna and, in my opinion, much better!

This was an excellent recipe and OH so very good!!  At first I thought it may taste alot like lasagna but it didn't.  It had it's own very special flavor. Even the hubby, who doesn't care too much for lasagna,and after having the first bite said "O boy, this is really good. That in itself should give it a much higher rating than 5 stars. 
I couldn't find any ziti pasta so used Tortiglioni pasta, but this would be good with pretty well any kind.  Thanks for a wonderful recepe.

This recipe has a fantastic twist with the sour cream added into the layers. Baked Ziti is pretty much a common sense recipe in my house but the secret is the sour cream which isn't something I would have thought of before.  I had all of the ingredients on hand so I figured why not bake it for a quick easy dinner and I am really glad I tried it. The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat pasta instead of regular, italian sausage instead of hamburger, and fat free sour cream. I also added my own spices to the spagetti sauce cause I just always do that.

Loved this and so did my family!  I too was concerned about the sour cream, but it was great.  This does make a very ful 9 x 13, so you may want to place a jelly roll pan underneath for overflow.  I did cover with tinfoil for the first 20 minutes and uncovered for the last 10 minutes. THANKS!

I can only give this 4 stars because although my kids LOVED the stuff, my husband and I were left hungry.  There was something about the sour cream and cheese mixture that didn't sit well with us.  I will make it again, though, but only make half the amount for my kids, and fix my husband and I something else.  It's VERY easy and quick to make, so I wouldn't feel like I was making 2 meals.

I have made this several times and it's always excellent.  I substitute ground turkey for the beef and I add 1 lb. of mild Italian saugage. I use a 15x10x2 baking dish. This is my go-to recipe when I have a large group coming over. I double the recipe and use a sheet pan. Simply delicious!!

We were very pleased with this recipe.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef.  A couple times I did not have provolone cheese so I used extra mozzarella instead.  Couldn't really tell the difference.  I have made this at parties before and have been asked for the recipe numerous times.  It has become a family favorite.

1. Whole Wheat Penne in place of Ziti
2. Fat Free Sour Cream
3. Fat Free Mozzerella
4. Ground Buffalo or Ground Turkey in place of beef
5. Pam spray in place of butter
6. Natural Spaghetti Sauce (variety of brands)

Even with these substitutions, my family RAVES over this.  The substitutions takes away most of the fat, but none of the taste and texture!  If you are a "Weight Watcher" you can easily figure out the points.  You get a whole lot of bang for your dieting buck with this one!

Mix some sauce with the pasta to keep it all moist.  Make sure to cover it with foil sprayed with Pam and bake until bubbly.  Then, let it sit for about 10 minutes to set up!

This is a staple in my household! I changed some of the preparation steps: boil the noodles and cook the meat/onions. (usually half an onion is enough) Mix all of it together with 2 full bottles of sauce into one big pot. Grease the pan and put half of the mixture in, layer with cheese. spoon in the other half, layer with cheese again. Every bite will have meaty cheesy saucy goodness! I also replace cottage cheese for ricotta if I'm going to the store anyways. (more authentic) Replacing the beef with Italian sausage is great for taste, but if you're going for health I've used ground turkey instead which is also delicious. (you can barely tell once everything else is mixed in)

Wonderful ziti recipe. I did not add the meat, i needed a meatless dish for a picnic and everyone loved it. This will be my new ziti recipe from now on.

This recipe was SERIOUSLY delicious!  The only change I made was I seasoned the meat with Italian seasoning, garlic powder and dried parsley and I added more Mozzarella and it was awesome.  My husband usually doen't like "spaghetti-like" dishes, but he ate 3 servings!!

Great recipe,and so easy to make your own.  I added tons of garlic and onion for flavor, and whatever seasonings I had in my cupboard. I used pasta shells because that's all I had.  Made tons of leftovers for lunch the next 2 days and even for dinner too!

This recipe is a huge hit with my boyfriend and his friends EVERY TIME! I did find it hard to spread the sour cream easily, so one thing that I do to make life easier is put the sour cream in a sandwich bag and snip the end, almost like I am piping for a cake.  The sour cream to spread evenly throughout the ziti while it is baking...I also add a small can of italian style stewed tomatoes (chopped up) and a small can of tomato sauce.  This is just my preference though, the recipe is still great as is

This is our favorite baked ziti recipe. Depending on what we have on hand, I've used ground beef, ground turkey or Italian sausage and it always turns out delicious!! The greatest joy was when my Italian Mother-in-Law was very impressed with this dish! I follow the recipe as is except I brown the ground beef or ground turkey with onions, minced garlic, Italian seasoning and some cayenne pepper for a wonderful flavor. I will try using part riccota and sour cream next time as some of the reviewers suggested. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive about using sour cream in this..however, I was quite impressed with the final result. It tasted really good! Next time I plan on using another reviewers suggestion and replace the sour cream with ricotta.    Even better the next day.

I used extra mozzerella to top this dish, but left everything else the same, except I left out the meat and used a spinach and cheese sauce I bought. Everyone loved, and the leftovers disappeared!!

This is one of my favorite pasta recipes.  I followed the advice of some others and stirred my pasta sauce, noodles and meat together to make sure that everything had a good coating of sauce.  I definitely think that makes a huge difference.  I really like that the recipe uses sour cream over ricotta cheese because I'm not a huge fan of ricotta.  I've made the recipe several times now and while it makes a ton I enjoy eating the leftovers.

Great recipe!  I made a couple of changes per other's suggestions.  I did mix some of the sauce with the noodles to help keep them moist.  I also used extra sauce.  One jar of Prego Traditional and two jars of Prego with Sausage and Garlic.  Yum.

This recipe was very easy, but I would exchange step 1 and 2 because my ziti was finished boiling before my meat was even browned.  It was very stressful!

This is a fantastic baked ziti recipe.  I have found that if I use one jar of sauce with the meat and one jar with the cooked pasta before assembling, the pasta does not dry out and the flavors blend a bit more.

LOVED this recipe, however, I agree with other reviews that as written it is a little bland.  I added a good deal of seasoning to my ground beef and quite a bit of garlic as well and altough I loved it, my husband said it was not very flavorful.  That being said, I will definitely make it again and play with the spices.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My hard-to-please crowd loved it!!  I lightened up the recipe by using light sour cream.  (The real stuff was not missed.)  I also left out the onion since onions upset my husband's stomach.  (Also not missed.)  Based on other's comments, I covered the dish while baking.  This is a great substitute recipe for those not crazy about lasagna with Ricotta (like my husband).  This recipe's a keeper!!!

This is a very good recipe, my family enjoyed it. It does make a lot. I agree with other users who advised to cover it. Additionally, place the pyrex on a cookie sheet to catch any spillage.

After reading other reviews I decided to add a little sauce in between the layers and on top to keep it from drying out.  The only other thing to to remember is to cover it when cooking.  I ran out of foil and the top was a little crunchy.  It made a good leftover as well.  I will be making this again and maybe next time with lasagna noodles.

excellent - i used penne because i didn't have ziti on hand - coated the pasta in the sour cream instead of the sour cream "layer" - keep the noodles soft and moist.

This wasn't my favorite baked pasta recipe, as I think the sour cream gave it a tang I didn't care for.  Tasted fine, but nothing special.

this the best ziti ever. I am not a cook, but I had my family over and they loved it.  They even asked for second.  I did not make any changes to the recipe, I left it as it is and it came out great.

Fabulous ziti!  I didn't have ziti noodles so I used penne.  I will never make lasagna again, this tastes just as good if not better and is so much easier!

Never made baked ziti before, and this was good!  It could use a little something though...maybe some red pepper flakes or some balsalmic vinegar to add some zip, but all in all, a keeper!  thanks for the post!

Very good recipe, however, next time I will cut down on the sauce (maybe 1 1/2 jars) because it was a bit too saucy.  I also only used 1 cup of sour cream.  Great substitute for lasagna -- same taste but less work!!

Here are my little personalizations to this excellent dish: for the sauces I used one 26 oz jar of Bertolli Italian Sausage Garlic and Romano along with one 26 oz jar of Classico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce. For the mozzarella, I used Sargento's Bistro Blend of mozzarella and asiago with roasted garlic.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I only added 1 cup of sour cream. I'm glad I did because 1 and 1/2 would have been too much. It turned out great...next time I will add even less sour cream.

I added equal parts ricotta and sour cream.  It was lent - so I took out beef and substituted eggplant and bell peppers to the sauce.  Very yummy!  The recipes sounds like it calls for a lot of sauce - but you really DO need that much!!

My family and I loved this recipe! My kids even ate it the next day and they usually will not eat left overs. I could not find Ziti Noodles, so I used Penne Noodles. I will definatley make this recipe more often.

Excellent! Easy, yet delicious. I have made this several times and my guests were so impressed they also used the recipe. Loved by all! The only change I made was mixing the pasta with some of the sauce before adding the other ingredient layers.

My husband and I thought it was very good.  I did what some others did and put the sauce and ziti together and all the cheeses on top. I'm glad I did that because my 8 year old didn't like the cheese.  He said it would be better with cheddar. He has an excuse for everything.  Anyway, I ate his top layer of cheese-which I loved-and he ate the bottom layer.  We were all happy. We ate it 3 days in a row!  Thanks for sharing.

This dish was fantastic!  It was so easy to make, very economical and tasted GREAT!  I made this for a sick friend and decided to prepare extra for us.  My whole family loved it - even my youngest who is one of the world's pickiest eaters!  I was hesitant about the sour cream since I don't like sour cream, but it was fantastic!!  So glad I didn't leave it out. I added 1 tbs. Italian seasoning, a pinch of sugar, 1 tsp minced garlic (from a jar - not the dried kind), and 1 tsp garlic salt to the sauce (I used Ragu Robusto onion and garlic sauce) then mixed the meat sauce and pasta together as others suggested.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This recipe is one of my husband's and kids favorite.  They gobble it up each time I make it.  To vary it a bit I sometimes substitute italian sausage for the ground beef ... but both are good!  I too think it is best when the pasta layer is mixed with a little of the sauce.  It does make a lot so if you are not good at eating leftovers you may one to cut the recipe in half.

This was good and I followed other advice and mixed the sauce with the ziti.  I used whole wheat pasta and added turkey sausage and ground turkey.  Again, this was good but not so spectacular that I would make for guests.

I made this recipe for a Potluck night with friends last night.  I substituted ground turkey for ground beef, used light sour cream, and part skim mozzerella cheese.  Also used a couple dashes of Cholula Hot Sauce and 2 tbs of sugar to the sauce.  Bake uncovered at 475 degrees for the last 10 minutes to give it a nice bubbly slightly browned topping.  My friends were raving about the dish and many had seconds.  Delish!!!

Wow! Terrific!  Thank you submitter - no more looking around for baked Ziti recipes.  My changes were minor.  I used sweet and hot sausage instead of beef and probably a little more than called for.  I mixed the ziti into the sauce which is something I always do.  I'm afraid it will be too dry if I don't.  Let me tell you - using sour cream was outrageous.  I love ricotta but a lot of people don't.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Glad I have some leftovers!!!!

Yummy and very easy to prepare. The kids loved it. I made this a little healthier by using Barilla Plus pasta,low fat sour cream,ground turkey and mozarella instead of provolone.

My teenager thinks this is "insanely delicious", but my husband and I found it too sour. Next time I may half the sour cream or use cottage cheese or ricotta instead because the sour cream was a little too strong for us. We baked it uncovered, and it did not dry out. Just be sure that your top layer of sauce is covering the noodles.

Loved this easy to cook recipe.  Made if for a baby shower and everyone wanted the recipe. The only change I made was adding garlic to the meat and onions while sauteing.

I used italian sausage instead of ground beef; I did everything else by the recipe. My husband loved this and asked that I make it again. I really liked it, but would probably add some fresh garlic and perhaps some fresh basil/oregano. The sour cream definitely gave it a zestier flavor than one would expect from ricotta or cottage cheese - I was hesitant when I added it, thinking it would overpower the dish, but it turned out well. It was very easy to make and was even better reheated on the second day!

This is always a huge hit.  It makes a ton, so I usually only make it for company.  I usually use more cheese, but that's the way I like things.

WOW! This dish was AMAZING. I made it for my mother-in-law and she couldn't rave enough about it. I did make a few changes by adding more cheese, sour cream and using only 30 oz of sauce (all I had). The sour cream made all the difference. It was even better as leftovers! Always a plus. :-)

I have made this twice now and it is definetly a favorite. We are not a big fan of sour cream so I just used Ricotta cheese and it came out fantastic, even as leftovers.

The nearly perfect comfort food. I combined the sauce/meat mixture(I used venison sausage) with the slightly undercooked noodles (penne).  Layered as follows: 1/2 penne/sauce mixture, provalone, sour creme, other 1/2 of penne/sauce mixture, mozzerella cheese. I didn't need the parm cheese when layered this way.  Covered, of course. I also like to add additional oregano and basil to whichever sauce I use for this dish.  I plan to use diced green peppers in the mix next time, and maybe a sausage-pepperoni combination.

This recipe was wonderful!  I added some garlic and oregano to the beef before adding the sauce.  I used about 2 1/2 jars of sauce which was the perfect amount.  I also added the sauce directly to the nooodles instead of putting the chesses first.  I brought leftovers to work... A HIT!  I have already had 3 people ask for the recipe!  Planning on making it again after my next trip to the market!  YUM!

I absolutely have to give this 5*. I received nothing but compliments from my 3 grown sons about this recipe (they don't like much of anything I make).  I followed the recipe only adding some red pepper flakes. Thanks so much!

Great Recipe!  Like others suggested I put the noodles in, then sauce, sour cream, provolone cheese, and mozzarella.  Great to make for entertaining.

I just made this for a dinner party and had 3 requests for the recipe! It even got the approval from my Italian husband - which is sometimes tough. I followed the recipe with the exception of homemade sauce over the store bought stuff. We will definatly make this again and again and again!

When my dinner for five turned into a dinner for fifteen, I knew the pot roast I had made off a recipe from this website wouldn't be enough.  So I tried this recipe as well, and it was long gone well before the pot roast was.  Everyone absolutely loved it, all the kids went back for seconds which is amazing on its own!  Thank you so much it was really easy to make, and I have already made it again since, doubling the sauce and using some for spaghetti since my fussy mate won't eat cheese, and he loved that too!

This is a great base recipe.  Next time I will add some sauted mushrooms and maybe some zucchini.  Also, it seemed that my sour cream curdled.  It tasted good, but my ever-wary 5 year old was skeptical.  Everyone liked it.

This recipe is so good. We make this and save it, and when we cook it again, it is as good as the first time. The only change I make to this recipe is I put sauce on the bottom of the pan, and then I start to layer noodles, provolone, sour cream, mozzarella, and then start allover again. and on the last layer I mix the mozzarella with the parmesean cheese. we have requests to make this as a frozen meal for familes that have just had a baby....I don't know anyone that doesn't like this!

I made a double batch and got lots of compliments. I used ricotta cheese in place of sour cream and added extra mozzarella in place of provolone cheese  and (of course), used aluminum foil to cover it while it baked. I've always had a tough time spreading ricotta cheese over the ziti with sauce, so I experimented by mixing ricotta and sauce together before layering-- excellent idea! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This has become a regular at our house and a family favorite!  I usually make it without meat, even though my husband is a serious carnivore; and he devours it anyway!  I also use half sour cream and half ricotta and sometimes add mushrooms.  I have also made it with pepperoni as the only meat, with good results.  It makes a ton but the leftovers are even better.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!

Fantastic.  I don't think you can mess this one up.  The sour cream makes it.    I did dress up the sauce with my own seasoning, but I always need to help out jarred sauce.  I did bake it covered with foil and I had no spill over issues even though the pan seemed to be overfilled.  This one goes into the rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. Like other reviewers suggested, I tweaked it just a little. I did half ground beef, half italian sausage, two cloves garlic and more of the cheeses. The sour cream is a great addition! Thanks for the recipe.

My husband LOVES this. I only use 1 1/2 jars pasta sauce (I reserve the rest for dipping breadsticks with this or a later meal). Low-fat sour cream works great as well as part-skim mozzarella.

Excellent recipe!  My husband said it was the best he ever had...I served it at a party and someone said that I MUST be italian (and I am not).. the provolone gives it so much flavor and the sour cream makes it extra creamy..the best I ever had.  I used Hunts 28 ounce cans instead of the sauce recommended.

Loved it! I had some shredded cheddar cheese in the fridge so I added it to the recipe for the heck of it. When I cut a slice it all mixed together so its okay to mix all of the noodles and the sauce together, then top with sour cream, provolone and shredded cheese. I highly recommend this recipe!

We LOVE this recipe!  I have been making this for a year or so and figured it's time to rate it.  It is delicious.  The only thing I change is leaving out the onion (don't care for them) and I use 8 oz. of each of the cheeses, that's how they come in the package.  It makes a ton, but we don't mind...love the leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, easy dinner. I divided this into 2- 8" square pans and froze one for later. I also followed another reviewers suggestions and mixed the sauce with the ziti, put it into my greased baking dishes, then layered on the provolone, the sour cream and the mozzarella, sprinkled with parmesan, covered with foil and baked as directed. Everyone loved this... I'll make it often!

I made this recipe the other night and it was absolutely delicious.  I have never had it with provolone cheese before and I think this will be the way that I make it from now on.

This was pretty good.  It makes A LOT so take that into consideration.  Next time I will either half it or make it in a store bought foil container which is bigger than a regular 9x13 dish.  I wanted to add more cheese but couldn't because I was running out of room.  I also added about 3 cloves of garlic, 2 T of Italian seasoning, and some basil to the meat mixture.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone seemed to really like it and one person wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

It was easy and good. I wasn't to sure about provolone cheese, but I liked it. Similiar to Mozzarella cheese.
I couldn't find Ziti pasta. Not even a clue of what shape it is, maybe a Z? Anyway, I used Rototino pasta (curly) it was good. I also, did not use a whole onion, only half. It reminds me of Spagetti and Lasagna. 2nd time I added a layer of mushrooms,sprinkled some chedder on top and baked covered.

I loved this recipe.   It was delicious and very easy to make.   The only substitution I made was using Boca Burger ground meat instead of ground beef (since I don't eat red meat).   Very good recipe!   My husband can't wait until I make it again!!!

This recipe is so simple and so delish. To sneak a little more nutrition in, I sauteed chopped yellow squash and bell pepper along with the onion before adding the pasta sauce (I nixed the meat). Then to the sauce I added a bit of wine and some red pepper flakes to give it a little punch. I had a grated cheese blend of cheddar, jack and mozzarella that I used instead of just mozzarella. It turned out GREAT! Next time I may even add more veggies.

This was really good. I used dried minced onion and garlic and cooked them in with the meat and added a sprinkle of salt and coarse ground pepper. Even though I let it stand while I fixed the garlic toast, I still had trouble getting it out of the pan in 1 piece, so it didn't look as pretty as the picture but I had to settle for spoonfuls. It was almost like lasagna except with ziti pasta. It is worth fixing again. Thumbs up from everyone at the table tonight, thanks!

This was a total hit at my last party.  I upped the recipe to use three pounds of pasta and added fresh basil.  I made it the night before and heated it the next afternoon, adding the parm cheese.  Everyone RAVED about it.  It was the best Baked ziti I have ever made.

This recipe was wonderful, I'm not sure how someone could give it a negative rating...the only personal touch I would add is some more cheese - thanks for a great meal and even better leftovers!

I thought this was a very easy recipe to make and after reading many of the reviews I made a few alterations and its was very tasty.  I made it in a large foil pan instead of a my 9 x 13 pan so that it wouldn't boil over.  I will definately do this again next time.  I added  more cheese than it called for and I also added a cup of ricotta mixed with one egg that I put on top of the provolone.  My kids said it tasted like the baked ziti i love from Sbarro.  It was close!!

The first time I made this I did it exactly as is and loved it.  The second time and now every time, I just use an Italian cheese blend for all the cheese.  I just divide it up.  It's easier this way and I think I like it a little better.  Either way, this recipe is awesome!

UPDATE:  I've been making this recipe for years now.  Love it! It's my go-to for a crowd because it makes a lot and can easily be doubled into two pans of it.  I have started adding a layer of pepperoni in with it and it's wonderful!  Sometimes I use provolone sometimes all mozzarella, but it's always great.   Add in a bell pepper too for even more flavor. Really you cannot go wrong with this recipe.  As is or with a few additions, it's always great.  I've never made a bad "batch."

The only thing that I do recommended doing differently than the recipe is the order of the layering.  Put some of the meat sauce in the bottom of your pan, then 1/2 pasta, then sour cream, more meat sauce, pepperoni (if using), cheese, rest of pasta, rest of meat sauce, and lastly more cheese.  If you layer the provolone before the first meat sauce, the sauce doesn't get into the bottom layer of your pasta and while it doesn't ruin the dish, it's less dry if you sauce it first.

This dish was fine, but nothing special.  After reading all the rave reviews I expected to be wowed; instead I was disapointed since it tasted 'average' to me.  I'll continue searching for a ziti recipe that I really LOVE, instead of one that I think is ok.

I made a big tray of this for a birthday party inwhich about 40 adults came.  This tray was empty by the time everyone went through the food line and the food trays I had catered still had plenty of food in them!!!  I made this recipe a day before, then just cooked it before the party.  Came out perfect!!!!

My family liked this recipe. I'm not as thrilled about it as some of the reviewers, but it's pretty tasty and makes a lot, so we had plenty of left overs. I didn't have to cook again for two days!

This was a real hit at my house - and that includes a lot of PICKY eaters. I used RAGU with sauted onions/garlic at the advice of a friend that makes this and it turned out great. The only feedback was that it needed more "stuff" in the middle (sour cream) and more cheese...can you ever REALLY get too much cheese??? I think not!

I give it 3 stars, but my fiance gives it 4 or 5.  I make it for him b/c he likes this sort of thing. I make it very meaty and saucey.  Both things i dont like.  I think ground beef or ground meat/sausage ruins a good tomato sauce.  That is my other change.  I dont use a jar of sauce, i make my own.  So its a good base recipe, i just prefer  it without meat.  The sour cream adds a little something.  Which is good....A tang of sorts.  Most of the time i add more than called for.  :)

I make this at least once a month. Don't try out this recipe if your going to omit the sour cream, that's what makes this so wonderful and different.

With a few minor changes this was the best ziti ever!!!! My boys ate the whole thing in two days. Here are the changes I made: I used italian sausage and added garlic and mushrooms to the meat mixture. Also, when doing the layers, I put a thin amount of sauce on the bottom (to keep the noodles from sticking), then 1/2 the noodles, 1/2 the sauce, the sour cream, 1/2 of BOTH cheeses, then repreated (except for the sour cream) and topped with parmesan...awsome!

This was very good but when I asked my kids to rate it they said "it's not a 5 mom" "your Cioppino (from this site) is a 5".....they gave it a 4.5 and I have to say they gobbled it up.  I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 spicy italian sausage, sauteed fresh garlic with the onion....otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I did use a larger baking dish and it still overflowed in the oven when it started to bubble.  It makes quite a bit..........yummy for left overs......:)

Excellent! We added minced garlic to the ground beef. We put half ricotta,half sour cream and half cottage cheese. Made it more like a lasagna but with Ziti noodles. Well worth 5 stars!

This is really good- I served it for several of our friends and they all loved it.  I put the sauce directly on the ziti, like other reviewers suggested.  Some also said that the sour cream seemed out of place and gave it a weird flavor- I totally disagree.  I think the sour cream is what makes it and helps to set this dish apart from all the other pasta dishes.  Oh, and if anyone else was wondering (as I was), ziti is actually just large elbow macaroni.  Enjoy!

This is a fantastic dish.  The flavors of the sour cream and the provolone cheese blend together in a delightful way.  Something a little different, but a welcome change from the same old pasta and sauce.  My husband did not like the sour cream, but I thought it was out of this world!  I'll make it with ricotta next time for his picky palette.

LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT. When cooking the ground beef, I added mushrooms, beef pepper, chilli peppers and cut up HOTLINKS (or vienna sausages if not big on spice)... was absolutely wonderful.

Just finished having seconds of this fabulous dish! We really should have halved this recipe, as there are only three of us and we barely made a dent. Followed suggestions of others: layer pasta, sauce, cheese, etc. Perfeco!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made a few changes that were taste preference only.  I used spicy sausage and doctored up my spaghetti sauce. I used garlic parmesan and a mushroom spaghetti sauce plus spices. I also follwed some suggestions from others.  I baked for 15 minutes than put the cheese on top and bake for another 15 minutes. Very yummy with a rich creamy tasete.  Thanks!

This was an absolute fantastic dish!  Who would have thought the sour cream would make this so yummy; even my husband & two sons who are the pickiest eaters and claim they hate pasta loved this!  The only difference was that I used Paul Newman's Italian Sausage & Peppers sauce and used the whole 8 oz. of mozzarella & provolone & of course spiced my sauce and meat; yum, yum, yum!!!

Awesome! I took the advice of others and assembled a smaller version into a mid-size plastic container that I froze. That made the remaining amount of ingredients perfect for a 9" x 13" baking pan. I also mixed a little of the sauce into the bottom layer of pasta and covered the dish as recommended. I removed the cover after 20  minutes to allow the Parmesan cheese an opportunity to get a little color. Other than that and adding about a teaspoon of minced garlic and a couple of tablespoons of pesto to the sauce mixture, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious!

This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't want to use the sour cream but decided to follow the recipe.  It was DELICIOUS.  I used more parmesan (about twice as much) than listed.

This is a great recipe for many reasons.  The flavors are all satisfying and rich, it will make great leftovers, and it is fast to make.  I was skeptical of the sour cream but once I tried it I found it gave it just the right amount of zing.  Yummy!

I have made this many times and it is fantastic!  I tried it with ground italian sausage instead of the ground beef and it was even better!  I think a blend would be great too.  I make this for dinners, potlucks, and parties.  EVERYONE loves it, including people who are super-picky.  It is kid, adult, male and female friendly!

This is a great recipe because it's simple and delicious. I thought it reminded me of lasagne since it was so hearty (I added Italian Sausage) but was much simpler to make. I will make this again and again. A great dish to make for a hungry crowd. Easy to double to make more. Thank you!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly & it turned out great.  Served it with bread & salad, and ended up with a ton of leftovers.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe. Pasta for the kids, a bit of meat for the hubby. My baking dish was overflowing by the time I put all the ingredients in, so next time I will cut back a bit (or maybe buy a bigger dish!)  Great!

This was terrific.  I used an extra large pyrex baking pan, 9X13 would have been too small. The only thing I added was garlic powder, it was wonderful on it's own!

A basic, solid ziti recipe that you pretty much can't screw up.  Favorable to lasagna IMO and alot less work.

I know that I am going against the grain here, however I was very disappointed in this recipe! I followed other's reviews as it was bland and added more spices, but I was looking for something more hearty and found this to be just a plain old lasange made with ziti noodles. I will not make this again.

Absolutely outstanding!  This recipe is rich, and cheesy and delicious.  I will definitely make it again.  I cut this recipe in half, and it still made a huge amount.  I also added garlic, basil leaves and a pinch of sugar to the sauce.  I will have to consider making this for my next family get-together.  A real keeper.

Wonderful!  I made this recipe for Christmas Eve and it was delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written and used Barilla sauce for oven baking (Al Forno) since I didn't have time to make my own.  The only thing I changed was that I bumped up the provolone a bit and used a mixture of slice and then some sharper, aged provolone that I shredded.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

A very easy recipe. Kinda like a quick lasagne. However, I found it to be too bland. I will make it again but will add more herbs and spices. I will also top it off with the mozzarella instead of the parmesan.

I thought this was ok, it was lacking something.  Like it needed some kick to it or something.  It is very quick and easy which is nice, just to bland for my taste, I will add something if I make it again.

Very easy and delicious!  My picky 4 year old came back for seconds!  (A real rarity!)  Sauteed the beef with garlic and onion, added 2 different Barillo sauces: 4 cheese and Garlic and Mushroom.  Need a deep casserole dish to use all of the ingregients, but it is a very attractive dish to take to a potluck, and easy to serve different size portions because there is no cutting,just scooping.  This will become a staple in our house.  Thanks!

I liked this a lot and it was really easy. I used italian sausage instead of hamburger and Paul Newman's Sockarooni jar sauce.  I also added some sauteed mushrooms and it turned out terrific.  This was a really attractive dish as well.One note: I halved this recipe using just 1 jar of sauce and 1/2 the ziti called for and just 2 crumbled italian links and it filled a 13x9 casserole dish. If I made the whole recipe I would probably use a bigger pan.  Will probably serve at my next Christmas party!

WONDERFUL!  I made this dish for my daughter's second birthday party and it was a HUGE hit!  I was a little put off at first at the thought of putting sour cream in my ziti, but I have to admit it was great!  THANK YOU for the recipe!  :-)

I only gave it 4 stars because I had to season the heck out of it to make it taste really good (I didnt even bother not seasoning the meat with a little bit of italian seasoning and a little spoon of tomato paste mixed with a splash of water the first time I made it, but I know it wouldnt have been as good)  I get pretty generic spagetti sauce because i like to season it myself and sometimes I make my own sauce for other recipes and freeze what's left over for this.  I use far less sour cream and add ricotta to the mix (because I always have tons on hand) and it's GREAT.  Dont be scared to add your own seasoning, for some reason this recipe lacks that.

Wonderful!  The sour cream makes it!  I also sauted fresh mushrooms and green peppers with the onion.  Had no Provolone cheese so just used mozzarella and did not add ground beef as I served it with meatballs.  Thanks so much, Colleen.  I will be making this again and again!

FANTASTIC! I used to work for a restaurant that made baked ziti just like this and could never figure out exactly how to replicate it. I made this without the meat, and instead of using all sour cream, I used sour cream and cottage cheese. Also, an added touch is to put some mozzarella on top at the end of cooking and broil for a few minutes. Added fat and calories but worth it!

I can't believe this recipe has 5 stars.  It was just "okay" in my opinion... way too much sauce, the flavor wasn't anything to write home about.  I'll be looking for a different baked ziti recipe.

This was great, but I gave it a 4 because I made a few changes.  I mixed together the mozzarella and (no fat) sour cream with some garlic salt, about 1/2 t.  Then I mixed in the pasta.  I put the cheese and pasta mix on the bottom of the greased dish, then layered with provolone followed with no meat marinara sauce.  It was great and every bite had all the flavors mixed in.  Thanks for the recipie!

I fixed this last night for dinner and my husband and I just loved it.    
I added a couple of cloves of garlic while I was browning the onion.  I used Paul Newman's Marina Sauce and reduced fat sour cream.  It turned out great.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  We'll be fixing this again very soon!!

I used 2 bags of Sargentos Mozzerella Bistro Blend in place of the plain provolone & mozzarella. Otherwise I did everything else the same.  Oh! And I used a chunky Barilla style sauce.  Purely decadent comfort food!!  ...THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! 
Update!  This time, I sauteed a green pepper and some garlic with the meat, beat an egg and then beat it in with a 15oz container of ricotta and used that instead of sour cream.  Yum!  BTW - Is same recipe as Baked Ziti III, but with less parmesan...

This definitley is the best baked ziti I have ever tried.  It has been requested many times for family parties.  My 4 year old begs for this dish and my husband loves the fact that he has leftovers to take to work the next day! I sometimes make an extra pan and freeze it for a quick meal. Tastes just as fresh!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  We didn't change a thing except I used my own spaghetti sauce.  Oh!  I should tell you to save on heating my kitchen in the summer, I cooked it on my gas Webber grill.  I was able to keep the temperature constant.  Now that was a good conversation topic over a fantastic dish of ziti.

Excellent and very easy!  I only use about one and a half jars of spaghetti sauce.  Also really good with italian sausage instead of ground beef.

This was excellent. I thought it was going to be too soupy (too much sauce and sour cream), but it turned out perfect. The family devoured most of it in one sitting. Even the picky eaters asked for thirds.

I made this for my boyfriend and I, and I was extremely impressed. I followed the recipe exactly. I expected something much more plain; this tastes much more to me like a lasagna than ziti with sauce. The cooked beef and onions added to the sauce gives it a homemade, authentic taste and the sour cream and provolone layer is much like ricotta cheese. This will certainly become a regular in my house.

Awesome! So easy and tastes great. I used Classico 4 cheese and Classico tomatoe basil. I used 1.5 lbs of italian sausage. I couldnt find ziti so I used rigatoni.

Very good and cheesy!!!  I changed the 2 jars of sauce to 1 also.  But when eatting left overs realized that 2 jars were probably better.  Actually 1 1/2 would be perfect.

This was excellent! I'm a vegetarian so I didn't use the meat but it was still very cheesy and satisfying (maybe next time I will add veggies). This is very rich and a little goes a long way, so I will probably cut the recipe in half next time if I'm just cooking for 1 or 2 people.

This was so good!  I made the entire recipe for four people, and still have more than half left over.  I used Classico Tomato and Basil, but I think in the future I would use something a little thicker.

The sour cream is what separates this recipe from others that I have tried.  Yummy!  Update 10/8/09 - I made this for a Halloween Bunko party and did as the others suggested and mixed the sour cream with the ziti and it worked so much better plus I used some mild Italian sausage...it was so good.  I'm changing my four stars to five.  I made a batch and a half and it made two large casseroles with plenty to eat for everyone.  I also prepared it the day before and put it in the refrigerator to bake the next day (just bring it to room temperature before you bake it).  It had rave reviews from my guests.

This dish may not be considered "authentic", but what is important is how it tastes as it is.  This dish tastes like a good lasagna, but it takes less hassle to prepare.  I prepared it to the letter with no substitutions. Highly recommended.

Wow!  This has to be one of the best pasta dishes I've eaten!  I'm not a big sour cream fan, and almost left it out, but decided it wouldn't hurt to try it.  Don't leave it out!!!  It's what makes this dish!!!  thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!!

Definitely delicious.  I am NOT good at making Italian recipes, but this was delicious.  I didn't use onions (my boyfriend hates them) and used garlic instead.  The meat sauce you start with would be delicious on its own, but the whole dish was easy, quick, and made this blonde - Polish/Irish girl feel very Italian.  Just a note - I used classico tomato basil sauce.

I have made this for just about every family member/friend/co-worker we have had over for dinner.  It makes pleny.  If it is just us - we have great leftovers for lunch!  I mix 1/2 pound of spicy sausage and 1/2 pound of ground beef (freeze the other havles for the next time!)  The only thing I add is an additional small can of tomato sauce - my guy thought it needed more sauce the first time around!

This is a great recipe!  I made a few minor changes: I used italian sausage instead of ground beef and added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic along with the onion.  Also, I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta and changed the layering order (pasta, sauce, sour cream/ricotta, provolone).  It makes a huge amount as mentioned in previous reviews...I divided mine into 2 baking dishes - made one for dinner and popped the other in the freezer for a "ready to bake" meal.  Great for a covered dish dinner too!

My twin boys and husband loved this dish so much!  I only made some changes: Saute onion and garlic for few minutes then added Ground Turkey and seasoned with seasoning salt, browned and drained. I added one jar of spaghetti sauce and One Jar of Marinara sauce then I added chopped fresh herbs such as Rosemary, Parsley and Basil.  I used Ricotta cheese and Monterey Jack instead   It turned out yummy!! Even my 2 year old Twin boys had 2nd helping!

Delicious!  I added chopped spinach to the sauce during the simmer stage--have to get in those greens.  I think you can easily add other veggies to this.  I'm considering tryig chopped carrots or zucchini next time around. I halved the recipe and it was still about 6 servings.  I served it with corn on the cob.

Very easy and delicious ! Made a few changes. Used ricotta mixed with an egg and some parsley and oregano instead of sour cream, used a mixture of ground beef and hot Italian sausage ( about 1 1/2 lbs ). Used a bit more cheese. I forgot the onions. Would be great with mushrooms and black olives in the sauce. I used Prego Traditional and added some garlic. Makes alot!

Excellent! Its a favorite among my entire family! However I would reccomend using bigger pan or using a little less of each ingredient because my ingredients began to overflow!

Easy, easy easy!  The taste was very good and very little effort required.  My kids think they might like this better than lasgna.  I used Italian suausage and ground beef with Classico tomato and basil sauce.  I also used fat-free sour cream (since that is what I has on hand) and real parm. cheese.  I also tossed in a few finely chopped roasted red peppers in the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe, as you can tell from the positive reviews.  It does make ALOT, but it freezes really well!  I froze it in individual servings and my husband took it for lunch and LOVES it!

The beauty of this recipe is that it is so easy. It's not gourmet cuisine, but you can alter it just about any way you want to suit your taste and it still turns out. You can change the cheeses, vary the meat, add vegetables, or spice up the sauce, and it gets even better. You can put it together the night before or freeze it (if you cover it with foil you should protect it first with plastic wrap, as the tomato in the sauce could ruin the foil). The ziti is NOT dry, which is often a problem with this kind of recipe. I will keep this on hand and have fun with the variations. Thank you, Colleen, for a versatile casserole!

SUCH a keeper! Easy and so delicious. I seasoned the meat with italian seasoning and garlic powder. Used half a small tub of ricotta mixed with entire (small) container of sour cream, and 8 oz shredded mozzarella. It made a 2.5 qt casserole plus a small square cake pan (to freeze). Everyone should try this. My picky eater had 5 helpings!

This is great! I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. hot italian sausage. Instead of the store bought marinara I used the recipe I found on this site for "The Best Marinara Sauce Yet". It was a huge hit and everyone wanted my recipe! Thank you Shawna for this delish recipe. It certainly deserves to be in The Hall Of Fame!

SOOO easy to make and fabulous!  I didn't have Ziti noodles nor provolone cheese so I modified with  using spiral noodles and additional mozerella cheese in place of Provolone. I used ground turkey (couldn't tell the difference) I also added garlic and some extra seasonings to 'spice' it up.  Instead of using 2 jars of spagetti sauce I used 1 and then added an addtional small can of tomato sauce.  Wow!  Just like lasagana!  AWESOME!

We've never had ziti before and after trying this, doubt we'd have it again.  If this is hall of famer material for ziti, then I'm sure we'd hate to try the others.  I made two versions, one I stuck to the recipe and the other, I added mushrooms and spinach and everyone agreed the ziti with the veggies tasted much better.  Not trying again, nothing special.

After reading the most helpful reviews.  I set out to make this dish.  I used a tomato and basil sauce and a tomato and spicy garlic sauce.  I mixed the meat, sauce and noodles together. I put 1/2 of the sauced noodles on the bottom, thenI put on the provolone slices and spread the sour cream over it. I put the rest of the sauced noodles on top of this. I put grated mozzerella cheese over all, sprinkled with a good parmesan cheese; sprayed a piece of foil with "Pam" and put it  covered into the oven for 30 minutes; took off foil and let it brown for about another 10-15 minutes.  An easy-cheesy homecooked meal without a lot of effort.  PS.  I thought about using ricotta but decided against it.  I like my lasagna and wanted something with a different flavor.  My teenaged sons loved this!  Thanks Colleen

This recipe is SO simple and turns out delicious every time! I cook it without the meat, and usually divide it into two smaller casseroles. You can freeze this (unbaked) for an easy meal on a busy day. It's also great to bring to new moms.

Great recipe-my family loved it. It also made enough for me to freeze the leftovers and have as a meal a few days later. I used mostaccioli pasta and doubled the mozzerella because I had no provolone. I added a little less sour cream and I'm glad I did because I thought the sour cream layer was a little too much, even with less then what it called for. I also added a minced garlic clove in with the beef and onion. Delicious!!

How can you not love this ziti recipe? The mixes of cheese are really good. I made this 5 hours ahead of time and let the dish sit in the refrigerator to blend. I used a block of mozzarella and sliced it for the layer instead of store bought shredded. You might think you'd miss the ricotta from this dish,,, but the sour cream tastes great. You don't miss the ricota.

I made this for a funeral reception and doubled the recipe. It made a ton of food and everyone loved it. It did take longer to cook than it said but I was at an apartment complex recreation hall and not in my own kitchen so I don't know if the oven temp was right.

Perfect! I added one box frozen chopped spinach, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 8 oz. sauteed mushrooms to the pan of browning onions and beef. Covered dish for first 20 minutes in the oven, uncovered for last 10. Used 1 1/2 jars of Classico Four Cheese sauce. I also use all mozzarella, no provolone, and a BIG casserole dish!

I made this per directions.  It was very sweet for my taste (probably the Newman's Marinara I used).  Next time I'd replace 1 jar with a mixture of crushed tomatoes and canned (plain) tomato sauce.  The sour cream was a pleasant surprise -- it bakes up into something like ricotta in lasagna, but with a kick.  I will make this again, but probably play around with the recipe.

Yum!  I know it's a million calories but so very worth it.  I just served it a couple of nights ago and am planning to serve it again for the NFL playoffs on Sunday when we have some company.  I can't wait.  Thanks for this decadent treasure of a recipe!

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  My son (20 months) is a picky eater and he had 3 helpings!!  Makes a huge batch.  Had enough to keep for another supper.  I used a pound of hamburger and about 1/4 pound of Italian sausage.

Excellent!  The consistency is great.  The sour cream and the provolone are the kickers.

Just tripled this recipe. Wonderful! I prepared the recipe exactly as stated except did 1/2 Italian Sausage, 1/2 ground beef and added a few cloves of garlic to the onions. I baked in 3 different 9X12 pans and not one of them spilled over. Delicious and easy!

Very very good! Everyone loved it.  I didn't use Ricotta cheese though, I substitued Cottage Cheese one medium size container, and a small mixed with 2 eggs.  Delicious.  Next time I'll add spinach.

This ziti was excellent and super easy to make. I used one jar of spaghetti sauce and one can of crushed tomatoes and doctored up my sauce with garlic, fresh basil, oregano and pepper. The sour cream made this dish very moist.  This makes a lot, so I will freeze some. Delicious!

I have to agree with everyone else.  This was great!  Only change was 1/2 Italian Sausage and 1/2 ground beef and a tablespoon of minced garlic and italian seasoning.  WONDERFUL!

I used bow-tie pasta because it was in my pantry, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Oh, and I did add plenty of seasonings: salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced garlic, and basil - those were very necessary to make the meal a four.  I didn't measure out the cheese, just spread it in the pan until it looked satisfactory.  :)  It made plenty, but we have yet to try the leftovers, though other reviewers said it reheated well so I'm looking forward to today's lunch.  Thanks.

A good start for ziti - next time I'll probably add mushrooms, sausage, etc to make it more interesting.  Was very good reheated as leftovers - didn't get too dry.

I made this without the beef, and it was still delicious. Next time I won't bother with the layers, just mix together the ziti, sauce, sour cream, and mozzarella cheese, then top with the provolone and parmesan cheese. I don't think any baked ziti recipe could deserve 5 stars, though - it's just a simple dish that you don't really need a recipe for.

This is a great recipe!  I added ricotta cheese as advised by other reviews and also added Italian sausage.  I made 5 pans of this (they are sleeping in the freezer right now!) for our reception for 80 people and will let you all know how it goes!!  Of course I had to make a trial run pan to make sure it was good.  :-)

This recipe is excellent!  I made it last night, I actually used about 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger because that is what I had and penne pasta because the store didn't have ziti but this was awesome.  I will make it again and plan to bring it to my next carry in at work.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great, although I did make a couple of "minor" changes.  I seasoned the water that I cooked the ziti in with Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I also seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  And I added 2 packages frozen creamed spinach (I cooked it first in microwave of course) in between the layers. Although the ingredients were a little costly (I think I spent about $18), it made so much that the price per serving was economical.  I had to use a 9.5 x 13.5 casserole dish though and it still almost spilled over.  I will certainly make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for work and everyone LOVED it! I doubled the batch and added a hot italian sausage cut out of the casing for that extra zing.  I used Classico sauce w/roasted garlic and added 1/2 c. good red wine and some fresh basil.  Great basic recipe to build on. Thanks Colleen!

Great recipe! Makes enough to feed a large family. I made a few changes & it turned out delicious. I did not have Provolone cheese on hand so I substituted for sliced Swiss cheese. I omited the sour cream and just sprinkled the layer of swiss cheese with some Romano cheese. Yummy! The holes in the Swiss cheese also allowed for the tomato sauce mixture to get down to the noodles.

OUTSTANDING.  This recipe is great, company worthy, food! I halved the recipe, which was enough for my family of three, and I think the whole recipe would make a lot. I mostly followed as directed, except I did add the sauce directly over the noodles as some suggested and I added a little garlic and onion powder (I left out the onion) to the Prego Traditional sauce I bought. The provolone cheese and sour cream made this just so creamy and DIFFERENT, which is why this was so great. I found it easy to prepare and cannot say enough good things about it.  FIVE STARS is not enough!

I've never had ziti before, so picked this for my first recipe. I also thought I didn't like sour cream at all, but in this dish it baked to a consistency sort of like ricotta in a lasagna. It was pretty good, but makes a lot of food for one person (probably 5-6 meals for me). It did wind up a bit watery, though. I guess the sauce mixture needed more simmering to remove water. Also, other beginning cooks (like me) should notice that you really do need a LARGE skillet for this.

This recipe tastes like a lasagne but is much simpler to make.  It was sooooo good.  The family really enjoyed it.  In addition to the onion and ground beef, add 2 tbsp of minced garlic for added flavor. 
I would suggest mixing 1/3 sauce with 1/2 pasta as the first layer, then top with the grated provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/3 sauce mixed with rest of pasta, mozzarella cheese, rest of sauce.  It was good without the Parmesan cheese.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

A MAJOR CROWD PLEASER! 5 star AS IS..BUT BUT BUT... The second time I made it I tweaked it up with 2 FAT cloves fresh garlic, fresh mushrooms, and fresh Basil (simmered in the sauce)! That made it 6 star! This one will be served and served and served!

AWESOME!  I would give 10 stars if I could!  I added 1/2 lb. of hot italian sausage and used all the provolone and mozzarello cheeses.  Fantastic recipe!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe!  I was a little hesitant about the sour cream, but everyone loved it.  I subbed fat or low free ingreds for everything I could and used whole wheat pasta and everyone went back for seconds, then fought over the leftovers!  It's my new ziti recipe!

Made this last night to rave reviews.  I split the recipe in half using two 8 x 8 pans so I could freeze half.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Great comfort food and perfect to bake and take.  I also halve the recipe (8x8 or 9x9) and omit the meat, add sliced zucchini, and a bit of cayenne.  I subbed shredded Italian cheese blend for the provolone this time because that's what I had on hand.  Yum!

Wow, what a reception!  I made this for a party last weekend & even the Italians were singing my praises!  I use my homemade sauce, which has stew meat, crumbled italian sausage, sweet peppers & fresh herbs, which I think makes a pretty significant difference, but I love the provolone & sour cream combination.  The sour cream adds just a touch of sweetness.  I'm making it again tonight, cause I didn't get enough of a chance to eat at the party...no objections from my hubby!

Wow!  I can't even begin to describe how good this recipe is.  I must admit that I added a few other ingredients to it, a green bell pepper, sun dried tomatoes, basil, onion and garlic powder as well as an extra cup of mozzarella cheese.  This was so good my husband and step-daughters loved it.  I will definately be making this in the future!  Especially since it is so easy to prepare.  Thanks Colleen!

This was a good, no nonsense dish.  The family enjoyed it, though it's not anything to get too excited about.  I substituted italian sausage for the ground beef.

I've been making this for months now and it's great every time. I've done with and without meat and when I don't have provolone I make it with only mozarella and it's great too. I've also split it into 2 dishes and froze half to have an easy dinner later on.

I've been making this dish for well over four years now. It was actually the first "home cooked meal" I made out of college! This recipe is very good and very simple to make. My tastes have changed considerably as my culinary skills have advanced, so now I use higher quality spaghetti sauce and add in Italian seasonings and a few cloves of minced garlic. This is a fabulous recipe that you can easily make small changes to and have it suit your tastes.

Normally I just rate a recipe... and this one got all FIVE stars.  But I absolutely have to comment too... we LOVED it.  Everyone in the house loved it (and I have a brood of five).  It was fabulous and easy.  I made this, tossed a salad, and served some rolls.  Perfect!  I've decided that this will be my signature dish whenever I need to bring a casserole.  DELICIOUS!!!  I wish I could give it more stars....

This was excellent!  I also used the Classico 4 cheese blend pasta sauce, and used the advice of another person and covered it for the first 1/2 hour with foil while it baked then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes, otherwise would have been dry.  Not a morsel left!!!

I made this last night for dinner using my husband and Dad as test subjects. I added garlic and fresh rosemary from the garden to give it an extra kick. It made a very large amount and there was probably less than 1/8 of it left. We loved it. I will make over and over again.

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and my two kids, hoping that I had hit the jackpot.  The end result was good; my boyfriend went for seconds, but my kids were on the fence about it (probably because the presentation was something that they weren't used to).  My daughter kept examining each bite as though it were a science experiment...my son, usually a hearty eater, claimed he was full before being half-done his portion.
All in all a good recipe; I will make it again and try some of the suggestions of the others (ie. use italian sausage, use more sour cream & cheese, more sauce,etc).  The sour cream really made the dish.  I still think my lasagna's better though :-)

Very good, VERY cheesy!  The other reviews were right. It's almost impossible to fit all of the ingredients into one 9x13 dish. I just didn't use all the noodles and sauce.  I also left off the Parmesan and it still tasted wonderful! We had this with salad and garlic bread. Oh, and don't forget to cover it with tin foil! Mine spilled over the sides a bit b/c it was so full, so I put the dish on top of a cookie sheet to keep from making a mess in my oven.:-) Will definitely make again!!

I thought this recipe was great! I did make some changes though. I made my own homemade pasta meat sauce, used penne instead of ziti and instead of sour cream, I made a bechamel sauce and it turned out great! YUMMY!

Soooo good and soooo easy!  The only change I made was I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup ricotta cheese, I'm sure it would have been great with just sour cream though too!  Definately not for those on a diet...but oh so worth it!  Thank you!

I used 1 lb. of sweet italian sausage instead of the groud beef - only because my family LOVES italian sausage.  I've made if both ways and they are both FAB!

This looked really strange as I put it together exactly as the directions stated.  But it came out amazing!  It was really delicious.  Definitely worth all the attention.

It was really good.  My only recommendation is, cook it a day ahead.  We ate it right after it was cooked and it was ok, but when we reheated it the next day, it was great!

AWESOME--i nixed the butter and greased the pan with olive oil, added a little salt and pepper, added some chopped sundried tomatoes,then layered the pasta over that, put sauce mixtured (I used sweet italian turkey sausage and Prego sausage spaghetti sauce). I didn't have sour cream so I used some left over Sargento Mexican Cheese mix instead. I topped the whole thing with more sauce and a LOT of freshly shaved Parmesan, and it came out delicious!!!

Delicious! Better than a plain old pasta bake-- We made it without the meat and it was good.

We will make a half recipe next time since this made SO MUCH FOOD.

Found a keeper! I made mine with 2lbs Italian sausage (mix of sweet/hot), garlic and used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet instead of the 2 jars of sauce called for. It was EXCELLENT!  I got all kinds of compliments on it.  The Best Marinara Sauce Yet is from this site too and the only change I made there was to use Port Wine since it was the only thing I had.  That sauce gets 5 stars too!

Thank you to all of the other reviewers for your suggestions. I added 1 tablespoon of minced garlic when browning the meat, I also used half ground meat and half italian sausage. I used "Classico's Mushroom & Ripe Olive" jar sauce and I also changed the way it was layered: 1/2 pasta, 1/2 sauce mixture, provolone cheese, sour cream, remaining pasta, remaining sauce, mozzarella & parmasean cheese. I also used a 9x13 disposable Reynolds tin baking dish, sprayed with Pam and covered the dish with foil and baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect! Use whatever kind of sauce that suits your preference. Next time I am going to make it using "Brian's Favorite Sauce" which is my husbands all time favorite and has amazing flavor.

Like everyone else I loved this recipe. It was very easy to assemble and was very delicious to eat. The only hard part was spreading the sour cream on the provolone cheese. But I managed. 
The end result was a real keeper. I used 8 oz. of mozzarella (the whole bag) and it was great. For the spaghetti sauce I used Classico Mushroom and Garlic and we thought it was perfect. I added some italian seasoning since that is always what I do to sauce. And a crazy thing is that my grocery store didn't have any ziti. I looked and looked and finally just bought penne. I went on the Net to see what the differnce is and decided there really wasn't any. This is a dish I will definitely make when company comes over. This was my trial run to make sure we liked it before I served it. I hate to make something new the first time for company and then not have it turn out so good.

This turned out fantastic!  I am not a fan of ricotta cheese, so this looked good to me.  Hubby is a HUGE fan of baked ziti, and he actually has declared this his favorite recipe I have tried!  He will no longer order from our local italian place!  I did add both sweet and hot italian sausage to the sauce along with garlic and italian seasoning and a bit of sugar.  Next time I will freeze half as this made a large amount (enough to pack lunches for 3 adults and also take in for coworkers).  Even better the following day!  BRAVO!

This pasta dish is so easy and very, very tasty.  I used whole wheat pasta, and unless I told you, you wouldn't know it was whole wheat - the cheese and tomato flavors really take over!  Sure to be a crowd pleaser.

ok, first time i made this recipe, using beef, i thought it was a fluke, so I made it again last night.  No mistaking it, this is a wonderful recipe!!! i made two smaller pans, one beef one vegetarian.  I substituted the beef in the recipe for 1 small can mushrooms, 1 can artichoke hearts, and one can chopped olives. so easy and it came out perfect. i made the recipe as is, but with half the meat in one dish, and the vegetables in the other. fit perfectly in the half sized glass pyrex dishes. i love it and will certainly make it often!

Oh my goodness this is good...my husband hates ricotta cheese so I decided to try this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit with him and my guests....not too heavy or too light...perfect combo and the cheeses combine to mimick ricotta...it was awesome!  I am so glad I stumbled onto this recipe and I will use it over and over again.  I also want to try to make a healthier version with whole wheat ziti, reduced fat sour cream, soy crumbles, less cheeses and a lower fat sauce...I bet it will taste good too!

I made this with a few modifications so my rating is based on my changes.  I forgot to buy provolone so I used mozzarella, colby and monteray jack cheeses.  I also made it with the Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this site instead of jar sauce.  I loved it so much and I think the sour cream is a great addition.  Next time I will add some italian sausage.  My family loved it also.

Got rave reviews for this recipe from lunch guests.    I made it with whole wheat macaroni and substituted cheddar cheese for the provolone because I didn't have it.  I think I topped with parmesan mixed with the cheddar.  Will make again and again!

I love baked ziti, from a restaurant...I could never make it even close at home, until I tried this recipe!  I used Italian Sausage instead of hamburger, and added garlic and Italian Seasoning.  My husband doesn't like sour cream so I didn't tell him that it was in there, and he loved the ziti, couldn't even taste the sour cream!  He was even happy having it as left overs the next night...definitely somethng I will make again!

Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but next time I'll make it without the meat and maybe add some mushrooms. I think I put more than the recipe called for in it, and I'm not a huge ground beef fan as it is. The leftovers froze very well.

This was awesome. My entire family LOVED it! I used prego since we like the sweet taste. I also added salt, pepper and italian seasoning to meat while cooking. My 3 year old dipped his salad in the sauce, cleaned his plate and asked for more. It does make alot, but my family loved it so much we only had enough for left over once. I will definitely make this again and freeze half for another great meal. A real winner!

This is the best baked ziti I have ever had.  I use fat free sour cream and it comes out delicious.  I make this without the meat, and use one jar or a jar and a half of sauce instead of two jars.  I also use more mozzarella and less provolone.  I always get compliments on this dish, it's great!

This recipe is awesome!  As an Italian, Im somewhat skeptical about slightly unconventional ingredients with my pasta.. but this works! The sour cream does add an amazing taste!   I made it for a new guy in my life who just adored it.... so much that he is now making me copy the recipe down to give his mother!  The only changes I made was lots of garlic (of course) and I did add some ricotta cheese...

This recipe does make a lot, but it's a good thing since it's so delicious.  I really like the parmesan cheese topping, it was crisp and salty.  The sour cream was also a nice touch.  This is a definite keeper.

i make this a lot without the provolone, and just mix it all together with zucchini & mushrooms & onions.  the more sour cream the better!  i use mushroom prego sauce.  it is a GReaT quick dinner that keeps really well.

This recipe is great!  I used reduced fat cheeses and light sour cream and it turned out fabulous.  My husband and I have been married for 5 years and I just found out that baked ziti is one of his all-time favorites - I'll be making this recipe again!

This was awesome!  I used fat free sour cream and ground turkey instead and no one could tell the difference.  Totally addictive and the leftovers are just as good.

This recipe is excellent!  I use a little more mozarrella and a little less sour cream...and its wonderful.  Makes a rather large amount, but good for leftovers.

wouldn't have believed that sour cream would go with ziti but after reading all the reviews i decided to try it. can't get provolone cheese in ireland unless you travel to a specialty cheese shop in dublin so i used a combo of swiss and chedar in it's place.  added some garlic and next time maybe some diced red pepper as well.  well done this was delicious

YUMMY! This receipe is soooooo great.  I made a low-fat version with the lowfat sourcream and low fat mozzerella and lean ground beef.  I didn't have provolone so I used Monterey.  You must try it with a simple sauce like Tomato/garlic/basil. It did start to slightly overflow in my oven, so I took it out 10 minutes early but it was just fine.

My daughter in college has made this for her friends using ground turkey and it has become one of their favorite dishes! We add a freshly crushed garlic clove and use mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. Adding some salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders as it simmers also adds to the flavor.

I've tried this recipe numerous times, and it always gets rave reviews from everyone. Missing some of the ingredients, I modified the recipe slightly, and found it to be equally satisfying. Armed with only 10 oz jars of sauce, rather than the recommended 26 oz, I added chopped Roma tomatoes and red wine, and simmered it with the sauce. Additionally, I was out of provolone cheese, so I substituted a small amount of Kraft Roasted Garlic Cheddar, and a small amount of leftover Fontina cheese, for the bottom layer, and it added a very nice flavour. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was an excellent dish that lasted 4 nights for my husband, another adult, and me.  It definitely requires a deeper baking dish, use one specially made for lasagna to fit all the ingredients.  I like to add 1/4 cup brown sugar to the sauce as it simmers to give it a nice flavor, and instead of using 2 jars of spaghetti sauce I used one jar of sauce and added a 28 oz can of seasoned diced tomatos and two small cans of tomato paste.  My husband claimed this was his favorite pasta dish ever!

Yum Yum! What a great recipe! I loved this! Creamy, cheesey, rich and delicious! I was skeptical about the sour cream, but it was awesome! I used classico sauce and italian sausage and added 2 cloves of minced garlic, which I browned along with the sausage and onion. I prepared this ahead of time and refrigerated it untill I was ready. I baked it for about 1 hour. Turned out great! I will be making this again for sure! Thanks Colleen!

I had to use penne pasta. Used one 1lb.10oz jar Ragu parmesan and romano sauce and 2- 8oz. cans Hunts tomato sauce. Omitted the onion and added 1/2 tsp chopped garlic. Also added a small can sliced mushrooms. Also I didn't read the reviews and only used 1 cup sour cream. I would use all of it next time and add some ricotta or cottage cheese next time. My husband is italian and he can always tell if I use jarred sauces. He does not like them. This has not been husband tested yet,but the kids liked it. I don't think he'll like it. Daughter likes my homemade baked mac aroni better with homemade sauce. I know this way is fast and easy but the next time I have any homemade sauce left in the freezer, I will use that instead. I liked the cheeses but will add more moz. and parm next time in the layers. This makes ALOT!!! Thanks Colleen!

Wow!  If I could give this more stars, I would!  It is delicious!!!  I made it for the first time last night for my husband and father-in-law and both raved about it.  I substituted hot sausage for the ground hamburger and it was incredible.  Will definitely make this one again and again and again!

Perfect blend of all the cheeses.  Will make again and again.

I loved this recipe. Sooo easy to make. I used precut frozen onion, an preshredded Italian cheese mixture that included provolone, and sliced mozzarella. I only used a few spoonfuls of sour cream. I think it is the layering that makes this a great dish.

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make. My 5 year old son had 3 helpings! Tasted a lot like lasagna, but better. I will definitely be making this regularly. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I liked this recipe.  It was a little dry, but I could have changed that.  I served it to a couple of my italian friends and they were somewhat offended at it's lack of authenticity.  I suggest serving this to American's.  :)

This dish was excellent, thanks Colleen for sharing!  My husband and I loved it, and the combination of cheeses was delicious.  Very easy and simple to make - I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and used low-fat sour cream, and it came out wonderful!

I give this recipe a five star, but my family says they don't like the sour cream in the ziti, so I give it a four star rating.  I think it is an easy and tasty dish.  To me, it tastes like lasagne, but much easier and less messy to prepare.

I have tried so many "experiments" on my family that I  had almost given up - but this one was GREAT!  We loved this dish and that says a lot because it's hard to please two little ones and a husband at the same time.  Thanks!

This recipe is so yummy! I have made it several times, and it has become a family favorite. I now omit the ground beef, and everyone likes it even better. It makes it so quick to prepare, too.

I made this recipes for my Italian-food-loving boyfriend and he loved it.  I didn't have any provolone cheese, so I used all mozarella, and I used more than the recipe called for too.  Also, I would recommend adding in some garlic while browning the ground beef.  Overall, I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice alternative to the "normal" way to make Ziti.  It was easy and you can use reduced fat sour cream without altering the taste!  This was great warmed up for lunch the next few days and it freezed well.  This will be the way I make it from now on.

I made this recipe for the first time and used 1 lb. of diced/cooked ham in place of the ground beef. It was excellent! The sour cream really makes it creamy. I know I will make it many more times in the future. Thank you for such a tasty recipe.

This was an awesome meal! I needed a vegetarian option for a dinner party and this one was enjoyed by everyone! This is a great basic recipe that you can change to fit your mood. Next time I will add fresh mushrooms and zuchini and also lightly mix the sauce with the pasta before layering since my husband prefers more sauce on his pasta. I also sauted garlic with the onion to give the sauce a little more flavor.

My family loves this one.  Sometimes I substitute the hamburg with sauted mushrooms for change.  I always mix sauce mixture with ziti then layer with cheese and sour cream so sauce is spread throughout the pan.

Sorry, Just not to our liking - We aren't huge fans of meat sauce, but tried this anyway because of the reviews. The children didn't care for it at all.

The second time I made this dish I used cheddar cheese instead of provolone, and fat-free sour cream.  The taste was still great. This one is definitely a keeper.  I also heat this up in the microwave and brown it under the broiler for a few minutes. Being a small family I divided this in two dishes and froze one.  Thawed it overnight in the refrigerator and it was good as fresh.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I use low fat cheeses and lean ground turkey and it is a delicious low fat meal that I can make on a Sunday and it lasts me and my boyfriend almost a whole week! Great meal for a budget, a diet, and someone with good taste!

Our family loved this recipe!  Mine would not quite fit in a 9x13 pan--it was huge, but so good.  The flavor was great.  I made it with light sour cream and switched layers with the parmesan cheese and put the mozzarella cheese on top.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe, we really enjoyed it!

This has become my families favorite dish.  I would make sure that the provolone smells okay before adding it though as sometimes is can have a strong smell.  It's always good to get it smoked and fresh from the deli.

I am a teenager and made it for my family. It was very easy and delicious. I would change nothing, but maybe using ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.

Wasn't as good as we expected after all the rave reviews. It was easy to put together though. Our granddaughters wouldn't eat it and my husband only had 1 helping. The second day it tasted a little better but wouldn't make it again.

Oh. My. God.

This. Is. So. Good.

I made it for a party to celebrate the new season of the Sopranos, and it was a huge success. But beware, it's really rich. A little goes a long way.

I've never made baked ziti before, but this was easy and delicious! I think the sour cream is the key ingredient that makes it so good. I'll definitely be making this the next time we have company!

This many reviews can't be wrong!  I used Mrs. Dash Italian on the layers for extra flavor...It's a Wednesday night staple at our house...It's meatless, healthy and delicious!  :)
And by the way, Paul Newmans sauce is the best I've found to go with this...

So yummy!!  My whole family & lots of friends have tried this and we all love it!  I am not a fan of ricotta cheese, so I was thrilled to find such an easy & delicious alternative to the usual ziti.  It's been made w/ ground turkey, turkey sausage and light versions of the sour cream & cheese and comes out delicious every time!

This recipe is DEEELISH! It is really really easy to make as well.

Although, I did not use 2 jars of tomato sauce- to me this is MUCH too much for the amount of pasta in the recipe. Instead, I used 1 jar of tomato sauce (one with tomato, garlic and portobello mushrooms) and covered the dish for 28 minutes. For the last 2 minutes, I turned the oven to BROIL to allow the cheese to bubble a bit.  Yummmm!  It was a total hit with my family, absolutely DELICIOUS. Thanks for the recipe. A keeper!

I made this for a Soprano's season finale watch party, and I believe it's better than Karen's ziti!  I substitued hot and mild Italian sausage for the ground beef, and used Kroger roasted garlic sauce with extra garlic.  Many compliments from my guests, and I already have requests to make it for an upcoming potluck.  Thanks!

My very Italian husband loves this dish. He's incredibly picky when it comes to italian food and this is one of he favorites. I substitue italian sausage for the ground beef and use Emeril's Gaaahlic Sauce....Incredible.

This dish is delicious!  I love lasagna but I think this tasted just as good as lasagna but easier to make!  Since it made so much I had left overs for the next 3 days which I didn't mind at all!!!  It's as good warmed up as it is fresh out of the oven!

Absolutely scrumptious and easy to make.  I've tried it as written, but also using ricotta instead of sour cream.  Fabulous both times.

I have never rated a recipe before, but this one is worth the time. I have never made baked ziti that has tasted this good before. The mixture of the 2 cheeses and the sour cream make all the difference. I made this with sausage and just layered it on top before that last layer of sauce. This will be the only ziti I will ever make again. Even my picky boys had second helpings.

I have made this about 15 times because it is one of my absolute favorites!  Any time I need a special meal, this is what I make.  I am always asked for the recipe.  I like to add some fresh sliced mushrooms as well.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

I left out the sour cream and added ricotta cheese.  It was extremely easy to put together and my family loved it, even my 6 year old son (pickiest eater I know).

Very good. Thank you for sharing Colleen. The taste is very similar to my Lasagna. I believe, I like the Lasagna noodles better than the Ziti macaroni though.

We loved this recipe.  Was quick to prepare (30 mins.)during a week night and my kids loved it.  I used Healthy Choice Traditional Sauce which I especially like.  Definitely will make again!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!! I think next time I will try with ricotta or Cottage cheese instead of sour cream - I do have to sort of agree with one other reviewer though - If your going to go to all of the trouble to make this, it is almost as easy to make a lasagna - its a nice change though and I will deffinetly add to my recipe box - Thanks

A really great tasting recipe without the hassle. I didnt add onions instead I added chopped garlic to the browning meat and the taste was amazing.
I will make this one again.

As with everyone else I loved this dish.  It was easy and very tasty.  I did make my own meat sauce using sausage to add some more flavor.  The sour cream took away some of the acidity of the tomatoes.  Deffinatly will make again.

This was fabulous! I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 pound pork sausage. The sauce I used was great..I used Ragu Robusto 7 herb tomato. After reading about the need for additional spices it seemed like a good choice. It worked great!!! It just fit into a 11x13 pan. Thanks for sharing!!

Made this for a football and it was a huge success!  I started cooking it near the beginning of the game, took it out to let it sit and served it at half time.  There was a leftover one which I froze uncooked for later.  I didn't have provolone, so I used mozzarella.  Tastes like lasagna, but much less work!  I may use a curly type pasta next time.

My family loved this recipe. I added a little garlic. I used half ground beef and half Italian sausage. I used a well known chef's sauce rather than a more commercial sauce, still saving time on a busy day. I give this thumbs up all the way.

This is a GREAT recipe! My chicken was so tender. Even my very picky 4 yr old loved it. The next bay I put a slice of provolone cheese on the leftover breast with some Marinara and baked until warm and melty - YUMMY!!

It was really good.  I eat this magnificent dish as much as possible.  It had one little weird taste to it, but I think that was my mom's fault.  She is not that good at cooking.  She could use a nutrtion class.

This ziti receipe was the best I've tried.  I substituted spicy Italian sausage for the ground beef and it was a "hit" w/my 4 kids and husband!  I definitely will prepare it again.

We all really loved this one. We didn't have any [provolone cheese so I used ricotta cheese instead. It was kind of hard to spread but it turned out great anyway. This recipe really makes A LOT.

This was really good, easy to prepare and I am NOT a good cook at all. Kids ate the whole thing, hubby raved and it even received my mom's seal of approval. I thought it could have used less sauce. I did cut back on it and it was very good.

This was easy to make and tasted great - suggested substitutions for lacto-ovo vegetarians: 1 lb.ground TVP for ground meat, 3/4 c. non-fat sour cream and 3/4 c. 1% fat cottage cheese for full fat sour cream, 2 jars low fat vegetarian pasta sauce, 12 oz. low fat mozzarella for all cheese and 2 TBSP Parmesan flavour "Veggie Topping" (made from organic tofu)

I was very disappointed with this recipe after reading so many great reviews. I did modify it as some reviewers had suggested by using 1/2 ricotta cheese with the sour cream, and using the Classico Tomato and Basil sauce. The sauce had a bad taste, but the cheese/sour cream mixture was fine. Plus, the 13x9 pan was way too small. I had enough left over to fill a casserole dish as well. If I ever try it again I will not use the Classico sauce and use a much bigger pan.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I used all non-fat items and it was very good.  I also added some italian seasoning and spices to add some kick.  

I halved the recipe and there will be enough for 3 meals for the two of us!!

Excellent recipe!

This is awesome!  I increased sour cream by 1/2 cup, and cheeses by 1 oz each.  Put a cookie sheet under pan!  This dish looks and tastes great.  Crowd-pleaser!!!

My husband really liked the cheesy-ness of this recipe.  I added a few red pepper flakes to the tomato sauce for some zip.  However, I found it a little boring.

We really liked this recipe.  It was quite expensive for what I consider a family meal, but I would definitely make it again.  Like so many others, I used a mixture of sour cream and ricotta.  For the sauce I used Classico "Tomato & Pesto".  I only used one jar and found it to be enough.

I made this a day ahead, but did not cook (except for the meat and ziti).  We thought is was just ok. I followed everyone's suggestions and did 1 cup ricotta and 1/2 cup of sour cream and Classico Tomatoe and Basil Sauce.  I think it would be better if everything was mixed together rather than layered.

This is a great recipe. My whole family loved it including my very picky husband, my 10 year old daughter and my 22 month old son. I will make this again. It does make a large pan, but that makes for very good leftovers for lunches for work or dinner the next day. I also only used a half cup of sour cream,mixed with  1 cup of ricotta cheese and it seemed runny to me so I added a cup of mozzarella to the mix-like you would do for lasagna.

We loved it! Thank you! Although I added ricotta and not so much sour cream. I thought it needed another spice or something, but maybe it was the sauce I used. Anyway it was yummy!

Best baked ziti I've ever tried.  It's so simple to make.  I used 1 cup ricotta and 1/2 cup sour cream.  It definitely taste better the second time

tried this for the first time.  was a hit with the family.  would also be good to add mushrooms to sause, and maybe use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.  overall it was delicious.

This was a Very good baked Ziti.  I did add some minced garlic to the meat/sauce mixture to give it a little extra flavor.  My husband loved it and the kids liked it too.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream, so I didn't put the entire amout in the dish, it turned out fabulous and so creamy!  It's a winner!!!!

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!! I substituted ricotta for the sour cream and it came out great! It's now my boyfriend's new favorite dish! I decided to experiment with it over the weekend and I'm going to make two huge trays for my father's birthday party this weekend. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!!!

This was a very easy recipe. I did make some changes though, I used my own tomatoe sauce instead of jar and only used 1/2 cup of sour cream and mixed it with 1 cup of ricotta cheese and the taste is great!

This was good - my husband and kids really loved it but I thought it was a little lacking in something - not sure what though.  I had to keep adding more sauce to it as it turned out kind of dry.  Not sure if I would make this again or not.

This recipe was soooo good! I took it to my aunt's house for Thanksgiving and of course everyone loved it. I used Classico's sauce and added onions to the Hot Italian Sausage. Perfect! My boyfriend loved it too. I'm going to make this again for sure.

Great Recipe, especially for people that don't cook too often.  To make it easier, you could use a tomato sauce that already has meat in it.  Thanks!

This was so good.  Even my 19 month old daughter gobbled it up!  I couldn't
find Ziti at the store I went to so I used Orzo pasta instead and it turned out
great plus it was easier for my daughter to eat with the Orzo.  I scaled the
recipe to serve 4 an used a little more sour cream and cheese then it called
for.  I will definitely make this again!!!

I just tried this recipe for the first time after getting hooked on HBO's 'The Sopranos' and always hearing the characters talk about it. It was delicious!I didn't use meat and instead put mushrooms in the sauce and it worked out just as well.I will definitely be making this over and over!

Very filling and yummy. I thought there was too much sauce and not enough noodles, so next time I'd try adding more noodles. Also it could use a little variety, so next time I make it I'll add some extra spices. Good, quick recipe!

This was quite tasty.  My 1 year old couldn't get enough!  I used Ragu 7-Herb sauce and left out the meat.  I only made half a recipie.  The full recipie would make copious amounts - but it tastes better the second day, so maybe that's a good thing!  Pair this up with Ken's minestrone soup (from All Recipies soup cookbook)and a nice salad and you'll have a great Italian meal.  P.S. - the soup tastes better the second day too!

A little too much sour cream for our taste, but an excellent meal nonetheless.

This recipe is great, I would make it for my college roommates throughout the year and we loved it.  I used an italian blend shredded cheese and it was really good and inexpensive.

Absolutely delicious! A keeper to my family, who loved this dish. It was very easy to prepare. I definitely will be making it again, but will add some garlic and probably substitute Italian sausage instead of the beef.

This was delicious.  I was skeptical about the sour cream instead of ricotta but it was great.  I did use my own sauce instead of jar but if in a hurry, jar is the way to go.  Hubby loved it.  And that's saying a lot!!!

I cut down on a few ingredients for example I used only 1/2lb of ground meat, I did not use an onion and it was still very delicious.

This dish went over extrememly well when I brought it to the office for lunch.  My co-workers (especially the men) raved over it.  My only changes I will be making is to use another cheese in place of the provolone.  I also thought it tasted much better the second day. All in all, I will be hanging on to this recipe!

What a shame that I can't give this recipe 6 stars. It's delicious and so easy to prepare. I think it will be a long time before I make lasagna again. We don't care for provolone cheese, so I substituted sliced sharp cheddar. I made half the recipe but used the full pound of ground beef. I also baked this half recipe in a Corningware baking pan that's a tad smaller than 8X11" and it wasn't too big. Thanks for sharing, Colleen, this is now a favorite in this family.

This was great definitly need a bigger pan....maybe a 8x8 and a 9x13. Make sure you use a spagetti sauce you like otherwise it can be disapointing.

Makes 8 HUGE servings. Like many others, we substituted hot italian sausage for the ground beef, and light sour cream for the sour cream. It was very rich & very cheesy - but also VERY good. Friends and I cook it, and eat while watching "The Sopranos", then dig our way out of leftovers for the rest of the week.

This was a nice change recipe but here are some suggestions: use a 9 by 13 inch pan deffaintly.  I only used one jar of spaghetti sauce and even then the pan was overflowing!

This was great, although I also added Italian sausage and garlic salt.  My husband really enjoyed it, and I will for sure be making this again! It makes a nice size pan.  We had left overs and nobody complained when I served them.

The sour cream was just too much.  Maybe if you tried it cut way down, or maybe 
even without it completely it would be better.

WOW!! What a great dish. This will be a good dish for company. Good leftover also. I did make one alteration though. I only used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce. I thought 2 sounded like too much. It was terrific with 1 jar. My family has already asked me to make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Similiar to a lasagna with ziti noodles instead of lasagna noodles.  Husband and kids loved it and it was a lot simpler but similiar to lasagna.  However, it makes a huge serving so I will cut the recipe in half next time and use extra sauce because it was a little dry.

This recipe is GREAT!!!  I added some fresh garlic to the hamburger and onion while cooking.  I also used a spaghetti sauce with pepperoni.  It turned out wonderful.  My 17 year old son said this was the best Italian recipe I have ever made.

Delicious!  The sour cream is a wonderful touch!  I reduced the fat by using ground turkey and fat-free sour cream.  It tastes just as good.

I recently used this recipe for a wedding reception and used the scaled units. One bit of info if you are using this amount(for 100 people), you may want to cook less ziti then it calls for because with that amt. it will continue to cook in the colander. With everything going on, I had to leave it many times and came back to sticky ziti. I did put it back in the pan and ran cold water over it and drained it again. It worked well. I should have put a teaspoon of oil in the water while cooking the ziti, that might of helped. Just don't overcook the ziti. We are still getting compliments on the food. We also froze the leftovers and they are just as tasty so this could be made ahead and frozen for the big day.

I've made this three times now and it is always well received.  It tastes just as good with low fat sour cream, low fat mozzarella and fat free sauce.

I'm Italian and having cooked and eaten great Italian food over the years, I have to say that this is the best Baked Ziti I have ever eaten. The creamy layer of provolone & sour cream in the middle add great taste & texture. I added extra garlic & about 2 tblsp. of sugar to the sauce ("Five Brothers" or "Classico" Tomato & Basil were great)to give it a mildly sweeter taste. It is best to make this in a 9 X 13 in. pan - it was filled to the top. I then topped it with Kraft Parmesan cheese with garlic....it was fantastic!

Mmmmm!  Delicoius!  I've never made ti with the meat, but even without its just soooo good!  Thsi is my favorite recipe-- and my family's too.  I find that if you dump all the ingredients into a big bowl and mix it up (noodles, too) and then just spread that on the baking pan, it goes faster and its cheesier and gooey-er.  Its quick to whip up, just takes awhile to bake

Good meal!  I added sauteed onions and green peppers to the sauce and cut out the provolone cheese.  Very good, but I think next time I might cut out the sour cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We made this for our daughter's christening. It was a big hit, but we had to add sugar and spices to the sauce to get the right flavor for our family.

I think the 8x12 baking dish is not big enough to use all the ingredients.  I used a 13x9 and still had some pasta and sauce left over.

I thought this was a very tasty yet simple dish to make.  I'm sure I'll make it again but I think I'll try using low fat instead of nonfat sour cream.  The nonfat gave it sort of a weird taste.  Fat free mozarella worked out fine though.  I would also use a bigger dish.  Good recipe!

I made this recipe for my family using Delmonte's "Traditional" flavor spahetti sauce in a 26.5 oz. can.  I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and just a wee bit of salt and pepper to the meat as I browned it.  Also added a dab or two of Worchestershire sauce to the meat as it was browning. The results were fabulous.  The whole family loved it and I have since passed the recipe to two friends who have made it and loved it.  This one is a definate keeper.  It taste even better warmed up the next day.
Thanks to the author for sharing this recipe.

I made this last night for my family. Everyone liked it. I substituted elbow macaroni for ziti. I didn't have any ziti on hand, and didn't feel like going to the store. Still tasted fine. I will probably make this again.

My husband always does the cooking in our house, and he always made us eat "his version" of a pasta/cheese casserole, UNTIL I made this - the whole family LOVED it-and I added some garlic and Monteray Jack cheese. I will make this often ! Thanks ! Marianne

Very good baked ziti .. I made my own sauce rather than the jarred sauce and used pepperoni instead of ground beef, but the mixture of cheeses gave the ziti good flavor and the sour cream (i used 1/2 as much as called for) made it more creamy

Like a lasagne.  I couldn't find any Ziti pasta anywhere, so I just used curly noodles.  I think it was supposed to have flat noodles, like a lasagne. It was pretty good.  The flavourful cheese was what made it really good.

As a professional chef and busy Mom I tried this for my very picky children. It was super easy and a definate winner for a quick dinner. We are Italian by descent and this is the first time I ever used a canned tomato sauce. Great for those pot luck dinners we always have to get to.

Great recipe!  I did have to alter the pan size and the second time I made it I used ricotta cheese and mixed in half as much sour cream.  Both times my family loved it.  There were left-overs, but only for one day.  My two grandkids (5&2) both ate thirds!

This recipe was a "no-brainer".  It was farily quick and super easy.  The whole family liked it, even my son who usually "disects" his food before he tries it.  If you like pasta then you should give this recipe a try.  (We will have leftovers tomorrow, we'll see if it gets dry).

This baked ziti was very good!! I made it the way the recipe says, except I  mixed the sauce and ziti together instead of keeping it separate!! My family ate the whole thing except for a little of the corner left. I also used a deeper dish pan. I will be making this again..

It was good, but I would definitely not use sour cream next time.  I would substitute ricotta cheese for the sour cream or mascarpone.

Delicious! I couldn't find ziti at the store, so I used a different pasta.  Easy to throw together and bake. Very cheesy. Sour cream was a very nice touch!

We have tried three different ziti recipes from this website over the years, and so far this is our favorite.  My husband and son are not sour cream fans, but they liked this recipe better than those with ricotta.   I made a couple of modifications - no onions and 2c of sour cream instead of 1.5. We will make it again for sure!

Been making this for years from your recipe. It's a family favorite. I don't change a thing, nor do I cover it when baking. It cooks up perfectly every time and is so easy and absolutely wonderful!

I made this recipe as directed.  I drained the meat after cooking and used Prego sauce (meat flavor).  I might have used a little less sour cream than instructed- I just eye balled the measurement.  I wouldn't change a thing about this... I've made it several times and it's always delicious.

After reading a 2-star review, I took some recommended changes and made a few others.  Substituted 1-lb of low-fat ricotta cheese for 1 c. of sour cream, blended it 1/2 c. sour cream and 1 egg and then combined it with the ziti.  Used 1/2 lb hamburger and 1/2 lb mild Italian sausage.  Spread sauce on the bottom of the pan, eliminating butter or oil, left out provolone cheese.  Layered sauce, ziti-ricotta cheese mixture, sprinkle of Italian herbs, 1/2 c of mozzarella cheese, repeated the layers, topped with a layer of sauce, shredded mozzarella and slices of fresh mozzarella on top.  Baked covered for 30 min, then uncovered for another 15 min.  Delish!

love this recipe! I do make a few substitutions though-Italian sausage instead of ground beef, all italian cheese blend instead of the mozz/provolone, and ricotta with chopped fresh parsley mixed in instead of sour cream.  To be fair I have never done the original, but this is delicious!!

My family loved this. My husband HATES ricotta cheese so the sour cream made it so that I can make this again for the 1st time in years. The sour cream was difficult to spread individually so I mixed it with the sauce. I also used 6 slices of provolone to cover the baking dish and covered the top the same way with the mozzarella when called for. We're cheese people. Very delicious.

I make a homemade lasagna sauce when we do this but that being said my 6 children love it! We even go so far as to make  a lactose free version for my 3 intolerant kids. Usually double both and freeze one each version. Awesome!

This turned out awesome.  I also followed others suggestions about mixing the noodles with the sour cream.  I also added a little ricotta to the mix as well.

Served this for guests last night and it was a hit! Only changes were adding mushrooms, garlic and red pepper.  Made ahead, refrigerated, then baked for 1 1/4 hours. Made a ton of ziti. Next time (and there will be a next time) will either halve the recipe or use 2 smaller baking dishes. This was so heavy I could hardly lift it!

Amazing Baked Ziti is what it should be called. My husband is a picky eater and he absolutely loved it. I added a little bit of parsley to garnish the top and some pepper flakes. I also like my noodles to soak in my homemade spaghetti sauce. I will definitely be making this again

i have made this recipe several times, over the years and absolutely love sour cream instead of ricotta.  there is no such thing as "more italian" as one reviewer suggested.  over the years i have substituted sour cream for ricotta and it is actually better and not so bland. As for covering it, thats just common sense.  I have fussy eaters and this is sure to please. its guaranteed to be all gone with no leftovers.  
i dont usually write reviews but the dumb bad reviews, sparked me to write this. taking away 2 stars cause you didnt have common sense to cover it is ridiculous and you dont give a rating unless you made it.
I have also made it and froze it before baking for a great ready to bake meal.

I made this as is and it was good but didn't get the wow factor. Needed more mozzerella as I'm used to putting a whole bag on the top of mine. Tasted must better warmed up with extra mozzerella cheese.

Super easy recipe. The only change I would make is to trade out Ricotta cheese for the sour cream as it was bland for our taste. That being said, everyone's plates were still empty at the end of the meal, so it's a hit in my book.

I made this for my son’s Italian themed wedding reception. People came back for seconds and thirds. My husband is RAVING as he eats next day leftovers ( that is what prompted me to write this review). No question... Sour cream is the secret ingredient to keep it moist and creamy. I added small tub of ricotta.... just to feel better about my Italian heritage. Lol!

Used ground turkey instead of beef, along with a Mexican spice mix to flavor the meat.  All the rest I kept the same.  Delicious!

This was a fast and easy family favorite! I only used 1 jar of sauce (Fire Roasted Tomato & Garlic). Also, instead of topping with Parmesan Cheese I used Shredded Smoked Gouda. It turn out great and everyone had two servings. I convection oven baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, topped with cheese and baked for 5 extra minutes.

This was delicious. I made my own sauce with spicy Italian sausage and hamburger meat. The sour cream (to which I added an egg and parsley, about 1/2 cup parsley) was creamy, saucy, and a hit with the family.

Substituted ricotta cheese for the sour cream.  Added some pepperonis and added 1 more jar of spaghetti sauce and covered it with foil! This is definitely a huge portion so we ate it for 3 days.  Love leftovers!

This was excellent!  We only have 2 in our house that we’re going to eat this, so I cut down to one can of spaghetti sauce and cut down the pasta a bit.  I used about a cup of sour cream and since I didn’t have provolone I just used 8 oz of mozzarella.  Next time I will add some canned mushrooms.  I will definitely make again!

This is a great easy-to-make dish! I read a number of reviews and made the following adjustments: use a large 9x13 casserole dish and add 1-3 cloves of garlic to meat and onion while browning, and use a high quality pasta sauce.  I use penne pasta because I have not seen ziti here yet, and I found using a shredded mozzarella/provolone/Parmesan cheese mix a real time saver. I mixed the pasta and sauce as one layer, and also use light sour cream as this is a very high fat dish already. Covered with aluminum foil which is removed at the end and broiled for 2 min to brown on the top. A keeper!

5 stars. Amazing. I used some tips in the reviews cause it sounded like I’d like it better. So I used 16oz of ricotta instead of sour cream, added one egg to the ricotta and then I mixed this into the cooked pasta noodles (I use penne cause that’s easier for me to find) so that way they’re all evenly coated with the ricotta/egg mix. I use closer to 2lbs of ground beef because my husband like it’s really meaty. The other thing I do it I use only mozzarella cheese cause I don’t love provolone, I grate a little bit of fresh Parmesan reggiano between the layers.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made my own spaghetti sauce and changed the order of the layers.  I placed the ziti, then sauce, then provolone and again the ziti, sauce and mozzarella.  I also covered the dish with aluminum foil while baking.  I left off the sour cream, but only because my son was watching me, and wouldn’t have eaten it otherwise.  It was still good.

Didn't change a thing and it was great!!  This will be my new go-to baked ziti recipe!  It does make quite a bit, so use a large baking dish, or plan to use a 9x13" dish and an 8x8" or 9x9"  dish as well.

*11/17/19:  I used ground turkey and doubled it.  I also added two bell peppers and some mushrooms.  I also sprinkled on some garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes.  I used tomato basil sauce.  I would add more seasoning next time.  I also covered the dish with foil while cooking.  I would take this off sooner next time to give the top time to brown a bit.  Good.

This is a fantastic recipe AS WRITTEN. If you don’t like sour cream required then use another recipe that calls for ricotta. There are plenty. The sour cream in this adds a different flavor and texture that I prefer over ricotta. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Been using this recipe for years, always a hit in our family! We only use mild or hot Italian sausage, not ground beef. Once the pasta is cooked and drained, I mix the pasta and the sour cream together in the same pot I cooked the pasta in, then put 1/2 if it into the baking pan in order to ensure all the sour cream is evenly distributed. Other than that I follow the recipe as instructed and add a little more sauce, if needed.

This is a great meal for a cold night and a big group! Here are the changes I made - I used Rigatoni instead of Ziti - I used a tub of cottage cheese in place of the sour cream, mixed that together with one egg and 1 cup of shredded “pizza blend” cheese - cooked diced onion, garlic & a shredded carrot in olive oil and then added a jar of pasta sauce, a can of crushed tomatoes, oregano, parsley, onion powder and basil - spread 1 cup of sauce on bottom of pan, then a layer of drained noodles, a layer of the cheese mixture (kinda plop blobs of it on top and spread as best you can with a rubber spatula) a layer of sauce, the rest of the noodles, the rest of the cheese mixture and then make sure there is sauce all the way around the edges so the noodles don’t get dried out.

My daughter is not a big ricotta cheese fan so I decided to try this recipe and I am so happy that I did! Everyone loved it! The only things I changed was that I substituted sweet sausage for the ground beef and I added minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the sausage and onion while it was cooking. I also mixed the ziti with the sauce mixture before adding it to the baking dish. great recipe. I made it the day before and refrigerated it, so I let it sit out for 30 minutes,  baked it covered for 1 hour, removed the cover to let the mozzarella melt, baked it for another 15 minutes, then let stand for 15 minutes. It needed all that extra time.

This has to be the best Baked Ziti I have ever had .  In my opinion, it has to be the addition of provolone and the sour cream that have put the taste over the top.  Everyone who tried this loved it and asked for more.  All I added was red pepper flakes and used tin foil for the first 20 minutes and then exposed the ziti for the rest of the baking.  Also used a little more sauce, starting as a bottom layer and finishing with sauce on top.

I would use a little less sour cream because it made it taste a little too heavy, but overall so good. Will make again!

My go-to ziti recipe! I find that one jar of spaghetti sauce is enough and I usually add more mozzarella.

I only followed the time to bake recipe. But the one I made was delicious haha. I just mixed ricotta, sour cream, and mozzarella together for the cheese sauce and added black pepper and a no salt organic spice. Super delicious

This is an AMAZING recipe.  I've been making it for years.  I use ground turkey instead of ground beef.

The sour cream is an amazing substitute for ricotta.  I'm not a fan of ricotta, and if you're not either, the sour cream is a great substitute.

I might try adding spicy italian sausage to the sauce one of these times!

I made this (mostly) to the recipe and we really enjoyed it. I changed the layering a little, but most of my ingredients were the same. I didn't cover mine either and had no problems with it drying out. The two changes I would make for me if I make it again is that I would use ricotta cheese as some others have said and bulk Italian sausage. Kudos! however, for a fairly quick and easy recipe that turned out so tasty.

I modified with a ricotta, egg yolk, and parmesan layer similar to lasagna. MY SO loved it. It made a very full 13x9 pan.  For small families, this could easily be split among tins, frozen, and baked at a later time.

I love the simplicity of this recipe and how easy it all comes together.  The only change I made was swapping the ground beef for ground Italian sausage, it just adds another layer of flavor.

This is a family favorite. I have been making it, as written, for a  few years now. I do nothing different, except use a home made spaghetti sauce. It's great as leftovers, too.

I tweaked original recipe when I saw recommendation to swap provolone and sour cream with ricotta mixed with one egg. I added oregano. It was perfect. There is just the two of us so after dinner I had leftovers to freeze and make 2 more dinners and 3 lunches. Happy happy husband!

A delicious dish! I made a homemade tomato sauce from Betty Crocker cookbook, instead of spaghetti sauce.  I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings, but it still could have easily fed 6 to 8 people.

I always follow directions, just as I was putting the pan in the oven I realized I forgot to put the shredded mozzarella!  I used the sliced provolone in both layers!  It was delicious, we loved it and I will make it this way again!  I used ricotta with one egg mixed in it instead of sour cream. 
Side note, I made this one handed, my left arm is in a cast,  so one mistake is pretty good

My family and I really didn't like the recipe at all with the sour cream, I've tried some with ricotta that was so much better. Will definitely not make this again.

This was so easy and delicious.  I didn't have provolone so I used mozzarella only ( more than the recipe called for to make up for the lack of provolone).  I bet this would also be good if you used half Italian sausage and half ground beef too!

This was good but if I make it again I’ll try it using the suggestion for ricotta cheese. After it had set I could taste the sour cream well way more than I cared for. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this dish. The sour cream is so good in this. The only thing I did different was to mix the sour cream with the pasta and then followed the rest of the layering. Makes a lot but I freeze what we don't eat. It's great reheated.

A new favorite!!  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and kept all other ingredients the same as listed in the recipe.  We love it!  Thanks!
Note:  This recipe was very easy to cut down to half, which was perfect for my small family.

I didn't have any provolone so I used more mozzarella and took someone else's advice about layering with the sauce right on top of the pasta. I also added some fresh garlic, garlic powder and italian seasoning.  It turned out wonderfully and my family really liked it.  a keeper.

Ok, the only modification I made was to mix the sauce with the noodles. It just didn't sound like the sauce was going to get through the provolone/sour cream barrier. 

That being said, my family and I did not care for the sour cream. My husband rated it a 2. And we love sour cream! Just not in this...I think I will make it again, just substitute ricotta mixture for the sour cream.I love the ricotta mix from Chef John's lasagna...

I am not a cook. I hate cooking. I’m terrible at cooking, but now I have a 1yr old and I thought, I should start making diners. This is one of the first recipes I’ve decided to try. I made it tonight for the first time and it actually came out REALLY good. My husband said I “killed it”. Which is a big deal for me that he enjoyed a dinner I made. My 1 yr old even ate every bite on her plate. It was a success! Easy and delicious. Thank you!

This was delicious as far as taste goes. I couldn’t find ziti at the store so substituted the slightly larger penne and layered the same. Baked uncovered. Worked out well. I didn’t have the exact amount of sauce as jars vary so added tomato sauce. I had a lot left over. I made sure I spread everything out to the corners too. I’ll make again but I will make sure I use ziti for real.

This was delicious!!! I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream, and I added about 1/4 tbsp salt mixed into it. I did the layers differently as well. I put sauce on the bottom to prevent the noodles sticking to the pan, and also on top to keep everything from becoming dry or burning. It was an absolute hit with the family. We'll definitely be repeating this!!!

I am rating this 5 stars and I made as directed. No changes no substitutions. I see someone commented about not covering while baking and theirs dried out. I baked mine UNCOVERED and mine did not dry out. I was leery of using sour cream instead of cottage cheese or ricotta cheese but I had some faith and was not disappointed. I actually had intended to add some green pepper but forgot. Next time I make this I am going to substitute half the beef for Italian sausage and add green pepper. Kudos to the author for a wonderful recipe.

Instead of shredded mozzarella, I used shredded colby jack, and use gluten free pasta since I have celiac and cannot have regular pasta.  It is a quick, easy and delicious meal!

I've been making this regularly for several years now, and it's always wonderful. It's a very friendly recipe to those of us that don't enjoy cooking and aren't all that great at it either.  I don't add the onions, I cut the sour cream quantity in half, and I use a little extra mozzarella, otherwise I use this recipe as written. I often mix up the brand and flavor of jar spaghetti sauce I use to get a little different taste. It's always a huge family favorite! Some people suggest using ricotta, but my family does not enjoy ricotta, so we use the sliced provolone. Also, some people insist that you must cover this dish or else it dries out...I've made this at least 30 times and it has never dried out; I would suggest those people are only using 1 (26 oz) jar of sauce instead of 2 as the recipe calls for.  If you prepare this ahead and refrigerate it before cooking, it will take 45 to 60 minutes to heat all the way through, so that is the only time you need to cover the top.

Added about two tablespoons of sugar to offset the tomato acid. I use my own homegrown spaghetti sauce with one can of tomato paste, and the amount was just right. Put it in a 4 qt casserole, and it was half gone by the time I got home from an errand! Only two people ate that much! Lol

Made it as listed-yummy. It’s easy and makes a LOT. I did layer differently. I don’t know if it really makes that much of a difference, if any at all.  It’s just like lasagna except with different pasta. Since I like ricotta, I’ll try that next time instead of sour cream.

Hey Y'all! WOW! Small word describing HUGE taste!!And Gator I couldn't agree with you more! How on Earth can anyone judge a recipe if they're changing around the ingredients?  Even the way they cook it?  Gator here's a small headsup for ya: Ricotta cheese was born and bred for this dish!!?? It really does make a BIG DIFFERENCE, at least for me, when subbing the ricotta as opposed to the provolone, etc. I'm going to hit the market tomorrow & get the fixins' to include all of these ingredients with plans for a Sat nite throwdown!! Stay tuned will update my review and let y'all know how it went.

Dee licious. They sell shredded mozzarella and provolone mix at my local store.  I did mess up and forgot to add the sour cream. Fortunately I just added it to the sauce in the final layer.  Fabulous

This is a great ziti recipe! Perfect amount of sauce and cheese. I didn't make any changes (except I added some herbs/spices cause the sauce I used was kinda plain) and it came out great. My family loved it! This makes a huge amount which was ok for us because we love leftovers.

This recipe came out great! I followed the recipe exactly except, I added a little more cheese at the top, and it was covered for 25 minutes and uncovered the last 5 minutes. It was absolutely delicious. This was my first time having baked ziti and it will not be the last time in me making it. My family ate it all.

Excellent flavor!  The bottom layer is sauce so that it is next to the pasta for absorption.  The sauce used is tomato basil.   Baking was done without a cover.  The baked ziti is browned on top and is moist.  Thank you.

I made it exactly by the recipe except I covered it but I ended up uncovering it at the end and it still wasn’t as hot as I would’ve wanted.  My oven temperature is off so that’s part of the issue.  It tasted amazing regardless though!  It’s very flavorful and the sour cream is a perfect touch and the cheese layers yummy

I made this almost exactly as written. I used spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef since we like spicy around our house. I liked it. My husband loved it. My kids wouldn’t eat it. Go figure.

Made this for a quick supper last night. When I got home from the store I realized the bagger didn't give me my ziti or onion, so I ended up using fettuccini I had on hand which I broke up into 3rds, then sub'd in some onion flakes and minced garlic. It still turned out fantastic and my entire family loved it! It made enough that I had about half left so I froze the rest for a quick meal another night.  Can't wait to try it when I have all of the correct ingredients :).

Came out pretty good for something so simple. Used bow tie pasta instead of ziti.  Will probably use ricotta cheese next time.

I made this recipe exactly as stated. I don’t have a picture to post, because the family already ate all of it! I will probably take other reviewers’ recommendation and cover it while cooking next time, but this is a great recipe as is.  It would taste wonderful as a vegetarian dish substituting mushrooms for the meat as well. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Favorite of family and friends. I make it with my own meat sauce and mix in a little bit of sour cream in to that to cut the acid. In our house we call it Meaty Ziti! ;)

Did not make any changes.  I like to rate recipes as is then make changes, if necessary, the next time.  Excellent flavor, easy to assemble, easy to bake.  Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and it turned out great.  It's just my husband and me, so I made a half recipe.  I did what one other reviewer did...I mixed sour cream and ricotta together... yummy! I also didn't see that it called for Provolone, until I was making it. I had two slices, so I used those plus mozzarella slices. This is a great base recipe for any sauce. I had leftover homemade so I mixed that with the jar sauce I had.  This an easy one to do. I want sure how it would do not mixed altogether but it was moist and cheesy!! Just the way we like it  great recipe!! Thanks!!!

This was great! Even my kids liked it! I just used italian sausage, no hamburger. It also made so much, I could not fit it all in a large 13x9 cake pan, I had to put some into a small 8x8 pan.

Best recipe that I've found for baked ziti yet! I read review's and altered only 2 things. I put the sauce directly over the ziti while layering and did half sour cream half ricotta for the sour cream layer. Oh! Also made this meatless! Excellent!

....I didn’t finish my original review. The sour cream makes this dish!  I was hesitant at first but definitely use it!!  For those who say use ricotta cheese... you are missing out. It makes the dish rich and creamy!  Don’t forget to butter your pan and cover with foil when baking so it doesn’t dry out!   ENJOY!

This is one of my favorite dishes. I use morning star vegetarian beef since I don't mix meat and dairy. I also get a bag of mixed cheese from Costco instead of buying all the individual cheeses. Truly phenomenal Ziti.

Major hit with the family! Instead of beef I used ground turkey. Plus I added bacon and red pepper flakes.

I made this dish on Saturday and it was enough food to feed a small army. It was all gone by Monday night! HUGE hit in my household and it was my favorite ziti I’ve ever tried anywhere! I used a little less cheese than it called for, and I also used 50/50 Alfredo and spaghetti sauce to get a more creamy sauce. IT WAS AWESOME!

The Sour Cream & Provolone cheese were the magic ingredients. I will never again use Ricotta Cheese, instead use 1/2 Sour Cream & 1/2 Ricotta Cheese in my Lasagna or Stuffed shells. It also gives it a great Flavor. It would b easy to make this as a Vegetarian dish as well. Just us Mushrooms and other veggies instead of meats. That would be easy as other reviewers have posted.

This was a real winner for us. I did follow other recommendations and mixed the sauce with the noodles  and then layered that with the cheese/sour cream. I also covered the dish for baking and took the cover off for the last 10min. Came out great! I know that "purest" won't like the sub of the provolone and sour cream for ricotta, but I think it really added a different tanginess to the plate. We will definitely make this again.

I made this for a school event and everyone loved it! I seasoned the meat with some “adobo” before browning it. Added the sauce once the meat was almost fully cooked. It turned out to be a very flavorful dish.

I also substituted the meat with Gardein’s beefless ground for my vegetarian daughter and it turned out just as good.

I had to put this in a 10x14 because there was a lot. Had to sub egg noodles for the ziti and included a little cottage cheese with the sour cream, bkz there wasn't enough.  Either way, the basic recipe is great.

I made it!  The recipe was simple to follow, but I added a few things. I added crumbled bacon and ricotta cheese. I also went to a store without ziti, so I substituted it for rigatoni. My family enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe.

I took LP’s recommendation and used ricotta instead of sour cream and it turned out perfect! Just like the baked ziti from my favorite Italian restaurant!

I made this recipe different  because I only had certain things on hand. I made it the way I would typically make baked penne, in terms of seasonings, canned tomatoes/sauce, and using ground up sausage. I used shredded cheese for both cheese layers. I was intrigued by the sour cream option as I had some leftover and wanted to use it. It came okay. It didn't dry out but it tasted different. The sour cream seemed good, but awkward. You could tell it was not ricotta and your taste buds were like, wait a minute.... It was an interesting change and I'll eat the leftovers 
 but I likely won't make it again.

Very good ziti, not the best I’ve ever had. 
By the way, if you click on the little pie chart looking button near the top of the page (before ingredients) you can change the serving size. I saw a lot of people saying the recipe is huge. I tuned mine to 4 people and it was still a entire dish full.

I thought the sour cream would be gross but it wasn’t.  I used a bunch of meatballs instead of ground beef. I used 6 oz of mozzarella and six ounces of some “Italian blend.”  Instead of provolone. I’m sure it would be great regardless but hey it’s what I had. I thought it was great!!

I added a thawed 10 ounce package of chopped frozen spinach, mixed the spinach with the sour cream.  I love lasagna Florentine, and this is easier.  I used Newman’s Own Marinara sauce which I thoroughly enjoy.

My family finds the suggestion of using ricotta great! We add it rather than substitute it and typically use 50% more provolone, parmesan and sour cream and bake the Ziti longer (min. 45-50 minutes). Not exactly low-cal or low-fat, but delicious!

Me and my family absolutely loved this dish! We never thought to try putting sour cream in the recipe, but it turned out to be one of the best parts of the dish. This dish even tasted good after being reheated in the microwave, so that's a plus.

This truly is a great easy peasy recipe.  One just has to remember to season the meat.  I seasoned my meat with garlic salt, Italian seasoning and red pepper.  Garlic (fresh or powdered) is a must! Make sure to season the meat for a flavor boost.  I also agree with other reviewers who covered the dish to ensure the noodles don't get crunchy.  I also just baked for 20-25min.  It's more than enough time to get the cheese melty.

I really did not care for this recipe.  I think the sour cream made it have an "off taste."  I think if the sour cream was left out it might have been okay.

It’s now my go-to ziti recipe. Have made it about 4 times now. I do- make pasta and mix with the sauce in the first layer. I also put the sour cream in a baggie and cut  off the corner to make the spreading easier (helps if sour cream isn’t right out of fridge.) Then mix the second batch of ziti with the sauce for top layer. Add more sauce than you think you will need. It does dry while cooking, even though I foil it and then broil last 5 minutes (without foil) to be nice and bubbly.

Good taste, but the proportion of pasta to meat is way off. I didn't even use the whole pound of pasta and there still wasn't enough meat. Two pounds would have worked. Also didn't care for the sour cream. Maybe it would be OK mixed in with some of the sauce?

I made this last night for dinner and the family really liked it. I'm only giving four stars because I had substitute shredded mozzarella cheese for the provolone. This is a great hearty fall meal served with garlic bread. YUM! We will be making again!

I made this for dinner one night and my family loved it including my picky 4 year old.  I substituted the remainder of my provolone cheese and feista mix for the parmesan cheese and cheddar.

This is a great base to work from. Sour cream was a pleasant surprise in this. Only four stars because the provolone was a little strong for me and I altered the recipe to 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 beef. Second time around I used 3 oz shredded provolone and 8oz shredded motz and enjoyed it much more. As recommended I stirred sour cream into cooked pasta as my first step. I prefer to stir in sauce and then cheese in a bowl before transferring to my baking pan. This dish was devoured.

Yes, ricotta would be a large improvement! add an egg and plenty of chopped basil and spinach. Also skip the provolone for mozzerella on and in.  Jarred sauce is never friendly.
Make real with garlic and basil. Use rigatoni instead of ziti and last of all, don't use this recipe.

My family loves this recipe. Made this as written originally, and then made a few changes. The layers (and the effort) were not appreciated, and I have toddlers and they need homogeneity.  So to make it easier, I cook the carrots (love that they're hidden in here), onions and 20 oz ground turkey together, then mix with the spaghetti sauce, mozzarella, 24 ounces cottage cheese (I loved the sour cream but wanted extra protein for the kids) and elbows (easier for toddlers). I can't bear to use 3/4 of a package of mozzarella, so I use the entire 8 ounces.  Pour in half into the baking dish, layer the provolone (love this), and then pour the other half. It makes so much and is so comforting, and doing it this way makes it SO MUCH FASTER which is great for busy moms. I always worry that there will be too much sauce but I swear it works out perfectly every time. I didn't have any problems with drying out (it's only 30 minutes for a full to the brim baking dish), or sticking - I used parchment paper or aluminum foil which is totally nonstick.

This was so good! It wasn’t dry what so ever! The taste was perfect. I was skeptical but with the reviews  convinced me. I didn’t layer mine I mixed it all together. Rather then just ground beef I might try sausage next time!

Amazing! This would also taste outstanding in the original form, too, but I just made a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used 1 lb grd. turkey and I used 1 cup Ricotta cheese and 1 cup sour cream blended together. I ACCIDENTALLY omitted the mozzarella cheese...I just noticed that now, but no need for it with the provolone slices. I also layered differently with a cup of sauce on the bottom first, then noodles, then provolone slices, ricotta/sour cream, sauce again...and continue from there in same order with sauce  and then the Parmesan over the top.  There was plenty of sauce for all of that!  My 16 yr. old son ate 2 big helpings.  Also, because my 3 girls are at college, I made the whole recipe but divided it between two casserole dishes and froze one for another meal.  Definitely try this!

This was yummy. My family had mixed feelings about it but my toddler seemed to love it. The only things I changed was the order of the layers. Like others suggested, I covered the ziti in the sauce then layered the cheese and sour cream. I also did half ground beef and half mild Italian sausage, which I seasoned with salt & pepper.

It made a lot, it fully filled a glass 11x17in baking dish and some sauce bubbled out onto the oven floor but I did not have to prepare a second dish for it, the one 11x17 was enough as the recipe states. I think our family of 5 could eat from this 1 meal, 3 times. I could see making this for company or a sick friend, etc.

Thanks for sharing a great meal!

My whole family loved it. I used extra cheese and substituted both the provolone and the sour cream for two cups of ricotta, and we preferred it that way. I definitely recommend this recipe, however, the preparation time is about forty-five minutes, even with help, not half an hour.

Delicious!  I've made it without the sour cream and it was good.  The sour cream, however, makes it extraordinary.  Everyone loved it!  Believe me, this recipe goes a LONG way.  Use caution when increasing the number of servings or you may need to have another baking pan on hand (which isn't the worst thing in the world)!

This was my first time making baked ziti.  As another reviewer suggested, I replaced the sour cream with ricotta and 1 egg and left out the provolone.  Put sauce on bottom layer, then ziti mixed with ricotta then cheese.  2nd layer ziti, cheese then sauce.  Everyone loved it!

Easy to make, served well, but it was bland and far too rich.

This is the absolute BEST pasta dish I’ve ever made and so so good. I only changed the layering: Before layering, I mixed all the pasta and sauce together. Pasta and meat sauce, then I chopped provolone up and mixed with sour cream and spread that on, then sauce/pasta, then mozzarella and Parmesan on top. So I kept the recipe the same, just modified the layering

Wow, the review thing keeps disappearing before I’m finished. Ok, yes everyone is asking me to make this at family get together now and even others that hear I’m making it again are asking to come over too. Ha Ha... Like even Ex’s! 
   So I’d say it couldn’t be anymore of a big hit. Thank you and good luck all.

I made it as directed other than mixing the meat with the sauce, then layering.  It was a little dry even though I covered it with foil.  I would make this again but use another 1/2 jar of sauce.

Omitted the onion. This was fantastic! We're a family of 11, and every single one of my kids liked this meal. That's a feat right there! Definitely COVER this dish if you want it to stay moist, and I agree that you may need an extra dish because it makes A LOT. It fed all of us with some left over.

Nice and easy recipe my family loved my ziti recipe from before but they like this one too, I left out the salt for health reasons but added parsley and black pepper for taste.  It came out quite well, thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was very good, and I will make it again. The next time, however, I will add a bit of hot chile pepper for more zing. Although it was tasty, it was a little bland for my taste.

I didn't make any changes except make some Italian mild sausages and slice them and add them to the first layer because my kid kept asking for me to make my spaghetti and sausages, but iit takes so long, but she really wanted the Italian sausages. I was nervous about it but it was so good. Btw, I couldn't find any reviews on what sauce to use. I used preggo Italian sausage and garlic bottles. I seasoned my sausages a bit but adding the sliced sausages is something I did on my own. Other people talked about Italian sausage but it sounded like the ground up stuff.

I'm a pretty picky eater, I like things to taste exactly how they tasted when I was living with my parents. My boyfriend isn't picky but doesn't ever express how much he likes or dislikes something. We made this super easy recipe and I was hooked from the first bite, so much that I immediately went and filled up my bowl even more. We used 2 different sauces: Newman's Own tomato and basil sauce and we also used the roasted garlic sauce. My boyfriend said it was really good and he went back for seconds! Definitely a keeper :)

Pretty good! I swapped ricotta in place of the sour cream, and mixed the sauce with the pasta as the first layer (rather than putting pasta on the bottom, then cheese, then sauce). I covered it with foil for 25 minutes, then baked uncovered for 10.

Overall a good recipe, but I found that adding a few things to the sauce really brought out the flavour. I added some fresh basil and oregano to the sauce, and added an extra ounce of mozzarella cheese. Following the advice of other reviewers, I changed up the layering of the dish. I mixed the ziti with the sauce and spread it first, layered the provolone, sour cream, ziti with sauce again, then mozzarella to top.

I love how the sour cream melts into the provolone and creates an almost ricotta texture. It tastes like cheat lasagna. A word of caution though, if you don't love, and I mean Love, the taste of parmesan don't add it to the top of this dish as it bakes. I don't know if it's the smell or whatever but it almost became overwhelming.

This was really tasty, but I REALLY should learn to trust my gut when I think something is going to need a larger pan. I was already past the point of no return when I realized that there was no way I was getting this all in a 9x13!

I have made a lot of baked ziti in the past, using ricotta and egg, but thought I’d give this a try, since the ratings were so good. I doubled the recipe and made a pan to bring to a friend recovering from surgery and her family. The other half stayed with my family. I used a pound of lean ground beef and a pound of sweet Italian sausage, rather than doubling the beef. I also added 2 cloves of crushed fresh garlic and some Italian seasoning. I baked it covered in foil, as suggested by other cooks. It stayed nice and moist. I was intrigued by the sour cream, but also a little unsure of how it would taste. It was a hit! My picky family loved it and my friend said she and her family loved it too!

I made it just as the recipe read.  Next time I make it I'm adding more sauce.  It was very cheesy and I felt there wasn't enough of it to balance it out.  Very good otherwise.

Just made this a couple days ago for a party and already getting asked for the recipe by guests. I made this without any meat since we had some vegetarians attending. Which actually made it so much easier. I cooked the pasta, put it in the dish and just opened the jar of pasta sauce and poured it right on the pasta, then I did the cheese/ sour cream layer, pasta with sauce again and mozzarella and Parm on top. Was so simple and delicious. Definitely recommend keeping the sour cream and not switching this recipe. Thanks for sharing - it was enjoyed by many!

I was skeptical, but this turned out pretty good. I prefer to use canned tomatoes with garlic and a few seasonings over the jarred sauce. An alternative to sour cream is cottage cheese.

I made this for dinner tonight. I halved it for the two of us. It was really good. I baked it covered for 30 minutes and took the foil off and baked it for another 10 minutes to brown up the cheese. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made no changes and will make again.   I have had Bake Ziti and didn't even care for it because it was always so dry.  This Ziti is excellent.  You will never look for another recipe again after making this.

I have made this several times and it is delicious. The only thing I would add is that the pan should be covered when you bake it because it will dry out there unless it is covered.  I made this one’s for 100 people for a community lunch at our church and everybody loved it.

This is great!  I almost subbed in ricotta, but I read a lot of the reviews... and decided to give the sour cream a chance.  Glad I did!  It was saucy and not  dry at all.  
hints for new cooks, mix sauce in the bottom of the pan  or in with the lower level of pasta... and always cover to bake!
5 stars!!!

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a “10” in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get “seconds.”  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

This recipe was fabulous, and it was super easy!  I didn't have ziti noodles so I used some rotini that I had on hand. I also added three large Anaheim peppers to the onions because I had them on hand and needed to use them up. They were a really nice touch! I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and since I only had one large 32 oz. jar of marinara, I added a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes.  Then I added some Italian seasoning, garlic, and some red pepper flakes.  I also didn't have provolone so I used the shredded mozzarella I had on hand. This is a fail-proof recipe, because you can play around with it and it'll be awesome. DO use the sour cream -- it really makes it special! Super glad that I found this and I'll definitely make it often.

I made the recipe as written and it was fantastic.  I was going to use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream, but was glad I didn't.  I found the sour cream had more flavor.

Was looking for a recipe to use up ground beef that was close to expiration.  This was a very tasty and filling dish . I made it as directed , however I added another 2 tablespoons of butter and flour as I couldn't get the mixture to thicken . I also cooked the dish uncovered,  I like a browned , crispy top , and it didn't dry out the dish at all .

This was my first pasta dish other than spaghetti and it was pretty easy and tasted delish. My whole family of 15 loved it. Some even took left overs. Its simple to follow and easy. Put all the sauce it asks  for . I thought it was to much and left out some .as I was layering it I realized, yes it could have used the sauce i left out, but thankfully this was for the second pan I used. Overall a keeper and would make it again.

This tasted great! Even my daughter loved it, and she's a picky eater! The only change I made was in Layering,  Once the beef and onions were cooked  I mixed all together in casserole dish minus the Provolone saving for last and more Mozzarella and Parmesan to the top and covering with foil for specified time. Loved it! Will definitely make this again, Thanks for posting!

It was pretty good when I made it the first time. I did substitute the sour creams for ricotta as well, because it just sounded like it was too much.

After reading reviews the only change I did was to add alittle bit of ricotta along with the SC.  I also covered it for 30 mins and uncovered 10.  It came out unbelievable!! So creamy and not dried out at all.

I make this all the time....sometimes I use different cheeses...whatever I have on hand.  Makes a TON but that's great because my husband likes leftovers and my son can take several days worth of meals home with him.  This is a great recipe.

This dish was a great hit!! Even the picky eater had seconds. I only did a few modifications for my liking as follows: double meat - one pound ground beef, one lb ground mild Italian sausage. I added Italian seasoning to the jar sauce and let it slow simmer while I prepared everything else. Instead of having all the cheesy layers, I took the sour cream / ricotta and put 3/4 cup of each and stirred into the sauce. I tossed together the noodles, meat & onion, & sauce in a large mixing bowl with shredded Parmesan and Mozzarella (I don’t measure my cheese. FYI. ??.) I spooned the mix in 3 layers with the sliced provolone between each layer in a large stoneware baking bowl. Covered and baked until warm in center. Removed foil, added cheese on top and broiled to add a nice cheese crust. Mouth watering good.

Forgot to take a pic. I was really nervous about using sour cream. I was having people over and didn’t want it to be a bust. I trusted everyone’s reviews and it was a hit! Delicious!! I didn’t butter the pan, just put a little sauce on bottom. I also followed everyone’s recommendations and put sauce on top of ziti then sour cream and cheese. It was very cheesy and the flavor was great! This is my new recipe.

Made it exactly as it’s written and came out amazingly. Also, sometimes I make it vegetarian because my sister doesn’t eat meat so I just throw in an extra half pound of pasta. Everyone whose had it has loved it

There was way too much cheese in this. There was barely any sauce and the cheese made it pretty much impossible to even find the noodles. The sour cream was extremely prominent. I would do like 1/4th of the cheese it says to do.

I have been all recipes for years and I find it exhausting to scroll through reviews.  I come from an Italian family so was skeptical of this but it works as is !  I have 2 small girls that are sick of spaghetti and meatballs and this is a hack but it’s delicious.   Thank you

I made this per the recipe with only two changes to the cheese, as suggested by a fellow reviewer.  Fresh mozzarella balls and slices of creamy Havarti (instead of Provolone).  The turkey was excellent and I could not believe how wonderful the sour cream tasted when baked - perfect substitution for ricotta!

1st, I hate when people rate and then rewrite the recipe, in saying that... I thought I had enough provolone cheese but only had one slice left that i cut up and then also used a shredded italian cheese blend that had provolone in it. I halved the recipe as there were only 4 of us and there was still plenty. I also had to use penne rigate for the pasta because it's what I had on hand. I must say I was skeptical of sour cream, it was really good though! For those that want ricotta, make lasagna...I will be making this again! Thanks for quick and easy week night meal.

Best Baked Ziti!  Such flavor.  I made exactly as is and my family loved it.  I will use this recipe as my go-to for baked ziti or a meal to bring to a pot-luck or to cook when friends come over.  The provolone really adds a nice touch, and I like how creamy the sour cream makes the sauce.  Don't change it - make as it.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

This is a new staple in my meal rotation. I’ve made it three times already (once a month for the past three months) and my family of three LOVES it.  It also makes TONS of leftovers which is great because of my work schedule. After I make it, I know there is something in the fridge my hubby can warm up for him and my daughter if I’m working late.

 The only changes I made was I used two 24 oz jars of sauce because I couldn’t find any 26 oz jars in my grocery store. I also didn’t use Ziti, I prefer using Rotini instead because it picks up more of the sauce and cheese. And I’ve tried different sauces each time to make it a little different. I think our favorite is Ragú Chunky 7 Herb Tomato.

I was really happy with how this turned out. I followed some of the tips from the top reviews: add some of the sauce before the first layer of cheese, mix the sauce into the noodles some on both layers, and cover with foil while baking. I substituted Edam cheese for provolone, which I wasn't able to find in my UK supermarket. I also used slightly less sour cream: 300 ml instead of a 1.5 cups, which would have been 360 ml. That was just because of the size of the sour cream containers here, but it worked fine. The pan was completely full as it was.

Great recipe! Was unsure about the sour cream that the recipe called for, but it added a great flavor and worked well. Followed the recipe and it did make a large 9x13 pan, which fed my family of 4 with plenty of leftovers. The leftovers didn’t last a day, as the dish was great the second time around, as well. The recipe was super easy, and clean up was a breeze. Will definitely make again!

This was a super easy dish to make and was great! My family loved it. 
I followed others suggestions and put the sauce on top of the pasta, and also covered in tinfoil in the oven. 
I made half the recipe and added a little extra pasta; I would say it could've fed 5-7 easily!
Will definitely make again

Perfect recipe to feed a hungry group.  I left out the meat  and onions because we had several vegetarians.  I was afraid it would be boring, but it was great.   I did mix the noodles with one jar of sauce and then I used the second jar for layering as directed.  The sour cream and provolone layer really tastes and looks like an extra yummy ricotta cheese layer.  This is a simple casserole but with a salad and french bread it is attractive, filling, and satisfying to a wide range of people.

I've made this recipe several times and it is delicious.  When I brown my ground beef and onions, I also add salt and pepper, garlic, italian seasoning, some chopped green pepper,  and crushed red pepper flakes.  Ricotta cheese can also be used in lieu of the sour cream.  I serve it with a tomato, cucumber and onion salad, which is light and refreshing.  So yummy!

This recipe is the best!  I make lasagna and baked spaghetti all the time, but this is my new go to recipe going forward!  

I followed the directions exactly as written, except I tossed the pasta with the sauce before I layered it based on some of the other reviews. It turned out amazing!  I can't wait to make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The flavor was great and it was easy to make.  I used a roasted garlic jarred tomato sauce and I used ground turkey which I seasoned and cooked before letting it simmer in the sauce mix.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was amazing. It was super simple, and absolutely delicious! This will definitely become a staple on our dinner table! I didn't use very much onion, and used penne noodles (because we were out of ziti). I also substituted ricotta in for the sour cream.  I would highly recommend this recipe, and will probably use this for our many church and sport team pot lucks in the future!

Will make again but with changes.  I didn't like the fact the sour cream separated so I will use ricotta next time.  Did not use provolone but sliced fresh mozzarella cheese on top.  Sprayed foil with non-stick spray, covered and baked.  I really like the how fast this all came together.

Loved it.  I did not have ziti pasta so used penne.  I used 3/4 of a pound instead of the pound it called for as it is a more dense pasta.  I made the right call.  Presented well, tasted awesome, fed lots of people and was great as a left over.

Used shredded sharp cheddar instead of provolone, only used half an onion, used mild sausage instead of ground beef, and mixed the sauce and ziti together, turned out great with most people grabbing seconds.

The ziti was excellent. We substitute the ground beef for 1lb hot sausage and added a few teaspoons of red pepper flakes to taste. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe.  I made it with Italian Sausage rather than beef, but did use the sour cream rather than opting for Ricotta.  It came out fabulous.  It also refrigerates really well.  I made the casserole on a Sunday, but didn't bake it until a week later.  It came out fabulous.  I'm sure it would freeze well too.

Really yummy! I made it as is. The sour cream gives it a creaminess that was delicious. It made a lot so it would be great to bring to a gathering or feed a large family. I’ll be enjoying the leftovers!

I used hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef and I think it gave it soo much more flavor. This is a hard one to screw up and tastes very delicious. It makes great leftovers.

Definitely swapped out real Ricotta cheese for sour cream and I think the container I bought was 2 cups, so I used it all. Also added the freshly grated parmesan cheese, basil and oregano to the Ricotta before folding it into the noodles. I also choose 1 lb. of hot Roma Italian sausage over the ground beef. As far as the Mozzarella, I used one 2 cup package of shredded mozz in leiu of provolone and the sliced mozz mentioned. They were no leftovers from the Varsity Football team dinner from my pan, other parents had some of their own pasta dishes to take home! Next time, I'm making it for the family.

Accidentally submitted other incomplete review too early! Turned out GREAT with minor adjustments....I used one pound of mild sausage in addition to one pound ground beef. I also minced four cloves of garlic and added copious amounts of pepper and Italian seasoning to the meat/sauce mixture as it was simmering. I covered my dish in foil and baked for 40 min. Turned out perfect, and as most dishes like this, was even better the next day. Will definitely make again.

This came out really good and creamy. However, instead of layering the ingredients separately, I combined the noodles with most of the sauce, sour cream and meat together. Then I poured half the noodle mixture in the pan, topped that with the shredded mozzarella and provolone cheeses, then poured the second half of the noodle mixture, topped it with the provolone, the rest of the sauce, then covered it and baked it for about half an hour. After that, I uncovered the dish, topped it with the rest of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses and then baked again for another 10 minutes until the cheese melted. My family loved it.

We make this pretty often.  It's HUGE and makes for wonderful leftovers.  We add mushrooms, Italian Seasoning and LOTS of  garlic.  (Just FYI, I have a slight allergy to sage and most the Italian Seasoning we've seen at the store have sage in it.  We found some fabulous Italian Seasoning without Sage at a site called Ralph's Seasonings.)

This was so delicious and gooey with cheese. The layer of sour cream was surprisingly my favorite part because it added a different flavor than I’m used to in pasta dishes (I will probably be adding more of it next time!)

This recipe is amazing - you can please everyone with this one. Something about the provolone, sour cream, etc. that makes it special. I just substituted the beef for sweet Italian sausage to make it a bit different from the loads of other beef/pasta/red sauce dishes I make for the family, and it really was a huge hit.

Best baked Ziti recipe on the site.  Vegetarian (omit ground beef) version has excellent flavor. For those of us who like meat, this is perfect over chicken strips or patties.  With a split family of veggie/meatatarians, this recipe pleases everyone without having to prepare two meals.  Thank you for sharing.

It tasted delicious. My husband, teenager and 7 year old really liked it. It was way to make. I had no provolone cheese so just substituted with grated marble cheese for entire recipe (had on hand). I still used parmesean on top.  I cooked it on convection mode.

Whenever I use a recipe for the first time I try my best to follow it and I did! I was worried about the provolone because I have never seen that in a ziti recipe but it was a hit! Definitely will make it again, thanks!

Love this recipe. Made it many times. The only thing I did differently was add more sour cream and mix all the pasta with it. Huge hit in my family.

I thought it was a good recipe to start with. The only additions I made was adding garlic. I also layered differently, like other reviewers had mentioned. Definitely was NOT dry. I baked with foil over it and took the foil off about 5 mins before time was up to brown the cheese a bit. Next time I'm going to make it with ricotta cheese in place of sour cream and add a little more spices and herbs to taste. My entire family (kids included) really liked this recipe.

This was awesome! I passed recipe so many times because of the ingredients, sour cream, provolone cheese what?? No 15 steps, no ricotta ... But gave it a try and glad I did, was surprised how yummy it was..I did half it, in fear of it not turning out. My family loved it, my 7yr old daughter who's a picky one ate 3 plates full.. hi-five..I did cheat , I already had sauce made up, frozed (from this sight.. Kays Spaghetti and Lasagna sauce, and took a reviewers suggestion and slow cooked it) and took it out to use for this. this is my go to from now on.. no more dry over baked pasta.... 
thank you Colleen for making me look like a top chef for my family.

Absolutely wonderful!! Haven't met one person who doesn't love this dish. The provolone cheese with sour cream OMGeee good, do NOT use ricotta!  Those who say it too dry etc, well come on learn how to add sauce or cover (eye roll).

Ok I totally agree with Bayou Gator on this one. This recipe is amazing. If your gonna completely change it, than submit your own baked ziti recipe and leave this one be. I made this recipe this weekend and it was a huge hit! My Mother-in law who is a huge food critic informed me it was by far the best ziti she has ever had! I did simmer the sauce with my own fresh herbs from our garden, and added a few tablespoons of ricotta to the sour cream, only because I like that consistency... it was delicious. Fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing this Colleen!
PS. I did not have to cover this... no need, and I made mine in a dutch oven (without the lid)

I've made this recipe several times; and it never fails.  Some of the other reviewers created an entirely different recipe (i.e. Use Ricotta instead of sour cream, add egg, oregano, etc) which in essence created an entirely DIFFERENT recipe.  However, this dish is great as written and I do cover when baking.

Turned out fantastic. Almost like a lazy version of lasagne!    Next time I'll add some spinach for a little twist. Also, I'm a cheese-aholic so I'll go more cheesy. As is it's pretty cheesy but go big or go home, right?

I made it, and it was a hit. I would definitely cover it to bake, though. Also it's a huge dish. I used a 13x9 and had enough for another 8x8. The layering seemed odd, but I made it as directed, and it mixed well serving, and tasted fine. May try ricotta cheese instead of sour cream just to sample the difference based on other reviews, but I have no complaints. When all 5 kids like it, and I don't feel like I'm eating "kid food", it's a winner!

This turned out great for me! My boyfriend and I are 19 and he's a very picky eater.. He DID enjoy this very much though! He ate this for 3 days straight! Only thing I would suggest is to not use the whole onion, it was too much. 3/4 of the onion or even 1/2 will be fine! The picture is a before and after it went in the oven!

I made this for my family last night and we liked this quite well. I, too, was skeptical about using provolone and sour cream in it, but the combination of those with mozzarella and parmesan on top did result in a pleasant, cheesy taste. I made it per the recipe, but used my own sauce (no recipe for that--a few cans of tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, some of this and that...) and had to use gluten-free penne. The GF penne, as expected, somewhat disintegrated, so next time I think I'll only partially cook it and hopefully it will complete cooking in the oven. Leftovers, although rather formless due to the GF pasta, tasted even better today for lunch! I will make this for a dinner for our Bible study coming up--I'm glad I tested it on my family first, so I will be able to serve it to other people confidently!

It's ok to me. The only thing is you really need to salt the pasta when boiling or else it tastes really bland.

I made this today. The only thing I changed was instead of provolone I used american cheese because that's what I have and it turned out great?? make sure that you put extra sauce so it doesn't get dry. I baked it uncovered and had no complaints about it! I will keep this recipe!

The store was out of ziti, so I subbed Rigatoni. I also added 1/2 a pound of Italian sausage for additional flavor. I subbed ricotta & used a shredded cheese blend of Mozzarella, provolone & Parmesan.

i made this in a pinch without the provolone,  and it was still very good. I can't wait to try it with the provolone included.  Like many others, I made slight changes. I added a few spices, and I mixed the pasta and the sauce before layering.  I also mixed Italian sausage and garlic into the sauce. It  didn't seem like 350 was getting  the job done, so I bumped the temp up to 400 for the last 10 minutes.  Other than that, I baked uncovered for the last 5 minutes or so to crisp up the top a bit. I like the browned cheese and the firm/crunchy bits. I halved the recipe, and it was still a lot of food.

Didn't have provolone so I doubled the mozzarella and used that instead. So delicious. I could eat my weight in this stuff.

This was an delicious and easy recipe! I substituted ground turkey for beef and browned it in olive oil with onion, garlic, mushrooms and Italian seasoning. I followed previous suggestions and covered the ziti with foil for the first 20 mins and removed it for the last 10 mins to brown the cheese. Mmmmmm! This is definitely a crowd pleaser!

This is the worst baked ziti I've ever made. It was too wet and not cheesy enough. From now on I'll stick to the recipe I use that includes ricotta cheese and less sauce.

Took the advice of putting noodles and then sauce. Then cover with foil. Half the recipe was plenty for the 3 of us. We are keeping this in the recipe book for sure. Creamy, cheesy, and just delicious!!

My entire family loved this and it will go into a regular rotation in our house. I have made Baked Ziti in the past but never used sour cream in the recipe. I'm not sure is that's what made it so good but dang this was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but  I did use 1/2 pound of hot Italian sausage in place of 1/2 pound of the hamburger. So good! Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't put beef because I keep kosher and we don't mix cheese and meat, and also nixed the sour cream and used cheeses I enjoy most so I expected this to be a great version of many (meatless) baked zitis I've had...but it was kind of flavorless. I added granulated garlic and dried oregano at the end after it was cooked and that made it taste a whole lot better, but I wish I'd cooked them in! Also I don't know why she has the cheese before the sauce...my bottom layer was just plain pasta. Hope this helps!

My family of seven (including myself) love this recipe. They ask for it on a weekly basis.  The first time I made it I went by the recipe step by step but  since then I made a slight change. The only change I made was combining the sauce and noodles and then follow the rest of the recipe it was less dry and all the noodles were covered. Family asked me to make it that way every time. Also, something that has made my life a little easier was using crock pot liners to line the casserole dish. Made clean up a breeze. Otherwise, great recipe:-)

This was good! Very simple to make. I was sceptical due to the use of sour cream, but it worked well. I did use my own homemade sauce instead of jarred, and I layered it and covered it as suggested in other reviews. I also halved the recipe. We'll probably have this again.

The only change I made is that I used a vodka cream sauce instead of a traditional spaghetti sauce. But we loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I made it exactly as written and I thought it was "pretty good" but nothing outstanding.  I used "Farmer's Market fresh tomato and basil" spaghetti sauce.  Everybody enjoyed it, but there were no rave reviews.  The sour cream and provolone were great.

It turned out AWESOME!!  I modified as some others posted; I substituted ricotta, mixed in an egg and about 1T of dried oregano flakes, then I added the mixture to the pasta.  I left the provolone in, and used roasted garlic spaghetti sauce to liven it up!  I made this dish for a Nurse's Week pot-luck at work tomorrow and tasting it was a tease!!  I can't wait for lunchtime tomorrow!!

I liked this recipe but I did make a few changes. I didn't use provolone because I didn't have any, so it was all mozzarella. I layered it differently: mix half the sauce with half the ziti, combine the cheese with sour cream and spread over bottom layer, mix a little of the remaining sauce with the rest of the ziti (just enough to coat the pasta), pour the last of the sauce over dish and cover with cheese. Also, make sure to cover the dish with foil. Next time, I'll try replacing the sour cream with ricotta cheese, as some reviewers suggested. The sour cream was a little overpowering.

This was a great recipe, the bf had 3 helpings! I made some changes based on the highest rated review, I mixed two eggs with ricotta cheese (added handful Italian cheese blend of Parmesan asiago etc) then added the al dente ziti. I used 1 lb mild Italian sausage with onion and half bulb of garlic, adding generous pepper, chili pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, dried basil, oregano, and a large spoon of white sugar. As for layers I went two times over with: sauce, ziti/ricotta mix, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan asiago mix cheese, sprinkle of basil and oregano.

I enjoyed this dish a lot.  The only change I made was to pour the sauce over the first layer of ziti before adding the cheese.  This allowed the sauce to flow throughout the ziti.  I'll make this again!

This is phenomenal. My kids loved it, I loved it, my husband loved it, as is! And this baked ziti is so easy to make and so easy to modify based on individual and family tastes, add pork exclude all meat, add oregeno and garlic, etc.  Also, very easy to make or divide and freeze for second, busy night dinner. One of the few five stars i've given.

My wife has made this several times, and replaces the sour cream for ricotta cheese. It offers a little more creaminess.

Used a mix of sour cream and ricotta, depends on if you want it to taste more like lasagna or not. So good! May try putting sauce and pasta blend on bottom next time. Didn't use provolone either as I didn't have any - still delish

I made exactly as written besides using fresh basil, only 1 cup of sour cream and 1.25 cups of mozzarella. This is a very saucy baked ziti that's  easy to make and quite tasty. Thank you for sharing.

I would recommend covering the dish. I'm not an experienced cook, but I do think that makes a big difference. I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit! I don't ever cook except for my kids. But this was so loved it gave me confidence to continue trying more new things. I love this dish!!

This was a really good recipe. I only changed the ground beef to zesty Italian sausage and my family loved it. I served this main dish with a nice salad and garlic bread with cheese. It was a big hit and everyone cleaned their plates! I've made other recipes using ricotta cheese mixed with an egg but this was really good with the sour cream. I'll make this one again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I included a bit more meat than the recipe called for, but I'm sure it would have still tasted delicious with the amount listed.  It was absolutely delicious.  I forwarded the recipe to my 2 sisters and they both raved about it as well.  All of our families are hooked!!!

Yummmm!!!!! This is on our regular menu rotation. The kids always cheer when they see me making this. I've always made it without meat for Meatless Monday. They've never missed having ground beef in it. I've used jarred sauce and homemade sauce, gluten free penne, macaroni, or spaghetti noodles and it tastes great every time. One of our favorites!

I made it for an event involving  110 People.  It came out perfect.  Had to make sauce in large Stock Pot.  I made them in half size trays that fit into chafing dish.  In each tray, I used 2 cups of Mozzarella and 2 cups of Parmesan Cheese.  One cup of each on top and one cup in middle layer with dabs of sour cream.  Seriously, this was the BOMB.  It was awesome, of course with my own homemade sauce.

This ended up being a pleasant surprise even though I was missing one crucial ingredient:  ZITI! I used Penne because it was all I had  (I swore that I had ziti shells).  I question whether the sauce amount is a typo as all of the sauces were 24 Oz. not 26. I used 1 jar of garlic and olive oil,  1 jar of sausage flavored, and only deviated from the recipe by adding 1 clove of minced garlic and a 4 cheese shredded Italian mixture instead of just mozzarella. I  did read the reviews and my thoughts on using Ricotta instead of sour cream  are that you might as well just make a pan of lasagna if you use the Ricotta. The sour cream added an extra depth to this superb recipe. And yes,  you need to cover it with aluminum foil while baking.  I covered mine for 20 minutes and then uncovered for 10 to brown the top. I got rave reviews and have already been asked to make it again very soon!

Such a great recipe!! I had to make changes because I didn't have exactly what it called for.. I only used one cup of sour cream, and I used a whole bag of shredded mozzarella cheese and a whole bag of (mixed) mozzarella/provolone cheese.. and I put extra grated Parmesan cheese on top..

I thought it turned out really good. For my first try! Feedback from my son and wife are to replace the sour cream with ricotta cheese, use less sauce and more meat. I want to use a different sauce that I choice (which was a generic brand - traditional) and  to cut the onions up much more finely next time! Thanks!

It was pretty good but a bit dry and bland for me.  If I make it again I will add tomatoes or more sauce and seasoning.

I made this last night and it was a hit.  I did make a few modifications.  I increased the amount because I was expecting a crowd.  I substituted sour cream with ricotta and doubled the mozzarella.   A very good recipe.

I roughly made a double batch of this. I say roughly because I didn't follow the ingredient amounts too closely, but I still followed the recipe. I found it was good, but took a bit longer to prep and cook than the recipe says. The pasta sauce that you buy is also very important, so don't skimp out on it. I added about 7 cloves of garlic and also some extra onion and Italian seasoning to give some extra 'oomph'. I also switched up the layers and put a mixture of noodles and sauce on the bottom which I would do again. I also cooked the pan covered in tinfoil.

Wow, this turned out great.  Due to whey allergies I had to leave out the mozzarella, but there was lots of flavor that I didn't notice it missing.

Everyone in the family enjoyed this.  I used a slightly bigger casserole dish, so I doubled meat.  Used 2lbs of ground turkey, added 3 cloves of minced garlic.  Seasoned turkey well with salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings due to turkey not being as flavorful as beef. When meat/sauce was done simmering, I tossed slightly undercooked ziti into pan and coated noodles well with sauce mixture, then I layered as directions stated. Used 9 thin slices of provolone (due to bigger casserole dish).  Cooked closer to 45-50 min.  About 45 min covered, 5 min uncovered.

My family loved this and has requested that I make it a regular. I used barillas spicy marinara and Italian sausage instead of beef.  I wasn't trying to change things up with the Italian sausage but that's all I had.  I will continue to use that instead of beef though

Made as recipe called for.  It was delicious and wouldn't change a thing.  You can freeze it and  eat it later also, which makes it nice.

Deeeeeelicious!!! I tweaked it a little bit... I added a lot more mozzarella and then broiled it at the end to brown the cheese a lil bit and wow it was delicious!!! It's heavy (you could anchor a battleship) but use a small plate!!!!

This was delicious! Everyone raved.  Used 1.5 pounds gluten free penne noodles. I made it the night before and then baked it the next day.  It took a lot longer to bake than the recipe stated.  It baked for 1 hour at 350 and then I turned it up to 375 for about another 1/2 hour (all while covered with foil).  Will make again!

This dish is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I love it and there's always enough left overs for a few nights and when you reheat it, it's still just as good! The things I do differently are: 
1) I add a clove of minced garlic when I brown the onions.
2) I mix my pasta and sauce together.
3) cover with tin foil so the pasta doesn't dry
4) once the cheese is melted, I take the foil off and broil till cheese is golden brown!

So glad I found this recipe!(:

This was a big hit for a Euchre party. Everyone thought it was lasagne. I was doing a Valentine's Day theme so I double the recipes & used Heart-shaped pasta. Instead of beef, I used ground turkey & mild Italian sausage & added a little fresh chopped basil as part of the layers. I forgot the Parmesan, but don't really think it mattered. The sour cream & provolone made it look like it had roccota It was a good idea to cover with foil & uncover later. It made a lot (probably could have served 16), but we were happy to have the leftovers. Only sorry that I didn't take a picture. Served with Greek zoodle salad & garlic bread. YUM!

This recipe was excellent as originally posted.  I added a little garlic salt and a little cajun spice to give it a little kick, but that was just my personal preference since my wife and child doesn't like spice.  This will definitely be a repeat!

This was positively disgusting. Who ever heard of putting sour cream in Italian pasta? Baked ziti has ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and grated parmesan or Romano cheese not sour cream and provolone cheese.

Made exactly as the recipe shown except we don't eat meat so threw in 2 handfuls of fresh spinach into sauce. And had no ziti on shelf so I used  Mezze Penne. My husband and I had to force ourselves from over eating, it was that good.  Will do it exactly the same and invite family next time.

As with every recipe, I have to alter to accommodate my vegetarian husband.  I cut the recipe in one-half, as there are only the 2 of us.  I used one can of Loma Linda vegetarian ground beef, and took another reviewer's recommendation of ricotta--good suggestion.  It came out really good.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to avoid dryness, due to the lack of fat that I would have gotten from the hamburger.

I made this EXACTLY to the recipe and it's delicious. I'm not a big fan of ricotta, and I love how provelone melts, so I really like the sour cream/provelone mixture. This is a big hit in my house and it's so easy that it's my go-to for making comfort food for someone who is sick, moving, death of a loved one, etc. This recipe is great!!!

Loved this and it's super quick and way if you don't make your own sauce.

I made modifications which resulted in a 4 star rating. To make it vegetarian friendly I omitted the meat. Tossed the pasta in a little sauce before layering. As a rookie cook I would have never thought to cover it before baking, thank goodness I read others reviews. Also, I had to bake it for 40-50 min with the last 10min baking it uncovered.

This turned out beautifully. My husband doesn't  usually like penne noodles but he raved over this dish.  I didn't  have provolone cheese so I used slices of Havarti cheese and added 2 cans of sliced mushrooms, it still tasted wonderful. There are only two of us soI will cut it in half next time.  This would be a great company dish.

My entire family loves this recipe even my sour cream hating husband.    I use whole wheat penne for my pasta because I always have it on hand.  I've made this recipe for all sorts of occasions and for many friends and I always get rave reviews.  It is a good to recipe in my house.

I made this tonight for 7 people and it was a smash hit!! No leftovers! I'm having dinner for twelve on Friday so now that my practice run is complete I'll serve this at my Italian Night Party. The only change I'll make is to double the recipe and make more sauce so it's a little more "saucy" for my husband. Served with minestrone soup and a yummy salad. Deserves its 5 star rating!!

Per a suggestion in a post I read, I tossed the noodles in the sour cream instead of trying to spread it on top of the layers. It just seems a lot easier that way. Everyone loved it. Even my way too critical husband!

My daughter made this for dinner and it was amazing! My husband and I fell in love with it.  I am making it for my next garden club meeting.  Although it has a lot of cheese in it , I wasn't  overwhelmed by the cheese, as I am with some pasta recipes. I totally give it a 5 star rating.

Don't be afraid to add tomatoes, mushrooms, red bell peppers, seasonings and even black olives to create your own version. Sometimes I even use penne as ziti is sometimes hard to find in my store. Great recipe base for sure.

I substituted the spaghetti meat sauce with the sauce from John Chandler's World's Best Lasagna. After I drained the ziti, I put them back into the pot, added the sauce and a handful of Italian blend shredded cheese and stirred until combined. I put a bit of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and then added half the pasta mixture. Topped that with the sliced provolone. Thin layer of sour cream. Then the rest of the pasta mixture. Topped the dish with a good amount of the shredded cheese and Parmesan cheese. Baked covered 350F for 30 minutes. Removed the foil and broiled for a couple of minutes.  Delicious!

Oooo, this makes oodles.  The only reason I am only giving 4 Stars is that it doesn't mention to cover to bake. This would be easy to make and make your own frozen dinners. I can't see any reason this can't be microwaved to reheat at the office the next day.

This was really delicious. The only changes or additions I made were to add some extra seasonings to the ground chuck (fennel, basil, more garlic, etc.) and I used Prego Spicy Sausage pasta sauce which gave it just a little kick. I also changed the layering order so the sauce came before the cheese. My top layer was the mozzarella and some other cheeses I had on hand (we like a lot of cheese!). My family and I truly enjoyed; thanks for the great recipe. Will definitely make again!

This was very tasty. I did use ricotta instead of sour cream. It gets points for ease, but canned sauce is no match for homemade.

This was easy & delish!  I never had sour cream in my baked ziti before.  The flavors balanced well & it tasted great right out of the oven.  I may try some adjustments next time, but I don't usually fix things that work fine.

I made this as a side dish for our family Christmas, and it was delicious.  Loved the sour cream in place of ricotta.  Our main dish was beef tenderloin, so I made a version of this with roasted vegetables.  I cut zucchini, summer squash, onions, mushrooms and eggplant into bite-sized pieces and coated them in about 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.  Added salt and pepper and roasted in a hot oven at 425 degrees until their were some charred bits.  I layered the vegetables in place of the ground beef.  Seriously delicious.

I love this recipe! It is great as it is. No changes necessary. I found it 2 months ago and I have already made it 3 times. It reminds me of lasagna but so much cheaper, faster and easier to make! I do like to make it with Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage but its great with hamburger too. My family loves it and it is now a permanent dinner favorite.
Last time I made it I tried it with ricotta instead of the sour cream and I didn't like it as well. Stick to recipe and you will be happy!

I made it as the recipe states. It came out a little iffy because of the spur cream so next time I'm going to make it without that and more meat and cheese! Overall it tastes very good! My 8 month old and husband loved it as well which is awesome!

This is great. Easy. I used penne because I couldn't find ziti. Used variety of spaghetti sauces including a 5 cheese blend. Used 2.5 jars I think. Used Italian sausage (mild) and added a little garlic to the onion and sausage while cooking. mixed the sauce mixture with the pasta first each time, then layered the rest. Made ahead of time so I could just pop it in the oven to cook later. Made sure to cover it. Good basic simple recipe that makes a lot. Thanks!

I used 1/2 pound of ground beef and 1/2 pound of sweet Italian sausage.  It was delicious and enjoyed by both my husband and myself!

I substitutes Ricotta for the sour cream, seasoning the ricotta with parsley, basil, thyme, garlic powder, chopped onion, salt pepper and a little sugar.

An easy go-to meal in our house. I've made it with and without meat to take to pot lucks. My hubby loves this meal.

Loved it! Was unsure about using sour cream but this was a HUGE hit!!! I loved it, as did four 10 year old girls and a 13 year old boy. I covered it with foil for 30 min and let it cook an extra 5 without foil. I did not change anything. Absolutely delish!!!!

I did not put in the beef or use the butter.  I added mushrooms.  It was good but nothing special.  I believe I would prefer ricotta.

This turns so awesome..many in reviews to recomended ricotta cheese to source cream.  I will do this next time. By the way I didn't add beef. Instead substitute wirh mushroom zucchini jalapeño and Italian herbs.and added black pepper oregano salt and parsley . I mixed ziti with sauce and then add sour cream. Provolone cheese aND more ralla cheese .. repeat and cover with parmesan cheese.. and put the lid on. Bake in oven at 350 for 45 min..and broil at the end without lid until get desired brown dots on ch3ese...awesome

Will Not Use no-salt organic marinara sauce again and will add chopped garlic to the meat sauce.  Then it will be perfect!!
I did mix the ziti with the sauce as some recommended so not at all dry.  Prepared  a day ahead and refrigerated.  Then baked it the next day.  Excellent and easy!!

This was a great recipe.  I did need to make a vegetarian option so I sauteed 2 packages of sliced baby bella mushrooms with the onion and added garlic.  As per other reviewers, I altered the order of the layering by placing the red sauce over the first round of noodles.  I cooked this in a covered casserole dish and it came out moist and great.  It made a lot and it was also good the next day.  Thank you for the submission.

This is my go-to recipe for ziti!  My family absolutely loves it, even my four year old.   Instead of provolone, I just use shredded mozzarella for the whole dish.  I have varied this recipe using Italian sausage and diced green peppers and I've tried it with ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.  Every time I've made it, it has been a hit.

Excellent!   I usually make a recipe exactly as written first time, but this one is highly adaptable.  I used a lot more than called for shredded mozzarella mixing about a cup in with the sauce and pasta before layering.  My family loves cheese!  I used my "family approved" semi- homemade meat sauce recipe, but in the quantities listed.  I did not cover, had no problem with dry out and the pasta was perfect.  I loved the provolone and sour cream combination!  This recipe is a keeper for me.  Thanks!!!

Wow! This was so good. I did an extra layer of provolone and added more mozzarella because I like my ziti cheesy.  I also mixed the sauce and ziti together as others have suggested. Another thing that added a little somethin' was using  an "Italian Sausage" tomato sauce that has bell peppers and a few extra spices in it. I traded the beef for sausage as well. This was the best pasta dish I have ever made!

Made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe to a T.  Everybody loved it.  
The second time I made it  I  used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce and 1 jar of Alfredo sauce because that was what I had on hand. I left out the sour cream as the Alfredo would add that creamy taste. Instead of topping with Parmesan I topped with Italian bread crumbs.  It was also very good.
Because it makes so much for a small family I baked half of it   and froze the other half for later.

Awesome...made according to directions, everyone LOVED it!  Made for my son's confirmation ahead of time, only change was to mix sauce with pasta before layering and then add a little more on top.  Noodles were not dry at all!  Highly recommend.  Covered while baking with tinfoil and took off for the last 5 minutes.

This recipe is AMAZING as is, but after reading reviews I'm definitely going to try putting the sauce right on top of the noodles. As others have said it really does make a lot, but I could eat this for days so I don't mind.

I was looking for a recipe without ricotta (not a fan of it at all).  I found this one, which has sour cream instead.  I thought it was strange but figured I could deal with sour cream over ricotta.  It was super easy to make.  I put 1.5 pounds of ground beef because we like a little more meat (with salt, garlic and pepper).  And I used a little less of sour cream then it calls for.  It came out superb!  I am actually going to make this again tonight.  So easy and so delicious.

I loved this recipe!!  It was easy and delicious.  I did a few substitutions.  Instead of ground meat I made it with extra lean turkey, my own homemade sauce (which I add carrots & butternut squash) and instead of sour cream I made it with plain Greek yogurt.  My family loved it!!!!!  They don't know my subs! ??. But it was delicious!!!!!

Everyone in my family was given one request for our Thanksgiving dinner menu. My husband chose baked ziti. I followed some advice in the other reviews and substituted 1 lb of ricotta with one beaten egg for the sour cream. I also used mozzarella instead of provolone. I will absolutely make this dish again. Next time I will add more meat, either ground beef or sausage. We like our sauce a little more meaty than the recipe came out. Also, this recipe makes a HUGE pan of pasta. We will have leftovers for a while, and that's a good thing!

I made this last week and it makes A LOT of ziti. My husband loved it though and it lasted us three days..it would have lasted longer but we didn't want to keep it any longer than that in fear that it would spoil. It was great reheated too. I'll be making this again.

Amazing. We used this recipe for a Halloween Murder Mystery party that we threw. It was easy to prepare and everyone loved it. We had friends asking for the recipe. Little change though. We did 1 part sour cream and 1 part ricotta cheese. We did that so we could get a bit more creaminess into the dish. We just mixed the two up in a bowl and applied it. We also used spicy Italian sausage, it was great.

My go to Ziti recipe. Much faster to put together than lasagna and still has all the cheesy yumminess. It is simple to tailor it to your tastes; more or less cheese, add sausage...whatever works for you. It does make a lot, so good for a crowd.

This is the ziti recipe that my family loves the most. The sour cream and provolone cheese really make it special. I use Sweet Italian Sausage instead of ground beef for more flavor.  I also add sauteed zucchini (1 small) and summer squash (2 small) for more flavor and texture.

This was soooo good.  I used Ricotta instead of sour cream and hot Italian sausage instead of the ground beef.  I mixed everything together except the cheese and layered with provolone and parmesan in between.

Used 16oz ricotta and one egg instead of sour cream and home canned seasoned tomatoe sauce and seasoned ground pork instead of hamburger only because these are what I have on hand. Very tasty combined with pepperoni bread!

What I loved about this recipe is that it is simple and quick to make.  I made a few small changes that in my opinion improved the dish. Substituted 3/4 cup sour cream & 3/4 cup cottage cheese for the 1 1/2 cups sour cream the recipe calls for. I increased the sauce volume by 4 oz's. Increased garlic to 3 cloves. Added fennel seed while simmering the sauce & meat. Baked covered with foil until the last 5 minutes and uncovered it and lightly browned the top under the broiler.

I know no one wants to hear changes to the original recipes but I personally enjoy reading things cooks did to improve or alter a recipe! I've made this exactly as written several times and it's delicious (as long as it's covered so not to dry out).
I didn't have sour cream nor provolone cheese so I made this using a shredded sharp cheese in place of provolone and cottage cheese in place of sour cream... I even used a different spiral pasta... otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was amazingly good!  It had a bit more of a lasagna flare but delicious as well.  I just wanted to share this in case anyone didn't have the exact ingredients on hand... it's very adaptable.  Thanks for a fast easy good recipe!

Ugh...making recipe now and referring back to the webpage here as I prepare...  one thing that is not clear/confusing...in the list of ingredients it say '2 (26 oz) jars of spaghetti sauce'.  Why is the '26 oz' in parenthesis??  Does this mean I need Two 26-oz jars of sauce totaling 52 oz?...Or does this mean I need Two Jars, both of which should total 26 oz together?  It's confusing the way that it is written...  If you mean that I need 52 oz. of sauce, then it should say '52 oz. of spaghetti sauce'.   Otherwise, why even mention the 'two jars', if it is the total amount of sauce (i.e., 52 oz.) that is the more critical piece of information here?

Followed recipe exactly, except made half with Ronzoni's Gluten-Free Penne pasta. The recipe does make a huge amount. I made 2 dishes full, one gluten free and regular.  Both were super yummy.I did mix the pasta with some sauce before layering. Kids loved it too!

Made this for my boyfriend and I and it was very good! Followed the recipe almost exactly besides the noodles and meat. I couldn't find the right noodles at the store so I used penne pasta and it worked just fine. I also used Italian sausage instead of ground beef for a little extra flavor. Very easy to make!

Wow this dish was awesome! I was a little confused why it had such high ratings yet so many reviews switched out so many ingredients it basically became a different recipe... I made it exactly as listed and it came out perfect! Reading the ingredients you can tell it's not a traditional style Italian dish, so don't expect it to taste like  Nonna's ziti with her homemade sauce. It's still fantastic, just in a different way. This was a huge hit with my husband who isn't a big fan of ricotta, which I know to be a staple in many Italian dishes, so it was so nice to find this cheesy, creamy and meaty dish without the ricotta! All in all at a quick, easy and delicious dish that will be a hit with picky eaters.

This recipe is awesome and has become a staple in my household. The only thing I did a little different is to add sauce with the noodles when you first add them in (so they won't be dry).

This was very good. I keep hoping for something more from baked ziti - maybe it just isn't a '5' recipe for my palate. I took it to a potluck and it got raves. I liked the sour cream / provolone approach (vs. ricotta).  We will have an encore for dinner and I know the spouse will like it lots. The only changes I made were sausage for hamburger (... It was already thawed) otherwise followed as written.

Ok so two jars of spaghetti sauce? 52 Oz? Seems excessive. I had one jar, plus a 14 Oz can of tomatoes. Worked out fine, didn't need to cover it either. Also, weirded out by putting the plain pasta right into the pan so maybe next time I'll stir it up with some sauce first?

This was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend suggested this for dinner and we loved it. I added pepper jack cheese in between layers to give it a bit of spice in addition to the other cheeses, it was soo cheesy! It barely fit in my baking pan. Lol. Will be making this time and time again. Thanks for posting this

This is the second time I've made this dish. Both times,  I used mostaccioli instead of ziti, just because I like it better. 
The first time,  I didn't change anything except for the kind of noodles used,  and the family loved it.  We ate the whole dish within 24 hours. (3 people)  
This second time, I divided the ingredients into two baking dishes,  which was definitely a good idea.  I liked that it had lots of cheese and topping along with the noodles. 
I got 72 ounces of sauce rather than 52, and I used every bit of it. I spread it on the bottom of the baking dishes so that the noodles wouldn't stick, as well as mixing it in with the noodles as soon as they were drained, before layering them in the baking dish. 
For the sauce,  I used the meat and onions, but I also added a can of mushrooms.  I will probably add three cans of mushrooms next time. (Drained and dried) 
I would not substitute ricotta for the sour cream,  as I love the way the sour cream tastes in this recipe and the way it cooks up.  I even added slightly more sour cream this second time that I made it. 
As I divided the meal between two dishes, I added spinach to the second,  smaller dish. This one was favored over the other. 
How I layered: small amount of sauce in bottom, ziti/sauce mixture, more sauce (so that ziti doesn't dry out), provolone, sour cream, (then the spinach for one dish), ziti/sauce mixture, sauce, mozzarella, sauce, parmesan. 
Cover for the first 30 minutes of baking.

Such an easy dish! I made this for a staff member to help her family with meals during a hard time. Simple to make, and looks delicious! All the items in the recipe were available in matching quantities at the store; also very helpful.

Really good, really easy. I'm adding some mushrooms and olives, and I substitute ground Italian sausage for the ground beef. That said, the recipe stands just fine as is.

I make this all the time for my 4 kids and for a change, they ALL. like the same thing!  I omit the meat as I have a vegetarian in the group, and they actually prefer it that way.  I have taken it to potluck and come home with an empty  pan each time.

I have made this several times and one of my family's favorites.  I rated it a 5 because it is a recipe you can expand on in so many ways. I've added sausage, garlic powder, italian seasonings, basil, mushrooms. green pepper, and crushed red pepper for a slight kick. Fun to play with!

This recipe is awesome as is!  I have made it multiple times and love the sour cream/provolone combo!  Now, I sauce it up by adding 3 or 4 caramelized onions and 4 or 5 sweet Italian sausages sliced thinly, to the sauce in addition to the hamburger.  YUM!

I've been making this recipe just how it's written for years, in fact this was the first recipe ever got off this website! Always a crowdpleaser. This picture is half vegetarian, half meaty. Mmm!

It was really good.  I wish you would have stated what sauce you used.  We used Gia Russa Marinara sauce.  It could have used a little garlic.  Other than that, we all liked it very much.  Thanks for sharing.

I make this exactly as the recipe states but add protein. Sometimes sausage and sometimes ground turkey. It's also good without.

I made this for a Baby Shower this weekend & it was a HUGE hit. I made 2 changes to kick it up a notch:
 1. I used half Italian sausage and half ground beef for the meat sauce, and
 2.  I added 8 oz of ricotta cheese in with the sour cream for extra creaminess and richness.
This will be a go-to recipe for family gatherings.

Very tasty. My husband thought I used Ricotta cheese because of the mix of the provolone and sour cream layers. Only thing that I should have done is cook a little bit longer to get some of the water out of the noodles at the bottom of the pan. Or let it rest a bit longer. Watery at the bottom. But after awhile it was gone so no complaints here.

This was a good recipe, but if you're picky about Italian food you will want to add fresh basil, fresh rosemary, and crushed red pepper to the sauce. Also, coarse ground black pepper, and 2 tsp of sugar. It will make a big difference.

I made the mistake of adding 1lb of Italian sausage to the sauce after reading reviews that suggested it -- don't do it -- go with either 1lb of ground beef OR 1lb of sausage, or half pound of each. 2lbs of meat is too much for this recipe.

Really wasn't sure about the sour cream and provolone. It wasn't bad, but I think the ricotta/parmesan/egg mixture that goes in a traditional lasagna would have been better.

Will definitely make it again, with the above changes!

I make this all the time and everyone always raves about it! I love making it when we have guests because it feeds so many. The only difference is I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Also, sometimes I mix in ricotta cheese with the sour cream. This is definitely one my whole family eats!

This dish was fairly easy to make as when making the meat and onion the noodles are cooking. So prep is pretty quick. USE FOIL!!!!!! This recipe had a lot of sauce left over, and I agree adding ricotta instead of sour cream in with egg and parsley. But this was a delicious meal and my family enjoyed it!

Anytime there is a group function with my church they ask me to make this ziti. I have changed up the cheese in many ways depending on what I have, but basically I use a little less provolone, about the same mozzarella, and  some 5 or 6 cheese fancy shredded italian sprinkled on top with the parmesan. I also use a little more sauce (about  58-60 ounces). This more than fills a 9x13 baking dish so I put some in a smaller baking dish to leave at home for hubby and me.

Our family of five absolutely loved this dish. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was I left out the minced onion and just added onion powder. If my kids spotted even the tiniest onion while eating it they would say it was the worst thing they every ate. So, problem avoided:)
I will definately make this again the exact same way!

Before making this recipe, I took a look at the reviews to see what changes others have made. The idea of sour cream did not sound appetizing to me, personally. 

I took LP's review and used it to make this recipe. The Baked Ziti tastes absolutely better with ricotta instead of sour cream. Adding the egg to the ricotta before mixing with the pasta adds more creaminess to the dish. Next time I make this dish I'll be cutting the recipe in half since theres only 2 people in my house. The 1X recipe of Baked Ziti lasted us a very long time!

I enhanced store bought marinara sauce with a lot of fresh basil, some dried oregano, red wine, Bay leaf, half a pound of lean hamburger and half a pound of mild Italian sausage, one can of diced tomatoes, and two jars of marinara sauce.

I used four ounces of provolone and less sour cream.  I added ricotta cheese as well and fresh mozzarella.  

It fed eight of us with leftovers to spare. Itr was a hit!

Excellent for feeding a large group of people, and delicious! However, I would recommend baking it in a larger dish. I used a standard 9x13 cake pan and it boiled over slightly in the oven. Also, I added some (a clove or two) minced garlic to the meat and onion mixture and covered with foil for baking.

Really fabulous. I made the suggested changes and tossed the penne and the sauce, then I layered provolone slices on top, dolloped and spread sour cream, another layer of ziti tossed with sauce then the mozzarella and Parmesan. Do not go the ricotta route, boring!

What a great recipe!  I didn't notice the taste of the sour cream at all!  The only thing I did differently was use ground pork since I don't eat beef.  And I followed what everyone else said about adding the sauce first, mixing the noodles with the sauce, and then layering it with the cheese/sour cream combo and so on.  I also added garlic, oregano, basil, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the ground pork as it was cooking. Cooking it covered, but uncovering it the last 5 or less mins to broil the cheese on top.

But these are all just minor details that don't really change the recipe by much.  The recipe will taste good as is!  My husband said it's the best baked ziti he's ever had!

I made this ziti with ricotta instead of provolone & sour cream & it was delicious! My husband loved it! I added about a half cup of water to the meat mixture & did not cover this while baking it & it did not dry out. If you cover this the cheese is going to stick & come off when you remove the covering!

This is one of the first recipes I made from the original cookbook years ago. The ONLY modification from this original recipe that HAS to be done is sauce in the dish before you start. If you only bake it 30 minutes, it shouldn't dry out, but anything with cheese on top, I typically cover. Over the years I have mixed the sauce and noodles together before assembling, added mini pepperoni on top with the cheese, added meatballs to the sauce, swapped out ricotta for the sour cream & provolone and all ways were wonderful. This is a Hall of fame dish. I've been making it since 2002. It's also awesome as a plan ahead dish, assemble and cover with parchment paper under the foil and freeze. Thaw out and bake. Thanks Colleen!

I made this for company tonight! It was very good. The sour cream is a nice addition. I knew I was working late, so I assembled it the night before and put in the fridge. Just needed a little extra time heating up. I didn't change a thing! Yum! I may try with sausage next time.

I made this today. It's very easy and very tasty. I think it would have been better to use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream . I will also half the provolone and add more mozzarella cheese. I think a hint of Italian sausage to spice it up with a kick.  This is a good recipie for beginners.

Easy to make and delicious!!!    I don't know why others are making changes to this recipe.  It is great as-is!   I wouldn't change a thing.  It makes ALOT so invite people over to eat or save it for left overs.  Great recipe -and easy clean up!

I couldn't find full size ziti pasta so I used rigatonni instead and it was fine.  Easy, tasty, and a lot of leftovers.  Kind of the holy trinity in terms of cooking so it's in the rotation.

As is, the sauce seemed  naked. I added 1/2 minced red bell pepper, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and sweated the onions , garlic abd red bell pepper in olive oil. After 10 minutes I removed the vegetables and browned a small can of organic tomato paste in a touch of olive oil(low heat) for 5 minutes, then added the vegetables to the sauce to intensify and fuse the paste for snother 5 minutes. I added the pasta sauce, using a good quality, organic, low sodium sauce, the browned ground beef, seasoned only with fresh black pepper draining the fat before adding to the gravy.  plus 1 cup of red wine, a tablespoon of sugar and about 7-8 good size fresh Pennsylvania white mushrooms thinly sliced. Simmer 90 minutes. I make the gravy the night before and refrigerate it overnight, reheating the gravy the next day until bubbly (about an hour.) However, you can assemble without the extra step of cooling then refrigerating overnight.  You can skip this step

Substitute the sour cream fot 16oz of ricotta mixed with one egg and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.
Prepare the  ziti pasta (I don't salt it). Mix the ricotta with the cooked. Strsin pasta.
After spraying a deep 13x9 with non-stick spray, put 1/3 of the gravy on the bottom, add 1/2 pasta, add 1/3gravy then cheeses. Repeat. Civer and bake for 35-40min, remove foil and bake another 5-10 min. Remove from oven and allow tp sit 20minutes before serving

Instead of sour cream, I used a ricotta mixture containing ricotta, salt, parsley and one egg. Also used sliced cheese instead of shredded and changed the order of the layers with the top layer being the sliced mozzarella to which I added grated Parmesan, garlic powder and some Italian seasoning.  Only other additions/changes I made were to the meat sauce. I used 2 lbs and added mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic along with oregano, parsley and salt then simmered for 2hrs. I baked the dish for 30 mins covered and then again uncovered until it was golden brown. turned out very hearty and delicious.

I made so many adjustments to this, that I can't fairly rate the flavors.  I give it 5 stars based on the techniques for making the dish.  The amounts of noodles, sauce, meat and onions were perfect.  The finished dish was outstanding.  This recipe is a perfect starting off point for making a more personalized version.  And it tastes even better the second day!

This dish is marvelous. It takes a bit of work (I like to make my own spaghetti sauce), but if you have all the ingredients on-hand, it makes a fabulous go-to dish.
I didn't have a problem with the dish drying out but I used a watery spaghetti sauce (Hunts).

I took advice from the reviews & made a few changes of my own.  First, I mixed 15 ounces ricotta cheese with 4 ounces sour cream & an egg, & then I mixed in the ziti.  When browning the onions & beef, I added 1 teaspoon garlic salt, 1/2 teaspoon fresh black pepper, & 1 teaspoon dried garlic before adding the sauce.  I greased the pan with butter & layered in the following order: sauce, ziti, shredded mozzarella, dried basil, sauce, ziti, dried basil, sliced mozzarella.  Notice I completely left out the provolone.  The sliced mozzarella on top gave it a nice clean look, & it was absolutely delicious with the changes!

I  made the recipe as written the first time I made.  My family loved it;  I thought it was good.  The 2nd time, I used italian sausage instead of ground beef and ricotta instead of sour cream.   Fantastic!   The trick to these types of recipes, IMHO, is to be sure to use a pasta sauce that you like.  It can be your own or store bought as long as you like it  & make sure that your pasta is a bit undercooked when you drain it.  Do not rinse the pasta. 
Unless you made this ahead and refrigerated or froze it,  it shouldn't require a cover when baking.  If you did refrigerate it,  cover it for @ 30 minutes  then remove cover to allow cheese to brown while it finishes cooking. 
It makes a lot and I  usually freeze half for another meal.

This came out great!  I added some chopped up italian sausage (without the casings) to the ground beef and subbed in 1/4 of the pasta sauce with alfredo sauce.

Simple, delicious and filling. May try a different kind of meat next time just to change it up but my husband and I both loved it so much that I made it again and froze it for eating during my maternity leave. Thank you!

Awesome recipe! Like a few other reviewers I added some garlic and a few simple seasoning s to the meat. Overall I am very pleased with this recipe and will make it a staple in my home. My husband is from Jersey and has had a lot of baked ziti in life however he couldn't  get enough of this stuff! As with any recipe you have to make it your own and tweak it to your family's  preferences.

I also mixed in the sour cream with the meat sauce and the pasta and put it in the pan and layered it with cheese and it came out delicious. Also make sure you use the Ziti with the Ridges on it so it can hold the sauce and meat better.

I am 16 and I  made this the other day for myself and my father while my mother was out of town on buisness; the meal was absolutely fantastic, and the only complaint on my father's end was that I didn't send him to work with enough haha. It serves large portions, is cheesy, and absolutely perfect for any family gathering. My only changes were that instead of beef, I used ground Italian sausage, and I also baked it with aluminum foil covering it (though that's kind've obvious)

We are vegetarian and I have young, very particular eaters so we left out the beef and replaced the onions with onion powder. I also added some fresh chopped garlic and made it with whole wheat noodles. It was such a big hit that we have added it to our monthly meal rotation.

I baked mine UNCOVERED for 30 minutes and it was delicious. I didn't use two whole jars of sauce more like 1 1/2. I also used a half pound of sliced cheese and chopped up 2 cloves of garlic to cook with the meat. Mhmm my taste buds were singing!

I made this with the Gluten free  elbow noodles from Aldi, Ragu spaghetti sauce and ricotta instead of sour cream because I like it better. It made so much food. It made 3 meals for my family of 4.

This recipe is super delicious, quick and fool proof. I like my pasta dishes a bit on the sweet side so I always add sugar to my sauce by default. It's the only dish people request when we have food functions.

This was a hit! I made it for the first time as a take-along dish for my niece's graduation party - a gutsy call - but it worked out.  It was a smash.  I made it again the next day for my own family and they loved it too.  Don't let the non-traditional ingredients like sour cream and provolone throw you.  This is way better than any ricotta version.  Highly recommend!

PS:  I cut the sour cream to 1 cup and eliminated the parmesan as it wasn't needed.  Of course covering the dish is a must - I used an extra large Corning Ware I greased with cooking spray with a glass cover and it worked well.

This is the best and I will continue using the recipe. I did make some changes based on other reviewers. I covered the meal so it wouldn't dry out. I covered the ziti with the sauce between layers and at the bottom. I was skeptical about using sour cream but it was awesome. I used light sour cream and I added extra cheese. I had leftovers and froze sections enough for two people. I used tin foil and a zip lock. We've already had one section - I baked in the tin foil on a pan in the convection oven.  For me , it took about 40-45 minutes to warm from frozen and it was still awesome!  Thank you for sharing!

Very tasty! I may use a 3rd jar of sauce next time. It was just a little dryer than we like. But this recipe is definitely a repeater!

My husband doesn't care for ricotta so I tried this. He disliked it so much he will not eat it. I thought it was ok and ate it. However, I will go back to the traditional Italian recipe going forward.  I did appreciate that the recipe was easy to follow and it's not bad but the provolone did not add to the dish. It just tasted odd to me.

Delicious!    The only change I made was adding a lot of fresh basil, sliced mozzarella cheese (that's all I had on hand) and mixing the noodles with the meat sauce then layering it. The oven time was good and the noodles were cooked perfectly. Would definitely make again for a Sunday meal.

This was excellent!! This is my first time ever making baked ziti. I don't like ricotta cheese so this sour cream recipe worked great for me. I did as other reviewers mentioned, putting the sauce on the bottom of ziti. I omitted onions and used Italian sausage spaghetti sauce! I also covered the dish with foil as it baked. So so good!! Will be making again

Homemade Sauce instead of canned. Try "World's Best Spaghetti Sauce" with ground chicken and ground sweet Italian chicken sausage instead of beef and pork. Add an additional tsp of salt, fresh rosemary, fresh basil, red wine instead of water, triple the garlic. If you're lazy, place everything on low in a crockpot for five hours after you've browned the meat. As for this recipe, halve the sour cream and replace the other half with ricotta. Mix the sour cream and ricotta into the noodles (it will look like white sauce) and add freshly chopped parsley. To assemble: 1/2 noodles, 1/2 cheese (I also add mozzarella and Parmesan), 1/2 sauce. This will make two layers. Bake covered in aluminum until the last ten minutes.

Didn't make any changes except scaling it down by half.  The whole pan was gone less than 24 hours later between my husband and I.  I was a little leery about using the sour cream but it came out fantastic!

This was awesome! I read some reviews and mixed all of my sauce in with the noodles before layering but that is all I really did different. I thought the sour cream would be weird but it just made a creamy sauce. I used whole wheat pasta and organic ingredients to make it a little healthier. I covered and baked it for 30 minutes and uncovered it and broiled it for 3 minutes (Watch it!). It was very good. We have plenty leftover for lunch this week!

I made the recipe as written. It was OK. The Provolone adds a smoky taste which seemed out of place, and the sour cream broke down and made the dish a bit watery.

Great recipe that I've made many times.Only changes I made is to substitute hot sausage for the ground beef and after the sauce and meat have marinated I stir the sour cream into sauce mixture.

Loved this recipe!  ..   Followed  other suggestions and added my sauce before adding the middle layer of cheese.  I also sliced up some hot Italian sausage and added it to the sauce.  Turned out awesome.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used ricotta instead of sour cream. I made sure to buy nonsmoked provolone. It came out pretty good, my husband and I enjoyed it. Will probably make it again in the future.

I used the Ragoo chunky mushroom and added a little garlic powder and McCormick Italian Seasoning to it. I also doubled the mozzarella. We loved it! Next I make it I'm going to try a little ricotta cheese and go half and half with hamburger and Italian sausage.

An easy and delicious recipe.  The only change I made was to delete the Provolone, and use grated Parmesan cheese.  I've made it three times and twice I used my own sauce (that which I had made) instead of jarred, but the jarred sauce works well, too.  The nice thing is that it can be made in advance and frozen.  I did this for a party last year where I did half of the cooking (the other half was Chipotle catering), and it was a big hit, not only with the adults, but with the teenagers who attended.  To me, that always says a lot about a recipe (when a teenager is impressed).

I made this for dinner earlier this week and it was a hit with my husband. The only thing I changed with the recipe is I added more meat and less onion. I also added minced garlic and used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. I will be making this again, no doubt!

Super easy!I. used 85% lean ground meat. Used Ragu chunky style garden combination sauce-it was all I had.  Used olive oil to coat pan and a little less cheese. Best Ziti I ever had! Thank you for a great recipe!

I had leftover penne noodles and sauce.  I didn't have any provolone cheese so I added more mozzarella instead.  It came out so creamy and delicious.

This was absolutely delicious! Definitely going to my favorites. The whole family and then some loved it! Very cheesy - well, I added more to mine because I love cheese. Great flavor. I mixed the sauce mixture with the cooked ziti and then layered in the pan. Just thought that was easier and the sauce would flavor the noodles during baking. Great meal!

IMO the dish was a bit bland and a little wet for being "baked" ziti. I suggest taking the sauce down a bit and adding extra spices to make it taste more Italian. I got no complaints from the family so I would probably make it again with a few alterations.

We actually made two pans one w sour cream and one with ricotta and while both were delicious - I dare say he sour cream tasted "creamier" and better! Great easy recipe! Only change was I used half turkey/half ground meat and onions were puréed (kids were always picking out the onions so I "hid" them).

My husband went crazy for this baked ziti!! I honestly didn't miss the ricotta at all. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a little less pasta because I like a lot of sauce, and I also added garlic because we are garlic lovers. I followed another reviewer's tip to use Classico Sausage and Pepper sauce and I'm so glad I did. It had tremendous flavor without having to bother using half sausage and half ground beef. You could try any variety of sauces with this recipe and it would still taste fantastic. The only thing my husband requested for next time I make this was to add mushrooms.

My family really liked this.  I did half of it as directed for myself and my boys, and the other half with a vegetarian meat substitute and cottage cheese instead of sour cream for my husband.

Not a big fan. Don't know if I did something wrong or not, but the top layer of pasta and cheese came out a little dry and crispy. Flavor was good.

I was very surprised no ricotta cheese;however, I was anxious to give it a try.  Not thrilled about it but it was good. Not the same as its true Italian counterpart, weI felt it lacked the cheesiness we love.  And needed more spices.  Baked ziti is my sons favorite but he wasn't in love with this.

Absolutely delicious. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and added organic baby portobello mushrooms. I was doubtful of the sour cream since my husband hates it, although I love it, so I used a little less than the recipe called for and added some cottage cheese and a splash of whipping cream and stirred it all together. He had no idea the sour cream was there and ate a bunch! So very good, will make again!

Easy and tasty. As suggested by some other reviewers, I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. Next time, I'll add chopped spinach to the ricotta and make it resemble lasagne even more than it already does!

Followed some suggestions from the comments and swapped sour cream for ricotta. Also, put some meat sauce on the bottom of the pan before layering. Easy and tasty. Great success coupled with a side salad.

The only changes I made was to mix the sauce in with the ziti as others suggested, added minced garlic to the meat & onions  & increased the provolone & mozzarella to 8 oz each. I also covered the dish with tin foil so that it would not dry out.

Made a few changes & it turned out great!

Used 2 28oz cans of cento crushed tomatoes instead of pasta sauce , added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions just before adding the beef.  2 Tbs of chopped basil just before adding the tomato sauce.  Then used nonfat greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and Romano instead of Parmesan on top. Finally, olive oil to coat the pan instead of butter. 

My 8 year old son...who usually just wants mac & cheese or chicken nuggets...asked if he could have it again for dinner tomorrow night! That's a WIN

Great recipe...Needs a bit for more for me. Another half can of sauce...half  more of  Mozzarella....whole onion is not necessary ...20% less works for a none onion eater, and not an onion fan...roll yellow. Can hardly taste it, but makes the beef taste better. Hope this helps.

This was the first baked ziti recipe I've attempted, and I found it simple to follow, delicious, and economically sound for my family of 9. The only change I made was to the shredded parmasian cheese.  I found that 2 tbl was laughable as a "sprinkling" I upped it to 6 tbl and had a decent cover that still allowed for the pasta to shine through!

This is delicious!  I was skeptical because of the jar sauce, but I've made it several times with different brands of sauce and it has been fabulous every time.  I have used ground turkey instead of beef and it maintained its deliciousness!   I really have to watch my weight and I have to control myself or we would eat this every week.  I often cut the recipe in half, but it freezes very well.  I usually keep it covered with foil until the last 15 minutes of baking time.  I love this stuff!

Delicious!!  I used a penne pasta (I used a pretty good quality pasta that I bought at Nugget Market).  I put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan, then pasta, more sauce, then sour cream and I also used some ricotta cheese, provolone and mozzarella.  Then another layer of pasta, more sauce, more provolone and mozzarella on top and a generous topping of parmesan cheese.  Doubled the recipe for a group of 12 and baked it about 80 minutes at 375 degrees, then removed the foil and browned the top for about 10 min more.  Sooooooo good!

This is my go to recipe but I don't follow it lol. I listen to the first reviewers suggestion and mix 1lb ricotta with an egg and then mix in the cooked ziti (I use penne). Then I layer sauce, pasta mix, mozz cheese, parm cheese, basil and oregano and then one last layer, ending with sauce on top. I always use my own marinara which has crumbled meat in it so it adds a little extra protein too. Always rave reviews with people asking for the recipe.

This was the first time I ever made a baked ziti, so I really don't have anything to compare to, but it was a very easy dish to make.  My family liked it, so I will be making this again. Maybe use ground turkey meat or ground sausage.  After all a recipe is just a mere guideline.

This recipe was great! at first I was a bit iffy on the sour cream but I'm not a fan of changing recipes. Surprising it tasted wonderful! I used my own pasta sauce so the peeping took much longer. Thanks for the great dish! I WILL be making this again

Made this dish tonight and it was wonderful. I cut the ingredients by 1/2 as the original recipe could easily feed a large family.  I made the dish as directed, but I did use Italian turkey sausage instead of beef.  It was a hit with my household. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again!!

Really good dish. A little too much onions for my liking, but that can easily be adjusted. The cheeses were great together. I did add a little bit of Italian sausage to the sauce, which gave the dish even more flavor.

My husband said this was the best baked ziti "out of this world" he had ever had and he is not easy to please. I was very skeptical of the sour cream but used it anyway and my hubby's reaction to the meal shocked even me. So I'm sticking with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!!

Pretty good and easy. I added a few seasonings , red pepper flakes, and fresh garlic. Didn't have provolone nor ricotta so I softened cream cheese and added an egg. I believe the egg kept it moist, otherwise would've turned out dry.

Loved it! No meat and it was delicious! Made spaghetti sauce (Food.com-My Super Simple Spaghetti Sauce) Doubled the patch!
 To freeze:  Put in freezer to get firm and then cut into serving size ( like lasagna serving size)  Wrap each piece in heavy duty aluminum foil or freezer bags.

I cooked this last night over at my friends house and it turned out perfect! This is good especially for those people who don't like sour cream because you can't taste it at all once it's all cooked. I read reviews for people to to try ricotta instead of sour cream, but I like the difference. Such a good recipe! And I had it for leftovers for lunch the next day and it still tasted just as good!

even without the sour cream, this ziti was delicious!   I also forgot the onion!  Bless my heart.  I just added onion powder instead, along with Italian seasoning.  with a side of flat bread, this meal hit the spot!

Make sure sauce can get through to bottom layer, otherwise you end up with plain cooked pasta down there. The entire recipe barely fit in the dish, we put it on a baking sheet just in case. Very good and simple!

I left out the ground beef as I wanted a meatless dish.  I sauteed chopped zucchini, spinach, and mushrooms with the onion in Step #2 and continued to follow the recipe exactly as written.  It was FABULOUS!

Really liked it! The first time, I made the recipe as given.  2nd time I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta and liked that better. It definitely does NOT fit in a 9x13 dish though.  I used the extra  in a pyrex loaf pan and froze it for a small meal later.

This was so delicious. Topped it with dried oregano, parsley, and basil. Covered with foil for 20 minutes, 10 without and it was perfect. Definitely keeping this one around.

I looked at multiple recipes and reviews trying to tweak it using this recipe as a primary base.

I broke down the 1 1/2 cups of sour creme to 3/4 a cup of sour cream and ricotta which was well worth it. there was enough creaminess from the sour cream while letting the ricotta stand out on top (yet still not overpowering).

Of the 3 times I have made the recipe I used regular ground beef twice and ground Italian sausage once. If you can, I highly recommend getting some Italian sausage, you can still season the meat (more below) but the sausage added much more robust flavor. In terms of the meat, as I cook it I add a little rosemary, fresh chopped basil, Italian seasoning, thyme, and minced garlic which helps really add some depth to the meat and dish.

Finally I personally recommend cooking it covered for 30 min before then cooking it uncovered for an extra 15. Its better to then let it rest for maybe 10 min or so to let it keep form better, but not required if you or the people your feeding are hungry :)

I am like "BAYOU GATOR" when I read his review I smiled... YES cook covered... YES layer with the sauce directly on the ziti (and stir it around the dish a couple times so the sauce gets into the ziti).  I made this recipe exactly, with the exception of the one small change (the layering) it was REALLY GOOD!!! The entire family loved it.  I made it the next time and split the sour cream with ricotta (because I had it handy) and that is REALLY GOOD TOO :) honestly I didn't expect a simple recipe that is so quick to taste so good but it was and it did!!! Happy cooking folks :)

Very good.  I did half the recipe since I do have a small family.  I used equal amounts of sour cream and ricotta cheese.  I had some left over baby spinach that I added to the layers and it came out wonderfully.

I made  this tonight and thought it was really good!  I liked it more than my husband who said it was "good" which means it was alright.  I did add some fresh garlic and a bit of Italian seasoning. Served it with a nice caprese and a nice garlic cheese toast.   I will make it again for sure!

This is by far the best Baked Ziti recipe. I must say that I also layer it differently. I do 1/2 ziti, 1/2 sauce and mix it. Then sour cream and provolone on top. Ziti and sauce (mix it again), mozzarella and parmesan. I constantly get requests to make it. Everyone loves it!!!

This was amazing. I made it for a dinner party and people are still talking about it weeks later. The only things I changed: I changed the layering to put the sauce right after the noodles, then added the cheeses; and I covered the dish with aluminum foil when baking. Fantastic recipe!!!!

Wow this was amazing!  I was a bit skeptical when I saw sour cream, but this came out very very good.  I used 1lb of italian sausage and 1/2lb of ground beef.  Like other reviewers have said, make sure you put sauce on top of the bottom layer of pasta before you put the provolone cheese.

This is very delicious!  I prepared it as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  It has lots of flavor and when you're in the mood for a hearty pasta dinner without the time for making lasagna, this is it.  I will make this again and again.

I got rave reviews on this - from both the in-laws and my husband! I can't do beef, so I used ground turkey. I followed other reviews and put garlic in with the meat while browning. I also seasoned the turkey with a fair amount of salt and pepper, just to get it to taste like something;). I made it with penne pasta noodles, which worked great. I also followed what other reviewers said and layered as follows: noodles, sauce, sour cream, provolone, noodles, sauce and mozzarella.  It makes a lot, but it all fit in my 9 x 13 dish. You just need to have a deeper 9 x 13, because it builds up tall once you finish your layers. There were four adults eating hearty portions and we still had over half the dish for leftovers. Big hit!

This is a really easy recipe. I made this for a New Years Eve party and it is a great hearty meal. I added some sun dried tomatoes and a couple tablespoons of basil pesto to the sauce. Really yummy!

The only change I made was using ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.

I have made this for the Local Fire Department twice and my pan is always empty before I can get any.

This is a fantastic dish, but having said that, it's relative I suppose to the changes I made to it when I made it.  I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb Italian sausage.  I also used more then 6 oz mozzarella.  I also added about 3 T sugar to the sauce just because my husband likes his pasta dishes with a hint of sweetness.  Otherwise, followed the directions.
   I don't think you will go wrong making this dish exactly as stated!  I just tweaked it for my own personal preference.

I followed the directions except once assembled, I put it in the refrigerator until the next day. Then heated it for 40 minutes at 375.  It was barely warm but extremely delicious!  Everyone said they would have this ziti over lasagna!

It was simple and tasteful. I added seasoning to the meat, garlic powder, onion powder, season salt, and all purpose seasoning. It was a BIG hit for my family.  This will be added to my list of dishes to make regular. My kids loved it and got seconds.!

This is great.  I can never find ziti at my store so I use penne and my daughter loves it.  The sour cream is a must, but I've tried this without the provolone and I can't tell the difference at all. Saves me 3 bucks.  I also don't use onions or meat in it.  It's great without as well.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It's a staple for me to make for potlucks or anywhere I need to take a main dish.  It's fairly quick to prepare and I keep most of the ingredients on hand, so I have to do minimal shopping.  I changed the way I layer it based on another review; I mix the ziti (or penne) with the sauce, then add provolone, sour cream and the next layer of ziti with sauce, then the mozzarella and Parmesan.  It's always a hit and I pass the link to the recipe out every time I make it!

I made this exactly as  the recipe, although I left out the meat for a vegetarian in my family. Everyone absolutely loved it! I did cover with foil for 30 min and then uncovered for 10. It was very cheesy and very moist. I like it better than with ricotta!

I'm normally not a fan of leftovers.... And my boyfriend and I ate this 3 nights in a row!! The only thing I changed was adding the sauce directly on top of the noodles when layering it. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe to a T,  except that i dereased the ground meat by 1/2 and substituted ground Italian pork sausage in the recipe. I used Newman Own Marinara sauuce.
 
My guests raved about it and several requested recipes. I will definitely  be service this again  soon.

I should have read the reviews about using ricotta in place of sour cream, this didn't quite meet expectations. It was okay but could use improvements. I've had a vegetarian version of this and I thought it was better. The hamburger and sour cream seemed to detract.

I did not make any changes to this recipe the first several times I made it and it turned out great. The only thing I do now that is different is ad or subtract some spices to it like Italian seasoning or maybe some garlic seasoning. I use Muir Glen organic sauce. Anyone who has tried this meal from me loves it. I do bake it uncovered and to me it does not dry it out.

Very good recipe. Only 4 stars as they didn't specify to bake it COVERED! It will dry out if you don't cover it. Thankfully I am an experienced cook and knew to cover it. But for people new to cooking this might screw up the recipe for them.

This was real easy and fairly quick. Made it on a weeknight and used some leftover breakfast sausage. I didn't have provolone so just used more mozzarella. Paired with some garlic bread (ok, frozen) and we've got a winner!

I did add fresh garlic and seasonings to the meat as it was browning. At first I wasnt sure about the sour cream because I have always used ricotta cheese but Im glad I followed the recipe. I did not make any substitutions  or omit anything. It was delicious  and I will definitely make it again.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly as written. It was very good as written. This recipe exceeded my expectations. I wanted to alter it as I made it because I was fairly sure it wouldn't be that great but I fought the urge and made it as written. It was easy, quick, budget-friendly, and it made a lot. I halved the recipe and it could've easily still fed 4-6 people. And it tasted very good. Next time I will make the full recipe and freeze half. Will definitely make again.

Not a big fan of ricotta, so loved the sour cream and provolone cheeses. I used veggie penne and ground turkey.

This recipe has been a hit in my house full of boys for years.  It has even topped Lasagna - and that is what I won my husband over with years ago when we were dating.  Don't change a thing about this recipe.  It is fantastic.  Feeds a crowd and is great as left-overs.

I have made this baked ziti several times and it is always a big hit. Even the kids asked for seconds.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to saute the onions and garlic in a little bacon fat I had on hand. I also mixed the first layer of ziti with the sauce and covered the dish while baking as suggested by other reviewers. This has become a staple meal in my household!!

I chose this recipe because it was very simple and although I didn't follow the recipe exactly, it was pretty close.  My whole family really enjoyed it, my grandmother did not believe that I made it myself, and my mother and brother swore there was ricotta in it.

I loved this recipe and so did my family.  Made some adjustments.  Added oregano, basil and egg to the sour cream gave it a great flavor and consistency.  Also cooked for 15 minutes without foil to brown.  Then I sprayed Pam on foil so it would not stick and sealed the ziti.  Came out very moist!

I love ziti but like the comment LP made is exactly how I have always made it and I guess being too old to change and ricotta is what I have always used. I actually tried this recipe and liked it !

As a mother of three, I have made Baked Ziti a hundred times and tried several different recipes. This is my favorite because it is so much moister than the ricotta versions. The sour cream and provolone = DELICIOUS! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

Let me just explain to you how good this recipe is.  I've made this at least 50 times so far over the last 4 or 5 years.  And not because I want to, but because it is requested for family, friend, or work functions and even by my 6 year-old son and fiance for family dinner.  I've made it just as the recipe specifies except subbing ground turkey for the ground beef, and it's really good.  

Over the years, however, I've tweaked it a bit.  Now I make it using ground turkey and turkey Italian sausage in the sauce, browning that with garlic, onion, and green pepper (and sometimes a little cayenne pepper).  I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before putting in the first layer of noodles and mix it up to coat the noodles with sauce.  I use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, and I use way more of it, maybe 1 1/2 cups to get a thick layer over the provolone.   I use nearly the whole bag of parmesan cheese on top.  It's a winner.

It was OK; probably better if I cooked it "right".  I realized I didn't have any provolone so I skipped that.  Even so,  I don't think it was awesome.  I'll try another recipe for this next time.

Absolutely delicious, but I used cheddar instead of Provolone and lasagne instead of the ziti - tastes amazing and my fussy children ate every morsel.

Sounded good but for a glaring omission: garlic!  Gotta add garlic.  An idea for this, particularly for kids is to add a layer of pepperoni in the middle.  To make things easier you can also get 4 cheese Italian blend shredded cheese, for the bottom layer just mis with the sour cream amd spread together (on top of the sauce so it doesn't seal the sauce from the lower noodles.  Just variations to try

This recipe is great! I've baked it 3 times in two months.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and I used ricotta instead of sour cream.  As others stated, I started with sauce at the bottom of the pan instead of butter.  My child loves it and it's a big hit with my extended family and friends!

We loved this! We were craving lasagna but didn't want to put that much work in, this was perfect! I used a pound each of ground beef and Italian sausage. I added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and mrs dash to the meat sauce combo. After reading other reviews, I decided to mix the pasta with the meat sauce before layering as the recipe states. We like it really cheesy so I used about double the amount of mozzarella and instead skipped out on the Parmesan. I used a 9x15 in pan and it fit perfect. Covered with foil for about 40 min and uncovered for about 10 min. I will definitely be making this again. It was so easy, inexpensive, and incredibly delicious!

We thought this was pretty bland.  I even added spices to it (italian seasoning and garlic) and used a sauce that we usually love and we still didn't care too much for this.

AMAZING flavor and so easy to make! My family raved about this. I wanted to make a layered pasta dish and this was perfect. I cut the recipe in half and there was plenty of leftovers for us (family of 3 adults). Yum! I tossed all the pasta with spaghetti sauce before I started the layering and put the rest of the sauce in the cooked meat. I love bubbly mozzarella cheese so I saved it for the top. Other than that I made it just as described. :)

This is a family favorite. My kids now compare all baked ziti with this one and this always wins. Even my nephew who claimed to not like baked ziti loved it and had seconds. I did change the layering like some of the other reviews and instead of ground beef I use ground hot sausage. This is definitely a recipe that will get passed on in our family.

I added fresh minced garlic, basil, oregano, fennel, and parsley. I also used 1/4 c of red onion and 1/2 cup yellow onion. I added 1/2 lb of sausage. I also omitted the provolone cheese and added more parmesan cheese. I went for the more Italian style, only, I didn't have ricotta cheese on hand. So I used the sour cream. It turned out yummy!

Best Baked Ziti I've ever made!!!... 
Although I was taken aback by sour cream as an ingredient, I challenged myself dislikes and added it anyhow. I'm so glad I did.

Typical of me, I did tweek the recipe a bit by substituting red meat with ground turkey meat. I then seasoned both turkey meat and sauce with a variety of seasonings, such as garlic, pepper, sazón, caraway seeds, Italian herbs, parsley and dark brown sugar. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was FANTASTIC!!!!  Que Rico!!!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was adding some ground sausage and a dash of oregano because the sauce I used was too plain. Other than that I used all of the ingredients listed and baked it uncovered. It didn't dry out at all.  Will be making this one again for sure!

I am Italian and actually love ricotta cheese, but my family does not.  So I was pretty excited to find a baked ziti recipe with an alternative to the ricotta component.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except for the fact that I made a vegetarian version, subbing some zucchini and mushrooms for the meat.  And I did follow the advice of others about putting the sauce layer on top of the penne before the cheeses.

The outcome?  Well, I liked it, and thought it was a nice change from traditional baked ziti. It was very tasty and light.  I don't think it is better than the old stand-by, but still very good.  My teenage daughter loved it, and ate 3 helpings.  My son wouldn't touch it, but he doesn't like tomato sauce, and my spouse thought the sour cream gave it a strange taste.  

So there you have it.  It's a mixed review, but largely positive, and I'm glad I tried it!  Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow...

What a great recipe!  I did make as written, however, followed the suggestion of others to put a layer of sauce on the first layer of ziti.  Does feed a crowd or leftovers freeze well.  Well worth making.

I made this recipe for my family of 4 last night. I should mention that it's very rare they all agree on a meal. Well, they LOVED this! Every one of them. It's definitely going to be a regular meal in our house. I didn't change anything, and it tasted amazing. I highly recommend this dish.

I took the advice of the others and used a small tub of ricotta cheese with an egg mixed in (instead of sour cream), added some Italian herbs to the sauce, layered the dish as follows: sauce--> noodles--> ricotta cheese mix--> sauce--> provolone cheese slices --> noodles --> sauce --> shredded mozzarella.  I baked it for 30 min covered with tin foil, put a little more mozzarella cheese on the top and baked it for another 10 minutes to get bubbly and ever so slightly browned.  Let it rest for 5 minutes or you'll melt your face off.

To quote my finicky seven year old, "I don't like this Dad, I LOVE it.  Can we have this tomorrow too?"

Made as described without covering and it came out pretty good. No complaints from my picky teenagers. Only additions I added were garlic and peppers.

Be prepared for leftovers! This recipe is great if you want a lot of deliciousness with not a lot of real work. The wait is the hardest part as you can smell it as it's cooking. I add a little bit of minced garlic just because we like garlic and I use a little extra sauce as there is a chance the recommended amount might not be enough.

I love this baked ziti! I've been making it for several years. The only thing I do different is I sometimes toss my pasta in the sour cream. I also add some cream cheese to the sauce. I have a friend who will change my oil in exchange for a pan!

What an easy and delicious dish to make.  I made it for my 4th of July party and everyone loved it. Because I love in New Zealand and provalone cheese does not exists on this side of the world, I used Edam cheese instead.  As suggested, I did a layer of sauce first, then pasta, and so forth.  Bake covered so it doesn't dry out. This recipe is a keeper!

My whole family loved it! Some of us had seconds and even thirds! I have never had baked ziti before this, it reminds me a lot of lasagna. I will definitely add this to our favorites list.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little sauce to each layer of noodles in addition to the original directions. Also, I covered the dish with foil while it cooked.

I made a variation of this. Sautee in olive oil 1 each green, red, and yellow pepper, one medium size onion, and two cloves garlic. add 1 lb ground hot Italian sausage. cook on medium heat until sausage is cooked through. add a dash of pepper to taste. boil ziti. mix ricotta with pasta sauce. layer pasta, sauce,  meat mixture, and mozzarella cheese in casserole.  top with mozzarella cheese. bake in oven until bubbly.

FINALLY!  All by ziti tries in the past have been totally dry and just blah.  This, however, is amazing!  Super easy to out together.  I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I used mild cheddar.  No biggie.  Still super cheesy and a HUGE hit with the family.  Oh, this feeds about 8-10 people.  Keeper, for sure!

Some changes... But stuck to basic except made my own sauce (Lidia's).  Mixed noodles in 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 riccoti cheese.  1/2 cup of 6 Italian cheese and 1 cup mozzarella.   Oh and used 6 slices of provolone....

Definitely a hit! A couple of things I would suggest is to sub ground Italian sausage instead of ground beef. More flavor would be perfect. Also, I do agree to cover it with some tinfoil when you cook it.

Easy, fast, economical, GOOD = 5 star recipe in my world!  I used whole grain pasta and reduced fat sour cream to help make it a bit healthier. I also cut the recipe in half, using an 8x8 baking dish, which fit perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Colleen B. Smith!

This dish was so quick to prepare and bake.  It was so yummy and most of all my family loves it.  I never thought about using the three recommended cheeses all together.  The cheeses really gave the dish an Italian flavor.

I substituted ground turkey but otherwise made as directed and this was quite good.  It definitely would not fit in a 9x13 pan.  I had a slightly bigger pan (9x15 maybe?) and it fit perfectly.

I've made this recipe twice, and it's so delicious. I was hesitant at first using the sour cream, but I wasn't disappointed at all. I use the entire 16 ounces of sour cream, 8 oz. bag of mozzarella cheese, and 1/2 lb of sliced mozzarella. I also add 1 tsp each of oregano, parsley, and garlic. I would also cover it next time, and add a little extra sauce.

Very good flavor for a pretty simple pasta dish...I added some garlic to the meat/onion mixture and I used 1/2 ground pork with 1/2 ground mild italian sausage ( I rarely use ground beef in anything).  Lastly, I added some frozen chopped spinach to sneak in veggie power for my kids...I can't give 5 stars only because I made modifications...

This is a GREAT recipe! It's also super easy to throw together. I deducted a star because I think the recipe calls for way too much onion. I used half of an onion and it was still way too much. My boyfriend said I should leave it out because it "doesnt do anything for the dish". So if you aren't huge on onion I recommend not putting any at all. The recipe is also way too much for a 9x13 dish. I had about a third of the noodles left over and my dish was filled to the rim. The great thing about this recipe is you can add as much or little cheese and sauce as desired. This is an awesome dish. My boyfriend and I ate on it all day and finished it, too.

This recipe is a go-to in the house.  Eat it bi weekly.  We only use 1 can of tomato sauce.  I can't imagine 2 and we LOVE tomato sauce.  Otherwise it's perfect!!

Very good and not dry like a lot of recipes I have tried.  Extremely simple.  I will try sausage instead of beef next time and possible add mushrooms.

Like most recipes, I made my own sauce and swapped out some ingredients for others to make it my own, and I'm not Italian (I'm just a potato eater), so I won't weigh in on the authenticity of this recipe, but it turned out great.  The sour cream instead of ricotta cheese saves me from the "intestinal discomfort" that ricotta cheese gives me and tastes great.  I made it for 17 of my students for lunch and they all raved about it.  It was gone in less than five minutes.  This recipe is great.

Loved it, could have used an extra pound of meat because I love meat. But overall very good and easy.

Family liked it. It was a little dry so next time I would add a little more sour cream or possibly more spaghetti sauce.

I followed the suggestion to use Ricotta cheese and an egg instead of sour cream and mixed it with the ziti. Used 1 pound sweet Italian sausage and 1 pound ground pork and added some nutmeg (1/2 tsp) to the jarred sauce. Also skipped the provolone and added slices of mozz cheese on top. Cooked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 15 to brown the cheese. OUTSTANDING results and a new family favorite!

Only four stars because we felt we made it a little better with the following changes: Increased the sauce, doubled the cottage cheese and sour cream, added Italian seasoning to the meat and used a Lasagna cheese blend instead of just mozzarella. It was so good, I'm sure it would still excellent prepared as directed.

We made the vegetarian version of this recipe. Followed the basic ingredients, except used half portions. We ate almost all of it in one sitting! Absolutely loved the gooey cheese! We have made recipes similar to this, but have never thought to add sour cream to it. It really made a nice, tangy, creamy taste to it. It's definitely comfort food. We will be making this again.

I made this recipe almost as it is but I did add 2 large Cloves of garlic to the onion and oil.  I also mixed the sauce with the noodles before layering in the pan. I took this to work for a potluck and it was a huge hit. There was nothing left.
***The sour cream and provolone combination is what makes this recipe so special.

This is so amazingly delicious and easy.  I think I'll skip making lasagna and opt for this Italian dish instead.  I end up spending an hour and a half making homemade lasagna and this baked ziti was done within an hour including prep time.  A crowd and family pleaser for sure!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I use all these ingredients instead of the ground beef but i sautéed mushrooms when I am sautéing my onions and then I add my sauce. I also cook meatballs as directed and when they are done I cut them into 4s and add that into my sauce mixture just because I love my meat in bigger pieces. I bake it uncovered every time and it comes out perfect!

I've tried this recipe exactly as written, and I've also had to substitute the sour cream with plain greek yogurt (I didn't have sour cream on hand). No matter how I've made it, it was always delicious. My family and friends always compliment me on it. Thanks for sharing!

I made the Baked Ziti last night for dinner and loved it.  I substituted Johnsonville Sausage for the ground beef. I also used used Ziti and Rigatoni. One unexpected thing that happened was that the Ziti ended up finding its way inside the Rigatoni which made for a different texture when eating it. YUMMY!!!?

This is so amazing!  We all love it!  There's not a lot going on here so we always use a sauce we love--Cascone's.  It may be a local brand.  Anyway, I may season the ground beef a bit next time but as written, this is a winner!

This recipe is the entire reason I started eating canned spaghetti sauce.  I was the type of person who would make spaghetti for my family but then I would eat something  else. I was just never a fan.  Until this recipe.  Made exactly as is it is absolutely amazing!  I am now a fan of spaghetti sauce again!

This dish is so easy, and definitely a crowd-pleaser. I substituted diced zucchini in place of the meat, and it turned out terrific. The addition of the chicken broth is genius - it didn't dry out like other recipes and I think enhanced the flavor. This may end up becoming a staple in my house. Next time I'm going to try making it in the crock pot for an easy weeknight dish.

All I can say is this is a hit.  Possibly the best thing I've ever made from this site.  Everyone was pleased! 

I made this for a potluck...on the wrong day.  I was wondering what I was going to do with sooooo much food left, but I didn't need to worry.  This was all but gone the very next day!

I made a few changes based on what I had and my energy level (I'm currently 5 1/2 months pregnant, so energy is a commodity these days).  
*Use 1 lb ground turkey
*brown 1 (orange) bell pepper and 1 small onion with the turkey...season the meat with seasoned salt, garlic powder, and black pepper to taste.
*mix 8oz sour cream w/ 8oz Philadelphia Garden Vegetable spread (I was not about to measure the sour cream and the cream cheese adds a lot of flavor).

I had high hopes for this given its high reviews, but I wasn't a fan. All I could taste in this dish was the sour cream. I'd use ricotta next time.

This is now a family favorite! Everyone loves it, even the kids. I skip the onion because my kids don't like it. It's often requested at my house.

I made this recipe without sour cream and added mushrooms to the sauce. Also went slightly heavier on the Parmesan and added parsley flakes for aesthetics.

This was really tasty and so easy.  I was skeptical at first as I have never made Ziti without ricotta cheese, but this came out great and I didn't miss it at all.  I made 2 batches, one with the meat and one without as I was hosting a few that do not like meat and both versions got great reviews.  Will make again.

Great Baked ziti. I changed the layering and saved a small amount of sauce for over the top layer of cheese. Also added some chopped garlic. Everything needs garlic.

I loved this recipe! I did as others did and substituted ricotta cheese for sour cream. It turned out wonderful! I would however, add way less cheese! Just came out in globs! But easily forked to the side. ;) thanks!!

My hubby loved it !!! I added diced peppers, onion and crushed garlic. Add as much as you like. Oh and I also added mushrooms, canned or fresh. I also used different kinds of cheeses, such as Kraft grated varieties, add a little chili flakes for a little  heat.

I made this for a dinner party, and everyone grabbed seconds! If you're not a huge sour cream fan like me, try using an equal amount of cottage cheese. I did the second time and liked it even more. Happy eating!

This was easy, but bland and boring. I suppose it would be all right at a potluck or something where there are other items to choose from, but for myself I'd like something with a bit more flavor.

This was delicious! But I read in some of the comments to make with ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and basil leaves, it was delicious! Also I read to bake it covered, which I did and it didn't dry up at all! New family dinner added to the list!

I don't think you can get provolone cheese in the uk, I did look everywhere but in the end I substituted German smoked cheese. It was so delicious that we all had seconds and are looking forward to having it again tonight!! Yummy :-)

This is delicious. The only thing I modified was reducing the sour cream. Otherwise this is fantastic.

Edit: Years later, I have completely replaced the sour cream with ricotta/egg mix. That seems to complement it well as opposed to how sour cream is on the "sweeter" side of the spectrum.

The flavors were pretty good, we ended up adding a mix of Italian spices to punch up the flavor a bit and ended up using more cheese (because, well, there's never enough cheese!). 
Overall, although this was good, it wasn't the ziti I was looking for and will continue the search.

Very tasty and very easy.  I thought it would taste too much like lasagna, but I think the addition of the sour cream gave it it's own unique taste, not to mention all the different cheeses.  All of my teenage/adult children really enjoyed it.  A few notes:  This makes a lot so you may want to put something under the dish while cooking, as it bubbles over while cooking.  Definitely cover with foil to keep from drying out.  Depending on your oven bake time may be more like 35-40 minutes to heat thoroughly.  Will definitely make again-Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the idea and it probably could've been good, but the sour cream overwhelmed everything. Will try ricotta if I ever bother again.

If you are tired and have a family to feed, this is a great recipe.  Really good, really cheap and super easy.  Mods:  I added two cloves of garlic and sautéed it with the onions, basil and oregano in butter.  Left the provolone out and subbed shaved parmesan.  My girlfriend and I split the recipe in half and had more than enough for dinner for two nights.

EVERYONE in my family loved this recipe, even a family member who said that she usually hates baked ziti! It is like lasagna, but so so so much easier! The sour cream/provolone combination was excellent! Just a perfect recipe!

I cook all the time and this is the MOST REQUESTED recipe I've ever made. Never found a single person that didn't LOVE it, and they don't know why. It's the secret ingredients--sour cream and provolone--that make a world of difference. I've made it meatless, with ground sausage and ground beef, and sausage is our favorite but it's very rich. Just be sure to cover the noodles with sauce so the top ones don't get crunchy, and cover the whole thing with foil. I've cooked it twice as long by accident and it was still fine. Enjoy...everyone else will!

Oh my goodness - this made my kitchen smell like a restaurant!  I followed the recipe exactly, but perhaps I got a bit heavy handed with the cheese *wink*.  Parchment paper is my favorite kitchen accessory, and it worked beautifully for this recipe.  It made a huge amount, so we will be in leftovers for a week.  Thank you for sharing!

It was good.  I substituted lasagna noodles instead of ziti.  I also mixed together the mozzarella cheese with the sour cream and some seasonings.

I used traditional and garlic&herb spaghetti sauces and ricotta cheese along with an Italian Blend cheese and this turned out AMAZING. It was easy to make and cheap, too. This recipe can very easily be tweaked to make it your own, and your family is sure to love it.

My family loves this recipe! Only thing I change is: in a large bowl, I combine the noodle with 1 Tb dried parsley flakes, 1 t dried oregano leaves, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 t salt, 1/4 t black pepper. Gives it a great Italian aroma and taste!

I have never used canned/bottled sauce so mine was made with homemade sauce and all the cheeses in the recipe. So I gave it 2 stars for the cheeses selected.

I made this earlier this week for my son's 9th bday family get together. I was in a hurry and choose this last min and it still came out amazing. My plan was to double the recipe but it didn't work out that way. I put a layer of just sauce at the bottom of the pan then did the 1/2 the pasta. Next later was 1/2 the sauce/meat mixture which I did 2 and 1/2 jars of sauce instead of just 2 jars. Next layer was 6 slices of provolone cheese and 1/2 of the sour cream followed by the other half of pasta, 2cups of mozzarella cheese, and the last 1/2 of the sauce mixture. I used another 2 cups of shredded cheese on top. Baked it for an hr and everyone loved it. It was moist and cheesy. It fed 9 ppl and had enough left over for the 3 kids to eat it again the next day.

Very forgiving recipe! I halved it, and it fit perfectly in my 9x13 casserole dish. I used turkey meat and about half the sour cream and cheeses. Baked it covered for 30 minutes and it certainly did not taste like a light or healthier version.

Not only did I love this recipe, but my husband and mother-in-law did, too! I'm a terrible cook, and cannot think outside the box, usually. But as I did not have provolone cheese, I used just mixed cheddar jack and cheddar, and then sprinkled parmesan on top. I made too much ziti; I cooked it in our toaster oven and it takes only a small casserole dish (one of those rectangular ones). But it came out great (uncovered), and very meaty and cheesy. The sour cream really made it. BEST OF ALL, it was simple, and I could do it. I did it! And they loved it! This is an A+ recipe, and I will make it again and again.

Made this for game day (go niners) and it was delicious. I thought it  needed a little salt, but others didn't so it's best to make it as the recipe is written and let those that want salt to salt their portion only.  I've never seen a baked ziti recipe with provolone, but now this is the only recipe I'll make.  My Niners didn't win today for another trip to the Super Bowl, but this dish was definitely a winner.

Loved it. Here is what I modified: I added 4 large garlic cloves & a Tbs Italian seasoning to the meat (hot italian sausage) and onion. When the meat was cooked, I added one can sauce and let that simmer for maybe 20 min. While it simmered, I mixed an egg with a mixture of 3/4 lb ricotta & the remaining lb sour cream and about 3 heaping cups of chopped baby spinach to up the fiber content. I cooked the noodles (rigatoni) to al dente. To the noodles I added the other can sauce: stirred not shaken hehe! So here is how I did my layers and I filled a 9x13 pan and a smaller rectangular pan, not sure on the size, sorry. In the big pan, Half the.pasta/sauce mixture, half the ricotta mixture, half the sausage mixture, shredded mozzarella/Monterey jack cheese and a sprinkle of parmesan. I then filled my smaller dish to match. Viola! Super amazing.

We made this last night and we made a couple changes. Instead of the ground beef, we used Jimmy Dean sage sausage. We also added a bit of Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the spaghetti sauce. It was a HUGE hit! 
This will definitely go in the recipe box as a family favorite.

Awesome! My family loves this recipe. I add some minced garlic and italian seasoning, as well as replacing the sour cream with ricotta.

The quality of this recipe is highly dependent on the sauce that you use.  I found it to be a little bland with store-bought sauce.  It is a five-star recipe if you use John Chandler's World's Best Pasta Sauce recipe in place of the spaghetti sauce, ground beef, and onion.  It takes a bit of extra time to make the sauce from scratch but it is worth it.

I have fixed this recipe several times just as directed and have been very pleased.  I did add something this time that was really excellent.  Just added a 10 oz. Package of thawed, drained spinach and about 2 more oz. Spaghetti sauce to the meat sauce mixture. Wonderful! Great way to sneak the healthy stuff into our family favorite!

My sister in law makes this strictly by the suggested recipe and it turns out great!  I've tried twice, and it doesn't come out as great as hers, but I like it.  I tried the suggestions of mixing in more sauce in between the noodles, but I think that's why I don't like mine as much.  I find it too saucy that way.  I think the original recipe is much better.  I will stick to it next time and see how it turns out on my own.  Any yes, this recipe makes A lot! Make sure your dish is big enough :)

Yummy yummy yummy good for your tummy! Excellent recipe made it in about an hour. Didn't use butter to grease my pan, pasta sauce and butter just didn't appeal as a harmonious combination. I used olive oil instead. Next time I will used ricotta instead of sour cream with a pinch or two of nutmeg. Try it, you'll love it! Didn't need to cover it for it to cook to perfection.

Very very good. I mixed an egg with the sour cream and some shredded parm then mixed with the noodles first. In cooked in my pampered chef 3 quart baker ( black one with glass top) uncovered... Was not dry at all. This is a very simple recipe that makes a good size meal, my family loves it.

As with others I made some minor changes and it was awesome! Here's what I changed:
*added chopped garlic
*added red pepper flakes
*mixed the sourcream WITH the hot noodles and shredded cheese and added an egg and mixed up (leaving some cheese for layering and top) I used a combo of shredded asiago/parmesan/romano and topped with shredded mozzarella and parmesan mix)
*layered sauce/meat mix then noodle mix then cheese then sauce then cheese to top
*baked 40 min at recipe recommended temp in a throw away aluminum lasagna pan covered with foil then removed foil for nicely browned cheese top for another ten minutes.
Turned out magnifico!

This recipe was great as is.  I halved it, and it was more than enough for 2 people. My only suggestion would be to mix a little sauce in with the noodles, and if you are only making half, cut the cook time to 20 minutes.  It was a little drier than I would have liked second go 'round, but still very good. The hubs loved it!

This is…basically the perfect recipe. Easy. Flexible. Hearty. Yummy. The more I eat the more I want. 
I made it with fusilli (spirals) so it could get in every nook and cranny. I also made according to directions except I used 1 cup sour cream and a little less marinara. I baked it 30 min UNcovered in one buttered 9x13 pyrex casserole . Both myself and my friend had 2 helpings and there was a ton left over.  About 7 meals total.  The only thing I may try next time is to add a bit of fresh minced garlic. 
By the way, it comes out tasting way better than the pictures look.  I don’t know why some of the pics looked soupy. Maybe I was right to use less marinara.
---------
Edit:
I made this a second time with a classico garlic sauce which was more chunky and it was not as good. Last time I used Classico regular marinara combined with a spicy one which was much better.

I didn't think I would like baked ziti seeing as how I'm not a fan of baked pastas  but this is pretty good. The only changes I make is instead of regular sauce I use vodka sauce & ground bison since we don't eat ground beef. Very yummy

I cover it first and bake for about 30 minutes and then remove the foil and continue to bake until it's bubbling and golden (like lasagna recipes advise). A step I figured out only after I had my husband follow the baking directions for tonight's dinner while I was at an appointment and it turned out just passable but undercooked in my opinion.   I've made it a few times and usually get compliments.  Tonight I was feeding four teenage boys and it was not as popular as it has been in the past.  I'm sure it was because it was undercooked.  (How many teenage boys have you met who don't eat seconds?)  
Overall it's a good basic ziti recipe and a crowd pleaser.  You can add what you like or make it meatless but just allow more time for baking it.

This was so very delicious.  I definitely put this recipe in my Recipe Box.  I made it meatless using a soy product instead, perfect!  Wish I had taken a picture, it was very pretty when finished.

Great recipe. Stretches a small amount of ground beef into several meals. Sour cream is much cheaper than ricotta and you can use as much as you have left in the fridge. Love how easy it was to prepare as well. 3 out of 5 family members would eat again. Our new favorite 'poor man's lasagna' if you will.

Use ricotta w egg and salt instead of sour cream.  Use 4 cheese sauce.  Add 6 oz of sausage, garlic w onions, add basil, oregano, garlic salt.

I have made this recipe "as is" many times and it is very good.  In my opinion, if you add a couple cloves of minced garlic to the meat while cooking it enhances the flavor.  Also, I have read many reviews on this, so, after cooking the sauce and the ziti, I mixed them together before assembling it.  It turned out awesome!!  Creamy and delicious!

This is the best baked ziti recipe. I was skeptical about sour cream/provolone, but it was gooey yummy. Please make as the recipe is designed. You won't be disappointed. Great leftovers.

I was leery making this recipe with sour cream instead of ricotta cheese, but I forged ahead and did it anyway.  My teenagers and husband said it was only okay as they found it bitter.  I made it the next time using ricotta instead of sour cream and they loved it.  The recipe is now a keeper with that substitution.  While I personally didn't dislike it with the sour cream I do have to agree with them that using ricotta instead makes it excellent.

WOW! I was feeling like trying something a little different and found this recipe. Followed the recipe to the letter and OH my gosh is this good! It's a handy thing that the recipe fills a large pan because the family would otherwise fight over leftovers! Perfect for a mid-week dinner in the fall and winter. Kids would have plenty to do if they wanted to help next time. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

I love this recipe! Everyone is always impressed and comes back for seconds (sometimes thirds). I know it sounds strange to use sour cream instead of ricotta cheese, but before you tweak this recipe, I urge you to give it a try as it stands. You won't be disappointed.

I've made this dish following the recipe exactly, but I've also made it with ground turkey, vegetarian ground "beef," as well as a combination of ground turkey and ground beef. It comes out excellent every single time.

Good recipe. We made it with ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. Will probably add more cheese and omit the onions next time. Still a good, easy make!

I fixed for a family & friend game night and everyone raved about it.  I think the sour cream really makes the recipe.  I fixed it exactly as directed and I wasn't disappointed.  I served it with homemade bread and salad.  Yummy!

This was amazing! The first time I've ever made ziti and you would have thought I was a pro at it. I did everything within the recipe I just layered differently also I added a small amount of ketchup and sugar which took away the tartness of the sauce. Great recipe!!!! ??????

I tried this out a second time, sprayed the pan with Pam, cut the pasta in half and used 2 large jars of spaghetti sauce; two cups of sour cream. Cooked at 350 in 9x9 pan for almost an hour covered;  added mozzarella last 5 minutes.  Also combined pasta with sauce before layering so the noodles would soak up some of the sauce, and man this was great!  Found we like more sauce, meat, sour cream in ours!

I found this recipe years ago and it quickly became a recurring favorite. I am not a big fan of ricotta cheese so the sour cream and provolone were a nice change. The order of layering can affect the taste so try different orders to find the one you like best. I typically add garlic with when browning the beef and onion. This recipe will fill a 9x13 dish to the brim! So, be careful when layering. I have made this for groups of people as well as for just the family and it is always a hit. Great to have as leftovers.

This recipe is just ok when, it's needs some changes.  Using jars of spaghetti sauce and ground beef ends up making a very bland meat sauce, making a homemade meat sauce with italian sausage would be much better.  We were also not a fan of the sour cream.  I don't think using ricotta cheese would make this dry like some have stated.    Garlic should be added instead of just onion.  Lots of room for improvement in this one.

I don't think everyone, especially a beginning cook for example, is gonna know if something should be baked covered or not. I think its kinda mean to imply they ought to know. And yeah, recipes do need to specify such things. This recipe needs ricotta  -  I may try again with ricotta and fresh garlic.

This Ziti is fantastic!!  My family loves it more than lasagna or pizza. I mix a half a cup of grated Parmesan with the sour cream, it's easier to spread and adds more cheesy flavor.

This is a big hit! It made a full 13x9 dish, as well as a no melted cheese option for my son in a small pie plate. I actually had to make a few adjustments so what makes this excellent is that it is versatile. I put about 1 c cottage cheese in the magic bullet and made a cream sauce, which I used in place of provolone cheese. I used ground turkey, and no parmesan cheese. It was so yummy... I will even make it for the students in the preschool! Thanks.

I made this recipe as written except instead of using store bought spaghetti sauce, I used my own homemade turkey spaghetti sauce and it is one of the BEST pasta dishes I have made. Everyone I served this dish to raved about how good it is. Thank you Ms. Smith for a delightful meal. I wish it was possible to give it 10 big ones.

I've made baked ziti many times before but not with sour cream.  This was so delicious and moist.  The flavor was wonderful.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This is my go-to ziti recipe because it is so quick and easy!  I used more mozzarella cheese in place of the provolone.  I usually never have it on hand.  I bake it in a 9x11 glass pan uncovered for 40-50 minutes.  It's delicious and sometimes I even make two or three pans to freeze for busy/lazy days.

Delicious.  Next time I think I will substitue the Sour Cream for some Ricotta cheese.  Very simple to make; everyone loved it (even my picky 11 year old).

I was surprised how good it was considering it didn't have ricotta cheese in it. It's super filling as well.

I love this! My husband really does not like ricotta or cottage cheese, so this is perfect!  I use more cheese than the recipe calls for (of course).  I also use 1 jar of spaghetti sauce with sausage and 1 without.  The sausage adds a little something extra.  So glad I found this recipe!

I have made this recipe twice in the last three weeks. It isn't everyday I find a recipe the whole family loves. Definitely add some sauce to the bottom layer of noodles. I add garlic and oregano to the sauce, also store didn't have ziti so I used rigatoni-worked fine. Delicious!

As is, it is four stars. BUT with suggestions from other reviewers to substitute with Ricotta and egg- it is a keeper worth 5 stars!

Crazy good!  Easy to prepare and save for later.  I made it ahead and baked it off a couple of days later.  Did not bake with the cover on and it was fine.  I probably put a bit more parmesan on the top - got a nice brown color and stayed really creamy on the inside.  Highly recommend and will definitely make this again.

If I could, I would rename this recipe to "Weeknight Lasagne"!   It was a deliciously simple version of a normally very time consuming recipe.   I'm Italian, and my lasagne is a labor of love which starts with making my own sauce.   When I saw this recipe, I knew I had sauce in the freezer and decided to give it a go.   SO glad I did.   I was skeptical of the provolone/sour cream situation, but I think I prefer this now over the traditional ricotta mix I put together.   It binds up better and everyone loved it here.   Instead of the ground beef + onion, I just cooked up a pound of mild italian sausage for my meat.   Everything else was done per the recipe exactly.      I did a half recipe based on the volume and it was perfect for a family of 4 plus some leftovers for the next day.    This one is a KEEPER!

It was easy-the hardest part was chopping onions- and it was delicious - everyone in the family ate their serving.  As for covering it, i didn't because i was merely melting cheese.  No need to cover.

I don't understand why this is so good, but it is.  I was honestly weirded out by the sour cream thing, but followed it anyway given the reviews.... SO delicious.  WHAT is the story?  The only differences I made were halving the sauce, not adding in meat or onions, and using a cheese blend on top (because that's what I had in the house).  I cannot wait to eat the leftovers!

I used a little more sour cream, tri colored penne, cooked chicken pieces instead of ground beef and a mixed blend of Italian cheeses instead of  mozzarella and it was amazing! It was even great as leftovers.

YUMMY!
Made this for a pot luck and everyone loved it. Nothing left over.
Lots of flavor and the sour cream gives a nice creamy/smooth texture. The only change I made was I cut the ground beef in half (just personal preference), added a little garlic, and baked it cover. I removed the cover the last 10 mins so it could brown on top. I actually served it in a crock pot so it would stay warm during our party and it kept wonderful.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe. I made a homemade sauce because I didn't have any jars of spaghetti sauce. I also had to use penne pasta because I didn't have any ziti.  I covered my pan with aluminum foil. After 20 minutes, I checked the ziti. I then browned a bit under the broiler around 2 minutes. I do think the sauce can make or break any pasta recipe. So be sure to use a sauce you like.

This recipe is easy simple and delicious.  I made it just like the recipe called for, changing nothing.  It came out perfectly.  I did cover the dish like others have recommended.  Things don't always have to be complex to be delicious.  This is a great example of that.

My family enjoyed this dish very much! After reading many of the reviews, I used an 11x15 baking dish and it was full. I did place a layer of meat sauce mixture to the bottom of the dish first, then ziti, then more sauce mixture then the sour cream. I added an egg and about 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese with the sour cream before spreading. Then I placed the layer of provolone cheese,remaining ziti over that, rest of the sauce and topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. I also added fresh cut mushrooms and Italian seasoning to the sauce. I baked this covered for 30 minutes and then an extra 15 minutes uncovered in a 350 degree preheated oven. It was a big hit the little leftovers we had tasted just as good if not better the next day! The provolone and sour cream made this extra tasty...do not skip this!!

I made this exactly as described. The sour cream added a great contrast to the meat and tomato flavor. This made a lot of pasta. The pasta was a heaping mound that nearly overflowed over my 9x13 dish. I will make this again. Oh, and I only had a cup of sour cream and it was still very distinctive in this dish. Long live the Republic!

This is incredible! I would put it up against any Italian restaurant's ziti. I am not very handy in the kitchen, but this turned out to be perfection! I would suggest it to anyone.

This was heavenly!  I debated whether to use sour cream or ricotta, but went with the sour cream.  Fantastic!
Do not substitute.  It gave the dish just the right hint of a tang.  Lighter than ricotta.  I make my own sauce, so did not use jar sauce. This is a new favorite.  Great for company, too.  (yes, bake it covered, but remove foil last few minutes to brown the top.)  Forgot to mention we are gluten free, so I used Schar's gf penne.  Worked like a charm.  No one could tell any difference.

This is very good!  I have been making this for the past couple years and it is always a hit.  The only suggestion I have is I do add garlic to the meat when cooking.

i got a strong batch of provolone that didn't work with this recipe well and made me wary the next time i made it.  I decided to try swiss cheese instead of provolone and it was awesome.

I'm giving this recipe five stars for the simple fact that its one of the few recipes my husband raves over. He absolutely loves this dish, and if you had any idea of how much of a picky eater it is (like legitimately, he's nearly impossible to please with food) you would understand what a godsend this recipe is for my family (and my peace of mind). I must say that personally I found it a little bland, but that could be the sauce I used. I'll try to tweak it subtly to match both of our tastes.

Trust me people!!! Do NOT sub out the sour cream!! The sour cream is the best part!! I even add a little extra. I also make mine without meat and it is so yummy!! People beg me to make this for them!! They have no idea that it's so easy and almost the very first recipe when searching "baked ziti" on google. Lol!!

made for my son's high school soccer team dinner and it was an absolute hit! I doubled the recipe and come home with an empty dish- they came back for seconds and thirds! only changes I made were: 1- meatless, 2- sprayed baking dish with pam, 3-cooked pasta and poured in sauce to combine before filling baking dish (just because it seemed easier for me). 

this recipe is in my dinner rotation!

Oh my goodness! This is delicious! It was very easy to make. I followed others suggestions and put a thin layer of sauce on bottom of pan eliminating the need to butter the dish, then noodles, cheese, sour cream, etc. The sauce on the bottom was plenty to blend with the bottom layer of noodles and the cheese melted through the top of the bottom layer of noodles. Sooo good!

This recipe was delicious! My husband LOVED it! However, you might want to consider halving the recipe if you are cooking for two as it makes up enough for an army--the ingredients totally fill up the 9X13 dish. Also, I baked mind loosely covered for most of the baking time and it turned out perfect! This went in my recipe collection for sure! :)

My family liked this dish. It does make a large amount though - enough for probably about 8 people - and a little goes a long way. I will try to freeze the leftovers, since some have said that it freezes well. 
I subbed in ricotta for the sour cream, omitted the provolone and used a bit more mozz, and added a chopped tomato to the sauce (to give it a bit more 'body'). 
I used Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of beef - and would also like to try it with spinach. 
I believe that sauce brand probably makes a difference in the outcome. (I used Newman's Tomato/Basil). Also, as with lasagna, it helps to let it cool for about 20 min. before serving - otherwise it could be 'watery'.

I have made this several times now and I have to say this is the best base recipe ever!  The sour cream adds a creamy texture that ricotta doesn't and I really think this is what makes the dish.  Just like others, I tend to make things my own and I also add, 1lb ground italian sausage, garlic and use my own homemade sauce.

This is the exact recipe that was given to me from a co-worker, who's daughter made it and RAVED. I've made it a handful of times and absolutely love it! I'm not a big onion fan, so I leave those out and just add onion powder to the meat (along with some salt, pepper and fresh garlic). Otherwise I followed the recipe to a 'T' and it turns out perfect every time. It's very easy and not too time-consuming, which is a big seller for me.

Made it as instructed with directed ingredients.  GREAT flavor.  You can change it up by what spaghetti sauce you choose.  We make this regularly and add mushrooms and some other seasonings (Italian seasoning, oregano, parsley)

Believe the reviews. My entire family said it was outstanding. The only change I made was to mix some sauce with the ziti first, and I also put in less cheese because my hubby prefers it that way. Next time I'll do half the tray with the correct amount for me:)

Hello folks,I have been watching the sopranos and I have been drooling over their food, so I tried this hoping it would work. I followed almost exactly, but took a couple suggestions, added minced garlic and used mild turkey sausage becuz I don't eat pork. I should've listened when they said it made wayyyy too much! For some reason my finished result wasn't pretty, but it came out amazing! My bf is the type of person that smells everything and is such a picky eater it urks me, he loved it! Oh yeah, I added chunks of real mozz like another reader told me to,make sure you use the sauce required and maybe more, it will dry out, and cover!! other than that it was frkn amazing! Thank you for adding this, OH AND IT LOOKED NOTHING LIKE CARMELLAS!

I'm not kidding, this is amazing. I use Marinara sauce and that's the only "change" I make. I never have leftovers.

Made as directed with the exception of using a homemade vegetable spagetti sauce.  Loved the sour cream and provolone.

YUM! This recipe made my day! It was super quick and easy to make. I definitely took other people's advice and baked it covered - which ensured it's juiciness. I also added a dash of Italian seasoning, crushed black pepper, crushed red chilies and 3 cloves of fresh garlic to the meat and onions while sautéing.   I also sprinkled fresh chopped basil on each layer, which gave the pasta a rich and irresistible aroma. Without these extra touches, I think it would've been a little bland for my taste and dry (hence 4 stars not 5).

What I loved about it was the sour cream and the provolone melted together - such a creative way of adding lingering creamy/cheesy flavour. This was an awesome dish, I will definitely be making it again in the near future.

Thanks for sharing!!

By following "LP" tips this dish came out delicious! (it's the first comment under Most Helpful).
I made it vegetarian, by adding Boca Crumbles instead of beef. No one noticed the difference!

I thought this was awesome. Loved the sour cream change.  It was excellent!  I did add hot italian sausage, red and green peppers, and mushrooms.

Make sure you find a good sauce and let it simmer with the meat and onions a little longer. Also, proper baking dish is key...after layering I could barely fit the lid on my baking dish.

This is the best baked ziti i've ever had. It was even better the next day. I used italian sausage instead of beef and I followed some guidance and mixed the pasta with the sour cream and the noodles came out perfectly moist and tender. I also changed the layering (noodles, sauce then cheese). Perfecto!

This is my go-to recipe for an easy make-ahead company meal and a meal to take to others.  This meal converted a pasta-hater (I know what?!) to a pasta-eater!  I usually use sausage instead of ground beef, and I have done zuccini as well.

My family insisted that I diversify our weekly menu, so I decided to give this recipe a try. It was really easy to make and a real hit with the family. I made a few tweaks after reading the other reviews, like mixing the pasta with the sour cream before layering to keep moist and using Italian sausage pasta sauce but that was it. I also think I may add a few peppers in it next time for a little kick.

This was an awesome recipe.  I usually am not a fan of baked ziti simply because it is usually dry.  I did not find that in this case. The only thing I changed, from noticing in another review, is that I mixed the sour cream with the noodles.  I find that doing that it was not so messy and kept the noodles moist.  I can't wait to make this recipe for some friends.

Love this recipe!  This was my first time making ziti, and it turned out great.  Everyone went back for seconds...and thirds!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I sauteed some garlic with the sauce, added a little extra meat and then put a really thin layer of the sauce below the first layer of ziti.  This is a new favorite, and I will be making this often.

To tell the truth I haven't even tried it yet, but I had to write a review now.  Both my son and my husband love it and have asked for seconds already!  They both said it was good and my son said it's even better than his school that makes it.  I am so very happy about their reactions.  I used all the ingredients as above, the only difference I made was the layering proccess. I first put down a layer of sauce and then ziti and then the cheese and sour cream.  I covered with aluminum foil before putting it in the oven for 30 minutes @ 350.  It came out very moist and not dry in the least.  Experiment and enjoy!

I was surprised at the sour cream, but it turned out really well!  My only complaint with this recipe is that it ended up watery on the bottom--not sure why.  Still a tasty recipe; I'll definitely make again.

This recipe always gets rave reviews. Its my favorite thing to bring to a party or any gathering. I sometimes use italian sausage instead of ground beef, I like it both ways. I do have a question though. 

Any tips/suggestions for freezing this? Reheating after frozen?

First let me just say I am not a big Italian/pasta person but my husband loves it so I decided to try this tonight - mostly because I was looking for something I could make without having to go to the store.  This was AWESOME!  I followed the recipie exactly with just a couple of exceptions:  I layered the sauce before the cheese as recommended by the other reviewers and I covered the dish while it was baking. I uncovered it the last ten minutes so the cheese would brown.  I also cooked it in a deep dish casserole dish - this made enough for all four of us big eaters to have two plates full plus we have enough for dinner tommorrow!  The sour cream was excellent - I dont like the texture of rigotta cheese so I loved using this instead.  Definately a keeper.

I slightly misread the recipe and thought there would be another layer, so I ended up only adding half the amount of sour cream and provolone. Used crumbled sausage in place of hamburger, just my preference. I did not put any mozzarella on top initially; I covered it and baked for 30 minutes. Then I uncovered it, added a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and parmesan, and cooked for 10 additional minutes. I came out perfectly delicious. Don't be concerned about the sour cream-it just blends with the ingredients nicely. Great recipe!

My family loves this recipe! None of them like ricotta so this is perfect. It’s easy to put together and makes enough for my family of 5 to get dinner and a couple of lunches out of it easily.

This was the best ziti recipe I've ever come across!!!  I used hot Italian sausage and added minced garlic, ground pepper,spinach,Italian seasoning and topped it with a 3-Italian cheese finely shredded mix.  Perfection!!!!

VERY good! I highly recommend adding the sour cream to the base layer of noodles. Much easier (thanks for the tip!). I will make this again and again...

My DD LOVES THIS!! Super easy and oh so comforting! Very yummy, tastes even better the next day! The only thing I did different was use Mexican cheese instead of Jack since that was what I had on hand. Great recipe!! Thanks Colleen for making dinner time more memorable:):)

This was excellent! I was worried about the sour cream and lack of ricotta but it was great. I did add some Italian seasoning and garlic to the sauce mix, just personal preference. Thanks! Oh, also - we'e vegetarian so we subbed "fake" meat for the ground beef. Nobody notices the difference.

Made it tonight. Was awesome! Had to tweak based on what I had on hand. I didn't have jars of pasta sauce- had to kinda make it from scratch. 2 small cans of sauce, 2 cans of tomato paste, 1 can of spicy tomatoes(like Rotel) and two large tomatoes that were getting soft(i like firm tomatoes). I didn't have any provolone or Parmesan cheese, so I used what I had on hand - mozzarella sticks, shredded mozzarella, and 5 slices of cheddar(for the top). The finished product had a little bite to it, but it tasted like real Italian food - spicy and savory. Mixed with the ground beef was several spices; dry minced onions and garlic(yum), Mrs Dash, and parsley - while cooking. I think it turned out wonderful and I would definitely make this again!!! Very yummy and tasted awesome night one - can't wait to taste it after it sits for a day!

I'm not a huge pasta fan, but I made this when I was in a pinch and it came out pretty good. I didn't have provolone cheese, so I just used extra Parmesan cheese in it's place.

This turned out great, I loved it and my family ate it up pretty well too.  I didn't realize, until it was too late, I didn't have as much sour cream as I'd thought.  Instead of sour cream I used what I had left (I think like 1/2 cup and the rest I used cottage cheese.  Turned out okay even still, it was probably just a little less tangy.  I like the mix of different cheeses too.

I made this ziti as directed in the recipe, adding only a little Italian seasoning to the top.  My husband loved it and my son said it tasted like his  favorite supper I used to make when he was a child.  The two grand kids had clean plates.  A total success.

Simply awesome.  The only thing I added was some slices of cooked Italian sausage.  Other than that I layered differently: ziti then sauce, meat cheese, sour teem. I mixed the sauce into the ziti before adding other layers.  My family demolished this, no leftovers! Great with a salad and wine :-)

Tried this recipe when I got asked to host a party and only had 36 hours notice.  It was really good.  I used italian sauage instead of ground beef and used Classico Italian Sauage and Peppers sauce.  Baked it covered.  Everyone loved it!

Whole family loves this.  We freeze the leftovers for a throw down when we make something the kids don't eat (like fish)

Great recipe. I use ricotta cheese instead of the sour cream.  Also be sure to cover the dish when cooking.  I also use 1/2 pound ground meat and 1/2 pound ground veal

Great ziti recipe. Served at a dinner party and it was a big hit. As others have noted, this will more than fill your baking dish. 16oz of noodles is a couple of ounces too much.

This was really good and easy.  It was almost like lasagna.  I know we shouldn't tweak, but I used frozen Schwans Meatballs for the meat since my daughter who hates hamburger can pick them out easier than ground beef and everyone is happy.  I also mixed a little sauce with ziti while layering and put a thin layer of sauce on bottom of pan first and didn't grease.

I love this recipe.  At first I thought I would miss the ricotta cheese but the sour cream is a great substitute. It serves a small army so I always halve the recipe for my family and bake in a 8x8 dish and it's perfect. I use sweet bulk Italian sausage instead of ground beef, light sour cream, and sliced mozzarella instead of shredded since I'm already at the deli buying the sliced provolone.  I also don't measure the parmesan cheese...just grate until I can't see the sauce anymore.  We love our parmesan cheese.

Just Made this last night. My family LOVED this!! I followed the recipe and it was great. I noticed a lot of people said it was a lot of food, however I feed a husband and three kids so It was just enough left for him take some to work the next day. I was hesitant to you use the provolone  sour cream method instead of ricotta. However after reading a review by another user I went with it and it tasted amazing!! Great Recipe will be a staple at my house!!

Wow I was quite impressed with myself.
Wanted a change from the usual lasagna, I was a little hesitant using sour cream, but sure am glad i did.

The only changes i made was using penne pasta, and no ground beef but hot italian sausage.

Very good.  I would follow CHINDERS comments about putting the sauce on top of the bottom layer of noodles.  Adding some garlic to the meat and some italian sausage worked great too. I also cooked mine longer.

I've made this several times and it is ALWAYS a huge hit! I've had people that don't tell like typical bake ziti tell me how good it is. Love it! The only thing I change occasionally is that I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am rating this 3 stars because after I started the layering process I found the dish size to be WRONG!  I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't spread the sour cream evenly. I also didn't care for the fresh basil sprinkled on top.  It just shriveled up and got ugly, it would look better under the cheese? :)  The flavor was good however, I would mix the sour cream with the noodles and then layer if I make it again.

Easy meal with great flavor.  The only thing I did differently was add extra mozzarella cheese on top (skipped the Parmesan) and then added some pepperoni to the sauce.  My company loved it!

FANTASTIC!  Don't change a thing!  Great flavor and super easy -- great family meal.  I am Italian and I made this for my extended family and it was a big hit.  Even the kids ALL loved it.  It is definitely not your traditional baked ziti -- but it's not supposed to be!   I substituted rigatoni and use a little less sauce, but otherwise, delicious!

This is my go-to ziti recipe. I may try the ricotta cheese recommendation one day, but I have had baked ziti with ricotta my whole life and find this a bit more tasty. I make my own sauce.

I have been making this recipe for years and ALWAYS get rave reviews. You have to use a good sauce. I am stuck on Emeril's homestyle marinara. I use 3 jars and about 1.5 lbs of ground meat. I let it simmer for about 2 hours so that the meat gets nice and soft. Everything else I follow exactly. The key is to make sure you have plenty of sauce then it will not dry out. And no...you do not need to cover it.

I was looking for something different in a pasta casserole and came across this recipe.  I tried it for dinner and what a hit it was!!!!  Easy, quick, and really tasty.  I served it with garlic bread and a green salad.  My family loved it so much that they devoured it that same night and we were only 3 people!  AND they asked me to make it again right away.  I followed the directions exactly except for one change.  I mixed the meat sauce with the pasta first and then layered the pasta, sour cream and cheese, ending with shredded Parmesan mixed with mozzarella on top.  Baked it for 45 minutes until the top was brown.  Wonderful!

I substituted a bag of grated Italian cheese for the provolone and mozzarella cheeses, and flavored a combination of ground beef and turkey with the "homemade sweet Italian sausage" receipe on this site.  This turned out really good and the sour cream made it really special.

This is a great easy, inexpensive meal that feeds a bunch of people!!!!  I did take the suggestion of mixing sauce with the pasta on the bottom layer and I didn't have the provolone cheese so I used shredded monterey jack. My family loved it! And its better then next day for leftovers!

So delicious!!! One of my and my husbands favorites and its so easy. The only thing i did different the second time is I mixed the pasta in with sauce mixture before I layered everything to even out the sauce to noodle ratio. Other than that its awesome the way it is! Try it!

This recipe is awesome and I love it and everyone I cook it for loves it too.  I did mix the noodles and sauce together before I started layering. I also have used turkey sausage and ground meat and any way I make it, it turns out great!  Thanks for giving me a recipe I can add to or layer any way I like and still get a great dish.

Wonderful.  Made as directed except I did substitute ricotta for the sour cream.  Hubby and I both went back for seconds and wish we had room for thirds!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I added some garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. My son loved it, but my somewhat finicky husband and daughters ate around the sour cream(I led them to believe it was cheese...) I think I'll try te ricotta suggested by others next time to see if we can kick it up to five stars but either way, thanks for a keeper!!!

I made this recipe with a twist instead of using ground meat I used chicken breast and I added I can of dark kidney beans I cooked them with brown sugar before adding to the rest of the ingredients and I also added a bag of spinach I cooked it first with a table spoon of margarine and some garlic powder then I followed rest of the recipe My kids love this recipe it's a great way to sneak in vegetables and beans in their diet :-)

Great recipe! I have made this a handful of times using "light" cheeses and sour cream as well as whole wheat pasta. It makes a pretty full pan; always leftovers. I have also made it ahead and put it in the freezer for later.

Very tasty, cheesy! I think next time I make it I'll reduce the amount of sour cream, other than that, very good.

After making this I found it to be a great base recipe for baked ziti. However I noticed that at no time are spices added, nor do you drain the ground beef. Next time I will finely chop 2 cloves of garlic and add in with the onion and beef to cook, and toss in at least 2-4 Tbls of Italian seasoning. All so it may be easier after frying the beef to place in a wide pot to simmer with the sauce. Even a large frying pan gets a little crowded with this one.

I decreased the cooking time for the ziti to eliminate the likelihood of the pasta soaking up too much sauce, added more sauce (about 12 oz), and added some bread crumbs on top.  Oh, yes - also used Italian sausage instead of the ground beef...VERY tasty!

Really delicious.  A friend made this for us and the whole family loved it.  me and the kids (ages 3 and 1) at it for days.  Definitely will make!  She says she made the following alterations: added a layer of fresh basil and used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb italian sausage.  So good.

Not very good. Maybe it was the sour cream. I liked the provolone. I would not make this again.

I've made this dozens of times and it is always a hit! Sometimes I replace the meet with carrots and zucchini for a veggie version and other times I've added them into the meat to sneak in a veggie. Delicious no matter what. This is one of my tried and true need to feed a group recipes because it makes a lot and it isn't horribly expensive to put together. Also, it doesn't have ricotta so it seems to be better received by a wide variety of people.

My husband adores this recipe!  We use Italian seasoned ground turkey and low fat sour cream and cheese and it tasted great.  He would be happy if I made this once a week.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I especially liked the addition of the sour cream to the recipe.  I added a can of sliced mushrooms and used tomato basil pasta sauce with a can of diced tomatoes.  So simple and easy and yummy. Thank you!

LOVE this recipe. I was nervous about the sour cream, but it works PERFECTLY!!Only changes I made are when I cook the meat and mix the sauce, I also add crushed red pepper, about 1 tbspn, since I love spicy! I also just buy one of the pre packaged sliced provolone, so it comes about 10 or 12 to a pack, and make it super cheesy. Its enough left overs for a week, and its delicious!

I loved this recipe! I added a clove of garlic, rosemary, and a can of tomato chicks to my sauce. I also saw a previous comment about using a ziplock as a pastry bag for the sour cream, it was an awesome idea!! The next time I will either add and 1/2 lb more beef or ground sausage.

Made this last night and we loved it! I followed the recipe as written with only a couple exceptions: I changed the layering slightly and poured 1/2 the sauce directly on the first layer of noodles, I used 1 cup sour cream instead of 1 1/2, and I covered it while baking.  It does make a LOT and it's very filling.  I served it with salad, green beans, and garlic bread.  Definitely will be making this again!

I made this for a get together and everyone absolutely loved it! I used fresh mozzarella and sauteed the meat with one minced garlic clove in addition to the onion. I also baked it uncovered and it came out perfect. Not dry at all, cheese melted perfectly and very delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

I don't usually write reviews but this was so good, I just had to. I used 1/2 italian seasoned turkey and 1/2 italian sausage. I  also mixed the sauce and noodles together before layering. Big hit with the family.

This is the BEST ziti I have ever had / made. I only made minor adjustments. I added minced garlic to the meat and onion mixture. I also pre-mixed the sour cream, parmesan cheese and mozzerella and then mixed it with the noodles. I layered half the noodle mixture first, then half the sauce and then put the sliced provolone, then the rest of the noodles and then the rest of the sauce. I also have only made ziti with ricotta in the past and I have to say I definately prefer this recipe. This one is going into my box and will be making again!

Followed the recipe to the "t". It was awesome. You must cover the pan while baking so that it will not dry out. Will definitely add to the rotation.

My entire family loved this meal!  I browned my beef with the onion and fresh garlic.  I only used one clove but more would be fine, too.  Cover the dish as you  bake.  Since there were so many noodles, I saved enough and tossed with Italian dressing, tomato, cucumber, and bacon bits for a pasta salad for tomorrow night's supper!   This ziti recipe is a keeper!!!!

Awesome!  I normally use ricotta with a lasanga type dish but the sour cream, cheese combo is awesome!  Used others suggestion of layering cheese and then spreading sour cream on top of cheese, I'm assuming its also easier to assemble this way too!  We will be using this frequently, everyone gobbled it up.

It's good but a bit runny with sour cream. So the second time I used ricotta instead. Yum.

This was AMAZING!  I have to admit, I was skeptical about sour cream in the recipe, but it works!  Both my husband and I devoured this over several days as it made excellent leftovers.  I thought I would bring some to family members to share since it made so much and is so hearty, but we were too selfish this time :)  Next time, we will invite everyone over.  I should mention that I did not use hamburger & onion, but instead swapped that with our favorite mini meatballs (size of marbles) from Graziano's in Des Moines, IA.  I used 2 jars of Gino's marinara sauce, which is a spicier flavor.  I am just not a fan of ground beef (my husband is) so this was a delicious compromise.  This is now on top of our list as one of our staple meals!  Thank you for sharing!

I could eat this all by myself throughout the week. Its amazing!! The sour cream gives it a twist and makes it better than any original recipe you may have been used to. Usually Baked Ziti or Lasagna calls for Ricotta. To me, the sour cream is way better.

One of the best Baked Ziti's I have tasted.  I added garlic and sweet sausage. Used another 1/2 a jar of sauce, 2 more oz's of provolone, and another 10 oz's of mozzarella. Used a larger baking dish. Makes a lot, but well worth it.

I used cheddar and monterrey jack cheese.  I halved the recipe and it filled a 9x13 casserole dish.  I sprayed with Pam and put all of the ziti on the bottom. I then just put spoonfuls of the sour cream over the ziti and then a layer of cheddar cheese.  I browned ground turkey, added the onions and spaghetti sauce and poured that over the top and then added the layer of monterrey jack cheese.  My family of 5 + 1 more last night all loved it.  It was super easy to make after a long day.  Thanks so much!

Fantastic!!!!   I have baked ziti before but this is the creamiest and easiest.  I always have my own sauce in the freezer so other than using that, I followed the recipe.  Adding sour cream made all the difference.

This is an excellent recipe - I've made it multiple times and it's a hit each time! My only modification is using an Italian cheese blend instead of the mozzarella and parmesan and layering it so the sauce and the noodles are next to each other. I am SO excited that I found this recipe as I was desperate for an Italian dish that didn't have ricotta cheese in it. Thanks so much!

my family didn't really think this was anything special.  It's better with traditional ricotta.  I'm going to try a different recipe that also uses cottage cheese with the sour cream.

I highly recommend this I've made it twice already and I agree it tastes much better if you use the ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and it tastes great going half italian sausage and half ground beef. Also reheats very well for left overs later in the week

EXCELLENT! I did make a couple of modifications like I cut out the onion because I dont like them and I used a little less sour cream. I also topped it with colby jack cheese when it was halfway done. My husband and kids absolutly love it.

This Ziti is delicious! I have made it several times and it is now known as one of my signature dishes! The only thing I do differently is I use only Mozzerella cheese in the middle of it. My family likes the way it melts better than provolone. :) Very easy prep and even better warmed up the next day. My husband and I had one by ourselves (kids were at camp) and it lasted for about 2 days of eating it for lunch and dinner!

I made this dish a few days ago and it was a hit with my family. As per another rate, it tastes even better the next day. I was a little sceptical about using sour cream, but to my surprise, it added a tasty flavor. Good call!! I love sausage so I added the sweet italian sausage to the meat along w/ a few good spices and 1 cup of ricotta cheese (we love cheese). It came out great and I'll be sure to make this again.

Made this last night for the family!  Absolutely delicious!  I added some minced garlic (love garlic), garlic powder, and Italian seasonings to my sauce after adding it to the hamburger and let simmer just like recipe calls for.  Sour cream gives it the right taste (great for those who do not like ricotta cheese) and so does the provolone cheese (one of our favorite cheeses).  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe, I found that adding the onions uncooked took away from the dish, though.  Next time I'll sautee them in olive oil first.  Overall, very tasty.

Wonderful recipe!  I used spaghetti sauce with ground turkey that I had in the freezer (It was probably less sauce than recommended, but it was great).  For the provolone cheese, I used 1/2 lb of sliced provolone cheese.  I increased the mozzarella cheese to 3 cups.

First time using all recipes and I LOVED this recipe. It was insanely easy and delicious! I did what most suggested and mixed some sausage and Italian seasonings in. I also added extra sauce before the cheeses,etc....did not use provolone mainly because I am just not a fan. This dish was soooo easy and sooooo good!!

I fixed this with 1/2 lb Mild Italian Sausage and 1/2 lb Ground Round and chunky spagetti sause.  Everyone loved it, a big surprise to me as before this all I every made was Tomato Sausage gravy and spagetti.

Scaled this down to feed 4 and there was still a lot for us. Used ground turkey and added spinch, corn, and green pepper. Will make again.

A friend of me gave me this recipe and my family loved it! It's easy enough to make and very filling. Now I make it once a month.

Flavorful, creamy and delicious!  I added minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Followed the other reviews and put the sauce on top of the noodles.  I also put a bit of the sauce on the bottom of my pan.  I halved the recipe as well and it was perfect for my family!  This is a keeper.

Yum!!!! I was surprised at the sour cream, but it was great.  My kids will not eat left overs, but asked for these. It makes a lot, so I plan to split recipe in two pans next time and freeze one.  There were good comments on changing order and putting sauce first.  I did not do this, but will next time as I think it will make a difference.  Try this!  It is really good-a new family favorite/

I have to admit, I made several changes, so I'm not sure I can say I made this recipe exactly.  However, the great thing about the recipe is that it is easily adaptable.
I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and shredded mozzerella instead of prvolone.  I like veggie meals, but this one is great with the ground beef - just makes it a little heartier.  I found it a little hard to tell when it was done, but I managed to get it just right (about as long as the recipe said).

I also bought a jar of alfredo sauce, heated it on the stove and poured it into each of the layers on top of the sauce mixture. I couldn't really tell that the alfredo was in there, but it sure was delicious and wasn't dry at all. I would definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe. I followed some of the suggestions from the comments below. I added minced cooked garlic then I added a bottom layer of sauce, then the zit and followed the recipe as instructed. This recipe is a winner!

Incredible! Have found that the brand of Italian sausage and the brand/type of Sauce used can either make or break the meal. If you have a favorite of either, stick with what you know and you will LOVE the outcome. I also like to add mushrooms and extra cheese.

I was looking for a simple recipe for baked ziti and came across this one, I chose it because it was so highly rated.  I was a little unsure of how it would turn out because of the different cheeses but I loved it.  Even my super picky eight year old loved it.  I plan on making it again and again!  I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.

This is my all time favorite baked ziti recipe.  I tripped over it and decided to give it a try, and it became an instant hit.  I made a dish of this and a dish of 'traditional' baked ziti when having a group of people over...there was NONE of this left!!  People always ask me to make my special baked ziti now.  I don't normally like provolone cheese and even I love this!  I am sure your family and guests will love it!!!

My roommates and I made this together after finals week, and we arranged the dish a little differently when we baked it... but it was delicious!!!! I think we instead topped it with the cheese, while the sauce, noodles and meat were underneath. It melted just the right way to water our mouths!

The addition of the sour-cream completely alters the taste of what a classical baked-ziti should should resemble.

I have made this Baked Ziti many, many times. It is my go to meal for friends who have just had new babies. I usually split it in two smaller throw away containers- one to eat now and one to freeze and save for later. I have made it both with and without the ground beef and both versions are delicious. I, also, love to use homemade marinara sauce. I've had a really hard time finding ziti pasta, so I just use whatever big tubes that I can find. I, also, substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream.

I don't think you do need to cover this. Thats why you put all the sauce on top. I didnt cover it and mine came out fine. DELICIOUS recipe! Cheesy and creamy and perfect!

I love this recipe. It turns out great every time. The sour cream and provolone cheese adds a mild cheese flavor without overpowering the dish. I usually add 1/2lb. ground round & 1/2lb. mild italian sausage to the sauce. It's a great recipe for big parties. I just made it for 50 people in a roaster oven and it came out super moist. Lots of compliments.

This Ziti was really good!  It had a wonderful flavor with the mixture between the provolone cheese, mozzarella cheese and the parmesan cheese.  The sour cream was a wonderful addition.  We like a lot of cheese so I bumped up the amounts and the parmesan cheese I have is the 3 cheese blend.  I covered it for the first 30 minutes and took the foil off for the last 5 minutes.  Very moist and flavorful dish!!  Thanks for submitting this!

I have made this a few times now.  Love it!  The last time I made it, I did the healthy version.  Still delicious!  I used wheat noodles, turkey burger, fat free sour cream, and low fat mozzerella cheese.  I added minced garlic and italian seasoning to the burger.  My husband barely noticed a difference!

I liked this, it had a very different taste than I was expecting. The sour cream and provolone were unexpected- I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't GREAT, and I did have to jazz it up a bit the second time I made it with more garlic and italian seasonings. I will make this again, but I think next time I will use half the amount of sour cream and provolone, and twice as much mozzarella. I thought it was even better the next day when I reheated the leftovers for lunch.

I made this recipe for the first time for a dinner party of 9.  I had more than enough baked ziti and everyone LOVED it! I added a little bit of minced garlic when I was browning the ground beef.  I also used a traditional basil spaghetti sauce (that was chunky) and everyone thought I had made the sauce myself.   This recipe was really simple and came out perfect.  I will definitely make it again and have passed it on to my friends!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! Ive made this ziti several times. Ive made a few changes to my familys liking .. I add a roll of sausage in with the ground beef & brown it together, then when I add the sauce, I stir in ricotta cheese in with the sauce & let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes..  I toss the pasta with sour cream, & when I do my layering, I throw in some pepperonis. I use provolone cheese as well as mozzerella with my layers.. I serve it up with some fresh cut chives/green onions ... SOOO YUMMY !!!!

Loved it, big hit with my wife.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the sour cream, and added some hot italian sausage to the mix.  I will Definitely be making this again.

Great recipe.  I mixed the sour cream in w/ the sauce and meat mixture. That seemed to work much better then spreading it.  I also didn't have any provolone cheese, so I just used Mexican cheese and it turned out awesome!

Was a little interested in seeing this with sour cream. I'm used to Ricotta and found more recipes on this site without it. So I tried it  and it was a nice change to the traditional Ricotta. I think i used too much sour cream so you could really taste the sour cream, but my family LOVES it. Will probably be a regular in my house.

This recipe was sooo good. When I took it out the oven and tasted it. I couldn't stop eating it out the pan, that's just how good it was. The only thing I did different was use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I will definitely be making this again!!! Try it.

This is a nice variation from the "usual" baked ziti.  And especially nice for those who don't favor ricotta cheese.  Having prepared this several times now (I loathe those who change recipes the first time they make them and then criticize), I, after the first time I made this decided to omit the ground beef as I felt it unecessary.  The only other thing I did differently was to use my own homemade gravy as we all know good cooks never use jarred.  A good recipe and a keeper!

Great recipe. I didn't feel right about using sour cream in an Italian dish though, so I left it out. I also found I was a bit short on sauce, but I made it work. I was eating the leftovers for days and loving every bite.

I have been making this for about a year now. It really is a great recipe. The only thing I did different is that I use italian sausage and put a little water in the sauce because it gets dried out. But this is really yummy and my boyfriend loves it every time and it makes great leftovers.

I always get rave reviews whenever I make this!  I usually undercook the pasta by a minute or two because it will continue to cook in the oven. It tastes great without the meat, or with half ground beef/ground italian sausage for a more savory taste. Add some red pepper flakes if you like the heat. You can assemble this a day or two ahead of time, and just increase the baking time when you do pop it in the oven.

I tripled this recipe and made it for a Bridal Shower- and I didn't take ANY home.  Everyone enjoyed it and fortunately we had some take out boxes- people took a bunch to go.  Will definitely make again- just in a smaller batch next time for the house!!! Thanks

This is a family favorite.  I add a clove of garlic to the meat and it tastes even better!  I also don't include all the sour cream called for, and use penne pasta instead of ziti.. personal preference.

Everyone loved this!  I combined the meat and sauce with the pasta so it wouldn't be dry.  Sort of made it like lasagna, without the ricotta and layering work of lasagna noodles. I'll definitely make it again, thanks!

see i really like this meal. I have made it twice: once with sour cream and once without. I think the sour cream makes the meal, in my opinion. Gives more depth to the flavor. I also added to cayenne pepper and garlic to my ground beef which added some spice. yum! it's on my family's weekly meal list! Thanks for the east and yummy recipe!

This has become a staple in our house.  I cook it exactly as the recipe says except I mix the sauce and meat with the noodles first.  We make extra and love it as a left over!

My family went nuts over this dish! My 2 year old son who is not easy to please couldn't get enough and kept telling me he loved it. I mixed the ziti and sauce together for the bottom layer based on someone else's review and it turned out perfect. This is definitely going in my "Family Favorites" folder.

Excellent! Added garlic, and used 1 cup ricotta plus 1/2 cup sour cream (my kids aren't crazy about the taste of sour cream but loved it this way).

Excellent! I set the servings for 5 but it would have served 8. Used mozzarella instead of provolone then doubled. Love the sour cream in it! Used Newman's Own Sockarooni for the sauce. I tossed the sauce/beef mixture with the ziti noodles before layering. I did not cover to bake because I am out of foil but I did not experience a drying out problem. It was delicious! (95)

I only had red onion, which worked great, and only had sliced Havarti (instead of provolone), which was also creamy and flavorful. We LOVED the dish!

I used ricotta with a little sour cream mix in. This is not a "wow" dish, but is very good and very cheesy. May add a jar of mushrooms next time

Awesome recipe! I was a little worried about the sour cream but it turned out yummy! I didnt put beef in mine, and I carmilzed the onions with garlic before adding them to the sauce. I used home made sauce and added munster cheese on top- it was so good!

VERY good! I used my homemade sauce vs. the jarred sauce but followed the recipe otherwise. I have made many versions of ziti, but I think this one may be the best.

Fabulous recipe!  I've made this two ways--once with italian pork sausage and all the fat and once with ground turkey, low fat sour cream and whole wheat rigatoni.  It's great either way!

This is an easy, delicious recipe. I added seasonings that I use in spaghetti sauce (Basil, Oregano, Marjoram, Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Garlic) and 2 T. of white sugar. I set aside 3 cups of the sauce, then mixed everything else with the cooked pasta, except for the Parmesan cheese. I put the pasta mixture into two 9" square pans, then topped each with 1-1/2 cups of sauce. I covered it with foil, and baked it. Yummy!

I will definitely make this recipe again!  Like many others, I made my own meat sauce, using ground sausage instead of beef.  I followed other reviews and placed the first layer of sauce directly on top of the ziti.  Surprisingly, I found the sour cream added a nice flavor to the dish.  Like others, I covered the dish while baking.  Next time around, I will add 5-10 minutes to the bake time, as the cheese in the center of the casserole could benefit from extra heat.

Excellent recipe, and easy to customize. You'll never want to OR NEED TO make lasagna again. Layer cooked ingredients into your crock pot first thing in the AM for an office potluck dish.  :)

This was delicious!  I made it without meat and poured the sauce right from the jar.  I didn't use all the sauce and it does need to be covered when baking.  Yummy...it's a keeper!

I make this often and everyone likes. However, I omit the onions and ground beef and use pepperoni instead. It is delicious. I also sometimes switch out the sour cream with ricotta chesse. Either way its good! This recipe has become my signature dish.

This is a great dish to give to family/friends when they need a hand. Made as is only without onion. Layered sauce on pasta then cheese. It was really good and all fit into a 9x13. Covered with greased foil while baking.

I also tried this recipe with an egg and ricotta cheese. I found that if you use fresh basil and oregano with the ricotta it gives it more of an Italian taste. Great recipe to have for alot of guests

Easy and yummy! A hit! I used cream cheese instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand.

I made this one night and took some to my dad (who was in the hospital at that time) He absolutely loved it! He even told me that the recipe was excellent and that a thing did not  need to be change! Now although it was VERY good I think I have to disregard what my dad said and next time add some garlic after browning the hamburger.

One of my favorite recipes by far!  This is a no fail crowd pleaser!!!! I do add a few additional ingredients including diced red and green pepper (sauteed with the onion and meat of course) and   cooked spicy Italian sausage (which does add quite a bit of spice in case that bothers you).

This turned out well even though I made a couple of mistakes. I actually mixed the sauce with the noodles and sprinkled the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses on top before baking. It still tasted good! I always add onions, garlic, basil, parsley, etc. to a store-bought sauce. Overall, very good and will make again.

Great, easy recipe that makes a lot.  It gets even better as leftovers.  Also a great dish to take for potluck dinners, to friends who are sick, etc.  It makes so much it's easy to split for sharing.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have provolone, so I substituted some "Italian Blend" shredded cheese.  We fed 5 including seconds for most, and still have half a pan left.  Easy and absolutely delicious family meal.

I baked this ahead and froze it so that I wouldn't have to cook when my family visited from out of state. They loved it and thought it was better than lasagna. I will be making this again.

My husband loves this recipe - it makes a lot and he eats it all almost by himself. He's Italian and he doesn't want me to find another ziti recipe.. we've been using this for 2 years now - we don't change anything. :)

This was one of the best meals I have ever made.  It's easy (I even made my own sauce) and it tastes great the next day.  I should also add that I omitted the beef and it was still delicious!  We ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!!!  It's all gone now and I'm thinking when I can eat it again.

I was not sure about this recipe using sour cream since I've only heard of ricotta or cottage cheese but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't change anything except the type of noodles since it's what I had on hand but everything else stayed the same and it was wonderful.  I think the sour cream helped keep it moist.

This recipe is great. After reading all the reviews I decided to follow the recipe all with the exception of the noodles. I put the sauce on the noodles before the cheese. It came out great!

Great classic recipe. I substituted ground turkey and it still turned out fantastic. Easy and serves lots. Throw in a salad and presto meal. It is easily frozen and reheated.

I was looking for a quicker version of manicotti, which always takes so long because you have to stuff the noodles. This is how I made it:  3 cups noodles (dried), 1 1/4 lb lean ground turkey, 2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce, 15 oz low fat ricotta cheese, 8 oz low fat sour cream, 8 oz low fat mozarella cheese, 4 oz grated parmesan cheese, 1 egg, 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, Salt & Pepper to taste  I cooked the ground turkey with onion and garlic while I boiled the ziti. In a medium bowl I mixed together ricotta, cheeses, sour cream, egg, and seasonings. For the first layer I used sauce, so I wouldn't have to grease the pan. I then layered half the pasta (I reduced the pasta because there was way too much to fit in a 13 x 9 pan), then I layered with half the meat/onion mixture, and then half the cheese mixture. I repeated. I covered with foil, baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Then took out, sprinkled with additional cheese and baked until cheese was melted. Great dish, very creamy.

I have to rate this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't have provolone to add and I added mushrooms to mix.  This was a huge hit with my family and pretty easy to make.  I used a jar of classico's traditional sweet basil spaghetti sauce.  It was excellent.

I made this for dinner and all I can say say is YUMMY my family loved it. The sour cream and provolone made it so creamy. Only thing I did different was cook my sauce for about 5-6 hours(good sauce has to simmer) and added some mushrooms. Follow the layers and you will not be disappointed. I will make over and over

I have made this many many times and have even played with the ingredients using different cheeses, etc. This is a staple dinner around our house because it is a sure thing that my family will be happy to devour it and left overs don't last long!! I even pack it in my 10 year-olds lunch box for her to heat and eat at school! This one is a keeper!!

This is the best baked pasta I've ever had.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream so only used 1/2 of the amount & mixed the pasta & sauce before layering and it turned out perfectly.  It's so creamy you won't believe it and tastes great!! Baked it covered 20 mins then took the foil off for 10 mins....very juiicy.  I'll never make baked pasta any other way.  Thank you!!!

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good.  The second time, I used sausage instead of hamburger, ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and I added 2 cloves of pressed, fresh garlic and some italien seasoning when the onions were almost done and it was AMAZING!!!  A new family favorite for sure!!

I was expecting just your typical noodle/red sauce dish, and was pleasantly surprised how tasty this was! My husband and I both LOVED it, and are looking forward to make it again in the future. I made this exactly how it was written (but cut it in half and did in a smaller dish). Thanks for a great recipe!

it was good.  a little starch from all the pasta.  I think I'd use bigger ziti as opposed to the small ones.

Yummy!  Too bad this one is so difficult to convert into a "healthy" version.  Here are my substitutions: ground turkey, low-fat cheeses, and fat-free sour cream, whole wheat pasta, and reduced-fat Italian hard cheese blend.  I also added some chopped, fresh parsley to the sauce.  Not much else is possible -- it's still in the "comfort food" category and I will still happily eat it!

I did not like this recipe at all. I thought it was going to be great due to all the great reviews, but it lacked flavor and had a bitter aftertaste. I followed the instructions except to add some sauce to the bottom layer of ziti. My 3yr old who loves any kind of pasta only ate a couple bites and my husband did not touch his. Fortunately, I halved the recipe.

Fantastic!! I always made baked ziti with ricotta cheese, so I was VERY skeptical about making this with sour cream.  To my surprise, the sour cream made it very creamy & a great flavor!  Hubby agrees too, and is a keeper for sure!!

True comfort food -- easy to make, yummy to eat, not very seasoned. If you like more flavor, add more herbs and spices, maybe use some sausage. Recommended recipe!

Excellent!  If I had a complaint, it would be that it's so very rich.  Will never be served on the caridac unit. I did subsitute a young-ish (sliceable, rather than grateable) Asiago for the Provolone.

I really can't review this recipe based on the instructions and ingredients that were given because I followed some of the reviewers advice and substituted the provolone and sour cream with ricotta.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I think if I try it again I will definitely at least try the "actual" recipe.

I give this 4 stars because I made a lot of edits to this recipe. I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and I mixed an egg with the ricotta and ziti. I also used my own homemade sauce which I think added a lot to this as well. All in all, it turned out very good.

Made it just as written... i think ;) I used the ingredients as is at least! I never pay much attention to the how to's when it's layering. It was delicious! My picky kids (8, 11, and 13) ate it up too. I was questioning the sour cream and considered using ricotta instead, but I figured it must be in the recipe for a reason - and I have to say, I think that was my favorite part in the end! Very creamy. I did cover with foil when baking because people said it got dry when left uncovered, but mine was a little runny, so??? Maybe cover half way through? :P   All in all, best I've tried from allrecipes yet!

This is great if you need a meal to serve for a dinner party of large group. When I make it I put it into two 9X9 pans and bake them, then freeze one for later. It's great reheated too.

This is an excellent make-ahead recipe you can throw together on Sunday and then bake later in the week or take to a pot luck dinner.  The layer of sour cream is a delicious and surprising twist!  Great tasting leftovers too.

This was a huge hit at my house!  The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 cup sour cream with a block of cream cheese, because I was out of sour cream.  Tasted wonderful. will make it the same way next time.  Would be a great dish for serving to guest or taking to a pot luck! YUMMY!

OH MY GOSH!!!  This is one of the best recipes I have made off this site.  I made the following modifications:  I cooked 3 sweet italian sausage links out of their casings.  I used bertolli sauce (one vodka sauce one tomatoe basil), and I added 4 ounce of softened cream cheese to the sour cream mix.  I did as others suggested and put some sauce on the bottom of the pan, then I layered as the reciped stated.

Fantastic and fairly simple!  I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used 1/2 c of cream cheese and 1 C of sour cream- delicious!  Also, I added minced garlic and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  I let the sauce simmer about 35 minutes too. My son (the picky eater) ate a ton!

Very good! Makes a lot, could easily serve 6 with large portions. We both ate it, I froze some, and will eat some more as leftovers. Almost didn't fit in the 9x13 dish. I used a spinach and cheese spaghetti sauce with the dish. YUM!

I made this the other night and it was okay. Of course, I have severe acid reflux so I was not able to eat much as I was under the weather when I made it. I am going to try again soon, very soon. But what I ate I liked, however I think I am going to try ricotta instead of sour cream even though I love sour cream. Will give this a four based off of what I had.

I doubled this recipe and served 14 people - most of who went back for seconds! It's a great recipe and I received wonderful compliment for this great dish. I only sub'd sausage for the beef.

Very easy to put together and yummy. The only changes I did were used penne pasta ( didn't have ziti) and I put the sauce on top of the pasta before the cheese and sour cream like someone suggested. I will be making again and again.

Tried this weekend, delicious, but came out very watery.  I used my own homemade sauce that had been frozen and thawed? My sauce is thinner than store bought, maybe thats why.

I just got done eating a heaping plate full of this stuff.  It was so delicious!!  And might I add, very simple to put together.  The sour cream added a nice zip to it.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I did add a little garlic salt and oregano to the meat and onions.  Instead of ground beef I used Italian sausage.  And I put the sauce directly on top of the ziti like someone else suggested.  I will make again many times I'm sure.

My grocery store did not have ziti pasta so I used penne pasta instead.  I cooked it a minute less than the directions said.  It turned out just as good.  I kept everything the same and my WHOLE family loved it.  It's definitely a keeper.  And I will make it again in the near future.  Thanks!

My step son is a very picky eater. Loves pizza! So, I tried this one on for size. I substituted the ground beef for peperoni and didn't add the onions. It was a HUGE hit with him.   It was fabulous as I served it to my step son, but it wasn't as good left over. I'd cut the servings to what you need at one sitting.   GREAT and EASY recipe!!!!!

this is THE baked ziti here on the site.  awesome recipe, can't complain about a thing.  don't miss the sour cream & the provolone & if you want it to be really good, you need to use real parmesan & more than 2 Tbs. on top!  be aware that this probably won't fit well into a 9x13", i end up using a 9x13" + loaf pan to bake it all at once.  a bigger "lasagna" pan would be perfect.  i have never used 2 whole jars of spaghetti sauce, i think that's overkill, but try & see for yourself.  you don't have to cover this, it should be fine as long as you didn't skimp on the sauce & cover all the noodles adequately.

I halved the recipe, and used a little more cheese than called for. Next time I will add a little more ground beef as well. I also layered the sauce under the cheese, as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out great, very delicious, I think the provolone tastes much better than ricotta would have. Will definitely make again!

Really good and easy to make. I would suggest adding some seasoning to the sour cream and/or using ricotta, but sour cream works just fine. I seasoned the meat well and added some rosemary. I followed some other comments suggestions of adding sauce before the cheese when layering. Turned out great!

Very faithful and great. It makes a lot. My house only having two people but I froze some and took some to work for co-workers. I was hesitant with it because I had only made it with ricotta but the sour cream and provolone really did work.

This was very good.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  The sour cream definitely made this dish more delicious.  Very easy to make.

Excellent dish that the WHOLE family loved!...from 17 to 10 this was gobbled up and so were seconds. The children had no room for dessert and wanted me to make this dish again soon. Definately a "keeper"!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out wonderfully.  I've never made baked ziti before, and I was under the gun to make food for a crowd, so I didn't have any time to "test" a recipe out.  This worked out perfectly.  Nobody could believe there wasn't any ricotta cheese in the dish because it looked like it did when it was served, strangely enough.  I've had so much crappy and mediocre baked ziti before -- this recipe needs to be shared to put an end to that!!  Two Thumbs Up!

Very good.  To simplify, I just mixed the ziti in with the sauce and split for 2 layers.  Topped with the cheeses.

I have made this a few times now and my husband and I absolutely love this recipe!  I have only altered this once and included spinach.  We love it either way.  I never thought of including sour cream, but it really made it taste great.

I made this for Sunday football and I have very picky eaters who attend everyweek. They LOVED this! Its a standard ziti recipe but the sour cream added that extra zip. I added more of all the cheeses just because my friends like it that way.

After reading a ton of other reviews, I decided to make this recipe exactly the way it was intended, with the sour cream and provolone, not with ricotta as many of you suggested.  I did not add any meat to my sauce, though.  I have to say, this was an amazing dish, full of robust flavor -- must have been the sour cream and provolone!  My husband and two kids (who are very picky) ate it up like crazy and everyone kept telling me how "yummy" it was.  So not only was it delicious, it was EASY and quick!  This is definitely a winner!

Hello All. I tried this today with the following changes. Ricotta and one egg mixed with the Ziti, No Provalone or Sour Cream. I Used Ragu Chuncky W/Muishroom for the sauce one of the big jars. I seasoned the meat while it browned with garlic powder and onion powder then drained it and Mixed it into the sauce and let that simmer for 15 mins. Sauce on the bottom Ziti mix next Mozz. Parm. and some garlic powder and oregano. Repeat Cover with foil and baked for a Half hour. My wife who said it was Ok Hates everything I cook so It must be pretty  good. I thought it was a really good tasteing way to warm up.

Even though it has the same ingredients as the back of the ziti box, this recipe is great because of the order that it layers the ingredients. One layer of provolone and sour cream is much easier to assemble than the 2 layers they suggest on the box. This is super easy and very delicious -- and even picky kids love it. My daughter hates ricotta cheese, so the sour cream is a nice change.

I was a little skeptical about how good this recipe could  be with such simple ingredients, but MY GOD this was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!!!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and mixed the bottom layer of pasta with sauce.  I also put the mozzarella and parmesan on top vs. the sauce on top of the mozzarella.Thank you Colleen for sharing this recipe.  It is a new favorite!

I've been making this for years and always a big hit.  I substitute hot Italian sausage for the ground beef.  I up the provolone to 8oz. because I just order ½ # at the counter.  I go with either regular sour cream or reduced fat.  Doesn’t effect is one bit going reduced fat.  I’ve never tried fat free but probably wouldn’t be an issue.  I just eyeball the shredded mozzarella.

This was easy to make and was really good.  I used the ricotta cheese mixed with one egg and some fresh parmesan. I have also tried it mixed with spinach and my family loved it.  A good way to sneak in the vegetables.

This is a favorite recipe for those times when you have last minute guests.  It always turns out great, and feeds a lot of people!  I do add the sauce with the noodles for the bottom layer, and the end result is delicious.

ok.....so I normally would not take the time to review any recipes......but this one really deserves it! I was very excited to try this and to my surprise it turned out fabulous!! This one is definitely a keeper. Even my husband went for seconds because it was that good. The only thing he mentioned was that I put way too many onions in with the meat so next time I will just half it. The only thing I changed was that I used ground turkey instead of beef. Great recipe!! Thank you!

I LOVE baked ziti! This was a nice, easy version for me to adapt to my family's preferences, and was also inexpensive to make. I used rotini noodles (easier for my little ones to get on a fork), omitted meat & provolone (for cost), and mixed noodles & sauce together prior to baking, as others suggested. I also covered the pan with foil up to the last 10 minutes, and it wasn't dry. I'll be making this often. I was leery since there were no added spices, but it was still very flavorful. I'll try it with provolone next time.

I love this dish.  It's easy to make and it tastes delicious.  I usually mix the sauce and ziti together to make sure everything is coated before putting it in the pan.  This another recipe that the picky eaters in my family love.  I've made it for large gatherings of 15 to 20 people or just for the four of us.  It's very versatile.  :-)

This was one of the best ziti dishes I've ever had. Made it for a party and got rave reviews. Followed recipe exactly, except omitted the beef (don't like meat in  my ziti) & added a little bit of minced garlic (can't make an Italian dish without garlic!). I was worried it wouldn't have a lot of flavor since the recipe doesn't call for any seasoning, but it had a wonderful flavor. This is going to be my "go to" recipe for baked ziti from now on!

Love this recipe! I've made it over a dozen times now but haven't added the meat to it yet (but I hope to in the future) because some family members don't eat meat.  I also don't layer it but mix it all up, not sure if that makes much of a difference.  But I do add chopped mushrooms to the sauce. Easy to make and so good! Thanks for the recipe.

SO GOOD!!! I used my own homemade mushroom red sauce sauce, skipped the meat all together, and it came out delicious!  The sour cream is the most important part, and I never would have thought of adding that on my own, but it just adds a richness that makes this dish perfecto =)  Still good the next day too!

I found this recipe a few months ago and my family loves it ! Even the picky 3 year old. Total keeper. Since I'm big on veggies I tend to do a version with sautéd muhrooms, onions and black olives- winner!  I did as many suggested and mixed the noodles and sauce and covered while baking. I make it again and again.

This ziti recipe was incredible.  I used 2 layers of light sour cream (1 16 oz.) container and only one jar of spaghetti sauce, but I kept everything else the same.  The sour cream adds so much flavor and compliments the spaghetti sauce nicely.  I will definitely be making this recipe on a regular basis.

This was very good. My family loved it. I cut it in half we are a family of 3 now. I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream, (needed to use it up). This will be in our rotation for sure.

This tastes great and will be done again. I used the same ingredients but only used 1 jar of sauce with the meat and added a jar to the cooked pasta to be sure all of them were coated.

This was the best Ziti I have ever had or made--hands down!  My boyfriend loved it too. He went back for seconds and then asked me to pack it for lunch for him the next day. I followed the recipe exactly just substituting ground turkey for the beef  and adding a little fresh minced garlic while cooking the turkey & onion.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it, husband thought the sour cream should have just been replaced with cottage cheese. Otherwise it's good, we'll try it again with the cottage cheese.

I've made this a few times and my family loves it. My dad always has two sometimes three plates. I just left out the sour cream because I wasn't sure how to spread it on to the cheese without making a big mess

We enjoyed this quick easy ziti! I made the sauce with the beef, onion, garlic and green pepper. then just added an egg to a tub of ricotta with some herbs.. no sourcream... the italian restaurant i used to work at always used ricotta so i figured it would be more authentic. After layering in pan I foiled the top and stuck it in the oven for 30 minutes.. We had nice saucy ziti and a salad!! And I have plenty left over to freeze for when baby comes! ;)

My sister introduced me to this recipe a few years ago and I have made it for my youngest daughters birthday dinner ever since. My family loves it and I'm sure it will be passed along for a very long time! Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. Using these noodles was fun and different. I especially liked the swiss cheese and ricotta cheese. I made 2 and froze one and it was good even when I baked it later on.

I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty. It was also awesome. I will make again and again. I used whole wheat ziti and I used low fat cheeses and sour cream and you could not tell the difference.

Delicious, quick and easy! My hubby and 3 teenagers LOVED it.  I used Ricotta instead of Sour Cream. This dish will certainly go on our top 10 list. I packed what little was left in my lunch today.  Thank you for sharing!

Super Easy! The default serving size was a bit large but well worth it since it is my favorite dish. Used the sour cream/ricotta mixture. and could'nt find ziti Pasta but used Rigitoni pasta instead, no difference. I work for an italian resturant and really think I will suggest the sour cream/ricotta mixture to the owner, for this dish. Sumrfy dish even the smurfling loved it and ate it all. This dish really made me feel like chef smurf.

I have made this recipe multiple times and it's alwasys a big hit!  I have added more vegetables to it such as green pepper, mushrooms, onions & tomatoes.  I have also started making it with ground turkey and it's still amazing!

I'm not a very good cook usually and I was able to make this! I used fake meat crumbles to turn this dish vegetarian and my boyfriend said he couldn't even tell the difference! I also used Colby Jack cheese instead of provolone and added some chopped green peppers and some extra seasoning to the sauce. I halved the recipe because it was just for the two of us and we still have leftovers. I don't like ricotto cheese so I wouldn't even think about changing to that. The sour cream worked out wonderfully, even though I was skeptical! I couldn't even tell it was in there really! I will be adding this into our rotation of dishes. I can't wait to cook it for other people too!

It had a bit more sauce in it than I generally like, but I enjoyed this.  Instead of ground beef I used Italian sausage.

This recipe was great! I used ground turkey and Italian sausage, and it came out great. Not too salty either, my little brother loved it--and that's an indicator for me that it's a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing!

Incredible. The sour cream is a fantastic compliment to the rest of the ingredients. A+   I halved the recipe as I only had to feed myself and my boyfriend, and I can't wait for the leftovers tonight!! Thank you for this recipe.

My boys freaked over this and are wondering when they can have it again!  Made as directed....might try more sauce on the bottom layer, for personal preference, but as is, super tasty, super easy and super great leftovers (it makes A LOT!)

I made this as a side dish without the ground beef. I was amazed at how flavorful t was! My husband went for seconds. I never would have thought to add sour cream, but I think it added a nice creaminess to the dish. Bravo! Well created recipe!

Boyfriend went nuts over this recipe. I thought it tasted good but he went on about it for the rest of the night. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I just added minced garlic with the onion and hamburger while it was browning.

I made this dish for the first time a couple of weeks ago for some company, it was a huge hit! I did follow some of the advice and bake it covered (prevented it from drying out) I also used spicy italian sausage in place of the ground beef...it was amazing! I am making it again for my in-laws next week!

This was a hit.  Just happened to have all the ingredients with a few twists.  Doctored up ragu in a crockpot with browned italian sausage all day as the sauce.  Had smoked provolone. Tasty!

Very good recipe!!  I think the types of sauce that is used could really make a difference in the taste... I used a 3 cheese and a parmesan/ricotta blend..MMmmm.  My one complaint is that it could of used a little more salt.

Yummmmy!  Easy to make, tastes delicious, what else can I say?  Mixing the bottom layer noodles with enough sauce just to make them moist was a good tip.

I love this recipe! The flavors are great and it's very simple to prepare. After making it several times, here are a few things that I would change (techniques mostly, not really to do with the flavors): 1) Mix the sour cream into the sauce while it's simmering. I don't like the taste of just sour cream as a layer. 2) Spread a small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan to keep pasta from sticking. 3) Layer as follows: ziti, sauce, provolone, ziti, sauce mozzarella. 4) Forget the Parmesan. If you're like me, you don't use it that often and it just goes to waste. Why buy a whole package of Parmesan to use just 2 Tbsp?

So easy and my family loved it!! Great recipe but I did a little change. I mixed 1 egg with cottage cheese and sour cream to make an amount of 2 cups total. This one is a keeper for sure!!!

I really, really enjoyed this, although I doubled the cheese and added garlic powder to the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe several times, and it's really good whether using ground beef or turkey. Everyone loves it and wants the recipe. I typically combine the meat sauce and pasta to ensure each one is sauced before making layers, and I don't measure the cheese. There can never be too much!

I doubled the recipe, used italian sausage instead of hamburger and used more sauce and served it at a birthday gathering for my brother & sister-in-laws.  It was a hit!!!  Great recipe!

Delicious, but makes A LOT! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 baking dish and still had plenty to serve 4-5 people. I layered as others suggested: pasta, sauce, cheese, sour cream. And make sure to cover while baking to avoid drying out.

I used w/w ziti and cottage cheese in place of the sour cream and it was FABULOUS! I've made it with sour cream before, but the cottage cheese is the perfect addition! Will make again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe, Thank you Colleen!   I used Vodka pasta sauce and chicken breast instead.  Also I mix the sour cream with the mozarella and a pinch of salt.   It was a hit  in my house!!!    Gati

All of us love this recipe...it is asked for often and a huge hit.  I mix in some spices to the sour cream, like parsley and chives and some garlic powder.  Great reheated too.  Serve it with a Cesar salad and fruit , you have a family winner...

yummy- this is one that is easy enough for me - a newlywed who is usually tired and frustrated when dinner takes more than 5 mins to make! my husband really liked it- even though i had to use spiral pasta- next time i will use tube pasta. I didn't have any parm and i added fresh mushrooms- it turned out basically perfect. thanks for a simple and delicious recipe that i will be happy to make again!!

This was alright, but it's just not my tastes.  I think what I really wanted was a ziti that was more cheese and no meat.  So, it's a fine recipe, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

LOVE THIS ZITI!!!! I have made this ziti 3 times now and my family LOVES it!!  I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef and 2 1/2 jars of sause. Also I use shredded parmesan on top the last 10 minutes of baking. i cover it until the last 10 minutes. I use a larger than 13 x 9 pan. I think it is perfect. My husband can't stop raving about it!

Yummmm....this is an easy and delicious recipe for company. This is so much easier and less messy than lasagna.  Great as is, but may try sausage in place of lean beef for a change up.   Serve with salad and bread.

I would only give this a 3. I just cooked it with my boyfriend, and we found it to be very bland. I even added quite a bit of garlic and italian seasoning to the onion/beef mix and it was just not very exciting. The sour cream made it watery, and I'm not impressed :(

I love this easy recipe! I am making it tonight for 8 people...   I actually simmer/reduce the sauce for longer than 15 mins because I like my ziti to be pretty thick, but that is just personal preference. I also make it meat free because my boyfriend is a veggie... would love to try it with meat though!  Sauce is pretty easy to make- next time I will probably try to make this but make my own sauce instead of just jar of spaghetti sauce.   As far as covering it goes- yes do cover it for the bulk of the baking, but I uncover it towards the end to make the cheese look toasty.

Everyone loves this recipe in my house.  It's great as described.  However, instead of typically layering, I fold over all the ingredients to make sure the meat, sauce, sour cream and cheeses are evenly distributed.  Then, I top with an additional layer of mozzarella cheese.  Yummy!

I was a little nervous about this recipe due to the lack of ricotta and bc I didn't like the spaghetti sauce I bought that much. BUT, it turned out DELICIOUS! I took other reviewers advice and mixed the ziti with the meat sauce instead of layering. That worked well, I think, to keep the noodles moist.

My boyfriend and I really liked this Ziti recipe! We are vegetarians, so instead of the ground beef, I sauteed chopped zucchini and yellow squash and added it to the sauce. I also added fresh garlic. BIG HIT!

I made 80 pans of this recipe for a fund raiser and had TONS of compliments!  This is a definite repeat.  The only thing I did to make it freeze easier was to mix the sour cream and spaghetti sauce together before putting it in the pan.

This recipe is great! Everyone I have made it for LOVES IT!!! I prefer to add some garlic to the meat and onion mixture and a splash of red wine to the sauce; I also layer mine a bit different so the sauce gets mixed up inside the noodles. No matter how it is made though, there is no going wrong with this recipe; it's an A+! Makes AWESOME leftovers...YUM!

Great!! I usually make these recipes for other ppl first and then let them try it, but I made this for myself at home and it was delicious..I'm a bit messy in the kitchen as well.. But I also followed the other members reviews and put the meat sauce after the pasta so it can go throughout all the pasta.. I didn't bake mines as long but it still came out perfect!!! Next time, I'm going to try for more vegetables in the meat sauce!!! YAY!!! THIS IS A WINNER...

Delicious!  I made half the serving size and used turkey instead of beef and my BF and I loved this.  Also, I only used about 2 dollops of sour cream because of some of the other reviews.  Will def be making this again!

This recipe is just delicious. I prepare it exactly according to the recipe and everyone I have served it to is crazy about it. I have fixed it often! One thing I found out when I put it in two smaller casseroles and baked the second one the next day. It tasted even better after having been in the fridge for a day! A real keeper.

Despite the fact that I used a store bought pasta sauce (I normally make my sauce from scratch) I am still giving this five stores.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' (except that I did mix the sauce with the noodles before layering) and it turned out FANTASTICO! A lot of reviewers are recommending to cover the dish when baking.  I didn't do that as I like the top to get a bit browned and crispy. I have been looking for a great baked pasta recipe for a long time.  I finally found it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful meal that the whole family loves! I did as someone suggested and mixed the sour cream with the pasta after draining, it went a long way to keeping the pasta tender after baking. I have made this meal 4 times for my family and I will continue to do so.

This is the best baked ziti ever!  I make it all the time for get togethers, seminars for my husband, and recently in the local celebrity chef.  Everyone loves it.  My sister now makes this for all her get togethers now.  I do add onion and garlic to the ground meat.  I also have layered this several different ways and each time it is great!

Absolutely fantastic! I used Premio thin-rolled sausage (basil and cheese), cooked it, then cut it into small coins. It worked beautifully! Delicious recipe. EXTREMELY cheesy!

Everyone loved it!  It also freezes well so we were able to eat it for a couple of weeks.  Makes for nights of not having to cook!  I substituted vegetarian meat-bits for the beef and it added a good texture.  I also followed the advice of others to substitute ricotta for sour cream, and skipped the provolone.  I'm making it again for a potluck this week!

Great recipe but definitely cover with tin foil before cooking. I prefer a ricotta/sour cream combo. VEGETARIANS - substitute a package of frozen chopped spinach for the beef. So so good.

This is the BEST I've ever tasted.  I didn't change anything the first time I made it.  The 2nd time I used deli sliced cheese for the layers and I think that is the secret to it being stringy cheesey.  My family loved it.  And we took to a friends for dinner who just had a baby and they loved it.  You can't go wrong w/ this recipe.  Delicous.

OMG...This was so awesome that the 20 people I served it to were completely silent while they ate. The only thing I did different was make my own marinara sauce which was "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site.

This was wonderful!  Easy, cheesy and flavorful!  I prepared it ahead of time and refrigerated it until an hour before guests arrived.  Baked till bubbly.  Everyone loved it.  My two year old grandson put the ziti on his fingers which, to me, must be the best way to eat it!

This is a great recipe that I will definitely keep.  I omitted the onion due to allergy issues, but it was still great with the meat seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I think I will use more provolone next time.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It's such a nice modification on 'regular' baked ziti - the sour cream and mixture of cheeses add such great flavor. Great for potlucks or to feed a crowd. I'll be making this for years to come.

This recipe is really great and easy. It was short notice for me to try to find a recipe but this one topped them all. I had majority of the ingredients but made a few subsitutions, instead of using sour cream I used ricotta cheese (which someone else suggested also). I didn't have ziti so I used mostaccioli and I also didn't have provolone cheese, only a mexican blend which is good cause it has mozzarella. I followed all the steps and made sure it was covered. My husband kids thought this was soooo good, they said it was my best cooking ever. It's nice when you can put a smile on everyone's face. Thanks so much for the recipe, keep up the good work!

One word...Yum!  You need to cover it before baking, as stated in previous reviews. Needs no additions or subtractions in my opinion.  I have used this with penne pasta too and it tastes wonderful as well.  It is always a home run for me.

This was good, most of my kids liked it, who never like pasta. Only changes: must cover it while baking, next time I will mix the sauce & pasta before layering, and change the sour cream to ricotta cheese. It's like an easy lasagna.

Terrific...made the following changes. 15 oz. of Ricotta cheese mixed with one egg and 1/4 cup milk with tablespoon of parsley.  Also used 12oz of provolone cheese for one layer and the top put 1 pound of mozzarella cheese...we love lots of cheese!

Yum!  A family favorite.  I use a homemade sauce (see World's Best Lasagna for an approximation) and I don't hold back with the provolone and sour cream!

My first time making ziti, and I was thrilled with the results!  Will use a different sauce next time as the one I chose was extremely high in fat and calories so I couldn't eat as many left-overs as I would like  :(  My only change was using plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream because that's what I had on hand - it was still delicious!

Excellent recipe!!!!! I followed recipe as it called for. I got the provolone cheese sliced thick in the deli at publix which made the casserole very thick and yummy!!!! This is the best baked Ziti recipe I have ever made.

Read other reviews, so after cooking ground beef with onion & italian seasonings, salt & pepper I mixed in the spaghetti sauce then mixed this( all except 1 full cup of it that I reserved) with the cooked ziti then put on the sour cream & layered the cheeses. Ended by topping with the very full cup of reserved meat sauce & sprinkled on generously the parmesan cheese. Sprayed tin foil with cookin oil spray & covered. Placed in preheated 350* oven on a large preheated cookie sheet & baked covered for 20 minutes, uncovered & finished baking until top was slightly browned. Served with sauted zucchini squash & garlic toast for sides.Two grown men & myself found this very tasty with enough left over to freeze for another meal in the future. Thanks for a good recipe.

I love pasta and ziti and anything with cheese.  My daughter isn't a fan of ricotta so I was thrilled to see a recipe that didn't require it but when baked the sour cream looked like ricotta to her...so although I love any version of ziti...to me and her - this is just as good as the ricotta versions.   Will make again - when daughter isnt' home. Ha!

The secret layer of sourcream and layered provolone give this recipe an edge over traditional baked ziti. When sauce combine with ricotta, the cheese can dry out and absorb the sauce. This method keeps everything bubbly and juicy. The melted cheeses are not lost in the dish. Reheating leftovers yields the same results of a moist and flavorful baked ziti. A genrous sprinkling of fresh chopped basil and/or parsley once it comes out of the oven adds a nice flavor and presentation. I have also blended my sourcream with goat cheese and cottage cheese before to add more tang and flavorful creaminess. But the recipes in its' original form is just perfect too!

This recipe is awesome! It is inexpensive, easy, and it can be made ahead of time. The kids loved it...  Better the second day :) I did add some fresh garlic and black olives the second time, though I must say my family is a bit garlic and black olive crazy.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of beef to cut down on the fat.  I think next time I will try mixing all the ingredients instead of layering them.  This recipe makes A LOT, so much it bubbled out over the top of the pan because it was so full.  I will place a piece of foil underneath next time :)

Absolutely delicious!!! A couple of things I did different, was use only 1 jar of pasta sauce. I actually had 2 on hand, but felt that it would be a bit too runny if I used 2. I used 1 and it was just the right consistency for us. Also, I used mild cheddar cheese instead of provolone because that was what I had on hand. I will definitely make sure to have provolone the next time I make this. It was SO good, and took no time at all to prepare. This will definitely go into my rotation.  Thank you!

This is by far my favorite Baked Ziti recipe. The sour cream is so much better than the ricotta. It's also pretty easy to prepare. We've been using this recipe for a couple years now and wouldn't change a thing!

My husband and kids loved this recipes. I used low fat cheese and sour cream. That is the only change.

I gave this recipe to my husband to fix.  It was very easy for him to follow.  And when I got home from work, dinner was ready.  It was very good.  My husband really loved it.  We decided that next time we will use spicy turkey sausage instead of hamburger next time.

Very simple to make and it tastes oh so good. I did everything accordingly except I added a ton of parmesan, provolone, and mozzarella cheese to the top. So so good...

Was a wonderful recipe. Im not sure its a 5 star but I will certainly make this again. We had many left overs but not a crumb wasted. Very moist for ziti and very cheesy. Loved it!!!!! Also I kept the sour cream and it turned out very good. For those who were iffy about it.....just try it.

This is the best recipe so far I had tried on Allrecipe. My husband loves it.   I followed basically the recipe as per stated. Although, I added pepper & garlic powder to the meat while browning them. Also, I covered it for 20mins during baking and uncovered it for the last 10mins.  The result was amazing. I love the taste of the sour cream. Very flavorish indeed!

This was great! I did follow some other reviews and added some sauce before the provolone. Also I used whole wheat pasta (it was what I had at hand:). It was EXCELLENT!

LOVE this recipe!  I think the key is the sour cream and provolone.  I also add the cheese topping the last 10 minutes of baking so it's my favorite consistency for serving.  I use this recipe for huge crowds as I'm usually serving families at our house who have 5+ kids.

I've made this twice now and loved it. Super easy and delicious. Definitely season the meat with some italian seasoning, garlic powder...really whatever you like but it needs something more than the onions. It comes out looking like a homemade Italian delicacy but only takes about 20 minutes to prep!

This recipe is original and unique because of the sour cream, if you follow one of the top reviews which recommends ricotta instead...just go make a lasagna for heavens sake! I loved this, as is, just as the recipe states, with sour cream, but changed up the layering order as others have done.  Hubby on the other hand, said he liked it, but thought there might be too much. If you don't love sour cream, maybe cut it back to 1 cup for a thinner layer.

Amazing and easy. I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect. I made way too much for 2.5 people so I took the rest to work and it was raved. People went back for seconds. Definitely a keeper. A great dish to make when guests come for dinner. A little red wine, some garlic bread, followed by tiramisu.

It serves up beautifully, even the first slice. As some others suggested, I mixed the sauce, meat, and pasta all together before putting into the pan. The tomato sauce with extra chunky veggies adds more texture and flavor to the dish.

Great recipe!  You don't have to be exact on the amounts, i.e. don't waste time measuring sour cream, just eye it!  The more the merrier anyway!  Freezes well and a hit when I have taken it to other families!

I also add diced pepperoni and diced red field peppers,it gives the dish a wonderful taste. I have found if you make this and use jarred spaghetti sauce,it helps to add half a cup of water to the sauce.

very good! I did add a jar of mushrooms and a little minced garlic to the meat and onion mixture.  I also did a small layer of sauce on the bottom so the ziti would stay moist.  For my lactose intolerant husband, I used veggie provolone, mozzerella, parmesean and imitation sour cream. He loved it and could not tell the difference!

Absolutely a favorite recipe!  Unlike some, I NEVER bake this covered and it is never dry.  The reason that some might find it dry is the fact that most spaghetti sauce sold in jars have lowered the amount in each jar!  Be careful that you add at least what this recipe calls for!  I have NEVER changed this recipe, except for substituting ground turkey for the ground beef.

I was actually surprised at how great this tasted! Be sure to use a spaghetti sauce that is packed with flavor and defintely season your ground beef. I used italian seasoning and a little garlic. Also, this makes ALOT, it filled up my 9x13 pyrex dish to the very top. SO cheesy and delicious. Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

This is my families favorite Italian dish. The recipe can feed a lot, so I make 1/2 a recipe for my family of four. Add a few teaspoons of Italian Seasoning to the sauce for extra flavor. Dried minced onions in the sauce are a quick alternative to fresh. Yum, yum, yum!

Absolutely amazing! I had 5 people partake in this delicious dish and all LOVED it!  Not to mention, so easy to prepare!  * I accidentally forgot the provolone, so there was the layer of mozarella in the middle and I put the whole 8 oz. of parm. on the top.  PERFECT. Wouldn't want more cheese * Makes lots, too! We are pinching pennies so it's nice to have a couple dinners and a couple lunches out of this! * This will be a regular in our family for years to come!

Excellent! Loved the sour cream in place of the ricotta. I listened to the other reviewers and put sauce on the ziti before I added the provolone. I also made it without beef, and the rest of the family that isn't vegetarian still loved it. Good recipe, can't wait to play with it a little.

Very good! I substituted the sour cream for ricotta cheese, added mushrooms and zucchini to the sauce.

This was a great recipe. I adjusted recipe  amount of sour cream to just a 1/2 cup and added 1.5 cups of low fat ricotta. Additionally, I replaced the provolone slices with a shredded 4 Italian cheese mix and reduced the amount of sauce to 1 jar and added 12oz of diced tomatoes.

Very yummy and easy!  Lots of cheesy-ness.  Next time I might use a bit spicier sauce, or put in a little crushed red pepper flakes.  Just a bit bland, but I do think it was the sauce I used.  Looking forward to making it again!

Very good recipe.  My family really enjoyed this dish.  However, out of preference, I halved the ingredients and I used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.

FANTASTIC!!! I did not change a thing in this recipe! It was fabulous! Hubby loved it because he does not feel any meal is complete unless it has meat in it. He gave rave reviews on this as well!

It was amazing. I added a little extra Parmesan (we really like cheese). It was the best ziti I've ever had. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a great recipe! Everyone who's tried it has given rave reviews. I had some mushrooms that needed to be used so I fried them with some onion & added before the provolone cheese. The sour cream and cheese flavor is out of this world, much better than ricotta. A new favorite!

Baked this recipe last night and it was so delicious and my family absolutely loved it. They even went back for seconds and thirds!:)  It was a very easy meal to pull together and I would make it again and use it for a potluck type meal because it looks nice, taste good, and was easy to cook.  thank You for a five star recipe.

There isn't a time a make this someone isn't asking for the recipe.  Everyone loves it.  I usually add a little more meat to the sauce and sometimes make my own sauce.  Delicious!

I liked this; just finished a huge plate of it. But it was not the amazing taste or flavor I expected from reviews. I thought I should season the meat, but decided to just follow the recipe to the letter (besides adding a dollop of tomato paste and some fresh basil to the sauce). I wish I would have followed my instincts. I think some salt, pepper, garlic, sage, thyme, oregano, etc. in the meat would have enhanced the flavor. I also thought perhaps I would have had different results with a more expensive, flavorful spaghetti sauce, and that was why the recipe by itself was so great. Hopefully next batch (since it's so huge!) will be more flavorful.

I made this tonight with some changes, and it got rave reviews and was instantly added to my family's "favourites" list! I used a homemade tomato sauce I had made a few nights earlier with fresh tomatoes, and followed other reviewers by using half lean beef, half hot italian sausage browned with onion and garlic. Added 1 can of sliced mushrooms, too. Used mozzarella slices with mozza and medium cheddar for the grated cheese because I couldn't find provalone. Other than that, ALL GOOD!! For those having trouble with spreading the sour cream, whip it a bit first in a bowl to cream it.

Great recipe!  Would sub 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef next time.  Followed other suggestions and put sauce on top of ziti instead of cheese.  I also baked covered. Well received by adults and two five year olds.

excellent, followed another reviewer and skipped the sour cream, used ricotta (we are italian food lovers), also skipped the provolone (doesn't agree w/some people:) Also covered it before baking(that's a given). Came out great, leftovers went to work for lunch the next day.

Awesome.  I never thought to use sour cream and provolone.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of prepared sauce & added seasoning.  This is now my go to recipe for Baked Ziti.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this tonight for 150 people. The only thing I did different is I used cut up premade meatballs,no onion,and I used a mozz-prov shredded blend cheese. It was AWESOME!! They all want me to make it again. Thank you!

This is a "keeper" easy and my kids loved it!    I really enjoyed it not overly seasoned, rich, and flavor full.   I was hesitent about the sourcream but was I wrong it was the what "pull it together" in the receipe.   I did add extra meat but that is because I have "teenaged boys" that can out eat adults sometimes! LOL :O)  GIVE it a try you'll love it too... and YES you have to cover it with foil..

Yum. This is a great recipe to feed a crowd. I used penne because ziti was nowhere to be found at my grocery store.  Next time I'll skip the meat and enjoy it vegetarian style.

I almost always tweek recipes but I followed this one to the letter and it was fantastic! I've never heard of using sour cream in a dish like this, but it was wonderful. The dish was creamy & flavorful, everyone in my family loved it.  It's a very simple weeknight meal, but as the recipe states would also be great to bring to a potluck.  Perfect comfort food!

I agree with Bayou Gator (most helpful review), don't change anything about this recipe. I know many people are probably use to using ricotta in a recipe like this and that sour cream + provolone may sound weird, BUT after the sour cream and provolone cook together you basically end up with a cheese mixture that looks identical to ricotta (I think the heat curdles the sour cream) but taste tons better. I did use whole wheat penne (no ziti to be found) and light sour cream (Daisy brand, very good and thick sour cream). The next time I make this I am going to add diced pepperoni and brown with the beef and onion. Thanks for the easy recipe!

It's very good.  I used Rigatoni instead of Ziti.  I mixed the sour cream with a bit of italian cheese blend, basil, pepper, and parm cheese.  Mixed meat sauce with pasta then put a layer of pasta mixture on bottom of pan then spread around the cream mixture then the rest of pasta.  Then cheese; yummy.

This was a delicious tasting Baked Ziti and very easy to prepare.  The only thing I changed was how I layered my dish.  I mixed the pasta sauce mixture with the noodles before layering.  Than I put noodles with sauce, cheese, noodles with sauce and parmesaen cheese.  This way the noodles weren't dried out and the flavoring was mixed very well throughout the ziti.  I will make this again.

This recipie is so yummy!  My family loved it.  I love all of the cheeses in it, too.  Make sure you have a deep dish to put it in though.  It fills right up to the top of a normal dish.

I made this recipe today and it was very good. I gave it four stars because I added some extra ingredients to make the sauce better. Though the sauce was very good I felt that it empowered the taste of the cheese in this dish. Next time I will use a good jar of sauce and use just that. Besides that it was very good and just make sure to cover it with aluminum foil because the recipe doesnt say so. I will definitely use this recipe again. Yum!

This was really good, pretty easy, and pretty economical too.  I find sour cream on sale a lot, and was able to get a chunk of mozzarella and a few slices of provolone cheese from the deli counter for way less than having to buy large amounts of either.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy, so cheap, so good.  My hubby and 3 year old ate up all the leftovers, which is super rare in this family!!!  I actually used Penne instead of Ziti b/c Ziti was hard for me to find???

My family really liked this recipe and it was pretty easy to make.  My husband doesn't like Ricotta Cheese so I was excited when I saw this recipe called for sour cream and provolone.  Next time I make it, I'm going to add some garlic and italian seasoning for an extra zing.

Loved this recipe! The sour creams adds a great taste that I wouldn't have thought of.  I covered the dish with foil for the first 20 minutes of baking  then removed it for the last 10. Used cooking spray on the foil so the cheese wouldn't stick to it. It would have been dried out if I hadn't done that.

This recipe was excellent!  My entire family just raved for days how good this was.  I did toss in a few extra seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, and italian seasoning) when I browned the meat.  That is the only variation I made.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe!!!!

I made this for a Super Bowl party I went to...and it was a hit!!  No leftovers and people went back for seconds and thirds.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and the only thing I would change is that I would add some garlic.  (I cook all my pastas with garlic)

Wonderful!  My family loves this dish.  I use swiss cheese instead of the cheeses recommended and it turns out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was prepared to give this 4 stars - mainly because of the use of jar sauce.  But with the tons of compliments from the kids and hubby, changed it to 5.  So simple - very yummy.  (I used tomato and garlic flavored sauce.)

This is by far my favorite baked ziti recipe!  I always double the amount of all the cheeses...we're a cheese loving family.  And, I only use 1 - 26 oz jar of sauce.  So good!

This recipes was surprisingly good.  I also changed a few things that made it great - used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and added a few extra cloves of chopped garlic.  I used a four cheese sauce that went very nicely with this recipe.  I would not have known to cover this dish either without reading several of the other reviews.  I depend a lot on details like that, so it is important to include as you never know what little thing is going to completely change the recipe.   Also, I used penne pasta instead of ziti.  I'm not entirely sure that there is a difference unless it is in size, but I was unable to find penne pasta.  In any case, this was a very easy and tasty recipe that I will definitely make again.

I made this pasta according to LP's review, layering like the suggestion and it came out very good like that, nice and moist, covered it too. I also used the ricotta/egg instead of the sour cream. However I give it 3 stars according to my "doctoring" of the recipe. I thought from the start that it would be bland - no spices, what's with that, onion is not enough!!!! So I added oregano and basil to the sauce and a few dashes of Louisiana pepper sauce, just 5 or 6. Mind you I DOUBLED the recipe to fit a large All- Clad turkey roasting pan. The result - bland sauce. I didn't add enough of the spices. My fault. But I also put 8 cups of mozz. cheese in this thing, no way 6 oz for a regular batch would be enough if you like cheese!!!! and the 8 c. I used was still not enough in my husband's eyes. (What can I say, he loves mozz. cheese). There will be a next time, but I think I will add more oregano and basil to the sauce, and a bit more hot sauce as I want to have a "kick" to the recipe. Made plenty, and I froze the rest, reheat frozen in the casserole covered at 350 for 1 hour. Good recipe - thanks!!!!

Very good. I accidentally didn't read the recipe correctly and used way too much sour cream.  It was still good though, but a little overkill.  I am sure if i followed the recipe correctly it would have been perfect.  Next time I might try others ideas and put some garlic in with the hamburger and sauce.

This is a favorite in out house! The only changes I made is I added some garlic to the onions and meat.  I also don't use sour cream, but use ricotta cheese.  I prefer the taste of the ricotta cheese.

I thought this was good. I've seen this recipe on the back of a Ziti pasta box at the store.  For some viewers comments about using Ricotta, we all add and take things away from a recipe to suit our liking.  I personally make this dish and lasagna with fat free Cottage Cheese because Fat free tends to be dryer then 1/2 or full fat.  If you taste plain cottage cheese vs. sour cream, they are very similiar in taste.  This recipe is really good and personally don't like  using ricotta because I think it's dry unless of course you are getting the freshly made Ricotta from a special food store.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I too substituted the sour cream for ricotta and it was great. I also know to cover dishes like these when you bake so no problems there. It is an EXCELLENT "take to lunch the next day" dish. Everyone at work was jealous of my leftovers :)

This is a delicious recipe that I will use over and over! I followed other reviewers' advice and mixed half of the sauce with the pasta before layering it, to make sure that it was evenly coated. It worked well. I also really enjoyed the sour cream which I was initially hesitant about.

Delicious! This was super easy to make and lasted my boyfriend and I 3 meals a piece. I couldn't find ziti so I used penne instead. We also omitted the ground beef. Only problem was that we had to cook it extra long because the dish was so big. Overall, wonderful recipe and will definitely make again!

Family loved this recipe, I forgot to take it to the store with me but happily found it to be the same as on the store brand ziti box from the store. It has become one of the more requested meals in the house. I have substituted the sour cream with ricotta a couple of times.

Really easy and delicious.  The sour cream and provolone make it different than traditional ziti with ricotta.  I will be making this again!

I've made this recipe a few times now and it's just great!  It has all the gooey cheese and sauce just oozing from the every bite.  I followed it to a 'T'.  And it does make a lot! I had to use a smaller baking dish to put the rest that didn't fit in my casserole dish. Will def. make again and again!

Turned out great!  I too was worried about the sour cream but it was a perfect part of the recipe.  I added some hot Italian sausage as many other commenters did.  Thank you Colleen!

This has been a constant repeat for me.  Since there are only two of us I freeze it in individual portions in my foodsaver bags and they make great leftovers for easy dinners and lunches.

You could easily half this recipe for a family of four, or divide it in two. Eat one and freeze the part you don't need.

Good recipe. I used Ricotta cheese instead of Sour Cream. Definitely need 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, I used 1.5 jars and it was dry. I'll make it again.

I didn't like the sour cream in it.  Next time I will try ricotta cheese instead, which I'm sure I will like more.

This was delicious with the changes I made.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think it would have been a bit bland without the modifications below:  I used 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb. hot Italian sausage.  Instead of layering the ingredients, I saved time by mixing the cooked pasta with the tomato sauce, 1 cup sour cream, and about half of the cheese.  I also added salt, pepper, and other Italian seasonings.  I added the rest of the cheese on top, and removed the aluminum foil for about 5 minutes at the end so the cheese got lightly browned.  I put this in a 9x13 pan but it was nearly overflowing, so I would suggest cutting in half or using 2 pans.  It turned out really well and is great as leftovers too.

Not quite what I thought it would taste like.  I prefer more home-made tastes...but would do it again as a last resort meal for the kids.  They liked it.

Loved It! Will make often. I did make a few changes in my version.  I added 1/4 lb of italian sausage. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic and one can of tomato sauce & added italian seasoning blend in place of one jar of spaghetti sauce. I also added lots of fresh shredded parmesean cheese just because we LOVE cheese! I also added italian seasoning blend to the sour cream. Even my 2 year old ate it!

The sour cream makes the Ziti taste bland and almost bitter, I would recommend using Ricotta cheese instead of the sour cream or even cutting the sour cream by half. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Easy recipe to follow.  I followed other users' directions and made some substitutions using italian sausage, ricotta cheese with the sour cream, and changing the layering order.  I also added some ceyenne pepper to the sauce.  Turned out great! Thanks!

I made this tonight for dinner. I was a little hesitant at first to use the sour cream but I am glad that I did.  It was perfect! I was also going to make a smaller amount of it but I am glad that I didn't because now we have leftovers for the week! I will definitely make this again and want to make it for a party or something so lots of people I know can enjoy it too.

I omitted the provolone cheese and used a pound of ground sweet Italian chicken sausage instead of hamburger.  I also used a 15 ounce container of ricotta with one egg mixed in and only a 1/2 cup sour cream.  Finally I added two tablespoons of pesto which added to the robust "Old World" Italian flavor.  My very picky husband and three year old son loved it!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I made this for a pot luck and it was a big hit.  I tried to make this dish a little healthier by using light sour cream and reduced fat cheeses.  I also used 93/7 ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I will definitely make this dish again.  =)

Made this on a cold, snowy evening for a good comfort-food dinner.  Baked ziti is usually something my husband makes - he follows a recipe off the back of a noodle box.  We followed this new recipe to a T.  I honestly felt it was just too rich.   I do not think we will make this again.

I followed the tips on layering some sauce first, and true to grams heritege, used ricotta/egg instead of the sour cream as well.

This recipe was easy to make but didn't taste quite right. The layering was different. I would not make this again.

This recipe was great! I followed a few other tips from previous viewers and layed the cheese differently and also mixed the pasta with the sauce. This dish was easy to make and since I live in a small studio in the city it was very simple with the small space!

I enjoyed this a lot. I followed it pretty faithfully except I left out the meat entirely. It still made a lot of food! I loathe ricotta with a passion so I was happy when the sour cream worked in this recipe - no more ricotta, ever!

Easy & great tasting! I even messed up and put half the amount of sour cream in and it was still great.

Excellent pasta dish!  The sour cream gives it a smooth finished flavor.  Very easy to assemble and economical as well.  I'll be making this one again and again.

Excellent recipe! All 10 people at my house on Christmas loved it! I was tired of making the "same old" baked ziti and sometimes having it come out dry. The sour cream was terrific and made it taste so good and definitely not dry. It was creamy. Having the provolone instead of just mozzarella was also good. We loved it. Thanks

AWESOME!! I have made this for my family and boyfriend and they couldn't get enough. They absolutely loved it. It was super easy to make and tastes great. The only exception I made was to use 1 jar of sauce and I used 1 cup of sour cream (as I'm not a huge sour cream fan). I'd definitely recommend this recipe! :)

VERY YUMMY. Only one change I would make- ROTEL. I like my food a little spicier so i think that maybe a little Rotel would make this recipe PERFECT!

I make this on a regular basis and everyone LOVES it!! I usually cut out the provolone and use extra mozzarella cheese. Make sure you put sauce on the bottom of the pan so it doesn't stick. I just layer to my liking.  Also, if you want I have put in some spicy sausage and garlic powder in the meat mixture for a little extra kick. Either way, this is a fabulous recipe and I will be making it forever!

This was good, I used whole wheat penne instead of ziti because of availability. We also make it without the meat. I will try it next time with carrots or something to substitute for the meat, that will help it be a little less "saucy". Overall very good and easy.

This is what I take to someone who is ill, has had a baby, etc. because it's so basic that almost everyone likes it and it freezes really well if they want to save it for later.  Another bonus is that this recipe makes so much that I get two pans full so my family's dinner is done too!  I mix the pasta with the sauce before layering it.

Outstanding, my husband is not a big pasta person but has asked for this several times now. I did add some cream cheese but that is because I eat cream cheese on anything and everything.
Thanks for sharing this one, big hit at our house

This is a great recipe!  I did make a few changes.  I used 1lb of italian sausage and 1lb of lean ground beef.  I also used a low sugar spaghetti sauce and it tasted great.  I did mix a bit of the sauce mixture with the bottom layer of pasta.  Make sure you cover with foil while baking.  I used a fairly large casserole dish and it filled it.  This recipe fed 6 of us for 2 nights.

Absolutely the best baked ziti I have ever eaten. The sour cream and provolone add so much more flavor and moisture than the traditional ricotta. I used ground sausage instead of ground beef, and added in three cloves of minced garlic with the onion and meat. Also, after reading some other reviews, I mixed the sauce with the ziti for the bottom layer, then provolone, sour cream, sauce/ziti, and topped with mozzarella and parmesan. Wonderful.

This was delicious!  I made 2 separate dishes, one with 1 lb. beef and the other with shredded zucchini (I'm vegetarian).  I just split the noodles and added 1 jar of sauce to each different mixture.  I also mixed the noodles in with the sauce mixture before adding to the baking dish.  And I used ricotta instead of sour cream.  Delicious and super easy!  I will definitely be making this again! :)

My kids really loved this dish. The greatest part about it is 1. It is easy to make, and 2. you don't have to hunt like a mad woman to find the ingredients.  Most the ingredients I had right in my kitchen.

Yummy!!  Read the reviews first and the only change I make is to put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the dish, just like when making lasagna.  I follow rest of directions like written & it's never been dry.  Think of it as a quicker, easier lasagna.

This meal was fantastic!  The provelone and sour cream mixture was heaven!  My fiance enjoyed the dish very much!  It made a ton so we immediately froze half.  A few weeks later, it was still very, very tasty.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was really easy to make and really good.  Now that I have the recipe I'll play around to find the best combo of jarred sauce and meat b/c I made some bad choices.  The sauce I chose was too chunky for the recipe and I used sweet turkey sausage removed from the casings. Even with the bad choices it still tasted great which was amazing to me.  I'm going to try ground beef or the hot turkey sausage next time and definitely a smoother sauce that's less sweet.

Super yummy! I don't think you need to cover the dish. I did for 25 minutes, then uncovered for the last 5 but it didn't brown so nicely. Overall, it was very delicious and the sour cream acted like ricotta.

I don't agree with the replacement of ricotta and removing any of the cheeses.  Although this might not be "authentic" Italian it's still a really good ziti recipe that everyone I serve to loves.  Nobody even knows the sour cream is sour cream they think it is ricotta.  Also, you do not have to bake it covered for the fear of drying out like previous post states.  As long as you cover all the noodles with the sauce you should be fine.  I have made this dish several time and never covered it.

I loved this and so did my family.  My brother who doesn't like lasagna, now loves baked Ziti.  It is awesome.  I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey and it was still fabulous.

Loved this dish. Made a few changes. Used low fat cottage cheese instead of sour cream and ground turkey instead of ground beef. Next time will add more veggies!

This was good but even in a bigger dish there was way too much of it. Also took longer to bake. Tasted good but will halve the recipe if I make it again.

I enjoyed this recipe!  Definitely use a much larger dish or the ziti will be falling all over the place!  I added garlic to the onions and substituted low fat cottage cheese for the provolone and sour cream and it worked great.  I also used shredded mozzarella instead of the parmesan cheese.

This is the absolute best! It also makes quite a bit, so I only prepare a half recipe (being that I am the only one eating it) and it still lasts me all week for lunches.  I also add in extra spices to the sauce, chili powder to taste (a must for really good spaghetti sauce), garlic powder, oregano, etc. until I feel it has an explosion of flavor.

I love it!  I used Ricotta instead of provolone cheese, added hot italian sausage, then sprinkle a little of dried basil.  Dont forget to cover with foil before you bake.  Thanks for the recipe!

ahh! i loved it!:) 
I used shredded cheese for both.  
giant eagle market district spaghetti sauce 1 jar spicy tomato and 1 jar tomato basil.  it was awesome!! I used spicy italian sausage because that's what i like but next time i think i will make with ground beef because i think other people like that better.  I think i'll try it with ricotta cheese instead of sour cream.  

thanks for this recipe!! i love love loved it!:)

I made this for a little get together and it came out FANTASTIC!!! Was kinda leary about the sour cream...almost used ricotta but I am so glad I didn't!!  
I did mix the sauce with the ziti just to make sure they dont dry out, I also sauteed garlic with the onion and added italian seasonings in the sauce.  I was probably a little gererous with the cheese as well!!  I will make this AGAIN!

I've always had ziti made with ricotta so I was a little skeptical about provolone and sour cream.  This is the best baked ziti I've ever had.  I did use half sausage, half ground beef.  Every time I make this for someone new they ask me for the recipe.

Excellent idea and I like how easy it is to bring a change to my usual lasagna recipe. I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream and provolone. Cooked and sliced italian sweet sausage instead of beef. And I used penne because I didn't have any ziti on hand. Came out beautifully, and there is TONS of leftovers, so I'll be freezing some for another day when I can't be bothered to do more than use the microwave.

could benefit from more cheese.  I made it without meat, and had too much sauce.  So if omitting meat, decrease sauce.

This was very good!  I don't think that I added enough cheese so I'll add more next time, but the family loved it!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except that I covered the dish.  I thought it was pretty tasty, but more importantly, it was really easy to make.

I've made this many times because my whole family loves it and it's easy to make.  The only change I make is in the layering (as others have suggested).  I layer as follows - 1/2 noodles, 1/2 sauce, provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 noodles, 1/2 sauce, mozarella cheese.  Awesome recipe - thanks!

This recipe was fantastic!  My very picky family had more than one serving.  I used Bertolli portobello mushroom with Merlot sauce and added some garlic powder, salt and Italian seasoning.  This one's a keeper.

I just got done making this and tried it as soon as it came out of the oven. It's awesome! I love the sour cream taste. I think using Ricotta, like some reviewers did, would just make it taste like lasagna. The only problem I encountered was trying to spread the cream cheese on top of a layer of shredded cheese. It picked up all the cheese and it just became a mess. Did I do the layers wrong? Other than that, it tastes great! Definitely a keeper.

Very good!  I made without hamburger and served with "My Mom's Parm Chicken" from here.  Followed recipe and this is a great ziti recipe I have been searching for...will become a regular in my house now.  I think I will try adding spinach like some reviews did, and I did add garlic but that is personal preference.  Very good quality recipe.

I am very inexperienced in cooking and this was easy and DELICIOUS! I used ground turkey instead because I don't eat beef. I gave the leftovers to my parents (this makes a lot of food!)and they had no clue it was turkey! Very good and highly recommended!

This was excellent! We used Ricotta instead of sour cream and put sauce on the bottom of the pan. We also browned the meat with garlic and Mrs. Dash seasonings. Will certainly make again! Thank you!

It was great! Substituted chicken and rotini and only used the mozzarella and parm and it turned out great.  I also used some Italian herbs to season the chicken.  Easy to make and appeals to many people.

It's GOOD. Used 1 lb of Italian Sausage instead of the Ground Beef. Makes plenty to feed an ARMY and also freezes well. You can cut the recipe in half and still have enough for 6-8 people to eat.

You can do so many things with this recipe. I usually use up my leftover spaghetti & meatballs. After cooking the noodles I toss them with ricotta so it gets inside the noodles. Haven't tried it with the provolone yet. But I use mozzerella & parm.

Great and simple recipe. I substituted crumbled tofu for the beef and it gave it a great I messed up the top layer and did the sauce and cheese backwards but it was still quite good. I mixed 1/3 of the sauce with the bottom layer of noodles so that they wouldn't be dry.

Used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef. Added onion and 3 cloves garlic to meat. Used Classico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce.  Added fresh basil, thyme, oregano, and pinch of red pepper flakes. Mixed sauce with pasta.  Cut the sour cream with 1/2 ricotta. Turned out awesome!!! Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Awesome ziti recipe!  My hubby loved it! It is very filling, however, and this was way more than 8 servings for us.  I'll probably only make half of it next time.

Well, I made my own sauce from another recipe here - World's Best Pasta Sauce (i think that was the sauce recipe I used).  I just can't do jarred sauce anymore!  The ziti came out superb.  Both husband and son said it was better than a restaurant.  And while I usually am not impressed by my cooking, I was really proud of this dish!  A must-have!

My husband loved this, the kids even ate it.  I thought is was good just not quite knock my socks off good. Worth making though. I used one pot so that I wouldn't have too much clean up. Boiled my pasta, drained it & left it in the sink then cooked the ground beef in that pot. I combined the pasta with the sauce then layered the cheese. I don't think I added enough provolone, will add more next time.

Gooey with lots and lots of cheese.  It was delicious but I couldn't eat too much of it since it is such a heavy dish.  This is a good dish to take to a potluck or for a party.

We loved this meal! We made it for company and they ended up taking some leftovers home themselves! The only changes I made were to add some chopped garlic in with the onions, (I add garlic to anything anyway!!), and I substituted turkey for the beef and also added some italian sausage for a little extra flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. Delicious!

I made this recipe last night.  Them only thing I might change is putting a little mozzarella on top.  Also maybe putting 1/2 ziti, then sauce then provolone.  Also, It makes a lot.  I usually hate beef and sauce together and I couldn't get enough of this.  The Family does too! Also, I didn't cover it with foil and it wasnt dry. Definately a keeper.

This has become a regular for us.  I like to use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 italian sausage.  I also add additional seasonings to whichever sauce I use (e.g. basil and oregano) to make it more flavorful.  I'll try adding ricotta cheese next time.

Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

This recipe is awesome.  It is so tasty that when I make it, my husband and I will eat it for dinner and then we can't stay out of it for the rest of the night.  It is that good.  Whoever wrote the note about covering the dish, thank you.  This dish does take some time to make, but it is sooo worth it.

This was an excellent recipe and the first one I have tried here on allrecipes.com. It can easily be adapted to your own tastes. I made just a couple adjustments because of the reviews I read. I stirred the ziti and sauce together and put some italian seasoning, garlic powder and pepper on the meat. My boyfriend is a huge fan of italian food and I am always looking for something to make other than spaghetti. Thanks!!

Made this for a family picnic and it was a hit. I added shredded summer squash into the sauce mixture, and some mushrooms .  Definitely will make again.

Made this for a party as the main dish - everyone loved it and commented on it.  I used zesty sauce to give it a little more flavor.  Easy to make, and it makes a lot.  A definite keeper.

Wow! Yummy! Yummy!! This was my first time making ziti.  I used fresh mozzarella, provolone & Parmesan  cheese.  I used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 ricotta cheese. When browning the meat I tossed 3 tbsp of fresh minced garlic, followed by some basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and some salt.  Be picky when choosing the spaghetti sauce.  I chose Napa Valley Bistro-tomato & basil.  Very tasty!  I made my own garlic bread. French bread, 5 tbsp of melted butter, 3 tbs of olive oil, 3 tbsp of fresh garlic, & basil. Spread over French bread and bake.  Wonderful!

This has to be the best ziti recipe I have come across. I have made this dish over and over again, and have had several requests to make it for parties. My only suggestion for chesse lovers is to top the dish with different cheeses, makes it more tasteful.

Very good recipe.  I used my own sauce I make for spaghetti.  I wasn't sure about the sour cream, but when it cooked it seemed like ricotta.  Will make again.

I made this dish for my daughters first birthday party 3 years ago and now I'm making it for my son's first birthday party. It was a hit and whatever I had left over (I doubled the recipe) heated up very well the next day.  I was able to prepare the dish the night before and stick it in the fridge so all I had to do was to put it in the oven for the party.  I have passed this recipe to my friends and it will continue to be a favorite of mine.

This is a VERY good basic recipe.  I was looking for something to use up the ingredients I already had around the house, and this fit the bill.  I only changed a few things.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the sour cream, I cut out the ground beef and just went vegetarian, and I made my own spaghetti sauce.  

Also, because it is only my husband and I, I cut the recipe in half.  He LOVED it, couldn't stop commenting about it.  In fact, he commented about it again the next morning!

This was the best ever.  I don't like ricotta so the sour cream I guess was a substitute.  The whole family loved it, all 5 of us.  Made a lot so we had the neighbors over for lunch the next day.  Very easy.

I gave this 4 stars only because my family and I aren't huge sour cream fans, otherwise it's a 5. We cut the amount of sour cream in 1/2.  However, I have made this for many friends and neighbors.  Everyone asks for the recipe!  This meal feeds my family throughout the week!

This was delicious!  I made my own meat sauce and I covered it for 15 minutes, then uncovered it for 15 minutes more, and melted mozzarella cheese on top so it was gooey.  It lasted well over a week!

This was really yummy! Biggest change I made: you definitely need to mix the sauce mixture with the noodles before putting it in the pan. Otherwise it will end up being extremely dried out. This was delicious and I will definitely make it again. Also, this makes far too much for just two people so if I make it again, I may only make half as much.

Absolutely delicious. I did not change a thing!! I served with garlic bread and it tasted amazing!! Next time I will use the advice from others and put the sauce mixture directly on the ziti and add some garlic.

I really didn't enjoy this recipe. I love onion but felt it didn't taste like what I expect Italian food to taste like -- a little sweet (did not use sweet onions). Also, it made enough for two huge casseroles. Unfortunately, I won't be making this again.

This was very good and will be my staple ziti recipe from now on.  I used turkey burger and my own sauce, and layered the ingredients according to other reviewers' suggestions.  Ziti has a tendency of drying out and I think the sour cream helps to keep it moist.  And you simply can't go wrong with provolone cheese, mmm!

This is delicious and the recipe makes a huge batch.  I couldn't stop eating it.  So is separated it into batches and put them in the freezer for future meals.  I also had enough left to give  three neighbors. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Another 5 stars!!!  I made this recipe as directed using penne pasta.  I was thinking there would be too much pasta and it would be dry but there was plenty of sauce.  Even left-overs heated up in the microwave were still as good. I'll be making this again!!!!

This was so awesome!  I can't believe something so simple to make tastes so good!  My husband said he'd like to have it again; I told him he would--tomorrow night!  (There is just the 2 of us, so we have leftovers the next night.)  I made my own spaghetti sauce and used rigatoni because that was what I had on hand.  I would serve this for guests.  With a tossed salad, it made a great meal!

This was really good! Firstly I changed the recipe for 4 servings since everyone said this made alot. I also used meatballs I had in the freezer in place of the hamburger and didn't add onion as the meatballs already had some. I followed others advise and put the sauce ontop of the noodles and mixed it in on the first layer only. Then I followed with the cheese and sour cream. Also I did not grease the dish in anyway at all. I also covered it but next time I won't as this was really "saucy". My DH LOVED this and ate the rest for lunch today. And he never eats leftovers.

Fantastic! I used hot italian sausage, as suggested by other reviewers, prego garlic and herb pasta sauce, added fresh garlic to the meat and substituted ricotta because we were out of sour cream. If you are only cooking for two, definitely cut the recipe in half- we had enough for us, seconds and dinner tonight!

I wish I could rate this recipe higher!  This is so easy and comes out perfect every time.  Everyone is my family LOVES this and requests it at least once a month.  The only simple things I changed were to add garlic (no Italian dish should be without garlic) and I use 2 cups of sour cream to make it very creamy.  Just be warned this does make more than 8 servings!

This is the best ziti ever.  I use a pasta sauce that has sausage in it already (I think that it is Prego).  Other than that, I follow the recipe.  It reheats wonderfully!!!  My little ones even scarf down this meal.  It is a keeper with my family.

This was the first recipe I ever made from AR.  This is top notch - my family always requests it and goes back for more.  It does make a large pan, but it's just as great leftover.  Thanks for an awesome recipe that's easy too.

I made this as it is written - but with my own sauce. And I may have added a little extra on the cheeses, but I tried to stick to the recipe as it is written. I was very satisfied with the outcome. That was two days ago, and I am making it again tonight. I would say this is a hit. Thank you for sharing it.

My first time for baked ziti.  Needed to use up some previously prepared Lots O' Veggies Sausage Spaghetti Sauce.  Since the sauce had a bit of meat, I didn't use additional meat.  We like this recipe, although I didn't have the proper dish.  (Only had a deep casserole available.)  The only problem I had was that the sliced cheese made a definite layer, in places a little chewy...and maybe not enough sauce on the first layer, but that may have been because of the dish I used.  Overall we really enjoyed this recipe and agree that it's a great alternative to lasagna:  same concept, many of the same ingredients, with a lot less time and trouble.

I've made this recipes several times because its great for potlucks and large family get togethers. I did find the Ziti noodles to expand too much so I used Penne noodles instead. I also used italian sausage instead of ground beef because I like a little more spice. Thank you Colleen!

Made this for three adults and 4 kids. The kids liked it ok, the adults all loved it.  Tastes like lasagna to me.  I had two smaller pans I used and it completely filled both. We ate one and have the other leftover for tomorrow.  The first one was a bit runny on the bottom, maybe I over buttered the pan or didn't cook it quite long enough, it was still good though. Will make again!

Awesome, easy recipe. I found that the sour cream / mozzarella layer really resembled ricotta cheese. This is basically like a semi-homemade lasagna-type dish.

I liked this recipe. I tried to make it a LITTLE healthier by substituting whole grain pasta. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. I also made my own sauce with less sodium than the store bought stuff. Overall, a nice basic recipe.

We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe. It definitely makes a lot and tastes great reheated. There is nothing that needs to be changed in this recipe. We use the "Sweet Basil" tomato sauce from Classico and really enjoy it. My picky 3 year old always asks for more and we always share this recipe. Make this tonight! You won't be disappointed! :-)

This was easy and delicious. I was skeptical about the sour cream, but really glad I used that and not ricotta. Didn't need a ton, so I halved everything and followed the recipe except for 2 small things.  I had a leftover cooked hot Italian sausage that I diced up and added to the meat sauce.  That gave things a nice little kick. I also mixed just a couple of scoops of sauce in with the pasta before layering so they weren't dry. It all fit perfectly in an 8x8 Pyrex dish and still cooked for the 30 minutes covered with foil.  Can't wait to make this again. Thanks!

This is a great recipe and made enough to stick an extra in the freezer for a quick dinner later.  My 10 year old loved and proclaimed it to be "better than restaurant food"!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so simple that you can make a lot of substitutions based on whatever you have in the fridge.  I only had sharp cheddar cheese, turkey sausage, and nonfat sour cream.  I mixed the pasta with the sauce/meat mixture and layered everything else according to the recipe.  A lot of flavor with so few ingredients.

I had many compliments on this dish.  We thought this ziti was terrific!  I followed the recipe exactly.  But this time I made it for a 100 people so I adjusted the recipe to 50 servings.  It made 6 aluminum pan 9x13 casseroles.  There were close to 100 people at the event. We had 3 casseroles left over.  Keep in mind there were many other dishes.  I always seem to struggle with converting recipes, so now I know. As others have said this makes a lot of food. Thanks for the tasty dish. The leftovers will be my dish to pass on Memorial Day!

I've made this dish a few times now.  It gets better every time I make it.  My fiancee absolutely loves it!!!  It makes ALOT so I usually freeze the leftovers.  The leftovers taste better.  I have used ziti, rotini, penne, rigatoni and wheat .  I do add some mushrooms, bell peppers, Emeril's spicy sausage to the sauce.  This is my favorite recipe!

LOVE THIS!  i make it for everyone.  even though i can't cook for the life of me, everyone thinks i'm a pro.  haha.  tastes like lasagna but with MUCH less work.  i make it when i crave lasagna but don't have the time for it.

tastes even better when you let it stay overnight.  i usually put it in a large lasagna pan and there's definitely more than enough to put it in another smaller cake or brownie pan.  put it in the freezer for another time!

I followed other reviews and mixed the sauce with the pasta before layering. My husband and I enjoyed this at dinner - but we both had terrible stomach aches in the middle of the night - I think it's too cheesy and fattening for us.

I love the creamy layers. The provolone cheese and sour cream layer is the best. This has become a favorite. I use a jarred sauce that is made for "baked dishes".

Delicious. I made this in the morning, kept it in the fridge and then baked it when I got home in the evening. Very filling, makes a TON. Next time I will add mushrooms.

This recipe is delicious!  Tonight was the second time I have made it, and it turned out even better than the first time.
Per some suggestions in other reviews, I added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the ground beef as it was cooking.  Also, I bought one huge jar of Prego traditional rather than 2 16 oz ones.  This gave me a little bit of extra sauce, which I used to coat the bottom of the pan before adding the noodles.  I also added the sauce on top of the noodle layers, rather than on top of the provolone layer.  For the mozzarella on top, I used 2 cups instead of just 6 oz (I prefer reallt cheesey dishes).  
I only cooked it for 45 minutes uncovered, which allowed the mozzarella and permesan to brown to perfection.  The dish is huge, so definitely be prepared to have lots of leftovers (I only made it for two).

Very good! My kids said they would eat this every week. Made enough for at least 8 people. I made 3 adjustments: used italian sausage instead of hamburger. Sprinkled fresh chopped basil on top before the parmesan. And sprinkled some fresh grated romano cheese.

This was great, but I only used one jar of sauce since the sauce I use is from a local restaurant where I used to live in PA (I import to FL all the time) and it is really thick, so I added about a cup of water to think the sauce out a bit.  It seemed to be the perfect amount.  Two jars would be way too much.  My husband qualified this one as a "do again".  I think next time I'm going to try to alter this recipe and make a veggie version of this.

This stuff is amazing! I usually hate sour cream, but gave the recipe a try since it had so many great reviews. Absolutely delicious!

I didn't make any alterations, since I was cooking for my boyfriend, but you could easily substitute low fat sour cream, use less cheese, and use whole wheat pasta for a healthier version, without sacrificing TOO much flavor.

The base of this recipe is fantastic. I altered/augmented with some garlic, bell pepper and fresh basil. You won't be disappointed.

Wonderful!  Would reduce the cheese next time out of personal preference.  Made this with sweet Italian sausage this time.

Wow--this was great! That being said, I did change the recipe a bit. I added a few cloves of minced garlic to the browning meat, and substituted ground turkey for beef. Also added chopped mushrooms and zucchini, and used ricotta cheese instead of sour cream. Despite the additions, I still wanted to rate this, because it was SO tasty!

This was very good. However, I didn't use jarred sauce.  I just can't do it.  I made sauce ahead of time and used that.  I also mixed the ziti in with the sauce, reserving a cup or so of sauce to place on the top.

We have made this twice now and really enjoy this recipe.  I omit the provolone cheese (just to make it one less thing I have to buy since it's the only thing we don't regularly have on hand at our house,) and the second time I made it I also added some spices to the meat to jazz it up a little bit.  This ziti is a lot more moist than the recipe I've used in the past, but my husband really prefers moist ziti so it's perfect for us.  Thnaks for the recipe!

OK...mine wasn't quite ziti since I realized that we were out only after I began the recipe. So I used rotini pasta instead...turned out just fine. I had added extra sauce thinking that it was going to dry out way too much. But I think that after covering it, it stayed moist and so it was a little runny after baking. But made it great to reheat later on. We all really enjoyed it...thanks.

I made this for my husband who really doesnt like the traditional italian sauces. He just loved this, I think the cheeses and sour cream tame down the spaghetti sauce. I also add 2 tbsp.of splenda to take the bite out of the sauce. I love this recipe

My family loved this. I used cooked sausage as well as ground beef. I did not use the provolone, just added more mozzarella. Be warned though, this makes alot! So plan for leftovers or cut the recipe in half.

I love this recipe. The only thing different I did was make without meat because I made it Thursday
night for dinner and knew there would be leftovers and no meat Friday (lent). I kept thinking about the sour
cream and wondering if I should substitute but I did end up putting it in and OMG this was wonderful. 
I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing.

It was good as a recipe but like all recipes you add what you like to make it supurb.  I gave it 5 starts because it fits the bill for taste, practicality, cost, and it's a great base recipe to experiment with.  I layered the noodles, provolone slices (they were cheaper, then used the mozerella and 1/2C sour cream (which I mixed together).  SoI had minimal rotating and it was like well mixed lasagna :0)  And I find it easier than lasagna.  Used ricotta instead of sour cream 2nd time and was still good.

This was so delicious!!! I used morning star protein crumbles because I don't eat meat, and halfed the recipe. It was so good. I will be making this many more times I am sure.

YUMMOOOOOOOOOO!  Loved this recipe...only thing I changed was the layering.  I took another review and put the sauce directly on my ziti.  My 7 year old ate this cold the next day!!!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I gave this 5 stars for how easy and tasty this dish is. My husband and kids loved it. It's a great alternative to spaghetti which we eat almost once a week. Now I can switch it up a little with this and pretty much use the same ingredients. And if you buy the Ragu Chunky Garden Style you'll have chunks of carrots and zucchini in your dish... a nice touch. I'll definitely make this again!

This is a fantastic dish. I have neighbors asking me for this recipe. My daughter asks me to make it all the time. You could tweak it to your liking, but I never have. It's great the way it is! Also I just love the sour cream in this dish it's great! This dish is definitely in my weekly dinner rotation. It also makes a great leftover. Thanks for sharing it!

My sister told me about this recipe and my husband and I love it.  I've made this for friends and they are more than happy to take home leftovers. The only change I make is I use my husband's homemade sauce instead of store bought.  You won't be disappointed!

Thank you sooooo much for this WONDERFUL recipe!  It is absolutly the BEST ziti I have ever had!!!  I did layer as suggested in the other reviews (noodles and sauce first), and used 8oz. of mozzarella cheese (freshly grated), and quite a bit of freshly grated parm. cheese only on the top mixed with the mozzarella.  In addition, I only had penne pasta on hand...and LOVED the results.

We liked this a lot.  It's tasty and easy.  I thought it was just a wee bit bland, or I would have given it 5 stars.  I think the sauce needed some zip-- extra garlic, red pepper flakes, etc.  But it is a homey, filling, comfort food type of dinner.

Very good recipe!  This was a delicious and easy dish.  I did take some others advice and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta cheese. I also used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of ground beef.  We love meat in our lasagna, so I figured more meat would be a plus too.  Turned out perfect and we were happy to have lots of leftovers!  Thanks!

I knew I couldn't fail with this when I saw the myriad 5-star reviews.  I make this once a week now.  My husband loves it, and it's sooo easy!  It's hard to tell that the sauce is from a jar.  Usually, I cook for two.  This is enough for dinner and a few lunches throughout the week.  Great recipe.

You can't go wrong with this one.  It was a great dish for my whole family!  Even my "picky" eater loved it. I added a little garlic, salt, and pepper to my ground beef.  Then, I lowered the spageghtti sauce from 2 jars to 1 and 1/2 jars (Ragu Traditional).  Other than those minor tweeks I followed the recipe and was very satisfied with the product! Yum. Yum.

I was apprehensive about this, but decided to try it because I wanted Baked Ziti but didn't have any ricotta.  It was delicious!  My husband, who is a picky eater said the flavor was excellent.  I added onion and minced garlic to my ground beef for the sauce - personal preference.  It was probably the best I've ever made.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

KNOCKOUT recipe. so delicious. 
im a veg, so i left out meat (and ultimately the onions as well)..  added 3 cloves of garlic to the sauce, as well as fresh basil, and dried oregano for more flavor.  i used barilla canned sauces and they were OUTSTANDING with this dish. i also used a variety of cheeses, including romano. i also made sure to mix in the pasta with the sauce. 
my grandmother, who is the pickiest eater in the world could not stop raving about this recipe.

Very easy and good. I used ground turkey and sweet italian turkey sausage, I also used a box of frozen spinach that I squeezed dry. I am doi ng weight watchers so I was trying to make this figure friendly so I also used the Ronzoni smart taste white pasta that has extra fiber and I used half fat free mozzerella and half part skim mozzerella. I also used light sour cream. Turned out great! Will make again.

I understand why this has been so highly rated.  It is so easy, quick, and tastes like you slaved all day.  So much easier than lasagna!  I used mild italian sausage, roasted garlic pasta sauce, and layered as others did with the sauce on top of the ziti.  I covered with foil but uncovered for the last 5 minutes to let some of the cheese on top brown a little.  I also let it stand for about 5 minutes so it would be less runny.  Excellent!  I plan on making this for a large group (24) because it is so easy.

I have to rate this recipe since two of the four of us decided this was the best ziti we ever had. I was really skepticle about the sour cream, but the combination of it all really teasted great. I will probably cut back a little on the meat next time, since I used sauce with meat in it. I highly recommend this one for families, since both girls loved it (very rare)

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was even good the next day although a little dried out :) I did as other reviewers suggested and switched up the order of ingredients by putting the sauce on top of the noodles instead of the sour cream mixture. Very good recipe if you are in the mood for Italian!

Very good recipe and so easy & fast to make! I halved the recipe and used part ground beef & part sweet sausage per other reviews, and still had a good portion left over. The only thing I would change next time would be the choice of pasta. Ziti just seemed so heavy...maybe rigatoni or a shorter ziti noodle?
All in all, it was totally delicious and my husband asked for it again.

It's not the gourmet version of ziti, but for the taste, quick prep and pricing of ingredients..this is good stuff.

I made this for a tennis match, and everyone on my team (as well as the visiting team) complimented me on this dish. It was delicious. I'll definitely make this again for my husband and I.

Made this exactly as posted.  I was sceptical putting it together-the sour cream/cheese layer looked strange.  When baked it was wonderful.  Will make again, which I rarely ever do!

I can't believe how great, and easy, this dish is!Made it last night, divided into one 8" square dish and three oval ramekins (which I'll give to my son today).
Absolutely delicious!

I've never seen a meal disappear from my table faster than this one!! This was fantastic.  In used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I'm sure it would be great either way.

Very good will definitely make again.  I had to remove quite a  bit of fluid because I covered as rec. by others due to drying out.  I will probably cover half way through cooking next time.

This recipe was really good and easy to make as well. Definitely a great leftover as well. I halfed the recipe and it was more than enough for six people. Did add extra garlic powder just to enhance the flavors but a keeper in our house!!

Awesome recipe. I used whole wheat pasta, ground turkey breast and low fat cheese to make it somewhat healthier and it was still fantastic. My whole family loved it!

Excellent Recipe!!! One of my wife's favorite meals but until now I haven't been able to prepare a good version. I, too, added a couple cloves of garlic and a tsp of Italian seasoning. Even a half recipe will give us two full meals!!
Thank you!!!!

I really like this recipe.  It is nice and simple, and tastes very good.   I've made it twice now and it turned out great both times,  once using a homeade sauce and the other time using a quick sauce I sometimes make using a Lawry's spaghetti packet, just doubled the sauce recipe.  The sauce totally covered the pasta so I had no need to cover the pan,  turned out just fine.

This is definitely a keeper!  The sour cream adds just the right flavor.  Mixing a small amount of sauce with the Ziti before layering works great.  Try it and you won't be disappointed!

Ultimate comfort food!  Very tasty and well received all round.  Only alterations were I added spinach and mushrooms to the spag sauce.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and make my own spag sauce.

This sounds so good, however, what kind of pasta is "ziti?"  My markets don't carry anything by that name,  They have penne pasta and rigatoni pasta.  Can I substitute?

Omitted the onion and still came out delicious!

Also made a veggie version for my roommate with fake sausage instead and it was also amazing. 

Def worth making again.

I absolutely love this ziti recipe!  It has become one of my go-to signature dishes that I make when I need to feed a lot of people (i.e. showers, potlucks, etc.)  I don't take many liberties with the recipe as it's good just as it is though there are times where I will mix bacon into the meat mixture.  

If I could give it six stars, I absolutely would!

This was very good. I did add some minced garlic when I was browning the meat. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise, except for covering dish with foil while cooking. This recipe makes so much and was overflowing from my 9 X 13 dish. Recommend this one!

We love this recipe, have eaten it several times already. I do like it to be a tad more saucy, so I add a bit more. The leftovers are the best part, so double the recipe. Trust me.

I have made this tons of times and it's great... I add Bob Evans sausage and just use a mix of shredded Italian cheeses and it turns out great!  It makes a ton!

I had really great hopes for this and liked how easy it was to make - but I think it lacked a bit in flavor. Next time I will add some fresh basil and maybe use more shredded parmesan on top.

I made this twice in one week because my family loved it so much! I took the advice from others and put the sauce on the noodles.  Great recipe!!

This was fabulous!  I thought the sour cream sounded a little strange with pasta, but it made the cheese very creamy.  It added great flavor.  Everyone in my family loved it. Would definitely make again.

We used ricotta instead of Sour Cream because it is that much better! other than that, Baked Ziti being hard to screw up, is a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly but we just didn't care for it too much.  The sour cream gave it a weird consistency after being cooked.  I won't make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly except like others, I layered the sauce directly on the pasta. Next time I think I'll substitute the sour cream for ricotta. I don't think the sour cream adds much, it looks like ricotta but doesn't have that cheesey texture. I also had to bake mine for 40 minutes and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to make the cheese golden brown. I'll definitely make this again with modifications!

This recipe is very similar to Three Cheese Baked Pasta on this site (seems almost identical except that recipe calls for tomato sauce instead of spaghetti sauce like this one). Both recipes are a huge hit with my family and friends. I do add fresh garlic when sauteing the beef and usually add some basil and oregano to taste. Thank you for the recipe!!

This has become a favorite in my household.  I left out the onion and hamburger.  I almost didn't add the provolone, but did in the end and I'm glad I did.  In my opinion the provolone and sour cream give this recipe it's flavor.

Yum, yum, yum! I loooove this stuff. I first had this when my aunt made it, and then I decided to cook it for my boyfriend (who also loved it!). I leave the onions out because he hates onions, and it's still great. I made it again this Christmas for a family get-together WITH the onions. This stuff rocks, but I would hate to know the calorie count with all that cheese! Anyway, make this recipe. It's amazing. However, it makes a LOT! A 9x13 will be piled high and I think it's a lot more than 8 servings for sure!

This is a great recipe that I will use many times in the future.  I’m a beginner, though, and I even managed to make a mistake with this simple recipe, yet it turned out great.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and replace half the ground beef with hot Italian sausage (it definitely adds some great color to the flavor) and added a couple of cloves of fresh chopped garlic.  Also, I poured the sauce mixture directly on top of the ziti noodles before adding the provolone cheese.  Next time, I’m going to add another ¼ - ½ lb. of meat to this to suit my particular tastes.  My mistake was that when the recipe calls for you to start with half the ziti and half the sauce for the first layer, I just assumed that it only called for half the provolone as well.  Wrong!  I just didn’t read carefully, so the rest of my provolone went on top with the mozzarella and grated Parmesan.  It still turned out great and tasted very good!  (See picture!)

Very good and easy to make! I covered it while baking and it was so creamy after, but I find that it needs more mozzarella cheese, so next time I make it, I will have two layers, one in the middle right after the sour cream, and on top.

My daughter had a bunch of friends over the other nite and I needed to come up with something everyone would like.  Tried this and it was a hit.  Was worried about the sour cream but boy did it add a nice flavor.  My daughter is having the whole girls basketball team over tomorrow nite before the game for the team meal and this is what I'll be serving!!

Really good recipe.  I made some changes.  I used whole wheat pasta. I added mushrooms to the sauce mixture.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta cheese mixed together.  I added orgeano and salt and pepper to  the meat/onion mixture.  It was a great and my boyfriend loved it.  Very easy recipe! Thanks!

This was sooo good!!!  I made a few changes since I am a vegetarian.  I used veggie ground round instead of ground beef.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp crushed red peppers, and 1 tbsp italian spice to the sauce mix.  I didn't have provolone cheese so I just used mozzarella and a little bit of the prepackaged shredded mexican cheese mix.  I wasn't sure how the sour cream was going to taste in this dish but I must say it was absolutely delicious!!!  Definitely will make this again!

This was sooo good!  I will definitely be making it again.  I left out the meat, used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta and it was awesome.  It makes a ton and there are definitely more than 6 servings!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Since my son ate this ziti I have to give it 5 stars!!!!
He even asked for leftovers the next night.
This pasta was great and easy to prepare. 
Everyone should have this recipe in their files.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

Loved this!  As others suggested, I mixed a little of the sauce with the pasta so it did not dry out.  I also covered it while it was baking.  Will definately make again!!

I've used this recipe for a couple years now and don't know why I've never rated it because it's AMAZING!  I love cooking this when I have large groups over for dinner - or mine and my husbands single, hungry military men.  It's a hit every single time!  I will use this recipe forever!

Again, this was a recipe I had never tried before, but my family loves pasta. Instead of layering this like the recipe calls for, I mixed all the ingredients except for the cheese in a bowl then spread one layer topped with cheese and the spread the second. I did this because i wanted the pasta to be coated in the sauce. I also added Italian Seasonsing, Basil, and Oregano to the sauce. I thought it came out pretty good, but I was amazed by my Husband & his brother's reaction....they couldn't stop talking about it and they said it was the best meal I've made so far! I served with classic garlic bread. This recipe makes a ton so if you don't want leftovers cut it in half.

I just fixed this ziti for dinner and everyone absolutely loved it. Great for my husband who hates  ricotta. I did season the meat with the onion, garlic, seasoning salt, pepper, basil and thyme. The fennel in the italian sausage I added gave it some more kick. A definite keeper.

Good God this recipe is great :) I don't like Ricotta but love sour cream so it was right up my alley.  The only change I made was to use half a pound Italian Turkey Sausage to go with the half pound of ground beef I had on hand took the sausage out of the casing mixed with the beef and proceeded as directed the turkey added some fennel to the recipe that only enhanced everything else. Im sure you could make it with all turkey to make it leaner but it is perfect the way it is.Thanks Colleen best Ziti i ever ate or made for that matter.

This recipe is AWESOME.  I made this exactly as it's posted for my son's first birthday party.  I had over 20 people and every single person loved this recipe and wanted a copy! 
The sour cream adds a really nice tart and sweet taste.  It does make an awful lot though, but it's wonderful as leftovers!
Definately make this-you will not be sorry!

This recipe was very good. My son even ate it and he is pretty picky. I think the next time I will use ricotta or cottage cheese in this recipe. It had the look of lasagna and with every bite I kept thinking that it would taste like it to. Overall, it was very good and I froze the extras, and recently thawed and it was delicious still.

I am giving this a 4 because with all of the rave reviews, it was a little disappointing.  It was good, but I think it would have been better if I had made the spaghetti sauce instead of using the canned stuff. I used deer meat instead of beef.

I made this without the meat & onion for the kids at Thanksgiving. Even the adults enjoyed this.I can't wait to try it with the meat, may even add some sausage to the mixture to give it a kick. Thanks for another great recipe.

This was only o.k for my hubby & i-If i make this again i will cut back on the sour cream & add the top layer of cheese the last 20 min. of cooking.It was all a little to much sauce & cheese for us.

I love this recipe!  No need for parmesan if you don't have it.  I also replaced 1/3 of the sour cream with low fat sour cream - couldn't tell the difference.  The top got a little dried out - will probably try covering it next time.

I made this last night for some friends, and it was a big hit!  Fast and easy to make.  I added 1lb of hot Italian sausage and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes since everyone said the sauce wasn't enough.  This dish came out perfect.  I was afraid the hot suasage would be too spicy, but since I mixed it with the sauce and the beef, it added some great flavor.  The sour cream gave it a great, rich taste!  I made it earlier in the day, and just put it in the refrig until time to cook.  I will definately be making this again!

I thought this was great and so did my hubby. We were surprised at how great the sourcream melded w/the other flavors. Tasted even better the next 2 days. Definitely a keeper.

I have an electric oven so I only cooked it for 30mins (afterall, everything was already cooked and its just the cheese that needed melting).  Im not sure if the sour cream element worked for me, but the kids loved it!

Really good!! I modified it for a healthy twist...I used a Fat Free Sour cream and Fat Free Cottage cheese mixture. I also used 2% mozzarella, and whole wheat penne. It turned out wonderful! BEWARE: makes a ton of food...I cut the recipe in half (baked in a 9x9 COVERED)and still came out with 4 generous servings.

I was a little skeptical of the sour cream at first, almost didn't add it.  Glad I did, it melts in to make a wonderful creamy taste.  Fed this to 11 people, all of which thought it was great.

My family loves this, My DH asks for it alot, He however loves it with half ground beef and half italian sausage, I hate sausage so when I do it like that, I am not a fan. I also mix sour cream and ricotta together.

This recipe is above average. My family really liked it. It didn't stand out to me as a "Hall of Famer". I made sure to cover it up and the last 5-10 minutes uncover it.

Fantastic, creamy and delicious! Guests went crazy for it. I'm vegetarian, so I omitted the beef and just mixed the sour cream in with garlic pasta sauce. For those of you that like crispy top layers of cheese, you can broil this dish for a few minutes at the very end of cooking. Yummmmy! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best baked ziti I have ever tasted.  My kids love it.  I always use ground turkey instead of the beef.  I have doubled the recipe a few times and used one pound of ground turkey and one pound of sweet turkey sausage (casings removed) and the result was amazing!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I do make a few changes, but the concept is the same.  I use a mix of ricotta and sour cream and subsitute ground sausage for ground beef.  It is really easy to make and feeds my boyfriend and me for 3 days!

Very tasty although what I did was instead of a total 1 1/2 cup of sour cream I added Ricotta cheese for half the mixture along with the sour cream...Nice and smooth..and also used ground turkey.

We had this last night for dinner.  I actually made a marinara sauce from my Cooking Light Mag - and I mixed in some ricotta with the sour cream.  This was fantastic!  I loved the sour cream flavor and the tartness it added.  All of my kids (4) loved it and we are having it for lunch today!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was amazing!! We don't eat ground beef, so I substituted ground turkey. I also only had one jar of spaghetti sauce, so I added a can of diced tomatoes in lieu of the second can of spaghetti. It was so tasty and flavorful. My husband can't wait to have it again!

LOVED this recipe.  It was a huge hit with my family.  I did make one minor tweak: instead of 1.1/2 cup of sour cream, i mixed 3/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream with 3/4 cup low fat ricotta.  Still came out excellent.  I would definitely make this again.  My sister already asked me when the next time I would make this!  Thanks!!

This is the best and easiest recipe I have ever tried. My entire family loves this ziti, even my 17 month old son. My daughter(11) begs me to make this on a regular. Not complicated at all, and definetlty not too expensive.

Awesome recipe!!!  Made it tonight for my parents, my sister, my aunt, my daughter, and my husband.  Everybody loved it!!!  

I had one green and one red pepper on hand so I chopped that up, sauteed it and added it to the sauce.  Also added extra mozzarella cheese and put some on the top.  

What a great recipe!  Thank you for sharing it.

Absolutely delish! The whole family loved it which is saying alot when you have 3 picky teenagers to feed.  The only change that I made was to substitute ricotta cheese for the sour cream because that was what I had available.  Has definitely made its way to "keep" pile.

We tried this last night and it was FABULOUS!  Used a mixture of 3/4 cup sour cream & 3/4 cup cottage cheese and only had rigatoni (bigger than ziti), but my guys gobbled it up!  Be prepared as it does make a lot, but warms up well for leftovers.  Yummy!

My husband doesn't normally like red sauce pasta dishes but he loved this one.  This is great to fix for company and its also even better for leftovers the next day!!  I did like others suggested and mixed the sauce w/ the pasta so it wouldn't dry out.  Can't wait to make this again!!!

Delicious!  My husband is Italian and hates baked pasta dishes, but asks me to make this all the time!  We freeze single portions of it and he takes it to work for lunch.

great dish, but if you want to add some flavor, add two hot italian sausages ( chopped) in with meat sauce.

Very good, used random cheese I had in the fridge. My fiance liked it and I made some baked garlic chicken tenders to go with it. Highly recommend!

Very Good! My son thinks it's lasagna...whatever makes him eat! Thanks for the recipe. ***UPDATE*** I made this for a luncheon at work and put it in the crock pot. I cooked everything the night before but didn't mix the noodles with the sauce and cheese. I layered it in the crock pot in the morning, turned it on high for the first hour and then down to low and by lunchtime...it was gone! There are never any leftovers!

This was just okay for me. I thought it would taste a lot cheesier, but it really just tasted like spaghetti. I probably won't make this exact recipe again, but it was pretty good.

This was so good and a nice change from spaghetti or lasagne. It's easy to make and it makes a ton. I make it in two 9" square pans if it's just the two of us and that way I have one for the freezer when I really don't feel like cooking. I just pop it in the oven while I make a salad and garlic bread. Thank you so much!

This was awesome! Fed 4 adults, 2 kids and had leftovers for the next day. Moist and good for a few days after. I also mixed the sauce with the pasta and then layered, that's what kept it moist!

Great recipe! I prepared this dish for a get together with friends and not one of them disliked it! I spiced up the beef with garlic salt, black pepper, and a little parsley. Also I covered it when baking and after it finished I continued to warm it in the oven till ready to serve. This goes well with toasted French bread and greens.

I would give this six stars if I could! My hubby loves Italian food, and I usually hate to cook it. This is so easy, nothing to have to stuff to get a great cheesy outcome (like shells, etc). Sooooo much better than lasagna! I did pre-coat my ziti with sauce like other reviewers suggested, and this was fantastic heated over! I used sauce in a jar & substituted Italian sausage for ground beef.Yummy! Thanks!!!

Excellent and so easy!!!  The pasta really soaks up all of the liquid.  I may try to come up with something next time to make it a little more moist.  You better be hungry.  The recipe makes a huge amount!

This was easy to make and absolutely delicious!  My family absolutely enjoyed it, and keeps begging me to make it again! My family doesn't eat beef, so I used 1 lb of ground turkey instead of beef, and added Turkey Italian sausages to the recipe.  I also, substituted half of the sour cream with ricotta cheese!  It was very tasty!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely fantastic.  I served to 4 adults and 5 small children, but still had plenty of leftovers.  My husband and I fought over who could eat the leftover ziti!  I cut down on the onion and added some minced garlic with the beef, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Loved it!  Although it was a bit too thick to fit in my pan.  Ended up skipping the last noodle layer, but still great!  Better than any lasagna that I've made and so much easier!  Very cheesy!

This is the only recipe I have used to make baked ziti, and I will never use another.  Sometimes I substitute the ground beef with italian sausage for more of a kick, but overall this recipe needs no modifications.  It is delicious!  I share the recipe with everyone and they always thank me!

Overall a very good recipe. I think I would like a little more sauce, but the sour cream does an excellent job at keeping the ziti from drying out. Will ?definitely make again!

I just made this for a party last night for the first time and it was a big hit! I didn't think the sour cream would be good, but I really liked it in this dish!  I will definitely make it again.  I like others added lots of garlic to  my sauce and that made it very tasty.

I love this recipe!! I made two for a potluck, one meatless & one Italian Sausage and EVERYONE loved it. The sour cream actually goes well with it, I wouldn't skip it -- but I did substitute 1/2 of the sour cream with ricotta cheese. I also added fresh garlic to the mix. It all turned out so delish! Some people reviewed this recipe and said it was bland. I think if you use a plain spaghetti sauce, it will be bland with no added seasonings. I used Garlic & Herb flavored sauce for my vegetarian one, and used Italian Sausage & Garlic flavored sauce for the other. 5 stars!!

This was an amazing dish!!!  I made it for a friend to take to a potluck at his work and months later they were still asking him if i would make more.

I don't really have much to add to the recommendations already made except that I use extra provolone and extra mozzarella.  I also add chopped garlic to my sauce and eliminate the onion.

I've made this a couple times now, it would be pretty bland without the addition of italian sausage. The meal is perfectly complimented by a garden salad and warm bread. Quick and easy! Enjoy!

This just could not be simpler!!  I thought the sour cream was a little odd but went with it, and it creates a light, creamy texture to the pasta.  I loaded up on cheese baked on top of the dish and froze the leftovers.  Wonderful recipe - even with turkey sausage ...

I am giving this a 3 because my boyfriend liked it, I did not. I missed the ricotta cheese. It was also a little dry when it came to leftovers. There are alot of ziti recipes, will not make this one again.

I had a fundraiser lunch today and i used this recipe.  It came out wonderful.. It stayed really moist through the serving process.  One thing though i asked someone to get me some sour cream and they bought me cottage cheese, so i had no choice but to use them at 5am in the morning.  Still turned out great!  Highly recommended!

I halved the recipe and used swiss cheese instead of provolone.  Other than that I cooked it accordingly.  And I covered it of course!  This dish good for you by any means and that is why it is so darn good!!  THANK YOU for the recipe!

This was really great.  I followed directions except I put the sauce before the provolone cheese.  I also doctored the jar of sauce, but I always do that to the sauce.  My husband said that it was a solid 4 star.  I served it with garlic and cheese flaky biscuits.  I will make this again.

Really good and not too time consuming.  I added some italian sausage to the ground beef, otherwise made as directed.  I had never heard of putting sour cream an Italian dish and it curdled a little so it looked like cottage cheese, but the flavor was pleasing.  Big hit at our house!

This recipe is just fantastic. It is a little messy but tastes great -- very flavorful. It also reheats without becoming dry, like most pasta dishes.

This recipe is awesome! I have made it twice already using some of the suggestions that others have made. I also added shredded sharp cheese along with the mozzarella cheese and it gave it some extra flavor. This recipe is definately a keeper!

I finally got around to making this dish for a pot luck.  I did add seasoning to the sauce because If I use sauce from a jar I always do.  It turned out great!  Easy too.

This ziti is FANTASTIC! It's the best we have ever had, even better than at any italian restaurant!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I changed the servings to 4 instead of 8.

This is a great base recipe. I usually half it otherwise you end up with enough to feed an army. I also mix up all the sauce with the pasta then top with the cheese. So good!

I liked that this dish was easy to prepare, and the ingredients weren't terribly expensive. I substituted ground beef with Boca crumbles because I don't eat red meat. I also sauteed 4 cloves of minced garlic with the onion. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I added other spices to the sauce. I chose onion powder, black pepper, basil, and oregano. By mistake, I only used one of the jars of sauce, but it still turned out good. I served this with a garlic bread recipe found on allrecipes. My husband said that I outdid myself this time. Thanks for a good recipe!

Outstanding recipe.  One thing that I do different is, I add a 16oz container or Ricotta to the sauce mix.  This makes it extra cheesy.  The best ziti recipe that I have found.

Excellent!  We served it to a group of young adults at church and they kept going back for seconds.  Made one with meat and one without for the vegans. I will definitely make this one again for company.  I agree that the sauce needs to be added to the ziti to keep it from drying out.  We all loved it.

I had been looking for a good recipe for baked ziti. This is the recipe I was looking for. Don't leave out the sour cream, it really adds to the flavor, and be sure to use the provolone too. I've made this many times and when I left these ingredients out because I didn't have them on hand, it just wasn't as good.

This came out very nice; my kids liked it, altho not next day. I don't normally like/eat sour cream, but thought I should try something different, and I am glad I did. I couldn't find ziti pasta, so I used penne pasta instead, but it worked fine. Hubby liked too, so I will def make again. Thanks!

OMG! My family LOVED this!! The entire pan was gone!  My DH had at least 3 plates full!  I was sad that there wasn't any left overs!  I will for sure make this again!! 

I did add garlic, salt and pepper to the meat mixture. Once the sauce was added I did add extra oregano to the sauce!

THis was ok, but i the fact that it was only ok was my fault.  I didn't have provolone and couldn't get it at my local small town grocery store.  I used half my mozzarella in the middle and half on top, so it simply was not as cheesy as i had hoped.  I will make it at least one more time (correctly).  my husband is unfortunately not a fan of pasta, but said he would give this another try, so i'm betting that it will be a winner.

I am giving this 4 stars, because my husband and children really liked it, but I thought it had a really odd taste from the sour cream.  I guess you either really like it, or you really don't.

Excellent. I made tonight for dinner. Actually I doubled it and put in my huge roasting pan, so we would have lots of leftovers, and I could freeze some too. Too save time, I didn't layer it, I simply mixed everything together. I also used 1 lb. ground turkey and 1 lb. sweet ground italian sausage instead of ground beef. Sargento has a mozzarella/provolone shredded mix so I just used that. I stirred in 3  (26. oz each) cans of spaghetti sauce, and also stirred in some italian seasoning and fresh garlic. On top of everything, I poured a 4th final can over and then sprinkled on a little extra cheese. Put foil on top and baked 40 minutes. Will make again.

This is a regular favorite at my house. I've mixed it up a little and used cottage cheese instead of sour cream and mild sausage instead of ground beef.

This was really good!  I did a couple of changes as suggested:  I added the  cooked noodles to the sauce the last 5 minutes of simmering and I also used a 15 oz container of Riccota.  I also added about 3 cups of Mozzarella  on top.  I had a small amount left that I cooked up and will freeze for future use.

Great for a quick and easy dish.  I made the meatless variety adding spinach and substituting elbows for penne.

Really good! I added italian seasoning and a teaspoon of sugar to the spaghetti sauce to try to cut down on the premade sauce flavor. This recipe made plenty of sauce which was nice! Really good the next day too!

Thia is wonderful. I had to make it 2 days in a row for my husband. I only changed a few things. I used ricotta instead and added italian tomatoes along with italian seasoning and garlic. Its easy and it tastes like it took forever to make, its easy to tweak the recipe and make it your own, wonderful!!

I used rigatoni instead of ziti, 1 pound of mozzarella instead of provolone and parmesan.  It was delicious! My roommates all loved it.

I made this last night, and it was great!  My picky husband ate 2 big servings.  I made a couple of modifications, though.  I used only 1 jar of spaghetti sauce to the pound of ground beef. The sauce I used was a spinach and cheese tomato sauce.  It was wonderful to sneak in some green stuff!  I added just a little extra tomato sauce from a can to make sure the recipe was saucy enough. (2 jars would be way too much here!)  Also, I skipped the provolone entirely and used shredded Italian 4 cheese blend throughout with a little shredded sharp cheddar thrown in for contrast.  The sour cream is the key here--so do not skimp on it!

Really fabulous . . . I make this for parties where we have lots of guests and they all love it.  I add a bunch of minced garlic and a bit of Italian seasoning to the sauce, I more than double the meat, and I use a large foil roasting pan to layer everything.  It goes a LONG way.  Delish!

I made this last night and it was the best baked ziti I've ever had.  My experience has always been that baked pasta dishes tend to be on the dry side, but not so with this one.  I'm assuming this was due to the sour cream, of which I was a little leary, but it really was a nice change from ricotta.  This recipe made a lot, but that wasn't a problem, because everyone had seconds and killed the leftovers today.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Just made this last night and it was excellent!!  Bringing it to a house full of boys tonight, Im sure it wont last long!!  I doubled the recipe and still had some left over.  To the recipe I added tons of fresh garlic and used three jars of tomato basil pasta sauce in with the beef.  Then I layered it starting with a mixture of one jar marinara with 1/2 the ziti, put a layer of canned diced tomatoes, then 1/2 the beef sauce mixture, the provolone and sour cream, then the rest of the ziti, mozarella, beef sauce, and parmesan!  Cover definitely!!

My husband, sister, and brother-in-law loved this recipe, however I was not as crazy about it as they were. I personally would recommend adding more of each cheese and some spices for added flavor, as I thought it was a bit bland. Overall though it was pretty good and I will make it again and add more cheese and spices.

Wonderful recipe.  Some possible changes - add a layer of pepperoni on top before sprinkling with parmesan cheese; use whole wheat noodles and reduced fat cheese.

Delicious! I didn't have provolone so I added some extra mozzarella cheese to the mix. My husband loved it. I did cook the sauce with the (cooked) beef in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on low so it was able to mix the flavors.

Wow. Thanks for this recipe.  I did this today for an informal lunch with friends and it was a great hit.  Just used ricotta cheese instead of the sour cream as it is not available in Malta.  Will do it again very soon

This was a definite hit! For just three of us I cut the recipe in half (except for the cheeses) and there was still enough for all of us to have seconds. I try to cut back on fat whenever I can so I used light sour cream, and it was still great.  If you're lucky enough to have leftovers, it's great the next day and even the day after.  I will make this one again and again!

I changed this recipe just a little bit. I omitted the sour cream and used ricotta instead. I added black olives in the sauce and used italian sausage. My fiance is a big fan of Italian food and he LOVED it!The part I like the best was it was SO cheesy!Great recipe!

I make this about once a month.  My husband absolutley loves it.  It's so much easier to make than other great pasta recipes, like Lasagna.  Makes a great covered dish to bring and it also freezes very nicely for back up meals that you can microwave while still frozen in just a few minutes!  Thanks!!

Very very good recipe.  I selected a really good spaghetti sauce for the ground beef mixture.  That made a world of difference.  Also, I added a little more sour cream than the recipe called for.  Very good recipe.  Thanks

Very simple, basic dish. It was good and slightly creamy, but tasted almost the same as regular old spaghetti with meat sauce which takes half the time. While this is good, I think I want something with a bigger "wow" factor.

I omitted the provolone and added extra mozarella. Also, I put it into two smaller casserole dishes and froze one of them. Just make sure to thaw before baking. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic. Not only was it easy, it was delicious. I did make a few minor changes, I used 1 and a half lb of pasta (couldn't find Ziti!!) but used a similar tubular pasta. Used 3 bottles of sauce, added some cottage cheese with the sour cream, and added some chopped mushrooms and garlic. This fed a group of six people with big appetites...with about 4 servings left over. This was my first time making this dish, and it was a big hit with everyone. I also served the "Pepperoni bread" (also found at All Recipes) and Caesar salad. Yum

This was awesome.This was really, really good with a few changes I made. Just as good as the lasagna that I make but without all the work. I was not sure about the sour cream but used it anyways, I added a little extra mozzerela cheese because we like cheese, and I used Prego's saugage and garlic sauce. It turned out so great. The sour cream in it turned out really good. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will deffiently be making this again. Awesome!

Everyone loves this recipe.  Taste like lasagna, but I think is easier to make.  I use recipe as is.  For the spaghetti sauce, I use a three cheese and a garden vegetable sauce.  Adds more cheese flavor and gets the veggies in also.  Makes a very full 9x13 dish.

Delicious and easy to make. Recipe makes WAY more than 8 servings in my opinion. I didn't have a large casserole dish on hand and ended up using 3 medium sized ones - there are 2 in the freezer, and half of one for leftovers tomorrow! My husband loved it and usually doesn't like anything with onions! Will definatly make again!

I mixed the noodles and sauce (i used homemade and I used a lot more than the recipe called for) together.  I added half of the noodle mixture to the 
9 x 13 pan.  Then added 8 oz of shredded mozarella and provolone cheese.  I added the sour cream, then topped with the remaining noodles.  I topped the whole thing with 8 oz of the cheese mixture and baked.  It was super easy and the leftovers were great!

I make this recipe A LOT, and everyone always loves it. I don't use the onion, and I only use about 1 and 1/2 jars of sauce. I also use Penne noodles...I like the texture and density better with this recipe. Always a crowd pleaser.

I made this to take to my husband and a few of his coworkers who were working an overnight shift at the hospital. I substituted ground Italian sausage for the ground beef and halved the recipe to avoid having leftovers...it was SO good! It traveled well, fed 5 hungry doctors, and my husband and his coworkers loved it! I will definitely make this again soon.

My family loved this baked ziti. I also added a package of pepperoni cut up and covered the dish with foil during most of the cooking time. Texture was perfect. Will next time try with ricotta cheese, but this was just great according to my two sons! Thank you for this recipe!

This is one of the best recipes I have found off of allrecipes.  Simple, easy and ohhhhh so good!!!  You can pretty much make variations to this with good results too.  I like to use spicy ground Italian sausage for the meat, mix 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of ricotta to the noodles once they are cooked and instead of jarred sauce, use Best Marinara Sauce Yet and you will have a winner on your hands.  Thanks for this one - I can't get enough of it!

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did different was to substitute a 15 oz can of Sloppy Joe for that portion of spaghetti sauce.  It gives my sauce a tiny bit of a tang that I like.

very good, the sour cream was great, my husband HATES ricotta in anything   and I don't like cottage cheese so   this was perfect, he ate it all up.. I do however think the provolone really didn't make much of a difference, if I don't already have it on hand I will leave it out.

SO GOOD!  I used ground turkey (cut the fat in half), way less sour cream (it's rich enough with just a few tablespoons), and only about half an onion (but that's just my taste),  Beware the pan will be VERY full and almost overflowing...I have left-overs for days.  You really cannot mess this recipe up, so don't be affraid to try/adjust.

My family loved it!  I added a pound of Italian sausage to the ground beef and used a shredded package of provolone and mozzarella cheese.  I was unsure aboue the sour cream, I considered substituting ricotta cheese.  I'm glad I didn't, the sour cream was a welcome change of pace.  The recipe served more than 8, and we had left overs.  Definately will be making this again.

What a surprise the sour cream makes!  This was really really good!  It makes a very large casserole though.  Might want to cut the recipe in half or be prepared to freeze.

Totally awesome, what can I say!  All ages loved it. It was not dry, and dished out like a hotdish, but who cares! With any recipe a good cook always tweaks it a bit, my tweaking was extra cheese, I used 16 OUNCES!!!!  yum.  ALOT easier than lasagne, and everyone thought these noodles were a unique change of pace. I used chip dip (had a container to get rid of)...and those who say the sour cream doesn't fit, have certainly different tastes... I thought it was perfect! And if you thought it was bland...its JAR sauce-there are many different flavors to try, maybe you should try another. Going in our favorites. thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!

This was a good basic recipe but nothing special. I used swiss cheese instead of provolone since that was all I had and added mushrooms and garlic to the sauce - I'm glad I did. I agree with some of the other reviews that this recipe is reminiscent of lasagne but with ziti. I might make this again.

I am giving this dish four stars because my family really liked this ziti, but I personally thought it tasted way too smoky (probably due to the provolone cheese). I thought that the sour cream was an interesting addition...and maybe I'll make this recipe again substituting cheddar for the provolone.

Very Very Good! Whole family absolutely loved it. For my sauce I used two jars of Francisco Rinaldi meat sauce. I put a little extra provolone cheese in. Had my doubts on the sourcream but it made this dish so creamy and tasty, glad I followed directions. Heated up some reduced fat garlic bread with it. We had enough leftovers for the next day. Thanks for this great recipe Colleen!!

Delicious! Easy and quick to make and it is a nice change from lasagna.  I used a combination of cheddar and jack cheeses because that is what I had on hand.  I put the cheese on top as the last layer because I like a crispy cheese topping.  I would make this often.

Although, this is delicious: the concensus was: when we want Lasagna : "make Lasagna w/ the creaminess of the ricotta", and when we want Baked Mostoccelli,(sp?) "DON'T add sour cream" AND "leave the mozzarella on TOP" (instead of the sauce & the parmesean, (as this recipe states to do). Delicious, yes, but probably won't make again,this way.

YUM! Very tasty. This is an easy and hearty recipe, great comfort food. I didn't have Ziti so I used another pasta similar in shape and size and it worked well (I think it was Rigatoni). Also, added some fresh garlic to the onion and meat mixture, about 2-3 cloves. Family loved it as well as the neighbors! Thanks Colleen for sharing!

This recipe was and continues to be absolutely delicious.  My 4-year old daughter and I made it together last night.  It was fun to make and we have lots of leftovers for the week.  I would not change a thing.  This will be a staple in my house!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I will be making this for the third time tonight. After the first time we used our own spaghetti sauce. My husband is Italian so we don't eat the jar sauce! Although I did try the exact recipe the first time and it was good. It was excellent with my husband's sauce! I have left over sauce from last night's spaghetti so we will have baked ziti again tonight.

I'm drooling just thinking about it.  Don't change a thing - this recipe's perfect!  UPDATE:  this is the dish I always make to give away.  this time I used 2 sweet Italian sausage links with 1.5 pounds ground beef (we like meat).  That was a fantastic flavor addition!  This is my absolute favorite go-to recipe.

this recipe is so good!  everyone loves it and most people dont even realize its not ricotta cheese in there.  its very creamy and delicious.  always bring this for potlucks and it goes quicky.  i have to admit sometime i just use my own meat sauce when i have some extra.  but definately try this one!!

Great recipe.. Whole family enjoyed it. Added 3 cloves fresh garlic to onion and ground meat.  Only used 1 cup sour cream.  Very creamy and delicious!

I thought this was really good.  The provolone and sour cream add a great creamy texture to this dish.  I only had one jar of pasta sauce so I substituted a can of tomato sauce for the 2nd jar and it was just perfect.  I am almost thinking 2 jars would have been too much.  Family loved it and ate all the leftovers as well.

I've made this dish several times and it's always really good!  It makes enough to feed a small army, but it does reheat really well in the microwave.  I find that I don't even need all of the meat sauce mixture, especially b/c it almost overflows a 9x13 pan!  Highly recommend for big dinners or potlucks, etc.

I also used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I also used some bread crumbs when I added the parmesan cheese to the top.  It was excellent and a big hit!  Sour cream in the recipe really adds something different.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  We had tons of leftovers for my family of three (froze some of it) and my picky 16 month old daughter LOVED it!  Followed the recipe with no changes and it was delicious.

Amazing!  It was a pleaser for my family, and we'll get 3-4 meals out of it, easily.  We used a vidalia onion, which added a sweet flavor to the dish that was great.

This recipe was great.  I made it, froze it and then cooked it later in the week.  It tasted fresh (no signs of being frozen).  I did have to cook it for about 1 hour because it was still partially frozen (even though I put it in the refrigerator for the entire day).  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for 4 adults.  Next time I will make an entire recipe and make two casseroles to freeze!

This was great. I made it without meat, and just one type of cheese, but it was still a hit. The sour cream is the secret.

Everyone really liked this recipe.  I am more a vegetable person, so I actually used less spaghetti sauce and added zucchini, mushrooms, and bell pepper.  Turned out very nicely!

Giving this recipe a 5 star....tasted good....the only thing I would change for next time would be don't use the second jar of sauce ,,,alittle to much for my taste and did what the other reviewers said used more cheese...but other than that it was good liked the taste the sour cream add to the taste...

This is a wonderful quick, easy and inexpensive dish.  I add pepperoni to mine.  My fiance eats almost the whole thing in one night.

This has everything I ask for from a recipe...it's easy, doesn't have any complicated ingredients, and everyone who eats it loves it. It's my standard recipe now for any family who has a new baby, last time I made it the new dad said "I was full and knew I shouldn't eat more of it but I just couldn't help it, it was so good!" My kids love it too.

I thought this was just good not fantastic.  I wondered if I missed something when I made it but it didn't stand out to me. For sure, it wasn't bad. I guess I expected more from it.

Definitely a keeper. The only changes I made were to add some garlic, basil, and cayenne pepper to the spag. sauce while it was simmering. There were way too many leftovers so next time I'll probably half the recipe and cook it in a 9x9 pan.

This is sooo simple and it rocks!  I add some Italian seasoning because I use store bought sauce and I add more Mozz. cheese on top because you can't have enough cheese.  

It makes a ton of food and it freezes well.

This was not a big hit with my family. It reminded me of lasagna, which I'm not a fan of. But my husband loves lasagna and he still didn't like this one very much. Not sure if I'll be making this one again.

Really good! I just made my usual speghetti sauce (Sun Dried tomatoe sauce, a little hot sauce, a bunch of garlic, red onion, a little black bean with ginger and garlic sauce, ect ect...) I also added a little cream cheese to the sour cream mixture. Very tasty! Loved it :)

This is the perfect casserole!  1 # meat - any combination & and any sauce (really!) even store bought and even if you never buy it.  It is a foolproof recipe -- and it makes a lot more than you'd think.

I prefer my dishes with a little more "zip."  I will likely try again with hot sausage instead of some of the meat in the sauce (I would use my own instead of jarred) and would try ricotta instead of sour cream.  My Italian husband was horrified.  Beware - this makes enough to feed an army.

This dish is really wonderful. I used grd turkey and a little kosher salt to balance the flavor. I also used a cheese blend of fontina, parm, and mozzarella.  It was really good the next day.

This was good and easy to make. Definately a kid-pleaser.  I used bulk italian sausage instead of ground beef, freshly shredded parmesan cheese, and roasted red pepper spaghetti sauce.  It wasn't bland or dry and made plenty for a family of six with leftovers.  Use a larger dish...it wouldn't fit in a 9x13.

I have made this recipe, exactly as written, several times now, and have also passed it on to my mother-in-law.  It is so flavorful and good!  One of our family's favorites, and one of the few things that everyone will eat!  It does make a lot...our family of 6 hardly puts a dent in it.  It is quite rich.  It heats up well the next day and makes for great leftovers.  YUM!!!

With vegetarian dinner guests to feed, I made this without the meat, and served Italian sausage on the side for those who wanted it. I also used a combination of mozzarella & cheddar since I didn't have provolone. My husband can't stop raving about how good it was. Thanks!!

This was really good and easy.  Although I love sour cream, I didn't think it fit this dish.  I will definitely make this again and omit the sour cream, maybe add some spinach.

I've made this several times and it has been very consistently good and very easy to make.  I eliminate the meat, however, and use a little extra sauce.  Highly recommend this one.

This was good the first time i made it.  I made it a 2nd time today with ground turkey instead of beef and i did not enjoy it as much. i wouldn't recommend ground turkey (its too dry). Also, I put sauce on after the first layer of penne, then i put the other half of the sauce on after the sour cream instead of towards the top layer, that way the top gets more crispy and its much tastier.

This was really delicious! I used 1 lb 4 oz of ground turkey because that was how much was in the package. Everything barely fit into a 9x13 pan - it was pretty much over the top, so I probably won't be adding much more to the mixture the next time I make this (I wanted to put in some spinach as one reviewer suggested). I could only find smoked provolone, and my family noticed the smokiness. Perhaps next time I will used all mozzarella. But everyone enjoyed it and had seconds - I highly recommend this one!

Very filling and rich. I used penne because I couldn't find ziti. Also I messed up the layering order. But it still came out fine.

Sorry guys, but this dish did not do it for me. My boyfriend thought it was great, but I did not like the provolone cheese in the ziti.  For me, it ruined the dish entirely.  The sour cream was good and did make the dish creamy, but all in all the dish was very average.

We loved this!  My fiance went on and on about how good it was.  For the spagetti sauce I used Classico's Sun Dried Tomato and Garlic flavor.  It was to die for.  Added a little more garlic than suggested (we love it).  The only thing I found as a problem was I had to take out some of the ziti because my 9 x 13 was overflowing!!!!  This goes in the rotation.

We're big eaters of Italian food and figured how could you go wrong with pasta, sauce and cheese with a little sour cream?  Well, this just didn't work for us.  The sauce didn't cling well to the pasta and sour cream is no substitute for ricotta!

Really really good. My husband loved it! I agree with the others... the sour cream makes an excellent substitute for ricotta. I also added a tsp of minced garlic to my ground meat. Thanks for the recipe.

Super good!  Instead of ground beef, I used Italian sausage, and instead of using prepared spaghetti sauce, I made my own.  In the end, I thought it was a tad too much cheese, but I'll make this again for sure.

This is a regular, once a month, especially if there will be teenage boys visiting that need to be fed!  It is filling and tastes great but is also fairly easy to make with ingredients that are super easy to find.

This was easy and makes a lot of leftovers.  We like our's a little saucier, so I would add more tomato sauce next time.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I will caution on choosing a good quality spaghetti sauce.  The one I selected was a bit thin, and didn't cook off as much as I would have liked.  But the flavor was great.  The only change I made was adding a chopped bell pepper to the ground beef and onions during cooking.  Thanks for a great new family staple!

This is a family favorite!  It is super easy to make and really good.  To lower the fat I use low fat sour cream and low fat cheeses.  Fabulous!!!

I didn't like the flavor of this at all. The sour cream taste didn't blend well with the spices. My son, who loves Italian food, wouldn't touch it.

This one has become a staple in our house.  We make it vegetarian and use low-fat cheeses and low-fat sour cream (tastes exactly the same as full-fat to me), plus use yellow onion and add lots of garlic to the sauce, regardless of how much is already in it.  Even the pickiest eaters tend to love this recipe.

This came out beautifully, and it was SO easy.  I used low fat ground turkey because we don't eat red meat, and the substitution worked just fine.  But be advised:  this makes a HUGE amount of food!!  We had to freeze over half of it.  This would be a great, easy dish to make for lots of company.

This dish was excellent!  My husband loves baked ziti and said that this is the best one he's EVER had.  I can't say enough about how well this dish came out.  My two children, despite being in the "Picky Eater" stage actually liked this as well!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious, easy to make, freezes great! Sour cream eliminates the cost of ricotta. I'm making this again for our RV trip. Make ahead, freeze, thaw and microwave! My italian husband inhaled it!

Me and my fiancee thought it could use a little more cheese; otherwise it was very good.  Make sure the baking pan is fairly deep.

Sorry, I just wasn't that impressed with this recipe. I found the sour cream unnecessary and the baking just added extra time and another dirty dish. Save yourself some time and just serve the sauce over the pasta and top with the cheese.

Yum! I halved the recipe and served with cheesy garlic bread. I used meat flavored pasta sauce, will try a different sauce next time and maybe a little bit more provolone. Excellent!!

I love this recipe!  It is very easy to make and delicious.  I cut the recipe in half, and it was enough for two people with plenty of left-overs.

The baked ziti turned out so creamy, delicious and super cheesy! It was a little time-consuming with simmering of the sauces and boiling of the pasta, but it was totally worth it! Just remember to cover all the pasta with some sauce, otherwise it will dry out.

I made this for a football party yesteday and it got rave reviews from everyone!  Instead of using ground meat and onion, to save time, I bought sauce with mini-meatballs in it. Turned out great!  Will definitely make this again!

Everyone loved it. If any of you are familiar with the Presidents Choice line of products, tastes very close to the Baked Penne but without the work. Next time will add more cheese.

Great recipe!!  Some changes I made were:  I substituted a half pound of Jimmy Dean's hot sausage for half the hamburger. I used a pre-grated mix of mozzarella and provolone cheeses and I added about 3 cloves of garlic to the onion-meat mixture as I was browning it.  Be sure to cover the dish in foil or it dries out.  It makes a lot, but I was able to fit it all into a rectangle cake pan.  With bread and a salad, this would feed 8-10 people.  I will definitly make this again and again.

This was absolutely delish!  Very easy to make & alot less time consuming than lasagna.  Like other reviewers I made a few adjustments....used turkey sausage, added some herbs & spices, mushrooms, a bit more cheese, a bit more sour cream & it was a hit.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic.    I made this for the first time to serve in our Christmas dinner buffet.   It received rave reviews from my guests.    The only thing I changed from the original recipe was omitting the meat and onion.   I used a high end jarred sauce and had no problems with a bland taste.       Don't worry about it overflowing the pan, it settles down nicely while cooking.    YUM!

Wow - this is awesome.  I didn't change anything and the whole family loved it.    I don't make lasagna because it's too time consuming and I can buy a decent one for cheaper.  This recipe tastes like lasagna, but is much cheaper and easier.

I got this recipe from here over two years ago and it is a mainstay in my recipe box.  I pretty much make the recipe exactly as is.  I am trying to eat healthier so I use ground turkey instead of beef and use whole wheat pasta.  Be careful when cooking, it makes a lot of food and it is almost always near overflowing out of the pan.

My husband said 4.7 stars.  This was very good, and very easy.  I'll be making this again and adding it to my personal recipe collection.  Since a few other reviewers said this was a little bland I seasoned the meat with spaghetti sauce seasoning, and I also added an extra Tbs spaghetti sauce seasoning to the sauce.

Very good recipe! This recipe reminded me of a lasagna type dish, only better and much faster to make! I reduce the recipe by 50%, which was plenty for my family of 3.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I made it several days ago and my husband is still talking about how good it is.  As advised by other reviewers I added a little Italian seasoning, mushrooms, & garlic.  I used Provolone rather than Parmesan on top, and Morningstar veggie crumbles instead of ground beef.

Very good. Easy to make. I'll probably make it again. I did have one son that didn't like it at all and hes a big Italian cuisine fan.  I'll also use more mozzarella next time.

This made a HUGE amount of Ziti.  But it was DELICIOUS.  My whole family just loved it.  I had it for lunch several days and didn't even get sick of it!

OMG Delicious! I made this for a dinner party yesterday and it was a huge hit! I made 2 batches. One with ground turkey and one w/ just mushrooms. On both batches I used Barillo Spag sauce and sauteed an onion and garlic and added some pepper flakes and other spices and simmered for 15 minutes. I think the key is to use the extra spices and good pasta sauce. Make sure the pasta is al dente. I also used extra cheese. I'll be making this for xmas! thanks!

What a wonderful recipe. I added some various spices, a little garlic & salt & pepper to jazz it up a little. I will certainly make this again. It was so moist.

I made this last night and my boyfriend loved it so much he says he likes it better than lasagna and spaghetti!  I made my own sauce and put mozzerella and parmesean and fresh chopped basil on the top.

This has become one of the regular dishes in my household. It's really tasty and easy to make and it leaves a ton of leftovers for the week, and it tastes better each day. I also sub fat free sour cream and ground turkey which works great. I also add turkey sausage sometimes for a kick.

This was delicious.  I used a large deep pottery dish.  I also used about 3/4 pound of sliced provolone and an 8 ounce package of shredded mozzarella.  I used almost a pint of sour cream also.  It was very creamy.  Will make again soon.

Delicious! I always look for recipes on this Web site that have the highest ratings, and this was true to form. I made it for my boyfriend and my roommate for dinner. We all stuffed ourselves, and there were still enough leftovers for three days!

Good! I added fresh mushrooms and garlic and used spicy-hot sausage instead of ground beef. Also made just half the recipe (for 2 people) and it filled my 9x13 pan.

This was so good!!  My husband is very picky, but he really likes this.  I tried the ricotta cheese, but you just cant beat the taste of sour cream!!  Some times I do 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 ricotta.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was easy to make.  I substituted cottage cheese for the sour cream and added 1/2 lb ground sausage to the meat sauce.  Sorta like lasagna only ten time easier!

I cut everything in half, left out the meat, and used Veggie Shreds rather than real mozzarella cheese.  Even though this is one of the highest-rated recipes on this site, I was not prepared for how incredible this dish would be.  Unbelievable.

Made a lot. I was only feeding three adults, so it made enough for two meals. It was really good! I left out the onions because 2/3 of us didn't like onions.

Outstanding!!! We ate until we were so stuffed that we all but rolled to the couch for a light nap! lol I followed the recipe almost exactly - I used a whole bag of mozzarella cheese rather than just 6 oz. (my preference) oh I also added fresh mushrooms and sliced black olives to half of the dish (bf doesn't like that 'yucky stuff' - but I do!). Perfect for busy weeknights - I made this on a Monday evening, after working all day, going to the gym, and grocery shopping. Quick, easy and delicious - This is definitely going into my dinner rotation!

This is fabulous!!  I scaled the recipe in half and also cut down on the cheese and sour cream because too much fat does not agree with my system.  I made my own sauce by sauteeing minced onion and garlic in olive oil, then adding a can of crushed tomatoes, basil, salt and pepper.  I prefer this simple sauce to store bought, most of which I find overpowering with spices.  For the meat, I crushed some home made seasoned meatballs into the sauce.  Assembly: I mixed the pasta, sauce, sour cream and half the mozzarella together.  Provolone in the middle and mozzarella & shredded parmesan on top.  I baked the dish covered for half the time.  YUM!  Next time I'll sneak some spinach into the concoction.

Good, but believe it or not, could have used more cheese. The sour cream was an interesting touch, most people thought it was ricotta.

I just made this for dinner tonight for my family.  I have 2 picky eaters, and they devoured everything on their plate! You'll want to make sure to use a really flavorful spaghetti sauce, as there are no other spices added. Very delicious, will definitely make again and again!

A great meal that's easy to prepare.  I divided the recipe into two 8x8 pans and froze one for later.  Once it was frozen solid, I knocked the ziti out of the pan like a brick and dropped it in a freezer bag for storage.  My whole family is looking forward to having this again!

This was very good. My husband does not care for sour cream so I added more shredded cheese to make up for any lack in flavor. Don't be afraid to load it on...I thought I was using too much and it turns out that it was not enough. I also used an Italian four cheese blend, which I definetly recommend. I don't like onions so I used a ton of minced onions instead and also added some garlic salt to the hamburger meat mixture for added flavor and it was yummy! The recipe stated it took an hour to make, but it sure didn't seem that long!!

The only change I made was to sub cottage cheese for the sour cream. Other than that, we really liked the flavor and I loved the ease.

This received great reviews from my team of new recipe critics!  This makes enough food for an army, I'd say with salad and bread you could easily serve 12 from this.  I added lots of fresh basil and hot italian sausage to the ground meat.  I liked the creaminess and taste the sour cream provides.  Cheese lovers could double that provolone and actually repeat it on the second layer.  Very tasty, thanks for sharing!

Excellent pasta dish.  My teenagers loved it as did my husband.  I have made this for family as well as a potluck dish for my sons' football teams and hockey teams and there is never any leftover.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  I didn't tweak it at all. GREAT!

My husband liked it.  I thought it was just okay.  Tastes like spaghetti to me.  Maybe next time I'll try a homemade sauce or just a different one.  I think it has potential

Great - very cheesy and different with provolone and sour cream, I add even more - we leave out the ground beef because of vegetarians in the house.

I used a Penne Pasta as I'm not sure what Ziti is. Other than that I followed the recipe correctly and it turned out great. Served with a garden salad & garlic bread. My husband loved it.

This was a good recipe. I didn't think my husband would like it and he did. Great flavor, easy to make, and it makes ALOT! It's just the two of us so I might make half the recipe next time, but it would be great for guests with salad and breadsticks!

Thought this recipe is okay not sure what all the fuss is about.  I think to make it special you need to make your own marinara sauce or a really good sauce in a jar.  I found the sour cream a little too rich.

I used wheat rotini because the store was out of wheat ziti, but i think the rotini is better anyway because it holds onto the sauce better.  I also left out the meat and provolone and added a bit more mozzarella.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings but the finished product even without the meat seemed more like 6 servings.  I thought the sour cream added a great flavor and I used my favorite pasta sauce.  All in all this recipe was great, I ate almost the whole batch in an hour!  I didnt think the leftovers were nearly as good however.  Best eaten immediatley after making.

Great recipe!  The sour cream adds just the right zing.  Even good as leftovers.  I did switch the order of layering the ingredients like others suggested.  I will be making this for my pasta loving husband often!

This was great!  I was a bit hesitant about using sour cream, as I have always made this with ricotta cheese, but wow - it was good.  The sour cream gives it a bit of a different taste, kind of a "twang" if you will.  This recipe is permanently replacing my current Baked Ziti recipe!

Mmmm...tasty!  I didn't follow the directions exactly.  Just kind of guesstimated amounts according to my taste.  I fried onions and mushrooms with the beef with italian seasoning and fresh garlic for some extra seasoning.  I used Newman's Own Garlic & Mushroom sauce, completely wonderful.  I then just mixed everything and baked with tin foil on top.  Delicious!!!  The sour cream makes it so creamy and dreamy.  :)

Excellent!  I used 1/2 lb. Italian sausage and 1/2 lb. ground beef and added a minced garlic clove.  I also used the chunky style tomato, garlic spaghetti sauce, and sprinkled some paprika and garlic salt on the top.  I've been looking for an easy recipe like this for a long time!  Will become a "regular" in our house; it was enjoyed!

Very good!!! Used the suggestion of mixing the sour cream with the mozzarella and tossing with the ziti ... layered that in the pan first followed by sauce then provolone - rest of the ziti mix, more sauce, topped with parm cheese.   Chose not to use any meat because was serving it with meatballs.

I followed the directions but it didn't turn out to be what i expected. With all the great reviews, i thought this would be so delicious but i was let down. I used Emeril's spaghetti sauce.. thinking a more expensive sauce would work better but it turned out to be watery. I will not be useing this recipe again.

This is a wonderful recipe, both delicious and simple to make. The only change I made was to lightly sprinkle the cheese layers with garlic salt for an added bit of flavor.

The recipe tasted a litte crunchy and dried out on the top. I thought this would deter my guests from liking the dish, but they all said they really liked it. After reading other's review I have to agree that baking it in the oven covered w/ foil would be best. I am sure that the next time I make it that it will come out wonderfully. Also, I added lots of extra cheese b/c my husband LOVES cheese.

I started using this recipe about 3 years ago and neglected to comment about how marvelous it is until today!  Although I do make my own sauce, I follw the rest of this recipe to a T and it is always a HUGE hit.  Now whenever we have a pot luck at work I am asked to bring it!  Love the recipe - thanks Colleen!!

The only thing I would add to this perfect recipe is fresh minced GARLIC!  Thanks Colleen!  You should also use the Ragu sauteed onion and garlic spaghetti sauce with a yellow sweet onion.

This was delicious and very easy to put together. The blend of cheeses was great! This makes a large amount, so I froze 1/2 to enjoy at a later date.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did add seasonings to my hamburger and onion mixture.  The recipe was very easy to fix and also easy to divide in half as I have only two people in my family.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this recipe.  Everytime, rave reviews by young and old!!  So simple and easy!  Sometimes I make it the night before (minus the parmesan cheese) and then when I'm ready the next day, sprinkle with the parmesan and pop into the oven. Thanks for sharing, Colleen!

Wonderful, rich, and super-easy to make, with or without the meat.  I've made a variation on this where I omitted the ground beef and added lots of chopped veggies, like zuchini and peppers, which is a great dish to serve when you have both vegitarians and meat-eaters. Everyone enjoys this one. Very hearty and tasty.

This is one of my boyfriends favorite meals, I love it too.  I don't use quite as much sour cream - probably 3/4 cup - and add more mozzarella - at least 1 cup.  I also make my own spaghetti sauce, not a fan of the stuff straight from the jar.  What a great meal, and great leftovers too!

My husband said to rate this a 3, but I'm giving it a 4 since I used cheap sauce. A better quality sauce would have made this a pretty good dish instead of an average one. I'll probably make this a couple times a year for something a little different, but it won't be in heavy rotation at my home.

Loved it loved it loved it! Cut the recipe in half and it still fed five people. I used jarred pizza sauce and italian pork sausage. You need to find ways to sneak seasoning in there at every step. The italian sausage made a world of difference and I've made this many, many times.

This is a great dish. I have made it twice now and both husband and 3 year old son LOVE it! I added hot Italian sausage to it and it is absolutely delicious. 
I strongly recommend trying it.

Fantastic! My family loved this.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8" square pan. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I did use another poster's suggestion and stirred the sauce in with the pasta before layering it in the casserole.

This is a KEEPER!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I adjusted the servings to 4 instead of 8.  It was a perfect amount for a family of 4 people when paired with garlic bread and a salad.  The only changes I would make next time would be to add a little more sour cream and a little more cheese...I might also try cooking sweet italian sausage out of the casing instead of the ground beef for a little more spice.

This is an awsome recipe.  We ate it for 3 days!!! I think next time I will leave out the ground beef and onion as it would cost less, taste just as good and be easier to make.  (As if it isn't easy enough. :)) I used 8oz of mozzarella instead of the 6oz.  Also, I added a bit of Romano to the top and left out the parmesan cheese.

Delicious.  This recipe is great.  I made it meatless because we had my family over for dinner and my sister is vegetarian.  Everybody loved it.  I will be making this again for sure, next time with some meat!  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

This was excellent, my husband usually doesnt like anything that has spaghetti sauce in it but with this he went back for seconds!  I didnt use two full jars of sauce, I used about 1 and a half, I also layered as follows: pasta, sauce, provolone, pasta, mozzerella, sauce, parmesean.  I will definately be making this again!

I thought this was really yummy.  I actually doubled the meat to make it more hearty and it turned out great!  I almost liked it better left-over.  The only thing I would reccommend is make SURE you use a good sauce... I tried Prego for the first time and didn't really care for it.  Will make again!!!

September: Made it a second time using BERTOLLI FOUR CHEESE sauce... it was wonderful!

"Mom! This stuff ROCKS!" said my boys...My husband said it was better than his mother's!  I've been waiting to hear those words from him for 10 years!  They fought over the leftovers!  I'll be making this often.  Especially when my Mother-In-Law comes for dinner!!!!!
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was really good, everyone got seconds. I used Paul Newman's marinara sauce and turkey sausage. I also used half sour cream and half ricotta, because my boyfriend was leery of the sour cream. I also added a few cloves of garlic for added flavor. Very tasty!

This is the first really good recipe I've gotten off the website "as is". I didn't alter the actual recipe and it tasted really good. It's easy and like the author says do it the day before to allow the flavors to meld.

As a college student I rate most of these recipes on how idiot proof and quick recipes are to make.  This recipe is all of that and more.  My roomates ate two whole trays of this one night and I am still getting requests.  Loved it!  I will definately be making this again.

Fantastic recipe for Italian food lovers who are not fans of ricotta. The sour cream is wonderful. It makes a ton of food, so plan for lots of leftovers or to share with others!

Very good.  I liked the sour cream/provolone cheese combo in the middle layer.  I did not have quite 6 oz. of provolone and it made a difference - you need the full 6 oz.  I took the advise of other reviews and only used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce and should have stuck with the 2 jars as in the recipe.  I used the ridged ziti and it soaked up the sauce.  Layer as follows:  ziti, sauce, provolone, sour cream, ziti, sauce, parmesan cheese and then mozzarella.  Took to a potluck and it was all eaten.  Someone said it tasted just like ziti at Fazoli's.

This is the 2nd time I have made this dish. The first time it was ok...very dry. This time I took the advice of one  reviewer and used Bertolli five cheese spaghetti sauce(which tasted great). I also mixed the sauce in with the noodles on the bottom layer and layered the dish as suggested by some of the other reviewers. No more dry baked ziti! Great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe!!  It was not only awesome when freshly baked, but eating it re-heated was almost as good!!  My daughter (who is usually picky) and I ate this everyday for lunch until it was gone.  Very good!!!  This will become a regular in our house.

Great! We thought it was even better as left overs because we heated up more sauce and poured over it. I can't believe what big portions everyone ate. Thanks!

This recipe was good.  I think I may have expected a bit more.  I scaled it down to 4 servings through the 'scale down' feature on the site and omitted the meat.  I sauteed onion and garlic together and then added the sauce.  Barilla makes a sauce called Al Forno-Italian Baking Sauce.  I use this sauce with all my baked pasta dishes and it is excellent. I sometimes add some left over red wine to the sauce near the end of simmering.  I think the next time I will use more cheese and sour cream to make up for not using meat.  The half recipe called for 3/4 sour cream, but it could have used 1 1/4 cup.  Instead of 3 oz. each of the provolone and mozzerella in the half recipe, it could be 6 ozs.  Sauce amount was perfect, but probably will need a bit more with added cheeses. I will make it again.

Yummy!  This was a nice change from classic lasagne.  I was skeptical about using the sour cream, but it really added a wonderful flavor to the dish.  The only thing I did different was, I made a meatball mix with the hamburg and then browned the meat.  Thans for sharing!

Very Good.  I used extra cheese, sausage crumbles with some red pepper flaked thrown in to give it some heat.  My husband loved this and the sour cream layer is wonderful.

Hey all yall cooks.
This was Very good. No alterations needed. Only thing I did add was seasoning, Italian seasoning & seasoning salt, to the sauce I bought, which originally tasted bland. But the recipe itself was off the hook.

Everyone loved this recipe, I didn't use as much sauce as it called for and I cut back on the sour cream a little.  It was very good, this is a keeper for our family.

This recipe is superb. I halved the recipe for my family of four and had plenty - plus leftovers!  I chose to use just Prego sausage and garlic and it gave a very meaty hearty flavor which my husband really liked.  It turned out tasting like a really great lasagna but was sooooo much easier to make and so much easier for my kids to eat than traditional lasagna.  Like lasagna, just be sure to keep your dish covered until the last 5 minutes so that it stays nice and moist.  Very Yummy!  Goodbye lasagna hello baked ziti!

This was a pretty good baked ziti recipe. I was unsure about the sour cream so I didn't use it but I did like the idea of using sliced cheeses.

My husband is very picky when it comes to pasta dishes, but he LOVED this one, he ate 3 helpings! Next time I make this I plan on halving the recipe and adding ground turkey, ricotta cheese instead of sour cream and italian sausage.

WOW...I didn't know homemade ziti could taste so good.  I made it exactly as stated and it turned out perfectly.  My husband, kids, and drop-in company LOVED it.  Hubby wanted me to make it again the next night!!
For those few who rated the recipe low, I think the key may be to use the very best sauce you can.  I used one jar of Classico Four Cheese and one jar of Classico Sausage.  Any reciped an only be as good as the ingredients you start with!
Can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It tasted just as good or better than restaurant ziti!!

Absolutely Fabulous!!!  Very light compared to ziti made with ricotta.  Everyone loved it and they ask for it every time we have a gathering.  The only change I make is I use homemade tomato sauce.  I still have not found a jar sauce I like.

We have a family at church in need of a meal so I made one for them and another for my family. When my husband took the first bite he said "It passes...you can take it to the family at church!" My husband, son and very picky daughter loved it...suggested a little garlic salt. I don't eat red meat but look forward to making the meatless version as a side dish so that I can try it! This one is a keeper!

Very easy recipe to follow and put together. It was pretty good I gave it a 4 because I didn't care for the sour cream in it. The second time I made it I substituted the cream for ricotta cheese. Much better. I used spicy sauce to give it a kick.

I make this all the time now--it's really good. VERY saucy, which my boyfriend and I both like. The only things I did differently were add ricotta instead of sour cream, and shredded cheese instead of slices. Also added hot turkey italian sausages instead of ground beef. It's yummy.

This was very yummy! I am a lasagna lover, but will be making this more often in the future. My husband loved that it tasted like lasagna, but in his words, it was more "free". I did alter the recipe however. I used 2 cups of sour cream, 16 oz. of mozz. cheese, and next time I will make more sauce. I used my own marinara sauce. Some like more pasta than sauce, but I like equal amounts, and found that the it was a bit drier than I would like it. I omitted the meat as well. It was really good though! Thanks for sharing!

this is really great. I added finely chopped garlic into the beef for a bit more flavor and found that cutting the sour cream in half made the taste blend better, so it wasn't over powering.

Wonderful!  Kids loved it.  I did add sauce before the cheese when I did the layers.  I halved it - put some in a smaller casserole dish for us, froze the rest for later.  Only thing I might change would be to make a bit more sauce.

This was really good.  I am a lasagna lover, and this is just as good as lasagna but a lot easier to prepare.  I did increase the 3 cheeses to 8 oz. and  the sour cream to 2 cups.  This recipe is even better when reheated the next day.

VERY good! I did however omit the sour cream. I took this to my Bible study group and came home with no leftovers:)

I gave this 3 stars because I was the only one that liked this, I liked the changed from the usual ricotta cheese, although I prefer the ricotta I love sour cream so this worked for me, but didn't work for the family especially the kids.

This was VERY tasty, both my husband and myself loved it.  I only used one jar of spaghetti sauce as two seemed a bit much.  Next time I would probably omit the cream and add more cheese, too.

Delicious. Used grated Italian cheese blend (instead of provolone and mozzarella) and garlic-parmesan sauce. It made a ton- would be great for a picnic or to take to a party.

This is a great recipe. I've made it twice, both times making a triple batch. It freezes well. Husband, grandkids loved it. Also took it to church potluck and it was a hit.

Fantastic!  I didn't realize until I started making this that I didn't have any sour cream, so I used a mixture of Alfredo sauce and ricotta cheese instead.  My family loved it!  My husband wants me to try it again with the sour cream, though, just to see what the difference would be.  I'm sure my kids will be asking for it again soon!

Great recipe, one of my boyfriend's favorites. Added red and green pepper, garlic and italian seasonings. Also put in 8 oz of mozarella instead of 6 and more parmesean. It makes a lot! Probably more like 10 servings.

This was very good. The only thing I would change is reduce the amount of spaghetti sauce. I tried this recipe with ground turkey instead of the beef and it was good. It taste even better a few days later.

This was an easy and delicious dinner.  I browned the beef w/garlic and salt& pepper. Added ground pepper flakes for a little kick as well.  Would definitely make again.

I also was leery of the sour cream/tomato sauce mixture but that combo was the best feature.  It tasted much better than most recipes that call for ricotta.  Our family loved it...even the toddler!  Next time I will try and add more veggies and experiment with some lower fat ingredients.  I used half ground beef and half Italian sausage, which was good but I think no ground beef and all Italian sausage would be better.  It needed a little bit more spice.  This is going to become a staple!  Thanks!

This was really good! I thought the sour cream and tomato sauce would be weird, but it wasn't. The sour cream made it really creamy, unlike when I have made it before with ricotta cheese.

I make this for my family often. In fact, my family prefers this dish over lasagna! I omitted the Provolone and grated longhorn cheddar and mozzarella together. I used Prego sauce (w/mushrooms) and added 1 tablespoon of sugar to tone down the acids and give more flavor.

This was very good!  I've been very disappointed with some of the 5 star ratings on this site, but this was definitely a good one.  My husband loved it and couldn't stop eating it!  He loves lasagna and this was a similar taste.  I've finally found a dish that I can take to parties.  Thanks!

The recipe was really good. I used Kraft Italian cheese mix which has parmesan, mozzarella, provolone, and emmental. I also added mushrooms and used a garlic and herb tomatoe sauce. It was a big hit with my son, he ate about an adult size serving and ate it once again two hours later. I will definetly be making this again

I needed a ziti recipe for a special occassion and found this one.  I was asked to leave the meat out for a vegetarian guest.  I made a test batch to make sure the hostess liked it.  I added an extra 4oz. of mozzarella cheese to make up for the meat.  The hostess loved it and so did my family.  She even requested I make extra as she thought the kids will eat this over other foods being served.  I'm giving her a copy of the recipe at the bridal shower as I'm sure she will make it many times and I know that will please my son. Note - I used Hunt's canned sauce instead of jarred. This recipe is more moist than others. Enjoy!

Great easy recipe!  I used yogurt instead of sour cream and penne instead of ziti.  My 9x13" pan was very full and overflowed just a bit onto a well-placed cookie sheet.  Perhaps the penne took more space than ziti.  This dish was well received by the family!

Very good.  The sour cream disappears into the dish and adds a pop of extra flavor.  We will be making this again soon.

Great recipe. I've made this quite a few times and have found that the kind of speghetti sauce you use makes a big difference. I used the cheap stuff once and it tasted like the sauce from speghetti'o's. Yuck! I will continue to make this recipe often but will just use speghetti sauce I know is good.

This is very easy and tasty, but I was slightly disappointed.  With such great reviews, I thought for sure that this was going to something fantastic, yet it was pretty average.  I will make it again, because it was good, but I may try using a better spaghetti sauce next time (I used the cheap kind).

I've made this recipe a few times now and it has been a huge hit each time.  The last couple of times I made it with Lasagna noodles instead of ziti and I added an extra pound of ground beef, my family could eat it every night.  They Love It!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Coming from a college student who eats a lot of pasta and spaghetti sauce this was a great change of pace.  Very tasty!

O my gosh!- I went to the grocery store and was just going to make spaghetti or lasagna or something with pasta- i just KNEW i had mozzarella and parmesan cheese in the fridge- well wouldn't you know..I boiled the pasta ( which i didn't have the ziti...i had a differnt kind of wavy noodle some other type of macaroni pasta...???) i used the sour cream ( fat free BTW-) and i used cheese sticks i had ..i grated them up - (it was the kind with the mozzarella and cheddar0 and i had cream cheese and grated parmesan in the can- 

all i can say is YUM! - i added onion powder and minced garlic when i was browning the ground beef, i added a touch of sugar and some more Italian seasonings-  substituted the grated cheese sticks in place of provolone/mozzarella in the bag- then put chunks of cream cheese ( yes i was worried...cream cheese in a pasta dish...don't know if i have ever heard of that...but i had to put some other cheese!- didn't want to try american cheese slices!)- i put the other half of sauce on top of the cream cheese, covered with a zillion shakes of the canned parmesan cheese...

just tasted it...WOW!

next time i will have all of the other cheeses, AND the cream cheese mixed into the sour cream, might also add the cottage cheese too!

I really don't think this dish could be bad!Even if you don't have all of the ingredients!!!!

I just cooked this last night, and my husband loved it! Really easy to make, I didn't use meat, but I was able to season the sauce to perfection with some pepper, onions, and crushed garlic. Makes a ton, but you can always have leftovers.

I don't think I'll go back to plain old baked ziti again!  I modified just based on what I had in the house...no ziti, instead used a mix of elbow, medium shells and some salad pasta that I had leftover.  Also used leftover mozzarella slices and no provolone.  I baked in a sqare casserole dish.  The sour cream really adds a creaminess and an extra flavor kick.  Will make again!!

Ok, I am eating leftovers of this as I type this review. LOL it is SO good leftover too!! THis was easy to make and I made it for company they loved it too! Makes a TON, a good change. I would NOT use sour cream again though, I would try ricotta cheese. The sour cream didnt melt or anything, just sat there and didnt really blend with the other flavors. Leftovers my husband would not eat because of it. Ricotta makes more sense.

I needed a quick recipe for an Italian club meeting and thought I would try this.  I tripled the recipe (for 24) and used a roasting pan, it was still very easy to put together.  The members loved it and took home extras.  I have even used it for company pot lucks and it's a big hit.  Thank you for an easy, quick recipe.

I didn't have any provolone, so I mixed the sour cream with about 1 cup of ricotta and some chopped fresh chives.  All 3 of my kids had seconds, and that is remarkable.

Great recipe!!!!

Wow, just wow.  Everyone absolutely loved this, even though I messed up!  Always make sure that you use the right sized pan!  Otherwise, messes are made while having it overflow (it stayed pretty much in the pan though).  I added some crushed red pepper and cayenne as well to the sauce because we like a little kick.

Yum! Yum! Yum! This was awesome! I'd had it before in resturants so I decided to suprise my boyfriend with a super good homecooked meal. This turned out great. I halved the recipe, but not the meat and cheeses. haha. I also added fresh mushrooms. I will definately make this one again. I'm looking forward to the leftovers

This is so good, and so simple to make.  With a family of 5 I can make this every week, and it's gone usually in a day or two at the most.

Thanks for sharing. We will definately make again and again!

I made this one night and my mom and my husband wouldn't quit saying how good it was.  I thought the sour cream might be overpowering but they said it was perfect and not to change a thing.

I made this dish, tho I substituted Marinara sauce for the spaghetti sauce and used more mozzarella cheese instead of the provolone and added Italian seasonings to the ground beef.  My boyfriend and I loved it!  It was very delicious.  This recipe makes a lot of food.

This is the best baked pasta dish that I have ever tried. I did not add the meat or the onion. I made it for a friend who just had a baby, she loved it, her husband who does not like red sauce loved it and her 5 & 3 year old kids loved it too. Then I made it for my own family and even my picky 2 & 3 year olds gobbled it down. Try this one, you will not be sorry! FYI: I used Ragu Parmesan & Romano sauce, it was excellent.

This recipe is great.  It tastes like the baked ziti at my favorite local Italian restaurant.  I used homemade sauce and a mixture of sour cream and ricotta cheese.  My family will be enjoying this again.

I had to make this dish with the ingredients I had (i.e. used different pasta, no onions available, mexican style cheese rather than provolone) and my husband still said it was the best pasta dish I've made so far :o)

I haven't been a baked ziti fan but this recipe made me change my tune.  Usually the ziti is a little too dry for my taste but this recipe was just right.  The only change was I used a bit more mozzerella cheese than called for.

This is a very good recipe - good solid Italian
comfort food that everybody loves!  We have 
made it probably half a dozen times - sometimes
just for ourselves and sometimes for our families.
*Note*:  Unless you are really watching fat, I
recommend *not* using fat free sour cream in this.
My in-laws bought such when we made it at their
house, and it greatly reduced the taste - too
costly for the amount of fat per serving saved.
Fight that battle elsewhere...

QUICK!! DELICIOUS!! Even better than Lasagna.  This is a keeper.  I even used 1/2 of the sour cream and 1/2 of the sauce.  I used low fat ingredients. I also rinsed off the beef put garlic in it.  Split it into 2 pans (one to freeze). The BEST PART I sprayed the pans, and there was virtually NO MESS!! AMEN

Delicious, great company dish, i've made it with ziti and with penne.  I've used half sour cream and the other half as cottage cheese and once as ricotta cheese. I've also made it all sour cream, any way I make it turns out excellent, highly recommended!

This was really wonderful.  We "health-ed" it up using whole wheat pasta and adding veggies to the sauce. The best part?  My kids ate it right up and wanted more!  Definately a "keeper" recipe.

I recently found out my 14 month old is allergic to eggs-so my own tried and true baked ziti recipe is out. I made this last night and it was wonderful. I didn't have ground beef so I chopped up some meatballs and used them instead. I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is excellent!  Rather than buttering the bottom of the pan I spread enough sauce to cover the bottom.  I also only used approximately
32 ounces of sauce in the recipe.

My family enjoyed this, it made a lot so I split it with my neighbor. Next time I'll use 2 smaller pans as suggested. Substituted the sour cream for ricotta and sauted garlic with the hamburger. Very cheesy and creamy. Will be making again. Thanks

This was much better then a previous recipe used (will eat the leftovers vs throwing them out). Only added garlic while browning meat and onions. A keeper for sure.

Excellent and easy recipe. *Do* use the sour cream -- made for a great consistency. Due to cost, I used only mozarella cheese, and it turned out perfect. Plus, I used a combination of hot Italian sausage (removed from casing) and the ground beef. I also covered for 20 minutes while baking and uncovered the last 10 mins. The dish got raves from my partner, and I will be sure and serve it to guests.

I don't eat beef, but I still wanted the dish to be hearty so I added in sauteed chicken and some spinach too. Layering was no problem--followed the recipe and the bottom layer of ziti was flavorful. Also, did not baked it covered, and it wasn't dry--not even the leftovers the next day. (Could be just oven differences.) Very yummy!

This was a very good pasta dish that my whole family enjoyed. The sour cream added a different taste to it. I'm sure I'll make it again some time.

This is a good basic ziti recipe. It is a great way to use frozen leftover sauce. I made it lower in fat by using fat free sour cream with just 1/2c of reg. sour cream and part skim mozzerella. It was delicious and quick to make!

This recipe was easy and excellent!  I served it with grilled pork chops, so substituted sliced mushrooms for the ground beef in the sauce. I knew I had a winner when my son, who isn't a fan of pasta dishes, had seconds!  This was a major hit at my house.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner.  My husband loved it and so did I.  My hubby liked it better than Lasagna. It was easy to prepare and delicious.  I used Penne pasta instead of Ziti since I couldn't find Ziti pasta.  I followed a lot of the suggesions by other reviewers: adding garlic to the ground beef;layering it the Ziti, then the sauce, provolone, sour cream, Ziti, remaining sauce and mozzarella.  Also do bake it covered!

This was absolutely delicous we would like to rate it 4.5 stars (I reserve 5 stars for "to die for" meals), and while this was definitely good and I will make it again - it only gets 4.5 stars because I'm not a big lover of Italian food.  My DH on the other hand would like to rate it 7 stars :).  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some garlic (about 2 large cloves)to the ground beef mixture along with about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and two bay leaves.  The sour cream gives an excellent flavour and consistency to this dish - loved it!

As suggested by other reviewers, used ricotta instead of sour cream.  For bottled sauce, used Classico Tomato and Basil.  We also used about 3/4 pound of ziti and it fit into the 9x11 fine.  Great recipe!

I am updating my review because now it deserves 5 stars. I made it with Mild Italian sausage(removed casing) this time, switched the sour cream to ricotta and added more mozzarella. Yum! Hubby's new favorite!! Kids loved it too.

This was pretty good. My husband said, we could add this to the weekly rotation while i'll make it again will probably be a once a month or less thing. My daughter ate two bowls. She is a very finnicky eater. I only added one jar of spaghetti sauce and next time I think I"ll add a can of tomatoes in with the sauce.

Even though my family liked this, I have to say that I didn't find this to be appetizing at all. I was expecting something wonderful and it really wasn't any different than any other pasta dish. In fact, I found this to be my least favourite pasta dish. I don't think I'll try it again.

My family loves this recipe. It's simular to lasagna, but much easier I think. I always make 8 servings and freeze the leftovers. My only complaint is that every time I make this there is a bunch of water at the bottom of the baking dish. I've tried everything to prevent this and for some reason it always happens. It is still an excellent recipe.

I was a little nervous about making this recipe - I was unsure how the sour cream would taste in a pasta dish.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely added something different to the flavor.  My husband liked it and my very picky 6 year old loved it - so I will definitely be making it again!

"Homerun" were the words used by my family to describe this meal. I did not make changes and none are needed! Great as leftovers. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe! I added a little more parmasean cheese because we love it. And, I served sauce on the side for those that wanted a little bit more. Add salad and garlic bread and you have a very good and filling meal!

Excellent!!!  1,110 people can't be wrong!  I made this when we had surprise guests for supper.  It was easy and yummy!  There was more than enough to feed everyone with left overs for a couple of days!  This recipe is now one of my staples.  Thanks so much!

I've made this dish countless times in the past and we all loved it. Then I went low-carb, and cut out pasta. I just made it last night using Dreamfield's pasta (low net-carbs). It was heavenly!!!

This recipe is delicious. I've made it many times over the last year and it never disappoints. It is easy and makes great leftovers too! My only addition is turkey sausage in the sauce and a little more cheese.

Prepared this as directed and the guys absolutley loved it.  Great recipe and easy to fix -- you definitely want a large baking dish though...I only had a 9x13 dish and had some overflow/drips in the oven.

UPDATED REVIEW - I tried this again last night, and I have to say it was awesome this time!  I did add hot Italian sausage to the meat mixture this time, and it made a world of difference for us.  Delicious!  I was out of provolone, so I added more mozzarella, and threw in a little ricotta too.  Very, very good.  Company raved.  Can't wait to have the leftovers!

This was a good baked ziti recipe.  But, I made some changes based on comments by other posters as well as what my husband and I like.  These are the variations that I made: 1) I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site rather than the jars.  2) I used ricotta cheese mixed with one egg instead of the sour cream.  And, I mixed the ricotta and egg in with the cooked ziti.  3) I cubed the mozzarella rather than shredding it.  4) I added two cloves of minced garlic while browning the meat.  5) I used half a pound of beef and half a pound of pork sausage.  6) I put a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of thye baking pan.  7) At the top of the ziti, I covered it with slices of provolone, slices of mozzarella, and grated cheese.  8) I baked it covered for 30 minutes, and uncovered for another 15 minutes.  
With these variations, it turned out great!!!

I LOVE THIS DISH!!  And so does everyone else I've served it to.  The only thing I changed was the order of the layers, I didn't like the meat sauce mixture on top.

Made this for a holiday potluck and it was a big hit.  As suggested, I used ricotta cheese in place of sour cream for a creamer flavor and I used spicy sausage instead of beef. Next time I will add some garlic and maybe some more spice to give it more heat. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I had to adjust the recipe a bit to accomodate only myself and my husband.  As a result, there was way too much onion.  Nothing I can't fix.  I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks.

This recipe was alright. It's not something you call home to mom about. It is good for nights where you have most of the ingredients and you're going to the store anyways. I am not sure whether I would make it again or not.

Recipe was very good and simple.  I did make a couple of changes.  Used half ground beef and half italian sausage, and used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet (from this site also) instead of spaghetti sauce.  Family requested to make regularly.  thanks!

I have made this several times now.  It is delicious.  I use wine flavored sauce which gives it an extra kick.  Also, I usually toss in the entire bag of shredded mozzerella since I get 8 oz. packages.  A little extra cheese, yum!  Love this!

I took the basic recipe and made a lot of changes. I took out the beef, did only 1 can of sauce, instead of provolone i used cheddar, didn't use any parm. cheese and it turned out great! My roommate loved it! There is a lot left over too!

This is a really good recipe.  I've made it a few times now.  I don't like meat very much so I usually throw some sauteed portabello mushrooms in instead of the meat or just make it totally meatless.  I've taken this to work and everyone really liked it.  I will make this recipe again for sure.

My husband made this.  He is cooking once a week to learn how, so I gave him this recipe after hearing how it was an easy version of lasagna.  It was okay ... it isn't that much quicker ... and I wouldn't substitute it for the taste of lasagna.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't great.

I cooked this last night and my family loved it :>) I did change the sour cream to ricotta cheese, only because I like the firmness that you get from it. I also added some Italian seasonings to the meat mixture as it cooked. I served it along with a tossed salad and garlic toast. I will cook this again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Great recipe. The only thing I did different was add mushrooms, garlic powder and only used 1 1/2 jars sauce.  It turned out great.  Thanks.

This was very good, but it needed a bigger kick. Next time, I will add lots of garlic. I loved the sour cream, it was a nice change.

We didn't feel it needed so much sauce and meat, but we thought the flavors were great together.

This is the perfect recipe. Simple and delicious!! The only thing I ever do differently is season the beef to taste as I brown it and make sure to drain beef before adding sauce!! First time made with minced onions, second time with real onions. Either way was mmmm mmmmm good. In fact, last time I made 12 servings and 8 people (2 of them being kids) devoured it all!!

As a person who it not a fan of pasta, I looked up this recipe for a family dinner. It was so fast and easy to make. After giving it the "taste test", I couldnt believe how creamy and cheesy it was. I was amazed! My family raved and raved about it. Even my boyfriend that feels nothing tastes as great as his mothers, was complimenting me. Thank you for this delicious dish!

Truly delicious. I was a little skeptical about the lack of extra seasonings, but the dish really doesn't need it. I accidentally only used one jar of pasta sauce, but the consistency was perfect for our tastes in the end. Thanks for a new family classic!

Very good!  It was a hit with everyone!  I thought the sour cream would be a bit much or make it taste funny, but it was so good.  :)

This was AMAZING!  The only change I made was to use sliced Mozzarella instead of shredded b/c I thought I would be easier to spread the sour cream over that.  It turned out perfectly!

This recipe was all right. I added more parmesan cheese to top of everything than the recipe called for. It made a lot for my family of 3, we had lots leftover.  We also salted this after trying the first bite and it tasted much better. It was easy enough to make, but I probably won't fix it again.

Excellent and Easy dish!  This is such a rich dish and very easy to make.  I like a bit more spice, so I would add some red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper.  I didn't have any parmesan on hand, and it tasted fine without.

I have to say, that this recipe is great, and really simple to make. I read everyone else's reviews, so then I modifed the recipe by using 2 different sauces, and I left out the sourcream and added ricotta cheese. Also I did use garlis salt, so anyway that you make this it really is an awesome recipe.

This is absolutely the best pasta dish I've ever made.  I like to add more sour cream and more provolone to this and I like to use a florentine spaghetti sauce.  It's delicious.

It was pretty tasty....I mixed a bit of cottage cheese in with the sour cream because I happened to have some in the fridge. I liked the taste a lot. I also added some fresh garlic with the hamburger and used a couple of kinds of sauce. I think this is a good hearty, quick and easy meal!

This is so easy and good!!  I like the variety with trying different sauces.  And with a new baby, I appreciate this speedy recipe.   Only, I use ricotta cheese instead of sour cream-- just as easy and more in line with the lasagna taste I think this recipe is going for.

This makes quite a big dish of pasta.  I tried to half the recipe, but after only one layer, I ended up having to use a second dish for the overflow.  I may have used too much beef.  I sautéed green pepper, mushrooms, and minced garlic with the onions for extra veggies.  I would also recommend adding some italian seasonings to it as well.  I did not add the provolone and it still tasted great.  This dish is open to adaptations, so don't be afraid to experiment with the ingredients!  My wife does not usually like "lagasna-type" dishes, but enjoyed this one.

Not a five star because of my own stupidity.  If a tomato based/pasta recipe doesn't call for garlic, I know that I should still add it.  But I didn't.  So, although this is oh, so yummy, it is not five stars until I make it again and add the garlic to the meat mixture as one other reviewer suggested.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Pretty Good! Used bow-tie and penne pasta because I didn't have ziti. Also used homemade spaghetti sauce.  We thought it could of used a little more seasoning, perhaps some garlic. Over all a tasty dish. Not quite a 5 star for us, but definitely good!

I made this recipe last night and it turned out great!!! I made a couple alterations to it. I doubled the meat for a meatier version and I did half sour cream to half cottage cheese. IT was delicious!!! Next time I'll use a deeper dish because it was thick!!

This recipe always brings rave reviews from even my pickiest eaters.  I use l/2 Italian sausage, crumbled fine while browning with l/2 lb. ground beef. I add rosemary, basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the jars of sauce.  I also use 3/4 c. Ricotta mixed with 3/4 c. sour cream.  This is
excellent!

We loved this recipe. My 2yr old wanted seconds!!! My husband hates sour cream but didn't even notice it in this ziti--I think it makes it moist. I did cut recipe in half though because it makes alot, we still had leftovers and it was even better the next day!!

I think my husband may never be able to get up after all he ate of this!!! It was great needless to say. I must, however, agree with others that this makes a LOT and a bigger pan should be used. I didn't have foil to cover like I wanted so it wouldn't dry out so I reduced the time in the oven by 10 min with no side effects. Good luck all! This was fabulous!

Nothing thrilling, actually bland. It did taste better the second day, like most pasta dishes. Still I would not waste my efforts again on making this dish.

My whole family LOVED this pasta dish, even my very picky son.  This makes a huge batch.  The recipe says 8 servings, but it is more like 16 servings.  I added some fresh garlic with the meat and onions, and used Prego with fresh mushrooms.  Delicious!

Yummy! Followed previous suggestions about 1/2 ricotta and 1/2 sour cream. Added a can of chopped spinach. Fit the whole shebang easily into a 10x15 casserole dish (thanks to other reviewers warning about the 9x13!). Covered as well. Hubby agreed that it tastes just lasagna, however we both agree that it's the BEST tasting ever! Thanks!

Very good!  We had this last night and I had some of the leftovers for lunch.  The flavors are great and it made a lot.  I spiced up the sauce and didn't use all of the pasta.  Will make again!

Really great!  I skipped the onion and used onion powder instead and added red pepper to the sauce for some spice. I served with garlic bread!  A BIG HIT!

The recipe was good, but was lost with too much onion. I recommend using a smaller portion just enough for seasoning the meat. Will definitely try again!

Excellent.  Couldn't find ziti in my small grocery store, so went with penne pasta instead, and used a 4 cheese italian blend instead of the provolone.  It turned out excellent, with a lot of leftovers for work lunches.  Re-heats up great in the microwave.  Both children loved it.  Thank you!

I felt the taste of the provolone was overwhelming.  If I make this again, I will use ricotta and moz. only and omit the provolone.  My 9 year old refused to eat it, my 5 year old liked it said "MMMMMM" as soon as he took a bite, and my 11 year old said it was just "OK".  My husband said it tastes like lasagna.

Yum! Yum! This dish was very good. The sour cream is a wonderful change of pace from ricotta, which to me can sometimes overpower a recipe. Like others,I used an italian shredded cheese blend. Of course, like most pasta dishes, this was even better for lunch the next day. Thanks for sharing!

A very good recipe.  I added additional spices to the spaghetti sauce.  Next time I make this recipe I'm going to add 2 cups of sour cream.  Very easy and very tasty.  It froze beautifully.  I thawed in the fridge and baked.  I'll make this recipe again.

This was ok but I should have subbed ricotta for the sour cream. The sour cream was the wrong flavor, we agreed. Overall good taste but doubt we'll eat all the leftovers of it.

This recipe is easy and yummy!  I only used mozzarella cheese, no provolone on hand.  I added soft tofu for protien and the kids did not even notice.   Thanks for a great EASY recipe!

I thought this was really tasty. We added a couple of zucchini, an entire bag of baby spinach (gotta get the veggies in there so the hubbster doesn't notice!) and we used sausage instead of ground beef. The store was out of regular provolone and only had smoked, so I skipped that and used mozzarella instead. Very hearty and good. Was even better the second day!

The single recipe makes A LOT, so be warned. You could easily halve the recipe and make a 9x9 pan. Spices were good and it was relatively quick and easy. The family really liked it!

This is a wonderful recipe! I use the 'best marinara sauce yet' recipe from this site rather than jar spaghetti sauce and it's fabulous.  I do put some sauce over the first layer of ziti because I'm afraid it will be dry but I don't think it really matters.  It tastes like lasagna but it's easier to make! Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was really good!  I made it tonight and everyone loved it.  But i did add a few ingredients. I added garlic, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to give the meat sauce a little more favor.  I also added ricotta cheese instead of parmesan.

This recipe is excellent! We have friends who request it when they come over. I use a chunky Ragu sauce, and skip the provolone in favor of more mozzarella, and I usually make it without meat. Delicious - and easy!

We love this baked ziti! The first time I made it just like the recipe. It was good, but a little dry. The next time I sauteed garlic with the onions and ground beef, used only 12oz of pasta instead of 16oz, used 8oz of provolone and 16oz of mozzarella. I used Emeril's marinara sauce. It was wonderful! Even the kids loved it.

I have probably made this 20 times since last summer and it gets rave reviews from everyone that tastes it.  I use the Classico four cheese sauce and add sugar as a previous reviewer suggested.  Also, I mix in a little sauce with the first layer of ziti. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

This was a easy recipe. I usually make Lasagne for parties. I made this at my last party and it was a hit. However, I used my own sauce. I also made little meatballs and put them in the ziti.

I varied the recipe for taste and because of ingredients I had on hand. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauteed with the onion. I used only one jar of spaghetti sauce and added 1/2 cup water (can't imagine using two jars of sauce... would be too much liquid for the other ingredients and would overflow a 9x13 pan). I added a small can of sliced mushrooms to the beef and sauce mix and sprinkled some basil into it. I mixed together 3/4 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of Ricotta (I didn't have any provolone).  Mixing them together made it easier and quicker to spread over the ziti.  As other reviewers suggested, I covered with foil and baked 30 minutes.  Then I removed foil and baked another 10 minutes.  Turned out super!  My husband raved!  Fairly quick putting it together and results were worth it! It's a keeper!

I made this dish for company I was having.  I put it on the table and explained it would be edible but maybe not that great because this was my first time making baked ziti.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was as well as how easy and cheap it was to make. There was plenty leftover to take to work or use the next night for dinner. I may try it next time w/o the meat. I made them with the mini italian meatball recipe which were fabulous.  This receipe is definitely a keeper.

I tried to make this a bit healthier by using light sour cream, a bit less cheese and half the ground beef.  After tasting it, we didn't feel the dish really needed the beef, so we may omit it next time and sub sliced mushrooms or other veggies instead.  Very filling!

I loved this dish. My girls and I don't eat a lot of ground meat, so I left it out and added sliced zucchini on top of the sour cream. Yummy! My 8 year old loved it.  Will definetly make again.

I added more ground beef and hot Italian sausage to the recipe.  I might try putting more provolone and sour cream while omitting the mozzarella and parmesan cheese next time for a different taste.

Fabulous!  I use prego traditional, this is my new favorite dish!  Goes great with a crusty garlic bread!  I use fat-free sour cream.  This is a great italian recipe that is not to be forgotten, a great change from the lasagna blues!

This was excellent!  I added garlic into the ground meat for a little extra flavor.  This makes a lot...use a really big pan.  Trying to get this into a 9x13 was not going to work.  I will make this again for sure.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. It seems so simple so I didn't understand the rave reviews until I tried it. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of sour cream. I used 3/4 sour cream and 3/4 ricotta. It was awesome and I will make this many many times.

Let me add another '5 stars' for this easy and delicious recipe. Make it for a quick family supper or for company, you will get so many compliments. And it only gets better when reheated! (if there is any leftover!) Great recipe as is or if you want to tweak it to your liking. This is one recipe that you will be remembered for!

It's a great basic recipe for ziti; i used my own meat sauce with ground turkey and reduced-fat sourcream and my hubby and his son loooved it. And said would have it again and again in the same week! Now the only problem i encountered was when i was portioning it out the sourcream looked curdled kinda like ricotta cheese; did this happen to anyone else? It's no biggy, but i was hoping it would be creamier. Very tasty all the same. Oh, i did cover it with a buttered foil cover so it wouldn't dry out, i think it helped and then removed it at the end of cooking and let the cheese melt for another 5-10 minutes. Yoo could use the broiler if you wanted that crispy golden touch. This one is a keeper. Thnx

Everyone, kids included, liked this one! I made it just as written, and had lots left over. Will definitely freeze half next time. I even used the cheapest spag. sauce (Hunts in a can). A winner!!

Delicious!  My husband couldn't eat it fast enough!  I used Italian sausage instead of the ground beef, 1 jar of sauce and a little less than the whole box of ziti.  I also only used about 1 cup of sour cream.  It was as good as any restaurant's!

This recipe changed the way I make pasta. I take it to potlucks at work, and it has become a family favorite. I usually double the recipe so that I can freeze one for future use.

This was very tasty, but I did scale the recipe down a bit. It makes a lot! I was also sceptical about the sour cream, but it somehow adds something.

I didn't see the big deal with this. It was good but not great as expected. It got compliments, but not extreme ones or requests for recipes so it may have just been my guests being nice. It did taste a little better reheated as other reviewers stated. I maight try it again and play around with it.

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. I would have preferred a baked spaghetti or a pizza casserole dish I make that is similiar. If you like creamy, you might prefer this though.

Very good but it makes alot. I used ricotta cheese instead because my husband doesn't like sourcream. It is even better the next day.  It made alot so I froze half and ate it a week later. Put an extra slice of provalon cheese on top and melt in microwave for 15 seconds.

I screwed this up and still liked it so it gets three stars for that.  I will have to try it again and see if I should go with the full five stars.  DH didn't care for it, but he ate it anyway and considering he doesn't like pasta that's an extra star!

Reminds me of the "American Lasagna" recipe, except it takes less time to make. I'll use a larger pan next time, though, seeing as I could hardly fit everything into the one I had. Very delicious.

AWESOME!  I used ground linguica instead of ground beef.  Found the end result a tad salty but we also used a lot of cheese.  Nonetheless, my boyfriend's teenage boys gobbled it down and had seconds.  The ultimate accolade!  This is a wonderful alternative to lasagna.  Anyone with an athlete who has to carbo-load before an event will find this recipe very useful.  It is now part of my pre-race recipe file (boyfriend runs long distance races).

My husband think he is an expert on Italian Food (his family is from Mississippi) and he LOVES this dish! I had made it one night and the next night they had brought the same thing in for his work from some catering company and he said this recipe was SOOOO much better that it made the catering version taste aweful! Thanks so much for this recipe.

Extremely good, especially for the first time ziti maker. I did follow one of the reviewer's suggestion on layering and that seemed to work out wonderfully. As a family of 2 1/2, we could not finish it all, so we froze and ate some about a week later.  Still YUMMY!!!

This is a great recipe.  I added dried Italian seasoning to my ground beef before browning & used Italian sausage spaghetti sauce.  It was a little dry to me so next time I think I'll use more sauce.  Overall a great recipe though.

This was ok. I expected more given the number of ratings it has gotten. I guess a lot depends on the brand of sauce you use, too.

So good! My family devoured this when I made it. I like to add a can of diced tomatoes w/ Italian seasonings or basil, garlic and oregano. It adds a little extra taste and is another serving of veggies.

This was a really good recipe.  Even my picky 3 year old ate it.  The only change I made was to add the sauce to the noodles on the bottom layer as other reviewers had suggested.  Next time I make this I will definetly cut back the sour cream to 1 cup instead of a cup and a half.  I could really taste the sour cream, it didn't seem to blend with the other flavors.  But, I think just cutting the amount I put in will work out perfectly.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I think this receipe would have been better with Italian sausage maybe and some garlic added to the meat sauce. I thought the taste was ok will probably try again but will make
 these changes.

My husband and his family are Italian and only eat home-made italian food. I used the jar sauce and ground sausage instead of beef and this was a smash. I never got so many compliments. This is the BEST baked ziti recipe!!!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It is very easy to make and freezes well.  I always use a meat substitute.  I swear by the Morning Star brand, which keeps the same consistency as ground beef.  This is definitely a great dish for all occasions.

Wow! Easy and very delicious.  My husband has dietary restrictions and happens to be rather picky, but absolutely RAVED about this recipe.  I halved everything across the board since it's just 3 of us, then baked it in an 11x14 dish.  No problems whatsoever.  I can't write any more, I'm now going back for seconds!

This recipe was quite easy, and got great reviews from the kids.  They wanted to eat the leftovers the next day instead of the meal I had prepared for them... what an endorsement!

This is one great recipe! I can't stress enough how easy it is. The leftovers are the best too. If you have a small group to feed BEWARE it makes a lot! I had put a note to myself to halve the recipe & I forgot about it. We have been eating on it the past 3 days! No complaints though. My husband likes for me to cook spaghetti. I needed a little change. This & the 'American Lasagna' recipe is a nice departure. I think the next time I will try to make up a sauce instead of using the jar sauces. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This was a good pasta recipe.  I added more garlic and layered the sourcream into two different layers.  It still lacked some flavor though.  My kids thought it was great.

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because it has to much sauce in the recipe. If you cut down on the sauce it is WONDERFUL!

I had never made ziti before but thought it would be a good dish to make for a crowd.  I made this on New Year's Eve and we ate it on and off throughout the evening, and had leftovers for lunch the next day.  It's delicious and reheats wonderfully.

This recipe was very good.  Just one word of caution . . . if the prepared sauce you use already has onion in it, you may want to cut back on the other whole, chopped onion that the recipe calls for.(unless you like to be overwhelmed and aren't kissing anyone for a while!)  Otherwise, this was excellent!  Thanks!

My whole family ages 3 on up LOVED this recipe and had 2nds!  Even my husband who is normally not into tomato sauce type recipes had more and loved it. :)  He also loved having some pepperoncini peppers on the side...said it was a great combo. This recipe made so much I was afraid it wouldn't all fit into the pan.  Wow! Truly feeds more than 8! :)
Thanks for the incredible recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe, though it does make a ton.  I think next time I'll cut the recipe in half, unless I'm serving a crowd.  I made it on Tuesday and we're still eating it on Friday!

This was great!  Used fat free sour cream and you couldn't even tell.  My boyfriend loved it and said it was even better as leftovers.  It makes such a big dish that it lasted us a week in leftovers...no complaints here tho!

This was pretty good.  Next time I will use my own sauce because I find that jarred sauces are much too sweet for my tastes!  My husband said it was too creamy for his liking but he doesn't like sour cream or ricotta so this recipe was then best I could find!

I wanted to reduce the high fat content in this recipe, so I used non-fat sour cream, and part-skim mozzarella.  I didn't have ziti, so I used rigoton pasta.  It was good but a little dry.  Next time, I will use more sauce.

I made this meal and I must say it is even better the following day.  I did use 2 bottles of spaghetti sauce instead of one and I seasoned the meat a bit.  I will definitely make again.

I've made this several times and given the recipe to a friend who has made it for her family. I used some review suggestions like adding some rosemary to the onion/garlic mix and I only used one jar of sauce instead of two. One jar makes it a lot less moist and brings the cheese out more (we love our cheese)

I made this tonight in place of our normal spaghetti and my whole family LOVED it. My Italian husband who is always the true test couldn't say enough about how great it was. It was better than normal ziti without the cost of all the ingredients. This is a real keeper! It's fast, cheap, easy and DELISOUS!

This was a very nice change instead of making regular spaghetti.  Although, next time I will make my own spaghetti sauce because I just can't seem to find a ready made that I like.  This does not out rate lasagna, but is less time consuming.

I halved this recipe with great results.  I didn't cover the dish, but i did ensure that the top layer of noodles were completely smothered in sauce so the noodles wouldn't dry out.  Because we do not eat pork products and i substituted the sausage with cracker barrel beef sausage, the kind you see at the holidays with cheese and crackers.  I sliced off 1/4 pound and ground it in the food processor then fried per recipe instructions. No leftovers, delicious.

Really good and I'm not really a fan of baked pasta dishes. I liked that the sauce and the pasta were seperated by the first cheese/sour cream layer. That made it a winner. Hubby liked it too and my two year old ate alot! A new addition to our menu. However, I definitely with half the recipe next time. That would make enought to eat and freeze some.

This dish is WONDERFUL. The type of spaghetti sauce you use makes a big difference. And when it was baking in the oven, the smell floated around the house.... =) This is a definite KEEPER.

I made this EXACTLY as directed, and was not disappointed.  It was great.  I expected a lot of leftovers, even though I only made a half recipe for my hubby and myself.  We ate almost the whole thing.  It was awesome.

After watching the Soprano's and hearing about ziti, i was curious as to what it was.  It is scrummy!!!!  Even my extremely fussy daughter ate her serving.  Definately a keeper - very substantial and comforting on a cold night.

This was awesome.  But I didn't apparently have a big enough casserole dish, it halved pretty well.  And I think the neighbors enjoyed their half as much as we did.  I did however add mushrooms and black olives to the sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  Was afraid about the sour cream and used less than it was called for.  Next time, I will use more because it was delicious!  I also added some cooked spinach to the middle not only for some flavor, but coloring too!  Will definitely make again.

This was excellent. My 8 yr old daughter and I made it together and we didn't follow the directions very well.  I mixed the pasta and sauce by accident. I put 1/2 on the bottom of the pan then layered the provolone and sour cream and put the rest of the pasta on top.  Mozzarella went on top of that.  It was still GREAT!!!  My picky 5 year old had 2 helpings.  I also used some turkey Italian sausage along with the ground beef for extra flavor.  It does make alot. I divided in half and froze half before I baked.

This is a great and simple recipe.  And it is a nice change from spaghetti.  It does make a lot of food though.

This was VERY GOOD and simple to make.  The only modification I made was that I prepared it with hot flavored Italian Sausage instead of ground beef.  This is definitely a keeper and me and my husband both gave it five stars.  Thank you Colleen for sharing this recipe.

This is awesome. My husband will only let me make THIS baked ziti after trying it. Ths sour cream makes it taste so fresh. I used sliced pepperjack cheese instead of the provalone, and turned out great!

Good recipe that I will play around with a little next time by adding more seasoning and some other ingredients like veggies (caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, spinach) or meat (ground beef or turkey, pepperoni, or sausage) and cut back a tad on the sauce.  The sour cream definitely added a different taste to the dish, but my husband loved it!

I just made this for my daughter's varsity soccer team.  It was a huge hit!  I scaled the recipe to serve 24 and the 16 girls ate it all. Not too cheesy at all.  I did cut back the sauce as other readers suggested and used a little bit less mozzarella & provolone because I didn't have enough.  Next time I'll use low-fat ingredients but will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I used a larger pan so it would all fit without overflowing. I used half Italian sausage & half ground beef.  I added Italian seasoning and minced garlic to the meat. I mixed the ziti in with the sauce before layering.  I reduced the sour cream to only about 1 cup.  I used 2 1/2 jars of sauce (Classico).   Everyone enjoyed it.  It also reheats well for leftovers the next day.

Excellent! My husband is a very picky eater and we both loved this. It is even better for leftovers. I added diced tomatos, mushrooms and a lot of fresh garlic. Thank you Colleen for this great recipe!

This makes A LOT.  We ate it for dinner last night and I fed about 12 teachers with it today at school.  It is very easy, little prep and "doctoring up" the jar spaghetti sauce with some fresh garlic and reduced red wine really made it tasty.  We will definately be making this one again.

We used to make something similar to this at Papa Gino's. (an italian fast food restaurant in our area)  It is such a great recipe.  I use fat free ricotta as well as light mozzarella so its a little healthier.  I also broil it for about five minutes after cooking time so that the cheese gets nice and crispy.  My husband asks for this every week!  Thanks

I didn't have provolone so I used Asago instead and instead of Ziti I used 'scooby doo' pasta (kind of a twisty macaroni).  I also assembled it wrong but it still turned out delicious.  My husband raved about it.  Next time I'll follow the directions better :)

I was so excited to find a recipe for baked ziti in the "Hall of Fame." I have always loved ziti but never tried making it myself. This was great! The sour cream helps to make the sauce very creamy. As many others have said, this makes a HUGE amount of food and it is a tight fit in a 9x13 pan. I was glad to see one review where someone used only 1 jar of sauce instead of 2 and it worked fine. I think I'll try that next time--both to help stop the bit of overflow in the oven and also because it was a tad bit too saucy for me. But, all in all, YUM!

My aunt used this recipe only as a basis for making baked ziti.  She used one jar of spaghetti sauce instead of two, and the result still turned out fine.  She had never made baked ziti before and said that it was easy to prepare.  We both ate well tonight and had a good meal!

I jazzed up the sauce like other readers recommended.  It still turned out to be "just another baked ziti".  It was good but I was a little disappointed because I was expecting something spectacular from all the reviews.

I used all low fat ingredients in this - down to the sausage.  Came out GREAT - still.  I'm sure when I make it for company, I'll bust out the fattening stuff - but for us, it was perfect.

This was excellent!  I made it using ground turkey and light sour cream.  The next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I am going to try squeeze sour cream.  Enjoy!

I REALLY liked this recipe. It was different then the usually spaghetti.  I usually don't use Provolone, but this was really good with all the other ingredients.  My picky kids ate it too!  Thank you.

I took this to my in-laws and they all loved it.  My brother-in-law who is a picky eater really enjoyed this too.  being Italian, this met my expectations.  this was a quick and easy recipe to take over to someone's house.  I didn't have much of the provolone cheese so I used more mozza cheese and a bit of swiss cheese.

Well, I don’t really have anything to add that the wonderful people before me haven’t said. This recipe is just the BEST! I’m making it without meat next time, because as a reformed Vegetarian, the ground beef made me sick. My fiancé ate the entire dish (I didn’t have to cook for days!). It was great!

i used fat free sour cream (that's all i had) and bow tie pasta.  i also used tomato basil sauce.  i found the recipe to be bland.  i would prefer making lasagna with these ingredients (try american lasagna).

Wonderful recipe, and super easy!  I didn't use meat, and I can't imagine that it could be any better.  I used Classico Mushrooms and Ripe Olives, and Four Cheese sauces because they were on sale.  I wasn't sure whether to use "flavored" pasta sauce, but it was great.  I will make this many times.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Yummy! This was easy and tasty. I've never made lasagna (or baked ziti) because my husband is so picky. Now when I have a craving for it I can make this simple dish because it tastes just as good. All I did was leave some sauce out for him to have spaghetti! So good and definitely a keeper.
