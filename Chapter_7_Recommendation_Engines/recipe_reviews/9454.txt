I have made Baklava for about 30 years now, ever since my greek stepmother made it during my teenage years.  At first it took me about an hour to assemble, but now only about 15 minutes.  Here are the shortcuts to save time.  I do let the phyllo dough thaw, but do not cut the dough and do not cover it while layering. I just drape the bottom half over the pan and then fold the top half over it, "painting" a thin layer of butter quickly.  I use a new and clean basting paint brush, to spread a very thin layer of butter between each phyllo sheet. It is only necessary to lightly brush on the butter, not saturate.  The more wrinkles the sheet has in it, the better.  You just keep putting and folding the edges and that ends up making the baklava more layered and crispy.  If it turns out soggy, it's from too much butter, not the sauce.  Also, when you cut the Baklava before you bake it, use a sharp knife and cut to within a half inch FROM the bottom of the pan, so then when you pour the sauce into the cooled Baklava, the sauce seeps into every layer of the Baklava, but doesn't sit at the bottom. Then, cut all the way thru after the whole thing has completely cooled.

I have been using this recipe from allrecipes.com for years, and I just realized I never reviewed it.  I have made it dozens of times, and without fail it always impresses.  You should follow these tips that are suggested by other reviewers: 1) Lightly roast nuts prior to chopping (I always use walnuts). 2) Make 1 1/2 times sauce recipe calls far. 3) Make sauce AHEAD of recipe, and put in the fridge to cool. By pouring the  cool syrup on the warm baklava it will turn out crispy. 4) Cook at 325F until browned on top (I have found 350F a little too high) This recipe, along with the Classic Tiramisu also on this site, are my top 2 desserts to make. For any function, family get together or holiday, I always get requests for these 2 desserts.

I have another tip to use for this recipe.  I really wanted to use real butter, and I had so much trouble using a pastry brush to brush the butter on because it kept crunching up the dough as I painted, so I bought I can't believe it's not butter spray and dumped the contents in a cup, then I melted my "real butter" and put it into the spray bottle and sprayed the dough.  This saved time and your dough won't crunch up.  Then after I was done I just poured the other stuff back into the bottle.

This is the second time I have tried this recipe and it just keeps getting easier.  A few tricks I learned this time:  Make the sauce first, before you start to do anything else with the baklava.  Let it cook while you are preparing and putting everything together, and let it cool while the baklava is cooking.   I got the sauce started, and then chopped and prepared the nuts (I used a variety of nuts; almonds, walnuts and pecans), and rolled out my dough.  I lay out my phyllo dough before I start layering and cut it to the shape of the pan I am making it in.  This made the layering SO much easier.  I put a piece of plastic wrap over the phyllo dough and then the damp towel.  This helps keep the dough from sticking to the towel.  I made an extra 1/2 of the sauce recipe and it seems like the perfect amount (I doubled it last time and it seemed like too much). I also used about 2 sticks of butter instead of 1.  It took me about an hour total to prepare and assemble.  CUT the baklava after assembly and before cooking, and top with butter to make everything smooth and “pretty”.   Put the cooled sauce on as soon as you pull the baklava out of the oven.  I let it adsorb overnight.  Easy and wonderful!!  It tastes like the baklava I buy in the Greek stores downtown and a LOT cheaper per piece.  I think this cost me around $15 to make and I yeilded 3 dozen pieces(it would be less if I did not use almonds and pecans).  I will be making this for years to come!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a huge hit. In fact it just won best of show at the county fair in the culinary division! A few modifications I have made...
I use toasted pecans for the nuts. I mix 1/4 cup sugar in with the cinnamon and nuts. I make the syrup first and allow it to cool while I put together the baklava and bake it, then I can pour cooled syrup onto hot baklava (this helps keep it from becoming soggy). I also use only 1/2 cup of water and a full cup on honey in the syrup. I usually need more butter than called for also. 
 I am so thankful to Donna for posting this recipe. She has made a lot of us look like pro's. And thanks to everyone else who has written reviews with their tips here and there. You know a recipe is great when over 175 people take the time to write a review on it!

A good recipe, but here are a couple of hints:  Melt the butter and use a pastry brush.  Cut the pastry BEFORE you bake it .  Pistachios, walnuts and pecans are the best nuts for baklava.  DO NOT cover after complete, and remove from baking pan so the bottom doesn't soggy.

This is an excellent recipe, time consuming but not difficult.  I went with several reviews that said they only used half the package and then was in a mad dash to thaw the second half when the first was clearly not enough.  I think some packages of fillo come in 2 8oz packages and thus do not require cutting in half, but the recipe is right when in says it uses 16 oz. The syrup was sufficient as well but here is a hint from a Greek person for those who say it is too soggy: pour hot syrup over cool baklava or cool syrup over hot baklava to avoid it all seeping to the bottom and becoming soggy.  Also for convience I used a bad of finely chopped walnuts I found in the store, they were the perfect size and saved on chopping.  Everyone at our Easter table was impressed!

This is a great recipe for Baklava!  You have to make it.  I had phyllo dough that had been in the freezer for a while and was starting to dry out, so I decided to make this recipe.  Even though it was quite difficult to work with dried out dough, the end result was fabulous.  Flaky & crispy on top with yummy sweet layers in the middle.  I added a bit of sugar to the nut mixture (1/4 cup max) and the sugar caramelized nicely in the oven.  I also added a touch of nutmeg and ground cardamom to the nut mixture (not too much, because it's really strong and you don't want it to overpower the cinnamon flavor).  I also added a bit of orange zest to the syrup along with the vanilla, and it was delicious.  It wasn't as sweet as store bought baklava and that made it so much better.  Before putting it in the oven, I cut the baklava with a pizza cutter and that really worked well.  I served it in multicolored cupcake wrappers.  Yummy, yummy.  One thing I noticed was that it was a bit dry for my taste.  Next time, I think I'll increase the sugar/honey syrup by 1/3 to 1/2 than the recipe calls for.  I had originally made this recipe to share with my extended family, but now I'm thinking of making something else to take to that party and keeping the baklava at home for us.  Soooooo good!  Try it, you won't regret it!

Yes!!! I'm so excited about this recipe.  I made it for my sweetie for V-day because it's his favorite dessert.  My family was over when I was making it and, though they were doubting that I could pull it off, once they smelled it they couldn't wait to try it. We all took our first bites at the same time and my mom and brother said, "This tastes like REAL baklava!"  I followed the advice of others and as I was making the sauce I just added a little bit more of everything and it was the perfect amount.  More advice: I wanted mine to look really authentic so I sprinkled very finely ground nuts on top.  I wouldn't recommend doing this before you bake it.  They burned- it did not affect the flavor but just didn't look as pretty as I wanted. Also, be sure to put a layer of Saran wrap between your damp cloth and the Phyllo you're not using.  The cloth will stick and ruin it.  One more thing.  I dont know about anyone else but once I added the honey to my sauce mixture it nearly exploded, I looked away for a second and looked back and it was overflowing like crazy.  It ruined the burner pan.  Just be sure to turn the heat way down before adding the honey.  I would also recommend cutting/grounding your nuts very finely, I did one layer a little too thick and it caused it to fall apart.  No big deal though, still delicious!  My sweetie and I watched a movie after dinner and he planted the tray right next to him and proceeded to eat it all!  It's only been a week and he's already askin

This recipe is very good, almost similar and true to real Greek baklava. However, the syrup is not right. It is supposed to be thick in consistency, this syrup was too watery and was not thick enough. 

Something that should be added to the syrup is orange or lemon peel. It's traditional in baklava syrups and it gives a sweet scent and taste.

make sauce 1st & fridge until baklava pulled from over. (i increased sauce by 1/4, not 1/2.) mix 1.5 cups nuts, 1/3 cup sugar & 1 tsp cinnamon in small bowl & set aside. completely melt 1 cup butter & set aside in small bowl w/ basting brush. don't butter 9x13 pan, nonstick cooking spray sides/bottom - it's easier. if your 16 oz box of phyllo dough comes in 2 8 oz sealed packages, no need to cut it - fits perfectly. no need to cover dough w/ anything while working if you set up everything in advance - it won't have time to dry out. set aside 6 - 8 sheets dough for topping & start making layers as follows: 2 sheets dough, LIGHTLY brushed w/ melted butter (just enough to wet it or it will be soggy), 1-2 tbsp nut mixture sprinkled across it (yes after every 2 sheets, not just after every 8 sets of 2 sheets - hence the extra nuts/sugar). butter and nut mixture may not look like enough per layer but it is. then repeat: dough, butter, nut mixture until only 6-8 top sheets remain. top it with them. only cut 1/2 down into baklava before baking (so when sauce is added it won't run to & pool at the bottom but will soak more evenly into finished product). bake @ 325 degrees F just until top is golden/crisp. remove baklava from oven & sauce from fridge. pour cold sauce over hot baklava & let sit for 10 minutes (to let sauce soak into layers). finish cutting through & serve! cashews work great! husband's boss said he loves expensive restaurant baklava & this was better than he's ever had!

delicious! I never worked with phyllo dough before and it was NOT hard.  It's ok to rip some sheets and have holes in some places so don't get frustrated if you have a hard time with it because you can't tell at all once it's baked.  I brushed a very light coat of butter between every sheet as some reviewers suggested, that might've been why it turned out so good.   I also used the suggestions from previous reviewers...1. use double or triple the cinnamon 2. double the honey mixture 3. chop the nuts pretty fine and add some brown sugar to them.  I took this to my in-laws and my parents for a holiday and no one could believe how excellent it turned out compared to failed attempts they had over the years...seems like poor recipes is how baklava got its reputation for being so difficult to make, because this took time and patience, but was NOT hard. There was none of this left and everyone has the recipe now!  The directions are a little confusing for the layers so i'll try to explain how i did it...there are 3 sections to baklava.  1. phyllo sheet, light brush of butter, phyllo sheet...(repeat till you have 10 sheets down with butter in between every layer)  2. 2-3 Tbs. nut mixture, phyllo sheet, light brush of butter, phyllo sheet, 2-3 Tbs. nut mixture...(repeat till you run out of nut mixture.  3. This section is the same as the step 1. (I used all of my remaining sheets of phyllo dough and it was just right).  Don't forget to cut it prior to baking or the honey mixture will

The difference between Turkish Baklava and Greek Baklava is simply that Turks don't use honey - it's simply lighter (in taste and calorie content).  A few more hints:  sprinkle or spray the butter onto the sheets - you don't want them flattened out - a little air between them adds texture.  After putting the mix together, place in freezer for 15 minutes, then slice before baking.  A brief freeze hardens the butter and it's really simple to get good cuts!

I am originally Egyptian, and I made baklava for many years. As i tried many times  to perfect Baklava making ; I have some suggestions,  to make a good sugar syrup  squeeze 1/2 a lemon into the water-sugar before boiling, make the sugar syrup the night before and let it cool. Add half of the syrup to the baklava first, then wait and test it,  add more if needed. Also, before baking drizzle some honey from the bottle directly to the nuts between the layes in the middle part of the Baklava. In this case cut the baklava half way , as one reader suggests, so the honey does not escape to the bottom and burn.  Add 1/4 tea spoon of ground cloves to the nut mixture, it gives the real greek flavor. These changes help me to make a goog tasty baklava

I can't stop eating this (not good for the diet- LOL). No problems with the phyllo dough. I got the twin pack from Walmart & used the plastic sheet they were rolled in to use as a buffer between the dough & the damp towel. Used a small chopper for the pecans halves, then transfered them to a skillet to roast. Then, I added cinnamon & 1/4 cup sugar to the pecans. Those who are confused on how to do the dough & nut steps- NOTE: do 2 sheets & butter 4 times (so there are 8 sheets total) & then do butter & sprinkle 2-3 TBSP. of pecans after laying of each 2 sheets. Do this until you have 8 sheets left & go back to just butter & dough. Cut butter (salted) to half & used that with butter spray. PERFECT. I baked it at 325 for about 40 mins. until top was golden.  Those having problems with the top layer sliding off- TIP: while cutting into sqaures/diamnonds, use your fingers to press down (not to hard but still quite firmly) on the top layer as you cut along. I had no top layer falling off with me. I had made 1 1/2 of the syrup recipe & found it a bit much. I'll make the exact amount next time. I also made the syrup ahead of time & had it in the fridge even before I got started on chopping the nuts.  Overall, this was so easy to make, best baklava I have ever had, & was fun to do (took me 45 mins. to do the layering, 10 for the syrup & 40 mins to cook). EXCELLENT RECIPE & thank you for posting this Donna. To the ladies who gave such helpful suggestions: YOU ROCK!

This recipe is awesome - and a tip for those who haven't worked with phylloh - don't try to brush butter on the dough in the baking dish.  Lay it on your countertop instead and quickly and lightly brush vertically and horizontally -don't try to get ever single area - very thin amount is good.
toast your nuts for 8-10 min at 350 to bring out nutty flavor and make sure to make sauce before and refrigerate.  You want to pour cool sauce on hot baklava.

Absolutely amazing. I would rate this a 10, if I could. I am Persian, and though baklava is originally a Greek dessert, after the Greek empire expanded and took over Persia, this treat was also incorporated into Persian cuisine. My grandmother, mother, and brother were SO impressed with the outcome. I made the sauce first, and allowed it to cool as I prepared the baklava. I created the recommended 8 layers of phyllo dough at the bottom, but next time I will create a few more layers. I couldn't find our basting brush, so I applied the melted butter with my hands; however, I took care to LIGHTLY apply the butter. Don't fuss if the phyllo dough wrinkles a bit, it will only add more texture to the end result. I cut the baklava before baking; however, I did NOT cut all the way to the bottom. I also made 1.5 the amount of sauce - I may make double the sauce next time. I highly recommend allowing the sauce to penetrate the baklava overnight. All in all this recipe turned out to be AMAZING. It was better than my aunt's baklava, who has been making baklava for over twenty years.

These are great...some things to note...Don't eat them while they are hot, be patient and wait until the next day to eat them.  They are so much better.  To cut them without hurting your baking pan, try using a plastic pizza cutter.  Cut them first, then butter the top layer (to keep the top from sliding off). Cut the dough slightly smaller than the pan (this way it won't pile up and get dry around the edges). I made half a recipe in a 8 by 8 pan and it worked out great. I got 18 pieces out of a half recipe. Don't be afraid to try it, it is actually pretty quick to put together.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it lacks some important info but as a base it is a yummy baklava recipe. You need to melt the butter and brush on with pastry brush or you even use a BBQ sauce brush. Set the butter on the warmer to keep it from hardening while you work. Also, do not put a wet towel directly onto phyllo dough! This will dampen your dough and make it gummy and gross. Always put wax paper between dough and damp cloth. I used almost 2 tsp of cinnamon but that its personal preferance. Use 3/4 cup of water instead of 1, and  1/3 cup of honey instead of 1/2 for a less soggy baklava.~~~ Also, another reviewer recommended freezing the baklava for 15 minutes, then cutting into triangles  before baking. I used this method and got great results.

OK, it's been sitting on the counter all night and I just had to taste!  Boy, this is really good!  It's not super sticky sweet like most Baklava that I've had and I love that.  I cooked the sauce first with lemon zest and let it cool.  I used parchment lining in the pan.  I really chopped the walnuts in the food processor (did not change the nuts, walnuts are authentic Greek).  I added ¼t cloves, ¼t allspice, ¼t ginger and ¼t nutmeg to the nut mixture.  I also shredded the leftover phyllo and sprinkled that on top before baking.  Thanks to many helpful reviews, this will be a big hit at my mother-in-law's (or Yia-Yia's) birthday party!  Oh, BTW, 1lb of walnuts finely chopped equals almost 2c.

This recipe is incredible!  I made it the first time a month ago, and again last weekend.  The 2 pans I made were devoured by family and friends in 24 hours!!  Note:  The 2nd time, I used my food processor to chop the nuts, and it came out perfect...some were a bit bigger, and some were really finely chopped.  Made it wonderful!  I also added an additional 1/2 cup honey to the syrup for a great flavor, and I made it in advance (before I started the phyllo dough) and let it cool outside (40 degrees).  The syrup was just thick enough that when I poured it on the baked phyllo, it really coated all the layers instead of settling all at the bottom.  Then I stuck the pans outside for about 45 min, and it was great!  I really liked having every layer full of that honey-syrup flavor.

Used walnuts and orange zest and it was fantastic! Definitely store uncovered - that way it won't get soggy

I have been making baklava for about 25 years.  My mom handed over our traditional Armenian baklava when I was around 8 years old.  The key that I have discovered over the years is not to cover the dough itself with a damp cloth because it can make the dough soggy.  Place a wet dish towel underneath a layer of wax paper.  Then place the phyllo on top.  I make the baklava right on top of the stove next to the sink.  I then melt the butter in a saucepan while making the nut mixture. After the butter has melted I turn down the burner to the lowest setting. This way the butter stays melted and doesn't start to become hard.   The key to the crispness of the pastry dough and having it saturate the baklava is this:  Place the finished and uncooked baklava in the freezer for ten minutes while preheating the oven.  Take out of the freezer and cut into the diamond shapes with a very sharp knife while it is frozen.  It makes it much easier because the buttered dough won't stick as much to your fingers because it returns to it's mostly hardened state.  I usually don't put the glaze on the baklava until right before I am going to serve it.  It can even sit a day covered without any sauce.  I think the reason this baklava can get soggy is because of the honey. I dont' use honey at all in mine, and use a lot less water as well.  1 cup of sugar to 3/4 cup of water and 1tbsp of lemon juice.  Pour the hot sauce on the baklava making sure to pour it  in the crevices, I never have excess sauce.

i've been cooking for years, and this is one of the easiest recipes for baklava ive come across. couple of pointers for this one.... when you make your cuts, dont go all the way to the bottem. this allows your syrup to absorb more evenly also, try to find phillo brand phylo dough, its all ready pre cut to the proper size for making this 13x9 recipe. if you can find it, it will shorten your prep time by quite a bit

When attending a dinner party with my boyfriend's parents, they were bragging to their friends that I was a great baker. "She makes great desserts," they said -- "cakes, cookies ... baklava ..." I was horrified, as I'd never made it before (which they knew, and they winked at me conspiratorially), so when I learned they were bringing those same friends over to my boyfriend's home, I knew I'd need help. I found this recipe and WOW! Donna, you helped save my kitchen reputation. This is a great dessert. Thank you! A few tips ... 1) Definitely simmer that syrup the whole 20 minutes, or even longer. I made the baklava again last night (at my boyfriend's request, so his work friends could taste it) and it turned out soggier than usual, but the simmering had been cut short. 2) Try it with a pinch of cloves added to the nut mixture -- adds some more depth to the aroma. 3) Spritzing your knife with Pam before you slice through the layers helps keep the dough from sticking, if you're having trouble. 4) Definitely store uncovered, to avoid sogginess. 5) No need to chop nuts if you have a heavy freezer bag and a meat mallet nearby. Use the smooth side of the mallet and bang away -- you get the same results with a fraction of the work.  -- Enjoy! And thanks again, Donna!

Really great!  I used toasted walnuts and added ¼ teaspoon cloves to the nut mixture.  The lemon zest was added to the sauce before cooking, and the vanilla was added afterwards, so that it wouldn't evaporate.  The end result was baklava that tastes MUCH better than the packaged ones sold in the stores.  Several tips:  Don't apply the butter too heavily, or you will run out before you get to the top sheets.  Make sure you simmer, not boil, the sauce, or you won't have enough of that to adequately saturate the baked layers of phyllo.  Use a measuring spoon to distribute the chopped nuts over the layers, so you have just the right amount.  Pre-toasting the nuts really improves the flavor.  Lastly, it is extremely important to keep the layers of phyllo covered with a damp (not wet) cloth, so it is still pliable enough to work with.  I had absolutely none of the problems expressed by some of the other reviewers. I had just the right amount of nuts, and the syrup was not too sweet.  In fact, it was less sweet than the store-bought.  I was so glad the recipe mentioned that these should not be stored covered, as it will cause them to become sticky.  I just loosely covered with a sheet of wax paper, and they didn't weep.  Thank you for mentioning that, and for sharing this terrific recipe.

This recipe is amazing.  I like my baklava dry and a little cinnamony, so I put three times as much cinnamon and only used half the syrup.  Also, you can use butter-flavored cooking spray (like Pam) rather than painting each sheet with butter.  I've made it both ways and can't tell a difference -- honestly!  It saves a lot of time, calories, and fat the easier way, and no one will know the difference.

Very good! I had a little trouble with the phyllo dough but in the end it turned out amazing! And just for those of you out there wondering...the dough doesn't have to be perfect! Mine was all kinds of crazy and it still came out beautiful!

This recipe was a little confusing to me, maybe because it was my first attempt at trying to make baklava. In the end, it turned out absolutely delicious. Thank you for the recipe. The phyllo dough that I bought fit the pan perfectly, so I didn't have to fold it in half. Here is how i ended up doing the layering: ***Bottom Layer (Repeat 4 times): 2 sheets phyllo dough- 1 layer of butter.                      ***Middle Layer (repeat until there are only 8 sheets of dough left in the package): 2 sheets phyllo dough- 1 layer of butter- 3 tbsp chopped pecan nuts. ***Top Layer (repeat until you finish up the sheets): 2 sheets phyllo dough 1 layer of butter.            Hope this helps someone!    EDIT: I have now made this many times and it is always a hit!!!

Absolutely the best baklava recipe I've ever used! I woudln't change a thing. Hint for first timers--when you do the top layer of 6-8 sheets of phyllo dough, put a layer of butter between every two. I didn't, and so the top layer was completely unconnected to the rest of the baklava.

I am so impressed with myself!  Having never considered phyllo dough even close to my league, I decided to try this baklava based on all the rave reviews.  I felt like the little engine who could--I think I can, I think I can.  For those who wondered how other reviewers define "time consuming," I will answer that question!  The assembly of the baklava took me 40 minutes (I'm an admitted novice and I'm sure next time I'll be a little quicker).  That doesn't count the prep work before assembly--chopping, toasting nuts, melting butter, cooking sauce to let cool, etc.  I didn't have problems with my phyllo tearing, but I let it sit at room temperature for two hours before use, like it said on the package.  I used the back of a large spoon to spread the butter.  I found I was being too generous with the butter and nut mixture in the early layers and had to be quite stingy at the end.  Next time, will be more sparing with the nuts.  I also had trouble with the sauce sinking right to the bottom.  Perhaps it needed to simmer longer to thicken?  But the taste isn't affected one bit.  I'll be making this again; it's a wonderful, gourmet treat that I did all by myself!  Thanks for a great recipe and thanks to all the reviewers who gave me the courage to try!

This was really good but the recipe is written in a slightly confusing way to someone who has never made baklava before. Maybe define between sheets and layering more? My dough came separated into two rolls already and each were the perfect size for my pan so I didn't have to cut it. I realized early on that the 2-3 tbsp of nuts per layer wasn't very much and gave me a very sparse layer of nuts so I used about 5 tbsp of nuts per layer which I liked much better. After I was done I stuck the whole pan in the freezer for a couple hours to flash freeze and then I wrapped each piece in plastic wrap and stuck them all in a freezer bag so I can have a single piece whenever I want one but without tempting myself to all of them at the same time- I have no will power against baklava haha.

For anyone who felt the same about the directions being confusing, seeing this would have made it more helpful:
Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 4 layers of 'dough, dough, butter'. Sprinkle 2 - 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, then a layer of butter and nuts. Continue to layer two sheets of dough, butter and nuts until you have 6-8 sheets of dough left. Layer the remaining dough on top, 2 sheets at a time, buttering between so that the top is comprised of 6-8 butter brushed sheets etc.

This was a pretty good recipe--not too sweet and pretty easy. I gave the recipe 4 stars because I didn't think the directions were as specific as they could be. For example, I did not know that I needed to thaw my phyllo dough before trying to unroll it. Also, I melted my butter which I assume you should do even though the directions don't call for that. I'm not totally inept in the kitchen, but I do appreciate very specific directions when I am trying something new!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used walnuts, but plan to use pistachios next time.  Also, I think I made it alittle thin, so I'll do at least 8 or 9 layers next time, and I shredded some phyllo for the top.  Finally, the recipe makes ALOT of syrup, I'd probably cut this in half next time.

Love the recipe as is but if you add orange peel strips to the syrup while it's boiling it adds an extra spin that is SOOO good. I also leave mine sit for at least one day before serving. It's hard but worth the wait!

I will for sure be making this again and again.  This is the very first time I've ever handled phyllo dough, and I think I did pretty well!  Next time I'll try to cut the layers much more evenly and will butter the sides more thoroughly; the edges were a bit dry.  The middle pieces of baklava were amazing!  I combined tips from multiple reviews.  I didn't use the entire cup of butter.  I used 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp but next time will use slightly more.  I tossed the chopped nuts (1/2 almonds, 1/2 pecans, that's all I had on hand) with 1/4 cup sugar plus the cinnamon.  I did make the sauce a few hours before I needed it so it was nice and cold when I poured it on, and I did 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe which was the perfect amount!  I also didn't slice all the way through when cutting the baklava before baking.  When I poured the sauce on IMMEDIATELY after taking out of the oven, I let it sit overnight covered slightly (just to keep the cats away from it), then sliced all the way through in the morning.  I then placed each piece on little squares of wax paper, but that's not necessary; if people don't mind getting messy they can pick up the pieces themselves. I took this to work and everyone loved it!  I need to make this again soon.  I'm already craving it again!  Last thing: Try 325 instead of 350.  I baked for 40 minutes at 350 and the tops were burnt.  I had to pull the top layers off!

GREAT recipe! I used walnuts and I did use 1 1/2 times the sauce, however next time I make it I will definitely reduce the white sugar. It was much too sweet for my taste. I also, as did another reviewer, find that 350 degrees was a little too hot. I cut the baking time a little short because it was starting to get a little too dark. Next time I will bake it a 325 instead of 350. I thought this would be very time comsuming, but it was really quite easy to essemble and didn't take long at all. Thanks for the recipe!

I am having a little trouble with the fact that people want to use a spray bottle for the butter.  It doesn't take much more time to use a kitchen brush and get the proper amount of butter on the baklava.  The butter, by the way, should be clarified.  In your sauce you should have lemon peel and orange peel, not zest, and discard it before pouring on the cooked baklava.

This recipe is amazing. I consider myself a confident cook and baker but always avoided making baklava because I thought it ranked up there with crossaints - just cheaper and easier to purchase already made. But this recipe couldn't be simpler. 

The one thing I would say is don't worry if the Phyllo tears - that worried me as I was making it - but you can't tell in the end as the syrup holds everything together. 

This is truly one amazing recipe!

Great recipe! For the reviewer who questions the origins of baklava, please refer to your history facts before making your statements.  Baklava is a favourite in many countries and there is little documentation on the actual origin. Here's a quick summary - Assyria is believed to be first country for the prototype - 8th century B.C. Greece tweaked it 3rd century B.C. Greeks settled in Turkish empire (Hittites) 1200 BC. It became popular in Turkey in 1600s, Armenia and other countries. Didn't want to make this a political referece because the recipe is very good, but thought that the historical reference needed to be addressed.

A review from a Baklava Newb: Very Yummy! I just did a mixture of what other reviewers said and it was great.   However the first time I went to make it I got a little confused on the layers and it took me a little while to figure it out. So for anyone else who might be a little confused: * Bottom layer: 8 sheets * Middle layer: 6-8 sheets w/ nuts in between * Top layer: 8 sheets  Also do NOT cover! I covered some (just for a little while) to bring into work  and all the ones I covered were soggy and just not nearly as good.

So SWEET but so GOOD!   The tips from other reviewers helped a lot!  Make the sauce first, use a damp towel, butter every two layers, and make a half more of the sauce.  Time consuming but not difficult.  Got a lot of raves for this one!

The baklava tasted excellent! It is a bit time consuming because you have to layer the phylo dough and then bake it for nearly an hour but it was much easier than I expected. Some advice: make sure to cut the baklava all the way through using a very sharp knife BEFORE you bake it.  Also, try using butter in a spray bottle or melt it before hand.

This was fabulous. I made it for 60 people and everyone raved about it. Before I served it, I had decided that I wouldn't make it again because it was very time consuming (again making for a large crowd), however, my husband strongly requested my adding it to my regular repertoire. I tried emptying a butter spray can and using that to spray the butter (not a great idea). Next time I'll try using a regular spray can (like what you can get at the beauty store) for the butter. That might make it a much quicker process. Definitely freeze if you have leftovers. You can eat right from the freezer. If you leave it in the fridge for too long the sugar becomes a little grainy, that is why the freezer is better. I did double the syrup as others suggested. I also added more cinnamon that required. For nuts, I used a combination of pecans and walnuts and I toasted them for a richer flavor.

I am a professional baker and I have my own shop in North Carolina.  I have never baked baklava before because never really been a big fan mainly because the versions I have eaten were always overly sweet. I followed this recipe almost to the letter taking a few tips from others and it turned out great.  I did add a little granulated sugar to the cinnamon nut mixture and I infused a little orange from an orange peel to the syrup.  I did pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava.  I also took the advice of not cutting all the way through the baklava before baking.  This end product came out great.  My employees loved it and the customers as well.  I am a professional however, this recipe is very simple.  I also did not cover the FILO dough.  If you are not intimidated by it's fragile texture you will be fine not to cover.  Very good recipe.

I have made it twice and it was a huge hit. I took a lot of suggestions from the other reviewers, made 1.5 times the sauce, cut the baklava 1/2 inch from the bottom and poured cold sauce on warm baklava. I also made the sauce ahead of time and refrigerated it. I used a light coat of butter for each layer of dough. This was so good! UPDATE: Made this a few more times and I barely used 1/4c butter. I toast the nuts in the microwave. I make the sauce and nuts 1 day ahead of time when I have people over, less work on the day itself!

This was my first attempt at baklava and it was a great success! I did follow the advice to make a bigger batch of syrup and to chill the syrup before pouring it over the hot pastry, and it turned out very well.

I have found that using my bench scraper works the best for cutting the pastry before baking.  You can just sink the scraper into the product and remove and reposition and repeat.  You don't have to worry about your knife dragging the dough and thus disturbing the layering.  I also use about 1.5 to 2 sticks of butter as well as adding a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg to the nut mixture.  I too make another half batch of sauce with the original amount adding lemon and orange zests.

This recipe is magnificent! I've made it a couple of times, and everyone just raves over it. It is much better and doesn't get as soggy if you let the sauce cool before pouring it over the baked pastry. I make it first so it is all the way cooled. Also, it works great to cut it a little smaller and put it in cupcake papers for easy serving.

This recipe is amazing.  I've got two hints, though.  Try buttering with your hands, it makes it much easier to spread.  Also, try buttering the sheet while it is stil on the top of the stack and then transfer it to the pan.  This is much easier for the layers that go over the nuts and I find that it keeps the other sheets from drying out because they are covered longer.  All in all, a real treat  (p.s. it is nearly impossible to cut the baklava without the top sheet going all over the place, so don't fret, you're just normal)  Thaks a lot for the recipe!

I never made Baklava before using this recipe.  I have made it three times (baby shower, wedding shower and birthday), and I always get complimented.  Everyone says it is the best Baklava they have ever had (one woman who said that is from New York and said she's tried Baklava from all the ethnic bakeries!)  This is a fabulously easy recipe.  The hardest thing about making it is cutting it before baking.  It is rather time consuming, however.  It takes me about two hours all together, since you have to make the sauce while it's baking.  But if you want to make an impression, this will do it.  Thank you, Donna.  This recipe is sublime!

Everyone who tried this said it was the best baklava they ever tasted. For easy prep, I recommend putting melted butter into a spray bottle and just spritzing on the sheets of filo as you go.  It makes the prep much faster and simpler. I also recommend cooking this in stone cookware if you have it. It will make the bottom flaky and cirspy without burning it. Pre-cutting about 3/4 of the way through will also make serving this easier (and prettier). I used a combination of all the nuts I had on hand. Can't wait to make this again!

I've made this recipe a couple of times (and I'm eagerly awaiting my latest batch to come out of the oven in a few minutes) and it always turns out great. I always add some sugar in with the cinnamon and nuts as some other reviewers have suggested. It takes forever to layer the phyllo, but it's definitely worth it. So delicious.

We visited a charming Greek community in Tarpon Springs, Florida and enjoyed their authentic Baklava.  This recipe is extremely close to theirs. If my memory does not fail me.... it is almost identical.  My 16 year old daughter and I made this for our German family and everyone had a fit over it.  I used 1/2 pistachios and 1/2 walnuts because we favor pistachios but I believe the lovely Greek use walnuts.   I made extra sauce ( 1 cup of honey) and cooled it before I poured it on the Baklava.  Make sure to cut the squares in diagonal before baking. I also kept this dessert uncovered for 2 days.  It never became soggy or mushy.  The layers remained crisp just like they should be.  I made it on Friday and it was gone by Sunday night.  Thank you for an amazing recipe=D  Will definitely make again!!

Cooling the syrup prior to pouring it on definitely made the pastry layers a lot crisper.  A great idea in a previous review.

My father is greek and said that this was the real deal!  When you are cutting the the pans do not cut through the bottom layers of philo.  This keeps the syrup mixture from going straight to the bottom and making it too soggy.  Just cut all the way through as you serve it.  This will also keep it from getting soggy if left in the pan but it normally doesn't last too long as leftovers!

I couldn't make it through all the tips, but I thought it was important to point out another pointer. Be sure when you make the sauce you make it slowly! If it gets too hot and bubbly, it just becomes harder when the whole thing cools, and hard baklava is just not cool! The same thing when making rice crispy treats, if you don't do the marshmellows slow they still melt and look the same, but when you go to cut them they are rock hard!

EXCELLANT EXCELLANT! First time using Fillo Dough also. Perfect results! Crispy throughout and way better than storebought! One note though, I found it needed an additional 1/2 stick (or 1/4 cup) butter because I ran out several layers shy of the top. Probably lost some due to absorption by my pastry brush. Also, I realized way too late that I was out of vanilla so I used about 1/4 tsp orange extract instead - wonderful! Otherwise I followed the recipe. Oddly, I found the Fillo dough difficult to work with until I took the moist towel off. The moist towel seemed to make the top sheet gummy and cause it to glue itself to the next sheet down. When I took the towel off they dried a bit and separated beautifully. It was easier for me to work with it dry. I'm taking this to a (lucky) Dr's office in the morning as I've been promising them a treat. The rest I intend to keep but at the rate my 15yr old son is gobbling, it'll be gone by morning! Will definately make again and again, especially for special times!

WOW 10 stars if I could! Just  finished baking, poured the cooled sauce on it popped it in the fridge for 10 mins and couldn't resist! soooo good. One of the best recipes hands down, I can't believe it's not in the top 20 on here.  Next time I will chop the nuts a bit smaller, add a bit more sauce. Baked at 325. I bake ALOT and this will forever become one of my favourite recipes!

My 12yr old made this last night, it was very easy. he did wind up with a bit of leftover butter(we had read the reviews so I had him melt the butter and brush it on) We also added about 1/2tsp more cinnamon. I should've followed the suggestion and had him make 1 1/2 sauce. He used 1/2 walnuts, 1/2 pistachioes. he's already talking about next time he makes it!

This recipe is awesome! The only changes I made were that I added half recipe to the sauce which some people recommended doing. So that's 1 1/2 times the honey sauce. I also made the sauce before I did anything else and put in the fridge until the baklava was done, made it super crispy and amazing! All around good recipe, the instructions are just a little confusing, you should butter every single layer with about 6-8 sheets on bottom and top with nut layers in between. Hope that helps!

This looks a lot harder than it really is!!! I brushed the dough every 2 sheets and used pecans and come walnuts which i had at home. For the syrup i only had a little put of honey so i added some light corn syrup. The syrup was really thin even after simmering for 15+ min. I put it in the fridge afterwards and ladeled it over the hot baklava. Even after refigerating it for a but it was still REALLY thin. Very good recipe will def make again. I used a super sharp long serated bread knife to cut the baklava before baking.

Am I the only one who melted the butter first before brushing it on the pastry?  I've never heard of a recipe using phyllo where you don't melt the butter.  
As one other reviewer stated, cut this in to bars before buttering the last layer; otherwise, it sticks to your hands & to the knife making it really messy!

I made these Christmas 2003, for my Turkish brother in law.  I was asking him what he missed about home and what kinds of foods they eat there and he told me that he loved Baklava.  I told him I might surprise him one day and make it for him, and he immediately told me it was "very difficult to make.  The pastries are so thin and it takes lots of practice to make it properly."  Af this point I had never even heard of Baklava, much less tasted it.  But thinking it would be the "thought that counts" I decided to try it anyhow.  My brother in law was SHOCKED!  He said it was just like his mother used to make...and he just couldn't believe that I could make the dough.  I never did tell him I used freezer Phyllo dough, lol.  (I had never heard of Phyllo dough at this point either!)  That being said, if I can make this without ever even have tasted it, anybody can!  

One other thing, personally I liked it better warm then cool.  It was sticky and gooey but oh-so-good with a cup of coffee:)

Great stuff!  My son and I made this for an international foods event at his school, and it got rave reviews.  One teacher commented that it was better than what she usually gets at a real Greek restaurant.  It was not hard to make at all, just a wee bit time consuming.  We did make a couple of changes.  We added a little cinnamon and sugar mixture between layers, as well as 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a little lemon zest to the sauce while cooking.  These were good suggestions given by other reviewers.  It also did not need to bake quite as long in my oven, so watch it carefully after about 40 minutes.

First off...I have to admit that we have never had Baklava before.  I have a friend who is Greek and raves about this, so I though I would try it.  It is just not for us.  Hubby said it was ok...but not something he would like me to continue making.  He said I make better desserts than this...and shouldn't do this one again.  Unfortunately I have to agree.  It just didn't suit our tastes.  Thanks anyway for the post.

I've made this so many times now, I don't even need to look at the recipe anymore!  I only use half a box of phyllo, half the amount of butter called for, more cinnamon and the same amounts of everything else.  Also, to make it quicker, I usually put three sheets of dough in the pan at a time, then butter and add nuts, etc.  It's just as good, taste wise.  Maybe not "authentic" but I have wowed many people with this recipe!

I've always been intimidated by phyllo but this couldn't be easier. The vanilla adds such a great taste! It was better than any baklava i've ever bought at a bakery. This recipe puts to rest anything you've heard about baklava being tricky to make. Loved it loved it!!!!

Thanks for taking the fear out of making Baklava.  This turned out great!  I only used 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter.  I also used a tangerine infused honey and mixed a dash of fresh nutmeg and 1/4 cup sugar to the nut mixture.  I used pecans finely ground.  Cook the sugar mixture first then let cool while you put together the baklava.  By the time it comes out of the oven, the syrup will be room temp. and you pour it on the hot baklava.  Let cool - uncovered and it will absorb the syrup.  I did NOT make extra syrup.  Came out great.  Thanks!

Scrumptious! I can only find 250g packs of Phyllo over here so I just made this in a loaf tin and it turned out beautifully.  The better the honey, the stronger the honey flavour in this - I'm going to try maple syrup next time.

I am giving this five stars because it is exactly what I was looking for. I have done some background checking on Baklava and it indeed is not Greek it is Middle Eastern, from what I read, it is used for Ramadan (Islamic) Quite a bit. 
 That being said, this is a great recipe. I did 1 and a 1/2 times the ingredients and found I still had plenty enough Phyllo dough for another half a pan. I really enjoyed making this. It was great fun. 
 It disappeared so quickly though that I am at it again; )

I love this recipe and everyone who has tasted it says it's great.  This makes a LOT of baklava.  I cut the recipe in half and it made a perfect toaster-oven sized pan.  I've also tried it with many different nuts and mixes of nuts, which are all delicious.  We like it warm, chilled, or room temperature.

I am getting ready to make this again! I made this a couple weeks ago, and EVERYONE loved it.  I have a brother who is a Baklava connoisseur as well as myself.  We both felt that it did need a little more syrup as other have suggested.  So this next time, I too will be making a 1/2 batch extra
syrup.  The other thing I didn't realize til after the fact... I chopped  my nuts up to like a regular chopping texture.  This time around, I am going to chopped them up a little finer.  Some of the Baklava servings had like, a little too big nuts in it and therefore they sorta fell out as you bit into the piece hence was a little messy.  This time around I am going to make sure I chop them up a little finer with adding a tad bit more syrup, and I think It will be perfect!

Other than those two adjustments, this recipe ROCKS!  Don't even bother buying cheap immitators! Take the few moments out of your day and make a batch it's well worth the time!

I've made this recipe every Christmas for the the few years, and it's always been a hit.  I thought I had already reviewed it, but I guess not.  I make it pretty much as the recipe calls, except I make 1.5x the sauce, and I cut the baklava within 1/4" of the bottom before baking (to keep the sauce from pooling on the bottom and making it soggy).  I also added about 1/4 t ground cloves to the nuts this year, along with the cinnamon.  It also helps if you only cut within 1/4" of the edge, too.  It keeps the phyllo from sliding around too much.  Another trick to cutting it is to use a very sharp knife and short, slow sawing motions.  To keep the baklava from getting soggy, it is crucial to pour room temperature sauce on hot baklava, right out of the oven.  That will allow the baklava to absorb the sauce while staying crispy on top.

Finally decided to try my hand at baklava since I love it and hubby usually gets me some at Christmas every year. First, I'm considered a pretty decent cook and enjoy it BUT, this can be daunting to those who are beginners. It took me a while to work my way through the phyllo dough which is tricky to work with. Then came the chopping of the nuts (yes I bought bags that said chopped walnuts but they were nowhere near small enough). Took others advice and made the sauce first. It had some sort of foam on it that I had to strain off (?) Did make more sauce than  recipe said (about 1 and 1/2) as I like mine gooey. This was time consuming to make, probably took me an hour and a half to get it together which included chopping the nuts as well as the layering. The cutting before cooking was tricky as well as everyhting kept shifting as I cut. Now all that said-THIS WAS AWESOME. It turned out delicious. I was impressed with the flavor and the looks of this. Great recipe, will make again when I have time to spare. Thanks!

I overcame a 30-year fear of making Baklava because of phyllo dough fear and let me tell you, this was a piece of CAKE (er, I mean Baklava...). It was very, very simple to make and tasted wonderful!  I went out and got some phyllo dough and it was frozen (naturally), so let it sit in the box, overnight in the fridge and it was ready to go first thing in the morning.  I followed the advice of several people and put wax paper and a very slightly dampend towel over my unrolled dough. Just a tip, make sure your damp towel isn't too wet as when your pile dwindles down, the dampness can make your dough sticky even though you have the wax paper barrier.  Also, the recipe never said to butter the top layers of the dough before putting it in the oven, and I just went ahead and buttered every two sheets as I had done in the stacking process and then buttered the very top. Using your brush, "paint" in one direction and hold the edge down with your fingernail as you make your strokes and you should be fine.  I also made my syrup first and put it in the fridge while I stacked and then baked the Baklava. Baked for 52 minutes at 325 degrees. It came out perfect and I'm very, very happy!  Try it!

Wow! So sweet and so good.  What I love most about this recipe is its versatility.  More or less sauce, more or less nuts, more or less cinnamon- it doesn't really matter.  It really depends on the person making it and their preference.  I made the recipe to a T (I used diced walnuts instead of chopped), and it turned out great.  My husband loves cinnamon and honey (why we have never had Baklava 'til now, I'll never know), so I used more honey and more cinnamon in the second batch, and it was fantastic.  Right now he has a batch with him, and they're on their way to be shared with a Biogeography class for a dish representing honey.  I can't wait to hear the reviews!! (Oh yeah, toasting the nuts is a GREAT idea, and very, very easy-diced walnuts in a 350 degree oven for 10 min.)

This is a great recipe, I have received nothing but accolades from the people who have experienced it so far. And it is actually quite a simple recipe once you get the hang of it, albeit a time consuming one at first. Just remember to thaw the phyllo pastry the day before in the fridge or on the counter as opposed to doing it in a last minute fashion in the microwave. :-) It will be very hesitant to come apart in clean sheets, and will be worthless after another freeze and thaw cycle (at least in my experience). And remember to cut the dough before baking, it may seem not important, but without doing so it becomes very messy once the Baklava dries out during the baking. Enjoy!

I used pecans for my nuts.  This recipe was great but the phyllo dough can intimidate some people.  Don't be!  Simply let it thaw per the instructions on the box and then cover the dough with a VERY lightly damp piece of paper towel.  Over this, I put plastic wrap to further keep in the moisture (putting the plastic first and then the paper towel didn't do anything for my dough).  Also, if you want to pour the sauce hot atop the hot baklava, you should make a lot more sauce b/c mine all settled to the bottom and left the top crunchy and nutty, but not very sweet.  The bottom layers were very sweet and flaky and were exactly what baklava should taste like, but the top and middle layers varied in sweetness.  I definitely recommend adding 1/2 more sauce than what is stated in the recipe.  Make sure to cut the shape you want BEFORE you bake it because it is difficult to cut the baklava afterwards and to maintain it's appealing flaky layers and shape.  You can really cut it any way you want.  This recipe allows for a lot of versatility - I used way more nuts than was suggested and I also didn't layer the dough as stated in the recipe.  Regardless, it STILL turned out great!  One item I suggest you have on hand is a clean paintbrush purchased specifically for brushing the butter onto the dough.  I would definitely try this again!  It is THE genuine article!

Snaps for Donna! This recipe is amazing. I never thought I could make this because its so complicated. I read so many reviews so I would make it right. The key is to have everything ready. Make the sauce first so it can cool, have the nuts chopped and have the butter melted. The phyllo I bought comes in a 2 pack each 9x13 so I didn't have to cut anything and its in plastic wrap so it stayed moist on its own. Take the time to coat each layer with butter. It's so worth the work. My kids never had it before and absolutely loved it! Thanks for a great recipe. A definite keeper!!!

This Baklava was in a word AMAZING. It was my first time making baklava and my first time using Phyllo dough ( by the way,make sure to keep the phyllo covered with a damp cloth at all times not working with it because it can get very brittle, as I found out :) ) and it was wonderful. This recipe for baklava is better than most baklava's I have had at restaurants and shops. My husband who is a baklava lover absolutely adored it. Thank you SOOOO much Donna :):):)

Good stuff! I've always been intimidated by this desert, but am so glad that I tried it. My only real problem was my impatience. I didn't wait for the phyllo to fully thaw before using and subsequently had quite a bit of broken peices. It still worked however and tastes great. I did use 1 1/2 times the amount of syrup as so many other reviewers did and I found that it was too wet. I will use the specified amount next time which I think would be just right. I also added about 4 tbsp fresh orange juice as my mom said this was usually added when she and my Greek grandmother would make it when she was a child. You can't taste the o.j. but it adds a bit of tang. I also stored mine loosely covered, I think an airtight container would only make it soggier. Thanks for this recipe.

Great recipe! This turned out perfect and delicious. I've always lived baklava, but I figured it was hard to make. This was so easy. It takes some time, but it's not difficult. Just remember to thaw your dough the night before. I will definitely be making this for our next family gathering.

I live not far from Tarpon Springs, a very nice Greek community in Florida. This Baklava is as good and maybe even better than what I have eaten there.Try it, you will definately like it.

Baklava is one of my favorite desserts but I never thought of making it myself.  It was so easy!  It was even better than the baklava I buy at the bakery.  The vanilla extract makes all the difference

Make the sauce first, in fridge.  I also make 1 1/2 times sauce.  Also add1/2 tsp. of Almond extract 

with vanilla.  Pulse the nuts in food processor.  Add 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon, dash of nutmeg 

and cloves to the nut mixture.   I use one of the two packages of Phyllo dough first, leaving the other 

in the refrigerator still in it's plastic wrap.  I don't bother with the towel/plastic wrap, I work quickly so 

the dough doesn't dry out.  When I'm done with the first package, I take out the second and do the 

same.  I have found I need about three sticks of butter when buttering the leaves of dough.  I use a 2 

inch brush, and I hold the corners and do the Outside of the leaves first which locks down the leaf 

then I quickly do the insides.  Don't cut all the way to the bottom, about 1/2 inch from the bottom so 

the liquid doesn't sit in the bottom of the pan and bottom is still crisp.   Don't use too much butter, 

that is another cause for sogginess.  Pour cooled sauce on the hot Baklava and let sit cool, Finish 

cutting all the way through.  Store in a shallow cardboard box lined with parchment I use shirt gift 

boxes.  I also freeze some for later, it freezes well.

This recipe is extremely close to what I do when I "wing it" using the ingredients and steps my mom used for years.   Here are few points, some of which others have made and which you can take or leave but they work for me:

- keep the melted butter well stirred between brushing sheets.  Butter is about 15% water and if you start brushing too much of that aqueous portion you'll make it soggy.  You could clarify the butter but there is quite a bit of flavor in the water and dissolved solids so I don't.

- I add both sugar and vanilla extract to the chopped nuts.  A few tablespoons of sugar and a couple teaspoons of vanilla seem about right.

- do not cut the baklava all the way to the bottom before baking.  Cut down to the last solid layer of phyllo.  This helps the syrup spread throughout the baklava instead of pooling on the bottom.  When it is ready to serve cut all the way through.

- a few notes on the syrup:  I don't think this recipe calls for enough.  I use about 1.5x & no honey.  Add the juice of half a lemon to the syrup before boiling.  Do NOT add the vanilla until the syrup is cool.  Simmer the syrup until it is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  You'll know it when you see it.  Chill the syrup until refrigerator cold.  Add vanilla and either rose or orange blossom water - a couple tablespoons is plenty - and stir in thoroughly.  I use rose water.  Try World Market for those.

Hot bakalava + ice cold syrup OR cooled bakalava + warm syrup = not soggy.

Fantastic recipe.  My layers were kind of messy, but still turned out fine. I used about 4 T. of nuts per layer since 2 T. didn't seems like enough.  Strongly recommend to cut almost through before cooking. Will use this recipe again and again.

I ALWAYS get a bunch of compliments whenever I make this, especially from one man in our church who is from Greece!  It's not difficult, just a bit time consuming. Everyone should make a homemade baklava at least once in a lifetime!  I don't change anything and it comes out as delicious as any I've ever had from a bakery. OH, one thing...you can now buy phyllo sheets that are precut for a 9"x13" pan. Definitely use them!!

This is the BEST baklava recipe, I don't have enough good things to say about it.  It made a LOT of baklava, that lasted forever even though no one could get enough of it.  Everyone raved that it was just like what you get at a gourmet bakery, and they could not believe that I had never once attempted this before.  I highly reccommend reading more reviews here, because some more experienced bakers had really great tips that helped a lot, like, knowing not to cut all the way to the bottom and not oversaturate the layers with butter to prevent sogginess. I have to say, having those detailed tips made me feel very confident with this recipe, even though everyone told me baklava was one of the hardest things to make.  I sincerely disagree, this recipe is proof!

I've never worked with phyllo before. Infact, I've never even had baklava before. On top of that.. I'm sixteen and I'm no PROFESSIONAL baker. But let me tell you, this is one of the EASIEST and tastiest recipes EVER. My mom brought a container to work and I had to make MORE because her coworkers loved it so much! I'm actually eating some right now for breakfast, and I've stored them in tupperwear containers in my fridge. DELICIOUS. Best dessert I've ever had!

A lovely recipe to follow, just a quick tweak here and there - I added cinnamon to my syrup, put more layers on the bottom - for more stability - if they taste 1/2 as good as they smell, this dessert will be a hit for years to come.  I found the 1 cup butter to be the right amount, and the syrup was the right amount also,  thanks for posting it, enjoy ~ Cheers

This was my first time making baklava and I was surprised at how good it turned out. I following the receipes, but made a few updates: (1)Used clarified butter aka 'ghee' instead of butter (2)Added 1/2 tblspn nutmeg + 1 tblspn of brown sugar to the nut mixture (3) Made half of the syrup + added lemon zest  (but wish I only added half of the vanilla extract...my syrup was too vanilla-y).
I put the baklava in the oven at 350 for 30 mins (turn once in oven-it was perfectly golden brown and really flaky/crunchy).
I made the syrup while the baklava was baking, (took me about 15 mins to make syrup).

I let the baklava cool for 15 mins (it was barely warm to the touch). 
Syrup cooled really fast; then spooneed/drizzled the syrup on the baklava squares (didn't cut the squares all the way to the bottom).

I let it sit overnight at room temprature and it was perfectly sticky and chewy the next day!!! :-) 
No sogginess at all.

This was amazing! I had never made Baklava before. I used the other users reviews and 1 1/2 the sauce, made the sauce about two hours before to let it cool, and added a few more layers to the top. WONDERFUL. Thank you.

I would have given this 5 starts, except that I found the directions a little lacking. I don't know if that was just me because I haven't made baklava before, but it seemed mine turned out a little dry. This might be because I didn't know if I was supposed to put anything in the layers besides nuts and cinnamon:( If I make it again I would add a little of the syrup mixture to the nuts. Otherwise the flavors are all there, I used walnuts and topped it with a little melted Nutella, so delicious. I also mixed a little with Zoi brand honey flavored yogurt and it was soooo good!!

AMAZING!!!! I took others advice and toasted the nuts (I used walnuts) and prepared the sauce before starting so that it was completely cool when it was time to pour over the baklava. It turned out perfectly! I had never worked with phyllo dough before so it took a little longer then stated to make but it was so worth it! I will definetely be making it again (and my husband can't wait!)

Awesome recipe as is. I only needed about 1/4 cup of melted butter and do not make 1 1/2 times more of the sauce (as was recommended by some reviewers) because that is way too much sauce. I should have stuck with the amount that was in the original recipe because I have a huge container of extra honey sauce that I'll have to use for another batch - not complaining, just saying. The baklava was delicious and aside from having to be a master at multitasking for this recipe, it was well worth it in the end. I ate most of my batch and got nothing but compliments from those who ate the remaining pieces. Much thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this with my kids - super easy and fun to make.  And tasted very authentic to us (we used to live in Greece).  I had no idea it was so simple to make.  I did make about 1.5x the syrup but everything else I made as directed. Will definitely make this again - this time we made it with pecans, but I look forward to experimenting with walnuts and pistachios.

Wow! If I have one word of advice for people considering whether or not to make baklava: Try this recipe! It is awesome and not as difficult as it looks. I used 1 cup each of walnuts, pecans, and chopped dates, tossing them with an added 1/3 cup of sugar. The dates added a wonderful taste and texture to the pastry. I baked it at 325 degrees for 55 minutes and it came out perfectly. Unlike many reviewers, I left the quantity of syrup the same and I am glad because it was the right amount. Thanks for a spectacular recipe!

We had a Greek themed dinner party tonight.  I made this recipe last night and I thought it was a total train wreck.  I was upset at the way it looked and when I spooned the sauce over it I was thinking, ""I'm not going to serve this.  There is no way this is going to work."  Boy was I wrong.  This stuff rocks!  It's incredible and something that I would expect to receive at a good Greek bakery.  The guests said that it was better than any baklava that they had had.  I added a touch of nutmeg to the nuts and used pecans and toasted them.  I melted the butter and used a pastry brush to apply it.  My actual baking time was closer to 35 minutes...it was starting to get too brown.  The review by Sandra Lee gives excellent tips to make the process easier...I wish I had read it BEFORE I baked it.  If you are not familiar with phyllo, there is a slight learning curve, but after you get past that this is easy and delicious.  My wife wants me to make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  So far the best recipe I've found here...and I've found some really good ones!

This is a great recipe !  A few minor changes:  I used 1/2 tsp more cinnamon, roasted and salted the nuts (I used pecans), then added a tbs of sugar to the nut/cinnamon mixture.  As far as the butter...go easy.  I use a cheap paint brush from Home Depot in my kitchen ($1, use it for a month, toss it...MUCH cheaper than a pastry brush).  When you put the butter on the phyllo, don't brush, dab.  Otherwise, you'll tear the phyllo.  And every bit doesn't HAVE to be drenched in butter...it will  be soggy and icky if you use too much butter.  I used only a 3/4 of a cup and even that was a bit much.  The goal is flaky/nutty/honey tasting, not soggy butter tasting.

Used about 1.3 lbs of nuts 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar on the nuts Doubled sauce Bought two boxes of phyllo dough as I knew I'd tear a lot of the sheets to where they'd be unusable. Glad I bought two boxes, used about 1 and 1/2.  Layer 8-12 layers of phyllo on bottom Sprinkle 1 and 2/3 cups nuts on top Layer 12 more sheets of phyllo Sprinkle the remaining nuts 12 more sheets on top  Brush butter in between each sheet of phyllo, not necessary to cut, just fold over and paint more butter over folded area.   Cut almost to the bottom but not quite with pizza roller. Easy and clean looking slices.   Cook at 350 for 20 minutes, then lower to 300 degrees and cook additional 29 minutes (got this idea from another recipe)  Comes out perfect!

Some more tips from Greece.  1) Traditionally almonds and walnuts are used.  Add pistachios (or do it only with pistachios) for a greater taste!  2) Use cinammon together with a little ground clove , not cinammon only.  3) Baklava success highly depends on butter quality, not quantity.  Use the best butter you can find, in small quantities.  Traditionally clarified butter is used (this is similar to indian ghee).    Enjoy :)

A great recipe - I have never made Baklava before, and this was a great recipe for a 'beginning baklava maker.' I used Athens brand phillo dough - and it was the perfect size for a 9x13 pan - no cutting needed. Also, I used MUCH less butter than was called for. Don't use too much butter, or the baklava will be soggy. I "stippled" the butter into the phyllo dough (and it really helped keep the dough down). Don't use a silicone basting brush, or the dough will rip. I didn't cut the baklava all the way to the bottom before baking, so the sauce wouldn't go all the way to the bottom and stick.

This is a great recipe!  I used chopped pecans and hazelnuts.  I think pistacios would be even better, and will use them next time.  I agree with previous reviewers, make the sauce first, chill and pour over warm baklava.  It comes out very well that way.  So easy too!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent.  I made one mistake though in using too many nuts.  The idea is that there will be enough of each layer in contact with the one below so that it seals together.  When I put on too much nuts, I got layers that separate.  Still wonderful, but....

Very easy and everyone loved it! I asked a greek family member about making baklava before had, and she said just to be sure to use lots of butter. I melted a good cup and a half extra and just kept pouring it on to keep the dough moist. I also added a bit of ginger to the nuts and a bit of lemon juice to the honey sugar sauce.

Very good baklava.  I have made it twice now.  The second time I added 1/8 of a tsp of nutmeg.  I melted the butter and used a silicone brush to brush it on.  The damp tea towel over a piece of plastic wrap kept the dough easy to work with.  Don't worry if you break the dough.  It won't make a difference in the end.

Very good--easy to make in my opionion because it doesn't really call for any cooking, just assembly--no more work than assembling a lasagna.  I made it the week before and froze it until the day before the party.  Allowed it to defrost in the fridge & served.  Excellent.

I did not care for this recipe. It is FAR from being authentic Greek baklava.The baklava was dry, it took way less than 50 minutes to bake (had I not been checking, it would have burnt to a crisp), the syrup wasn't good, and the measurements are no where near correct. I don't know why this has been rated highly so many times.

I made this last year at Christmas and everyone was impressed (I usually just do cookies).  It was so easy and delish my cousin said it was as good as his Greek friends Baklava.  I added some lemon and orange peel and a few whole cloves which I strained out before pouring over to the syrup.  A Greek friend also suggested using whole cloves on each piece which adds flavor, makes it pretty, and hold the top layer of phyllo down when cutting.

This was probably the best baklava I have ever tasted.  I brought it to a tailgate party and everyone was impressed (they didn't know how easy it was.)  I added quite a bit more cinnamon to the nuts than called for, and also baked it for less time, but it came out superbly.  I used a half walnut, half almond mixture for the nuts.  Make this recipe--it's easier than you think and delicious!!

This really is fabulous!  Much better than at the deli.  I didn't use much more than half the nut mixture though.  The recipe was a bit unclear as to how to finish the top - I think its 6-8 layers of just dough and butter (no nuts), to give it a beautiful crispy top.

Delicious!  This is absolutely the best baklava I've ever had, and my family loved it.  Much easier to make than I thought, although the layering took a long time.  I followed some of the suggestions from earlier comments, mainly: make 1 and 1/2 recipes of the sauce, refrigerate sauce before pouring over hot pastry right out of the oven,  roast the nuts beforehand, and cut to within a 1/2 inch from the bottom of the pan before baking (instead of all the way through). I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Definitely a good recipe. I have a similar one from a Turkish neighbor I got some time ago. Pro Tip: Make the syrup a little bit in advance and put it in the fridge until you're ready to bake. 
Also! It gives it an extra something if you boil the syrup with two small sticks of cinnamon and a fresh lemon slice.

Happy Baking.

This was my first try at making Baklava.  Needless to say I misread the recipe and only used 1 cup of pecans :0 but it still turned out good.  That said, once I realized my error, I readjusted the remaining ingredients, using 8oz of phyllo dough and only making about 4 layers.  Since I made the syrup ahead of time so it would cool, I had plenty.  Loved the way the syrup "crackled" as I poured it over the hot baklava.  Will definitely make again.

I tried to be good and use less butter. Don't do that. It came out super dry, use lots of butter!

This IS an easy version for 1st time makers.  I have been making this delicious dessert since I was a kid.....so, just a few tips:  I am a devout user of cardamom and believe it to be a necessary ingredient for authentic flavor, a little goes a long way and it's expensive, so see if someone you know will let you experiment with a little....also I prefer to use pistachios (yes, I spend an evening watching a movie and shelling the little guys)again, authentic...but I'm not afraid to mix it up with whatever I've got on hand...pecans, almonds, walnuts mixed equally works great.  I have always used powdered sugar and I'm VERY liberal with the butter (2 pounds!)  Just goes to show, this recipe can withstand whatever tweaking suits your taste!  It's an absolute JOY to share this type of "homemade LOVE" with friends and family! You will be famous!!!

It was my first attempt making baklava, and thanks to this recipe, I am no longer fearful!  This recipe is incredibly easy, albeit the process of making this dessert is time-consuming (regardless of whichever recipe you decide to use).  The only thing I did differently is having added one teaspoon of ground cardamom to the nuts (and increasing the cinnamon to two teaspoons instead of just one).  Cardamom is essential to the flavor of a true baklava - but it is also an acquired flavor and not pleasing to everyone.  I only used one stick (1/2 cup of butter), melted, and it was exactly enough for the entire batch.  If you like a very wet baklava, increase the amount of syrup.  I like mine not too dry and not too wet, and the amount stated in the recipe, is just right to yield that.

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfect! I did find out that I only needed 1/2 C. of butter instead of 1 C. Thanks for sharing. I will definately recommend this recipe.

I made this for a school project. It was super delicious. I would advise making extra sauce because the more sauce the better in my opinion.

I made this for the first time for a public event that was about local honey. It was delicious! I had never made it before and read all the reviews prior. I made 1 1/2 times sauce a few hours ahead, and put in frig. I used 1 1/2 c honey and less water. Roasted the nuts(used walnuts and pecans)and mixed in sugar and cinnamin and added a little sauce too. It made a 9x12 pan and an 8x8 pan. I used less than half the butter, I quickly brushed the phillo dough. I didn't need a damp towel or anything. It was super simple, cut it half through before cooking. I poured sauce and let it set over night! Not one piece was left and there were tons of desserts. Everyone thought I had made it tons and loved it. So thanks for the recipe!

I made this for our hubby for our anniversary today it he LOVED it! I only used about 1/2 the butter and melted it. I also only used 1/2 pound of walnuts. Both ingredient amounts were more than enough!
Butter the bottom and make the sauce ahead of time and put in fridge to cool. Then pour on hot baklava.

I am originally from Bulgaria and decided to use this recipe for the first time. Awesome recipe! Bulgarians only use finely chopped walnuts in their baklava so I decided to use only that. I also added one whole tablespoon of cinnamon in the nut mixture to bring out the flavor a little more. One stick of butter is adequate since you really need to only lightly brush each layer of phyllo dough with it. Here's another hint: make the sauace before starting the baklava, let it cool for about 15 min, and than drizzle some within each layer of nut mixture. Cut and let it bake as the recipe calls for and then pour the cooled sauce mixture on top of the baklava. Immediately put it in the fridge and let cool for about an hour or two before serving. Also, for the syrup, I added a whole cup of honey and about 2 tablespoons vanilla extract. Makes the flavor of the syrup and cinnamon compliment the strong taste of walnuts nicely. The final product was not too dry and not too soggy! My Irish boyfriend and his family were in love.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. Unless overcooked, it would be extremely difficult to screw up while making this. It was my first time making baklava, first time using phyllo dough. I can't use butter as I am severely casein-intolerant, so used clarified butter instead (ghee). I didn't have any pastry brush or baster on hand, so simply drizzled the ghee over the sheets and kinda spread it around with the back of a spoon. Missed some spots, other spots had too much butter, still turned out flaky and crispy. Added a touch more cinnamon than called for, which made the nuts very cinnamony but quite delicious! Didn't quite have a lb of nuts (I used only walnuts for the recipe), so just used what I had and added the extra phyllo sheets to the top for an extra-flaky crust. Used 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup honey for the sauce. I agree could have used a touch more sauce so will make more next time. Above all else, smells WONDERFUL when cooking!

This recipe is fantastic for freezing with no immediate detriment to taste or texture. There is almost no water in the final product which is needed for ice to form. So there is virtually no thawing necessary. You can eat chilled straight from the freezer or left out to room temperature.

This recipe was very fun and easy to make. I found that 16 ounces of phyllo dough is unnecessary; I only used one roll and it came out fine.

Very, very good and so easy.  I gave it 4 stars because I did think it was a tad too sweet but that was just me.  My husband loved it as is but I think the next time I will add just 1/2 of the syrup.  Mine did not get soggy at all.  It was crisp all the way through and as for the lady who claimed 50 minutes was too long and hers burned, I did not have any problems with it at all.  It came out light and crispy and perfectly cooked.  Maybe your stove needs to be calibrated?  Just a thought.  I will definitely make again and again!!! So easy and very inexpensive to make.  I had all the ingredients on hand and the phyllo dough was only 2.38 for a 16 oz box.

AMAZING!!! The final product looked & tasted as if I had been cooking greek dishes my entire life! Everyone raved about it, no leftovers, first to go at a family party! TIP: i thought there was a LOT of honey mix when pouring at the end so I held back at least 1/4, next time I will pour the entire amt although it seems excessive. The recipe isn't as sweet as it seemed and could use the entire liquid to really give it the exact sweatness/moistness. THANK YOU!!!!

Wow this was actually very very easy and my family said it was probably my best yet!! I bake a ton, and I do it all mostly from scratch so for my entire family to agree on that is a big deal!! I found this recipe to be SUPER EASY too which is the coolest part!
3 things I did specifically--1) I made double the honey sauce, as suggested by other reviewers and 2) I bought good quality, local honey, as I've heard the Greeks use premium honey and that makes a big difference... 3) As other reviewers suggested, I toasted the nuts ahead of time.
Don't get too caught up in counting out the exact perfect number of Phyllo sheets...it really doesn't matter too much.

Wonderful recipe. I added a small amount of sugar to the nuts (toasted walnuts) and cinnamon. I also used ghee (clarified butter) and did not need a cup of it. I agree with others to cover the phyllo you are not using with plastic wrap and then a damp cloth. Best advice I could give: Hot baklava and cooled syrup or hot syrup and cooled baklava.

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and turned the temperature down to 325 F, and it turned out perfectly.  Everyone I've served this to says that it's the best baklava they've ever eaten because it's not as over-the-top sweet as other versions. Even my husband, who is NOT a dessert eater loves it. This one's a keeper!

I was floored at how easy this was to make, relative to how incredibly good it tasted! I can't imagine paying for Baklava now that I can make an entire pan of it for what it costs for a few pieces! EXCELLENT recipe.

Careful! Doubt the amount of syrup you make. You'll have some left over but the amount listed here definitely isn't enough. Otherwise a great recipe! I added allspice and nutmeg to a pound of walnuts. Definitely recommend this recipe! Prepare everything beforehand and you'll be better off, it's a lot easier.

Like I dummy, I made this incorrectly and added the syrup BEFORE baking.  It still turned out incredibly well and everyone loved it.  Can't wait to make the RIGHT way next time!  Thanks. :)

YUM!! I used SPLENDA instead of regular white sugar, and added a little more honey. Easy to make, tastes great, and impressive. If you can't boil water, this recipe is for you!! :)

Very good and not nearly as hard or time consuming as you might think! They were a little "gooey" and not quite as crunchy as I've made from other recipes but the flavor was very good ... I will probably use a bit less of the sauce next time and see if that makes a difference.

WOW!!! My daughter called home at 3:00 one afternoon and told me she needed Baklava for 30 students the next day.  I knew I didn't want to spend a small fortune; so I looked on All Recipes.  This is a great recipe, and my husband said it was better than our local Greek restaurant.  Need I say more.  Thank you sharing the great recipe.  The only change I made was doubling the honey and making a recipe and a half of sugar, water, and vanilla.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up the phyllo dough in my freezer, and this caught my eye. I had never made baklava before and was very wary, but it turned out amazingly! Since my little brother is allergic to walnuts, I used pistachios and pecans, and I added some orange zest to the honey mixture. We were all blown away by the result. Really simple to make, and fancy enough to serve anywhere. This one is definitely going in my recipe box!

We have never attempted to make Baklava before and the thought of working with phyllo pastry scared the daylights out of me, but we made this for dessert tonight and I have to say it's to die for.  I was skeptical that it wouldn't taste anything like I'd bought in our Greek bakeries, but it did!  Even my daughter, who doesn't like nuts, ate this!  The only thing we would do differently is to make a little more of the syrup that you pour over the top :-))

This recipe is straight from God !!
I did not cut my phyllo I just folded back and forth. use a spray bottle for butter,it goes much quicker. I drop the oven temp to 325 for 50 minutes. I added 2 tsp cinnimon to syrup.Pistaschios are really expensive($20 for 1 lb.!!) so I mix 1 part pistashios with 3 parts cashews(toasted at 300 for 10 minutes)It has been a hit every time I make it.

This recipe turned out delicious, but I was confused on a few of the steps. My box of phyllo dough had 18 sheets in it, and once I factored in the 8 sheets on the bottom and the 6 on the top, there weren't too many layers with nuts, so I had a lot of the nut mixture leftover. I upped the amount of the sauce by 1/2 since so many suggested it, but I had some leftover, so I think the amount recommended in the recipe is perfect. I also had quite a bit of butter leftover, but that was probably my fault since I was paranoid about it turning out mushy. Even though I was really worried, this turned out fantastic!

I never knew it was so easy! I used the tip of not cutting all the way to the edges. Perfect! My Italian neighbor next door told me it was as good as any she has eaten abroad! Thanks! Next time, I think Ill try pistachios : )

Maybe I should have tried different nuts or less honey.  Just tasted like honey to me.  Maybe I just don't like baklava.

I have made this recipe over and over and it is requested by everyone when I go to a party.  It is so easy, but tastes like I have slaved over it for hours!  Incredible and it always disappears.  Onlt thing different for me is the cooking time, I only bake for about 40 min.

I was raised on Baklava but never made it myself. Since its one of my favorite sweets, I decided to make my own birthday cake this year. This recipe was wonderful! I followed the suggestions to make 1 1/2 of the sauce and it was the perfect amount. The only thing I would do differently is use local honey because the flavor is more rich. The only reason I used store bought is because I have a 2 year old and a 3 year old that will eat anything sweet and local honeys are not filtered like store brands.

My first time making baklava. Made the mistake of using half peanuts. I will never do that again. You really have to work fast and cover up the phyllo!

I have made this recipe time and time again.  It is delicious and is always a hit, especially with my dad in law, who goes to the freezer and eats from the secret stash.  FYI - they freeze well.  So make 2 batches, one for today and squares for when you have a sweet tooth.

So, I messed this up a little, but the good news is, even if you mess up, you'll still end up with something deliciously baklava-like! I thought I made it just as the recipe said (only change - baking at 325), but I ran out of nuts so I put on the top layer of phyllo (8 sheets deep). Seems I should have used the whole package up, but I had LOTS leftover. Problem - my walnut layers were too thick! I probably used more per layer than the recipe said! Next time I will know better. And there will be a next time! This is a whole lot of yum for such small effort, and there are variations I want to try that I've read in the reviews here. DON'T be scared of phyllo dough, and DON'T be scared of making baklava!

Wonderful recipe. I melted the butter and put it into a spray bottle and it really streamlined the process. Definitely the best baklava I've ever had.

I thought making Baklava was going to be an ordeal, but it was actually quite easy and delicious. Notes for next time: make the sauce an hour or more ahead of time so it can fully cool, layer more phyllo on the bottom (I like a flakier baklava), use maybe 1 1/2 pounds nuts since I only had enough for two layers of nuts and lastly, I think I'll cut (score) it before buttering the top layer so the phyllo doesn't tear as easily.

This is 10 stars!  This dessert is great!  I did make the following changes after reading other reviews: (1) I cooked it at 325 for about 42 minutes. (2) I cut it into 32 triangles. (3) I made the sauce before I started the layering and set it aside to cool. (4)  The cuts I made were not all the way through.  I cut the rest of the way after the Baklava had cooled slightly. (5) I only used 10 oz of chopped pecans and this seemed to be plenty.  Next time, before I start layering the dough, I will cut two sides to the size of the dish. I did not cut the dough in half as suggested, I just rotated where the overage was & folded it over.  This was a fun recipe and I will definately try it again!!

I am definitely putting this on 5 star !!!! I did add i pinch more ground clover in the syrup and added a bit more water ...... I think I over did it because it came out a little chewy mine so I think I would also go with a Lower heat temperate as mine did  unfortunately over cook:)!!! and I also put to much butter on the bottom pastry sheets !  I did have some trouble with the sheets as they dried out as I was buttering them . Which makes them crispy like and break if you bend them ..... so make sure you keep them moist:)    Everyone who tried it loved it ........ IT is my most VALUED recipe I have yet made !!!!!

I used to be able to get these perfect two bite packages of Baklava at my favorite "gourmet" grocery but did not see them as of late, so thought I might try my hand at making them myself.  Am I glad I did, and I found the easiest recipe at Allrecipes.com!  I used a combination of half toasted pistachios and half toasted pecans.  I ran them through a hand nut grinder, then pulsed them all a few times in the food processor with the cinnamon so they were a finer consistency.  I baked mine a little too long....45 minutes and they got a tad brown but the taste was spot on.  My husband couldn't stay away from them! I have to concur with another baker who said they found the filo easier to handle when the sheets were dried out a little.  If you work at a good speed brushing your filo and adding the nuts, the dough will not dry out that much.  Also, I think the key to this recipe is using the right size of filo dough, look for something that indicates "fine and silky," the optimum size is #4 Filo.. And to cut triangles, cut three rows down the long side, turn the pan around and cut the bars in half, and then in half again and you should have 12 perfect squares that you can cut into perfect little diamonds.  ...To cut diamonds, start at a corner, and cut diagnoally outward until the entire pan has been cut across, then cut down lengthwise a few times, till the diamonds are the size you desire. This was seriously delicious!

So good!  My husband said it was like he was back in Turkey.  I used the tip about using the spray butter container to spray on the melted butter. Good idea! I wanted to use pistachios, but couldn't find any unsalted.  I used walnuts and peacans.  Great recipe and pretty easy if you get everything ready before you start assemnbly.  I made the syrup the night before and added tangerine zest since I didn't have a lemon.  My husband almost ate the entire pan!

This was outstanding! My mom and i made this together. We made a couple of adjustments, because our families don't eat a whole lot of sugar and fat. Here were our adjustments: instead of 1 c. of butter, we used a little less than one stick (1/2 c.) butter, 1/2 c. honey, 1/2 c. sugar. We also layered about 5 layers of phylo dough--got it at Publix, which enabled us to make 2 9x13 pans of baklava. final note: watch the baklava in the oven, as ours only needed about 25-30 minutes (not the suggested 50) before it started turning really crispy and brown on top--perfect!  We had SO MANY people compliment on how they normally don't like baklava because it's entirely too sweet and rich and how this was just plain ADDICTING and more enticing! And it wasn't nearly as fatty! Enjoy and hope this helps.

OK, this recipe really is fool-proof!!! I love greek food, and wanted to make this to see if I could. I have never worked with Phyllo before, and didn't realize you needed to thaw it COMPLETELY before working with it. Well, needless to say I didn't and because it was frozen, trying to pull sheets off caused it to shred. But I kept on going, figuring I didn't want to waste it. Sure enough, even laying shreds of dough STILL TURNED OUT PERFECT! They have lasted over a week, and I love that they didn't turn into bricks of overly sweet sugar-messes that some baklava seems to be. They have just the right amount of sweetness and they make a huge pan! I'll make these again for Christmas. Oh by the way, use pecans and walnuts! They are divine!

This is so easy and nice,the trick for me is chop the nuts up small.I like to use a mixture of nuts and I also use 1/2 the amount of honey called for.Thank you for the keeper.

This was so good and easy to  make, the hardest part was actually cutting the unbaked Baklava.  
I will be making this again and I used pistachios which I think made this taste so good.

This was sooo good.  I must state that if your dough comes in 2 8 oz packages you MUST use both packages.  It is pre-cut into 9x13 size and easier to use.  Use 3 sheets in between layers.  I also made about 1 1/2 of the sauce.  Make sure that you watch it because mine started to boil over. Messy.  And let the sauce cool a bit before you pour.  Also- if you cut the lines in it a downward motion like you are perforating it then the sauce pours nicely and it is very easy to cut after it is cooled completely.  I just made this and have eaten 4 pieces before it had even cooled all the way!  Piggy goodness. :-P

Turned out great!  The trick is thin layers of nuts even thought it's time consuming.  Has anyone thought of using butter in a spray bottle or even butter flavored Pam?  I sure will next time to drastically cut down the time...

OMG!  This tastes amazing!  My mother-in-law, the diabetic, couldn't keep her hands off of this.  It's really easy to make too; just remember to keep the phyllo dough under a damp towel so it won't dry out.  I recommend using a clean spray bottle to put the butter on each layer.  It is easier to spread that way.

This was sooo good.  A LOT of work but well worth it!  You definitely have to make the sauce plus half, which made it PERFECT.  Also, make the sauce before anything so it can have time to cool.  This way, when you pour it on the baklava it won’t be so soggy.  The honey taste was a little too strong for me though.  I used a silicone brush to put the butter on but if/when I make this again I will undoubtedly use a spray bottle, it would have made it ten times easier to make.

Excellent recipe! I make this every year - several batches each time!  I failed to make it this last Thanksgiving & I never heard the end of it!  I use a mix of pecans & walnuts when I make this recipe.

This was fantastic!  I wouldn't change a thing. It was much easier than I thought it would be.  I made it 4 days in advance of a dinner party - it was perfect right up to the night and everyone loved it. The trick when you make it in advance is not to cover it with foil or plastic...or else it gets soggy. I kept it open and hid it in a clean cupboard. I did heat it up for about 10 minutes at 350 a 1/2 prior to serving to give it some warmth which was quite  effective. Will definately make again and again!

I have made this several times now.  First at Christmastime, then twice again during the winter,  and once just last week for my daughter's middle school Greek Fest.  We all love this recipe so much that I volunteered to make it when the requests came home from the school for contributions to the Greek Fest.  I had no idea the teacher would be sending home another recipe to use.  This other recipe called for corn syrup and some other yucky ingredients, so I rebelled and used this recipe again.  I wrote it down on a note to the teacher and listed the ingredients in case of any food allergies.  She wrote back to say that it was so much better than hers and she was thrilled to receive the recipe, plus she would be returning my pan in a few days since she was taking home the rest to let her family have some!  Thanks for submitting this, it is so awesome.  By the way, I've used Splenda  for the sugar and Pam for the butter and its just as good, and so much easier!

Definitely was not as easy as the submitter claimed it was, BUT it was incredibly delicious when finished. My advice: Don't use a damp towel because the phyllo gets too sticky to handle. Don't butter the top layer before cutting because the moist phyllo won't stay in place. And DO add some extra cinnamon in between layers. It tastes as good as any baklava I've had in a Greek restaurant!

This is so easy & so delish! I did learn however, with the top layers (the 6-8 sheets) to butter each one, otherwise they don't stay together after it's baked. This is one of my favorite things to take to a dinner!

I grew up eating baklava with pistachios, but people were talking about making it with walnuts, so I decided to do half with pistachios and half with walnuts.  I also wanted to try the idea of adding 1/4 cup of orange juice, so I did half and half with and without orange juice in the opposite direction.  They were all delicious, but the quarter with walnuts and oj was my favorite.  Walnuts were also much easier to deal with, because I didn't have to sit there and shell them for an hour.  I'd never worked with phylo dough before.  It was fine except when I had a damp cloth on the dough; then it got gummy.

I have made this recipe many times and it always comes out great.  The only variation I made was to grind the nuts in a food processor to a fairly fine consistency.  Everyone is always so impressed when I make this and it really doesn't require much effort.

Yum!  That's about all I can say because my hands are sticky from eating this right out of the oven... I couldn't wait until it cooled off...  I am having a party on Friday and this is Sunday.  I think I will be making it again before then because this won't last long!  Thank you for the recipe!!

It is my first time to make this dessert. It took me an hour to resemble and about 30 mins to brown the top.  I left the Baklava in the oven (turn off) for another 15-20 mins and turns out great. I did not put any cinnamon in the nut mix, nor the syrup. I use 3/4 cup of honey instead of the 1/2 cup it asked for, 1 tbsp of rose water instead of the vanilla. It gives better shine to the baklava and smell so much better.
My boyfriend loves it, and said it tastes so much better than the store or the restaurant ones.

WONDERFUL! This recipe was so good the first time I made it we ate most of the pan the first day and gave ourselves belly aches and sore mouths! The only advice I can give is share the joy! Don't keep it around too long or you will have the same fate as my family. I'm making another batch today and I'm going to try toasted almonds this time. Oh, and I have a long list of lucky friends to share it with, so maybe I won't eat myself sick.

Wow, I messed this one up! Just a note to those of us who love to cook & rarely attempt baking -baking measurements CANNOT be estimated like cooking ones can. Somehow I always forget that when I bake :) I ended up using way too much nuts between layers & running out of nuts before I ran out of layers so it was way too nutty! I still rated this 5 star because I know if I ever take the time to bake it right it will be delicious. And it wasn't so hard to make!

I've always  wanted to make Baklava but was afraid...something that good just HAD to be HARD to make!   I'm so glad I took the plunge!  It was amazingly easy once I got the hang of working with the phyllo dough.  Donna, I hope you gave that Greek gal a kickin' apple pie recipe...otherwise, you owe her one!!

I had never made baklava before, but found this recipe to be very easy and VERY tasty!  The only word of warning: bakers should know that phyllo dough has to be thawed in the refrigerator at least 12 hours before beginning to assemble the recipe.

I have made this recipe several times, and friends who have been making Baklava for years have asked for this recipe. I used the idea of emptying a spray butter bottle and putting my own melted butter into it. That saved so much time, and I think the result was better, since everything was more evenly spread out. Love this recipe!

Super easy to make. I just tried it for the first time and it came out wonderfully. I do recommend adding the extra sauce since mine could have used a little more. The walnuts I used tasted great but can not wait to experiment.

This was AMAZING! I made one and a half times the syrup and kept everything else the same. I used chopped walnuts.

This is amazing!  I followed the modifications recommended by the other reviewers and it was so super good.  I used walnuts and hazelnuts and roasted them.  I made (1.5times) the sauce beforehand and let it cool while I made the baklava.  I worked quickly with the phyllo dough, so I didn't use a damp towel to cover it, but I did cut it to the length of my pan.  I have a nice silicon pastry brush that was perfect for spreading the melted butter on the pastry sheets.  I cut the baklava before I baked it, but I didn't cut all the way through.  I let it cool for about 30 minutes before pouring the sauce over it.  It turned out so super good!  I will definitely, definitely make this again!

This is my favorite thing to make, it makes people happy when I make this.  I haven't met anyone who didn't LOVE this recipe.  After the first time you make this the process will move along faster.  I like to add more layers of phyllo dough than called for. Sometimes If i have it I will add some lemon zest to the syrup

I just made this for the first time and it's very good!  I followed the advice of reviewer Sandra Lee who's been making this for 30 years along with the posted recipe.  The changes I made on advice from Sandra were the amount of butter.  I used only about an 1/8 of a cup at most, not one cup as the recipe suggests!  The reduction in butter did not take away from the end result one bit.  I also did not cut through to the bottom of the pastry before cooking but to within a half inch, also on advise from Sandra Lee.  This produced an evenly moist product.  I also used more honey in the sauce as suggested by yet another reviewer.  That added a rich honey flavor.  All family members loved this, even ones who haven't cared for store bought in the past.  Delicious!  Thank you Sandra Lee for the expert advise!!

Need to make to make 50% more syrup (x 1.5). Cooling the syrup while the baklava is prepared/baked makes for a crispier final product.

This was delicious.  Took about an hour for the first time.  I toasted the walnuts and pecans in the oven and added cinnamon and a bit of sugar.  I melted a cup of butter but must have been stingy when brushing and used a little more than half.  Brushed it heavier on the last layer on top.  Made the amount of sauce in the recipe first and cooled it and the result was great - not soggy, not dry.  Great recipe!!

A first time HIT with family!  Never made baklava before.  So easy (just time consuming as working with filo always is) and so good!  I used a vanilla bean which gave it a little different flavor than baklava that I have had, but it was a nice flavor twist.  BTW, I always see baklava as a "middle eastern" dessert (lived in a neighborhood that sold it fresh at middle eastern markets).  It is fair to say, like many dishes, that it came via the "east" to Greece. No wonder it is also a Greek favorite.

I LOVE baklavas and never thought of making them until I found this recipe. I always assumed that it was difficult to make but it's so easy. I didn't change the recipe at all and it's great just the way it is, but I will make it again using the suggestions of other reviewers as well.

I wanted to make baklava to surprise my husband who loves it. Even though it was my first time making this it turned out great! I toasted walnuts, made one and a half of the sauce. I ran out of honey so I used mostly honey and some maple syrup. I probably ended up using only 1 and a half sticks of butter. I also added a little lemon peel and orange peel.  I found Sandra Lee's review to be very helpful and time saving. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I did what the review Sandra Lee did and did not follow the directions on the Filo Box. I was looking for a recipe that is harder then the average, and never had Baklava before. I found this recipe to be one of the easiest desserts i have made. Everyone loved the recipe. Thank you Neonwillie for sharing!

this was fantastic, and SO easy to make, since I read everyone's tips and reviews.  The spritzer bottle method was wonderful.  I did make 1 1/2 recipes of the syrup.  Didn't use but 1/2 c. of the butter.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Now I'm not afraid to use phyllo dough!

Amazing baklava!  My husband's family is from Palestine so he grew up eating middle eastern food.  I have never cooked it and barely eaten it (except at his parent's house).  So, for his birthday I wanted to surprise him with a baklava birthday cake.  This was the most amazing baklava I have ever eaten and my husband said it was better than any baklava he's ever had.  Even my kids were licking their plates!  It does take a little bit of time, with all the layers of phyllo dough.  BUT I PROMISE it's worth it!!!!!!!!!!!

Tasty, but the top of my baklava got all messed up when I went to serve it... also, I think that might have been too much syrup sauce.

People at work asked me if this was an old family recipe haha. I told them the truth but they were all amazed at the baklava. I read what other users said about needing more syrup but I didn't remember until I'd already made it so I just eyeballed and added more sugar/water/honey and it was great. I definitely didn't double the syrup, maybe 1 and 1/2 Xed it and I feel like I had the perfect amount. Also, listen to the tip about not covering it if you don't want it to get soggy. I kept some pieces at home covered and some uncovered and the covered ones were soggy as heck. I did have to cover them for a whole day until I got to work, but it was fine. I didn't find it very time consuming, definitely worth the payoff. Also I had to mix walnuts, pecans, and almonds (which I thought would ruin it) and it was still great. This recipe can withstand a lot of substituting I think.

Excellent recipe! I was a bit nervous but it went together very easy and everyone loved it! I have to say the best advice was to empty a "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" spray and fill with the melted butter. Made it so easy. Also I cooled the sauce and added it right after I took it out of the oven. The plastic wrap and damp towel also worked great. I used 1 1/2 of the sauce recipe. Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic.  First time I tried Baklava.  Very easy.  I found covering the phyllo with a damp cloth made the next layer or two too soggy.  I agree with another reviewer to turn down the oven to 325 degrees.  You couldn't go wrong with a little more sauce even though the recipe is great as written.

Made it for a couples night event, and non was left! One thing I will do next time is to ignore the suggestion of making another 1/2 cup more syrup. the bottom was a little too soggy for my taste. Next time I'll stick with the original recipe.

For authentic flavor you really need to substitute the cinnamon with 1.25 teaspoon ground cardamom.  You won't believe the depth of flavor it adds....

I made this because of the sheer popularity of this recipe on this site .. with this many rave reviwes it had to be amazing (right?) .. also, I sometimes buy baklava from a local mediterranian market where I live, so I know what to expect ... this is a great recipe, but I don't think I would make it again... it is way to sweet, and I even cut down on the honey as others mentioned ... I made a 9x13 pan and cut it into squares, I don't think my family even ate half of it .. it's just too rich, and something better bought by the slice (like at the deli/market) ... it was fun to try though and I am glad I made it  :)

I added 1/2 tsp of Salt to make the flavors pop, and added a large slice of orange peel/zest  and 1 full up of honey in the syrup along with 2 tsps of lemon juice. AMAZING!

A good recipe, but here are a couple of hints: Melt the butter and use a pastry brush. Cut the pastry BEFORE you bake it . Pistachios, walnuts and pecans are the best nuts for baklava. DO NOT cover after complete, and remove from baking pan so the bottom doesn't soggy. Too Sweet... use less honey!

Very good. Only had it once at a gyro takeout restaurant and thought I would try to make better. This was twice as good! Little time consuming but now that I know what im doing it should be faster next time.

Great recipe. Easy to make and the phyllo brand I use now makes their sheets 9x13, making it even easier now that I don't have to cut them to fit the pan. I substituted rose water for vanilla for a more authentic flavor and served it as dessert at a Greek dinner for Easter. While it didn't taste exactly like the baklava I used to get in Omonia Square, it was pretty close! Re: the Greek or Turkish origin controversy, does it really matter? After all, hot dogs were originally "frankfurters" a treat invented in Germany, but nothing is more quintessentially American.

excellent and easier then I thought it would be, definitely needed more sauce, so i made an extra half quantity, as a personal preference I like less nuts. be careful not to put too much butter on the layers to avoid soggyness. I like baklava not so sickly sweet so I substituted a quarter of the honey quantity for maple syrup and white sugar it worked well!

I was kind of scared to make this, but i was up for the challenge. I never heard of phyllo dough before, so i had no idea what it looked like or how to handle it. I wasn't aware that it had to thaw out before using, so one of my pans was used with broken pieces of the dough. It turned out as amazing as the one with the thawed dough. My family and co-workers loved it and keep requesting it!

I love my baklava with a mixture of walnuts and almonds, gives it a totally different taste. I've also made it with almonds only. Tastes a little lighter cause the walnut has a heavier taste. I also put 1 clove into each piece of baklava after cutting it and before baking it. Gives it a nice aroma.

I have also have a comment to make, I do like the Greeks and their cooking, but you have to give the credit where it's deserved.  I agree with CA2, baklava is Turkish, even the word is, so is yogurt, so is Turkish delight and so is Tzaziki ( cuucumber sauce, in Turkish it's called cacik and so many other dishes even the gyro and kebabs. No offense my Greek friends that's the reality and Turkish versions are much tastier too.

My mom is from Bulgaria and this is a very traditional dessert there too, but they usually do it for the welcome of the New Year and they hide fortunes inside for every one. I love this dessert.

Amazing recipe. I did not have to cut my phyllo dough, it fit in the pan already. I did have to make more of the butter, about another 1/2 of the original recipe to cover everything. I thought the sauce was very good, I did what the other reviewers had and did an extra 1/2 of sauce in addition before hand and cooled it down. It was wonderful!!

Very nice indeed but admittedly not the best I have had. I used the nuts as they came in the pack, but next time I will whizz them up in the blender to chop them even finer. The layers didn't hold together quite as they should so next time I will make the syrup a little heavier - 235ml water to 235g sugar rather than 200g of sugar. Also next time I might add some lemon zest to the nut mixture and a little lemon juice in the syrup.

I like this recipe, and am half Greek! I learnt from the authentic chef - my mother. However,if you are on a strict budget and enjoy treating your friends to this dessert more often  given the expense of honey I would change the following:  Replace orange juice and a little zest (no pulp) for the water and half the honey and 3/4 or less cup of sugar while making the syrup. No lemon zest in this case. It makes a thick enough syrup. My baklava never sits around long enough to get soggy.  It fools the mind and delights the senses. My diabetic friends can dose their insulin according to the number of slices they indulge in.  Enjoy

This was a very easy recipe and it came out very nice!! We had a middle eastern inspired dinner so it went well with it.  Everyone complimented on it.  Just make sure that when you do lay down the Phyllo dough you brush on the melted butter.  And make 1 1/2 of the syrup sauce.  I made extra but did not use it all because I though it would be too much, but I realize that it would have been better if I added all of it in.  Make sure it has a chance to sit as well!!

This is a great recipe. I have tried to make baklava before with no success (I am not a genius in the kitchen though I try to be ; ) ).  I made this with no trouble at all.  I use pistachios and they really add flavor. I also layer and butter 6-8 sheets of phyllo between nut layers. Doing this really defines each layer and with the green of the pistachios it makes it really pretty. The only other thing I do is add about 1/8 cup of honey to the sauce. It kind of gives it some extra stickiness which I actually like. This is a wonderful recipe and really fun to play around with. It is actually simple enough for my 12 year old to do. I love working with phyllo (not sure why!). A trick I use if I can't work fast and it will dry out is to put a damp towel over it. When I say damp though, I mean barely wet! I just spray it once or twice with a spray bottle. That keeps it from getting too moit and sticking. My family loves this treat and they have me make it for them every holiday.

GREAT!! Yes, the directions are a little vague for someone who has never worked with phyllo and it should mention to melt the butter but if you use some common sense it will come out AMAZING!!!!!!

I have always been hesitant to make baklava because I thought it would be difficult, time consuming and messy.  This recipe is super and so easy!!  I took the advice of a reader and cooled my sauce before i poured it over the warm baklava - awesome with just the right amount of crispness.  My husband cannot get enough of this and even commented that it's better than he's had in authentic greek restaurants!

I use 1 cup nuts, half cup pinenuts and half cup pistachios to make Baklava. Instead of layering the cakes, I extend dough up to a square yard long and buttered all the surface, then toss over the nuts with cinnamon and roll up, cut the roll into small rolls and then bake.

really need to do almost 1 & 1/2 times the sauce, not cut all the way through so the sauce can seap in.  Then, rotate and angle the pan to get the sauce to move around and drizzle through the layers. Eat cold.

My wife's new favorite dessert!!! It doesn't last 24 hours when we do make it.  The only thing is do not use raw peanuts.  They came out bitter when we did.  Otherwise, we have used almonds, walnuts, pecans, and macadamias.  All tasted sinfully good!!!

I, too, realized that I haven't reviewed this recipe, yet it is one of the first I tried from AllRecipes.com.  AND it is my most requested for the holidays.  I make several candies and cookies for gifts and this is always the centerpiece.  I have tried black walnuts, pistachios, and almonds for this recipe and the walnuts are our favorite.  This is a fabulous recipe that looks like it took a lot of time and a great amount of skill, but it is SO easy and delicious.  TRY IT!!!

Tastes different for sure. Doesn't taste like the real "Baklava" which is a Turkish thing, not Greek. Probably that's the reason for the different taste.

My husband & I loved this!  So easy, and unlike some baklavas I've had it's not sickly-sweet.  I would add just a touch more cinnamon next time, though.  Did I mention it's easy? ;-)

This is an excellent version of Baklava. If I had to be critical, I would suggest the following. Do not overbrown the Phylo layers in the oven. Pull it when it is camel colored.  Secondly the recipe calls for nuts. I did 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 whole almonds in the food processor. It was amazing. The whole thing should only be eaten the next day. GREAT RECIPE!

This was awesome!!!!! I am egyptian, so this is also a traditional dessert for me. However, I am not great YET at Middle Eastern dishes. My husband is also Egyptian and although he loves my American/ Mediteranean style of cooking. I am sure he feels deprived. I gave this recipe a try (after several miserable attempts with other recipes) and he and even our toddlers were jumpin out of their seats. Loved by all, and the entire pan disappearedwithin a half hour. Thank you for a simple, easy to follow recipe. I did take the advise of a reviewer and when I cut the baklava, I didnt cut all the way down. It turned out exactly how I like it. Hubby likes it drenched in syrup so I made a little extra syrup and drizzled more on top of his.

Very, very good. I made it with Orange Blossom honey, and added half a tablespoon of Orange Blossom Water (Like RoseWater, but Orange Blossoms) to the walnuts, and the same amount to the syrup. It. Is. Fantastic. The Orange Blossomyness really makes the difference. =D

Really yummy, and I got alot of people at the office asking me for the recipe! My boss wanted Middle Eastern food for a meeting- Got the food, but the place that I got it from doesn't have good baklava, so I made it myself.  The ONLY thing I would change on the recipe is that I didn't need to cut the sheets b/c they fit the size of the cookie sheets. I think it just depends on the brand you get. I measured the standard ones at the store, and they are alot shorter on both ends, so the directions that NEONWILLIE gave is probably correct.  I layered at least 8 sheets on the bottom, 2 first, butter, 2 more, butter, etc. Then 1/3 of the nuts, 2 more sheets, butter, 2 more sheets, 1/3 of the nuts, etc.  Using onlly 2-3 T. of nuts, you would end up w/ too many nuts at the end. Also, I doubled up the syrup, because I like mine sticky- and that is proportionate to what was called for on the recipe on the box.  On the phyllo dough box recipe, they added in 1/8 t. cloves- I did a sprinkle so I wouldn't deviate too far from this recipe, and it came out really good.  (Boss was happy!)

I have made this for Christmas gifts for the past several years - when I thought I might not do it anymore, I was begged to continue.  This is a wonderful recipe - Greek friends have given all thumbs up!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last Friday, and I had never even eaten baklava before.  I served at a Christmas party and sent some more to my husband's work.  It got rave reviews, I'm off to make another round, again for my husband's work!

I have made this recipe several times and each time it comes out perfectly delicious!  Until finding this recipe I always thought baklava was too complex to make - I'm so glad I stumbled across this straight forward recipe - thanks so much for sharing!

Even thought I modify it a little bit, this is the best baklava recipe I have found.  I make this as an extra special holiday treat for my family and friends.   I occasionally will mince dates in with my nut mixture for a little added flair. I can never make just one pan; I usually make two or three at a time and it goes very fast!

My son and I had never made Baklava before, but chose this recipe to make for a "Middle Eastern Food" party, in his World Studies Class.  Even though we made a mistake and only used half of the phyllo dough, so the baklava wasn't as high or a full of the nuts as it should've been, we still won first prize in the dessert category!

I absolutely love this recipe. I'm making three batches for Christmas for the family. The only thing I did differently is I added one more phyllo sheet between layers of nuts. The nuts kept tearing the dough apart with only two layers, one more layer fixed it. Whatever you do, cut the baklava before pouring on the honey mixture. I had a completely stupid moment and didn't cut it on one batch. The center didn't get sweet, but that was my fault! I love this recipe so much, it's so relaxing for me to make. Just takes time and patience. Going to experiment with other nuts later, I've used pecans every time. And DON'T be stingy with the butter!

Excellent. So delicious I had to make another one a few days after finishing the first one. I make the syrup first and let it cook while I assemble everything. The first time I had funny shaped little scraps of phyllo because of the way I trimmed the dough. I used them to piecemeal several layers and no one could tell the difference. The next time I trimmed the dough properly and had nice sheets for the baklava, which made things easier. The first time I used only 1/2 a cup of butter for the whole pan and baked at 350. It was browned and crispy. The second time, I baked at 325 and used the full 1 cup of butter. A few of the phyllo layers didn't seem cooked and the whole thing was not as crisp. I also tried using 1x the recipe for the syrup and 1.5 times as someone else suggested. It was too sweet with the extra syrup, but just right with the written amount. I will definitely be making this again! This recipe is not difficult, even though it does take time. I've found making a baklava to actually be quite therapeutic!
Thanks.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, and I have become famous for it. It's easy to put together, although a little messy and time consuming, although I manage 48 pieces out of one recipe. I have always poured the hot honey over the baklava, and found that it works well, although I am planning on trying it cooled next time. I have never 1 1/2 the honey, and find it's sweet enough, just like any I have bought in the stores. For any Canadians trying this recipe I suggest the President's Choice brand of phyllo (from superstore or Extra foods). I also add about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the honey and a couple of splashes of amaretto. This has become a Christmas tradition in my house.

Okay so I made this today, and I am so glad I did. I could hardly wait for it to cool to try it. It is fantastic!! I took some over to my in-laws and they said it was the best they ever had. 
I took the advice of many, and made the syrup ahead of time. And made 50% more like suggested, but didn't use it all. I used a mix of walnuts, pistachios, and almonds and roasted them before chopping. I used my food processor to chop them up, and it was a perfect combo of finely chopped nuts with just a few chunks. The phyllo dough was surprisingly easy to work with. I kept the plastic wrap over it and a damp towel over the wrap. I only used slightly more butter than the recipe called for. I baked it at 325 for 50 minutes and poured the cooled sauce over it. Incredible!! I will most definitely make this again, and I am thinking of using Pam Butter flavor, and replace half the honey with half light corn syrup (I'm not huge on honey). All in all, fantastic recipe. Delectable!

Excellent. Tastes just like on the Danforth. I was worried about the type of honey I chose, (non standard variety) but it still worked. 

Next time though -- more than 2 sheets between each nut layer, maybe 4 as they just dissolved and I like my nuts to be more separated and only use the specified amount of sauce. I had too much.

easy to do and absolutely delicious.  i made the sauce first and let it cool while i made the blakava itself.  i cut the phyllo dough with scissors (all the pieces at the same time) so that they could fit into my mold.  great results!

Verly good, but a little too sweet. The second time I made it I cut out more than half the sugar and it tasted a lot better. I also added more layers of the filo dough. Love it then.

I made this for a New Years Eve party and by the end of the night there was nothing left. I did make some changes I left the nuts out and added ground clove and nutmeg with brown sugar between the layers.
It was a huge hit. 
Was told it was better then some they had at a restraunt.

Wow!  I've always been teased for my "interesting" creations, but this... I totally earned my baker's crown this Christmas and my grandmother was incredibly impressed.  She never goes back for second pieces on dessert and broke her personal rule!  Note: If you use a damp cloth, make sure it's barely damp, otherwise the phyllo becomes tacky and hard to separate.  Other than that, this is the BEST baklava I've ever eaten, and I was so excited to inroduce my family to something new!  Thanks Donna!

I have never made Baklava before but wanted to try it when my mom told me how much she loved it.  I thought I would make it and give it to her for Christmas. Well, I am on my second piece already and it hasn't even cooled!  It is so good.  I hope it makes it to her house this week! I used a combination of hazelnuts, pecans, and pistacios. I thought there would be too much of the nuts but ended up almost running out at the end.  I used 1T. Korte cin and 2T. sugar in the nut mix. I used a spray bottle for my melted butter and that worked well. I did not spray the top layer until after cutting.  I had no problem with the phyllo.  The hardest parts of this recipe are cutting the baklava in the triangles and trying not to eat it all!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave this a 5 because of the response from everyone at my dinner party.  They loved it, I thought it was okay.However, I Have never eaten it before to give a comparison.  You have to work fast with that phyllo, keep it under a piece of plastic wrap, then a moist towel on top.

For what appears to be a complicated dessert, this is fairly easy to make.  My mother used to make this recipe all the time for my Egyptian stepdad. I make a few changes. I make the syrup first and cool it to poor on the hot Baklava. Watch the syrup; it will seem like its not boiling, then boil over quickly. It took me an hour to clean my stovetop since I did it twice! I don't cover the Phyllo dough, as I'm pretty quick and make sure to not brush too much butter; you should not need more than what the recipe calls for. Just use quick brief dabs and strokes of butter and don't worry about covering all of the sheet; it will bunch some, but don't worry about it too much. I use a heaping tsp. of cinnamon and make sure the nuts are a mix of fine and coarse chopped. I only put about 1 to 1.5 tbsp of nut mixture in the layers, as my family doesn't care for it too nut heavy. Make sure your rack is in the middle of the oven and start checking it at 30 minutes to make sure its not going beyond a deep golden color.

I have never made Baklava before, this was "EASY"...I made it exactly as directed. I did read the reviews & noticed alot of people had problems with it, (to watery-too sweet) my opinion is it absolutely "AWESOME" just as it is. My advice is if you don't love sweetness, don't attempt to make it, & wait for the pastry to absorb the liquid, duh!! Will definately make this again & again. I would like to say "THANKS TO THE CHEF" for a delicious recipe.

Thank you so much for the post!  Everyone loved it.  I was told it was the "real deal".  I added 1/2 cup more honey and only added 1/2 the vanilla before I cooked it.  I added the rest of the vanilla after the 20 minutes simmering time so it wouldn't evaporate.  Very very good!

This is the best recipe!  I followed the suggestions of cool syrup over hot pastry and it turned out fabulous.  For some reason, I only used half the pastry, but that may just be me.  I also used splenda (not the half and half version) for the syrup, and people could not believe that the syrup wasn't made with sugar.  This is a must make for people who love baklava.  So easy.

I can't rate the taste because I never got that far.  The recipe was so confusing that when I was ready to bake, the "substance" was so messed up that it ended up burning and smelling the house up.  Definately harder than the rest of the reviewers let on.

I was able to 'build' it by myself without any problems at all. Wet towel, melted butter, no problemo. Assemble everything at hand and turn on the kitchen TV. My syrup turned out perfect. Just a hint: If you don't simmer just under a rolling boil it won't thicken and you'll end up with a watery syrup. If it's not sticky and the consistancy of pancake syrup, cook longer. Even after 4 days the remainder still crunchy from top to bottom. Our guests said it was the best ever. I added grated lemon peal and 1 t. lemon juice. Just fabulous! I will make this every Christmas!

Wheee!  Yummy!
Actually, I had never made baklava before...but the sounds of "Mmmmm!" coming from five different mouths was music to my ears.  Everyone loved it.

PS- I used pecans.  Very good, but I only used half a pound of nuts, and it was still pretty nutty.  I'm not such a big nut fan, so I would never use a full pound.  You'd basically have a pecan pie.

Plus, I used my hands for the butter.  :D

Well Donna, the only way to describe your recipe is absolutely delectable.  Aside from tackling the phyllo dough (my 1st time), the recipe was so simple.  I have impressed many with this recipe and YES it seems as though I now have that Master Chef edge.  Thanks so much.

I was so terrified to make baklava, but this recipe completely distilled that fear.  It is so easy!  Phyllo dough is actually pretty fun to work with, and the final product is fantastic!

I made this for a gathering of friends and one lady told me that this was the best baklava she had ever eaten. It was even better than the baklava that her Greek friend makes. This recipe will definitely stay in my recipe book.

This is awesome! Should be twenty stars! Not difficult at all. The most time comsuming part is chopping the nuts. This only needs 1/2 package of phyllo though(8 ozs), I thought I had messed up but previous reviewers found this true also. I made 1 and a half recipe of syrup mixture and used almost all of it . Probably 1 and 1/3 recipe would be good. I doubled the honey though. This is one incredible recipe that will WOW all the friends and family! Will make again and again. Thanks a million Donna!!!

This was very good.  The phyllo was not as difficult as I thought.  I sprinkled the top with cinnamon-sugar before baking and added lemon zest to the syrup.

I'd never attempted baklava before but this turned out great.  I'd served it as dessert to souvlaki but I had customers buying extra pieces.  Better make a double batch next time.  Very, Very nice recipe.

I made this for my fathers birthday.  He loved it!  This recipie is simple and incredibly tasty.  The filo dough is time consuming but the result is worth it.  To respond to the previous review...you don't really know good baklava if you think the bottom shouldn't be a little gooey and sticky.  The yummy sweet honey sauce makes it that way.  Without it baklava would be dry and just taste like chopped nuts.  I will definately make this again.

Wow!  I loved this!  I've never made baklava before but always wanted to try.  I made it for my daughter's Greek Festival at her school and it turned out great!!  I added a couple of dashes of ground cloves to the syrup because I saw a show that said it was traditional to include it.   I reheated the butter in the micro when it cooled and thickened a bit to keep it from tearing the phyllo when I brushed it on.  Also, the box of phyllo is enough to make two batches since you cut it in half.  I'll make two next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Wow... so easy! I have never used phyllo dough before so I paid very close attention to the directions on how to handle it. I like the advice about laying it over the edge and folding and only cutting to *near* the bottom. Next time I will do that. The one thing I saw in other recipes was the addition of lemon juice or zest. I can understand how that helps to mellow and cut the sharpness of all the sugar so I did add it. In fact, I used 7/8C of water and 1/8 C of lemon juice with the sugar when I boiled down the syrup. FANTASTIC idea. It's beautiful and delicious. 10 thumbs up!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have brought it to a lot of office and holiday parties, and everyone raves.  One Greek person said it was better than his mother's (shhh).  I do only use 1/2 lb walnuts and one roll of the phyllo dough (so, 8oz).  It makes for thinner baklava, but it's very crispy and manages to soak up all of the syrup.  I'm surprised that people have written about cooling the syrup.  I boil it for the last 20 minutes the baklava is baking (YES definitely pre-cut - use a *very* sharp knife so the phyllo doesn't rip or slide), and then you pull the baklava out of the oven and pour the boiling syrup over it immediately...it will run down all the cracks between the diamonds.  As it cools, the syrup becomes thicker and is soaked up by the crispy phyllo.  Yummmmm.  (I am making it again right now...waiting for the first 30 mins to be up so that I can boil the syrup!)  Oh, my pastry brush was kind of rough.  I actually use a Bare Minerals blush brush (new and shampoo'd before using).  The soft bristles barely disturb the phyllo.

After reading everyone's reviews I made 1.5x the amount of sauce, cooled the sauce before pouring it into the hot baklava. This made the baklava intensely sweet, but still very good. Next time I think I'll go with the prescribed amount of sauce so it's not so rich. This recipe calls for an obscene amount of butter. You only need to spread enough butter on the layers to so that they are barely covered. I melted the full cup of butter, and when I was finished I probably didn't use half of it. Next time I'll melt half a stick of butter, then melt more butter as necessary. I used almonds and pecans and it was wonderful. I'll definitely be making this again!

I took this to a multi-cultural lunch, and it was the hit of the day.  I used pecans for the nuts, and it was absolutely fabulous. I think it would be good made in the phyllo dough that comes in the cupcake shapes.  I will probably add a dash of nutmeg to the cinnamon as well.

!! LOVE THIS RECIPE-- Just made it last night- for a fundraiser at my local hospital. Everyone who bid today on the baklava plates loved it!!  I will agree with other reviews (THANK YOU FOR THE HELP!!)---yes, make 1/2 more of the syrup- make the syrup first- and refrigerate- definitely toast the nuts (I used Pecans and Walnuts)--put the nuts in a big ziploc bag and beat them well!--USE PARCHMENT PAPER in the baking dish!! and SPARE THE BUTTER-- I ended up making 2  dishes --baked in 9 by 13 inch pyrex glass, and the first round I used WAY to much butter-- GO LIGHT on the butter!! What a great recipe-- this will be in my permanent collection!

This was the first time my wife and I ever made Baklava. It was a bit of work and we were worried but it was a hit. From our more fickle baklava eating friends to our first time eaters--this was a hit.

I had always hesitated making Baklava but braved it this year and following others suggestions to make more sauce was the wrong move. Next time I will only make the amount of sauce recommended even though after soaking up all the extra sauce they were excellent. Time consuming but worth it.

I actually found this baklava dry. I don't know how that could be with the syrup. Also, there just wasn't enough spice, I would definitely recommend increasing the cinnamon and throwing some nutmeg in.

I took into account a lot of suggestions and after reading so many, I have a few of my own.  1) Making 50% more syrup was too much but I managed to salvage the pastry by removing each slice from the pan and putting it into cupcake wrappers immediately (I saved the leftover nut/syrup mix at the bottom of the pan for other uses), 2) it was better the next day because the walnuts had soaked in the syrup, 3) freezing it first before cutting (with a pizza cutter) was a great idea but make sure you cut all the way through. I didn't add sugar to the cinnamon and nuts as there is already a ton of sugar and letting it sit overnight does the trick. I baked at 325 for 50 min rather than 350.  The recipe is inadequate because it doesn't provide nearly enough detail but it has the ingredients right.

Completely time consuming and not particularily "easy", but totally delicious results!  Save this recipe for company... they'll be impressed.

Pretty good stuff!  I like a more Eastern style (Turkey or Lebanon) made with rose water.

Unfortunately these were a big let down. I recently returned from Antalya Turkey, I had Baklava everyday for 2 weeks and they were the best I had ever eaten, I had Baklava in Rhodes Greece 15 years ago which was the first time I tried it, as I had nothing to compare it to I thought they were great, but having made this recipe with phylo bought from the grocery store, I can tell you it is way off what the Turks  use, Turkish Baklava is made with dough alot thinner than phylo evey other country seem to use. "looking through the Turkish dough is like looking through a net curtain" someone said. and it is true, the Baklava there has so many layers of ultra thin phylo, it is almost like puff pastry, with regular phylo you literally feel every layer of pastry as you bite as it is so thick. I know this recipe does not claim to be Turkish, it claims to be Greek, so for that I will give it 2 stars, If you ever get the chance to try Turkish Baklava, I assure you, you will notice the difference, and it is alot better.

I made sure to have every thing ready before inrolling to fillo, nuts , syrup and butter.
Then I did not have to cover the fillo dough just work as fast as possible.
Put about 6 sheets in bottom and 2 every time. Had some nuts left at the end eventhoug I used 3 hipping tablespoons between layers. Should use some more between layers next time.
I did not like, the vanilla flavor of the syrup, it did not taste right  a  baklava. Next time I will use lemon zest or Orange blossom water.
But the overall result was very good.

Once I got past working with the phyllo dough, this baklava tasted just like the baklava I've ordered from Greek restaurants (that's a compliment). Who knew it was so easy to make? Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this recipe about 5 years ago. I make it for Christmas now every year. I do add just a pinch of clove and some sugar to my nut mixture. I also make my syrup before I do anything else. I pour the cold syrup over the hot baklava and it just sucks the syrup right up. I always use the exact ingredients for everything else and everyone has loved it.

This recipe is amazing! I did cool the syrup before I poured it on the baklava, and I added lemon zest to the syrup while It was cooking. It came out perfect!

I have used this recipe a few times and I always get rave reviews. I prepare the sauce and the nuts ahead of time. I double the nuts and cinnamon. Also, like others have suggested I use 1 1/2 of the suggested serving for the sauce. I've discovered that a cup of butter is way too much. I would probably only use half of that. If you use too much butter it gets soggy. If you have everything ready ahead of time I have found you don't need to put anything on the phyllo dough to keep it from drying out because the process goes pretty quickly. I usually use the phyllo dough that comes in two rolls. I leave the second roll in the package until I'm ready for it. Love this recipe!!

The end result is worthy of 5 stars, but since I took other reviewers advice, the recipe as written gets four.  Fabulous base recipe.  I did add a little squeeze of lemon and it's zest and increased syrup by a half, making it in advance so it could cool before pouring it over the hot baklava.  It makes a key difference.  I've made this several times, and everyone who eats it proclaims that it's the best baklava they've ever eaten, anywhere!  Yes,it does take time and care to make, but I consider it a labour of love, especially when I gift whole pans of it to people I care about when they need cheering up!

I have a friend that loves baklava and I decided to take on the challenge for him. After reading the reviews, I made 1.5x the sauce and put it in the fridge to cool while I made the baklava. Some here said they added sugar to the nut and cinnamon mix but I didn't want it to be too sweet so I added just a small amount of brown sugar to it. I got it in the oven at 325 since some reviews said 350 was too high. Once it was golden on top I took it out and poured the cold sauce onto it immediatly. I had made sure to not make my cuts all the way through so the bottom wouldn't get soggy. I let it sit for a bit and then tried a bite. Heaven.  I took some in for my friend and he said it was perfect and that I must be part Greek ;) He isn't one to sugarcoat the truth either, so I trusted him.

The first time I made this, I diligently brushed and brushed and brushed with melted butter.  Second time?  Butter-flavored Pam.  Tasted exactly the same (i.e. INCREDIBLE), and SO much easier.

I also premade the sauce and cooled it before pouring over the hot baklava, and had no problems with sogginess.

This was a hit for Mother's day! There were absolutely no leftovers! Everyone asked me how I made them. The only different I did to the recipe was using Puff Pastry instead of Phyllo Dough, only for the reason that no grocery store around me had any! I had my husband roll the dough to make it thinner and made layers from that. I didn't even use half of the butter called for, probably used 1/4. It was time consuming but the end result was GREAT! :)

So Simple to make, I ground nuts in food processor and did extra syrup which I made and cooled the night before.  I also put the finished product in freezer for ten minutes before making cuts.  Someone actually asked where they could buy this from...was a huge hit..

I was surprised to find out this "Greek" desert was very popular in Afghanistan.  To make it "Afghanistan style", substitue the chopped walnuts with chopped pistachio's, and also add to recipe 1/2t of finely shredded lemon peel.

AMAZING! I followed the directions as stated, except making sure to cut only 3/4 through the baklava before baking. I have made this using all walnuts and a mix of walnuts and pistachios. Although shelling the pistachios is a pain, they make the baklava taste much more authentic and delicious! For the butter, I melt it in a bowl and apply with a pastry brush. I usually make a half recipe in an 8X8 pan, baked for 40 minutes. This is one of my very favorite dessert recipes! Thank you!

Awesome!!  I made 50% more sauce, and they were dripping... but it was sooo good!  Friends said they liked it better this way because they were so much more moist than others they've had.  I used a variety of pecans, almonds, and walnuts.

I love this recipe.  Reduce the temperature to 325 and increase the sauce by 1/2 - otherwise it's perfect.  I always make this for family gatherings because it's one of my grandmothers favorite desserts.

Perfect!  Everyone that had a piece said, "It's so good.  It's like "real" baklava!"  I increased the honey to a cup as another reviewer suggested.  I also trimmed my phyllo to fit my 13X9 pan.  I had butter left over.  Don't increase the butter or it will be soggy.  Just use a light, quick touch when buttering.

My first attempt took forever.  First of all, I burned the nuts when I toasted them ($10 worth), so I had to dash to the store.  Secondly, I was once told (unfortunately) that the size of a pan was determined by measuring the bottom.  So, my first mistake (besides the burnt nuts) was using a pan that was too large.  Consequently, a sheet of phyllo cut in half wasn't large enough to fill the pan.  So, I instead cut it to fit and used the smaller scraps patched together.  This meant that I ran out of phyllo sheets long before I had used all the nut filling.  The dough was dry to begin with, and I didn't have enough of the filling, but the end result, although not pretty, was delicious and loved by all.  Next time, smaller pan, and I'll watch the toasting of the nuts carefully.

Absolutely perfect!  Easy to make (time consuming, but not difficult).  We used a mixture of pistachios, almonds and walnuts.  Made it for the first time on Easter and our friends LOVED it!

I was skeptical about pouring the liquid on, but after it came out of the oven so dry I knew it would work.  It was great!  Thanks

Wow! This recipe is really good!! I make this all the time now and it's the only baklava recipe I use. I make this mainly during Christmas time, so I use chopped pecans and walnuts as the chopped nuts. I don't like pistachios, but I'm sure that they would be really good in this recipe too!

I made this for the first time yesterday to share with friends at a slide show of my recent trip to the Holy Land. It was a huge and dazzling success. People asked me where I had bought them.

I searched long and hard for a recipe that sounded right also successful adaptations. I followed this recipe, but made 1.5 times the syrup. I used a mixture of pecans and pistachios (hate walnuts). Since I used a 1-lb. pkg of phyllo in two plastic wrapped portions, I used one at a time and didn't need the damp cloth over them, just a covering of wax paper which didn't stick. The only difficulty I had was when cutting them before baking, the top layer wanted to lift off, so I had to use care. After baking, I realized the pieces were way too big, so I cut each in half and it was very easy to do, so I'm thinking I can do some/all of the cutting after baking next time. I cooled the syrup and poured on the baklava straight from the oven. No sogginess, just decadent crispy wonderfulness. It cost about $15 and is time intensive, but really not difficult. I was a heroine!!

My filo sheets were already cut to fit perfectly so I did not get the cutting them in 1/2 part. I added some chocolate frosting that I had about 1/4 left of in tub to middle layer of sheets in pan after melting. I did not follow the recipe exactly just kind of guessed without measuring (which I do not usually do, but felt like it yesterday)but still was good, not perfect like if you sold it, but really hard to mess up something with which contains these ingredients unless you leave it in the oven to burn-of which I didn't.

Tried this for the first time today. Took a couple other posters advice about adding sugar to the nuts and 1.5 X the syrup. It has a great flavor but is a little soggy. Of course, it may have been less soggy if my hubby and I hadn't been so anxious to try it. I will definitely make this again. I think experience will help me get the amount of syrup right. I also cooled the syrup in the fridge while I assembled and baked it. 

I have never used Phyllo before and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to handle. I am also lucky to have ample counter space next to my stove and just placed a saucepan on low on a burner and placed the baking pan right next to it. Only took about 10 minutes to layer the pastry and nuts. 40 minutes was adequate time to bake it.

I have never made baklava before and I had never tasted baklava before. I wanted to make a Greek style dessert to go along with the Greek style dinner I was making for my family. I came upon this recipe and I gave it a try. It was surprisingly simple and the result was a phenomenal dessert that everyone enjoyed. I followed the recipe, using 1 lb of walnuts and a few pistachios. I cut down a bit on the butter, but other than that it was just perfect. Delicious!

I made this over the holiday season to bring into work as well as for my family and it was a hit.  I absolutely love baklava but was always afraid to make it myself but am glad I finally gave it a shot.  I followed some others' tips and made the sauce first and I also put in a stick of cinnamon as it simmered.  This was super easy and I will definitely be making it again in the future.

I love baklava and this recipe won't dissapoint.  I was skeptical about it being freezable, but I tried it and it came out great.  Will start baking for the holidays early next year and store in the freezer!

Believe the hype.  This was my first attempt at baklava and it might be the best I've ever had.  It's also conducive to making adjustments as you go along.  I did find that I needed 1 1/2 times the sauce, and also more nut mixture, since I used 3 Tbsp (ok more like 3 "heaping" Tbsp LOL) per layer.  Both were no big deal to throw together, just keep your dough covered with plastic & a damp towel so it stays pliable.  I think if you use 3 Tbsp per layer you will need about 25% more nut mixture than the recipe calls for.  The cinnamon tastes beautiful, the layers are crispy and the filling is juicy.  Love it, love it, love it!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

A little disappointed beause I had high expectations for this recipe. For the amount of work put into this, it turned out to be just okay and it didn't taste authentic. Also, for someone like me who always felt intimidated by the thought of making baklava, the instructions were a bit off and it made me a little frustrated. Every little detail really mattered to me but I still managed even though it took me awhile to finish.  I did not cut the dough to make it fit, instead, I just laid it then fold it over so that you have 2 layers. Someone also mentioned to butter every other dough but I had lightly buttered every single one. If I decide to make this again, I will probably do a pistachio/walnut mix and try to find a better syrup.

This was excellent!  My daughters ages 11 and 13 helped me put this together for Thanksgiving.  My mom and other family members were doing the traditional desserts so we decided to do something a little different and bring this Baklava.  I have always loved Baklava but had never made it.  It was not only delicious but was a lot of fun for our girls to make.  We took the great idea of melting the butter and spraying it onto the phyllo and that worked out wonderfully.  However, we didn't use all the butter the recipe called for.  We will make this again.

Very good recipe and soo easy! I didn't double the syrup recipe and wish I had since I have a sweet tooth. I was afraid that it would have been too soggy, but it turned out great. I used pecans, walnuts, and hazelnuts.

I found the recipe instructions confusing. I didn't have to cut my phyllo in half. I used whole pieces which fit the pan perfectly. Also, the butter needs to be fully melted to liquid. A butter brush is needed. I didn't realize that you only butter every other pastry sheet and I buttered every one by mistake. There are 40 sheets per standard box of phyllo dough.  You should retain the waxy paper that comes in the package to layer between the damp towel and the phyllo stack. My baklava came out too soggy (too much butter?) and the tops curled up. But overall not too bad.

Oh my goodness, this was sooooo delicious I did not a few things different. I only used half the dough and walnuts. But the used to full recipe for the sauce. Also, I cooked the baklava for 30 minutes at 325 then added half of the sauce and then I put it back in the oven for 20 more minutes and put the rest of the sauce on when it came out. It was toooooooooooooo delicious!!! Will def be making this again :-)

Another 5 star rating for a 5 star recipe.  I stuck with the other reader tip to cut the baklava only partway to the bottom and I always pour cooled syrup over hot baklava.  I've had picky Baklava people tell me this is incredible.  It's never soggy, nice and crisp and chewy at the same time.

So good!  I made a rookie mistake when grinding the nuts though - I put whole almonds, pistachios and pecans into the food processor along with walnut "crumbs" (small pieces) and started to pulse away - well because the walnuts were so much smaller than everything else, if I had kept going, I would have ended up with walnut powder.  So in the end, my nuts were not as finely chopped as I would have liked. For the layering, I did 10 sheets of phyllo then 1/3 of the nuts, 6 sheets, another 1/3rd nuts, 6 sheets, last 1/3rd and then topped with 9 sheets of phyllo.  The nut mixture was good, but I felt there was too much cinnamon, so I will reduce next time (I also added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp allspice to nuts). For the sauce, I made 1 1/2 times the amount and added about a 2" strip of orange rind.  I think it might be too much sauce, but the jury is still out on that. The only other thing I will change next time is to press down on everything before baking as my top layer of phyllo didn't seem to stick to the last layer of nuts.  Once the baklava was out of the oven, I poured the cooled sauce over everything and topped each piece with a pinch of finely ground pistachios for that 'authentic' look.  The end result was fantastic - we can't stop eating them!

This recipe is so easy to make and is always delicious.  I add a little more cinnamon and a bit of grated lemon zest to the nut filling -- yum!  Whenever I make this, people think I am an absolute GENIUS -- I always hate to burst their bubbles and tell them how easy it is!

If I could give more stars, I would. My grandmother, who is one of the best cooks ever, said she LOVED (not liked, loved) these.  Above and beyond anything else I can say about this recipe, that is probably the greatest compliment. Took this to an EID potluck tonight, and everyone raved about it.  Someone even compared them to the Baklava sold at a middle eastern bakery in Chicago famous for their Baklava.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This recipe was fantastic! You cant help but snack on these so they go pretty quick. I found that it was a little "over nutty" for my taste so the second time I made these, I cut the nuts in half and it was just perfect! It was great, just as good, if not better than the restaurants!! Thanks for sharing :)

This was very good and waaay simpler than I ever expected. Only had to use half of a phyllo dough box and it was plenty of sheets. Next time, I would make the amount of syrup called for, I increased it by a half this time and it was too much. Chill the syrup and put it on in waves so it doesn't all seep to the bottom. I would use more nuts next time. I also added some cardamom and lemon zest. Boil cloves and cardamom with the sugar syrup. Only need 1 stick of butter.

I followed this to the T and it didn't work out well at all for me.  The phyllo dried out in the oven even after I buttered it.  Had to use melted butter because it's impossible to butter PHYLLO!  I would not use this recipe ever again.

So Delicious! I used chopped almonds and pecans. The only thing I would change next time is to do as one reviewer mentioned and NOT cut all the way through before baking. I found the bottom a little too wet.

This was a great recipe.  I made a small alteration.  When making the syrup I used 3/4 cups water, 1 cup sugar, and 1 1/4 cups of honey.  It turned out to be the perfect amount with the perfect flavor.

I was nervous to work with the phyllo dough, but it was easier than I expected. I used walnuts and actually substituted the butter with Earth Balance buttery spread to keep it non-dairy and cut back on fat. My BF couldn't keep his hands off! I would suggest doing a larger layer of phyllo on the bottom to make it more stable. I would also suggest doing less layers with more sheets in between. Definitely chill the sauce and don't cut all the way to the bottom before baking. Also, I found a serrated knife helped for a clean cut.

This recipe tastes pretty good if you eat it right away.  Unfortunately, after it's refrigerated for about an hour, the sugar/honey/vanilla syrup that you pour over the baklava hardens to the point where you literally can't get the baklava out of the casserole.

I was very pleased with the result here. I did not need 16 oz; I could only squeeze a little more than half that much into my 9x13, but maybe I used too many nuts. They are the best part after all! I did not modify the honey syrup at all, & glad I didn't, I despise wet baklava. I used parchment paper to mold my baklava into my pan so that I could later remove the entire thing to serve and that worked well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made as written and although it seemed too dry at first, after storing in the freezer it comes out as perfect as any I've ever had. I think it just needs time to "meld". Also, the top layers need a little buttering, too, to keep them from curling. I cut it into squares before baking, then cut those in half after baking to form the triangles that fit better into the muffin papers. I stacked those in a plastic container which I put in the freezer - it never actually "freezes" because of the butter/sugar content. I take out a little as I need it and it's ready to serve in no time! (yes, I take out a piece once in a while and microwave for 10 seconds - heaven!)Thank you to those who pointed out that you should cut almost to the bottom but not all the way!

Absolutely wonderful. My husband and I recently went to a Greek restaurant and had some baklava and upon finishing it wanted more, so I decided to make my own. It was time consuming but fabulous. I only used 1 package of the 16 oz phyllo dough, and did not have to cut in half to fit my 9 x 13" pan. As stated in the recipe, after baking we added the sauce, but I reserved some sauce and added the remainder the next day before serving. This went over wonderfully with baklava lovers as well as those who had never heard of it. Very easy recipe, just time consuming.

This recipe got rave reviews at 2 holiday parties and from family and friends. It is the best! I only used one roll out of the 16 oz. phyllo box. I did not cut the dough in half. I unrolled the dough, put it on a cookie sheet, covered it with a piece of saran wrap and a wet hand towel. I recovered the dough each time I took out a sheet. I used whole sheets of phyllo and put them into my 13x9 glass baking dish. The sheets were a little large, but I just buttered and pushed them down a bit and it worked fine. At first, the butter was hard to spread and the phyllo tore. I put the butter in a small mixing bowl in the microwave and made it creamy (but not liquid), then used a pastry brush to really slop it onto the phyllo. Bottom layer was 2 sheets, in between were 1 sheet layers each buttered individually, and the top was 8 sheets. Each layer also got 3-4 T of chopped walnut mixture. The SECRET to this recipe is buttering and topping every single sheet and using a quality honey. (I bought my honey from a local bee keeper. at the farm market.)  Other than procedure, I didn't change a thing in this recipe. The sauce and everything is perfect as is. This recipe will be a Christmas Eve tradition from now on. Enjoy it with authentic Espresso or cappucino, and it's even more phenomenal. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. This is a keeper-- and now that I'm done with my review, I have to give 9 other people the recipe who asked me for it!

Got to give it 5 stars! Never know how easy it is to make a perfect Baklava. Now I don't even glance at those pre-packed Baklava in the store since I can make the best. Family been asked for more. I followed the recipes but did take the suggestion- have the honey glaze made first and let enough time to cool down and then pour on the hot just out of oven baklava. Turned out perfect and crispy!

I made this a few weeks ago for some Romanian friends who came to visit. I used sandra lee's suggestions of "draping the bottom half over the pan and then folding the top half over it, "painting" a thin layer of butter quickly," (it made it so easy!) and "cut to within a half inch FROM the bottom of the pan." After it cooled, it was a little tough to cut through with my only sharp utility knife, and I wasn't sure if I had spread enough butter on each layer, as the top didn't seem to stick as well as I had expected, but the final verdict was an "A+". Thanks so much NEONWILLIE for such a great recipe!

outstanding recipe! i used a mix of nuts, not knowing which would be best. got RAVE reviews from everyone who tried it, and even some bribes to make more! when cutting before baking, don't cut all the way to the bottom. leave about half an inch to an inch uncut, and finish cutting after adding the sauce and letting it cool.

This is the best dessert I have ever made.  Everything about it, from the phyllo to the honey sauce, is so delicate.  I used almonds and ground them almost to a powder.  I also made one and a half times the sauce.  This is good beyond words.

This is a great recipe!.  To make it even easier though, my grandmoter taught me to use two pieces of philo dough on the bottom, butter the top of the two, then two more buttered on the top one and then put a nice amount of nuts on one end of the philo dough and roll it up from that end.  It's quick, it's easy and you don't have to butter each individual sheet.  She brushes the top of the roll with butter once its rolled and then places in a lined cookie sheet with the rolls all next to eachother, cut and bake same amount of time.  Because it's rolled it doesn't fall apart as easily, easier to hold.

I have been cooking for over five decades and hubby and I are former restaurant owners (I made the pastries, etc.), and used this recipe for the first time a few days ago. The next day, we brought it to a party filled with foodies and world travellers. It was the absolute hit of the party, and I have never heard as many compliments on a dish as I did that night. I followed the directions and some tips from readers, made the sauce ahead of time and chilled it (doubled sauce recipe and used leftover to pour at table), and used walnuts which I chopped medium-fine in my Cuisinart. The only tricky part is buttering the layers - must be done with a light touch to prevent them from shifting and/or tearing. It really helped to have hubby remove the defrosted phyllo sheets from the package as we worked, lay them in the pan, and I followed up with spreading the butter and sprinkling the nuts. Team work! Living here in Florida, I used orange-blossom honey, which added a pleasant touch. We have a convection oven, but I still used 350 degrees and checked after 20, 30, and about 40 minutes.  This recipe went in front of my "Desserts" file, to be made many times in the future. Thanks, original poster and tipsters!

Time consuming to make, but delicious!  The only thing I would suggest is melting the butter first. Thanks for sharing! :)

Incredible! I had never made baklava before and with this recipe it was not hard and the outcome was delicious! Shared my creation with some friends, and they all loved it as well! What a tasty treat!

This is a great dessert! I use a recipe for baklava from Egyptian cuisine. I use walnuts, sugar, butter and cinnamon for the filling. You may no use honey in the syrup. Greek-style baklava uses honey, but more typical Arabic baklava doesn`t. Pour hot syrup over cool baklava or cool syrup over hot baklava.

I can't make this recipe too often because I'll eat the whole pan and blow up like Violet in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Incredibly delicious and also easy to put together.  Great way to impress dinner guests.

Don't use the full "sauce" recipe.  Cut the sauce in half; otherwise it will be way too sweet.

Even I couldn't believe I had made this it was so good! My husband stops at a middle eastern resturant and buys dessert for the family once in a while. He said this was better. I did as others suggested and cooked the syrup first and let it completely cool and then poured it over the baklava while it was still hot. I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to the nut mixture. When I made the syrup I reduced the water to 1/2 cup and increased the honey to 1 cup. I used all pecans next time I think I will use a mix of pecans, walnuts and pistachios just for fun. Thanks for a great recipe!

the recipe itself is good, although the actual baking instructions are incredibly unclear. So for  those people who didn't understand, you are supposed to stack 4 layers of 2 sheets of dough, with a coating of butter in between. There will be 3 sections. Each section is comprised of 4 layers. The 2nd section, the one in the middle, will be made up of the same 4 layers, but add the nut mixture along with the butter that separates the layers. Then add your 3rd section, of 4 layers. I wish I had realized this before I messed up the first batch. But the actual recipe is great.

This was great!! I followed some of the other reviewers tips. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. My mother in law bought some at a middle eastern bakery & told me mine was better! The advice about the 1 1/2 times the sauce is perfect. I did add a little more cinnamon, my husband's personal preference. Also I followed the advice about using a spray bottle for the butter. That was so easy! I placed all of the dough over the edge of the pan & covered it as I was using it. That was a really handy tip. For my first time it only took my about 20 minutes to put together. Follow the tip about putting hot sauce on cooled baklava ( or vice versa). And only cutting the baklava to within 1/2 inch from bottom when you bake it mine wasn't soggy at all. I will defiantly be making this again!!

Loved this recipe! You definetly want to make more sauce than called for (I doubled the recipe). Also, I used walnuts - which were great, however I would definetly roast or sautee them before hand next time. Finally... make sure to make the sauce BEFORE hand and let it cool... will keep the baklava from getting soggy!

I made this following the recipe and some of the suggested tweaks by reviewers.  I did 1 1/2x the sauce, and made the sauce ahead so it was chilled before pouring on the baked baklava, which was a good suggestion.  2 things to mention:  of the 16 oz. of finely chopped nuts (pecans) I prepared, by following the recipe and adding 3 T. to each layer, I ended up with 6 oz. of nuts leftover.  So if you want it really nutty, do 4-5 T. or just buy about 10 oz. (what I will do when I make this again).  Also, I followed someone's suggestion and poured my melted butter into a sprayer (emptied out I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter) to "spritz" the phyllo dough with.  I thought I spritzed pretty generously, and the baklava came out well, but again I had a lot of leftover melted butter... probably 1/2 of what I started with.  So if you spritz, you can use less butter with a good result.  All in all, a very yummy recipe.  Have fun!

This recipe is so easy for a first timer, and the phyllo dough was not as hard to work with as I thought it was going to be. I did take some of the other reviewer's suggestions like keeping the dough covered with plastic wrap while working and making the sauce ahead of time. Next time I will try the tip of someone who suggested using a butter spray bottle instead of a brush to butter the dough. I tried to use butter sparingly in each layer, but it still came out a little moist at the bottom. I would suggest making it the day before needed and leaving it uncovered on the counter overnight. Keeps it crisp and flavorful. This was a real hit with my company.

This was my first time making baklava and I took it to a big party.  At least 5 people said it was the best baklava they'd ever had, and I got soooo many comliments.  Awesome recipe! 

P.S.  I used melted butter and a brush.

This baklava recipe is wonderful. I have never made baklava before, and I wanted to make it for a friend in the hospital that was just diagnosed with leukemia. I hope this helps to cheer her up, because I couldn't stop eating it! It was a little hard to get the phyllo to co-operate, but you get the hang of it. I also had this sitting in the fridge for several days, and it was still great. Oh, I also had to use about 2 Tbsp more butter than the recipe called for. I'm known with my friends for making some yummy desserts, and I had several people tell me this was the best I've ever made. I would love to make it more often, but the caloric content is scary! I cut my 9/13 into 24 pieces, and each piece had 300 c*%$#@*s. IT WAS GREAT

I've never tasted Baklava before and I just had to try making it. I couldn't find any Phyllo Dough so I used "Substitute Phyllo Dough" off AllRecipes. Will try to make again with the Phyllo Dough next time.

This was my first time ever making Baklava and it turned out fantastic!!!! I used 1/2 lb of walnuts and 1/2 lb of almonds (shredded and chopped). I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the honey mixture to give it a bit more "nut" flavor.  Will make again...and again.

This is excellent baklava, and I am a HUGE baklava fan, this certainly satisfied. I did as the other reviews suggested and made the sauce first, also added some lemon zest to the sauce for some zip and to cut the sickening sweet you can sometimes get with baklava. I doubled the sauce because I like it really drenched in it, but made it the night before we had it so it had 24 hours for the pasty layers to soak it up, it was divine!

This is by far the best tasting baklava I have ever had!  It was not overly sweet and nearly tasted like apple pie from the cinnamon.  The top layers were crisp as well as the bottom layer.
Very easy recipe to follow for the novice baker, and the advice given by other reviewers was very helpful. 
I made the sauce and the nut mixture 1 day in advance; fortunately, the phyllo dough I had purchased was already cut into sheets, so assembly was quick.  Instead of brushing the melted butter onto the sheets, I dabbed it.  But, I would cut the baklava into shapes BEFORE adding the melted butter to the very top layer, otherwise it will rip easily during the cutting.  I also made 1-1/2 of the sauce recipe and it was just right!  That idea came from another reviewer.  Only pre-cut the shapes 3/4 of the way (another reviewer tip).  So, my only advice is to read the recipe and reviewer comments carefully, taking notes, before you begin.

I followed other's advice and made the bottom layer a bit thicker as well as the top layer.   I ended up using 1 1/2 sticks butter and 1.5 X the sauce.   It turned out wonderful!  My family was so impressed!  Definately a keeper!

I have only had Baklava once before, but I loved it. I made this recipie and it turned out EXCELLENT. I didn't have to bake it for 50 minutes though, took about 35, then it was done. I plan on making this again. I am in love with it. Thanks so much!

Great baklava, but I made the mistake of serving it immediately after making it, so some of the layers didn't stay together. It held its form much better the next day.

Fantastic! I would sprinkle a little bit more than 3 Tablespoons of the nuts for the nut layers, because I ran out of phyllo dough before I ran out of the nuts. This was so good that I won't ever buy baklava again!

The recipe is awesome! It was easy to make and came out delicious. But, anyway I want to add two things. First, baklava is a traditional Ottoman dessert, and everyone should taste it in Turkey. Additionally, making the filling with pistachio instead of walnut can be a different tasteful experience for this recipe.

This is a favourite among my family and friends and I get requests for it all the time.  Thanks Donna for sharing a great recipe!
I usually increase the amount of syrup by 1.5 times.

This is an awesome recipe, and very easy to assemble. My phyllo sheets came 18 to a box, so I allocated the bottom, top, and middle layers accordingly (i.e.count sheets and plan ahead for the correct amount of filling--I used pecans--for each layer). My husband, who is a baklava nut, thought this was the best he'd ever had, even considering the professionally made ones!

My husband is Greek so I was extremely nervous to make this and have it not turn out as good as his mother's but it came out even better! The recipe has just the right amount of sweetness and the phyllo was crisp and delicious.

After reading several reviews...I followed these helpful suggestions to make this baklava the closest to the consistency that I like.  1.  I ground the nuts as fine as I could--very, very fine.  2.  Made the syrup up earlier and let cool completely & then poured the cooled syrup onto hot baklava.  3.  Did not over use the butter, tried to very lightly cover each sheet.  I did use clarified butter a.k.a. Ghee--it allows for cooking with butter at a higher heat.  This recipe will be a Christmas cookie staple from now on!

This was my first attempt at making baklava and it the result was absolutely divine! It wasn't nearly as time-consuming as I thought it might be. I took the advice of others and made the sauce ahead of time, so that it would have time to cool. I'll be making this to take to my sister's for Thanksgiving now! Thanks Donna! This is an excellent recipe!

Truly enjoyed this as did my coworkers.  Purchased bagged nuts already chopped.  Used walnuts and pecans.  Added 1t. almond extract to the sauce in addition to 1 1/2 t. of finely scraped orange rind.  Like other reviewers suggested made sauce first(50% more as suggested) and then cooled sauce before it was poured onto the baklava.  Also used 3 sticks of butter instead of two and doubled the cinnamon. Most of those who ate it told me that it was the best they've had.  Yum delicious!!!!

Wonderful! I've made this recipe at least 5 times now, tweaking it here and there. I find that using a mixture of ground pecans, walnuts and almonds works best (all of one nut seems too potent). I also only used 3/4 of the sauce and find that it is more than enough. Everyone who has tried it loves it!

Simply delicious (especially for my first time making it)!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the sauce first so that it was nicely cooled before pouring over the pastry.  It came out nice and crispy.  Friends and family loved it.  I will definitely make again!

This recipe is great.I used raw almonds and dried cranberries. I did follow the suggestion of making the sauce ahead of time and letting it cool and then ladled it over the baklava when it came out of the oven. I did let the phyllo defrost in the fridge over night and let it get to room temp prior to assembly. Use the moist towel over the plastic wrap, it will keep it from sticking to the phyllo. I used a pastry brush to apply the butter to the layers and I needed to use 1.5 cups of butter. A keeper!

WOW! What a great easy recipe! I made this for my husband to take to work because a fellow co-worker of his  asked if I knew how to make it (I spoil them with sweets regularly) and everyone loved it. I then took it took work the next day and a fellow employee who went to pastry school said it was the best he'd ever tasted and he doesn't even like baklava. I followed other reviews and 1-1/2'd the honey sauce and I thought that was perfect. I also added a little bit of brown sugar and extra nuts on the second batch and it was wonderful! Thank you for the great recipe

OMG! I used to live in Toronto, and on the "Danforth" they had a string of Greek restaurants where by DH and I used to get Baklava as a treat atleast once a week.  That was 20yrs ago.  Since moving up North, Baklava has become a thing of the past...UNTIL NOW. This recipe is EXACTLY like the authentic Baklava we used to enjoy in Toronto!!! ~ thankyou, thankyou, thankyou...followed to a T and it is wonderful!

Excellent! Putsy, but delicious! Nice balance of nuts with sweetness. First time making baklava--this recipe set me up for success! It did not need entire bake time; closer to 35 minutes. Sprinkled very lightly with cinnamon after adding sauce. Yum! It's a must make recipe!!

I looooove this baklava!  I have a taste for it a lot and this is absolutely the best tasting baklava I've ever eaten.  It's pretty simple to make. I was a little worried my first time, because I've never worked with phyllo dough before, but it turned out fantastic!  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce and used about 1 1/3 stick of butter.  I always make the sauce first and let it cool for a long time.  *For a delicious and exotic twist, I add a pinch of safron to the sauce when I'm simmering it.*  It comes out sooooo good.  This is definately a keeper and it tastes as good as the restaurants/bakeries.

This was nothing short of incredible.  My father grew up in a Greek home and told me mine was as good as his Yiya's (and he is not one to dole out the compliments).  I was always so intimadated but this was a HUGE success.  I think I will make these every Christmas to honor my Greek heritage.  BTW, I also added lemon zest to the sauce--necessary for that Mediterannean flair.

The first time I attempted to make this it turned out awful because I had no basting brush, or cooking spray. The second time I made it, I used cooking spray. It turned out wonderful and got  rave reviews.

Yum! i have used walnuts, or pecans (much more expensive)  the last time i made it i put a zest of a whole orange in the honey sauce and used all pecans.  my whole family loved it.  it is easy, but time consuming.  the hardest part is cutting it.  it always hurts my wrist.  it's worth the pain though!

I added about 1.5t of cinnamon and cardamom, and a healthy dash of lemon juice to the honey syrup, but followed everything else according to directions. The results were delicious...everyone loves this super rich treat.

This Baklava is truly amazing.  My brother, who lives in Manhattan and who is very, VERY discerning when it comes to 'the best' foodwise (having experienced all of the finest restaurants in the world as he likes to remind me)has fallen head-over-heels for his sister's "Best Baklava I've Ever Had!" So much so, that now I know what I can get for Christmas every year for the 'man who has everything' :)

This recipe made great baklava. I followed the recipe as written with one exception—I buttered each sheet of phyllo, not every two. As a result, I used about 1/2 cup more butter. I thought the key to making it wasy was preparation. I started the syrup to cook, then chopped the nuts, followed by melting the butter. Then I dampened the towel and opened the phyllo and started assembly. Excellent results!

This tasted exactly like baklava you would order from a restaurant. My friends were so impressed that I could make it (and it's so easy!). One note - I melted the butter before I brushed in on the layers of phyllo dough because the dough was tearing the other way.

Recipe really very nice. Difficult but very tasty. But Baklava is a Turkish desert and center of this desert GAZIANTEP in Turkey.

We have a Greek festival in our town every year and get unbeatable baklava there.  This recipe is very comparable. I added a bit of honey to the melted butter and brushed it on every layer. I would suggest max 2 layers phyllo between fillings, I did 1 layer. Hubby likes it better that way because his Armenian grandfather made it that way. Also, I sprinkled a tad of ground cloves on top before baking. Baklava is surprisingly easy.

I grew up with Greek parents and I can tell you, this is the best baklava I have ever eaten! There was just the right amount of syrup; not too moist, not too dry.  Perfect!

I used butter spray instead of butter and no one could tell the difference.  This makes nice, high, dense baklava!

I hate to go against the majority, but my family actually did not care for this. Although the nut filling was tasty, the over all, was too sweet.  I would definitely cut down on the amount of sugar and water that is poured on the top in the end.  We ended up tossing this out.  I'm sorry, but this one is not a keeper in our house.

My first attempt at making Baklava and it turned out great! I slightly melted the butter and used a pastry brush to apply it. Also, because the phyllo is so delicate, and because I'm a huge fan of parchment paper, I used a sheet of it to assemble and cut the baklava on before transferring it to a baking pan. Then of course, when the baklava was finished and cooled, I simply lifted the paper out of the pan and was ready to go! Delicious!

I have made many diffrent baklava recipes, and this one is the best I've found.  There are still a few changes I've made:  I use a cinnamon/sugar mixture to toss with the nuts, it makes it more evenly distributed instead of just using cinnamon, which sometimes clumps up.  Also, for the syrup, I omit the vanilla and add 1/2 tsp shredded lemon peel, 2 tbsp. lemon juice, and just a sprinkling of cinnamon.  Authentic, traditional baklava has just a hint of lemon in it.

Wow - this is a great recipe!  It turned out beautifully - not tooth-numbingly sweet or drippy and soggy like other baklava I've had.  I took the advice of reviewers and made the syrup well in advance and allowed it to cool before pouring it over the hot baklava.  I also simmered an extra 10 minutes to get it to the consistency of syrup.  I rolled up the leftover phyllo sheets and sliced the roll into thin shreds and scattered them on top before baking.  I highly recommend this recipe, particularly if you think you don't like baklava!

Excellent!  Used almonds (i find walnuts quite bitter).  I have made this twice and it is very moorish - best to make it for when you have guests over or else you will gain weight very quickly!!  Just 1 thing - you must cut this in slices, tringles or squared BEFOFRE it is baked.  I forgot the last time = a very big pastry pastry mess, but still tasted amazing.  Just not as pretty.

This is by far a 5++++++ recipe--I am impressed! I didn't think this would turn out as good as it did because it looked so simple.  After reading the reviews for this recipe I decided I had to try it....it turned out beautiful and delicious! The only variation I made was that I added about 1 cup of miniature chocolate chips to the nut mixture (I used 8oz of pecans, and 8oz of walnuts). I buttered and crumbled leftover "scraps" of the fillo roll and placed them loosly on top of the Baklava for a decorative touch. I also only baked for only 45-min. Any longer and this would have burned for me. Thank you so much, Donna for sharing this wonderful recipe!

MUCH easier than previous baklava recipes I've used, and every bit as good as what my Greek relatives make!  A tip to make it easier still -- before you cut the baklava, put the pan in the fridge or freezer, as it makes the phyllo easier (or at least neater) to cut.  I used lemon extract instead of lemon zest in the syrup, and it worked well.  I also agreed with the reviewer who said you'd need to use more than a few tablespoons of nuts in each layer; I think I probably used about 1/4 cup of nuts (the traditional Greek way is to use walnuts) in each layer.  Great stuff!

Exactly like I like them, and so easy to bake!!! I used a mix of 1/2 pistachio and 1/2 walnut. Next time, I may increase the amount of pistachio and/or almonds.

For those having difficulty with the phyllo/fillo: Put the dough down on the counter, then put a sheet of plastic wrap on top of that, and THEN the damp cloth. Keeps the dough from drying out, and also keeps the top layer from getting gummy. This recipe was so easy to make - I'm making more tonight! I, too, doubled the sauce and let it cool before pouring it over the hot baklava. Also, I poured it about 1/3 at a time, let it soak in, poured some more, let it soak in, etc. Seemed to work well. Mmmm!

I have to say I did like it.  I used chopped almonds only but next time I think I will add pistachios as well.  My biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce.  We like our Baklava really saucy so next time I think I'll double the sauce.

this is an amazing recipe! ive made this at least four times and from the very first time, it came out perfectly. its gotten me countless compliments and a great unique dessert i can bring to parties. i usually cut it into diamonds and serve in muffin liners. to keep the baklava from getting too soggy, it helps to let it cool and spoon the sauce over right before you serve it

I do a lot of cycling, and it's hard to find high calorie foods that are light on the stomach.  This recipe tastes so good the people at work will be amazed, but it still packs enough protien and calories to compete with PowerBars.  Thanks Donna!

Awesome and sooo EASY.  I had a Greek theme night and no body could believe I made it.  (and I am known to be a good baker).  I doubled the sauce like others said, and it still was not as soggy as I have seen before.  Definetly make sauce ahead and allow to cool before pouring over the cooked baklava.  It makes it distribute evenly.

This recipe is great! My grandmother used to make Baklava when I was a kid, and it brought back wonderful memories to make it myself. I've always been told that it's difficult to make, but by the 3rd pan, I didn't even need the recipe anymore, and it comes out great every time.

Excellent!! This came out better than the baklava I have purchased in bakeries. It was actually quite easy to make, yet everyone to whom I served it was so impressed with it.  I found that covering the phyllo dough with wet towels was not necessary as long as I worked fairly quickly. This is now one of my all-time favorites. Thank you for sharing it Donna!

Excellent! Fabulous! Stupendous! I am not much of a "measurer", but I would say I used more than 1 tsp of cinnamon. Make this for dinner parties/entertaining--it is easy, yet impressive and exotic. Donna's Greek friend sure got the short end of the stick--this is a million times better than apple pie!

I decided to have some friends over for opening ceremonies of the olympics, and planned on making a Greek dinner.  I had hoped that my local bakery made baklava, but they didn't.  I had to throw this together last minute (which was pretty easy to do).  It recieved nothing but raves.  My husband didn't even get to taste it.  I guess I have another excuse to make it.  Next time I might add 1/2 t. of ground cloves to nut mixture.

I made this baklava for my husband for Valentine's Day. It was the first time I had ever tried it. I was very impressed with the results. It's too sweet for my taste but my husband really loved it. Usually a recipe has to have chocolate to be loved by him. He said the only thing better than this dessert was "me".

I tried this and it is wonderful. I love Baklava and this is the best that I have eaten. I only used 8 ounces of the dough, but left everything else the same amounts, just put more of the nut/cinnamon mixture in each layer.

This is a great and easy recipe, however, I would suggest having all of your ingredients ready before opening the filo dough because it dries and becomes impossible to work with in only minutes.

Wow!  For 4 or 5 years my husband has been talking about the incredible pistachio baklava he had at a Greek restraunt in Detroit.  He just turned 30 & I wanted to surprise him with something special... it worked!  It turned out wonderful!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

We make this every year at Passover.  Here are some tips we use to make them light and crispy:
*Not too much butter on each sheet, just paint a thin layer of butter
*when cutting don't cut thru all layers, just cut thru up to 1/4 inch from bottom layer, that way the sauce stays in the baklava and doesn't end up in the bottom of the pan
*we make one and half of the sauce recipe
*make sauce ahead and place in fridge to cool.  When you pour cool sauce on warm baklava it turns out crispy
*reduce 1 cup of water to 1/2
*increase 1/2 cup honey to 1 cup
*add 1/2 cup of sugar into nut mixture

Excellent, have made several times. Make sure you allow the sugar honey mixture to simmer for at least 20 minutes, will thicken after it cools off in the actual pastry,  and that's what you want.

Never made baklava before so I tried this a couple of days ago and was a big hit. I did 1.5 batch of the syrup as suggested. I found I needed 2 packets of antoniou fillo pastry (I had lots of wastage from cutting around the edge to fit my pan). I bought raw mixed nuts and roasted them for about 10 minutes , tossing them half way through. It did take me about an hour to construct but the layering was easy to do and somewhat therapeutic :)
I rate the success of this recipe on my Greek born father who absolutely loved it so to me it's a keeper :)

I love this recipe! My 15 year old son just helped me make it and it is so wonderful. We melted our butter for easier spreading. I would like to try putting butter in a spray bottle for an easier coverage. I would recommend anyone to try this recipe even if you are a beginner. The phyllo package recommends to cover it with a damp cloth to prevent drying out but I do not recommend that it made my sheets stick together. I hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I have!Nicole Wineland

This is the BEST baklava EVER. The ones I've purchased at Middle Eastern bakeries do not use butter and that's what makes baklava rich and flavorful and tasty. It's better with butter.

FABULOUSLY EASY...just a couple things, i melted the butter and put it in a spray bottle which was much quicker and easier plus i used half the butter. second i add a tsp of cocoa to my nut mixture i find it adds a bit more body to the taste i love it..make your syrop first and put it in the fridge to get cold before you port it on the hot baklava that way it doesn't get soggy..

Awesome, so easy my eleven year old can make it on her own! We use a sponge instead of a brush to spread the butter. After baking we place the cut pieces on a wire rack and drizzle the syrup.

Excellent recipe. Everyone thought it was better than any other baklava they've ever tried. I did follow another reviewer's comment and only cut the baklava about 3/4 of the way down so that when I poured the syrup, it stayed in the cake rather than going only to the bottom of the pan.

I made this last night for the first time.  I had never worked with phyllo dough before.  That was the tricky part.  I thought I had royally messed things up.  The baklava is absolutely wonderful.  I added just a little more then the recommended amount of cinnamon.  I'm making this again tomorrow!

GREAT Baklava recipe! I followed the other reviewers advice and made the sauce first and let it cool while prep & baking the baklava. I also used a combo of walnuts and pistachios. So simple & delicious! I can't wait to make it again!

Someone better hide these from mama! Mama being me! Delicious, although next time I think I'll add a little punch to the nuts with nutmeg and cinnamon. Also, I added a few squirts of lemon juice to the sauce. Thank you!!!

Love Love Love this. This has become one of my Christmas treat staples. Everyone loves it/says its the best they've had. And they think its super fancy. Followed the directions given and used walnuts for the filling. This also freezes well at least for a while. I usually make it a few days before everything else. It tastes awesome slightly frozen! yum!

This baklava was amazing! It was delicious and easy to make. I followed some tips found in other reviews, and I also did 2 1/2 times the amount of cinnamon called for and think it was a good amount of cinnamon.

I found this recipe was VERY easy to make.  I used a spray bottle for applying the butter to the Phylo layers and this made it a breeze to assemble.  Great recipe as is!

I just made this tonight and it tasted amazing! I followed some tips from other reviewers and increased the sauce by one half. I WOULD suggest making the layers 3-4 peices of phyllo dough thick instead of 2 as (for mine anyway) they sort of disappeared. (Either that or I used to much butter!) All the same, right now every piece is tucked away safely in giftboxes ready for distrabution tomorrow and I'm sure it will be loved!

I always thought Baklava would be so difficult to make but I was pleasanly suprised at how simple this was. I made it for my co-workers and it was gone byt the end of the day. They all loved it!! I did half pistachios and half pecans and added a pinch of cardamom to the nut mixture. I also added a few drops of lemon juice and about a teaspoon of rose water to the honey mixture. It made the taste wonderful!! The first batch I did got a little too done so I reduced the time for the second and they came out prefect!!

This is the first time I have made Baklava; second time that I have used phyllo dough.  Not very difficult at all!  I did mess up right from the start: added sugar to the nuts.  It was not until I started to make the syrup mixture when I realized this.  So I improvised on the syrup mixture.  Just pulled it from the oven, it looks and smells awesome; poured the improvised syrup all over and cannot wait to taste!

Very good recipe! I always try to follow the recipe exact, but this time I did change the 1 c. water to 1/2c. and the honey to 1c. other than that no changes wer made. I had no problem making this, and I will make this again very soon.

Wonderful Baklava. I would suggest using the phyllo dough pretty soon after buying, but other than being difficult to work with it still tasted great!

Study the photo, because that is "exactly" what these will turn out looking like.  I thought they would show more defined layers, instead they blend together, just like the photo.  My husband "loved" them and after all I made them for him, so he is all that mattered.  I also substituted "Brown Rice" syrup instead of Honey; my husband didn't want to part with his honey; he prefers it on his biscuits.

Made this for the Thanksgiving dessert table and it was a big hit.  This was my first try at it and it was easy.  Next time I will make the nuts chopped finer.  Then made it and substituted with poppyseed.  It was also very easy and delicious!

Our first attempt at baklava - success!  We made the recipe exactly as written, but made one and a half times the syrup based on other reviews.  We ended up only using the amount of one recipe and I think that was plenty for syrup - neither of us felt like it needed more.  I will use this recipe again, as written, maybe just experiment with nut combinations.  We had amazing pistachio baklava in Amsterdam and I am interested in trying that in this recipe next time!

This turned out great and was MUCH easier than I thought it would be.  I would probably add more of the liquid but that is a personal preference for it to be a little sweeter.  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfection!!  I have to admit that, after reading reviews, I was pretty nervous about making this recipe.  But it really wasn't bad!  Tedious, but kind of fun!  I eased up on the nuts (walnuts, almonds and pecans) a bit and I would recommend dabbing the dough with butter (not using too much).  And add cool syrup to hot baklava or vise-versa.  Yum yum yum!!

Wow, absolutely amazing. Smelled delicious baking and turned out perfectly. Mine didn't need the full 50 minutes. The top was already brown after a half hour, so I covered it with tinfoil so it wouldn't burn.  Just a great recipe. I'm going to make it again and again.

Didn't use anywhere near the whole cup of butter, but other than that it was perfect. I like it even better than those I usually get in restaurants, which tend to be super heavy and compacted in the bottom few layers.  The layers in this manage all retain their light, crispy integrity. Followed other reviewer suggestions: cool sauce on hot baklava or hot sauce on cool baklava, and didn't cut all the way to the bottom before cooking.

This was the first time I've made Baklava, and it was easy and wonderful!  Don't be afraid of using the phyllo dough.  As long as you keep a damp towel over it and use MELTED butter to brush it with, it is easy to work with. To keep the syrup from pooling on the bottom, some have recommended not cutting all the way through, but you will find it difficult to cut once it is baked and very flaky.  The key to adding the syrup is to allow it to cool and thicken, and be sure to pour it on the Baklava as soon as it comes out of the oven.  The hot pan makes the syrup cook into the Baklava and keeps it from pooling in the bottom of the pan.   I used Walnuts and added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the nuts. Try this recipe! You'll love it.

Just made this past weekend and it was a big hit. Our dinner guests couldn't believe I made it and it was delicious. I made 1.5X of the syrup ahead of time according to others' recommendations. Next time I think I'll try to reduce the amount to what the recipe says.

This is AWESOME! MELT THE BUTTER TO SPREAD IT!!! Very easy! I followed the recipe exactly. Read carefully to get the idea of how it works. 2 pieces, butter, 2 pieces, butter, 2 pieces, butter, etc. Then nuts,2 pieces, butter,nuts, etc. I used the whole box of Phyllo and shelled and chopped 1 lb. of pecans.  DELICIOUS!!

These were amazing!!! I ate two and wanted more :) Make sure you spread the butter to the outside edges and cut only about 3/4s of the way down so that the sauce doesn't pool on the bottom (another reviewer gave me that idea). I've had these in the Middle East, and this recipie is just as good.

THE BEST BAKLAVA RECIPE EVER!~ AS IS! Don't fret on the buttering of the sheets to much, use a pastry brush and do it fast and sloppy. Try using combinations of nuts for a variety. Walnuts & Pecans, Almonds all work well separate or together. I cannot keep this in the house for more than 1 day!

Awesome!  Used fat-free spray butter to cut the fat - still turned out tasty and delicious.  The second time I made it I  increased the sauce since it was dry the first time.  Much better!  New family favorite.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe, it's so easy to make!! I use a mix of pistachio and walnuts, but I'm sure it would taste good with whatever nuts you have lying around.  I took the advice of other reviewers and moved the baklava out of the pan as soon as possible. I didn't have any cupcake papers, so I just put them on a piece of parchment paper on a serving plate - the bottoms didn't get sticky at all.  I am going to keep an eye on them in the oven the next time I make these because I took them out at 40 minutes and they were a little too brown.

This is the first time I have ever eaten baklava let alone make it. I started with this recipe but ended up combining it with the recipe on the back of the phyllo dough package. I used 1 1/2 portions of sauce as recommended by other reviewers. Mixed 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/2 cup sugar with 5 cups of toasted mixed nuts (2 1/2 cups walnuts, 1 1/2 cups pecans, 1 cup pistachios). Butter each sheet of dough (8 @ a time), layer 8 sheets, 1 2/3 cups nuts, repeat twice. 16 sheets on top, bake @ 325 for 55 minutes. Pour refrigerated sauce on hot baklava...delicious!!

WONDERFUL!!!!  Everyone loved it!  I did read the reviews prior to making it as it was my first attempt - very helpful!  Make the sauce ahead of time and let it cool then pour over the hot baklava.  I put the baklava on the cupcake papers and then on a cookie sheet and froze in the freezer.  Worked out great!

I found that I needed to double the amount of sugar sauce otherwise it was too dry. Great recipe though I made it for my family and they all loved it. It's so rich that we managed to make the dish last for a whole week! I've been to Greece and I can honestly say that this is the real thing!!!

Absolutely wonderful! My first attempt making baklava and it was a hit over the Christmas holiday.  A rookie note, make sure you defrost the phyllo in the fridge overnight. Attempts to defrost don't turn out like you would think, but you can still use broken phyllo and no one will know, so long as it's not the top layer!

This was fabulous.  I haven't had baklava in years.  I followed sandra lee's suggestions.  It only took me about 12 minutes to assemble.  I already had the butter melted and ground the nuts and added cinnamon.  I shouldn't have baked for 50 minutes.  I think I should have checked about 40 minutes.  It was a lot more golden than I've ever had before.  Still very good.  I was surprised that when I poured the cooled sauce over the baked baklava, it snap crackled and popped.  I made it 5 days ago.  We didn't cover it because of the hint.  It's still good--not soggy at all.  It will be finished tonight.

I made this for Christmas eve dessert, and had never worked with phyllo dough NOR even tasted baklava before! It was a success! I hated how it tasted though, baklava is sickly sweet... not for me. But for others who had before they said it was awsome & perfect! I did butter every other sheet, and would not add as much sauce as I did. I doubled the sauce as suggested and it was toooo much, soggy almost, they were dripping, just stick to this original recipe exactly.

Excellent!  I always make the recipes on this site as written the first time, but this time I wished I would of followed other reviewers suggestion of making 1.5 the amount of syrup... more of a good thing!  I had been intimidated of making this dish, but it was really very simple.

I tried this for the first time for my 84 yr old mother for Christmas.I was nervous,having never worked with phyllo dough.I decided to go with Sara Bear's tips,only making 1 1/2 times the sauce.(3/4 cup water,1 1/2 cup honey.) and with a little sugar in with the nuts.She didn't say if she cut the sugar ,since there was so much more honey.So, I think I only put about 1/4 cup sugar in the syrup.I didn't know if that would make the sauce too thin.But I refrigerated the sauce for a couple hours til I got around to doing the rest.Well, my mother said it was as good if not better than any she had eaten..I was so glad.Oh, and I baked it at 325 for 50 minutes.But it depends on your oven.I have gas....and I know electric can burn faster.

This came out BEAUTIFULLY. My only hints are to make the sauce before the rest of the pastry so it can cool completely by the time you pull the rest out of the oven, and to only cut the pastry about 2/3 of the way through so the sauce soaks into all levels and doesn't just sit on the bottom and make it soggy.

I was told to cut this part way through before baking it, and I think that actually helped. It came out very hard and I don't think I could have cut it after baking. But, then again, it could have been hard because I cut it early. Even though it was hard, it tasted incredible and I couldn't stop eating it. I think if I ever make baklava again, I would either not cut it early or use another recipe, but I may never make it again because it took me forever to layer everything. I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was delicious but hard and took a long time to make.

This was my first time making Baklava and it was so easy! It took me about an hour (I had 4 little helpers) but it is so worth it! Thank you for the wonderful recipe, it tastes better than anything I have ever bought!

Wow! DELICIOUS! I took the suggestions of others and made the sauce first then allowed to cool in the fridge before pouring it over the baklava right out of the oven. I didn't believe it could be that good with so few ingredients, boy was I wrong. Even my husband was in awe when he tried a small bite that I was willing to give up. The rest waits for Thanksgivings guests (hold me back!)

I just made this and it was a hit. I had tasted baklava a few years ago and loved it. The only difference from those and these is that these ones just weren't very goowie though so next time I will double the sauce. I followed someones review to cut almost to the bottom and not completely and making the sauce before and letting it cool before putting it on the hot baklava. It was pretty simple to assemble and I only dabbed a little butter on each layer instead of being generous with it and it helped make it nice and crispy. Very good though but needs more sauce.

Phenomenal recipe!  My family, friends and co-workers LOVED it.  I do toast/roast the nuts (pistachios and walnuts) and add a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon. Do make sure to only cut half way through before baking -- it makes a world of difference in the texture! THANKS AGAIN!

This is an amazing recipe. The concept is very easy - but working with the phyllo dough takes some patience! Once you get past that, it's actually not a very complicated and uses mostly ingredients that you already have in the house, so you will likely only have to pick up the dough and nuts. I had my oven at 325 for 40 minutes (not 350 for 50 minutes) and it still started to burn - so I will definitely go with a lower heat next time. This baklava is delicious and impressive!

This was delicious! Since I'm a vegan, I did use dairy-free margarine and it worked out just fine. I found that as long as the phyllo dough was cool, it was easy to handle. When it got closer to room temperature, it started to stick together.

Tastes exactly how I remember it. I did have to use a bit more butter than the recipie asked for. Probably because I got a little happy buttering all the layers. Other than that it was wonderful!

AWESOME recipe!  I follow it to a "T" and it turns out perfect every time.  Whenever I take this somewhere - three things happen:  1) people think I'm some sort of brilliant cook, 2)everyone asks for the recipe, 3) there are never any leftovers.  A definite keeper!

After the first time I made this, I was asked to make it for a wedding, it's that good! I made it for the wedding and had some leftover and took it to my son's ballgame and got raves from everyone there who had some. Fabulous recipe! Easy to make. Some of the tips I picked up before making it were to butter the layers VERY lightly. I think I only used about a 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of a cup. I also don't cover the dough while layering. I find it's actually easier to use when it starts to dry out. Don't worry about the dough tearing or wrinkling, you can't tell once it's cooked. Also, let the sauce cool before pouring over. Definitely a great recipe!

I have used this recipe for a couple of years. You can't go wrong with it. I have used pecan, walnuts, almonds..you name it, whatever nuts I had on hand or what was on sale at the store. Never skimp and use margarine on this. It deserves the real thing.

Wonderful!  My 11 year-old daughter made this for a school project.  Every last piece was gobbled up!  She didn't even get one for herself.  I was able to sneak one little piece before she took it to school and it was delicious - sweet and sticky as it should be.  The trickiest part was cutting it up before baking.  Other than that, it was easy enough for my daughter to do on her own.

Wow! This is fabulous. I did make a few mistakes though please read on to prevent the same errors. 1.Chop the nuts up finely, mine were more coursely chopped and I ended up having sheets of dough left over and it would have been better if there had been more layers. 2. Also, I followed the advice of other reviewers and made more sauce - I ended up with sauce left over. So next time I will just follow the recipe and not make extra. 3. I liked someone else's suggestion to cut it with a pizza cutter, that worked very well except on the edges where I used a knife. 4. I did not use a whole cup of butter. I would melt just half a cup and than melt more later if your run out that way you won't end up with a bunch of leftover melted butter.

This is a great recipe BUT 50 minutes is crazy - I have burnt the baklava twice before getting it right - 350 for 15 minute is more accurate.

Great, simple baklava.  I found that I only need 1/4C of butter, and about 1/3lb chopped nuts.

This was good. I melted the butter before putting on the layers, and didn't have a brush. So I took a paper towel and folded it. And then dipped the end and brushed the butter on. Worked fine for me.

Time consuming, but easy to assemble, this recipe will win you kudos. It seems like the kind of recipe that requires a lot of skill. Despite that, it comes together easily. On a couple of the layers, I shook a little cinnamon over the dough, since we like that flavor a lot. With the cinnamon on the chopped pecans that we used, the extra shakes seemed about right.

I made this today and my family loved it.  I used the real butter in the spray bottle trick and that made the whole process so much easier.  I also followed other suggestions and toasted the walnuts prior to chopping mmmmm mmmm good!  This is the one to keep.

This was my first attempt at Baklava and having experienced somebody else's version which I remember as being exceptionally good, I wasn't totally satisfied with it- although everybody who tried it, loved it. I made the mistake of using cheap crushed peanuts when I should have splashed out and used fresh walnuts and almonds. Either it was the nuts or the cooking time, but the edges were slightly overcooked and the top was a bit too flaky and crispy, so I'll decrease the cooking time slightly. I've searched for other Baklava recipes and have come across one which includes citrus peel, lemon juice, cinnammon sticks, nutmeg, cloves, and double the honey. I'll include these ingredients next time. I'll also try somebody's suggestion of using rose water in place of normal water for the syrup.

This baklava was delicious and not difficult to make.  I made the mistake, though, of serving to Turks.  They love baklava, but not with honey.  The honey taste here was strong.

I get such great comments when I make this!  People can't believe it's homemade.  I followed the advice and cooled the syrup completely then poured it on the hot cake as soon as I pulled it out of the oven.  It's always perfect!

This is a great recipe.  I was not sure how it was going to turn out.  I used pecans and I also made 11/2 the amount of sauce.  I cut them before I baked them.  They were pretty.  I cut them in squares and then in half.  Wow I felt like a real chef.  I will definately make them again for a special occasion.  Pretty impressive.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed directions exactly and this turned out great!  The first batch I made disappeared so quickly and was so good that I ended up making another batch the same week.  Make sure your phyllo dough is thawed so that you can get nice full sheets that will be easy to work with.

Caution!  This is a decent recipe, but it will turn out wrong if you follow it word for word.  Two things to change:  1.  Do not cut the baklava before you bake it.  2.  Do not pour the sauce on until after the baklava has cooled for a few minutes.  The point of the sauce is to soak into the dough, to some extent.  However, if you cut the dough first, the sauce just drips through the cuts and collects in the bottom.  Also, pouring the sauce into the hot 9x13 pan just causes it to turn into a sticky gummy goo around the edges.

I recommend waiting until the pan cools a little before pouring the sauce on, letting it cool, refrigerating overnight, and then cutting it after the sauce has soaked in.  That is just from my experience making baklava before - I thought this recipe was a little odd.

Definitely use a spritzer bottle for the melted butter, it cuts down on the time.  It made the assembly easy and effortless!  Also, up the sugar mixture to half more than what the recipe says.  Lastly, use a *serrated* knife to cut through the pastry.  Clean cuts are the key to making the ultimate outcome pretty.  Save about 4 tablespoons for after you drizzle the sugar mixture and then sprinkle them on top.  Also, toast all the nut prior, for extra deliciousness.

Made this for a Greek boss and he loved it.  He actually thought it was store bought.  I was surprised at how easy and beautiful this came out.  I followed suggestions of not cutting all the way through;  cool the syrup mixture and pour it on the hot baklava; and not covering it so it doesn't get soggy.  

I am curious though.  If it can be frozen, how can it be thawed without it getting soggy?

First time making baklava...was a lot easier than I thought. I used half walnuts, half pecans, all chopped pretty fine. I did overcook the syrup a bit and after everything had cooled, it was very sticky but still tasty.

I've made this several times, and it's an amazing recipe as written. I can't believe how easy it is to make a dessert that looks so intimidating. I tried making Alton Brown's baklava recipe as well, but this one is definitely better. Over time, I've made my own additions to the recipe, including what I thought were successes from other recipes. I used a combination of walnuts, almonds, and pistachios. I add 1/2- to 3/4 of a tsp allspice to the nuts, a tsp of rose water to the water, and throw a 1-inch piece of citrus peel into the syrup. I use Athens brand phyllo dough, because it fits perfectly into a 9x13 inch pan. As one reviewer suggested, when you cut the baklava before you bake it, use a sharp knife and cut into it within a half inch from the bottom of the pan, so then when you pour the sauce into the cooled baklava, the sauce seeps into every layer of the Baklava, but doesn't sit at the bottom. Then, cut all the way thru after the whole thing has completely cooled. This is an elegant dessert, portions out perfectly for parties, makes you look like a baking pro, and very easy to prepare (although somewhat time-consuming, if you're new to making it, but it's well worth the effort).

My family was blown away by this baklava recipe.  I used much more butter than the recipe called for, simply because I wanted to make sure all the dough was covered, but I think it worked out well because the baklava turned out very, very moist.  For the nuts, I used a bag of pecans which I chopped into very tiny pieces.  The result was great.  Even my husband, who often buys fresh, handmade baklava at the local farmers' market, said this was the best baklava he's had! Next time I may try adding a bit of ground cloves to give it a little kick.

So good and easy to follow.  I buy the chopped [baking] walnuts from Trader Joe's.   The 1st time I used them as is, but because the pieces were still quite large, I only had enough for 2 nut layers, and the baklava fell apart easily.  The 2nd time, I ground the walnuts in a blender (though not completely because some texture is desirable) such that I had enough for 4 nut layers that stayed together in the end.  I make 1.5x sauce mixture before I start layering and baking, so that it has substantial time to simmer and cool down.  I like to cut mine in triangles, diamonds, or squares and serve them on black Japanese serving trays - one large round one, and a smaller rectangular one.  It makes for a great presentation, and the baklava fits perfectly on the 2 dishes.

This was really time consuming, I thought, and I ended up getting lazy and I did not use all the dough I had.  It still turned out delicious.  I am taking it to church tomorrow, so we'll see how they like it!!!

SO good. The first time I made this, I forgot to cut the baklava before baking it. The second time I cut almost all the way to the bottom of the pan & it absorbed so much better. I used the leftover nuts I had on hand...crushed walnuts, pecans & almonds. So much easier than I ever imagined!

This recipe was time consuming but not difficult. My one other complaint was that the baking time was slightly off. The top layer of phyllo dough was cooked too much and ended up very crunchy. I would suggest taking at least 5 minutes off the baking time. Tasted really good though and looked amazing! i was very impressed with myself when i saw the finished product. I will make again but with the time alteration.

I found this recipe several years ago on All Recipes and it is foolproof.  I have tried black walnuts, english walnuts and pistachios.  We tend to prefer the black walnuts for their strong flavor which is what we are used to in our area.  I am "required" to make at least three batches at Christmas time.  It is a perfect blend of flavors.

So good and surprisingly easy to make, though everyone who tried it thought I slaved all day in the kitchen!  I used pecans and walnuts, made the sauce first as was suggested and poured cooled sauce over the piping hot baklava.  I will be making this again and again, thanks for the recipe!

This was so yummy.  I only made a half batch because I heard about how quickly it can get eaten!  I used mostly hazelnuts and some pecans because that it what I had on hand.  I had a lot of leftover nut mixture in the end.  I thought this could have used more cinnamon and I even put extra in to begin with!  Still it was super and I will make again soon!  It was so easy and so fun to make!

I made this recipe for my restaurant production class at pastry school. The chef loved it! I thought that the recipe was very easily followed and I served the dish with coffee flavored icecream and fresh pecans. The guests at our schools restaurant loved it! I sold out!

Made this for the first time, and it was excellent.  Made a few changes....  Made it in an 8x8 pan so all I had to do was fold the dough over to get two layers, topped it with more nuts, and added Frangelico to the sauce for a hazelnut flavor.  Great recipe!

How can a simple recipe be so absolutely scrumptious!  This is one of my frequently requested desserts when I visit friends and family.  Don't let working with phyllo daunt you.  Just cover it with a damp cloth and be patient with it.

All the comments and ratings are TRUE.  I followed the recipe, but cooked the sugar syrup 10 minutes longer to make it a little thicker. We served it at the Super Bowl Party and it was the hit of the evening, since the Pats lost. :(

SO GREAT!!  I used almonds, just because they are my favorite nut.  SO DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the notes saying to make the syrup ahead of time.  turned out perfect.  (cutting the diamonds before baking is kind of hard, but it CAN be done! :)

I read some reviews and made the syrup ahead of time so that it would be cooled when poured on the baklava.  In addition, I made some changes of my own...I took 3/4 c. brandy and 2 c. dried cranberries, brought the brandy to a boil, added the cranberries and covered with a lid and let them sit for 15 minutes.  I then drained them and chopped them.  I also added a bar of white baking chocolate that was finely chopped and sprinkled chocolate & cranberries on with the nuts on each layer.  My friend (who requested I make baklava) told me in advance he was a 
"plain latte" kind of person and did not think he would like the cranberry/choc combo.  He knows differently now as he has asked me to make this again next week!

This has a wonderful taste. Ive never been a huge Baklava fan, but decided to make this for dessert for the final finale to a Greek meal I made. I have since changed my mind about Baklava! Very good! I didnt have Phyllo dough and had to use Puff Pastry that I had on hand. Im sure it is 100 times better with Phyllo dough and will definitely make it again using the correct dough. But despite that, its excellent!

I was surprised this turned out ok for me. For one I had NO clue what so ever what I was doing. And TWO i feel asleep while they were baking and didnt hear the timer go off....i woke up after they had been baking for an hour and a half. OOPS. still tasted good. I put a little bit of orange zest in the sauce for a little bit of a twist to normal baklava. I did make the sauce before preparing the baklava and followed someone elses suggestion only cutting them half way down so they wouldnt get soggy and cut them all the way the next morning. I cant wait to give this out as a christmas gift this year!!

Perfect everytime!  I could not believe how easy this is to make.  I have bought this many times and it is very expensive, so when I found this recipe I had to try it.  I will never buy baklava at the store again.  It makes a wonderful treat to set out at holiday meals or just for a nice after dinner treat.

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME.  DO FOLLOW THE TIPS FROM OTHER REVIEWS, THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.  VERY EASY, BUT TIME CONSUMING.  MY 8 YEAR OLD HELPED ME FIX THIS AND IT TASTED LIKE A PROFESSIONAL HAD PREPARED IT.

I have never made baklava before and pretty much forgotten what it tasted like, it's been so long since I've had it.  I followed others suggestions to 1 1/2 times the honey mixture.  I didn't put all of it on, but still more than what the original recipe called for.  It was WAY too sweet.  Next time I would put only what the recipe calls for,  maybe even a little less than that.  I would give it 3 stars for how I prepared it, but I am giving it 4 because I did not follow the recipe exactly.  It would have been better if I did.  I did get compliments on it though, so I guess some enjoyed that level of sweetness.

I love baklava, and although I've wanted to make it for a long time, I was always scared off by the phyllo dough--no longer! This recipe was simple and incredibly good. I made a pan of this for my boyfriend instead of a birthday cake, and it vanished! My only difficulty was in getting the top piece of phyllo to stay put while I cut the baklava into diamonds. I ended up using a mixture of walnuts, pecans and almonds, only 2/3 of a 16 oz package of dough and I increased the sugar sauce by half. Thanks so much--this was awesome

I will admit that reading this, I was intimidated.  I have never used phyllo dough before.  After the first layer of nuts, I found it a bit challenging to butter the phyllo.  So I melted the butter in a cup and used a pastry brush to brush it on.  I also used "I can't believe it's not butter".  I used pistachios and this turned out so good.  My neighbors are middle eastern descent and his mom told me that this was delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing this with me!

Easy and delicious!  I roasted my nuts a little; next time I may add a little salt and butter when I roast them.  I also made this recipe with chopped macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips in the bottom layers.  All my test tasters said they were even better that way!

This was awesome!  I didn't find the directions very clear about the last several layers.  I'm assuming you do not need the entire 16 oz. package of dough, and when you run out of nuts you just repeat a few layers of dough only, just like on the bottom.  That's what I did, and it was phenomenal.  Other reviewers recommended making extra sauce, but I found the original recipe to be plenty.  Otherwise it would have been too sweet.  This was so good, and it's definitely going in my recipe collection.

YUMMY!! This was soooo good.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the sauce first (increased by 1/2 as also advised).  Not hard to make at all, but time consuming.  I also cut prior to baking which made it much easier to handle when serving.  Once done baking I poured the cooled sauce over and took to my dinner party uncovered - we ate it about 3 hours later and it was still warm, everyone loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!   My friends loved it so much they wanted seconds (and thirds!).  I didn't find the phyllo to be difficult to work with at all, as long as I kept a damp tea towel covering it (so it wouldn't dry out).  I did add about a TSP of lemon juice to the sauce mix.

I am not a cook at all and I couldn't believe how easy this was to make.  Everyone at work was very impressed! Just make sure you keep the sheets of phyllo dough damp.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I would like to echo some of the other reviewers about the syrup- make a little more than this recipe calls for and pour it on...I was so afraid it'd be too sweet but appearances are deceiving. I had to keep adding the syrup to make it taste like the baklava I know and love. Overall, a great recipe and I will definitely be making this again.

This was my first time making baklava and it turned out great.  It was very time consuming, but well worth it. I made it exactly by the recipe.  It was a huge hit at my Christmas party!

I have never had Baklava before so I had nothing to compare it to but my family loved this. I only used chopped walnuts for the nuts but next time I will try pistachios as other's have suggested. This was very easy and I had no experience with phyllo dough. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good, I had to write a review.  Everyone at the party said it was the best they had ever had.  This is a little labor intensive, but well worth it.  I toasted the walnuts first.  My friends and family are begging me to make more.

This is one of several baklava recipes I made, and I must say-it came out wonderfully! My husband complained about it not being sweet enough (for me it was just right), so I made some more syrup. Definately recommend this recipe!

Excellent!!!  The only downside was that 1 pound of nuts (I used mix of walnuts and pecans) was way too much.  I had enough leftover nuts to make a second batch.  But no one complaining about having to make the second batch.  Will definitely be making this for years to come!

Oh my gosh! I made this and it was SOOOO easy... Can't say working with that kind of dough is my fave... But it's worth it! I made a huge batch before my friends and family came over and they were asking to take pieces home with them! This is a great recipe even somebody new to cooking and baking can make this!

Phenomenal!  So tasty and easy to make. I made this for a special end to Father's Day dinner, and everyone immediately went back for seconds and thirds.  I added lemon zest to the syrup as it simmered. And I added about 1/3 more cinnamon than the recipe called for. We did not think it was too sweet.

I made this on Sunday. I followed other suggestions. Use toasted pecans- I crushed them in a baggie and toasted them dry in a pan for 5 minutes. I added 1/4 C. sugar with nuts and cinnamon. For sauce I used 1/2 C. water and 1 C. honey. I brought to a boil for about 8 minutes only and spooned on hot Baklava. Also, I used 1/2 C. melted butter and used a pastry brush to spread it over 4 layers of phyllo at a time. It was much less time consuming and so easy. It was gone in minutes at lunch today. Incredible!It was my first time making this!I have several requests already.

G'day! I've never made baklava before  but when I made it for my co-workers, they all raved about it; one doctor gave me the highest reccomendation, considering that baklava is a traditional dessert that his family makes! I used chopped walnuts, and increased the ground cinnamon to 1 1/2 Tbsp. Thanks again for the recipe!

My first attempt at Baklava.  It was very easy to make, but it was time consuming.  I thought it tasted wonderful.  My co-workers demolished it.  Next time, I'd pour on more sauce. I like it dripping in goo!

A lot of work, but worth it! I didn't worry too much about torn phyllo sheets since they're "hidden" in the layers. I made the sauce before assembling to give it time to cool, as others suggested.

This one's a keeper!

This is to die for! I only used 3/4 of the butter and it still turned out great. I like that it is not so sweet like the ones at the bakeries.  I love this served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe, although I was intimidated at first. I used margarine instead of butter and it still tasted great. I would suggest finely chopping the walnuts. I kept thinking that the sauce would thicken up but it didn't. I simply spooned it over the baklava and it turned out great.

This is excellent.  I make it all the time for my Greek inlaws and they think I bought it at a Greek bakery.  I use Greek honey - that probably makes a difference.

I love this recipe. I have been reading about how people are having so much trouble with the syrup portion. Trust me and do what I do...take a cup of straight clove honey, add a tsp. vanilla and a shot of your favorite liquer to thin it out a little. I use captain morgan.

Wonderful recipe. This was my first time making baklava. I made two pans of this for a church dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and received many compliments. It was the best baklava I had in years. Not soggy and not overly sweet.

The recipe was a good start but I would add more layers to the bottom and in between. I was left with a lot of extra phyllo (or did I miss a step?). I would also add more honey because the top was a little dry while the bottom was just perfect.

Absolute Heaven !! I was craving baklava and am soo happy to find this recipe and with the result.It is an effort making this but well worth it.After reading the reviews i took advice and covered the fillo dough with plastic wrap and a damp sheet..worked well...used lots of melted unsalted margarine with a brush and a combination of Pistashios,Walnuts and Almonds. Also added 1/2 cup of castor sugar and a sprinkle of cardamon powder to the nuts. Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce. To keep the fillo from curling, sprinkle a bit of water just before baking and make sure to cut all the way to the bottom before and after baking.Pouring cooled sauce over hot baklava really helps from preventing it becoming soggy. Thanku so much for a great recipe..will definitely be making more of this again.Soo Good !!

This recipe, and the results, are absolutely outstanding!  I got rave reviews the first time I made it!  People think that making baklava is difficult; it's not, it just requires patience.  From the other reviews I took the following advice: I made 1.5x the sauce, let it cool completely and poured over the hot pastry.  Also, I sure was glad I cut the pieces before I baked it.  FYI, I used a combination of walnuts and pecans, just because that's what I had on hand...tasted great!  Thanks, Donna, for this awesome recipe!

I tried this and had fantastic results. I noticed that lots of people had trouble spreading the butter...melt it and use a pastry brush, it's easy. I had to share it with lots of people, so I wouldn't eat it all by myself. Wonderful

Well I made this 4 days ago and am about to make it again.  For anyone incompetent like me I found cutting messed up my top layer of filo pastry so this time will stick an extra layer that can be removed after cutting (just for neatness sake).

From previous reviews I presumed I should buy filo pastry from the freezer but they have it in the fridges and I ran my dryer so the room was really humid (didn't use the wet cloth) and the pastry didn't become brittle.  Enjoy!

This was a great recipe and much easier to make than I thought it would be!  Next time I make it, I'll use less nuts.  I also pushed whole cloves into the center of each square for decoration.

Excellent easy recipe. It was a bit dry for my taste, I would add about another 1/3 of the honey-sug-water mixture. Other than that, it is wonderful!  It kept well for many days unrefridgerated.

This is wonderful.  I made two pans because of all the rave reviews and it was well worth it!  My Mom took one pan and I had to split the other with my in-laws.  Even my very finicky father-in-law loved it.  The phyllo dough was not as hard to work with as I thought,, I guess because I live in humid Louisiana and it stayed moist.

This was fantastic, not too gooey like some that I have had. I added 4 tbl of OJ and 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I was also intimidated to work with phyllo dough, but practice makes it easier.  It is time consuming to make, but well worth it.

This was THE BEST Baklava recipe I have ever tasted!  My hubby and 2 year old daughter loved it, although it was a bit messy and sticky to it the amazing richness of it made up for it.  I hightly recommend and this recipe is now a staple in my recipe box!

This is really good, but I didn't use all of the syrup.  It's a little too gooey so maybe next time I'll only use half of the syrup.  Other than that, it's delicious, and was really pretty easy.  My sons loved helping to sprinkle the nuts on!  Thanks!

Wow! I made this for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit. I always thought baklava was hard to make. Not true. Very easy. I'll be making this whenever I want to impress someone or just have something I know everyone will like.

Good basic recipe.Here are differences that I made from the original recipe and some useful tips:1. I made the sauce first. I used 1 cup each of water, sugar, and honey.  I added some lemon zest in the sauce too. After done cooking it, I put it in the freezer right away with a towel underneath. This allowed the sauce to get really cold after my baklava was baked. 2. I chopped 1lb of walnuts and added half tsp of nutmeg and a quarter cup of brown sugar in the nut mix too. 3. I bought my phyllo sheets at Wegmans. It's a Wegmans brand, and it's $2.99 per pack. It's 16oz per pack with 2 rolls, sized 9X13. It fits perfectly with a 9X13 baking pan. I used 2 rolls.  I thawed them in room temperature for 30 minutes. There was no need to cover it with damped towels, because I assembled my baklava very fast, less than 15 minutes. You may need it unless it takes you so long to do it.4.  Every time I picked up two phyllo sheets together to layer and brush butter lightly on top of them. A good pastry brush does help to apply butter fast and easy.  My pastry brush is KitchenAid, it works well.5. I sprinkled 3 tbsp nuts mix, it worked out just right with all the layers. 6. When I cut the assembled baklava, I did follow other people's tip that not to cut all the way to the bottom. That did help to prevent the sauce soaked down the bottom and make the bottom layers soggy. It made the nuts layers more sticky crunch.7. I used 2 sticks of butter. I melted it in the microwave and put the containe

I will definitely make this again! So good and pretty easy to put together. Made it for a friend's birthday  and she loved it.  It took me about 1 1/2 packages of phyllo dough. I recommend for a weekend or something when you have a good amount of time because it takes a while to place the phyllo sheets without ripping them.

I recommend making the syrup first and then letting it cool completely while assembling and cooking the baklava. You might even put the syrup in the fridge. It is best to put COLD syrup into the hot baklava, as soon as you take the baklava from the oven. Hot syrup on hot baklava makes a soggy mess.

I made this recipe three times. Each time I changed it up, just slightly. I used extra butter and extra sauce. Someone rated this recipe three stars and indicated the sauce was too thin; however, I found the sauce to be just the right consistency. If the sauce was any thicker it would not seep into the layers as well!  Also, I found if you cut only half through before baking, pour the sauce over after removing from the oven, allow to cool, then cut the rest of the way through. This allows the sauce to seep into layers nicely!  Great recipe!

The recipe on this is not very precise. if you are using a 9/13 inch pan, you need a phyllo dough that's 9/14 inch phyllo dough which is available in the supermarket. 
I had to struggle with cutting the phyllo sheets and adjusting it in the pan.

I made my first baklava two weeks ago following this recipe exactly as directed (opting for a nut blend of 10 oz finely chopped walnuts, 6 oz finely chopped almonds) and it received rave reviews from all who tried it - that's a lot, as it's pretty big! This time I thought about changing the recipe up a little, but I realized there's no improving on perfection. Delicious, easy, and perfect.

Definitely a favorite! Per other reviews: roast (careful not to burn) walnuts before chopping, try the spray bottle method for the phyllo - melt butter, pour into a spray bottle (emptied I can't believe it's Butter) spray layers quickly. Changed my oven temp to 325. Add 1 t. lemon zest to honey mixture, don't cut all the way through while soaking in the sauce, wait till ready to remove from pan.  Make sauce and keep in fridge before baking baklava, it's better if 1 is cold and the other hot. Not so good if sauce and Baklava are both warm.

I have never made Baklava before. I also have never rated a recipe before. I made 2 batches in one night because the first one although it tasted great, fell apart. Read as many positive reviews as you can and it will be a breeze! Some of the things I learned that I found most helpful: I put melted butter in a spray bottle. Worked GREAT! Set aside 8 sheets of phyllo dough ahead of time for the top layer. I added some sugar to the nuts.
I did make extra syrup and I made it first and then cooled completely so I could pour it on the hot baklava fresh from the oven. My greek boyfriend said he's never had better and his father said "Only my mother made it better". Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!!

Made it for a Greek Party and all authentic Greeks wanted my recipe. I added cardamon, nutmeg and a little sugar to the nut mix.  Unfortunately in NZ nuts are very expensive and pistachio nuts are the worst. To NOT break the bank I used walnuts, almonds and pumpkin seeds for my mix.

This was perfection!!! I did follow the changes suggested by others: 1. Made 1 1/2 the sauce and it was the perfect amount! 2. Made sauce early and let it cool before adding to the baklava. 3.Didn't cut the baklava all the way down until after the sauce cooled.  4.  Lightly buttered (someone said too much  butter would make it soggy). 5. Cooked it at 300- 325  and watched it until it was just browned on top. 6. I used walnuts, almonds, and pecans. It's pretty much the best dessert I've ever had and I have had a LOT of desserts. I've had baklava in Turkey and Greece and mine was just as good. Make this!!!! It's yummy!!!!

My father loves Baklava so I make it for him at least 2 times a year.  I used more nuts and added almonds and walnuts. I also didn't use all of the syrup because I noticed that is too heavy if you do. Great recipe though! !!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I did use a maybe 2 or 3 more tablespoons of butter, and I added pistachios and pecans. Turned out AWESOME and was a big hit at our office Christmas party!

Have made this recipe several times and have a faithful following of fans that think it is great.
I have taught others how to make it, it is sort of like a kindergarten project putting it all together. The pastry brush suggestion someone made is a good one, it works well.
Make sure your phyllo is fully thawed and be careful handling it is the only advice I have.
Fun to make, great to eat. Great recipe. Never disappointing.

Loved it! I also added golden raisins soaked in sherry for 1h, and for the 1 pound of nuts I added 1/2 pound of pecans and 1/2 of pistachios. 
However, the sorbet (it's not really called sauce, this is baklava) was not enough. I made twice the amount so the baklava was nicely moist (the baklava is not suppose to be a dry dessert, but quite moist even soaking in sorbet. Ask any Arabian or Turkish baker).

I made a double batch, what an edeavor!!!  
Since nuts are so expensive I used 1/4 # dates and 3/4# nuts (8 oz pecans, 6 oz pistachios, and 2 oz cashews), for the sauce I used raw honey, turbinado sugar, and zest from 2 lemons.  I 1.5x the sauce recipe and chilled it while I made and baked the pastry.  Next time will definitely try misting butter instead brushing, just have to figure a way to keep butter hot.  Phyllo can be very tricky to work with as it is so delicate if you let it get too dry it will crumble, rip and tear and too moist it sticks to other sheets.  Don't let it aggravate you, I go through and separate the sheets for each layer with plastic wrap before starting so I don't have to keep track of  how many sheets I have put down and can gauge how much filling I have for each layer.

I tried this recipe and it was absolutely delicious. All you have to do is work fast and bake it for 40 minutes instead of 50 to get it to a nice golden crisp. For everyone who wrote bad comments about how this isn't real baklava, it is real. Baklava can be Arab or Greek. The Arab way does not have the cinnamon and  vanilla flavor in it. It also uses pistachios instead of walnuts. Baklava is NOT Turkish.

Love this recipe. I watch several videos on how to make baklava and this was the best, with the best instructions. It really made it easy to follow.  It turned out delicious.  I have several friends to vouch for this since they keep begging me to make it again. Thanks so much a keeper for life.

I easily make this vegan- just sub in Earth Balance for butter!  I make it all the time and it's always a hit. I've made it both ways and ppl actually like it with EB instead of butter better. (I don't tell them). I use half walnuts and half pistachios and also add a pinch of cardamom and nutmeg. It's my most popular recipe. Five stars all the way.

Brother Ricky went around & round over cool pastry covered with hot sauce vs cool sauce poured over hot pastry. A search of the oracle found it doesn't matter, as long as it's either or, but not the same. This turned out great and after pulling a piece of to snap it's pic the question arose... "will it last through the night?" My friends... only time will tell.

This is my favorite baklava recipe.  I keep coming back to it again and again. It always gets lots of praises. I use 1/4 walnuts and 3/4 pistachios. I only use about 1/3 cup of butter. Make sure to cut it BEFORE you bake. When I make the sauce, because we have our own hives, I use 1 cup of honey and 1/2 cup succanut. Excellent.

WOW. Not nearly as hard as I thought it would be to make, and the best I've ever tasted. This was perfection.

so yummy! it tastes just like the one I buy in Astoria, NYC. I followed the tips from other reviewers...I made the sauce first. I used my food processor to "chop" the nuts and I cut the pastry with a wet knife, it makes a difference. I was delicious and I will definitely make again!

WOW.  THIS WAS FANTASTIC. Two inexperienced bakers here (aka college kids) were able to pull this off with ease on the first try!   We followed the directions for the most part, but did create the sauce before anything else then chilled it in the fridge.  We also didn't cut all the way through before adding sauce.  Our nut mixture was 10oz of walnuts 6oz of almonds.  Make sure the phyllo dough is thawed out all the way before working with it, or it will crumble and flake apart.  We didn't use the damp towel.  Made 16 triangles.  Watching the video beforehand was helpful to.

Made just as recommended. I couldn't spend the money on pistachios (four boys eat like there is no tomorrow) so I used pecans. It was very good. As suggested by others, I might make a bit more of the syrup next time. They turned out adequately moist but it is nice for them to be a bit more gooey. Very good and I will make them again - maybe next time with pistachios because I prefer it that way.

This is the first time I have ever made BAKLAVA. With everyone telling me how difficult fillo dough is to work with I was a little skeptical. It wasn't hard at all.   My tips:  Oven temp 530 degrees.  I put the BUTTER in a pampered chef spray bottle. This made spreading the butter EASY & FAST. I did NOT put a damp towel over the fillo dough, instead: I put a piece of wax paper in the FREEZER for about 10 minutes. I would put it on the fillo dough in between the time I was making my layers. YOU CAN DO THIS! Great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years now so thought I would write a review. I give this as a gift to my neighbors at Christmas, they think I slaved forever! I use pecans or pistachios as my family is not a big fan of walnuts. Otherwise, I don't change a thing.This is so easy and sooo good! A friend had a Turkish Foreign Exchange Student who was homesick for Turkish food. I made Cacik and this Baklava. She loved it.

I have never attempted making baklava before because I thought it would be really complicated to make. This recipe seemed so simple that I tried it. Well, it came out fabulous. Everyone loved it and thought I had spent a long time on it. I will be making this next time I'm asked to bring dessert! Thanks for sharing this recipe. Btw, I added all of the sauce ingredients from the beginning and brought to a boil. I then simmered it for 20 minutes.

Good times!  My sixteen-year old daughter and I worked this together and I found that to be considerably easier than doing it by myself.  She buttered, I layered in the filo dough.  Tastes great, recipe was right on!  Thanks for sharing a keeper!

This was really good-- but it made ALOT, so be prepared to give some away or eat it all!  I tried freezing half, but it didn't come out of the freezer nearly as good as I'd hoped.

I found this incredibly easy to make and it was a HUGE hit with family and friends!  Luckily I read a lot of the comments first and as a result I did find that I had to increase the butter to 3 sticks and then use a pastry brush to *paint* each layer.  I found that cutting it first made it cook more evenly.  Also the type of honey you use may add some flavor to the dish.  Lastly, with the second batch I got inventive and added mini chocolate chips to one end of the pan -- what made it taste just like the chocolate baklava I had in Istanbul!

I have made this recipe at least 30 times now. Every single time I make it, it flys out of the pan. I do make more layers than it states to, only because I like it that way.  It is the perfect amount of cinnamon and honey sweetness. One of the best recipes for Baklava and authentic!

OMG!!! This was absolutely delicious and exactly how I remembered it growing up!  I used half walnuts and half pecans finely chopped in my food processor, which made this step so easy.  As others suggested, I added 2 T. sugar and 1/2 t. more cinnamon to the nut mixture. Others also suggested giving it a more honey flavor so I added 1/4 C. honey to the sauce.  I enjoy honey so this addition was a good one for me. If you are not a real honey fan, then you should not add the additional honey.  I refrigerated the sauce to cool it off before pouring it on the hot out-of-the-oven baklava.  After baking, the top phyllo layers were crispy and light - not soggy.  Before baking, I tried to cut only through most of the layers to the bottom of the pan before pouring the sauce over it - its hard to judge, but made the effort.  I did not toast the nuts-it tasted fabulous anyway. I baked only about 45 minutes - came out perfect.  My husband and daughter who are not baklava fans liked it.  My son and I LOVED it!  This is not a low calorie dish, remember, but it is absolutely worth making.  I ate 4 in two days - not a good idea for the waistline.  I froze the other half of the recipe as others suggested.  So delicious!!!

Flippin Amazing!!  I made this, gave it to my mother inlaw and she told me she could only eat 2 pieces.  That night she called me and said she ate the entire thing in one sitting!  She said it's the BEST Baklava she's ever eaten.  Yes! She wants me to make more.

I love the flavor of this baklava, but it turned out a bit soggy. I suspect I used too much butter on the phyllo layers, as I ran out about 2/3 of the way through assembly. Next time, I'll go a little lighter. I used a mix of pecans, walnuts, and peanuts, but I think next time I will stick with pecans only. I don't think the texture of the peanuts was quite right.

I use half pecans and half walnuts, as well as adding lemon juice and zest into the sauce.  My father-in-law, who is Greek, has told me it is the best Baklava he has ever eaten because it isn't overpowering with sweetness.

I will admit the Phyllo dough is not the easiest thing to work with, but it is worth it for how great this baklava tastes. Everyone I serve it to loves it.  I can't cook anything, but I can make this. Just don't cover it or it gets soggy; however, I didn't have any problems freezing it. I recommend using pecans.

I am not a very advanced baker but this recipe was spot-on. I loved it, my friends have all loved it, it's almost too good to be true! I tried it with 1 c walnuts, 1 c pistachios, and 2 c pecans, and it tasted kind of like a classy, baklava version of Honey Bunches of Oats cereal :) If you don't like that description, it just tastes fresh and delicious. Thank you for the recipe, will be doing again soon :)

It was fantastic! Tasty and rich. I made it with Macadamia and Walnuts. I did not pour the entirely amount of sauce, I poured about 1/4 of it (slightly cooled) onto the baklava after baking. Stored the rest in the fridge. I didn't want it soggy :)  It was fun to make and got my boyfriend to help layer the phyllo. Thank you for recipe.

I made this and it came out good yet it seemed to be missing a spice, I used ghee as suggested in one of the comments to improve the chances of it not being soggy but it didn't seem to help any. I increased the sauce 1 1/2 times as some previous comments said the amount suggested would make too dry of a dessert. I loved it and so did all my friends, however, again, it seemed to be missing a spice.

This was delicious! I watched the video listed with this recipe and that helped me get a visual for the layering process. I recommend using real butter to brush the sheets-not margarine or Pam. The butter flavor really shines through and helps balance the sugar/honey. I used hazelnuts because they were cheap, and I couldn't taste them too much so I'm glad I didn't need to splurge on walnuts/pecans. Also-my phyllo sheets came out of their package pretty wrinkled and broken, I just did my best with it and it didn't affect the final product in any way. Great, fool proof recipe!

Tastes just as baklava should. It's sweet, sticky, crispy, and decadent. I did not cut the pastry sheets, I just folded them onto themselves. The amount of butter listed is plenty. Do not saturate your sheets in butter or they will not crisp. Also, I suggest leaving the amount of syrup the same, or it will be sickeningly sweet. This took me about twenty minutes to assemble.

I chose this recipe to try, and I'm really glad I did.  I'm also glad I didn't read all the reviews before I made it, because I followed it as written and we love it! I've only had baklava as made by the Greek monastery near my home, and this is actually better in my opinion.  It's not quite as sticky sweet as the baklava we get from the monastery bakery.  I've never used phyllo before, and that was a bit of a nightmare.  I don't know if it was something I did or what, but many of the sheets on the inside of the rolls were coming apart.  I just plowed ahead and put the puzzle together and it came out fine.  I melted the butter because it made sense and only realized that the recipe didn't specifically state that after reading the reviews!  I watched the pan when the time got close to 40 minutes (the recipe does say ABOUT 50 min, after all) and I took it out at about 45 minutes - Perfect.  Don't have any idea why there is such a range of cooking times in the reviews - mine was still very pale until just before the 40 minute mark.  To our family the whole thing is perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe. As soon as that sauce caramelized, i went ahead and dug in for that first slice. I went for another. I called the hubby to come down from his mancave to try it. He had 2 and was walking around with it, swaying his head like Stevie Wonder while moaning in yummy heaven. This was at around 2pm so it was just snacking. I did not digress too much from the recipe and it was perfect just as it is. In fact, it was just a minimal modification. I did not realize that I did not have vanilla extract until I was back from the store, so instead, I steeped half a cinnamon stick while simmering (yes, I know...if somebody asked me what I would more likely find in somebody's pantry, vanilla extract or cinnamon, I would say vanilla extract!) For the nuts, I used my left over walnuts and bought pecans to make the 1 pound. It was cheaper than the other nuts. I also followed Sandra lee's suggestion not to cut the Baklava all the way to the bottom to keep the sauce from spilling out and allowing it to seep through every nook and cranny. This is very easy to make. Brushing every other sheet of phyllo dough with butter was the most time consuming. As I logged in here to make this review, I saw that somebody suggested using a spray bottle to apply the butter. I have to remember to do that next time. Yes, there will definitely be a next time. And a next one. And a next one.

I use always walnuts and I also put cinnamon sticks in the syrup .one important thing is to let the baklava cool down and then poor the hot syrup above and let it soak for a couple hours this is to keep the baklava crunchy and still juicy inside give it a try .

Count me among the people who thought there was a mystery behind making Baklava, and was too mystified to attempt making it myself. This recipe simplifies it and makes even the novices among us feel like Greek Baklava gods and godesses. I make the recipe as is, with the addition of a 1/2 tsp of ground cardamon in the nuts. It adds a "bright" flavor. To make the drudgery of of buttering the layers easier, I re-purposed an empty bottle of spray "margarine" to use as a butter sprayer. Every 2nd layer, I spritz the sheet down. Works likea charm--just the right amount of butter. Even if you're on the fence about making this version, I say go for it. It's quicker than you think, easier than you could guess, and tastes heavenly.

I was studying Greece and found this recipe on your site.  It tasted like strudel, which we love.  It was fun to make, though confusing at times.  The phyllo would have fit our pan without cutting. Most people in our family don't like nuts, but they liked this!

I make these with pistachios for the best flavor, but peeling, blanching cleaning and chopping them takes quiet a while to do. I've made this with walnuts but it just doesn't taste as good. If you're a patient person I suggest the pistachio route, it's definitely worth it!

This recipe is amazing! First time I've ever made baklava or worked with filo dough and it was so much easier than I thought it was going to be! I didn't find it difficult at all, only a bit time consuming. I did take the adivce of some of the reviewers and made the syrup first and let it cool before spooning ot over the piping hot pastry. It sizzled! Totally awesome. This is my go-to recipe from now on!

This is an Amazing recipe, and is pretty easy. Like alot of others I melt the butter and brush it on the sheets of dough. I also start cooking the sauce before I start on the Baklava, when its done I put it in the refrigerator to cool. Then as soon as I take the Baklava out of the oven I pour on the now cooled honey sauce, this has always insured the Baklava is crunchy and not soggy. I have had so many complements people just love it the best complement I got was from someone saying, "The last time I had Baklava this good, I was in Italy"... it doesn't get better than that :)

I tried the vegan version of this recipe, and it turned out perfectly, especially the syrup. 
I used 8 oz of walnuts and 4 oz of almonds and substituted Smart Balance for butter and agave syrup for honey. I only used 1/2 cup water to 1 cup agave (it might have been too much agave, since it's sweeter than honey). I also added a dash of nutmeg and clove, and 2 tsp of vanilla rather than 1. It was a huge hit at a family get-together and now they are requesting it for Christmas!

This was absolutely delicious! It was easy to make and turned out perfect. I recommend melting the butter and using a pastry brush and running the nuts through the food processor. I brought it to work and it was a hit among everyone! Thanks for the great recipe!

OHHHHMMMMMGGGGG! This is tooo scrumptios for words. This is my first try and it came out awesome! I will note that the nuts would have been better served if they had been chopped fine. My rough chopped pecans were good but would have been even better chopped finer. I also added a bit more cinnamon, a half a teaspoon or so, to the sugar/honey/water mix just cause I like it. And I will do that the next time. I am making this for every family event forever. It was just too easy and ohhhhh so gooood. Thank you Neonwillie for posting this!

Made this for the staff party at the high school I work at.  People were amazed how fantastic it is...and very easy to make!  I used less sugar...3/4 cup and the comment was it was great as most baklava tastes too sweet!  My family loves it as well...what a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I made a couple changes, I added orange zest to the syrup as well as increased the syrup by half.  Also added a little sugar to the nut mixture, and I wound up needed two boxes of phyllo.  I don't know what I did wrong with the phyllo, but the end result was SO GOOD.  Great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. I am a new cook and was slightly intimidated, but as long as you get all of the ingredients in the pan it turns out great. I used a spoon to spread melted butter on top of the dough. I wish i would have only cute halfway through because the sauce ended up at the bottom.

I had always been afraid to work with phyllo, but this recipe made it so easy. My husband likes more nuts and tolerates honey better than sugar, so I increased nuts by 1 cup and the honey by a 1/2 a cup, decreased the sugar by 1/2. I also increased the cinnamon by 1/2 and added 1 tsp each ground cloves and nutmeg. I was informed I was to make him a batch each month.

The best ever!! I never realized this was within my reach to make at home. It tastes better that at the local restaurant. Just have a crowd and watch it disappear.

The flavors are great but the sugar syrup mixture turned to hard toffee after I poured it on! Next time I'll just drizzle honey on top. Other than that, this tastes very authentic.

I made the recipe as is, but I found that melting the butter and brushing on with a pastry brush worked much better.  I also let the honey sauce cook a little longer, about 35 minutes, which didn't seem to be a problem.  I poured the warm sauce over the warm baklava and it turned out wonderful.  Every type of Baklava I've ever had before was a little more sticky on the bottom so I assumed that was how it was supposed to be.  Nice contrast to the flaky top.

I've made this recipe twice and it always turns out wonderful!  Because I love cinnamon so much, I usually add a little more (maybe 1-2 tsp) than is called for so I can add a few more layers.  This baklava is always polished off quickly and gets rave reviews!

My roommate and I ate half the pan in one night, this stuff is addicting so beware if you have a sweet tooth! Not to mention it's delicious! I had to give the rest away because we couldn't stop eating it! Great recipe, I'll have to try and scale it down somehow in the future to avoid this problem!

The Baklava came out great! I would definitely make it again - everyone raved about it at Easter! If you've never worked with Phyllo dough, note that you have to melt the butter first and then use a pastry brush to brush it on the layers.  Someone on the reviews said a spray bottle works well too.  Also, I forgot to thaw out my phyllo dough and instead had to work with broken dough and therefore had to piece it all together - but that made no difference to the texture or flavor - as far as I could tell.

To be honest, I typically don't like baklava because I've found it way too sugery. I made it this time for my partner, who is European and loves the stuff. But I have to say, I think I've been trying all the wrong baklava my entire life, because I LOVED this recipe! So easy, and SOOOOO delicious! My partner fell over himself, saying it's one of the best he's ever had. I'm making it for every European family get together we have from now on. Period. It RULES.

Wow!! Just made this (my family loves baklava/kadayif) and it is amazing! A lot of people were saying to increase the sauce a little bit, I doubled it and it ended up being too much - but this was forgivable. Also, pouring the cold sauce over the hot baklava or vice versa, was great as was turning the heat down to 325; the baklava was still crispy. It was second best (behind our favorite greek resturant!) and I have to say, I ate a whole row by myself (1x1 squares) and got yelled at by my mother XD. A great recipe - a total keeper!

I made the recepi for a party and it was a big hit, i did not find that it was enough sauce so i made a second batch, if you like it more crisy the original recepi will do but if you like it sticky make 1.5 batches of sauce. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe!  I doubled the nuts and used a combination of pecans and walnuts.  Quadrupled the cinnamon.  Halved the butter.  Used 1 1/2 times the sugar sauce recipe and cooled it in the fridge.  This came out perfect -- just the right amount of gooeyness, but not too much.  Felt like a healthier end product and just as delicious.

Just made this last night for the Valentine potluck I'm a part of tonight.  I had a piece to test...which turned into another...and then a third.  Fantastic and way easier to make than one would think--as other reviewers have mentioned, it's just important to not let the dough dry out.  That was easily remedied with a damp paper towel.  I also had to take my pan out of the oven at around 45 minutes b/c I had to meet friends for dinner, but the baklava still turned out fine.

Wonderful! Made it with Greek themed dinner. Everyone had to have seconds.  It impressed everyone.  I had never made baklava before, and it was easy to make.  Tasted so good and we were glad we had a 9x13 pan!

I made this at Christmas time and it turned out fabulous.  I really impressed my family and myself.  It was very easy to put together.  My only problem was with the phyllo drying out.  You have to work quickly.  Anyway, I'm making it again this weekend for a Superbowl party.  Can't wait to try it again.

It was an easy recipe to follow.  I did put a little extra vanilla extract in the sauce.  I just got done making it at 5 & my dad has already eaten 7 pieces of it & told me it was the best he has had just like a little old greek lasy came to make it

This recipe was amazing!  My adult son wanted Baklava for his Christmas present and I had no idea where to start.  This recipe was very simple to follow and the results were outstanding....It tasted just as good as its presentation!  It certainly made a meaningful gift and delicious as well.

made this for the first time with my sister and it was incredibly easy with two people, just tedious, and it turned out fantastic!  Everyone said it was the best baklava they'd ever had!

Great dessert for Christmas. Just the right balance of sweetness and crunchyness. This really was a hit even after a full course meal!

Great recipe. My husband said he'd rather eat this than pecan pie. I used the butter flavor stuff in the can to make the process go faster. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  Will make again, for sure!

I would use more layers of phylo and nuts to make it a little thicker. Pistachios are my favorite

Wow! Wow!! My first time making this and I followed Sandra Lee's suggestions about not using too much butter. Do not soak the sheets, just wet them. I tried some of her quick tips like using the whole phyllo sheet instead of cutting it, and also not covering the sheets between layers (time consuming) It turned out WONDERFUL!!!! I was so intimidated to make Baklava for so long, and now I wonder why I waited so long. You will love this!! I also read up on storage. If you like softer baklava with a liquidy texture (yum!) then store out of the refrigerator in a covered container. If you like it firm and chewy then store in the refrigerator. I am serving this in muffin cups for my husband to take to work. Of course, I kept some home for the family. Enjoy!!

I made this for my Ladies Joy Circle dinner and it was a hit! Everyone was asking for this recipe. Being a newbie, I would only suggest make a practice batch to get the feel of how long it will take to put together and what not.

I just made these today and it came out perfect. This was my first time making it and this recipe is very easy. I think 50 min though may have been a little long. The bottom of the baklava was a little over cooked. Next time I will take it out as soon as it is golden brown. Maybe about 30-35 min.

Absolutely delish!  I've never used phyllo pastry before, but it was actually pretty easy to use.  It'll be another special event item.

Ok, now I know why they charge so much for baklava at the restaurants, lol!!  This recipe is AMAZING just as written, but I think I will never look at Phyllo dough the same way again because it was very taxing to work with.  Though a bit time consuming, this is a wonderful creation and the directions were very thorough (thank you for that).  I used pecans because that is what we had in the house and followed the instructions exactly as indicated.  Everyone is raving about how good it is!!  Thank you again for sharing!!  :)

This is a great classic Baklava recipe. I used a mixtue of nuts - walnuts, almonds and macadamia - since I love any kind of nuts. I put some in my blender and chopped some by hand to have different textures of nuts. 2 things I did wrong - 1. I didn't butter my top 6 or 8 layers enough, so they separated from the nuts layers when I picked them up. 2. My honey mixture boiled over since I wasn't watching it. All in all, my baklava still came out perfect. DEF made the sauce ahead of time and let sit while the baklava is baking. I will use this recipe again around the holidays.

I can't say enough about this wonderful recipe. I made it exactly as it is presented except I needed more butter. I used a pastery brush to put the butter on every other phyllo sheet and it was exactly as I remember it when I was in Greece. Thank you NEONWILLIE for sharing.

WOW!! I don't care WHERE Baklava is originally from, it's prevalent all over the Mediterranean and Middle East...I wanted to learn to make Baklava for my husband, this recipe is IT! It is so easy-time consuming, esp my first time- but well worth it. I followed the recipe exactly except I folded over the sheets instead of cutting them in half. At the beginning I was buttering in between EVERY single half-sheet, but then I got nervous I read the directions wrong and switched to every 2 half-sheets. I don't think it made a big difference. I didn't even let the Baklava cool completely before I poured the syrup on. I did that right before bed and waited to try a piece til this morning, HEAVEN! Thanks Mtclross87, what a great recipe!

This is one of the easiest recipes to use. I started making it for church functions and now whenever one comes up - I am asked if I am making my Baklava - This is my third year making it and about the 20th time too - have practically memorized it.  You have to be willing to stand for a time, but the end result is worth it.

This is the first time I made any kind of Baklava and it was sooo easy! I took advice from another review and I definitely agree that baking it at 325F worked perfectly. Also, the amount of sauce that the original recipe makes would be plenty. I made 1.5 times the amount called for and I think it made it a little soggy. I would totally recommend this to anyone who has never made baklava before!

this baklava was so good. The only thing was that it feel apart while you were eating it, but I am sure that is because of something I did wrong.

While not the best my wife has tried it was most certainly deserving of 4.5 stars.  Since we don't have that option then I rounded to 5.  This was most certainly a wonderful dessert and my wife adores it.  Thanks for the recipe!

it was a huge success. I`m from the middle east where u can find the Baklava at any bakery, but this one is really better than any Baklava I have ever had . I used 2 cups of walnut and 2 of pecan but I think the butter is tooooooooo much I used just 1/2 cup of butter and it was fairly enough.

I made this tonight for the first time.  It was delicious.  My son, who does not like any type of nuts in food, raved about this yummy dessert.  I made it exactly as stated and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be making this again.

Just made for the first time and I think the recipe is a little misleading.  It sounds like you only use 16 sheets of the dough, ie...the two layers, butter, two layers, butter until you've done 8 sheets, then add some nuts, then two sheets, butter, nuts, two sheets, butter nuts until the top layer has 6-8 sheets.  Since mine is so thin I'm assuming I was supposed to continue layering until I had used all of the dough.  I didn't even use half the nuts and if I added all of the sauce it would be swimming in it.  I'll try adding more layers next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out AWESOME! Everyone who tried it loved it. I cut the pieces before hand (but would make them smaller next time as it's so sweet) and made the sauce in advance. I forgot to read that you need to thaw the phyllo dough so that was interesting, but it all worked fine. I also probably only ended up using 1/2cup of butter. Not on purpose, but there was lots left over.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but I wanted to let people know a few quick little modifications that worked for me. The phyllo I had was about twice as big as the pan I was using, so I folded each sheet in half before putting it into the pan, then just buttered the top surface (resulting in butter between every *other* layer).  I also made this with only 8 ounces of pecans and it was quite tasty.  And finally, I added an ounce or so of orange blossom water to the syrup and I do think that added something to the flavor.  I did not use all the syrup, but maybe around 2/3 and that seemed like the right amount for me.  Tasty!!!

This was my very first time making baklava.  It took a little while, but so well worth the wait. YUMMY!! I took some to work and they raved about it! I am so excited to have this recipe and it does freeze well - I had to do that so I wouldn't eat it all in one night.

NUM YUMMY! This baklava recipe is awesome, the only thing I would do different is cut down on the butter you only need about 1/2 a cup of melted butter instead of a whole cup.

This was AMAZING!  I didn't have high expectations when I was making this because it just didn't look good...but when I served it it was really amazing!  And it looked harder to make when served than it was!  Extremely good!

This recipe is fantastic!  If you spread thinner layers of butter between layers of phyllo dough you will get a crispier baklava.  Also, finely chop the nuts- I like walnuts but will try with pecans next time.   I tried to freeze it for a later date and it froze okay.  It tasted good, but the original crisp and contrast in flavor wasn't there, wouldn't recommend freezing.

This is the first time I've made baklava. I was pretty intimidated because I've always thought it would be such a difficult thing to make. This recipe surprised me! Although working with the filo dough was a struggle, the rest was easy. I only used half the filo dough (8oz) that the recipe calls for.  I used a mix of pecans and walnuts, which I chopped using a food processor.  This made the mixture so easy to use when I was doing the layering.  The 1 cup of butter was way too much, as I had about half of it left.  Those were the only changes I made, and it was awesome!! I had baklava at a restaurant last week, and this was much better!

I made this Baklava once a few months ago and it turned out perfect, so easy and I was so happy. Tonight I made it and I am confused by the directions. I am not sure how to layer the nuts. Also I baked it and it got way to hot and brown and also there was not enough sauce. I did make half as much last time so I guess that answers the sauce problem. Does anyone know when I put the nuts in, do I layer 6 layer with just butter and then put 2 tablespoons in and then two layers without any nuts then 2 tablespoons for each layer up to 8 layers?  I would like to make this perfect again, because I am cooking all the food for my daughter's wedding in June and I would like to make a couple pans of this.

This is sooo delicious! Everyone in the family loves this! Very easy too! I also tried it with two layers of chopped baking apples (diced very very small , added cinamin and a little sugar to the apple mixture) and one layer of nuts -I cut this in squares, holds better, YUM! Will make this many more times - a keeper, thanks!

Soooo Good! 1 lb of nuts was a little much for me. So I used maybe half of that. Next time I make this I think I'm going to experiment with using maple flavor instead of vanilla. : )

i followed other's instructions to make the sauce ahead of time and let cool. this was so delicious! i had no idea that i could make yummy baklava at home! it took me an hour and a half to assemble, though, because the butter kept sticking to the dough. i might try to melt the butter and then cool it before spreading it to speed up the process next time

I have used this recipe at least a dozen times and it is outstanding! We do like it with much more cinnamon though, a couple tablespoons. Every single person who has eaten it said it was the best they've ever had. My brother told  me he had baklava at an award-winning Greek restaurant and mine was much better.

Exceptionally good!!  I tried several times and it is always successful.  It is easy to make and delicious.  One thing I would like to comment is that sugar amount for syrup is a bit high for me.  So I reduced in half and simmered the syrup about 30 minutes  until it turns into slightly thick.

Wow!This was great!! My family LOVED it. It wasn't that difficult to make. My youngest son who doesn't like walnuts LOVED it. My oldest son said I should make this once a week. So, I guess it was a hit. I'll definitly make again. Definitly make sure the nuts are finely chopped.

WOW! So easy, yet so wonderful! I have gotten such great compliments from this recipe. People have said that its better than the stuff purchased at stores! I did change a couple things: I made a mixture of walnuts AND pistachios, increased cinnamon, & decreased the sugar (which I used unrefined turbinado instead of white sugar) and increased the honey. YUMMERS!

This is the first time in my life that I baked and said WOW! I mean WOW!  Absolutely the nicest dessert recipe I've ever found! We used almonds in our batch, and in the last month we've made it 3 times.  My father-in-law even swiped pieces from others' plates when they weren't looking!  You've got to try this!  A tip - I used an electric knife to cut the Baklava it small rectangles and it worked really well. We put the finished pieces into the rectangle cup cake holders (what are they called?!) and they even looked amazing!

I am a novice at making baklava, but with this recipe you would never be able to tell!  It is absolutly delicious (and this is even an understatement!!) We did as another person suggested and cut it to within a half an inch from the bottom to allow the syrup to be absorbed in the upper layers instead of sinking to the bottom, then cut all the way through after it had cooled completely.  We also brushed the butter very lightly between EACH sheet of the phyllo dough.  Other than those 2 things, we followed the recipe to a "T".  Thank you for the great recipe!!

I thought it was good. Too sweet for my taste but overall good. It looks lovely and it was really easy to make. I also added lemon extract and a pinch of cinnamon to syrop. Everybody loved it at Christmas Eve party even though I forgot to put the extra phillo sheets in the end. I will make it again.

Fantastic recipe, but a reminder to beginners such as myself- don't over-simmer the sauce, it will caramelize and break teeth.  Wholey the fault of myself, not the recipe, but everyone still loved it!

This is a wonderful, easy, impressive recipe for Baklava.  I made it with my 15 year-old niece and she was impressed with her gourmet skills!  Definitely a keeper.

Came out really soggy and greasy. I think it was more that there was too much sauce at the end. Tastes good though.

Yum! I had a little bit of a hassle with the phyllo dough---it kept breaking on me. Then I didn't have enough walnuts. Lastly, I must have turned the oven off after making the sauce, so the baklava was just sitting in a warmish oven that was off. DESPITE all these mistakes, the end result was delish! I will increase the sauce a little next time, mainly coz I like mine a little soggier not so crisp. Other than that, it's a perfect recipe!

After reading some reviews, I went a bit lighter on the butter and probably only used a half cup.  I think next time I may use 3/4 cup.  I ended up putting on an extra .5 recipe of the honey sauce to make the Baklava a little less dry.  

I think it really depends on how you like your Baklava - if you don't like it more dry, then use less butter and less sauce. If you enjoy a "soggier" Baklava, put on more butter and more sauce.  My family preferred the "soggier" version!

I am not new to cooking in general but this was my first attempt with phyllo.  I had to bring a few things to a greek themed dinner party.  I followed several suggestions including 1 and a half times the syrup - added a cinnamon stick and let it simmer two hours and used a spritzer bottle to get the butter on the sheets.

Everything went great except two operator errors.  I hate over chopped nuts so I carefully chopped my pecans so they would not turn to dust.  That was a mistake - they need to be WELL chopped.  Next time I will use my handy chopper and will let it go to town.

The second error was that I did not use enough butter.  That spritzer made that butter go a very long way - I probably only used 1/4 cup.  It was quick and handy but between my pecans being too large and my sheets not getting gooey enough - the baklava did not stick together correctly.  

Even with my goofs, they were beautiful and all 8 adults ate theirs and complimented them - and the hosts teen aged son came back to get them over and over until they were almost all gone.

This is a remarkably good recipe.

This is the best recipe ever.  My boyfriends coworkers have actually sent me cards when i make this.  His parents ordered baklava at a greek restaurant and were dissapointed that it wasn't as good as I make it.  Some tricks so make it really good.  Double the syrup and make it first so it has lots of time to reduce.  Definitely is now my signature desert and is asked for ALL the time

i thought this recipe was perfect.  i followed the recipe exactly except used light agave nectar in place of the honey. i thought there was plenty of syrup.  the bottom of the baklava was not soggy at all.  this is so delicious and pretty.  this was my first time working with phyllo--the process does take awhile but when you finally get to eat some, it is just heavenly.  i used a nut chopper which saves some time and chops the nuts pretty fine which is good for this recipe.

This was great!  A bit time-consuming but the end result was worth it.  I used 1.5 times sauce and next time will double it.  The top layers were not as saturated as I would like :)

My first attempt at Baklava was a complete success because of this recipe!! My son needed it to share with his school for a report - people were coming back for seconds and thirds! Finally had to start turning some of the old ladies away - I was afraid they'd make themselves sick!! What a wonderful recipe!

This was my first time making baklava, and I'm so glad it was easy.  I strongly recommend using walnut chips rather than chopped nuts.  Chopped nuts are too big for this recipe.  Also, I used slightly less butter to cut down on any sogginess (another reviewer was right when they said it was the butter and not the sauce that causes sogginess).  I have yet to see how this will taste when left overnight.

Easy and Delicious! Rave Reviews from all who tried it. Don't be afraid of the phyllo dough...easier to deal with than it sounds. Remember part of the charm is the homemade look. Suggestion to pre-cup 90% of the way before baking was right on the money! Thanks for the great find!

This is by far the best baklava that i have ever had (and i have had a lot). I made this for my english Canadian family while they were in town and this was a big hit with a cup of earl grey tea.  I took one readers advice and cut all the way though except for the bottom layer, and instead of spooning the honey mixture over, i just poured the whole thing on and let it soak in.  YUM!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Oh. My. Gosh. This is the best dessert I've ever made. It's time consuming, but simple. I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I'm 100% happy with the results. Everyone who had some was blown away that I made it. I served the triangles individually with cupcake papers. It made it a bit cleaner to eat.

This recipe was awesome. I am American but my husband is Arabic so him and his family know good baklava. I made this for a family dinner and it was a hit. My sister in law said it was better than what you get in Jordan. I followed the recipe exactly. I made no changes and it came out perfect. Thanks so much. This is a keeper.

I made baklava as an after dinner treat for a dinner party I was hosting.  It was an absolute hit.  I lessened the amount of honey to 1/4 cup of honey and I used powdered sugar as well so it wouldn't be so sweet for some guest and they loved it.  Great recipe.

Oh my gosh...this was sooooooooooo good.  I actually merged 2 recipes.  I made the baklava with this recipe and used another one from a greek website for the sauce as it had lemon in it.  This was a school project for my 9th grader.  The sauce was from a website he had found.  This was just toooooooooo good.

AMAZING!  I made this exactly as the instructions stated and it was perfect.  I was left with a few extra phyllo sheets, but no big deal.  Delicious!

This crisps very easily, so watch out! You want it nice and gooey! Also (although, much to my annoyance, I only read this after I made the baklava!), it's a great idea to cut the pastry into correct-sized pieces before starting - you can work a lot faster and get it in the oven in half the time!

Amazing. I decided to go low sugar, and doubled the honey, using only 1/4 cup brown sugar for the sauce. Perfect, Ive always wanted my baklava less sweet and this was the ticket. I also added a pinch of ground cardamon to the cinnamon and nuts, and used a 9x9 dish, roughly folding each layers of dough on top. This is a favorite forever.

This by far was the easiest and most tasty Baklava I have ever had.  

I used pistachios (and ground them almost finely in a foodprocessor.)  

My friends and family just loved it and are asking for more.

My husband LOVES baklava and I promised to make him some.  I found this recipe and decided to conquer my fear of phyllo.  I made it just in time for the Super Bowl party we had to go to and it was a H-I-T.  I had people I don't even know seeking me out to gush about how yummy it is!  

Because I was trying to make the party, I didn't let my dough thaw fully so it crumbled into pieces. I just pulled out what I needed to make the layers and went with it.  It was no problem.  The baklava still came out beauifully.  

I am back for the recipe with the first part safely in the oven. (that part's not hard) I did let my dough thaw before using it this time and it was much easier to work with!  (and I didn't let it sit so long that it was sticky.)

Can't wait for this batch to come out of the oven!

Pretty good.   I took the suggestions of others and made the sauce before I prepped.   I thought the sauce was a little runny and had expected it to thicken up, which it never did. Seems to me there is a better recipe, but this one is still pretty good.

Positively sinful!  I absolutely love baklava and the best I've found was in a small bakery in London.  This recipe is just as good!  I was surprised at how easy it was!  I made the recipe as stated and I wouldn't change a thing!  I served this to company last night and got rave reviews from everyone!

I made this over the holidays, do you know that I made 6 different batches!?! No one could get enough! It was amazing and so so so easy to do, I actually found it much like therapy.  My family thought I deserved a medal ;) I followed the recipe exactly with a few of the tips from other reviewers. WONDERFUL STUFF!!! I think I gained 10 pounds from it, I sent home a couple of sister-in-laws a few pounds heavier too!

I don't normally use phyllo dough (and I really do cook often!) and I wish it said THAW the dough prior to using! DUH! it worked out okay but will thaw next time. I only made a half batch and pretty much used all the sauce so I would definely make a batch and half of sauce for full pan AND I made the sauce first and let it cool. I felt like I was back in Greek Town! YUM

I made this last night for my New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit! It was flaky and crisp on top, soft and moist (without being gooey) on the inside. The only thing I did different was make the sauce while I was assembling the baklava, that way the sauce was cool when I poured it over the hot baklava. I will be making this for years to come. Thanks!

I liked the baklava.  As a matter of fact everyone did.  I tweaked the recipe by adding 1/2 cup of white sugar to the walnuts.  This was the first time I made baklava.

Very yummy!  Didn't change anything.  I did follow a couple tips about using melted butter, using walnuts and making the sauce ahead of time.  My dough was pre-cut (Athens) so that saved time.

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was wonderful.  It calls for 1 cup of butter (2 sticks) and I only used 1.  I followed the advice of sandra lee and didn't saturate the dough sheets.  I used exactly 1 stick.  I will make this recipe again, for sure.

This recipe is amazing. I have been spoiled by only the best baklava at a small Lebanese restaurant that I frequently eat at in my town and the product of this recipe makes for some hefty competition to their recipe. This was the first time I tried my hand at baklava and I did not do too bad at all. I gave some to my dad and he said it was the best Christmas present he'd ever received.

So good!  I read and am thankful for all the reviews.  I used 1 1/2 times the syrup as recommended and also poured it cooled onto hot baklava.  I toasted the nuts and used mostly walnuts and a few almonds.  I bought a new silicone pastry brush to apply the melted butter (ended up using 3 sticks) and it worked great.  I also tried a pizza cutter for slicing but thought the knife worked just about as well.  The baklava takes a while to put together, but is not difficult.  Totally worth the time and effort.  Thanks!

This was fantastic.  I'll admit that I was a little intimidated to try this as I have never worked with Phyllo before and heard nightmares.  This was a breeze (albeit time consuming) and absolutely fantastic!  I have a family member from Greece who makes this for us and this is every bit as good (or betther) than hers!
I followed the recipe exactly and took others' advice to make the syrup first and let cool before pouring over the hot baklava.  It remained crispy on top even the next day! My in laws love baklava and went crazy for this recipe.

I will make often.  Thanks for sharing!

SOOOOOOooooooooo good!! very easy to do, but it is time consuming.. I had friends dropping in at my place for days just to get an other bite! I made them from walnuts and almonds, but next time i'll try almond and pistachios. And I really didn't find them to be too sweet like some reviewers mentionned..

This recipe was amazing! I made it for a Greek themed dinned party that we had this weekend.  I was a bit hestitant on trying a recipe that I had never used but it was fabulous.  The guests enjoyed it more than any other baklava they've had in restaurants because it wasn't as sweet.  Highly reccomend this recipe...bravo!

Wow! I was already making a Greek feast for my friends and thought - gee, wouldn't some baklava be a perfect finish? But I'd heard it was hard so I logged on to my trusty allrecipes to check - NOT! A little fiddley but not hard. And my phyllo pastry had been in the freezer for too long so it was very fragile. So my assembly involved layering many broken pieces - but you'd never know looking at the finished product. Oh and I made it by the original receipe and wouldn't change a thing. It was a big hit! There's not much left but I think I'll have a piece for breaky :)

I have made this for many functions!  It always gets rave reviews and EVERYONE always asks for the recipe!  It is very easy, but a little time consuming.  I even made this for a party I went to the night my husband deployed to Iraq since everyone was asking for it.  I wanted to give them something they all wanted before they left!
This is a wonderful recipe!!

I melted the butter and used a pastry brush which made it a breeze. I used a pizza cutter to cut the finished pastry before baking, don't knock it it worked great! I chopped up walnuts, pecans, pistachios, and almonds for my nut filling. I also followed other user suggestions and made the honey syrup first to allow it time to cool before pouring over the warm baklava.

I've made this several times for family gatherings, work carry-ins, and even for a bake sale at my sons school. It comes out perfect every time. I always add the lemon zest to the sauce, as suggested. Very excellent recipe.

I was looking for an International dessert I could make for the county fair and came across this one and I remembered making a similar one in high school. It turned out beautifully, so I took it to the fair and when all was said and done it received a trophy! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I have made baklava many times before, this was the first with this recipe. I found the measurements to be off and the temperature of the oven was a little too hot. I know all ovens are different. Other than those two issues it turned out fine. Tasted as it should.

I don't think I cooked the syrup long enough because mine was soggy also.  I waited until the next day and when it still didn't set I tossed it back into the oven on 350 for about 10 minutes.  That fixed the problem... I found it to be too sweet also.  It took away from the flavor of it.

This was a great recipe!!  To temper sweetness (the reason I rarely eat baklava) I used half honey and half heavy whipping cream like another reviewer suggested.  This really made a difference.  Also, I used spun honey...better than the standard alternative!

You can't screw this up. I fudged on every ingredient..just eye-balled everything without measuring. Used pecans/walnuts/almonds. Also added some lemon juice to the syrup. Totally delicious, and quite easy. Mine browned quite a bit more than the photo suggests- ok though, good flavor, and not burned. I will make this again.

I only made half the recipe, since I was only cooking for two. I had no honey, used heavy cream in place of the honey, and loved it! Made is more savory and less sweet, since baklava often overdoes on the sweetness. I also skipped nuts, my husband has an allergy. Use cinnamon and nutmeg, and use unsalted butter. Last 5 minutes of baking I sliced a banana on top, was wonderful. Drizzled the sugar/water/milk/vanilla over the hot baklava...absolutely delicious!

Very easy to make, and tastes WAY better than what most stores sell.  I ground pistachios with a mortar and pestel for the topping (placed on after baking) and used almonds, hazelnuts, and fancy pecans as filler.  Cut the pieces before I baked, and made sure the sugar mixture was cool before topping the baklava right out of the oven.

Definitely a keeper!!

Wow, if I had known baklava was this easy to make, I would've been making it years ago.  I'm no expert pastry cook, and the phyllo was not very forgiving - but the taste was just as good as the expensive baklava you get at the bakery.

One review suggested cooking the sugar/honey mixture first.  But with the baklava baking for 50 minutes; I found that was enough time to boil sugar and water and simmer with the honey and vanilla for 20 minutes.

FABULOUS!  EASY!!!
tips:
1) spray bottle of butter mentioned by another reviewer makes buttering the phyllo much easier, and requires much less butter than recipe calls for
2)  make syrup first and let cool as others have suggested
3) i only used 3/4 of phyllo because my stack was getting really high, and it was still really good

I am a very inexperienced in the kitchen and i made this with no problem.  It was time consuming. I would let the phyllo dough thaw and used it without a damp cloth. The dough gets very hard to work with if its too damp.  I also made the syrup exactly as listed and it was VERY sweet but good.

This is a great recipe!  My 14 year old daughter made it for a class project earlier this year, now I am going to add it to my holiday baking. Thanks!

I learned to make bakalava many years ago from a Turkish boyfriend.  He made it similar than this, but used only sugar and water for the syrup, and no cinnamon.  I made it that way for years, and then I tried this recipe.  This recipe is good, but I think I like it better the original way I learned to make it.  Simpler flavor, but very rich as well.  Also, my friend said it was imperative to use pistachios for the nuts, and I always do.  This recipe is delicious though.

This sure impressed my man. I didn't change a thing and found the dough not too difficult to work with. Make sure to keep it covered with a damp tea towel and work gently and quickly. I made the honey syrup first so it would cool. It was just the right amount. Next time I will chop the walnuts up a litter more. Thanks for this great recipe.

Just took these out of the oven...my house smells better than divine!  My 11 yr. old and I tried just a little edge and we can't believe how good it is!  I'm anxious to try them again once it cools down and the syrup soaks in.  I did alot of research on this recipe and an authentic syrup has some lemon peel boiled with the water and sugar.  I did it and it's delish!

This recipe is good, although I sprinkled cinnamon sugar between the layers w/butter, added 1/2 cup sugar to the nut mixture and added 1/2 cup more honey, water and sugar to the sauce, poured the hot sauce over the hot baklava and let set overnight on top of the stove uncovered. It was great, there was plenty of gooey sauce and it soaked into the layers.(If you prefer a less sweet version leave out the extra sugar in the nuts and between the layers) Yummy!

The recipe makes for very sweet baklava. I recommend adjusting it according to your taste. However, it turned out beautiful and delicious. I brought it to a cooking club and everyone was raving about how it looked and tasted like it was from a Greek bakery! It's also pretty labor-intensive, with the multiple layers and additional care one has to take when working with phyllo. Overall, it was worth it. Oh, also, I added other kinda of nuts including my fave pistachios. Yum!

this is so easy and turns out great. everyone always thinks i got it at the store or as a gift or something when i make it. i usually use a mix of walnuts pecans and hazelnuts, and sometimes if i have enough, just add tons of nuts. however i have to up the sauce by a lot when i do that or else it's kind of dry. its fun to experiment, no matter what i do it's yummy.

I made baklava for the first time and they came out great.  It did take a long time to chop the nuts. So I took the advice of someone else who wrote a review and smashed them with a ladel (the nuts were placed in a ziploc bag). That made it much easier.  Next time I will try using the spray butter instead to reduce calorie....but great recipe.

I made this for my bf's birthday and this recipe is AWESOME! It is very, very easy. This was my first time making baklava, and also my first time working with phyllo. I was nervous because I read some horror stories about how hard it was and one recipe I read said they recommended not even attempting it, just buy it. But I'm stubborn and no matter what anybody said I was making it :) . My bf and I did it together and it came out wonderful. This Baklava is not for someone who likes it very sweet, like me, but I was told I have a sweet tooth that could kill an elephant. Everybody loved it and they loved that it wasn't as sweet. 
My sauce for the top was about the consistency of water, maybe a little thicker. I don't know if it was supposed to be thicker or what so that had me nervous. Anyway it is great! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

This was amazing.  My husband couldn't stay out of it, eating it hot and flaky out of the pan. For my small family I halved this recipe and used an 8x8 square baking dish.  I used less than half of the phyllo, but am saving the rest for fried feta.  I was concerned at first about halving the amounts, but it came out amazing. I used walnuts and almonds because they were on sale, but might make with pistahcios as a great gift.

Wonderful!  I had made a different baklava recipe years ago, and decided to try again for a New Years Eve party.  Recipe was very simple, although it does take a little time.  Following some other recommendations, I made 1 1/2 times the syrup, and it's really too much ... next time, I'll stick to the recipe as written!  Tastes wonderful, but probably shouldn't be quite so moist!

Excellent!  Everybody liked this recipe.  I followed recipe and only had to use half of the phylo and half of the nuts.  I was surprised to see such little cinnamon used so I added a tsp of cinnamon to the syrup while cooking.  I would also use an additional tablespoon of nuts for each layer next time.  But still wonderful tasting.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort.  Thoughts: Next time I will probably try to score the baklava and then cut it after it comes out of the oven (as suggested by Mark Bittman). I also recommend having a second person to help with the assembly.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. This is so worth the time it takes to put together. It's not hard at all, just need to invest about an hour to put it all together. But delicious! Will definitely make over  and over again.

Wow. This recipe is definately a keeper. I am very impressed. I never thought that I could make Baklava, but this recipe proved me wrong. I used melted butter and applied to the sheets with a pastry brush- I used about 1.5 cups of butter. I like the idea of pulverizing the nuts in a food processor first- I may do that next time. The honey sauce is fabulous. I used salted butter, and it was perfect- it gave it a lot of extra flavor. Mmmmm.... Baklava. Mmmmmm...

I held a Greek dinner party last week, and this was one of the sweets - a huge success.   One thing to warn English cooks about - it is better to use UNSALTED butter, rather than the salted we usually use in England. I never found out if it freezes well - all left overs were demolished by my grandsons when they came next day!

Now I never have to order expensive baklava from gourmet shops again!  I also added some sugar to the nuts like some of the other posters suggested.  It turned out perfectly and even my husband (who generally hates baklava) loved it!

Excellent!  I'd never made baklava before (though I loved to eat it), and my husband gave me the ultimate compliment:  "It looks exactly like my grandma used to make."  (He's Lebanese.)  He said that it tasted even better!  I used all walnuts, as I was making a Greek dinner and that's the customary nut to use in that part of the world.

I had a party and made this for dessert. I added another ½ pound of nuts and added 3 TBS more cinnamon, I also added 3 TBS of sugar to the nut mix.  It turned out great.  I served it with a little vanilla ice cream, as it was my b-day.  People were asking if they could order it and have me make it for them again.  Great recipe.  Far easier than I would have imagined.

This was my first attempt at making baklava.  I needed a middle eastern dish for a book club.  This was a HUGE hit with the ladies.  I had compliments from everybody saying it was the best baklava ever.  I liked that it didn't have as much sugar and butter as other recipes do so the pieces don't ooze so much filling.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I did think that the sauce was a little too much (volume) but the longer it sat, the better (and less messy) it got.  I think this may have been my fault because I didn't boil it quite long enough.  Warning:  this stuff is too good to have around when you are on a diet!!

I have eaten lots of Baklava and watched my father make it before, but never made it myself. I have to say, this recipe nails it! I added a little rose water to the honey mixture because I heard that makes it better. It was great, I took half the batch to a clients house and left the other half for my roommates, who stopped me dead in my tracks next time they saw me and told me it was the best thing they have ever eaten in their life. I just grinned. If you want a classic and delicious baklava, this is the one. Oh yeah, I was a little heavy on the butter, i ran out and had to melt more. Don't get the phyllo soaked with butter, the honey mix will do the honors on that.

I think this is the best holiday recipe I now own. I love it, I love it, I love it.
I have been making fudge, sugar cookies and more for Christmas gifts. This is the only one that I cannot stop eating. I made extra sugar/honey sauce as some others suggested, but ended up not using the extra. It is perfect just the way it is. Oh, I did use 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans.

I made this exactly as written and it was great. I melted the butter and used a pastry brush. I also ground up walnuts in my grandma's old nut grinder (dump the nuts in the plastic top, crank the handle till they all end up in the glass jar below) and the texture was terrific. I've always struggled with phyllo dough - it always seems to stick together, but this time I used the Safeway Select brand and it worked perfectly.

This recipe was good, but not great.  

First, I used toasted nuts (pistachios), which was a mistake because they were over-toasted at the end.  I would use raw nuts in the future and see how that turns it.

The baklava were soggy, so I would incorporate the suggestions of other to pour warm syrup on cooler baklava and then put immediately on individual serving papers (paper cupcake cups)

My phyllo ended up overly browned, so I would watch it more carefully if I were to make it again.

I changed the number of layer of phyllo per the suggestions of others and that worked well.

Despite my issues with this receipe, my husband and father were impressed.

This recipie worked out great.  The first time I tried it I did not have the almonds available so I made it with chopped apples, and this was also amazing.  I added 1 cup honey instead of 1/2 cup to thicken the sauce a bit because the apples will provide more liquid.  Cook times were almost the same, possibly a bit longer.  When making the nut variety, the 1 pound of nuts may be a bit much.  Don't forget to apply the butter and to cut the dish before baking.  I have made this dish several times and the cuts are esential before baking; I found out the hard way.

This desert were great with an italian meal, but I eventually hope to try it with a Greek dish.

The baklava's texture was ruined once I added the syrup. I even followed another person's advice about adding hot syrup to cooled baklava but it was still too soggy and I didn't even add all of the syrup. I will not be making this again since it is too time consuming and the results just weren't comparable to the bakery that I would get it from. 

Thanks anyways. :)

My hubby was soooo impressed! I made a couple of changes. I put some sugar in the nut mixture
and I added more sauce than the recipe calls for(about a third extra of the sauce recipe). I didn't have any problems with it getting soggy because I poured the cooled sauce over the hot baklava as a reviewer suggested. The only future change I'll make is I'll add a few extra phyllo sheets on the top layer.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out pretty looking. I also heavily buttered each layer of philo dough but it was still very difficult to cut. Nobody in the house seemed to like it except for me.

Delicious.  I used tips from other users and used a pastry brush to butter the dough.  Took a little more time than I thought, but was so very worth it.  I will be using this again and again.  Rave reviews from family !!

I've made this for my husband to take to work three times, and people can't stop talking about it!  They think I'm a genius in the kitchen... so easy, fun, and rewarding.  I will have a hard time paying for store-bought baklava again, knowing how easy it is to make.

I thought this came out good for my first try, but it seemed that something was missing. I ended up using only walnuts, and next time I would crush them a lot more because i dont like little peices in my mouth. for some reason though i couldnt get the top layer to stay down after it baked the top layer kept sliding off.

Amazingly easy and tastes great!  Just like the kind I've bought.  Added more honey than called for though; would try to make more syrup next time so that it would soak further up to the top levels as well.

This recipe was excellent.  My baklava was also soggy at the bottom, though.  I'll take the advice of another reviewer and make the syrup first so that it is sufficiently cooled before pouring it over the baklava when it comes out the oven.  My chopped nuts were a little too big, also.  I will use store bought chopped nuts next time, instead of hand chopping my own, since I don't own a food processor.  Otherwise, this recipe was a success.  Even my picky seven year old daughter, who says she doesn't like nuts, liked it.

Unfortunately, this was anything but easy, and I never have a problem with recipes. Perhaps it was just the phillo, but it kept coming apart whilst being buttered. When baking, the top few layers curled up-- even after I spooned the sauce (which will pull your teeth out quite easily), the layers still fall apart. The flavors are all there, but it just physically doesn't come together. Sorry.

I took this to a party last night and every one liked it -- I didn't bring home a single piece.  I used walnuts (bought them already chopped saving time.  

And, if I can do it any one can -- I am not a baker (tend to be more of a chinese cook and wok everything).  

The secret is learning how to spread the butter on the dough and after a couple of tries I found using my wooden wok spatula (the spatula is curved) as a paint brush workeed best. 

Thank you Ms. Townsend!

UNBELIEVEABLY EASY!!! First time using phyllo dough,and it went smoothly. It is time consuming,but well worth the wait. I used pistachios,and they were awesome!! Instead of shelling a pound of pistachios,I bought a 1 lb bag of kernels,so it saved me more time. EXCELLENT recipe..I will be making it again and I'm just thrilled I don't have to buy it at the bakery anymore! Thanks a million!!!

Fabulous! I make an assortment with different types of nuts for my coworkers every year for the holidays and it's a wonderful unique alternative to cookies (and lasts longer too!). I tend to use fewer nuts than the recipe calls for and add a few extra layers of phyllo and butter, but you really can't go wrong no matter the ratio!

I too doubled the sauce and added cloves to the nuts, but I found that the bottom got quite soggy.  No one seemed to mind the sogginess as the flavor was phenomenal.  Will definitely use again and share with others.

Excellent recipe! Next time I'll make sure to chop the nuts into even smaller pieces.

Very simple recipe. I think the baking time could be reduced by 5-10 minutes.  My pan is very brown, and the nuts are a little more toasted than I would like. I added ground cloves to my batch and I think I will stick with cinnamon only next time. Still, yummier than my local bakery!

This baklava was a little soggy in the bottom layers but I still loved the taste.  I had a little trouble working with the phyllo, partly because I got so nervous while handling the phyllo after reading the previous reviews.  It's amazingly easy and made me feel like a professional chef.

This was SUPER easy!  The first two reviews were extremely helpful and my results were perfect!  Make the sauce first and let it cool while the baklava is in the oven. Don’t stress over folds in the layers of phyllo, they are amazingly crispy when baked.  ??

Fantastic recipe. First time making it and I received rave reviews even from someone who said they didnt care for baklava. I used pistachios for the nuts to get the sweetness. The rest was as written.  Thank you for posting.

This was really good. I made it on a Friday for dinner on Saturday (in the winter). Seemed just a wee bit dry on Saturday. When we had it again on Sunday it seemed more moist (?) I would increase the moisture just a wee bit by maybe simmering the sugar-honey mixture for only 10 min rather than 20. Will make again though!

I haven't made this in about 25 years.  This is a great recipe and will be making it again very soon.  It is time consuming,  but so worth it!  I had some issues with the Filo but mainly because I was in a rush and my Filo dough was not completely thawed.  Always best to plan ahead and have everything ready.  However, little rips in the dough aside, it turned out awesome!  I took some to a dinner party and they were gobbled up so fast!   I used walnuts but not the full amount listed in the recipe.  And pouring the honey mixture over the baklava right after it came out of the oven was crazy; it was sizzling and steaming and I thought, this is too much liquid!  But I poured the whole amount all over the 9 x 11 pan and it just absorbed!  So yummy!  I think it will go smoother next time, will plan ahead to allow my dough to thaw!

I am Greek and have made many, many, pans of baklava!  This recipe is very good!  I did omit the vanilla as I've never put it in before.  Next time I make it,  I'll add it.  I also tossed in a couple cinnamon sticks and 5-6 whole cloves in the syrup while it was simmering for extra flavor.   I did add 1/2 t ground cloves to the nut mixture.  Just gives the baklava some extra flavor.

Simply amazing! I have loved baklava since I first tried it as a child in Florida. I was afraid that this recipe would not capture the flavor that I love. Instead it was spot on. Such a perfect and perfectly simple recipe. Rave reviews from me.

I’ve made this 3 times now over the years and as I just finished the last piece after making this last batch over two weeks ago, I have come to appreciate how this baklava only gets better with age. I made it the day before Christmas and it was very good fresh and after guests left I was left with still quite a few pieces. I was worried how to store it properly, so it sat out another day then I moved it to the fridge for about a week while continuing to munch on it. Even in the fridge they were still crispy on the tops and bottoms and the center was moist and slightly chewy. So good. When I ran out of room in the fridge I just sat it back out on the counter for almost another week until while I slowly made it disappear.  The first two times I made it exactly as written but with pecans. These turned out great and I took them to work on a few separate pot luck occasions where everyone raved about it. This Christmas batch I wanted to try different things and ended up using tips from several reviewers on here and I also used a few from the Athena brand phillo dough, which is the brand I used. I used a 1lb package of slivered almonds that I toasted first, added maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup homemade brown sugar, (from this site) zest of one lemon and a pinch of cloves to the nut mixture. I found that not cutting clear through to the bottom but stopping about 1/2” above kept the sugar liquid from pooling at the bottom therefore there was no need to make a double batch of that. Excellent!!

More explanation needed in the amount of butter in the layers. While mine was delicious,  was a bit too airy for my expectations.  To that end, i didn't use the whole 16oz of phyllo, so i would have needed more butter.  Additionally,  despite stating 2-3 tbsp of the nut mix in the layers,  i think i went heavy thinking more coverage was better.  I think  this was why mine  lacked density. I'll repeat, totally tasty and I'll be more deliberate when I make it again.

I've been making Baklava for Christmas for 30 years.  One of my family's favorites!  A couple tips.  Don't chop the nuts too fine.  If you do, the baklava will have sandy texture.   I use about 1.5-2 lb mix of pecans, almonds and walnuts.   

I add about 1/4 sugar to the nuts.  I also add about 1/8 teaspoon of finely ground clove or I'll add a whole clove to the sauce and remove before I pour over the baklava.  Finally, I add a bit of lemon zest or teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce.

I make this each Christmas and everyone raves about it. I followed the advice of the others and make 1 and a 1/2 x the sauce. I mix pecans, almonds and walnuts together, lightly roast in the oven and add sugar and cinnamon to the nuts. Once it’s cut it stores great in the freezer.

I've made it several times, using the "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" sprayer. Uses less butter [fewer calories...as if we care when eating baklava...] and provides easier application of the butter. I keep the sprayer in hot water to keep the butter liquid. Placing newspaper around the baking dish helps catch overspray. Avoid cutting to the bottom of the pan until after it is baked!
 I like this recipe because it's not too sweet, but I'm going to experiment to achieve more of a honey flavor than this recipe yields.

Good but I have had better. Syrup is too thin. Dips as you are eating it.

What happened?  1lb of chopped nuts was way overkill. I even did like 6tbsp it nuts between layers and ended up with like 75% of nuts left. The way it described it, I still had half my phyllo dough left. The butter was used up. Was this meant to make 2 batches and I used up too much butter?  Also, the baklava was about to burn at about 25-30 min. The syrup was runny too, but maybe will thicken when it cools later. 2 stars because it appears edible.

I followed the recommendation of many and made the syrup ahead of time and allowed it to cool on the stove while I prepared the baklava and I added 2 tsps. of orange blossom water to the syrup. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T and everyone at work and at home raved about how wonderful the baklava was. Truly delicious! Thank you.

My son asks for this for his birthday every year (use to be cheesecake) now I make the day before I am not great at following directions so I am glad this is forgiving as far as phyllo is considered.. A rip here or there no big deal is is covered and a wrinkle no big deal. I can never get the cutting  down where you do not go all the way through but no one complains.. I have used walnuts each time but this year is will be different maybe pistachios My son loves them so why not. I never cover the sheets I find that the hardest part. I move fast. Others have said they but the "I cant believe it not butter" and use the bottle. I think I will just but a small spray bottle instead.. it is the best Baklava I have ever made and my son loves it.. Thanks for the recipe.

Holy cow, I love this recipe! I did follow the advice of a couple other reviews and tweaked it just a bit. I bumped the sugar sauce up to 1 1/2 times the recipe. I used two sticks of butter rather than one.  I pulsed my walnuts in a food processor rather than chopping them. I also used a really great tip from another reviewer. I emptied out a bottle of I Can’t Believe it’s Not Butter spray into a bowl and put my melted butter into the spray bottle. Spraying the butter on rather than brushing it made assembly super quick and easy.  Once I was finished, I just refilled it with the spray butter.  It turned out so wonderful!  I will definitely be making this many more times.

My grandma once described baklava to me as she had it in Russia and Greece, and for her birthday, I decided to make her a batch. I’d never done it before, so I wasn’t sure how hard it’d be, but it ended up being fairly simple, so long as you followed the recipe. When I went to check on it a few minutes before it was supposed to be done, let me tell you, the kitchen smelled AMAZING!

This is my third time making this recipe. Love it & keep coming back to this one. I agree as I read in some of the other reviews that the simple syrup mixture is a little watery..  I just  added  a quarter cup more sugar  and let it reduce down for an extra five minutes . It's my most favorite baklava recipe. It's a big hit at our office.

I could only leave this in the oven for 40 minutes at most, before the tops started to burn. The second and third times I made it, I cut the amount of white sugar by about a quarter and used about half to three quarters the amount of butter called for, with no detriment to taste.

I had no idea what i was doing. This is my first time making baklava. I halved the recipe and put it in a meatloaf pan (Meatloaf Pans are approx 9 3/8 inches long, 5 1/4 inches wide)  It still came out perfect. unbelievable.  It was actually really simple and everyone was very convinced I was a culinary genius.

Increase the nuts if you want to stick to two sheets of phyllo per layer. I may try to just butter the layers and then sprinkle the nuts unbuttered by hand. They are hard to spread and my mixture ran out about half way through. Also, mine was done in 40 minutes rather than 50 at 350 degrees F. Delicious!

Made this treat before the holidays and shared with a variety of family members that we visited. The people that enjoyed it the most were the ones who knew what Baklava was. They were very excited about it and appreciated the delicious and rarely home made treat.

I’ve made this recipe three times now, and it’s always a huge hit. I follow the advice of making the syrup in advance and letting it cool before pouring it on the hot baklava, but I’ll try hot syrup next time just out of curiosity to see how it turns out. I’ve always used chopped pecans, but next time I’d like to try pistachios. I also add a cinnamon stick to the syrup. This stuff is amazing.

I screwed up but it was still good. I forgot the huge layer of phyllo on top, but this is so sweet and rich I could do without the huge top layer anyway. I added lemon zest to the topping and added a few shakes of nutmeg to the cinnamon mixed with the nuts. My first time so at least now I know how to do it.

I have been on a quest for the best baklava I can find/make and this recipe is great! I do use 1 cup honey  and 1/2 cup of sugar instead. Also, tip for the phyllo dough, keep your house cold and dry and work fast. Make sure your other ingredients are ready before you take the phyllo dough out of the refrigerator and set up an assembly line to put it all together. I also make the butter almost melted so it spreads quick with minimal issues with the phyllo dough. It's not as scary to make as people think!

I’m sorry. I’ve made baklava before but couldn’t find my old recipe so I followed this one. Proportions completely wrong. Bake phyllo dough at 350?? Madness. It’s a thin sheet! I burned my whole dessert halfway through the bake time! Doesn’t specify the nuts to use, uses half the honey syrup mixture you are supposed to. This recipe is a flop and ruined me and my girlfriends evening. Do not follow.

This is what I was looking for.  I made it for my husband only because we bought some from the store and I told him that it was horrible.  So, I made this for him and now I need to make it almost weekly.  The only problem I have is that there were too many nuts for me.  I’m going to try maybe half the nuts it calls for.

I have never tasted Baklava better than this!  I needed about 3 Tbsp more butter to cover the sheets of phyllo.  Also, I increased the sauce by 1/2 and it all absorbed perfectly.  One flavor improvement was to switch out about 1/4 cup of water for lemon juice.  I like the slight lemony tang that I have tasted in other recipes.  Divine!

I've been making this for years but never rated it.  My daughter's Lebanese graduate classmates were shocked that an American made the closest to their own country's  dessert they'd ever tasted!  As others did, I increased the sauce by 50% and made it a day earlier so to cool if thoroughly.  It's imperative to add the cool sauce immediately after removing the hot dish from the oven.  If not, allow the dessert to cool completely and then pour on very hot liquid mixture.  This wonderful dish occupies a page in my family's traditional recipe book.  Thank you for your recipe and all the reviews!  Oh, SO important is the type of honey!  My favorite is wildflower, followed by clover.  I've tried others but strongly recommend those two.

Used less water for the syrup the 2nd time I made it, and it was better. My family loved it. Will continue to make it with the change.

This is a wonderful recipe! I did make a few changes, but not many. I did add a little bit of cardamom as well as a few strips of orange rind to the syrup for extra flavor. Also, I did as many others suggested and added my cold syrup to my hot out of the oven Baklava. It is absolutely delicious!

I made this as my first ever attempt at baklava. I modified this to be nut-free since we have serious tree nut allergies in the family. I cleaned the flesh off of butternut squash and pumpkin seeds, then dried them and tossed them in a little olive oil and a pinch of salt. I spread them out on a sheet lined with parchment paper and put them in the oven on 275F. I actually did these seeds separately on different days for my own convenience, so the smaller butternut squash seeds were ready in about 13 minutes, whereas the pumpkin seeds needed closer to 20 minutes. I also added a few sunflower seeds since I had them and chopped everything making a good 1 cup portion. I was incredibly pleased with how these turned out! It was definitely a labor of love with the additional steps of scooping out seeds and roasting them, but it was worth it to have this treat in our home! You could always use your favorite commercially prepared roasted seeds. 

I myself have no food allergies, so I have eaten traditional baklava many times and can honestly report that the switch to seeds does not really impact the taste or texture of this dessert. It's the dough and the syrup that are the true backbone here! 

Excellent recipe. At one time, I would have found the idea of making my own baklava intimidating, but this recipe made it very accessible.

I’ve made it twice. Both times I did not  use even close to the amount of butter - and ended up with delicious, not-soggy baklava. I sprinkled nuts more frequently between the layers than recipe said. Otherwise I would have had too much left at the end. Update: made it 4 times. I use 3/4 cup butter, 4 cups chopped nuts (pistachios, almonds, walnuts, pea cans). Don’t rush the phyllo dough thawing process, and don’t let it sit open or it will dry and break up.

I make half a recipe. followed exactly like this recipe required. baked for 50 minutes and it turned delicious. A little too sweet to our liking. 
I will certainly do it again, but to reduce the sugar by half and reduce the butter by 1/4. I will report if that's going to be OK.

This recipe was outstanding in so many ways. Having never made baklava before I was anxious about working with phyllo dough. But if you follow the directions on the box, I used Athens, it was a breeze. And I followed these 2 tips others have written 1. roast the nuts - I used walnuts and almonds and 2. make  1 1/2 cups of sauce. I did add 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves & 2 tsps. of granulated sugar to the nuts after roasting. I also added 3 large strips of lemon skin, 1 cinnamon stick, 5 whole cloves & 1/4 tsp of salt to the sauce along with the other ingredients.  This added so much flavor. It baked perfectly at 350 for 50 minutes in the bottom third of the oven;  but I’m sure it varies based on your oven.  It was a hit at the dinner party and not a crumb left on the plate. Wonderful recipe and it is now in my keeper file!

First time making baklava.  Easy to make and tastes great!  I used a mixture of walnuts (1/3) and pistachios (2/3). I also love vanilla so I used 1 tbsp vs the recipe of 1 tsp. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great!

Easy recipe to follow and make.  I sprinkled the top with a little of the remaining chopped nuts after pouring the sugar, vanilla and honey mixture on top.   Was delicious and was the hit of the party.  Will add a bit more cinnamon to the nuts next time.

Not too difficult to make if you can manage the dough. I used 1 cup of honey instead of 1/2 and it came out beautifully. The family absolutely loved it! This would be fantastic with vanilla ice cream

Was a huge hit with my family, and the phyllo wasn't nearly as terrifying as I had been told! I mistakenly used a full cup of honey **make sure to use 1/2 cup** otherwise it just tastes like straight honey. I also added some lemon juice and orange zest to the sauce which add some more dimension it was a great additive.

This recipe has been a big hit! I'd always wanted to make baklava but it wasn't until about 2 months ago that I got around to it, just because my aunt got phyllo dough instead of pastry sheets and I decided it was a sign haha! I only make one layer of nuts and then one of the top layers I just sprinkle cinnamon before finishing with the las 4 sheets. I used macadamia nuts the first time, but the last 3 times I've used walnuts. It's delicious, everyone loves it both room temp or fridge-cold. Thank you for sharing it!

I made this for my fiance on Fathers Day. He loved it so much. The pastry is crispy, the honey syrup is spot on....the only changes I made is that I added extra walnuts and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon.

I absolutely love baklava and thanks to this recipe, now I can make my own. I get requests for this all the time now. I have made a few changes from the original to suit my family and friends, but this recipe as written is AMAZING! Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time making baklava. We usually order a 9x13 tray from a local bakery. I am so happy I tried this recipe. I followed the recipe exact. I didn't have any issues. The baklava wasn't as sweet as the store bought but that's a great thing it was just right! I used the no name brand called select from my local jewel osco store. I also did cut the phyllo in half it fit perfectly that way. It turned out the perfect color and crunchy ! I am not a cook or baker so I am very pleased with how easy this recipe was.    The only issue I had was when I was cutting the dough it would move alot but don't worry about that because ones it's baked and your pour your sauce on it's not noticeable and the top layer can be flaked off if you need.    I also probably put a few extra layers on top as I had extra sheets and it worked out well  :) my hubby told me to make tea tonight because he is excited to try the baklava !

For awhile now baking is something that has really interested me and I’ve been trying a lot of different recipes. I thought that now it was time to spice things up and try something different and more challenging such as making baklava. I assume the idea that baklava was remarkably hard to make was a fabrication seeing as how easy this recipe makes it seem, it’s so simple! I will definitely make sure to try this recipe even though it was not the challenge I was looking for, I can’t resist, they look too delicious! Plus judging from the reviews this seems like a fantastic recipe. I can’t wait to try it out!

I had never made or even tasted Baklava and never worked with fillo dough. My wife likes it so I thought I'd give it a shot. The only change I made was to make the sauce first and refrigerate it while I put the baklava together and baked it. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I tried it shortly after I made it and found it to be dry. The next day was very different, the sauce had found it's way all the way through and was moist but not soggy. What a difference a day makes. I had people who have had baklava critique it, only to tell me it's perfect. Excellent recipe, thanks to the author.   : )

My first time making this & it turned out amazing! I used 2 boxes of fillo dough though just to get all the layers in. It was very easy to work with & my 9 year old daughter loved helping! I can’t wait to experiment adding different things to this recipe. This makes me want to book a trip to Santorini! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I've made this exactly as it said many times and it always turns out great. Everyone's mouths' water when I bring this out to eat at any occasion and they think I am a master chef for it. I've met very few people who do not like baklava and it is usually due to a distaste for honey......but if you like honey even a little bit make this to see just how good it can be. It is the one of the greatest desert I've ever tasted and we have a few true chefs in my family who agree. Do yourself a favor and make this recipe you will be surprised.....and feel free to drizzle some melted chocolate over the squares in the morning.

Easy peazy.  Followed some of the more popular reviews and all went fine. Made the sugar/water mixture first and put it in the fridge.  Ground the mixed nuts in the food processor - just pulse smaller quantities until you reach the consistency you want.  Tasty and surprisingly easy to make. The effort is really just all the prep. Will absolutely make it again.

I've been making this for many years now and it hasn't failed me yet.  It's absolutely perfect! 
Crisp, buttery layers with the sweet taste of honey.  Mmmm!  The recipe does not state the kind of nuts to use, but I prefer walnuts.   I've also found that it works best to make the honey sauce first and set aside.   This bakes faster than you think.  The bake time says 50 min., but mine is usually crisp and golden brown in about 35 - 40 minutes.

Super easy, very good. I did add 1 Tbs of lemon zest and a squeeze of the lemon to the syrup. Also added  1/2  tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the nuts.

I made this last night after being tired of spending $16 on 8 pieces at a local Greek restaurant...it is soooo good! I took the advice of other reviewers and made the syrup first to put the cold syrup over the hot baklava and it worked great. I also did make 1.5 of syrup and only cut part of the way through for it to all soak in. It tasted amazing and I no longer have to spend a ton of money on baklava!

I NEED MORE STARS. This is DELICIOUS!!! A couple things: I used pecans for the nuts. To save time on chopping I put a cup or so at a time in my blender and pulse a few times until it was crumb-sized. Not a powder, but small pieces for sure. Also, this was my first time using fillo dough, and they're not kidding when they say to use a damp cloth. NOT damp paper towels, ya'll. RIP, three sheets of fillo.

Loved it and so did everyone else!  It is very time consuming to make and can be difficult layering all the fillo dough but well worth it to make at least once. I did a mixture of chopped walnuts and pistachios. Make sure the nuts are not salted. I put the nuts in a food processor to really make the pieces on the smaller side.

I made this today for the first time. As a newbie, I made some mistakes. However, even with the mistakes, it was delicious! Husband and coworkers said it was best they ever had and that was with mistakes. So, learn from my mistake. 1. Don’t forget to cut it prior to baking. I had to cut it after and it made them not so pretty. 2. Make sure you have nuts. I only had pecans so I put them in a freezer bag and pounded them down but tasted great. 3. Make sure you have cinnamon. I didn’t have any cinnamon but I did have apple pie seasoning and it tasted good. 4. I only had 3/4 C white sugar so I added 1/4 brown sugar to equal the 1 C needed.

I finally decided to try a recipe for baklava. Wow, with this recipe and all the tips by fellow bakers, I found it to be amazing!! A bit labor intensive, but absolutely worth the time. I shared some with my BFF and froze some. It freezes great and defrosts in no time. Thank you for sharing. Will definitely make this for the holidays!

This is the best Bakalava recipe I have come across. It is a hit whenever I make it and is gone by the end of the day. I use pecans and like the sauce runny as it really soaks in the the pastry. Best recipe! I have people constantly asking for the recipe.

I have made this recipe last week and my friends loved it. I made it again today but added shredded cooked jackfruit in the second layer in between the first and last layers. Jackfruit is an asian fruit , you can buy them in asian markets in can. I drained the liquid and used this liquid as part of the syrup. I used two or three pieces and shredded them and cooked them in the same liquid about half a cup of jackfruit syrup  till they are soft. cooked and tender. Delicious! I will call it  Persian Baklava with Asian twist LOL!

This was definitely an easy-to-prepare dessert. I used a 7x11 baking dish and so a single phyllo sheet folded in half fit perfectly (adjust baking time to 35-40 mins). I added a bit of nutmeg to the nuts along with the cinnamon (as per a review I read). Also 1.5x the sauce, and added cold as per reviews. It's a rich dish, very sweet, and unless you can find nuts for cheap, is also expensive. I bought from bulk bins, and on sale, and still spend $20 just on nuts.

I made the syrup first like another review suggested. It ended up being too much syrup to where the bottom of the pan was just drowning the baklava. I'll cut down a bit. I also made sure to cover the unused dough with a wet cheesecloth to keep if from drying and flaking. Absolutely delicious!

Followed recipe exactly but only cooked for 40 mins as it was golden and crispy at that time.  Came out excellent.  Crispy, tender, light and juicy.  Very good!

Great recipe! Was a bit time consuming, but overall easy to make. Just a couple suggestions:
-Set the timer for 30 or 40 minutes instead of 50. You may not need the whole time.
-The video recommends putting a damp cloth over the phyllo dough to keep it from drying out. Be careful with this, as the cloth stuck to the dough and ruined the top two sheets.
-I used walnuts, pistachios, and almonds for the nut mixture.  The recipe doesn't specify, but this mixture turned out great!

This turned out so well!! My ESL students loved it, as did my dad and husband. I found it pretty simple to make and i didn't find it as time-consuming as everyone warned me it would be to make. I'm thankful I tried it. I will definitely do it again. I used walnuts for mine. I will say that I baked a 9x13 first then used smaller Pyrex pans (? Maybe 4x7 or so) for the others. It did not bake as well in the smaller ones and because I didn't realize it wouldn't, I baked for the full amount of time l, which burned them. Definitely stick to the 9x13 or else watch it closer for cooking time adjustments. This was great, though!

This really is easy, and really is good.  It does indeed make people think of you as an expert pastry chef.  Definitely make sure to make the syrup ahead of time so it is cooled when you pour it over top - that is the trick to avoiding a soggy bottom.

This was surprisingly easy and turned out so good. I didn't really like Baklava before this recipe. The next time I make this I would not use all of the sauce it calls for, only because it made the bottom layers very soggy. I would use only half next time. Instead of mixed chopped nuts I just crushed some leftover almond slivers I had in my pantry and it worked really well with the recipe and stayed crunchy.

We tried Greek food for our Christmas dinner, baklava of course had to be dessert!  It was surprisingly easy, though slightly time consuming, for my first try ever.  Followed the recipe exactly, it was amazing!  I tried again with macadamia nuts and pineapple juice instead of water to see how it would work for a Hawaiian party were having later on, it doesn't work haha.  I will be trying with other nuts like almonds in the future though.

This is a great recipe, except that there was just way too much butter. Every sheet of phyllo dough needs to be buttered but not as much as the recipe calls for. I added a spritz of honey between each layer and that made it even more rich. Delicious holiday favorite, I will definitely be bringing this to every Christmas gathering.

It was amazing and easy. I mixed pecans and walnuts and used more than called for. So I upped the amount of cinnamon to compinsate.I also added extra honey to the sauce because it didn't taste sweet enough at first.

This recipe is my go to recipe... no matter what site I visit or even the recipe that is on the Phyllo dough box, the various ingredients used are the same except for the spices! So its a matter of taste.                                                                                  According to a family member when traveling in Greece , Honey that is scented with orange flowers is added depending on the island or mainland. Honey is used as a preservative and to withstand the heat of the out door market stall. The honey syrup used here I scented with grated orange/tangerine rind. I made the syrup first and cooked until thickened and reduced by a third.  Take off heat and  cool.                                                                                                       I do recommend to score all the way through to the bottom.  Once the pastry is out of the oven and before it is cooled... spoon your syrup over the baklava... you'll hear a sizzle!! only spoon enough over the pastry until the sizzling has stopped and each triangle is covered and glistening! You will not used all of the syrup. Store remaining syrup in a mason jar and refrigerate. Use it over french toast! Or sticky buns!  Enjoy...

I made this recipe exactly as it was written as I have never made Baklava before.  It was amazing! It was crunchy and chewy and moist all at the same time.  Before my husband tasted it, I told him it tasted like Christmas :)  I will have no problem making this over and over again!

I used left over filo dough so I halved the recipe in a 6x8 dish. It turned out beautifully. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I might change is not use all the sauce. It was slightly sweeter than I prefer. But absolutely delicious. Next time, I might try adding a few chopped apples and possibly even raisins. Or the other recipe on this site adds lemon zest which also sounds tasty.

I loved it, but instead of using the cinamon and nuts, i just added an extra two layers of the phyllo dough, and it turned out great! I will definetly make it again.

This recipe is WONDERFUL. It's not too sweet and has plenty of room for variation. Speaking of variation, here's what I did:
Instead of expensive blanched almonds ($9.99/lb!) I used 1/2 lb. sunflower seeds and 1/2 lb. chopped walnuts. As for the butter, I only needed less than one stick, so less than half a cup. SO glad I didn't pre-melt that second stick of butter. I also ended up only having to cook the baklava for about half an hour, and I think it's because I used a metal pan instead of glass. The top is crispy and flaky and the bottom is holding together. Given the chance, I'd probably leave it in for a little longer, but I'm happy with how it turned out. I added a tiny bit of lemon juice to the syrup and am pleased with the results. Last but not least, I followed some advice another user posted on here about only cutting the baklava 3/4 of the way down and cutting the rest after it was out of the oven. I do not have the magic touch so this DID NOT WORK FOR ME. It was really difficult to cut the baked baklava IN the pan, but also difficult to transport it FROM the pan and THEN cut it. Luckily I had plenty of time to go slow and make sure I didn't make a mess of things. 

Also, definitely serve in cupcake papers. Definitely.

Mine turned out a bit dry, i think because of my syrup was too thick. To simmer for 20 minutes is too long i guess. Next time i would reduce the boiling time as i prefer it to be more watery.
Also, i added more spices to the nuts (cardamon, nutmeg) and it enhanced the flavour. Otherwise its too plain.

So, my friend was throwing a Greek party and I wanted to keep with the theme and bring a Greek dish.  I have always wanted to make baklava but it just sounded complicated.  I had a box of phyllo dough in the freezer so I decided to just go for it.  This recipe had a ton of 5 star reviews, so I went with it.  I used walnuts but I'd like to try this with pecans, too.  It was SO easy to make; I can't believe I waited so long to make it!  Seriously, the hardest part was waiting for it to cool down so I could try a piece!    I prepared this EXACTLY as the recipe is shown but since I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I halved the recipe.  Next time I will not be halving the recipe.  This is seriously such an amazing dessert.  The party guests were impressed and my family enjoyed it , too. I literally ate it until I was sick.  The honey vanilla sauce you pour on top is to die for.  I will be making this over and over again.  Thank you for such a keeper of a recipe!  FIVE stars all the way!!

This is a fantastic recipe. Someone suggested using a little spray bottle filled with melted butter, I've made it twice and using the spray bottle is a genius idea. Saves so much time in prep. Thanks to everyone for the helpful hints and tips.

This was a great recipe--incredibly tasty. Everyone was raving about it. I made a few changes-I used an 8 oz bag of chopped walnuts and 2/3 of a bag of pecan halves that I blended for 10 seconds. I followed the rest of the recipe as printed.

FAB-U-LUS!!!

I made this with my son. We loved it and it turned out great! We got rave reviews from everyone we gave it to.
Thank you for sharing such a great recipe. You took the mystery out of Baklava. Now we don't have to pay $4.00 for one piece of Baklava from a restaurant.

I love this treat and for all you like me that are allergic to peanuts. Substitute regular mixed nuts for the peanut free variety. It's a little higher but we'll worth it not to miss out on this great desert.

This is a great recipe. Very fast and simple. I did make a several slight changes though. Most important to make syrup first. In cooking time it only needed 40mins instead of the 50. I also used half a lemon instead of  vanilla for the syrup. 1cup sugar, 1cup water, 1cup orange blossom honey,  squeeze 1half of fresh lemon into pot. Simmer  on low heat for 20 to 30 mins let cool completely before you spoon onto baklava. You may not need all of the syrup it is very sweet. Remove baklava immediately  1min after you add syrup, it will stay crisp. I did need more butter than called for, i used half unsalted butter and half  al ghazal vegetable  ghee which you can find at any arab foods market, I also used half a pound walnuts with half pound pecans and two teaspoons of cinnamon for filling. It was unbelievably  yummm!

I made this for a party two days ago and it was the hit of the party.  I've been told that I now have to make it for every party from now on!  Several people told me it was the best they'd ever tasted. I used walnuts, almonds, and a handful of pecans, chopped finely in a good processor. I mixed in 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1 1/2 T cinnamon, and a dash each of nutmeg and cardamom. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the syrup first (I added a bit of lemon zest to it) and chilled it, pouring it over the baklava right after taking it out of the oven. I will definitely be making this often!

I make this for "pot luck" at work, and had so many compliments (actually threats of what would happen if I don't make it). One person said it was better than the one from the local Greek restaurant.  Not sure about that, but it has been a hit every time I make it.  Make sure you take the time to layer it  - I think that is the part that makes it lighter/flakier.  Most times I notice people put more than 2 sheets of dough and fewer layers because it takes a while to do the layers as in the recipe.  (Also, try it with pecans, my husband's favorite.)

Not a huge fans of desserts that have nuts in them, but this was delicious. Primarily made it for my family, but wound up eating quite a bit of it myself. Make sure you store it at room temperature in a closed container and not in the fridge. The honey will preserve it just fine.

Made this lady night and it's good. I'd recommend watching it closely around 40 minutes. I cooked it 40 I was a bit too long. One reviewer recommended cutting the water to a half cup with full cup of honey. That is spot on.  It's better after it sits out over night. Overall a great experience I'll be making again.

Used half pecans and half walnuts toasted; added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg into mix. Also used variety of tips from others cooks: baked at 325 not 350; mixed 1/4 cup of the sugar with nut mixture; changed sauce to 1/2 cup water and 1 cup honey; and should make extra sauce (1/2 times more)

I use chopped walnuts and pecans. My husband is from Eastern Europe and we make this together frequently, he's in charge of laying the dough down as I butter and fill :) It comes together quickly with and extra set of hands. We love this as does his family when we bring it to gatherings.

I went to Greece on my honeymoon a couple of years ago and had baklava a few times while there.  This recipe is the best I've ever had!  It's not so sweet that you can only stand a few bites, which probably makes this a bit more dangerous.  The sweetness is just right in my opinion.  I've made this twice now with rave reviews each time.  I followed the advice to make the sauce first so it has time to cool completely (I put it in the fridge) before pouring it over the hot baklava.  I will make this again and again.

I followed others suggestions to reduce water to 1/2 cup and increase honey to 1 cup, added 1/4 sugar to cinnamon/nuts, and poured cooled syrup over hot pastry.  Not only was this the best Baklava I have ever made, it was the best I have ever had.  I used 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 cup chopped almonds and toasted them first.

A local grocer had ground walnuts, which I bought for this recipe. I watched the video and found this Baklava was very easy to make.  I think I would have started with a stick of melted butter, after putting melted butter in the pan.  I had plenty of melted butter left, even after generously buttering the dough sheets.  I baked it for 35 minutes at 350 and it was the perfect crispness.  The syrup soaked right in.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I listened to the top reviews.  I made sure to lay the phyllo sheets out wrinkly for extra crunch.  I added the vanilla after I finished simmering the syrup, so the flavoring would not boil off.  I found that I needed to use about 4 Tablespoons (1/4 cup) of nut mixture per layer to use it up before I ran out of phyllo dough.  I also listened to the many reviews that said that you should chill the syrup and pour it over the hot baklava.  It sizzled when I poured it and turned out super crispy!

Fantastic recipe! I have been making it, as requested, for my son's and a friend's birthdays for 9 years now. Always receive great praise. I pulse my nuts in a mini-prep for a uniform size and to save time. Otherwise I make it exactly the same.

Great recipe. Tastes like authentic baklava that I get from Middle Eastern restaurants.

You have to use more honey, I made this and the whole thing wasn't very sweet so ruined the whole batch. And you don't want to bake it the whole 50 or youl burn the dish, so keep checking it I say about 35-40 and its perfect. Also add lemon zest to the syrup its traditional to add it to the syrup it adds flavor n taste so much better, also use a plastic wrap in between ur damp cloth for the doe if not itl make ur doe sticky n not workable.

This recipe was easy and came out great. We did find that the pastry is not sticking together though, it falls apart when I take it out the pan. And I added a bit more syrup to the recipe, i found that it was not sweet enough. I used walnuts and I will definately make again.

Great and simple recipe for baklava!  I followed all the preparation and cooking directions for this recipe, but added my own twist by making "baklava fingers" instead.  Everything worked out the same.  I followed others' advice and made the sauce ahead of time and let it cool before pouring.   Also, after being soaked in the sauce, I reccommend letting each piece of baklava sit to drain by placing them along the rim of a large plate.   These two ideas will keep them from getting too soggy.

Bak-lavaaaa youu~~~!!!
This recipe was amazing! 
I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice to the sauce along with the sugar and water which added a great tangy flavor that balances out the sweetness! I made it while the baklava was baking, so I placed the finished sauce in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to accelerate the cooling process, and then proceeded to pour. I didn't have any honey, so I used brown rice syrup which worked just fine! 
I used a 9x9 pan so I only used one roll of the filo pastry, and was leftover with about a cup extra of ground nuts! I did use them to make some gf chocolate chips right after... :)

Great recipe.!!Easy to make, I tweaked it a little bit because we have many intolerances to too much sugar However my child must eat local honey daily for allergies and dosent typically like honey.Mind you, he loves this and it gets rid of pollen allergy, win, win. I changed the sugar to a half a cup a Splenda. I also added one and a half teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. I alternated layers with Pam butter cooking spray every 3 or 4 times. I also used 1/2 margarine 1/2 butter to watch the calorie intake. Turned out great.

2015.12.30 - This was so easy!  Time consuming, but easy.  I cooked the syrup first, then started to assemble, per other reviewers.  From start of syrup to popping it in the oven was around 1.5 hours.

Notes:
I only needed 1.5 sticks (3/4 cup) butter.  I used 1 batch of syrup (but it could have used more or been cooked down less).  I used only walnuts. My 1# package of phyllo dough was 40 sheets (9x14), and I ended up using all of them, so I had approx. 14 layers of nuts (each layer closer to 3 Tbs than 2).

Turned out great!  Used 6 oz of walnuts and 6 oz of pecans and buzzed in the food processor with the cinnamon.  I made the syrup first and cooled it down in the freezer and it thickened up nicely, I also used 1/2 t orange extract and 1t vanilla.  Will definitely make again, but double the layers of phyllo (16 on top and bottom, and at least 4-6 between layers of nuts.  Fast, easy and tasty!  A good job to do with a friend to butter the layers as you need to assemble quickly lest phyllo sheets dry out.

Followed recipe exactly, except let the sauce pan sit in a sink of cold water for a minute to let it cool and thicken. It seemed a bit runny when hot, and didnt want the sauce to just run to the bottom. Top stayed nice and crispy, overall was delicious and the best baklava ive ever had. I used chopped pecans for the nuts, and didnt cut the dough, just layed flat and tucked the corners to fit the pan. I plan to make this several more times before I try anything else. Very tasty, thanks for posting.

Super delicious recipe! Use partly pistachio cause its the best nuts! I have some butter left towards the end and i just pour them on top so it created like la layer of goodness. Make sure to put them in freezer while waiting for the oven to heat up just so the butter get more solid and the dough will be more crustier. I also left the sauce to boil a bit longer until it is not liquid but more syrup-py and really thick. It helps in not making your baklava soggy and still crispy at the bottom, trust me. Made 3 times so far, getting better every time. Recommended!!

Excellent recipe.  This was the first time i'd ever made Baklava, my only modification was to the nuts and butter; I used 10oz pecans, 4oz pistachios, 4oz hazel nuts, plus I doubled the butter.  People I shared it with said it was the best they've ever had!

I am not a baker by any means. I asked my boyfriend what his favorite dessert was and he instantly said "baklava".. I thought I was doomed. But, alas this recipe turned out to be quite a hit. He LOVED it!  I had no trouble at all and found it to be easy.  Make the topping sauce first and store in fridge.
Definately use the towels to keep filo moist, dont stress about filo not being perfect. My layering went 1 sheet, butter, 2nd sheet, butter, till 4 deep. Then mixture, 1 sheet, butter, 2nd sheet, butter, mixture.. Untill i had 4 mixture layers and then I did 8 top layers buttering between each. Be sure to lightly butter every time, no need for drenching, just a light brush ( i used a new mini sponge paint roller).  Pre cut before baking and dont go all the way to the bottom. Bake time is spot on, and immediatly pour sauce right out of the oven, let cool, finish cut's to the bottom and remove from pan. I put mine in cupcake papers and kept them on the counter covered with a clean, dry dish towel. Boyfriend gobbled them up and was so touched that I aced the perfect baklava. Cheers!

This recipe turns out great! After reading other reviews I want to add....melt the butter first. Use butter not margarine. Make sure it is BROWN and crispy before removing from oven.  I also reduce the syrup to 3/4 cup to prevent it getting too soggy. My son in-law is Turkish and raves every time I make it for him. Experiment with different nuts or maybe lemon flavor instead of vanilla. Enjoy!

This is blow you away good.  I made it for my family and two of my friends (and their family) and they all said it was the best they ever had.  Recipe as it is - perfect.  As an alternative recipe, you can add Almond Extract instead of the vanilla.  Slight alteration but big difference in taste.  Cut the baklava before you bake.  Wonderful recipe.

This was an immediate hit at a recent retirement party.  First time I made it and it looked like a professional made it or that I inherited the recipe from some great grandma.  I almost had people believing that I was Greek (and I totally don't look it.  Lol).  
I took the time to read through the top reviews and tweeked the recipe accordingly.  Here are the tips that really helped (thanks guys!):
1. Make the sauce first, cool it down.  I was in a hurry so I stuck it in the fridge.  
2. Toast the nuts (I did it after I crushed it in the food processor)
3.  Add lemon zest to the sugar/water as it's boiling (1 lemon... smells so fragrant!)
4.  Don't soak the phyllo with butter, just lightly brush (using a rubber/silicone brush works great, plus no lost fibers from using a paint brush), let the phyllo get wrinkles
5.  Don't cut the phyllo in half, just keep folding it in half as you go.  And since it makes it go faster, no need to cover the rest with a damp cloth.
6. Before baking, don't cut all the way through the dough layers!  The sauce then collects between the bottom layers.  Cut all the way through after the sauce sets.
7.  Cook at 325 for first 40 minutes more or less, then at 350 to brown the top (last 10 minutes).  My oven seems to be on the hot side though.  But I'd definitely watch the browning since the phyllo cooks so easily.
8.  I tried pistachios, walnuts, and almonds.
9.  Increase the sauce by 1/2 more.  I noticed the baklava at one of my favorite restaurants was

I have made Baklava several times over the years, and each time I don't remember what I did right/wrong so this time I am sharing.  When you google recipes for Baklava you will be surprised how many have twice the amount of butter or half the amount of walnuts as this recipe.  But I made this one because of the number of good reviews and I realized that it will turn out good however you make it, because Baklava is just good.  Based on reviews I decreased the temp to 325, which was a mistake.  The correct temp is 350 and I had to turn it up to get a golden crust.  The walnuts should be chopped very fine, otherwise the larger pieces will cause the layers to separate.  Maybe pulse on a food processer next time. Using 2 - 3 tbls of walnuts in between the layers is right even though it may seem sparse, you will have enough walnuts for all the layers.  Only lightly butter between each layer, 40 sheets of filo is 20 layers, 1 lb of butter is 16 tblsp, so use a little less than 1 tblsp between sheets.  I kindof drizzled the butter with my pastry brush.  Cut all the way thru before baking because it is difficult to cut afterwards.  I'm not sure if you need to use 1.5 times the sauce, I did that but didn't use it all, and the results were awesome.  I think pressing the whole thing down before baking might be a good idea next time.  This is really a great dessert and everyone is amazed you made Baklava.

Good but needs more sauce. I'd double the amount next time. Also, I used grape nuts cereal as a nut free substitute and it worked pretty well.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I do make my own puff pastry instead of the store bought  phyllo leaves. It is less time consuming for me and turns out wonderful.  I also use all organic spices and nuts which are amazing and I use Irish butter. Can we say 'WOW!' I will take pics the next time I make them. They tend to go quick in this home.

This was so easy. I'd been longing to make Baklava and picked this recipe. I followed it exactly except I did put a cinnamon stick in the syrup. My husband took about 30 pieces (I put them in cupcake papers) to work and they were gone in a flash. When he told them I had made it they were suprised, they thought it had come from a bakery.

Hubby requested I make something "impressive" for his work potluck, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to try making baklava for the first time! This recipe made me look like a baklava making pro. Sure, the tops didn't turn out nicely pressed (more wispy and flakey than I wanted) but the flavor and texture was spot on. I used walnuts for the filling, added lemon zest to my syrup and topped with crushed pistachios. Beautiful!

This was my second attempt at making baklava. The first time was I used AltonBrown's recipe and it was an epic failure. so a lot of time went by before I was brave enough to give it another go. I have renewed confidence since making this version. It was very easy and simple. And I wouldn't call it time consuming either, I thought it came together pretty quickly. I generally like to make a recipe exactly as stated the first time I make it, and then go back and read the reviews to see what adaptations other people have made. Some people are absolutely brilliant in the kitchen (I'm not one of them). In this case

I had some amazing baklava in Olympia when I was in Greece just over a month ago and had a craving so had to try to make it.  This recipe was really quite easy and delicious.  I didn't need to cover the dough as that took up more time than just layering and buttering quickly.  I made 1 1/2 times the sauce with the extra of honey and less water, orange and lemon peel and the sugar with the toasted nuts as other reviewers suggested.  
I have a hint that might help everyone.  The baklava that I bought in Greece had cloves stuck into the top surface.  It made it very pretty, added great flavor and made cutting the baklava super easy as it held the top sheets in place.  Just stick the whole cloves in the pastry so one will be in the center of each piece when cut.  I did also freeze for 15 minutes before cutting half way through and baking.

I followed the recommendations made by others (made an extra 1/2 recipe of the syrup, lowered the temp) and it came out great! Everyone loved it! Some people said they didn't taste the honey as much as other ones that they have had, but I could taste it. Overall, it was great!

I made baklava for the first time with this recipe, and a came out so well! I used half measures of the ingredients, since I was making it for a smaller party. Some tips to emphasize:
1) Melt the butter beforehand, and use a pastry brush to spread it on the dough. I first used a teaspoon to target general areas of dough, and the used the brush to spread it around.
2) Before you put your layers in the oven, be sure to cut the dough. I made it into squares with solid success.
3) This makes a lot of baklava. I made 24 squares even with half the recommended measures.

Too sweet! cut the sugar, and up to 3/4 cup honey. or jet reduce sugar. Keep watch to make sure it doesn't burn. I didn't quite reach 50 minutes.

Negatives aside, tastes very good and traditional. Brought it in for a Greek history presentation in English class and everyone loved it! :)

This is a really good recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and it came out perfect the first time I made it. I used 3/4 cup water instead of 1 cup so the syrup would be thicker, and I also made the syrup before I even started the baklava so it would have time to cool to avoid sogginess. I also sprinkled finely ground nuts on top of it as a garnish (after baking) and used pecans which were tasty!

The kids and my sisters went crazy for this dessert..I couldn't even let it cool and the kids were begging me to give them a piece . I made with walnuts and pecans and made exactly as written .  I did  not know how many layers to do so I ended up with a few extra phyllo sheets so I made rolled ones and bake separate. I cut the rolls into angles before I baked and they turned out perfect and beautiful on my cookie tray.with the layered batch, I did find my top layer ripping when I cut my squares and was a bit frustrated so for next time , I will definitely roll them and than cut them into angles,Way easier and much nicer.

Just made this for Christmas and got rave reviews. Angela's tip about spraying the butter on was genius.  I was able to work so fast I didn't even have to cover the dough.  I made the syrup as indicated rather than making 1 1/2 times the recipe as some suggested and it was plenty.  Any more and it would have been so soggy it would have been difficult to eat.  I also followed Elena's suggestion to make the syrup first and let it cool then pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava.  The phyllo remained crisp and the syrup was evenly distributed.  All in all, an easy and tasty recipe.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count and every time I make it I get compliments!! It is easy and so so so good. Even if my phyllo dough dries or sticks together and I have to patch it together it turns out perfect. I live in an area where I can get fresh local honey and I do have to say that it has everything to do with the flavor. Thanks for this recipe! It is wonderful!!!!!!

YUMMMMM!  My husband is not a big fan of baklava because it's usually overly sweet for him, but he loves this baklava!  This has just the right amount of sweetness without being too sweet.

Have you tried using rose water in your recipe? It's just rose extract and water, but when I went to the Greek festival and got baklava, the rose water made a big difference.

This version is NOT Turkish and almost every country in Europe has their own version. Greeks make it with almonds or walnuts. I know the Lebanese use pistachios and don't pore syrup over it and its usually dry. Whatver the case THIS Greek style baklava is great. I love th suggestions too. I'm going to make his for my hubby's birthday since he loves eating and probably breathing Greek food.

I was looking for a great recipe and this is it! I made 1 1/2 times the syrup like others said and found it to be perfect. I added a cinnamon stick and zest from a limequat (I had one fresh off of the tree) to the water and sugar before boiling and it provided a very good flavor. I will make this recipe for years to come.

This tasted okay the first day, but not very sweet. It was great after about three days of soaking up the honey sauce. Very sweet. But it's too much work for a dessert that's only good. If I'm going to put this much time and effort into a dessert, I want something great.

A really easy recipe that turned out well - will definitely make again in the future! The only tweaks I'll make will be to use a smaller quantity of nuts (I had quite a lot left over) and reduce the oven temperature.

I have only tasted "package-baklava" and I am not a fan, however these were MUCH BETTER! Now I finally understand why some people love baklava, I do too now. :) Also, i am not good in the kitchen, but this was extremely easy to make, and people were very suprised by my sudden improvement in baking skills.

This was incredibly delicious.  It was a little hairy working with the phyllo dough. Wasted 4 or 5 sheets. I did bake it for the full 50 minutes and it was a beautiful golden brown.  It was a little confusing reading and understanding the instructions but I watched the video.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Neonwillie...you have a real winner.

I have made this recipe 3 different times, using sometimes a variation of different nuts, and I've added either lemon or orange juice/rind in the hot syrup...and I've never missed.  Everyone loves it, and honestly a lot easier to make than I had expected.

Just made this.  It is good but I didn't care for the vanilla in the syrup.  Have had baklava over the years in many Greek diners in NJ and none ever tasted like they had vanilla in it.  Was somewhat disappointed after all the work that went into this.  When I make this again, I will not use the vanilla nor will I use so many nuts.  It seemed as if I had too much...   Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe & tastes just like what we had in Greece & Turkey (moreso in Turkey, the shops are everywhere, with Turkish Delight!)...never mind the syrup is thin, it's better after it has cooled & soaked for a day (store at room temp) & there is no trace of syrup left because it has all soaked in!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

I hint of orange or lemon zest might add an interesting essence, I'll have to try it, but it's delicious without & I never noticed orange or lemon flavor in Turkey or Greece.

I don't have any tips to add, but for the baklava/phyllo rookies like me, don't worry if the phyllo breaks or tears doesn't fold right as you assemble.  It still turns out great and you can't tell after it's baked.

A really good recipe. I baked them for the first time and my family loved them very much. However, I did add a little rosewater into the nut mixture and syrup, because I love the combination of rosewater and nuts. One thing though, remember not to pour too much syrup. I drenched mine, it tasted good but not a good idea if you have leftovers!

It was my co-workers birthday and he requested I make these (I'm the office baker so everyone gets to pick what they want me to make the for their birthday). Baklava is his favourite dessert so no pressure right? Lol He ended up eating the whole tray to himself ..luckily I made two. Lol. Everyone commented that it was "the best baklava they had ever tasted". Needless to say I will ow be making these every year for his birthday.

This was time consuming, but didn't require too many ingredients, which is a plus. I personally thought it was too sweet, and I don't know why, but without being refrigerated, it was soggy, which made the phyllo lose its crisp. The family really liked it though, and I think it had a pretty good flavor, aside from being really sweet.
Thanks for the recipe. I think I'll try it again :)

Tips:
*Use melted butter for the layers
*Lemon zest would really help the syrup..It needs something fruity to take away from the sugary sweetness
*Serve it refrigerated. At room temp, before being refrigerated (several hours after being baked), the phyllo would fall apart from the nut mixture when I tried to pick it up, and the sauce made it soggy and sticky. The refrigerator firmed it up 
*Make sure to use a LIGHTLY damp cloth for covering the dough as you work. Originally,the cloth I used was too damp, and it made the sheets stick together.

Made baklava for the first time ever using this recipe and it turned out great.   Read the reviews first and used a little less sugar and a bit more honey and it was very successful.  Got rave reviews from family  members.   Will definitely make this one again.

I never made Baklava before or worked with phyllo dough for that matter so I was not sure what to expect. I have only eaten baklava once before and it was from the Biltmore Estates Bakery in Ashville, NC. This recipe was simple to follow and the end result was delicious. I used pecans even though the recipe did not specify the exact kind of nuts to use. This is a must try!

Super recipe, and great results my first time out. Like the other reviews suggested, I made an extra half syrup recipe, used a food processor for the nuts, added 1/8 tsp clove and some sugar to the nut mixture, and used a spray bottle for the melted butter. This last tip helped me cut the butter by half, and believe me, I covered each layer with butter. Cooling before slicing helped, as did chilling the syrup. Very tasty recipe, labor intensive, but worth it. Resist the temptation to use more than a few tablespoons of nut mixture per layer. I thought the first few nut layers looked to sparse, so I added another TB or two. This made the layer too nutty when baked. As I started to run short on the nuts and made the last 5 layers or so with the recommended 2-3 TB of nuts per layer, it produced a much lighter and enjoyable result. So in short, don't overload the nuts!

Very Tasty. I used extra instructions from both reviewers sandra lee and Elena. Everything seemed to work out very well, saving some time and work. It tastes even better with pure honey (raw and uncooked). A mixture of pecans and almonds is also fantastic! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Best Baklava ever!!! I got so many compliments, with many saying the best they ever had. I used the suggestions from other reviews by preparing the sauce first and putting it in the fridge and adding more sugar. I also layered every 2-3 sheets using about 2tb per layer. I added a half cup more nuts, and melted the butter. I actually had about a half cup left over because I didn't want soggy dough. I was worried when I had that much butter left over, and I'm glad I did. This was easier then what I thought. Just give yourself sometime, and don't rush. I will be making this for years to come.

I am new in the kitchen and made this for a company party.  Everyone thought I was a pro!  The dough was a little difficult to work with and it was more time consuming then I had thought but I throughly enjoyed making it.

Excellent recipe. Recommend adding sugar to the nuts. You can leave out the cinnamon for a different taste. Sauce should be cool (not cold) when poured on. Baclava has many different varieties. Its believed to have originated in mesopotamia before the ottoman empire. Today it is made in Egypt, Greece and turkey although each region has its own variations.

I always assumed Bakalava was to hard to make, with this recipe it was simple.  Phyllo dough does take time to get used to.  It was yummy!  I see this at many ladies nights!

Wonderful recipe - I have made this for Greek and Arab friends, and all of them loved it, one even asked for the recipe. If that's not a sign of a great Baklava recipe, I don't know. :)
I've followed the tips of previous reviewers - 1,5 times the amount of sauce, let it cool, and cut almost to the bottom before you bake the baklava. I also use organic vanilla powder instead of liquid vanilla extract.
Since this has annoyed me several times now, and I always forget about it: Be sure to have a big/high enough saucepan - the sauce gets VERY frothy (>2 times the initial volume!) when it's simmering, and will spill over onto the stove if the saucepan is too small!

This was pretty tasty. I wish it was more crispy but i guess it depends on how much sauce you use. Probably NOT very healthy.

Delicious!  I tend to make a mess out of the top layers when cutting, so I set aside the torn sheets of phyllo for the top layers.  They flake off easily or I pick them off for a nibble.  A serrated knife works well.

I have never made baklava before and was a little intimidated to work with the phyllo dough.  It wasn't as hard to work with as I thought.  The sheets of phyllo were the perfect size to lay in my 9 x 13 pan so I didn't need to cut them.  Also, I didn't need to keep them moist.  I found the dough was easier to work with not being moist.  (I did thaw my phyllo dough overnight in the refrigerator) and I did make the sauce ahead of time & let it cool in the refrigerator while I was preparing & baking the baklava.  Pouring the sauce directly over the hot baklava made it nice & crisp.  It was a little tricky getting it out of the pan, but it was absolutely delicious.  Even my husband who was turning his nose up at it while I was making it, tried it and liked it!  Now if I can just keep it until my son takes it in for his class project in 4 days.  I may need to make a 2nd batch!

I have never made baklava or used phyllo before so this was an experience. First 350 degrees was too high, my laers fell apart and I think because the phyllo was too dry and crisp so I think 325 would be better.  I felt there was not enough sauce and I did add a cinnamon stick and 3 whole cloves and a little orange peel to the sauce, but next time I would make 1 1/2 amount of sauce. Also a pound of nuts was too much, so I wouldonly use 3/4 lb crushed nuts, I used pecans, I also added some sugar...maybe 1/8 cup and a very little nutmeg and a little more orage peel.

I was asked to make baklava by my husband's cousin and I was a little hesitant to make it since I hadn't done it before. Let me tell you, I will be making this again and again. If you work quickly enough with the phyllo dough, you don't have to cover it with a towel. Just make an assembly line and go for it. It took me about ten minutes to make two pans of baklava and get them in the oven. Not bad at all. I did make the syrup ahead of time and had it cooling on the counter to pour over the fresh from the oven baklava. Good luck and hope you enjoy making this wonderful dessert.

Great recipe! I followed some other users' advice and melted the butter, brushing it on with a pastry brush. It turned out great and even my husband, who is not a fan of nuts, was disappointed when it was all eaten up (which didn't take long at all!)

I had trouble with my phyllo dough. As soon as I took it out of the package, it tore into a billion pieces. The 2nd package wasn't so bad. Finally after all of that trouble, everything went pretty smooth. I used 1 1/2 batches of the syrup, but in the end I wish I had used double. Its tasty and I'm happy with it. But it wasn't as awesome as I was expecting. Next time, I'll be careful when opening the phyllo and use twice the amount of syrup.

I made this 5 star, and easier! Here is how: 1st! Make the SAUCE: 1-1/2 c. water, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 cinnamon stick, 1/2 lemon; simmer for 20 min. Turn off heat, add 3/4 c. honey, 1 TBSP real vanilla, stir well, bottle and refrigerate. NUTS: 5 cups of toasted pecans and raw walnuts, chopped fine, add 1/4 tsp. ginger, nutmeg, clove and 1/8 tsp cardamom and 2 tsp. cinnamon. DOUGH: Athens 9x13 phyllo; thawed in frig. Bring to room temperature. Melt 1 stick butter in mug in microwave. Lay sheet of wax paper on counter, open 1st dough package, unroll dough, place 1 sheet on wax paper, blot with buttered silicone brush. Add sheet of dough, blot with butter brush, until you have a stack of 8 sheets. Remove to safe area, and continue to create stacks of 8 buttered dough sheets on wax paper, you will end up with 5 total stacks (will be a few sheets left over). Butter the 9X13 pan, lay a stack of sheets in bottom. Add 1/3 of nut mixture. Lay stack of 8 buttered sheets on top, add 1/3 nuts, another stack, last 1/3 of nuts, add last stack on top of pan. Butter leftover sheets of dough and add to top. Put in refrigerator for an hour. Preheat oven to 325. Remove pan from refrigerator, with sharp knife, cut into desired shapes, do NOT cut through to bottom of pan. Place on middle rack in oven, for 40 minutes, check often after 30 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from oven, immediately pour cold syrup over baklava, especially into cuts. Refrigerate before cutting through bottom. Enjoy!

Not really a big baklava fan but I was asked to make one. Followed the reviews and made 1.5 amount of the sauce before I started preparing the phylo parts. Used a bag of premixed nuts and it turned out great! Everyone loved it but one friend said it wasn't as sweet as traditional baklavas.

I just finished this, the recipe was a little vague about things (do I butter the top layer before putting it into oven?) but it allowed me to have a little more wiggle room.  I added 1/8 tsp of ground clove.  These turned out great!  It was also my first time with phyllo dough and it wasn't intimidating at all, thanks!!

Made this for the first time this past christmas and it turned out wonderfully! I will make it again. I may use more honey and chop the nuts more finely, and probably not use nearly as much butter as the recipe calls for, but other than that it was great.

I have put off trying to make baklava for years.  I wish I would  have found this recipe a long time ago.  It was really not bad at all.  I used someone elses idea and used a spray bottle for my butter.  The phylo dough was not as scary to work with as I thought.  I used a mixture of walnuts and almonds.   I toasted them for a bit in the oven prior to chopping them.  I thought this was delicious and easy!!  Thank you

this recipe was so good! i was rather time consuming with all the buttering but it was well worth the labor. its really important that you make sure the dough doesn't dry out or buttering will become even harder. other that the somewhat hard to manage phyllo dough, it was surprisingly easy to make, and tasted delicious

It has been a great seller for fund raising  and I have made this recipe dozens of times. Many of the Greeks my husband works with say it tastes like the "real thing".

I went to college with Greeks, live down the street from an amazing Greek pizza parlor and this is the good stuff. The only changes I've made are different nuts or some citrus zest r a hint of nutmeg. It could go for a lower temp or less time, just keep an eye on it. I normally make sure the nuts are nice and small, a spice grinder will help there.  I did make a different version for a wedding shower once. Added lime zest to the sauce and used crystallized ginger in the filling with almonds. Very different but good.

This was really tasty.  For some reason though, I had a TON of sauce left over, and I drenched the baklava.  Next time I think I'll cut the sauce in half.

This is a GREAT recipe! I don't think I'll ever go back to buying baklava again!    Like other reviewers, I lightly toasted the nuts.  I personally, really like the combination of pecans, walnuts and almonds. And, used only cinnamon to flavour the nuts.  Instead of making them in the 9 x 13 pan, I cut the dough into four even sections length wise.  Buttered one  strip.  Filled the corner of one strip with the nut mixture and folded the pieces into small triangles.  Then butter another strip, rewrapping the triangle. I cut three slits on the top and baked for about 30 minutes. This way makes a really crisp and flaky baklava. But, it is really time consuming. (to get a sense of how the triangles are made take a look at the cranberry phyllo triangle recipe on this site.)

Very easy to make and tasts SOOO good! Hard to not eat the whole tray at once lol  I think the next time I make it I might put a few extra layers of phyllo to make it thicker - but that's a personal preference.

I shared this with 4 people and I got 4 "OMG"s!!! My husband had baklava for the first time a month ago while away and has been searching for a restaurant locally that has it. I surprised him by making this recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly and it came out sooo good! I only had to bake it for 35 minutes though. I used half almonds and half pecans. YUM! He said it was better than the restaurant one!

I followed the recipe as is, making sure I didn't over spread butter on each layer. Big hit at work. I will make again it's easier than it appears when reading the recipe.

Great recipe.... easy to make... made some minor changes to it.. I added pumpkin pie seasoning and cinnamon to the nut mix, I think next time I would grind the nuts because I found that chopped nuts are too chunky, I doubled the sauce amount because the amount the recipe calls for seemed like not enough and I highly recommend the use of plastic wrap over the phyllo dough prior to placing the damp cloth over the dough to avoid from the dough tearing..   I think next time I will use some middle eastern spices for an authentic taste per the recommendation of my mother in law.

This is so good! It took an hour to make the first time. Definitely do let the sauce cool and don't cover the dish once it's done. This will be a new family recipe to make again and again.

Yummy! Way too sweet though. Next time I'll cute the sugar by at least half. The honey mixture definitely needs to be made ahead of time and cooled. Also, I made 1 and a 1/2 times the amount of honey mixture, which worked out perfect. Yummy recipe, and not very hard to make.

This is one of the best things i've ever made on allrecipes possibly. I already had my mom requesting to make it for her birthday. This is sure to be made many many times again.

Just made for the first time and its fantastic!  I've never worked w/phyllo dough before so, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into but, it wasn't so bad.  I took the advice of many people and glad I did.  The bottom turned out soggy but, from other reviewers its probably b/c I used to much butter so, I will watch that next time.  Thanks for the fantastice recipe!

Absolutely amazing!!!  Just made it for the first time, and everyone LOVED it.  Tastes just like the Baklava from our favorite Greek Restaurant.

This recipe turned out well and was easier to make than I expected. I followed the reviewers' recommendations to make 50% extra sauce. I found it almost too sweet and rich, but I guess that's what baklava is! I also cooled the sauce before pouring it over, and I found that I used 50% more nuts as well, but maybe I was just putting too much on. If you're intimidated about making this, it's really not too hard, just a little time consuming. Give it a try.   I made these for a Greek class and they were a hit!

Like other viewers I had made this recipe for ages and I never look into the ratings and suggestions I have to say that it really help, I didn't know why my was soggy sometimes and now I learned that I need to add the syrup cold, also I did change the syrup a little bit by adding lemmon juice and substracting the vanilla, since I like a more lemony taste I also added the lemon peel to the syrup wile cooking and then I removed it and ready, also for the nut mix I added just a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg. this has allways been a hit in my household and with friend I make it every cristmas for my co-workers and even for y dad's co-workers I made it this year since they love it last year. this recipe is a keeper!!

This stuff is AMAZING! And it is pretty simple to make, but assembly can be time-consuming. It was my boyfriend's and my first time using phyllo dough, and it is really tricky, being of thin paper consistency. What's great about this recipe is that it doesn't have to be pretty to taste awesome. The only think we changed was to add some brown sugar to the nut mixture. SO GOOD AND ADDICTIVE!

Great!  Just be sure to grind your walnuts as fine as possible, or the whole thing will fall apart when you cut it up.

I made two batches of this, and I was surprised at how easy it turned out to be.  I completely melted the butter and used a brush to smooth it on, this way the phyllo dough didn't tear.  The first batch seemed like it could have been just a little sweeter (it certainly wasn't bad, just could have been sweeter), so for the second batch I increased the cinnamon/sugar in each layer.  This caused it to be VERY sticky, and I wouldn't do this in the future.  Also, I noticed on my first batch that the pieces were very big.  I would make sure that when you cut this before you bake it, always cut the pieces just a little smaller than you think.  It is much harder to cut after it has been baked.  Both of these batches got great reviews, and I will definitely make it again!

These are a little time consuming, but delicious.  Beware that you may not have to use all of the sauce though...too much can make them soggy!

WOW! I never thought I could make baklava until now! This recipe was great and super easy.  The first time I made it I used one stick of extra butter like someone suggested and that batch turned out soooo gooey and sweet.  I made this another time but only used the recommended butter amount and it was not as gooey and was dry, even after letting it sit overnight.   You definitely don't want to skimp on the butter if you want that truly fantastic baklava look and taste!

I took the advise of some other readers and I did not cut the baklava all the way through so the honey glaze would soak in more.  This is the best!

I looked this recipe up after having authentic baklava in Greece this summer. I wasn't expecting it to be this easy or delicious.  One tip- to "butter thoroughly" I melted the butter in the microwave and brushed it over the phyllo layers with a basting brush- it worked well and spread evenly without tearing. Excellent! Everyone went back for seconds!

I found this needed a bit more liquid to it, it was a tad dry.    Funny story: When I made it I had also done up a huge dinner where the leftovers took over my fridge so I covered the Baklava in saran wrap and stuck it in the stove so that nobody got into it.  Next day I turned on the oven to preheat it for cookies and TOTALLY forgot about the saran covered Baklava resting inside.  Needless to say it got tossed and now I ALWAYS check my stove before I preheat.

This baklava recipe was so easy and delicious! I used walnuts and melted the butter so that I could easily brush it on. The only change I made was reduction of the butter to 1/2 cup, and it came out perfectly. Will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I was in a hurry and tried to cut corners and use more nuts between layers (4-6 Tbs) so I had less layers.  Not as good.  Need to use the 2-3 like the recipe requires.  I also only used about 1/2 the butter and still tasted like the bakalva I make.

I have been using this recipe for 3 or 4 years now and everytime I make it, it is a huge it.  It is simple and doesn't require many ingredients.  Today, I am making 4 batches - we have a bake auction at work tomorrow so I will put one pan up for auction, another pan will be split up for samples to get people to bid on the main pan.  Another pan for close friends and one whole pan just for me.  You can never have too much of this baklava!

I wanted to take a picture of my baklava, but it was eaten the same day I made it.  Needless to say, this is a great recipe.  Next time I'm going to add a splash of almond extract to my sauce.

This was a great recipe!  Although it takes a bit of time to do the layering, I finished it in less than 20 minutes....It was easy...and the baklava was delicious!  Everyone at the dinner club was impressed!

This was AMAZING!! I made this for a Greek theme dinner we had with our friends. I'm not going to lie I was a little scared about how it was going to turn out. My sheets of phylo were tearing and I was kind of just winging it. The only change I made was to add a little extra cinnamon. My one friend who's sent months in Europe said it was the best he's ever had - he had 6 pieces!! Brought the leftovers to work the next day and people were looking for more. Very easy and DELICIOUS!!

Divine! I used a combo of walnuts and pecans and accidentally layered 2x as much phylo between the layers of nuts and it still came out great! Not as tricky as I thought it would be either!

I made this recipe a few year back and it was a hit with my family. Around Thanksgiving and Christmas I don't go to the store to buy baklava and now its a family tradition.

I was terrified to work with filo dough, but this was easy.  Mine was a bit soggy at the bottom, so I will use less butter next time.

Based on this recipe I prepared two batches this evening. I modified it slightly:

Batch one - I added chopped dates to the nut mixture.

Batch two - I added figs to the mixture.

Results - I am not sure. Both batches were gone before I could get a bite. My kids and wife thought they were awesome. I am going to make more tomorrow while kids are in school and wife is working. :)

WOW.... 
This was great!  My daughter is having a Greek Day for her social studies class.  This was a great recipe...simple to follow and not as time comsuing as I orginally thought.  I used a mixture of walnuts and pecans, and I plan to sprinkle on some icing sugar as a garnish.
OPA!!!

I read all of the tips and did make the sauce ahead of time. I added 2 t. of rosewater to the nut mixture to give it more Mideastern flavor. Unfortunately the phyllo sheets were just a tad too large for my pans and trimming after the fact was not good. So I definitely recommend that you check the phyllo to your pan to make sure it lies in nicely and trim, if necessary, BEFORE you start assembly.  I've also recently seen some baklava being sold with chocolate. So I took half the pan and drizzled melted chocolate just on the top. I think too much chocolate is overpowering.

I was not a huge baklava fan until I made this recipe.  BEST RECIPE FOR BAKLAVA HANDS DOWN!!  I've made this 4 times over the holiday season and I am still getting requests!  This is great for holiday gift giving.  I used large holiday cupcake tins/wrappers and placed a piece in each one.  Then I packed them into a cookie tin.  Nothing but positive reviews about this!

I have always loved baklava but never thought that I could make it myself. When you order it in a restaurant, it looks so complicated and tastes so good you can't imagine that its actually so easy to make. Now I can have one of my favourite desserts whenever I want. I took a hint from another review and made the syrup first. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was a hit.

I cooked this with puff pastry instead (needing using up). It worked and tasted delicious. All the family couldn't get enough. Will definitely be doing this again and will try fillo pastry next time.

I love Baklava, but was apprehensive about taking on what seemed a daunting task.  This recipe was fantastic and even those in my family who claim not to like Baklava loved it!  I make the sauce and let it cool before pouring it over the hot Baklava.  Will definately make again!

Sooo good.  Followed recipe as is, and used walnuts and almonds.  I think it would be fine with all walnuts, though (and a little cheaper!).  It kind of mellows out over time, less of a strong honey taste.  So good, is going on my permanent Christmas goodie list!

I used a new 2" bristle paint brush to apply the butter to the phyllo, doing two half sheets at a time; the remainder was covered with saran and a damp kitchen towel.  I made the sauce first so it would be cool when poured over the baklava.  I also tweaked the sauce recipe by adding a fresh vanilla bean, instead of extract; fishing it out after the sauce had cooled. I also added two teaspoons of fresh lemon juice at this point.  I only made one recipe of the sauce, which was sufficient.  My baklava was picture perfect (no wrinkles) and delicious!  It became my 33-year-old son's birthday cake.  Thanks for great recipe and helpful reviews.

I originally made this baklava for a small banquet that I had volunteered to run. This was so easy that I was afraid it was too simple and would be missing a flavour or something and would disappoint those of us who've had baklava in the past. I was lucky that it was so easy (and that I followed the suggestion of others to add cool sauce to hot baklava) as I did not have a chance to test the recipe beforehand and I was cooking for nearly 40 guests. I heard nothing but the best compliments about this recipe from both guests who have never had baklava and those who specifically seek restaurants that serve "the best baklava you've ever tasted." I have since made several batches to give out in addition to cookies this holiday season. I feel will be hanging on to this recipe for a long, long time.

This recipe ROCKS!!  I tried it once as a test run before xmas and i didnt follow all of the advice and it turned out a little soggy, but 2nd time around I used the advice plus added layers and  made this for christmas with family and everyone LOVED it!  I didnt use a whole stick of butter to coat the dough and i used the lemon zest in the syrupy part.  I also followed the advice to pour cool syrup over hot baklava (i used extra syrup 1.5 times the recipe, but i also used more filling) i used ten layers of phyllo between the layers of filling and then fifteen or so on the top (I was shooting for 60 layers but at midnight after baking all day I just couldnt make it). Everyone thought I had slaved away to make gourmet baklava!!

My husband asked me if I think I could make Baklava homemade. I scoffed, then came to AllRecipes. It was time consuming, but very easy! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it came out wonderful. The only thing I had any problem with is cutting the Baklava before it went into the oven. I even used my super sharp Henkles, but some of the dough ripped. I'm sure cutting it is a skill I can master over time. I gave some to my neighbor, whose favorite dessert is Baklava. She said it was the best baklava she has ever had. Better than any restaurant - I am making more tomorrow, because it is already gone, and it is the talk of all my friends now! And my husband inhaled 4 piecesas soon as he saw them. I am so glad I gave this a try. Seriously perfect Baklava.

Oh My!  This is wonderful! Yes it is time consuming but it is well worth it!  The only problem I had was cutting it it into diagonals as the top layer kept trying to come off, but no biggie I just tried to smooth it back out as well as I could. Some people said they thought there was much to honey sauce, I thought so at first, but it was quicly absorbed. Be sure to put it on immediately after pulling your Baklava from the oven, it is fun to watch it sizzle and then dissappear into the layers.  I let it sit over night and dug into it this morning. I have to say, it is better than any thing I have had at restaurants!  I had to give myself a pat on the back for this one!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe :-)

My boyfriend pointed out a tray of baklava at the store the other day, and mentioned it would be a good Christmas present for him. However, the price and the amount of pieces in a single tray was crazy. So I went home and found this recipe and made it the next day (for much cheaper!). I doubled the sauce like the others suggested, but I didn't use all of it (but most of it). Being on a budget, I just grabbed a can of cheap mixed nuts.  It turned out a little more peanutity then most baklava I've had, but thats not a bad thing.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts now!

Terrific.  I used the butter spray and it made it really easy to make.

I make Baklava following this recipe every year with 10-12 other women. I am in charge of buying the butter, usually 20 lbs.  A great time with a great dessert.  Although it can be intimidating it is easy and a holiday favorite.

Turned out great, for time and use I used bags of chopped walnuts. Recipe is kind of confusing about the phylo (or its just me using it the first time) but i didn't cut it half as the recipe states, it was already divided into two sections when I removed it from the package. Hits the sweet spot.

Delicious recipe! The only thing we would do differently the next time around is add a couple more sheets of phyllo dough to each layer. Two sheets just didn't seem like enough.

I thought the sauce ratio did not need to be increased as suggested by other reviewers, I felt there was plenty of the honey/sugar sweetness and in fact felt I could have used even less.

I was a little hesitant to make this recipe...I guess I was afraid to mess it up!  Bt for a first attempt at making Baklava it turn out awesome!  Not hard to make at all.  I did increase the sauce to 1.5 times the amount based on other reviews and I made that first before I did anything else!  Great recipe.  Tastes wonderful!

This recipe is amazing!  I've never made baklava before and when I sent some to work with my husband his friends kept asking if I was Greek.  =]  I read some of the reviews and I did make the sauce before assembling the rest of the recipe so that when the baklava came out of the oven I could pour the cooled sauce over the hot baklava.  I also used 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce in the recipe.

amazing. i made this after a trip to turkey and it tasted just as good (if not better, in some cases) as the real deal. a turkish rug dealer who came to visit said it was the best baklava he had ever had in the states. then again he was trying to sell rugs, but still. it really is that good!

After making this, I realize that I'm not a baklava fan(I'd never had it before). However, I made it for a party and everyone RAVED over it, hence the five stars. If you love baklava, you'll love this recipe. If you don't like baklava, don't expect the recipe to change things...

This was soooooooo yummy!!! I followed a tip from a previous reviwer- I poured COOLED baklava filling over the HOT phylo/nuts as soon as it was out of the oven. SO before you start the dough, make the honey mix first so it has a chance to cool...and it will cause this dessert is a labor of love!I wish the phylo would come PRE buttered...well maybe not, then I would eat this ALL the time! AAH! 
~*~*~**~*~   ENJOY!  ~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~

I've never made Baklava before, so I wasn't expecting it to be so easy. Time consuming, like woah, but easy. Also, for those that would prefer a thinner, not as over the top with the sweet, just use half of the phyllo dough. It makes for a thinner Baklava. You may want to adjust the recipe by half if you do that though. I still have the rest of the honey-sugar sauce waiting on some chicken in the fridge. =D

This turned out waaaay better than any baklava I've had at a restaurant. I took all the tips into consideration and my dish was the prettiest (and tastiest) on the table at our church gathering. Scrumptious!

WoW what a great recipe! This is going to be a favorite to bring to family gatherings or to make at Christmas. I read the reviews and made half more extra sauce and there was plenty. Also added the lemon zest to the sauce. The only thing I have to say surprised me about this other than the amazing simplicity for the finished product, which looks and tastes like a top chef made it, was that it was time consuming. So I'm glad I had help. Well worth the effort though, I'm a beginner in the baking area and have never worked with phyllo before but this dessert turned out perfect.  However I can't stop eating this! Hubby is a chocoholic, so Chocolate Baklava is next!
This is an additional note a year after I did this review... I brought some to work and now have people begging and willing to pay anything I ask to make them pans of this stuff. They say they want an invite to my house for dinner because I must be a fabulous cook : )

I made this recipe for my Granddaugher's first birthday celebration.  It was a complete hit!  The guests thought it was fabulous!  I will definitely make these again!

This was my first attempt at Baklava, and I did not think it was so hard to make.

I forgot to make one and a half recipes of the syrup, as some of the other reviewers had suggested, and it was still great!  My daughter thought it was the perfect amount of nuts and syrup!  Great recipe!

Very good but also very rich. I would not use real butter in this dish again.  I think because of the large amount (it took more than a cup) it made it taste weird. I followed advice of others and made sauce first and let cool.  

I will be making again for the holidays.

Nice basic recipe. I omitted the vanilla and used rosewater and orange blossom water for a more middle eastern twist.  also added grated lemon zest to the syrup.  I like nuts toasted before I add them to anything for a better level of flavor and to avoid bitterness. Used a combo of cashews and almonds crushed finely and put them on a cookie sheet to toast in the oven while it was preheating.  I might want to make 1 and 1/2 times the syrup next time. One recipe didn't seem quite enough but doubling would be too much. thanks to the other reviewers for the invaluable tips.

This recipe is amazing, I've used it for years.

I know it's not traditional, but I prefer a combination of almonds, pecans and walnuts in equal proportions; all unsalted, and chopped by hand with a knife.  Chopping by machine creates a great deal of flour that gums up later when applying the syrup.  Larger chunks of nuts lift up the phyllo and let the sauce get in between the layers.

Also, more butter isn't better in this case.  Butter contains water, and the dish will spend the better part of the time in the oven poaching instead of getting nice and crispy if you use too much.  I've made this mistake.  Spread the butter sparingly and use only what's called for in the recipe.

This was fabulous -- thanks for the recipe. The only change I would make next time would be to butter every sheet, as mine had a tendency to slide where there wasn't the butter mixture.

mmm...this was DELICIOUS!!! I've never made Baklava before, and I've been craving it for some time. This recipe is amazing; the only thing is that I would reduce  the amount of honey-the flavor was a little too strong for me.

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it. Lots of "oooohs" and "ahhhhs". Making two pans today, 1 for Easter and 1 to give away as a gift to our friends who begged for more. Great recipe.

SUPERB recipe!  I followed the other reviewers *hints* because I had never worked with phyllo before this and it still turned out wonderful.  I used walnuts because I didn't want to use expensive nuts until I tried the recipe.  I'll go for it next time!  I also made some extra sauce as suggested, but I think it was a little too moist.......so next time I'll just use the amount stated - it's personal preference as far as that goes.  THANK YOU for a great recipe!

Good recipe! I've never worked with phyllo dough before so I had a hard time buttering it at first. After a little trial and error, I figured the best method for me was to melt the butter and brush it on with a basting brush. I also came up a little short on the nut mixture, so I guess I was a little too heavy on the nuts in my layers. But this tasted exactly like the baklava given to me by a Greek family friend many years ago. Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely make it again!

to quote one of the eaters of this baklava...it was divine!  i used a combination of pistachios and walnuts for the nuts, and followed the rest of the recipe directly.  I did notice that my baklava browned well before the hour was up (i took it out around 45 minutes), and i had an excess of phyllo when i was done.  definitely time consuming, but still fun to make and easy too.  i will definitely make this again.

Soo good!  We had to eat it immediately.  There was enough sauce; as recommended I did not boil it and made it before the pastry so it could cool.  I toasted the walnuts and melted the butter- there was excess butter.  Very easy to make, though a  bit time consuming.  I'll definitely make again!!  I love baklava and never thought I could make it myself!

This recipe is fantastic.  I found that I only used about half the butter and it still tasted perfect.  My husband is Egyptian and he says that this is the best Baklava he has ever had.

This is HEAVENLY!  Hubby couldn't eat much because he thought it was too rich 
(though VERY tastey).  I was really surprised how EASY it is!  And it didn't even matter if the phylo tore, because it was just fine in the layers.  I melted the butter and painted it on with a brush.  SO good!

I have used this recipe a few times now, and have tried different things with it.  The first time, I used nuts.  The next time, I used peanut butter in the sauce, and today I used home made strawberry jam between the layers instead of nuts.  Much better with the jam, than nuts.  Great recipe, easy to adjust to your own taste, and fairly easy to make.

I love baklava, but this recipe fell short. It was dry and nothing like the honey soaked type that I get at my favorite Greek restaurant. I think this recipe has good bones, but in the future, I will drizzle some sauce between the layers every so often and I won't bake it for so long.

I prepared this recipe for a church gathering.  The dish was empty within a few minutes.  Everyone loved it!  I ended up using about a half of cup more butter than called for to ensure the bread was buttered enough and I used chopped walnuts.  Defintely a keeper.

This was delicious and incredibly easy to make.  I was lucky enough to find phyllo dough already in 9x13 rectangles.  I used a mixture of pecans and almonds and wonder if any nuts would work nicely.  I did use the lemon zest and wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Thanks!

Very very good! Thick and very nutty. I used pecans chopped in the food processor. Make the syrup ahead so it cools down by the time you take the baklava out of the oven. Cold syrup over hot baklava or hot syrup over cold baklava for best results.

Excellent!!  Not as sweet as other baklava recipes I've tried.  It was perfect.  I got rave reviews and will definitely keep making this!!  I wanted to try using pistachios as others have suggested, but the store was out, so I used almonds and it was great!

SOOO GOOD!!! honey, cinnamon, walnuts..excellent together. This has now become my family's favorite dessert. I followed the recipe exactly except for I only used 1/2 cup melted butter and it worked out perfectly still! It's even way better than the baklava at our local greek restaurant

when i took the baklava out of the oven i thought it would be burned at first, cause the edges were pretty dark. And the syrup seemed so thin, really thought i messed it up. But... it ended up perfect. Best baklava i ever tasted. Not too overly sweet and nice and crunchy. It doesn't look awesome, but better than most (even storebought) baklava i've seen before.

This was amazing.  I added an extra cinnamon stick and the juice of 1/2 lemon and then put the lemon into the sauce while it cooked.  I got rave reviews from a friend that used to own a restaurant and sold baklava.

This is a great recipe.  I  cheated a little and used a butter-flavored cooking spray, as others suggested, and it worked very well (it fooled my husband, who commented that he enjoyed the buttery taste!).  The only problem I had was that I left my walnuts in the food processor too long, and they became moist (practically pureed!), which made them hard to sprinkle.  Still, it all turned out wonderfully.   Thanks for the recipe!!

This is way too easy to make!  I cut the recipe in half (don't need a full tray of this laying around) and it seemed a little dry, so next time I think I'll just make the full amount of syrup.  Even dry, this gets 5 stars.

Excellent! Maybe could have used a little extra honey syrup. My Greek mother in law was very impressed when I gave her some, she said it is perfect!

Oh Donna, what have you done?  I have just made your baklava this afternoon and it hasn't even cooled yet and I can't resist it!  I was extremely surprised how easy it was to make (just time consuming) and how well it has turned out.  Thanks very much for sharing your recipe.  Cheers, Lindy

DELICIOUS! It was a little time-consuming, but I guess good things come to those who are patient and REALLY wanting some great baklava. I got the urge to make some when I bought a couple of pieces from my favorite Greek restaurant. Mine was even better than theirs! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this for my daughters school project and of all the international food, this was the first to go!  My husband even said this is his new, all-time, favorite dessert!  My only alteration was I used a whole pound of butter.  I'll be making this again for Christmas!

Every year the Greek Orthodox Church in my city holds a huge festival and homemade baklava is always the highlight. I couldn't believe it when I tried this recipie and it was every bit as good as the baklava at Greek Fest! It was the first time I've tried anything like this and it was suprisingly easy. I highly recommend it. All my friends gave it rave reviews, so guess what everyone is getting for Christmas this week?

WOW, I'm in heaven!!!  I love baklava but didn't ever think of making it because I thought it would be too difficult, until I came across this recipe!  Used finely chopped pistachios with sugar and cinnamon in my nut mixture which I used about a 1/4 cup in each layer.  I also ran out of butter and prayed it would turn out using margerine...still turned out fantastic.  I did make sure to cool down the honey syrup before putting it on my hot bakalava, I can't say enough great things about this recipe..thank you Donna!!!!!

Fabulous!  Quick and easy, delicious.  A friend at a party said that this was the best baklava she has ever eaten.  I used pulverized nuts instead of chopped nuts for a more delicate dessert and it worked well.

Great recipe.  I was never a fan of Baklava, but now I am.  The only difficulty I had was handling the phyllo, but it still turned out great.  Thanks!

Excellent!  This was my first time making baklava, and I had NO trouble!!!  I'm vegan, so I substituted vegan margarine for butter, and agave nectar for honey, and it worked perfectly!!  So yummy--my only problem is that I'm afraid I'm going to eat all of it myself!!!

This is a very rich and buttery dessert.  It looks pretty too.  I made it for a Purim Party and everyone loved it.  I did use about 3/4 cup more butter then was called for, but it made it all the better.  A great recipe and oh so delish!

Great flavour. Just like the fancy restruants or in the bakeries. I loved it!! This is my 2nd time making it and i found the 1st time was a little dry so this time I added a little more honey. I like it moist.

I was shocked, but this was as good as the baklava I ate in Greece on my honeymoon.  Everyone I served it to agreed it was some of the best they've tasted.

I found the layers to nuts ratio worked perfectly with some extra phyllo dough left over.  I may try cutting back slightly on the nuts next time (just my own personal taste) but everyone else said it was perfect.

I felt like a master chef!  It was way easier to make this than I thought it would be, and everyone at work absolutely loved it.  I didn't use every last drop of the Honey Syrup...I don't like wet baklava, but outstanding.  Totally outstanding.

Superb!!!  Surprisingly easy to make.  The only differences were that I only used about 1/2 of the butter, and only used 1 - 8 oz. package of the phyllo dough.  I also used about 4 tablespoons of nuts on each layer, and ended up with about 5 or 6 layers.

This was the first time that I made baklava and it turned out great.  I gave it to my mother for Mother's Day since it is her favorite.  I did follow the advice of others and cooled the syrup before pouring over hot baklava.  It was not soggy at all.  Thanks!

Very good.  Tastes as good or better than store-bought.  Only problem - the 2 to 3 tablespoons of nuts per layer must be very large, at least for the package of dough I used; probably more like 4 tablespoons per layer if you want to use all the nuts before you run out of dough.  I sprinkled the rest of the nuts over top after baking.  If you boil the syrup the whole 20 minutes it shouldn't be soggy, at least mine wasn't.  Used 200 grams hazelnuts, 100 grams peanuts, 100 grams almonds and 50 grams cashews.  Definitely worth trying!

Amazing!  Kept the butter heated which helped keep the baklava moist - time consuming, but relatively easy - look for phyllo dough packaged w/ 2 rolls - keeps 1/2 moist while you work w/ the other!

Living on a military base in semi-isolated Southern Japan there are no Greek or Arabic restaurants or shops. I tried many baklava recipes and this one was by far the closest recipe to what I used to buy at the Hala in Jacksonville. I am actually teaching a baklava making class today for my friends so we can sit around and eat it. It's wonderful.

This came out great! I thought it was rather easy. I used a damp towel to put on dough and I also melted the butter like others suggested and put it on with a paint brush.

This tasted very good, though the texture wasn't as crisp as I would have liked. I ground the nuts (I used pecans) to a very fine powder. I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the nut mixture.

I brought this into work today for an international lunch and it was a big hit!  A bit tedious to make, but worth it.  I agree with others that cold syrup poured over hot baklava keeps it from getting soggy.  It was delicious two days after being made.

Donna, Thank you for submitting this recipe. It is absolutly unbelievable! I am an excellent baker but I have always been intimidated by phyllo. I have always ordered baklava from a bakery or even mail order. This was so easy and beautiful, not to mention Yummy! I omited the vanilla and grated 1/2 tsp orange rind and 1Tbsp orange juice. It is so good. Can't wait to make it for Christmas.

Awesome! My husband is Greek and he swears it tastes just like his grandmothers'. Really easy to make just takes a bit of time to maneuver the phillo dough.

I added 1/2 cup more honey to the sauce.

VERY good! We've had baklava at restaurants a couple of times, and I never thought I would be able to make it at home! I halved the baklava recipe but made the same amount of sauce. The sauce was very tasty, but I expected it to be thicker, more syrupy. Not sure how to remedy this... The 'damp-cloth-covering-the-phyllo' is an absolute must - even with it, three or four of the sheets tore just a little bit. Great recipe!

This was a great recipe.  However, I took the advice of several reviews to double the sauce and it turned out sooooo soggy!!  yuck!  I could only eat the top half.  Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly!

Yummy yummy. I had some Baklava at a Lebanese restaurant recently that was just sinful, so I thought I'd try my own. I only used half of the phyllo dough, half the nuts, and half the butter (margarine actually... and melted... spreads better), but I did 1.5 times the sauce. I substituted Splenda for sugar (which has worked for everything I've baked so far... including creme brulee). It was quite time consuming, especially because store-bought walnuts aren't very finely chopped. And it was my first time using Phyllo (I'm a big fan of puff pastry dough though), so that took some getting used to. All in all, it was very messy, but very yummy straight out of the oven. I hope that it will congeal a little more in the fridge overnight... we shall see!

It was difficult and fusterating because the phyllo was tearing but it was worth it. A HUGE hit at my parents anniversery party and will definately make again. Awsome awsome! Make sure you have lots of layers of butter and walnuts (or whatever nut you choose).

great recipe, though i didn't have a clue what kind of nuts to use.  ended up with almonds, pecans, and hazelnuts.  next time i'll chop them a little more finely.  i agree--it's a great sharing recipe; way too much for just 2 people.  :-)
