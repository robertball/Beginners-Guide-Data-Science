I tried this recipe today and my husband and I loved it. I did substitute one of the cans of condensed cream of potato soup with a can of cream of shrimp soup. This is one of the easiest and best recipes for this that I have ever tried. You don't have to use a recipe with an endless list of ingredients for it to be great. This recipe proves that. I will cook this again.

I made this last night and everyone really enjoyed it. It had great flavor and aroma and it was super easy to make. I thought it was more like a chowder than a bisque but we loved it! I have marked it as a favorite and we will definitely be making it again... Thanks for the great recipe!
