OMG, this is AMAZING!  We loved it!  After reading the reviews I added some things.  I added 1/4 cup of white wine (Chardonnay) when I added the lemon juice, I used 2 tbs of lemon juice instead of 1, a couple more cloves of fresh garlic, and I sauted red and yellow pepper, mushrooms, and red onions and added them in with the chicken.  I also added the pasta in with the chicken at the end so it could get all the great flavor!  My husband kept saying this tastes like restaurant quality and it really did!  It's really fresh tasting and you can taste every ingredient. It wasn't too greasy either.  It would be great to serve for company and it's super easy too!  Thanks for the great Italian recipe!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE. It is most definitely the base for creating an authentic Olive Garden-style Chicken Scampi. I used chicken tenderloins instead of sliced breasts and coated them in flour before cooking them. A also added extra garlic, since I'm a garlic lover. When the chicken was almost done cooking I added red onion and red, yellow, and green bell pepper cut into strips. Serve over angel hair pasta and and top with grated Parmesan cheese and I don't think anyone could tell the difference between this and the restaurant original! The only thing I recommend is keeping the heat down to medium - the chicken will cook slower but the garlic won't get burned - burned garlic will utterly ruin the whole meal with its bitter taste. Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you Cyndee for this wonderful recipe!!

What a great recipe!  I ended up serving it over angle hair pasta and it worked out perfectly for two... you may want to consider doubling the recipe if you're thinking about serving more people than I did.  Otherwise, I added about a half cup of white wine to the sauce while the chicken was cooking and cut up a tomato for some more color.  I cooked the chicken on low heat and would suggest doing so if any of you try this.  Too high and you'll sear it (trap the juices inside) and prevent it from flavoring the sauce... which it does beautifully!  Also, I parboiled some broccoli, sauteed it in garlic, and added it right before I served everything -- turned out so well!!!  Top it with parmasean cheese for the finishing touch :)

Very good! I carefully read through a great amount of reviews and followed some good suggestions - 1/2 the butter in the recipe, use only 2 Tlbs. of Olive oil, more garlic (I used 4 big cloves), added 1/2 cup of white wine, 1 diced tomato for color, added a small red chili pepper chopped fine and last but not least topped it with fresh grated parmasan cheese. It came out perfect!

Delicious!!  One of the cooks at my Dad's restaurant used to make this for me every day  when I was a kid.  Being very picky, it was one of the few things they could get me to eat.  I've ordered chicken scampi in rest. a number of times in hopes that it would be the dish I ate as a kid.  No luck....until now!! I will make this again and again.  Perhaps try adding a little white wine sometime, maybe a little more lemon and a little less salt.  But it's great as is. I actually like the large amount of butter and olive oil sauce it yeilds as it is great over pasta.  Be sure to have some fresh Parmesan to grate over the top when serving.  Goes great over angel hair and makes awesome leftovers.

This was delicious!  I did cut out a lot of fat and calories by browning the chicken and spices in only 1/4 cup butter, then added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and let the chicken simmer until done, then added some cornstarch to thicken it up just a little.  Served over angel hair pasta with salad and french bread.  It was a wonderful, fairly low fat meal.  I will be making this one again!

The chicken in this recipe was good, but the sauce just didn't really do it for me.  It needed something else.  If I make again I will try adding a little wine or chicken broth so I can reduce it and get better flavor.  Also, I though there was just too much butter and oil.  I will cut it in half next time.  I tried putting the left over oil/butter mix over pasta, but it really have no flavor.

I was surprised at how good this dish was. It was also a cinch to prepare. I didn't measure a thing, I just added as much as I like. I used fresh basil and fresh parsley from my herb garden, that made a huge difference. Also, I tossed the cooked pasta in the dish I made the sauce in to make sure it coated well. I don't recommend cooking the chicken for 10-15 minutes, check it after 5. This dish was good enough to make for company. Thanks for sharing. I've had this recipe for years now and am glad I finally tried it!

This is the first review I've written after using this site for about 5 years and making dozens of recipes - just to give an idea of how good this recipe is.  I read the reviews and used some of their suggestions: did not turn the heat up too high to avoid burning the garlic, dredged the chicken in flour, used half of the butter to start with and the remaining half throughout while cooking.  I also used about 1/4 cup of white wine when putting in the lemon juice and used about 4 cloves of garlic.  Once the chicken is cooked, I added chopped yellow and red bell peppers (1/2 of each), mushrooms and fresh broccoli.  After letting it cook for another minute or two, I added my cooked angel hair pasta and tossed it all together in the pan.  DELICIOUS!  My two sons and husband ate it all up and barely even talked.  VERY, VERY good recipe.

This has amazing flavor.  I love shrimp scampi and this is just as good.  Definately a keeper.  There was a bit of extra butter sauce left over...but the dinner roll idea was great to soak it up.

I could have died happy the night I made this dish. I made it Olive Garden style by pounding the chicken flat then dredging it in flour before cooking, then I added thinly sliced red and green bell pepers and red onion. Dredging the chicken is an absolute necessity!!!! But make sure and shake off as much excess flour as possible. You'll be glad you add this step, especially if you've ever had the chicken scampi at Olive Garden.

WHOA was this good!!!!  I threw in a bag of frozen pepper stir fry (red/yellow/green peppers) and upped the garlic for my garlic loving family.  Cook Linguine and threw that in the pot in the end to make a great sauce - and one dish meal. It was a huge hit!!! Thanks for this recipe CYNDEE - it is super easy and super tasting.  Quality too........

This is my new favorite dish to prepare! This recipe tastes better than ANY other scampi I've tried in restuarants. My variation on this was I put chicken tenderloins into a ziplock bag and marinaded it with the ingredients for 24hrs. Then cooked in a pan, pour the whole contents of ziplock marinade in the pan with the chicken and cook til wine cooks down and chicken gets slightly browned on each side, and served them with mashed potatoes and a vegetable! ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!

Yummy! I doubled the lemon juice which was terrific. I halved the butter and oil but I would have liked more sauce so next time maybe i'll add some chicken broth to the sauce.  I used 4 large garlic cloves and it was garlicy but good.  I also cut the chicken in chunks to get more surface area to soak up the sauce. I served it over whole wheat pasta with real parmesan cheese.  I will use this recipe again for chicken or for shrimp.  OKAY- I made this again adding 1/2 can of chicken broth after I sauteed the chicken.  Definitely gave it more sauce but not as good.  Maybe I'll try to use 1/4 can next time.  Also, use fresh garlic and not the stuff in the jar like I did the second time. OK 3rd time- awesome!  forgot the oil by mistake and used 3/4 stick of butter.  used 3 1/2 very large garlic cloves.  added about 1/4-1/2 cup cooking white wine, doubled lemon juice too.  served over thin spaghetti.  it was great.

I admit, I was surprised at how good this dish was. I'm a believer now! I used only about three TBSP butter and mayybe two tablespoons of olive oil. I also added white wine (maybe about a quarter cup) at the same time I added the lemon juice. I was very pleased with the results. A little parmesan cheese doesnt hurt either.

This was good - however, I like the chicken to have some color and browned it in the butter.  Much more appetizing that way.

Wonderful, easy, quick!  I did use 2 T lemon juice and 1/2 C white wine.  Added cooked linguine to the pan before serving. Could add peas, onion, artichoke hearts.

Yummy! My husband and I loved this. SO easy to make and delicious. I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3...which was perfect! I also added a little more lemon juice than the recipe calls for. It turned out great especially with the mushrooms we sauteed with the chicken too! I served this with bow-tie noodles and garlic bread......so yummy!

This was delicious and super quick to make! I dipped the pieces of chicken into flour and lightly sauteed them in about 2 tbsp. of olive oil. I added in only freshly minced seasoning and 3 tbsp. of lime juice (I just ran out of lemon juice) and about 1 cup of chicken soup broth. When it was almost done cooking, I added some thinly sliced red yellow and orange peppers and some scallions. It looked so nice and bright and the lime gave it a nice kick!

We thought this was just terrific!  And, I gave it 5 stars due to how easy it was.  If it was harder, I may have given it a four, but taking everything into consideration (time, taste, presentation, etc.), it's a 5 for a weeknight meal.  I did cut the butter to 1/4 cup (and then needed a tad more b/c I had so much chicken).  I also added a couple splashes of extra lemon juice, which definitely helped. I could have probably added more garlic, but I really love garlic, soooo that may just be an issue of personal taste.  I served it over spaghetti noodles -- don't forget to leave your noodles unrinsed so the sauce sticks!  My husband loved this!

This is an unbelievably easy and delicious meal!!!!  I applied some of the suggestions I read - I doubled the lemon juice, added an extra clove of garlic (and I used fresh garlic - not jarred garlic).  I added about a half cup of white wine.  When it was almost ready to serve, I added the angel hair pasta to the skillet so that it could absorb the flavors.  Next time, I am going to add some fresh mushrooms. I served this with steamed brocolli.  We LOVED this!!!

10 STARS! My youngest daughter convinced me to try this since its her favorite Olive Garden dish. Lets just say that, thanks to this amazing recipe,  she'll be dining here at my house for all her further Scampi needs ;) I breaded my chicken breast strips by sifting together flour, seasoned bread crumbs, and a half package of poultry seasoning I had sitting in my cabinet. Wow. I made more than enough for 5 teenagers, and my wife and I and still more left over. Sincere thanks for this meal; everyone loved it (over angelhair) and I end up looking like a master chef.

I had pretty high hopes for this but sadly, we didn't like it too much. I wanted to follow the recipe the first time I made it so I did it all pretty much as is (except I used brown rice pasta) and it was really, really greasy. I have a very sensitive tummy and oily, greasy, or fried things usually make me pretty sick, sadly this has been no exception.
Also, as a side note I am from an italian-american family and I grew up eating this kind of food and this dish was pretty nontraditional. The flavor was fine, but it's not really scampi without white wine, it really needs that bite.

I liked this recipe a lot. The only change I made was to use boneless thighs in place of breasts (they're much cheaper, and my family prefers the flavor). As suggested, I served this over pasta and thought the oil base made a nice sauce for the noodles!

I have made this several times and am just getting around to reviewing it.  Delicious!  I diced up two small tomatoes and an onion and added them into the mix. Also used italian spice, red pepper flakes, and more garlic, salt and lemon.   Don't forget the parmesan-romano at the end!

Good basic scampi recipe. Add a little white wine and use fresh herbs to make this even better! Also, adding a little flour to the "sauce" will help it to coat the chicken nicely for extra flavor (we had to keep dipping our chicken in the butter sauce). Overall, this is a very good, quick and tasty chicken dish to please the whole family!

Super easy & fast, everyone loved it!  I cut the oil a little as suggested, added some white wine, more garlic and some chicken broth.  Going to try some steamed-crisp vegies in it next time.  This is a keeper!  Thank you!!

This is the best Chicken Scampi Recipe I have ever had!!  It was a hit with my whole family! even my 13 month old!  I used 4 cloves of garlic, (we are garlic lovers) and used chicken tenders (strips).  I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms in some butter and put it on top of the chicken.  I put it on a bed of angel hair, layed the chicken and the mushrooms on top, poured the extra "juices" on the pasta.  Marvelous!

Great recipe, soooooo easy. I did change it quite a bit though (it was waaaaay too fatty).  I cut teh butter down to 1/4 c margarine instead and elminated all but a sprinkling of olive oil. I used 1 c garlic chicken stock - 1/2 cup in the pan with the chicken and 1/2 after I used it to steam some broccolli.   I didnt' have any basil so I used 1/2 tbsp italian seasoning and eliminated the 1/4 tsp oregano.  I also used 2 chicken breasts instead and added 1/2 bag frozen broccoli that had been steamed in garlic chicken stock.  I served over fetuccini noodles.  THis was really super and would taste great with shrimp or whiting fillets!

Very good recipe.  Just the right amount of spices.  My mom get a sour stomach from garlic, so I made some of the sauce without, and she liked it very much that way as well.  Definately making this again!

Very tasty.  next time, I'll add more lemon juice.  My only complaint is that it is very buttery and made me a little sick afterwards.  Next time, I'll substitute some butter for chiken broth.  Served it over brown rice - the heartiness helped to cut the rich sauce.

This recipe was absolutely FABULOUS! Even my VERY picky husband LOVED it! I only changed a couple of minor things, I added extra garlic and more lemon juice. (We LOVE garlic and the lemon juice gave it that awesome "kick") I also cut the chicken up into smaller chunks so that you got more garlic and other seasonings with every bite. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

Thanks SO MUCH!!!

Absolutely awesome. I used chicken tenders and dredged in  flour before sauteing as others suggested. I also added a red, orange and yellow pepper and a red onion as well as a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper. Ended up using an extra half a stick of butter. Served it over linguine. Simply delicious. Entire family loved this.

Definitely a new keeper recipe. However, like the other reviewers I modified the ingredients: 1/4 cup butter, 2 tbsp. olive oil, used 1/2 cup fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup white wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth and pepper flakes to taste. I served over with pasta and with French bread. Definitely two thumbs up! Thank you very much Cyndee for sharing this recipe! =)

simple, good recipe.  but for me, too boring.  and none of my kids would eat it so that's kind of the clincher.  i think we need more of a sauce on the noodles.

Made this as written plus an extra squirt of lemon juice, served over linguine noodles. Delicious! Also had steamed broccoli and ended up mixing the two together on my plate. An easy and fast weeknight recipe-a definite recipe box keeper!

This recipe is fantastic! I read through all the reviews and like many others added some things...extra garlic, white wine, extra lemon, and I used less butter as suggested as well.  I served it with bow tie pasta instead of rice or linguine. I let the pasta simmer with the sauce and chicken for a few minutes before serving. It was a huge hit with my entire family including my 8 year old. Thank you Cyndee for posting this, and everyone else who made suggestions.

this was just okay for me. my boyfriend said that he wouldnt mind this again but i could tell it wasnt his favorite. i read a lot of reviews and decided to only add 1/4 cup butter. i also added more lemon and i still thought it could use more. i did like the garlic and i added more like a lot of reviewers said. when i put the chicken in, i added about 1/2 cup of white wine (without that it would have been WAY too greasy!). i also cooked some pasta because i thought rice wouldnt fit with the taste. after it was cooked, i still thought it was too greasy and there seemed to be something missing. the taste was very mild and nothing really poped! i dont think i will make this agian

I thought this was excellent. I only used 1/4 cup of butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil making up of the loss of liquid by adding 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I served over pasta and it was superb.

Chicken was a little dry, but this was excellent otherwise. Would make again, but probably wouldn't saute the chicken for as long as 15 mins extra... just until cooked through.

Great recipe! Little too much butter for us but will be cut down next time. I added some veggies with the chicken (onions, mushrooms, red & yellow bell peppers)! Added pepper and a bit more lemon juice and less salt. Thank you sooooo much!!!! LOVE IT!!!

Delicious! I used a package of chicken tenders, which I cut into four pieces, I doubled the lemon juice to 2 Tbs. (as others suggested) and made some egg noodles to pour the excess butter/oil over.

This dish is awesome!  Used 1/4 cup butter (not margarine) and added 1/2 cup white wine.  Also doubled the lemon juice and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and fresh ground black pepper. Delish!

Excellent dish and very easy.  I added about a teaspoon of parmesan cheese towards the end of sauteeing.  I really enjoyed this dish. I put it over some left over, plain spaghetti and it was a great dinner.

If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would.  We added a half cup of chardonnay and red, yellow, green, and orange bell peppers.  The chicken turned out very tender and flavorful.  We accompanied it with the garlic angel hair pasta, which went very well.  I can't wait to make it again.

My husband & I were completely split on this recipe.  I really liked it and thought it taseted quite authenticlly Italian and had a lovely garlic and herb subtle flavor but my husband just thought it was bland.

4.5 stars!  This was really good, really fast and really easy!  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, which is always nice.  I used extra virgin olive oil, which gave it a really nice flavor.  I also added the lemon juice to the pan before the butter and oil became hot, as I was leary of adding liquid to a pan of hot oil.  I sauted the chicken for 5 minutes per side and did not touch them other than to flip them.  They get a nice golden brown this way.  I served it over whole wheat spaghetti.  I think this would be even better if it were marinated in the lemon juice and herbs overnight with a touch of white wine and red pepper flakes added.  Next time I plan to tweak it to be more like the dish at Olive Garden.

This is a super recipe.  I did not decrease the olive oil or butter as some advised.  This added fat is teriffic on angle hair pasta.  Added vermouth, but the flavor still needs a little tweeking, perhaps green peppers or tomatos as suggested.  Great recipe to play with!

This was nice. I cut the butter and olive oil in half and added chicken broth and a dash of white wine as a substitute. Though the sauce was great the chicken itself was a bit bland. I thought it was missing a little something. Next time I will add mushroom and zucchini. I will also cut the salt because that was a little too much for my family's taste.

this wasn't that good at all... too oily and greasy. the flavors of all the spices together were good, however, didn't seem to give the chicken or pasta enough flavor.

My husband really liked this, and usually he doesn't make much comment on meals.  I did many things suggested by other reviewers: added more lemon juice, put garlic in a little later, added broccoli.  I didn't have much sauce at the end for pouring over pasta, but that could be because I cooked it longer to ensure chicken was done. (I used chicken tenders.)

AWESOME!!!!!!  I'm a garlic lover and I added more garlic than the recipe called for.  My mistake.  I smelled like garlic for 2 days.  Next time I will put only the amount of garlic the recipe called for.  Was delicious, even with the extra garlic!

This recipe was ok.  I'm new to cooking and still trying new things.  I thought the flavor was bland and I wasn't sure if I should have poured the sauce over the pasta since I cooked the chicken in it.  Can someone help me and tell me what I did wrong?  I really love scampi and would like to try this recipe again.

Pretty good and easy meal. I served over angel hair pasta. I may make again but just cut back with the butter...it slightly overwhelmed the meal.

I really don't see how this got five stars.  It was OK, but nothing special.  It had way too much butter and oil, and made me feel slightly sick after eating it.  I like the fact that you don't need to run to the store to make this, but it does need something to cut the oilyness of it.  Perhaps less butter/oil, maybe add some green onions and a bit of white wine or chicken broth.

Absolutely delicious! My husband said it was like eating at Bravo's or Olive Garden. I did end up using all the butter & olive oil because I tossed it with angel hair pasta. Also added 2x the amount of garlic & lemon and even added more lemon juice and some garlic powder after I tossed with pasta - it lost some of the flavor. Cut up a red bell pepper & a head of fresh broccoli & added right before I let it simmer for 15 min. Served with flaky croissants.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I doubled everything except for the chicken; added red bell peppers and mushrooms during simmering, and served over linguine.  Add a tossed salad and breadsticks or garlic bread and even your biggest eater will be satisfied.  We will definately make this again!

I've made this recipe a couple of times and my family really enjoyed it. I discovered the first time that when I added the garlic early as directed, it burned by the time I added the chicken. The second time I added the garlic right as I added the chicken and the taste was much better. It tastes great with lemon parsley rice.

LOVED this. I read about 20 of the most current reviews, and then made the suggested changes by adding the white cooking wine and dredging the chicken first. It was SO good. I mean, ya, that good. My very picky daughter who only eats rotisserie chicken from the market, (and bacon) ate this up and my husband had 2 huge helpings.  This is NOT a healthy dinner alternative, so if you want healthy, are on a diet, or are going to change the entire recipe to fit your lifestyle, find something else. This is Naughty good the way it is. Embrace the naughty and enjoy this meal!!!

This was AMAZING....and really easy!!! I have 3 year old twins and a busy schedule so I'm all about easy!! I did use the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce and added white wine. I also added the garlic the same time I added the chicken for fear of burning it. I used chicken breast tenderloins and dredged them in flour before adding them to skillet. I served it over whole grain spaghetti that I also added to the skillet after draining to soak up some of the sauce and it was delicious!! My picky husband and kids raved over it!! They even told me I was the best mommy in the whole world lol!!

I absolutely loved this recipe.. I always pick recipes on ratings then I also read all the comments. I do try to utilize the recipe as stated but when I see some consistant alterations I take them into account. That being said I did reduce the butter and did add some pinot g. I also had on hand fresh parsley and upped the garlic. It was awesome and I enjoyed the left overs just a bit ago. Highly recommend recipe.. Thanks!

We loved this I made a few minor changes that really didn't change the original recipe to far, so I can still rate it. I cut down butter to about 2 tblsp, dredged chicken in a bit of flour and was out of lemon. I will for sure add lemon next time to determine if needed or not.  I added thinly sliced red pepper and onion.  This is definitely a keeper and something I would make for company.  I served over angel hair pasta that was tossed in olive oil, basil and fresh cut up tomato. Thank you.

I made this last night and my husband and I said it was one of the best meals I have ever made.  I did change up the recipe slightly based on other reviews. Floured the chicken, added a little wine, bell pepper, onion & used fresh chopped parsley.  I also used chicken tenderloins instead of just chicken breasts.  The chicken was ultra tender.  Don't skimp on the herbs.  They do make a big difference.  This tasted just like Olive Garden's recipe or better.  Try it- you will positively love it.

I thought this was a good start, but here are my alterations:  Per recommendations, I lightly coated the chicken in flower.  I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3, per others suggestions, and thought that was good.  I used the juice from one lemon - I would actually use 2 next time.  Also next time I will add more basil and oregano than recommended - The flavor was good, but I thought it needed just a little more seasoning.  With these changes, I think it'll be a 5.

Amazing dish!! After reading reviews I added just a few things. I lightly coated my chicken with flour, I added some more garlic (love love love garlic), and added chicken broth (1/2 cup) because at the end I wanted additional sauce for my pasta.  I didnt have any lemon juice available, so I had to use lime instead. Lastly I omitted the salt, as there is salt in both the butter and broth. Thanks Cyndee for a great post! This will be a staple in my household!

Delicious, after reading some reviews I added one quarter cup white wine which made for more sauce which I mixed with the linguine, good but if you add wine add more garlic too. I did add some roughly chopped spinach and sliced cherry tomatoes.

YUM!!! Wow, so easy and tasty! I served it with wild rice and peas. It would have been delicious over pasta too though! Usually my family has leftovers of just about everything, but this was completely gone! **(The second time I made this, I added about a tablespoon of Philadelphia Italian Herb Cooking Cream and it added a perfect hint of creamy/cheesy goodness that everyone enjoyed!)**

Very delicious. The chicken was nice and tender. I did add a little bit of chicken stock (maybe like 1/4 cup?) to it, and that helped! Will do again, but next time I will throw in some veggies (red peppers or green onion). :)

A quick and easy scampi that was quite delicious. I took the advice of others and cut the oil and butter in half as well as adding some wine with the lemon juice. (Only had fortified wines handy, so I used Marsala...just a few tablespoons.) I did do one thing entirely different, though, with great results. Recalling the French technique of monter au buerre, I began the dish with 2 tablespoons of butter, then, after the chicken was cooked through (which i found easier if the pan was lidded) I removed it from the pan, put a splash of my pasta cooking water in the pan to increase the volume of liquid, and whisked in the other two tablespoons of cold butter, about a teaspoon at a time. This results in a creamy, silky finish to the sauce.

My hubby and I thought this was good but liked the scampi more with shrimp. I was hoping for something a little more like Olive Garden's since I can't eat there being gluten free; but it didn't seem to be quite what I was looking for. Other than the addition of white wine, peppers and onions I followed the recipe.

This recipe was amazingly simple and delicious. I am not an experienced cook and it came out perfect the very first time, which is rare for me. My hubby gave it 5 stars, as did my dinner guests. Plates were licked clean! This works nicely with shrimp as well. I did add 1/2 cup white wine with the lemon juice. Served with brown rice which does a great job soaking up flavors.

We added some extra garlic and an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, and the flavor was great.  Just a tad on the greasy side from the stick of butter.  Next time, I may up the olive oil in the ratio.

What an amazing and easy meal!  The flavor of the chicken was out of this world!  It was an instant hit and this is coming from someone who can barely cook!  You absolutely cannot mess this meal up if you follow the recipe.  My Suggestions: Use less butter and less salt.

This was very good. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added some chicken broth for more flavor and then used some cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce a little bit. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.....

3 1/2 stars is more appropriate. It was good, but there was not as much sauce as I would have liked, and the sauce had good flavor. I admit that I dredged the chicken in a egg wash and italian bread crumbs and fried them in olive oil, instead of just letting them go naked in the sauce. The chicken was the best part. I seved it over whole wheat angel hair pasta...pretty good. It just didn't "wow" me.

Oh YUMM!! What a delicious and simple dish! I especially enjoyed this recipe as i keep a kosher home and it's often times hard to find such a yummy recipe without having to make too many changes and keep it kosher. Like many others, i took the time a read through all the comments, and tweaked the recipe slightly.  Used 5-6 large garlic cloves, I halved the margarine(but then added addtl. 1 Tbs) & 1tsp of Wondra(to thicken a bit) during the last couple minutes of simmering.  In addition, i added 1/4cup of chardonnay at the same time i added the lemon juice, which i also doubled to 2 Tbs.  Also, after the initial sauteing of the chicken was done, i added 1 plum tomato(halved, seeded, sliced length wise), 1/2 of one red onion, sliced thinly, length wise) and 1/2 bag of fresh spinach during the last five mins. of cooking.  The only other change i made was the chicken itself, i cut each breast into smaller strips instead of just thirding them.  It was a wonderful dish, and my fiance gave it 2 thumbs up and said he'd be happy to eat it again anytime!!

This was really tasty but way too greasy so I gave it 4 stars. I added some white wine and extra garlic, in one big pan and then tossed it all with cooked penne. It was still oily even with the pasta. Next time I would cut the butter in half, and add some heavy cream to give a creamier sauce like OG. The leftovers looked a little gross with the congealed butter but still tasted great.

Before I made this, I saw a few comments that stated this is restaurant quality. Well, I just made it and I absolutely agree!!  It was amazing! I cut the butter in almost half and subbed water (about 1/2 cup) and it was still rich and incredibly flavorful. I also added the spaghetti to the sauce to soak it all up!  Next time I will add more garlic, no other changes needed!

This is a great recipe, and very simple to make. In my opinion it is better than the stuff in the resturaunts. Less salt. Even my fiancé loved it, who claimed he didn't like scampi. I did add a splash of white wine and a little garlic powder and it turned out perfectly. Just make sure you add the lemon juice slowly, or you'll risk scalding it, giving the sauce a very brown and almost burnt sour taste to it.

Awesome chicken. I'd like to try the white wine like other reviews suggested, but I didn't have any around. I used cilantro instead of parsley, adding a little extra lime juice, and guessed at the measurements for most of the other seasonings. So good!!!  The left over sauce was great on top of rice and steamed veggies. Can't wait to make again.

This was some pretty danged good chicken. Having not had the restaurant meal this is based on, I wasn't sure how it was supposed to turn out.  I halved the fat, and added chicken stock after the chicken had turned white. Still could have done with some more sauce, so next time I'll add more stock and a little more margarine.

Excellent!! So easy and delicious. I did cut down the butter by half and only 3 tbl olive oil. Also added a half cup of white wine and added a little extra garlic. YUM!! Served over white rice and topped with fresh diced tomatoes for garnish :-)

AWESOME!!!!  I just tried making this for my boyfriend and I, and it's easily our favorite meal that I've ever made.  I did add some peppers (red, green, and yellow) with the chicken and 1/2 cup of chardonnay with the lemon juice as another use recommended.  I'm not very good at cooking meat, so I was surprised at how well it came out... Next time i'm going to mix the butter, oil, spices, wine, and lemon juice the day before and let the chicken marinade in it overnight.

I made this last night and my husband loved it.  I cut the chiken breasts into strips and dredged in flour, then followed the rest of the recipe exact.  I added a little more lemon and garlic than called for and also poured in some white wine to make a little more saucy because I was serving over linguini.  Yum Yum!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  I did take the advice of others and added some red and yellow bell pepper, mushrooms and onion.  Mixed it all together with the pasta and served it with some warm french bread to make sure to get all the drippings.  Hubby did say that was a keeper!!!

Great foundation! We added peppers-green, red, yellow- and a red onion, next time we'll add more garlic, too.  We made extras b/c we had family coming in from out of town but not getting in until late.  They ate the leftovers and thought we'd gone out to dinner without them :)

This turned out really good.  I changed a few things based on other reviews - cute butter in half, coated chicken with flour and added 1/4 cup of wine and extra garlic.  I also cut the chicken in strips - it would be good with tenderloins or thin breasts.  I added red peppers, onions and the pasta to the sauce and it was really good - even my 2 year old ate it with the onions/peppers so I will be making this again!  Next tijme I will add mushrooms as well.

WOW! This was delicious.  Our entire family enjoyed it. It was very easy and quick to make. I threw it over thin spaghetti. It was perfect as it was. I will definitely try this one with scallops and veggies  for a meatless variety. Thanks for the recipe!

Can anyone tell me why my sauce turned BLACK? I followed the directions to a T and the sauce turned black and the garlic burned. It still tasted alright but I don't know what went wrong.

I did not realize how much butter and oil were in the recipe until I started melting it in the pan. The taste was good, but I could literally feel my arteries clogging up with each bite. Next time I'm thinking of keeping the butter essence, but using more chicken stock for the broth-sauce.

Wow this was so yummy. I added 1/4c white cooking wine, 8oz of mushrooms, 1 red pepper and 1/4-1/2 purple onion. Then I mixed angel haired noodles in, could have used a little more sauce. Next time will add chicken broth. Yummy though, my 3 kids under 5 and husband LOVED IT!!!!

I didn't change a single thing. This recipe is better than anything I've ever ordered in an Italian restaurant. The key to making this dish is using a high quality olive oil. I've slacked and used cheaper brands...and it shows itself in the taste. Absolutely delicious though.

I just finished cooking it and it's......TOOO OILY! U definitely need to add white cooking wine. U can use the recipe as starting point but u gotta add ur own twist to it. The Olive Garden chicken scampi recipe is on the money.

Oh my gosh, SO GOOD! I was practically slirping this in my mouth (served over spaghetti). My b/f said "it sounds good" lol. He hadn't fixed his plate yet. I doubled the spices, garlic, lemon juice, and added white wine(1/4c.) and mushrooms.Topped with diced tomatos and parm. cheese. Was full of flavor. Thanks for such a great, easy recipe!

We had a huge Christmas dinner tonight and this was actually used as a side without any pasta. We did a shrimp/lobster scampi and the only addition I made was much more garlic. So good, Cyndee, and thank you!

This is a great recipe!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, and it came out wonderful.  I served it over spaghetti, and added Italian Peas, from this site, as a side dish.  The only thing I did differently was to put some grated Parmesan cheese over the top.

I was quite dissapointed with this recipe. The flavor was Ok but it tasted alot like pan fried chicken. And as for the sauce, there wasn't any. Just a puddle of grease. Sorry to be so harsh but after being so excited to make this meal, it was a big let down.

A little too greasy for my taste.  Had a good flavor though.  I would maybe drain the "sauce" (really just oil and butter), and serve it with pasta Alfredo if I were to try it again.

Very very yummy!

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years and passed it on to many people.  Over time, I have revised it a bit.  Once cooked, I stir into a big pot of cooked angel hair pasta and add one can of Rotel tomotoes.  I serve with mozzarella or parmasan cheese on top.  It is delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I did modify it a bit by using the suggested 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup chicken broth and thickened it a bit with cornstarch.  Also added mushrooms and diced orange and red bell peppers and increased the garlic to 5 cloves.  My son spent one summer working in a restaurant in a high-end summer resort and he commented that this was a better scampi sauce than they served at the reort.  Thanks Cyndee, this one's a keeper!

This was awesome!! I did make some modifications, to make it healthier. I cut the olive oil down to 2 tbs., used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray in place of the real thing. I made up the difference in liquid with chicken broth. I am a garlic lover, so I used 5 cloves. I used 2 chicken breasts, and cut them into 'tender' size strips as others had suggested. After sauteing the chicken, I added chopped mushrooms, zucchini, and sun-dried tomatoes. About 5 minutes before serving, I tossed in Mueller's whole grain pasta and chopped artichoke hearts. This was a wonderful meal! I think I will try it using vegetables only and serve as a side dish-would be great with grilled fish. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks Cyndee!

This was sooooo delicous, I loved it. The chicken turns out so tender and juicy.  This is simple too and full of flavors.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer.  I added red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, onion, extra garlic, and chardonnay wine.  I sauted the veggies seperate and added the wine along with the lemon juice.  It was so great.  Had it for left overs today, and it was just as good.

This was really good.  I didn't have any lemon juice or parsley but was fine without it.  Added 1/4 cup white wine and used 4 cloves of garlic.  Served with garlic bread and noodles - fantastic.  Even my very picky 3 year old ate it (and loved dipping the bread in the sauce!)

Pretty good. Would have liked a little more sauce to put over the pasta.

This was great!  I just added shrimp, 2 tablespoons of white wine and took out the oregano.  Great recipe and would suggest it to anyone.

I halved the recipe, basically:  1/8c butter, 1T oil, 1/2t parsley, 1/2t basil, 1/8t oregano, 2 cloves garlic & 1/2t salt.  I added 1/4c white wine after the garlic was tender.  I had leftover chicken breast so sliced it & reheated it at the end.  'Served it over 4oz linguine & liked it .  :D

This was very nice. I only used a small amount of butter and oil and used chicken stock to make up the rest. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried. If you make this using stock instead of butter then I would suggest serving it with rice as the texture of the sauce isn't quite right for pasta (luckily I used rice!).

Using the butter as specified definitely makes this dish greasy.  The flavor and cooking method, however, were great and I will try this again modifying the amount/type of butter.

A very delicious recipe. Quick, easy and tasted great. The only change was to add the garlic during the simmer time as I didn't want it to burn during the saute time for the chicken.

We only made three changes on our first try:  4 cloves garlic, doubled the oregano and cut the chicken as for a stir-fry.  We served with rice and everyone in the family liked it.  Since we thought it was a little greasy, next time we will reduce the butter and oil by half, add white wine and chicken broth (as suggested) and double the lemon juice.  It will become a standard in our family.
I followed the changes stated -- and it was wonderful!  We used whole chicken tenders.  So easy!

I was really excited about this recipe, but it didn't turn out like I'd hoped. I thought it was really bland, even though I added extra garlic and some white wine. I followed the advice of past reviews and cut back on all the oil, and I'm glad I did, because it was greasy enough. This one just didn't do it for me.

I made this recipe for my husband, who is a very picky eater, and he loved it!  I followed the instructions exactly, poured the chicken and sauce over pasta and served with crescent rolls.  This recipe was very quick & easy to make and I plan to use it again.

We added a couple sprinkles of chili flakes and it was beautiful. Served it over Angel Hair pasta with mushrooms sauteed in the sauce right after we took the chicken out. Yum.

Tasty and quick!!  I diced up the chicken breasts and it was even faster to make.  I think next time I will add a bit of red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.  Definitely a staple!

This recipe is great.  I had my parents over for dinner and they bragged about it for days.  I used cappelini pasta with mine.  I also made it again with jumbo lump crabmeat instead of the chicken-my husband loved it.

I paired this dish with Uncle Bens Natural Select "Parmesan & Butter" rice. The flavors were great together. I also added some broccoli and a touch of white wine.

I have made this recipe many many times. I cut the chicken into bite size peices and serve with angel hair pasta or with rice pilaf. It's always a hit and there never seems to be enough! I don't use as much oil (2 T. only) but otherwise I make as is. Family loves it!

AWESOME, this was my first visit to all recipes and you did not disappoint!!  I doubled the recipe, cooking for 8 and even my teenage sons gave this recipe a thumbs up.  My choice was to serve this over rice.  I did add more lemon juice, as well as fresh steamed mushrooms and brocolli (which I prepared in a different skillet and added the last 2 minutes to the chicken).  This was excellent, I had all the ingredients on hand and I would definitely prepare this dish again.

This was the best recipe I've gotten off this site so far.  It was so easy and delicious - and made enough sauce to flavor the pasta I served with it. I've passed it on to a few friends who also loved it.

This recipe was wonderful.  My Family loved it. I tossed the chicken and sauce (omitting the lemon juice) with Pasta, topped with parmesan cheese and broiled in the oven about 5 minutes.  All I can say in Wonderful!!!

I will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was ok, but rather bland. I'd recommend doubling the spices, lemon juice, and garlic, and perhaps letting the garlic marinate in the oil a bit before beginning the sauce. Other suggestions such as adding white wine sound good as well.

This was fantastic.  I changed nothing.  I could have added a little more salt, but even my kids, who would rather just eat chicken nuggets, loved it.  Served it with buttered, toasted, Italian bread.  Thanks for the dish.

Simply awesome, it's a nice recipe that you can adapt to what you have on hand. Instead of the suggested herbs I used Italian Seasoning Blend and a handful of fresh chopped parsley. I split some rolls and lightly dipped their cut surface in the sauce before I added the chicken and put them to warm in the oven--made for yummy garlic bread to serve with the scampi. Also, I subbed in cubes breaded chicken cutlets I had made the previous night--I made the sauce and stirred in the cubes to warm rather than cooking the fresh chicken. This sauce is extraordinarily good for something so simple to make. Bravo, Hubs who can be picky, thought it was a great meal.

Thank you for the recipe! Since I had limitation on my ingredients I used mixed herbs, sherry wine and cherry tomatoes. With right seasoning it turns out great and looks healthy after trimming all visible fats on the chicken breast. It's a great recipe to use when you're in tight on time!

This recipe is great!  I would definitely say though to cut the amount of butter in half like many others have mentioned.  The flavor was great though...perfect combo of spices.  Also cooked in red, green, and yellow pepper, and onion along with the chicken.  Very yummy!

Reading a pile of reviews I followed several suggestions. Cooking for two, we have basil and oregano in our garden and chives and used out of the garden fresh, a little labor intense! My husband is not a fan of garlic so I didn’t add a pile of garlic (cooking for myself I’d added A LOT of garlic!) When chicken was cooking added onions and various peppers (what I had on hand) and a little white wine, cooked whole wheat angel hair boiled suggested 4 minutes (somehow my husband either didn’t notice whole wheat, or it tasted so good he didn’t complain!) Added angel hair to chicken etc. THEN tasting it (mild mild mild) I added a couple of tablespoons of the great garlic butter on this site allrecipes.com/recipe/garlic-butter/detail.aspx cooked another 2 minutes getting garlic butter melted through – with the added garlic butter, this turned out SO GOOD!

Yum. I made some changes so it's hard to do 5 stars. I added extra garlic maybe 3 cloves. I also added 1/4 cup white wine and maybe 1 1/2 tbs (I added to taste and didn't really measure anything) more lemon together. I also dredged the chicken in flour along with all seasonings then sautéed with sauce. I also added a little more butter as I cooked the chicken. Then added mushrooms toward the end. I served it over angle hair pasta, topped with Parmesan and it was delicious!

Very good. I also added a splash of white wine, extra garlic and some orange pepper cut into this strips which I cooked with the chicken. Like other reviewers, I combines the pasta in with the sauce for a bit as that's really the best way for the pasta to get very flavorful. Will make this again when I'm in the mood for a nice garlicky meal!

This recipe is so simple and very flavorful. I had a rotisserie chicken, so I cut up and put in along with a can green beans, peas and served over brown rice. Will make again and won't change a thing.

More like a four and a half. Really delicious sauce. I added chopped spinach and a fresh diced tomato at the end to up the nutritional value. I also cubed the chicken and served it all overt fine egg noodles. Yum!

Hands down one of the best chicken scampi dishes I ever had.  I added about 1 1/2 cup of white cooking wine and put it over angel hair pasta and cooked (or steamed) broccoli.

One trick for extremely moist chicken... after you saute the chicken, shut the flame off, cover, and let sit for an hour or two.  The chicken absorbs all the flavors as well.  Reheat it before serving.

This was seriously one of the best dishes I've made in a long time. Super simple, quick and extremely flavorful. I added onions, mushrooms and diced tomatoes and a little more lemon juice than the recipe called for (I'd say about 1/2 TBSP more, not too much). I also served it over white rice instead of noodles because I had lots of leftovers ans it was just perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This is fantastic! I edited it by using scallops instead of chicken. This is a great souce though I prefer it with a bit more lemon juice.

made it as written first. The sauce tasted great going into the pan. After cooking with the chicken it lost some of its flavor. Added 2 TB sherry and andother TB of lemon juice. Still not quite there though....served it with some fresh ground pepper and grated Parm cheese. Better. I will make it again but thinks it still needs one more clove of garlic.

Prepared this tonight for my parents and family.  Only change was adding 1/2 C chicken broth, and wish I'd added more because the 4 chicken breasts made plenty of left overs, but not much broth/gravy.  Served over rice and tasted wonderful.  Much better than the restaurant meal we had last night for our anniversary.  Will definitely be adding this to my main meal file.  Next time I'm going to try adding a finely minced hot pepper for a bit of spice.

i just made this, so i had to share how good it is. probably not the healthiest, but i did adjust per some reviews and did abt 3 or 4 tsp of (smart balance) butter, and maybe 2 tbsp of olive oil. i used abt 4 cloves of garlic, and around 2 tsps of italian seasoning. i also used chicken tenderloins coated in flour. i thought there wouldnt be enough sauce, but i added some bell peppers and red onions and that gave it some moisture. i cooked for abt 15-20 minutes, and theyw ere perfect. very easy, ill deff make this again. also to serve with this i made" pasta e olio" on this site

The recipe is good and easy. I halved the butter, doubled the lemon juice (could probably use even more in my opinion), used fresh parsley and added white wine, an onion and 1/2 green pepper.

This is a great scampi recipe.  It has become one of my most requested dishes. I do use some garlic salt and I add red peppers and broccoli just to get some color and some veggies in there. Recently I also started adding some chicken stock (probably about a half cup) toward the end of the cooking process just to make it more saucy. It gets better as leftovers too! GREAT recipe!

I was looking for a way to salvage some chicken breasts from another recipe, which came out tasting like they had been poached. This worked well. In addition to all the listed ingredients, I used 1/2 cup white cooking wine, an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes in oil (drained) - reduced it down by simmering for about 10 minutes, then added the cooked chicken breasts, which I had sliced into medallions. They cooked for about five minutes, turning them over half way through. Then I put them on plates and sprinkled feta cheese over them. Wow - this is absolutely delicious.

This was very good and really simple to fix. It took less thirty minutes to have this on the table. Great for a weeknight meal. We loved this dish. I forgot to add the olive oil and didn't have lemon juice so I added some lemon pepper and a few drops of lemon extract.

I liked the recipe. I took someone's advice and used 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and it was a little too much for my family. I did like the white wine. Overall, a very good base for a good Scampi recipe. Even my 5 and 3 year old said it was "the best pasta ever!"I did cook the chicken for 15 minutes and it was too much, so next time I will check at 10 min.

This was a fast and easy dinner and my family really enjoyed it. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions, I cut down on the butter and oil (3T butter, 1T oil) used more garlic (8 cloves) and added 1/2 cup white once the chicken was partially cooked. I served this with pasta, so I added the pasta to the pan for the last few minutes the chicken was simmering to allow the pasta to really take on the flavors of the dish. I put Parmesan on the table and let everyone add as much or as little as they wanted. My mom ended up having three helpings!

Fantastic!  After slicing the breasts into thirds (fourths if they were very large breasts), I pounded them to flatten a bit.  My favorite meal at the Olive Garden was the chicken scampi and I remembered the pieces of chicken were pounded so I followed that lead.  I also added some white wine as other reviewers said and served over angle hair pasta along with garlic bread.  It was outstanding and will be a favorite in our household going forward.  It was easy and quick too which is definitely an added plus.  I'm thinking some asparagus would be amazing added to it so might try that next time.

I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little.  It was great and a really huge hit with my kids (they are really picky).

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delish!!  The chicken was moist and flavorful, it was hard to stop eating it.  I cut the chicken in cubes and added capers at the end of cooking.  Served it over angel hair pasta.  It is easy to make and is perfect for a weeknight family dinner, date or a dinner party.

I made this recipe, but I cut the butter a little and used the chicken broth and more garlic...I also added some grated romano cheese and a little italian breadcrumbs to thicken the sauce.  I cut the chicken into smaller chunks and served over penne.  I'll definitely make it again and will probably add some vegetable.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Served it with rice at Christmas Eve and everyone loved it.  One thing I did was cover it for the 10-15 minutes while the chicken was cooking and probably shouldn't have - it made the "sauce" more like a very thin broth.  I had to add some corn starch to thicken it up a little so it would coat the chicken pieces better.

This was a great recipe.  Super easy and even better the next day as a leftover.  I made a double batch and added mushrooms, yellow and orange peppers.  Next time I might add some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

This recipe was awesome!! I will definitely be making this again and again. I used 4 cloves of garlic and chicken tenderloins cut into medalions. I also cut up green, red, and yellow bell pepper and red onion and added fresh mushrooms. It really had a wonderful flavor. Yummo! Thanks for the great recipe and ideas on how to make it my own.

Very delicious and easy dish. You can add more of any ingredients based on your taste. I did use white wine and more garlic and lemon juice. Also fresh basil to taste. Chopped fresh tomato would also be a yummy last minute addtition. Thank you for the recipe!

As written, I would give it three stars.  I LOVE butter and am not scared of fat, but this recipe had too much butter and oil.  I will make it again, however I'll brown the chicken first, then remove it from the pan.  Then make up the sauce with less oil and butter and let it thicken up a bit before adding back the chicken and some vegetables.  Thanks.

Uhh YUM!!! The only changes that I made were that I dredged the chicken in flour with a little onion and garlic powder added to it first before pan frying. I also added more garlic just because we love it and threw in some red, yellow and orange peppers and onions for color. Everything else was kept exactly the same and it was WONDERFUL!! SOOO good. I cooked a whole box of spaghetti and added the cooked pasta to the dish and there was a perfect amount of sauce to coat the pasta as well. Tasted as good if not better than Olive Garden!

Very Tasty!   was a wonderful pasta dish.   I added the green and red peppers and onions per the other reviews, and the 1/2 cup of white wine as well (I used pinot grigio because I prefer sweeter), but I think I will increase it to 3/4 cup next time and double the whole sauce because it was that good!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe, I think I'm going to use this for shrimp scampi as well.

I have made this several times. It's a great recipe. I sometimes sub fresh herbs for dry- completely awesome. I have used this with less chicken than called for-2-3 and it works to feed a healthy eating family of four. I serve it with whole wheat pasta and whatever veggie I feel- Broccoli, tomato, peppers, etc. Also, this sauce on a smaller scale makes a great chicken marinade which I always do. Sometimes, I grill the chicken which is tasty as well and just make the sauce by itself. I love versatility and ease in recipes and this has it. Love it! Thanks for sharing.

I don't think we've ever eaten scampi of any kind before--I basically followed Judy's suggestion and we all enjoyed it very much--and a quick easy dinner--thanks so much for sharing!!  My rating is actually 4-1/2--don't know how to make 1/2 stars

Awesome! the whole family loved it and is asking for it to appear again and again in our dinner rotation! To make the chicken look more appealing and not so white( i think the pictures makes the dish look gross) I added olive oil to skillet preheated to high and quickly browned the chicken on both sides but it was not cooked through. Then i removed it from the pan, added the rest of the ingredients, including red bell peppers for color and flavor and baby bellas! i then returned the chicken to the pan to finish cooking then tossed with pasta! it was fabulous, will make again for sure! thanks for the recipie:)

This recipe has become has staple for me, especially when serving guests.  I cube my chicken and always add bell peppers (a mixture of green, red, orange or yellow), mushrooms, and a small onion. I also add a little more garlic than called for because of personal preference. If I have green onions on hand, I also throw them in there for added color.  Really delicious and great served over pasta!

Quick to make and delicious too! Substituted the dried seasonings with fresh herbs I had on hand (basil, parsley and cilantro). Also stirred in some cooked angel hair pasta at the end and cooked for a couple of extra minutes to warm the pasta. The pasta soaked up all the yummy sauce giving it a great flavor. Will definitely be making this again often.

Unfortunately, mine had a very light version of what the taste of scampi is to me. Perhaps when I recalculated to 8 servings, it lost it's true taste since it was a bigger batch. I'm going to try it again because the reviews were so positive. Wish me luck!

The flavor was AMAZING! I looooved the chicken!! But be aware- the sauce is VERY oily and runny, not creamy at all like usual. If you are planning on serving over pasta, I would recommend adding some cream or something to thicken up the sauce. I also doubled the garlic, but thats just my taste. Yummy indeed!

This was delicious.  I was trying to make it for five people and the sauce didn't quite go around but the taste was wonderful and the whole picky family liked it.  Daughter spoke up first and said "this is good", then the others piped in as well.  I was loving it.  I made it exactly as printed.  I did use jarred garlic and it splattered like crazy, but it tasted wonderful.

This recipe had a wonderful flavor.  We actually just at the chicken by itself instead of putting it over pasta and it was terrific.  The whole family loved it including my 2 yr old niece who is incredibly picky!

Dredged chicken in flour with S&P then cooked in pan; removed then made sauce with more garlic & fresh herbs; if you want extra sauce you need to double it.

I meant to add some white cooking wine with the lemon juice but totally spaced it.  I wish I had remembered because the sauce didn't really do it for me.  It was buttery (maybe too much) and the spices were there but it didn't quite hit the mark for me.  There were no complaints from the rest of the family, however.

I added peppers and onions and used a lot more garlic and this recipe was amazing! Served over pasta it's a really easy and quick dinner.

A good basis for an excellant recipe.  I myself made a few mistakes such as adding the called for butter and than additional within the cooking time.  I would add a little more lemon than called for next time.  Family not terribly impressed but picky eaters ate, which counts for something!

Was good with the few modifications recommended.  Added 1/4 cup of white wine, red and yellow peppers, and a red onion.  I also reduced the amount of butter by half.

FANTASTIC! this was great! everyone loved. Did seem a little oily- but thats probably why it tasted so good. I will most likely reduced butter & oil next time, just to see how that works for "diet" resons. It was awesome as is though!

This was a tasty dish.  I agree with some of the other comments that other ingredients could be added for texture and flavor.  I doubled the butter, added less olive oil and added 1/2 c chicken broth (white wine probably would have been tastier).  Also, next time I will marinate the chicken breasts in the herbs to make the chicken more flavorful to tie in with the dish.  My chicken didn't have time to absorb the wonderful fllavors with the cooking time.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it again with some tweeking.

Tasted great and the whole family loved it. Even my 5 and 7 yr old. The chicken came out pretty dry though. Next time I'll have to find a way to fix that. But will make it again. I served it with mushroom rice and cooked carrots.

My daughter and I both thought this was amazing and deserved more than 5 stars, but my husband and son didn't think it was all that.  I used 1/2 cup white wine, increased the lemond juice by 1 TBS, added 5 more cloves of garlic, sweet peppers and musrooms as another reviewer had suggested.  I couldn't have been happier.  This will go into my rotation when boys are scouting:).

This was very good.  I read the reviews and added extra garlic & lemon juice, red and green bell pepper, white wine and mushrooms.  Would cut the butter in half next time.  I guess it was a hit- I cooked for hubby and teenage son for Valentine's Day and there is not evenn enough left for lunch tomorrow. Definitely double for more than 3!

Excellent. I used chicken tenders, browned them ahead of time with chopped garlic. I made 1.5 times the amount of sauce,just to make sure I had enough, and it worked perfectly.I added a red pepper and a splash of white wine before adding the chicken - each tender cut into 3 pieces -  back to the sauce. This one makes it to my recipe box!

For me, this needed more lemon juice to boost the flavor.  I also found that adding some broccoli was a delicious way to easily incorporate vegetables.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had one chicken breast and recipe was in my email so decided  to give it a try. Didn't use the olive oil, just the butter and used Spice Island's The Chef's Shake, some oregano and the parsley. I didn't have lemons so I didn't add the juice. Came out pretty good, will make it again

This was great over fettucini pasta. We added red and yellow pepper to give it some colour and more flavour. Next time we would add some sort of onion as well.

Excellent starter recipe.  I made as recipe states, adding a little more garlic for my own taste.  It came out quite good, but I think some white wine would add some depth, and the chicken needed some seasoning.  Otherwise, very very good.  Kids loved it too.  Served over angel hair.  Thanks for the recipe.

This gets 4 stars instead of 5 because it needed more garlic/herbs. Next time, I'll toss some chopped tomatoes in with the pasta. Good recipe, but it does need something a bit... more (certainly not more butter, though).

I thought this was very good but added extras.  I added extra lemon juice, butter and the herbs.  I also added white cooking wine.  I served this with Asparagas but I think the pasta itself needs any of the following: sauteed peppers, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes and/or capers.  I think any of these would give the meal just a little more depth.

Ths was great. I've made it twice. I made a few slight changes the first time, but kept it pretty much the same. The second time I changed it up a bit with addition of dried chives, and threw some fresh chopped tomatoes and green onion in with the chicken for the last 5-10 minutes of itcooking. I also only used 1/4 cup butter and a little more garlic and lemon juice. I served it over angel hair pasta. My husband is a picky eater and he loved it so much, I'm sure I will be making it often.

WOW! I only wish I had a bigger frying pan to make a larger amount! The only thing I did with this recipe was add about 1/4 cup of white wine (and that's only because I was drinking it while I was cooking and thought it would add a nice touch, haha).  This recipe tasted even better than it smelled.  I even warmed up the leftovers the day after and had it for lunch...just as amazing as the night before! Thanks for this terrific recipe!

Delicious! I cut the chicken into smaller chunks. Also reduced butter & olive oil and added 1/2 cup white wine per prior recommendations. It smells and tastes soooooo good. And the leftovers are warmed up nicely by browning slighly in a frying pan. Yummy!

Excellent!  I was fiending for some garlic and this looked like a good recipe for my fix.  Like many others who reviewed this dish I cut WAY back on the margarine, by about half, and used Country Crock Light margarine.  I also used less olive oil.  I added a splash of white wine and an extra clove of garlic.  I tossed the sauce with linguine.  Excellent stuff!

Loved it!  I just used an Italian Herb mix (instead of suggested seasonings) and included 1/4 cup of white wine.    Next time I will definitely make sure I have fresh crusty bread with it and also add some peppers to the recipe as another reviewer suggested.

Made it exactly as the recipe said (except cut the chicken into a bit smaller pieces), and it was great.. I thought that the "sauce" was too thin and buttery, but then I realized that it's quite a lot like oil with herbs one might normally put on pasta. Good stuff!

used about 2tbs evoo and 3 tbs butter. sauteed 1/2 chopped onion, 4 fresh cloves of garlic and ingredient spices. dredged chx in flour with paprika and s&p. added wine and lemon, chicken broth then covered and simmered for 15-20 min. served over linguine. it tasted very good, and would have given this recipe 5 stars, but i think the oregano is out of place here.

Wow! I usually don't comment on the recipe, but this was too good!  I also added 1/2 cup chardonnay with the lemon juice (I didn't even have enough lemon juice, and it still turned out great), and mushrooms. I could just make this sauce with rice or orzo and be very happy!!

This was fantastic!! My family and inlaws loved it. I used large breasts so doubled the sauce so I can toss it with angel hair pasta. I also cooked some mushrooms and onions to go with it. Will definitely make again. Wonderful!

Excellent recipe and easy to make.  I used chicken fajita strips.  I covered the strips with flour and minced garlic seasoning before following the recipe.  Afterwards, I mixed the strips with fettucine and added alfredo sauce.  The dish got rave reviews.

I added red, green and yellow bell peppers to try for the Olive Garden imitation. Good, but lacking something, I will increase the spices if I make this again.

In the scampi sauce throw in all kinds of bell peppers for a sautee partay, hehe. Now the chicken: keep the the breast whole but cut them into thin cutlets and then cover em with suran wrap and pound the  outta them! Then dip them in flour and then toss em into the scampi. you can pull out the peppers while the chix is cooking so that they dont burn. GREAT RECIPEEEEEEE!

This was okay. Served it with angel hair, broccoli, and crescent rolls, with pigs-in-a-blanket for appetizer and chocolate cake for dessert. The chicken had a definite scampi flavor, and was good reheated for lunch the following day. But it was a bit too oily/greasy to be completely enjoyed.

Easy and excellent.  My two very picky daughters love the taste and I love the simplicity.  I stir in the noodles with about five minutes left to give them flavor. Do not be afraid to season to taste.  Just make sure you taste as you go. Definitely use with shrimp too.

This recipe is a staple in my house, it's quick and easy and everyone loves it.  I made a few modifications to suite our families taste buds.  First I add more garlic usually I double what is suggested.  I also simmer the chicken scampi on very low for a little longer to infuse the different flavors into the chicken.

I've been making this dish for about 8 years, and it never disappoints. The only thing I do different than this recipe is maybe add a little more butter, and about 1tsp of lemon pepper. God it's wonderful.

I used thin sliced chicken cutlets and cooked it on low and the garlic still burned. If you decide to use fresh herbs, you need to put them in a lot later or else they will burn too. Not bad, but not great either.

I made this using others' suggestions... I doubled the sauce (actually only used 3/4C of butter instead of 1) and used a 1/2 cup of white wine.  I also used fresh herbs instead of dried.  The sauce really was delicious... of course very rich, but delicious.  My problem had nothing to do flavor but more with the combination of that rich sauce and chicken.  The recipe SOUNDED like it would be really good but in reality the combination of the super-rich sauce and the chicken just didn't do it for me.  For lack of another word, the chicken seemed too HEAVY for such a rich sauce. For leftovers i'll use the sauce over pasta alone and probably cut the chicken up into a salad. Would be willing to try it with shrimp ... if I made it again I'd add more spices as well as it was a bit bland.  Maybe more salt/wine/lemon/basil.  Not more garlic!

This recipe calls for an incredible amount of butter!  And I added a hearty spoonful of Country Crock garlic butter.  It was tasty, but didn't have enough "oomph."  Maybe because I omitted some of the herbs we don't like: basil and oregano.  Buttery sauce was tasty on pasta.

This was scrumptious over angel hair pasta! Because some reviewers complained that it was bland, I cooked an entire sliced onion in the butter/olive oil and doubled the spices and lemon juice. The family loved it - they said "I don't know what's in this sauce, but I want some more!" I'll probably be making it again tomorrow night.

This chicken is great!! I use 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup olive oil when I make it. I also double the garlic and lemon juice. I slice the chicken into strips before cooking. I also use this for shrimp. My husband loves it!  Usually I do not like scampi, but I love this!

Very good, and very easy to make. I added some wine to it while it was cooking, but it was still missing that little something extra. I will play around with the recipe to see, maybe add more of something.

We tend to like spicy food but I decided to change it up some. I gave this a shot and it just wasn't very flavorful. Wasn't bad just kind of meh. Not sure what I would do differently.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  Toss the chicken and the sauce with angel hair pasta at the end to make an unbeatable favorite.  Next time I'm thinking about adding mushrooms and maybe some finely chopped zucchini.  The recipe doesn't NEED it, but I would just like some more vegetables.  I'm sure that substituting shrimp for chicken would also be a no-brainer (-just a shorter cooking time).

I halved the recipe and then added a can of chicken broth and stirred in about a half cup of sour cream to the sauce when the chicken was pretty near cooked.  This thickened the sauce a little and gave it more flavour. It was yummy over mashed potatoes.

This recipe is great because most of the ingredients you already have at home making it quick and easy! My fiance loves the taste of this meal and one night by chance his mom had some too... She loved it! (thank you!) The only drawback in my opinion is the fat content.

Great recipe! I cut the oil in half as others suggested and added a little more butter. I also added chicken broth and a little (like 3 tbs) heavy cream with a little cornstarch to make it stick to my thin spaghetti. My husband and kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds. It is a heavy dish so I served it with a salad of baby spinach. Next time I would add some fresh steamed broccoli or maybe some snow peas. After dinner my husband made it a point to ask me make this again!

This was good. After reading reviews I did as suggested and added some ingredients. I added a tablespoon more butter, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1/4 cup vermouth, 1&1/4 teaspoon fresh basil (instead of dried), & 1/4 teaspoon fresh  rosemary. About 5 mins before it was done I added half a diced tomato. I also cubed the chicken. It was so flavorful & delicious. Already getting request to make it again. :)

The recipe was pretty good, didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked.  It tasted better the 2nd day.  My husband like it but recommeded that I use more butter and less oil, it was a bit oily.  Overall it was a really easy recipe and I enjoyed it.  I will defintly make this again.  This is great recipe when you are pushed for time.

Very tasty and easy!  Great for a fast night.  I did take the recommendation of adding 1/2 c white wine, and added strips of green and red peppers and Vidalia onions.  Served it with my favorite rice.... 1 1/2 cup water with two chicken boullion cubes, 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 stick butter, 1 cup of rice.  Bring liquids and butter to boil, add rice, bring back to boil and simmer for 20 min.  Scampi is supposed to be buttery and a thin sauce.

My SO and I made this together. We took the advice of other reviews and cut the butter in half and added wine,  and then doubled all of the spices. We thought it tasted a little salty, so we doubled the wine, olive oil, and spices again. It was *really* good, but it reminded us of pizza a little bit. We decided that we will absolutely be making this again, but might alter it a little bit. Oh, and we added red, green, and yellow peppers to it -- I highly recommend it!!

I have made this recipes many times, since it's my daughter's favorite.  I increase all the ingredients since I serve it over a pound of angel hair.  I do decrease the butter & oil a touch & instead add Robusto Italian salad dressing & capers to the mixture, it adds extra flavor & color.  My family loves this recipe, but it sure isn't for anyone that's trying to eat healthy.

I like that this is a good middle of the week dinner - easy and quick - no exotic ingredients.  But it's bland.  I did cut the butter and oil in half and it was more than adequate.  I added the pasta to the chicken in the pan for additional flavor.  Someone else suggested adding this chicken to alfredo sauce and I agree - that would be very good. Three stars for taste, four stars for ease!

Sooo delicious! I suggest cooking this on low heat to let the chicken absorb the sauce, add a little more lemon and garlic, and it's a GREAT addition to alfredo sauce! I just waited until the chicken was cooked before I added the sauce and served it over angel hair pasta. Huge hit! Everbody loved how moist and flavorful the chicken was... I will definitely try this again!

I was not impressed with this chicken. The sauce was very oily and the spices and garlic ended up burning. I rated this a 3 because it was quick and easy, but I probably wont make this again.

I have been looking for a quick scampi recipe and I finally found it! This recipe is quick, easy and delicious, however,I doubled the amount of garlic (I'm Italian)and it is just wondeful. It really does take only 15 minutes and only 1 pan. I highly recommend this easy dish to any Scampi lover.  Next time I'll try shrimp!

Simply delicious!  I have made this recipe several times as it is a big hit with my family.  Even the two-year-old eats every bite!  That's a good indicator of a great recipe!  I generally serve it over linguini noodles or penne, or sometimes even bowtie pasta for some fun for the kids.  I also accompany it with fresh sourdough bread to soak up the sauce.  Mmmm...so good!  The only thing you have to watch is not to scorch the sauce.  I have done this twice now (got distracted and let it get too hot) and it turned all the garlic dark brown and changed the overall taste a little.  It was still good, but definitely tastes better if you keep an eye on it and don't scorch it.  This recipe will continue to be one of my personal favorites for a long, long time.

This was very good and very easy.  My family loved it, even my very picky son and husband. I used 2 tsp Italian seasoning rather than the seasonings suggested. I did serve it over bow tie pasta as suggested and doubled the sauce for dipping crusty bread.  yum!

Exxcellent. There is a local pizzeria that makes this dish and this turned out just like it- I left the sauce alone and  added marinated artichoke hearts and  sundried tomatoes to make it more like the one I'm used to.

I thought this was a great recipe.  The scampi part of it tastes just like the shrimp scampi I order only with chicken instead.  I made some white rice for the side and poured the extra sauce on top of it.  Very yummy!  This will be a recipe I will make again!!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I fix it for. I do make one modification.  After the chicken is browned I add italian bread crumbs to the skillet, mix them in and cook for about 2 minutes.  Yummie!!!!

The sauce of this dish was delicious served over angel hair pasta. The chicken didn't seem to absorb much of the flavor though, maybe I overcooked it.

This was absolutely great, my whole family liked it.  I did not have basil, but it turned out ok without it.  I did add extra lemon juice (1/2 tsp.) and an extra clove of garlic.  I was afraid it was going to be greasy with all the butter (I used real butter)  and olive oil, but it wasn't.  Overall....great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!  Can't wait to make it for company.

Just made this tonight. The only thing I changed was I forgot to buy the fresh garlic and had to use minced jarred.   We love it, it's easy, tastey and has ingredients that I always have on hand! 
I did serve this over linguine with aspargus as a side as well as a ceasar salad. YUMMMM!  Thanks!!!  We'll be making this again!

The chicken was very good. Used thigh and leg meat instead and came out so moist and flavorful.  The scampi "sauce" is very buttery (guess I should have figured that out) and I recommend serving this with a plain pasta.  Tried it with rice and not so appealing but no fault of the recipe.

This was a wonderful meal.  I did not have any fresh garlic and it still turned out great.  I added thin onion slices and green bell peppers.  Next time I plan to use fresh garlic.  I did not have any in the house but garlic powdered worked fine.  Also, I plan to use red and yellow bell peppers too.  I used thin spaghetti noodles and tossed them in with the chicken mixture just before serving.  I absolutely love this recipe!  Thanks.

Delicious! Everybody loved it, four kids AND a picky husband. I used 5 huge chicken breast and  increased the garlic to 4 gloves, and the lemon juice to 2 tablespoons. The chicken is so tender and tasty. Severed over linguine. Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch. It is definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe although pretty fattening with all the oil and butter.  I did add some white wine to the dish and instead of preparing my chicken as directed, I actually prepared mine homeade shake and bake style with breadcrumbs, herbs and cheese.  Delicious, especially with the addition of the wine to the sauce.  I also added more garlic to the sauce for extra flavor.  I served it over fettucini noodles with some summer squash, zucchini, asparagus and red peppers.  Everything came out great.  Restaurant quality.

I loved this recipe, because it was delicious and was so easy to make!  I added more lemon juice and some capers toward the end of cooking, and thought that it was just perfect!  Thanks!

I found this to be a great recipe. Very flavorful and everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I did double the lemon juice as suggested and I added more garlic than called for. Served with rice and broccoli that are great for pouring the sauce over. Very good although I will not make it often given the fact that it is high in both fat and calories.  It would however be a good main dish for company, easy and fairly economical.

There was not much flavor at all. I did as others suggested and added white wine, while cutting down on the broth..it was just bland.
I even added shrimpb  to give it a little something, but it did no good. I will not make again!

We scaled this to serve 10 and were pretty nervous about doing so, but thankfully it was a hit! We put the chicken over angel hair pasta and... Wow! Very good recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Followed the recipe to a "t" with the exception of adding a few shrimp and tossing the pasta in the butter/oil mixture and it turned out awesome.  Rave reviews from family. Thanks

Used what people recommended.  Made for dh's b-day...big mistake. Not that great.  Should have seen the face he made.  Would NOT recommend adding the chicken broth, etc.

I was disappointed in this and thought it lacked flavor compared to other scampi I've had.  It definitely would be improved by the addition of some wine.

This is a great, easy dish! I made it with 1/4 cup butter and 3 tbls of olive oil. All I had were chicken tenders and they worked great. Two of us in my family are low carb eaters so I served it over shredded cauliflower that I steamed. My father would still think it was rice if we hadn't told him what it was! The only complaint was that there weren't any leftovers. This was really good and so fast! I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very good...I did follow others suggestions and tweaked the recipe a bit and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!!!  I reduced the amount of butter and oil to about half of what it said.  I added 1/2 can of chicken broth (99% fat free) and about 1/4 cup or white wine (Chardonnay).  I substituted italian seasoning for basil and oregano.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and added 1 whole chopped tomatos.  I simmered all of this at about medium to medium-low heat until the chicken was cooked through (about 20-30 mins) and tomatos were almost translucent.  I cooked the noodles and added right into the skillet with the chicken and the sauce.  I served with hawaiian rolls since I didn't have garlic bread on hand.  My husband LOVED it and had seconds and even thirds!!! :)  He sneaked into the kitchen with his rolls and mopped up the rest of the sauce in the skillet with his rolls!!

I loved this recipe! I added a few things to make it a complete meal:
1/2 cup chopped red onion
1/2 cup chopped green pepper
1/2 cup chopped red pepper
I added these ingredients in the first step and let the onions and peppers sautee. Then I followed step two and served over angel hair pasta. It was great!

This is a great dish that my family loves. Serve with rice to sop up the juice. We also like to double the garlic and lemon juice. An alternate way to make it is to slice the chicken and dip in an egg wash. Then coat with flour and fry. Remove the chicken, make the sauce and add together again in the pan. My family especially loves it this way. Not as healthy, but really good!

I decided to make this recipe for dinner, being that it got high marks and good reviews. It was not very good, my husband didn't like it either.  I did what other users mentioned:  Cut the butter, oil and salt in half, doubled the lemon juice and added some chicken broth. I served it over penne pasta.  The sauce was still too oily and too runny for the pasta.  Although the chicken was very moist and tender it still tasted very bland.  I will not be making this dish again.

This recipe is wonderful!  The  best part is that it's so easy to prepare.  It tastes great over fettucini noodles. I was out of butter so I used margarine and it still tastes good.

Can I just say that I love this dish??  It is so good and unique.  It has its own flavor, and may not look like anything special but it has a great taste to it.  I think its because of the lemon juice.  I always serve it with penne pasta and cube the chicken.  This makes a lot though, but can be frozen in Glad containers for lunch or such.

This recipe is not bad.  A little bite oily.  Next time I probably cut the fat in half and add chicken both like the other suggested.  Great flavor thought.

Out of all the recipes we've tried for scampi this is by far the best.  I already can't wait to make it again.  It is very falvorful, easy, and filling.  I actually just finished off the leftovers for lunch and it was just as good!  
Some additions:
Place 1/4 cup of water and one chicken bouillion cube in the microwave until disolved.  Add a 1/4 cup of Chardonnay (we use Cafe Chardonnay).  Add all of this to the saute when adding lemon juice.  Cook 2 cups of egg noodles and toss generously with the chicken scampi for each serving.
Excellent recipe!

Thia was a hit! I followed the advice of others and cut the butter down by half and only added a small amount of oil. I also sauteed the chicken first, and then made the sauce. I added more garlic and that was a win as well. I will definately make this again.

Not quite as good as I expected given the high ratings.  I think the recipe as it is needs a little modification... less butter, less salt, and a little more of something else.

This was delicious and easy.  I cut the butter to about a third of a stick and it turned out great.  My husband loved it too and this is not the kind of thing he normally likes, Lots of flavor in a little time!

This recipe tastes like the chicken has been marinated without marinating it, and takes very little time.  I suggest cutting the butter considerably and adding more lemon if you like a zestier taste.  This one is definitely a keeper as everyone in the family loved it.

Very easy recipe, but I found the chicken itself to be a bit bland. The butter sauce was delicious, though - I included sauted mushrooms and served with spaghetti.

I followed just about everyone's advice and cut back on the fats & added stock and white wine.  I also added more lemon and garlic.  Thoses simple changes made this dish excellent.  My two children (5 & 2) gobbled it up.  My husband & I really enjoyed it too.

update - I've been making this for years now and recently discovered it also works great as a chicken in a pita sandwich!  Gotta love a multi-purpose recipe :)

Loved this dish. I used the chicken tenders(quick and easy) instead of cutting up the chicken breast. I also used only half of the butter the recipe called for and a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead of 1/4c. I added 1/2c. white wine and increased the lemon juice. I quickly seared the chicken in a fry pan with a little olive oil, removed, and made the sauce. Added the chicken back in and cooked till done. I served this over rice. The sauce is excellent! Family loved it...will make again soon!

Great recipe.  It was pretty easy and my family really liked it!  I used chicken strips and I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and it tasted great.  Make sure to pour sauce from the pan right over your chicken.  Delicious!  Will make again!

This is sooo good and easy to prepare.  I cut my chicken into bite size pieces, increased the lemon juice to about 4 Tablespoons, and added about 1/2 cup white wine as others had suggested.  I served it over plain white rice with steamed vegetables and fresh dinner rolls.  My very picky 5 year old was disapointed that there were no leftovers today for lunch and begged me to make it again.  Needless to say it is again on the menu for next week.

A low carb dream!!!  Delicious.  I made this with shrimp tonight and it was awesome!  I steamed some broccoli and then tossed it in the sauce with the shrimp.  It was unbelievable.  This is the reason I love the Atkins diet.  No guilt eating shrimp and broccoli dripping in butter and olive oil!  One note: when I made it with chicken, I think I overcooked it a bit which made the chicken a little tough.  Be careful to stop cooking immediately after it is cooked through.

Wow!  This was yummy!  It was quick and full of flavor.  I used extra garlic and added mushrooms.  I served it on leftover rice topped with parmsean.  Next time I will substitue some chicken broth for the butter.

I made this for just myself, using 2 chicken breasts cut into 5 strips, and will have another meal from it. I served it over orzo, spooning some of the buttery sauce on the pasta. Next time, I would double the lemon juice, and maybe add some capers!

This was pretty good. I used a 3 lb bag of boneless breasts(6 breasts) I added about 1 cup of chicken broth rather than adding more butter so we would have enough sauce to serve over noodles. Thanks Cyndee!

This was the BEST! I used chicken thighs so it took a little longer to cook. A delicious seasoning blend! I used garlic butter in place of the regular butter just to give it more of a garlicky taste. I even made shrimp scampi the next night using this recipe! I can't rave about it enough! It's just terrific!Try it you'll see.....

Great flavors. I cut down on the oil and butter, added more garlic, and added steamed broccoli florets when the chicken was done. Served it over angel hair pasta with romano cheese. It was a bit dry (should have added some chicken stock to make up for the reduced oil) but still tasted good.

ABSOLUTELY TASTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was so good my fiance went back for seconds.  It was oh, sooooo good.
I like spicy, so I took the liberty of adding 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with the other spices, and 1 tablespoon of white wine along w/the lemon juice.  I can't belive how tasty this was !!!!!

This dish is a bit heavy and fattening, however it tastes wonderful.  I add a splash of crisp dry white wine (like a sav blanc) with the lemon to add a little more complexity to the flavours.  This dish is great, be sure to have some bread on hand to capture some of the sauce!

This recipe was awesome.  I used about 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Try to have your ingrediants pre-measured because it goes quickly.  Gave the recipe to a co-worker and she loved it.  Will definately make again!

Not bad. Good with pasta. Not like Olive Garden chicken scampi (I think a prior review compared the two). Simple to make.

This was delicious...I made it over spaghetti, which absorbed a lot of the oil.  Great recipe.

Delicious!  I can't wait to make this one again, but like others, I do think extra butter and olive oil are necessary, especially if served over pasta!  Definitely not for low-fat diets!!

This was just the best thing since sliced bread!!  It was so easy.  I used a little more garlic and lemon juice, but other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T."  I served it over pasta that I had tossed with some of what was left in the pan after cooking the chicken, and I served it with a big salad, crusty rolls, and french cut green beans.  Hubby was VERY appreciative!!!  He said it tasted better than anything he has had in a restaurant.  Thanks Cyndee!

I added green bell peppers and onions to make this dish more like the one at the Olive Garden. I served it over fettuccine and it was great. It was very quick and easy too.

This was excellent!  I have to cook for a picky child and even he loved it. I followed the recipe completely then served it over linguini and spooned the sauce over it. Added a side of fresh steamed broccoli. Will absolutely make this dish again.  Very easy and flavorful with ingredients that are generally in everyone’s pantry.

very good recipe for base. made some adjustments based on preference but I am thrilled with the recipe because I would not have thought to cook the chicken in so much sauce and I do believe it helps to keep it from drying out. next time I might reduce the fat a tad and add some broth. additions I made based upon preference:. lots of minced garlic...about 3-5 large cloves. added approximately 1/4 white wine with the lemon. sprinkled a good amount of flour on chicken before sauteeing, and lots of freshly grated locatelli Romano cheese. also did not cook chicken as long. I added sauteed spinach which was a nice addition.

I was craving shrimp scampi and came across this recipe. Very good. Reminds me a bit of the Olive Garden Chicken Scampi. I made this exactly as written except I lightly coated the chicken with flour and added some red and green peppers and a couple shakes of granulated garlic on top of the minced garlic. I thought it was good, but definitely needs some tweaking next time I make it. A lot less olive oil (it was pretty dominant over the other flavors), a lot more garlic (2-3x more), more salt and a lot more lemon. I'd like to try adding some white wine with it as well. Overall super easy to make, with ingredients I already had on hand. Good recipe that I will play around with.

Don't hold back on the Lemon Juice. Probably could add a couple more cloves of garlic. Good base, could add some onion powder to thicken it a bit more to cling to the noodles. Thanks for posting

Loved it!! I added some cream at end on low heat and little more
Lemon juice to balance the flavors and it was incredible!  For a low-carb option we served it over sautéed julienne zucchini and red and yellow bell peppers!

this was delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I did add fresh chopped parsley at the last minute of cooking which gave it an extra pop of brightness to the flavor and added some fresh cracked black pepper.

I thought this dish was bland. It needed tomatoes & onions to give it more flavor. The sauce was just butter & olive oil, with some spices & that was it. Definitely tweaking  the recipe the next time I make this.

This is a staple in our house! Great, easy recipe. I did make a few changes; however, I add a little Chardonnay and some chopped green pepper and purple onion at the end to add color and texture. I also place the pasta in the pan along with the sauce to add extra flavor. So good! Thanks for the recipe

This was delicious, especially since I followed lovin'life's suggestions. I added white wine, mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, red onion, and extra lemon juice.  It was bomb, and tasted like scampi. Amazing.

I reduced the butter by about 3 tablespoons & the oil by less than half.  I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  I found it a bit too greasy, even with the reduced butter & oil so I dissolved 1tbls of cornstarch in some chicken broth & added that.  It helped a bit, but I still found it rather oily. I don't think I'll try this again.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I've been using allrecipies for years but this dish is the first I've ever rated because it really is that good!   I dredged the chicken in flour before cooking and sauteed red, green and yellow peppers and fresh mushrooms in a separate pan and added to the chicken the last 5 minutes of cook time.  I also used 1/4 to 1/3 cup of white wine and chicken broth to make the sauce a bit thinner.  This is a fabulous base recipe!

Omg! This was amazing! So delicious! What's not to like about butter and garlic! I followed recipe exactly except added about 1/2-1 cup white wine in with the sauce. I used about 2 1/4lbs chicken tenders and cubed them and doubled the sauce and then tossed the cooked penne in with the sauce. Absolutely wonderful. Served for company and everyone loved it! Topped with just a bit of parm cheese on top. Amazing!

This dish was amazing. My husband and I loved it. I added half an onion, diced. Sautéed with the butter and garlic.  Otherwise I followed the directions and it came out perfect. Making it for dinner tonight.

I didn't not like it. It needed something, more of a sauce, bacon bits, something. Adding Parmesan helped.

Excellent starting point. I added red and yellow bell peppers, artichoke hearts, red onions, dry sherry and chicken base instead of salt. Add the veggies in the last few minutes of cooking. Served over angle hair pasta, it was great. Thanks.

I thought the picture of the dish looked palely unappealing so I sauteed/browned the chicken in the butter/olive oil right at the start.  When it was cooked, I removed the chicken, then added the garlic and herbs to the pan, added 1/2 c. white wine along with the tablespoon of lemon juice, did a reduction to get all the good bits up off the pan.  I cooked some bowtie pasta (I had no linguine) and combined everything for a nice meal.  I used less salt and probably half the butter called for.  I'll likely make this again but I will cut the chicken in bite size pieces and salt it directly before cooking.

Very good!  Cut butter back to 1/4 cup, 2 tbs olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt for two breasts.  Would probably add more garlic and might try the white wine suggestion from others.

This was really good. Husband said it is definitely worth a repeat. I added more garlic and a little more lemon and 1/4 cup of white wine like others suggested. I also used mushrooms too and a red bell pepper and a little red onion. I baked everything at 425 degrees for about 37 minutes. Served it over brown rice and green beans. Tasty!

This got a rare big thumbs up from both the kid and the husband. I did take the advice of others and add more garlic, more lemon (2 whole squeezed lemons b/c I felt like that's how much it took to get the flavor), dredged the chicken lightly in flour, and added some white wine. Tossed it with angel hair pasta and it made a delicious meal we all enjoyed. I just wish it wasn't so high in fat or calories so I wouldn't feel guilty about making it more often.

Wonderful! I have never reviewed a recipe, but this one was really great!  Made it as is, except used 2 extra pieces of chicken and added a little more butter, etc. to allow for that.

Wow!  This was a huge hit!  I have three boys and my middle one is such a picky eater.  He ate three servings for dinner and finished the leftovers for lunch!  I followed the ingredients but I used fresh herbs, more lemon juice and added a little white cooking wine.  After it was done I placed the chicken on top of angel hair pasta, added a little extra sauce and it was delicious!

This is easy and tasty! My husband is not a fan of seafood, so this is an alternative to shrimp scampi. He loves the sauce so much, he sops it all up with bread. I am adding this to my regular rotation! (I use Brummel and Brown spread instead of butter to lessen the calories, and it is still yummy).

This recipe is really close to 5 stars. I added wine, extra garlic and mushrooms, plus milk/corn starch to thicken. Next time I'll cut back on the wine and/or lemon juice, brown the chicken in advance, use cream instead of milk/corn starch, and add green onions and sun-dried tomatoes like they do at my favorite Italian restaurant, and more garlic. I also served it over angel hair pasta, but because I cooked it too long it came out mushy. Probably use spaghetti pasta next time.

My husband loved this recipe.  I made it as written except I squirted more lemon on mine because I love lemon. Other than that I thought it was good. It definitely needs rice or pasts or even bread to sop up the delicious butter herb sauce.

So good!  And easy!  The only things I changed was adding an extra clove of garlic, a little extra lemon juice and 4oz of chicken broth.  I also halved the butter and olive oil.  I will make this again!

Great recipe!  I added a cut up onion, cup of sliced sweet peppers, and a teaspoon of dried jalapeno red peppers for a little spice.  I served it over a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of Quinoa and Brown Rice for a health kick. My family loved it and I will be making it again on Scampi night.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I served it over angel hair pasta and the only changes I made was to add a 1/2 cup white wine, added a half of a yellow and red pepper, red onion and mushrooms. I definitely will make this again.

So easy, so good!  Wanted to lick the dish.  Used bite sized pieces of breast and tenderloin.  Added a splash of white wine and broccoli florets.

After reading many reviews I decided to double the recipe for my family of 5 and use 1c pinot grigio {because that was what I had in the house} and added  the lemon and peppers as well as my own addition of a Tbs of chicken base.  The sauce was so yummy, the chicken a bit on the dry side and the addition of the yellow pepper was not really nessesary.  Loved the sauce may use shrimp or crab legs in the sause next time.  I would also make the sauce first then reduce and add the chicken just to cook to prevent the dry taste.

This was better than Olive Garden. I made this yesterday for 4th of July and everyone LOVED it. I doubled the recipe and got a huge bowl full of delicious Chicken Scampi. I too added the 1/2 cup white wine as well as sautéed red onion, bell pepper, garlic and tomatoes. Instead of searing the chicken, I grilled it ahead of time and once the sauce was made, I put the sliced grilled chicken in and stirred it on low heat for about 3 minutes. Just enough for it to get flavor. I used wheat angel hair pasta and mixed everything together and then served. This was an amazing recipe. Thanks to everyone who suggested the tweaks! It was simply delicious :-)

Really good, but WAY too much salt.  Next time I'll cut it to 1/4 tsp and add some red pepper.

This is a wonderfully rich and lemony treatment for chicken breasts.  I served it over rice and we loved it.  Don't even think about cutting back on the salt -- it's important in this recipe.

I followed other reviews and  doubled the garlic, added 1/4 white wine and dredged the chicken in flour.  It was very tasty but I don't think I will dredge the chicken next time I make it... We also mixed bowties in at the end to soak up the sauce !

This recipe was very good and reminded me of the Chicken Scampi dish I always order at Olive Garden.  I used 5 large cloves of garlic and added the minced garlic to the olive oil for 10 minutes prior to cooking. I also used 2 tbsps of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of white wine. Also added red and yellow peppers and red onion. Turned out really well.

I was really surprised at how easy and tasty this dish was.  I used half of the butter as well as half of the olive oil, and believe I could have afforded to use even less butter.  I used fresh parsley and like other reviewers added white wine as well as frozen mixed peppers ( was all I had) and mushrooms.  Delicious and light.

Awesome recipe. I'd like to make some more so I could commit this recipe to memory & measure by sight & hands. Also, I'd like to try what approximately 20 people suggested to "improve" this recipe but... I'm new to cooking & don't have much of an idea of what they mean.

Followed recipe exactly except added a splash of chick broth and only used two chick breasts.  Broth was unnecessary and would cut back on butter next time, but otherwise very good.

This is really good - I have made it with shrimp too.  Based on other reviewers' recommendations, I halved the amount of butter, added only 2 tbsp. of olive oil instead of 1/4 cup, and added in 1/2 cup white wine (just white cooking wine).  I also added in some chopped bell peppers and red onion for extra flavor and color.

I have no idea what I did wrong but it tasted like nothing but oil over noodles. I followed exacty as the recipe said plus about 1/4-1/2 cup white wine. Only thing I can guess was the wine I used wasn't appropriate...?? I was so excited but very disappointed! :(

My family and extended family loved this - I double it and add a pound of pasta but you could add more pasta. I serve it with parmesan and red pepper flake and add a little more lemon juice.

I've made this several times, but am just now getting around to rating it. This is an easy, quick, flavorful dish. I have used Italian seasoning when I was out of the dried parsley and basil, and I always use more chicken and lemon juice than called for in the recipe. I add black pepper, as well, and sometimes chopped onion (which I like even better). I usually cook some pasta noodles and toss with this and then add a vegetable for a very fast dinner on a busy night. My kids enjoy it, and there are never any leftovers!

Alright, my version of this came out totally different than chicken scampi is supposed to be, because I used breaded vegan chicken patties cut into strips instead of actual chicken. Therefore, I came up with a very salty fried chicken. I think I may have made an amateur mistake and confused my teaspoons and tablespoons!  If you're looking for a good vegan fried chicken recipe, this one will do =].

This is a fantastic recipe!  I did however make it more pasta friendly by adding a tad bit more butter towards the end and a small amount of floor to thicken.  Then I added my cooked penne pasta to the skillet and YUM!

Thanks so much for this recipe!! I love shrimp scampi but my husband doesnt eat any kind of seafood. This was a wonderful solution for me. It's a really simple recipe as well, will definately be making this one again =)

This is a good recipe, but primarily due to other reviewer's opinions. I cut the butter down to basically liberally greasing the pan, and made up for it in wine (pinot grigio). I also cut down the olive oil by about half. I added more garlic and lemon juice than suggested, and used parmesan at the end. When I make it again, I'll be sure to use some chicken stock for extra flavor, melt a little parmesan into the sauce, and add the pasta to the chicken at the end for full flavor.

I loved this! We will be having this one one again and again. I added a little more lemon and cut some of the oil and it was fantastic! I was afraid it was going to be greasy with the oil but it wasn't. Definately going into rotation.

This was really good! I ended up using very close to a cup of butter. I used fresh parsley, basil and oregano because two out of the three I didn't have on hand. I followed the suggestion of using white wine as well, 1/4 cup. I used quite a bit more lemon juice than what the recipe calls for. I didn't really measure it, but if I could guess I would say between 3 to 4 tablespoons.  I also added a green bell pepper and would have added a red one, and some red onion if I had them. Overall I would give this recipe a 5 with the modifications I did:) My family was in heaven and I thought I didn't do to bad myself!

It was a great tasting recipe.  I would cut down the cooking time, as even 10 minutes made the chicken slightly dry.  Overall though, the chicken had a great flavor and I definitely prefer it over shrimp scampi!

PERFECT!! This is Hubby's new favorite chicken dish. It comes out delicious every time, exactly as the recipe states. I do cut the chicken into smaller, bite-size pieces, and it cooks a little faster, but that is the only change I make.

very tasty! But of course it should be tasty, with so much butter. I didn't skim all the reviews, but would love to see if someone found a less fattening way to make it, where it still tastes great. I added capers and mushrooms to the chicken, then added pasta directly to the chicken, as others suggested.

I just made this & thought it was excellent.  I did make it with two large boneless chicken breasts instead of four, as I was just cooking for myself.  Turned  out very good, had plenty of sauce.  :-)

Made this the other night for dinner. Very Easy...quick...and flavorful.  I added sliced roasted peppers frozen peas for color.  Used organice wheat spaghetti.  My kids loved it.  It was even better the next day -  had some leftovers.  The citrus flavor soaked in even more. Thank you for this easy to make recipe.  I will be making this again in the near future.

This recipe is not impressive. I took other reviewer's advice and added extra seasoning/garlic and it was still very bland.  I also cut the butter and olive oil in half and it was still too greasy. I will not be making this again.

Very easy and good. I decided to grill the chicken (kabobs) rather than saute it. So I marinated the chicken in all the ingredients except butter. Turned out great!

My husband is not a chicken fan. The only pasta he likes is mac & cheese. I made this as is & served over spagateni (all I had that made sense) and he said this is good, make this again sometime. That is HUGH in our house, he never says that. This is now going to be a monthly dish, don't want to give hubby poultygeist! PS I loved it, but I knew I would just from the ingredients.

I made this dish per the directions. We all felt like it was missing something..also, we felt there was too much of an oil/butter taste. I guess I expected too much from the other people who gave this recipe 5 stars.

I made this recipe again, adding some white wine..we enjoyed it much better and is a quick easy dish to prepare and enjoy.

Terrific recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  Super easy, super fast, delicious.   Served it over a whole box of Barilla whole wheat rotini.  We are going to cut down a bit on the butter the next time to cut out some of the fat.  This recipe is a keeper.  It made exactly four to five nice-sized servings.

I just made this last night and it came out great. I did add white wine and onions to the sauce and it was heavenly. I didn't put so much butter in it though because all that butter is not needed. Will make again for sure.

very good basic recipe for scampi. I added Vermouth to the sauce, and salt, peppered and lemon zest to the chicken. I also added Linguine. also use fresh herbs no parsley flakes, or basil flakes. fresh herbs. plate the pasta (with chicken) on a plate with a parsley garnish (sprig if so desired) and a lemon wedge. great dish!!

This wasn't all that great. It was filled us up that night, but was really nothing too special for my family.

My husband really liked this dish--one of his new favorites.  The reason I only gave 4/5 stars was because it was a bit salty for me. I even added an extra 1/4 cup unsalted butter to tone it down. What I really liked was that it did not require wine.  We don't keep alcohol in our house, so this was perfect!  I am anxious to try it with shrimp!

A nice garlic taste, my husband loved this.  I did use others suggestions to decrease butter and oil by half and add white wine.  Will definitely make this again.

I do not normally eat chicken.  But, because my family likes it and we can't eat red meat every night, I try to put other stuff in our meal rotation. This was by far, fantastic!  I have made it several times already and it is fantastic every single time.  I did double the sauce recipe and served it with egg noddles and a side salad.  Will definately be making this in the future.  Thanks for turning me on to Chicken...

Wow, the Chicken Scampi was GREAT!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was DELICIOUS.  I would not recommend any changes to the recipe.  I’m sure you will not be disappointed.   What’s not to like about butter and garlic?

I loved this recipe!  I used skinless boneless breasts and thighs cut into cubes and it turned out great.  I did cut down a little bit on the butter and olive oil to save a little on fat grams and it was still very tasty.  I recommend to anyone-

My Boyfriend does not comment on any meals that I prepare for him...This one got him to speak.  I added a clove of garlic to the sauce and it turned out GREAT!!!  I have assumed the role of chef and I have to say I LOVED this meal.  It is so simple to complete yet tastes as if I laboured over the production process.  Thanks CYNDEE!!!  Keep those recipies commin.  I'll be keeping an eye out for your recepies!!!

Very good and gets better after a few days in fridge.   I didn't add the whole amount of salt called for in recipe.  Maybe 1/4 t.   I added red pepper, mushrooms & red onion.  Also, a splash of white wine.  Served on spaghetti.  My 4 year old said it was delicious!  Made my day!

Do you like a little chicken with your butter?  This recipe seemed to be crying out for a lower fat version.  One half cup of butter, plus the olive oil is way more than is needed.  I used one tablespoon of butter and one of olive oil and followed the recipe, except I did not add the garlic until after the chicken did its initial browning.  I then added the garlic and a half cup each of chicken stock and dry white wine and simmered the chicken (about 10-15 minutes) until it was cooked through.  (I used fairly large pieces.) To finish it off I thickened the sauce with two tablespoons of cornstarch mixed into a couple more tablespoons of chicken stock.  I served this over couscous (with diced onions and red pepper).  While my version probably does not match the buttery blast of the original recipe it may be easier on the arteries.

This was absolutely delicious! I followed some other reviewers advice and added red, orange and yellow green peppers and steamed broccoli, and also floured the chicken beforehand. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and even my noodle-phobic husband raved about this dish! Definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. Everyone loved it. Make sure you slice the chicken in thin strips so it cooks evenly and doesn't have to cook too long. The second time I made it I added red peppper strips and broccoli florets.Serve with crusty italian bread and be free with the grated cheese.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was disappointed with the results.  The chicken while tender came out extremely bland.  I used a lot of butter and olive oil for a very bland dish.  If I were to make this again I would add a lot more spices and flavorings to help the taste.

I loved this recipe!!! I sauteed some green peppers, extra garlic and tomatoes prior to cooking the butter. I added these ingredients to the chicken I had marinating in white wine sauce. Once everything was done, I dipped some extra sauce out and used it to toss my angel hair pasta.

It is perfect just the way it is.  I made it - it was easy and my friend loved it. The smell of garlic was incredible and waiting was difficult. Gave the recipe to my cell mate who also likes to cook.

A delightful dish.  I followed the recipe using chicken tenders,  I had to discard the first batch of butter and herbs as they burned.  Sauteed next batch at lower temperature. Removed cooked chicken and added sliced mushrooms to remaining sauce. Served with mushrooms on top. YUMMMMMM.  Next time I will make more sauce- it was so good.

Pretty good. Chicken was great. Served over thin spaghetti but the noodles soaked up the sauce too much and the kids didn't think it have enough flavor. next time I'll make more sauce. =)

I thought this dish was excellent.  I added a little more lemon juice, probably 1 1/2 tablespoons, and I did not put in a full 1/4 teaspoon of oregano.  I placed the chicken on whole grain linguine and spooned some of the sauce over top.  It was very yummy!!

Great dish ! I added it to linguine . Instead of lemon, I don't have any, I used orange juice . I did use the suggestion of breading the chicken first , but next time I think I'll cut the chicken smaller and not use the flour on the chicken. The flour just soaked up all the sauce and left nothing for the linguine. Otherwise great dish for a busy week night . My husband cleaned his plate in no time . You will need to double this if your feeding more than 2 , even with the linguine ,not much left over.

Alot like a famous New Orleans shrimp thing. Olive oil, butter, herbs, sea salt/pepper and shallots, lemon juice then a nice dry white. Half lengthwise a GOOD baguette, tear out the middle and serve stuffed with mixture. Look out Muffeltta!!

Very easy and quick to make.  Used pre-cooked chicken and lowered the cooking time.  This was ready, and served over rice in 10 minutes !

This chicken is absolutely delicious! It had a nice mild flavor and went great with whole wheat penne pasta. I would have liked it if the sauce was a little thicker.

Very yummy. I followed the original recipe, the only exceptions being using two tbsp of lemon juice, and about four or five cloves of garlic (I'm a garlic-lover). Topped with parmesan cheese and served with macaroni pasta and toasted bread.

Yuppers!  Follow the other reviewer's in regards to more lemon and white wine you you will be FINE!  I use "tenders" and flour and brown them and cook them in the sauce and it's just like the place we can all go eat ("O-Garden")....add peppers and onions and ya got an exact match.  This is my second time making this and NOT my last....THANK YOU so much for this yummy and super EASY recipe!   Hard to please hubby loves this by the way.

Loved this!!!  It was fantastic and I will definitely make this again.  Very easy to throw together.  I did add green and red bell peppers and onion but kept it the same otherwise.  I will probably add more garlic the next time but I will definitely make this many more times!!

Wonderful recipe!  Very close to Olive Garden's chicken scampi.  I followed other advice and added white wine and more garlic.  My only suggestion is to double the amount of lemon.  It will give it that little something extra.

This is a great recipe.  I have made this quite a few times.  The differences I make are more for our own personal preferences and we like it better than the original, but we do add a green and red bell pepper diced, a can of corn, white wine - about a 1/2 cup and at the end, we toss in some parm cheese.  I think the recipe is an excellent starter one that you can tweak very easily to your own liking.  I also like to add in some red pepper flakes and some additional lemon juice.  I end up heating up the oil and butter together with a diced onion garlic, tossing in the chicken breasts that I diced up, then a few minutes later add in all of the veggies, herbs/spices, lemon juice and white wine.  I let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes while I get the pasta ready.  When the pasta is ready, dump in the chicken mixture, toss in some parm cheese and serve.  I highly recommend this to anyone!

This was a good chicken scampi recipe, but I definitely wouldn't call it the best.  I added white wine to recipe from other reviewers' suggestions and some mixed peppers I had in the freezer.   The sauce was very oily/buttery and needed a little more tweaking for our tastes.  But the flavor of the sauce was great.  We kept dunking our breadsticks in it to sop it up. Can't wait to try it again.

This was the best chicken scampi I've ever made!  I love chicken scampi but have not found a recipe yet that compares to a restaurant; this is it!  I followed the recipe but wanted to use a little white wine and forgot to pick it up.  Although I thought it was FAB like this, a little white wine would definitely be the finishing touch.

AMAZING!!! Tastes like Carrabas! Definitely restaurant quality! I added some white cooking wine. I doubled the sauce and had enough to boil some more noodles and add. By the third noodle add, I had penne, spaghetti AND vermicelli! Next time I'll double the sauce and have enough spaghetti on hand to handle it! I can't say enough about it...AMAZING!

This had a good taste, however i thought it was too greasy. I also added chicken stock with some flour in it to thicken up the sauce. Next time i will make without the butter and with more garlic, but overall very good! I also added green onion, and red and green peppers

We would give this 4.5 stars. I did go ahead and cut back the oil and butter and added 1/2c. of white wine. I also added some spinach leaves right at the end to add some more nutrition! Very yummy

This recipe was fantastic, easy to make, and tasted exactly like scampi should.  I made a couple minor modifications (like the 430ish reviewers before me haha!).  Added about triple the garlic, sliced a red bell pepper and two sm/med shallots and threw those in there with the chicken, doubled the lemon juice, and omitted the extra salt entirely (margarine is plenty salty on it's own). Thanks very much for the recipe!

Flavor was there but it was very visually appealing.  The sauce needs to be creamier.

This recipe was good.  Chicken had a good flavor a little to much oil with the butter.  I added a bit more lemon, extra garlic along with sundried tomatoes and spinich then mixed in linguini.  I would cut the oil and butter in half....and add more after adding the linguini to your preference

My husband and I try not to eat red meat, so we eat chicken constantly.  We were tired of all the recipes that I had been making, so I tried this one.  It was easy and delicious.  I took a reviewer's advice and put it over angel hair pasta with some green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms... my husband asks for this meal every week.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW! This was SO good.  I added green, red, and yellow bell pepper strips to the chicken for more color and it turned out wonderful! This is a keeper!  This is truly as good as something you would order in a restaurant.

Very good!  I added more salt and served it over whole wheat linguini and gave it a good dusting of parmesan.  I'm guessing I added parsley...the label fell off some of my herb and spice containers LOL...it worked out for the best if I didn't...lol

So good! I made the recipe exactly as described and it came out great - especially when paired with crusty garlic bread to dip in the sauce! I forgot to boil water for pasta and because this dish cooks so quickly, I didn't have time to cook it!  So we ate this dish by itself with garlic bread - still really good, but next time will definitely make some linguine to serve the chicken over.

This is a definite keeper. I double up on the lemon juice, add diced bell peppers during the last 5 minutes or so and mix it all together with some cooked penne. Serve it with fresh Italian bread and you have yourself quite a nice meal.

this recipe was pretty good. Easy and quick to make. Although I doubled the lemon juice and added a pinch more on the spices for a bolder flavor. Also will be halfing the oil next time.

This dish was easy and delicious.  To make it healthier, I used Smart Balance and cut the amount in half.  I also only used about 2 TBS of oil.  I used Whole Grain angel hair, red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, red onion, and white wine as others suggested.  I always cook my noodles and toss them with the dish to coat.  Served them with steamed broccoli and whole wheat dinner rolls. Was even better the next day!

Can I give it more than 5 stars?  This was DE-LISH!!!  We served this over angel hair pasta and had steamed broccoli and garlic toast on the side.  The whole family LOVED it!  The only thing we did different was to add more garlic - to keep the vampires away!!! :o)  No, seriously we always add more minced garlic to any dish that calls for it, so maybe for most people what was in the recipe should be just fine.  Want to impress someone with your "culinary skills" but cereal is your best dish?  Surprise them with this!  Very simple and OH SO GOOD!!!

This has to be the most-reviewed recipe I've made yet. I usually read all the previous reviews before posting mine, but this time I'll pass on reading all 427 of them.
I had a mixed experience with this recipe. I made it exactly as written (the olive oil I used was "extra virgin", by the way). When cooking it, I was excited because it sure looked and smelled like a real "shrimp scampi" with chicken instead of shrimp. But when I ate it (for two dinners, on a bed of white rice), it just seemed "okay". The chicken breast halves I used were very large, and therefore the "thirds" were also big. I think smaller chicken strips would have been a lot better. And I would have liked a lot more garlic flavor to the sauce. I'll still give this a 4-star review since my suggested changes are kind of minor.

Delicious!!! The flavor of the chicken is so good I don't think anyone I served it to would believe it was this easy to make. Put it over a bed of linguine with a couple shakes of grated parmesan cheese and it's perfect! Thank you so much!!

My husband made this for dinner a few nights ago, and it is really good.  4 stars because we cut the butter in half or it would have been really greasy...  Also doubled the lemon juice as per other reviews.  Result was a light, tangy sauced chicken that was wonderful over angel hair pasta.  Will make again, keeping the changes the same.

Wonderful recipe!! The whole family really enjoyed this.  The chicken was so flavorful and yummy.  I served it with angel hair pasta.  The only thing I did differently was to cut the butter and oil almost in half and there was still plenty of sauce to coat the noodles.  As other users suggested I also doubled the lemon juice.  Very, very good and quick to make.  Not a lot of dirty dishes makes clean up a snap!!

Next time I'll need to add more flavor to this, it was somewhat bland. I put my chicken in a ziploc with flour before cooking it and it made it tastier than I think it would have been. I added some red pepper and used less butter per other reviews. The pasta soaked up most of the sauce. Next time I will follow the recipe for the butter/olive oil and add more seasonings to give it some flavor. I am not a scampi eater normally, so I can't say how this rates compared to other recipes. It was very easy to make though.

I was looking for a knock off of my favorite chicken scampi dish at a certain popular Italian restaurant and, with a few modifications, this one comes pretty darn close!  I strayed a bit from the recipe by first dredging chicken tenders in flour seasoned, and cooked them in the butter and oil.  I added extra garlic, a sliced onion, red and yellow bell pepper.  I also took the advice of others and added about a half a cup of white wine.  I served it over angel hair pasta and it was fabulous!

This was really good.  I made a few modifications - I cut the butter down to  2 Tbs, added about 1 cup of chicken broth and some flour to thicken the sauce, and mixed in fresh Italian parsley just before serving. I served it over pasta and it was a huge hit.

Very tasty...but I felt like I clogged every artery in my body. I will probably make this again but it will have to be a rare treat. I would like to find a similar sauce that uses less butter. My kids LOVED it and one of them even said, "Mom, you should make this every night."

Restaurant worthy!!  I will be making this again and again!  I doubled the sauce as others had suggested, added 1/4 cup white wine and simmered for about 20 minutes.  The chicken was tender and perfect and the sauce was unbelievable, I also added a lot mre fresh garlic! Thanks for posting!

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!!!! My husband and I loved it!!! I did add more lemon juice, oregano and white wine. There was also enough for left overs for two people!!! Dipping pita in the sauce is heaven!!! I am going to make this for the rest of my life. I cant wait till my twins have teeth so they can enjoy this too!

GOOD!!
I would have given it a 4 or 5 star but my husband said it was ok but was to dry.  I added white cooking wine to add extra juice to it and an extra teaspoon of lemon juice.  Taste was great but like he said a bit to dry.  Although will make it again and maybe next time add addition water to make it more juicy..

Yum, yum, yummy!!! I cut the butter & oil in half, sauteed onions & sweet red bell peppers with chicken tenderloins (plus a little chicken broth + flour to thicken), & it pleased all my picky eaters (the bell peppers were big enough for them to avoid -- yay -- more for me!!) Served it over brown rice.

Absolutely delicious.  I doubled the butter, plus added olive oil as I wanted to put it over pasta.  Used fresh lemon juice.  This recipe is super easy and I will make again and again.  Rave reviews from the family!!

I made this the other night and  was blown away on how good it was.  All 4 of my kids (that includes my husband the biggest kid of all when it comes to food)loved this meal. I doubled the garlic because we all love it and I doubled the sauce.  I added some fresh grated Ramano cheese before I served it.  It was amazing and I will be making it often.

Great Recipe!!!. we added extra butter and put bowtie pasta right in at the end to let it all simmer together. My wife loved it. It was a low difficulty, high qaulity meal. the 1/4 cup of white wine was a nice add to it as well.

Delicious!  I used 3/8 cup margarine and had to cook over LOW heat to keep the garlic from burning.  I also doubled the lemon juice to 2 Tbs.  Leftovers reheat wonderfully too!

This was REALLY good. The only thing I would suggest is to reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. instead of 3/4 tsp. The chicken was a tiny bit salty. You may want to double the sauce, too. Although it was enough for the chicken, I made it with cappellini and it soaked up a lot of it.

Recipe was very quick & easy, plus it turned out pretty good.  I doubled the ingredients but only used about 1-lb of chicken cutlets. I did this so I would have extra sauce to toss with pasta.  I used fresh herbs instead of dry.  And per other reviews, I lightly dregded the chicken in flour, added extra garlic, and threw in some yellow & orange peppers.

This was just ok for me.  I added some parmesan to give it more taste.  I didn't have it over pasta though, so maybe if I tried that I would like it more.  I just thought it was pretty bland.

This was really good!  I halved the recipe to make just 2 chicken breasts, but I did end up adding a couple tablespoons of butter as the chicken cooked.  I may have overcooked the chicken a little but the buttery, garlicky sauce was perfect with angel hair and some parmesan cheese.  It was a nice dish to have in the summertime since it isn't too heavy.  I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!! We loved this! I cooked this in my electric frying pan. I followed the recipe exactly, except I dredged the chicken in flour before frying, and I'm glad I did. It really helps the yummy sauce stick to the chicken. I used thin-sliced chicken, and did not cut it up. I served this with 'alfredo sauce' from this site, and fettuccine noodles with breadsticks, and it was delicious! Thanks so much for sharing.

Very good chicken scampi recipe.  I took the advice of others and made the following changes:  coated the chicken with flour, added an extra clove of garlic, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1/2 white wine, small sliced tomato.  This was better the second time when I added a small sliced onion.  Enjoy!

5 stars all the way. My husband loved it and has already requested it again. I did change it up some. Use same about of butter half the oil and doubled all of the spices. After cooked I mixed some cooked angle hair pasta into the pan with the chicken. Easy weeknight meal but would also be great for company. Thanks for an awsome new recipe.

This dish got me rave comments.I made it for eight and was told it tasted like the one from Olive Garden. I added some fresh garlic and more butter for a creamy sauce then served it over angel hair pasta. So easy and so good I will be making it more often

We really liked this one!  I doubled the scampi sauce and added 1 cup of white wine & a little crushed red pepper for some heat.  Served over pasta with "Bread Machine Focaccia" recipe from this site. Great quick meal that will be repeated often!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good recipe. I doubled the sauce. It was a tiny bit too salty so I will cut back a little and add it after if needed. I used Smart Balance also. Will definitely make again.

This was good, but not great.  I tried three new recipes this week and this one was the third favorite.  Followed the recipe as written and it seemed bland.  Probably won't make again.

Nothing special, I doubled the sauce as suggested by other people which was very necessary. I think it would have been better if the chicken was marinated or with shrimp. all in all probably won't make again.

This was really good.. although I felt super guilty eating it! I followed the recipe as is, but I doubled the garlic and the lemon. I also addeded shrimp, ground black pepper, crushed red pepper,and fresh Parmesan. After cooking, I transfered everything to a baking dish and added some mozz. cheese and baked it... delicious!

I thought this was a great recipe. This is what I always order at Olive Garden.  I added red, yellow, and green pepper and onion.  I would almost double the sauce recipe because when I tossed with pasta it was slightly dry.  Everyone has their own tastes when it comes to how much sauce you like.  Great recipe : )

Didn't measure anything with this recipe.  Added in white wine, used Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle (instead of individual spices).  Barilla Plus Angel Hair noodles.  I actually didn't try any of this, but the family didn't speak much during dinner, and we didn't have to fight with the kiddo's to get them to eat it!

This recipe was really tasty! I added the white wine to chicken as was previously suggested, and it turned out great! The chicken was really moist and flavorful.

My huband is great...but he's hard to please when it comes to food. But I'm happy to say that he loved this recipe.  I didn't measure anything, I just estimated how much I needed (best way to make your dish a success).  At the very end, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese and a splash of lemon juice.

This is soooo good. It is so quick, easy, and very very satisfying. I made it twice in one day (lunch, then dinner) because I loved it that much. I made this with spaghetti noodles the first time and fettuccine the second. Better with the fettuccine because it downplayed all that oil/butter better (thicker noodles). Will definitely make again (and again!)

Amazing! To cut down on price, use vegetable oil, which will sacrifice a little flavor. To bring that lost flavor back, I added a couple sprigs of rosemary, and I waited to add the garlic until 2 minutes before i put in the chicken, then i topped the simmering chicken with some fresh lemon juice and added a bit of lemon zest to the chicken. Turned out perfect!

This was very good! Instead of making it into strips, I cubed the chicken and served it over angel hair pasta. I think next time I will increase the dry ingredients and lemon juice just to give it more zest. Overall it was very good and so easy!

This was ok. It was kind of on the bland side. I wonder if you  let the chicken soak in the butter/oil/spice mixture overnight if that would help. I might try again that way.

I was hoping for more flavor, but overall it was ok. I cut the amount of butter and oil in half as suggested by other members, and I am very glad I did. There was also no sauce at the end, it was just left over butter and oil. Next time I'm going to add the white wine as others suggested too, maybe that will help some.

Well I have made this time and time again now. I follow the recipe to a T and it turns out wonderful! The garlic tastes wonderful after it's cooked with everything! I just add a tad more lemon juice now, but that's it. VERY DELICIOUS!

I thought it was great.  To make a sauce, I drained a can of diced tomatoes (drained) with basil, oregano and garlic and added it to the mixture. Then I added flour to the to part I drained off the tomatoes to thicken the sauce.  I didn't have pasta so I served it over brown rice.  I will definately make it again.  I will also lessen the oil and butter.

This recipe was very good.  Loved it.. Did a couple things different.  Added 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of white wine, 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary, also increased the spices by abt 50%.  After cooking meat tell white I covered and reduced to low for 10 minutes.  used pre-cut boneless skinless tenders. Came out incredible tender.  Served with angel hair which i added chicken boullion to the water while cooking.  Mixed the noodles with the sauce and then added chicken to the top with fresh parmesean.  Was delicious.  Thanks for this recipe.

Have made this twice now, two different ways.  The first time, I made according to the directions with a few changes (half the butter, extra garlic, and white wine).  My boyfriend loved it, and said I could make it again.  The second time I didn't use the stove.  My grandmother poached the chicken in the oven, and I made the sauce in the microwave.  Only change I made was to add extra garlic.  Put everything but the lemon juice in the microwave for a couple of minutes, stirring every 30 seconds or so.  The family enjoyed it, and asked me to make it again.  Easy recipe that is easily modified.

This was great!  I cooked it is directed but with a little less than the amount of oil.  I cooked the spaghetti noodles drained them and then I tossed the noodles in the pan with the chicken without removing anything.  All of the sauce from the pan and the flavor was mixed into noodles.  I was told by my husband, who is a big critic on his own standards, to make it again!

I loved this recipe.  My husband loved this dish over rice and peas, and since i'm a low carb dieter, I ate it right off the plate, with a side of peas.  Very tasty; will definately make again!

Great. Used bacon grease to cook the chicken which I cut into smaller pieces. Also added onions and pepper slices (green red and yellow) along with white wine.  Used half the butter. Tastes even better the next day.

This was good. I added a bit more garlic and some white wine. Unfortunately I over cooked the chicken a tad. Served with thin spaghetti. Forgot that scampis are always better the second day...lucky I have leftovers for tomorrow. Will probably make again.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  Itwas fast and easy.  It was WAY too oily, though, almost to the point where I felt sick after eating it. It had a good flavor and I may consider making it again with some modifications.

This was ok, I guess my disappointment came from expecting Olive Garden style taste.  It needed more of a sauce to it I thought.

Seemed like it was missing something. Maybe a little more lemon? Also, a bit too buttery for my tastes. We all ate it, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I was looking for a chicken recipe to make for myself for lunch and came across this one.  I used frozen chicken tenders and for the noodles I used the noodles from a package of ramen noodles.  The whole dish turned out delicious.  Will definitely be keeping this recipe to make for the family.

I was expecting a lot more flavor. I doubled the recipe, so I thought 6 garlic cloves would be enough...It wasn't.  This was super easy to make, so perhaps I will add some mexican (it has a stronger flavor)garlic powder next time.

Delicious and super easy!  I added a little cracked black pepper, but made everything else as directed.  Family raved over this, including picky kids!  I made this with white rice, but will make fettuccini or linguini next time, as I think pasta will be a better pairing.

Sooo easy!! Great flavor too. Good base recipe. Definitely need to reduce the butter by 1/2. Add as many spices as you want. I like to add an onion and bell pepper, with rosemary on mine! Good with any side dish.

This was fantastic. I doubled the sauce and used 1lb of spaghetti. I am a red sauce person and really was nervous to try this recipe but It definately was well worth it. I will have to order this in a restaurant and compare it to mine. I had enough sauce to dip my italian bread I had in it also. 
Thanks for the recipe

This was good.  I sauteed red & green peppers as well as mushrooms, set them aside and then mixed them in with the chicken before serving.  I doubled the garlic.  My only complaint is that when mixed with the pasta (and I didn't use that much), the dish lost a lot of flavor.  We doused it with parm, which is always a savior.  However, next time I will use more butter and possibly marinate the chicken in the herbs and garlic before cooking it.  Overall, it's a good recipe.  I'm a huge fan of it at the O.Garden, and this is close.

OMG....this was the best Chicken Scampi that I've ever had...I followed the advice of some other viewers and tossed the mixture with low-carb spaghetti noodles and chopped marinated artichoke hearts.  The marinated artichoke hearts really made this dish.  I put them on top after I sprinkled some freshly grated parmesan cheese over the mixture...yum yum yum.  My fiance' loved it and requests me to make it weekly.

I added more garlic and lemon juice.  My son who is a shrimp scampi lover said this was good. I used a french baguette to sop up the juices and it was a great meal.

I made this recipe tonight and it was fantastic.  My husband, who is not a big garlic fan, even loved it.  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves and added about 1/4 c. of white wine.  Great dish and so easy to prepare.

Wow!  This recipe is fantastic...and so easy to make.  I have made this several times and everyone loves it.  I use 7 or 8 chicken tenders (saves cutting time) and I serve it over angel hair pasta mixed with the sauce (just add the sauce slowly, or you may end up with too much sauce and super greasy pasta).

I make this all the time - it's so easy to throw together, and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I like to add extra garlic for a little more kick.

It was an excellent recipe, but the chicken was a little dry.  I think maybe I overcooked it?

Five stars because it's so easy and elegant.  Good enough for company.  I did add the extra lemon juice and next time I might add some white wine for a little more flavor.  Served over angel hair, it's perfect!

I put less butter, more oil, added half can of diced tomatoes and chopped kalamata olives. Served over brown rice.  Oh, doubled the garlic. When 2 toddlers and a hunny gobble it up, that's a good dinner.

I made this for dinner last night served over spaghettini for my DH and I and I cut the recipe in half...except for the garlic (I used 2 large cloves) and the lemon juice (I used 1 Tbsp).  Both DH and I thought it was good, but was lacking something.  I will attempt this dish again because it's very quick to prepare using ingredients that we always have on hand; however, I will change some things.  I will cut down on the amount of butter and oil used because we both found it to be very rich and a little to greasy for our taste.  I will also add a splash of dry white wine as suggested by other reviewers as I believe this will help cut through that richness.

This was delicious...totally awesome.  Very easy to make, had all the ingredients on hand and well my toddler loved it.  Hubby just couldn't get over the fact that it was CHICKEN and not shrimp.  What a way to put a twist on chicken.  Thanks.  Served it over pasta and we had some string beans with it.  Yummy.  Next time I make it... it'll be over brown rice.

This recipe was so good.  I added onions and yellow/red peppers to the chicken while it cooked and served it over angel hair pasta.  I will definitely be making this over and over again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous! Served it over brown basmati rice as I cannot have pastas and had a side of steamed greens and carrots. Will cook it again for sure!

This was great! I didn't make any changes, only ADDED cooked pasta during the last minute or two of cooking to mix with the chicken and soak up some of the sauce. Made a great ckn/pasta dish!

I was making twice as much chicken so I doubled everything except the butter and olive oil. I added 1 cup total of chicken broth and followed directions pretty much to a T. I added a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken sauce which we ate over rice. For lunch I ate leftovers over fettucine. This was not only delicious but FAST and easy. My kind of recipe!!

This is my new favorite dish. This was like eating in a reasturant. I can't believe how easy it was to make. I had dinner on the table in 20 min. I was skeptical to make for my 7 year old daughter, she hates anything with the color of green in it. Once she tried it she loved it. She even had 2 helpings. I recommend this to anyone who is new to cooking. It is really simple to make.

This was very easy to make.  I love mushrooms and wanted to add a topping on the chicken so I sauteed sliced mushrooms in the pan after removing the chicken and scooped it over the chicken and pasta.  This is a great recipe that can easily be cut in half if you're just cooking for two.  I especially love that it is very quick to make.

Absolutely delicious recipe...doesn't taste too heavy and VERY quick to make. I used two large chicken breasts, cut in fourths, and it worked out just right for the amount of sauce.

Outstanding! One of the best entrees I have ever prepared.  Restaurant quality taste.  I didn't change a thing.  The bonus was that it was incredibly easy to make.  I will add this recipe to my favorites list and share it with my family and friends.

This unfortunetley wasn't a winner in the household, the chicken was very bland and tough.  however it deserves three or more stars for the scampi sauce it was very good we poored it over top angel hair pasta and tasted like it was from a restaurant.

This was an excellent dinner. My garlic got a little browned, but it gave it a great toasted garlic flavor.  The only ingredient that I didn't use was the lemon juice.  I topped my spaghetti with the chicken and sauce and added shredded parm., romano, and asigo cheese to the top!  EXCELLENT DINNER, WOULD DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN!!

Delicious!  I've made this a couple times and it is sooo fast and easy!  The chicken gets so flavorful when cooked in the butter sauce.  I may even try the sauce with shrimp sometime! :)

I made this exactly according to the directions and served it over vermicelli and it was FANTASTIC!!  It was simple and quick, and I felt like I was eating a restaurant meal!  It has become my favorite meal, and one the rest of my family adores as well!  Does GREAT for leftovers too!

This was an okay recipe.  I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I would turn the temperature down a little.  By the time I got everything added, all of the seasonings were burnt, along with the butter...maybe my stove is hotter than others???   Like others, I thought this was very oily/greasy.  Either way, it tasted decent.

Very tasty.  I added about 1/4 cup of spinach and some fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I also added a little more lemon juice and some black pepper and topped with parmasan cheese.  It was so good

This recipe is wonderful! I used a low-fat butter spread to help cut down on the fat and it was still very good. I played around with the sauce by doing what some of the others had done. I added a little chicken both, white wine, and exta lemon juice. I also really enjoy spicy foods so I added in some red pepper to give it a little bite. I served it over penne pasta. I will be using this recipe again and again! Thanks.

Quick and easy dinner - I followed recipe exactly only adding a "little" white wine (don't think I would do it the next time).  Served it with Lipton's Butter Pasta and a tomato and onion salad.

Very good and a snap to make.  I made it with the fettucine alfredo from this site and it was a big hit with the family.  I added some sliced bell peppers and onions for added flavor and color.

The 3 stars I'm giving this recipe is a compromise.  My family thought it should be a four and I rated it a two.  It needed more salt and was just too greasy for my taste.  If the family wants it again they will have to make it because I won't.

I am impressed by how easy, yet how delicious this dish is!  I used smoked, grilled chicken strips that can be found in the freezer section of your grocery store-- it was even better!!  It gave it a more gourmet taste!  and took even quicker to prepare!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I made it with spaghetti and I didn't slice the chicken.  It was quick and easy.  The chicken was also very juicy.  My husband and I loved it.  Although, if you don't slice the chicken you have to cook it longer in the pan.

All in all this recipe was bland.  I followed the recipe to a tee and I must admit, shrimp scampi is much better.  I will not be making this again.

I scaled the recipe to serve 2.  However, I did use 3 cloves of garlic because we like it so much.  I also added the juice of 3/4 lemon.  It was very rich, and I think next time I will cut the butter and oil in half and add chicken stock during the 15 minutes of simmering.  My husband really liked it.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and french cut string beans.  Tasty!!

I thought this recipe was great on its own, but I decided to add sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms for extra flavor and texture.  I also topped the dish with shredded parmesan cheese which is a nice addition to any pasta dish.  My husband loved it.

This was very good! I used chicken tenderloins and didn't add the lemon since my daughter doesn't like it. I mixed it with wide egg noodles, I didn't feel it was enough sauce to use spaghetti or other size pasta, and it came out delish. I think I would cut back on the salt a bit next time. It was a little too salty for me. but still enjoyed it very much! Thanks Cyndee!

Wow!!!!!  This is a make again and again dinner!!!!  Scampi sounds so complicated, but this was soooooo easy!!!!  The flavors blended together very well.  One of the most delicious meals I've cooked in a very long time!  I'd give it even more stars if I could!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is make sure all my ingredients are prepared before melting the butter.  It got a little smokey in my kitchen, but that was my own fault, not the fault of this recipe!

Wonderful flavors, but I ended up changing the recipe a bit and omiting the oil and cutting back on the butter.

Fantastic! So much flavor and not the same old garlic chicken I always fry up. Everybody in my family loved it. For sure worth a try, because the flavor is great, even if it is different than what you are expecting. I'll add this to my regular routine.

Myself, and my 2yr and 3yr old LOVED this dish.  We served the sauce over angel hair pasta. My 3yr old liked it so much that when we had speghetti a couple of days later...her favorite dish...she refused it as she thought it would be the Scampii.  My husband didn't care for it, but he has an attitude problem trying out new recipes.  It was great.  Thanks.

Great flavor!  Even my picky brother loved it!  Next time I'd probably use slightly less oil, but I thought it had wonderful flavor.  Just like shrimp scampi.  Very yummy and very very easy!

I liked this because it was easy and the ingredients were the type that are always available. I felt like something was missing though. And the 10-15 minute cook time seems correct. I added an extra twist of lemon to the sauce at the end. I can only imagine eating this with pasta. Some derelict left a feedback review of this recipie saying they used crisco in place of butter and served it with mashed potatos! HA HA HA they must be a funny wierd person

this turned out to be kind of bland. not sure what I did wrong. maybe next time I will use fresh herbs instead of dried ones. And it was way too oily for me. I would cut down on the oil and margarine.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe.  I love shrimp scampi and I love chicken and I am always making up new dishes so was disappointed in myself for not having thought of this one. :)  I added green onions to this but that is the only thing I did differently.  Very good served with flavored rices.

Excellent recipe!  I was getting really tired of marinating my chicken breasts in italian dressing and this was a similar, yet different way to make chicken.  Added rosemary to the pan about a minute before I added the chicken and it was delish!  Fiance loved it and I will be making it again with shrimp.  Thanks!

Delicious and oh-so-easy! The only variations I made were: 1.) added two tablespoons of extra margarine and 2.) after the chicken was cooked, tossed it all into an oven-safe dish and broiled it for a few moments to brown the chicken. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I thought the chicken might come out tough, but it didn't.  It was very good, even though I had to use crisco oil instead of olive oil.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Yummy!

This chicken was really good. The only thing I might change is a higher proportion of garlic to lemon juice. I actually had extra butter left over when I was done. I also found the cooking time to be a bit long. Overall, though, a tasty and quick recipe!

I would more butter then what the recipe calls for...I used only 3 chicken breasts and still had to add more butter.  However it was quick and easy and tasted great.  We don't have kids, but it seemed like the type of dish that would go over will with kids.

Really delicious and simple to fix. But
the recipe did not tell you to add the salt with the herbs, nor did it mention 
to add lemon juice to the pan juices after you cook the chicken --also I found the 10-15 min cooking time too long.  5 min. is more like it--after all, you already cooked it until white!!

Great recipe!  Very tasty, and for a lower sodium diet, you can easily just decrease or leave out the salt altogether.  We eat this often.

This recipe is exactly what I always ask for when dining out.  Add Fresh Mushrooms and fresh ground pepper for a rich flavor.
