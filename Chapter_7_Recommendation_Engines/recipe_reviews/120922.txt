Really good with a few changes.  I used a ratio of 1 cup leftover mashed potatoes: 1 egg and used fresh chives from my garden since they were ready to be snipped.  Added the garlic but skipped the Italian seasoning.  I stirred in 1 heaping Tblsp flour to add texture.  The pancakes kept their shape well and were easy to flip.

I made seventy of these last night for an upcoming party. I started from scratch, so I needed to add flour to the mix in order to hold them together better. I also added, minced bell pepper, grated onion and lots of parm cheese. I made them relatively small and plump and rolled them in a mixture of flour and parm before frying. They were easy to flip and the flour/cheese mixture gave them a beautiful crispy crust. Thanks Schuster!

I made this with left over mashed potatoes. Needed to add more milk as they had dried out. Also added more spices than just a teaspoon. I also used a lot more oil than suggested. I found that if you wait the full 8 minutes and then flip them you can have them crispy on both sides.Flipping before the full 8 minutes made them fall apart. Also I formed the patty in my hand as I could get them thinner than flattening them in the pan.Using the spatula to flatten them only made them fall apart. Trick is to let them cook till the bottom is really crispy then flip them. Very yummy when eaten with sour cream.Thank you Mary for helping me find a way to use up the left over Mashed Potatoes!

Yum. These turned out well.  I added about 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the seasonings listed and they were delish. A great use of leftovers.

My mother used to make these in the fifties and I have been trying for years to find out how to make them!  I did find them a little mushy to work with and will try adding some bisquick next time.  I used a good teflon skillet and not too much oil and let them cook at least eight minutes before turning them. They were just the way I remembered them as a kid!  Thanks for helping me relive my childhood!

Growing up, I remember my friends' moms making these.  My mom never did and I was always curious about them. At Hubs' request, we were about to eat leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes for supper tonight for the umpteenth time and I absolutely refused...so he got these as a surprise with his breakfast this morning!  I remember my friends' moms adding egg, but I also remember them adding a little flour and finely chopped onion, so that's what I did. (Let me tell you, these memories go back a LOT of years, so that tells you these mashed potato patties have been around a looooong time) I have to admit the idea of Italian seasoning in these wasn't moving me, so I added some Penzey's Buttermilk Ranch Seasoning instead (I'll bet Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch Seasoning would be excellent too) These are mashed potatoes after all, and as such are obviously mushy, so I made certain not to turn the patties too soon.  Hubs had never heard of these before but loved 'em.  I thought they were pretty darned good too, 'tho I found they require a lot of seasoning.  They were indeed crispy on the outside, and mashed potato-y on the inside.  It was an excellent way to make use of the last of the Thanksgiving mashed potates and were a perfect complement to our scrambled egg Sunday morning breakfast.

Pretty good recipe! I actually added some baking mix to thicken it up a little though and also added onion powder and basil instead of Italian seasoning and family ate it up!

I thought these were pretty good. Its nice to do something with leftover mashed potatos...they usually get thrown out at my house. But I would change a few things next time 1) I would make the potato cakes really thin, I made them too thick and they didnt get as crisp as I wanted, and 2) maybe I would add some green onion for flavor and color. Other than that they were pretty good =)

Prepared recipe as is and it was fine but nothing special.  I supposed if I doctored it up as previous posters have I might have liked it better but then I would not really be rating THIS particular recipe.

these turned out nice with the addition of 1 tablespoon of flour.  made them with garlic mashed potatoes.  be sure to cook them for eight minutes each side so they don't fall apart.  for fun, I added shredded cabbage (from bagged coleslaw mix) and some minced green onion to the second batch, they turned out very yummy.  my english husband said, 'you just made bubble-and-squeak'!  thanks for the recipe.

Not the outstanding flavor of the potato cakes I order at the local diner, but easy enough so I might make again.  Loved the crispy edges!  I added parsley and chives.

It was an easy and good recipe. I replaced Dill for the Italian seasoning and it was really tasty. It didn't get as crispy as I was expecting and burnt a bit....maybe use a bit more oil for a shorter period of time at a higher temp?

These reminded me of the ones my Grandma used to make.  I used 1 cup leftover loaded mashed potatoes (bacon, cheese, and sour cream) with a tbls of whole wheat flour, 1 egg, and onion powder. I used margarine instead of flour. They turned out great! My four year old, who can be picky, loved them.

This is a great way to use up those leftover mashed potatoes. It is a great basic recipe because you can add your favorite ingredients to suit your own tastes. I added some chopped onions, salt and pepper; and 1 Tbsp flour as suggested by another reviewer. I left out the Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I have also added some cheddar cheese to them and they are very good. I will be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made 'em exactly as written. Good and simple base recipe for leftovers.  Now I'll make them my own by adding some different seasoning, green onions, some cheese, perhaps?

I have made these for years. I raised 7 kids on them and they all loved them. We used more "smashed" potatoes than mashed. I prefer to have bits of potatoes in them. I have always added flour to these to help keep them together. Add a tablespoon at a time. Just until they have a "sticky" texture.  I drop by tablespoon into the pan and they seems to "flatten" out by themselves. The trick really is to cook them until the one side is really browned, 8 to 10 minutes before turning. Otherwise they will fall apart. You can add all sorts of ingredients to these. Garlic, bacon bits, onion and cheese are our favorites. Sage is good in these too. We have these for breakfast as well as lunch or dinner. These take a little time to make, but are oh so worth it!

Delicious. The flavor was great I had made garlic potatoes and had some left over and used them which was amazing. Tip though, rub some cooking oil on the back of an egg spatula to flatten; any other spatula or an unoiled spatula and you're going to have a mess.

I made this for my children for chanukah. They told me right before dinner time they really wanted latkes/potato pancakes - and I was not ready to bring out my food processor and start grating potatoes. I happened to see this recipe last week and kept it in mind. I would describe this as "the lazy latka recipe." It worked out pretty well for me! I modifies the recipe a bit though... I did not have left over mashed potatoes - I used 2 cups of instant potato flakes, 2-3 tbsp of flour (as other reviewers had suggested), 2 extra large eggs and a bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder. I made the potatoes to be a bit thicker than pancake batter consistency. The end result was a nice fluffy latka/potato pancake (light colored too! The potato flakes don't oxidize like real grated potatoes!)A good substitute if you don't want a big mess and appliance pieces to clean up!

I have made potato cakes before and had them be way too soft.  A lot has to do with the condition of your mashed potatoes when you begin.  If your potatoes are on the wetter side, then as others have suggested here, its a good idea to add some Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I used 2 cups of mashed - I had made sour cream and chive mashed potatoes.  They had sat in the fridge overnight so they were not super moist, but moister than I wanted if I were to add the egg for binding.  I added 1/4 cup bread crumbs along with some of the garlic powder and skipped the Italian seasoning since it was in the crumbs. Next time I might add some extra though as it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I made these into potato bites/small plate/appy sized.  I used a small cookie scoop and dropped the ball onto a plate coated with Italian bread crumbs.  I coated the ball with crumbs and flattened the cake out some.  Served with a small dollop of sour cream, some crispy bacon and fresh chopped chives.  YUMMY!

These are very good. I did add a little salt and a little onion powder for oersonal taste. I was a little iffy on using Italian seasoning, but I am glad I did! What a nice flavor! I cooked mine 8 minutes on each side, and they turned out perfectly.

Excellent recipe!  As others, I added my own variation of ingredients - bacon bits, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions and a tablespoon of flour to help hold them together.  Definitely the "trick" is to cook them covered on medium heat for 8 minutes on each side.  At first I thought this was too long and tried to flip the first batch after four minutes.  Big mistake as they fell apart.  When I did the second batch as the recipe directed at 8 minutes - they were perfect.  I'll definitely be making these using my leftover mashed potatoes!!

This is a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes. I used garlic in place of garlic powder and added in some chopped chives. Lastly I seasoned the mashed potatoes with a little hawaiian salt and black pepper, to taste. I used 1T of butter instead of oil to cook the potatoe pancakes. I shaped the pancakes a little more thick, not flat. I fried them up close to 8 minutes. When the bottoms were crispy and brown, I gently flipped them over to cook the other side for another 8 minutes. They were indeed crispy on the outside and soft on the insides. These complemented our, "Extreme Veggie Scrambled Eggs," also from this website.

Very good recipe.  I used fresh chives and left out the dried seasonings.  We will definately make this again and try different herbs.

I really liked this recipe as it was a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  It is also very easy to double (or triple!).  The only change I made was adding a quarter cup of flour and an egg for each cup of mashed potatoes.  I then fried them in a frying pan with oil and left them until the bottoms were brown and flipped them carefully.  Once they were cooked on both sides they held together well and tasted even better the next day reheated for lunch!

These didn't work well for me. I should have added flour, but I don't like to change a recipe until I've tried it as written. Next time...

These were pretty good!  I've been looking for a good mashed potato pancake for a few years now. I added parm cheese to the potatoes, and a little bit of flour, and also rolled them in a mix of parm cheese and flour before frying them. They fried up nicely, and weren't too sticky after I added the flour.   All that I would add is a little bit of salt...even though I generously salt my mashed potatoes, I would add a little bit of salt to the 'dough' next time. But they were great!

This recipe has a really good flavor. However it did not turn into a pancake at all. It was more like mashed potatos with a few crispys in it.

These were easy to put together and harder to cook.  I turned down the heat to 3.5.  The potatoes soak up all the oil so mine stuck a little on the other side.  I added in cheddar cheese, red onion and 2 slices of Bacon.  Topped with sour cream.

I thought these were very tasty, yet they fell apart when I rotated them!    Maybe I need to try a little more flour, but otherwise, YUM!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. I skipped the italian seasoning as i had none, but this was to be our whole meal so I added green onions, parmesan cheese, and fried bacon chunks. I should have added some flour as others commented since they were a bit mushy, but instead I fried them for longer than 8 minutes, until I could safely flip them. Also would have helped to have less on my pan. Turned out great and will definitely make this again!

Not sure why..but this completely flopped when I made it. I figured out that u need a very hot skillet to get the pancake to develop a crust...most of mine just crumbled into a big mess...it was like trying to sculpt with pudding..not a success at all..would welcome tips on how to help this recipe turn out right...

It was ok. I had to add a little milk to my potatoes. Also minced some sauteed onion and pepper. I wished I did not leave out the Italian seasoning. Only because other reviewers did. In the end, it lacked something. I will try it again. Perhaps only add 1/2 tea. of Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese to kick up the flavor a notch to the hum-drum potato cakes.

These were just ok.  Not much flavor (even after I added seasonings).  Probably won't make again.

Took the advice of other readers and added a bit of flour.  I also used fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Great way to use up left over mashed potatoes.

I folowed another reviewers advice and used 1 C mashed potatoes to 1 egg and added 1 heaping T flour. I added garlic powder, shredded cheddar cheese and grated onion. I found med high heat to hot...pancakes were burning.......med to low worked better. Also had a hard time flattening with the spatula...just made a mess. Dropping in a clump and spreading it out with a fork worked better. Hubby liked them...I thought they were ok. next time I will season them a bit more. This is however, a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes, so I will keep this recipe. anything my picky hubby likes is a keeper...haha!

I made these last night and added bacon, onions, and cheddar cheese to the mix and garnished with sour cream and chives...They were FANTASTIC! They were all eaten up and my kids were BEGGING me to make more. This will be a frequent dish at our dinner table ;)

This is a great recipe for utilising leftover mashed potatoes! I made some modifications to dial up on flavour. I added more herbs and chili powder. When I added the egg, the mixture became very wet and difficult to handle so I added a tablespoon of cornstarch and did 2 experiments. 1) Coated the mixture with breadcrumbs before frying them while 2) I mixed the breadcrumbs in before frying them. Option 2 turned out wonderful. I pan fried them for 9-10 minutes and it was so crispy and flavourful. On my stove top, at 8 minutes, it still wasn't crispy enough. Thanks for this recipe.

I modified quite a bit. I always use sour cream, butter, and cream cheese in my mashed potatos (I had to make from scratch since I didn't have any leftovers) I did not add the italian seasoning just salt and pepper and some cayenne pepper. I did add some flour. I scooped them out of the bowl with a cookie scoop and dipped my spatula in the oil to flatten out. Flipped mine without having any issues with them breaking apart and I did not wait 8 mins. I served with a sour cream and chive dip. Very yummy stuff and the kids loved them ;)

Great use for leftover mashed potatoes. My husband ate these and he does not care for mashed potatoes. He said "you can make these again" so, it is a keeper for us. I followed the ingredients and instructions with no changes made. Thanks for the new side dish recipe!

really liked this recipe- very much like the kind my mother used to make- my mix was a very thin so I added about 1 T flour to dry out. Had to 2 hand flip so they wouldn't break, but once flipped, they held up nicely.Great crispy, crunchy outside to them.  My father and I just ate 1/2 the batch, and kids will be home from school to finish the rest. Thank you so much for the recipe, I have been trying different one's and this was the best by far. ( first kid's response was to finish up the rest of that batch)  Off to the kitchen to make more for the other children.

Add a teaspoon of flour to the mix to help hold the cakes together.  We add diced onions, green bell peppers along with crumbled bacon (cooked already of course).  We just use salt/pepper/garlic to season it- the bacon adds flavor as well.  You can add a little shredded cheddar cheese to the mix as well.

My family has made these with breakfast since I was wee kiddo.

Good use of leftover mashed potatoes.  I fried mine in bacon fat in a cast iron skillet.  Also I rolled them into balls then dipped in bisquick before putting them into the pan and flattening them.  Cooking them on medium high for 7 minutes burnt them on my electric stove though.  Medium heat worked for me.  I think I like potato pancakes with shredded potatoes more, but it's nice to have a use for leftovers!

These were delicious! I used 2 cups cold mashed potatoes and 2 eggs, plus 2 TBS flour per previous reviews. Italian seasoning didn't seem to fit with fried mashed potatoes? So I added finely minced garlic and green onion, crumbled cooked bacon, a handful of shredded cheese, salt, pepper and cayenne. My pancakes were essentially fully-loaded baked potatoes fried in a pan. Not something we will eat very often! I cooked mine in the leftover bacon grease. I turned the stove up to medium high to get the oil nice and hot and dropped them in by the spoonful and using the greased spatula I quickly shaped them in the pan and pressed down lightly to flatten to 1/2 - 3/4 inch thick. Then, turn the heat down to medium and leave them alone for eight minute. Gently flip and cook eight more minutes. I had no trouble keeping them together once they formed a nice crust. My husband inhaled them, the only problem is I didn't have more mashed potatoes!

I made this tonight with some very minor tweaks and they were delicious. I wouldn't do 8 minutes however. It was only about 3-4 minutes per side for me at low-medium heat in a cast iron skillet with olive oil.

My mom used to make these with left over mashed potatoes when I was young, and I loved them!  Then my 2 little brothers came along and we never really had leftover potatoes again.  I make these now for my husband and I.  Really takes me back!

These are sooooo yummy! I changed it a little bit, & I think the recipe as is would be a little bland, but I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper, and a little parm cheese. Faaaaaantastic!! I'm making them right now & so far the second they hit the serving plate they're gone LOL!

This is a very good recipe, however if you want to try something different add the following: Sauteed onions (mix into potato mixture) fry as usual. Or.. crumbled cooked bacon about 1/2 cup and 1/2 cheese grated and green onions chopped. Mix this into potato mixture, additional milk may be needed to keep the patties together. When finished cooking, add a dollop of sourcream to the top and dig in.

I consider myself a pretty competant cook, but I couldn't get these to resemble anything close to crispy. The flavor was good, though, so I may keep the recipe to tweak & experiment with.

These were only okay.  I think they needed more flavor.  I even added some cheddar cheese but think it was needing more.  They fell apart too easily.  I added 2 eggs.  Maybe I needed 3?  Not sure if I will try them again.

Great use of leftover mashed potatoes. Add one egg to leftover potatoes and then fry in pan on high heat for five minutes per side.

My Nana only used flour and milk with the left over mashed potatoes. only problem is my mom won't give me exactly how much to use. its just a little of each till its the right consistency.  it apparently took her years to get them just right.Nana was the cook not my mom but she can still make them and mine fall apart. also I always eat them with ketchup. yum poor mans hash browns.

Eh, this was just ok.  I don't know why you'd go to all of the effort when it didn't make it taste any better.  My potatoes already had the garlic and Parmesan cheese in them.  It just wasn't worth it to me.

I ate them relatively plain growing up--a little minced onions.  We would have breakfast for dinner and have with bacon, eggs and biscuits.

Great basic recipe! I've used this recipe as a starting point on many occasions to use up leftover mashed potatoes. It's become one of my favorite breakfasts! Sometimes I add a bit of cheese or fresh chopped onion. I also add a sprinkling of flour so that it holds together better.

Loved these...I did add a little bit of flour to make them more pancake-ish.  I also added carmelized onions and various italian spicees to a couple of the pancakes and they were awesome.  I will definitely make these again

This reminds me of an old New Orleans Friday meal, usually referred to as "codfish cakes". Before Vatican II (early '60s), Catholics were required to fast from meat on Fridays. We still follow this abstention on Lenten Fridays. I never really understood why it was considered a sacrifice to eat seafood instead of meat, especially in New Orleans, but, go figure. I also never understood why these were called codfish cakes, as codfish is one of the only fish other than salmon not native to our area. Like jambalya, these were usually made with leftovers. Usually they were made by combining sauteed onion, garlic and bell pepper with leftover (or canned) seafood, sliced scallions, and mashed potatoes, cayenne, and other spices with egg as a binder. They were then formed into patties and sauteed in butter (cakes) or formed into balls, dredged in flour, egg wash and bread crumbs, and deep fried (codfish balls). Not the fanciest dish in the world but much better than frozen fish sticks or other convenience foods. Please forgive me for the average rating. I don't think it's fair to hold the rest of the country to the taste standards of New Orleans. Even the codfish version above would be considered standard convenience fare. I hope this didn't sound snobby,we're just very picky and competitive re our cooking.

I grew up  eating these..we called them potato cakes..so so good. We did not use the seasoning but used 2 TBSP flour to hold them together. Also you can add some finely chopped onion or shredded cheese...

Great post-Thanksgiving way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  I followed the advice of gapch1026 and added scallions and flour as well as chopped garlic.  Came out great and was easy as well.

I too adapted the recipe with 2 eggs, 1/2 cup flour and shredded parmesan.  I let it rest in the fridge for some time it was still very sticky so I rolled the scoops of potato in the parmesan, then patted them down before placing them in the oil.  I ran out of cheese before I ran out of potato, so for the rest I scooped the potato with a cookie dough scoop and plooped them straight into the oil.  As they cooked a bit, I lightly pressed pressed them into a thicker patty....The family LOVED them!

I made this recipe and instead of italian seasoning added dill, horseradish and parmesan.  It was much easier to form the patties by hand, I found that the spatula made a big mess of them.  I had to cook them about 8-10 minutes each side before flipping.  They were awesome.

Great recipe!  I substituted cajun seasoning for Italian and added some shredded cheese.  Don't add too much flour if you're tempted to make them bind together better - mine turned a bit gluey.

I wasn't sure what to expect with these, after reading the mixed reviews. I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did follow several other reviewers advice on how to cook them. I mixed these up and then let sit in the fridge for an hour, I used a tablespoon to put the mixture in the pan and then flattened with the back of a fork. Finally I made very sure to let them cook for 8 minutes each side as many reviewers suggest. I had no trouble turning them and they came out perfectly. My daughter and husband enjoyed these as is but we're all agreed if I make these again, we'll jazz them up with some chives and cheese. Thanks for the recipe Mary.

These were pretty tasty, but I found the cooking instructions (medium-high for 8 minutes per side) to be way too much.  I ended up turning the stove down to 5 out of 10, and cooking maybe 6 minutes per side, and they were still much darker than what's in the picture.  Other than that, I made it according to the recipe as best I could.  We didn't have Italian seasoning, so I added some salt, pepper, basil and oregano, plus some fresh minced onion.  The taste was good but I'll definitely cook at a lower temperature next time.

This is exactly the same as a recipe my family has been enjoying for years! This is the base recipe only- it is great for adding little extras too, depending on what your family likes. I like cheddar cheese and sauteed shredded onion in mine with a pinch of garlic powder. My grandpa used to like his with shredded cheese and crumbled bacon. We've also done it "loaded baked potato" style... great base recipe to personalize to your liking. Thanks for sharing!

These were were very good although my children didn't like them at all (Just being picky I guess). I prepared as is but added minced onion & 1 Tbsp of flour. The only problem I had with them was that they were sticking to the pan even with a little flour mixed in & olive oil in the pan.

I really liked this recipe, simple way to use up leftover mashed potatoes. Although I made individual patties by "plopping" a spoonful at a time into the pan. They turned out crispy, crunchy on the outside, tender and tasty on the  inside!!! YUM

I'm rating this 5 stars since my picky bf loved them. I just used salt, pepper, parsley and onion powder for the spices. (he 's picky about spices as well) I had to add some flour to hold these babies together, but they were good and a nice change from using leftover mashed potatoes for a casserole. I made them into smaller thinner patties to get crispier. They taste like a creamy lakte. My bf liked them better then regular laktes and these are easier.  They taste good cold too.

I cooked these a little too long and they burned, but the part that didn't burn tasted good. I will definitely make these again, but just keep a closer eye on them.

Did not use Italian seasoning but added a little chopped onion, salt and pepper.  These are really good, but must watch closely to avoid burning.  Will be making again.

Excellent, my whole family liked it.  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and used the 1 c./1 egg ratio.  I added 1/4 cup minced onion and 1 tsp Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic.  Also I used a blender to combine everything.  I served them with cinnamon applesauce and they were a big hit.  NOTE:  I have a small griddle and so could only fry four at a time, so the actual cook time was a little longer for me for the whole batch.

I used two-day-old mashed red potatoes that had the skins left in, one egg, a heaping tablespoon of flour, green onions from the garden & some salt & pepper. It turned out to make five pancakes but I could only cook three on the first go around because my skillet wasn't large enough for all of them. The first three turned out great & we couldn't eat them fast enough. The last two burnt badly with those time constraints. I'm not sure if something happened to the oil or if it was because I left my boyfriend to watch them. I can't wait to make mashed potatoes again just so I can have these the next day.

I gave this only 3 stars because I modified this recipe so much, however the final result was VERY tasty, I added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, some fresh chives instead of the oregeno and I added a few tbsp. flour which it definitely needed to hold it together. And as another reviewer stated do not flip until a full 8 minutes have passed for browning the first side otherwise they will break apart. My husband and son both loved these! A great way to use up leftover potatoes.

As written, these did not work for me. The potato mixture was way too thin and did not stay together. The taste was OK but I think they were pretty bland. I did try to add some flour and some cheddar cheese but we still weren't crazy about them. My mom use to make potato cakes that I loved but these did not compare.

This was really good.  I did add a little bit of flour to the recipe so the potatoes were easier to form into patties.  I would next time add a small amout of onion for added flavor.

Not bad for something to use up mashed potatoes, but I wasn't extremely thrilled with it.  Even with the seasonings I thought they were kind of bland.  But it did use up the remainder of our mashed potatoes, so that's good!  Bf says his grandmother makes these without seasonings and he used to eat them with ketchup. Thanks for the recipe.

so far so good.
Didn't have any eggs left, so i added a little extra cream to make the mashed potatos more sticky.
Added bread crumbs and a garlic herb blend and formed flattened balls of potato, then dipped in bread crumbs and fried. 
SO far they smell really good.
