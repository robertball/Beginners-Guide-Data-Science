This is AMAZING! I thought it would be good, but I was surprised with just how good it was... And how easy to make! I used a 'banana cream' pudding mix, 1Â½ large bananas, and I baked it in a 9x13 metal pan. It only took between 35 and 40 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on it or it might end up kind of dry. My cake was wonderfully moist. I followed the glaze recipe but added 4 oz of softened (left on the counter for a couple hours) cream cheese. I needed a little more milk to make it spreadable, but it was awesome. Sprinkled some walnuts on top, and let it set for a couple hours. I DID leave it in the pan, but it's easy to lift out slices if you grease and flour the bottom of the pan. We had company over and she loved it! Thank you so much, Barbara!

This is the recipe I was looking for, not for banana cake but for zucchini cake!  Use a package of lemon or vanilla pudding and add 2 cups of shredded zucchini, 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon, and a dash of vanilla if you wish.  I also used applesauce instead of the oil and used 4 egg whites and 2 eggs instead of four whole eggs to cut down on fat.  Very moist, and very delicious!

Very ordinary, nothing special. No disguising it's a doctored up cake mix.  I made this many years ago when it first appeared in a magazine advertisement. Not bad if you're just looking for something that'll pass.  Making your own delicious banana cake doesn't require a whole lot more effort and reaps a far superior reward.

The cake was awesome. But the topping I wanted a little something like banana pudding so I made some changes. For the topping I used 8 oz. of softened cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar, a small tub of cool whip, and a about 20-30 crushed vanilla wafers. First whip the cream cheese with electric mixer add in confectioners sugar until well blended. Add in cool whip with a spoon. Spread on cake sprinkle crushed wafers all over cake and VOILA.

This recipe is awesome... I have made it 3 times in the past two weeks.  My family likes it better made in a 9x13, with cream cheese icing and refrigerated.  Perfect to take to office, church, anywhere.

This was an outstanding cake, and very easy to make.  I served it at card club, and it was a big hit.  Everyone asked to take a piece home with them.  The cake was gone before the night was over.  I will definitely make this one again.

Made this when I had overripe bananas and wanted something other than a banana bread recipe. While it may be a "doctored-up" cake mix recipe, it is a great way to make a dessert when you don't have a lot of time. Just took a few minutes to throw the ingredients together and mix.  At the suggestion of others, I did add vanilla and used 3 bananas. I left off the glaze, and it was still good. Got many compliments when I took this to work. Will make again.

Took this to a potluck and it was a huge hit! I followed advice of reviewers - doubled the banana, added a little vanilla, subbed applesauce for the oil, and used a cream cheese glaze. Oh yeah, I used vanilla pudding because that is what I had. Delicious!

Can I give this cake 10 stars!  It is fabulous!  I made it last night and brought it into work and everyone is raving about it!!!  I did do a couple of things differently only because I did not have exactly what was called for in the recipe.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake (betty crocker) that already had pudding in the mix, however, I still added another box of pudding (all I had was banana cream instant pudding).  Then I iced it with Best White Icing Ever (also on this site).  I also altered that recipe by using 1 stick margarine and 1/2 crisco shortening in instead of one cup of just shortening.  Gee can ya tell I like to fiddle around with recipes???  Any way, this will be one recipe that will be made again and again.  I can't say enough wonderful adjectives about it!!!  LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!!

There is nothing more annoying than when you see all the good ratings and you think you have a real winner, only to make it, and find out it tastes like a boxed cake mix, soooooooooooooo irritating to say the least.
When I bake something I want it to taste homemade,not like I ran down to the grocery store before dinner and picked it up!

I was looking for a recipe so I could try out my new bundt cake pan and I thought this one looked good.  It is excellent.  My husband, my coworkers, and I all loved it.  I did not alter the recipe in any way - it is perfect as is.  Another thing to note is that this makes a very pretty cake.  After drizzling with the icing and topping off with the nuts I put this bundt cake on my cake stand and it looked great.

I made this cake twice and replaced the banana pudding mix with vanilla pudding. It gives the cake more of a "baked from scratch" taste. Also, I subsituted the water for milk, added a capful of vanilla extract and folded in 6 oz. of mini chocolate chips to the batter just before pouring into the pan. The mini size chips don't sink!  Of all the "cake mix" cakes I've baked this was everyone's favorite! MMMMMMMMMM

This is a moist and delicious cake! A nice change of pace from banana bread b/c it isn't as dense. I used 3 bananas and added 1 c. semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Also, I used a tub of whipped cream cheese frosting instead of making it (fast and easy!). I baked this in a 13x9 pan to make it even easier. I highly recommend this recipe for potlucks and parties b/c you can make it the day before. Yum! This will be on my new list of favorites for easy and tasty!

If you want something different than the same old chocolate or white cake, this is the cake to try.  It was really good.  I also used cream cheese in the icing and it came out great.

This was a wonderful recipe. Everyone who has tried it has loved it. It's very moist. I have made it twice now and the second time I made it I added 4 oz of softened cream cheese to the glaze. It was delicious. Both ways are great. You are gonna love this cake. I now have 2 bundt cake recipes that are winners! The other is the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake on this site.

This cake was amazing!! It was so easy to make and the ingredients were so simple. The only change I made to the recipe was I used a .9 ounce package of banana cream pudding and then a 2.1 ounce package of chocolate pudding because that's all that I could find at the time in my pantry. It turned it into what tastes like a chocolate covered banana in cake form and my family has been raving about it non-stop! I can't wait to try this recipe in it's original form and I hope you try adding a little chocolate to your cake too :)

If you want to know what this tastes like without having to bake anything, jump in your car and head down to IHOP.  Order a tall stack of banana pancakes with glaze.  It will have the same preservative taste--processed, sickly sweet, fake flavor as this recipe. Next time I'll make banana bread or muffins with my leftover bananas.

Really moist & rich!   I made this for a friends birthday.  I baked it in two square pans, put sliced bananas between the layers & iced the whole thing with cream cheese icing (the birthday girl's favorite).  SO good!!  Will definitely make again!

I needed a quick dessert for a last minute dinner. This was a hit. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds.  The entire 9x13 cake was gone. I used 1 cup of banana instead of 3/4.  I also added 1 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 cup of spiced rum.  This cake was so light and fluffy and soooo delicious.  A nice change from the denser muffins and breads I usually make with bananas. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar due to lack of time, next time I might try it with a cream cheese frosting sprinkled with chopped nuts.
Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

My friends go nuts for this cake.  I even had one to say this is his new favorite dessert.  
I add the walnuts to the top, then ice.  Also, I ice it while it is still a little warm.  Absolutely wonderful!

Unfortunately I did change this too!  I used butter pecan cake mix, vanilla pudding and 4 very ripe bananas.  I also cooked this as cupcakes and that was a mistake as they sunk in the middlem and I thought they were under cooked but cooked another tray a little longer and the same thing happened!  I tasted them and they still tasted good so I decide to ice them with butter cream frosting.  Because of the hole in the middle you get a lot of icing, but that's ok as I like icing!  Good flavour but next time I will make in bundt pan and try again!

I just baked the cake! It is very moist and has a very good banana flavor, very good. I couldnt find the regular banana pudding mix and I used the sugar free one. It worked perfect. I also sprinckled cinnamon on the greased bundt pan instead of flour. Delicious!

This recipe was some good banana cake recipe.  It is very moist and beats banana bread.  It did need some more bananas in my opinion.  Also maybe add some banana or peanut butter/chocolate  icing for more complex flavor instead of just vanilla. Overall pretty good.

Love this recipe!  I add about 1/3 cup fat-free sour cream and it turns out beautifully--very dense and moist.  I usually just dust with confectioner's sugar instead of using the glaze.  A family favorite!

I used egg substitute and applesauce instead of oil.  I found that one cup of the confectioners' sugar was plenty.  It was delicious!

Glad I made this cake before sharing it with others. I used a yellow cake mix with pudding already added. By adding the banana cream pudding also, I think it made the cake too heavy. It fell considerably after removing it from the oven. I cooked it the full time suggested, and then about 10 min. more, but will try a mix without pudding next time, and maybe it will not be so heavy, and mushy at the bottom. Has a wonderful flavor though. Worth trying again!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband.  I did not make the glaze, becuase I thought it was great w/out it...and I saved the calories!  The only other changes were...I could not find banana pudding so I used vanilla and I used 4 bananas which I am guessing is more than what is called for, but it turned out great!!! I can't believe moist this cake is.

This is outstanding! I made mine as a bundt cake and frosted it with can cream cheese frosting. Next time I'll try the glaze over it; just pressed for time today. The cake is so moist and having the real bananas in it as well as the banana pudding mix really enhances the flavor. YUM!!!!

This recipe turned out great!  I used a yellow cake mix with "double pudding in the mix", which made it so moist.  Also, in the glaze I added just a dash of almond extract.  This is best served warm!

This is pretty good, although I can see why some people think it tastes more like banana bread.  I kind of think that too, except it was sweeter, and the glaze adds a nice touch to it.  The yellow cake mix I bought had "double pudding in the mix," which made the cake so moist.  I made about 1 1/2 times the amount of glaze the recipe called for, and poked holes in the cake so that some of the glaze could seep through.  I refrigerated it and served it nice and cold.  It was really good!

My family really liked this recipe and we didn't think it tasted store bought.  I added about 3/4 c. mini chocolate chips and as other reviewers suggested I added some banana extract to the cake and glaze.  This cake was very moist and the addition of chocolate was a nice touch.

It was yummy...I was afraid I had made way too much, but my fiance and I finished it by the next day. I only wished I added a little more banana to give it more of a home-made taste rather than that store-bought cake mix taste.

I made this over the weekend for a family gathering.  I used banana cream instant jello and unfortunately, only one person at the gathering enjoyed this cake.  I can't say that I liked either. I won't make again.

This is indeed a great cake.  After trying the recipe as is, I then made another cake with butterscotch instant pudding and substituted 3/4 c of shredded zucchini for the 3/4 c mashed banana.  It too was wonderful and tasty.

This does keep well. I made 2 days ahead when I had time and it was great when I served it. I am anxious to try the other suggestions with chocolate chips. Hint: I storage over-ripe bananas (peeled and mashed) in my freeze so I don't have to wait for them to ripen.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I baked this cake in both the bundt pan and the 9x13 pan and both times it baked beautifully, tested done, and the timing worked out perfectly.  Then when I took it out and it started to cool, it fell.  When I cut into the cake, there was a doughy layer at the top.  Is it supposed to be this way?????

This is pretty close to my mom's recipe. It's the most amazing, moist cake. My siblings and I ask our mom to make it every year for our birthdays. Plus, everyone I've ever made it for loves it! 

This last time I didn't have any ripe bananas [and all the ones at the store were still green] so I used banana baby food, and it still tasted great!

This cake was super moist!  Followed some other reviews and added a cream cream icing.  I also used the  glaze but I poked small holes in the cake and drizzled the icing into the holes and over the cake then I topped with the cream cheese icing...Made this for Thanksgiving....no leftovers!!  LOL Thanks Barbara!!

Really a great cake if you like banana pudding! I used 2 medium sized bananas (which was more than 3/4 cup but I was trying to use them up), baked in a 9X13, and used the CoolWhip/vanilla pudding/milk/vanilla frosting in place of the frosting in the recipe. Crushed up some vanilla wafers and sprinkled them on top and it was pretty. Even better  tasting the next day!

So moist and delicious! Followed recipe exactly.Baked in a 9x13 cake pan and used 1/2 of the frosting recipe called for and found it to be plenty. Will make again.

I've made this twice in the last three days.  It's delicious!  I didn't have instant banana pudding, so I used vanilla.  I also used a different icing, here it is:        8 ounces cream cheese      4 tablespoons butter      2 1/2 cups icing sugar      2 teaspoons vanilla      1. Soften cheese and butter.    2. Beat well.    3. Add sugar and vanilla.    4. Beat again.    5. Spread on cooled cake.

Very, very disappointed. I was so looking forward to making this cake. Because of many good reviews, I was certain that it would be a hit. Well, was it not only just a cake that tasted like banana bread. The glaze (per recipe) was so sickeningly sweet, I had to brush my teeth just to get the taste out of my mouth. I followed this recipe to a "T", so I know I made no mistakes to the original. I don't know, maybe if I had used cream cheese frosting, as some other people did, I may have been happy with it. But as it stands right now, I will not waste my time again.

This is a very moist cake and has good flavor.  I am not sure if it is called a pudding cake because pudding is part of the recipe or if it is because the cake actually has a pudding like consistency.  I think it is a great doctored cake recipe but would probably choose a different recipe if I was trying to impress.  Having said that... it is my most requested cake by the church youth group. :^)

This is an excellent recipe! Ive made this cake many times and it always disappears fast.
 I like to frost it with a light cream cheese icing and garnish with chopped Pecans or Walnuts. Delicious!!

This is a really moist, delicious cake, but very sweet.  My kids loved it, my husband and I agreed that next time, I would omit the icing, add the walnuts to the mix, and just sprinkle the top with powdered sugar when cooled.  Either way, it's quite good.  Thanks for sharing!

Very simple and tasty. I used french vanilla instead of banana pudding which is what I use in actual banana pudding. The result was a very moist bundt that my husband raved about; comparing it to banana bread. He even asked his parents to come over just to try it. I would make this again in a heart-beat.

My husband made this for me on my birthday. He used a pineapple cake instead of a yellow cake and added more milk to the powdered sugar. He allowed the cake to cool for 10 minutes, took a skewer and poked holes in the top of the cake and poured the glaze over the top then sprinkled finely chopped walnuts over the top. It was so beautiful and tasted great. Will cook this on a regular basis.

this one was a hit in my friends circle.  I changed it up a bit, added more bananas (probably 1.5 cup), and decided it needed cinnamon (approx 1T). I also stirred walnuts INTO the mix and baked it in a decorative bundt.  instead of frosting or icing, I just dusted confectioners sugar - it was beautiful and WONDERFUL!!

I agree with another reviewer that the finished product taste way too much like boxed cake mix with a little bananas mixed in.  Good if you're in a pinch and it is very moist.  I went easy on the frosting and the overall presentation was pretty - great for a potluck since this stays fresh for a good 2 days - make sure it's covered well.  Second time I used White cake mix for less of a 'cake mix flavor' , and used 1 full cup mashed bananas for more flavor and tasted WAY MORE homemade.  Great short-cut cake if you're pressed for time.

I have made this recipe 4 times already - I always have left over ripe bannanas and look for good ways to use them besides the old stand-by banana bread.  I do not like the glaze however and use a cream cheese frosting.  Be careful not to overcook - I only leave it in for 45 minutes.

This is my favorite banana cake recipe! It's sooooo good, so moist and just delicious! My fiance is a picky eater, and he loved this cake, always asks me to make it for dessert. And my coworkers loved it as well....they all asked for the recipe. The cake is good enough to alone without the glaze.....Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

A good cake!  I have to agree with another reviewer who described it as having a "banana bread quality".  I consider it more of a breakfast cake than the usual banana cake you find for dessert.  I will make it again!

Very good cake; easy to make and moist.  Instead of yellow cake mix, I used a package of butter recipe cake mix and it turned out perfect.  I made it for a birthday get-together, and everybody loved it.

this cake is wonderful!!! Everyone loves it, though I did do one thing differently. I used pecans, and I just mixed them in the batter.

After reading mixed reviews, I decided to try this recipe.  By using a boxed cake mix, I didn't really expect it to taste totally homemade.  We really enjoyed this cake.  I always find us "stuck" with an extra, aging banana or two.  This was a nice alternative to the same ol' banana bread or muffins.  Moist and not sickeningly sweet.  I did add an extra cup of banana - love that banana flavor so I figured it couldn't hurt!!  Good to eat morn, noon, or night.

Delicious and so light and fluffy.  A major hit after the first bite. There is ALWAYS a banana left over from a bunch and this is the perfect solution for it.

Im 17 years old and living in canada. I made this cake and it turned out gorgeously. Fluffy and moist, my whole family loved it. I made a nice glaze to go with it. This recipe will stay at the top of my list.

Tried this cake for my sister's birthday. It was a HUGE hit! Instead of the glaze, I thinned cream cheese icing with a little milk and drizzled over the cake. Very light cake with a luscious banana flavor,and super easy to make.Had two requests for the recipe. Will certainly make again!

This cake was delicious.  I couldn't find instant banana pudding, so I used vanilla and it worked great.  I baked it in an oblong pan and sprinkled the walnuts on the cake batter before baking.  I made only half of the glaze and still threw some away.  Now I know what to do with over-ripe bananas!

yum, yum!  This was so easy to make.  I made it for my family and my fiance.  They all loved it...and it made me look like an experienced baker.  I melted cream cheese frosting and drizzled over top, then served with fresh banana slices with a dab of frosting.  So yummy!

A very quick, easy and delicious cake that only gets more moist each day.  The first time I usually try a recipe as stated and then adjust to my taste.  But this time I also added 1/4 cup light brown sugar to the batter.  The reasoning was based on another "doctored" banana cake that I make.  The author said that adding a little sugar to a cake mix makes it more tender.

For being a doctored up box cake, this is amazingly good. I have made it twice in the past week already. I took it to a family dinner where it received rave reviews. I topped it with cream cheese glaze and added walnuts. Those were the only changes I made. I also made it to take to my eye doctor. I added pecans, 3 bananas, and vanilla this time. I also left it unfrosted and just dusted it with powdered sugar. Soooo good. My eye doctor told me he wouldn't be able to fit in his bathing suit. He loved it. I will be making this often. It is so simple and good!

When I made this recipe I ended up using a 16.5 oz cake mix instead of the 18 oz. This was probably for the better.  The recipe worked well but I was a little unsure if there would be enough banana.  While baking, in the last few minutes of it I was unsure if it was done since parts of it seemed moist. Instead it was done but just moist.  The icing was probably much easier than I made it since I kept adding vanilla to my mixture until it tasted good all I had to do was mix it and drizzle it over the cake ignoring the taste of the icing.   Overall,  the cake is delicious and many family members loved it. I just wish I could have sprinkled some crushed vanilla wafers over it.

I made in a 9 x 13 pan and topped with cream cheese icing instead of the drizzle.  The cake was a quick dessert, but, just average.

I gave this a five because I changed it a little.  I used a banana cake mix and added diced banana (in addition to the mashed banana) and walnuts to the cake mix.  I think it would not have much of a banana taste with the yellow cake mix.  It was moist and had  a moderate banana taste.  I baked in a 9x13 pan. You do not want to overcook!!.

I liked the simplicity of this dessert but I did a few things different.  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of oil, I used vanilla pudding instead of banana, I had a lot of bananas to use so I used 5 almost a full bunch, and I omitted the icing listed and used the pudding/coolwhip topping.    The cake all by itself was just ok for me, it was very moist from the pudding and all the bananas. my husband asked if it was cooked enough, and yes it was hence a pudding cake. But what really made this cake for me was the pudding/coolwhip icing. I would definitely make it again because I was able to use alot of bananas and it was really tasty with the pudding icing. Thanks!

This was a moist cake, as expected with a cake mix plus pudding mix.  The only change I made was to increase the mashed bananas to 1 c and add mini chocolate chips.  I did not frost it. However, the flavour tastes artificial, like a grocery store banana cream pie flavour, not like real banana.  I wonder if it would taste better with a vanilla pudding mix so the mashed banana could stand out? It was easy, but I would not make it again.

This recipe is delicious! I have made it several times. It's great as it's written, but it's fun to change up a bit too. I've added orange juice in place of water and applesauce in place of the oil to make it lighter. I've made it with different glazes as well. I've done a chocolate glaze that tasted delicious with the banana. I've also just sprinkled plain powdered sugar on top in a pinch. Great recipe!

I got this recipe last Thursday and decided to surprise my family for Labor day! Boy, were they deliciously surprised.  They really enjoyed the flavor which all said it tasted very much like banana pudding. It was really easy to make.  For the frosting, I simply opted to dust the cake with powdered sugar lightly.  I make/sell cakes and from our gathering, I have four orders already.

This cake was a breeze to make and tasted good.  It was very moist (almost too moist).  I think I may use a little less pudding and bananas next time but other than that it had a great banana taste.

Family loved it. Moist and not too dense, great flavor. Nice change from using my black bananas in regular banana bread.

This is a great recipe for a potluck.  No one will ever know just how easy it is to make and it always comes out moist and delicious.  I have changed the glaze up a few times just to make it different...sometimes I use melted chocolate to lightly drizzle the finished, cooled cake.

I am giving this recipe five stars only because of the changes I made. I would only give it four stars as written.  I added a cup of semisweet chocolate chips to the batter then I frosted it with half a tub of prepared chocolate frosting. I scooped the frosting into a glass measuring cup & melted it in the microwave then drizzled it on the cake. It was delicious. I made it for a party I had & everyone loved the chocolate & banana combination & wanted the recipe.

Made this for my husbands Poker Night, Everyone had great things to say about it.  I Did use Devils Food Cake instead of Yellow cake, cause i just love chocolate and Banana together.  I also poked holes in the cake before drizzling the icing on.  This was a great Dessert that I will definately make again.  Nothing Personal about the four stars, I just Rarely give Five stars for anything.  Great Recipe!

This recipe is amazing.  I made a "test" cake for my daughter's birthday and we ate the whole thing in one night.  I used a cream cheese icing with it.  For a 12x18 slab cake I used 3 x this recipe.  All the guests loved it, and so did my daughter.

When my internet was down, I had forgotten the measurements and confused it with the Chocolate Brownie cake. I used 1/2 cup of bananas, 1/2 cups of oil and water, and 8oz of sour cream. Surprizingly enough, everyone loved it as it was super moist. Both ways have gotten rave reviews with family and friends and is often a sure way to use up those left over bananas getting dark on the shelf

I've made this cake twice!!  It's my husband's new favorite!!  I followed the directions exactly, but I made extra frosting.  This is a great cake to take to a party -- it seems like a cake that would take alot of work, but it's so easy!!

Delicious!  This cake was devoured by 10 critics (my family) and they all gave it 5 stars!  I really didn't do anything different except, I used a different glaze recipe.  The best thing about this cake was that it didn't take long at all to put together.  (Only 15 minutes) Then, into the oven it went!  This easy and delicious recipe will definetly be made again!

I think this cake deserves five stars, but    
 the glaze only gets three.  I'll  be making again, but I'll probably use a   
cream cheese glaze.

I used lemon cake mix with pudding for the cake plus the banana pudding, and used lemon extract instead of vanilla for the glaze. I've made this four times, bakeing just a bit longer then called for and never been disappointed

This was delicious and moist.  I recommend using three tablespoons of milk to make the glaze instead of two, as it was too thick to drizzle or spread over the cake otherwise.

This cake has turned into our family favorite!  It's quick, easy and the results are so yummy that it's requested at least once a week!  I bake mine in a 9x13 disposable aluminum pan.  When it's done baking, I let it cool only 15 minutes and then glaze it with the icing.  When I pour the icing over, I pull the sides of the cake away from the pan so the icing drips down into the sides.  Makes it so moist that we fight over the end pieces!

I used this recipe to try out a silicone bundt pan form and it came out perfect!  Not too sweet or heavy.  I didn't even frost it, just garnished with fresh strawberry slices.

Normally I'm a pretty sensible eater, but this cake is absolutely addictive! Made a 13 x 9. Watch the cooking time--I stuck it in for 35 min and that was just right. I used vanilla pudding mix and added two bananas. Might add another banana in the future, just for extra texture. Also sprinkled toasted coconut on top instead of the glaze. Makes the perfect snacking cake.

Cake tastes great but fell during cooling.  I used a 9"x13" pan.  Next time I will add the walnuts to the cake and forget the glaze.  Just dust with powdered sugar.

I made this today for my husband and our youngest son,  a 6'2" muscle-bound beanpole veteran of the war in Iraq, who can't get enough to eat since coming home. This recipe received two thumbs up from both guys, and yep, from me as well. I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than the one posted of crumbling vanilla wafers over the top. Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely great!  Quick and easy, substitutions are easy to do to make it your own.  My brother always asks me to make one for his birthday, rather than a bakery-bought cake!  I substitute apple sauce for the oil and add more mashed bananas to give it more flavor.

followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out about what I expected.  I did frost the cake as the recipe said and I'm glad I did.  It would have been a little dry without it.  Looked pretty when is was done.  Always wanting to try something new so I'm not sure if I will make it again.  Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Excellent.  Very moist.  It disappeared very quickly.  Next time, I'll try it with walnuts.

This was the BEST banana cake recipie ever!!I can't imagine what all the earlier neg comments were about..but this recipie is foolproof! I also used double pudding cake mix WITH the extra pack of banana cream instant pudding mix, 3 large bananas and used a bundt pan. This cake is  INCREDIBLY MOIST and YUMMY!! VERY filling..Great cake, I will definetely keep this one!! Very banana flavor is you use the instant banana cream pudding mix..you just can't go wrong!

Did nobody else have trouble with the icing?  My icing ended up in little balls, and I followed the directions exactly.  But the cake was a hit with no icing.  Will make agian because was easy.

I made this cake over the weekend and my youngest daughter devoured it. The cake did fall a bit after taking it out of the oven, but it had a rich banana flavor and was very moist. Next time I think I will frost it with vanilla or cream cheese frosting, rather than the glaze, then it will be more like the cake my mother made when I was a girl.

Very moist & delicious cake. Only thing I did different was the icing.  I microwaved regular vanilla frosting and "poured" zig zag over the cake.  I thought that this would make the presentation nicer.  Great cake for a brunch or picnic.  Though I must admit that it was very similar to a banana bread.

This tasted as good as my banana bread. Very similar. Next time i'll add some butterscotch/caramel chips to give it its own taste.  I made it in a bundt pan, turned out nicely, easy to make.  A creative way  to use up bananas, i'm always looking for something new to keep our lunches lively (:

My husband loved this cake, as did his coworkers.  I'm not a banana cake person, however, the cake was very moist.  I put chopped walnuts in the cake and used very little of the glaze and swirled a bit of melted chocolate chips on top for decoration.  Very pretty.

This cake really does travel well. It's easy to make. I find the icing makes it too sweet so I skip that part completely. I also add more nuts to give it more crunch, the kids like that.

I made this cake for a family reunion and it was a hit. My sister in law owns a restaurant and is known to be the "best cook in the family". She asked for this recipe which I considered a big compliment.  Very easy, very moist and flavorful.

This cake is the best!! It was so easy to make.  I added chopped pecans in the batter instead of walnuts and I drizzled some chocolate glaze I had made out of chocolate chips, syrup, and butter.  The cake is the moistest, and I am positive I will make this again!

Absolutely the BEST banana cake I have ever had...and it is so easy.  I make mine in a 9x13 pan and frost with ready to spread chocolate frosting.  One question, does anyone have any tips to keep a cake from shrinking once you take it out of the oven.  It rises so nice and high while cooking, but once done and out to cool, it goes somewhat flat and shrinks at the sides.  Still tastes SUPREME!!!

I was surprised at how good and moist the cake turned out. The recipe is so simple and the entire family loved it. I used 1c mashed banana and added a few walnuts to the mix. I used the powdered sugar glaze and it was perfect! yummy!

Excellent recipe!  This cake is very moist and flavorful.  Since it's made with
cake and pudding mix, it's very quick and easy, too.  The icing is a little too
thick when it's prepared according to the recipe, so I add a little more milk.

I have been making this cake recipe for several months now.  I got the recipe from "Quick Cooking" magazine.  The only difference being my recipe called for 3/4 cup of walnuts and didn't come with a glaze.  I also use this recipe for Banana Bread - it is so moist and good.  :)

This is fantastic!
Very moist. It was gone in less than 2 days.  Will have to try it with the chocolate chips.

This is a very good cake. Sometimes, I skip the icing and just throw some chocolate chips on top. My family loves this cake.

This cake was so easy and moist Iâve made it twice in one week. The only variation was one of the reviews I read that said they threw in a little more banana which I did too because I had some that were very ripe.

This is easy to make, a good way to use up tired, dark bananas .  Does remind me a lot of banana bread in a tube shape, but my guests really seemed to like it.

Iâm giving this 5 stars because of how delicious it tastes for something so easy to make!  Followed directions completely.  Very moist, sweet but not too sweet, and it was eaten so quickly I barely had time to grab a slice for myself.  It was a hit by all.  Thanks for posting.

I made this delightfully moist cake for my family and friends. It is so good I had a friend say they would pay me to make it for them. I added the chopped walnuts to the top, which is a great addition to this cake. Also, it is extremely simple to make. I would like to post a picture to show how good it looks.

I pretty much made this cake as directed with a couple of changes. They were out of banana pudding at the store, so I used vanilla. Also I used 2 whole bananas, I wanted to be sure the banana was a strong enough flavor since I had to use vanilla pudding. I made it in a 9x13 pan and iced it with cream cheese frosting. It was a hit!! Everyone loved it.  It was easy and quick to make. I canât wait until i need another cake!

Iâve made this many times over the years.  I use 3 very ripe bananas.  This time itâs a 1 layer 9 x 13 and will have chocolate frosting because thatâs what my 34 year old son asked me to bake for his birthday.  Family favorite for sure.

This is a really good banana cake recipe, but it always sticks to my pan.  If you want "pretty" this is probably not the best choice, but "tasty" is better than "pretty" when it comes to food, I think.

Yes, it's still just a doctored-up cake mix - but as that, it's pretty darn good. Great way to use up ripe bananas, so I'll likely make it again. Next time I'll add some chocolate chips to the batter & leave off the frosting- still will be plenty sweet. Thanks!

Not a fan of this cake.from other reviews I have read, it seems this is personal preference as people loved it didn't care for it. I made it as in, it smelled heavenly while cooking. The directions said to bake 50-55 minutes, I set my timer to check it at 45 and it was overdone, which did not help my enjoyment. I made everything else as is. I personally will not make this cake again.

This was an okay cake.  I added one Tbs of milk for the frosting because it was too thick.  Otherwise I followed everything else.  But, my kids LOVED it!!!

I tried this recipe for Christmas and my family loved it!  There were several desserts to choice from: lemon pound cake, peach cobbler, pecan candy.  But this cake was the winner for the evening.  The only substitutions I made was to toast pecans and sprinkle over the top and I used banana cream pie filling and baked it in a bundt pan.  It was the preferred dessert for the holidays!  I will definitely make this again.

I finally tried this recipe and it is very good! I put 4 good sized mashed bananas in it and it is more banana flavored than banana bread to me. I put it in a dark non-stick bunt pan and it took about 80 min at 350. I covered the top with aluminum foil at about 50 min.

Awesome! Tasted just like banana bread, but more moist. I added 1 bag of ski-sweet chocolate chipits, and 2 ounces of banana liquer. Delicious

One of the best cakes I have ever made!  I added some banana extract for extra flavor.  The glaze was too runny so I made more of a cream cheese icing instead, then dotted the top with walnuts.  Super moist, can't wait to make it again.

Easy, super moist and delicious. I had two minor changes - I used vanilla pudding because that is all I had and I used 3 very ripe bananas - still delicious. I didn't need all the glaze. I still had about 1/3 left over.

This was easy, fast and wonderful.  I only modified it by three things. I made cupcakes instead of a bundt cake (only because thats what my husband prefers) I used 1 cup of bananas, and I added chocolate chips.  I probably won't do that again though. They all sunk to the bottom. But this was absolutely wonderful.

In this house, brown bananas means banana pudding cake.  The only change that I make is to use applesauce instead of the oil.  There is very littlt oil to begin with and this subtle change reduces the fat and calories with no noticeable flavor change.  This cake is so moist and keeps for a few days very well.

Very yummy desert!  I modified this some and it was great, I only had 3 eggs, so I used 1 cup of applesauce in place of the egg and oil.  I also used 2 mashed bananas - which I think was more than 3/4 a cup.  I made it as a sheet cake and then put crumbled nilla wafers on top of the icing (to make it seem more like banana pudding).  I also had to use more water in my icing and make more than specified because it was a sheet cake and needed to cover not just drizzle.  YUM

I made this cake for a Company potluck this past Monday, and it was a hit!  I made it in a 9X13 pan.  It was easy to make, and people liked the fact that it wasn't too sweet.

Wonderful! Quick and easy to do. I used a little more banana and kicked it up a notch with a smidgen of banana extract. The cream cheese frosting was perfect.

I love this cake! I found it while looking for something that would use up a package of banana cream pudding I had. I took it to work and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I didn't even bother to put frosting on it--it doesn't need it.

I wasn't sure if I should give this cake 3 stars or 4.  I think if you like cake mixes you will like this cake.  It's moist, light, and airy.  However, if you prefer cakes made from scratch, you will probably not be impressed.  You can't disguise the taste of a boxed cake mix with a package of pudding and some mashed banana.  It's good for what it is but not a fantastic cake.

We cannot get enough of this cake! We have made it three times in the past two weeks! I brought it to the beach during spring break, the 5 of us devoured it in one evening! I also made it in two square pans as a layered Bday cake for my bestie who loves bananas! BTW, dont worry if you only use 3 eggs, we didnt have enough the first time and it was still fantastic!! Also, we added in twice the bananas called for. Yummm!!!

The cake itself is fine...moist, with nice banana flavor.  It tastes just like banana bread.  The glaze is not a good accompaniment.  It's too sugary sweet.  A cream cheese frosting would work better.  This was good, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  I'd rather just make some banana bread loaves.

I make this cake all the time for family functions and I ALWAYS get compliments on it.  I make the glaze a lot thinner because the cake is really so good that you don't need a lot of icing on it.  Icing the cake as thick as the picture shows doesn't add anything to the cake except calories.

I think my review can only be taken so far since I not only followed other suggestions by using chocolate cake mix, but I somehow forgot to buy banana pudding at the store and ended up using chocolate pudding as well.  But with all those changes the recipe came out great and I had lots of compliments.  Super moist!  I used store bought cream cheese frosting because to me that's just easier and tastes as good. Next time I will try this with banana pudding for sure.

Very good and simple cake recipe. I used two bananas and a little more vanilla and baked it about 10 min less...I have a convection oven, so this may be why it took less time. It turned out perfect!

Great recipe!  Forget about banana bread--this is delicious.  It's quick and easy to make and a good use of ripe bananas.  A keeper!!!

This was very good. I made it in a bundt pan and rather than topping it with frosting or glaze I dusted it with powdered sugar. I also added chocolate chips as other reviewers suggested.

My husband is officially in love with this cake!  I took another reviewer's advice and added some chocolate chips and used canned whipped cream cheese frosting.  It's so moist and delicious.  I really like the chocolate chips in it, but my husband wants me to try it without them next time.  Either way, this cake is great!

This was a delicious, moist cake.  We really liked it.  I'm giving it 4 stars just because I have other desserts I feel are a little more outstanding than this, but this was well worth making.

Good cake! Very moist and delicious. I will definitely make it again. So easy too. I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect. My only change will be to make less glaze. I just drizzled it and it not only looks pretty but adds great flavor.

I thought this was pretty good. Didn't taste like banana bread to me. I added three mashed bananas and used vanilla pudding. I thought the flavor was really awesome. The texture was a little heavier than I would have liked. All in all it was good though. I didn't do the glaze just sprinkled with powdered sugar. I will say this - eat it warm as it tastes so much better that way!

This reminded me of banana bread to be honest.  I added whipped chocolate frosting with sprinkles for an after dinner desert and everyone liked it, but it wasn't what I expected.

Made this twice, once in a pretty cheap generic bundt cake pan and then again in my nordicware cast aluminum. The one made in the generic pan came out too gooey and dense. I decided to make it again in my "better" bundt cake pan and it came out perfect! It really pays to bake in quality bakeware. I folded in chopped walnuts before putting the batter in the pan and it was wonderful! The nuts gave it a great taste and texture. I like this banana cake recipe because it has a nice banana flavor and it's not too heavy like some banana cakes and breads. My husbands employees all loved it! Thank you.

Very moist cake.  I did not have banana pudding mix on hand so I substituted vanilla and it still tasted great.  My boyfriend ate three pieces in one night.  Next time I will substitute applesauce for oil.  Definately a keeper.

Reminded me of banana bread.  Easy, quick, and moist.  Good for pot luck or picnic, but not one of those dishes you'd make to wow your foodie friends.  Think I would have preferred it with cream cheese icing, as recommended by other reviewers, because I thought the glaze was too sweet without adding much real flavor.  Plus, I made a 9x13 and the glaze just kinda pooled on the semi-flat surface.  So next time, icing.   I will say it was very good with coffee!

I made this cake for Mother's Day and everyone loved it!  This really does look like a store-bought cake and is very moist - super easy to make too.  You will need more milk than the recipe calls for to make the drizzling glaze.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, it's a keeper for sure!

Very easy to make and Very moist.
Reminded me of a big Banana Nut Muffin.
I used a bundt pan and drizzled the glaze and sprinkled the walnuts and it looked like i had bought it from a bakery.
Will definitely make this again.

Oh my, what a delicious cake.  Very simple to prepare and looks like a bakery cake when you add the walnuts on top.  I made extra glaze and put more walnuts than was called for in the recipe.  My husbands comment was "this one is a keeper"

Great banana flavor, but kind of ordinary.  I added banana extract to the glaze which I think helped.  The kids liked it for breakfast.  Adults thought it tasty but plain.

I have made this cake several times, and it is simply delicious! I have gotten requests to make it again and again. Topping with walnuts adds the perfect finishing touch. It stays fresh and moist.

I added the walnuts to the mix and took a pass on the glaze.  When I was ready to serve the cake, I sprinkled it with some powdered sugar.  It is a great recipe!

This cake was delicious. I used the Chocolate Glaze recipe instead of the powdered sugar icing on top of the bundt.  The kids loved it!  When you don't have time to make something from scratch this is perfect.

Banana cake is my favorite, that's what made me try this recipe. I was not disappointed. It was very moist and tasty. I did not make the glaze however, just used prepared frosting, cream cheese flavored and gave a thin coat. Will definately make again. thanks

Great recipe- fast and easy. My husband, who usually is not much of cake eater, devoured it. Even impressed my in-laws! Took the advise of previous reviews and only used about half of the icing. Thanks.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it in a 9x13 pan and spread the glaze evenly over the cake.  I used choped pecans for the top as well as a few cherry halves for colour and variation.  Everyone asked for a second piece so i was saddened to see there were no left overs to nibble on later!!

I made this cake for A Christmas dessert with the neighbors.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! Everyone raved about how moist it was.  I had bought a bigger box of the banana pudding mix but used only what the recipe for the cake called for, then I added a little of the extra pudding mix to the icing and made it even better!! Can't wait to make this cake again...Easy and yummy!!!

This was very moist and tasty but it tasted more like a cake than a bread.  I prefer a more banana bread flavor though and if I make again would definitely add more bananas.

This was a great recipe that travels well.  My husband drives a truck and he takes it with him on the road.  I didn't add any icing and the cake was plenty sweet. I also put nuts in the cake and was not disappointed in doing so.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was a great cake and really easy!  It's the first cake i've ever made.  The directions were easy to follow.  However, when i made the glaze, i found out i had to whisk it by hand - it didn't work well in my mixer.  Also, the glaze makes it VERY sweet.  Overall, great recipe!

My husband is a police officer. Yesterday was his birthday, so I made this cake and took it to the station and he shared it with his squad. He came home this morning and said that his sergeant liked the cake so much that he asked if I would make another cake for him to take to work tonight. Now that is what I call a compliment! For the first cake, I omitted the walnuts and drizzled the glaze over the cake first, then melted chocolate chips over that. (I snipped a tiny hole in a ziplock bag to "pipe" the glaze andchocolate on with). Today, for variety, I added the nuts to the pan before the batter and baked them in, then put the glaze over the top when the cake had cooled for awhile. This recipe is a keeper!

I took this cake to our weekly dinner with my father-in-law and he liked it!  I didn't have to make any special additions to my grocery list to make it.  The ingredients are so basic that I already had everything I needed.

Very quick and easy.  I added the walnuts to the batter and omitted the icing.  Excellent!

This cake was so moist and delicious! I didn't have a bundt pan so i made it in a 9x13 inch pan and instead of the glaze i topped the cake with fresh sliced bananas and a layer of cream cheese frosting - it was gone in no time!

FANTASTIC!!  What a great recipe.  I did not have banana pudding, so I used vanilla...I can't stop eating it!  I'm going to experiment on the pudding flavors and check back in for comment!
Do yourself & your family a favor and make it! YUM!!!
