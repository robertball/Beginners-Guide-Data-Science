This recipe was used for Elderly diabetics and they loved making it! It's so hard to find low-sugar recipes that actually taste as good as this one was. Thanks!

Don't waste your time or ingredients, like I did. These are dry and tasteless. A pain to make because the nuts wouldn't stick. I'll probably end up throwing them out. I would give it zero stars, if I could.

This recipe was so dry that I could barely get dough to form. I had to use extra butter to make it even formable and then it tasted like sawdust anyways.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but I didn't like these at all.  They had no flavor.

A bit flat in taste but attractive looking.

I'm sorry, but these were just gross. the lack of sugar shouldn't mean lack of taste. I made these for some diabetic relatives and they only had one each! there are better recipes.

I adapted these to be Gluten Free using Tapioca Flour, Rice Flour and Sorghum Flour.  I also used Monk Fruit Sweetener to make these and increased the amount to 4 tablespoons and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dough.  I slightly flattened the dough balls and then pressed the cinnamon nut mixture into the dough.  We are getting used to eating GF and less sugar and these fit the cookie treat craving.
