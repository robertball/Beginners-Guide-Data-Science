This was very good! I have to admit, I'm getting tired of all of these reviews where people say "I used (blank) because it's all I had on hand." These are recipes and I rely on the reviews to know how they taste - not what you had on hand and how THAT tasted! Am I the only one that actually GOES to the store to buy the necessary ingredients to make a recipe??? There was nothing wrong with the way this recipe was written ...and yes, I followed the recipe and bought ALL necessary ingredients. Please just add this recipe to your circulation and buy all the ingredients and follow the recipe because you will find that this dish is really very good...just as written! Thank you Bill Pollackov for posting such a yummy recipe that my whole family loved!

My husband loves zucchini and always wants more, since I don't care for it too much I was looking for a compromise.  This recipe pleased both of us.  I used canned crab ( more affordable) and frozen pre-cooked shrimp and the taste was still great.  The only change I made was to put the stuffed zucchini in a glass dish and put a few tablespoons of water on the bottom.  If the water evaporated I would add a little more.  It keeps the food moist.  We loved the flavor and how crisp the zucchini stayed.  This is a keeper and will be a summer favorite.
Thanks!

What an amazing dish! I would add more garlic in with the bread crumbs and a little cayan pepper for a little kick. I also added fresh parmasean to top them off. My guests couldn't stop raving over how wonderful this meal was!

I followed the recipe but I did add a little water to the baking sheet as other reviewers suggested.  I also used one large zucchini instead of four smaller ones and added diced mushrooms.  I did wonder about the lack of salt, but it was great without it.  My husband loved this recipe and we will have it again.

Very good recipe when you've got too many zicchini in the fridge.  The only change I would make is cut the amount of garlic and oregano in half.  All the spices kind of overwhelmed the seafood.

I followed the recipe, but what very disappointed. The zucchini was mushy and the filling bland. Hubby enjoyed the filling. I will not be making this again, but thanks for sharing.

The flavor was wonderful and very good, my stuffing came otu to be too much and it just overflowed which was odd but looked very impressive

I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was adding lean bacon tore into small pieces on top before baking.  I loved the bacon and seafood combination.  Great simple recipe to impress friends.

I pretty much followed the directions on this, except that quantities were based on purchased size at the store (Crabmeat Qty a little less, Shrimp a little more).  I wasn't thrilled with the result.  It was bland, and I felt it was missing something.  The zucchini itself came out fine.  I used the recommendation of putting water in the bottom of the pan while cooking in the oven.  I probably won't try this one again.

Great concept, but I found these to be a little bland.  I used all crabmeat.  I found that I also had to nuke the zucchini a little bit to make them soft enough to scrap out the inside of them.  I may try these again sometime and alter some of the seasoning.

I added lobster chunks besides the shrimp and crabmeat. I sprinkled mozzerrella cheese ontop instead. I thought it was delicious but next time I wouldn't add the lime juice. My husband wasn't fond of it, but my dad who hates zucchini ate the stuffing and left the shell.

The stuffing for this recipe was good, but overall the dish only turned out OK for me. I thought that the stuffing was a little dry. If I tried this recipe again, I'd probably add a little water to the bottom of the pan, and cover the pan with tin foil.

This was a very simple, somewhat impressive dish.  It didn't knock my socks off, but I think it has potential.  Low in calories & fat, but the kids wouldn't touch it.  The stuffing was moist and the seasonings all blended well.  I also added a bit of cayenne to give it more punch.

Followed the recipe and was very dissapointed. Good combinations, but bland. IF I ever try this again I would eliminate adding the zucchini meat back in and would also add some old bay.

This was a great way to use the big zucchini from the garden. I added a bit of bacon before the cheese. I didn't have any crab so I only used the shrimp. And I used mozzarella cheese. It was great. My husband ate two servings!

Not bad, but I think I would leave out the lemon and lime juice if I tried this again.  The citrus flavor just wasn't to my taste.

i  used all crab, no shrimp, and all lemon juice as I didn't have any lime juice..   I also stired the cheese into the mixture instead of leaving it on top, which after baking seemed a bit too hard.  Next time I will add it later to see if the top doesn't get so crusty.   He liked it and wants to try it again with a few changes.

Very versatile recipe. Thanks for the base recipe and I enjoyed all the ideas in the reviews too.  I Used packaged Herb Seasoned stuffing cubes. Stir Fried raw shrimp in coconut oil, with garlic, oregano, and basil, till just pink. Cut shrimp into bite size pieces. Didn't have crab meat, so left out. Mixed stir fried shrimp into the stuffing, egg, and zucchini meat.  Used all the zucchini meat and a little extra breadcrumbs until the mixture just held together. (As the zucchini scrapings were quite moist.)  Stuffed the zucchini halves and squeezed 1/2 fresh lemon juice on top of stuffed zucchinis, instead of mixing it in. Also added a few tablespoons of water to bottom of casserole dish. Left pepper out of recipe and ground some fresh pepper on top of stuffed zucchinis. Only had Mozarella cheese.  This was delicious and would be great for having company, because it could be assembled ahead of time and baked when needed, freeing up the cook for other things.

This recipe was pretty good.  I only had shrimp so that was all that went in. It does turn out a little dry, but good none-the-less.

This is good. We grilled the zucchinis, and the only seafood I used was shrimp that I diced and sauted in chicken broth and garlic powder. My nine year old daughter didn't care for it much, but she did eat it.
