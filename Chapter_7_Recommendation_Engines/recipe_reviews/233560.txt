I'm certainly not a stranger to this recipe, it's been a favorite since I was little.  I used one large honeycrisp apple and about 5 fun-size Snickers.  This is an easy go-to and always a crowd pleaser.

MAKE THE PUDDING ACCORDING TO PACKAGE DIRECTIONS FIRST! Thankfully I read through reviews and realized I needed to make the pudding first. Mixed the pudding and whipped topping together and threw the rest in. My students loved this easy to put together snack.

The pudding mix did not incorporate into the whipped cream; it was very stiff and unpleasant.  My husband, who loves apple snicker salad, was very disappointed as this is the dish he requested. After speaking with family members, the pudding mix needs to be combined with milk, then the whipped cream is folded in. 
Will not use this recipe again.

Made it as is, but added about a 1/2 cup of milk. Creamed it up a bit.  Everyone loved it.

This was a disaster. .. the pudding mix did not dissolve into the cool whip, so the result was a grainy textured coating. I read a few other similar recipies that said to dissolve the pudding mix in milk first then add it to the cool whip. Also the 5.1 Oz box of pudding  is way more than enough, I think the smaller box would be much better.

Really easy and tastes delicious. I used Jazz apples in my recipe and it's a great end to dinner.

Easy tasty recipe! I like to switch it up with white chocolate or butterscotch pudding or use Red Delicious apples. No matter how you switch it up this recipe is always a crowd pleaser!
