Simply delicious and a perfect summer meal. I used olive oil as well as butter, white wine, and yellow squash as well as zucchini. For color, freshness and added flavor I finished the dish with chopped fresh parsley and a chiffonade of fresh basil. I believe without these additions this would have been a bit boring and tasteless. Simple to throw together and just minutes from start to serving, this will definitely be a "go to" dish for a quick and delicious summer dinner.

This was a big hit with my daughter. Easy to make, pretty to look at, and relatively healthy too. Who could ask for anything more? Served with some freshly grated parmesan to sprinkle on top. Thanks!

This was REALLY nummy!  I did not have Fetticcine noodles so used Rotini..that is not the hot ticket...too heavy for the light flavors.  Actually, this is sooo good without noodles I will definately make it again minus noodles altogether.  Like another reviewer, I also used olive oil and butter (I can't believe it's not butter spray).

Great recipe. Just added basil and yellow pepper (it goes great with pasta). To top it all off I sprinkled it with Parmesan cheese. Really easy and flavorful.

This was a good "healthy" meal. The veggies were refreshing, but the sauce was liquid- needed to be a little more thick.

This was pretty good. I added a green bell pepper and some grated parmesan cheese.
