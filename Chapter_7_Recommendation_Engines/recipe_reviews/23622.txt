Very good potato soup and I loved that it was done in 35 min! I cooked the potatoes in the microwave - meanwhile, I sauted the veggies. The veggies were willing and waiting at about the time the potatoes were done. I did need to add much more milk  - I think by the time it was said and done I had used a total of 2 1/2c of milk. Also, I added apprx 2oz of Velveeta cheese, a small handful of bacon bits, a few dashes of dried parsley and S&P.  Stirred together until the cheese was melted and all was heated through. My family was very pleased with the soup and my daughter had 3 small bowl! Thanks Tina for the basic, easy, & tasty recipe!

This was a very yummy, very easy recipe.  I didn't have any cream of potato soup on hand, so I subbed one can of condensed cheddar soup and one can of condensed pepper jack soup, and it turned into a great cheesy potato/veggie soup.  Reminded me of Marie Callendar's.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is wonderful.  Very easy to make and tasty.  My teenage son made this soup for his friends at Christmas and was a big hit.

This recipe was so quick, easy, and tasty.  I'd make it again in a heartbeat! I'm not much of a meat fan and this recipe had lots of flavor without the need for bacon or ham.

This was a great soup - and easy to make without a ton of ingredients.  I added an extra carrot and celery stalk, and I threw in a couple of additional small potatoes that I had in the pantry - that way I could use 3 cans of soup - cream of potato, chedder cheese, and cream of onion.  I bought a mini loaf of fresh bread from the bakery to eat with it as well.  And topped with some bacon bits.  It was great and I am looking forward to the leftovers.

Good, but didn't sautee celery long enough and it was crunchy in my soup.  :(  Added 2 oz velveeta and parley.  Easy and pretty good! Oh and I put at least 2 1/2 to 3 C of milk in it for my preferred soup consistency.

I almost hesitate to give a glowing review to a recipe that is just adding vegetables to canned soup but I have to say that this was very good.  I halved the recipe.  I used about a dozen small potatoes which I cooked in mostly chicken broth with some water added.  I had a half can of cream of celery to use up so I added it and it added an additional layer of flavor.  I liked that the celery and carrots were still slightly crunchy.  I'm not fond of mush.  I also added a small hunk of Velveeta (probably about 1 ounce) to the soup at the end right before serving.   I will make this soup again.

Today is a gloomy rainy day. This soup was easy and fast to make. My husband and I enjoyed the soup while watching an old movie.

For the effort I put into it, this was very good. I added more milk than the recipe stated to thin it out some, then served the soup topped with bacon, cheese, parsley flakes, and green onion.
