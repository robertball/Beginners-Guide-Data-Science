It does not get any easier than this. 4 ingredients people...4!! The flavor of this punch is amazing. The only thing I did differently was add more ALCOHOL! 2 Cups...I like a lil kick w/ my drinks. Great 4 party's/get 2gethers...I like 2 make the punch a day b4 so all the flavors really have a chance 2 meld 2gether. U won't be disappointed!

This did not turn out as good as I as was hoping for. It lacks flavor.
