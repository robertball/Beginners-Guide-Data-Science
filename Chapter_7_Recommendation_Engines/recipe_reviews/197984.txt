Delicious and easy to make! One tip about serving it is to use plastic party cups normally for drinks for your guests to put the muddy buddies in! they slide around on plates and are too messy to hold in your hand. Instant classic!

DO NOT Add the VANILLA until after you microwave everything.  I added it all together and it made the mixture thick and hard to spread.  When I added it after the butter mixture was melted it was nice and runny so it covered the Chex better. In other words follow the recipe exactly! :)

Awesome!! My 5 kids love this stuff! Its spring break here and I needed aomething good and plentiful for them and all there friends and this hit the spot!! It is well worth every minute and every bite! HOWEVER I did mine a bit different. Here is what I did: I took 2 bags of butterscotch chips and 1 full 18oz jar of creamy peanut butter and melted them in the microwave. I poured it into a large bowl with 1 full box of rice chex and 1 box of corn chex that I had already mixed together. After blending all that together I got a lare paper bag and poured half a bag of powdered sugar in the bottom, dumped in the mixture of chex and peanut butter and butterscotch chips on top of the powdered sugar then I poured the other half a bag of powdered suar on top of the mixture. I rolled the bag down a bit to close it and I shook the bag for several minutes to cover the chex mixture with sugar. If you need more sugar add more. After that I took the mixture and put 1cup in small ziplock bags so they could just grab a snack bag and go. It is handy and less messy that way! I hope this is helpful and you all enjoy!!!

This is really very good!  I used just the rice and corn chex because I thought the chocolate chex would be too sweet.  Also, I used just a cup of powdered sugar and it came out fantasic.  The kids loved it!

My 8 yr old is allergic to peanut butter. So, we just substitute "Sunflower Butter" instead. It's made w/ sunflower seeds instead of peanuts.  She loves it & it's a snack she can eat with her brother without being told no.

I followed the recipe exact, only using name brand peanut butter because.....we'll......you never know. (I've had issues before using store brand peanut butter in cookies and I didn't want to take a chance and use store brand in this recipe and have wasted ingredients.) Making this was just like I remembered making it as a kid, only I got to show my kids how to make it! We had a blast and it turned out perfectly. Still as good as I remembered and from the looks on my kids' faces, it was just as great for them.

My mom and I have been making these since I was a little kid. It's the quickest, easiest, tastiest party dessert you'll ever make. Everyone we know calls it "puppy chow" for some reason, and they look at us like we're crazy when we say we made "muddy buddies" but I always knew that was the real name! The recipe is easy to remember if you're doubling it (1 bag chocolate chips, 1 cup peanut butter, 1 stick butter, 1 box chex or crispix) and I never measure the powedered sugar.

Be careful your Chex say "Gluten Free" otherwise they are not.  Barley malt has gluten in it per Barley.  Though Chex does sell glutten-free cereal, there is still regular Chex, (rice, corn..) that contain gluten, on the shelves many places. To my disappointment, we do not have Gluten Free Chex at my local grocery store.

I made this for my daughter's 4 year old pre-k class for a snack. It was so easy and my daughter had so much fun helping. I love the new calculate button. Had to make enough for 24. Will be making again.

Do not make this recipe if you are not willing to accept that you will probably eat it all and gain 50lbs. I followed it exactly except that I only had crunchy peanut butter on hand. Turned out perfectly fine!! So delicious. I'm not sure the vanilla is totally necessary since it seems to be an outstanding flavor in this, but its not so overwhelming that you can't devour it. Yum Yum!

Always a hit at my parties, especially when I use peanuts and pretzels...for my last party,I decided to try crunchy chow mein noodles and they were incredible! I also used 1/2 chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips...it was just as good. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

My recipe for this is called "White Trash" and it is mixed in a brown paper grocery sack.  Put cereal in sack, add the melted chocolate/butter/peanutbutter mixture.  My recipe calls for a cup of peanuts and a cup of raisins (the best part, I think)  and they are added on top of the chocolate.  You roll up the bag and carefully "shake" the contents.  Once all coated evenly dump in powdered sugar and shake until well coated.  EASY CLEANUP

Easy, great sweet snack.  I followed the recipe per instructions.  Serve in individual ziip-lock bags or 3-oz paper cups for easy control  over size of servings  and handling of the food.

Perfect recipe! Tastes so much better than even the Chex brand Muddy buddies I buy at the store. My friends hate me because I make these for all our get togethers and they eat this by the cupful. A great snack or finger food at a party.

I made this Dairy Free.  I used 12tbsp cocoa powder, 10 tbsp sugar and 4 tbsp veg oil to replace the chocolate chips.  I also replaced the butter with dairy free spread (Earth Balance or Smart Balance Light). 


My chocolate mixture was a little too thick though so next time I will add more oil.  I will also add the oil to the cocoa/sugar mix to make a smooth consistancy before adding the butter and peanutbutter.  (I had it all in the same bowl to begin with)  You will not need to micro this as long as the traditional directions.

It still tastes really good!

Always a favorite in this house.  I made a batch recently to take for a sweet snack for my kids at their swim meet.  Added in some peanut butter M&M's for some color and taste.  The kids, as well as a lot of the parents, loved this as a snack.  And, it's so easy to make!

This is delicious!  At my house, we call this Puppy Chow.  I took a reviewer's advice and replaced some of the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.  Also, I split this recipe in half because it was just for my hubby and I.  Love it - thanks!

Resealable plastic bags are expensive so I used the two empty plastic cereal box liners, poured half the powdered sugar in each bag, then half the cereal mixture in each bag, used clips to seal the tops.

Ahhh the good old off the box Muddy Buddies... aka Puppy Chow.... i did however use the old school method of melting the chocolate and peanut butter on the stove... just seems to work easier for me as long as I have time to stir and keep an eye on it... very good.. quick and easy and a classic...

I use Rice Chex, reduced fat peanut butter, and milk chocolate chips.  I also add extra powdered sugar to really coat them!  Yum!  (I always forget to add the vanilla but it doesn't seem to make a difference.)

Haven't made this since my college grad was in preschool.  Made it for my college student to take back to her dorm-mates. I used a full box of Crispix cereal, which the label says is 12 cups. Doubled the coating stuff (a full bag of choc chips), then went light on the butter and heavy on the PB. And frankly forgot the vanilla. I feared it might be too 'muddy' but wasn't. Instead of wasting disposable bags I tossed the powdered sugar on in the extra-largest Tupperware bowls after using one of them for tossing on the coating. Perfect!

I made this for my boyfriend's mom since she is on a glute-free diet.  I think she will love this!  Make sure you add the vanilla AFTER you melt the ingredients in the microwave.  This recipe is delicious.  I used crunchy peaunut butter and like the little bits of nutiness!  I think next time I'll use extra crunchy.  I didn't have a 2 gallon bag so I used a clean tall kitchen trash bag.  I just put everything in the bottom of the bag and twisted in the middle leaving plenty of room for the shaking.  I was a little worried since the bag was not see through but it worked perfectly.

My 9 year old son made this with a mix of Chocolate Chex (where he saw the recipe) and Corn Chex.  The recipe went together very easily and he really enjoyed the taste.  To me, this is way too sweet, but I love any recipe that will get my kids in the kitchen (especially the ones that need to learn how to feed themselves due to food allergies).

I had extra peanut butter chips so I used those instead of a 1/2 cup of actual peanut butter and it worked great.

This is a hit with everyone in my household. I was unable to find a 2 gallon resealable bag to toss with powdered sugar so I used an oven bag for a turkey which worked great.

Love these!  I made them w/ 5c Corn Chex and 4c Cheerios, b/c that is what I had on hand.  Also just mixed in large bowl, b/c I did not have a large enough bag.  Worked fine that way.  Sinful!

I made this for my kid's birthday party and it came out great!  I omitted the peanut butter, therefore had to increase the butter just a bit to make it less viscous, but it was delicious.  Also, I tried using white chocolate chips for another batch- it did NOT work out.  Stick to the semisweet chips!

Just made these for my kids' snack this week. (If my husband likes them as much as I think he will, they'll only last a couple of days!)  Bagged in little snack-sized zipper bags...perfect portions!  This was so easy to make and super-yummy!  Where has this recipe been all my life?!

I can't get enough of this stuff. I use the Chocolate Chex and a heaping 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I don't use a bag I just slowly add in the powdered sugar stirring into the mixture.

My family and I make this all the time now. It's pretty quick and easy and all seven of us, ages 11 months to 32 years, like it. The amount of cereal and powdered sugar can be adjusted to your tastes.

We make these soy and nut free by using pure sweet cream butter and enjoy life brand chocolate chips. We skip the peanut butter and use coconut oil and it gives a great flavor. If you are dairy free and many celiacs are, you should be able to substitute all coconut oil. And be sure to check your vanilla label, some are not gluten free.

Delicious little bites ... very addicting.  As per another reviewer, I put some of the sugar in the bag, added the chex then the remainder of the sugar.  Just made it a little easier to mix.  Stored in snack sized ziplock bags in fridge.  Perfect to just grab a bag and go. Great on a road trip.  Will be making again!

I've made this recipe before but the name on the recipe I used was "Human Puppy Chow".  Not sure why because not many puppies eat Chex cereal...  Anyways, it is very good and once you take a handful, you're addicted!

I just felt this recipe was OK.  Extremely easy, but I just feel if I'm going to consume the extra calories I want it to be worth it, ya know?  This I can see just sitting in the pantry until it's finally tossed.  Sorry but I wont be making again.

This is so easy and so delicious!  I added a bit more chocolate chips and used some peanut butter chips as well.  It is very rich though, which isn't bad, it just means I don't eat it all at once.  More for later!

First time making it, and it was wonderful!  I love that it makes enough for my big family without having to double the recipe.

I like the recipe "as is". However, less powdered sugar would be just as good. The 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar is just too overpowering. I made a batch with more peanut butter and it tasted great too. Peanut Butter fanatics love it! Great for those on gluten free diet that want something sweet!

My kids have always loved this but about a year ago we found our youngest had a peanut allergy, so we've quit making anything with peanut butter. But my 7-year old son requested this today so we omitted the p.b. and used milk chocolate chips instead. Wow, it was still as irresistible as ever, if not more so! Only problem was the chocolate got too thick. Instead of microwaving on full power I would do it on half-power as it recommends on the bag of chips. Also, there was way too much powdered sugar so I'd decrease that to 1 c. I even added about 3 c. wheat chex and it was still great! So much for the workout this morning! :}

Easy, quick and tasty. I use the rice and corn Chex - the chocolate Chex taste artificial to me. This makes a lot of Buddies but people go crazy over it! You won't have leftovers.

This is a classic! It's great for kids, but *ahem* adults love it too. It's a little difficult to mix the chocolate mixture into the chex, but keep trying- takes me about 10 minutes.
