I would give this 6 stars if I could!  This was amazing and I'll definitely make it again!  I served it with Grapevine Spice and Tea Exchange Thai Green Curry Rice blend, salad, and Little Penguin Shiraz.  Happy I made enough for two meals!

Delicious! No IKEA around here so I used Vegan Meatballs from Garden. Would also be nice with veggies, next time Iâ€™ll try Cauliflower, Peas or Mushrooms. Husband says it is a keeper.

I substituted in meatless meatballs. The recipe overall was a little disappointing to me, but my meat-eating friends enjoyed it!
