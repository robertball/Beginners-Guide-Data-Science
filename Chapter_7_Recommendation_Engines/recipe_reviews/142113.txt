My grandmother added some spices that really enhanced the flavors and made the whole house smell divine: She would add a few sticks of cinnamon, 2-3 cloves and sometimes when available- 2-3 crushed cardamom pods with seeds while simmering. She served it hot in winter and fall and called it "hot fruit compote". We would  top our ice cream with it, and when cold we would top it on cottage cheese. and dip with plain or graham crackers. She did not add nuts or cranberries to it, I think that is a good idea Pixie!.- Thanks for reminding me of this recipe I haven't made it for years.

I was very pleased with this salad.  Of course, I had to tweak it somewhat (don't think I've ever made a recipe without at least one change).  I was afraid that it didn't have enough liquid, so I added two cups of o.j. before simmering.  And since I didn't have pinenuts, I used cashews left from Christmas.   I would rename it "Really, Truly Delicious Dried Fruit Salad as it isn't really that pretty!  Served it to a crowd of 20 this evening and they all seemed to love it.  Thanks, Pixiex3

I used what dried fruits I had. No figs, so I used cherries instead. No dark raisins, so I doubled the golden ones. The apricots give this salad color, so I might add just a few more next time. I did cut them up at the end to spread the color out. I didn't want to wait overnight, so I put them in the water and brought them to a boil. Then I covered the pot, removed them from the heat, and let them sit for an hour. After that I continued with the recipe and they turned out just fine. This is delicious and reminds me of warm fruit compotes I've had before. Definitely delicious for any occasion even if not really, truly gorgeous.

I'd do just cranberries and one other fruit, or maybe both figs and apricots, and serve with ice cream or greek yogurt

I loved this recipe! I've made it several times, varied it slightly; (like Paula, I used dried cherries instead of the figs), and last time I sprinkled some port over the stewed fruit, then tossed it gently. It was superb. God bless you PixieX3.

Like other reviewers, I used what dried fruit I had (figs, dates, currants, raisins) and it turned out well.
