This got mixed reviews from my family. My daughter thought it was perfect and ate 4 legs by herself. I thought it was a bit bland even after adding cayenne pepper and using lime pepper potato chips. I will say that I have never eaten chicken this juicy. I might try adding seasoning to the flour next time. The method is quite accurate. The chicken was cooked perfectly at 32 minutes even though I’m at 7000ft altitude.

This was quick and flavorful. The one problem I did have was with the blood in the chicken. My area is home of Tyson chicken. The fresh drumsticks were huge. Great for deep frying but not so great for oven baking. If your legs are really big I recommend either soaking them in salt water beforehand to rid them of excess blood or either parboiling them. If not, you will end up with a not so appetizing outcome. I hate to even mention it but I feel I must. This recipe is fast and super simple and one definitely worth making. Tyson knows chicken and that makes me proud to live in Tyson capitol.

Cook time is spot on for my large drumsticks. Easy to throw together for a quick dinner. Both hubby and I thought it was very bland even after adding some onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the flour. Crispy but definitely needs more spices to liven it up.

Internal temp is pre 2004 guidelines.  If you want juicy chicken remove at 165 degrees internal.  To maximize oven crispy chicken try this.  DO NOT pre-heat oven.  By doing this the moisture will be removed quicker and you have a crispy product.  Forget cooking times and rely on your temp gage for perfect results.  This is obvious a base recipe and will need some seasoning.  After removing chicken from oven place on wire rack, never on paper towels.  Paper towels causes the chicken to steam and lose the crispy effect.

8.5.18  I haven’t had a chicken drumstick in years, and I think what I found out today is that I’m not a huge fan of that part of the chicken.  It really did crisp up very nicely like it was supposed to do, but simply was not our favorite.  Can’t fault the recipe, I think this is just a matter of personal taste preference .

Delicious!! I used plain panko bread crumbs instead of chips to cut down on the cholesterol and sodium. Otherwise I followed the recipe faithfully. Very happy with the results and will definitely make again!

It need it some seasoning like black pepper, salt, garlic powder or salt, season salt... when I added those seasonings to the mixture it tasted better and crunchy.

I made this, but based on the reviews, I seasoned the chicken drumsticks well before I floured them.  I used S&P, garlic powder and cayenne, threw them in a bag of flour with added garlic powder, rolled them in beaten egg w/the water, then rolled them in a plate of crushed sour cream and onion regular potato chips, then on the baking sheet.  They were not bland.  Family opinions averaged out to better than OK but nobody would stand in line for them.  Consensus seemed to be "not bad!"  I'd probably make them again but not for a month or two.

My husband liked this recipe because he loves drumsticks. Depending on the size of the drumsticks you may have to bake longer than the suggested cooking time. I liked this recipe, but I couldn't find baked chips in the small town I lived in. So, I used regular chips. Don't use any salt if you use regular chips. I added cayenne pepper, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder.

Overall, this recipe is easy to make and the texture was great, but bland.   Watch the potato chips that you use.   Kettle chips seem to use less salt than as some other brands.  I added pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the recipe and still found the recipe lacking much flavor.
