We've been making this soup for years now and LOVE IT!..we've changed it a bit to thicken it: 2 cans cream of chicken, 2 cans cream of mushroom, 7 cups of milk, and 1/2 a cup of franks buffalo wing sauce...O and for extra special treat serve with French bread and Bleu cheese butter. YUM!

This soup is the best! Ive been making it for years and everyone always loves it. A couple of suggestions:
1) Add potatoes (or other veggies of your liking) and extra chicken to make it bulkier (this might help the complaint some had of it being to thin.)
2) Cook the chicken in butter and hot sauce to infuse the chicken with flavor!
3) It's unneccessary to make this in the crockpot. Its just as good made on the stove-just cook it long enough for the vegetables (if added) to get tender.
4) Go heavy on the hot sauce! Its better with MORE!

I'm from Buffalo so I'm always skeptical about anything with named Buffalo chicken anything ;)  With that said, I recently had Chicken Wing soup at a restaurant and wanted to try a less fattening one at home.  I made this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I added abount a half cup each of chopped onions and celery, a cup of crumbled blue and used only two cans of chicken soup and about 2/3 of the milk called for just to suit our tastes.  We also used about a cup of hot sauce because we like things spicy.  I'm going to make this again and again.

I had ordered chicken wing soup at a local restaurant some time ago and loved it.  Since then I looked occasionally for a recipe until I found this one.  I thought it was great!  Like other reviewers, I used less milk - 4 cups.  I also added some crumbled bleu cheese and some shredded mozzarella shortly before serving.  I will definitely make this again and I'm sharing the recipe already too!

Being from Buffalo, I have high expectations for anything labeled "Buffalo style." When I made the recipe as-is, it came out pretty gross and inedible. The second time around I made these adjustments and it was fantastic: sauteed 1/2 of a sweet onion and 3 stalks of celery in 1T of butter, used 4c. milk and 2 cans of cream of chicken, sauteed the chicken in Frank's red hot sauce and butter, used 1/2c. of hot sauce, and added a big chunk of bleu cheese. With these changes it was delish!

I love this recipe! It is so quick and easy. My family couldnt get enough of it.  I did however only add 3 cups of milk, because I like my soup to be a bit thicker. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Everyone I made this recipe for is a huge fan and critic of chicken wings and we all loved the soup. I made it with the same proportions of milk and condensed soup and mine didn't turn out too thin or watery at all. 
I combined all the ingredients the night before and added an entire cup of hot sauce instead of just 1/4 and it wasn't too hot for us. We like hot wings and I even ended up swirling a little bit more into my own bowl. 
My only other addition was to top my serving with 2 tbsp blue cheese. 
I have made this twice already and will definitely be making it again.

I used a full cup of store brand buffalo chicken wing sauce.  We added some hot pepper sauce and a spoon full of blue cheese crumbles to the top of each bowl.  It was great!  Also used one store bought rotissier chicken shredded.

This was good. We like thicker soup so I just added an extra can of soup and adjusted the milk as needed. We topped the soup with crumbled blue cheese and served with tortilla chips. Everything tasted great and it's very filling.

I love this! I didn't use 6 cups of milk, only 4 because my family likes thicker soups. Its easy and mine did turn out a light orange...maybe because I used 3/4 cup of Texas Pete buffalo wing bbq sauce. Awesome! I will make again and again

I made this for lunch, so I reduced all the amounts to 1/3 thier original, except the hot sauce which I kept at the full 1/4 cup, and the milk that I reduced down another half (so I used 1 cup total)  This soup was delicious!  I will make it often! Thanks for an awesome easy soup!  I only had 2 hours between the time I put it in the crock pot and lunch, and it was perfect.  Next time I might just warm it on the stove top.

Excellent. Cut milk back as others suggested because we also like things creamier.  Used entire bottle of Franks Wing sauce - was a bit too spicey for me but husband loved. Will use a little less next time.  Also, dumped in some veggies to give it more of a bulk - onion, celery, corn, beans, etc...  Very easy to make the way you like it. Will use again. Oh, and freezes great!  I seperate soups into individual containers and freeze and this reheats just fine.

tried it as is on the stovetop, ended up adding garlic and more sour cream.  otherwise definitely a YUM and something to make again and experiment some more with.  Thank you for a good, simple starter recipe!

Delicious! I cooked/shredded 4 chicken breasts, then put back in pan with some of franks buffalo wing hot sauce and some butter, mixed till butter was melted then added to soup mixture. I also added minced garlic and about 1/2 of chopped a onion and some paprika to the soup. Served with a 'dallop' of sour cream, shredded mozzarella, and crushed tortilla chips! Used 6 cups of milk, thought it was still creamy but enough liquid to still add the chips and be 'soupy'. Will be doubling the recipe next time!!

This recipe is great!  It's perfect to make for parties.  I'll be serving it at this year's Super Bowl Party.  My 12-year-old even loved it with tortilla chips!  I did make a large batch.  I used 16 half chicken breasts (shredded), 1 1/2 cups of Frank's Buffalo Chicken sauce, 1 and 1/2 cups of light sour cream and 7 cups of 2% milk.  I started with 4 cups of milk, but it was too much like a dip.  By adding the additional milk it made it more of a soup, but it could still be thick enough to eat with nacho chips.

1/2/09 This wasn't bad at all! Far easier than making real wings! I cut it by a third, only using 2 cans soup, etc., although it wasn't until just now that I realized I still used the whole 1/4c hot sauce. whoops. I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese.I think next time I will try fat free sour cream or perhaps even plain yogurt to reduce the guilt factor (and lighten the texture). I also used some cooked shredded turkey I had in the freezer and it worked well. While it was very good as written, the flavor needed a bit of help so I ended up adding 1tsp paprika, 1/2tsp garlic powder and 1/2tsp black pepper. That also kicked up the heat, but not so much as to bother a spice wuss like me. My husband went ape for this stuff. I'm not a fan of heavy creamy soups so I wasn't quite as nuts over it, but it tasted very good. The texture was just a bit much for me, maybe from subbing the cream cheese. As written I would easily call it a 4* but with just a bit of help it's definitely a 5*. Will probably make this often (at hubby's constant request!) 3/2/09 I make this about every other week. I now always use sour cream and the texture is perfect. For the sake of adding both nutrition and bulk, I add about 2-3c diced carrots that I microwave in a little water until they are just cooked through, then I dump them, cooking water and all, into the soup. This also freezes quite well. You just have to heat it up enough and it looks as good as fresh.

Taste was okay, but IF I ever make it again I will use WAY more chicken and maybe some corn starch or flour to thicken it up. I think my brain was also a bit put off that it didn't turn out orange, like normal buffalo wings look. My husband tolerated it but isn't rushing to have it again.

I just made this over the weekend and although I like a thicker soup, it is a nice start.  I will be making it again, using less milk and maybe some blue cheese as others have suggested.

Following some other commenter's suggestions, I used 4 cups milk, 2 cans of cream of mushroom and just shy of half a cup of hot sauce. We also sprinkled some bleu cheese on top before serving. Very tasty! Will definitely make again.

I sooo wanted to love this!  I love Buffalo Chicken but unfortunately, it didn't work out for us at all.  I couldn't even keep the left-overs.  The kids wouldn't eat it.  I think this may be a recipe that might have to have certain brands used on the ingredients.  The wing sauce & condensed soups that I used had a terrible taste!  :(

Delicious!  I modified the recipe based on other reviews... 4 1/2C milk, 4 cans Cream of Chicken Soup, 1C Frank's hot sauce, 1C sour cream, shredded cooked chicken.  The consistency was perfect and the taste was great...just enough kick, but not too hot!

Creamy, just spicy enough!  Sauteed boneless chicken breast in butter and hot sauce (per recommendation), before shredding.  We also added sliced celery towards the end so it was still crunchy.  Topped with a sprinkling of bleu cheese.  We heated it together on the stove and it came together quickly.  We will definitely make this again.

Really good soup, tastes like a big bowl of hot sauce! I used wing sauce, which is a little thicker than hot pepper sauce, and a used a little more than half a cup.  I used less milk, but more sour cream to get the consistency I wanted.  I also cooked the chicken with some pepper and a few dashes of cayenne.  Topped with blue cheese as another reviewer suggested and it was great!

Very good and flavorful soup.  Be sure to warm the chicken in a separate pan with butter and your preferred hot sauce, this gets the sauce to stick to the chicken and gives it great flavor.  Also serve with Ritz or Toll House crackers.  The butter flavor cracker adds a lot, especially if you feel the soup is too thin...

I also wanted to re-create this recipe after trying it at a local pub. This was a good start, but I wanted to really thicken mine up. We ate it almost like dip instead of soup using tortilla chips to scoop it up. Yum! I did not use the crock pot. I started by heating up a chopped onion and chopped celery in butter until tender, whisking in 1/4 cup flour. I only had 1 cup of cooked chopped chicken, so I added that and 1/2 cup of hot sauce, I like mine spicy! I decreased the milk to 2 cups, used 1 & 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and 1/2 cup of sour cream. I added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to the recipe. Just cut it into pieces and let it melt into the soup. Let it heat through and thicken up for about 15-20 minutes. This is definitely one for the recipe box. What a nice meal for those cool winter nights!

I've been making this for years, following the original directions, and it is always a big hit! I usually use canned chicken for convenience but use chopped turkey after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is a great way to use those leftovers to make a warm and easy meal with a kick!

I think it would have been better with some green peppers perhaps.  Something with a little crunch and color.

LOVE IT!  A restaurant in town puts this on their menu once in a while, but never when I am there, so I went searching.  A few things: Like others I fry up the chicken in red hot in a pan (didn't like the canned chicken either) with lots of peppers.  Any kind you want.  I've used jalepeno, banana and bell.  I like it hot, but not too hot.  Add as you like.  I also think it thickens better on the stove rather than crock.  I have also made this as a last minute.  Just freeze left over chicken and peppers for when you want to make it in the future.

I wasn't sure if I would like this. But it was amazing. I added some potatoes, black beans and corn to thicken it up and it was great. Even my husband loved it!!

I healthified this recipe by using fat free soup, fat free milk and low fat sour cream, but it was absolutely amazing.  For anyone who likes buffalo chicken wings, I would definitely recommend this recipe... not to mention how easy it is!!

Definitely a good start. It just seemed to be missing something. I'm not sure what. I'll tinker with it to get the right wing flavor.

I love this soup, it's great for the winter months. I prefer a little more bite and use between 1/3 and 1/2 cup buffalo sauce. I like Anchor Bar's medium buffalo wing sauce.

This is GREAT!Very good because you can mix it all up and have it in the slow cooker ready to go. Great for company, potlucks etc... We really enjoyed this one. We served with blue cheese crumbles and sprinkled hot sauce on top. Just like chicken wings!

All I can say, is that I am really dissapointed in this recipe.  I was reluctant to make it, but after reading the reviews I decided to go ahead and make it, since I LOVE buffalo wings.  I followed the recipe, except, due to other reviews and me wanting it to be thicker, I reduced the milk to 4 cups, and only 2 cans of cream of chicken.  I ended up adding about a cup of Franks buffalo sauce, which is my favorite.  To say this soup was a let down, is just the beginning.  As my fiance put it, "it tastes like cream of buffalo."  It was bland and boring and really lacked something.  Even after quadrupling the amount of buffalo sauce, this soup STILL lacked a real flavor.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Loved it!  I did add a few extras: Potatoes, onions, and peppers (hot and mild). I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I only used 3 cans of milk.  The consistancy was perfect, not too runny.

I've made this soup many times now and it always comes out wonderful.  I do make changes: instead of milk(don't always have it handy) I use water, and use a 2:1 cream of chicken:water ratio (I like it thick).  4.25 pounds of shredded chicken breasts, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of water fills a 3.5 quart crockpot.  I also use 1.5 tablespoons of Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce in the crockpot and put the bottle on the table.  It's a favorite at home and work.  Can be done stovetop as well with fantastic results.

YUM!!! I cooked the chicken then shredded it and cooked it with celery and the hot sauce butter mixture. I also only used 4 cups of milk but left everything else the same. Leftovers were even better.

This is awesome! I wish I could have the first review. I think i put a bit more chicken and used franks hot buffalo sauce. Plus I added potatoes and fried chicken in olive oil and hot sauce and then shredded and added to the rest of ingredients. I think i only used 4 cups milk like others said, but this is amazing! I love it, you're a genius!!!

This recipe is so awesome! Like the other reviewers, I cut the milk down from 6 cups to 4. I also sauteed some yellow onion and celery until it was soft, then added the chicken with some Buffalo flavor Frank's. I sauteed it all together for about five minutes so the flavors would infuse the chicken. I then dumped everything in a saucepan and just simmered all of the ingredients for about 20 minutes. It turned out nice and thick, it was an excellent texture. I used light sour cream and the 98% fat free condensed soups, so this recipe was pretty healthy and low fat. Yum!

We liked this recipe, but I took the advice of some of the others here. I used 4 boneless chicken breasts and cooked them in 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup of buffalo wing sauce. I sauteed 1/2 large yellow onion chopped, 2 stalks of celery sliced, and two potatoes cubed in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. Then I mixed them together and added 4 cups of milk, two cans of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery soup, 1 cup of sour cream and another 1/3 cup of buffalo wing sauce. I simmered it on the stove top for two hours. We sprinkled blue cheese on top of the soup and served it with a take and bake loaf of Italian bread. It was delicious, and we will have it often. Thanks for the recipe and tips. It is definately a keeper.

I thought this soup was great.  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I cook chicken ahead in butter & hot sauce to use for pizza/quesadillas (& freeze) so I used a cup of that. I had cream cheese to use so subbed for the sour cream.  Needed to use up heavy cream so put that plus 1 1/2 cups milk in.  I had only 2 cans cr of Ck soup so use a cr of Celery also.  It turned out just the right consistency with great flavor.  I think the key to this soup is you need to simmer the chicken with the hot sauce like another reviewer suggested and you will have plenty of flavor.  I'm going to try the bleu cheese butter on french bread with it next time as another reviewer suggested.  My next step is to see if this freezes well for my lunches so I don't have to eat the entire pot in a week!

Soooo good! Only used 4 cups of milk and probably doubled the hot sauce. I put 3 frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the crock and covered them with everything else. Took out the chicken and shredded about an hour before eating. I also added some red and yellow food coloring to give it that orangey buffalo wing color! Whole family loved it. Thanks!

My family loved this! We have been wing hungry, but not eating them because of the fat. I made this with skim milk, and healthy recipe cr. of chick soup. I cooked chicken breasts with some garlic, onion and hot suce in the crockpot, shredded them right in the crockpot, I also added some  more garlic and onion and threw it all together. Wow so great!

Read a lot of reviews and took all into consideration however it was still missing something. Tasty but still not where I would want it to be. Good starting point but needs even more.

THis is soooo incredibly good-  amazingly it is almost a perfect match to a white bean chicken chili that a local restaraunt makes.  I have tried many recipes that haven't even come close.  This one fits the bill and I wasn't even looking.  I may add white northern beans next time too.

Iused 1/2% milk and reduced fat sour cream- otherwise made as is.

I don't know what it was about this soup, but it just didn't hit the spot for my family and me. If I make this again, I will use Ranch dressing instead of Blue Cheese chunks.

The recipe as written is a ONE star, but with some modifications, it can be redeemed. We chopped up half an onion, garlic salt, chili powder, crushed red pepper, half a bottle of wing sauce, sifting in flour, and reducing the amount of milk. Even with these adjustments, it was just "okay". I wouldn't recommend bothering with this dish. It's bland and far from a satisfying.

Wonderful. Took other reviewers opinions and added sauteed onion and celery, increased buffalo sauce to 1/2 cup and was amazing.

This is a great recipe. As always I tweaked it to my tastes. I substituted 1 cup of milk for cream. It gave it a richer taste. I also added garlic and celery toward the end of cooking. I wanted the flavor, but I also wanted the celery to remain fairly firm. It was a HUGE hit with the family. Add more chicken and it makes a great dip.

Great recipe. I changed it a bit. Instead of 6 cups of milk, i used 4. I also used 3 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. Tasted great!!

Made a half batch of the soup today.  I used less than half of the milk and soup.  I also sauteed chopped celery and onion before I added the other ingredients.  I made this on the stovetop.  I think next time I will top the soup with a spoonful of sour cream when serving or I may try leaving it out.  I did not like the texture of the sour cream; it never fully incorporated into the soup.  Try topping this with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese.  Delish.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I was so excited when I found this recipe, we LOVE chicken wings and I've been in the mood for soup so thought it would be a perfect combination.  The recipe as written is bland.  It needs quite a bit more hot sauce, seasonings. And I wish I would have reduced the milk as other reviewers mentioned (there's way too much liquid and the dairy taste is extremely prominant) but I wanted to try the recipe as written.  I had to find a way to save the chicken so as not to waste it and will not make this again

I followed some other reviewers suggestions and only used 4 cups of milk. I put a dollup of blue cheese dressing on the top of my bowl and some extra hot sauce. I will definitely be making this again! Yummy!

As is, this was okay. I think this could be even better with homemade cream of chicken soup and a little bit of chopped carrot, chopped celery, minced onion and fresh garlic. Great way to use a discounted rotisserie chicken.

I thought this was a really clever, interesting recipe.  I had no idea how it was going to turn out, but it was great.  Easy to do, easy to adjust the amounts to make more for a party.  I added a frozen mirepoix mix (carrot, celery, onion) and topped the bowls with some blue cheese crumbles.  I think another great flavor may be a ranch dressing packet, I will try that next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

Made this soup and served it with salad and fresh baked italian bread. I leaned more to the thicker side. Less milk more cream of chicken and cream of celery. I beefed it up with vegetables and a hearty amount of chicken breast which I pan seared first in olive oil. Then pulled apart with forks and simmered in butter and hot sauce. The first day we ate this it was good. Then we refrigerated it for left overs. The second day, after the seasonings all blended, the soup was fantastic! I absolutely cannot believe how tasty it is. It's just like eating chicken wings. I made a hugh batch. Will have some a third day and freeze the rest. Wonderful recipe. My advice to all is to judge the thickness and amount of hot sauce to your taste. Thank you for such a great recipe. For anyone who is interested. I will make this again in a couple of weeks and post the ingredients and quantities that I used. Excellent, great comfort food.

I thought this was very easy and everyone really liked it. Kids too. I didn't have 3 cans of cream of chicken soup so i substituted it for cream of celery. I also used almost a cup of hot sauce and 1 and a half cans of all white chicken breast. I just forked through it before I added it. Very good!!

This is excellent!  I actually found the same recipe years ago in a slow cooker cookbook.  I found it a bit too thin, so I added chopped celery and kidney beans.  I like texture to my soup, so this made it fantastic!!

We have chicken wing soup at a couple local restaurants but this is better because I can make it at home (and its easy).  If you want to make it taste really authentic add chopped celery and top with crumbly blue.

I thought this had a great flavor.  It was a bit thin, but it is soup after all.  I only had two cans of soup on hand, so I added 3 cups of milk, the entire 1 cup sour cream and probably 1/2 to 3/4 cup of hot sauce to taste.  I also cooked the chicken in the butter and hot sauce as suggested.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good soup, but I made a few changes. I added some celery and let that cook in the broth while I cooked the chicken. For the chicken, I coated it in a seasoned flour mixture and browned it in oil. Then I added the hot sauce to the chicken and let it cook a little longer like that. Also, we like ours a little less "brothy" so I added in some rice - it really helped thicken it and gave it a little more substance. =)

I didn't think I'd get around to this recipe until fall or winter, but here I am in Chicago, where apparently mother nature is very confused which season it's supposed to be! I was definitely craving some soup and this recipe fit the bill; quick, easy preparation, and delicious! I made this on the stove top for convenience sake, simmering on medium-low for about 20 minutes. I did add a lot of hot pepper sauce (like I said, I love it hot!) and because it was just me eating this, I eyeballed the ingredients and adjusting the quantity as necessary. Great job Pat, this will definitely be in my regular rotation! (Once it becomes BEARS season though). :) Thanks!

This is awesome!  I quadrupled the hot sauce (we like it SPICY!) and it was fantastic.  Also added a can of corn.  Gave the recipe to someone else already.

Very easy. We added sauteed onions and celery and used lowfat ingredients. If making for a group, would recommend making as directed and serving with extra hot sauce on the side.

Add celery (or cream of celery soup instead of one can of cream of chicken), more hot sauce, and top with blue cheese crumbles.  Great!

This was ok for us, but I just felt like it was missing something. I don't know what I could add to fix that (maybe more chicken? maybe some potatoes? I really don't know) but it was just lacking something. And we love buffalo wings, we eat them all the time. Probably won't make this again, but glad I tried it.

Yum! Reduced recipe to 2 servings for myself and roommate.  Only used 1 cup of milk and lots of Texas Pete!  Grilled chick on George Forman then heated soup up on the stovetop. Topped it off with blue cheese crumbles.  Will definetly be making this again!!!

This was good.  Reading the other reviewers comments about how watery it seemed, I only added 4 cups of milk, and it was still thin, but good.  If this was made with reduced fat soups and sour cream, it would be a little healthier too.

Our classroom cooking class loved this- so did all the other folks who popped in our class to see what was cooking! We added some extra chicken soup to make more and garnished with shredded cheddar or blue cheese crumbles, it worked out just fine.

Pretty darn good.  It has the same snappy taste as wings, but it doesn't make your nose run. I'll add more hot sauce next time, as I like a lil' FIRE!

This needed a lot of help. I started with less milk, as others noted it was very thin. It was still very thin, and had too little meat. So I added more meat (boneless/skinless thighs pan fried in hot sauce with very little butter). Used low-fat/fat free everything. It was very thin so I added frozen okra, frozen zucchini, and diced carrot and celery. My bf and I liked it a lot in the end, and it wasn't too unhealthy once I made my changes. Remember to use hot sauce, not hot WING sauce, because the wing sauce is filled with oil.

Great idea, great taste. I mix it up w/cans of cambell's low fat cream of (chicken, brocolli mushroom, whatever). I don't really like cream of chicken's taste so might skip it in the future. I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese, also tossed in sliced celery and COOKED potato cubes. If you put them in raw they stick to the bottom of the pot. Played with the milk and hot sauce to my liking. Topped with a few ranch croutons. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.

This was absolutely awesome!! I did not make in the slow cooker-I made on the stove in a pot because I did not want to wait.  I used canned white meat chicken breast & I sauteed a small amt. of onion in butter.  Used one can of cream of chicken soup, half cup of sour cream, half cup of a bottled chicken wing marinade, 1/4 c. of half-n-half, a little celery salt, pepper & garlic salt.  I am the only one that will eat this (I don't have a stomach) so I have to make a lot of soups-this was fantastic.  I will definitely be making again & again.  TY Pat!!!

My boyfriend and I love buffalo wings and this soup was a wonderful adaptation.  I took others suggestions and only used 2 cans of soup and 4-5 cups of milk.  I also added a whole cup of spicy garlic wing sause and a few shakes of tabasco because we like it super spicy.  To add a little more to the soup I also added fresh celery and carrots to the crockpot.  Instead of sour cream I used lowfat ranch dressing.  This recipe was great and my boyfriend even went back for seconds!!!

Very easy, great taste. Served with fresh baked bread.  Easy enough to serve unexpected guests if you can make a quick trip to the store. Can be cooked on the stove on very low, it tends to stick if you rush it. Upgrades: Added the meat from a large whole roasted chicken from the grocery store along with the juice from the tray. Used Frank's Red hot - which is everyone's favorite hot sauce in our house. Give it a try, I think you'll be glad that you did. It will be a part of my soup collection.

This is delicious! I was experimenting to see if this will freeze well so I reduced everthing to 1/3 of the recipe.  I agree with some other reviewers, it could use a little more chicken, and I think I'll season the chicken before cooking and shredding it. I will definitely make this again . . . very soon if the freezing experiment works!

This soup is great.  I changed it up a little.  Added more chicked and made it thicker.  I have three children under the age of 10 and they liked it also.  Even came back for seconds.

Soup was good and I took some suggestions from previous reviews and added some additional hot sauce and used cream of celery soup for two of my cans.  I served it topped with crumbled blue cheese (which we all agreed it needed).  I also served it with mini shell pasta since we had it for dinner and some salad.  Don't get me wrong it was good but I have another buffalo dish that everyone thinks is way better so I probably won't make this again.

I did as other reviewers had suggested and reduced the milk to 4 cans, simply because we like creamier soups.  I also cooked the chicken in some hot sauce before I put it in the soup, and that added a ton of flavour!  With these 2 minor adjustments, this recipe was great!

Just have to say...this was amazing. I didn't change a thing. You could reduce the milk if you like it thicker. I thought maybe corn...a friend thought mushrooms...It was great just the way it is though. It didn't look all that great when I got home from work & looked at the crock pot; but I'm tellin ya...this is super yummy!!!

The original recipe I would have given 4 stars, I tweaked it the second time. I sauteed the  shredded chicken with some hot sauce, garlic & chopped celery. Then I added the chicken mixture to the soup mixture. Instead of 3 cans cream of chicken, I replaced 1 with cream of celery. Wonderful!

This was pretty good; it certainly was easy.  I'm not really a fan of adding canned soups to homemade soups, though, because of all the added preservatives and MSG.  Because of this, I probably won't make this again without modifying it to leave out the canned soup.

Made this last Sunday night so that my dad would have something to eat when he came to my house the next day to work on a bathroom project. He didn't show up after all - oh well, more for me :) I tried this soup myself and must say that it calls for a unique combination of ingredients, that, collectively, pair well together (even though they don't appear to initially...). I am not sure if I like this or not.... Immediately after unplugging my slow cooker, the soup seemed to be very runny/watery and didn't smell especially great. After sitting in the fridge overnight, it thickened up, but developed an unappealing film on top. I simply mixed the soup with a large spoon and it looked much more appetizing (I wasn't about to waste an entire crock pot full of the stuff for that!). I added a few blue cheese crumbles and a couple dashes of Frank's Red Hot wing sauce (the same stuff I used in the soup itself) to my bowl and enjoyed it this way. I think the addition of blue cheese is a must. All in all, I think this would be very well received by the men in my family, but I didn't care for it enough to add it to my regular menu rotation. I think it would be fine to bring to a Superbowl party so I'll probably do that. One note - I was afraid that the sour cream/milk would curdle in the slow cooker, but it didn't. The key is cooking on low. Try it! Thanks for sharing : )

Good comfort food. I added about 150% the wing sauce and that gave it a better kick while not being overwhelming. If you like spicy food even a bit, the amount in the recipe won't be enough unless the sauce you use is overly spicy. I also used about 80% of the milk to make it a bit thicker, and added some flour too, and it was perfect for me. Will make again, probably in the winter instead of a 95 degree summer day!

My husband and I did not care for this at all.  I made it exactly as written and we're big buffalo chicken fans - but it just didn't taste right.  Would not make again.  Sorry!

My family loves this soup and I love because it is so easy!!! I also added some corn and some frozen plain hash brown potatoes(cooked on the stove first)to the recipe and it was a hearty meal.

Suprisinly good - if you like chicken wing dip, you will like this.  I only added 4 cups milk - we like a thicker soup and I sprinkled shredded cheese on top of each bowlful.  My 3 year old son loved it & even asked for more!!

This definitely turned out better than I expected. Like other reviewers, I prefer my soup to be pretty thick so I just added the milk til it was the consistency I wanted. If I were to make it again, I would throw in some Blue cheese. Thanks, Pat! Nice recipe!

My husband, his friend, and my son loved this soup, but I didn't really care for it. To me it needed something...just not sure what that something was. But I'm sure I will make this again because my husband and son really liked it.

I love this; tastes just like hot wings.  It might be a little too soupy, but it was fine with me!

We love wings and I make lots of soups in the slow cooker. This was disapointing and we are not fussy! I added chopped onion and celery. The consisantcy was not good. It looked curdled and too thin. I removed the lid to help thicken but had to thicken it with a little corn starch. Added 2 tablespoons of butter and a dash of garlic powder to liven it up a bit. All of this did help and my boyfriends kids loved it! It was just a boring soup to me. Sorry....9/21/07 Trying this again! Really tweeked it though. Last evening I chopped chicken and added garlic and left in marinate over night. Chopped celery , onion and potatos. I used more soup and less milk. I will add sour cream when I get home, hoping that it will not curdle this time. If it is too thin I will add some flour to the sour cream. Lid off. Kids will be with us tonight and I'm looking forward to trying this soup with them again! Serving this with garlic parmeasan bread, celery and dip.

This soup was an interesting experience... I think it did taste like buffalo wings -- but the watery consistency kinda weirded me out a little.  I don't know - I didn't hate it, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I'll keep sampling it and see if I can get past the "weirdness" of it...

This tastes good for being canned chicken soup dressed up.  I use roast chicken from the deli, so it's very easy. I've made it a few times now, and once when I was in a hurry I put it on the stovetop.  All it really needs is to warm up, not to cook.  I use the larger amounth of hot sauce, and it really does taste like Buffalo wings!

Very simple recipe.  The taste was a little subtle and the soup was a little thin. When reheated, the taste came forward.  I will try a little more hot sauce and sour cream and possibly some cornstarch too.  Very good overall!

This turned out really good, I made it for my son-in-law who loves wings.  I did add quite a bit more chicken and a little more hot sauce.
