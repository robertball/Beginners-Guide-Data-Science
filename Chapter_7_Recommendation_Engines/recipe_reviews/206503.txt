I love the idea of using bottled dressing!  I have made this for years and used 3/4C vinegar, 3/4C sugar, and 1T of oil which works but the dressing is a nice shortcut.  I also had always used chicken flavor noodles but love the beef ones too.  Great recipe and always a crowd favorite.

I give this 5 stars with my changes....instead of using bottled dressing, you can inexpensively make your own dressing: heat in a saucepan over medium heat 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup vinegar, and the seasoning packets from the ramen noodles.(I use 2 packages of noodles). I omit the sunflower seeds. You can toss all together & let sit for 10 minutes before serving. Also you can make this a main dish by adding a can of chicken breast. SO yummy!!

Great! next time I won't add the crunchy noodles until I'm ready to serve the salad...they got a little too soggy.

Very different take on traditional cole slaw! I used a Sesame Ginger dressing which paired well. This can easily be adapted to your own tastes by either making your own dressing or changing up the "add-in's".  I used toasted sesame seeds vs. sunflower seeds. Overall, very good!

This slaw Rocks! My husband and I loved it! As others did, I used asian flavor Ramen because that's all i had on hand. Thought about changing the bottle dressing, glad i didn't. Used Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar. Cut back slightly on the sugar to 1/3 cup just to be safe. You can always add more if needed (it didn't). It was perfect!

When I was about 10 a small cafe opened up downtown, close to where I live. One of the first things I ever tried from it was a "pasta salad" my mother had purchased for me. I knew that it consisted of what looked like coleslaw and ramen noodles, but didn't have the slightest idea as to how they made it. I've searched allrecipes repeatedly, looking for anything similar, but always managed to come up short. Then I found this purely by accident the other day while looking for ways to doll up some ramen. THIS IS IT! This is exactly what I'd looked for. I did slightly alter the recipe, because I had chicken ramen, but it still came out beautifully! I also didn't have the specific nuts listed, but I did have a can of crushed mixed-nuts for Sundae toppings (cashews, peanuts, pecans), which worked wonderfully. This is an excellent recipe, and if you like slaw, you'll LOVE this! Thank you!

I used 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar & 1/2 cup sesame oil. I didn't use sunflower seeds just the almonds but I toasted them first. This kept them crunchy & gave extra flavor.

I think several people have mentioned using the Newman's Own Light Sesame dressing instead. This is DELICIOUS. I get compliments every time I make it and requests for the recipe. It's awesome.

This was great. A nice change from mayo based coleslaw or a lettuce salad. Instead of beef ramen, I used the Asian ramen. I chose to make my own vinegar and oil dressing, rather than use bottled (easy and way less expensive ~ 1 cup of olive oil and a 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar). It is sweet, but delicious.

I followed Peg's advice and used Newman's Own Lowfat Sesame Ginger dressing, but I used only 1/2 c. and 1/4 c. sugar.  These were the only changes I made to the recipe.  The whole family loved this sweet, crunchy salad.  Next time, I will reduce the dressing down to 3/8 c. and the sugar down to 2 Tbs., and I will crumble the noodles over the top of each serving.  That way, if there are any leftovers, the noodles won't be soggy.  Way better if they are crunchy!

Great recipe and very adaptable. You can toss in some frozen peas and sesame seeds. Don't have any green onions, use finely chopped white onions. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. Tray is right, it is great with ANY meal!!

Excellent and easy.  I used a sesame/ginger bottled dressing, and added shelled edamame.  Didn't add the ramen seasoning because I didn't want the sodium.  Will make again.

I usually use another recipe for this salad.  I thought I'd try this with bottled dressing, thought it'd be easier. When I got to the store I realized that "oil and vinegar" isn't really a type of bottled dressing.  So I took a stab at which one they meant. I used a balsamic vinegar dressing and it tasted not quite right. I think with a different type of bottled dressing it might be better as the ingredients were good.  I think in the future though I'll go back to making my own dressing.

I tasted a version of this salad at a shower and have been searching ever since.  This is it!  No need to make any changes, this is perfect.  I am supposed to be taking this to a party this afternoon but I think I may be leaving some behind :)

Love this!  I only used 1/2 Cup of the oil and vinegar and just added a few extra splashes of vinegar and added about a teaspoon of sesame oil.  Made with the apricot chicken....delish together!  (And my kids want it in their lunches!)

Was hoping for a little more kick - but did like the texture.  I added in some apple cider vinegar - a few splashes - helped me achieve the kick I was looking for.

This turned out just like I was hoping. An easy recipe to fix.  I used the suggested dressing and it was perfect.  I used too much so mine was a bit dripping in dressing, but I'm sure if I had done what the recipe called for I would have been happier.  

My husband has been wanting to find a recipe for this kind of salad for a while and he was very impressed with this one.  Definitely a keeper.

Yes, no leftovers here either. We had it with Spicy Thai Turkey Skewers and the family loved it. I followed the recipes except I used Asian Sesame Dressing. It was a big hit. Making it tonight for Mother's Day potluck dinner but tripling the recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for it, but it loses points for 1.) using a bottled salad dressing – I hate that weird tangy taste you always get from bottled dressing, 2.) Not enough ramen noodles, and 3.) instructions to marinade. This salad/cole slaw should be crunchy! If it marinades it all becomes much softer. My humble suggestion would be to substitute 1/3 cup red wine vinegar and 1/3 cup oil for the bottled salad dressing, add an extra packet of ramen noodles (oriental, not beef), and toss together the dressing and salad right before serving. It’s still good after it has sat, but it’s best served immediately.

Easy, no-fail asian coleslaw recipe that's tasty and filling.  Use the Oriental seasoning.  Best served when enough time has passed for the ramen noodles to become soft.  I personally, don't care to eat the coleslaw with crunchy noodles, it just tastes like uncooked noodles.

This dish is excellent.  I have made this before but loved being able to use the bottled dressing.  I made this recipe as written except I changed one thing because I am vegetarian. The only thing I change was I didn't add the flavor packet from the Ramen Noodles. It was wonderful without it.

Took this to a BBQ for something different.  It was so good, lots of compliments!  I threw some fried wonton strips on top for more crunchiness right before serving, and used the oriental flavored ramen.  I also toasted some sesame seeds and threw those in there.  I have been looking for a recipe like this for a while.  Easy and tasty.

I served this for a work potluck yesterday and I was bummed out. It was all gone! I was planning on have some left over! everyone raved about how good it was and today I gave the recipe out. Thanks!  I made it exactly as is but with oriental flavor instead of beef. Super easy and pretty cheap! I might make this again for Thanksgiving!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  There were a few things that I changed according to my taste such as using broccoli slaw, raspberry vinagrette(1/2 C.) and canola oil (1/2 C.), and I also added in a little bit of edamame and leftover chicken that I needed to use.  I was out of green onions so I simply used minced onions from my spices and this turned out beautifully.  I'm sure that the regular version is just as good.  I would recommend putting in the ramen noodles JUST before you serve this as another review recommended.  They get too moist if they are put in to the salad and then left over night.

Very good.  Next time I think that I will make my own vinagrette so that the flavors are a little stronger.  The next day I added chicken to the leftovers for a light lunch.  Tasty.

OH YUM! I've had this before but never made it myself. I used Newman's Own Oil & Vinegar dressing, oriental-flavor ramen, and cut the sugar to a little less than 1/3 cup...now my son & I are trying not to eat it before my husband has a chance to get home from work! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I made a couple of changes, but I loved this recipe!  Instead of using the bottled dressing, I used olive oil and rice vinegar, and added some ginger.  I also used less sugar than required, and it was still plenty sweet.

I have made this in the past but lost my recipe.  I was so glad to find another one.  I made a dressing with rice vinegar, oil and sugar.  I also added in some Craisins.  It gave it a little touch of sweetness.  It was a hit at the party!!

I prefer to use cider vinegar and I always add a dash of soy sauce.  I do pretty much everything else the same except I don't add green onions because I don't like them, but I've added celery for some crunch.  This recipe is always a hit at cookouts!!!!

Delicious!  My 16-yr old son made this and was looking very proud of himself for making such a great salad.  He followed the recipe exactly.  Saved the noodles for adding in 1/2 hour before serving and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Thanks!

Our family loves this slaw.  When our new foster daughter arrived she put her foot down and said "I don't eat coleslaw.  It's nasty!".  I fixed this for dinner one evening...She now eats slaw!  LOL ;-)

Very sweet.  I guess I was expecting something different based on the picture.  The seasoning made it brown (pic was green).  Overall I didn't like the flavor.  I won't be making this again.

Made as written. Loved it. The ramen noodles really should be added with the liquid and seasonings as stated. If you want "crunchy" add some of the toasted almonds and sunflower kernals just before serving.

Excellent!   A nice change from the Asian coleslaw with the soy sauce in it.   Not sure if I would like this one at first, but it was very light and refreshing.  I used a homemade sweet oil & vinegar dressing in place of the bottled and didn't add extra sugar.  I also didn't have the seeds and almonds so I replaced them with toasted sesame seeds.   Thanks for the recipe - will definitely make again!

This was excellent. I like it better after it has been in the fridge overnight, the ramen noodles do become soft, but the flavor really soaks in.  Instead of using bottled salad dressing I just made some from scratch (recipe from this site). I recently made this recipe again, but this time toasted the nuts and the ramen noodles and it was even better!

Great recipe!  I love this stuff and had been looking for a recipe for a long time.  It turned out a little sweeter than I remember but next time I'll just add a little less sugar.  Awesome!
UPDATE:  I think I must have just gotten a big 1/2 cup the first time b/c I just made this yesterday doubling the recipe & it was perfect!  I used a full cup of sugar & the entire bottle of dressing.  There is one little bitty bowl left, it was wonderful!  I guess I just got carried away with the sugar the first time!  ;)

Delicious! I can't wait to try the different Ramen noodle flavors. I used the chicken flavor. I didn't have time to read all the reviews before I made it, so next time I will omit the seaon packet, toast the almonds, noodles and add rasins.

This salad turned out great and I will make it again. I didn't use Newman's Own oil and vinegar salad dressing because at our grocery store it cost over $5! So I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 1 tbsp oil. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious and soooo easy! I've never been a fan of creamy coleslaw and I was responsible for bringing some to a tailgating event this past weekend. This was incredible. Not only did it suit my needs the crowd couldn't get enough of it. We had a ton of food and my dish was the only thing that did not need to be wrapped up and taken home...it was gone!! Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

This is the best!  I have made other Asian salads and this one taste the best and is very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly even using (Newman's Own) dressing.  I made it for a bridal shower at work and everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks

Excellent receipe!  It was quick and easy to make, but tasted like I'd spent a lot of time preparing it.  The crunchiness of the noodles was a nice surprise.  I used a small head of cabbage and half a bag of shredded carrots in place of the coleslaw mix since I like a fresher taste.  I also doubled the receipe and it made a huge bowlful!  Definately a keeper!

Fantastic recipe!  I followed it exactly except I did not add the ramen noodle seasoning packet because I was serving it to a vegetarian.  Don't think it was missed at all!  I also taste tested right after making and do not think it has to be refrigerated 1 hr before. Next time will put together right before serving so noodles stay crunchy

YUMMMMY. I love this coleslaw. Someone made it at work and I had to find the recipe on here so I could make it too. I didn't buy the almonds or sunflower seeds but it would be great with it. I used green onion in mine.... and just used equal parts olive oil and white vigenar.... GReat Great Great!!!

I loved this and I am still dreaming about having it again.  I omitted the sunflower seed (not a favorite) and used oriental ramem (my 3 year old like the blue not the red package).  All I could find at my store was broccoli slaw so I used that.  Sounds like a lot but the base was the same and it was delicious.  I did wait to put the noodles in until right before serving because I wanted the crunch.  This was so good and I will be finding reasons to make it.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I've made this for several years, easy, fast, and awesome flavor!! Great for barbecues, with ribs, steak tips, sausage, whatever. I use the Newman's Own oil and vinegar, but add 1 tbsp. freshly minced ginger, really makes the recipe pop!

This was easy and very good and I got a lot of compliments when I took it to a potluck.  I did wait to put in the noodles, sunflower seeds and almonds until just before I was going to serve it as others suggested.  I'm glad I did because there was some crunch to the salad still.  I do believe you could also wait to mix the dressing with the slaw very close to serving it.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is always a hit with my family. Sometimes I change up the type of vinegar/oil combos (I hardly buy bottled vinaigrette),  add sesame seeds, use peanuts instead of sunflower, nappa cabbage instead of regular white, etc. Turns out great every time.

Absolutely delicious! No changes except to use only about 2/3 of the beef flavor packet that came with the ramen. Refrigerated 2 hours before eating. Will definitely make again.

It doesn’t seem to matter which ramen flavor you use, this recipe is tasty and crowd pleasing! I used Kens lite Italian dressing and it came out fine but I prefer an oil and vinegar dressing whether store bought or homemade. It’s a keeper!

I made this with a few changes. Just a 1/4 of a cup of sugar and half the salad dressing. It was fantastic and will make this more often.

Delish! Love this recipe. Super easy and the flavor is WOW! I used a salad mix with bite sized kale, shredded cabbage, Brussel sprouts, and carrots. Still totally amazing!! I also added about 2 cups of shredded Angel hair cabbage for variety. Love loved the shortcut using Newman’s dressing. This was a side dish to our homemade teriyaki chicken! Thx so much for sharing this!

I loved this, so much easier than making my own dressing, so many of them ask for ingredients I don't have.  I had some Sesame dressing that I'd gotten at Costco, so that's what I used. I also lowered the sugar to two tablespoons, because I am not a fan of really sweet dressings, and that was plenty!  I threw in some cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Even two days later it's still very crisp and tasty, I don't mind if the noodles are soggy, the flavor is wonderful! Thanks, I'll make this again!

I was pretty happy with this with the following mods: halved the amount of dressing to 1/2 cup (used Paul Newman's Olive Oil and Vinegar, which worked well) and may even cut that down next time I make it; cut sugar to 1/4 cup; added some shredded carrots; used toasted sunflower seeds; used Oriental ramen packet instead of beef (because it's what I had around). DH is a PITA when it comes to fresh foods and he liked it.

Overall easy and tasty. Next time will try with peanuts instead of almonds and sunflowers, less dressing (got soggy after 2 days), and adding more veggie options (kale? extra red cabbage? sweet radish?) 

UPDATE: Made again using peanuts and cut dressing to 1/4 cup. Even better.

This is a great recipe I am sure but I followed Carmen's suggestion and made my own dressing with 3/4 cup of vinegar and 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 Tbsp of oil just because that is what I had on hand.  And the results were delicious.  Thank you, Tray_H  and Carmen.

It's interesting and one of few slaw recipes with no mayo, but it just didn't taste all that great and also felt a bit too oily.

Loved thus! Just like a side I had in the Caribbean this summer. Used Newman's olive oil n vinegar salad dressing and 1 1/2 packages of ramen and sauce. Loved the extra crunch!

Some guests liked this. Others did not. I thought it was edible, but I really was not a fan. Maybe too much dressing and sugar for me.

I listened to other reviewers and used Newmans Own Lowfat Seasame Ginger dressing, cut the sugar down to 2 Tbs and crumbled the noodles over the top of each serving so they stayed crunchy.
I don't like sunflower seeds so I added just the almonds. This was very easy and very good.  I used this as a side dish for Ahi Tuna.

I made this recipe- Really great! I didn't have any bottled oil and vinegar salad dressing, so I made my own adding white vinegar and olive oil, sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper and a bit of oregano. I also did not have any green onions so did without. I put in 1 head of shredded red cabbage rather than a bag of cole slaw. This is really good as a side dish or even a light meal! Thanks for posting!! Will make this often while our cabbage is coming on!

I have made other coleslaw recipes before this one became my official stand-by recipe. So I know that you should not add the Ramen noodles until you are ready to serve your salad. Also, since the recipe says to use Newman's Own Oil and Vinegar dressing, I recommend that you do just that. Substituting other dressings compromises the taste.

Made as listed and also tried recipe substituting the dressing with vinegar,sugar and oil. I think the vinegar sugar and oil option had more bite. Eat the slaw quick and add noodles just before serving

Just made this for Christmas lunch with ham sandwiches. I did not have the seeds and nuts, so I omitted those. I used sesame oil, rice vinegar and sugar for the dressing and added the ramen noodles and scallions. I like that it is safe to leave out since there is no mayo in it and it tastes healthier.

I added a bag of broccoli slaw for added nutrition and texture, as well as an additional package of ramen noodles.  Great, easy, inexpensive, healthy recipe for last-minute pot lucks or bbq!
