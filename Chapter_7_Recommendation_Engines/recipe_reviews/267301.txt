I thought the sweetness level on these cookies was spot-on!  Fig Newtons aren’t supposed to be cloyingly sweet .
My whole family enjoyed the cookies; even those who aren’t keen on Fig Newtons. 
My only change was I had to use almond meal/flour instead of crushed walnuts. It seemed to work. This recipe is going in the “keepers” file!

Good but not sweet enough
