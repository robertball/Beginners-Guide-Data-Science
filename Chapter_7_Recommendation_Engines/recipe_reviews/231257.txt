The quality of ingredients can make or break this drink for the individual. Godiva is a great chocolate liqueur and works extremely well in this recipe. Varieties of peppermint schnapps will allow you to taylor it to your own preference in regards to strength and overall alcohol content. I used Rupplemintz and Godiva in ours with a good 1/2 & 1/2. Get the martini glass really cold before adding the decorative chocolate and freeze again ( this is purely optional as you add chocolate syrup into the drink )

Not only is this yummy it is also very attractive. We topped it with a dollop of whipped cream to dressed it up even more for a more festive cocktail for Christmas tree decorating.
