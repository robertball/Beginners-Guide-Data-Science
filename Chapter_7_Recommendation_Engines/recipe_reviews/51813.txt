Since we tried this recipe, we've gone nuts with it.  Everybody wants to do their own little "packet" and pick their own vegetables.  Nothing gets waisted, everybody's happy and THE GRILL STAYS CLEAN.  We'll be doing this all summer.

I do this in the oven AND on the grill. If you get a seasoned or marinated piece of meat the veggies are even more flavorful let alone the meat. This is a HUGE hit with the kids and with me... I love the lack of clean up!!! Also... I think those over cooked potatoes on the bottom are delish!! Turn half way through cooking to avoid scorching. Mini carrots caramelize and are fabulous! Haven't had this recipe listed... but make mine fequently.

Sooo good! And surprisingly juicey!
I seared my chicken breasts in a pan first and than placed the chicken ontop of red potatoes and carrots. I added an onion slice ontop of that and than followed the rest of the recipe. 
I did cook my red potatoes in the microwave for 3 mins after they were chopped. I read other reviews saying their potatoes weren't cooked all the way through and that would solve the problem.
A total keeper! Thank you!

Everyone loved it. I liked the cleanup.  My problem was the potatoes on the bottom of the foil pouch burned.

I've made this/similar recipes by double-layering the foil and putting it on the outskirts of a campfire, on a grill, in the oven, and w/o the foil en masse in a pressure cooker.  I don't add butter to it, but instead add zesty italian dressing over the top.  Everyone I've ever served this to has loved it and has started doing it themselves.

Very good and easy.  I sprayed the aluminum foil with cooking spray to keep the potatoes from sticking.  I had no problem with them burning.  But, I made sure to flip the packet over so they weren't on the bottom.  The only change I would make would be to marinate the chicken ahead of time to give it some more flavor.

We made this on the campfire coals and it was a big success! Spray the foil. We changed the order from the bottom building up; Slice of onion(buffer to keep chicken from burning), then chicken, bacon, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, butter & also added Lawry's Garlic and Herb Marinade.

Used only 3 sliced peppered bacon; about 10 small varied colored potatoes; 3 breasts (that's what came in the pkg); a very large onion; and, 1/4 cup butter.  Also seasoned the breasts and browned first, while cooking the bacon somewhat to lose a little of the fat. Removed the browned breasts and placed the onion on the bottom of dutch oven, potatoes and carrots next, then the chicken, and finally the bacon on top before adding the diced butter.  Placed the lid on the dish and cooked at 350 about an hour, and then turned to 300 until dinner, about another hour.  The chicken was tender, as were all the veges and the bacon gave the dish a decidedly spicy flair.  There was quite a bit of "gravy" on the bottom, probably because the onion had cooked away to nothing and mingled with the bacon drippings and butter.  Easy and complete meal in one pot.  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of chopping the onion you can slice them medium-thick and make a "bed" for the rest of the ingredients to sit on. This helps prevent burning. Works especially well this way when cooking over a campfire.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  I only had to make one change to suit our taste - the only veggie we use is potato.  And, I usually make this as a casserole type dish in a 9X13 dish in the oven.  Everyone in my (extened) family now has this recipe and make it, too!  This is a definate must try.

I used some finely chopped garlic and rosemary instead of garlic salt and baked this in the oven and served it with some boiled rutabaga and broccoli.  This is delicious and soooooo simple!  I LOVED IT!

This recipe was delicious but I would omit the chicken. Chicken came out very dry and flavorless. I would follow the recipe for some tasty veggies and then grill the chicken separately.

This was great and very easy!!
I was out of foil so I stuck it all in a caserole dish and baked everything together. I did add some red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. I will make this again since it was so simple!

This is really good.  I made only a few changes for personal tastes.  My husband and I are both trying to watch our calories, so I omitted the bacon and butter.  I have no doubt that adding those would have made it even better (sigh).  Like many others, I boiled the red potato cubes for about 5 minutes to make sure they would get done.  Also, since the weather was bad, I put all the ingredients in a baking pan coated lightly with olive oil and covered it with foil, baking for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees, rather than grilling it.  I used chicken breast tenderloins (marinated a short while), so larger breast halves might take longer.  This was just very easy and we all liked it.

I found this to be very bland, although to be fair I did not have any bacon so I left that out.  It may be much better with the bacon.  I added salt and pepper and did enjoy it but my husband hated it and wouldn't even finish it.

OK... so I added a tiny bit of minced garlic, kosher salt, a pinch of sugar, pepper and rosemary to the diced potatoes, onions and carrots.  I sprinkled the chicken breasts with garlic salt, and then drizzled them with some of the bacon grease.

One idea is to make a gravy out of the drippings, but not at all necessary!  YUM!

Was very easy to fix and everyone seemed to like it.  I added new potatoes and finger potatoes and baby carrots.  Doubled up the foil and didn't have any issues with them burning.  Cooked it in the oven at 350 for an hour.  Kids like the idea that they can customize their pouches and will try some variations on the next go around.

These packets turned out great with no mess on the grill.  Just need to season up the chicken a bit before putting it in the foil and it is perfect.

I have two very picky eaters - I had them help make there own and they said eww gross - but when they came off the grill both kids gobbled these up.  We added garlic pepper to ours as the whole family loves.

This was a real crowd pleaser!  My family gobbled this up.  My nine year old son is begging me to make it again.  It was so easy to make.  I love the fact that this is a real one dish meal.

This recipe is wonderful. It was easy to put together and it tasted great. We did change a few things. We used real garlic in place of the onions and little red potatoes. We also added fresh mushrooms. We will be using this again on our next camping trip.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, except that I cooked it approx 5 minutes longer because we're at a higher altitude.  Cooked this on the gas grill and kept the temp at approx 400-425. My super-picky DH loved this, and asked me not to change anything the next time I made it (I have a tendency to experiment).  Next time though, for my packet I'll season the chicken with some Lawry's seasoned salt, and will go with with regular bacon rather than the peppered.  Hubby will still get the peppered. Sidenote on the bacon... I didn't fry it until crispy... just cooked it for a few minutes on each side so it was still limp.  I think that the bacon further cooking in the packet gave it a LOT of flavor that you might not otherwise get if you pre-cooked the bacon to a crispy state. I may try this using a mix of thighs and breasts down the road, and will probably also toss in a few mushrooms.  Fantastic recipe-- will go into my regular rotation for sure.Thanks!

This was so yummy my fiancé and I ate it two nights in a row!  I used green onions because that's the only kind of onions I like, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was very good!  I would recommend spraying the foil first so the veggies don't stick.

We LOVE this recipe! I've made it several times, both by the recipe and modified. My grill recently broke after being pushed over during a freak wind storm, so I had to improvise. Prepared as directed in recipe with these exceptions: For two pouches, I used 3 small red potatoes (parboiled for 1 hr), 8 pearl onions (blanched before peeling), two handfuls of baby carrots (thickly sliced), 2 boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins and 4 slices of peppered bacon (2 per pouch). Seasoned chicken with pepper on both sides before adding on top of veggies. Used garlic salt, lemon pepper, and rosemary for more flavor, then placed  peppered bacon and butter on top. Closed up pouches and placed in 475* preheated oven for 35 minutes. Came out perfect! Nothing burned... just juicy, tender deliciousness!

When placing the chicken and veggies in the tin foil, we added a little bit of the bacon grease for added flavor. I must say these are amazing. My family asks for them weekly.

Although I didn't like the flavor of this recipe, my son did..  I think the liquid from the chicken & veggies drowned out the flavor of the ingredients.  I DID like how easy it was to prepare, but I'd still like more flavor.

I have made this twice now, family really loves it.  I changed it up a little instead of regular potatoes I used sweet potatoes, next time will try both types of potatoes.  I ended cooking it in the oven we ran out of gas on the barbecue.  So cooked it at 350 degrees for  half an hour.  You would have never known were it was cooked.  5stars.

This was really good!! The chicken came out super moist. I did put the potatoes in the microwave for a couple of minutes to help speed up the cooking process. I also sprayed cooking spray on the foil and instead I butter I used olive oil. I also didn't use garlic salt, instead I used Cajun seasoning. I sprinkles that on the potatoes and chicken. It's a keeper!
