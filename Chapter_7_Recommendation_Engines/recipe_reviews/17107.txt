Tastes great, but cooking time needs to be adjusted.  Cooked it for an hour and middle wasnt even touched...it was still very raw.

I would have marinated the chicken in orange juice and spices first. The orange slice just wasn't quite enough.

Remarkably easy to make and extremely tasty.  I tried this as a last minute, something a little different from the usual recipe.  The whole house smelled great.  We couldn't wait to eat!  It took longer than the 1 hour stated on recipe but i just watched the pop-up timer.  The pan juice and drippings made the best gravy I have made yet.  You can't go wrong with this one.

I think I did something wrong, but mine did not turn out well. the chicken breast did not absorb the juice (mine was a bit watery) and the sliced oranges became yucky after being cooked in the oven.

Should have read the reviews first. An hour isn't long enough.

The prep and the cooking time is way off. I highly doubt prep time too me 45min for the few ingredients. i left the dish in the oven for 2 hours, not 1 hour. It's an okay recipe, taste-wise, nothing terribly great. It is easy to make, though.
