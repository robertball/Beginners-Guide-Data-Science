Hubs and I both enjoyed these a lot!  The pimiento is a nice addition, but I couldn't bring myself to add the peanuts, which just didn't sound appealing. Rather than steaming the beans I nuked them while I had the butter/soy mixture on the stove.  I didn't bother refrigerating it overnight and I don't see how doing that would have necessarily been an improvement.  Very pretty and nicely flavored.

Too much garlic, soy sauce is overpowering, and the peanuts were the worst thing of all. We tried this recipe because it sounded interesting, however out of a whole family of "we'll try anything" eaters-NOBODY liked this, absolutely nobody. Sorry!

I used fewer pimentos and about 1/2 the amount of soy sauce, and raw peanuts, to cut down on the salt content and they were still delicious

The family LOVED this recipe.  I used pine nuts instead of peanuts (because my husband ate the peanuts the night before!).  It was pretty, tasty, and perfect on the seasoning.  Great small of garlic, too.  Excellent recipe, thanks!!

The flavor of these over all was really very good.  I cut the butter, lemon & soy in half and still used more than 2 lbs of green beans.  Even cutting the sauce in half it was still too much sauce for us.  I didn't have pimentos so I used red bell pepper, diced small.  Hubby LOVED the addition of peanuts.  I have some left over sauce and will try it on broccoli tomorrow.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

Simple and pretty colors for the holiday table.  This was a hit for the whole family. Just wish there was a way to make the sauce stick to the beans.

This recipe is excellent. I used just 1/2 a cup of chopped peanuts and it was more than enough. Everyone raved over this dish and asked for the recipe.

Simple and great tasting! My husband hates pimentos but asked for seconds of this recipe! I didn't use soy sauce or salt, and added walnuts. I steamed the veggies in the microwave, and then heated the mixture in the microwave, so it was extremely simple to combine and eat.  Yummy, will definitely make again!

Not much different from ordinary green beans, but they looked pretty.

Beans were a hit at a dinner party! I believe next time I will use less lemon juice to uncover more of the garlic flavor. I doubled the amount of garlic. They reheat well as leftovers!

This is a great alternative to the canned mushroom soup recipe for green beans that many people use. Healthy, too. If you don't want to use the jarred red peppers, take red peppers, blacken their skins in the oven or on top of your gas range, cool, then slip the skins off. Adds another dimension to this dish. For my family because of garlic allergies, I sub onion. Dry roasted peanuts, salt free, and 
low sodium soy sauce can be used to cut the salt content a bit.
Delicious!

I tried this recipe last year for thanksgiving, and the whole family raved about it, So much so that it has become part of our thanksgiving meal every year now. The only thing I changed was I didn't use pimento peppers and I didn't chop the peanuts I smashed them up instead. :)

I love garlic and I loved this recipe!  Decided to leave out the pimentos but did everything else the same as the recipe.

We thought this was a different way to do green beans, but we substituted fresh red pepper instead of a jar of pimento it had a very good crunch factor with the frsesh red awsome bite with the sauce.

This was a light and flavorful dish!  So much better than the greenbean casseroles.  The pimentos paired with the green beens make it very festive.
