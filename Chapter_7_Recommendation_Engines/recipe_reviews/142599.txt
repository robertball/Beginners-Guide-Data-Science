I used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix and reduced fat cream cheese/reduced fat mayonnaise. I served this with kettle chips. This is an.......interesting dip. It's not bad but I don't know if it's something I'd make again.

I have been making this same dip for a while now and LOVE it. The one thing I add is 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.

This is good, but better with shredded cheddar in it (like Beer Dip I or Beer Dip II recipes).

Someone said they made it with reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat mayo and probably wouldn't make it again.  A fair comment if the recipe had listed those ingredients.  I probably wouldn't make it again either if I followed that recipe.  Please rate the recipe as written, not based on your own additions and changes.

This dip was not my favorite, was better tasting with chips (I was not a fan of just tasting the dip alone to see if it was okay, etc) Not a huge hit.  Probably will not make it again.

This dip was a lot better than I expected it to be. The consistency was perfect. The sour cream was a tad bit overwhelming to me but hubby loved it as is. It definitely gets better the longer it sits.

Easy to make.  It tasted pretty bland.  Tried it warm (not hot) and it tasted better.  I'll serve it both ways.

THIS is excellent !!!  I do use the Hidden Valley Harvest Dill flavor, and add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese...and sometimes a bit more beer, cuz as it sets up, it gets thicker and you need a really sturdy cracker or pretzel to dip into it...just don't over do it...cuz you want that balanced dill/beer taste...it's SOOOOO YUMMY !!!!!!!! :-)
