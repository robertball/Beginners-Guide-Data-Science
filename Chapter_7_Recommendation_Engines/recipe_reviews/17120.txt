I make another recipe very similar to this one so I incorporated some changes that worked really well for me.  I mixed together the soup with 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup lowfat evap. milk (or you could use regular milk), and substituted 1/4 cup dry sherry for the wine.  Then I sprinkled garlic powder and fresh ground pepper (you don't need salt) directly over the chicken breasts, placed the ham and cheese on each piece and poured the sauce evenly over the top.  I recommend preparing the stuffing according to the package directions.  It turns out really good this way.  If you do use dry stuffing be sure to mix it with some melted butter and maybe a little water to moisten it up a bit.  They will still be firm but after baking they will soften up.  Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake another 20 minutes.  I got a great result with these changes.

Easy and tasty. A whole bag of stuffing is way too much for a 9x13 in. dish. Probably half would do just fine.

I made this Saturday night and it was a hit with the whole family. We all like Cordon Bleu, but it's time consuming to do it the regular way. This was easy, fast and delicious!! I didn't change a thing in this recipe.

I make this for guys all the time and I swear it makes them fall in love with me! :) If you don't like the saltiness, buy low-salt cream of chicken soup. Also, it does need more time to cook so give yourself an extra hour or so for cooking time.

Very easy to make. We had company over to dinner and it was really enjoyed by both the parents and school age kids. Only made one addition to the recipe - I added about 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the sauce... I just love the stuff. I used rather large chicken breasts, so cooked my dish for a full hour.

I have been making this dinner and a quicker variation of it for years. Very tasty and easy. If I'm pinched for time I saute the chicken breasts in butter,garlic salt & pepper. While they simmer I make the sauce (slicing the ham into thin strips) while I boil a pound of noodles. Drain the noodles and lay them on a platter. Top with chicken breasts and ladle the sauce over the chicken. I either skip the stuffing or use the stovetop method to make it and serve along side. Add a green vegetable...we love brocolli and serve.  Delicious.

This was a very easy recipe and it was a hit with the family. Only modification I made was I used Cream of Chicken Soup with herbs. It gave the dish a little more flavor. Will add this to my dinner rotation!

Awesome!  Really Easy, Really tasty!
The only thing I would change is the salt.  No need for ANY!  The ham gives a salty flavor in some cases, and some of the herbs found in the bread crumbs add to the flavor too!

I thought that the recipe was wonderful.  It was quick and easy to make.  We had leftovers and the next night I cut it up and served it over rice.  It was even better the second night!

Made this last night because I had all the ingredients on hand. ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! Both 1-year-old and 3-year-old cleaned their plates! This was so easy, it will definitely be a staple in our house.   Here are my changes: I didn't have white wine, so I used milk. I also did not have garlic powder (gasp!) so I used 1 tsp. garlic salt and did not add in the tsp. of salt stated in recipe. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Great recipe!  I changed it up a bit based on others reviews.  Used fontina cheese, tavern ham, light sour cream & healthy request cream of chicken soup, along with all the other ingredients. I also added some cayenne, boyfriend noticed some heat and liked it even more!  He said he definitely wants me to make it again! Thank you for sharing!!

I changed this a little after reading the reviews but the sauce and the stuffing mix in this recipe really are good--  I soaked the stuffing in white wine before putting it over the casserole and i added herbs de providence on top of the cheese before rolling the chicken up and placing it in the baking dish  but my family really loved it!!

This was excellent! I actually made mine in a skillet with chicken tenders.1st I cooked the chicken in the butter.Then I de-glazed the pan with a 1/2 cp. of white wine.  I wrapped each tender with a slice of ham and topped it with a 1/2 slice of swiss cheese. I poured  the soup mixture over the chicken . I crushed 1 1/2 cps. of  some stuffing mix and added some garlic powder, pepper, and parsley and a little salt. I mixed about 3 tbls. of melted butter into the bread crumbs and sprinkled it over the chicken and soup mix. I baked it for about 20 mins at 350. I served it with steamed broccoli. I will definitely have to double this recipe the next time I make it. I only got one chicken tender and a little broccoli.

This is a delicious recipe!  The sauce is just yummy.  I had half of the bread cubes to the sauce mixture rather than putting all on top so they are softer - otherwise, all the bread cubes are too crunchy for me.    Have made it twice and my husband loves it too.

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious! Both my husband and I loved it!(though I had to make plain chicken breasts for the kids). I only made a couple changes but it would probably still be delicious just as is. My changes based on other reviewers: I added a couple Tbs. Of Dijon mustard to the sauce. Also I prepared the stuffing before putting on top. And I had to cook it for an hour instead of a half hour. Don't worry, the chicken doesn't dry out at all. And the whole dish really takes on the flavor of the ham. Great recipe! It's a keeper!

this was so good!  i did use fontina instead of swiss because i figured as long as i was mixing it up i might as well play a little and i adore the melting aspect of fontina.   also instead of a stuffing mix, i made my own croutons with a variety of fresh herbs (i grow them) i was heavy on the dill which i love and it was splendid with the mix of white wine and sour cream.  thanks so much.. i probably wouldn't have had it occur to me to alter my standard cordon bleu if you hadn't posted this recipe.

This was incredible!
I made it tonight, however, made an error.  I prepared the stuffing mix before reading the instructions!  Ps.  it came out great dispite my error.  Saves on the added caloric count that would otherwise be there from egging, breading and frying.  Thank you so much for this amazing recipe which was so easy to prepare!
Ps. I did add cayenne pepper to the sauce which kicked it up a notch!

absolutely delicious!  my entire family LOVED this dish from my 21 month old to my father.  The only change i made was i rolled them, pinched them closed woth a toothpick, and dipped them in egg and then panko for a crust on the outside because I didnt have stuffing.  Thank you for this recipe, the addition of sour cream was so yummy and made the sauce rich.  so different from other recipes!!! will be making again soon, especially since it was requested for next week while still eatting it!!!

Very good variation on a recipe I've used for years. Great for leftovers too. Next time I make this I will adjust it because it was very salty...and I love salt! I think I might just use Panko bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix and serve over rice.

This is one of my favorite recipes from allrecipes.com. I highly recommend this dish. I use white cooking whine, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, pepper and garlic powder and low fat sour cream. You need to try this one!

This was okay, but a bit too rich for me. The stuffing mix on top was too dry--should have used much less than the recipe called for. Even though I thoroughtly mixed the soup/sour cream etc. together, when I served it up there was clumpy coagulated hunks of goo in the corners--not appetizing!

Delicious! And easy!! Made exactly as directed, except had to cook an extra half hour. Halfway through cooking I also added a tinfoil cover to avoid burning the stuffing.

Really yummy.  I made some substitutions b/c I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Instead of wine I used chicken broth, I didn't have sour cream so I omitted that. I didn't add salt to the sauce because I thought the ham and the soup added enough salt.  Also, I pounded the chicken and rolled the ham & cheese up in traditional ckn cordon bleu style and dotted each piece with a dab of butter and then topped with the sauce.  I didn't use bread crumbs b/c my son doesn't like them.  Even with the omissions this was still wonderful.  I'll definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I prepared several containers of this in advance, and froze them before cooking.  Poured sauce over chicken and ham, then topped with Swiss Cheeze and feeze.  Thaw overnight and cook uncovered as directed.  Very good, and easy dinner for busy working mom.

This was a popular dish in my house, and so much easier to make than traditional cordon bleu.  I cut the recipe in half and used chicken broth instead of the wine.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  My kids especially enjoyed the stuffing topping.

This was ok, but not a favorite.  I did not have any sour cream on hand so I used cream cheese instead.  I pounded out 1/2 the chicken to cover the bottom of the pan and pounded out the remainder to cover the ham and cheese.  Covered all with the sauce and stuffing mix and baked it.  I have to be honest, part of this rating is due to the fact that I'm tired of recipes with campbells soup in them.  I'm finding that they are all starting to taste the same.

Loved it!  Thought it was so easy and soooo yummy!  The only problem we had was we ended up with thicker chicken breasts and they we still basically raw in the middle after 30 minutes.  Nothing that can't be fixed by pounding the chicken or adding more baking time next time.  Was GREAT for my company!

I love chicken Cordon Bleu, but never make it because it is so much work and so unhealthy.  I was easily able to make this into a light and healthy dish by using Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup, low fat sour cream, low fat ham, and low fat swiss.  You would never know it was low fat.  I didn't have any stuffing, so crushed garlic and herb croutons on top.  Also, I didn't have any white wine, but did have some cooking sherry.  I felt the sherry taste was over powering, but the amount for wine may have been appropriate.  I was very happy when my fiance said he really liked the dish though because it is so easy to make.  I will be making this again for sure.

Way to rich!! And I didn't even add the ham or cheese. The flavour was nice but it wasn't even good enough to keep the leftovers. I would not reccomend it or try it again.

Great, quick recipe.  The thing I like about this website is you can find recipes from extremely simple to very complex.  As for the previous review, maybe this isn't the website for them, they can find their recipe for a "proper" sauce elsewhere.  Thank you for the simple tasty dish!

This was a wonderful recipe when you're in a time crunch.  I used four large chicken breasts and baked it for 55 minutes.  Also, be sure to COVER the casserole with foil, otherwise the stuffing gets way too dark.  It tastes even better the next day!  Using both low fat sour cream and cream of chicken soup helps cut the fat.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to make this dish for Father's Day. The family thought it was good, but not as tasty as many other chicken meals we make. If we're going to involve this much fat in a recipe, the flavor needs to be worth the cholesterol. :). They need to come together more fully and be more distinct and savory. I think I will try an authentic cordon blue recipe next time, but this was fun to try.

This has become a staple in my house. I prep it the night before, and my 12 yo pops it into the oven before I get home from work. Add a salad and dinner is so easy and yummy. Some changes, add brocolii and mushrooms in the dish with the chicken, add onion powder to the sauce, omit the salt, and instead of stuffing I mix bread crumbs with italian seasoning and parm. I always make extra and serve it over egg noodles for lunch the next day. Because there is only 2 of us I use 3 chicken breasts cut into thirds, otherwise my son eats 2 full breasts and nothing else.

I would definitely pound out the chicken so that it can all cook evenly, but it was so good. I also used chicken broth instead of white wine just because I didn't have any and it worked.

I found this when I plugged in what I had on hand and was just pleased. We all love Cordon Bleu around here. I found some packaged, precooked chicken breast at Grocery Outlet a couple months back and stuck it in the freezer, for just in case. I used that here, with turkey ham I had leftover from another recipe. Instead of using whole breast and a ham piece layered on top, I spread the pieces on the bottom of my casserole dish, first the cooked chicken and then the cubed ham. Then I added the swiss, which I shredded, and then the soup layer. A little different than how the recipe dictates but the ingredients are all there! I did omit the salt, as cream-of soups do tend to be salty on their own. I'll update on how the family liked it after dinner. I will say that this came together quickly during the kids' Quiet Time. I threw the casserole together, covered it and put it in the fridge. UPDATE: My husband liked this, my kids did not. I tried a little taste and agreed with my husband that it was a little too salty. If I were to make this again, I'd make my own topping out of homemade croutons.

I made this according to the recipe except used provolone and prepared the stuffing according to the directions on the box before putting it on top. Also had to bake it for a full hour.  I liked how easy it was and tasted good, but I agree with the others who said it has too much wine for our tastes.  Next time I'll use half the amount so the seasonings in the sauce can be tasted as well.  Regardless, my boyfriend said it was excellent and wants it again!

My Husband loves Chicken Cordon Bleu, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  Man am I glad I did!!  This was great!!  At first I though there was not enough stuffing mix on the top as I thought it was supposed to be like a cassarole, but the stuffing is just a crunchy topping.  I would suggest making a starchy vegi and a green vegi to serve with this.  I did not find it too salty at all, but I did need to cook it 10 minutes extra - hard to tell if chicken is done from looking at it cause the ham is pink!  My husband said this is a keeper.

LOVED it!  I agree with many of the other reviews - opt for the low sodium soup and then salt to taste.  We used regular soup and it was definitely too salty on our first attempt.

Okay, but very salty tasting. Followed exactly only forgot white wine. This may have helped cut the salty taste. Thought it tasted better reheated next day. did mix some melt unsalted butter in with the stuffing as well as a bit of water. It would have been to hard and dry had I not.

Flavorful but the stuffing never absorbed the sauce so it turned out dry and crunchy.  I would recommend making the stuffing ahead of time and adding it to the dish 10 minutes before the dish is ready to come out of the oven.  Also, you will need much more than 30 minutes to cook, 50-60 minutes more likely.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom soup instead, and also used bread crumbs instead of stuffing, and baked the chicken at 425 degrees, since the chicken wasn't cooking fast enough. This recipe is a keeper

When this dish was done, I didn't taste either the ham or cheese. The outer stuffing was crispy, but the underside was gooey.  The sauce tasted fine.  I think that the problem was that the sauce overwhelmed the dish.  Maybe there was too much.  Next time I will make a casserole of cubed ham and chicken in sauce, with cheese melted on top.

This is delicious but I did have some trouble with the top of the chicken not getting thoroughly cooked, with all the stuff on top of it.  So, I put the chicken in to cook for 10-15 minutes while I am preparing the sauce, etc.  I have also tried making it into more of a casserole by cutting the chicken and ham into smaller pieces and my husband really likes that too.

Very good.  Quick and easy for a last minute meal.  I decided to make it a one dish meal.  Instead of eight chicken breast halves, I used four.  After the cheese layer, I topped it with a lb. of fresh asparagus cut into bite sized pieces.  Then, I put on the sauce.  As my chicken breast halves were rather large, I did cook it 50 mins.  It came out perfect and was a huge success.

I halved the recipe since I was cooking for just myself and my boyfriend. I also substituted cream of mushroom soup, chicken flavored stuffing, fat free sour cream, and chicken broth for the wine. I think it's more of a 4 star recipe, but he couldn't get enough of it. Plus, it's very easy, and you only need to wash a few dishes--always a plus! I still found it to be very salty, even after using low sodium soup--I think I'll use way less seasoning on the stuffing next time.

Very tasty! I have made a very simular recipe many times, minus the ham and sour cream, so I knew it would be good, but this exceded my expectations. I do believe I will add some butter/wine mixture to the top as I would rather have the topping moist than crunchy. I found previous reviewers comments about the strong wine flavor odd, as I could barely detect the flavor of the wine in the dish. Could it be possible they were using cooking wine or a bottle that had been open for a while? Cooking wine is nasty and should pretty much never be used, while wine that has been open more than a few days (even in the refrigerator) will start turning to vinegar, which would give a sour taste. Just a thought! I used fresh a bottle of cheepo chardonnay and it was barely there. Next time I think I will try some cheepo Riesling.

I was looking to make an easier chicken cordon bleu as I am not the most adept at rolling the chicken, and boy, did this really work.  Simple , easy, and very tasty!  I cut the chicken breasts in half and used provolone cheese instead of swiss.  Yummy!  Thanks!!

This is a wonderful recipe with just a couple modifications to suit us.  First I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the wine, then I sprayed melted butter over the stuffing before baking which slowed down the browning/burning.  Last, and probably most important, NO SALT.  For someone on a sodium restricted diet, between the ham, soup, sour cream, cheese and stuffing this is almost death on a plate unless it is modified to use as much low sodium products as possible.  For a restricted diet, this is definitely not a "cake and eat it too" recipe.

I am really glad that I read the reviews before making this recipe.  I omitted the salt and cut down on the portions before baking, and baked for a bit longer than the recipe called for.  It turned out very good.   I gave the 4 star rating because as it stands it needed some tweaking....but thanks for posting.

Very yummy, but I did need to cook it for about 50 minutes, not 30.  I also needed to cover with foil after about 20 minutes because the stuffing was burning.

I used low fat soup, deli ham, low fat swiss and low fat sour cream to make it a little less cals.  Used dry vermouth since I ran out of white wine.  No salt, and a little afraid about the bread stuffing burning but it did not.  I used stove top stuffing and baked it for 45 min.  I also used 4 big chicken breast.  My husband went nuts and praised me again for trying new stuff all the time.  We loved it.  Thanks for a great quick dish Jennifer!

Excellent recipe with only two minor changes. First I also spread dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the ham & cheese. Second, instead of stuffing mix, I heat panko breads crumbs in butter in a small saute pan and season with dijon mustard, fresh parsley, shredded swiss cheese and garlic powder.  Do not add mixture right away. After 20 minutes of cooking the chicken, I then add the crumb mixture on top and continue to bake until finished.  This is a staple in my house and make this meal a couple of times a month.  I always make extras as it is great on a kaiser roll as a sandwich the next day.

Recipe was great and very easy to make. The only problem I had, was that it took much longer than 30 minutes for my chicken to be fully cooked.

The only change I made was to not add the stuffing mix as I didn't have any. I read reviews were others used bread crumbs but I really didn't think I would care for that. And, this also took about 1 hour to bake. The cheese completely melted off so after I took it out of the oven I added another slice of swiss. The sauce was very tasty. The first night we had mashed potatoes and the second night I made rice. The sauce was wonderful on both. The chicken was also good.

This was an extremely easy dish to make. Most of the stuff I already had in the kitchen. Only suggestion I would recommend is preparing the stuffing mix according to package or adding bits of butter to the top. It seems like the dry stuffing mix browned alot quicker and almost burned.

This was really good and an easy way to make Chicken Cordon Bleu.  The only change I made was to use white grape juice in place of the wine.  Simple and delicious!

This recipe is amazing, and so simple. I used low sodium soup, and it was still a little salty, so I'll probably leave out the extra salt next time. I wrapped the chicken breasts in turkey bacon instead of ham, as I prefer to not use pork. I also read a review that said to cook the chicken for 15 min, while mixing the sauce. That was a great tip. Thanks for the recipe! We really enjoyed it :)

This is sooo easy to make!!! And it's so yummy too. I VERY HIGHLY recommend it. I shared the recipe with my mom, and she loved it as well, but recommended baking it for 45 minutes instead of 30, so that the chicken is very tender and all the flavors blend together really well. The next time I make this recipe, I'm going to try 45 minutes. This is sooo good and sooo easy to make - what a great combo!

I thought this was a good recipe. It is so much easier than rolling up the ham and cheese in the chicken. My fiance wasn't to fond of the herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing but I thought it was pretty good. Will probably make it again. Thanks!

A deliciuos and easy dinner. Great for a dinner party or to take to a house. I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain, non fat yogurt and it was great. I needed to cook it over an hour, and added the stuffing the last 20 minutes. This is now on my frequent meals list! Thank you!

Satisfying and delicious! I made this recipe with low-fat ingredients, and you'd never know the difference. I also added the following:I used paprika, pepper, onion flakes & garlic powder to season the chicken before I added the remaining ingredients. I added additional similar seasonings to the sauce mixture. I used Stove Top chicken stuffing, and prepared the stuffing before hand with 2/3 of the required water. This left some to absorb the liquid from the sauce,  but didn't leave all crunchy stuffing.  A perfect mix! I will absolutely make again! Served with instant mashed and peas.

Everyone loved this. If you are not sure about coooking with the wine-don't be with this recipe. It add just the right flavor and was not overpowering. Easy to make.

Great recipe.  I skipped the stuffing topping and used lowfat ingredients.  Even my picky eaters liked it.

We didn't expect much from this recipe, and boy we were pleasantly surprised with the end result. The only changes I made were: pounding my chicken to about 1/2", subbed 3/4 cup chicken broth for the wine, omitted the salt, and baked for 45 minutes based on other reviews. It was wonderful, and the leftovers were just as good a few days later. Thank you for a great recipe. It will definitely be going into the rotation.

Ordinarily I would not give 5 stars to a dish I had to tweak, but I couldn't give this anything but.  Before putting the chicken in the pan, I browned it in a skillet with butter, minced garlic, basil and rosemary.  Then, for the sauce, I used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. milk, and substituted chicken broth for wine, poured most of it over the chicken, and then mixed the stuffing with the rest of it and put that over the whole thing.  It was absolutely AMAZING!!!

Wow, this was great!  We all enjoyed this, and it made enough for a second dinner the next night.  If you hate leftovers, and have less than 4 adults eating this, you might want to halve it instead.

This was an incredible meal!  So easy and rich and satisfying!   I cooked frozen chicken breasts first and then added them to the recipe and they still came out moist.  I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, didn't have wine so used 1/2 cup of milk, and only used half a box of stuffing and it still came out wonderful.  I served it over brown rice.  I will surely make this again and again and again.

I cooked only two chicken breasts and cut everything down into quarters.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning and used chicken Stove Top stuffing on the top.  This dish was AWESOME!  I plan to use it for a senior luncheon that I am cooking for in the near future!

After reading all of the reviews ... made half the recipe ... VERY EZ to put together but not wild about the flavor of the sauce. Used chicken stock instead of wine but I think it was the sour cream I didn't care for - seemed almost tart. Sprinkled dry cornbread stuffing mix (added a little butter) on top and baked covered for 30 minutes then uncovered for 20 more. Will definately make again but use a little cream instead of the sour cream and maybe use Cream of Mushroom instead. I think this could be really good with the right sauce. 5 stars for the idea.

This is very, very good.  I left out the wine, added 1cup regular milk to the soup and sour cream,sprinkled the dry dressing mix over the top, put pats of butter on top and drizzeled a little water on top.  I also seared the seasoned chicken breasts in a frying pan to brown them a little before going into the oven.  The chicken breasts were big so I had to cook the dish for about 1 hour.  My husband loved it and I will be making this a lot more.  Thanks.

I just tried this tonight and my family is still raving about it as I write this review.  (I can hear them in the livingroom).  Everyone LOVED it!  I used individually frozen chicken breasts that come in a big bag.  I precooked them on my indoor grill, then followed the recipe exactly.  It was an easy night of cooking for me with great results!  The chicken was tender and moist.  It was really yummy!

This was just alright.  My husband and I both agree the wine should be left out.  Maybe be replaced with milk like others suggested.  I cooked the stuffing on the stove first, then put it on top of the "casserole" during the last 15 minutes.  I cooked it for a total of 45 minutes.  Just okay.  Don't know if I'll make it again.

This was fantastic!!  My entire family loved this....our pickiest son even cleaned his plate.  Quick, easy, moist, and flavorful.  Great for a fast weeknight dinner, but tasty enough for a company dish!  I did have to sub cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken...but still delicious.  I also fixed the stuffing (chicken flavor) according to the directions on the box before putting it over the chicken.  This is a keeper...will be fixing again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe Jennifer!

My trying a recipe for the first time philosophy is simple.  Go by the recipe the first time and then after that make any personal changes (if needed).  I wouldn't even know where to begin with this dish.  It was too salty, too much stuffing, the wine taste was WAY overwhelming (I like wine and made sure to use something light).  I've been with allrecipes for a few years and this is the first time that I've been REALLY disapponted with a recipe that received 5 stars.

This was a pretty good recipe.  My husband gave it 5 stars but I gave it four so really the rating should be 4.5 stars.  It was easy, easy, easy to make and the taste was very good.  I only used four chicken breasts but kept the other ingredients the same.  My husband couldn't get enough.  There are some other cordon bleu recipes on this site that I want to try.  They're going to have to work hard to beat this one for taste and ease.  I recommend this recipe.

This is delicious, and easy!  My husband and our neighbors are wild about this dish.  Try it, I'm sure you'll love it.  My husband hates swiss cheese, so I vary it by using 1/2 provalone.  Wonderful!

Delicious! I read the reviews first and decided to use healthy choice cream of chicken and reduced fat sour cream. I omitted the salt as well. I didn't have herb stuffing, so I just used the chicken stuffing I had. Amazing! I will definitely be adding this into our regular rotation.

We were quite disappointed in this.  Chicken Cordon Bleu is my husband's favorite.  I was so pleased to find this easier recipe, and particularly intrigued by the suggestions of how to lower the calorie content.  Unfortunately the flavors were overpowered by the sauce.  Where's the cheese, he wanted to know.  If I ever try it again, I will take others' suggestion and roll the chicken, ham and cheese together before putting it in the oven.

This was really good. I did make a couple of changes though. Sent my husband to the store to get Swiss cheese and he came back with Provolone but it turned out well. I also subbed seasoned Panko bread crumbs for the stuffing. It did somewhat remind me of the coating you would get with the regular Cordon Bleu that you would roll up and fry. I would definately use the Provolone cheese and the Panko crumbs again. Sauce was really good too.

This recipe is amazing!  I halved the recipe and made this last night.  My husband and I LOVED it!  I used only three chicken breasts (instead of four), but still used a whole package of chicken flavor stuffing.  I baked them (rolled the chicken breasts) in a covered casserole dish for one hour.  Everything came out perfectly!  Oh, I also used turkey instead of ham.  My husband told me to make sure I keep this recipe because he wants to make it for his family's Sunday supper sometime.. so that means it's REALLY good.  This recipe will be kept close and made over and over in our home :)

This is similar to a crock pot chicken cordon bleu receipe that I have made in the past.  This turned out good, although I did make a few changes.  I placed a piece of virginia ham and a slice of american cheese on each boneless/skinless chicken breast.  I used cream of muchroom, rather than cream of chicken soup and I used italian bread crumbs, because I did not have any dry stuffing mix.  It would have been better with rthe stuffing mix, but I was using what I had on hand.  Either way it was very moist and had a great flavor.

This was really good, everyone LOVED it.  I was short on time so I cut the chicken into small pieces.  Then I mixed everything together and covered it with the stuffing mix and baked it in a large baking pan.  The result was wonderful.

This was pretty good.  I thought the sauce was a good addition b/c sometimes traditional Chicken Cordon Bleu turns out dry.  Certainly I enjoyed not having to roll them all.  I gave it 4 stars b/c it didn't have quite the wow factor I expected and I'm not sure I'll keep the recipe since I only keep ones I really, really like.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it wasn't my taste.  It's a great base to start off with, but only after a few changes.  It had a VERY strong flavor, I think it was the combo of wine, swiss cheese and dry seasoned (I used Stove Top)stuffing. I made it again with less wine, less salt & garlic powder and no stuffing on top, instead serving with mashed potatoes on the side.  Thanks for the recipe, I like the idea, I'll play with it until it's more to our taste.

My husband and I both thought this was very good, but a little too salty. I used Better Than Bullion chicken broth instead of the white wine (since I didn't have any on hand) but that is generally not that salty. Next time I will go with low-sodium cream of chicken and low-sodium stuffing mix.

This dish was super easy! I used chicken tenderloins for a thin cut. Laid the ham and swiss on top and rolled. Used a toothpick to hold in place while baking. Covered with sauce and bread crumbs and baked for allowed time. SO easy and SO YUMMY! Everyone at home loved!

Update~Just had left overs for lunch the next day and I believe I would make a few change-ups next time I make this.  I would not use the stove top stuffing again--too salty even without any added salt from the recipe.  I will use panko crumbs and season them myself......Very good!  I served with asparagus for a nice combo

I loved this recipe. It is quick and easy to throw together. I did think the wine taste was a bit strong. Maybe because I used Sherry instead of white wine? Not sure it there is a difference. I think next time I will use chicken broth instead. I also forgot to buy the stuffing mix (which I wasn't thrilled about in the first place) so I just sprinkled a little bit of Italian Bread Crumbs over the top instead. I will definitly make this again!

This is definately a "good" different! It was very moist & savory. Great flavor! I used 1 lb. chicken breast tenders, cause that's what i had. Also used shredded swiss and herbed cornbread dressing. It turned out great!

Very quick and tasty cordon bleu recipe.  I used thin chicken breast to speed the cooking time and also nixed the salt because of the broth.  Will definetly make this one again.

We tried this recipe with and without the sauce mix, both were good, but were prefered the one without the sauce. We really like the stuffing on top. We used Stove Top Stuffing, and cooked it following the package's directions, although we used chicken broth instead of water. We let it set while layering the ham and cheese on the chicken then crumbled the cooked stuffing over the top. Also you might want to pour a little left over broth into the pan with the chicken to keep it moist while cooking. (if you don't use the sauce mix)This is a very good alternative with lots of flavor & we will make this again when we are short on time and can't make the Chicken Cordon Bleu II recipe from this site. (which is absolutely the BEST)

I really liked this recipe. I also changed out the wine for chicken broth and it worked out great. I poured 2/3 of the sauce over the chicken and used the rest to moisten the stuffing so it didn't dry out so much while baking. I served angel hair pasta with it and loved it!! My 3 year old did too but the others skipped the noodles...their loss!! Will use this again...thanks.

I wanted to make Chick Cordon Bleu but none of the recipes I found had good sauces. This sauce sounded great...and it was! Especially after some tweaking. I took a reviews advice and subtracted salt, added rosemary, diced celery and onion and used slightly less sour cream and it was phenomenal! I disregarded the stuffing opting instead for angel hair pasta. Again, wonderful. Finally, and this was the biggest change: butterflied the breast halves and put the ham and cheese inside as well as a slice of fresh tomato and a fresh basil leaf. I have added this easy recipe to my line-up.

I wasn't crazy about the stuffing topping.  I assumed it would absorb some liquid and soften, but instead I just had a bunch of croutons on the chicken.  If I make this again, I'll prepare the stuffing mix first, then put it on top.

I made this with turkey scallopini, black forest ham, and cheddar.  The sauce: 1 can cream celery soup, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2c milk, 1/4c dry sherry.  In the pan, I also added an onion diced and chopped celery.  I left out the topping as I didn't have stuffing in the house.  I found it super easy to make, all my guests ate every bit (including children), and it looked like I'd made an effort when it was one of the simpliest dinners ever.  Definitely will make this again!  Thanks!

This recipe was very easy & delicious. I did cut up the chicken into bite-size pieces. I didn't have wine & so substituted chicken stock. Serve it over egg noodles. A big hit.

My husband loved this and couldn't get enough of it.  I used low fat/fat free ingredients and it turned out really well.

We loved this! I added some Dijon mustard ( about 3 tblspns, but i love Dijon) as one reviewer recommended- I used the sour cream and only half the amount of wine...i added chicken broth to make up for the wine i didn't use..actually i used a bit more broth and it turned out great...Next time i make this i will prepare the stuffing as directed on the box ( i got a small box of Peppridge Farm herbed stuffing and it was just the right amount) and put it on top of the  chicken that way. I guess pouring the sauce over the stuffing would also make it moist. Also in the future i think i am going to make this more like a casserole and use shredded chicken or tenderloins , diced ham, - i will also use shredded swiss cheese again. I browned my chicken in a skillet before i put it in the baking dish, i cooked it with foil for 30 minutes and then without foil for about 20. This was delicious!!!!

This was so easy and really good! My husband really liked it. I used mozarella instead of Swiss cheese (that's all I had on hand) and it was still wonderful. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This was a lot easier to make than it appeared.  My boyfriend said that this is the best recipe I've gotten from this website.  He even asked to take the leftovers for lunch today!  I'll definately be adding it to my recipe box.

I didn't have cream of chicken, so I used cream of mushroom instead.  I found it to be very watery, but tasty.

**made this again and found it way to salty. Won't make again.

Simply great.  Guests fall over themselves with amazement on the flavor.   As a note:  On these recipies with the multiple salty ingredients I am always sure to use the lower salt alternatives to keep the saltiness down (ie low salt healthy choice soup and honey ham versus the regular).  A stellar recipie!!!

i made this a few weeks before the holidays and my family loved it and asked that i make it for our christmas eve party buffet.  there really isn't any need for additional salt since there is a lot of sodium in canned soup.  anyway, my family really enjoyed this dish.

This is one of the best chicken recipes we have ever tried, EVER!  We omit the salt completely, as it was a bit too salty even with cutting back the salt as suggested.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Next time I will do provolone (Swiss is a bit strong for me too) and the Stuffing mix I used had too muchSage in it...I am not the biggest fan of Sage - so next time I will use croutons.  The sauce is awesome!

Very good!  Different way to handle chicken breast, however just a bit salty.  Found 2 chicken breasts per person was too much.  Will definitely cut portions down next time to one per person.  Great company dish!

This dish was pretty good, not WOW. I would make again because it's something different then the usual dinner fare. My solution to the undercooked chicken-burnt stuffing problem was to leave the stuffing off and cover the baking dish and bake 20 min, then top with the stuffing and continue baking uncovered another 20 min. This worked very well. Also, I don't have any idea how anyone could get 8 chicken breasts into a 9x13 pan! I flattened mine a little to even out the cooking and 5 completely filled my pan.This is any easy recipe and worth a try!

This recipe was excellent!  It was a rich meal that tasted like I spent hours on it, when it really was easy!  However, the ext time I make it, I will reduce the salt.  With a salad it is a complete meal!

This receipe is awesome.  Very tastey and easy to make.  The only tip i would give would be to broil your chicken for 8 min. on each side them prepare in the pan with all the other toppings.  I found it took longer to bake than the receipe called for, but it may have been the thickness of my chicken.  This is now one of my family's favorite dishes.  I have share this with many of my friends.  Great job Jennifer

My husband and friend Claire absolutely loved this casserole with Jasmine rice. Both said not to change anything. This really surprised me since my husband rarely TRIES anything new and it is even rarer that he likes it and says he wants it again! Thank you for posting this fast and easy dish.

Very easy if you want Cordon Bleu and less work. I find the salt in the sauce can be reduced a bit.  I season the breasts. I also add a wee bit of dijon into the sauce. I served with boiled potatoes (sauce is lovely on them) and a side salad.

This was even more excellent than I knew it would be!! The whole family loved it. I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used monterey jack, and I sliced each breast in half lengthwise and then rolled a piece of ham around each piece, laid them in the 9x13, then followed the recipe as is. I used chicken broth instead of wine only because we didn't have wine. I crushed my stuffing mix in the bag before sprinkling it on, then I drizzed 1/4 cup of melted butter over it all before baking. It took about an hour to bake it, and I let it sit about 20 minutes before we ate to let it "settle" a bit. SO YUMMY!! All 3 of my normal picky-eaters asked for seconds.

skipped the parsley and salt, used chipped ham instead of sliced, and cream sherry instead of white wine. listening to others' advice, I covered with foil for 30 minutes, then uncovered for another 15. It wasn't bad, but the sherry was too strong for this dish. I'd give it another try but change that to white wine.

Really tweeked this one!!!  Tons of shredded cheddar to use up so that is what I used for cheese.  Added fresh minced garlic to the soup/wine/sour cream/parsley/pepper mixture and no salt needed as the soup is salty enough.  Overpoured the stuffing mixture on top (bulk from Costco) so sprinkled with a few tsps. of water and dotted with butter.  Very good!!!

Very good recipe...just skipped the salt because of personal preference.  I found the chicken was still raw after 30 minutes and had to add about another 20 minutes of cooking time.  Other than those changes, it was a hit with the family and an easier way to make this classic!

I tried this recipe to see how it would taste, but I used leftover turkey instead of chicken. My husband & I liked it.  So, after thanksgiving, I made another one for my mom & dad. They thought it was really good. Thank you for the recipe it is a big hit in my family.

Nope, this one did not go over well with my family.  Sauce just wasn't right, and there was too much of it.  won't be making it again.

Very good. I didn't have the wine, so used heavy cream and a little bit of chicken broth instead. Everyone loved it even my picky 2 year old - which says a great deal.

This recipe is delicious! I made a low fat version by using 2% cheese, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and fat free sour cream. I also eliminated the stuffing part of the recipe and served the chicken with brown rice instead. The sauce is very flavorful and yummy! I would definitely make this for company.

Very easy and tasty.  Only problem I really see is the saltiness.  I'm guessing it was my choice in stuffing that ultimately tipped it over (I used Stove Top Savory Herb or something like that), so either I have to try a different stuffing, or just reduce the actual salt added.

This wasn't an awful recipe but it does need some tweaking, I think.  I agree that you need to bake the chicken for more than 30 minutes. I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I wasn't too thrilled with the taste and texture.  The second time I pan seared my chicken breasts first and that helped with the cook time.  Also, baked as is, the breasts almost blanche.  I think the pan searing helps this.  I used low sodium stuffing mix (the recipe really doesn't need the 1 tsp of salt with the salt in the ham, cream of chicken soup and the stuffing mix the recipe calls for.) I, also, tried using a Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup and it was really good.  The concept of this recipe is great.  It just needs a little adjustment on the execution.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The stuffing and sauce is a bit overpowering, so I will keep that in mind for my side dishes next time I make it or change the stuffing mix to bread crumbs.  I did have to cook my chicken a bit longer as it wasn't cooked thouroughly.  Also very good if you substitute the swiss with mozzarella.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner for 2. It was very good and easy too. I did add a can of mushrooms to the sauce and a splash more wine. Next time I will bake a bit longer and put the stuffing mix on top later so it does not get too dark. My chicken was not done enough for us. I served this with rice and fresh asaparagus and cream puffs from this site for dessert. Great leftovers! Will make this again! Thanks.

This is an excellent dish. I pounded my chicken breasts to about 1/4 inch thick before putting in the casserole dish. Only other change I made was cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup and used 1 full cup of white wine. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and so much easier than traditional chicken cordon bleu !  We made it lighter by using fat free sour cream and lower fat / sodium cream of chicken soup. Also the stuffing i had bought was made of croutons which seemed to thick, so we used Italian bread crumbs instead. Great !! Thanks !!

I thought this was really good. I added some Dijon mustard as suggested by previous reviewers (Grey Poupon Country Dijon) and I really think it made the dish.  I also added onion, melted butter and water to the stuffing mix and then topped the casserole with it. I don't know how the topping would have come out otherwise, but I would certainly recommend doing it this way as the stuffing was nice and moist.  This was super easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipie, nice looking for a company meal.  I didn't have wine to add and it was still great.  However, it was WAY WAY too salty.  I won't add any salt next time.I thought the amt. of stuffing for the top was just right.

this is an excellent recipe for a family dinner served with Garlic mash and green beans.  We enjoyed very much.  But a word of caution for those that are watched salt intake.  The herb-seasoned dry bread stuffing mix made it too salty.  I would suggest not to use any salt in the sauce mixture or perhaps make your own breadcrumb mix thus control the saltiness.

Very simple and rich in flavor.  I did not use stuffing - instead I topped with breadcrumbs, and served with Baked Potatoes as a side starch.  I went light on teh Garlic Powder

I made this dinner as a special Valentine's Day treat for my family.  My husband, two teenage boys and I, give this recipe 5 big shiny stars!  The only thing I added was a few dashes of lemon pepper just to give it a little zip, but honestly this dish would taste great with only the listed ingredients!  Not only was the flavor fantastic, but it was SO easy to make.  The next time I have guests over for dinner, I will most definitely consider making this dish.  Very impressive!

The chicken and ham were nice, but I was thrown off by the croutons and sauce. While I can see this as a comforting dish, the sauce didn't have the depth I crave.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I did leave out the salt and baked for 45 minutes instead of 30.  I also baked the chicken without the stuffing for the first 25 minutes and added the stuffing for the last 20 minutes.  This kept it from burning and the stuffing was great and crunchy!  Thanks - I will definately add this recipe to my monthly menu!

This recipe was awesome, although some small adjustments are necessary. Cooking time needs to be increased to about 45 minutes, even with cutting the breasts into strips. If you want to cut some salt out, try using garlic salt instead of salt and garlic powder. I also added oregano and rosemary to the sauce for a little extra flavor.

I've been making this recipe for several years now.  It is the most delicious and interesting chicken recipe I've ever tried.  This is perfect for company....they'll always request a copy of the recipe to take home with them.  Leftovers make especially delicious chicken cordon blue sandwiches!!  Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

This was a great recipe.  My kids loved it...and they don't even like sour cream.  I decided to cook the recipe for 40 minutes instead of 30.  I also used crushed garlic croutons for the topping instead of stuffing mix.  Lastly, it was served over orzo past.  Very good.  Will make again on my kids request.

This is awesome and very simple to make.  I did find it a little salty, however...probably from the cream of chicken soup and/or stuffing mix, if I had to guess.  Omit the extra salt and buy "healthy" cream soup. This one is in my "keeper" file!  GREAT A++

The recipe would have been good if the chicken had been cooked all the way through.  It needs to bake for at least 45 min., not 30 min. like the recipe says.

This recipe is an easy, delicious take on cordon bleu.  It has become one of my favorite allrecipe chicken dishes. The only change I made was adding a bit of stock and olive oil to the stuffing mixture (I used Pepridge Farm brand) just to soften it up a little. Other than that, I followed the recipe. It is rich, but I like rich dishes. This definitely falls into the comfort food category. Serve with a salad and you’ve got a meal the entire family will love!

With all of the changes I made, I can't rate it more than a 2.5; however, it is a very good starting point for "pinch of this, dash of that" cooks. Here are my subs:
Cream of celery instead of Cream of chicken. 
Low sodium chicken stock instead of white wine. 
Cubes of ham instead of slices. 
Shredded Swiss cheese instead of slices. 
Cubed chicken instead of whole (half) breasts - even tried pre-breaded/cooked chicken tenders in one pan but the breading got pretty soggy. 
Seasoned the meat, in the pan that I made with raw chicken, with very little salt, pepper and granulated garlic directly - will NOT add salt the next time. 
Added about a quarter cup of Dijon mustard. 
Omitted any type of additional breading. 
I ended up making this in two 8x8 pans because I needed to take a meal to an elderly friend. I accidentally put too much sauce in his pan and not enough in mine but the next time, I'll leave about 1/2 cup of the sauce in the bowl because it didn't reduce as much as I thought it should even without the breading. The next time I'll also remove the foil a lot sooner in the cooking process and add some additional Swiss cheese.

This recipe didn't work for us. The stuffing on top turned out like croutons, they didn't soften up at all during cooking. The wine gave it a sour flavor. And it was a little salty. No one in my house liked it.

The only changes I made was to chopped chicken for faster cooking and cream of mushroom soup ( didn't have cream of chicken).  Way too salty for me. Wouldn't make again.

Made the recipe pretty much as stated except I only used 4 large breasts and used a coating of simply bread crumbs over it  & baked for about 40min........in my oven anyway. Times may vary depending on chicken size & thickness as well as how well each person's oven is temperatured.  I found it to be a good, simple recipe, great for weeknight cooking that the husband enjoyed as well.  Adding to my work night recipes. Thanks bunches!

My kids loved it, but it was kind of a heavy dish for me. I will make it again because it was a crowd pleaser but may try it without the stuffing to see if that helps.

One of our favorites now.  Only change I made was to use crushed buttery crackers tossed with melted butter as the topping.  Excellent dish.

Firstly, I almost never follow a recipe exactly, I always read the reviews & add or subtract depending on what the reviews say. I made quite a few changes to this recipe so don't feel correct giving it 5 stars  even though my whole family loved it. 
First, I cut up all the chicken & ham into smaller pieces so this was more of a casserole. Then I put garlic & pepper directly on the chicken. I used mozzarella cheese as that was what I had on hand. I added Herbs De Providence & dijon mustard to the soup mixture as some people said it was bland. 
We added some frozen veggies and prepared the stuffing with water, butter & onions before spreading it on top.
I then cooked it 30 min covered & 20 uncovered.
It was delicious. My husband and son ate it like it was going out of style! We will definitely make it again and again (with the changes). Thank you for such a great base & thanks to the reviews to help make it excellent!

Very good recipe. I followed Valerie Brunmeiers suggestion to prepare the stuffing as directed on the package and then put it on top off the casserole, cover it with aluminum foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes. I also feel like this recipe is very rich even though I used light sour cream. I recommend to go easy on the serving. A little goes a long way. Also, this recipe is great on rice and with some steamed veggies like cauliflower or asparagus and some bread.

It's was amazing. I added extra chicken broth to the sauce and covered it halfway through so the stuffing didn't get too crispy and dry. The whole family loved it-even the pickiest one.

I'm sure if I'd made this as stated in the recipe, I would have loved it! As it is, I used what I had available (live in the woods) and it was awesome. I did fix the dressing according to the directions before putting it on the top as someone said the dressing was dry. It turned out fantastic. Keep them coming Jennifer!

So much easier than classic chicken cordon bleu! Everyone loved it, but it was a little salty for my taste. Cooking time may need to be increased as well

Pretty good  and easy to make for the weeknight.  Hubby really liked it too.  Only change I made was to toss the stuffing mix with some melted butter, then used that as the topping - extra yummy that way!

I added a splash of heavy cream and a pinch of thyme to the sauce.  I also rolled mine up with ham and cheese like a traditional cordon bleu and then put cheese on top, as well.  It was FANTASTIC.  I had to adjust baking instructions to 60 minutes at 400 degrees.  And I used muenster cheese rather than swiss (personal preference).  This will be staying in my box of recipes!!

This was a very tasty recipe. Even my boyfriend liked it and he's not a big cheese fan (little does the family know it was swiss which they all claim they dislike) I didn't have enough sour cream so used about 1/2 cup of light sour cream and 1/2 cup of milk. I covered it with alluminum foil and cooked it for about an hour.  This helped keep the moisture in so the bread crumbs were not as dry as others spoke about in their reviews.  Also, when it was done I was worried because it seemed runny. Just let it cool a little and the sauce starts to thicken.

This was good and my hubby loved it.  The only thing I would say is that it was a bit too salty, so next time I will decrease salt by half or leave it out completely, and I would mush the stuffing mix into the soup mix a bit.  But very tasty and smells heavenly while baking!

WOW, was this ever salty!  And I'm a salt freak! (love salt) I made this recipe exactly, you can tell it will be awesome without all the salt.  I'll definitely make again, but will leave out the teaspoon of salt and maybe use low-sodium soup.  Will be a keeper with these couple of tweaks.

Another happy family. I had 3 quite large chicken pieces and pounded them a bit. I was out of stuffing but it was good anyway, and the leftovers were great the next day. Thanks!

Enjoyed this very easy recipe very much.  However, I did not use the ham.  I would agree that one may want to use a lower sodium soup for this recipe.  Overall, very delicious and easy.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish.  I cooked the chicken for a little over an hour and substituted creme fraiche for sour cream and it turned out great.  I used a nice white wine and could barely taste it, so I'm not sure what went wrong in others' dishes.  This was so good my mother-in-law was asking for the recipe! We will definitely make this again.

This recipe is so great!! I cook it for about 30 min. longer and omit the salt. It can also be frozen and cooked later. We LOVE this recipe!!!!!

One of our favorites. I usually make this dish for company. Rather than keeping the stuffing on top dry, I usually mix with some melted margarine and water to moisten.

Great recipe. We made this for two using the 1 serving recipe. This was perfect, but not much left for our dogs. We cooked it longer and didn't add the salt, but ended up adding salt at the table. Just loved it. Thanks.

This was very good and easy.  Even my picky eater in-laws liked it and took the recipe!  I baked it for 45 minutes, not 30.
