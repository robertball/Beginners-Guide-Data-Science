Made some significant changes, which turned this recipe into a keeper.  NINE zucchini???  I used two medium zucchini.  Do not peel them, (that's where all the nutrition and color are), but just slice.  Use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, and stir-fry the veggies in the butter rather than boil them, (again, to retain flavor, color, and nutrition).  Four eggs instead of three.  Rather than the cracker topping, I used my own whole wheat bread crumbs, with a bit of Italian seasoning added to them.  Delicious!  Oh yes...only bake 35 minutes.  Left-overs are fabulous.  I think this would also work well if you wanted to make double and freeze one to bake at a future time.

I changed this up a little as well. You can't possibly use 9 zucchinis unless they are small 'pickle' sized zucchinis. We used 4 medium to large ones and instead of slicing, I diced to about 1/2 thick. I used 4 eggs instead of 3, added 2 tablespoons of milk to the beaten eggs, and used a half of a cup more cheese. I crushed the crackers and used a little bit less than 1/4 cup of melted butter to give them a good crumbly texture. Added some Mrs. Dash to the mixture and baked as per the recipe. Served with a wedge of iceberg lettuce with light ranch dressing drizzled on top (and tomatoes if desired). Was a hit with my family! Even my picky daughter!!

I altered this recipe a bit.  I used boxed chicken flavored stuffing mix (the kind with the flavoring already in the bread crumbs) and used about 3/4 stick of butter to drizzle over the stuffing mix.  I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I used 3 cups of zucchini and added black pepper (to taste)  It's very yummy and my 7 year old even cleaned his plate.  Nice variation to the ordinary.

This was awesome!  I made a few mods, as others did- I only used one very large zucchini (there are just two of us), and I steamed the veggies instead of boiling.  I used 2 eggs, and added about 3 tablespoons of cream, but only about 1 tablespoon of butter. I only had saltines, so I crushed those up and added shredded Parmesan to them- made a delicious, crispy, cheesy topping! Will definitely make again- thanks!

I really loved this!! Ok, i am a born fiddler so we did some different things, 4 eggs not 3, a few red pepper flakes and a bit of broccoli i had left over and some diced ham.. you know a cleaning out the fridge thing.. It was a HUGE hit! I also used bread crumbs on top, not crackers - you use what you have on hand.. but this will appear again and again!

ok, I'm not sure how the recipe would have been as it is written, but I read the other reviews and sauted the zucchini first, added in some frozen corn, and a layer of sliced fresh tomatoes and then sprinkled the whole thing with extra chopped garlic, red pepper flakes, and parm cheese.... and it is absolutely delish! I only needed to bake it for 45 minutes too.

I have made this two times and always get compliments for it. I add Emeril's Essence (individual packets, about 1 1/2 packets worth) to the recipe to give more flavor. Very easy to fix. I agree about the zucchini size...they need to be small to medium-size zucchini.

This was just OK for us. After reading a few reviews, I decided to keep on the skin and sautee in a little butter...worked great. I also added corn and 4 eggs. This turned out tasting more like a breakfast quiche than a side dish for dinner...leftovers taste good too. I probably will not make this again.

This was just okay. I didn't like the textures of this dish; too mushy and the crunch didn't work with it. The recipe isn't very precise so I had to guess whether to melt the butter, and which way to slice the zucchini. I ended up following several of the commenters suggestions because they were more specific. I added 4 eggs, and ended up with way too much egg. I was hoping to eat leftovers this week, but I don't think this will make good leftovers.

for all those who changed the number of zucchini, the very small ones are definitely the most flavorful, and never  peel a veggie if you dont have to; thats where the nutrition is.  This is a great recipe with plenty of ways to vary it.

It was only 3 of us so I changed the recipe to 4.  That required 4 zucchinis which I used some small/medium ones.  I used 2 eggs instead of 1 and a 1/4, some cream but less butter.  Also I used cheezze its (white cheddar ones) as a crumble.  I left it in there until they browned and it was so delicious.  Everybody loved it and there was no leftovers.

I did add a few seasonings, after reading some of the other reviews.  I didn't peel the zucchini.  I sliced it and added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a bit of dill and let it set  over night before sauteing the zucchini and onions.  I didn't have enough butter crackers on hand, so I used a mixture of the butter crackers and Italian flavored bread crumbs  for the topping.  I poured melted butter over the crumbs.  The really weird thing is that when I first served this, my family Loved it.  My husband said, "well, after twenty years you have finally found a way to get me to Like zucchini."  Then, when I served the left overs, the next day, they All  complained that they didn't like it!!.  I ate it both days and thought it was pretty darned good both times.  I will be attending a potluck next weekend.  I think I just might make this again to see how it's received by others.  I have to figure out Something to do with the massive amount of zucchini my garden is yielding right now.  Anyway...if I get good responses at the potluck, I will happily increase my rating on this recipe.

I make this all the time and my husband, who has never liked zucchini, loves it. I usually cut it down to about 4 zucchinis, and just adjust the rest of the recipe accordingly. Plus, I saute the onion with a little garlic  in the butter and then add it to the zucchini.

This is such a great recipe!  The amount of zucchini should be adjusted to the size of the vegetables, but you can always tell by looking at it.  The first time I made it, I used a combination of summer (yellow) squash and eightball squash, because that is what I had in my fridge.  The boyfriend LOVED it, and took some to work to share.  Last night I used the recommended zucchini--but added an jalapeno for a little kick.  Perfect!  The only change I would suggest is the topping; and that is just because I prefer to use Parmesan cheese on my casseroles instead of crackers.  Only a personal preference.  Thanks for a great recipe that will get lots of use!

VERY GOOD!  Even my children enjoyed this dish.  The only change I made was I added about 1/4 cup red bell pepper and about 1/2 cup on parmesan cheese to the zucchini mixture.  We WILL be making this again and again!!

This was great!!!   The only change I made was to sauté the zucchini and onion instead of boiling it, then drained off the liquid before adding the egg and cheese mixture.   Definitely will be making this again!  (Used one very large zucchini).

I sauteed the zucchini (2 medium were plenty) and onions in 1/4c butter (not 1/2), I let that cool a bit then mixed in 4 eggs (instead of 3) and the cheese, sprinkled italian seasoned bread crumbs and baked it 30 min. then because it still looked wet I shut the oven off and let in sit in the oven for another 10-15 min. then removed from the oven and let sit a little longer and it was great. Overall a nice change and easy way to jazz up zucchini.

I did not precook the zucchini at all. I used a (huge) zucchini, sliced thinly with a mandarin. Mixed in 1/2 chopped onion which was browned in butter and 4 eggs. Then layered this mixture with 2 cups cheddar, making 3 layers. Topped with 30 crushed Ritz crackers. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes and let it sit 15 minutes. It is a soft casserole and does not stand up in layers due to the moisture from the zucchini, but  it was in no way watery, but just right.

I cut the recipe in about half since there are only two of us.  I didnt have the crackers, so I left out the onion and used french fried onions on top. It was pretty good.  I would make it again.

It's definitely not something that I would make again. My brothers and sisters thought it was nasty, and my parents were trying to be polite.

I followed some previous recommendations.   I had sauteed the zucchini and the onions.  
I had used more butter and eggs than the what the recipe calls for since I had a massive zucchini.
I plan on making this again.  I thought it made a great dinner and there is enough for another meal yet!!
Thank you for submitting the recipe.

So yummy!  I only had two eggs on hand and 1/3 cup of butter, and not really sure if I had the same amount of zucchini or not. I had two huge ones and one medium sized. Still turned out absolutely delicious and filled up my 2 1/2 qt dish.

This is great!!  I used three very large zucchini and bread crumbs on top, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Well, almost.  I used less cheese and combined some leftover mozzarella and cheddar.  It was yummy and I like it for breakfast.  Why not?  It reheats beautifully and makes a great side dish for dinner as well.

This is fantastic! Hubby & I LOVED it. I do think prep time is a bit longer than 20 minutes, unless you have a processor for the slicing & chopping & grating & smashing the crackers. It's well worth the long oven time & prep time! Thank you for a great recipe! Second time tonight!

I used 3 medium zucchini and followed the suggestions of prior reviewers, adding a 4th egg, panko crumbs, and a little extra cheese. I don't know if I did something wrong because it came out sort of a congealed mess. I would not serve this again.

I only used 3 med zucchini and I added in diced carrots. I boiled the veggies per recipe. I also added 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I baked at 375 degrees for 35 min. Delicious!! I also think the texture and richness would be improved by adding a little sour cream to the mixture.

This recipe was good, but for some reason it just wasn't near a five star.  I'm not sure why.
