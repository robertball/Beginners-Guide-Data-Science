To make the patty the consistency of sausage instead of hamburger the turkey and spices should be blended in a food processor with a little ice. Comes out just like commercial sausage patties.

I've been searching for the perfect turkey breakfast sausage and this is it! Finally!  Not only is it much healthier than store-bought greasy pork sausage, it's delicious too! The seasonings are spot-on. I did use 93/7 lean turkey and the packages I bought (Jennie-O) were 1.25lbs each, so it made a little more than the recipe stated. I think if I used 1lb packages of turkey, I might lower the salt a tiny bit since the 2tsp stated was perfect for the 2.5lbs turkey I used. Also, DO NOT overcook these or they will be dry. Personally, I think 5mins per side is too much. Thank you cathy35 for the great recipe!

I made this recipe while on a clean eating challenge, and I will probably never buy sausage again.  I'm not the biggest sausage fan because of the gristle or fat that can be in it.  With ground turkey, I know I'm not going to get that gross stuff.  This is definitely going to be a staple in my house.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly, just added a touch more of the spices.  SO easy to make!  I wrapped my sausage patties individually, then put them into a ziplock freezer baggie and froze them.  Just had one this morning with 1 scrambled egg, baby spinach and a piece of Provolone cheese on whole wheat toast for a healthy breakfast sammich!  Delicious!

I made it as directed, and made another batch with 1 TB olive oil & 1 large egg (slightly beaten) to it.  The batch with the egg & olive oil was more tender and juicier, although it was also stickier and a bit more difficult to make the patties.  We fried the patties, allowed them to cool, then froze them.  They were very easy to just pop into the microwave .

Have changed this up to be a hot Italian style for lunch sandwiches too. Added fennel, garlic, oregano and increased the red chili flakes. Flavor is very much of a good hot Italian sausage without the fat.

I cut the recipe in half. I had all the spices on hand except for dried sage, so I used ground sage. 1 teaspoon dried sage equals 1/4 teaspoon ground sage. I did increase the red pepper flakes just a tad.  Very tasty!  I will make this from now on.  One Very easy way to get the patties is to use an ice cream scoop then flatten out to a patty shape.  I froze patties on a sheet then put them uncooked in a bag. I cooked up frozen patties and they were just as good as the ones I made before I froze them.

I have made this several times now and it is easily my favorite homemade sausage recipe. Sausage is very flavorful but it's too salty for my taste so I cut the salt in half. Very flavorful and the best part is I don't have to worry about preservatives and any other ingredients I cannot pronounce. I normally eat it with sourdough english muffin, fried egg and Kraft Deli cheese. Yum!

I think my search for home made turkey sausage has ended. I used Jennie-O extra lean ground turkey breast (99% lean/1% fat) in the 1.25 pound package. I made this recipe as written for 12 servings with the exception of salt.  I used 2 teaspoons as recommended by LilSnoo. I also agree with her about cooking 5 minutes each side is too long. I cooked them for a little over 4 minutes until they were done. I thought the patties were very tasty. The next time I make these I will cut the salt back a little more being I thought they were still a little too salty. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I thought this turned out good. My only changes were cutting the recipe in half as I only had 1 lb of ground turkey. I also just did a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and at the very end added about 1 Tblsp of maple syrup. I just prefer sweeter sausage. I have found that if I use lean turkey, which I typically do, the dark and white meat mix works best for turkey sausage. It does come in lean also. For convenience sake I also made turkey crumbles and saut√©ed it in about a tsp of veg oil. It made about 7 servings, made as written here, at 100 calories each using 93% lean ground turkey. It worked well for breakfast burritos this morning.

We are making significant changes to our diet and have tried several store brand turkey sausages only to find them quite bland I tried this. It tasted just like breakfast sausage (it is much more dense than pork sausage).  The only addition I made was some Frank's red hot sauce, we like the hot sausage.  It is a keeper and will definitely make again.

This was excellent! I have high blood pressure so I shouldn't eat store bought sausage. I didn't have marjoram or oregano in my pantry so I used rosemary. For 1 pound of ground turkey, I only used 1/4 tsp of salt (since I have to watch my sodium intake) and I used a bit more red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp brown sugar. I followed GaryAtty's advice and put it in the food processor to make it the consistency of sausage meat. Loved this recipe!

These worked out really good for me. I added about a tablespoon of real maple syrup to the mix, after mixing in all the seasonings. Then I rolled the meat into little links (think brown-n-serve brand) and steamed them in a pan with about a half inch of boiling water, turning half way. Refrigerated, then pan-seared when I was ready to eat some. They came out really good. Thanks for this recipe!

I actually mixed this recipe with a homemade sausage recipe with pork. Same ingredients just half pork and half turkey and a tablespoon of brown sugar to sweeten the patty. Also reduced the salt by half. Next time I'll increase the red pepper flakes. Very good.

Have tried a good number of turkey sausage recipes, and hands down, this is the best!  Undoubtedly, turkey sausage is a compromise (at least for me, I'm a Jimmy Dean Sausage fan) for pork sausage and the texture is different, but when it tastes this good, it's a compromise I easily can make.  cathy35, thanks for a tasty and healthy breakfast today!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  However, the next time I will add a bit more sage and hot pepper flakes.  Froze some of the patties to see how they heat and taste after being frozen.  It isvery good recipe. One that Iwill make again and again.

I made only half the recipe. Only 1 lb of ground turkey. It was perfect.  You know exactly what is in your sausage. I used all organic ingredients. If I could give it 6 stars I would!

Flavorful, cost-effective and a good value. Added a little garlic as a personal preference. Otherwise fine.

The only thing I had to do was double the spices, NOT the salt.  I might even cut back on the salt a tad. But really good flavor.

I have made a few attempts at making homemade sausage and it‚Äôs never tasted quite right.....until now. This is the perfect recipe. My husband did not even realize it wasn‚Äôt pork sausage. We are cutting sugar out of our diet and all the sausages in the store have sugar in them so we decided to make our own. This will be the only sausage we will eat from now on.

This is superb! I will never buy store bought sausage again! Hubby, all 4 kids and I all give it 5 stars!!! Only change I made was because I didn't have dried sage and marjoram on hand...but I did have poultry seasoning. So, I omitted the sage and marjoram and added 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning instead and it was perfect! (Top cooked patties with some pure maple syrup for an even more decadent turkey sausage! Yummy!!!) Thanks for a new favorite recipe (already made it 3 times this week for my big family)!

I don't care for store brought Turkey breakfast sausage. So I tried this recipe and my children and I loved them. I substituted Italian seasoning as well. I even froze some of my sausages. Two thumbs up

So I accidentally butchered this recipe! Instead of quinoa, I used rolled oats. Instead of READING the amounts, I added whatever! Ex. 1 tbsp of tomato paste turned into the entire can! Etc etc etc. Surprisingly enough though, with all the mistakes I made the loaf itself was Delicious! Husband and kid both Loved it! In the words of Bob Ross "We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents!"

Great recipe! I didn't have to make any changes to the ingredients. However, I did use a  Ninja blender with 3 medium ice cubes to combine the meat and spices as recommended by another AllRecipes member.  Blending provided an excellent consistency, and the patties stayed together without issue.

I cut the salt in half and made these with ground chicken. Absolutely delicious! I don't feel the need to buy breakfast sausage from the store anymore. And I feel ok eating these because there are no preservatives!

Wow!  I expected these to be bland, but they are delicious!  The spices are perfect. There's no need to buy store bought fatty sausage when this mixes up in a snap and tastes so darn good. Thanks for sharing!!!

Make sure you use finely ground turkey to get the best consistency.  I also added a little Lowry‚Äôs seasoned salt to give it a more flavor. I think I‚Äôve cured my husband from ever wanting store bought sausage again.

Delicious! I followed other reviewers suggestions to put the turkey and spices in a food processor with a few ice cubes.  I have made it since without using the food processor method and it makes a huge difference in the texture. Highly recommend!

I didn't have sage or marjoram by themselves but I did have Italian seasoning that included them. Some folks said to double up on the herbs so I did 4 tsp of Italian seasoning.  A few said they were too salty and I know my bf isn't a fan of too much salt so I halved that.  I placed the patties in the freezer and cooked some today. I was so shocked at how juicy they were and how much they tasted like a beef pattie!! I also loved that extra kick of spiciness from the pepper flakes. My bf thought there was too much black pepper so I'll probably half that next time (Just his preference. I thought they were great.). Can't wait to make a new batch!!

This was exactly what we were looking for! We are trying to cut down on salt and processed meats.....this came out beyond expectations! Added some ice to meat mixture when in food processor, as another poster suggested. Worked great!!!

I've made these patty's several times.  Far better than any of the commercial produced varieties I've purchased.  They are great! and a healthy alternative to traditional pork sausage.

I will never buy sausage again. Used the regular ground turkey for the fat so it would not dry out, but I will use the lean ground turkey next time. I am going to make a large batch next time and freeze. I reduced the red pepper flakes and salt and increased the sage slightly (didn‚Äôt level the tsp). I also eyeballed the black pepper. It was so good.

I haven't made this yet. I am curious what a serving size is to have it equal the nutritional value. What size/weight do you need to make the patties? Any help is appreciated. I selected a 3 star rating because it sounds delicious. I will update the review after I can make it.

I used 85% lean ground turkey. This is an awesome recipe! I had no idea how easy it would be to make breakfast sausage. My family tried it right after I made it and they said it was the best sausage they ever had.

These were good. I did put them through the food processor with a few small ice cubes per another reviewer, but I found the consistency very soft. I think next time I will try it without the ice cubes.  I made patties today, but this would also be good browned up as crumbles for biscuits & gravy. The seasoning was great. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the ice cubes.)

It was easy to make. I especially liked the leanness of the turkey and the spices were superb to bring out a tasty favor of sausage without  a greasy mess. We will be making this recipe always as our breakfast sausage. Thank you!

I thought these were REALLY good! I like the flavor...my only moment is not cooking it with anything, I added a little water in the skillet so the sausage wouldn't burn and dry out. I also threw a few patties in the freezer for later.  I will definitely save and make this again.

Next time I will use more of all the spices. I only had one pound of ground turkey breast so I cut it in half I probably should have left it the same. It didn't have nearly enough flavor not terrible but I have 11 more patties to eat before I try to make it again unless I go ahead and use it in something else.

Everyone I have made this for has liked it. It's okay as is but I usually add extra crushed red pepper. We enjoy spicy!

Delicious guilt free sausage. I add a little maple syrup because I like a sweet sausage but that is the only change I make.

Very tasty! Made mine using ground pork as I was wanting a breakfast sausage without added sugar. Used Italian seasoning  since I didn't have marjoram. Also added equal amount of oregano to increase amount of spices based on others reviews.  Next time will increase red pepper flakes. This will be made again! Thank you for the recipe

Love this recipe!  I also used 93% gr. turkey and I really liked the addition of the red pepper flakes.  I fried a small patty first to check the seasonings - perfect!  I made 12 patties yesterday but when I pulled them out this morning to package and freeze, there were only 10, hmm.  Hubs just had to taste one and then another, just to make sure they were good LOL.  He gave them a 10!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, no more store bought in this house!

Just made this last night. Thought it had a bit too much salt, but otherwise, tasted great. Started making patties then decided to make smaller round bites that would be perfect for biscuits and gravy. I also used 1 pound of meat which I thought tasted perfect, so going to see how it'll taste with more meat but same seasonings. I'll be make this again. Thank you.

Nothing to change here! Made recipe as is and even my pork sausage loving husband really liked it! Great and healthier substitute to traditional pork based breakfast sausage. I used 93% lean ground turkey and froze the patties raw. Patties were formed roughly palm size and fairly thin. They did shrink and puff up during cooking, but were perfect portion size. Yielded about 14-15 turkey sausage patties. Excellent and quick to make on our cabin trip for quick breakfasts. Definitely will be making again instead of purchasing store bought. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have 1/4 teaspoon marjoram so I substituted with 1/8 teaspoon thyme and 1/8 teaspoon oregano. Also, I like my breakfast sausage a little spicy so added 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper. Turned out great! I ate a couple and froze the remaining sausages. Hoping it'll taste even better after the seasoning has thoroughly been absorbed into the meat.

i halved this recipe, as not sure what the results would be. i also didn't have any marjoram :( but wanted to make these! They ARE delicious! i will definitely make these again with the addition of marjoram. i found them a tad bit dry, but hey, it's turkey and healthy, so the little bit of dryness really doesn't hamper the flavour! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made it a little spicier and cut the salt in half but I think this recipe is the BEST sausage recipe I've tried! I won't be looking for another recipe :) It was SUPER easy to make and I am so happy with the results - I've finally found a healthier non-greasy homemade sausage recipe!!

Made them ahead for the week and reheated in water on the stove (I try not to use the microwave when I don't have to). DELICIOUS!

I found it a little dry, but soooo flavorful. One of our guests isn't big on spiciness, so I (sadly) eliminated the red pepper flakes.  Oh; I also reduced the salt by half. Maybe I'll add an egg for the next batch to see if that helps the dryness.

Wow, the flavour is bang on to your regular pork sausage! Thanks so much for this. As suggested by others I added some ice and an egg to everything else in a food processor.

Loved it!! I didn't have sage so I googled an appropriate sub and found that poultry seasoning would work. We don't typically eat breakfast sausages because they tend to be greasy but these taste like the real deal without the guilt. These will be on our "Breakfast for Dinner Menu" again. Thanks for sharing.

Yep! No need to buy breakfast sausage ever again. Followed exact (except I halved the recipe). 8-oz was used for my Thanksgiving stuffing, and the other 8-oz was used for sausage patties (with eggs and toast). Yep!

The sausage recipe I usually use is from a biscuit cook book and involves grinding your own pork and adding fat to it, although I usually use ground pork I get from the market. Even with the extra fat added, the ground pork I get is really lean, and the sausage tends to be dry. 

I had some leftover ground pork, (different store, more fatty), and was going to combine that with the ground turkey, but used all ground turkey instead when I tried this recipe. 

I have to watch my salt consumption and can't have black pepper, so I cut the salt in half, and used a lesser amount of white pepper. Instead of frying them, I baked them on a rack in the oven. It was a lot less messy. I have them individually bagged in the freezer, along with some frozen unbaked biscuits and they make a great breakfast together.  Even leftover biscuits work well. I microwave the sausage for 30 seconds  a side on High (700 watts) and it turns out perfectly. I really can't tell the difference between this and my pork sausage and it's not as dry and is a lot easier to make. I got 12 patties from 2 lbs. of ground turkey. This is now my go-to sausage recipe.
Thanks, cathy35

A decent substitute for pork sausage, it's not perfect, but much healthier. I will be using this for breakfast sandwiches from now on.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it is amazing! I will definitely be making this again, and soon. This is more flavorful than truly spicy, but I will reduce the amount of red pepper for my boyfriend, who is not the fan of even slightly spicy food that I am. Thank you for the fantastic recipe. I can't imagine a crowd this would not please.
