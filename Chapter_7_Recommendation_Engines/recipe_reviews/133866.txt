I made this recipe as stated with the only change being the quantity- I changed it to 4.  When I did the calculation it upped the brown sugar, but I left that at the original amount of one tablespoon.  This was good, not great and the flavor didn't wow me.  It came together easy and I had every thing in my staples.  I would probably give it a 3.5 stars.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good. I omitted the sugar because it was sweet enough already, and I used garlic chilli sauce as that's what I had on hand. This is a very customizable recipe - would work great with different meat and veggies. Thanks!

Loved it!  I made it last night for my wife and parents and they all raved about it.  I did however, leave out the brown sugar completely, and went a bit easier on the ketchup.  I also found myself adding a BIT more soy sauce after it was served.  Not TOO much though.  Also, if you're a hot sauce fan, you can't go wrong piling it onto this dish! :-D

My husband and I really like this recipe.  It is a take on regular fried rice, and really does have a Malaysian flavor.  I almost always use the vegetables suggested, but find that you can use a variety of veggies.

Very nice!
I too omitted the sugar and it turned out great.
The sauce also makes a most excellent asian inspired chicken when used as a marinade and baster sauce!

I can't stand the brown sugar, sweet chili sauce, And Ketchup. I think when you fry rice it should be fried, not just heated up in a pan.

I tried this receipe because I needed a fast and easy dinner the other night and I had the shrimp on hand.  I substituted bell pepper, mushrooms and snow peas because those were the veggies I had.  It was terrific!  My husband, who is a very fussy man, asked for seconds.  This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe, as suggested I left out the sugar. I also used low sodium soy sauce.  The dish was very dark in color but it tasted really good.

Really good! I also omitted the sugar as suggested by others and added in some scallops for a more seafood stir-fry and it turned out great!

Was a huge hit with my family! Will be making again. I used shrimp because that's what I had, but otherwise cooked as written.

My first attempt at fried rice and my family loved it!  Added some heat but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

This turned out very tasty. I took the advice of others that tried this recipe and 1) omitted the brown sugar and 2) used garlic chili sauce instead of sweet chili sauce. The recipe is still a bit sweet due to the ketchup (yes, ketchup...can you believe it?). We loved it and will keep it as a mainstay in our house.
Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

I add a little vinegar because it's a bit too sweet.
