It was gooey, goopy, goodness at it's finest. Normally I am not wowed by desserts with no chocolate but this was fantastic.  The top cake like layer glistened and carmalized into a heavenly crunch. All of the flavorings and spices were perfect. I will definately make it again.

Easy to make, pretty good flavor, but if I made again (though doubt I will due to the unhealthy ingredients)I would cut down the amount of sugar.  This was WAY too sweet for my tastebuds!  My husband enjoyed it though.

With a crust that melts in your mouth, and apples hot enough to burn your mouth (totally my fault), I though this was a wonderful recipe. It was esy to prepair and smelled divine. I believe I will be trying it with other fruit as well.

Family liked the recipe, however the apple filling was a bit bland. If I make it again, I'll add some of my own spices to the filling, or a different fruit. Eat with ice cream!

This dessert is sweet and creamy. We really liked the topping--crusty and crunchy and a bit caramelized. Serve this with cool whip or vanilla ice cream.  Very yummy.

I took this out of the oven 10 minutes ago and I resisted as long as I could stand it (about 5 minutes!  I had to make sure it was OK for Thanksgiving morning!)  OMG!! It MIGHT make it till dessert tonight.  The only thing I did differently is I used the apple-cranberry pie filling as my store was sold out of plain apple.  I cannot imagine it any better!

We didn't particularly care for this recipe--as another review stated, it was pretty bland, and the condensed milk layer made the entire dish look curdled.  Is definitely not what I think of when I think of a cobbler dish.  Might be improved if you use fresh apples and your favorite apple pie filling recipe.

This is a delicious, different type of cobbler. I love it, but I must say it is sweet! I made it New Year's eve. I served it the day after New Years. My guests thought it was a bit mushy. I wondered if maybe I shouldn't have refigerated it. Now, I am eating another piece almost a week later, kept it covered in the fridge in the casserole, and it is delicious, very soft, sweet, cinnamony and nutty. I think my guests are used to the traditional apple crisp and didn't give this one the chance it deserved.

One word: FABULOUS! I have made this for my family several times now and everyone just loves it. When I tell them I am making it, everyone is sure to be home and at the dinner table that night! I usually make it when I make a pot of chicken and dumplings. Yum Yum!

Very good. I used it with my own spiced applesauce (instead of the canned pie) and it was a hit. Next time I will cut down on the spices (just because of the already spiced sauce) but a good staple recipe.

I made this recipe for my daughters birthday - - and it was a HIT!..."Ooohh's & Aaaahhh's" Everyone raved over this recipe.  I used my own homemade apple pie filling (32oz bottle instead of the 21oz can) so it gave more body to the recipe.  I doubled the recipe (but not the sweetened condense milk) I served it with vanilla ice cream since it is very sweet, next time will drop the brown sugar to half.  Trust me, it won't hurt the flavor or recipe at all!  This is a KEEPER recipe!  Thank you!

The apple and top crunch of this cobbler was delicious. However, the in between layer of condensed milk with egg was strange - it had a spongy texture that was very unappetizing.

This cobbler is delicious and a sure hit everytime. I improvise on the fruit.. sometimes use canned fruit/simple syrup. I always double entire recipe and use a 13x9" panand adjust cook time. Definately a keeper.. :)

I thought this was very good; hubby doesn't care for apples, so he's not a good judge. Made it for a big Thanksgiving crowd, and since there were so many other desserts there to choose from, no one ate any of this. But, will try again next fall with hopes of better tasting results.

This was a very simple yet great recipe.  I forgot to mix in the melted butter, but poured it on top before baking and it still came out great.  And like the recipe said serve it warm with ice cream and it is even better.

This was my first attempt at a cobbler. Thanks for making it so easy and so incredibly yummy. All of my boys loved it, and I've actually made it twice now.  The topping was absolutely beautiful and delicious.  This will be a "Go To" recipe.

I was amazed to taste how sweet it was. As the recipe suggested, I had a good quality vanilla ice cream on hand, but I did not care for this at all. Will not make again.

I was craving apple cobbler but had never made it before. I always thought it would be too difficult so I never tried it. I can't believe it took me so long. This recipe was as simple as it gets and soooo yummy. I could've done without the sweetened condensed milk layer but it wasn't bad at all. I think I'm just not used to having it that way. I did add more of the spices both to the topping and to the apples themselves. I also made more of the topping because that's my favorite part. Give this a try you won't be sorry!

I made this X3 for a crowd.  I usually get lots of comments on desserts but got very few on this one.  It had a good taste, but the milk and egg layer seemed to give this a curdled look.  Maybe the large quantity should have been cooked longer, but the top crust was beautifully browned after 50 minutes.  I may try this again, if in the mood for cobbler.  The picture shows a square of this as if it were very firm but mine was more like a soft cobbler.

This turned out good and my family loved it. The only thing I did not care for was the oats. However, I think it is necessary for the topping to turn out right. Other than that a great cobbler.
