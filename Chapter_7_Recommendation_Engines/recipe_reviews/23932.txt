This was a little bland for our taste. With a little spicing up, it became darn good. First, I substituted finely diced celery for the water chestnuts, then added 1T horseradish, 2T finely minced sweet pickle and 2t dijon mustard. It was good, but when I made it the following time, I substituted Cream of Tomato soup for the mushroom, substituted celery for chestnuts, and once again added the horseradish and sweet pickle. My friends and family preferred it made with tomato soup.

This was a really quick & easy recipe, but I would not waste good shrimp on it!  There is just no flavor to the recipe, I tried adding different spice which helped, but it took a while to doctor it up.

A very good recipe, just needs a little spicing up.  I added 2 Tbs of southwest seasoning and that made a huge difference.  I'm thinking about trying tabasco next time.  Also, I used the small canned shrimp you find in the international food aisle, made prep time a lot easier.  Better on day 2, so I make it the night before a gathering.

Although this is a good recipe, it needed punching up.  I added 2 teaspoons of Old Bay Seasoning.  More could easily be added.

This recipe received rave reviews and requests at Thanksgiving with family and at the office among staff members. It's crunchy/creamy and delicious just the way it is--and it's quick to put together.

Perfect! Finally! I think this is the 4th seafood salad recipe I've made in the last couple of months and this one is wonderful -- perfect consistancy and yummy taste. On crackers or a sub this awesome!!!!

Wonderful! This is a very creamy, smooth dip. I tried rolling it in chopped nuts after it has set for an extra dash of pizazz. A great recipe for supermarket shrimp and fresh vegetables.

I made this for the most recent Super Bowl party.  It sure makes A LOT!  Everyone said they liked it but I still brought half of it home so I'm wondering how much they really liked it!?  I added 3 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning (as someone had suggested) and I think it added a lot to the taste.  Not sure if I would make it again, though since I brought so much back home.

I love this dip.  I have been making a variation of it for years.  I had fresh crab so that is what I used instead of shrimp.  I also added about 3/4 cup of light mayonnaise to the mixture and it turns out perfectly.  Always gets rave reviews.

This recipe was just OK for me.  It seemed pretty bland even though I used a flavoured cream cheese.  It seems to need something to perk up the flavour ... perhaps some cocktail sauce or hot sauce.

This is the best. I use canned crab (the good stuff) and a few dashes of worcestershire.  It is a huge hit wherever I take it.  I serve with Melba crackers- the extra crunch is a nice compliment to this dip.
