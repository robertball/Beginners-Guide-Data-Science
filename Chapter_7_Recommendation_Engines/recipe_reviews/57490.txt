I ALMOST followed the directions......I think that water has no flavor, so I used chicken broth instead of the plain water. This soup freezes well and makes enough to share with a neighbor. Really tasty!

I didn't have any fresh cayenne peppers so I just added cayenne pepper the spice.  Looking at this recipe it didn't have any other spices but cayenne so I added, thyme, oregano, basil,  and bay leaves.  Also, I didn't understand why no salt and pepper were listed so I added some of that too.  All in all the recipe turned out well and was very flavorful.  I'm freezing to save some for later and I'm sure the flavors will become stronger.

This recipe was a bust, and I would not make it again. I would substitute tomato juice and/or chicken broth for the 3 c of water. I had to add an additional large can of tomatoes to get any flavour to the dish besides watery jalapeno. I tried to follow another reviewer's advice of adding other herbs, but this thing was just bland. Oh, and I would use whole Okra, because the chopped okra get slimy (and are a disturbing grey color inside)

I first have to apologize for making a few substitutions.  I made this for my fathers birthday and he said chicken in a gumbo sounded odd, so he asked for beef sausage instead.  Also, there were no fresh cayenne peppers at the store so I used 3 small dried red colored peppers (very spicy).  Over all this had a great flavor with the perfect amount of spice.  Even my mom and sister, who don't like spicy foods, really enjoyed this gumbo.  I will no doubt make this again and again, but may not cook the okra quite so long.

Very good and very filling.  I've made this many times and have tried adding different ingredients each time, my favorite one being andouille sausage.  It's very versatile and best of all, easy and fast to prepare.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I was looking for some new ways to use okra.  This was just OK--nothing special.

This was just okay.  We don't like really spicy foods so I didn't add the cayenne peppers.  I thought the tomatoes with green chilis would spice it up a little but I think the okra overpowered it.  If I made it again I would use less okra, maybe half, and cook the chicken with the bacon and onions and then add the okra already thawed so it wouldn't have to cook so long. Not sure what gives it the unusual gray coloring but it didn't affect the taste.

Looks like this recipe hasn't been getting any love lately.  Youngest decided she wanted to try gumbo, so I let her choose the recipe knowing she couldn't choose any with shrimp (allergies).  She chose this one.  I will say it was a big hit in this family.  The only change I made was to use powdered cayenne pepper as I didn't buy cayenne peppers.  If you don't like spice, I would definitely omit this.  Oh and I reduced the amount of okra only because I didn't have enough on hand.  I would probably make it with just 16 ounces of okra the next time anyway.
