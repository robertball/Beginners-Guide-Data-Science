My favorite part is how to cook the lentils and the bulgur in ONE pot!  Aside from that, it is a good template for many different combinations of vegetables and always tasty.

the instructions for cooking the lentils and bulgur is priceless!  I did not cook the garlic and veggies because I prefer them raw, but the combination of all create a very flavorful dish.  Thanks.

Thought this was pretty good. I am not a fan of legumes, but have been trying to find ways of sneaking them into my diet. The balsamic gives this a good flavor, but I think next time I would use a greater ratio of vegetables to lentils.

This is good but needs something- fresh herbs probably like raw parsley or cilantro and more veggies. Iâ€™m thinking the reviewer who prefers the tomatoes and garlic raw may be on to something.
