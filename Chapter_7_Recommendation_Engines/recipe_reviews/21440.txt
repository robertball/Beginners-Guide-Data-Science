I changed lots of things in this recipe, and loved it!  First, I sauteed one onion and 4 garlic cloves on a pot.  I added one large green pepper, a stalk of celery, and a can of tomatoes.  To this I added 3/4 cup of rice, and one cup of water.  i added two cans of tuna to the mixture.  I added a dash of mustard seed, some thyme, some basil, and ground pepper.  I let everything simmer for about 40 mins, untill it not longer looked like soup.  I served it in a pasta bowl, sprinkled with ground pepper to taste, and salt, and shredded old cheddar cheese.  YUM!!!  just remember you need lots of pepper!

I took someone's suggestion and substituted Uncle Ben's wild rice and then someone else suggested sauteing the onion and garlic first. It turned out pretty well and the kids loved it.

never would have imagined this would be good --so, basically followed the recipe, used brown rice though, and cooked it in veg broth and garlic, then added tuna, dried onion and tomatoes from my garden - maybe used a little more mozz than called for. also added a bit of johnnys doc - its a tacoma thing but lawrys is similar - seriously delicious. weird, granted, but delicious.

Ya know, I don't like to waste food and I'm not a picky eater, but I couldn't finish this.  Something just wasn't right...neither eye appeal, scent, texture or flavor.  I do enjoy trying new things, but this is one of the few to scratch off the list.

Something just wasn't right about this one.  I don't think tuna and rice belong with tomatoes.  We had trouble finishing it, and I won't make it again.

This was not a bad meal it was just boring. There was not much flavor. I even flavored my rice using chicken boullon cubes. I cooked the garlic and onions before hand in a little olive oil and basil, I also added lots of salt and pepper. It was pretty boring and I will not make this recipe again.

Great for a quick & easy meal right out of the pantry.  Substitute white instant rice for chicken flavor Rice-A-Roni.  Yum!

I was in the mood for a tuna salad/casserole, but because of allergies I can't eat egg, dairy or pasta. This was a decent alternative. I did make a few adjustments. I made brown rice with garlic powder then added salt. I layered the following: 1/2 of rice, half a sauteed onion, a can of hunt's fire roasted tomatoes w garlic, tuna, lots of moz cheese, rest of rice and a little more salt and garlic (i like garlic). I'll probably make this again, but with and entire sauteed onion.

Rice was WAY undercooked after following directions completely.  I didn't think that was enough time for it to cook. Had to toss it.  TERRIBLE!

The rice was under cooked and I followed the directions completely. Maybe it is my stove. 
I would recommend using less pepper.
