A little bit too lemoney and too thin.  I'd decrease the lemon and I'd reccomend adding two teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Good start!

I usually love peanut sauces, but this one was too tangy (citrusy) for me. Will not try again.

I added crushed peanuts and chopped green onions to the top for garnish and it was delicious!!  I also used oriental noodles instead of spaghetti.  I am definitely going to make this again!

Great pot luck meal (without peanut allergies, of course). I cut back on the lemon juice a little bit, otherwise, did it as is (with whole wheat spagettini). Good dish. All gobbled up.

The flavors were great.  Next time though, I'll drastically cut down on the amount of pasta which, I hope, will even out the pasta to sauce ratio.  i might even add more broccoli.

The peanut butter was really overpowering, I couldn't really taste anything else. If I make it again I will use much less.

Loved it but I only used a little lemon juice - half of a third of a cup of lemon juice.  Didn't have any orange juice so thinned out sauce with water - next time I may use the pasta water.  Only used 1/4 cup canola oil. Also, I added some red pepper (chili) flakes to the vegetables.  Delicious!

The flavor was excellent. However, there was too much pasta and the dish was a bit brown due to the brown and viscosity of the sauce.

My family really enjoyed this, but I used twice as many peppers and half as much oil as it called for. Next time I plan to use even more vegetables and add some carrots to the mix.
