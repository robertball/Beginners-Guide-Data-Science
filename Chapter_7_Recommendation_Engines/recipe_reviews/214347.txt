REALLY, REALLY good BUT I made a few changes:   1)  CRUST:  OMITTED SUGAR!   Cake mix is sweet enough; ADDED 2/3 CUP ground almonds.    2) FILLING:  used 2.5 BANANAS; OMIT SUGAR and ADDED 1/3 CUP overripe mashed banana;  3) Topped w/HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM (1 cup whipping cream, 2 Tbsp powered sugar, 2 Tbsp Amaretto)   Made in 13 x 9 pan but want to try again in traditional spring form pan.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND W/CHANGES!
