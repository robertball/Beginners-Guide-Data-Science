I first had Boilo just yesterday at a Lithuanian friend's house, made from his Grandmother's recipe.   As I didn't have his, I made this recipe pretty much as written except to adjust the proportions as I had a fifth of grain alcohol and not half a gallon.  I also squeezed the citrus fruits and really mashed them into the mixture to release their full flavor.  From some other sources, I let the honey mixture simmer for an hour to fully bring out the flavors from all of the ingredients.  It is delicious!

Yep, this is pretty much the stuff I remember from my Lithuanian Grandmother's Christmas parties 30+ years ago in Mahanoy City PA.  Recipe is amazing as is; no need to tweak.  In my family, the tradition was to shoot Boilo warm straight-up or mix with ginger ale (delicious both ways).  One note of caution;  be sure to add grain alcohol AFTER the honey mixture has cooled a bit and is off the stove (no need to loose your eyebrows).

Pretty solid recipe! Back in Shenandoah PA it was potato vodka as the key ingredient...in Jersey, strong Laird's Applejack or Bottled in Bond Apple Brandy was the kicker. Hard to get the Laird's products here in the Deep South, but the apple flavors go so well with the other ingredients its worth looking for it. Also, was used as a cold remedy, tastes a LOT better than NyQuil...keep this in mind for cold and flu season. Cloves have a soothing anesthetic effect for sore throats.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls, but with whiskey (bourbon) as suggested in the recipe details, and it is fantastic! It's very sweet, so I like it with a twist of lemon.  Bottled it as part of a homemade Christmas gift.
