Delicious for the amount of calories, but not the best cheesecake I've ever had. They did freeze quite well.

These were pretty good. I used 1 Tbsp oreo cookie crumbs instead of the cookies suggested, and added about 1/2 tsp lemon juice to the mix before putting it into the muffin cups. (Maybe a bit more next time) I do not like a really heavy cheesecake, so these suited my taste. I will for sure make again.
