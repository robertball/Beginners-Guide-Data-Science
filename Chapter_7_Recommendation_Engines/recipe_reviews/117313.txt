Very good, very authentic taste. I DID make some changes. 1. I put two boneless pork chops into the slow cooker with chicken broth, soy sauce, chunks of garlic and ginger. I coated the chops with BBQ sauce (similar taste to hoisin but so much cheaper--just get a cheap bottle, it does not matter). Cook on low for 6 hours. This makes the meat VERY TENDER and you get so much more out of it than just from frying. 2. I'm all for convenience, but you really don't need to pay the extra $$ for prepackaged coleslaw mix. Get 1 head of cabbage. Roughly chop 1/2 of it. Get a handful of baby carrots, roughly julienne them. It really does not take that much more time. 3. I sauteed the veggies along with some garlic and ginger in vegetable oil with a splash of sesame. When nearly cooked but still crunchy, I added hoisin sauce mixed with soy sauce (1 tbsp of hoisin, 1/4 cup of soy). Mix like a green salad to coat. Let that simmer for a while, then remove the pork from the slow cooker. Remove fat. Shred the meat with the fork. After you've warmed the tortillas put a teaspoon of hoisin sauce on the tortilla and then build the rest of the wrap. Delicious.

Very good recipe, quick easy for substitutions. I subsituted white wine for water.  I used half the hoisin in in the recipe and the other half on the tortillas for more deep hoisin flavor. I added a tsp of gravy master for the brown color I like.  I used frozen chicken breasts defrosted in the wave.  I sliced them in matchstick size pieces.  I would have used wood ears if I had them.   I used dried shitake musrooms instead.  I also added bell pepper sliced real thin , and scallions with the cabbage I sliced myself.  Oh yeah and a splash of fish sauce to the sauce mixture.

I think this is a wonderful dish, but I made some significant adjustments of my own and some suggested by other reviewers. These were the changes: 1.) I slow cooked the pork in chicken broth, bbq sauce, soy sauce, hoisen sauce, ginger, and garlic for 6-7 hours on high. No cornstarch and no water. 2.) For the sauteed mixture I mixed the following ingredients: cole slaw mix, sliced shitaake mushrooms, bean sprouts, minced ginger and garlic, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1/4 cup of hoisen sauce, and some of the leftover juices I had in the crock pot. My boyfriend prefers it with just white rice, but I prefer it with the tortillas. It made enough for dinner and lunch for two!

This was pretty good. I may tweak it a bit next time.  I did not use hoisin sauce because plum sauce is what is used for Moo Shu pork.  No big, just a preference.  The 2 men in my house ate almost the full batch so that tells me they really liked it.

The recipe was a good starting point. I added red bell pepper, onions, skipped the cornstarch, replaced the water with white wine and used more hoisin sauce then called for as it didn't have that deep rich color I was looking for. Very healthy and easy meal to put together; especially if you happen to have leftover pork. Thank you!

Delicious Moo Shu.  I had leftover shredded pork so I used that in place of the pork loin chops.  Liked the ease and quickness of the pre-cut coleslaw in this recipe.   The hoisin sauce added so much flavor.  We enjoyed it and I will be making this one again.

This has become one of my familes favorites.  I actually use left over pork chops to make it.  I cut the meat into little strips and add it to the sauce and vegies.  On occasion, I have also added a little bit of Chinese Five Spice.  Wonderful recipe as written, or adjusted to your own taste.

We liked this. Quick and easy. Can easily substitute chicken for the pork. I actually used strips of pork loin roast because it was cheaper for the amount I was making. I would suggest adding some sliced green onions. I used par-cooked tortillas that you brown at home. I found them at Costco. They are nice and thin and are closer to the traditional pancake that is used with Moo Shu. We added more hoisin sauce to the tortilla before rolling up.

I wanted something different to use up some thin cut pork chops and gave this a try. Goes together in a flash and was yummy. My husband ate a bunch of them. served with plum sauce on the side for dipping etc. Just couldn't be easier! Thanks for the recipe

My husband is so picky and he loves this recipe.  I use pork tenderloin and usually it is a leftover tenderloin.  I purchase Moo Shu pancakes from the local Asian grocery store and the best Hoisin sauce I found is Lee Kum Kee sold at the same store.

This is a decent way to do moo shu on the fly. I added shitake mushtooms and sliced onion, plus a little more hoisin to the sauce. Thanks!

Very good recipe just needs slightly less ginger in my opinion.  Tastes fine with tortillas but most grocery stores actually sell the special "pancakes" that they give you in chinese restaurant....check ethnic aisle.

Not very flavorful.  Nothing like the Mu Shu Pork I have had at many Chinese restaurants.  Also, flour tortillas are too thick to use as a substitute for Chinese pancakes.  I used two refrigerated crepes but they were too thin.

Not bad.  Sauce was not quite right.  Not for me, anyway.  Gonna tweak it a bit next time, but definitely a keeper.

Made with tofu instead of pork and was pretty good following recipe as written - will tweak a bit to make less sweet and more our favorite chinese restaurant's moo shu dish.  Thanks!

I hate it when people change recipes on here, HOWEVER, I didn't have any pork, so I used chicken!  I had boiled some chicken breasts the day before, so I just cut up two pre-cooked breasts for this.  I pretty much followed the recipe as-is after that, and this is a very fast meal when your meat is already cooked.   This was just as good as the Chinese restaurant.  Thanks!

This was a wonderful recipe. I changed a few things but not much. I had my meat dept  butcher cut up the chops for me. The cole slaw mix reduced down to almost nothing so I added the whole bag (about 4 cups total) then added about 2 more Tablespoons more of the soy suace and 1/2 cup of the Plum sauce (which I used instead of hoisin suace at a reveiwers suggestion) it was fabulous!!! Moo Shu Pork is our favorite chinese dish in a restaurant and this turned out just as good if not better!! Also, Verty important...try to find authentic Moo Shu wrappers to use instead of tortillas... it gives a much better taste. any Asian market should carry them.)

This was good, I made mine with chicken instead of pork and spread plum sauce on the tortillas before wrapping. This is a quick and filling meal especially if you pair it with rice.

I didn't have pork and used chicken instead.  I also didn't have fresh gingerroot and used powder.  I am sure it would have been better with fresh, but the powdered  seemed to do just fine. This is a great recipie and the hubby loved it - he is a big fan of moo shu. The best part about chinese food is that you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand.  I used carrots, cabbage, and mushrooms. Serve with plum sauce on the side and it is simply yummy

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and came out great. I used boneless pork chops and the followed the directions. I did add a bit of oyster sauce. It was so much better than what I get at the resturants. I will start making it myself.

Pretty good for making a quick meal, if you have the supplies. The Hosin sauce can be over powering for some people.

This was pretty good.  I could not find any ginger root at the store, so I used ground ginger.  Also, this was my first time using hoisin sauce, and it was a bit strong.  So I added a little more soy sauce.  After adding the extra soy sauce it was very good.

Very good flavor & versatile recipe. The first time I made this I added sliced shitake mushrooms while cooking the pork & sliced green onions with the slaw just to stretch it a little. The second time I made it I had shredded pork left over from the "Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker" recipe from this site. I used that intstead of pork loin chops warming it up with the garlic & oil. It was great - we all prefered the texture of the shredded pork.

I cooked a brined pork roast in the crock pot, then shredded the meat.  I added just a bit more hoisin sauce than the recipe called for.  My hubby and I loved this recipe and will have it again.

As written- a bland base.  But I added more soy sauce (the dark kind), some oyster sauce, sherry, red pepper flakes, sugar, mushrooms, egg, napa cabbage in addition to the angel hair shredded cole slaw, and green onions- and it came out quite good.  Be prepared to doctor it up to your taste, but it is a good starting point.

Really, only 2 stars as written. We could never get the sliced pork to turn out well.   It was always too chewy to be amazing.  That's probably my fault and not the recipe.  What turned this around was me being lazy and buying ground pork.  I cook the ground pork and garlic, then add the vegetables, cooking until the cabbage is soft, then add the 2 sauces.   The kids not only went nuts over it, they took the recipe to college with them.

I liked the sauce, it was easy to make. I didn't use the coleslaw mix, just substituted thinly sliced peppers, carrots and broccoli.

Not very good. I think I would use fresh cabbage and carrots instead of cole slaw mix next time.  Also, make sure you really like the hoisin sauce you are using.  I tried one that was not so great. Also, Make sure the pork is extremely thin.

So quick and a nice lower-fat option!  I added a chopped red pepper and next time I may add some honey for additional sweetness.  We enjoyed this, thanks!

We actually really liked this.  Made some changes - no sesame oil.  Used those rice noodles and served it over that since flour tortillas would have seemed too think.  Couldn't find the authentic thin wraps it's supposed to be served with.  Used less pork and added mushrooms.  Will add more ginger next time.  This will be a staple in our house!
