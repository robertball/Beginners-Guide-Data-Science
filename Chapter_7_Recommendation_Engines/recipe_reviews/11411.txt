These taste great. They are flat cookies - surprisingly flat. I made my first batch too large, and they did start to fall apart. When I used my small cookie scoop the result was much better. The oats give these a great texture.

They taste wonderful, but the recipe calls for WAY too many chocolate chips.  Instead of 4 cups, we used 2 cups.  Still too many.  Next time we will use only 1 cup (1/4 of what recipe calls for.)  Seems like it could benefit from a tiny bit more flour too, since they had trouble staying together.  Regardless, they really taste GOOD, and I'm sure we'll cook them again!
