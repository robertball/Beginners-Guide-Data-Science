Tasty! I used onions and red and yellow peppers instead of the carrots and celery - because that is what I had on hand. This is soupy so expect that. Serve with white onions and cilantro on top - a little cheese is nice too. Thanks - this is comfort food!

I radically modified this recipe to use only what I had on hand. I sauteed onion and garlic added tomato paste cumin paprika and salt with the rice. I browned the ride a little bit and added the broth and chicken on top. I simmered it until the rice was done added some cilantro. It was delicious.

Any self respecting Mexican rice needs to be braised in the hot oil till slightly brown. This seals outer husk and keeps the rice fluffy with no clumping. Adding the spices after the rice is browned will begin the absorption of the moisture and spices into each rice kernel. Yum Yum!

I really liked this dish. I did make some changes as I have 4 boys who eat like it is the last supper. I used thighs drumsticks and breast. I seasoned them with salt pepper garlic powder sazon (Goya) season salt and parsley then lightly fried them. I doubled the rice and used 5 cups of water. It takes WAY longer than 15 minutes mine took about 35 minutes to be cooked. I also added onion while browning the rice. Flavor was great and used tostadas and queso fresco to complete the meal.

Very good dish. My cousins showed up just before it was finished cooking so I opened drained and added a can each of corn and black bean some salsa Verde and there was plenty for everyone. On top of tortilla chips or rolled up in tortilla. Very good both ways!

Since the chicken is "cooked chicken", why not cook it in "4 cups of water" and then use that broth in the recipe?  I watched a lady make something like this on my first trip to Mexico and have tried ever since to make some as good.  This may be it. ?

Tasty! I happened to all but one of the ingredients on hand this is a great dish for a cold football night. I didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted most of a can of tomato paste which I think gave it good flavor. I also used two packets of that Swanson Flavor Booster. I'd definitely would make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe says. It was simple and good. It may be a little bland for some; but could easily be spiced up.

I went with the diced carrots and celery. I added a half can of diced tomatoes and used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water. I pan seared my boneless skinless chicken thighs in a little butter after coating them with salt and pepper and cumin. Then added them to the rice and simmered about 35 minutes! Delish. Next time I will squeeze a lime in and add diced avocado and a dollop of sour cream!

Concept is good but the dish is not. I used 4 large chicken breasts and 4 cups of water as recipe stated because I did not want my rice to burn or dry out. As other reviewers have stated it was very soupy after 45 mins so I took out the chicken and boiled for 10 mins. I then cut breast into small pieces put back into pot and mixed in. Just didn't have much flavor and still a bit soupy. There are better recipes out there for this so I will keep looking.

My mother was an excellent cook as was her mother. Neither could give you a definitive measurement of their condiments. When my mom responded to my requests for recipes she would give measurements like "a pinch" a "smidgen" a "small measurement" (which she further explained was a palm measurement) etc. that really made no sense to me. Half a century later I can now relate to her measurements as I can not tell young people definitively what I use in a recipe. Sometimes it is just trial and error and you learn what makes the recipe better. Now my grandchildren are getting frustrated by my recipes!

Instead of plain water I used the water that I cooked the chicken in plus a can of chicken broth. Next time I will add a little more cilantro on top just before serving. Overall a great meal and very little cleanup! Thanks for sharing!

I parboiled boneless skinless thighs with a lot of spices then shredded it for this recipe. Liked this as is. Next time I might add onion and maybe even some fresh diced tomatoes.

Tried to make this at 10 000 feet altitude in the Colorado mountains and the rice would not soften. Also tried to double the recipe and that may have been part of the problem.

This was a very quick and simple meal to prepare. I put 6oz of tomato sauce in the water rather than just 2 as noted in the recipe. I could have added the remaining 2 ounces from the can but I did not want to over do it. The overall taste was good but it did need some salt after serving. Surprisingly my kids both liked it and my wife raved so I will make this again. I will probably add a half to one teaspoon of salt to the recipe to bump up the taste a little more.

This was a very good dish. I poached my chicken first then used the broth in place of the water to add flavor.

I grilled chicken breasts for this. Used a little less broth than what it called for to make it less "soupy" and red chile peppers (I live in New Mexico) and red onion. I will make this again.
