This was thick, spicy and good. While cooking, I wasn't too sure about how it was going to turn out--with the refried beans, it seemed so thick, but it all came together well. The cheese and cilantro really added to the flavor. I added some sour cream too. One change I made was to use leftover turkey breast that I cut into bite-size pieces. This is a fairly quick and filling meal.
