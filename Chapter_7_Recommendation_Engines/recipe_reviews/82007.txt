I have made this recipe many, many times and my family loves it. I cook the dough/pizza crust first for about 15 minutes, then add all the toppings. I continue baking for about another 20 or so minutes, until the crust is golden brown and toppings are all melted and bubbly, that the crust comes out better to our liking. It works for us and you then don't have to worry about whether the crust is cooked through in the middle of your pizza. We also make this in a deep dish pizza pan.

One very, very critical item on pizza is letting the mozarella cheese dry out in the fridgeopen to air for 5-6 hours before putting it on. This will give the cheese the "stretch" proprerty you see when pulling a wedge from the pie. "Wet" cheese is a no-no on pizza.

Recipe is perfect 'as is.' No changes. Be sure to drain the tomatoes well or deglop fresh ones if not using canned. The only tips I have are related to baking. 1) Greasing the pan tends to make the dough slip, so I grease and lightly flour the pan; 2) baking the crust for 15 min before placing everything on top was key, as another reviewer mentioned. For my taste, I add a bit of minced fresh garlic and chili pepper flakes. This is the recipe we use all the time, with Quick and Easy Pizza Crust also from this site; I don't use frozen. Tasty!

I don't really ever leave reviews, but this one deserved it!  This is my favorite recipe, and I make it once a week for my husband and myself.  It's even better heated up as a leftover!  I doubled the fennel seed and I don't use all the tomatoes.  Make very sure you drain the tomatoes well, or else your pizza will be a little soggy.  Yummy, thanks!

This is a good recipie, but I do the following...after putting the crust into a CAST IRON SKILLET, I brush the crust with olive oil...then add fresh sliced mozzie cheese and then the ingrdients and finishing it up.....makes it so much better!

I am looking for a good deep dish pizza recipe but was very disappointed with this one.  It was bread with pizza toppings covering it.  I had difficulty getting the bread to cook completely and found it gummy and unappealing.  I can see how it would be a great advantage over dough made from yeast, but if you really want great pizza you need to take the time to make your own dough.

I really liked making pizza in a pan and I LOVED the sauce--so good!!!!  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and canned mushrooms because that was all I had.  Be sure to pre-bake the crust and make sure that it isn't too thick--my crust was so thick that it was still undercooked even though I pre-baked it.

I have made this recipe several times and can not get enough of it. I do not change anything, as you should not when trying a recipe. People who alter recipes should just post their own an leave originals alone. This recipe is a definate keeper.

This is a great base recipe that can be easily changed up for whatever ingredients you have on hand!  I have made it many times with different fillings and it is wonderful.  An example is to use turkey pepperoni instead of sausage..just layer some on the crust.  Much more healthy if you are watching calories, also have used reduced fat mozzarella. I found 24 oz of diced tomatos is way too much...I halve that and add extra sauted onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc.

Made this pizza for my family and it was a major hit. I've also tried changing the toppings around...but this is a great start! Tonight...i'm making it just as is. However some nights when I don't have all the ingredients...I will add other toppings. This is the only pizza recipe I use now!! Thanks!!!!

Yum! Absolutely FANTASTIC!!! I wouldn't change a single thing. Other than dusting my greased baking dish w/ cornmeal (I always do this when making pizza),  sauteing my onion / sasusage 2gether (oops!), omitting the mushrooms called for (my hubby & I hate them) & mistakenly purchasing frozen pizza dough instead of bread dough, I followed Jamie's directions to a T. Oh, and b/c I only had Hunt's balsamic, EVOO & basil flavored tomatoes on hand, I subbed those for plain ones. I have 2 tips to share. First, pre-bake your crust for 15 min. or so, top w/ the fixins' & pop back in the oven for another 20 min. (my pizza took 35 min. to cook thru / crisp up). Second, drain your tomatoes as best you can, but don't worry if some liquid remains. If you layer your ingredients in the order instructed, your tomatoes will end up on top & the very little juice left will not cause your crust to be soggy at all. Those experiencing a "soggy" crust must not have pre-baked it or didn't follow the recipe submitters layering directions. I really think using stoneware made all the difference, so if you own a stoneware dish, I suggest using it. One last thought.... You MUST add the Parmesan cheese (I used grated). It REALLY, REALLY sets this pizza apart from all others! Thanks SO much for sharing, JAIME5025. This isn't the "real" thing, but it sure gives the Chicago deep-dish chains a run for their money! This will definitely be added to my "keeper" file! :-)

This recipe is basic to making pizza whether you use dough already prepared or prepare it yourself. You can vary the seasons to your liking. One suggestion I have is not to drain the tomatoes but to reduce the liquid on the stove. What all good chefs would do.

We have made this dish three times and have one key step that needs to be added. Several hours before you make this dish, be sure to add the tomatoes and spices (oregano, salt, garlic powder and fennel seed) in a Tupperware or other container to allow the spices time o permeate the tomatoes. On our first try we did not do this and the flavors seemed to be a little uneven. The next two times we allowed the spices time to work into the tomatoes and this made a huge improvement! I think this is why some reviewers said that it tastes even better the next day as the spices have had a chance to flavor the dish.

Wow, is all I can say!  I finally made this following the recipe exactly (ok, I didn't have any fennel seed).  It is delicious! I prebake my crust for about 15 mins, and then bake 10-15 mins longer with toppings on it.  I used petite diced tomatoes with garlic and onion added, and had to drain them ALOT!  I drained them about 4 different times, (after letting them sit in between times), they were still a little to juicy.  I think next time I would cut back a bit on the diced tomato, one and a half 14 oz. cans might do it.  I use frozen Italian bread dough for my pizza crust, yum!  I will be making this again! Edit:  I have found if you layer this the way it calls for in the recipe the juice from the tomatoes is not a problem.  I also found that frozen whole wheat bread dough makes a fantastic crust for this pizza.

I grew up in Gary, Indiana and I know about Chicago, Pizza. My two favorit Chi-Town foods are Vienna Beef hot dogs and Deep Dish Pizza. This recipe rockssssssss. Trust me. 
The dough was a little hard to work, plus I was scared of over working it. But I did a pretty good job of getting it into a round deep dish cake pan. Baked it for 15 minutes took it out and re worked it around the edges. I strained the tomatoes pretty good, used cornmeal and this came out awesome. Thank you, thank you to the original writer of this recipe and the many others that added constructive input. If you messed this up I suggest you stick with Degornos or Tony's frozen pizza. Or better yet peanut buutter and jelly because this was too easy... 
This bachelor now how a Ace in the hole for "first date night"

Very good.  I made only minor changes,  used a 12 inch stoneware pan and sprinkled the fresh pizza dough (from Publix) with cornmeal.  My husband is from Chicago and is huge fan of Lou Malnati's deep dish.  He loved this and I will  make it again.  My daughter requested it as a Stuffed Spinach, so I will try that.  I will also try to find a recipe for real chicago dough which is as another reviewer said richer, buttery and crisp.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe on a cold rainy GA night as we watch The Bears on Monday Night Football!

This is my favorite pizza, including anything I could get in a restaurant. I make if often without any changes.  However, I always have "issues" with the crust, not cooked or bubbles and shrinkage when pre-cooked as many have suggested etc.  The secret to this recipe is to use a 12" pizza pan with the holes in it. No need to pre-cook the crust.   Bake using  a lower oven shelf. The crust comes out perfect and cooked and it's also much easier to serve.  Slide it onto a cutting board and cut into pizza slices.
Thanks for the excellent recipe.

This was a great recipe!  Very easy to make and you can customize it to your liking.  I did use pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust and cooked it in a cast iron skillet.  Will definitely make this one again.

Let's be honest here: Giordano's it's not, but for homemade Chicago style pizza, EXCELLENT (and I've lived around Chicago my whole life so I know deep dish). Really easy to make too! The only thing I did differently was prebake the crust 15 minutes before adding the ingredients. Loved it, will definitely do again.

Brushed the Pillsbury artisan crust (from a tube)with a mix of butter, olive oil, pressed garlic cloves and dried oregano before baking the crust on its own for 12 minutes. it was phenomenal ! my kid said 'i was expecting not to like this but it was really good!' After the first 12 minutes I added everything on the list except sausage because we do not eat meat and baked for 10 more minutes. Amazing homemade pizza

I love Chicago style pizza..and although this isnt as good as the stuff they bring to my door (maybe bc like a sandwich, it'll always taste better if someone else makes it) I added some brown sugar to the tomatoes to cut down on the acidity. I used my cast iron and some refrigerated dough. Good recipe! and cheaper than the local deep dish place.

This is an amazing recipe. The Uno's restaurant left the San Diego area. Now I can make my own! I used the bread as the crust. Then I layered sausage, mozzarella, parmesan, then topped it with 2 drained cans of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregan! It was the closed that I have found for the replacement of Uno's!

Followed other reviews advice.  Pre-cook crust for 15 minutes.  Drain tomatoes, add spices and let it sit for about one hour.   Dust deep dish pan with corn meal.  This is by far the best pizza I have ever made.

This was the best homemade pizza I have ever made.  I used one loaf of frozen bread dough but only about 2/3 pound of Bob Evans italian sausage, and divided it all between two 9" cake pans.  I thought it would be dry with no sauce, but even with draining the tomatoes well, it turned out perfectly and was delicious!

This is so awesome!  I made the recipe for Quick and Easy Pizza Crust instead of buying it pre-made.  The only other thing I did differently was to bake the crust for 15 mins prior to putting the sausage on it.  I then baked the entire thing an add'l 20 mins and it was perfect.

While this is tasty, a true Chicago-style pizza has a crispier outside, and an airier inside.  There is usually a small amount of cornmeal mixed in as well.  Again, this is tasty but not a true Chicago-style crust.

One ingredient that distinguishes Chicago Deep Dish Pizza is the cornmeal in the crust and slices of mozzarella cheese.  This is bread dough topped with pizza ingredients.  It is in no way even close to Chicago style pizza.

This was pretty good.  It smelled incredible when it was cooking but lacked something when we ate it.  If I make it again I will use more sauce and more garlic.

I am back to edit this 2 days later.  The left overs where DELICIOUS!!!!!!  Will make this waaaay more often

Excellent!! I skipped the sausage as a personal preference. I used canned mushrooms & chopped up some pepperoni & green peppers & added it all in w/the tomato mixture. Layered cheese, tomato mix, & topped w/more cheese. Love, love, love this!! I've made it twice in 2 weeks.

Many of these pictures show the cheese on top - epic fail if you truly want Chicago style.  The directions are correct, you want the sauce on top!

I made this last night and it was incredible. I cooked mine in a cast iron frying pan and the double layers of goodies just oozed everywhere. I had never put the sauce directly on top- it was a hit. Thank you so much, Jaime5025!!!

Was is Chicago a few months ago and loved my pizza from Giordano's so I was happy to see if this was close. Made according to directions, checked after 25 minutes, turned oven up to 375 at that point and cooked another 7 minutes, crust was perfect...used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of fire roasted tomatoes, next time I will add some chopped peppers, really liked the flavors.

This was really good. I used a fresh dough recipe that I found on Food Network. I don't eat meat so my toppings were mushrooms, pineapple, green olives, and red bell peppers. I added in some crushed red peppers to the sauce and left out the fennel seed. I also added in some dried parsley to the sauce.  My mistake was that I didn't dry out the mozzarella cheese so it was a bit wet at the bottom but I will definitely do that next time. Will make again. Thanks.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  The topping is really delicious. I prebake the crust for about 10 minutes and do this whether I use frozen, refrigerated or homemade dough.  The recipe calls for drained tomatoes.  If they are not drained the pizza will be soggy. Thanks Jaime, for sharing this amazing recipe.

This pizza was great! It's a meal in itself. Fresh parmesan is a must! I also pre-cooked the dough for 15 mins before adding the ingredients as suggested by earlier reviews.

Great pan pizza and an easy weeknight meal!  Easy to adjust the meat to suit your tastes such as using turkey sausage or any of the many other variations found in groceries today.  Thank God for these reviews as well.  The pizza crust from TJ is perfect and prebaking it was key to it turning out so nicely.  Also dusting with cornmeal in a cast iron skillet was right on.  The pie held together well when cutting to serve.  Will make again, probably will fresh tomatoes, oregano and garlic next time, would probably put it over the top!  Don't leave out the fennel seeds either.  Great recipe, Jaime!

This is a fine recipe, but it's not Chicago style at all.  First, the crust on a true Chicago pizza is not bread dough--it's a rich, buttery dough that gets nice & crisp on the bottom and edges.  Second, the mozzarella goes directly on the crust.  Third, the sausage is not crumbled or pre-cooked--it's formed on top of the cheese is one big, thin patty.  Sorry, but we Chicagoans are rather particular about our pizza!!

I wasn't able to find frozen bread dough at our store so I bought a bag of refrigerated pizza dough. I had many tomatoes from our neighbors garden I needed to use up so I diced those instead of using canned. I used fresh garlic cloves and minced them. I sauted the garlic, onion, 1/2 green bell pepper, fresh sliced mushrooms in olive oil with salt, pepper, oregano and fennel. I drained all the liquid from the vegies. I did bake the the crust for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I topped it with mozzerella cheese, tomato mixture, and lastly with grated fresh parmesan cheese. I did brush the crust with olive oil and baked for 30 minutes in a cast iron skillet. The crust rose beautifully, the dough was completely cooked/not soggy, the color of the crust was a lovely golden brown, and the texture was crispy. I made a second "kid version" pizza with jar sauce, mozzerella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and parmesan cheese. They loved theirs as well. The prep work time was long but worth it in the end! Everyone raved over it and only have 3 pieces left over from both pizzas. Enjoy, you won't be disappointed!

We weren't impressed with this recipe.  I'd suggest perhaps a smaller pan, as the bread dough I used didn't stretch enough to cover a 9X13, allowing for crust on all sides.  Seemed it lacked flavor, as compared to a couple of other deep dish pizza recipes we've tried.  Sorry!  Not a favorite .

This recipe is amazing.  It reminds me so much of the pizza I ate in Chicago.  I used a 8" round pan and didn't add mushrooms.  I recommend this recipe to any deep dish fan.

Pizza is my all time favorite food, so I couldn't wait to try this.  Both mine and my husband's mouths were watering just thinking about it.  It did not disappoint.  Next time I will probably omit the sausage (just personal preference).  We thoroughly enjoyed the tomato, mushroom mixture on top - it was delicious!   I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but did take another reviewer's suggestion and prebaked my crust for about 12 minutes before hand - I did not have soggy or underdone crust. Thank you for the wonderful recipe, we really enjoyed it and this one will be a family favorite!

This was awesome pizza.  I used hot sausage and added pepperoni!  Thank you everyone for the suggestions on baking 15 minutes before adding toppings - it turned out great! I personally love reading the suggestions from other readers - that's what makes cooking and this site so much fun!

My family loved this.  The sauce was awesome!  The only alterations I made were that I did not add mushrooms or onions to the sauce, but I did used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of regular. I also added some pepperoni with the Italian sausage.  I didn't have fresh parmesan cheese, but it probably would have made it even better if I had.  Very definitely a keeper!

This was a Very Good recipe, My whole family really enjoyed it, I only had a can of stewed tomatoes on hand, just drained and chopped them up, definatly need the fennel seed and the fresh grated parmesan cheese,(delish)It also heats up nice for leftovers!! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Great recipe! Made this recipe exactly as listed except I baked it in a deep dish pizza pan instead of glass dish. Filling is great and even though my crust was a little softer than I wanted (my fault, not the recipe) I'd make this again for sure. Just the right amount of cheese and savory ingredients. I kept the Italian sausage in bigger chunks and recommend you do the same.

Very good first night: Exceptionally good the next night! When I make it again, I will cook it the day before and reheat, allowing the flavors to marry.
Incidentally, one of the fennel seeds stuck in my teeth and when I chewed it, it had very little flavor left; it was a good example of "marrying", most of its flavor had "married" the other ingredients.

I wasn't sure about this recipe due to lack of sauce but tried it anyway and wow was I surprised, it was the best pizza ever. My hubby is super picky and he loved it except next time I will slice my own mushrooms instead of buying presliced, they were too thick but over all it was amazing baked in my large castiron skillet

This was great!  It was tough rolling out the bread to get it to a 9x13, so I just used a 9x9 instead.... it worked really well!  the flavor of the sauce and sausage is fantastic and makes for a really quick pizza!  Thanks!

YUM!  I typically do not like Chicago-style pizza (or perhaps maybe just not the restaurant variety) however it's my husband favorite so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I love it!  And so did the hubby!  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you! (I accidentally bought hot Italian sausage and it actually added a nice flavor without being spicy)

A great meal...filling and flavorful! I used Pillsbury canned pizza dough (which worked perfectly), made this exactly as the recipe was written and would not change a thing. Like the other reviews suggest, make sure you pre-bake the crust and thoroughly drain the tomatoes.  What's great is you can basically add/change the toppings as much as you want as long as you keep the spices, cheese, and diced tomatoes...and it will always taste delicious!

Incredible!  The sauce was fantastic - could've drained some of the juice/water out of can, but still fantastic.  I didn't use frozen dough - used the highest rated dough recipe on this site.  Highly recommend incorporating these two.  Other change I made was just adding more toppings... pepperoni, ham, artichokes, jalapenos, and crushed red pepper.  Wonderful!  Thanks so much!

The one thing that is missing from this recipe is  dusting the pan with a little bit of cornmeal. Nobody notices but that the way it's done in Chicago. The crust should be a little bit blackened on the outside(not the top edges). This is accomplished by many uses so get those pies going!

This was an excellent recipe. It was so easy to make. I did add a thin layer of pizza sauce on crust before the toppings. It did work well to bake the crust alone for about 10 minutes. I used hamburger and pepperoni instead of sausage. It was delicious. I will make this again and again!

The tomato/onion/mushroom topping alone deserves 5 stars.  With the fennel and other spices it's a perfect blend of flavors. I'm making myself hungry -- may have to go cut a bit of the leftovers right now. Made this last night.  After adding all the ingredients to the mushroom and onion saute, I reduced all the liquid over medium heat while I cooked the crust for 10-15 minutes.  I added some green pepper to use it up.  I used two rolls of Pillsbury pizza dough in a 13x9 pan that was greased and floured.  It was a little too much dough.  But good.  I need to cut the recipe down anyway so I may try one roll of pizza dough in a smaller pan.  I plan to make the same amount of sauce and try freezing half.

I added fire roasted tomatoes (instead of traditional), fire roasted bell peppers (I just cooked them under my broiler), olives, and fresh garlic and herbs.  I've tried to make this with my own dough, and it never seems to work that well. I tried Pillsbury Pizza Dough last night.. it was great, and I'm not normally of a fan of pre-made foods.   I also sauted my garlic in some olive oil, added a tiny bit of the juice I drained from the tomatoes, a little bit of tomato paste, and more fresh herbs.. then added to the tomatoes before putting on the pizza. WONDERFUL.

This pizza was excellent! I used my own pizza crust recipe instead of the frozen bread loaf.  I also placed the cheese on the bottom of the pizza instead of the top.  The flavor was fantastic!

This was very good. For those people who have trouble spreading the dough; 30 to 45 minutes before using dough, take out of fridge and let set for that amount of time. The gluttons will relax and the dough will be a lot easier to spread.

This was wonderful.  I pre-baked the crust for 12 minutes (will do 15 next time) and halved the tomatoes.  Can wait to try it again.

This was the first time I attemped to make a chicago style pizza.It turned out great. Instead of using regular frozen bread dough, I used whole wheat dough and prebaked it as suggested by previous reviewers. As my husband said "It's a keeper". Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly. Only one difference. I finished putting it together well before it was time to go into the oven. I refrigerated the pizza in the pan (stoneware) for about 1 hour prior to putting it in to bake. After 45 min the pizza and crust was cooked perfectly. Maybe having the ingredients cooled off helped the dough to not be soggy. My family LOVED it!  I also used a pastry brush to spread olive oil on the bottom and sides of the pan, gave it a great taste.

Why is everyone poo-pooing this recipe?  It's styled after Chicago pizza.  Maybe it doesn't taste like Home Run Inn, but it sure looks good ... it's worth a try!

For Christmas dinner in my family we always bake pizza and have hot fudge sundaes for dessert, to relieve the stress on a great family day, lets face it, its more about family time than spending it all in the kitchen.  The only thing I did different is I loaded it with a little more sausage and added some Canadian Bacon.  It was by far the best pizza I have ever made, and the left overs the next morning were even better!!!  5 stars is not enough!!!

YUM! I used my deep dish pizza pan which I  oiled  & sprinkled some corn meal over the top before adding the dough.  I added in some diced green pepper, basil and crushed red pepper flakes.  I added a little more tomatoes and just "eye-balled" the seasonings.  This was fantastic & I will be making this often!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Being a 21 year old college student who grew up in Chicago I know pizza. The topping were great! Great idea but theres a reason why restaurants spend so much time on dough. Frozen bread dough does not cut it for me. I did enjoy the pizza, but its not mistakable for Lou Malnatis or Unos, next time ill take the extra time and make my own crust.

Wow! This was better that any pizza place I have ever been too and I lived in Chicago for 8 years.  I did add green pepper and pepperoni.  My husband loved it also.  We ate the leftovers until it was gone.  Will make this again and again!-(5/28)update-I made this tonight and used the Bread Machine Pizza Dough recipe for the crust.  I also didn't have any meat on hand so I skipped that and had a skillet with sauted mushrooms, red and green pepper, garlic, and onion with the recommended added spices/seasonings.  I only had one 14 oz can of the diced tomatoes.  I rolled out my crust, spooned some tomato sauce lightly on the dough, spooned on the veggies, covered it with an Italian cheese blend and baked for 25 min.  (I forgot about the parmesean, but the blend had some in it).  My family raved.  It is hard to mess this one up!

I have made this several times, and every time I thought it would make a great pasta as well.  So last night I did just that - used gnocchi instead of crust and did not drain my tomatoes, otherwise exactly the same.  YUM!  The gnocchi gives it the bite of the missing crust, and the juice made for fantastic dipping with warm bread on the side.  Loved it!

I highly recommend a few add ons to attain a thoroughly cooked (not gummy!) & higher crust:  Oil the pan, sprinkle with cornmeal -- stretch the dough out & proof for at leas 20 minutes -- until its light and a bit puffy.  Pre-cook for at least 10 minues until its light brown, then pull out & add your toppings & cook as directed.  It will be lighter, thoroughly cooked & NOT gummy.  If you like it thicker - do it in a cast iron frying pan & cook a little longer. I do recommend making your own dough, but if you don't have the time, this works quite well!

This is pretty good, but it doesn't resemble Chicago deep dish pizza in my opinion.

This was so easy and delicious.  I used one tube of Pillsbury Italian bread.  I did not precook the crust.  It came out perfect, crispy on the edges and not soggy on the bottom.  I drained the tomatoes as suggested and didn't have a problem.  I couldn't believe how much it tasted like Chicago Pizza Pub pizza that I used to get on Long Island.

I just made this pizza tonight, and it was FANTASTIC!!! The only change I made was that I added diced green peppers along with the onions and mushrooms. I will be making this again and again!!!

First of all - I have not made this recipe however, the writer on April 4th stated that she knows Chicago pizza and that the cheese is put on the crust and that the sausage is not crumbled.  That is not true.  I was born and raised in Chicago and we have the best pizza of anywhere, but, how she described it is not correct.  Maybe at one place that she went to they made it like that but most are not like she said.  I just wanted to clarify that point because I too am a pizza nut and Chicago is definitely the best place for pizza.  This recipe sounds very good and maybe I will try it one day but just wanted to clear up any "Chicago" misconceptions!

this is a very good recipe.  like others, I halved the tomatoes, but unlike others, I wished I had added the whole amount.  I throughly drained and squeezed the moisture out of the canned tomatos and it turned out a little drier than I wanted.  I would still add the whole amount of tomatos and not squeeze out so much of the moisture next time.  I would also cut the sausage just a little, maybe even 1/2 pound.  the pie was extremely dense and rich the way I did it.  not a bad thing, but a little more moisture would have been nice.  I cooked this in a greased, floured cast iron skillet and it came out great.  make sure you pre-cook the crust before putting the toppings in.

Loved this recipe, I followed the directions almost fully (which I never do)  I did however subsitute fresh garlic for the powder.  As good as pizza we have gotten in Chicago!!! I also cooked crust ahead for 15 minutes and then pizza for 20 like other reviewers. Oh and I add 3 14 ounce cans of tomatoes and drain them

I thought it was delicious. I thawed the bread dough in the morning, and I wasn't sure how much to let it rise before I shaped it and stuck it in the oven. It rose quite a bit, which I think was good in the end. My kids didn't like it as much as me. I also left off the mushrooms because my mushrooms were bad, and added green peppers.

We made this in a large cast iron skillet.  Instead of the frozen bread dough, we have used a homemade pizza crust, and a store bought pizza crust.  Par cooked the dough for 7-8 minutes before following the rest of the directions.  We also added pepperoni.  Delicious!!  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

Excellent recipe! Even though I am not able to get the dough to stay pressed up along the sides of the baking dish, it comes out splendidly anyway, so if you have a similar problem, don't worry. Variations I have tried: add a layer of turkey pepperoni with the sausage, and add chopped spinach and green pepper to the tomato mixture.

Yummy! Couldn't find frozen bread dough so I used 2 packages of refrigerated pizza dough.  I also took the advice of others and baked the crust for 15 minutes before adding the toppings, and used Italian-style diced tomatoes on top of seasonings, turned out wonderful! Will make this again soon! Thanks for the recipe!

Really good - my family enjoyed it.  As others suggested, I used a frozen bread dough, let it rise for about 3 hours, then baked in a cast iron skillet for 15 minutes at 400 before lowering oven to 350 and adding the rest of the ingredients.  Crust was perfect.  We thought it could use another meat with the sausage - maybe bacon or pepperoni, and more mozzarella cheese.  It is very filling!  Great served with a simple salad.

Just made this last night and it was awesome!! I only put sausage on half the pizza since I do not eat sausage. This was so tasty and yummy. I will definatley make again and experiment with different toppings. I bet this would make a fabulous hawaiian style pizza with pineapples and ham. YUM!

Yes! Yes! Yes! I have made pizza quite a few times, (never deep dish) but it has NEVER came out this good!!!  I used a greased and floured 9 by 11 glass dish.  Whole Wheat dough, turkey sausage, lots of onions and peppers, skim Mozz, and leftover sauce from the night before and baked for the full 35 minutes.  So delicious!  I was also suprised at how well the pieces held up, i expected to need a fork and knife, but no!  The only tip i would give is to really take the time to pinch and mold the sides of the dough before baking.  It will pay off on presentation and handling the individual pieces.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good pizza, and that says a lot since we're originally from Chicago! I used a frozen loaf but will try the crust recipe on this site next time. Skipped the sausage and used pepperoni, went heavy on the Italian seasoning blend and added chopped garlic and olives. 15 minutes of prebaking the crust ensured we didn't have a soggy crust.

HAVE A "NIGHT OUT" AT HOME! I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. We love Uno's deep dish pizza but don't live in a city that has an Uno's, but now we can totally get our fix. This recipe is great! I had some sourdough crust rising already so I used that, but the whole assembly and topping of diced tomatoes is perfect. My husband said if he had this in a restaurant he would be a big fan of the restaurant, so that's great considering we'd spend at least $30 for some good deep dish (plus a babysitter, gas, etc...) We've been doing "pizza Mondays" for probably three months now and I've been experimenting with different crusts, etc, but this is hands down the keeper! Now to master Taco Tuesdays... :)

I used pre-made pillsberry pizza pie crust because I couldn't find the frozen bread. I also used sweet onion and roasted garlic stewed diced tomatos. I also added about 3 large gloves of sliced garlic to the onion mixture. I also added pepperoni and black olives.  Husbands opinion "It's Grrrreat!, you can make this anytime you want Babe".  Enough said.  The kids loved it too.

This satisfied my craving for Chicago-style pizza. I drained the tomatoes very well and used a slotted spoon to transfer them to a mixing bowl. Then, added the other ingredients including minced garlic rather than the powder. I also used turkey Italian sausage. Serve with a salad and red wine. Perfecto!

I thought this was an excellent pizza.  I used a round deep dish baker and I had left overs.  Plus the dough didn't cook as quickly as it should have.  Next time I will definitely do it in a 9x13 as the recipe states.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I changed it a bit, I only put half as much olive oil on and used about 1/2 cup pizza sauce.  What a good recipe!  That fresh parmesan is what makes the pizza.

This was soooo good! The sauce recipe is fantastic! I used minced garlic instead of  garlic powder, & doubled the fennel seeds. I also let the sauce cook down so it wouldn't  get soggy. I took the advice of many on here to prebake the crust for 15 minutes. It was perfect! My family loved it!! I'm definitely making this again!!

Very tasty. I liked it, making a change from the regular pizza I make. Wife doesn't like cooked tomatoes but I have to say, she enjoyed it. Kept the recipe the same regarding the ingredients. Preheated the cast iron skillet, using my regular pizza dough recipe, I shaped the crust up the side of the skillet and cooked for 20 minutes. I'll do this again.

This was pretty good. I made it as written, with the exception of using pizza crust dough and leaving out the fennel.  I agree with another reviewer that 28 ounces of tomatoes might have been too much, perhaps I'll use three quarters of that next time.  I did pre-bake the crust like many others suggested and had no problem with the dough being undercooked. No, it's not quite as good as from a restaurant, but I don't live in Chicago so this will do just fine!

I have made this several times.. I cannot eat Gluten, so  I do my own crust thing   therefore  my review is a WOW for  the filling. Soo good. I used a cast iron 10"skillet and yes yes yes  always pre bake  ANY crust  you use about 10 minutes  first, then add your fillings and bake until golden brown  . For those interested I use the ALDI  brand Gluten Free Pizza Crust Mix. The mix makes enough for 2 pies so you only need 1/2 of the mixed dough for  this recipe.

This one's a keeper! I didn't have any mushrooms or fennel seed, so I had to leave them out. Otherwise I made this as written.  I cant wait to make it again!!
update- Made it again and added the mushrooms and pepperoni.. even better this time!

This was fabulous.I added chopped bell pepper and onion, saute with the sausage, Hunts fire roasted dice tomatoes (undrained) and sm can of tomato paste. Also, I use good ol Farmer John original sausage. Used quick and easy pizza dough on this site vs frozen and per another reviewer, bake the dough for about 10 mins before adding toppings and then another 20 mins or so. So easy too! The dough made enough for 2  12" pizzas. Be sure after oiling the pan to sprinkle some corm meal on, just a little. I bake at 400 vs 350 ;)

I made this as is, except I substituted green peppers for the mushrooms and added some Penzey's frozen pizza seasoning.  I also doubled the fennel per another reviewer's suggestions.  Used a glass 9x13 pan and baked for about 40 minutes.  Crust was perfect!  My husband enjoyed.  This will be going in the recipe file!

I followed the recipe as written except replaced fennel with dried tarragon, because I didn't have fennel seeds, and it was delicious.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and just reduced the liquid on the stove.  This is a very tasty recipe and easy to make.  I baked it in a stoneware 9x13 pan and extended bake time about 7 mins.

Big fan of Chicago style deep dish, and a bigger fan of simple recipes.  This recipe has it locked up on the easy part (but I do get frustrated when a recipe has an item - olive oil - on the list but doesn't have it in the directions).  I made this as shown with the necessary addition of cooking crust first for 15 minutes.  I enjoyed this, but it just seemed to miss a little something.  Next time I willL 1) use some fresh garlic, 2) replace about 1/4-1/2 of the tomatoes with a little bit of tomato sauce to thicken that topping up just a tad, 3) omit the fennel (only because I'm not a big fennel fan, 4) throw in a bit more salt.  As for the meat, I'm sure you can swap with your favorite pizza topping.

Pretty good.  Lots of bread and cheese, so if that what you like you'll love it.  Next time I'll add more toppings.

What a great inspiration this recipe is.  I had never thought of using frozen bread dough for pizza.  I was really happy with how my pizza came out.  I rubbed my frozen dough with olive oil and placed it in a glass pan covered with plastic wrap also rubbed with the olive oil left over on my hands, then I went to work.  When I came home, the dough had expanded considerably and it was very easy to work with, light and fluffy (I still put some flour on my cutting board before rolling it out).  I sprayed my skillet with non-stick cooking spray before putting the dough in, then I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.  I mashed frozen meatballs in simmering pizza sauce and I made this my first layer followed by mozza, pepperoni, and mushrooms then a sprinkle of parmesan.  I baked it for another 20 minutes at 375.  Came out really good..

Absolutely wonderful. I've been craving a Chicago Style deep dish pizza for a while now, and this fit the bill! A couple of recommendations:
If using a 10" cast iron skillet, cut the filling ingredients in half (except the cheese, you can never have too much cheese). I also added green peppers and pepperoni to the mix. I also buttered the crust after I removed the pizza from the oven. Delicious!

YES! This is THE BEST pizza of any kind I have EVER had! Very thick and heavy, so a little goes a long way! I would take the suggestion of one of the reviewers and cook the crust a little before adding the ingredients. We ended up having to cook ours about ten minutes longer than suggested. It's WONDERFUL!

THE BEST!  My husband could not get enough of this pizza.  Did not use mushrooms and put a thin layer of spicy marinara sauce on top of crust after I baked it, before adding the sausage and pepperoni, then put another thin layer on top of cheese before adding tomatoes.

My husband made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious! We keep kosher, so we made one substitution: tofurkey in place of the Italian sausage. The texture of tofurkey is different from that of Italian sausage, but that isn't so evident in the pizza.

We absolutely loved this pizza recipe. Followed the recipe exactly except added black olives. We'll definitely be adding this one to the rotation. I might try wheat bread next time along with turkey sausage for a little healthier version.

I used 1 lb of my regular "Jay's Pizza Crust" which I then divided. I used around 1/3 of it for the bottom of the 9x13 pan (it was VERY thin). I then layered pepperoni (half of 3.5 oz pkg), chicken (frozen, shredded - about 3 big handfuls), enough slices of monterey jack cheese to cover the meat and diced "italian" tomatoes in there sauce.  I then topped with the remaining crust.  Yum, yum, yummity, yum.  Should make two if we have more then just the 4 of us.

I really enjoyed this recipe. A few less diced tomatoes wouldn't hurt. I couldn't find frozen bread dough so I used Fleischmann's bread mix which worked just fine.  Will definitely make this again!

This is the first time that I've tried a recipe, as is, and I must say, I loved it! I did use pizza dough and prebaked the crust for about 15 minutes as suggested AND I put onion and garlic in while browning the sausage AND I use oregano, basil and garlic seasoned diced tomatoes.  Okay, so maybe I didn't follow it to the letter, but it was absolutely DELISH!!!

I've made this 3 times in the first month after printing this recipe!  Only thing I did different after the first one is add more of the spices.  Everyone who's had some has loved it.  Oh, and the leftovers microwave perfectly.

Just made this pizza for the first time. It is awesome! It tastes just like a Lou Malnati's pizza. I added pepperoni first then the sausage. Also doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese and added Black olives on the very top. Will definetly be making this one again and again.

Everybody raved about this pizza.  I did use a couple of the listed suggestions and used the cast iron frying pan, I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes and I left the shredded cheese open in the refrigerator over night.  I will definately make this again.

I've never been 100% satisfied with homemade pizza—until I found this recipe. I followed the instructions exactly, and the result was PIZZA PERFECTION.

We have been making pizza from scratch (dough and all) for about a year now. This is by far the best pizza of all. The only change was, we made our own crust and precooked our crust lik others mentioned.

I discovered this easy way to make our pizza last year. My family likes it rolled to fit large stone that has been, Sprinkled with dry cornmeal. I brush the olive oil on edges of dough & also pre-bake. Not the 15 minutes more like 10, since dough is thinner. Try tomato sauce instead of diced & fresh garlic, for a change. Suggested toppings onion, green pepper, diced ham & pineapple. I usually make half just like recipe & half w/the ham mixture. Thanks for putting on line.

I followed the suggestions, I used the 14" pizza pan with the holes on the bottom, let the cheese air dry for 6 hours in frig., and added more toppings, green pepper& pepperoni and didn't use the fennel seed, but 1/2 teas. Italian seasoning. This tastes so GREAT and much cheaper than our local pizza place charging us 27.50 for one than is not as good.

The flavor was very good...the Chicago style is just too heavy for our tastes/we will remain thin crust fans. I liked the sauce though.....would make the sauce recipe again.

This pizza was all right for us. I thought there were way too many toppings on the pizza so if I make this again I will scale down to about half of everything except cheese. There was something just not quite right about the flavor but I can't put my finger on what it was. I prefer to make my own crust so I made this with our usual one instead of using the premade bread dough. I might make this again, but I will probably wait and see if it's requested. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight for the kids and got RAVE reviews! This recipe is super easy and sooo good! I used the Bridgeford frozen loaves (3 in a package) and whatever dough I didn't use for the pizza, I made breadsticks with. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks!

This pizza was AMAZING & very hearty! :D I followed most the instructions, yet followed others advice. I cooked the dough (which was a frozen ball) for 15 in a 20 x20 baking dish; since that's all I had- I also lightly sprinkled flour in the pan before the dough- it made it easy to get out of the pan at the end. Browned the sausage, drained it, put it on the mozzarella. Then I used the same pan to caramelize the onions and added all the spices except the fennel (I didn't have any). I also added some finely chopped black olives instead of mushrooms ( I hate mushrooms). My husband loves garlic therefore I added the 1/4 teaspoon as the instructions say but also added 2 chopped up cloves, which gave great flavor- I threw them in with the onions. The meal was wonderful, and my husband is already requesting it for next week. I hadn't realized but I never added the olive oil, I don't even know where you would use it?! Oh well, ENJOY,... i know i did! ;D

Since I have never had a real Chicago style pizza from Unos or someplace like that I cant really compare. But being a pizza lover, I really enjoyed this! Homemade pizzas are so much fun to make and always turn out better then expected. I would reccomend this to anyone!

Yum!!! My husband and I loved! I took the suggestions of others and pre-cooked my crust for 10-15 minutes. Other than that, I didn't change anything else from the original recipe. We loved and Will definitely make again.

I make this often.  One tip is, if you can use actual pizza dough, obviously it will be better.  Trader Joe's makes a nice ready made pizza dough.  For better crust, prepare the dough in the pan and prebake for 10 minutes or so before putting the sausage and toppings on it.  Definately don't skimp on the cheese and make sure you have drained the tomatoes well to avoind soggy crust.  Delish!

As is, this recipe is only 2 stars because if you follow the directions, you get an incredibly soggy pizza with uncooked crust. If you read the reviews about precooking the crust and draining the tomatoes, I could see it bumping up to a 4.  I will try that next time!

Not sure which I like least- using bread dough for pizza, using frozen bread dough, or trying to press a one pound "loaf" of dough into a pan.  Or maybe it's using a pound of Italian sausage on a pizza, AND adding fennel.  Then again, I spend little time in Chicago, maybe that's what they do there.

This is a great recipe. However, I too, use 1/2 the diced tomates, and add chopped gr. pepper along with the onion. I would not make any other changes, but I have a suggestion. Instead of the Ital. Sausage, try finely sliced Ital. beef. Sounds strange, but tastes great. One of the local pizza places in Chicago offered this special every Friday, and people lined up to order. Enjoy!

LOVED it!  Made it exactly as written.  Next time I will do something different with the crust.  Seems to me real Chicago crust is kind of cornbready?

I did not care for this pizza at all. I like my pizza a little more saucy. When I bite into a pizza I like sauce to ooze a little. The tomatoes did not provide that for me. It was a bit dry and I had to use marinara sauce on the side. My husband loved it. My kids hated it. I probably wont be making this recipe again!

This gets requested by my two teen-age boys and my wife many times. Daughter doesn't care for it, but she doesn't like onions. More for the rest of us. I use regular sausage, ground pork, or hamburger and it's all good.

Delicious! We used pre-seasoned diced tomatoes so omitted the garlic, salt and oregano. We also added some diced bell peppers and used only half an onion. I'll be making this one again for sure!

I recently visited my sister in Florida and my brother-in-law made this pizza.  It was delicious.  I would highly recommend it.

I always try to prepare a recipe the first time exactly as is.  This is a good recipe just the way it is.  I think next time I'll add a few more veggies and other toppings. For my family there were too many chunky tomatoes and not enough other toppings.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I cook the crust for about 10 minutes before I add all the toppings. I also use fresh garlic. Make sure you drain the tomatoes really well so your crust does not get soggy.

The pizza was amazing, but the sole reason I gave this recipe a 4 cause of the crust. I would suggest letting the crust rise, putting it in the oven and baking it for 10-15 before layering the ingredients.  The crust was far from a deep dish pizza, but all else was YUMMY!  Next time I am going to make my own crest..

Top notch! Ya gotta make your own crust to get the full effect. This is time-consuming but absolutely delicious. My son had TWO pieces (of deep dish pizza)!

I did as others suggested and baked the dough first (about 12 minutes).  Make sure you use fresh grated parmasan cheese (easy to find in the shredded cheese section).  This recipe is fabulous! As my 3 year old daughter says, "That was awesome!"

this was so good!!! made my own crust.  i sauteed the italian sausage in an iron skillet, drained and removed the meat, and cooked the pizza in the seasoned skillet. i omitted the fennel seeds, since the sausage had plenty.  also, my pizza dough never cooked through, possibly because this is a pan style pizza so the toppings are quite thick. i think i will bake the dough a bit next time, maybe not through, but until the top is slightly browned. can't wait to make this again.

As another reviewer said, "Giordano's it's not..." BUT this IS a VERRRRRY good pizza recipe! I am giving it a 4 and not 5 simply because we like it better using pizza dough (either homemade or bought prepared), versus the frozen bread loaf. It was simply too bread-y. Otherwise, perfecto!

We love this recipe! The only change I made was to cook the dough first as several others recommended and I used fresh garlic which I cooked with the sausage. It's a great, easy recipe and could be made with different toppings if desired. I'm usually a thin crust fan but I LOVE this one!

I didn't make this recipe exactly as stated, mostly because I went to the store without the recipe, but it was still very good. I bought ready made pizza dough from the deli and wasn't sure how much I would need, so I bought 2 balls of it. When I got home, I spread of both balls in the bottom of the 9 X 13 pan and baked it for about 10 mins. Unfortunately, I figured out pretty quick that I had used too much dough. But I went ahead anyway. I cooked the sausage and added 1 can of mushrooms and a quarter of an onion and sauteed all together. Then I dumped this on the cooked dough and poured on about half a jar of spagetti sauce (forgot tomatoes), and then sprinkled on an Italian shredded cheese blend. I cooked it for another 15 minutes or so and served it to my kids. They all ate it, even though the dough was very thick. Next time I will definitely use only one ball of dough and will probably season it a bit before putting it in a well greased pan. Thanks for sharing!

Really good.  I did prebake the crust for 10 min at 400.  Then I lowere the temp to 350. I don't think it would have cook through with so many toppings on it. I also used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of sauce. It was great and every one loved it.

This was a great recipe! It is one of the best pizzas I have had since moving to the west coast.   I followed what most of the other said and cooked the crust for 20 minutes before adding the topping.  The first time I made this I greased the pan and found it a little difficult to stretch the dough to the sides. The next time I followed a review and floured the sides; this was a terrible idea, it made it impossible to stretch the dough. I had to wash the glass dish out and start again.

I love this recipe, and have made it twice. The first time I made it exactly as stated, the second time I used refrigerated thin crust dough, and crushed tomatoes instead of diced...and it was not as successful.  The bread crust was much better, and reheated very well the next day.   I will endeavor to find a happy medium between the dryness of the drained diced tomatoes, and the much too liquid crushed tomatoes.  But as a pizza lover, this was great after ramping up the seasonings a bit.

My kids and husband just thought pizza was ok when we had it I loved it.  The next day when we reheated our leftovers at 350 for 10 minutes, everyone was on board it was a good pizza that makes amazing leftovers!!!

Oh my gosh, this is fabulous!  We like thin better - so rolled out the dough to fit a cookie sheet.  Used canned mushrooms and fresh garlic and added pepperoni. Everyone raved and my hubby was upset we ate the left-overs for lunch the next day.  Making this ALL the time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Used an easy pizza dough recipe from this site and the rest of the recipe as is.  It was wonderful.  No leftovers!  That says it all.  The fennel is an important ingredient.  That's what took this recipe over the top for me.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  A keeper.

Good, but not what I remember of Chicago pizza--mainly the crust.  Was a bit letdown but it was a good pizza.  I did let the cheese dry out in the fridge and let tomatoes drain well as others suggested.  Precooked crust about 10 minutes. Used pepperoni not sausage and mushroom due to our family's preference

This pan pizza is exceptional. Cooked exactly as described. I did not precook the dough and it came out just great. Next time, I would grease the pan w/ butter instead of olive oil. I will experiment with toppings. Family loved it. Sharing it with others.

Excellent!  Tastes just like true Chicago-Syle.  I was scared it would be soggy so I used a 10" spring form pan so I wouldn't have to dig it out of the pan, but not necessary, it wasn't soggy.  The ol man raved about this dish and he's very picky!

I really liked this. I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned how difficult it is to get the bread dough in the pan. It was like elastic. I greased the pan and put a little cornmeal in as suggested.  I made this recipe exactly as it appears (except I did pre-bake the crust for 15 minutes). It was very good. I think next time I will add a bit of pizza sauce (maybe not Chicago style anymore, but I think I would like it)... just a cup or so mixed with the sausage.

Made this last Friday for our Family Fun Night.  My husband LOVED it and requested that I make it tonight (and he doesn't even like tomatoes).  My 9 yr, old did not like the tomatoes.  I may try with pizza sauce next time.  I forgot to pre-bake the bread, but I used the refrigerated dough because I couldn't find the frozen one.  The crust was cooked all the way through, so I will keep using the refrigerated dough from now on.  Also, tonight I will put a little flour in the baking dish to keep the pizza from sliding OR I will use my cast iron pan.  This is a keeper!  Oh yeah, I added pepperoni and it was yummy!

I thawed my frozed dough but I wasn't sure if I was to let it rise or not. I went on faith that I should thaw it and roll it out.... and I was right! Whoever said it was really bready must have let the bread dough rise. This pizza was so good I had to fight my husband off when I sent a slice over to a friend. He said it was much better than Pizzaria Uno and my kids loved their plain cheese and sauce version. I am looking foward to experimenting with other toppings.

Received this recipe via email and just made last night. This was absolutely the best pizza I have ever had. I could honestly compare to one you would buy at Pizza Uno. My entire family loved it. I purchased a ready made pizza dough from my local pizzeria and used it. They sold it to me for $2! This is definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for sharing!

Really good recipe.  Used a cast iron pan, rather than a baking dish.  Substituted romano cheese instead of parmesan.  I wonder if a little bit of green pepper would work, as this combo is pretty perfect already.

We've tried many home recepies for pizza, but this is definately the best.  I usually like thin crust pizza, but the frozen loaf bread is awesome.  I might hold back on the sausage and do a veggie next time, but still it's great.

Really Really Good and easy to make.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Next time though I will add some garlic to the mushrooms and onions as it needed just a little of that zip.

I have never reviewed any recipes or, anything for that matter, But this was great. I was leary because of the lack of red sauce but you really dont need it. I used 2 make your own pizza crust, and added pepperoni and black olives and also used fresh garlic(4 cloves crushed). Very, very, gooooooood.

This recipe is sooooo gooooood!  I am a true pizza lover.  I like them thin and crispy, easy on the meat.  But a trip to Chicago and I was sold on the deep dish, meaty cousin of the original pie.  Dis I mention, this recipe is sooooo gooooood!

I had to try this recipe because I saw it getting tossed around a lot on the Recipe Exchange lately.  I made 2 (yes, 2) for dinner tonight.  I pre-baked the crust for 15 minutes, as suggested by many other reviewers.  I also used Italian Seasoning instead of oregano, because that's what I had.  I didn't really measure the seasonings, just guesstimated.  This was perfect.  My husband could NOT stop raving about this pizza!  I will ABSOLUTELY make this again!  Thanks!

I haven't tried this yet, but plan on making it tomorrow night. the site won't let me enter my comments without a rating so that is why I rated it before actually making it. I thoroughly agree with the writer who stated "if you alter the recipe--write your own rather than a review with changes.  That is my biggest complaint about this site.  Especially those who make many changes!!!!

Best pizza I've made yet.  It was so good, I made it again a few days later.  I put different toppings in.  I tried the true recipe, then tried baking the crust a little first, mine was fine both ways. Not as think as I thought it would be, but juicy and gooey, so yum!

I have to say, I really didn't like it the night we made it.  I had to eat the leftovers later in the week, I heated them up and it was sooooooooo amazing!  You could absolutely make ahead and freeze this one!

Best homemade pizza ever! Everything was perfect! Added bell peppers to dazzle it up a little. Will experiment with other ingredients next!

This was a great recipe! Admittedly, I've never even tasted real Chicago-style pizza and this was the first time I've tried this kind of recipe, but it was good! I did it as one of my freezer recipes--I cook 24 meals once a month and freeze them until use---and it worked great! Even my kids liked it. =)

Tasted great, but had a hard getting the dough to cover the pan.  I finally had to roll it out with a rolling pin. I didn't see that mentioned by anyone else so maybe I did something wrong.

Thanks for this recipe. We used left over shreadded chicken with the other ingredients minus the recommended meats. It came out wonderfully. The crust surprised us but was thick and crusty. Will definately make this one again.

The recipe for this topping is absolutely wonderful! We loved it! So much better than premade pizza sauce, and the spices are perfect. But, next time I will make my own dough. I bought premade from the store, and it was not good and spoiled the greatness of the topping.

You definately have to pre-bake this crust and it was just ok.  Will try this same pizza with a different crust. I'm from Chicago and a huge Lou Malnatis fan and this was close, just not it yet.

The dough makes THREE pizzas in a 9 inch cake pan (I read the other's troubles with the too thick bread). I also used whole wheat flour to make it more nutritious, and I put cheese on the dough, then a layer of veggies, then homemade tomato sauce on top with a little parmesan cheese. It was absolutely delish.

I can't comment on the taste of the dough according to the recipe because wheat flour has its own taste, but it did taste like it was missing a little something.

All in all, I thought it was great!

I used the pizza dough I recipe rather than frozen bread. I used mozzarella in the middle and a bit of sharp cheddar on the top & left out the fennel but added a1/2 tsp basil.   I also add green olives sliced & marinated artichokes.   This recipe is delicious

The pizza was delicious and I have made it several times in the past month.  I used a 10 inch cast iron frying pan instead of a 9 x 13 pan.  The crust was too small to come up
The sides as high as high as I would have liked. I substituted a different dough recipe last time with much better results.

This is one of my favorite Allrecipes recipes.  It’s quick and easy.  This pizza is thick so be sure to precook the dough for 15 minutes before adding the toppings.  I’ve made it in a cast iron skillet and it’s great that way too.  I usually make two at a time and freeze one for later.  It reheats well in the oven.  It’s better than any takeout pizza anywhere in my vicinity.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was awesome! I made it just as called for. I did take other reviewers advice and prebake the crust for 15mins, let the cheese sit in the fridge uncovered and mixed the spices with the tomatoes and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours. All good tips!

Wow, was this great! The flavors of the sautéed veggies with fennel & garlic were so good & the amount of filling to dough was perfect! I skipped the sausage & added roasted red peppers but it was still so flavorful & yummy! I'll definitely be making this again! (I used an iron skillet as shown in many of the photos, not the 13x9 casserole the recipe says.)

This pizza is awesome. I used a cast iron skillet as another reviewer recommended. My pan is 10 inches in diameter and since it takes my oven longer to cook, I cooked this for 35 minutes. The only thing I would change next time is the crust. Store bought crust tastes a lot like crackers to me. I also added pepperoni as a mid layer , putting some cheese down on top of the sausage, then pepperoni, then the remainder of the cheese, then the sauce topped with fresh Parmesan cheese. I let the cheese air dry in the fridge as another reviewer recommended (2 hours). The cheese came out nice and stringy, like you experience at a pizza place. I also mixed the sauce in advance (2 hours) to let the flavors blend. New: I just made it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust on this site and it was awesome. Also, don't worry about draining the tomatoes so much. It needs the sauce if you layer it properly, per instructions. Some fixin's I've used include: sausage, pepperoni, banana pepper, and I sliced a tomato and put on top. I'd like to add spinach next time for some added color and flavor.

Love this recipe! I skipped the fennel seeds (didn't have them), mushroom and onion. I've tried it with sausage & pepperoni (liked pepperoni better). Also added some bell peppers, basil & Italian seasoning to the tomatoes. For the crust I used the No Yeast Crust recipe from this site and pre-baked for 15 minutes. So delicious and very filling!

The  flavour alone is 5 stars but the overall recipe was disappointing. The pizza was watery. I made the same pizza a second time but I excluded the chopped tomatoes and used 3/4 cup tomato sauce instead. I was happy with the results.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the cheese only because that's the way I like pizza. Definitely cook the dough for 10-15 mins first, depending on the thickness. I used a large Cast Iron skillet. Super easy and so tasty!!

My husband and I loved this.  Made some changes-shallots instead of onions, fresh garlic sauted with the mushrooms, and added fresh sliced tomatoes after 30 min. and baked an additional 15 min.-perfect.

I made this in a 12 inch cast iron pan. I did use pizza dough instead of bread dough so I baked it at 375° for 30 minutes and it worked out very good. This was our first time having Chicago pizza, very filling, we all enjoyed it.

I thought this was delicious!  Definitely will continue to bake the crust first and will add more mushrooms.  The spices were perfect.

It was very good - but I think the name is a bit misleading.  It is more like Deep Dish French Bread Pizza.  It does call specifically for bread dough, not pizza dough, so keep that in mind before you choose this recipe.

I made this last night and it was gone.....QUICK!  I used a pilsbury pizza dough in the tube, sprinkled it with oregano/garlic powder, and pre baked it for 5 mins.  Then I put all of the toppings on and baked until the crust was brown and cheese was melted.  Although it was very good, it was missing something.  I don't know what....garlic maybe?  I don't know but I will surely make this again.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I and it was PERFECT! I received a magazine with this recipe and read a review to bake the dough first. If you put it in for 15-20 min before putting everything in to create the pizza, it keeps it from getting soggy. It was excellent- even the left overs were good!

I baked my homemade pizza dough first for 15 minutes in my cornmeal dusted pan. Then I followed the rest of this recipe exactly as written. My family and I came to the conclusion that this is the best TASTING homemade pizza we have ever eaten, however, "deep dish pizza" isn't for us. Next time I will just bake a 12" flat round pie instead. So, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because we really enjoyed the flavor of it.

Fantastic recipe! Have tried many at home pizzas & this is the best by far! My husband loved the recipe as is. I don't like sausage or mushrooms so I exchanged turkey pepperoni & fresh basil. Amazing both ways. Thank you for this recipe!

Even tho I have not tried it yet, I definitely will, and am anticipating at least 4 stars.  For Keithe...I disagree regarding your remark that folks should not post their tweaks to a recipe. It's always good to hear the pros and cons of any recipe.  If each person had to post their own recipe rather than mention the changes they made to this one, can you imagine the flood of similar recipes floating around??  Why have reviews if not for this purpose?

This is my very first review on this site.  This recipe is awesome!!  I had been wanting a recipe for deep dish for a long time and finally saw this one.  I made it exactly as it says except I did use a pillsbury pizza dough refriggerated crust (wheat) and prebaked the crust for about 10 to 15 minutes as other reviewers said and did add pepperonis and extra cheese.  It did not tell when to add the olive oil so I added it to the onion/tomato/mushroom mixture.  Very delicious - very happy with this base recipe - the crust was perfect, taste was good.  Thank you for posting this!

I made this exactly per the recipe.  It was excellent.  My family loved it and I will make it again.  The only thing I might try next time is a pizza crust versus the bread dough, which I thought was a little soft -- but still very good.

The best deep-dish pizza we've had, especially since we can make it ourselves.  My husband really liked it since it didn't have the usual tomato sauce on the crust.  Awesome the next day too.  Followed one of the chef's recommendations to re-heat in a skillet with a little loose foil on top.  Delicious pizza!  Thanks.

I do like the recipe's ingredients very much; however, using frozen bread dough as the crust & not having any tomato sauce (such as homemade from Roma tomatoes, or a good jar sauce) on top of the crust before adding the other terrific ingredients leads me to think this will not taste like a Chicago-style pizza that I love. It will be a very good pizza, of that I have no doubt; I love the fennel seed---very Italian addition, very tasty! :)

This is really really good except you need to bake the crust for about 10-15 minutes before putting on the toppings.  We always add more toppings since we like the "loaded" type and it takes a few more minutes to bake but oh so yummy!

Very good and very easy.   To make it easier, I buy diced tomatoes already seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil.  I'm using a springform pan also so cut the dough to 2/3, use less meat, cheese and 14 oz. can of the tomatoes.

This pizza was awesome. I wasn't sure if my son would like it as he is very picky. It doesn't call for sauce and he didn't like that so I put a little tomato sauce on his side and he loved it! He liked it so much that the next day he wanted another one and even made it himself...which never happens!

This is one of the best meals I've had in quite a while.  Both for ease of preperation and versatility.  Thanks so much!

Well done; nice recipe.  I simmered the juice from the tomates down to give the garlic, oregano and fennel seeds a chance to cook a bit longer.  Next time I'll add more fennel seeds, maybe a half teaspoon.  What a nice touch.

Excellent pizza!  I read the reviews and precooked the crust for 15 minutes and used a bit of olive oil to form the crust.  Also, I used my springform pan and built the crust up on the sides and added all the layers and drained the tomatoes well.  All I had to do was undo the pan and remove the sides and it was very easy to slice and eat.  Very yummy!!  My husband made the comment that he would eat this any day over Giordanno's.  :)

Wow! I made this for my family last night and everyone loved it.  To save time I used 2 Pillsbury pizza doughs and pressed them in a floured 9x13 pan. An excellent suggestion I followed, was to prebake the crust before adding the toppings.  The crust did rise some while baking, so I just pressed the toppings down into the crust when it was time to add them. This helped keep the shape of the crust in the pan.  So delicious, I will most definitely make this again.

Well, my experience with this dish was just so-so. It was kinda basic and the tomato "sauce" was bland.

Very good.  Will definitely make again but will use a pizza dough.  Yes, I did make changes only because of personal preference, used  only 1/2 pound sausage, added pepperoni to make up the difference.  The sauce was outstanding, did not add the fennel seed because I don't care for it and didn't have it (enough in the sausage).  I cooked the liquid out of the tomatoes instead of draining them.  Prebaked crust in a cornmeal coated cast iron pan as suggested.  So yummy and filling!  My husband works nights and he is going to love coming home to this!

Loved this recipe as is.  Next time I will try pre-cooking the crust a little, but I didn't and my family gobbled it up as is.  This will be a recipe that I will make often.  Loved

Great recipe, and easy too. Like others have said, be sure to drain the tomatoes well to avoid mush.  I like adding some diced red peppers too.  I usually wind up cooking just a few minutes longer than recommended because we like a more firm crust. This is a "can't miss" pie!

Very good recipe, I agree cooking the crust a little before you add the filling is a great tip.  Draining the tomatoes another wonderful tip.  My family loved it.  Thank you.

I love this recipe!!!! It is so flexible that you can adjust it to your own liking.  Here are some changes I made:  1)Pre-baked the pizza crust for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F before adding the topping. 2)Left out the onions, used double portions of mushrooms and mixed in some pasta sauce 3)drained out the juices from sauteed mushrooms and tomatoes 4)Put slices of fresh tomatoes and cut up whole chunks of mozzarella cheese on the very top .  OH YUMMMMMMMMMM :)

Love this recipe.  I use the "Pizza crust for Bread machine" recipe instead of bread dough.  I had a hard time manipulating the bread dough but the taste was fine.  I also simmer the sauce separately because we do half sausage and half pepperoni.  Overall, it's an awesome recipe and one that I've used several times.  My husband is a Chicago native and LOVES it!

Living in the deep south it is impossible to find a good pizza.  I only cook down one can of diced tomatoes and leave the juice in as it reduces.  I add extra seasoning all the way around because we do not eat pork and the ground beef needs the extra kick. This is a easy way to make  a great pizza at home. Still looking for the perfect thin crust.

When I first wanted a pan pizza recipe, I was looking for a Pizza Hut type recipe. I made this recipe in a bread machine and actually the bread machine could not handle all of the ingredients...so I took the dough out and continued to knead it myself. I then made the pizza according to the instructions and was actually not incredibly impressed.

Well... my crust didn't turn out well. Tough and burnt. Couldn't eat the bottom. Filling was good though. Won't make this again. Easier to use store bought crust, not worth all this work!

I had really high hopes for this pizza, and was seriously disappointed.  I followed the advice of others, and baked the crust for about 15 minutes prior to putting the toppings on, and it still turned out gooey and not quite "crispy".  The diced tomatoes make the crust sort of gummy and there is really no way to drain them enough to prevent this from happening.  I guess if I were to make it again, I'd eliminate the diced tomatoes and just use a little sauce.

I enjoyed this pizza.  The "crust" was a little strange since it tasted like white bread, of course.  I didn't tell my wife about the crust until we were half way through dinner.  She said she liked it more before she knew it was white bread, ha!

The family loved it, but I will drain the tomatoes better next time.  Too much liquid.  I will also add more cheese.
