A nice recipe from Peter Gerry. I made this for work and there was none left over for me.  A true hit on a rainy day. I was able to get by with 1 Tbs canola oil and teflon hot pot for browning.  Finished cooking in the slow cooker for about 4 hrs.

I personally like mashed potatoes better with this dish, so left the potatoes out.  I also cooked in a crock pot instead, High for 1 hour, then on low for 6 hours.  Very good comfort food!!

Yummy!  I also added the entire bag (32 oz.) of sauerkraut, juice and all.  I needed to simmer it for over 2 hours for the potatoes to be soft, but it was well worth the wait.  Thanks!

I'm going to rate this recipe a four because my husband enjoyed it and said it was a "keeper".  In my opinion, I think you need more kraut for the amount of meat and potatoes.  I used a 36 oz. bag (recipe calls for 22 oz.) and felt there could be more.  Next time I'll definitely parboil the potatoes as they were a bit hard.  Also, I might use a trick of Mom's by adding some shredded cabbage to the kraut to tone down the sourness as well as add more substance.

We're not caraway lovers, so I omitted it.  Added a peeled and diced apple to the pot.  It softens the kraut flavor and is excellent with the pork.  Also added a little beer one time, and white wine another in place of some of the 
kraut juice.                                    .....auf deutsch (delicious)

I made this for dinner tonight. I diced half an onion and 3 potatoes, cooked in 1 TBSP oil with a good sized "dollop" of pressed garlic, added 4 boneless pork loin chops, cubed, just over a teaspoon of caraway seeds, then added one can of sauerkraut with apples and half a can of water. Simmered on the stove for 45 minutes or so. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better. :)

Like others, I used an entire bag of sauerkraut.  I omitted the browning sauce and used chicken breast instead of pork. Very good for a cold winter night!

This is a very good recipe. I too think there should be more saurkraut-I used 32oz. Next time though I will use bavarian saurkraut as this will give this recipe just the right sweet-sour flavor I was looking for since it has that flavor to begin with. Slightly sweet but tart-but not too much of either. mmmmm I think that is the way it is supposed to be but with so many different types of saurkraut these days it can really affect the flavor. I also like to add a chicken bullion and a cup or 2 of water for richness and broth. If you don't like the flavor you can adjust it with either vinegar for tartness or brown sugar for sweetness. I like it to taste like New Years day-only with a broth!

I'm afraid the pork was not moist and tender, the potatoes were dry and there was not enought sauerkraut juice to help matters.  The recipe was not followed exactly; I did not use caraway seed or browing sauce and for the bonelesss pork loin, I used boneless pork loin chops.  I really didn't expect these modifications were that significant and that they ruined the recipe

I drain the juice from the kraut and replace it with chicken brouth.  Cuts the sourness of the kraut. Use jarred or packaged sour kraut, not the canned.  The canned picks up the taste of the can.

Who knew sauerkraut in a stew was good?! I used turkey sweet sausage instead of pork, added a couple chopped up carrots and rinsed the sauerkraut. I cooked it on the stovetop instead of a crockpot, so I added some chicken broth so it would not get dry. A keeper!  Thanks!

I quardrupled this stew for a youth shelter in Alaska's Capital city. The staff loved and and said it was the perfect Octoberfest stew. I added bratwaursts as well. It was very good with sour cream.

Not bad, but not spectacular. It does have a nice sweet flavor though that I don't usually associate with sauerkraut. My daughter (1yo) enjoyed it. My husband and I liked it, but aren't in love with it.

Not bad use of left overs, but otherwise a rather unimpressive meal in taste and appearance.

To bland. You could use the pork for a different meal. The recipe could have used a polish sausage instead of the pork. Also the browning sauce was not right for this dish. Will try again but not with the pork or browning sauce.

I thought that the smell was horrible and it tasted just as bad.  Will never make it again!  What a waste of food.

This was so  yummy!  I only had one pound of pork meat, so I subbed the rest with sliced brats.  I did not need to use any oil when frying them up.  I also added some garlic, carrots, celery, applesauce, and I used 32 oz of sauerkraut and added some chicken broth to add more moisture.  Also added some dumplings on top!  Next time I will parboil the potatoes first, as they seemed to take a long time to soften.  This stew is even better as a leftover after all the flavors have marinated for a day.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm sorry, but this was awful. I choked down a bowl because I was starving, but I threw the rest away. I am a hard core kraut MONSTER (I eat it by the handful straight from the bag/jar), but this recipe was much too sour. Rinsed or at least drained kraut  would have been much better, with an apple or brown sugar or something.

Very good, I cut the pork a little small but I will fix that next time.  I did add a half of an apple.  My husband loved it, and I don't care for sauerkraut, but liked it also.

It came out exactly as i wanted it.  delicious.  I coated my pork chunks in flour with smoked salt and pepper and some seasoning salt before browning.  I left out the garlic.  but everything else was as written.  Usually i eat this over mashed potatoes, so adding potato chunks was different but I tried it and it was great.  It came out nice and thick and that dollop of sour cream before serving was an added delight.

This stew was absolutely wonderful.  My family loved it, even my daughter inlaw who doesn't like sauerkraut!
