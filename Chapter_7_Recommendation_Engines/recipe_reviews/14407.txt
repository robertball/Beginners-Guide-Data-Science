I have made this salad 3 times now and everyone loves it.
I did make a change however.  The first time I made this, I found out that I had no celery seed ( I could have sworn I did!) so I subbed dill weed for it and it's wonderful.
I also don't drain all the vinegar mixture as it gives the finished product a kick.
You will not be sorry with this recipe.

It seemed very unusual to marinate the potatoes especially with the sugar, but this recipe did not disappoint me. The obligatory, ubiquitous potato salads I have made for years seemed so blah. I had some really yummy potato salad at a salad bar the other night and was looking for a new recipe that came close to it. It seemed like it had celery seed in it and maybe some dill. The potatoes themselves also seemed to have something extra. I scaled this to make only ¼ of the recipe and added some dill weed and sour cream. I only marinated about 4 hours. It was plenty of time for the potatoes to soak up the marinade. It wasn’t as sweet as I thought it would be. I also threw in a couple of hard-boiled eggs even though the restaurant version didn’t have any. It wasn’t exactly like the one from the salad bar. In fact it may even have been better. I actually enjoyed eating the potato salad for a change. I will make this again.

I like this recipe mainly for the marinade.  I make my regular potato salad recipe and just marinate the potatoes first.  It does make the potatoes softer, so if you like your potatoes a little firmer, maybe this recipe isn't for you.  I really like the sweet and tangy flavor the marinade gives the potatoes.  It really penetrates the potatoes, so that the flavor isn't all in the mayo mixture.  I have made this for family gatherings and have received compliments on it.

Great recipe.  I have made this twice now - once for the home taste trial and again for an office party.  I followed the recipe except that I cooked the potatoes a bit longer than suggested (1/2 hour) by accident and I used 1 1/2 cups of water/vinegar/sugar for the marinade to better cover all the potatoes.
"Hands-down the best potatoe salad I have eaten in my 36 years on the planet." was the review via email from a co-worker later in the day.  This is the only potatoe salad recipe I will use from now on.  The vinegar/sugar marinade really imparts a wonderful flavor to the potatoes and the mayo/celery seed add the final touches.  Very simple and extremely tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for someone who likes the New York deli style potato salad of yore.  I have made it several times, as is and with minor changes; such as using a little dill juice from the pickle jar, a little less sugar.  The best time saver I have found is to buy a couple of boxes of store brand scallopped potatoes on sale, put the sauce envelope in the pantry and using only the dehydrated potatoes..boil them for about 15-16 min, then drain and put in bowl, pour marinade over the potatoes as per recipe.  Proceed with recipe and is best made the day before using.  Thanks, Bud.

This was a nice change from the usual potato-and-egg salad.  I used red potatoes with the skins on, and plain white distilled vinegar because that's all I had.  I also doubled the vinegar and water, and cut down the sugar, and marinated it for 4 hours.  It tasted great, tangy but not too sweet.  I also added dill weed and crumbled 2 pieces of bacon on it.  Excellent, will make again.

Easy good and sweet. I added some chopped celery and a little more mayo. Chilled the potatoes and vinegar 8 hours instead of 12.

I made this for a neighborhood barbecue yesterday. We all thought it was too sweet. We're all used to a more "typical" potato salad with crunch.

Very different potato salad with the vinegar base, but delicious!  Time consuming, but worth it for a great company side dish.

I made with for a Super Bowl Party with 22 people. It was a huge hit! I could not believe it  could be so tasty with so few ingredients. I think it makes more like 30 servings. We have been eating it for several days and it is still fabulous. I thought I would need to add pickles and mustard but to my surprise it tasted like they had already been added. Truly a keeper for a crowd or just a few!

I've made this 4 times over the summer and decided I love it because it reminds me of east coast potato salad, I LOVE vinegar and it's easy.  I've had to play with it a little to get the taste we like (for 2 and add eggs/pickles) to get the right vinegar/sugar/spice combo and I cheat and bake the potatos. I would make it for yourself before making a huge crowd to see if it's the type of potato salad for you.  The marinade doesn't taste the same as the finished outcome - so don't keep adding sugar like i did the first time! Thank you!!!

Loved this potato salad, but prefer to marinate just 3 to 4 hours. I use celery salt instead of regular salt and celery seed. Best made with red potatoes, red wine vinegar also works fine gives it a little more kick. Until I used this recipe I didn't like sugar or vinegar in our potato salad, the wine vinegar makes a world of differance. Be careful not to over cook the potatoes, they don't need to be as soft as with other recipes because they soften while marinating. I also add about a dozen eggs , can't imagine potato salad   without eggs.

I'd never made potato salad and was looking for an easy recipe for our wedding party.  It was great and there were no leftovers! I've made the recipe again and I've used both white and red bliss potatoes.  The salad has a nice flavor.

I was not thrilled with this recipe.  I put it out at a BBQ that we hosted this past weekend and no one touched it.  I guess I will continue searching for that ultimate potato salad recipe.

I MUST ADMIT THAT I DID TRY THIS DISH BECAUSE I COULDNT IMAGINE THAT POTATO SALAD COULD BE GOOD WHEN SOAKED IN SUGAR,VINEGAR,AND WATER. WHAT A SUPRISE. ITS THE BEST I EVER HAD . ALTHOUGH THIS A  PLAN AHEAD DISH ITS WORTH IT. IT HAS ALOT OF   ZING WITHOUT ANY EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS.

Diana, thank you so much for posting this recipe. My mother used to make the best potato salad, among other things, and unfortunately, I never wrote the recipe down or paid too much attention when she was making it...just couldn't wait to eat it. She passed away recently and I never got the recipe. This is exactly how hers tasted and looked. Sometimes, simple is bestl. Thanks again so much and best to you in 2010!  Carmel

I hate to bag a family recipe. Honestly. But I thought this tasted very "store bought". The vinegar/sugar taste overwhelmed the mayo and actually made the potatoes sickeningly sweet. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. Took it to a 40 person bbq and it was hardly touched. Maybe it would be okay if you didn't soak the potatoes? I don't know. But I'm not going to find out.

Diana your dad is a culinary god. This recipe was incredibly easy to make and our 8 guests licked the bowl. The white wine vinagar and sugar is a wonderful marinade and makes the potatoes incredibly flavourful. The only down side is having to peel the potatoes and waiting for it overnight. Give our thanks to your dad. Mark & Kerry - London

This recipe is delicious!  I sauteed one chopped onion and a clove of garlic in a bit of butter and added it to the recipe along with some chopped hard boiled eggs.  This is the potato salad I'll be making from now on.  Thank you!

Excellent!  At first, I couldn't believe the recipe.  How could this have such high ratings, with hardly any ingredients?  But after trying it, I realized you don't NEED any other ingredients - the flavor is rich and fabulous.  I used red potatos, and left the skin on.  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great!  I got TONS of rave reviews.  I added boiled eggs, sweet pickles, a little less mayo and some mustard (cause that's just how you make it in my area).  I will make my potato this way ALL the time now!

This is a really great recipe. I am not usually a fan of potato salad, but I LOVE this recipe, as has everyone who has tasted it. I highly recommend it for those who love potato salad and even for those who don't, because you will after you taste this! I should add that I also put in a few hard boiled eggs, which makes it even better.

Overall the recipe was disappointing.  Visually it wasn't appealing and the taste was fairly bland.  My guests barely touched the potato salad and no one had seconds.  I will stick with the ranch potato salad.

Excellent recipe, never would have believed it with these unusual ingredients, and I was never a big potato salad fan...'til now. Added green onions, parsley, little cilantro for color, little less mayo & sugar, & added a little red pepper, as well.  Fantastic!!

Good stuff!!!! I added some chopped celery and sweet relish... will probably just add the relish next time.  Never heard of doing potato salad this way, but i LOVE the tangy sweetness the marinade gives the potatoes.  Will definitely be my go to method from now on, thanks! :)

This was the most original potato salad that I'd ever tasted!  It's fast and easy, too.  Very refreshing on hot days and goes well with most any meal.  Great for those of us who don't like eggs in their potato salads.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add a couple of hardboiled diced eggs to it. It turned out really well and was a hit at our cook out. Just a reminder - make sure to give yourself plenty of time to marinate the potatoes. It's definitly worth the extra time!

I'm not a real potato salad fan, so when someone asked me to bring potato salad to a potluck, I thought I'd try something different from the usual mayo and mustard concoction. This was a little more work than ordinary potato salad, but I thought it was worth it. I was concerned that it would be a little unusual for some people, but everyone liked it and several people requested the recipe. Thanks for a good recipe.

This recipe rocks!!! I have always wondered how I could get more flavor in the potatoes themselves. I thought marinating them would make them all mushy. I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it is superb. I added some hard boiled eggs though. We love it!!!

Excellent!!!  I think marinating the potatoes is key to the recipe.  I used red potatoes and added 5 hard boiled eggs, a jar of pickles (shredded), and a tsp of dijon mustard in addition to the basic recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Good but need to cut the sugar to 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.  Was too sweet.  Start with 1/4 of the sugar called for and add until desired sweetness

The marinade is the key to this recipe.  Otherwise I actually used low fat mayo with low fat sour cream which worked perfect.  I also added hard boiled egg.  it was delish.

The marinade really sets this one apart.  I took other reviewers' advice and use about half the mayo.  For me, potato salad MUST have hard-boiled eggs and celery, so I add about 4-6 eggs and about a cup of celery (in addition to the celery seed). I also marinade the onions along with the potatoes. This doesn't last long at my house!

Potato salad lovers...GO with this one! Excellent with no leftovers on a boat party! Minor changes personal taste. Scaled it back to half recipe, using one 5lb bag RED potatoes, scrub, leave peels on (easy!) cubed to about 3/4" size, simmered in tall large skillet salted water until firm (not mushy!)about 12-15 minutes. Marinated overnight in ziplock bag. Used 1 small bunch green onions (only 1/2 green parts) & some red onion. I had to add eggs (5) & celery for crunch! Do NOT be afraid to marinate the potatoes...this is what makes this recipe so special! Maybe some posters did not drain the marinade off when they posted it was mushy or vinegary??? Just a thought...

This salad was great!  I used light mayo and didn't use the celery seed and my husband, who usually says why did you make so much potato salad said, why didn't you make more of this??  I used 5 pounds of potatoes and halved the amounts for the marinade.  I will make this again and again!

I was very skeptical as I am a big fan of a traditional potato salad, but I was in the mood to try something new.  This recipe is fabulous!  I liked the sweet/tangy flavor the sugar vinegar bath gave it, but I also like that I had to use less mayo, but still ended up with the creamy consistency I like.  I did add mustard, eggs, and bell pepper as that is my personal preference.  Thank you for this "secret recipe" potato salad.  A new favorite!

This was VERY good!  I was sceptical about lemon juice in potato salad... my hubby's a mayo/mustard potato salad guy, so this was a gamble.  I couldn't get him out of the bowl!  Best the day of making, after a day or two, the eggs taste hard & the dressing is absorbed too much for it to be real creamy anymore.  Great for company & picnics! Will use often, that's certain!

What a great potato salad recipe--I didn't change a thing.  I've made it several times, and it's the only recipe I'll use from now on.  The hot sugar/vinegar marinade is what makes it great.  And it makes a ton!  I may never make the straight mayo/hard-boiled egg variety again.  Thanks for sharing.

THIS HAD JUST A LITTLE DIFFERENT TWIST TO IT. THE SWEET MARINADE WAS A GOOD ADDITION, ADDING THAT SUDTLE SWEETNESS THAT I LIKE IN POT. SALAD

Very good potato salad.  I like the sweet and tangy flavor of the marinated potatoes.  I used green onions, instead of regular yellow or white, because I had some on hand that needed to be used.  I also added some chopped boiled egg to the salad (because that is one of the the things I like about my own recipe).

Excellent flavor!  I added some finely chopped red pepper for a bit of color.  Really nice for a change from "traditional" potato salad.

My husband liked this quite a bit, it was too sweet for me though.  I guess I prefer a more traditional potato salad taste, with more crunch.  This was sweet along the lines of deli potato salad.  My husband did like it enough though, that he would want it again.

I am a picky potato salad person so I'm giving this 4 stars...I've yet to have a 5 star (perfect) potato salad. I followed this recipe exactly and the day after it sat in the vinegar, we did as it said, drained the vinegar mixture and added the mayo, onion, etc. My husband and I thought it was okay but we could still really taste the vinegar. The taste was OKAY. Then, we let it sit another day with the mayo and it was DELICIOUS the next day. I would therefore make this 48 hours prior to serving...the day before with the vinegar mixture, drain, then add all the rest of the ingredients to it and allow it to sit another day. It is definitely worth the time if you have it! I would say this is definitely one of the best recipes so far!

I didn't like this recipe.  It reminded me too much of German potato salad which I don't care for.  The vinegar overpowered all the other flavors in the salad.  I made the recipe as is except I added eggs.  I made it for a gathering and some people did like it, but I know I won't make it again.  It's too vinegary.  This is a good starter recipe if you skip the vinegar/sugar/water bath and add other spices to flavor it.

I was starting to get frustrated with potato salad recipes-- they were all turning out bland for me, and being the only person who can cook in my family, I gotta come through at barbecues. This totally did the trick. I marinated for three hours, used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo (those of you who are wary about the sweetness wouldn't be advised to do this, I guess, but I think mayo is so bland in salads), and celery salt to taste instead of salt and celery seed. It was very good the first day and restaurant quality day two. Thanks for getting me out of my potato salad slump!

I really didn't like this recipe; I found it very very sweet to the point were it was just overwhelming. I made this during the weekend when we had people over for lunch - not one of us like it.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my potatoes came out SUPER soupy. I drained the marinade off, but I did something wrong, I guess. The flavor of the marinaded potatoes was AMAZING. I was really nervous when I used the vinegar and sugar, but it was SO good in the potatoes! I should have just left it like that and not added the mayo! Anyway, give it a shot!

This was good.  I halved the recipe and used onion and garlic salt instead of diced onions.  Sprinkled with paprika.  Next time I may substitute some of the mayo for ranch dressing or plain yogurt.

This is absolutely a hit.  The first time I made it everyone loved it and now it is one of my more requested dishes.  In fact, I made it three times in less than two weeks for different get togethers.  It has great flavor and the leftovers are even better.

This was my first attempt at a potato salad.  I really liked it, but a few others complained about the sweet/vinegar flavor.  Next time, I will leave out the celery seed -- didn't care for that.

I made this recipe for a small crowd so I had to cut it in half. I did add dijon mustard to the mayo and it was really good. Next time I'd use less mayo. Overall, great salad! Thanks for sharing. By the way, I'm not sure there should be a kid rating for potato salad, they really don't like any potato salad.

I made this a couple of weeks, and they literally licked the serving bowl clean! Am making it today for Memorial Day picnic tomorrow. Was confused abut using 10# potatoes for 10 people, so I only used 10 potatoes and served 12.

I have 23 coming tomorrow, so am going to use the entire 10# (25 potatoes). Wish me luck!

my husband loved this. I've tried all sorts of potato salad recipes, and though he always says that it tasted good, he's never asked me to make any of them again.. until now!

This was a terrific salad, tangy and sweet and just perfect.  Even my brother, who was afraid to eat anything I cooked due to past experience (far distant past, thank you) LOVED it.  A very nice variation on the standard.

Very tasty.  I was a bit surprised by the bite from the vinegary marinade.  I added a handful of shredded carrots to dress it up.  Also, I substituted crushed fennel seed because I didn't have celery seed.

My new favorite way to make potato salad!  I took this to a family gathering last month, and not one bite was left! 
Due to a time constraint, I only marinated the russet potatoes for  4 hours - it was enough - and then followed the guidelines for the dressing, although I added chopped eggs, only 1 onion and fresh celery (finely chopped).  Absolutely delicious!  The key is in the marinade!  Thanks, Diana_Leslie for sharing your Dad's recipe!

While this was really tasty, I'm wondering if I could've achieved this flavor with Miracle Whip and additional sugar.I'm just not quite sure, but don't know if I will continue to marinate potatos for potato salad. Don't get me wrong; it is good, just don't know if worth the lengthy (though easy) prep. If you enjoy sweet salads I'd give this a try. UPDATE: hubby just told me he didn't care for it; he loves german potato salad and sweet dishes of the like. He  told me to stick with the gourmet deli and skip the hassle of making my own

This is a good base but is bland - I have the answer!  Add a couple tablespoons of Italian Dressing to taste!  It's as simple as that!  I also used the suggestion of another reviewer and added sour cream to create a creamier texture without adding the mayo taste!  Thanks bunches!

I only needed a small batch of potato salad for a luncheon so I cut this down to six servings.  It turned out delicious, everyone enjoyed it and there was only a tiny bit left.  I did not have celery seed so I used some diced celery instead and I have to say I liked the added crunch it gave to the salad. This is a keeper!

I love this potato salad.  It is a perfect side dish to so many yummy dishes, such as bbq beef or pork, a grilled chicken breast or even Louisiana Turkey Gumbo, yum :)  I'm still looking for a copycat recipe of a local version with eggs, mayo & mustard, a creamy yellow "mashed potato" consistency that is smooth and tangy on the tongue.  "Wayne's BBQ" makes it like that and sometimes it's served cold and sometimes still warm.  It's that fresh!  And it's great either way.  Anyway, Bud's version is one I've made many times and making tonight.  I scale back the recipe, but enough for leftovers, cause it's good both ways, warm or cold.

Absolutely fabulous- the best potato salad I have ever tasted! The only thing I change is that I put in far less mayonnaise than the recipe calls for- maybe 1/2 a cup- since the potatoes hardly need anything else after all that wonderful marinating.  If I'm out of celery seed, I leave it out, and this salad is still amazing.  Thanks!!!

I didn't have the 12 hours to marinade the potatoes that the recipe calls for, but 5 hours still tasted great.  I added dill and celery and used celery salt instead of salt.  My husband thought it was a little sweet, but liked it.  I think it's one of the best I've tasted, and I'll definitely be making it again - I've already been asked to bring it to a potluck.

This is the BEST recipe.  I used rice vinegar in place of white wine vinegar and it was delicious.  I also added some mire-poix and sweet pickles it was absolutely wonderful.  I loved the idea of marinating the potatoes ahead - it gave it a extra special flavor.

This was simply not up to par. The flavors were bland even though I took the advice of other reviewers to leave the potatoes in the marinade. And to take the potatoes out before they get soft is a HUGE mistake.

I found this recipe on this site ages ago! I've been making it ever since. Every time I make it, it just disappears. It is one of my most requested things to bring to any BBQ or get together!! I often do not use chopped onion, but will sub with onion powder. The celery seed makes all the difference and using the white wine vinegar gives it a better flavor than just white vinegar. I will continue to make this and pass it down to my daughters!

I've made this potato salad a few times now to to take to gatherings, and my friends keep asking me to make it.  In addition to the celery seed, I added fresh dill, and instead of all mayonnaise, I used half mayo and half sour cream.  Best potato salad EVER.  No joke.

Excellent recipe! I was looking for a potato salad similar to what you'd find in a deli, and this fit the bill perfectly! I scaled it down to 5 servings because that's all I needed. I didn't discard the marinade. I tossed the potatoes around a few times, and they absorbed it. Also, some reviewers mentioned it was too sweet, so I cut back on the sugar a little, and it was still sweet enough for me. It is the sweetness though, that makes it different (in a good way) from standard potato salads. I also added some finely chopped celery and a chopped, hard-boiled egg. I was short on mayo, so I added plain Greek yogurt to compensate. Thanks DIANA_LESLIE for sharing your Dad's recipe! It's a keeper! And...GO PATS!!!!

I only use  the marinade part of this recipe. It is however,The Secret to consistantly awesome potato salad.  Start with the marinade process, then choose your add ins according to your families taste, then finish off with Mayo. No need to fiddle with vinegar, mustard or sugar trying to get your potato salad dressing perfectly seasoned. The marinade did all that work for!!!! Thank you Bud, I'll never make  potato salad any other way!!!

I made this potato salad to go with hamburgers one night, nice change over fries. The sauce is delicious! I added about 1/2 cup celery, four eggs and used red Yukon potatoes. It was delish!!!
