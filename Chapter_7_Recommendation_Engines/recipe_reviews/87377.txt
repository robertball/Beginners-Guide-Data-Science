This is an entirely delicious and new way of enjoying Rhubarb!  The crust part tasted like a shortbread cookie, and the rhubarb topping was very similar to a Rhubarb Custard Pie filling.  Go ahead, cut back the sugar, I used 2 1/2 cups, and that was fine for us.  I used all the butter called for in the crust, and I think this was a good call, as shortbread *has* to have that really buttery flavor.  I used frozen rhubarb, and that extended the baking time a good deal.  Keep baking until that runny texture becomes a soft custard. Don't use a smaller pan as one person suggested, especially when using the frozen rhubarb, that made the baking time so much longer that the corners browned quite a bit.  I think that adding a little more rhubarb could be a good thing, I think I will do that next time.  Cut to serving size while still warm, so that the crust isn't brittle, and then allow to cool even more before serving.  This allows the custard portion to firm up.  Give this recipe a try, you won't be dissapointed!

Yum.  I didn't think these would ever be done, but learned that they set and become firmer as they cooled (I cooked it 10 minutes longer as others had suggested and the middle was still runny, but took it out anyway so the crust didn't burn.  It firmed up to bar-consistency as it cooled).

This was great!  As others' suggested, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups (which was still very sweet) and baked it for an additional 10 minutes.

One new suggestion is to spray the sides of the pan with oil.  This will make for a lot easier clean up! The bottom does not need it because of the crust.

OMG! My husband who rarely gets excited about stuff like new recipes said that this was "a keeper!" I followed some of the suggestions of other cooks...used a generous 2 1/2 cups of sugar (instead of 3 )and probably a little more rhubarb (5 cups?). Also baked for about 10 mins. more the center custard seemed very loose at 35 mins. I would follow another suggestion to PAM the sides of the pan...I cut along the edges when they were hot so that they wouldn't stick too much. These are deliciousssss! Best if eaten the day you make them... they get a little runny as time goes on.

Excellent!!  I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier.   I used half white flour/half whole wheat in the crust.   Also used 3/4 c. margarine rather than 1 c. butter.   I used about 2 c. of sugar instead of 3 and it was plenty sweet enough.

I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, added an extra cup of rhubarb and baked an extra 20 minutes. Superb! Been trying to find a recipe that imitated the rhubarb squares at this great little farm stand, I think these fit the bill!

These were sooooooo good. Probably one of my favorite rhubarb desserts. I did have to up my baking time by 10-15 minutes to make sure the rhubarb was set and the crust was completely done. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were excellent!  I used 1 1/3 cups sugar, 1 cup Splenda, 1 1/2 cups white flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  I also used 5 cups rhubarb.  Baked crust for 14 minutes and bars for 40 minutes.  They set beautifully.  I did cut around the edge of the pan immediately upon removing from the oven.  Made clean-up and bar removal from the pan much easier.  

I took these to work and my co-workers raved!  They were gone within a very short time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe.  I reduced it to 2 cups of white sugar and it was still very sweet.  Next time I'll reduce it to 1.25 cups I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is to die for. Thank you for it. I did find that I had to cook it longer as it was too runny. Could be my oven though. Absolutely a best seller.

I do not usually rate a recipe, but in this case I am going to.  First, it's a very good recipe  Second, it's in the King Arthur Flour Cookie Companion cookbook . The crusts are a little different, as they use less flour and less butter and add 1/4 teas. each of salt and lemon oil or 2 Tbl of lemon zest. The filling does actually call for just 2 cups of sugar.  You are also supposed to beat the eggs with 1/4 teas of salt until foamy and beat your sugar in until it's thick and light yellow, then blend in the flour and fold in the rhubarb.  Then bake it for 40 to 45 minutes.  The filling is quite thick, so it isn't at all soupy.

One of my best rhubarb things yet!  I subbed 1/2c golden flax meal for 1/2c of the flour in the crust b/c I like the slightly nutty flavor (and extra fiber).  Halved the sugar in the rhubarb/egg mixture, and was a little generous in my rhubarb measurement.  REally a keeper.  I'm hoping they'll freeze ok.  I can't stop eating them.  Update-- it's 2 months later and they froze like a dream.. I cut them before freezing and put them between layers of wax paper in a plastic storage container.

This is so good!  I used 2C of sugar instead of 3, based on others feedback.  This recipe is easy to make and it taste wonderful.  I am already trying to think what else would be good with the crust.  Yummy! In 2 days, I have made this 3 times.  Our friends and family cannot get enough of this.  They all took the recipe home.  Thank you for sharing.    2 months later, I cannot tell you how many times I have made this.  I am addicted.  I only hope this taste as good using frozen rhubarb as it does fresh.  I froze 20 bags for this recipe to keep eating it.  I love this!

These were great and got asked repeatedly for the recipe!  I halved the ingredients though and still made them in a 13x9 pan.  They were thin but not too rich this way.  Also, I mixed 1/2 c oats + 2 Tbsp melted butter + 2 Tbsp brown sugar and sprinkled this on top before baking.  I had to bake them a little longer, but it was worth it!  The topping made the overall presentation better, and they were a huge success!

These were a good pinch substitute for a family recipe.  I did reduce the sugar in the topping to 2 cups and added about 1/4 cup local honey - still pretty sweet!  I used whole wheat flour and Smart Balance instead of all-purpose flour and butter and upped the rhubarb to an even 5 cups.  My finishing touch was to sprinkle the top with sugar before baking for a sweet crunch.  Mine had to bake an extra 10-15 minutes.  Definitely pre-bake the crust so it won't be soggy!  I'd recommend these for an easy way to use up rhubarb.

This is REALLY good. If you're looking for a great rhubarb recipe, this is it! I used 2 cups of sugar instead of three, and I promise you can't tell at all; it is still very sweet (probably because of the crust). I used a little over five cups of rhubarb, and thought it was perfect. Following others' suggestions, I baked for 45 minutes with wonderful results. I highly recommend this dessert!

Very goood rhubarb dessert, especially topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  A half cup less sugar and a half cup more rhubarb was all I did diffrently; otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  The only thing:  my husband is not a rhubarb lover, so the next time I make this, I will cut the recipe in half.  For now, I'll invite the neighbors over for coffee and dessert.  They'll love it!

My mom made these when I was a child.  I always double the crust and use some of it to top off the bars.  I have also used blueberries, instead of rhubarb.  I add in a little extra flour, because of the juiciness of the blueberries.

LOVE this recipe!  After making these a few times, I've found that they need to cook about 20 minutes longer to firm up.  I've also increased the flour in the filling to about 3/4 cup to help the filling firm up.  Without the extra flour, the taste is still spectacular, just a little runny.

I made this for my son's 2nd grade class so they could try rhubarb.  This was a perfect recipe as it only used rhubarb (not combined with other fruits) and it was still identifiable as such when finished cooking.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made it in an 11x14 cookie pan (I got 48 small bars).  It was a HUGE hit with the kids and several asked me to send their moms the recipe.  I will definitely add it to my regular spring rhubarb recipe collection!

After reading all the reviews.  I cut the sugar in half and added one cup of rhubarb and baked an extra 20 minutes.  I tripled the recipe because I had a ton of rhubarb to use and it was fine.  It made 2 1/2 large lasagna dishes.  It was gone in less than 2 days.  Everyone couldn't stop eating it.  Even my dad, who doesn't bring home leftovers, asked for some to take home.

Thank you for posting a new family favourite!  The only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 2C and I had a scant 4C of fresh rhubarb to add in.  In my oven they came out perfectly in 35 minutes and I did not have the filling stick to the pan as other have.  These are heavenly bars and I'm sure everyone will enjoy them as we did.

All I can say about this recipe is "WOW!".  What a great way to fix rhubarb -- the shortbread crust really enhances the flavors.  My husband loves rhubarb, pretty much anything rhubarb, but after he tasted this recipe, he said this is by far his favorite.  I fixed it with the ingredients listed, but sprinkled cinnamon on top for a little more color prior to baking.  I think next time I may add some tapioca to thicken it just a little, but otherwise, it is oh so delish!!  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Buttery crust and yummy rhubarb toping.  Exactly what I remember Mom making!  I used a jelly roll pan and made one and a half batches of the crust and added an extra cup of rhubarb to the topping.  I also only used 2 cups of sugar and baked it about 10 minutes longer.  Have made it 3 times (all with fresh rhubarb) with slight variations and all turned out well.

Excellent recipe.  I make it even better by adding 1-2 teaspoons of a very good vanilla.  The flavours of the bars are simple and uncomplicated, so the flavour of the vanilla really stands out.

Thank you Krista4! I'd give these a 10 if I could. I have memories of eating rhubarb bars like this as a child. My mom and grandma misplaced the recipe years ago. These are sooooo good. I only put in 2 cups of sugar like the others recommended, otherwise I didn't change a thing. Yum Yum!

These bars were great.  Everyone loved them. I did cut back a little on  the sugar, though.  My dad and husband raved about them all weekend!

My family loved it so much, I had to make another batch the very next day! I used frozen rhubarb, so I added 1/2 cup more flour & only 2 cups sugar to the rhubarb mixture. I also baked it for 45 minutes.

Altered the sugar a bit as was a suggestion.  The bars were great.   They were a hit at the barbeque.  Thanks for a great recipe!  It's a keeper!!

Excellent.  The only thing I HAD to change was the eggs because I didn't have 6, I only had 5, but the recipe still turned out fantastic.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves rhubarb pie.  You won't be disappointed!

I loved the flavor of the crust and filling.  I cooked this an additional 15 minutes however this never set up and was still slightly soupy which is why I gave it only 3 stars.  After slicing and removing a bar, the liquid would pool in the empty area.

Agreed with other reviewers:
10 min extra for baking
non-stick spray sides of pan
2 cups of sugar sufficient

This was my first attempt at bars and they were what I would consider a gourmet comfort food result. My boyfriend is a country boy and he said this was better than any rhubarb his mother had ever made (!!!).

I did swap out 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the white, and added chopped up crystallized ginger to the mix as I folded in the rhubarb. Made a lovely, complex flavour and the ginger mellowed when cooked. The shortbread bottom layer which I was worried about turned out light and delicious. This is a winner that I will make again for sure :-)

This was excellent, even though I was not sure how it would turn out. I used raw sugar instead of white, coconut and soft whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose for more minerals and fiber. Very good, I could not stop eating more than one! o yes, only 1 and 1/2cups of sugar was enough!

Way too much sugar in the rhubarb!!  I dropped it down to none and just let the icing sugar in the crust speak.  Still good but only for the people that like the tartness.  Then I tried about 1/2 a cup and a drizzle of maple syrup - excellent.  Very quick and simple recipe!!

This was delicious, but I cut the white sugar down to 2 1/4 cups and next time I will probably cut the powdered sugar in the crust down to 1/2 cup.  I also had to cook it about 15 min longer and the center was still not completely set.  I LOVED the final result.  The shortbread crust with rhubarb custard was fantastic.

These were good. The rhubarb was tangy and great, even though I dropped the sugar to 2c. There was too much goo, though, so we had to eat most of the "bars" with a fork.

This is a great recipe and exactly what I was looking for. I did make a few changes though... I made 1 1/2 times the recipe for the crust. I used a large jelly roll pan which was about 11 x 17.. I didn't change the rest of the recipe except for only using 2 cups of sugar(thanks to all that suggested that!). 
   I loved how they turned out and everyone else that has tried them really liked them as well. 
       thank you!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe that I could make and use some of my frozen rhubarb.  This recipe uses ingredients that you already have on hand...and the result is wonderful!  I also used only 2 cups of sugar and it is just great.  Thanks for having such a great recipe on your site!

I brought these to a party and heard nothing but raves about them.  The white sugar was cut back to 2 cups, as others had recommended, and my baking pan is a little smaller at 8"x11" so I had to bake each layer longer than specified, especially the rhubarb mix layer. This made the bars very high, moist and almost irresistible looking.  Easy, Easy to put together and a total winner!

I was going to rate these lower, at first - but they improve with age...and with whipped or ice cream! I used the 2 cup sugar advice (thank you) and baked them 45 minutes. Also, I was a little short on rhubarb (only about 4 cups), but didn't seem to make a difference. I made these yesterday for a coffee I had this morning and everyone loved them. A nice change for rhubarb and will make again!

The reviews on this one are well deserved...this makes about the easiest most buttery crust base I have come across - could not be simpler to put that together.  The rhubarb topping also is easy to put together and comes out quite well.  Modifications: I cut sugar down to two cups (per other reviewers), and substituted splenda entirely for the sugar.  Also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg to the rhubarb mixture - it adds a subtle spice flavor that is lovely, but not overpowering.  The last modification I made was with baking time: I needed about 3-5 minutes more than the suggested 35.

All in all, a GREAT recipe, and one that will help you go through the tons of rhubarb that comes up in the garden!!

My husband loves this recipe.  He has asked me to make it twice in the last week, and eats it ALL within 24 hours. We sometimes put a scoop of ice cream on top and some whipped cream, but this is great stuff.  Thanks.

Wonderful!The short bread crust makes this recipe. I also increased cooking time by 10 minutes and had a gooey cookie. I refrigerated these bars overnight before lifting them out of the pan to take to a picnic.

Made this for a family supper yesterday and it turned out very well! 

I used 2 cups of sugar rather than 3 and I think it still would be sweet enough if you only used 1.5cups of white sugar.  I also added 1tsp of apple pie spice and used 5 cups of rhubarb. It needed about 5 extra minutes in the oven as well. 

Excellent dessert. Will make again.

Oh, so yummy! I love the tart rhubarb with the sweet, buttery crust! I only added about 1.5 cups of white sugar to the custard and probably close to 6 cups of rhubarb. I love rhubarb so being able to taste it over the sweetness was exactly what I wanted! I had to add another 10 minutes to baking time as well, then it set up nicely as it cooled. Delish!

Excellent with just a few changes - cut back on the butter, sugar, and salt.  Used 3/4 cup butter - very cold cut into flour and powdered sugar using a food processor.  Used 2 cups white sugar - plenty.  1 tsp of salt was plenty.  Also - did not have enough rhubarb so used 1/2 blueberries - very nice!!

This was very tasty, but I had to bake it twice since it didn't couldn't complete the first time.  Flavors were great though!

Delicious! I only use 1.5 c of sugar in the egg mixture.  If you're on a diet, do not make these! Once I have one, I can't stop myself.

Very good new rhubarb recipe for me! I used only 1 3/4 c. sugar in the filling and will probably use 1 1/2 c. next time. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour in crust. It took about 45 min. to bake, also. I will definitely make this again!

These bars are very tasty. Next time I will cook the crust a shorter amount of time at beginning. When I added the filling and baked, the crust got too dark when the filling got done. It isn't the prettiest looking dessert either, so that is why I put whipped topping on it.

I'm not really sure how to rate these... pretty low I guess. The taste was amazing. And I will use this crust recipe for many things. Delicious! But even despite cooking much longer than suggested, the bars were still on the runny side. I temped them and they were at a temperature higher than needed to cook eggs, so they were not going to get stiffer than that. It reminds me a lot of pecan pie filling, but the rhubarb is too wet (I used fresh) so I just could not get it to fully set. I had a tasty but messy dessert that I did not feel comfortable serving to guests (rhubarb juice can look a bit greenish, so this really was not appetizing looking at all.)

Well, looking for something that people who don't really love rhubarb will eat, this is it.  Even those of us who do like rhubarb thought it was pretty yummy too.  It was very good.  Followed the recipe, except I did bake 15 minutes longer.  If you add extra rhubarb it will be runny!

I made several adjustments similar to others to make this more healthy.  I used half whole wheat flour and half whole wheat pastry flour.  I used only about 1 and 3/4 cups sugar.  It was a wonderful recipe.  Better than I could have imagined.

So Good!  Cut sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Took longer than 35 min to bake.  Was going to bring to church but they were too runny to put on a bar tray.  Oh well, guess we have to eat them all ourselves!

This recipe is so easy and tastes great! I've made it several times for family parties, funeral receptions, etc., and everyone LOVES it. In fact, it has become one of the most in-demand desserts at dinners with my husband's family, which is saying something because he comes from a family of great cooks and bakers.  Sometimes, if I want to change things up a bit, I add some strawberries and reduce the amount of rhubarb. I've had good luck with 1/2 cup and 1 cup of strawberries (changing the recipe to 3 1/2 cups and 3 cups of rhubarb, repectively).

Ok this recipe is "To Die For". LOVED IT and so did everyone who tried it. I took the advice of others and cut the sugar to two cups and added more rhubarb (5cups) and they were PERFECT. Certainly would not have wanted them any sweeter. They disapeared and I am already craving more. This is a MUST TRY recipe for rhubarb.

These were terrific!  My husband is a big fan of rhubarb custard pie, and he says these are EVEN BETTER...very high praise indeed!  I, too, used a bit more rhubarb, and a little less sugar, like others suggested; I also greased the sides of the pan as suggested.   Will definitely be making this one again!

I followed the directions pretty closely, but I did add an extra cup of rhubard and  1/2 cup less sugar plus I added 20 minutes to the cooking time otherwise it would have been very runny.I didn't have butter so I subbed 1/2 cup soft margarine, 1/2 cup shortening. It turned out super good, especially with vanilla ice cream. Will make this again as long as my rhubarb is producing!

This recipe looked so yummy sounding, but I was a little disappointed. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups...still tasted sweet. And I ended up baking it for about 50 minutes instead of 35. I still feel that it could have baked longer.  Next time I make this, because I love Rhubarb I'm going to try putting it in the fridge for an hour or more after it cools. The shortbread crust was amazing, but the custard part with the rhubarb didn't seem to go together. Next time, I'll try mincing the rhubarb, not chopping, which I think may allow the rhubarb and custard filling to mix together better effect.  I think it will also give it a more visually pleasing end result. Will try again soon!

Excellent use of Rhubarb.  I was looking for a way to use my rhubarb besides the usual pie or crisp, and this looked perfect.  I reduced the sugar in the filling to 2 cups, and next time, I'll use 1/2 the sugar in the crust.  I baked for an extra 15 minutes, and it was done perfectly.  The crust is still crisp a few days later.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent recipe. I followed the suggestion of adding more rhubarb - a little over 5 cups.  I think that was too much.  It turned out pretty watery/juicy and I baked it for 40 minutes so I'm wondering if its from increasing the rhubarb quantity. It still tastes delicious even though it's very runny. Thanks for the recipe.

Though I admit to being a novice when it comes to baking, this recipe did not turn out as described.  I followed the directions closely, and even allowed 15 minutes extra baking time as other reviewers suggested, but the rhubarb mixture still turned out runny.  The crust was a good consistency, but was too sweet for my taste.  I would suggest using less sugar throughout, making less of the rhubarb mixture, and increasing baking time at your own discretion.

Mmmmm..., these are yummy with whipped cream. 1 1/2 cups of sugar + 1/4 tsp cinnamon + vanilla versus the original recipe. Also, baking the crust for 20 minutes and the rest another hour... but it was GOOD - WAS, I get them all because I am the only rhubarb eater. Oh, well. All the more for me ;)

Excellent recipe, try these alterations:  to make the bottom part melt the butter (only use 2/3 cup) and use brown sugar.
As other reviewers have said use 2 cups instead of 3 for the top part, and I used whole wheat flour on top as well.  So overall, a lighter recipe, and a very good alternative to cake or pie.

I loved these and so did everyone that tried them.  They are sweet - I used 2 c. of sugar and next time I think I'm going to try 1 1/2 c. just to see if I like it that way.  One other thing - I used frozen rhubarb from my garden.  Because it was frozen, it had to bake for A LONG TIME.  I would say at least an hour and a half.  But, it was well worth the wait - they were fantastic!

Everyone loved them!  Didn't change anything, but next time will try the 2 c. of sugar, not 3.  Played it safe because some of my rhubarb was fairly green and tart.

mmmm... we loved it. I had a hard time convincing my husband to try something new instead of his favorite-- plain 'ole rhubarb pie. But I did, and everyone loves it. I have to say though, we prefer ours a little more tart. I only used one and a quarter cups of sugar plus I used about 6 cups rhubarb. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again!

The taste of this was excellent however mine didn't really turn out in "bars" it was more like rhubarb mush.  But nonetheless tasted great!  Will probably just need to leave in the oven a little bit longer next time.

Excellent!  Shortbread crust is very much like a rhubarb custard pie recipe I use often.  Would use less salt next time is my only recommendation.

Made this exactly as written and thought it was very good and easy too.  Just made it again and this time I did a couple things different.  Since strawberry rhubarb pie is my husband's favorite, I added sliced strawberries to the rhubarb mixture.  And he loves nuts so I added chopped walnuts too.  Decreased sugar to two cups, but did everything else exactly as written.  Absolutely delicious.  Husband said better than pie!  I agree with the other posts, this needs to bake at least 45 minutes.   This is a wonderful recipe that I will be making again and again.

It is pretty good. The first time I made it and used a cake pan. It turned out awful. Tried a second time with a bar pan and turned out pretty good. It isn’t as good as my sisters ruhbarb bars but they are pretty tastey

Good taste but came out super runny.  Formed a bit as they sat but not into cuttable ‘bars’.  The instructions are a little poorly worded.  I wonder If i used The right amount of flour in the filling.

This was a wonderful and different recipe to use all of my delicious rhubarb. It has the taste of the rhubarb custard pie which I usually make yet  in smaller and easier to eat bar form. Because I had just make 2 coffee cakes using my 9 x 13 inch pan, I instead decided to use a jelly roll pan as one reviewer suggested. In doing so I made 1 and 1/2 times the amount of crust which was pushed  up the sides. If you like shortbread then this is great, but my husband wanted just the taste of the rhubarb so you may not want to increase the  amount of crust which needed almost 16 minutes to bake. As for the filling, like others I reduced the sugar to 1 and 2/3 cups which was perfect and used about 4 and 1/2 cups of rhubarb which is what I had left from my garden. It all depends on how much of a rhubarb taste you want. For me that amount was a little bit too much and I would have used less, but my husband liked it that way. Last, because I do like my pie's crumb topping, I added some of it to the top before baking. The topping consisted of 1/2 cup flour,  1/4 cup brown sugar  and 1/4 cup butter all crumbled together and I just used enough to cover the filling.  In any case, thanks so much for this great recipe!

These were really good, but I did change them a bit based on other reviewers comments.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 cups and used probably closer to 5 cups rhubarb.  Tartness was just right in my opinion.  Only problem was in the bake time, and that could have been because of the extra rhubarb.  I baked it 50 minutes and it was still a little soggy in the middle.  Hubby loved it, (sogginess and all) so I imagine I will try the recipe again, next time following the recipe regarding the amount of rhubarb.

I made the recipe exactly as printed. It was way too sweet! Instead of 3 cups sugar, I would have added 1 1/2 or 2 cups instead. That might still be too sweet. It never came out like bars. It was way too soupy, although after a day or 2, the liquid absorbed and it was better.

The flavor is good but far too sweet as written (and we love sweet!). If I end up making it again, I will definitely be cutting back on the sugar of both the crust and the topping.

This is the exact recipe my mom clipped from a newspaper over 40 years ago!! It's a family favorite, especially warm and topped with vanilla ice cream. We put it in a smaller pan and increase the baking time by about 15-20 minutes. Yum!

Made these and took to a party.  Everyone who tried them loved them.  I didn't catch the step where you mix the rhubarb into the second batter, so they were really soupy.  I just scooped them into little paper cups and served them with a spoon!  Have printed and highlighted that step for future use!!!

We, too, had the rhubarb and this was another one of those EASY recipes! I used less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar and that was still too much because you have so much sugar in the shortbread crust. I added 1 1/2 TBS of instant vanilla pudding to the rhubarb mixture, today.  It seemed to make it a bit more creamy instead of runny like so many people have mentioned.    It was still extremely sweet even with the decreased sugar( I know I added the pudding, but it was less runny)  I will try it one more time.  I feel this recipe has potential but it is definitely NOT worth making as is.  I love sugar and sweet, but  You must decrease the sugar;  this was gooey, over the top in sweet.

The crust for this recipe was really good.  Nice and buttery and tasting like shortbread.  
The filling, on the other hand, was WAY too sweet. 
I added extra rhubarb and it was still too sweet.  That doesn't mean I didn't eat it, but I will
go back to looking for other ways to use my excess of rhubarb.

I cup back to 2 cups sugar and it was plenty sweet. I baked mine for 90 minutes (or more... I lost track). Wait until it's completely cool to cut it. This is really delicious, but I wish the recipe poster would change the baking time in the recipe, and say that the top should be browned when done. If someone is new to baking, lots of people just don't know how to judge when a cake is done.

I love this recipe like another suggested I have reduced the amount of sugar to 1.5 cups in the topping and added a bit of extra rhubarb.  I also made it using gooseberries instead (approx. 2 cups I think) worked out really tasty. Thank you a really great recipe.

Way too sweet! I have a virtually insatiable sweet tooth, but this recipe was too sweet, even with 1/2 c less sugar than the recipe called for. I wish I had used maybe half the sugar! I also recommend the additional 10 minutes of baking that other reviewers have recommended.

This recipe would have gotten a five except it was way too sweet. I think 2 cups is more than enough. I didn't have time to read the reviews and I just put the amount that was stated and then wanted to kick myself for not cutting the sugar amount. Really a very good dessert especially with vanilla ice. Ream or whipped cream. But make sure you cut that sugar amount. Only negative thing to say.

The first time I made this I had some of the same issues others have mentioned - a little runny-ness.  After the first time I added 3/4 cup chopped pecans and 3/4 - 1 cup of flaked coconut to the topping mixture.  That makes a huge difference in texture and taste - there's a little crunch and a little savory from the pecan and the coconut helps the topping set appropriately.  I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup (I did a half recipe).  I bake this in the Pampered Chef Deep Dish Baker even though I make half the recipe.  I think that also helps - a bit thinner crust and a bit thinner topping.  Everyone I've served these to loves them and I have given my adjusted recipe out to many people.  A good recipe for your rhubarb harvest.

Made this yesterday and even though I cut back the sugar in the filling to 1 and 1/2 cups, it was still plenty sweet. No need for all that sugar. Also I added about 1 to 1 & 1/2 cups of sliced strawberries to the filling. Could be why it didn't need a lot of sugar too I suppose. I think I may reduce the sugar in the crust a little the next time I make this. I had no problem with the filling being runny and didn't add any extra four. Baked it about 45 minutes and it was fine. All in all love this recipe!

over all not a bad rhubarb bar... great way to use up some rhubarb... very very sweet though... i would recommend cutting back on the sugar.... perhaps down to 2 cups... also make sure they cool before cutting possibly even refrigerate after they reach room temperature.. mine were seemed pretty runny and i even baked for an extra 20 minutes until the top started to brown... over all not bad.. reminded me a lot of lemon bars...

Great recipie , loved the flavor . Although I ended up cooking it MUCH longer than 35 minuets . I ended up cooking it for almost an hour and a half . Guess it depends on how much water is in the rhubarb itself . but after it was done (and I did not burn,even after cooking that long) It was so nice and sweet . You will want to make small pieces !

Absolutely my VERY FAVORITE Rhubarb dessert ever!  I have been making this for years and love, love,  LOVE IT!!!!  I like the tartness of rhubarb so I decrease the sugar by at least 1/2 cup and it's still plenty sweet.  I also make real whipped cream to go with this.  (Cool whip or whip-in-a-can just don't do this recipe justice, but in a pinch will use it.)

These bars were loved even by those that swore they HATE rhubarb!  I chose to bake mine in a spring form pan and made sure I greased the sides and bottom first.  They turned out beautifully.  I did cut a bit of the sugar out but will put in even less next time.  The buttery base layer and sweet tangy rhubarb was the perfect combination.  I will definitely be freezing some of our rhubarb in order to enjoy this next winter.

Very easy and very good. I was encouraged to try this after reading the other reviews, but these were so good that I actually HAD to register on the site to review this. I took this to a potluck and apparently while I was gone, EVERYONE was asking, "Who brought the rhubarb bars?" They are still talking about them the next day.   I decreased the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups based on other reviews. I used frozen rhubarb, so added 1 tsp. of tapioca. And I used unbleached flour. Very easy recipe. For family I would definitely use whole grain flour to add to the nutritional value.  Definitely--give it a try.

I used rhubarb and strawberries mixed (4 and 2 cups). I added a little lime juice to zip it up. It was good, but the rhubarb got a little glue-like in texture. I think it has too much flour in with the fruit. I will try again with tapioca instead, which I know makes better pies.

I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and reduced the white sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Increased bake time by 7 minutes.  They were sloppy, but tasty!

This was delicious!!!!!! I cooked it for an extra 10 minutes and reduced the sugar by 1 cup as others suggested. It turned out amazing. I agree with a previous poster that it will firm up as it cools. The crust does taste like a shortbread cookie. So yummy.

This recipe was fairly easy to make but I would be sure to cut down the white sugar and ADD MORE RHUBARB!  It has the base for a great recipe but needed more flavor and less dough.

My kids and I love the recipe! Other people I have made it for also really enjoy it. I seemed to have solve the runny topping problem I had, just by adding a couple of extra tablespoons of flour to the topping mixture; it sets better and it seems even more custardy. I also tend to add an extra 1/2- 1 cup rhubarb to it.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was awesome!! I cut the sugar like other's said to to 1.5 cups and used half whole wheat flour in crust and all whole wheat flour in the custard part. I also only had 3 cups of rhubarb so I added a cup of fresh strawberries!! Delish!!

I loved these bars and so did my family! We are Calfiornians and don't get rhubarb in the stores but once a year. I have enjoyed rhubarb in Wisconsin while visiting my in-laws. My family was skeptical to say the least. The West Coasters throughly enjoyed these bars. I am keeping this recipe to take to my in-laws in Wisconsin this summer.

Very nice recipe.  I used 3 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of strawberries.  All frozen berries though.  Maybe I will thaw the berries next time or just add a little cornstarch.  Little on the runny side, but everybody loved them.

I halved this recipe so I could also make the Rhubard Stir Cake (5*!).  Taking into account other reviewers comments, I cut back the sugar by a third and added extra baking time.  This was touchy, considering I was working with a 1/2 recipe.  As others noted, I found this recipe very sweet, even after cutting back, and the centre of the squares did not quite set.  Even so, very yummy and the best base I've tasted in years!  I will try the base for raisen squares in the near future :-)  Thanks for the recipe and great reviews!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I  like rhubarb, but i couldn't really taste it in these bars. The sweetness was overwhelming even after cutting down the amount of sugar.

This was like eating a Rhubarb Custard Pie, only easier because I didn't have to roll out the pie crust or worry about it dripping on the oven while baking.  I used less sugar, about 2 1/3 cups instead of 3 and it was perfect!  This is our new favorite!

Wonderfully different way to use rhubarb instead of the standard pie or crisp. Rave reviews from my family, even those who don't care much for rhubarb! Agreed with those who lessened the sugar and baked it longer.

Loved this one!!! I followed the advice, and only used 2 cups of sugar, and I added a little allspice to the rhubarb. Will certainly be making this one again! I also baked it for an extra 10 minutes, came out perfectly.

This was a good recipe. I followed the directions exactly except I probably put extra rhubarb in.  It was a little soft so would have been good to remember other reviews that said bake a little longer. Crust was awesome, will keep that part in mind for other stuff. good reviews at pot luck

I baked this an extra ten minutes and it seemed to set very well.  I also used a little bit extra rhubarb, I kept the sugar at the recipe suggested level because my husband really isn't crazy about sour flavours but I probably cut have cut it down without noticing.  Very good, I will make this again.

Very good.  I had to bake 5 minutes extra and I cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups.  Plenty sweet.  I would also suggest greasing sides of pan.

I listened to all the other comments and cut the sugar to two cups and cut back the 10X sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  I received rave reviews.  I used all the rhubarb I had, which came to a little more than 3 1/2 cups, but it still worked out well.

I made this recipe as is and was a little nervous about the butter and sugar amounts.  I threw caution to the wind and gave it a try.  Our family is completely smitten with this recipe!  Yes, it was very sweet, but delicious all the same.  I did have to cook it longer than the recommended 35 minutes.  I'm wondering if you could skip the prebaking of the crust and put the whole thing in at once for 45 minutes.  I will definitely try it with less sugar, but I am very glad I tried it "as is" first.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  The crust was too hard, and the custard too sweet.  Actually covered up the taste of the rhubarb.  I do not recommend.

Very tasty, but as some previous reviewers have mentioned, it could do with a few less eggs.  The bars become goopy and unmanageable with all four eggs.

This was fabulous.  I changed the white sugar amount to 2 cups instead of 3 cups and cooked it for 50 minutes instead of 35 as suggested by other reviews.  I am making another batch again this weekend!  I've been looking for a good rhubarb recipe for years and finally i found one!  Thank you Krista4!

I made these delicious bars and my Mom wanted me to get the reacipe for the nursing home where she lives.  So good! I did use 2 cups sugar and baked them for 50 minutes and turned out great.  A keeper for sure.

These were just awful.  They turned out very very sweet even though I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups.  They were soggy and wet and didn't turn out any better the next day.

I reduced by one egg and added more flour so you don’t get a goopy custard.  I also reduced to 1 1/3 cups of sugar, 3 cups is too much. I also only use about 3 cups of rhubarb. The rhubarb adds a lot of moisture. The crust really makes this dish.

Made as written.   Next time less sugar, beat eggs until fluffy.   Bake about 45-50 minutes.

Baked for 50 minutes, added less than cup of strawberries,  vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon. A little runny right out of oven, but tastes wonderful. Hopefully it will set some

Excellent recipe! I was gifted rhubarb from a friend and never tried it before this recipe. I cut back the sugar to 2cups as other reviews suggested. I lined the baking pan with parchment paper to avoid sticking and it came out very easily. I let it cool on the counter overnight and by morning it was thickened just beautifully. It was then kept in the refrigerator and the crust stayed crisp. It's a delicious and cool treat on these hot summer days. I'll be making another batch since we still have rhubarb left.

Everyone loved it at my house even though my son accidently added 2 cups of white sugar to the crust mixture!  We added 1/2 cup of sugar to the rhubarb mixture since we hadn’t used the entire 3 cups.  Baked an extra 10 minutes.  Next time we will mix the white sugar in the correct place and try just the two cups recommended by others.  Delicious!

The look is completely different from the original recipe, but it was pretty good! I added some apple pieces as I did not have enough rhubarb. I reduced the custard filling sugar to a little less than 1 cup! I can't image how sweet it would be with 3 cups. That's just too much. I am not used to overly sweet desserts in the U.S., and I usually reduce to at least half, but because of everyone's suggestions, I cut back to 1 cup and it was right for me. American friends who had also enjoyed it, so I think lesser sugar is better. As the first time baker with rhubarbs, I'm glad I chose the right recipe!! Thank you!

I made this exactly as it said and it has yummy flavor but it was actually too sweet for me. So I think next time I will definitely reduce the sugar but I love the crust on the bottom and the rhubarb was yummy.

This is my new favorite recipe for using rhubarb!!  I cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups, and it was still plenty sweet.  I also baked the bars an extra 10 minutes, which worked well.  The shortbread crust really makes this recipe fantastic!!

Did no one else find this cake INCREDIBLY SALTY?! I couldn’t believe the taste of it. 1 1/2 tsp of salt is just way too much. I was surprised to see that amount, but all the reviews were very positive and nothing about the salt content, so I made it as is. Wow. I had difficulty eating it. It was runny as others have mentioned, not the worst, but the salt content was far too much for me and my husband. If I try to make this again, I will reduce the salt by a lot. Maybe just 1/2 tsp of salt. I’m afraid I will just need to throw the rest of it away. It was a waste of good rhubarb. The base was nice, but that was the only positive thing I can say about this recipe. I am highly disappointed.

Will definitely make it again.  It was delicious .  My whole family liked it; kids all the way up to grand parents.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, and it was still sweet.  I may try to use 1.5 cups next time.  I served it with whipping cream and sliced strawberries.

A definite 5 star recipe when I changed the sugar from 3 cups to 2.  I made the crust in a food processor which made it quick and easy. Definately a keeper.

The rhubarb topping creates a custard-like filling, which tastes of egg.  Rhubarb and egg flavors just don't compliment each other.  The shortbread base is very good, though.  I could see this made with pecans instead of rhubarb, perhaps.  Just not a good combination of flavors.

I made this as a snack for work and it was gone in 30 seconds ! Only thing I will do different next time is double the amount I make ! Great way to use Rhubarb ! Sour cream almost gave it a lemony taste. Delicious!!

I thought that they were too sweet--almost grainy from the sugar.  Mine were set along the edges only, otherwise very runny.  I think that the tips from other bakers would be helpful.

Made the recipe as written as hubby likes everything exceptionally sweet!  I don't eat desserts so I always let him rate them.  He rated this a four only because there are others he likes better.  But he did eat it all gone!

I also cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c. and it was plenty sweet. I felt the crust need more time to cook first. They were messy, and good, but I'll look for another recipe. Thanks anyway.

This was good. I made it just as the directions stated. It was tasty but messy and not the best thing to serve at a party.
I didn't think it was too sweet with the three cups of sugar but I do think I should have baked it a bit more.

Use 2 cups sugar only.
Add more rhubarb.
Awesome!

This is a great rhubarb recipe. A nice sweet treat different than the traditional pie. I replaced 1 cup of rhubarb with raspberries and had great results!

Extremely sweet, but delicious!  Will definitely reduce the sugar and add additional rhubarb next time.  I used frozen rhubarb, so I increased my bake time by at least 45 minutes.

These were liked by even the rhubarb haters in my house which was everyone but me. And a guest we had for dinner said they were just like his mom makes, so he loved them. I thought they were ok, would make again for family, but for me I am going to keep looking for the perfect bar/cake.

Liquid center! Yuck! I have to agree with other reviews, kind of gross looking, though it does taste pretty good. I even cooked it an extra 20 minutes to try and firm up the center. Not sure what happened!

These were very good. I cut back the sugar to 2 cups and it was still very sweet, but good. Took it to work and they disappeared quickly. Thanks :)
