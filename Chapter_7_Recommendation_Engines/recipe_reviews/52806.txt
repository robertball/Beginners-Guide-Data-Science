My husband and I just bought a food dehydrator and this was our first jerky recipe to try.  We made it according to the recipe and it turned out great.  We will use this recipe again.

We really didn't like this recipe at all. I followed it exactly and the flavour of the jerky was not good at all. Maybe this is better for a steak marinade than a piece of jerky.

Very, very good. I tried to alter it slightly but it did'nt turn out as well. I did use less liquid smoke though. I used 2 to 2 1/2 Tbls. Will make many times again.

Great recipe 4.5 really.   Added 1tsp of chili peppers to marinade. Hung strips on toothpicks on highest rack of oven @ 170 for about 7 hours.Put foil on lowest rack to catch drippings. I like mine to slightly bend without snapping.  Thanks for the recipe

Freakin' awesome!!! Holy smokes I thought this was one of the best jerky recipes I'd ever had. I marinaded mine overnight and they were terrific. Also, don't forget the steak seasoning or rub to put on it at the end b/4 drying. That can definitely add a special bite to it if you want it spicy, depending on what you use.

Excellent!  I marinated the beef for 2 days, but next time I will try 1 day.  I also used a sirloin cut the butcher recommended.

Good jerky.  Main reason i picked it was that i had all the ingredients.  Used venison, and it was inhaled by my kids.  I just marinaded it over night...if i make it again, i'll marinate it a little longer.

I'd give this recipe a 4.5! It's pretty addicting. I just made 9 lbs of beef into beef jerky for a family reunion and it's gone! I did make a couple adjustments. I cut the Worcestershire sauce in half. I used McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning and an angus eye of round roast. I also let the meat sit in the marinade for longer than 2 days a couple times. I say the longer the better!

Amazing!  No need for dehydrator. I did not have the Worcestershire sauce so I used a chipotle marinade as a substitute.  I also added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little heat.

Meh. It is a good marinade but it lacks flavor. You can taste it but it just left me wanting a little more spice. May try to make this again but with more spices (Cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic, etc.)

I love this beef jerky for its simplicity of the recipe. I have made it more times than any other recipe. It's all the right savory flavors. My only variation that I do is I use low sodium soy sauce and use a little MSG in the marinade. Very good!
