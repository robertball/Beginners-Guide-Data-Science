Oh.  My.  Word.  Only one reviewer as I write this?  One?! And that was more than three years ago?  Do you know what we've all been missing? Where has this recipe been all my life? So easy, but never mind that. These are so "D" good you can't stop with just "the taste" you told yourself you would. Decadent. Buttery, chocolatey, caramely, gooey, rich, sinful, and pretty. A few minutes, a few simple ingredients most cooks have on hand and you've got something that's going to make you a star. I've got no tips (except to line your pan with foil), no changes, and no hints - except to make these.  Now. You'll be in "turtle" heaven.

Easy and Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 pan and they turned out great! I thought they would have been really sweet with all that ice cream topping, but they weren't at all. Caramel and chocolate, slightly chewy, with a little crunch - yum!! Will def. make again.

Very good and easy.  I served these with a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  Be sure to make a sling of aluminum foil to fit in the pan before filling . . . as one reviewer mentioned.  This is good advice for all bar type desserts, like brownies and the like.  After it has cooled and firmed up, the entire dessert can be lifted out and cut easily.  Also, after you sprinkle the chips over the hot filling, put a piece of foil loosley over the top, it will help the chips to melt quickly and evenly.

Visions of pecan pie swirled through my head when I tasted these. Easy to make. When I was baking I thought they looked done and remembered it said the caramel should bubble. So I baked a little longer. Let it sit overnight. I had foiled the pan with a doubled strip of foil going the other way so I could lift the whole thing out. Cut with a pizza cutter. Works great! While still gooey, no oozing anywhere. Thanks for a good recipe Peggy!

They are easy to make, but not worthy of 5 starts. I made them exactly as stated with the exception of using foil in the pan for easy removal.

The most helpful advice is the aluminum foil in the pan. Definitely go with that. I left them on the counter for about 6 hours then refrigerated overnight. Easy to take out of the pan on the foil and cut. DO cut into bite size squares.  These are SWEET, Magic Bar-ish.  I used semi-sweet choc chips and glad I did.  Milk Choc would have been over the top sweetness. They were refrigerated and I brought them to work at 8 am.  By 2pm the caramel at room temp was oozing out and it became kind of messy.. and I had them cut in complete squares. If you're going to take them somewhere, make sure they're cold and will get eaten rather quickly. It made about 20 bite sized squares.

Wow...these are super good!  And, they couldn't be easier!  I was a little worried because my caramel was really runny after baking, topping with the chocolate chips and letting them set for a few hours.  But, I let them set over night and they turned out perfect.  They were still gooey, but I was able to cut them into squares and they stayed intact.  Will definitely make these again!

Oh...My...Gosh! These bars are so easy and so good! They just melt away in your mouth and are just heavenly! I did refrigerate my bars for 2-3 hours instead of waiting 6 hours for them to cool and my caramel was still a bit gooey when I cut into them. I lined my pan with foil and then greased it - this made it extremely easy to get out of the pan and cut too. I used my own homemade caramel sauce and I have them stored in an airtight container in the fridge. They just keep calling me back for more. Love this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Very good, very rich, very simple to make. I did need to let mine bake a bit longer to get the caramel get bubbly. I probably should have given it another 5 minutes as it was still a little gooey, but the edges probably would have been overdone at that point. These were a hit - thanks!

Yum! Made this for the Recipe Group. I loved these. So did my hubby and oldest son. My other 2 kids didn't like it and thought they were to sweet. But I'm still giving it 5 stars. I mixed the dough part up in my food processor since I'm lazy that way. The cooling time on these is really just torture. I'm the kind that wants to taste it right away. I didn't pay attention to the type of choco chips used and used semi-sweet. Oops. Still yummy. I used Smuckers caramel. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked the cookie part, the nuts and the chocolate. The caramel part was way too sweet. What would be good would be to make this a salted caramel bar.. add some kosher salt when the caramel is poured on.. one of these times I'll try this

These things are SIN-FULL!! Wow what a wonderful rich treat.  I used Hershey's Caramel Syrup, baked it until it bubbled & texture/ consistency was perfect!  Ate too many of these in too short a time, but they are superb!

Great flavor-very rich but mine are still a little gooey the next day. I was expecting to be able to cut into candy size squares but they're too messy.

Fabulous bar recipe! The only thing I had to do a bit differently was use Smuckers butterscotch topping because the store was out of the caramel one. I did have a bit of the caramel one at home so I taste-tested the two together and there wasn't a huge difference between the two. The only tip I might suggest is that if you, like me, get annoyed by cutting in butter, I have another bar recipe where the crust is exactly like this one, same ingredients, same taste, and the directions call for mixing it in with a hand mixer instead of cutting in, and it ends up nice and crumbly, perfect for pressing into a pan.

Over rated. Not at all flavorful. Maybe its the caramel, maybe it'd be better with semi-sweet chips. Blah flavor.

I made this as the Recipe Buzz Group Recipe for the week of December 6th. Wow, really mixed reactions on this from us. For taste I give this a 1 -- it's inedible to me. My husband gives it a 5 though! This is too sweet for me, on every layer except the chocolate layer, where I had to use semisweet chips because I was out of milk chocolate. I wish I knew what brand of caramel topping to use because I used Hershey's (the kind in a jar that you have to refrigerate after opening) because mine didn't even set up right in the refrigerator. I was able to cut them, but they're going to be a terrible mess in gift boxes so I guess I'll have to serve them in candy liners. These were very easy to make; if I were to make this again (which I won't) I think I'd make my own caramel, reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, and add some salt to the crust layer. Also, due to the gooey-ness of the caramel, I was unable to cut the pieces small enough to get 48 servings; I got 24. For all that though, my husband does like them, so this receives a neutral rating of 3 stars from us. Thanks for the recipe!

I was really worried I was missing something while making this - but in the end they turned out just fine. I made mine with white chocolate chips, since I cannot eat regular chocolate - and it was nice - enjoyed by all. Thanks!

These were delicous and easy...to make.  To cut is another story.  I lined my pan with foil and let the bars set overnight.  When I went to cut them in the morning, the chocolate and carmel made them quite gooey.  Delicous to eat, difficult to present.  I would recommend refrigeration for at least an hour before they're cut.  I will make them again for sure since they were so easy and tasted great.  Lesson learned on the cutting stage though.

This is a wonderful recipe to have in your back pocket for those times when you need to whip up a quick treat at a moment's notice.  They are quite rich so small bars are in order.

These are way too sweet for me but they aren't bad. Definitely cut in small bite sized pieces. I would make these again with a few changes for my personal tastes. I would cut back on the brown sugar a bit, use a homemade caramel sauce so I could control the sugar in that and use semi-sweet chocolate chips. I would make again with those changes because I could still tell there was good flavor there under all the sweetness. Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were absolutely delicious. It was very easy to prepare and quick to make. Six hours cooling time was a little hard to take because  they looked so good,but with some patience,  the finished product was definitely worth the wait.Thank You for sharing such a YUMMY and simple recipe.

Based solely on the rave reviews from my coworkers, this easily earned it's 5 stars! With how easy it was to pull this together at 9pm on a work-night AND have it be delicious, I give it 5 stars. It's incredibly rich, reminds me of a candy bar, and you really only need a small piece to be satisfied...but it's so good, you'll keep going back for more! I happened to have homemade caramel sauce in the fridge so that's what I used. Also, I used semi-sweet chips since that's also what I had on hand, but I think I might actually prefer milk chocolate for these...semisweet is a fine replacement though. Enjoy!!

These are wonderful!  And so easy to make!  I followed the recipe exact and mine turned out great!  Yep, they are sweet but reading the ingredients clued me in on how rich they would be.  I highly recommend this for an easy dessert!
