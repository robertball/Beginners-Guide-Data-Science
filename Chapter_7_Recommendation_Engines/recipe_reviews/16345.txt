Great salad Victoria.  I used leftover taco meat and french dressing instead of the taco sauce.  I am not a big fan of Catalina by any means, but for some reason it pairs beautifully with taco meat.  I used Frito's instead of tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again!!!

This is one of my favorite meals because it's so quick for me on a busy day and my boys love it because....we'll, they're getting chips for dinner! I health it up a bit and use ground turkey, my own homemade taco seasoning and I add chopped organic peppers and sometimes shredded carrot or zucchini to the taco meat. You can even sub half organic black beans for half the meat or double it to include the black beans in the taco meat to really make it stretch for a big family (or big eaters, like mine!). I also make my own salsa to go over the top. This can be made "lighter" with lowfat cheese and fat free sour cream without much difference in flavor. Try this with organic flavored taco chips, too! Even better!

really good basic recipe, I added a can of refried beans to the hamburger and a little of the taco sauce.  Then layer the rest as suggested.

Really good.  I added a package of taco seasoning.  Also added olives and onions.  Makes great super quick dinner.  Still makes a mess though.

Great! I used a powdered taco sauce mix with the ground beef, substituted regular head lettuce instead of romaine and layered it differently with the lettuce on the bottom. I will definitely do this one over and over!

I used iceburg lettuce in place of romaine, instead of taco sauce I used 2 TBLS of the taco seasoning mix I recipe, 1/4 cup of water and a couple tablespoon of Secret Burger Sauce recipe. Added cucumbers, shredded carrots and sliced green peppers. Served with homemade ranch dressing. YUM!!!

Yummy and easy too!  I make my own taco seasoning mix to add to the beef (4 teaspoons chili powder, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 cup water).

Even better than tacos!  I put taco seasoning on the meat, and added kidney beans.  I also added a little more taco seasoning to the mix.  Wonderful!

I used taco seasoning on the ground beef and I used iceburg lettuce.  This is always a great meal for our family to use up taco dinner leftovers.

You can't go wrong with this great basic for a quick lunch or for dinner. I substituted the beef for Madras Lentils which is a lentil, kidney bean, and tomato substitute for tacos. Instead of corn chips I crunch up taco shells. Excellent and quick lunch or dinner.

Pretty good.  Added taco seasoning and garlic powder to meat.  Also used sliced olives and salsa.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream.

Perfect and easy meal for my salad and mexican food loving family. (Well, Drew could take or leave the mexican part) I added taco seasoning mix to the meat and also like Josie, used Fritos. Delicious Victoria!

I added taco seasoning to the ground beef and used Frito corn chips instead of the tortilla chips.  Also, instead of taco sauce, I used Kraft fat free Ranch with Sour Cream and Onion dressing.  It was delicious!

A friend of mine made this recipe while we were in college. The difference was she added catalina dressing, AND instead of regular tortilla chips, she used Doritios. This is my favorite taco salad.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used the doritos as someone suggested and used the taco seasoning in the meat.  It could have used more meat as I made me for 2 adults and 3 six yr olds and there was none left.  Everyone but my daughter loved it and my one son had seconds.  A+

very basic recipe, we add taco seasoning, and for a healthy alternative to beef, we use ground turkey. My kids love to use flavored tortilla chips like taco doritos or nacho cheese flavor.

I have always loved this recipe because it is really good and really easy!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained), a can of corn (drained), added taco seasoning (low sodium)to the meat, omitted the taco sauce and added sour cream. Perfection! Can't wait to eat the leftovers today!

Great taco salad recipe. It's also a great recipe to use as a reference, since you don't need to include everything and you can throw in some of your own favorite ingredients to make it unique and personalized.

I cooked the beef in taco seasoning, then made a layered taco salad. It was good, but not great.  I don't think I'd serve it to guests, but for a tortilla chip lover such as myself, it was good for a quick afternoon snack.

Extremely easy to prepare and required ingredients usually on hand. This was kinda bland for our tastes. I used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine because we like it better.  My suggestion is to use nacho cheese or other flavored Doritos or else taco seasoning on the meat (or both). We preferred Taco Salad I by Denise Williamson much much better, however, this is a great starter or base recipe.

Very good and super easy taco salad. I did add taco seasoning to the ground beef, as well as a can of drained kidney beans. I loved this because once all the ingredients were on the table, the kids could assemble their salads the way they wanted. I'll definitely make this again, especially on really hectic days.

Good basic idea, but better we think, if you add some taco seasoning to the ground beef. Also good with some drained kidney beans layered in and Thousand Island dressing or top with sour cream and salsa as usual. Of course your imagination can rule as far choosing your favorite toppings!

This was pretty bland, but admittedly very easy. The second time I made it, I used half salsa and half ranch dressing (I used a lower fat version which was okay but full fat would have tasted much better) in place of the taco sauce. I also added taco seasoning mix to the ground beef to give it some flavor.

My family and I love this recipe! I end 
up making it at least once a week, 
sometimes more! When I make it, I substitute
Ranch salad dressing for the taco sauce.
Add the salad dressing before you add 
the cheese and the tortilla chips.

A very quick and easy dinner to get on the table.  I did add some taco seasoning to the beef as we like a zippy taco salad and added the taco sauce to the cooked meat.  Served over fresh organic mixed greens and topped it off with 'Emily's Dressing for Taco Salad' from AR.  My husband I enjoyed a delicious meal.

Fabulous recipe :) My daughter, husband and I all loved it! And it was just the recipe I needeed today after staying up late last night! I did season the beef with taco seasoning and while it simmered I got the toppings together. I sat out sour cream, salsa, and jalapenos in addition to what was listed.

No garlic? C'mon now. Also used extra lean ground sirloin and equal amount of lean ground pork.This was then a hit and keeper. Serve with beer.

Instead of plain tortilla chips we use nacho cheese doritos... it tastes really good that way

I really liked it--made it when I was craving taco salad, which is hard to find nowadays.  My kids thought it was a weird idea, and my husband wasn't interested in salad, but I thought it was delicious.  Thanks!

This is a good base recipe for your own preferences. I spiced up the ground beef with cumin, chili powder, garlic and dried onions and ended up only using half the meat. I added part of a can of drained Ranch Style Beans, left off the onion and taco sauce, and used bottled salad dressing. My hubby liked it because it was like eating a taco. Thanks for sharing Victoria!

Super, super easy to make and ohhhh, so tasty.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers regarding some additions, here is what I added.  3/4 of a package of taco sauce mix with the hamburger when I made it, plus a 1/2 cup water and 1/4 onion (I used sweet onions as they were in season).  Cooked all that up together.  To the taco sauce (stuff out of the jar) I mixed an equal amount of ranch dressing and added the last 1/4 of the taco sauce from the package, mix all this together.  Follow the rest of the recipe as written and man oh man is it delicious.

Great! But eat up because it doesn't last very long without getting soggy!! I too added taco seasoning to the beef, used more lettuce (iceberg), and some chopped green bell pepper. In addition to the regular onion, I also used some minced green onion and used french dressing instead of taco sauce. Very good and reminds me of summer picnics! Thanks!!

Easy to make, but you need to add your own seasoning as it is rather bland.

This was beyond quick and easy.  My husband, who normally doesn't eat taco anything, was pretty pleased with this.  He ate every bit of it and said he was surprised at how filling it was.  Will be adding this to our rotation.

very good idea, and thanks to other reviewers I was able to make it much better. I cooked the meat with the onion and added a couple of tbls. of "Taco Seasoning I" from this site and for the dressing I used half ranch and half taco sauce. The result...delicious!!!

I have made something simular to this, but instead of using the taco sauce, the recipe I have calls for a bottle of french salad dressing... everything else is the same... I have also added black olives, and green olives, since my family loves green and black olives...

Loved this taco salad. I added avocado, pinto beans and black olives. You definately need to add taco seasoning to the ground beef. The romaine lettuce holds up well with the warm meat. I used emily's dressing for taco salad from this site with it.

I use Frito chips.  And if you can find it---instead of ground beef use a can of Wolf Brand Chili, made in Texas ofcourse.  Family fav. Even better---Make laywers of each several times and bake 350 for 20 minutes or so.   To die for

Wonderful and versatile recipe. I didn't have the taco seasoning, so I used enchalada sauce instead. I had to use flour to compensate for the runny consistency of the enchalada sauce. My family absolutely loved the final dish. You could do just about anything with this recipe and it would still turn out grand. A real keeper. Thanks!

Pretty bland looking, and how does adding sour cream give it an "extra kick"?.  Try it with cojita or a real taco cheese sometime.

Very easy and the kids loved it...even my picky six-year-old.  Mix the taco sauce in the beef after it is browned. This eliminates the need for taco seasoning. Also use a bit of sour cream and taco sauce as a salad topping...it's excellent!

Great recipie. I made it during the week on one of those nights when you feel like ordering out instead of cooking & it was great! EASY to make & a HUGE hit with my 3 year old son. He gobbled up a whole plateful. I added sour cream after serving & my son liked his with ranch dressing.
