Sorry, I had high hopes for this.  The dressing was what didn't work for us (and what I thought would be the best part), but we liked all the components.  It was simple to prepare and healthy, just not to our tastes.

I absolutely loved this! The only thing I did differently was to add salt and pepper. You could probably add olive oil to the dressing to make it more of a "traditional" dressing. Thanks for sharing!
