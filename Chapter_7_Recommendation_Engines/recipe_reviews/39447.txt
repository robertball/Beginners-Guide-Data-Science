I just wanted to share a tip with all those reviewers who used dried herbs and were disappointed. To reconstitute dried herbs put the desired amount in a small, very small container with a few drops of water. It should be barely enough to cover the herbs. Heat in the microwave for a few seconds, 10-20 maybe.Use the water in the recipe. It's a small amount but it will add flavor. That's it.

What a wonderful combination of herbs and spices! I coated my pork with a smidge of olive oil before rubbing with spices,let the meat stand on the counter to bring down to room temperture before cooking, and cooked in the rotisserie. It made a superb crunchy crust and just bursting with juices inside.I think it is very important to have a meat thermometer handy, as pork is horrible when too dry no matter what it is rubbed with! We cook ours until the internal temp. reaches about 150, take it out, let it sit, and the temp. rises a bit more, but not enough to dry it out.

This is excellent, but then I might be just a little biased as I've been eating pork roast seasoned like this all my life.  I did modify this, based on my own experience making and eating it.  Make little slits in the roast and insert slivers of garlic (rather than using garlic salt). Salt and pepper the roast and rub it with olive oil, then pat it with a mixture of fresh chopped rosemary and thyme (or just rosemary).  While the roast is resting after cooking, deglaze the roasting pan with white wine and allow to reduce to a savory white wine reduction.  If you prefer gravy, as Hubs did tonight, deglaze the pan with white wine or broth, then thicken with a slurry of cornstarch or flour, and broth.  I like to start this out at 450 degrees fotr 10-15 minutes, then continue the cooking at the reduced temp of 350.

To make this a complete meal, I doubled the ingredients as shown and then placed the roast into my slow cooker and added 1 cup apple cider on the bottom. 

I then added some baby carrots, sliced red onion, and potato chunks into the same bag, added a little more salt and pepper, as well as some olive oil and shook the rest of the seasonings left over in the bag with the vegetables to coat them. I then placed the contents into the slow cooker as well. Cooking it on slow for 8 hours

I made this in the crockpot and like a previous reviewer, put some apple juice in the bottom of the pot.  I put 1/2 cup apple juice, 1/2 cup veggie broth (I would have used all apple juice, but I needed to use up the broth).  I used fresh basil and oregano instead of rosemary.  Threw in about a pound of baby carrots, which turned out wonderful.  Cooked for about 8 hours.  It was so moist and tender, we loved it!  Served with Creamy Au Gratin potatoes from this site.  I have never made pork roast before but this inspired me to do it more often!

Another simple, yet outstanding recipe.  I had no fresh rosemary, so I simply crushed some dried leaves.  I also cooked the roast longer than recommended in the recipe.  Pork roast needs 20-25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees.  Also, I think the roast is juicier if you cover it during cooking.  Enjoy!

This pork roast had a great flavour.  I made a rub out of the spices with 1 tbsp of vegetable oil.  I didn't use fresh rosemary because I didn't have any, so I just used a smaller amount of dried rosemary.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  It was very tender.

Delic-i-ous-o!!  I subbed in garlic granuals with dried parsley for the garlic salt..that would have been way too much for my palate.  I also followed other suggestions and seared it in olive oil before rubbing on the seasoning and baking covered for at least half the time.  Regarding cook time, mine was 1.5 pounds and only took one hour.  Like I said, this is wonderful and will be one of my regular recipes!  Thanks Marianne!

This recipe was basically a good one, but I lowered the heat to 325 degrees and cooked for 1 hr. and 30 minutes in a glass baking dish. Baked uncovered for 15 min, and then covered with aluminum foil. Came out perfect - melt in your mouth!

Very simple and very good!!  Put a little chicken broth in the bottom of the pan and quarter and onion or two and cover with foil when you bake and it will be more moist, but it is just fine without it!

Wonderful roast! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and also sprinkled with onion powder. Don't forget to make a nice gravy with the pan drippings.

Absolutely 5 stars for simplicity!! So easy and relatively fast. I had everything on hand, no marinading...my kind of recipe! The flavor is a 4 1/2 or 5...only bc I thought it was a little too spicy to eat a lot of. But I did use dried rosemary, and probably added too much (always use less  dried than fresh herbs).  So less rosemary next time may remedy that issue.  I also added a tiny bit of olive oil to my meat before coating w/ the spice rub (don't mess with a bag, just use your hands). I followed another reviewer's advice and added just enough water to my dried herbs to cover them, let it soak a few minutes, then just added the other rub ingredients to that, mixed it up, and rubbed onto the meat.  Finally, my grocery store only sells pork loin as 2 one pound loins packaged together, so I made both and covered the dish w/ foil (as per other reviewers recommendations). (Also scaled servings to 5.) I left it in one hour, but could've taken it out sooner as it was already at 168 degrees. It was not dried out though. Still very moist, tender, a flavorful. Will do again and again!

This had a wonderful flavor.  My roast was tall (bone in) and took almost 2 hours to cook, but it was juicy and moist.  I cut 2 large potatoes in 1 inch slices and set the roast on them.  The roast was crispy all the way around and the potatoes tasted great.

Good straight ahead recipe. Try subbing granulated garlic for garlic salt. I don't even have it in my spice drawer. Also to get a good coat and hence crust, liberally smear mustard (any kind, Dijon or yellow) on roast then sprinkle dry rub (go ahead, experiment with the drawer, you can't hurt it) liberally all over the roast. You'll love it! Great on a covered grill too. 
RESPECT THE PIG!

I converted this recipe to a slow-cooker so my family would have dinner at a decent time since I work during the day. Very simple but I used garlic powder instead of salt. (I watch my family's salt intake and pork is naturally salty.) It turned out wonderfully with mashed potatoes and cauliflower.

This was the very first recipe I tried from AllRecipes shortly after getting married a few years ago.  I had absolutely no idea how to cook...I have made this roast many many times and have never served it without receiving tons of compliments.  My inlaws think I'm a chef...shhh don't tell them I can't cook!

YUM!  Rubbed with olive oil, used 1/2 garlic salt and 1/2 garlic powder, dried rosemary, all 4 family members liked it. I used a 4lb roast, thought it would take 30min/lb to cook but it was done in an hour.

My secret for a perfect pork roast is to use an OVEN baking bag. You can use just about any of the spice combinations listed here, and the roast will always come out tender and juicy. You can use dried herbs because the moisture in the bag will reconstitute them. You put all of the spices into the bag, making sure the whole roast is covered. I like to poke fork holes all over the meat to absorb the flavored juices. Put the whole bag in a baking pan and tie off the neck. Poke a slit to release steam. Roast @350° for about an hour. Use thermometer to reach 175°. Take it out of bag and let it rest 10 minutes before slicing. Use juice in bag as a base for gravy.

Not bad but needs an olive oil coating before adding the herbs.  Also, those of you who complained that the meat was dry, you over-cooked the roast.  The recipe correctly states to cook to 145 (not 160) degrees.  When you let the meat rest for 10 minutes after cooking the temp will raise a bit and the meat juices will be re-absorbed.

Made as written except used tenderloin instead of roast.  Flavoring was very good.  The only thing I may do different is to sear the outside first before putting in the oven...visually it will look better.

I used a 3-lb. pork roast but doubled the spices and mixed them with two cans of cream of chicken soup.  I wrapped the roast in foil with carrots, onion, and celery, and topped the meat & veggies with the soup mix.  The meat took two hours this way rather than one, but the whole house smelled wonderful, and the end result was a tender, tasty meal that I served with mashed potatoes.  Voila!  Instant gravy!

I wrapped this roast in aluminum foil and wanted to check the temperature after 45 minutes or so but forgot to set a timer.  By the time an hour had passed the temperature of the roast was well over 160 degrees.  I am not sure if the fact that it was wrapped made it cook so much faster than the recipe indicated or not, but my advice is to check it early because an overcooked pork roast is a dry pork roast.  The seasonings were good, though so I may give this a shot again in the slow cooker.

I had half a large pork loin left from New Year's 2009, I was worried it would be horrible.  Guess it was packaged well, and the recipe was easy and tasty.  I used 2 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and the rest as listed.  Made a 'paste' with the spices and rubbed it directly into the loin.  Covered with foil and removed the foil for the last 20 minutes.  Husband loved it.  Oh, made roasted, parsley fingerling potatoes they are awesome!

Fabulous!  I've NEVER made any kind of roast in the oven before.  Imagine my trepidation!  But this was so easy and so tasty, I feel emboldened!  I'm too lazy to throw spices in a bag and shake it all up; I just rubbed the spices right into the roast.  You can't miss with this recipe.  Try it.  I'm tellin ya, I'm superwoman over here!

I never review recipes, but this was so good I had to say something! I added an onion, squash, and a couple potatoes and wrapped it in foil and baked it about an hour and a half (pork always takes me longer than it says) and it was awesome. Add some rolls and a salad and you'll have a great meal for company.

I am by no means a cook so i looked for a simple yet impressive recipe to cook for my man friend.This pork roast was absolutley divine!1 I impressed myself with this one. It looked great and tasted even better. The big joke about it was how even after "dropping that roast in the grass" it tasted great. will make this recipe again and again!

This was delicious!   Loved the flavor of the roast.  Tried to make gravy straight from the pan juices but it was extremely salty from the garlic salt - remedied it by using lo-salt chicken broth and then flavored it with just enough of the pan juices - came out great.

I drizzled olive oil on my tenderloin and then added the seasonings. I cooked covered for the first 45minutes and uncovered the last 15minutes and it was perfect.

This was not that great. I followed the recipe exactly, even using fresh rosemary, but found the results lackluster. There was no gravy at all like in the picture, so don't expect any. I cooked it to an internal temp. of 160 degrees. I wouldn't say this recipe was bad just not worth making again.

I've made this pork roast many times, and it comes out juicy and delicious.  The only thing that I had to change is the cook time.  I always need to make it a little longer.

I make a version of this but I mix the rosemary with dijon mustard and coat the pork roast before cooking.  It keeps it moist and adds much more flavor!

Because I used a 5 lb pork roast, I just doubled the ingredients.  I followed the advice of others and rubbed it with olive oil to help the spices cling to the meat.  Also, I used dried rosemary rather than fresh (just used a pinch more), and I threw in some oregano.  Overall, very tasty!

This is the only way I will cook a pork roast from now on!  Excellent flavor and the pan drippings made fab gravy.  I did not have fresh rosemary, but the dried worked fine.  I tossed the roast in the fridge with the spices in the morning to let it all marry together until supper.  It took about an hour and 15 minutes for the pop up timer on my pork roast to pop but it was still juicy.  Great, simple recipe.  Thanks!

It sounds like some people have been overcooking the pork roast.  The cook time as written give or take 5 mins should be sufficient.  Always use a meat thermometer and there's there no guessing if it's done.  The open pan roasting and seasonings are what makes this roast outstanding!

I had a large pork lion, so I doubled the receipe and it was wonderful, even my teenage son liked it, which was hard to believe.  Added about a cup of chicken stock to the bottuem of the pan.  Will continue to use this receipe!

Two words.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  I made this last night for a Christmas Eve dinner and fully believe this will become our Christmas Day meal for years to come.  Did the recipe exactly as said.  Only difference is I added some red skinned potatoes and carrots to the pan.  Will definately be making this meal for years to come.  Simple but delicious.

Update:First wrote this review 12/25/2005... 11 years later and still making this recipe.

naples34101 has the right conception. You can either sear your meat first to lock in the juices, or high temp or broil outside. Fresh garlic in meat is always best, or substitute garlic powder instead of the salt version, salt is an addition that can be added after the fact according to one's taste. Also cornstarch as a gravy thickening gives a translucent and shiny appearance and consistency, much better for thin sauces. If not slow cooking in crock pot, always place meat (whatever kind) up out of juices by placing carrots, potatoes, celery or preferred veggies on bottom of pan for flavor of drippings, can also be pureed after to add to gravy making. DON'T cook meat in water or juices unless you like your meat basically boiled. Outside searing will ensure inside moisture!

This was a great recipe, however, I used my "Show Time" rotisserie to cook it. I marinated it in the ingredients overnight. Not sure that was necessary, but it worked out fine for me. Three pound roast took about an hour and a half.

I just made this recipe, but cooked it wrapped in foil for 90 minutes and let it rest for 20 minutes before serving. I didn't have thyme so I substituted with dried oregano leaves and instead of garlic salt, I used 6 cloves of crushed fresh garlic. Delish and juicy.

This roast was DELICIOUS!!! The meast was juicy and flavorful. I rubbed the roast with olive oil and used dried rosemary instead. Used the ground thyme and ground marjoram. Also sprinkled a little garlic salt and a bit of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning. Cooked with potatoes and baby carrots. Roast was a little over 3lbs, took about 1 hr and 35 minutes. MMMM Good will use this recipe again! Thanks

This was very very good!!  Will definitely make this again!  Didn't have rosemary.  Rubbed w/ olive oil and rubbed the spices rather than using the plastic bag.  The plastic bag didn't work well.  All the spices stuck to one place!  Made gravy from the juices in the pan.  Served with red taters!  Yummy!!

This was SO delicious!  My roast was a little bigger than 3lbs but probably under 5lbs.  I doubled the herb mix.  It didn't say to chop the rosemary but I did.  Then I rubbed on instead of shaking and let it sit for a couple hours before roasting.  It had such a nice flavor and everyone loved it.  I wish there were more leftovers.

Made this for my husbands boss - it was fantastic! Rave reviews all around! I did sear the roast in a pan with olive oil before I put it in the oven. Served it with peas and pearl onions and oven roasted vegetables. This one is Sunday dinner good and very easy to make. A definite keeper!

I tried this recipe and I got sick from the under cooked meat, maby next time you should let us know that if you sit on an egg it will hatch just as fast as you burp the worm under the box provided by the hobo that lives under the stairs of your two story mansion. With all the wisdom of the world and the splillings of over flowing toilet, let us drink in honor of our fallen loafs and never forget that monkeys are the key to successful landings.

My tip for pork is to brine it overnight, stays extremely juicy and flavorful. I use a combination of kosher salt and brown sugar dissolved in boiling water.  Cool it by adding ice. Add desired herbs, garlic, rosemary.  Rinse the loin before cooking.

This was wonderful. As other reviewers did, I add garlic slices inside the pork and cooked with a tad bit of water and covered it. Loved it.

My husband made this tonight, he hates pork and hardly ever eats it...however, it was so juicy and full of flavor, we didn't have rosemary so he made it without (I'll make sure we have it on hand next time though) and instead of garlic salt he used pink sea salt and granulated garlic (local Mennonite store) 
It will be reappearing on our menu soon! Thank you so much for sharing!

It had good flavor, however nobody liked all the little rosemary spriggs all over the outside.  It was a new way to cook the tenderloin, but don't think I will repeat it.

Very good. I followed the others advice and rubbed it with olive oil, then seasonings.  I used fresh pressed garlic, seasoning salt,  and basil because I had no thyme.  I also did this in my electric rotiserie instead of the oven and my husband says its the best roast we ever had. Thanks !

This was sooo good. I definetly recommend using fresh rosemary. I used dried because I did not know dried rosemary will not soften up when cooked. I had to secretly scrape off all the rosemary from the pork before I served it, LOL. My picky 2 and 5 year old loved it. I also cooked it with potatoes and carrots.

Absolutely delicous. The roast was perfect and the juices delectable. Next time I will put potatoes and carrots in with the roast as pictured.  I am sure it will be incredible.  However, I had a 3 lb. roast for 8 people at Christmas and I prepared the roast alone following the recipe. Everyone raved.

After reading other reviews, I decided to use 1 cup olive oil with the herbs and spices added to it. I also doubled the herbs/spices which I felt was needed for a 3 lb roast. I'm glad I did....I think it helped keep the roast tender and made a nice 'herb crust' on the outside. This was the best pork roast I've ever made! It was excellent and everyone in my family loved it.

This was divine!  I followed some of the advice on here, I'm not sure if that's what made a difference or not but it was amazing.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I reconstituted it.  Some suggestions said to put in some apple juice or cider, I had neither so I put n a 1/3 cup of water with a 1/2 an apple sliced up. I braised the pork before I shook it in the bag.  I also don't use garlic salt in general so I used garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp of salt.  Then when I cooked it I cooked it covered in a Corningware dish at 325.  I served it with garlic asparagus and new potatoes.

Coat the roast with EVOO after seasoning--this will help retain the moisture.

I am not a very good cook but learning through this site. Have never posted a rating in the past but this was so good I felt I needed to say something. I used the method that Kathy advised with wrapping in foil. Although I over seasoned it a little it came out perfect. This was by far the most moist port roast I have every had. This will be my go to recipe for port for now on.

This was soon easy! I wasn't sure if it would dry out without covering it, it but the outside was crisper and very moist inside. inside This was a big hit :)

I never review recipes, but it was so good I had to! I covered mine with foil and took foil off for the last 20 mins, then while it was cooling I replaced foil. I did spices just as directed. I also had a hard time finding that size loin, usually they are just a pound. I managed to find a 2.5 lb tenderloin. I also got a package of pork gravy but next time i will use the drippings, i was just in a hurry with a hungry toddler. it was really good, although one user suggested it be seared to make the appearance better, i agree since mine was not much to look at. but the flavor was awesome!

Pretty darn good.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, adding some carrots to the baking dish.  Next time, I'll put foil over it and add a pinch of sugar to balance the seasonings.

It was my first time making pork roast and it turned out PERFECT! juicy and flavorful, but not too much flavor.
I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used 1 tsp dried, also my roast was 4 lbs. Oh and I did make a paste with olive oil.

Well I was making Rosemary Pork Roast (from this site) and altered it a bit while making it... I started looking at other recipes on the site to see if any had meal ideas while the roast was cooking.  Then I came across this roast, and realized this is what I made.  Delicious!!  So tender and juicy.  The only thing I did differently was I rubbed the roast with olive oil before cooking, and minced fresh garlic.  Served with buttery carrots (from this site) and Liptons Creamy Garlic Shells.  What a great meal!!

Used others advice and cooked it in the crockpot.  8 hours was too long and it was a little dry.  I think because of this, it didn't reheat very well at all.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and makes me seem to be a great cook.  Very moist and very flavorful.  The fresh rosemary is fabulous. I didn't have garlic salt, so I just used a little minced garlic and salt.  I also put it in a roasting bag.  I probably won't do that next time, but I will cover the pan with foil.  I also followed previous advice in the reviews and made gravy.  I won't do that again as the meat was so moist and much better without the gravy (but I am not good at gravy). This recipe goes into family favorites and will be wonderful to serve guests.

Add me to the list of fans! I made this on New Year's Eve. It was my first time EVER making a Pork Roast. I had pulled it right out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven, so it took about 2 hours to get that thermometer up to 160! But still the meat came out superb! LOVED IT!

Allrecipes should post only reviews that are of the actual recipe. When "I changed ...," or, "This is what I did ..." or any similar comments, the review should not be posted. It is unfair to the person who posted it. This recipe is excellent as is!

Very good. Did exactly as directed and was perfect.  I kept it in longer as my roast was pretty big.

This is an easy way to cook a good, moist pork roast.  It took a little longer (30 minutes) to cook than the recipe called for (my oven has been checked and does cook at an accurate termp), but the taste of the roast was excellent.

I also cut a few slits in the roast and inserted slices from a fresh clove of garlic (my Grandmother's trick), which made it even better.

AWESOME...We cooked it in the oven at 280 for 6 hours and it was HEAVEN!!  Paired it with Sweet Potato Casserole VI, (which we've been eating for 3 days!), & Cheesy Creamed Spinach!  I can NOT wait to take leftovers to work tomorrow

This was awesome. I added some celery, rainbow carrots, and red potatoes around the roast, along with 1/2c pork broth mix with 1/2 pinot grigio wine. Unbelievable. Making it again tonight.

this was so awesome for being so simple.. looking back right now at the recipe i realized i used the same amount of dried rosemary for the fresh (big oops!) but it still came out delicious.. i also doubled the pepper.. i used my mortar and pestle to grind up the rosemary for more even coverage.. bf cooked this on the grill for about the same amount of time listed for oven baking.. and we didn't have any issues with it drying out.. it was flavorful and juicy.. ty so much for the recipe

While I prefer to cook my pork roasts slowly in a smoker or charcoal grill, I use the oven in winter. To prevent the juices from being lost I first sear the meat all way around in a very hot iron pan before putting it in a glass or ceramic roasting dish - I never roast in metal pans (it's just a think I have about cooking in metal pans). Then I put on the seasonings (otherwise they will burn). I also stick some fresh sweet onion rings on top before putting it in the oven. They become sweet and succulent and add to the juices in the bottom of the pan. I use fresh thyme instead of the dried, but as I grow literally pounds of different herbs, I can dry my own, and I hate to waste them at the end of the season. Instead of regular thyme, try lemon-thyme.

Excellent  combination of herbs. A trick my mother taught me for even more flavor ( instead of using a boneless roast) have the butcher cut the meat of the bone and tie it back on to the bone. Roast the loin for 20 minutes a pound at  350 ( or 325 for convection) until thermometer registers 145. Let roast rest for 20 minutes, then cut the twine and remove the loin from the bone to slice. The bone gives so much flavor!

The flavors in the bottom of the pan were good; the meat was dry and tough, not 'melt in your mouth'.

I just tried, it was great. Because I love garlic I pressed a little, and added to mix, then put into glad ware and left in frig while I was at work, about 5 hrs, it was tender and flavorful!

GREAT COMBO OF FLAVORS, SOME GOOD SUGGESTIONS ALSO, LIKE FOIL WRAPPING.  
BUT.... THE WAY THE DIRECTIONS ARE WRITTEN...IT SEEMS TO STATE THAT ONE SHOULD PLACE THE PORK WHILE IN THE ZIP-LOCK BAG IN THE ROASTING PAN TO ROAST !

I used dried herbs and only had parsley, basil and oregano on hand, but this was still amazing! However, it did take about an hour and a half for the pork to cook, so definitely use a thermometer!

This recipe is so simple it's hard to believe it will come out great, but it does! Moist and flavorful. I think I'll add alittle flour and water to the juice and make a simple gravy next time (like in the picture). Enjoy!

For all the rave reviews this recipe received, I was a bit let down. It was alright, but not great, not even all that good. Ended up pitching the leftovers because no one wanted them. Will probably not make this again =(

Yum! This was simple and tasty. I did go ahead and cook it for an hour and a half just to be safe and took off the foil for the last 20 minutes to brown it. I also put in a bit of olive oil - the rub seemed too dry. I only had a 1 lb. roast but I didn't halve the recipe - glad I didn't. It didn't make enough juice though so I couldn't make gravy, which was a shame because I had made mashed potatoes!

This is such a delicious and simple way to prepare a pork roast.  We absolutely love this and make it quite often.  Sometimes I omit the rosemary and use savory leaves instead, but either way it's very tasty!

LOVE this recipe! It's perfect for the new cook. Even parred down for a grocery store pork tenderloin (with dried rosemary), it was a delicious meal! Very juicy and tender. Also, it's great with "Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes." Thanks for posting!

My family loved this recipe.  My husband even thought that I had bought the roast pre-seasoned.  One change I made was to put it in the crock pot and cook it on low for about 7 hours.

Very quick and easy and VERY tasty. I scaled down the recipe for a 1lb roast. I actually had to cook this for about an hour and 10-15 minutes...cooking time for larger roasts may be longer.

This roast was quite simply the best roast my family has ever eaten. The flavor was amazing, it was easy to prepare, and the only complaint I got was "that wasn't enough". My husband loved it so much he insists that I cook this for ALL of my in-laws next week. It makes me feel good to know that this is something he wants to brag about to his family that I can do.  In one word HEAVEN.  Thank you, Marianne Campbell!!

My roast was smaller, and I used a little more rosemary (I have a glut!) and I think it tasted better.  I added some onions, potatoes and carrots to the pot as well.

Tasty! The entire family loved this. Not the best looking with regard to presentation, pale on the exterior and light pink on the inside. If I hadn't used a temperature probe I may have cooked it longer and ruined it. But it was perfection, moist,tender and tasty. I will make this again.

This is my first review here, and I am happy to make it a positive one.  This pork roast was very simple to make, which is a big plus for someone like me who likes to keep things simple, and doesn't like to spend time searching for dozens of ingredients at the supermarket.  It took an hour and a half to cook my roast, probably because it was not completed defrosted.  The roast turned out very juicy and tender, but I didn't care for the rosemary leaves:  it felt like I was eating a christmas tree.  The flavor was rather bland, perhaps more salt, or some kind of sauce would have added some zing.  But, overall, this is a fine recipe that I will probably use again, because of it's simplicity and the decent taste.

I have never been a fan of pork, or pork roasts.  I am glad I tried this recipe!  I put everything in a big zip bag and let it marinate overnight.  It was wonderful!  Lots of good flavor and my kids even at it.  The gravy I made was just a bit strong, but still good with mashed red potatoes (skin on).

This was fantastic! My toddler, who likes pork, cleaned her plate. I would not change a thing about this recipe as is and will definitely be making it again!

I served this with whipped potatoes, butter braised brussel sprouts, and honey roasted carrots. A farmhouse ale rounded out my meal.

I really like this recipe for a Pork Roast.  It was real easy and used ingredients that I already had in the house.  Real simple to prepare and just put in the oven, can't get any easier than that.  In fact easier than getting in the car for take out.  When I removed the roast from the pan I added a little water to loosen up the hardened drippings.  Add a little flour mixed with water and poured over the sliced Pork Roast.  It came out really tender and moist.

My roast was a boneless butt that was tied when bought.
Used recipe but cooked in crockpot.  Was delicious.  Shared with a friend, he took a bite and said "that is great."

We roasted it exactly according to the recipe, internal temp at 145 degrees, but it was chewy and a bit dry.  We used the drippings and some chicken stock to make a gravy that helped somewhat.

"Transfer to baking dish" means REMOVE from bag and place in baking dish..... Seriously, I got a good laugh out of that one.

Excellent Dish!!  Had my 2 adult daughters over for dinner tonight and made this for the first time ~ Everyone Loved IT!  Made exactly as written with just a dash of salt instead of the full teaspoon.  Was fast enough for a week night dinner, but tasted like a nice restaurant meal.  I eat a lot of chicken in my diet and have a difficult time coming up with different variations ~ I Will Definitely make again and again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing this lovely dish!!

Made this in the crock pot with a little apple juice (as another review suggested) and broiled for 5 minutes to make a crust. We ate the entire roast at one sitting. It's in the rotation for sure. And I think the fresh rosemary and two teaspoons of garlic salt were the key ingredients.

I gave it a 5  for flavor but I started the seasoned roast at 425 for half an hour then reduced to 350 until the roast registered 145 on my meat thermometer. It was delish.

I rubbed with spices and cooked in my crock pot adding a cup of chicken broth and a pkg of onion soup mix. It cooked on low for 6 hours and was truly delicious. I made a great pork gravy that I  drizzled on the cut pork when served. I would definitely make again.

Great flavor and moist meat!  Forty minutes was plenty at 350 to bring the internal temp to 145 F.  I put it under the broiler briefly to enhance the appearance, which was very pale and not as appetizing as if it had been browned.  Next time, I'll brown it lightly after seasoning and before putting it in the oven.  
Thanks, Marianne, for posting this recipe!  My guests loved it, even those who don't care for garlic.

I rubbed my roast with butter before seasoning and used the drippings to base it like a turkey 3/4 times during cooking. I also wrapped it loosely in foil and dropped the heat to 325 for about 90min. I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes to add color. No problems with it being dry! I served mashed potatoes, broccoli, and croissants - yummy!

Very flavorful roast. I followed the recommendation made in other reviews and cut fresh garlic into slivers, cut slits around the roast and tucked the slivers into them. I also quickly seared the roast on all sides in 1 Tblespoon of hot oil.  I followed the rest of the cooking instructions. 1 hour at 350 was perfect. I brought my roast out when it registered 145, let it rest 15-20 minutes. It was yummy.  
I also added cut carrots, potatoes and onion tossed in olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt around the roast while it cooked. They turned out yummy too.

Delicious and super easy.  I drizzled it with a tablespoon of olive oil before sprinkling the seasonings on it.  At 145F, it was still too pink for pork IMO so I cooked it to 160.  Served it sliced, ladled the pan drippings over it.  Wonderful.

A real husband pleaser, even though I made a few "downgrade" substitutions in order to avoid buying new herbs/spices.  Easy and delicious.

This recipe is just "ok". Definitely needs more seasoning, the meat came out fairly bland.

Made this recipe tonight but I did make some changes...
I usually cook sirloin tip beef roast so I adapted my recipe with that to this recipe.  Everything above except I added 1 can of beef consomme and 1 can of cream of chic soup together and pour over the roast after using the spice mix as a rub and marinating for at least 1 hour.  I then cooked it ( 5 lb roast) for 4 hrs. Turned out great!  Not dry at all...I added potatoes around the roast in the soup mixture and they were cooked tender.  The roast had just the right about of herb taste to it.  I will make a stew out of the leftovers tomorrow by putting all the roast meat, juice & potatoes in a large pot, then add more fresh potatoes and a large can of tomatoe juuice and finish the pot about 2 inches from top with water and slow simmer for 4 hours or more.  Add lots of salt at beginning and add pepper throughout...add macaronie bout a hour before serving.  I also put my leftover veggies from the night before in the stew...corn and butter beans.  Very Good on a Rainy Day!!

I made this in the crock pot instead of the oven, and used fresh minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  Doubled the amount of spices and shook half of them with the pork, the other half with some carrots, potatoes, onions and green beans.  It was great, even without any added salt.  The combination of herbs gave this a great flavor - will make again!

I wanted to make open face sandwiches with gravy but was surprised I couldn't find a recipe on this site. I used this as a jumping off point for the meat. I ended up using 1/2 t salt, 1/4 t pepper, 1/4 t thyme, 1/4 t onion powder, 1/4 t garlic powder, and 1/4 t celery seed. I would have added rosemary too but I didn't have it on hand. I added about 2 C of water and cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. It came out great and the cooking liquid made delicious gravy. Although it wasn't true to the recipe, it was perfect for my sandwiches and I wanted to post a review in case anyone else is looking to do the same!

Made this for dinner last night.  Everyone loved it!  We liked it so much, we are having it again tonight.  The only difference I used was Garlic powder instead of Garlic salt (we try to limit salt in our house).  YUMMY!

This was pretty good, I like my way better.  I did use a large shoulder blade pork roast, (99 cents a pound!!) and forgot the garlic, put that on at the last minute.  Might try this again, but like I said, we prefer mine: season with Tony Cachere's, garlic powder, onion powder.  That's it.  Might do the olive oil thang, tho, it did give it a nice crust.

This is a great recipe. My pork roast turned out really juicy and full of flavor. Used dried rosemary instead of fresh because that is what I had and will not do that again but still was a hit with my family. Will use again.
THANKS!!!

Excellent roast. I used a 2 1/4 lb pork butt roast, doubled the rosemary and cut it up and double thyme, 2 t of salt and lots of pepper. I rubbed in the dry herbs and then massaged olive oil on the roast. I roasted it for 1 hour and 20 minutes. This roast is juicy and moist and tender and has so much flavor!

This was my first time ever making a pork roast so I followed the recipe to a T and it tasted Wonderful! I will definatly buy a pork roast again and in the future I'll try to do it in the crock pot with all the other reviewer's suggestions. Thanks Marianne!

I thought the flavor of this was great EXCEPT it was a bit too salty.  If I make this again, I think I will make it with less garlic salt and add garlic powder.  Overall it was good though if you didn't eat a big piece of the outside cut.

Fantastic recipe, and easy for a novice meat cooker like myself.  I followed the suggestion to insert sliced garlic into the roast and to wrap in foil.  I also halved the recipe since I had a 1-1/2 pound roast.  Very easy and tasty!

That was so good. Something about it was a little too salty and if you don't like rosemary much don't try this recipe. But we really liked it. The roast came out perfect with this crusty outer layer(I used dried rosemary, not fresh) and moist and flavorful. Will make again.

This recipe is definitely worth keeping. I was afraid it was going to be bland, due to the small amount of ingredients. This recipe is not even close to bland. The kids and hubby loved it. Thank you, we are always looking for a good, fast to put together meal.

We love making this recipe, but we modified it a little bit. A few hours before cooking, we prepare as directed, but add some olive oil (about 2T) and let the whole bag of pork and seasoning marinate. YUM!

Mmmmm, just lovely!  SO simple - you should definitely add this one to your list of lazy dinners!  The cooking does take some time (I had a half pound roast that took a full hour), but you don't have to fuss with it, so you can do other things while it's cooking.  Way better than what my Mom used to do with roast, because the flavor is on all sides.

This turned out well.  I made a few changes; I sliced four cloves of garlic and inserted them into incisions I made in the roast.  I took some others advice and cooked it for 30 minutes covered and then an hour uncovered.  I will make this again!

I thought this was excellent!!! Mine took almost an hour and a half.  I added cubed potatoes seasoned with the pork seasoning to my pan and covered with foil.  Everything turned out excellent! Will definitely make again!!

I was looking for a new way to cook pork roast when I came upon this recipe. My family really enjoyed this new way. Although for those who live in high elevations, please remember to adjust the cooking time. It took my roast 2 hours to cook and I followed the directions to a tee.

This was so easy and yet so delicious.  The key is the fresh rosemary.  I have to caution others though to cook the pork about 15 to 20 minutes longer.  Thanks for the posting.  I will definitely make this again and again!!

This recipe was definately EASY- an undeniable plus, but my 2 lb. roast took almost 2 full hours to reach 160. It also came out a bit dry. Next time I'll keep foil over top for the first half of cooking to keep in some moisture. And I definately didn't get enough juice to make gravy. It was still quite tasty, though!

This was very, very good.  My brother was in from Florida so I had my father and his wife over for dinner.  Everyone but my 15 year old daughter liked it.  My father has been raving about it ever since (and this is totally out of character for him).  Just be sure not to overcook it!

I threw in some italian bread crumbs, about 1/3 cup, with the seasonings. The meat turned out nice and juicy. I agree the combined seasonings gave it a great flavor.

We were turkeyed out and has this for Christmas dinner instead and what a fabulous choice it turned out to be.  My whole family loved this - my only suggestion is don't serve another herby dish with it - plain mashed potatoes etc are much better and let you truly enjoy the wonderful flavor of this roast!  Thanks Marianne for a wonderful recipe!!!!!

My roast is cooking right now (i will update review after it is finished), but I used a boneless half loin 4 lbs. and this does not seem like nearly enough spices.  Mine is definitely NOT thoroughly coated.  I tried to spread it around as much as possible.  I increased the amounts some to accomodate the larger loin.  Did anyone else find this to be a problem.  I want to make this for an event next week and was just testing it out tonight on the family.  ANY ADVICE FROM ANYONE?

So simple and delicious - I substituted Summer Savory for Rosemary (not a fan of it).  Seasoned the meat a few hours in advance.  We loved the spice combination - served it with Mashed Potatos and Baked Pineapple Casserole which is on this site.

I did this in my crockpot, and it was incredibly moist.  If I was to do it again I would do sprigs of rosemary and reduce the salt.  I had to add water, since my roast was frozen, so I added all of the spices directly to the pot and basted often.  Ended up cutting back on the salt taste by serving it over rice.  Pretty good, even with my mistakes.

This was really good! Mine turned out a little dry, but that was totally my fault...I wasn't paying attention to the cooking time and overcooked it just a tad. It was really tasty though! My picky husband liked it! I will make this again!

I did not use the plastic bag, but marinated in the actual cooking pan (ceramic with glass lid).  Added diced sweet potatoes and carrots around the sides with white wine vinegar, black cherry juice and water (about a 1 1/2 cups total), then coated the roast with minced garlic, sprinkled with pepper and salt, then drizzled with olive oil.  Cooked 3lb roast for 1 hour 10 minutes, but checked after 45 minutes.  It was perfectly cooked, very moist and delicious (butcher box.com  meat).  I will make this again, but will use red wine and water for the liquid instead.

It was good and tender but hard to cut since it wasn't a solid piece of meat but a rolled one. I used a boneless pork loin that had a stringed netting on it. I prefer pork tenderloin, which is much easier for slicing that I'll use the next time. The seasoning was simple but flavorful. (I used dried organic rosemary instead of fresh.) There were no drippings for gravy. Probably because all the juices were in the meat which is better anyway since it makes the meat more tender. I let it sit for 15 minutes before slicing.

I made this roast. It was moist and delicious.  The only change I made was adding smoked paprika, cayenne, and more garlic, and let it rest for 20 minutes. It was amazing.

I pressure cooked this in my instant pot because I was really short on time.  Instead of coating the roast in the seasonings, I sliced the roast and then layered it on the bottom of the pot, added 1 cup of water, sprinkled a generous measure of the seasonings over the surface of the meat, and cooked on high for 90 minutes.  The broth is gorgeous and the meat flaked apart beautifully for pork wraps!  Definitely will be making this again.

Did it exactly to the recipe and have never made a better pork roast in my life so far.  Thank you for a delicious and very easy recipe.  I'm just a beginner and I've been having problems with my pork cooking.  Thanks to Allrecipes and recipes like this my wife is impressed!

This was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add some pineapple juice in the bottom of my roasting pan to keep it from drying out.

Great combination of herbs for the New Year's pork roast. I didn't coat the roast but only rubbed the herbs on top. Surrounded the roast with sauerkraut. Maybe it was that, or maybe the meat was still a little frozen, but it took some extra cooking time to get up to 145F, and yet it was not dry at all. Came out tender and juicy and delicious.

This is so easy! I didn’t use the same spice profile, rather I relied on Penzey’s Ozark Blend. The bag technique produces even coverage. My roast was 1.8 lbs and 1 hour @ 350 (in foil wrap) with time to rest was perfect. Leftovers will be perfect for cubano sandwiches.

So good and so tender. Worked better with smaller pork loin, a bigger pork loin wasn’t as tender. Used dried rosemary instead of fresh

DIdn't have fresh rosemary so I substituted dried, using about 2/3 of what the recipe stated for the fresh version. Also, my husband is allergic to garlic so I used onion salt instead. It was a hit.

Delicious and easy! I put my dry seasonings in a bowl including fresh rosemary from the garden. Then I used yellow mustard to make it all stick together and slathered it on the top and sides of the pork. I don't ever use garlic salt, just powdered garlic. It was moist and tender, will certainly make it again.

The video is different than the recipe in that the recipe says to toss the roast in a bag with spices & the video shows oil poured over the roast & spices being rubbed on. I used the oil method. The roast was delicious & 50 minuets per lb was perfect. I will use this recipe again. (I also used saurkraut, apple & onion shown at the bottom of the recipe). The second time I made this roast I didn’t use sauerkraut. I put onions and peeled, oiled onions around the roast. Again, it was delicious!

This is so simple it's almost embarrasing.  I had a pork loin in the freezer because Kroger had a BOGO.  So for $5.00 I had a really great meal - and sandwiches the next day.  The best thing about this recipe is how few ingredients get used to deliver a wonderful meal.  That's really the key to making this successfully - keep it simple.

Very good, wonderful flavors.  I used a pork tenderloin that was a little over 1lb, so I adjusted the seasoning a little.  I also added potatoes, carrots and onions to the pan while roasting.  A very easy one pan meal! Love it!

My pork loin turned out fabulous! I’m not a fancy cook but decided to expand my wings and create a meal which used AllRecipes as my guide.  I don’t have fennel, so I substituted oregano in its place. I just placed double batch of pork loin into my huge roasting pan, rubbed the seasoning mixture on both sides and added a few tablespoons of water to the pan and roasted for an hour. The meat reached 150 degrees F. I rested the meat for about 20 minutes in the pan out of the oven. The meat was moist, savory, and well very received.

Seasoned pork loin pieces instead of a whole roast.  They were delicious. Will season pork this way again and again in the future.

Marinated in olive oil & the spices.  Pan seared 1st and baked for 15 minutes since I used cutlets.   Turned out really well.  I don't have thyme because I don't like that spice.  Used sage & parsley in place of.  Very juicy.

I have made my own version before.  I brown and cook it stove top in a Dutch oven.  Then I brown cooked small potatoes in the Dutch oven to add flavor to them.

I used my Pampered Chef deep covered baker and micro waved this instead of baking.  Still very tender and a lot less time!!

It was very good, next time going to try adding the seasoning inside the roast as well as the outside to get the flavor through out.

I used garlic powder, not garlic salt.  I tried to use the bag but the spices would not spread evenly so I used it as a dry rub and it worked fine.

Super easy to make, and in the oven for an hour makes it turn out perfectly! Used only salt pepper and garlic powder, but that's all you need. Ate with a side of brussle sprouts and rice. I'll definitely be making this more.

I followed the recipe almost exactly - just didn't have garlic salt so used salt and garlic powder.  I also needed to cook it an additional 10 min. at 375 to get to the right temperature. When sliced and  on our plates - the roast was wonderful!!! The rosemary and seasonings made a wonderful crust full of  flavor. I will definitely make this again!

This rub was delicious.  I used dried Rosemary because it's what I had.  I don't know why I never though to use a rub on a roast in a zip  top bag?!?!  Genious! I used my digital meat thermometer and it came out perfect with a nice spice crust on the exterior.

I love the simplicity of cooking this meat. I made a few changes, such as the amount of meat, created a gravy for topping and cooked to 150 degrees.
The meal was splendiferous.

The only change we made was the cooked temp, we cooked it to 177deg.  It was still a bit pink for our tastes at 143deg. It went fantastic with the roasted vegetables recipe from this site. (Brussels Sprouts, Butternut Squash, Parsnips, Carrots and Sweet Potatoes)

I used boneless pork roast and put it on spit in gas grill for same amount of time. It was delicious.  I did not have fresh rosemary, used dried but used pestle and motar on all herbs. Made this in both oven and spit. Loved it both ways

I added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil to bottom of the pan and then made a gravy out of the drippins. Served it with either rice or mashed potatoes. Either one makes a great meal that my family keeps asking me to make!!

I had a frozen pork loin, so I combined all ingredients in a large zip top bag and thawed in the frig, allowing the meat to be seasoned as it thawed.  (I love rosemary, so I probably used more than  the recipe called for.)  I cooked as in the recipe, just over an hour (it was closer to 4 pounds) until it reached 140 degrees.  So moist and flavorful--I'll definitely do this again.

Love this recipe! I always used garlic and rosemary, but this one came out even better. I like to cook potatoes, carrots and celery with this to make a meal, along with applesauce, have to have my applesauce with pork!

this roast was wonderful, i followed the recipe except added some extra seasoning and deleting the salt.  I like more seasoning than most people.  It was very moist and savory, only suggestion would be to brown the outside in the last few minutes.

This was really good.  I rubbed the roast with olive oil as suggested by others, and I also used dried rosemary.  I only used 1 tsp of garlic salt.  It had a great flavor and was very simple.

We didn't have fresh rosemary, so we used the dried rosemary and added olive oil to make a paste.  The pork smelled very strong while cooking, and I ended up having to wipe a lot of the seasonings off before eating it.  Good taste, but a little too much of a good thing.  After tinkering with it a bit we'll definitely make this again.

What a hit this was for my family.  I am asked to prepare it all the time.  No more slow cooking a pork roast for us!

Simple (hubby prepared!), delicious, tasty. The children didn't care for this so I would probably not make for them again but it is nice for adults. Thank you.

This recipe is excellent - so simple and delicious.  Roast came out so tender and very moist.  This is a keeper.

Very simple which is always worth at least one star! Was very juicy which I was worried about because it did not ask for any liquid or even to cover it.  It did take much longer to cook.  I cooked mine for "atleast" 1 1/2 hours. Turned out well and my whole family enjoyed it

I made this dish the other night, and it was great. My family is soooo picky, but they really enjoyed this moist and taste meal.

Very nice recipe. And so simple. I used two small pork tenderloins weighing about one pound each. The meat was flavorful and soft. My daughter said, "This is some good pork tenderloin" and said it was different and not tough like others that she had. Will make this many more times.
