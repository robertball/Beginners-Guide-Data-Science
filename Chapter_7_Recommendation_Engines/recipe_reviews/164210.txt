I halved this recipe. I did drizzle a little EVOO over the onions before baking and the mayonnaise I used was reduced fat. I made no other changes. I actually made this the night before last as I wanted it to sit in the fridge for as long as possible before using. This. Is. MONEY. I used this in a BLT Sandwich Wrap for dinner last night and let me tell you, it made the wrap incredible. I don't know why I haven't heard of this before but you bet that I'll make this frequently. This would be a wonderful addition to homemade ranch dressing or Secret Sauce. What a killer idea!

THIS ROCKS!!!!  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  The roasting of the onions brings out the flavor.  This was delicious on hamburgers, but our favorite thing is to use it as a french fry dipping sauce.  Everyone I have served this to, loves it.  Great stuff.  Thank you!

This was awesome.  I am having burgers tomorrow so I wanted something with alittle zing and this is it.  I used about 3/4 cup of mayo and 1 medium onion.  Cut the onion into fourths and added 2 cloves of garlic...drizzled with EVOO and salt and pepper, cooked for about 35 minutes and let my blender do the rest....AWESOME

We really, really enjoyed this mayonnaise recipe! I read how Roxanne was hoping for more carmalization on her onions, so instead of just cutting them in half I cut them into thick slices and placed them on the cookie sheet with 3 cloves of garlic as well. I brushed on a little evoo and sprinkled w/ freshly ground black pepper and sea salt. Halfway through roasing, I flipped them over and everything was nice and caramel colored. I also made this a day in advance to allow the flavors to blend better. This was sooooo delicious on our mushroom swiss burgers. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :) NOTE: This makes a wonderful dipping sauce for french fries and onion rings!!!

I found that I could have more control over the caramelization process if I put some EVOO and a pat of butter in a saute pan, sliced my onions into thin rings, and caramelized them that way. I seasoned the onion slices (I used one large onion--the size of a fist) with a light sprinkling sea salt, fresh ground pepper, smoked sweet paprika, and some garlic powder.The process was easier on the old electric bill this way too. The onions were sauted on a medium-low heat until nicely caramelized--about 25 minutes, and then left to cool. I added the onions to 1/2 cup of mayo and blended in my blender, and let sit in the container overnight in the refrigerator. The end result was a pretty light golden brown colored mayo and the taste was fantastic on the burgers I made for the family. I will make this again and keep some in a container in the fridge. This onion mayo would be good as a dip for baked potato wedges or on other types of sandwiches.

A definite MUST TRY!  I made this for homemade Frisco Burgers.  I used yellow onion - IMO, it has more onion flavor - chopped in half, then into quarters.  Sprinkled with a bit of kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, and EVOO.  Added a couple of sprinkles of garlic powder at the end so it wouldn't burn.  I only used 1 onion and added about 1/2 cup of mayo.  It was plenty for us, and there is some for leftovers.  I would recommend to let the flavors mingle, as the other reviewers do, with the mayo overnight, but it's also good right away.  This is now our burger mayo!  YUM!  (My husband doesn't even like mayo, but he'll eat this.) =)

I love caramelized onions so I had a feeling I would love this mayonnaise. The only problem I had is the fact that my onion didn't get a nice caramel colour all over but it had that wonderful smell and was very soft by the time 30 minutes had past. Only the edges seemed to get caramelized in looks. It smelled wonderful when I processed it but I should have left it to sit before using it for the flavours to meld better. I will make again, maybe I'll cut the onion pieces smaller (so they'd have the caramelized look all over) cause I was hoping the mayo would have a nice colour from the onions. Thanks for sharing!

I used this tonight after viewing this recipe. I blended in my magic bullet, and it came out extraordinary. I used two medium white onions, instead of sweet, and it still have a wonderful flavouring to it. Thank you! Such a classic!

Made this last night for "sandwich night."  My husband loved it and I thought it was pretty good.  I had to roast the onions for quite a bit longer than the 30 minutes called for.  And I still didn't have the caramelization I thought I should have.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and cut the onion into large slices instead of halves.  Otherwise this was a quick and easy recipe.  I think it would be great over burgers.

I thought this would be better. I thought it was a little bland. Not bad but I don't think I would make it again.

I also cut my onion in thick slices & made a day ahead. This was very good. I think next time I'll add garlic too-yum!

Unfortunately, I had some Japanese Mayonnaise that was about to go bad and I used it as a 'test' for this recipe. It doesn't taste bad but I KNOW it would be better with Real American Mayo...! I gave it a 5 but what I made was about a 2.75...lol

I used one half cup of the carmelized yellow onions that I make in big batches in my slow cooker. Added a few drops of lime juice. Delicious.

I only made ¼ of this recipe because I used it as a substitution for Spicy Mustard with German Sausage.  It was great!  I used Scallions instead of Sweet Onions, and added Cayenne Pepper for a kick.  Next time I will make the full batch because I think it would go great as a spread for a Pastrami on Rye or any other sandwich.
