Love the addition of red onion!  I used dried parsley vs. fresh as I didn't have any on hand and used all dill pickle.  I also added a bit of garlic and onion powders and some salt and pepper.

I made this with some trepidation because I generally despise sweet pickles.

I was pleasantly surprised that this was so delicious!  I loved the onion in it especially.  Thank you!!

Ok, I hate to rate a recipe when I didn't follow it exactly, but this was so good!  I didn't have red onion or celery, but I used the rest of the ingredients (adding to onion powder, salt and pepper) and the pickles just made this FABULOUS.  I can't stop eating it!  Thank you!  It can only get better with celery and onion, I'll try that next time....

I used a few tbs of light miracle whip instead of all that mayonnaise, because I wanted less calories, and it was delicious! I halved everything but the tuna and ate it plain... it was crunchy and delicious! Will make again as a sandwich or on crackers :)

Really tasty!  I added 1/4 cup of red, yellow, and orange sweet peppers (combined) as well as the juice of 1 lime with some lime zest.  None left if that says how good it was and how much they liked it.

Best way to fix tuna salad!  I did cut the sweet and dill pickle in half and doubled the tuna (the cans are smaller now and we love tuna).  Did not have celery so tossed in some celery flakes and added a chopped egg.

Fantastic! Lots of crunch!  I did veer off the ingredient list a tad bit.  I didn't have any dill pickle or parsley on hand. I added 2 tbsp diced green pepper, 1 tsp mustard and 1/2 tsp lemon pepper seasoning.  In addition, I subbed Veganaise for the mayonnaise.  It made for a great afternoon snack with crackers.

super quick, easy, and delicious! I made this for my husband and I on a hot day! I did not have red onion so i used a green onion, stalk and all, instead, and sweet pickle relish since it was easier to grab!! such good flavor and i was happy to have all ingredients in the fridge! the biggest plus was i didn't need to turn the oven on at all!

Great recipe. Very tasty. Next time about half the mayo. I didn't have any pickles. I added 2 tsp  of sweet relish and 1/8 tsp of dill weed. This recipe is a keeper.

This tuna salad works great on sandwiches, with crackers, and in tuna melts. Really tasty with all of those flavors. I've made this recipe several times this summer already.

I cut the mayo in half to reduce calories but otherwise followed the recipe.  Quick, easy and delish!   Next time I'll add some green pepper.

We loved this tuna salad especially because it called for two kinds of pickles.  We never would have done that but it really makes for a wonderful dish.  We did replace the celery with hard boiled eggs and it came out beautifully and we highly recommend this recipe!!

This was good. Not as good as New Wife Tuna Salad on this site, but a crunchy, tasty tuna. It does need some salt/pepper/garlic powder.

I really enjoyed this!  The family did too.  I made it exactly as directed and I wouldn't change anything.  Served it on toasted wheat bread with crisp lettuce.  Great lunch!
