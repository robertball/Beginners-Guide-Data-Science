These things are amazing! (Or at least my fingers taste great!) And looks so much easier than the recipe that comes on the bag of the coconut! The only problem I had with this, was knowing exactly when they were done...the edge looked brown, but the insides seemed squishy still. Is that the way it's supposed to be?...Edit-Never mind! :) They harden up when they cool! This is my first attempt at macaroons if you can't tell. LOL This was so easy!!! Thank you for such a great recipe!

These were excellent! I brought them to my xmas cookie exchange and they were a big hit. Instead of covering half of the macaroon with chocolate, I drizzled with chocolate. I thought they looked prettier. I tried 2 half-dipped and they didn't look very appetizing.
