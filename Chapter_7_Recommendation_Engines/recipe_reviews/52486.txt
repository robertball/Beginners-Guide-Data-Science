I wish I had followed SunnyByrd's suggestion to add a splash of lemon juice and walnuts - I think that would have really pulled this salad together. As is is was good, but it could have been great!

This is a good recipe and everyone at our party gobble it up.  When I smashed the raspberries I did not get to much juice.  I added about 1 tablespoon of Raspberry Walnut vinaigrette I had on hand too.  I also sprinkled some sliced almonds on top.  Yum will make again for sure.

I, too, took sunnybyrd's suggestion of adding nuts and lemon juice; I used toasted pecans.  I also added grilled chicken and made it a main dish. Great flavor combos!

I made this for Easter dinner.  I didn't have blueberries, so I left them out, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  While it was pretty good, we thought the dressing needed something to jazz it up a little - maybe some herbs or garlic?  I'll try it again next time I have fresh berries and experiment a little.

Edible, but just ok compared to some of the other summer salads out there.  Added the splash of lemon juice and walnuts.

The combination of ingredients was good.  However I wasn't pleased with the dressing.  Maybe it would have been better with lemon like others have added.  But it didn't turn out well for me.  I think I would have been better off just using a store bought raspberry vinaigrette.

Delish!  I did not cook the snap peas and I added green onion and blackberries - sprinkled with lemon and did not have any nuts, so used sunflower seeds - yummy!!!

No raspberries in the market but did have nice blackberries. I threw the snap peas in raw...topped with blue cheese and walnuts. Great salad!

Seasonal berries combined with sugar snap peas from the garden - how can you go wrong?  I also added toasted walnuts, and tossed in the sugar snap peas raw.  This made a delightful summer salad.

Good recipe & very adaptable. I used blackberries instead of raspberries & more salad greens & sugar snap peas because we love them. Took others suggestion and added walnuts & feta cheese.  Since we didn't have time to let it sit very long & to save time we just used a raspberry vinaigrette instead of the raspberry vinegar & crushing the berries. Will make again for sure. You can microwave the sugar snap peas instead of boiling also, just watch the time.

This is a very good recipe, but i felt like the addition of some sort of cheese and nuts would have taken this to another level. I'll make again, but add the additional items to make it a 5 star recipe.

Added the lemon juice and walnuts suggested by others and some feta, like in the picture. I do think it would have been bland without these changes.

I only had snow peas, mixed greens and fruit. I made a strawberry, oil and vinegar seasoned dressing. It was very good.

I tried this last night, basically because my wife loves the sugar snap peas and I love raspberries!  She decided she didn't want salad and she at rib-eye instead.  I ate the whole batch of salad and NO steak!  Guess what I'm making again TONIGHT?  This salad is quite yummy!

Loved this recipe! I couldn't find raspberry vinegar so I just used Whole Foods Raspberry vinegrette and is was wonderful!
