I made as per recipe and took them to church for an after services snack.  I thought they tasted good.. not very sweet which I liked.  My issue with these is they fall apart.  I cut them when they had cooled... crumbled. I chilled them in the fridge, they crumbled. The only way I was able to get a nice cut was to freeze them and then cut them.  I would recommend baking them with foil so you can lift the whole thing out of the pan and then wrap in the foil to freeze before cutting.  They dont get hard.. not at all, but at least they held together better  . I dont think kids would like these as they are not very sweet .. but I liked them a lot

Loved the taste - but very crumbly - am trying to figure out how to make them stick together without the freezing prior to cutting.
