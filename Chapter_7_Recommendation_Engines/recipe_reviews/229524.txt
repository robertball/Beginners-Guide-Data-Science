I don't keep instant rice in the house, I used regular long grain rice in place of the instant. It just took a little longer to cook. I also used a red bell pepper instead of green and lime juice instead of lemon juice. The boys really liked this rice, especially the youngest. I'd make this again.

We made a meal of this browning boneless, skinless chicken breasts first, remove, cover and setting aside in a warm oven, then proceeding with recipe. I did leave the tomato sauce out and thought it was plenty "tomato-y". Used brown rice which has a 50 minute cook time, so after 30 minutes I nestled the breasts back in the rice, covered again quickly, and cooked an additional 20 minutes, I also added a cup of defrosted peas when adding the chicken back. Left out the sugar and gave gave a generous squeeze of lemon over all when finished. I would definitely make this again! Look forward to the leftovers for lunch! Thank you!

I have tried this twice now. First time I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a little bland for my taste. Second time instead of using vegetable juice I used pure tomato juice. Also instead of tomato sauce I used paste. I also added a clove of fresh garlic and a dash of cilantro. I then topped it with mild cheddar cheese and put it in the oven just to melt the cheese. This resulted in a much better finished product and more smiling faces at the dinner table.

I followed the instructions without the v8 juice and I thought it was fantastic.  I also used brown rice instead,  but it was still the instant variety so I didn't have to adjust cook times. Loved it!

Even after leaving out the tomato sauce completely, this was too tomato-y for us.  The sweet, tomato flavor totally predominated this as a side dish.

It was definitely more intricate of a recipe, than my grandma used to make. It really didn’t have enough flavor though. My husband did like it though.

Great recipe. I didn’t have bell pepper to add but it still turned out perfect and tasted great!
