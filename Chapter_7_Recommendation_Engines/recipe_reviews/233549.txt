Very good! Thick, rich and flavorful...everything a good pizza sauce should be. I did cut the dried basil in 1/2 b/c dried basil gets too strong for me, but that was my only change. I will be using this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I did my best to stick to the recipe: no fennel, sugar or bay leaf. Added a sprinkling of marjoram. Wonderful! No heat, great for the kids. Perfect flavor and thick yummy goodness! I like heat and for me would add flakes or something, but! ultimately, I prefer toppings for heat. So, there ya go!

The sauce was thick and chunky as described.  It tasted like the sauce on frozen pizza; which we don't like.  I cut the celery and onion in half.  Added 2 tsps. of sugar.  It was still bitter.  It made enough sauce for 2 pizzas.  I will be working on my own recipe.  Homemade is so easy! Thanks
