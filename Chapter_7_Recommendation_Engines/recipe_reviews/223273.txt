I wanted spinach balls tonight. I had seen this recipe and thought it would be similar, especially if I made them as mini muffins rather than regular size. I'm glad I did. I really think this recipe could benefit from extra herbs like sage, thyme, and basil. I also wish it had had an amount for the salt. I added salt, but not enough. I enjoyed these tonight as a side but in the future will use my personal spinach ball recipe over this one.

These tasted very much like spinach. I even added a bit of feta, but the spinach overpowered it.  Next time, I will try with maybe a 1/2 of flour and some chopped garlic instead of the powder... that might make a difference.

I doubled the amount of all the spices and it turned out pretty well. They taste worse more an hour after cooking, so I'd recommend eating these right after baking.

I made the following modifications: substituted 1/2 cup green onions instead of onion powder, doubled the paprika, upped the salt & pepper, and added 1 tbsp garlic paste. This was an easy, great way to incorporate spinach into your diet.
