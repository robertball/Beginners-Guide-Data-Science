These are absolutely fantastic. And a little hint to those who didn't like it... ummm... it helps if you like pineapple in the first place. Why attempt to make a 'pizza' with something you don't like? That makes your review a slightly moot point I hate to say. However this recipe is tastier with jarred pizza sauce instead of tomato paste. Tomato paste is just a little too harsh for the sausage/pineapple combination. And if you want it a little more like a Donatos Hawaiian sprinkle some cinnamon on it as well. Very good and thanks for the idea!

Good simple recipe. Great for kids. Not sure why the people who don't like pineapple even bothered making it... never mind rating it.

I didn't like these too much. Managed to eat 1 of the 4 I had made for me and a friend. Was just too sweet for me needed more of a taste other than just pineapple. Only reason I'm rating this a 3 and not a 1 or 2 is because my friend absolutely loved them.

Great quick lunch or dinner idea. I had pizza sauce (rather than tomato paste) and English muffins to use up when I found this recipe. The flavors in this little pizza blend very well together. I had a fresh pineapple so I used it rather than canned. DH enjoyed it so much for dinner that he made another for lunch the next day since I still had ingredients left. Thanks Michele O'Sullivan for sharing your pizza recipe.

This is a great fast recipe with ingredients I always have on hand!! For my life I cant understand people making a Pineapple pizza then complaining about the pineapple flavor lol. Pretty funny! I made them a second time and didnt have sausage so I used Virginia baked ham with the same everything else...that was pretty yummy too. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy different and so good! The pineapple/sausage mixture is just the right combination of sweet and salty. I did think the tomato paste dominated a bit too much so just spread a little of that on your pizzas.

These are fantastic so easy to make and yet so tasty. Great for pineapple lovers. Only change I would make is to use pizza sauce instead of tomato paste.

I have done this for years with all ages of children from 2 - 22! It works best if you toast the english muffin first.

I found this recipe from a Safeway Select magazine a few years ago. I made NO changes! Made it for my husband and he loved it so much he always requests it AND even had me make it for his parents while on vacation:)
