Living in Charleston, I have had this type of sauce dozens of times, but this recipe is just what I was looking for.  It's a little spicier than most, but I prefer a sweet-hot sauce.  Also, omitted the liquid smoke and it was still great! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Wow!  As I prepared the sauce I seriously had doubts about this recipe.  However after basting it over grilled chicken during the final stages of cooking, I became a believer.  I could drink this sauce!  I did do some slight modifications.  I reduced the mustard to 3/4 cup, and used the pepper in moderation.  (We have little kids)--hence, not so spicy.  Still, it was fabulous!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Great stuff!  Next time I will use less mustard and cut down on the white and black peppers.  I did add a bit more brown sugar but overall fabulous for pulled pork.

i cut the mustard down to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup honey to take off the edge of what i knew would be a tangy sauce. cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the crock pot with the sauce, and my husband loved it! we recently moved to north carolina, and this sauce stands up to what we've had in the highest-recommended diners here!

Thank you Thank you thank you!  I am a Carolinian and with my own slight adjustments, I found this to be the closest to what I grew up with.....my family butchered their own meats and held their own pig pickins- Just like my grandaddy's..who was a butcher by trade!  Thanks again for sharing.

I made this sauce this weekend and it turned out really great.  The next day I cooked a pork roast in the slow cooker until it fell apart then added this wonderful sauce to it.  My husband thought it was just like what he had had in the Carolinas.  Thanks for a great BBQ sauce!!!

This was excellent.  I browned 5 lbs. of boneless chops, slathered them with this sauce and cooked them on low in the crock pot with about 3/4 cup of sauce.  When they were falling apart I added the balance of the sauce (only made 2 cups of sauce) and shredded the meat.  We had sandwiches the next day and my Carolina-raised husband said it was the best barbeque sandwich he'd ever eaten.  I steamed the buns and topped the BBQ with a little extra hot sauce and regular slaw (as opposed to BBQ slaw)  Yummy - better than 5 stars!

My family loved this...even my picky teenager.  We liked the extra kick in the sauce.  They're already planning when I will use this again.  I used brown sugar twin instead of the regular brown sugar and it worked out great.

My husband and I LOVE this sauce. We fell in love with a mustard based sauce in a South Carolina restaurant and this comes very close.

Holy Toledo!  This is an awesome sauce.   We got rave reviews and incredulous looks that we'd made this ourselves. The sauce needs to mellow, so make sure to give it at least 24 hours for the flavors to blend.

For pulled pork:  use pork shoulder/butt, cook with indirect heat/smoke on a grill 9-12 hours keeping grill temperature around 250-300 degrees (low and slow!!).  For best flavor, use wood chips.  Internal meat temperature should be 180-190 degrees when done.  Let the meat cool a bit, then pull apart with two forks or with your hands.  Put some sauce on the meat and let it 'marinate' - good right away, but even better overnight.  When ready to serve, heat the meat back up in a crock pot, further melding the flavors and set the rest of the sauce on the side as a condiment.

This is great party fare, because all the work is done the day before.  Day of, you just heat it up.

AWESOME!!!  I made this last night for a big BBQ potluck we were having here today.  I like mustard based sauces myself, so I wanted to give this a whirl.  Great flavor, great kick.  I might add just a hair more sweetness to it next time (like add honey).  But, otherwise, it was awesome!!

One other tweak I didâ€¦  I didn't have the Louisiana Hot Sauce.  I did have the Red Rooster sriracha sauce, and I used that instead.  Figured it wouldn't make a whole lot of difference.

I love this sauce! My hubby is from Charleston, SC and he introduced me to mustard based BBQ sauce when we visited SC a few years ago. I was so excited to find this recipe and knew he would love it! Everyone else at the Labor Day party loved it as well. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any liquid smoke. I'm sure it would have been even better if I did! It definitely smelled very vinegary while cooking, but just as described after it cooled down it was awesome! It's spicier than most mustard based sauces we've tried, but I like that about it. I served this with pork ribs and a smoked beef brisket and it was fabulous with both! I'm excited to smoke some chicken soon and serve this with the chicken also.

This recipe is AMAZING. I didn't have any liquid smoke, and I took some other reviewers' advice and only added 3/4 cup yellow mustard.. Perfect!! I will absolutely be making this again.

This recipe was a little to Mustardy for myself but my husband LOVED it. If it were up to him he would've given it 5 stars. I love the vinegar in it, so next time i will cut down the mustard by half and actually add more vinegar. After the sauce was completed I went ahead and added my own personal touches but stayed true to the Carolina way and did not add any red sauce to it.

I made this sauce yesterday, it took a little bit longer than I wanted but it didn't effect my rating. This was a simple mustard base sauce, my husband loves it on EVERYTHING. My only modification was using white vinegar instead of the cider.

I made 4 canning jars for future use.
Thanks for the recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for! Mustard is our favorite condiment and vinegar and hot sauce rank pretty high as well. I didn't have any liquid smoke but I do now and will definitely use it next time. Otherwise made exactly as written. We charcoal grilled pork, shredded it and made sliders.

Absolutely the best sauce I have ever had. I smoked a picnic roast and added this sauce for a party I had. Only thing left was a bone and very full party guest. Goes great with a light vineger based coleslaw. Make sure you toast the buns. Thanks for the new addition to my recipe collection. I will never use store bought sauce again.

I had never tasted a carolina mustard,vinegar based sauce. I made a double batch,but with only 1 1/4 cup mustard (that is all I had) We love it. I had slow cooked a 7 lb pork shoulder. Next time I want to smoke the pork instead of slow cook. But it was really good anyway. I might try it with a little more mustard too,even though it was great as I made it.

Carolina meets the Midwest. Cut back the mustard to almost 3/4 of a cup, added two fresh cloves of garlic diced and one onion diced.  Added about 1/2 cup of EVOO along with rest of ingredients, mixed all together used it as a marinade and let ribs marinate overnight.  Grilled the next day.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.  Thanks for the post.

We've had lot's of barbeque all across the country.  Carolina barbeque is our favorite and this recipe is the best, and closest to anything we have had at barbeque places in the South.

This is a fantastic sauce! I used it to season my pulled pork bbq. The only modification I made was to lessen the mustard by half (I used spicy brown mustard since that was all I had on hand), as some other reviewers suggested, and added a touch more vinegar and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was a hit at our poker game and will from now on be my staple sauce for pulled pork. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely amazing!  I added some honey (about 1/4 cup) to tone it down a little.  I also did not have any Cheyenne pepper so I added more chili powder and some Tabasco (I prefer the green chili!)

Made this sauce up to go with my pulled pork for a large group of KC Masterpiece "sweet sauce" fans. This recipe is GREAT!! I was amazed that they used it all & had lots of the sweet stuff leftover. Very easy to make, try it, you'll like it!!

Thanks for a very good sauce recipe.  I love pulled pork on a bun with coleslaw.  Now, I have never been to the Carolina's to try for myself, but I did enjoy this sauce.  I was short on time and made it in my pressure cooker (it did not scorch on low pressure for 10min + 10min).  After making the sauce, I added my pork sirloin roast, cut in large chunks and cooked on medium pressure for 60 min.  The meat fell apart when I shredded it.  I added some sauce to moisten and passed more at dinner.  My only change was for my daughter who is not terribly fond of vinegary sauces.  I added a bit of ketchup (1/4c.)to cut the tang a bit.  Next time I will try without and add the full amount + a bit of the chili powder and tabasco.  Gonna go eat some leftovers now! Thanks

I'm from Virginia, have been in Charleston SC. now for 13yrs.
 I fixed a Boston butt over night in the crock pot and took
to work for the guys. The sauce was a big hit everyone went
back for more. Didn't have hot sauce so I used a piece of
 jalapeno pepper,  squeezed it in a garlic press to extract the oil. it was wonderful!  
Tip:   squeeze droplets a little at a time to get the heat right.

I made this tonight, and followed the recipe to the letter.  It made a wonderful sauce, and I filled two pint jars with the finished product.  I always enjoy reading people's reviews, and noticed that the "bad" reviews found it to be a matter of this not being their kind of barbeque.  I get that; however, for those that love Carolina-style (my father was born and raised in Charleston), it's really a great recipe.

I often make pulled pork for my family, using a sweet/tangy red sauce. But I found this recipe for the mustard based sauce....i WAS NOT dissapointed! It was great. And I took the advice of some others and cut down the mustard amount, and the pepper amount. Was VERY delicious! Thanks!

This is my family's favorite Carolina bbq sauce recipe. I made 6 different bbq sauces last week and we didn't really care for any of them, so I decided to try one more recipe and this is exactly what we were looking for. Thanks for a great recipe. We served this over smoked pork.

So delicious! My boyfriend raved over this sauce. I made dry country style ribs and used the sauce for dipping. The next day I made my man a turkey sandwich and he asked me to put this sauce on it cause he liked it so much! I didn't change anything except for omitting the white pepper because I was out. I just used more ground black pepper. Would be amazing on pulled pork sandwiches!

This is so good that I want to put it on everything. We made this to top a Carolina style slaw hot dog, and it was perfectly spiced, tangy, and delicious, and a big hit with the workmates. Yesterday I put it on the cole slaw and the beans that were leftover from the hot dogs, and it was just as good.

I think this is the most exciting recipe I've found on this site so far, and I have enjoyed so many of them!  This is so incredibly tasty.  I didn't have enough mustard for the recipe, so I used 3/4 cup, 1/4 cup of ketchup (all I had of that, too) and 1/2 cup of pork broth.  I kept everything else the same.  I couldn't stop tasting and smelling it!  I think I'll try the original recipe next time I get more mustard, but the version I already made was a keeper too.  Thank you!!!

This is an outstanding recipe. I dialed back the mustard to 1/2 cup and used 1 cup ketchup in its place for a more Tennessee-style sauce. I used it as a finishing sauce and table sauce for pulled pork and it proved to be the best pork sauce we've ever had.

This reminds me of the sauce at the popular BBQ stands when I lived in Charleston, SC.  It's a little bit spicier than I remember, but that's ok., because I like it that way!  I add a bit more brown sugar than the recipe calls for.

I cooked a butt roast with apple cider vinegar all day in the crockpot, and used this sauce on top. It was SO good. Yes, I did a couple of alterations. Used spicy brown mustard and didn't use liquid smoke. I also didn't let it marinate overnight. No matter, it was perfect. Just the right amount of spice. Will definitely make this again!

I was thinking about how to use up a pork should roast and thought "pulled pork sandwiches" sounded good, but it is not possible to find "real" Carolina BBQ sauce in California...  Certain that AllRecipes would have something, I came across this recipe!  Make me think of the very first pulled pork sandwich I ever had more than 50 years ago in Charlotte, NC.  Since I share the house with a bunch of Yankees, I did leave out the cayenne.

This is the real deal!  Thanks, Tripper, great recipe!!!  Unfortunately, there is absolutely no way this would ever last a couple of weeks in the 'frig...

Great recipe! I agree with others who said to reduce the mustard a bit (I reduced about a third). I made a double batch and cooked it with a pork shoulder in the pressure cooker. It turned out great.

I made as written with only one change. Due to an allergy to beer I substituted it with Ginger Ale. This is excellent. I BBQ all the time. A nice change from the red sauces. I have tried it on chili dogs, pulled pork, smoked ribs, ham. Only had it about 2 weeks so far. I know don't rate it if you change it but I had to. I also had to compliment the recipe. Thanks, I will use for this recipe for many years to come.

I followed this recipe to a 'T' with the exception of halving the mustard. Also be sure to use yellow mustard, not spicy brown like I did. I think it would taste better. Other than that this is a delicious sauce served over pulled pork or just about anything. Thank you for sharing!

I LOVE this recipe. Every time I make it, I get a ton of compliments. The flavor really does mellow after a day or so. I recommend doubling the recipe so you can keep some in your fridge for... whenever.

Awesome.  After living in Eastern NC for several years, this wasn't what I expected, which is a vinegar/pepper/brown sugar based sauce with the consistency of water.  However, I was pleasantly surprised!  I placed a pork tenderloin in my slow cooker before I left for work, and when I came home, dinner was ready.

We moved from Charleston, SC and I have had a BIG craving for some bbq and this recipe delivers.  I made it for a family reunion and had a lot of pork to cover so I doubled the recipe.  Just in case anyone wants to know, a 32oz bottle of yellow mustard is just a tad more then 3 cups required to double the recipe -I did the how 32oz and it was just perfect.

This was pretty good.  I used it on boneless pork ribs I cooked in the crockpot.  I didn't have white pepper & I didn't put any hot sauce in it because of my kids, but we didn't miss either ingredient.  It made a generous amount & I still have some left over even after making the ribs.  Will definitely make again & may try on chicken.

I found this same recipe on a different website and I loved it!  I'm from Charleston, SC originally and this is very similar to the sauce they use at a popular BBQ restaurant there.  This sauce goes so well with pulled pork, too.

For the 4th of July, we BBQ'd a whole pig and I made this sauce to go with it.
Everyone LOVED this!!  I cut back the mustard to 3/4 c. and then added 3/4 c. of honey.  Thank you for this keeper recipe!

We marinated boneless chicken breast for about an hour before grilling. The chicken had great flavor and was very juicy. I will use it again.

This sauce was very good, if you like mustard.  My husband loved it, but he loves mustard.  I added 1/2 cup ketchup to it to help tone it down a bit for my taste.  It helped.

I am used to tomato based BBQ sauces so this was a nice change. I still prefer tomato based BBQ sauce but am glad I tried this. We had it with the brisket my hubby smoked tonight. This will be a keeper for when I am in the mood for something different.

Had a good flavor although I didn't add any hot sauce it was plenty hot!  Also if you blend regular BBQ (famous dave's zesty sauce) it gives it a better flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I'm from Indiana so Carolina mustard is somewhat of a rarity here, but I love it.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I added 2 tablespoons of organic honey.  It turned out better than I thought it would.

TRIPPER!! I have made well over 100 receipes from ALL RECEIPES and never given a review....... I tried this on grilled chicken thighs tonight, when the thighs were almost done I basted a couple of times with the sauce. My eyes kind of stung, wasn't sure if it was because of the smoke in the garage (live in Minnesota, bbqed with an exhaust fan) or if it was the sauce. After a few bites the hair on the back of my neck was tingling and my forehead was hot.....FREAKING LOVED IT!!!!! Can't wait to try on pork...Have you ever used it on beef? Thanks again

This is a great sauce. I am from NC and this never fails to give me a taste of home. I have use it repeatedly over the past 6 years. I recommend this sauce to anyone wanting a great sauce for pulled pork.

oh yes I will make it again, and again.  Just what I was looking for a mustard base barbque sauce.  It's delicious, made it 2 days in a row, should have made a double recipe the 1st day, but I've made way to many recipes here that I didn't like and a waste of time and money.  Not this one, excellent.  Can't wait to serve it to my card group.

I have made this now 6 times, It is great for dipping  everything. It even works good as salad dressing. I am making it again tonight for the corned beef in the slow cooker.  It is my guilty pleasure on my low carb diet. I just use an ultra light beer. I may one time try it with a sugar alternative, but I have not yet. I love this way more than regular bbq sauce.

This is the real stuff. Living in SC, I always choose the mustard sauce for our BBQ. I had to cut back a little on the mustard because it is really strong and spicy. I will make this again, using the same ingredients.

I didn't have white pepper so I used extra black pepper. As per other reviewers I reduced the mustard and added extra vinegar and sugar. It was very hot and spicy and I liked it a lot but some diners thought it was a little too hot for them. I had some left over which I am still enjoying and as another reviewer said- I could eat it with a spoon!

This recipe is replacing my old vinegar based Carolina sauce that I have made for 40 years!  A little less mustard, as that's all I had.  A little less liquid smoke, as he is smoking a pork butt all day today.  Good kick of hot sauce and I am ready for my pulled pork sandwich!  I will make this one over and over.  Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical about how much sugar was in this because we don't like it sweet and it doesn't seem like a lot of vinegar if you love it like I do but this sauce was perfect.  I cooked ribs on the smoker and brushed this sauce on before finishing on the grill plus had extra for dipping. I got so many compliments on the sauce, I'll have to make another batch just to keep around.  I omitted the liquid smoke and added some diced hot cherry peppers from a jar. So good!

Nice and spicy, in a good way. We used 1/2 the amount of mustard, mainly because of other reviews. But I can see why someone who likes yellow mustard would use the full amount.
I will make it again.

Made this to serve over pulled pork and it was delicious!  I thought it had just the right spice, but others who can't tolerate spice, thought it was too spicy.  I would definitely make it again - really enjoyed it as did everyone else who likes a little spice!

Fantastic recipe! I made it once the way it was written and decided to get creative with the second batch. I left out the hot sauce and cayenne and replaced it with a habenero pepper and some cumin. It gave it a bit more heat and it turned out amazing. Thanks!

I have made this sauce several times and it is always amazing!  This time I did not have any beer and didn't want to run to the store just for that so I substituted it with chicken broth and it was just as good.  Yum!!!

Great sauce. Made minor adjustments for my own taste by adding 1/8 c. more of ACV, 1/2 t. more of cayenne, 1/2 c. more of honey, 2 T. onion powder & 1 T. finely chopped garlic. Used thick Worcestershire sauce instead. YUMMY!

Yum! I'll admit...born and raised in Washington and never had a mustard based BBQ sauce until I went to a chain BBQ place that just opened up that had a version of this in their BBQ sauce choices. I was hooked then and decided to find a recipe for one that I can make my own of what one dish cost there. This sauce was a hit for the whole family and I keep a bottle in the refridgerator now for reserve. Thanks, Tripper, for sharing this recipe!

I have made this sauce several times for family and friends and I have yet to hear a complaint. I initially was hesitant to make it because I am not a big vinegar fan, but the flavors blend very well and there is not an overpowering vinegar taste like I had feared.  I make one and a half or a double batch of this sauce and let it blend overnight in the fridge as suggested. I take a 7lb pork boston butt and throw it in the crock pot over night with enough beef broth to cover. In the morning, it is falling off the bone. I drain it and add half the sauce and keep the crock pot on low or warm for the remainder of the day, stirring in additional sauce throughout the day to keep the meat moist. Served with cole slaw on or off a bun, this recipe is a definite keeper!

I tried this sauce on some BBQ chicken. No one in my family cared for it, my boyfriend wouldn't even finish his. Guess it's just not our taste. Way too tangy, the amount of mustard used is crazy!

This was great. Just what I was looking for. My husband loves this kind of sauce, and raved about it. I did not make any changes. It sat and cooled for about 8 hours before I served it and it was good, the next day however....even better.

I have to say that I love the KC style bbq but wanted a change.  I tried this recipe and everyone said that it was too vinegary.    Maybe this is just not my taste.

YUMMY!!! I made this exactly as it stated in the recipe. I served it with "Amazing Ribs" from this site. It's a very nice change from the norm for a midwesterner. This would be great with chicken as well. Kudos to Andy!

My husband and I prefer red sauce -- that said, we tried this and it was FANTASTIC!  It's easily the best mustard sauce I've ever tried.  Might even make a convert out of me....

I used the BBQ Pork for Sandwiches recipe to cook my pork loin roast, then I drained the broth and added this sauce.  Yumm-my!  The vinegar fumes made our eyes water and our noses run, but that didn't stop us from inhaling our sandwiches!

My family didn't like this at  all. Is this one of those recipes that one has to acquire a taste for it?
