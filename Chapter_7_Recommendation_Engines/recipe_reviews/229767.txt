My youngest son and I made this pie together. Because I'm low on time and energy, I used a refrigerated pie crust. We mixed the pie filling in my Kitchen Aid mixer, it was less than five minutes to make it. We followed the recipe exact. This pie was done baking at five minutes before the fourty minutes was up. Gorgeous pie, VERY VERY good. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: For those of you who want a pie that tastes like pumpkin that's lightly sweetened, this one is for you.

This recipe is excellent as is.  Here are some helpful tips: 1) cover the edges of the pie crust with foil and pre-bake it in the oven until it's half way cooked so that the crust does not get soggy and cooks through all the way. 2) heat the pumpkin on the stove with the spices. This gets rid of the canned taste, lets some of the excess water evaporate and gives the spices a richer taste. 3) let the cooked pumpkin rest for a few minutes and then incorporate the condensed milk into the warm pumpkin.  Allow that to cool and then add in the beaten eggs. This will give the pie a creamy consistency.  4) add the filling into the pie crust and leave the foil in place over the edges of the pie.  Bake at 350.  About halfway through baking, remove the foil to brown the edges. Bake for 30-35 mins total and then turn off the oven to let the pie cool in the oven. This will prevent the filling from cracking.

This has been my "go-to" recipe for years, it's never failed me.  To keep the pies from cracking while baking, I always put a pan of water on the bottom rack

Tried this pie at a pre-Thanksgiving "pie testing" at work. It's really good! I think the McCormick Pie Spice must be the perfect blend of spices (which makes it easy for a person like me who always seems to be missing at least one of the spices when it comes pie making time).

We tried it with Graham Cracker crust.  The condensed milk makes it very hearty and the spice gave it a nice kick!

Mmmm...this is very good pumpkin pie.  I used a pre-made graham cracker crust, and it really took 5 minutes to make. Easy as pie.  :)  Next time I'll use a homemade crust.  My favorite is Chef John's Easy Homemade Pie Crust.

You just can't get any easier than 5 simple ingredients. This pie is too good and too easy for it to just be made at Thanksgiving. It's an any night dessert!

Made exactly as written, no need to thaw the frozen pie shell. So easy and SO good it is better than the family recipe I have used for years the whole family agrees! It didn't crack, looked perfect and I always refrigerate for several hours as we like it cold, and top with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

I agree with some of the other reviews, this is a bit bland and needs something else.  The worst part though was that my frozen crust didn't cook at all.  I would precook my crust a bit next time before filling.

Add twice (x2) the amount of pumpkin spice it calls for.  Otherwise a simple and yummy pumpkin pie recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times now and I made a  couple changes and this is definitely a winner.  I add an additional 3/4 tsp of McCormick's cinnamon, an extra 1/4 tsp. of McCormick's pumpin pie spice, instead of two eggs,  I add one egg and 3 egg yolks. I also add 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a 1/2 tsp. of fine salt.  I put it all in a sauce pan except the sweetened condensed milk and eggs and heat it through while whisking  (this makes a huge difference!) it. Let it cool  then take your mixer and mix in  your sweetened condensed milk and then your eggs. I used a premade Pillsbury Deep Dish Pie Shell that I don't prebake.  Bake at 425 for 15 minutes then turn my oven down to 350 for an additional 35 minutes and cover the crust with foil 10 minutes after turning the oven down to 350. This pumpkin pie  is creamy with a fantastic flavor! I will never by a store bought pie again.

Very simple & tasty recipe. Easy & quickest recipe I’ve seen. Taste is not too different from more complicated recipes, although presentation is not as good.
 This recipe seems rushed & hot. Whereas others were slower & more thoroughly heated, with an even color & no rips in the pie. If it weren’t for the homemade whipped cream I served along with it, it would just be average. I need a recipe that makes me happy I didn’t buy it from the store instead.

This recipe was amazing. The whipped cream was great but it didn’t taste like it was vanilla so I recommend admit a little more vanilla

This pie had a weird consistency. When I compared it to others, it uses sweetened condensed milk where others use evaporated milk and sugar. This recipe is not my favorite. The taste was good but didn't like the consistency.

Since the family doesn't like cloves, we omitted them.  Pie was your typical pumpkin pie. Taste was good. We would make it again.

I do not like using condensed milk,  so instead I recommend replacing condenser milk with regular milk and adding a bit of brown sugar (or  cinnamon sugar for more of a zing)  another great option is to put in better and if you’re feeling real crafty, try using lemon and orange shavings. Yum!

Fantastic low-cal way to get the taste of pumpkin pie if you skip the crust, like I did. I sprayed a 9-inch pie plate with a butter spray and cooked the pie at 350 for 45 min., until set.

There is no sugar in this recipe, absolutely needs sugar, preferably brown sugar and double if not triple the pumpkin pie spice, especially is using organic pumpkin as I did.

This is an amazing recipe...but  i added 8 ounces instead of 15 ounces and i like it better that way. This is my second ime making this and i cant get old of it. We did not have any whip cream so i ate it how it was still perfect!The reson i rated it a 4 is because it is not spaktacular.But so delisioius.

If quick and easy is what you're looking for, this recipe is it.  It tastes just fine.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing wrong with it either.  5 stars for ease and 3 for flavor and texture.
