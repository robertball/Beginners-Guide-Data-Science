Yummy stuff!  Make it just how the recipes states or jazz it up with more of the ingredients and it still is great.  The only thing that I do consistently when I make this is I that use apple cider instead of apple juice.  I have people ask me to bring this drink for fall and winter parties all the time.  It is really that good.

Fabulous!  And no added sugar which is a waist line bonus.  I added 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon and extra cloves for some extra spiciness.  Try it you won't be disappointed--but be sure to use FRESH orange juice, a lot of supermarkets sell it now, it just isn't the same with frozen or carton juice.

Had last weekend at a fall baby shower that I hosted. I kept it in a crockpot on low and it made the house smell so good. The key is starting with a good brand of cider - I used a locally made cider out of Seattle. Great drink to warm you up.

Yum! I doubled the spices in this and let it sit all day.  The longer it sat, the better it got! The whole spices made for a very pretty drink.  My kids loved it as well.  I served this to company with a shot of applejack brandy for those who wanted it.  Huge hit.

I used one lemon and one orange and I sliced them into thick slices and stuck the cloves (about 20) into the edges of the slices 'cause I thought it was prettier.  I also used 3 cinnamon sticks intead of just 1.  It had a lot of flavor, let me tell you!

Made this in the crockpot for a holiday party last winter and it was an absolute hit!  Had some bourbon on the side for those who wished to spike it and that was tasty as well.

I really liked this recipe, however I tried the suggestion of adding the tablespoon of cinnamon.  I wouldn't do that again as it made the cider rather chalky .. I think I would just add a few more cinnamon sticks to add more cinnamon flavor.

What a wonderful drink to warm up cold winter days!  I doubled the recipe for a party, and it was a big hit.  After bringing it to a boil on the stovetop, I transferred the cider into a big crockpot and kept it hot on the low setting.  I did make a few changes to the recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand:  I used a couple pinches of ground cloves because I did not have whole cloves.  I only used a quarter amount of the fresh orange juice because that's the amount I got after squeezing a few oranges.  I doubled the amount of raisins and cinnamon sticks for extra flavor.  Serve this delicious hot drink with a spoon so your guests can eat the plump raisins as well.

Served this at a women's event at our church ...doubled the recipe and could have made more.  Everyone loved it!   There were no children present, so I did not give it a "kid friendly rating"

I made mine with a few modifications: Used whole orange slices with whole cloves (approx. 30) stabbed into the orange skin, and sprinkled a 1/4 tsp. ground cloves and 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon into the pot in addition to the cinnamon sticks (I used 2). I allowed it to simmer for a few hours--everyone raved about it at our New Years party!

This was really good!  It made the kitchen smell wonderful too!     Not having cinnamon sticks on hand, I combined ground cinnamon from the jar with the cloves and put the mixture into a coffee filter and tied it shut (like a little boquet garni), then put it in the pot.  The flavors diffused nicely with no problems!  Only concern...has anyone else noticed that the recipe has a mistake(?) in the amount of cloves?  Personally, I used about 20, per another reviewer's advice.  Thanks for the recipe.  Yum!

Very nice cider!  Everyone raved about it at my girlfriend get-together and there was none leftover.  I did add an extra clove and cinnamon stick, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! I made it from concentrated frozen apple juice and orange juice and it tasted fine. I didn't have enough apple juice for the recipe so I had to do some tweeking, I also used the suggestion from other review to increase the spices. I also added a little nutmeg. I recommend making it for a group of people instead of just one or two- it makes alot.

I served this recently at a Christmas party, and it was delicious. I think it tasted even better the next day once the cinnamon stick and cloves blended in even further.

I followed the recipe to the letter and I enjoyed the taste. Next time I will add more cinnamon, though, because the apple flavor was pretty dominant.

This was soo yummy!! I followed the recipe exactly. I made it for a Christmas party we had last night and it was a huge hit!! i had to make a 2nd batch. Some guests added a shot of brandy to it and it enhanced the flavor even more.

Not bad at all, but not exactly what I am looking for.  I used a home pressed cider that was very sweet, and I would recommend a tarter cider to start with.

This recipe gave me inspiration for a super spiced cider. I used apple cider instead of juice and then did half orange juice/ half grapefruit juice, threw in a 1/2 cup of a pre-packaged  mulling spice blend from the grocery store and added a dash of ground: cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and ginger, and did 3 sticks cinnamon. This came out super delicious and had intense flavor, everyone loved it, and some people added a splash of brandy to their cup. Was a big hit! I feel like most mulled ciders are just too plain, so if you’re one of those people who just loves all things fall-spice, try it this way!

I made this recently for an evening with friends. I was afraid they might not want to try it, but it got rave reviews. Everyone kept going back for more. I will definitely make it again. I like the fact that it has no added sugar.

This was really delicious! I decided to follow some other people's advice and use the whole orange slices with cloves punched in (around 30), as well as an extra cinnamon stick.  Also, since I didn't have a non-reactive pot on hand, I put it in my slow cooker from the start.  I put everything in and heated it on high for an hour, then on low for the rest of the evening, and it was absolutely delicious.  After that I poured the whole mixture (oranges, raisins and all) into a pitcher to store in the fridge and it got better and better the longer it all sat together.  I just made this a few days ago, and already I'm making another batch!
