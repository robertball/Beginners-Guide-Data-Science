This was so good, will definitely make again. Didn't have queso fresco so did without. I did substitute ground beef for the turkey, also added crushed tortilla chips to soak up some of the liquid, also tossed the strands of squash with Mexican seasoning before adding the meat and sauce. Served with cheese quesadillas. Husband loved it.

Just made this fabulous casserole! We really enjoyed & will make it again for sure!  The only change I made was ground chuck rather than turkey. I wasn't able to locate Queso Fresca at either of the two grocery stores where I shop, so I just omitted it. Next time I will go somewhere that I know I can buy it. But it was wonderful!

Thought this was very good & will definitely make again. Think it is much healthier using spaghetti squash instead of corn tortillas. I try to follow a recipe exactly as written the first time I make it but always use veggie crumbles when it calls for ground turkey or beef.

Tasty dish.. nice use of spaghetti squash. My only issue was seasoning  There was this top layer with all sorts of flavor on top of pretty bland spaghetti squash.  Next time I will toss the cooked spaghetti squash with some seasonings when I put it in the 13X9 pan - at least salt and pepper.. maybe cumin. garlic or chili as well.

I love these spaghetti squash bskes! On this one I usually combine the ingredients so spicing goes through the squash. I also add in a can of rinsed black beans. Top with cheese and bake. Garnish with green onion.

Fantastic recipe and healthy.  Added pre-baked, chopped sweet Italian sausage and canned mushrooms to the ground beef mix. Also combined one can of cream of mushroom, one can of red enchilada sauce, one can full of whole milk (option: added hot sauce to taste) to make my sauce before combining as per recipe directions.  Definitely worth trying as a healthy alternative to carb loaded pasta and tastes great to boot...

This has become one of our favorite meals and I've prepared it 10+ times.  I agree with other reviewers that it's very bland.  I've started using only one squash and adding 2 tbs unsalted taco seasoning to the meat.  I also add half a sautéed onion simmered for a few minutes with Rotel (drained), two tbs taco seasoning, and 1/2 cup geek yogurt to the squash (stirred together).  I use lots of sharp cheddar and serve with sour cream.

We doubled the ground turkey. We also did as some of the other commentors mentioned, put taco seasoning in the squash. Overall we thought it was fine, some people thought the squash didn't really integrate with the rest of the dish.

I used ground beef instead of turkey. This is pretty delicious. Simple but still has flavor.

Delicious! I did tweak it a little. I added plain Greek yogurt and cumin to the spaghetti squash and taco seasoning to the ground turkey. My whole family loved it!

Really yummy low carb dinner! I hate it when  people change the recipe and then rate it, but that is exactly what I am going to do, lol. First of all I cooked the squash in the microwave (cut into half lengthwise, put some water in a 13x9 pan and put the cut side down.  This saved time). Then I substituted ground beef for the turkey and ricotta cheese for the queso fresco because it is what I had. I also doubled the enchilada sauce which I liked a lot. I do t think it would’ve had as much flavor without it. However, my squash may have been larger than most. Very good healthy alternative to noodles!

Tasted great, the only changes I made were that I only used 1 spaghetti squash, 10 ounce can of enchilada sauce (because that's what I had on hand), added green chilies and onions. The next time I might strain the spaghetti because it was a little runny.

I made a lot of changes that are reflected in this review. I don't think we would have liked it much had I not made the changes. Like most of the other reviewers, I used ground beef instead of turkey. Instead of using sauce in the meat, I threw in a little bit of stewed tomato, a small can of diced chilis, onion, garlic, salt and some taco seasoning into the meat. My squashes yielded a lot of meat, so I put one squash on the bottom, generously salted it, put the meat on top of it, then put the other squash on top of the meat. Also generously salted the top layer. I dumped all the enchilada sauce on top (and I am pretty sure I used more than 16 oz). For cheese on top, I used cheddar and pepper-jack instead of Mexican cheese blend/queso fresco. Next time, I'd just use one squash. It was way too much squash-to-meat ratio.
