I just made this as strawberry vinaigrette and it is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting homemade strawberry vinegar for the raspberry vinegar.  I am definitely looking forward to making this again with raspberry vinegar when raspberries are in season later this summer, YUM! ETA:  it was just as great made with homemade raspberry vinegar, thank you  for the excellent and versatile recipe!  It is also great with honey if you want a sugar-free recipe.  I did not use the full 1/3 cup and it still turned out nicely sweetened.

I didnt have rasberry vinegar and i've never made my own salad dressing but i wanted to try something new so i pureed 1 cup of thawed frozen rasberries and used 3/4 cup regular white vineger. It is sooo good. Even my 5 year old will eat it when tossed on aples as a school lunch snack. Thank you so much

This is a very easy recipe that tastes great. I did not use quite as much sugar as the recipe called for just because I am cutting back on sugar consumption but it was delicious!!!
Thanks for sharing with us!

This was tangy and sharp. I used this on a blueberry spinach walnut feta salad and it was the perfect dressing with it. Not sweet. Maybe next time I'll cut the oil in half.

My family loves this dressing! So easy to make. I serve it on a spinach salad with feta cheese and fresh strawberries and my hubby eats more salad than the meat! Thank you!

I halved the recipe for one bag of spring mix and it was more than enough.  It would have been plenty for 2 bags of mix.  The one bag divided out perfectly for 6 people.  Served this as a bed for Moroccon Salmon cakes, where I wanted a simple, basic salad that wouldn't compete with the salmon cake.  I probably used a full teaspoon of dijon for 1/2 the recipe.  This dressing was simple and not overwhelming, just what I wanted.

This is exactly what I was looking for - simple, tasty, and it only took a few minutes to make.  I served it on a spring mix salad with sliced strawberries, mandarins, pecans and feta cheese - yummy!

Just lovely; the method of heating the sugar with the vinegar gives the finished dressing a lovely, store-bought, thicker consistency.  A wonderful dressing to accompany a salad of spinach, strawberries, toasted almonds and parmesan, for example.  I used raspberry champagne vinegar.  Thanks so much!
