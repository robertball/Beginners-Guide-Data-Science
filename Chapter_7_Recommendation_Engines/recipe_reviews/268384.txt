With a few changes making it a KETO friendly dish, it turned out amazing. My wife told me to write down the changes and put them here. When I get a chance I will.

I made this four years ago and it's a favorite in my family for Thanksgiving and Christmas, even pleasing the picky people in my family. I make it every year now

The walnut crumble on top is such a great additional crunch and flavor! I made a gluten free crust with gluten free shortbread cookies and omitted the flour in the topping. Turned out great!

Delicious pie recipe! The walnut topping could be made on it's own and eaten as a snack or put on top of oatmeal, cereal or even yogurt.

Turned out pretty good.  Added 1/8 tsp of grounded cloves as well.
