This recipe was a hit.  I have been trying to find one where the potatoes actually crispen - this is it.  I baked them an additional 20 minutes and the family loved them!  I followed the recipe to the letter (except the lenght of cooking time) and the taste was fabulous! The family loved them!  Thank you.

I love this recipe! BUT I made a few changes.  I added minced garlic to the potatoes rather than roasting it.  I also added chopped onions before cooking as I had no green onions.  I used about twice as much vinegar as called for because my husband loves vinegar.  I also returned the potatoes to the oven for about another five minutes after adding the vinegar mustard sauce.  My husband is not a big potato fan but he loved these!  Next time I think I will add some diced uncooked bacon to the potatoes as well before cooking.

This is an excellent recipe, however, I did not use the sugar the second time I made it. My family liked it much better that way.

i only followed the basic recipe for the wedges, thus saying i added my own spices and only followed the cooking and oil measurements. i seasoned with garlic powder, season all, ground pepper and popped the wedges in according to the temp and baking suggestions. they were really good, but be sure to always stir them every 10 mins or they will stick. i also cooked them a little longer, as we like them to be browned. thanks for the recipe

I omitted the rosemary as it's always too sharp and twiggy for my liking, and I don't really like the flavor; also used white balsamic vinegar. I tossed the tater wedges in the mix, and baked them for about 5 mins at 450 before sprinkling on the green onions. Good stuff. Thank you, Amy!

I loved these. My family wasn't as fond of them as myself but they did like them. I think more than anything the vinegar in them may need to be reduced for my fam to love them as I do. These are great as a side item.

A very distinctive flavor. A great recipe for spicing up what might otherwise be a predictable meal. Very easy recipe.

Decent flavor except I didn't care for the rosemary.  Next time I will leave that out.  I used minced garlic instead of the cloves and horseradish mustard instead of dijon just because they were on hand.  I needed to cook in oven for about an hour.  I will definitely try again!

I thought the vinegar made the potatoes mussy and gross. I wish I could have just skipped the vinegar/mustard mixture.

These were good. I added asperagus just at he end of cooking and covered them in the mustard sauce as well. I also used regular onions and added bacon. Very good! Although my kids wouldnt eat it at all.

These are so delicious.  I make the recipe exactly as written.  The vinegar/mustard combo gives them real zip.  Big hit at family gatherings.

YUM. Only one change made--I did not use the sugar. I did use organic red potatoes and I only made a half recipe of this. The kids did not care for this but both my husband and I thought it was fabulous. A great spin on jo-jo potatoes.

Very good. I used dried basil instead of fresh rosemary (which I don't like much). The mustard sauce was a nice addition, which I didn't expect.

This just wont turn out good, no matter how  much I wanted it to. Just the words "garlic" and "potatoes" usually make my mouth water, but not with this recipe.

I didn't have whole garlic or green onions, so I mixed in minced garlic and regular chopped onion at the beginning. It worked ok, but they got a bit dark. I baked them 50 minutes for the right tenderness. I was scared when mixing the sauce in, because the vinegar smelled so strong. But the flavor was really good. There was some liquid in the bottom of the bowl, so I drained the potatoes so they wouldn't become soggy. Definitely a keeper.

These were fantastic!  I too was worried about the potatoes have too much of a vinegar flavor, but they were perfect! So good we're having them again in less than a week!

This was good, but not great for me. I opted out of the final additions of vinegar et al, as the fries wouldn't crisp up even with extra oven time and cranking the heat half way through. The taste was good though. Liked the spice combo.

These are over the top awesome, the family was asking why I didn't make more, next time I'll double the recipe. The sauce was mouth watering delicious, this recipe is a hit. Thanks for sharing :)

I don't like being the first to review a recipe, but seeing this one I had to try it. My family loves garlic and this was great! I will be making this again. If you don't like a major garlic taste, you might want to cut down on the garlic a little. As for me it was perfect. Thanks.

These were too pungent for my taste but...after sitting in the fridge for two day and rinsing with warm water, the taste remained imbedded in the potatoes but with less of a vinegar tang. And the oil is rinsed away. The flavor is diiiiiiivine!

I didn't think this was good at all. I left out the sugar per some other reviews, but I had to add the sugar because the flavor of the sauce was so sharp. Even with sugar it just wasn't good. I like all of the ingredients, but they didn't mix well. The potatoes also never crisped up. If you are looking for fries, there are better recipes on this site for oven fries. I'm glad I made another side with dinner, because this was a total bummer.

Added about an extra 10 minutes to cooking time using convection oven to get potatoes a little more crisp, and substituted some of the cider vinegar for balsamic and omitted sugar.  Please take the time to use fresh rosemary (chop finely)as it really makes this recipe special. Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I don't care for rosemary so I left that out. They were great. We couldn't stop eating them. The vinegar and mustard give them a special zip.

My husband and I made these for the first time two weeks ago and are making them again!  They were seriously awesome potatoes! The flavors are almost too intense when you mix everything together.  Thanks for this great recipe - it will be made many more times in our household!  : )

This was a big hit with my husband and Chinese guests alike. I used a dried rosemary, and a little less than would normally be substituted for fresh.  I also pressed the garlic and mixed it in with the potatoes before baking, and baked longer until they were crispy. I used a dab of honey instead of sugar in the dressing, and baked another 10 min after stirring in the dressing.  Will definitely make this again!

I've made these twice so far and finally got around to reviewing how good these are.  I love the flavor and it certainly gives new life to the bland potatoe. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

Made them tonight, family loved them. Picky son went up for seconds :)... Did add more time to cooking to make more of a crispier outside, used same ingredients but did as some others and added a little bit more oil (olive oil) to a large plastic sealable bag and used that to coat potatoes. Very easy recipe, had most ingredients on hand which made it very helpful.

What a nice blend of flavors! I've been looking for something different to do with potatoes, and this was it.  My only changes were to cut the potato in fairly thin slices and to cook an extra 15 minutes to give them a crispiness. Thanks!

This has become one of my staple recipes- my boyfriend often requests them all the time, calling them "the yummy potatoes." Delicious. I would recommend slicing them thinly rather than quartering them, though- they get much crisper that way, and you get more flavor per bite.

I loved this recipe, I would just personally add more garlic, and more vinegar, but that's just personal taste.  I cooked it for easter dinner and it was a hit!
