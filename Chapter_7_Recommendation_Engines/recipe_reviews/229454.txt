I must admit, I'm not always a fan of Chef John's recipes, but I cannot sing the praises enough on this one. I have made these several times, ever since the video for them was featured well over a year ago. I never knew there was a printed recipe for them!  As this recipe's first reviewer I highly recommend them, particularly if you love artichokes as much as I do.  (When I was a little girl Santa used to put a jar of marinated artichokes in my Christmas stocking!) The directions are helpful (especially the draining part) and the ingredients spot on. Canned artichokes make these super easy and they can easily be assembled in advance to pop in the oven just before serving. Ever since I discovered these, my array of appetizers would not be complete without them.

These were very good!! I was skeptical but they were yummy. The amount of cheese bread crumb topping seemed like a lot when i added it on but it turned out perfect. I used butter instead of olive oil and had no lemon so i just put a little bit of lemon pepper on

We loved this! I didn't put as much breadcrumbs or cheese as suggested just to try and cut a bit of calories, and it was still fantastic. I did use an Italian blend of cheeses. A real keeper!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone (except my husband who doesn't like artichokes) loved it.  Will make it again for a party or something.  Anything.  ;)

OMG! We LOVE this recipe.  Quick and easy to make.  My daughters (20, 18 & 14) were skeptical but after one taste they were big fans!!  It has become one of our favorite side dishes!

Tasty and simple! I did use my own hot pepper and garlic infused olive oil which added depth of flavor. Next time I may add minced garlic and top with Asiago cheese.

I normally love Chef John's recipes, but this one was just ok. It wasn't bad, but didn't have much taste or texture either. Next time I'll try adding more salt and pepper, and maybe substituting garlic-infused oil for regular olive oil. I would also triple the amount of breadcrumbs to try and improve the texture. The recipe itself deserves 3 stars, but I'm adding an extra star because this is a super-fast and convenient recipe that uses items you would already have on hand, and I would definitely try it again.

Am I the only one who is confused about the artichoke ingredient?  The video says and shows  14.5 oz. jars from Trader Joe's, but the recipe says use 6 cans and doesn't specify the oz. in each can.  What are the correct amount of artichokes measured in ounces, please?

I used artichokes packed in oil as it was what I had on hand. Next time I would use the water packed as the recipe called for. Very easy and different than the usual appetizer.

Easy, fast, inexpensive.  A little bland,  Next time I might try a flavored olive oil or maybe sprinkle some capers or parsley overtop. Guests DID enjoy a no carb, low calorie appetizer.

Make for a cookie exchange party, doubled it and all were gone within the first twenty minutes.  The guests raved about it and since it's so easy to make and can be served at room temperature it's on the menu for every party from now on.   Couldn't find whole artichoke hearts in a jar at Trader Joe's but the canned ones worked.

This dish was good.  I used jarred artichoke hearts but I have a feeling that it may be a little too strong for some people's taste. For slightly less vinegar taste, use the canned artichokes as recommended in the recipe.

So easy to make and with ingredients I always have on hand !
I didn't serve as an appetizer. I actually added these artichoke hearts to a big bowl of salad to make it fancier  and more complex..

I wouldn't make this again. It seems like it needed something like a mayo dipping sauce . I found it very bland as written and followed the directions exactly.

Meh.  Too much effort for not enough taste. Will not make again. Sorry Chef John, this one is a miss.

Yummy & easy to make. Made a few minor changes, this recipe does not need any salt as Romano cheese is salty to start with, with this said I replaced the salt with Garlic powder and proceeded as recipe indicated.  This tastes similar to artichoke French, however, healthier as it is baked & not fried.

Really, really good!  Made 1 change....right before they were finished, I sprinkled some shredded Parmesan cheese on top and put back under broiler until melted (maybe 1 min).  Voila!  Will definitely make again!

Would it make a difference if "marinated" artichokes in a jar were used instead of canned plain artichokes?  Might  explain the lack of flavor some people are experiencing and keep the bread crumbs juicy and moist???

This was really delicious. Made as is. My husband and zi both really enjoyed them. The Crispy cheese on top of the VERY flavouful artichoke hearts was a great contrast.  
I think a nice yogurt, dill sauce on the side might be a nice option next time???

I made this recipe for my family based on the reviews.  I followed the recipe and did not alter.  I was disappointed in the results but I think I know why they did not have a "wow" factor.  I was only able to get the canned artichokes. I knew immediately when I opened the can that these were not the same quality that Chef John had in his video.  As this was pretty much the only variable, I would like to try these again with a higher quality artichoke.  I do wish the recipe could state something to the effect that  it is really important to use a high grade artichoke.  Will try again.

I just didn't care for these.  The crumbs stayed dry and just sitting between the hearts and the cheese like....well, like bread crumbs.

Just a little too salty, any suggestions to tone down the saltiness from the artichoke?

I love the fact that this recipe is simple and healthy.  For us, it does need a little more flavor punch - like garlic.  Artichokes can be fairly bland even with parmesan and lemon. This is one of those recipes you can play around with for personal preference.  I added on some goat cheese and some crushed garlic.  It's easy to pop into a toaster oven as a quick appetizer.  Thanks Chef John.

I made these as a side dish for Easter dinner, and everyone loved them.  I used sea salt for the texture, and then used garlic herb bread crumbs, for just a little extra flavor.  Will definitely make these again!

Made several versions.  Shaved parm, sprinkled parm, plain bread crumbs, panko, seasoned.  Didn't care for taste of any.  Would not make again.
