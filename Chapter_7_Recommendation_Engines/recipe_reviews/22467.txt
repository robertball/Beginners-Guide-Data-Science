I think this is an AWESOME recipe.  I have already shared it with a few of my friends.  I didn't have the celery on hand, however I used the rest of the ingredients.  This is definitely a good way to use green tomatoes, and with such a tasteful result !!!

Easy to make!  Delicious!  The vegetables can be varied; I have made this as written and with the addition of summer squash and zucchini.  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted red peppers for the tomatoes, and yellow onions for green. It was delicious! And my fiance liked it even more than I did. This is going to be a staple for us.

Kind of blah.  It had a nice tartness to it, but no flavour to speak of.  We ate it, but will find another use for green tomatoes in the future.

I loved this recipe, but I did makangie ed alterations. I mixed red and green bell peppers, and used Visalia onions instead of green onions (it's all I had, people!) either way, turned out incredible. We seasoned with salt and pepper after cooking.

I loved this recipe! I served it over spaghetti squash & got great reviews. Planned on having leftovers but there was nothing left to save!

This is good but seems to be missing something. 
I saved the leftovers and made an egg omelet which was delicious.

On the bland side but a great way to use green tomatoes. Kicked it up a notch for me by adding pink salt,  garlic, pepper and hot sauce. Much better.

This is a great way to use up green tomatoes at the end of the season. Very good dish, we really enjoy it!

Thought it was great. Easy, and a great way to use up those green tomatoes before frost. I usually fry the last of the green tomatoes, but no more, this is just good.

1.5 star.
Very bland even after I added jalapeno. The only thing that made it better was I made it into soup after it was so bland as a side dish. Added chicken stock, chicken, peas, carrots and garlic. Now it's pretty good!

I had to make a couple of subsitutions; but it turned fantastic & I will make it again.
