Made this just for my husband and I because I wanted to test it before making for guests.  We loved it!  Next time I will use the remaining pineapple juice when making the rice and will reduce the chicken broth by that amount.  Will do this just because we really like pineapple and I think it will add to the rice.  I used boneless chicken but I think this would also be great with skin.  I hesitated about making this because the other review was SO negative but then realized the reviewer hadn't even made the recipe!

Please proof-read your recipe better:  Ingredients calls for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but instructions say to rub spice mixture over and under the skin.  What skin?  Mine?  :D

I used what I had in my home.  I didn't have pineapple rings so I used chunks.  I liked the spicy rub paste. Very nice.  I used brown rice and used the pineapple juice as others have suggested.   I had split chicken breasts on the bone.  It still turned out great.  I Will make this again.

I tried this recipe because it had ingredients that I like. But I did not like it. First of all the "rub" turned out like a paste which was too thick. The only change I made was I used chunk pineapple because that was all I had. I also followed the hint to use the juice in the rice (which turned out great.) I only cooked the chicken for 20 minutes because if you cook for the 30 to 40 minutes the recipe calls for it would be too dry. I will try this recipe again using bone in chicken thighs.

Was not big on this recipe. The rice didn't have much flavor and the chicken had too much spice. The pineapple is what saved it.

The allspice-nutmeg flavors didn't mesh well with the chicken in my dish. The rice was highly enjoyable, especially with the sweetness cooked out of the pineapple. I'll probably make the rice again if I have leftover pineapple.

I took the advice of several reviews and then only made the rice with this recipe. I made a Baja citrus marinade and sauce for dish and that with the rice was fantastic! I am keeping this recipe as a great reference to modify!

I liked it fairly well.  Nothing special.   But I couldn't take the leftovers in the evening - just didn't like it.

The rice was awesome. Unless you like tyme I would reduce the amount this recipe calls for by a lot. It was all we could taste. Chicken was moist.
