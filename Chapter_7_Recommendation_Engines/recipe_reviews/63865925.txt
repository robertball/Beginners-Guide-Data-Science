I left a review earlier for this recipe but I don't see that it posted so I will try again. This was a very delicious tasting recipe. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again. The only thing I didn't like was the crust was a little dry. Next time I will use less potato flakes. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
