This recipe was good, but I wasn't blown away.  I made the risotto up to the point of adding the cheese and felt it was the right consistency and the flavor of beets was really coming through.  It definitely needed salt to bring out the flavor.  I was hesitant to overwhelm the dish with the cheese so only used half.  It tasted good, but ended up very cheddary tasting.  I'd recommend if you like the beet flavor to add 1/4-1/2 the cheese in the original recipe and add some acid in the form of lemon juice or some green onion at the end.  Otherwise, a great idea for risotto.  Really like using the whole beet, greens and all.

I chopped the beet and beet greens for this risotto. I used brown rice because I couldn't find the kind of rice called for.  Very colorful and tasty!

I did enjoy this however it wasn't amazing. The beet flavor was there but I don't know how well the beet and cheese complimented each other. Tasted like it was missing something.

I would give this recipe a 5 except it does require a good bit of prep time cutting and mincing, and ALOT of stirring and standing by the pan. Other than that, excellent and not too difficult to make. Even my kids who are SUPER picky (I mean only mac n cheese or grilled cheese for them) will eat this. It is one of the very few things I can make that everyone will eat. This gets devoured at our house. I use mild cheddar, and don't add salt or pepper - I let everyone do their own salt if desired.

Excellent with a few modifications: brown rice (so I cooked an hour with 7 cups liquid, simmering one cup at a time), shredded beets/greens, and a touch of butter and lemon juice at the very end. Also, the cheese isn't needed at all, just put a little parmesan on top instead.

only added 1/2 the cheese. was kinda of bland for me, not enough beet flavor.  I did, however use white wine instead of water, and i think that helped!

I took this to a pot-luck of a bunch of vegetable eaters and got a shout out for this dish.

I liked this very much!  I made a batch as directed and one with herb cream cheese and chard.  I liked the cream cheese version better but both are lovely. Even my kids liked it!

I left out some of the cheese and was glad I did.  Also, I had a very, very hard time getting past the way this looked...to me it looked like raw meat on my plate.  Sorry

I just made this--soo delicious! 

This was my first time cooking beets so it was messy and difficult to remove the skin but totally worth it in the end. 

I didn't have a food processor so I just diced the beets.  I also didn't use the greens, still amazing!

let me first say i hate beets but my mom likes them so i thought i'd try this.  It was fantastic!!! i can't believe how much i liked this recipe.  the only problem was that i thought the rice was a bit over-cooked (but that might be my fault).  next time i'll reduce the water to just one cup and simmer for only 10 minutes.  overall though this is so original and delicious!

I've made this many times over the last few years and it never fails to be spectacular.  I've done it both with blending the beets and just leaving them in chunks--both are good, just depends on whether you like to eat the chunks.  I tend to use more vegetable broth than water to give the risotto more flavor.  SO good!

Maybe it was the cheese I used but this tasted  like overpowering cheddar and nothing else.  It wasn't even a sharp cheddar!  I was very disappointed with the outcome.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was creamy and looked pretty but otherwise it just didn't deliver.  I'm really sorry I can't rate this recipe higher.

ok- tasted kind of earthy.  Needed more beet taste.  Loved the color though.

Very easy to make.  Turned out exactly like the picture shows.  My husband couldn't get enough.
