My family are not soup lovers but they really enjoy this one - they have seconds!  It's a keeper.    Followed the recipe but I  cut down on boiling/simmering times cuz of the frozen veggies and potatoes.  Don't like soggy veggies so use your judgment/preference for how you like veggies.

This was excellent- I'm a huge fan of soup, so I'm easy to please, but even my soup-hating kids liked it!  I chose to brown the turkey and onions, etc in the pot, then added the veggies after- just wanted to save washing a pan.  I also didn't add the rice, simply because I forgot- oops!  But I'm not sure I would add it the next time I make it, it was great without the rice. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have zucchini so just increased the amounts of the other vegetables and it was wonderful just the same.  The only things I added were some chicken bouillon powder to taste and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  The second time I made it I used shredded chicken instead of ground turkey, and that was scrumptious also!

This was awesome.  Omitted the zucchini since out of season and still turned out great.  Will make again.

Loved it. My whole family liked it. Actually thought it was better the next day as flavors blended more fully overnight. I might consider using pearl barley instead of rice next time for something different.

This was excellent and very easy!  I am not a spice girl, but decided to follow  the recipe exactly, and the blend of spices was perfect!!  I will definitely be making this one again!!
