WOW!! This was amazing as it was easy! I improvised alot just using what I had on hand. Garlic infused olive oil, kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, tyme and oregeno. I did cut them into smaller bites as one user had suggested and tossed in some onions. Only one change if you are going to use onions (and you should...YUMMY) put them in about 10 min before taking the potatoes out or else they will just be crunchy and burnt. The high heat is a MUST and everything came out PERFECT!!!

These were good, but I found that you really do need to make sure these potatoes are the new or small potatoes for them to really be worth this simple recipe.  If you use larger potatoes, you'd have to cut them into smaller pieces and you'd lose the brown crispy part of it on some of the sides that are cut (which really makes the potato in my opinion!).  I used coarsely ground sea salt and coarsely crushed black pepper, and I also sprinkled the potatoes with parsley.  Next time I might add a little bit of rosemary also!

I was in search of an easy, yet tasty recipe for roasted red potatoes.  I actually modifed this a bit by using sea salt instead of reg. salt, added minced garlic and rosemary.  The end result was... the potates were roasted to perfection and had a great flavor. My family truly enjoyed them. I will certainly use this recipe again.

We do this ALL the time. It is an excellent, easy and quick side dish for any meat. If you are short on time, zap the potatoes in the microwave for 2-3 minutes and then proceed with the recipe, it will be done in half the time. Sometimes I add thinly sliced onion to the pan with the potatoes too.

Yummy! 450 was the perfect temperature. I left them in the oven a little longer and the potatoes were nice and crispy on the outsides and so fluffy and smooth inside! I added parsley, rosemary and parmesan cheese (cheese added the last 10 minutes). Delicious potatoes!

I've been roasting vegetables for years now, and this recipe is a great intro to roasted veggies. The high temperature is a must, just keep a close eye on the oven. I used sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, olive oil, and fresh chopped parsley. It's quick and easy, and a great accompaniment to any main dish. Plus, while your meat is resting, you can use your hot oven by uping the temperature and roasting the veggies, and then everything is ready at the same time. Try this recipe with asparagas - I promise you'll love it!

VERY good!  Only things I changed was that I cut the potatoes into smaller more bite-sized friendly cubes, added two medium cloves of minced garlic, and kept them in the oven at a lower temp for slightly longer.  Also, covered with foil, but took the foil off for the last 10-15 mins to give them a slightly crispy texture.  Awesome & I will keep this recipe!

Quick and easy potato recipe. I just added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the mix and the potatoes turned out perfect. Instead of halving the potatoes I quartered them instead.

I was very disappointed by this recipe. The stated time/temperature was far too high. Also although I did season them, they still came out rather bland. Within 20 minutes the potatoes were almost burnt. I would suggest a longer period of time at a lower temperature.

We really like this nice, easy recipe.  I add season salt and just a bit of garlic powder to better suit our taste.  The kids love it.

It's all about the temperature and time and 450 degrees for approx 30 minutes works for this type of potato. Definitely check after about 20 minutes as individual ovens differ. This is the perfect base recipe that you can modify by adding spices, seasonings, garlic, onions, whatever. I like to add dried basil and thyme. Line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up. The olive oil prevents sticking.

Oh, were these good.  Just a couple of these for each of us with our breakfast omelet this morning was a delicious and satisfying treat.  I used baby Yukon Golds rather than red potatoes and found the roasting time spot on accurate for perfectly roasted and browned potatoes.  I particularly appreciated the simplicity of nothing more than salt and pepper.

Quick, simple and tasty. Almost every previous reviewer changed the original recipe in some way, but I say leave well enough alone. I too was tempted to enhance these since the recipe is so simple. I resisted, and I'm glad I did!

You can't go wrong with roasted red potatoes as a side dish.  I used a quartered my potatoes, used a little kosher salt and added a little garlic and rosemary.

Making this again tonight!  Awesome but simple recipe.  I took everyone's suggestions and baked for 45 minutes instead of 30.  I also added a little steak seasoning, seasoned salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Super easy recipe.  I used my cast iron skillet in the oven to make them crispy.  Everyone in the family loved this recipe, I will be making them again and again!

the photo shows something green on the potato. the recipe doesn't call for anything green, so i added italian spice. it was very good,but i will tell you what is better.slice several red potatoes into a gallon zip lock bag. add one or two tablespoons olive oil and one packet of dry hidden valley ranch dressing mix and a little salt and pepper. cook the same way, or instead, add lipton onion soup mix. use the broiler pan for crispy results

I had purchased some baby Yukon Gold potatoes and was looking for a roasted new potato recipe when I came across this one.  I used the same amounts but seasoned with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper as well as herbes du Provence.  Since I was roasting a chicken at the same time, I threw them in with the chicken on the highest rack at 350 (turned down from 400) for about thirty minutes.  They were marvelous; they tasted like BUTTER.  (Which is perhaps due in part to my Yukon Gold fetish.)
Very simple and adaptable recipe.

For each pound of potatoes I add 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp oregano to the olive oil and mix with potatoes.  Then I also dice one  small onion per pound of potatoes as well and add this to the mix before roasting.

Excellent recipe! This is my new favorite way to eat red potatoes. By only using the olive oil, salt, and pepper, we were able to taste and appreciate the true flavor of these delightful little potatoes.. instead of covering up the flavor with lots of extra spices and seasonings. This recipe is great as is. Will absolutely make these again soon.

This is the third review that I've written tonight and I feel like I'm one of those crazy cooks who never follows any recipe. I would have LOVED to follow this recipe to a T but didn't have red potatoes..so I just used the concept for this with what I had. I just thought some folks might be interested in how it turned out. I used two large baking potatoes. I peeled and cubed them in large chunks. I them peeled two Australian carrots (they are SO sweet) and also cut them in big chunks. Tossed with the oil, sea salt and fresh pepper and then baked for about one hour. They turned out REALLY nice...great compliment to the Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast we also had.

These are absolutely yummy and always a hit! The only reason they are 4 stars is because sometimes they are really roasted and crunchy & other times not so much & I have to put them back in for longer. I do the same thing every time & cant figure out why. Make sure to use plenty of pepper (fresh ground makes a huge difference) and plenty of salt. Definitely a keeper.

i used sea salt instead, and actually my mother-in-law came over and distracted me so they cooked about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but with such a nice crispy crust on the outside i think i may cook them longer next time. wonderful little recipe thanks

Simple and delicious. I double the salt and pepper, and toss the finished potatoes with a little minced parsley before serving.

These were absolutely to die for.  I should have doubled the potatoes, as my family couldn't get enough of them.  I did add one more ingredient to them, I sprinkled generously with onion powder.  I will definately be making these more often.  Thanks for a great recipe

Simple, quick, delicious way to prepare red potatoes.  It made a great vegetable side dish for the Chicken Breasts with Balsalmic Vinegar and Garlic recipe from this site.  The minimal seasoning really helped to enhance the natural, mild sweetness of the red potatoes and allowed for the stronger flavor of the main dish to take center stage.  Loved it and will definitely make again and again!

I only give this a 4 because it takes a lot to give out a 5. This is a very quick and simple recipe and I will definitely make it again and again. I sliced my potatoes into quaters and shook the olive oil, potatoes, pepper, salt, garlic powder, and dried basil in a zip lock bag before baking them to spread the seasoning evenly. With about 10 minutes left I placed onions on the baking sheet to sautee in the the oil and seasoning. Everything turned out very good and went excellent with my sauteed mushrooms and grilled steak.

This is a delicious and easy side dish. Three suggestions: spray the pan lightly with cooking spray to keep the potatoes from sticking; 450 is a good temperature, but watch the taters so they don't burn (30 minutes was the perfect time for mine, but ovens vary); 1 pound of potatoes, quartered, was enough to feed 6 people.

Absolutely wonderful recipe, and so simple.  Scaled down the recipe for 4 servings using 1/8 cup olive oil, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper, and also added in about a teaspoon of dried rosemary.  Roasted as directed and it came out fan-tab-u-lous!  Have added to my recipe box and will definitely use this recipe again... it got rave reviews at home!

This has become a family favorite at our house!  It's easy and delicious.  Along with salt, pepper and olive oil, I always sprinkle these potatoes with parmesan cheese.  I just use Kraft in a can, but fresh would be even better.  The cheese really adds texture and a little more flavor.

These are simply the best roasted potatoes that I have had. Since using the recipe, which came out flawless and delicious, I have changed up what I add to them depending on what they are paired with. Tonight, I'm adding fresh chopped garlic and thyme to the mix and baking them with that. THey should be perfect!!! Thank you so much!

This recipe is fine on its own but I had just saved the DUCK FAT from our Christmas Duck so I had to use it.  I replaced the olive oil with 2 tablespoons chilled duck fat and I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic.  These few modifications turned this recipe turned into out of this world.  Duck fat makes everything better...unless your a vegetarian.

Goodness on a fork. I did this in a deep dish lined with foil. Used grapeseed oil instead (has higher smoke point = safer. olive oil gets toxic on high heat) and then i added rosemary, oregano and pepper. cooked for about 45 minutes to get it real crispy. SO yumm!

Excellent, simple recipe. We enjoyed these potatoes very much. It is always nice to prepare potatoes differently now and then and this is so simple and reheat beautifully the next day. Good to the very last potato.

These were great! Olive oil is too expensive for our budget right now so I just melted a stick of unsalted REAL butter in a bowl and coated the potatoes with it. It worked just fine. I also quartered the potatoes to make for easier serving and eating. And my oven never would crisp them so I had to turn it to broil and stir the potatoes every few minutes. It worked like a charm. Don't skip the sea salt, 'tis what makes 'em! :)

This was super easy and the potatoes make a great addition to the meal.  Red potatoes are so sweet and the olive oil just adds to the taste.  I cut mine in small pieces and put the potato side down so they get crispy.

Very good as a basic recipe.  Each time we have it we tweak it a little bit more.  We like it with rosemary, and garlic powder added.

Yummy, delicious! Very simple and easy recipe. One word of advice - eat it soon after you take it out of the oven or don't cook it too much in advance because the potatoes will get very salty the longer it sits around.

Absolutely the best way to roast potatoes.
The secret is not turning them but keeping the cut side down.
I will never do them any other way.
Used a zip-lock bag to shake with seasoned pepper, lawrys salt and Mrs. Dash.  Everyone raved and raved.

My boyfriend made these tonight using white new potatoes, no olive oil, and sprinkled them with garlic powder along with salt and pepper. They are a fantastic side dish. I like mine with a pat of butter or sour cream.

Yes, I made this recipe.  It was delicious.  The tiny new red potatoes I used were perfect.  I cut them in half and followed the recipe as it was written.  They were crisp and a lovely brown on the cut side, yet tender on the inside.  I will definitely make these again.  I've pinned the recipe, saved it on Allrecipes, and posted it on my Facebook page.  Definitely a keeper.

This is great with all kinds of veggies. I get a big bowl and cut up turnip; squash; sweet potato or yams;red and white potatos; Brussel sprouts and put Olive oil in to coat and mix well with your hands (add the herbs and seasoning you like)and spread single layer on Jelly roll pan(s) covered in foil and sprayed with oil spray. Bake uncovered until tasty and toasty. Time will vary based on size you cut pieces/ try to be consistant with size or use bigger pices of food that will cook faster. Can add whole Mushrooms and onion chunks for last 10 to 15 minutes. I usually go for 400 degrees. Left-overs taste great. I usually reheat in a frying pan to get back some crispiness.
Roasting really changes the flavour - especially the Brussel sprouts and brings out the sweetness in many vegetables.

I make these potatoes all the time,,Easier to use a zip-lock bag to toss them in. I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil, salt, pepper and add other herbs. Parsley, Rosemary, Thyme, even Mc Cormick's "perfect Pinches" work great, any combination. I do however bake at 350* for about 40 minutes or more. The potatoes are cut to about 1" pieces. Never left overs here.

I make these all the time, but use just regular potatoes and cube them. Then I drizzle them with oil, add seasoned salt, Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb, dried minced onion, Cajun seasoning to taste and pepper. Toss and roast at 425 til the potatoes are tender. My family loves them.

Excellent! 
Try thinly slicing potatoes by placing them on a tablespoon, which keeps knife from slicing through and separating
potatoes. Every slice gets crispy at the edges. 
Better and Healthier than wedges or fries.

Just easy crispy and simple potato recipe...no changes needed.  For those of you who felt that the heat was too high...at a lower heat you do not achieve such a nice crispy crust and also has a better flavor.

Followed the recipe with the exception that I used parchment paper on the cookie sheet. Best roasted red potatoes I've made, and I've tried several other recipes.  I think the temperature, using the low oven rack, using a cookie sheet, checking after 20 minutes, etc., made them just the right texture: crispy outside, puffy inside - not mushy or soggy!

This recipe was so simple and so delicious!! My husband and I both thought they tasted like potatoes that you would get at a very nice restaurant. I only made a pound of potatoes, adjusted the olive oil, salt and pepper accordingly, and added a clove of minced garlic while tossing. Excellent!

Simple and foolproof recipe.  I added some thyme and oregano as well.  Baked them for 20 minutes, then turned them over for another 5 or so and they came out crispy on top.

These are perfect the way they are. I did grind some sea salt and fresh pepper, mix it together and then sprinkle it over the potatoes and oil I put in a plastic bag to coat. They turned out wonderfully, just enough flavor to compliment the grilled chicken and fresh veggie crudities. Even hubby loved them, and he's always resistant to trying new recipes.

these did not work for me. i dont know what i did wrong but i had to cook them for almost an hour and then added water because they would not get tender. mabee it was because i used canola oil instead of olive. i can't rate them on their taste because i also did not have salt or pepper.

So simple and SOOOOOO yummy!  I cut my potatos and placed them in a 1 gallon ziploc bag with the oil and seasoning and shook them to coat.  I left them in the bag sealed while the prime rib was in the oven.  When the rib came out, I put the potatos and bacon- wrapped aspasagus (this site) in for 25 mins at 425.  They were crisp on the bottom side and soft and perfect inside.  I used the Pampered Chef stoneware bar pan for these, which helped cispen the bottom side.  Will make over and over- my entire family and our dinner guest LOVED these!

This recipe is great and super easy.  Even my 11 y.o. who hates trying new things loved this.  He ate 1/2 the bowl...  Since we often like things to have a little kick, I have sprinkled the potatoes with seasoning I bought from Red Robin restaurant.

Excellent--quick and simple!  I added a bit of cajun spices to taste and they turned out perfectly.  Also lined my baking sheet with aluminum foil to ease the clean up.  I quartered my new potatoes because of their size and was still great.  I also cooked these for about 25 min, then flipped to the other side to brown for another 10.  Will be adding to my collection.

I love this simple recipe! Baked at 425 for about 25 minutes and it was perfect. I both quartered and halved the potatoes depending on the size of each one. I also used seasoned salt rather than regular salt and I highly, highly recommend that you try this too! This recipe is very kid friendly.

These potatoes were good. My boyfriend raved over them, and I almost felt guilty because of how easy they were. I also seasoned mine with garlic powder and onion powder. Very basic - just your run of the mill roasted red potato - and very easy.

Simple and delicious!  I put foil on the cookie sheet to make clean-up easier, and it seems the potatoes came out a little overcooked.  But they still tasted great.  I also added some crushed garlic (which I could of actually added more).  I'll definately make these again.

The taste was good, i gave it 4 because of the imprecise time given. I'm a new cook and I couldn't tell when they were fully cooked but not burnt, so I burned them the first time :(

Can you say YUMMY!! The only thing I changed was cutting into bite size pieces and added some parsley to add a little color.  Baked at 450 for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were wonderful and so simple to make.  I just added some garlic and onion powder to the seasoning mix along with some oregano to taste.  I also sprayed the pan with some non-stick cooking spray.  Delicious!  I will make these again soon!

These were simple, and tasted great.  There wasn't much pizzaz involved, but it was a nice easy side dish.  I cooked them in the same oven as my chicken (at 350 degrees) for the last half hour, and they were done.  Thanks for the recipe!

A good starting point for roasted potatoes.  Easy to adjust seasonings to your own tastes or the meal you are serving it with.  We like ours sprinkled with Italian Seasoning.

I thought this recipe was good, but I would re-season the potatoes after putting them on a cookie sheet. I think the oil takes off some of the flavoring, and I had to re-season once they came out of the oven. As others suggested, I added some garlic salt, onion, and some parsley. I also took the suggestion of another and baked them at 350 for 45-55 minutes. I was really concerned baking them at 450. They came out great at 350 and were awesome as leftovers.

This is my new favorite way to make potatoes.  I didn't have any olive oil, so I used melted butter.  I also added a dash of parsley and garlic powder, with the salt/pepper.  These were fantastic!

The trick is the high temperature.  Makes them very crispy with a great edge all the way around.  We actually quartered the larger red potatoes, halved the smaller ones, added lots of crushed garlic, about 5 large cloves, and about 3 TBSP of fresh, chopped rosemary.   We let the potatoes marinate for about an hour  before baking and we turned them carefully a couple of times during baking.

These where very good. They were all gone with in minutes. After reading some reviews I did add sea salt, Rosemary, and sparsely. I think these added spices really added a complexity in taste to this recipe. Will deff make it again. Maybe try thyme next time.

Obsessed with this recipe! BUT- like others have said, I added 1 tsp of oregano, thyme and minced garlic. Baked them at 425 for 1/2 hr. I like mine a little crispy, so I'll generally check them at the 1/2 mark and then cook them longer if they aren't soft all the way.

Turned out delicious! However, I'm VERY glad I checked it at 20 minutes in, because I would have had charred potatoes if I hadn't taken them out. I ended up turning all the potatoes and putting it back in the oven at 350 on the top rack for the remaining 10 minutes. They turned out fine with that one adjustment.

I made this tonight with a pork roast. I added rosemary and a little thyme because we like it. The roast cooked at a lower temp so I put the potatoes on the top gr8 for sometime at 325 then turned it up to 375 to finish. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and delicious dish! I tried this recipe about few days ago. It was a huge hit with my family. I did have to add a few sprinkles of salt to the top after I took them out of the oven, though. I tried this recipe again today, but I modified it a little. I put the parsley in before I put it in the oven and I added a pinch of onion powder and a few dashes of Parmesan cheese. They came out delicious!

Love this recipe! I've made them this way many times over the years. You can also use regular potatoes. Just cut them in half length-wise then each half, cut length-wise again into three or four long wedges. Proceed with tossing them in the olive oil and seasonings. I like to mix it up by adding garlic powder sometimes and even old bay seasoning for a bit more zip. Just go with the herbs and/or seasonings you and your family enjoy!

I did these with salmon which took 30 minutes so I gave this 30 minutes. It was too long and burned on the bottom. Truthfully, they were still pretty darn good. My fault though, I did them at 400 in deference to one of the more experienced cooks. It would have been great had I checked at 20 minutes as suggested. I used fresh ground pepper and fresh ground sea salt. Delicious!

Simple, easy to make and great taste. I did add two cloves of garlic minced. I added 2 tablespoons of chopped Italian parsley towards the end of cooking. I also stirred / tossed the potatoes midway through the cooking to ensure even browning. This is a keeper!! Kids love it too!!

Really good!  The first time I've ever roasted potatoes where they came out tender and cooked through all the way.  I think next time I would add some extra salt and maybe some additional seasoning, but these would be so good under a beef gravy.

These are very good with the new red potatoes, but we really enjoy the recipe with the baby yukon gold potatoes.  I just halve the ingredients for the two of us.  Have also sprinkled with crushed rosemary.  With the baby potatoes, 20 minutes in the oven is sufficient

I made these in a foil pack on the grill, top rack at around 350-375 for about an hour(because I left them whole). This recipe lets the potato be the star and  was a nice change from always dressing them up.

This is a great, basic side dish that allows for a lot of personalization. I personally like to add either ranch dressing mix, or some cajun seasoning and garlic powder.

This is a great and easy side! I enjoyed it, but it needs more flavor! I'm all about flavor! I'll be using this recipe alot, but I'm going to experiment with it to give it more kick! Was easy to make and was good.

There are excellent. Use Kosher salt as it is more like salt you would find aon a pretzel! YOU DO NOT need all that oil! I simply brush mine and add the salt. Turn half way for optimal crispness.

Indeed these are great, easy and you will get excellent reviews from friends that come over.  I add fresh Rosemary leaves when I tumble the potatoes with the oil.  Hint, the smaller the potato the sweeter they are!

So easy and oh so good! Ten minutes before they were done, I tossed some chopped onion and minced garlic in with the potatoes. I also added some rosemary with the salt and pepper just because I love rosemary on potatoes! Excellent, simple, and quick to make; thanks for the great recipe!

My family really enjoyed these, I really enjoyed the simplicity!  The potatoes definitely have to be cut smaller than in half, I quartered some, and for larger potatoes, I cut them into 6 pieces. In my opinion, there was a little too much pepper, and I will reduce the amount next time. I stirred these a couple of times during cooking to brown them on all sides, and probably cooked a little longer than 30 min. I not only reheated these for lunch the next day, but on the third day, I chopped them up small and reheated them to have for breakfast - yum!

Very easy to prepare and delicious, especially with the kids.  My son ate them like French Fries.  And adults enjoyed them too!  The only caution:  you may not want to make these on a hot summer evening (as I did), because preheating the oven to 450 degrees and baking in that temp can increase the temp of the kitchen/house.

this was a really easy and tasty.  i left them in for about 30 mins and for the most part they didn't burn, but a few were pretty crunchy.  i think i'll try 25 mins next time.  other than that they were great.  i added a little roseymary to them for some extra flavor.  it still needed something, so i'll also try green onions and garlic as others have suggested.  over all, it was really good.  I will definitely make them again!  thanks for such simple and yummy recipe!

Loved the texture of these potatoes but the taste was bland. I was looking for a basic recipe but it was a little too plain for me. Would make them again using some garlic or onion tossed in with them.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME- Best Red potatoes I've ever made/tasted.  I only did 1 1/2 lbs (so only baked about 20-25) and added about a teaspoon or so of minced garlic.  Phenomenal.  Also I think the garlic made a difference because I made them again without garlic and definately a differance, much better with the garlic.

Very good. I cut them into small pieces, and I seasoned them with garlic powder, black pepper & onion salt. The cooked perfectly, although I think it would have been a problem if I had left them in bigger pieces.

My family LOVES these potatoes! I've been making them for about 1.5 years now, and put them on a jelly roll pan and grill them on an upper rack. One of my son's friends was over for dinner once when I made them, and my son said he was bragging to all their friends about my famous roasted potatoes. Now that's success!

FANTASTIC!  I cut my potatoes into quarters and turned them to roast on all sides.  They were so simple to make.  I will be making them often.  Pam Anderson is right they are "roasted potatoes at their best".

Delicious! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, as I added garlic salt instead of salt and also added some rosemary and fresh ground pepper. I used a gallon sized ziploc bag to mix the ingredients and it was so simple and a great side!

Still in the oven but WOW they look & smell great!!  I am believing 2 things are key for these to be at their best, 1: the oven temp has to be high to get the nice brownness 2: they have to be on the lowest rack possible (just as recipe advises)....I followed the recipe but did sprinkle a lil oregano & garlic powder over them to suit our tastes.  I also had 1/2 an onion leftover from my meat loaf and at the advice of others I sliced it a lil thick and just tossed it over the potatoes in the last few mins of cooking, I turned them once, so the other cut side could get a nice golden brown.  What a simple easy and do-able recipe!  THANKS!

This is how I usually make my potatoes.  1/4 olive oil seemed a bit much as my potatoes were swimming in it.  Added a little more salt and pepper and also some garlic powder and oregano.  Cut potatoes in 1/4's since they were a little bigger and cooking time was about 30 minutes.  Crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.

We doubled this recipe and used for a side dish this Thanksgiving, to rave reviews from the 3 families at the table.  We added multi-colored peppers (3) and one whole large yellow onion.  We got rave reviews, and are still enjoying them the day after as if they were fresh. We will ad a pinch more salt next time, but otherwise perfect as written.  Great recipe!

Great and easy! Added some fresh parsley, rosemary, and chives to the olive oil which I put in a ziplock bag and then mixed with the potatoes. Cooked for about 22 minutes. they were perfect.

This is a wonderfully simplistic and delicious recipe. I have used this recipe several times as a base for roasted potatoes (trying garlic salt and other herbs).

Simple and delicious recipe!  I did cut my potatoes in quarters for smaller bites, but other than that followed the recipe.

These were great and easy. I used coarse kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, a little steak seasoning and some oregano (for color) and olive oil, tossed it all in a ziplock bag spread them out on a cookie sheet to bake. Will make again!

I didn't bother measuring the olive oil, and just poured into a ziploc bag (any excess oil stays in the bag). The best salt for potatoes is Kosher salt--IMO, it packs more of a salty punch that potatoes need. I also added fresh grated Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder.  My potatoes took almost 40 minutes to get golden brown.

These were just okay.  I thought they were a tad boring, but my husband liked them. We had them with gravy and they were good that way, but on their own they were just a bit bland for me.  They just tasted like potatoes with salt and pepper. Nothing special.

Great recipe! Used this along side our St. Patty's day corned beef...preferred this to the usual boiled/steamed potatoes. The potatoes I had were a little large, so I cut them into quarters instead of halves.

YUM!!  This recipe is so simple, but so perfect.  I usually cut my red potatoes into small cubes, but they turned out so much better this way.  All I had were the bigger red potatoes, so I just cut them in thirds lengthwise.  They took exactly 30 minutes.  Oh, and I think the temperature made all the difference.  I usually do roasted potatoes at 375, but not any more.  I added parsley, but that is all I did different.  

Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband is a Brit and loves his roasted potatoes. He loves these, and I am happy to have a recipe so simple and so good. We had them this weekend with  roasted leg of lamb, brussel sprouts and carrots for typical British roast dinner. I cooked them at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours with the lamb.I have also made them with roast chicken and beef and even grilled salmon. I vary the cooking time with the size of the potatoes. Thanks.

These are a super easy any tasty side dish!  No clean up when you use tin foil and just mix them up right on there with the oil salt and pepper!  They always come out crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside!  We have made these proably at least five times since May.  Thanks for the recipe we really enjoy it!

For me, this was a great base recipe!  I used half butter, half olive oil and added 1/4t crushed (mortar/pestle) dried rosemary, 1/2 t fresh thyme leaves, kosher salt, and freshly ground pepper.  I shook everything together in a gallon ziplock, and dumped the potatoes into a foil-lined pan, excess butter/oil and all.  I did make sure to turn them all cut side down, to get the lovely brown color.  Since I was baking pork chops at the same time, I had these in the oven for almost 1 hour at 375 on the middle rack.  I thought I had made more than enough; they were gone in the blink of an eye!  Thanks for a great recipe.

LOVE this recipe...I'm not a big vegetable fan but I couldn't stop eating these potatoes!  I used a combination of red potatoes and carrots and added garlic and paprika to the recipe.  I also used freshly ground black pepper.  I want to try using a combination of red and sweet potatoes next.

Excellent. My husband bought two bags of red skinned potatos and then had no idea what to do with them. We tossed them in butter and also sprinkled garlic powder and Italian seasonings on them. Thanks for the recipe.

A good basic recipe that is easy to customize.  I have also used sweet potatoes with equally good results.  You can add onions, if desired.  Small, whole, blanched, peeled onions are great in this dish.

Love this!  Makes for a quick, easy and delicious side dish.  Impressive enough for company, but yummy enough for kids.  I sometimes toss with a few finely chopped fresh herbs as well - adds a bit of color.

One of my families favorite quick side dishes to throw together! Goes great with just about anything. I also love to add some garlic (fresh minced or powder) and some rosemary for extra flavor.

Will definitely make again.  Make sure you coat cooking sheet with a little  PAM, otherwise they will stick.

They came out great! A little crispy on the peel and soft in the middle. I may put butter on them next time to give them a bit more flavor but overall, delicious!

I used larger red potatoes and cut them into 4.  Cooked for half an hour total (turning them at 15 minutes).  They were perfect and everyone loved them.  I used a nice dark cookie sheet.  They did not stick.  There is no need to parboil.

I have made this dish several times.  I've gone with the previously mentioned addition of fresh garlic and chopped fresh rosemary.  The glass oven pan is really a mess to clean so I now add single layer of parchment paper... clean up is a breeze and the potatoes don't stick.  I usually make more then we need for dinner.  The leftovers, chopped into cubes and reheated with a tablespoon of cooking oil make outstanding country potatoes for breakfast.

Simple and easy. Tastes great - works for small red potatoes and the medium sized. I like to get let them get very brown and crispy on the outside. Great side for many dishes.

Made this both exactly as written and was very good.  Next time I sprinkled with some garlic herb seasoning and a 3/4 cup of sweet onion.  That really took it up a notch.  Also put it under the broiler for the last two minutes to crisp the edges.

Great recipe for an easy side dish any main course meat. The only changes I made were to use a few other spices like Italian seasoning, and seasoned salt in place of regular salt.

Delicious and easy. Husband declared them better than French Fries. I added sliced and chopped white onion and a dash of garlic salt. Definitely in rotation here.

Love these potatoes. Don't take long to cook and they come out crispy and very delicious.  I always add garlic salt instead of table salt and italian seasoning and garlic powder sprinkled on top mixed with the olive oil on a foil covered  cookie sheet. Perfect!

First time making it. Tried to combine the cooking with some baked chicken so I adjusted the cooking temp to 375 for the chicken and hoped that the potatoes would cook about the same. They did come up fairly well. Didn't get the golden brown this time. That was due to the moisture of the chicken. But all in all a good recipe that's easy on the shopping list.

This was delicious.  I cooked my potatoes for 20 and added garlic powder cayenne pepper to mine to give it a bit more taste, along with the salt and pepper. After they finished cooking I put a little bit of lemon juice on the top. I will definitely cook these again.

We did these on the barbecue and they came out wonderful. The only change was the use of garlic salt instead of sea salt. Thanx for the recipe, and see the picture added

Add new red beets, cooked alongside the potatoes and you have a perfect side dish.

Very easy and tasty recipe.   My only complaint is that despite the ingredients and the use of a non-stick pan, they stuck to the bottom of the pan as if they were glued on!  Next time I make it, I will have to experiment with additional ingredients in an effort to keep the little fellas from sticking so badly!

These were so good.  Made as directed except added a little garlic powder.  Potatoes were crispy on outside and soft, creamy and had a slight sweetness to the inside. Delicious!!

Cooked as the recipe directs, these turned out completely tasteless and boring. With enough tweaking and spicing, I suppose it would be a better recipe. Into my "do not repeat file".

I absolutely loved this recipe for red potatoes! I made it one night with grilled basil shrimp and corn on the cob. I just made sure the potatoes were cut into smaller pieces, instead of just the recommended halves.

Easy and so tasty. I've made this recipe several times now with great success.  The only change I made was adding some fresh rosemary. It made a lovely side dish for some holiday gatherings with company.  It was a big hit!

I have been making small red and Yukon gold are also a good potato to use. The picture show it with what I assume is parsley which wasn't added to the recipe. Fresh chopped is best and I usually toss it in a few minutes before potatoes are done, maybe the last 1-2 minutes. Adds a nice flavor.

Love these as does my husband.  I followed the recipe as written.  It was so simple and produced a potato that was a nice accompaniment to a roast that I had baked. Easy side dish for a weekday night.

A delicious, easy recipe! The key is to pick potatoes that are the same size and then cut them into the same size, so that they all cook evenly. I have been cutting my potatoes in quarters and it's the perfect size for eating. My family loves these!

Loved the recipe! Would be very easy to adjust seasonings to your main dish.As I made this as a side to a pork loin seasoned with dijon mustard, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, and honey, I made it as shown, and there was nothing left! Will definitely use again.

As another viewer added I also have been using this method for quite some time, but I add to the mix 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  It adds a bit more flavor boost also..

These turned out great.  Instead of using the different spices, I had a 1/2 of a dry ranch mix that needed used.  I tossed the potatoes into a ziploc bag, poured in the EVOO, 1/2 ranch packet, fresh ground black pepper and a little bit of red pepper flakes.  My potatoes were perfectly done in 30 minutes at 450 (on the bottom rack).  The side that was down was very brown and crispy and the rest of the potato was nice and tender.  DELICIOUS and FABULOUSLY EASY.

I wanted to try something new with potatoes and this was it!! I tossed them about half way through. They came out very tender and some had some nice crunch to them. I added some mexican cheese for the last 5 mins. My oldest twin boy, who is also my pickiest eater, ate these up in no time flat!! I will be putting this dish on my permanent rotation!!

I made these potatoes as a side dish to the juicy roasted chicken and it was such a hit! The potatoes had just the right amount of flavor and crisp to them. They were very economical, easy, and delicious. My kids even enjoyed them and they do not really like side dishes. Excellent potatoes!

I am a fan of big flavors and lots of herbs and spices, but sometimes I want to just let the integrity of good ingredients speak for themselves.  Here I used baby Reds and also fingerling Yukon Gold.  Delicious roasted with nothing but salt and freshly ground black pepper.  When I first read the recipe I thought it was way too much olive oil, but then when I scaled it to 4 servings I realized it was just right.  The key is roasting at a high temperature to get them nice and brown.  I've been doing this for years and will continue to.

Have been using this recipe for several months now.  It's so easy and versatile.  Usually add lots of garlic salt and powder, Emeril's for a kick, parsley and basil.  They get this wonderful crunch to them.  YUM!

Amazing!  My boyfriend thought I had soaked the potatoes in butter, they had such a wonderful flavor inside the perfect golden crust- not to mention the insides were so perfectly cooked.  I was apprehensive about this recipe and the method of cooking, but this will be my new way of roasting potatoes!!

I added rosemary and garlic to the potatoes and they were the best ones I have ever made! Nest time I'll put the rack closer to the top so they crisp up a little more. These are my new favorite!

Perfect!  Added dried parsley and garlic powder.  Cut potatoes into small bite sized pieces.  Baked for about 35-40 minutes.  Poured all of olive oil into the pan.

These were SUPER EASY to make and absolutely DELICIOUS. My boyfriend loved them! I made two small modifications to the recipe 1) i included a pinch of garlic powder in the salt and pepper mixture and  2) I put the potatoes in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes before putting them in the oven to speed up the cooking process. I kept my eye on the potatoes and took them out after about 15 minutes. I made these with grilled asparagus, filet mignon, and a reduced balsamic sauce. Will definitely make this again!

Really easy and quite tasty.  A healthy alternative to serving chips.  I've made these potatoes several times, and each time I've experimented with the seasonings.  My husband I think they're especially delicious with Paula Deen's Silly Salt in place of plain table salt.

This was a great recipe.  Simple, flavorful, easy to change up w/a little garlic, rosemary, tarragon or any herb, we cut larger potatoes into quarters, cooked according to directions and perfect!  Will do again for sure!

I've made these several times since finding this recipe just a few weeks ago.  I've made it with just new potatoes, but I think it tastes even better with a blend of new, purple and yellow tiny potatoes (they sell this blend at my neighborhood Whole Foods).  I cut the potatoes into small pieces first, use Kosher salt instead of regular salt along with the ground pepper, high smoke point grape seed oil, and add a dry seasoning blend (Mrs. Dash garlic & herb goes great with these).  This couldn't be much simpler, but the results are always fantastic!

The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is that I amended the recipe. I added garlic, which my family loves, and this is one of our favorite side dishes. I use 4-5 cloves.

It needed more flavor. I ended up sprinkling them with a little oregeno, rubbing butter over the tops and adding extra salt.

Awesome!  Simple back to the basics recipe.  I made these with fingerling potatoes and they were perfect.

Awesome recipe.  I used this to put together a frozen skillet breakfast.  I used regular baking potatoes cut into little cubes and added a little bit of parsley.  Once baked I let them cool to room temp. and then flash froze them.  When frozen I added them to my frozen peppers and flash frozen breakfast sausage.  The result was better then the Jimmy Dean frozen breakfast skillet and A LOT cheaper.  To hold cost down I used potatoes from a BOGOF sale, peppers from my own garden and sausage I used a coupon for.  This made for a super quick breakfast you just pull out of the freezer  that you could even add eggs to and it was only 35 cents per serving.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, I use it all the time!!  =)

a perfect easy recipe but i made a few changes... i didnt use regular pepper i used lemon pepper instead, i always add onion to it and also if you like a little spice try a tiny bit of cyan pepper. also i add 2 tablespoons of butter occasionally to the oil while roasting gives it a little extra flavor... o and dont for get the parsley or even cilantro.

This was fantastic. Seriously, the best roasted potatoes I have ever made (or had). The inside was tender and the outside was crisp.  Very nice.    At first I was skeptical.  I thought that cooking them on the lowest rack level would surely turn out burned-bad, but it didn't.  I would definitely go with the 20 minute to start advice because mine were perfect after 17 minutes (you know your oven).    This recipe is definitely worth trying and it's so easy to customize!

Love these potatoes.  I've tailored the spices to the meal...paprika, salt and pepper for breakfast; montreal seasoning when made as a steak side; rosemary, salt and pepper for pork.   I use white or red potatoes...whatever I have in the house. So easy!

These were so easy, and so tasty!  My husband and kids all loved them, which says a lot.  I didn't have the small potatoes, so I cut mine into smaller pieces.  Very yummy, I will definitely make these again!

Love Em!  Easy to make, and great to eat.  I threm my potatos in a large ziplock bag, then added the oil and some garlic, rosemary, and kosher salt.  Shake the bag up and they are perfectly coated.  Thanks for the recipe!

Be sure to heavily season these potatoes! You can use rosemary, garlic, thyme, oregano, or fresh ground pepper to really bring these to life.  Adding some chopped onions makes it even more tasty! (:  This is a quick side dish to cook at the last minute or if you aren't in the mood to slave over a stove.

This is the roased potato recipe I've been looking for!  I modified the seasonings and sprinkled the potatoes with rosemary, kosher salt, and lemon pepper--they turned out fantastically and were the hit of our dinner party.  The perfect (and flexible) side dish!

Good, quick and easy.  I upped the garlic and rosemary & gave a few shakes of sea salt and black pepper to the  tops.  I did boil the potatoes first for about 10 minutes and then followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and I think mine for some reason needed more oil than the 1/4 cup it called for.  So next time I will use more.  Make sure to turn because if I had not been checking they would have burnt on the bottom.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I used less oil, because I used fewer potatoes, and subbed garlic salt for regular salt and added some parsley. Everybody gobbled them up. A great new side dish for our family. Thanks!

YUMMMM...the only things i did differently was change the temp and cooking time because i was baking something else at the same time.  i also added something called Garlic Garlic that I got from Tastefully Simple.  will definitely make this again!

So easy, so yummy = the perfect recipe!  I used kosher salt and added a sliced onion about halfway through roasting.  Absolutely amazing!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is becoming a staple at our house.  The only additions I would suggest are some garlic and chopped onion, if that suits your taste.  I also chopped the potatoes in bite-sized pieces (cooks faster that way).  You will NOT be disappointed!

I liked this...I used baby gold potatoes and sprinkled them with some garlic powder, fresh parsley, and sea salt.  I had to cook them about 45 minutes, but they turned out great!!

Yum.  I added a little Italian seasoning to  a Ziploc bag with the potatoes, olive oil, salt/pepper and tossed to coat, then cooked in a baking dish sprayed with Pam. Cooked perfectly and tasted great!

Spray your pan first.... otherwise...Love these. I make them all the time except now I experiment with various spices. Excellent with spicy mustard tossed into the olive oil... such a great flavor especially if the main meat is seasoned similarly.  Great dish!

Very good recipe! In addition to salt and pepper I used some Fox Point Seasoning and cooked it for 10 min at 350, then about 20 min at 400 degrees. It came out perfect! I served it as a side dish for roasted rack of lamb from this web site. It was delicious!!

I thought these were awesome!!  I had larger red potatoes, so I cut them into bite size pieces and cooked them for about 50 minutes on 350.  They were crispy on the outside and had a soft and buttery texture inside.  I will definitely be making these often.  So easy and so delicious!!  :)

I fixed these for company a couple of weeks ago and my husband has asked for them three times since then!  These potatoes cook to just the right doneness inside and the outside is crisp and tasty.  I added a tablespoon of the rosemary chicken seasoning and they were fantastic.

Delicious, easy to make, and adaptable to any type of meal.  I made mine with a bit of dried basil and a dash of thyme to go with Ginger Steak and Sesame Green Beans (also from this site).  YUM!

These are so easy & delicious.  I couldn't stop taking "one more bite".  I added a tsp of distilled white vinegar some italian seasoning & thyme to the mix.  I'm sure they would have been great either way.  This will become a regular in my house. 

Thanks so much!

These roasted potatoes were very easy and delicious.   We enjoyed the recipe very much.  I just cooked them until they were a little crispy.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is outstanding. Nothing needs to be changed or altered in any way. It's perfect as is. My family and I love new potatoes and this will be our new favorite way of preparing them. Thanks for sharing your recipe Pam. It  was a big hit.

These were easy but didn't have a lot of flavor.  I'll try it again with a variation on the spices.  Edit: Used 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. sea salt, 2 tsp. dried parsley, and 1 tsp. garlic powder.

Pretty good, added garlic salt and oregano. My husband liked them more than I did, but I will make them again and next time I will add garlic.

This is a simple but easy and delish side dish! I was short on baking sheets, so I adjusted by adding them to a preheated cast iron skillet. It worked like a charm. I put them in the oven with my pork tenderlion at 325F, baked for 30 minutes, then after my pork was done and resting I cranked up the oven to broil and crisped and browned them a bit more.

I loved these potatoes. I added some garlic, rosemary and red pepper flakes to enhance the taste, and let them bake for about an hour. They came out nice and crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. And they're healthy for you too!

These potatoes are a cinch, and very tasty!  My family thought I must've gone to a lot of trouble to make these, they were so good.  
Recipe couldn't be any easier!

YUM!!  These potatoes are so easy and delicious!  I made some changes, as others suggested, cutting the potatoes into bite size pieces and cooking longer on a lower heat.  Also, I substituted Goya Adobo seasoning for the salt and pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were good. I added season salt, garlic powder and rosemary. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese when the potatoes were almost done. I cooked them at 350 for about an hour.

My husband and I both LOVE these.. We have them at least once every 2 weeks! I add a little garlic powder to the mix before tossing the potatoes, and it gives them a little more flavor.

Wonderful, simple way to do potatos.  Additional spices could be added to liven it up.  Fantastic side dish, everyone loved it.  I did leave mine in the oven for about 15min longer than the recipe suggested.

It's a very easy recipe, but unless you have VERY SMALL potatoes, you will have to quarter, or bake for 40-45 minutes to get them done enough.

It was a hit with steak!

I should have checked after 20 minutes because 30 was too long.  Also, I have an electric range and I wonder if the fact that the element is above the stove bottom, whereas gas burns below, the pan should be placed on the second lowest level when using electric ranges.

I have used this several times.  Each time a little different, but all have been good.  I like to make mine a little more crispy so keep them in the oven 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Easy side dish for many main courses.

Made per recipe, but with baby Yukon gold potatoes.  Kids loved them...said they tasted like French fries!  Was tempted to season with Montreal Steak Seasoning as I do with roasted veggies, glad I kept them simple.

Pretty bland. I don't understand why people gave it great reviews after saying that they added all these spices that were not in the original recipe? Obviously the potatoes were bland. I cut my potatoes in eights. In addition to the olive oil, salt and pepper, I added minced garlic, minced dried onions, sprinkle of mestique, garlic powder, Thyme, and red pepper flakes. Some members suggested Rosemary. I tried it, but didn't like it. I'm really not a fan of Rosemary. With the much needed spices, it tasted good.

Great, simple recipe. I added some dried thyme to the mix. The high temperature is a must! The potatoes came out delicious and crunchy.

Great basic recipe. I also added garlic. leaving them in for the full time made them a bit mushier than how I like them.

I did not make any changes , they were good they way they are. I made them along with my meatloaf and some mixed vegetables.  Wifey and a good friend both really liked it. That's good enough for me.
Thank you for the recipe. 
Bubba.

Tasted good.  Did as others suggested, added some minced garlic and rosemary and cut into quarters.  Came out perfectly done.  Also, added onions and squash for the last 10 min. and it was perfect.

With just the 2 of us, I use our toaster oven for roasting. We typically eat one potato each and with a protein and vegetable,  we are satisfied.  I only need about 1Tablespoon of olive oil to cover with a couple of pinches of kosher salt and enough freshly ground black pepper to taste. I have added granulated CA style garlic powder (a couple of shakes) so far. My husband has declared that these are by far his favorite way to enjoy red potatoes. A definite keeper.

Absolutely delicious! As always, I look through the comments and ratings to see what others thought and how they adapted the recipe for themselves and I fully agree with several other posters to add the garlic, oregano, thyme and onion. However,  I personally would put the onions in for the last 15 minutes as I would’ve liked to have had them soften up a bit more. Everyone in my home loved it, all three of my boys, my husband and myself... and we can sometimes be a tough crowd.  I’ll definitely be making this again!

I originally made these for my mom, yeah,  me too.
No one, that has tried these, ever wants a baked potato  again after tasting these.
Be very liberal with olive oil, salt and pepper.

I never knew how easy it was to make fabulous roasted potatoes.  Before this recipe, my roasted potatoes were blah.  Putting the cut side of the potato face down and the very high cook temp made all the difference.

My dad was a chef at many restaurants so he was particularly gifted when it came to cooking, he used to make these when i lived with him. Easily one of my favorite things he made, their would be a bowl of them left and just saying by morning that bowl would he in the sink and I'd be full. Cold or hot these are amazing. Simple yet so good.

Easy and delicious decided to use a steak and chops seasoning; sea salt,place pepper,garlic, onion,green peppercorns,paprika,dried parsley. The potatoes tasted delicious, a bit crispy with a soft inside. Will definitely make these again.

The potatoes came out perfect the second time I tried this recipe. The first time I did it, I followed the direction to lower the oven rack and the potatoes came out burned.  The second time, I left the rack in the normal spot and the potatoes came out golden brown with a perfectly crispy outside and a tender inside. Definitely a favorite now that I’ve got the oven setting down.

I've made this recipe at least a half dozen times and it is always perfect. I would recommend using foil on the bottom of the cookie sheet for easier clean up. This recipe also makes perfect breakfast potatoes and the leftovers reheat well.

I mixed in some sweet potatoes and added additional seasonings, garlic powder, Italian herbs and applewood coarse salt. They were perfect. Definitely watch the time. They can easily get overdone.

Made this for Rosh Hashana dinner.  Absolutely delicious and super simple  and fast to make.  The potatoes came out so nice with just a little bit of a crispness to them.  The entire family loved them.  I didn’t change a thing.

Great recipe used Creamer potatoes gold and red diced up and mixed with all ingredients though I added diced parsley, parmesan cheese, and dried chopped onions towards the end of the bake to minimize burning.

Great original recipe !!! Don nderstand why people feel qualified enough to change every recipe on here! Simplicity in our food is the key to good health!  We don’t need to hear about pounds of garlic- Siracha- curry or spaghetti sauce and cheese!

Top notch! Super easy. Shows you don't have to add a laundry list of ingredients to make an excellent dish. Made this as written.  Potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Cooking time was spot on. Total keeper.

Simple recipe that works every time. Depending on the size of the cut pieces and the oven temperature will determine on how long to bake.Top off with green onions.

Love it!  I microwaved the cut potatoes for a couple of minutes to save time and used kosher salt. 450 temp. was perfect.  This will become a regular in our house.

Simple, easy roasted red/new potatoes. I quartered my potatoes before adding the spices as listed, then sprinkled some paprika over them. They were ready at just about the 30-minute mark. Soft and flavorful. My daughter even ate the skin! My husband asked for a bit more spice and kick for next time, but ate 2 servings anyway.

Made the potatoes as listed in recipe with only a little onion powder sprinkled on them. Lowest shelf at only 375 for 40 minutes because I had chicken on top oven shelf at same temperature.  All great and done nicely. So simple!  Loved it!

I made these and they were delicious!!  They were done in 20 minutes (my oven time warps). I used Livia’s Seasoning, Hungarian Paprika, Sunny Paris Seasoning, and a pinch of sea salt.

Simple, elegant and versatile.  We used some of the leftovers to make a potato taco without the taco :)

So unlike most of the other reviewers I made the recipe AS IS so you get an accurate review. I made the recipe last week and it was very basic and there wasn't a ton of flavor. To bring this to a 5 star for me when I made it last night I added fresh rosemary and a Tablespoon of minced garluc. It really brought out the flavor of the red potatoes and my husband really loved the changes I made the second time. Those are just a couple small changes I made to elevate the recipe.

By far the BEST roasted potatoes I’ve ever had! I have been looking for a good recipe for so long! I also add 2 cloves of minced/puréed garlic and sprinkle with lots of dried parsley. DELICIOUS! Mine are usually ready in about 20 minutes. 30 minutes made them a little too burnt to my taste.

Shocked at how easy and rewarding this recipe is! This was a huge hit with my three young kids and husband. I've made it with different types of potatoes. I do prefer cutting them into smaller chunks. It will be hard to try other recipes for potatoes because this one is just so good!

I have an old roasted red potato recipe at lower temp w lots of seasoning that I liked. My family/I like this one much better. Simple oil, salt & pepper and baking at higher temp is a better taste/texture. Made as written = fabulous

I give five stars for the basis of this recipe.  I thought it was too much oil after I mixed them together, but they were not oily at all when they were done. I added chopped fresh rosemary. I do because I love fresh rosemary!  Fabulous!

Perfectly cooked. I added some rosemary halfway through cooking (just decided late) and, when it was done, sprinkled some grated parmesan on top. I might add some garlic salt next time.

I've made this recipe about 4 times now and have experimented with different spices by adding or omit a few items each time (such as adding 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, parsley, onions, or garlic).    Overall the timing and temp. of the recipe are perfect for me,  but ovens may vary.  

Great morning, noon, and night as a perfect add on to any dish!

The roasted potato flavor really comes through! Delicious!  The potatoes came out crispy on the cut side. I will never try to make this on top of the stove again!  Baking is healthier and delicious.  I used the leftovers with a breakfast of ham and eggs.  I reheated them in the microwave.

Just that easy,  came out great.  I like my potatoes crispy so I left them in the oven a few extra minutes, then topped with chili and cheese!  So yummy!

This was such an easy recipe! It was easy and pretty fast. I had to add a little bit more oven cooking time but they were delicious. They were even better the next day reheat it. I'm thinking of making them for a dinner party now.

Great recipe I have made several times.  I have made it as is and also added garlic and various herbs.  My favorite is garlic and rosemary.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  It is great as is and flexible enough to accompany any dish with minimal tweaks.

I've made this a couple of times and it's great. I've made with both red potatoes and gold potatoes as well. I don't think I usually use that much oil. I just pour into a biggie with the salt, pepper and potatoes and toss before adding to the pan. I also preheat the pan in the hot oven before adding the potatoes. This is a keeper recipe for regular rotation. Just had with seared tuna and roasted asparagus. YUM!

Maybe I should have tossed them in olive oil again after roasting or roasting at a lower temp.  I did add rosemary.  My husband loved them but I thought they were a tad dry.  I will make again though!

Sliced the potatoes instead of chunking them. I did out them in a gallon zipper bag but then tossed them in a bowl. They stuck together in the bag and wanted to season them all well. Going to make again and try dry hidden valley ranch mix as a seasoning. Saw another recipe that used onion soup mix.

Honestly, the recipe is hard to mess up, but it was very yummy!! I added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, sugar and Mrs. Dash Table Blend in addition to the salt and pepper, then topped off with parsley flakes.

Such a simple recipe yet so much flavour. We both agreed that these are a keeper. The only change that I made was to use avocado oil, I seldom use olive oil any longer. Great advice to check them after 20 mins. as mine were done at 23mins. Thanks for sharing.

I used a Silpat on top of the jelly roll pan, and it helped the potatoes get nicely crunchy, while making clean up SO much easier. Also I use varying flavors of Mrs. Dash seasoning for the herbs. Mixes up the flavor nicely!

delish, I followed others advice in which I added fresh minced garlic (3 cloves) and fresh parsley in the pan  and then I added 1/2 sweet yellow onion sliced 10 minutes before taking out of the oven. I would suggest adding the onions before than because I had to keep them in the oven longer than the stated 30 minutes to get the onions to the right consistency.  I also cut them into quarters instead of halves....But they were delish and so easy to make.  Cant go wrong with that!!!

I followed the directions. Mixed olive oil, salt and pepper, to coat potatoes in bowl, then arranged them face down on cookie sheet. Ran the oven at 450 degrees.

Within 10 minutes my oven was smoking like crazy, even with vents on, and my fire alarm went off.

I admit, I am new to cooking, but there just weren't that many steps to screw up. 

In my opinion, the olive oil simply can't be heated to 450 degrees safely. Anyone else have an opinion on where I went wrong?

Great base recipe! I've made these many times. Depending on the meal they are accompanying I add seasonings accordingly. We love garlic so that is usually an addition. I've used fresh parsley, oregano, lemon and cilantro, not all at once and depending on my mood. This is one you can be creative with. Spice it up or down and I've seen it dappled with sour cream or topped with ketchup. Any way you like them, they are hard to mess up.

Simple to make and super yummy. Made these for my family and they loved them. I was not sure of the type of red potatoes the recipe called for; I used petite blushing pink and they were perfect. I will definitely make these again.

These come out perfect every time. Crispy and soooo good. The problem I have had in the past was that the potatoes would come out soggy. No this time.

Made pulled pork with these potatoes last night...quite a hit with the family. My only addition to the recipe was to sprinkle the potatoes with parmesan cheese before baking. I will definitely make them again.

I don't know what I did wrong. they cooked well enough, but were super bland. Super boring. I even added extra spices. They smelled so good cooking and smell so good sitting next to me. But they are super dry, a little burnt on the edges, and taste like I'm just eating a plain potato. :(

Followed directions to a T...but they didn't look like the photo...baked for 5 minutes longer and still not browned on cut sides.  Flipped the potatoes over and placed under broiler to brown cut sides.

Love these!  I used red potatoes (not baby red potatoes) and diced them.  I used sea salt, rosemary, onion flakes, and pepper for seasoning.  Tossed them in the olive oil.  Baked as directed.  The family loves them!  I have made these several times.

Everyone loved this recipe.   I quartered the potatoes and tossed them in salt,  pepper and garlic.  It took about 20 minutes at 450°.  I will be using this simple recipe again with other spices.

Super easy recipe that my kids love! I did use regular red potatoes so I cut my potatoes smaller as well as sea salt. To serve I sprinkled with dried parsley. These could be modified easily for personal taste but I keep them "plain".

Great basic recipe. I tossed bite size pieces of red potatoes with olive oil, minced onion, Italien seasoning, salt, and pepper. 
Also followed the tip and lined the baking sheet with tin foil. Glad I did, it did stick. 
Fiancé thought it was great.

These were an instant hit with the family!  I have used italian seasoning, rosemary, and basil the three times I've made them.  They taste equally delicious!  Making them again today for Father's Day!!

I made these potatoes as a side dish. My husband and I loved this recipe. The only changes I  made was add a few dashes of garlic powder. Highly recommended!

I followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes came out beautifully golden brown and delicious!  I just sprinkled some oregano and thyme over them before placing them in the oven.  I will use this recipe again for sure!

PERFECT ROASTED POTATOES!  My family loves roasted potatoes .   And I have made them over the years but had to keep a watchful eye as they cooked in a high  temperature  oven.  I  never thought to place the rack on the lowest level in the oven. The potatoes turned out perfect, beautifully browned on the outside and soft on the inside. Mystery solved...Thank you!

We LOVE these!  Cut them small for the crunchy edges. I added some garlic salt to make it my own but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe — cut baby red potatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper. I added a sprinkling of dried rosemary.  My husband and I love these well done, but if you prefer nicely browned, check the potatoes at 20 minutes.
This is a great side dish to a pork tenderloin, since they're both ready in about the same amount of time (with a double oven).

This was so good!! I adjusted the recipe to serve just me and my husband tonight. I cut my golfball size red potatoes in half and set the temp on my  countertop convection oven for 425 since I also wanted to put my tilapia in the oven on the top rack so everything would be done at the same time. I did add a few extras to the recipe.....besides the salt and pepper I added Lawry's season salt, some garlic powder and some slices of onion and orange and green bell pepper. I tossed it all in a gallon zip bag with EVOO and put it all on a small cookie sheet. Everything was done in about 20 minutes with everything nice and crispy super tasty. And the house still smells amazing. We really loved these and will make them often.

Made these today. The temperature and timing were spot on.  However, the seasonings would have been extremely bland if had not read the reviews already listed. They desperately need thyme, garlic, and some natures seasoning to boot. I also added some dots of butter towards the end.

After 20 minutes, the bottom portion of the potatoes was almost burnt. I tried one, mushy on the inside (but trending towards dry) and crusty on the outside. After 5 more minutes I took them all out. They were decent but I expected more from it. Still have some more left: will try to experiment by adding garlic.

Very tasty and easy. I used two pounds small red potatoes because I thought three was too much. Still used the same amount of oil, salt and pepper. Also added fresh chopped rosemary and fresh parsley. Will definitely make again!

I used the little tiny potatos that are popular now. Put in a pan, added olive oil and minced garlic, S&P, and roasted until soft. Served with Baked Dijon Salmon from this site and had myself a delicious healthy dinner!

Right texture. Not spicy.  I like em angry.  I sprinkled a few choice spices on them once I flipped the potatoes halfway through the suggested cooking time.

Stirred the potatoes halfway through the baking process so that they were browned on multiple sides. My husband loved these! I made extra so we could have them as breakfast potatoes the next morning. Just reheated in the pan that was cooking sausage.

These were delicious.  I quartered the potatoes,.  Put potatoes in a zip-lock bag and added olive oil, kosher salt, Lawry's Seasoned Pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  Lined a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil and sprayed it with Pam.  Baked on bottom rack at 425 degrees for 30 minutes.   Easy, easy.  Will certainly make many more times.

Love these!!  But, I did make substitutions and additions: baby yellow Dutch potatoes (instead of red), added thyme and Garlic Garlic (from Pampered Chef) to my seasonings. They have the crisp of a French fry without the added fat from being deep-fried. I will certainly make these my go-to potato choice. ??

Very nice.  I was in a rush so I microwaved the potatoes (¾lb for two people) for two minutes.  I was baking chicken for 30 minutes at 350, put the potatoes on the low rack in the oven.  I also sprinkled a little rosemary on them before baking.  They were excellent.  Only 179 calories

Good and basic new potatoes. It can be dressed up however one wishes- I added garlic powder this time, but I can also see adding Italian seasoning or a cajun mix.

just perfect - stuck to pan a bit, but easy to remove. It took less than 30 minutes - ready when I checked it at 20 minutes. I used a selection of different mini-potatoes - blue, red, yellow all tasted and cooked great

Fantastic!  Made recipe "as is", only I had to use Kosher salt (all I had) and since my potatoes were quite large, I cut them in quarters like wedges.  Otherwise followed exactly.  My kids HATE potatoes of any kind, but they gobbled these up and raved about how good they are  -- crunchy and salty on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Top notch reviews from all three adults and two picky kids!

Sprinkled garlic salt instead of plain salt and they came out perfect!! So easy! Just throw in the oven and forget about it. Definitely splurge for the small new potatoes...it is well worth it. Delicious!!

Easy, simple recipe that turned out delicious. I baked them for about 50 minutes because I have something else in the over that required 350 degrees. Thanks Pam

I'll definitely make these time and time again. I microwaved for about a minute before putting them in the oven then baked for about 40 minutes at 425 degrees. Turned out delicious!

I used salt and pepper but that wasn't enough  flavor. I used seasoned salt and it was wonderful! Will definitely make it again. Also needed to cook them about 10 extra mins but that's probably because my potatoes were a little larger than they needed to be.

This was a perfect recipe.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika along with the salt and pepper. I did not have the red potatoes. So  I used regular potatoes and left the skin on and cut them in 1 by 1 inch pieces.  They cooked beautifully in a convection oven at 430 degrees for 25 minutes.  They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

This is a simple, easy recipe that leaves room to changes and additions. I use what ever variety of potatoes I have, red, russet, fingerling.. and depending on how big are the dices I adjust the cooking time, by checking the doneness  after the 1st 20 minutes and every 5 minutes after that. My oven run on the hotter side, so I keep the temperature at 425.
I also sprinkle sometimes some garlic powder or  dried herbs like rosemary or thyme for more flavor.

I made this with to accompany my lamb shoulder, with squash and zucchini medley and it was great as a side dish! I added Italian seasoning, seasoned salt, garlic powder and parsley for more flavor. I like when they are tender but brown and crispy to perfection. Great recipe!

These were so easy and so delicious.  I am not much of a potato lover, but both my husband and I absolutely loved these.  I used the entire bag of potatoes and put them in the freezer so we can pop them in the toaster oven when we want them again.

Awesome recipe for basic potatoes. I added fresh garlic, lemon pepper and used sea salt. So yummy! I cooked them for 20, checked them, and cooked an additional 9 minutes.

These turned out really well. The 450 degree temp is the key. I also tossed some carrots in there and they baked very well along with the potatoes. Be sure to coat with oil so they don't dry out and shrivel up. Will make again, over and over.

Good start but bland. For more flavor, sprinkle with chopped rosemary. For a kick, add cayenne.

Not enough flavor even after adding Thyme and crushed garlic along with lavender vinegar (which none of these ingredients were even in the original recipe). Adding more salt is what saved this dish.

I added onion segments about 5 min after the potatoes.  Added fresh herbs too (Oregano, Thyme, and Rosemary).  450 for 20 minutes almost wasn't long enough, I let it go a few more minutes to crisp up longer.

Super easy and delicious! I added a little bit of thyme to mine! I would recommend lining the pan with foil because I did have a problem with the potatoes sticking. Either that or make sure you use a nonstick pan.

Great recipe. My potatoes were smaller and a variety bag; I cut them into easy bite sized pieces. Needed to bake with the meat, so I did these at 375 degrees for 45 minutes on the lower rack and it was perfect. I turned them twice to brown more sides. I'm sure they're great as the recipe calls for too. I added dried rosemary after tasting and wanting an herby look/taste. Will make again!

I made a few changes but it came out so extremely yummy in the end! Used salted butter instead of oil. And cooked them for 20 mins on 250 C. Thank you for the simple yet very fabulous recipe. I would have added a photo but they were all gone before I could take a pic. :p

Been making this for years try oil and dry onion soup mix.  If you have a smoker 45 min. or until tinder on a foil lined pan that will fit smoker. I smoke@ 275. Have also made potato salad this way....VERY GOOD.

BEST POTATOES EVER!!!  Made almost as directed (added a few ingredients.  Used parchment paper on my pan to avoid burning.  I used the top rack of the oven, (always do for roasted veggies, it gives a better crisping/browning) for 60 minutes.  Crispy and delicious.  In addition to the salt & pepper I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on the potatoes, and when they were done I sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese.  Forget the entree, I made a meal of the potatoes. Thanks for a great side dish recipe.

Began preparing this easy recipe about two months ago and my husband loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly but decided to add a quartered onion the last time which enchanced the flavor of the potatoes. With or without the onions, these potatoes are a five!

I make these often with any kind of peeled potato cut or quartered.  I place in bowl with olive oil, salt, pepper and minced dried garlic, mix and place on cookie sheet.  It really doesn't matter what temp the oven is, and depending on when you want them ready to eat, just adjust oven temp.  

I roast on one side, then flip over to brown on the other.  Never had a failed roasted potato done this way.

I recommend that you chop your Red Potatoes into smaller pieces and use a Flavored Olive Oil.  I also added Chopped Brussels Sprouts, too.  You just need to keep an eye on, and turn these, every 10 minutes.  I cooked mine for 20 minutes, but would recommend 25 minutes for optimum doneness.

Love this recipe. We cut them into little chunks. (About 1/2 inch) and coat in garlic salt, pepper and olive oil. Sometimes adding smoked paprika, and into the oven on sprayed foil in a baking sheet. Comes put awesome every time. We have them almost every week!

Excellent!!! Simple and tasty. My whole family enjoyed these potatoes. I added some fresh parsley because I had some on hand and went heavy on the freshly ground black pepper. Makes an amazing flavor with the crispy potatoes. Next time I'll add some fresh garlic. Thanks for the recipe.

Following these directions, these are so good. So tender on the inside with scrumptious crispy edges on the outside and just under half an hour.

Simple and too the point. I did not have any Olive oil so I used canola. I like spicy so I added a dash of orange habanero powder. They cooked about 5 min too long, but still taste great.

Temperature/time too much... Many were burned. Or maybe rack too low. Will raise it higher next time.

So good.  Simple but delicious.  I used Yukon Gold new potatoes because that is what I had and we ate them all.  I am making again tonight. Yum!!!

I followed the tip of nuking the potatoes for 2 min before tossing them into the oven - then baking half the time. Was perfection!!

Super Easy! Loved it. I used kosher salt, and fresh garlic, and I was an easy family hit. Mine took about 45 min in the oven.

Great standard recipe.  I mean, how can you mess this one up?  Sprinkle with some parsley (maybe even parmesan) and you have a super easy side dish.

These are delicious. I also added a pinch of garlic salt to them. While they were cooking I was concerned the potatoes were going to be dry, but they turned out perfect. Overall, very good recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

I liked the technique and enjoyed these more than cubed and roasted.  The family prefers cubed and roasted because there is more crunch.

Awesome! Can't get more taste for less effort. I added dried thyme and garlic powder in with the salt and pepper, as other reviewers suggested. I did throw in some onion during the last 10 minutes of cooking, though my onions probably could have afforded to go a bit longer. I will definitely make this again--one of the easiest, fool proof side dishes around.

Very good.  I only had a few red potatoes, so had to cut the recipe, but it turned out really good.  Like so many others, I added ingredients for my own personal taste.  I added fresh garlic (the kind in the squeezable bottle). I did not measure, just used what seemed right,  and a touch of parmesan cheese when I pulled them from the oven.   I did cut my new potatoes in fourths & cooked in a 350 oven.  A great keeper.  Will definitely make again.

These were awesome!  I prepared them exactly as the recipe said, but I added garlic powder with the seasoning.  They were perfectly tender and absolutely delicious.  My husband and son mashed theirs with a fork and added butter and cheese to theirs and loved it.  My daughter and I just ate them exactly how they came out and we loved them too.  This is a definite saver in my recipe box.  These cook up in almost the same time as any kind of boxed processed potatoes.  For just a couple extra minutes, the family gets fresh, non processed real food.  Winner!

This recipe is fantastic! I was shocked at how much flavor was on each bite!  I too cut the potatoes into smaller pieces so the yummyness could get on more bites and added a little fresh garlic.  The temp. was perfect and I left them in for about 38-40 minutes but watched them and turned the pan they were on just to make sure all sides got cooked evenly.  Sooooo delicious! :) One of the best dishes I've ever cooked and probably the most simple.  You can't beat that!

This is the second potato recipe I have used and it is great. My husband likes his potatoes a little crispy. This recipe was good at letting me know about the higher temp. Thank you

Perfect! So easy and so good! I even had some seasoning rub left over from the pork tenderloin that I cooked with the potatoes. Dipped the cut end into the rub, roasted the potatoes according to the recipe and they were really yummy.

Perfect! I used basil infused olive oil and the whole family loved them for our beautiful Easter dinner.  Of course there are many changes you can make: size of potato chunks, oil, salt or spices but it is great just the way it is.  I did line my pan with foil so I had an easy clean up too.

Very good and easy.  I added rosemary and garlic.  Do be certain to heed the directions about putting the potatoes on the lowest rack of the oven.  The temperature is perfect.

Really good. Placing cut side down makes them more crispy. I cut each potato into fourths or smaller and equal in size so they cook evenly. Also delicious with dried garlic and rosemary seasoning

Amazing!  Easiest potato recipe ever.  I normally roast my potatoes in a bunch of garlic and oregano.  This time, I followed the recipe to a T, and worried that they would be too bland... I was soooo wrong.  They were great!  I made a homemade honey mustard dressing for the salad, and me and my boyfriend were dipping these potatoes in them, and they were incredible!  Easy, and carefree.  Mine took exactly 30 minutes in a 450 degree oven, and turned out fluffy on the inside, and a tad crunchy on the outside.  JUST AMAZING!!

Very good basic roasted potato recipe.  I did what it had, but used kosher salt, pepper, and a couple cloves of minced garlic.  I then added a pampered chef rosemary herb seasoning with it.  I also tossed it with a few shakes of Parmesan cheese, and it was fantastic.  MANY fans in this house!

This was very VERY easy and tasty.  The whole family ate it up.  There were just a few minor changes I made however.  I didn't have new potatoes, just Yukon gold.  And the roasting dried them out the last time, so I actually parboiled them, skin on for about 20 minutes.  After this, I remove the skin by hand, and then pass through a ricer.  After this I like to use a Tamis (French Sieve) and scrape them through into a wooden bowl.  Using one and a half sticks of precut, cold butter, I stir it in, letting the hot potatoes melt the butter.  After that I add some scalding milk to bring the temperature back up.  I typically place the wooden bowl into some warm water, just up to the halfway point, to keep them warm, but not mushy until serving.  Its really great.  Thanks!!

Delicious, I cooked them 30 minutes but next time I will cook them less so they are not as dry. I also added spices like other reviewer suggested and they were awesome. Spices I added: red crushed pepper, garlic and oregano. 1/2 teaspoon each :)

Really, just the perfect way to cook potatoes for a side. The right amount of spices, cook time, and crunch! Wouldn't change a thing. Well, maybe more garlic, but I could put more garlic on anything.

This is a great recipe.  Prepared as written.  My 7 year old requested that I put the leftovers in his lunch bag tomorrow.  This is going to be my "go to" red potato recipe.  Simple and delicious.

These are good. I used new potatoes, but not red. I cut them a little too small, they were pretty crispy but still good! Next time I'll add more salt.

These potatoes were so delicious and easy!  They were perfect.  I added some sliced onions, fresh rosemary, and fresh parsley.

Delish!  A very close version of California Chicken Cafe's roasted potatoes.  A big hit with a family of picky eaters :)  Will be making it again and again.  Thanks for this super easy recipe.

Very easy and delicious. I just added a little bit of minced garlic. I used a big ziplock bag to toss the potatoes with the ingredients and also put foil on the bottom of the pan. Worked very well. I will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious! The potatoes are lightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the indside. I added a few cloves of chopped garlic and Italian seasoning with the salt and pepper. The olive oil helped it stick nicely. The red potatoes I used were a bit larger, so I quartered them and turned after about 15 or 20 minutes.

Our family really liked them. The girls are 5 and 8 and both gave them a thumbs up.  We cooked them much longer than the recipe called for and the potatoes came out nice and crispy the way we like them.

Very easy and tastes wonderful!  My husband loved this.  Instead of salt and pepper, I used season salt to give the potatoes a little different taste.  I will definitely make this in the future.

These potatoes were divine.  They couldn't have been easier to make and were absolutely delicious.  I made as is and I think adding extra ingredients defeats the purpose.  The olive oil, salt and pepper bring out the flavor of the potato.  It enhances not covers.  I made this with Mediterranean Stuffed Chicken (also listed on allrecipes and delicious) and green beans.  Will add this to my regular side dishes.

It's hard to go wrong with these little red potatoes.  I love that they cook so much faster than Russet or Idahos.

Fabulous and SIMPLE potato dish. My (slight) variation was just to add Ms. Dash italian medley. I swear I don't work for Ms dash!! Just a nice mix of oregano and various other "Italian" spices. And well the first time I ever ate this was at my Italian extended families house, so it just seems right.

I had friends over and didn't want to make hashbrowns for breakfast so decided to go this route.  Definately and easy dish to fix and I love that.  I've made this dish for about a year but I've always used a skillet, but the oven is alot easier.  Made these again, & hubby says these are the best next to homefried tators.  I may try to add onions next time.   Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! These are so easy and so tasty that I will be making them again quite often. As other readers have suggested, I added rosemary and parsley which I think are essential ingredients. These tasted better than similar potatoes served in 5 star restaurants that I have had. My family couldn't get enough of them and I thought that I would have leftovers from the 3 lb. bag! I baked them a little longer than 30 minutes to be sure that they were tender enough. This is by far one of the best recipes on this site. Thank you so much for turning ordinary potatoes into an easy gourmet dish. Based on my family's reaction, I will be doubling this recipe the next time I make it.

Ok -- these came out really good.  Only change we made was instead of simply salt and pepper to season -- we used sea salt and a six-pepper spice blend... gave the potatoes a really nice kick, thanks for sharing this!

These are very simple to make as stated.  There isn't a whole lot of flavor but it is delicious.  Might be best to serve it with something that has bold flavor.

This is the second time I've made these potatoes, and they have been excellent both times. My 15-year-old was skeptical at first . . . couldn't believe there wasn't some "funky spice or something" on them. She tried them anyway and loved them, along with the rest of the family. I followed the recipe as written.

Fabulous!  Even my picky children loved them.  And they usually only eat potatoes in the form of french fries.

The only thing I changed was I used regular potatoes because I didn't have red potatoes on hand. My husband and daughter were fighting over the very last potato. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.  It's was a HUGE hit in our house and we'll be making these often.

So good.  I hasten the roasting time by boiling my potatoes for about 10-15 minutes.  This was a last minute side for the steaks with bleu cheese. I originally was going to make sweet potato fries but they went bad so I decided to make these.  I also added a little bit of melted butter just before they were done and tossed them with a tiny bit more of salt.  I could easily eat the entire tray .  Thanks for sharing.

So good and easy to make!  My "I hate the potato skin" kids even ate seconds!  This will make the rotation again...they even asked to have these instead of hash browns for breakfast every Sunday.  Thanks for posting!

I used new white potatoes and they were great.  My husband is a fanatic for french fries and he loves these. These are much healthier than fries.

I've been making these potatoes for months now and I still love them. What I love most about them is how easy they are. I follow the exact directions of the recipe every time I make them and they come out perfect. They're crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and I think after you make them once you'll realize how amazing these potatoes go with nearly any recipe!

The basic roasted red potato - just what i was looking for!! I baked them on a lower temp because i was cooking baked chicken at the same time (Baked Garlic Parmesan Chicken from this site - yummy!!!) they were softer and not so crispy, but i liked them that way!!

Good stuff right here!  I enjoy simple recipes and this is just that!  It took no time at all to prepare the potatoes and my company loved them.  I left them in a little longer than it says to, just because I wanted them to have extra crispy edges.  Otherwise, don't change a thing!  It's great as/is!

I thought these were great.  Followed others suggestions to add garlic and spice.  I only added minced garlic and some minced onion, since I was serving with the Roast Leg of Lamb with Rosemary from this site.  Otherwise, I would have added rosemary too.  They were gobbled up.

Very good and so easy.  I think you can reduce the oil to save cals.  Loved how they browned...I always wondered how to make good roasted red potatoes and I'm glad I found this recipe!  Feel free to add other spices.

Very good!  I didn't add the garlic like others suggested because I didn't read the suggestions until after I had them in the oven...I definitely think that would have added alot more flavor!  I will do that next time!

This was good. I cut each of the red potatoes into six pieces, more like a breakfast potato. It's a good addition to one of those breakfast for dinner days. There wasn't a ton of flavor, though, and the skin turned out soggy.

I polled the family for their opinions on these and they gave it a 3.  Personally, I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I found the potatoes to be bland even though I added additional seasonings.  They were also done way sooner than 30 mins (about 15 for me).  I might try these again if I jazz them up a little more.

these potatoes were simple but good, i will keep this recipe. I took some advice and used a zip lock baggy to shake up potatoes and i added some seasoning salt and garlic to the mix. However i felt it was too much garlic and will use garlic powder next time instead.

Five stars for ease, taste and texture.  Like many other reviewers, my potatoes were a little large so I quartered them.  Added garlic powder, onion powder and a little oregano.  Shared with my in-laws, and they really liked them.

Really good.  Followed the directions except for cutting the larger new potatos in quarters. Used garlic salt instead of sea salt.  Served along side Garlic Chicken from this site!

THESE ROASTED POTATOES ARE THE GREATEST. I HAVE TRIED OTHERS AND FOUND THEM TOO MUSHY, NOT CRISPY. THESE WENT OVER SO WELL. EVEN MY COUSIN, WHO ONLY EATS FRENCH FRIES HAD A SECOND HELPING.

Nice and 'creamy' texture inside; don't know any other word to describe it; was quite nice.  Had the oven up high as mentioned; and the potatoes were golden; but it wasn't as crisp on the outside as I was expecting; but still; quite nice.  Will likely make this again...

I followed the recipe exactly and my potatoes turned out mushy on the inside. Tasty, but a little disappointing. If I make again, I will use regular sized red potatoes and cut them in quarters.

Please try this recipe with Olive Oil, sea salt, pepper, and .... ROSEMARY... fresh chopped rosemary - it's absolutely perfect this way. It's hard to look at another potato after that.

What a tasty way to eat your veggies. 
I did the potatoes and added 1 green bell, 1 onion, and a whole bulb of garlic. In addition to s and p, I also added ground rosemary, and parsley. Yum
Thanks for a really great tasting recipe!

Don't even bother with other roasted potato recipes, this one is IT!  Simple ingredients make for a simple, yet incredibly satisfying dish.  This tastes as though you've gone through much more trouble than you actually did.  One of my family's favorites!  Fabulous!

Potatoes turned out brown and crisp on the bottom - perfect. For a change could toss with rosemary or italian seasoning.

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the kind of potatoes I used.  I did not have any red-skinned or yukon gold, so I just used regular old Russet potaoes and sliced them pretty thick.  They were a hit and I will definately cook again.

Just finished having these for dinner.  The potatoes looked beautiful and were cooked perfectly but I was hoping for more flavor. If I make this again, I'll try adding some other herbs into the mix.

These potatoes are great! The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because I think you have to add some balsamic vinegar to this & some fresh rosemary. Otherwise, everything about it was good. These make a wonderful side for  almost any main dish protein. Thanks!

Perfect side dish with almost anything, and I didn't have to buy anything extra. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I used canola oil instead of olive oil. Served them with Sylvia's Ribs from this site, and they were a perfect hit. My granddaughter dipped them into FF Ranch dressing, and asked how soon I would be making them again. This recipe will go on my list of favorites.

I believe these potatoes benefited from the garlic/onion powders I added into the mix.

These potatoes are VERY easy to make and turn out great! I also added dried rosemary for some extra flavor and for appearance.
