I made these by hand since my bread machine was broken. I warmed up the milk, water and butter in the pan  and then added it to a bowl with the yeast where i let it stand for 10 minutes. I then added the flour, eggs and salt  all at the same time, unlike other reviewers I didn't think there was too much liquid, I was able to turn the dough out and kneed with maybe 1/4 cup of flour just to keep my hands coated. i left in a cold oven over night and baked the next day for 18 minutes, they were wonderful and I have made them many times since, great each time. Thank you for the recipe.

This is Stephanie.  Thank you for all the nice comments! HALVE THE RECIPE for bread machines or it will overflow. I wanted to clarify: warm milk, water & butter (I use the microwave), add egg(s), flour, yeast, sugar & salt to machine.  Brush melted butter over dough, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, raisins/nuts (optional). I cut the rolls with dental floss (wrap floss around roll, tie pulling floss so it slices the dough as you make a knot).  Now, I only bake them for 18-20 minutes. I've never measured milk for the frosting, I just add a little at a time until it's a nice spreading consistency. UPDATE I use brown sugar for the filling now because we prefer them gooey.

I have had great luck freezing before raising or baking.  Then, when I am ready to eat them, I put them in the oven on warm to thaw and rise.  When they have risen enough I bake as usual.  They're wonderful.

I did 1/2 of the recipe.  It fit in my bread machine perfectly and made one dozen, large and yummy rolls.  Using the bread machine makes this recipe so easy.  I refrigerated the rolls overnight and baked in the morning for a quick and easy breakfast that the entire family loved.

These cinnamon rolls were wonderful! I don’t always have the best luck with yeast so this is the trick I’ve learned…in a measuring cup I heated ½ cup of the water and stirred in 2 Tbs. yeast and ½ tsp of sugar. I covered it with a small plate to allow it to foam. When it’s foamed up about 2 inches or more I use it, but it will continue to foam if you leave it and should only take about 5 minutes to begin foaming. While the yeast was sitting, I heated the butter, milk and only ½ cup of the water (minus the ½ cup for the yeast). I don’t have a bread machine, so I did it the old fashioned way…by hand! I mixed together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, & salt) and then added the butter mixture, yeast (foam and all), and eggs. I mixed it well and had to add quite a bit of extra flour while kneading. I greased a bowl, covered it, and put it in a warm place to rise. After about an hour it was ready for step #2 in the recipe. Hope this helps with the yeast problems. I added extra cinnamon-sugar and sprinkled extra cinnamon on. Yum! The extra cinnamon was perfect for us; not too sweet, but sweet enough. The rolls were light and so soft. This recipe wasn’t too difficult and gave me delicious results. Thanks for the post Stephanie!

These rolls are great.  They are light and fluffy.  I liked them better than "Clone of Cinnabon" because they are not as gooey and the dough is easier to work and form.  Next time I'm going to add some brown sugar with the cinnamon.

Tried this recipe, might not have used the right size bread machine.  Used 2lbs. bread pan in machine and the recipe did not work, way too much dough for the machine to handle, cut it in half for the bread machine, dough came out extremely gooey, had to use lots of flour.  Not as good as I thought it would be according to the other raters.

This is the first time I have ever made cinnamon rolls from scratch, and now my husband will never let me buy the ready to bake rolls again.  I had to add a little more flour also.  Great recipe!

Everybody just loves these rolls. When I make them I take a day and make 6-8 dozen to share with friends and neighbors. They are always a hit.

These are probably the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had! First time I followed the directions and they were great.  Made three more batches this week with the following changes. I used 1 cup of milk, added 1 tsp vanilla to the milk, 2T soft butter and 1 egg to my bread maker, then 3c of all purpose flour, 1/4 c white sugar, 3/4 tsp salt. and 2 1/2 tsp of instant yeast. Then followed directions for sweet dough cycle of bread machine. When it was done, I turned onto floured board and rolled into a rectangle.  For the "swirl" I used 1/2 c of brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 3 T. melted butter, I added 1 cup of raisins that I put in a bowl of hot water and microwaved  for about 30 seconds to plump them. I brushed the dough with melted butter and sprinkled with the cin/sug. Rolled tightly and with super sharp knife I cut in half and then into 12 rolls. Placed 6 each in greased round cake pans, covered one with plastic and put in fridge, the second into the freezer.  The first pan did an overnite rise, and in the morning I took it out and while oven was preheating I let it rise a bit more.  These are melt in your mouth good.    Please note, with the original recipe these are still the best I have ever had, so the changes aren't necessary for superb rolls.  It's just fun to tweak this a bit to make it mine, just as many of you will tweak it to make it yours.  Either way, you have got to make these! Your family will proclaim you Queen of the Kitchen (or King)

Light,fluffy, and buttery! I don't have a bread machine, so I made with my mixer and hands and they still came out delicious!I made half of the recipe..Mixed 1/4 cup warm water + 1 tsp sugar + 2 tsp dry yeast and set aside. Melted butter + warm milk in micro(45 sec) then added egg, sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, & water in mixer. After yeast grew, added to mixer. Combined flour + salt, then added slowly to mixer. Dough was very sticky but with enough flour for dusting, i kneaded for 5 minutes by hand. Then placed dough in greased bowl, covered with damp towel and let sit in warm place for 1 hour. Then I followed the rest of the directions in the recipe. I will definitely make this again! A winner!

I'm having difficulty rating these cinnamon rolls. I wouldn't say they were disgusting or a failure, but they weren't great either. They were unfortunately a little dry. I feel bad for saying that, but it's true. I wish they were soft just like other cinnamon rolls I've tasted. I wasn't impressed by the dough. I had no problem making the dough. I followed the directions as stated. I added a bit more cinnamon because I love it and I added a half white sugar and half brown sugar. I think brown sugar definitely makes the cinnamon rolls taste much better so it's a shame this recipe didn't call for it. I like this recipe because it's VERY simple, but if you want a cinnamon roll recipe that will WOW you and your family/friends, pick another one. Also for the frosting, before I added the melted butter, I tasted it and it was quite good without it. Once I added the melted butter, I couldn't taste that much of a difference so if I make this again, I won't add the melted butter. I won't add more calories than I need to.

given the fact that this was my first ever crack at using a bread machine,i follwed recipe to the letter..the dough was very sticky in the final stage of rising so i added another cup of flour and was much more elastic in the end.other than that this was very simple and delish :)

Absolutely spectacular. I generally use 1 to 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans instead of the walnuts and raisins. These are best when eaten fresh, and will not be nearly as good when eaten hours later. Also, in order to make an entire pan full of the "center one," cut a strip of dough after it is rolled out and line the outer edge of the pan with it. Place the rolls as you usually would, and discard the sacrificial dough after baking.

Best and easiest cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried...They always turn out perfect and everyone loves them.  I've made them dozens of times and have been asked for the recipe by most everyone who tries them.  I only make half the recipe as this is all that will fit in my breadmaker.  They are so good!

I tried these cinnamon buns and they were out of this world good. I did change them some what. Instead of using white sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar 2 tsp of cinnamon and 3 tbsp of corn syrup and some walnut pieces can we say caramel buns yummy .I also halved the recipe and it was plenty. I will use this recipe for quite a while.

this was the 1st time that i have ever made cinnamon rolls from scratch. the recipe was easy to follow and turned out really well. the only problem was that the next day the rolls were sort of dry. i am sure that if you store them properly they would not be dry. great tasting!!

THESE WERE SO GOOD!!! EXCEPT I LEFT OUT THE RAISANS AND THREW IN CHOCOLATE CHIPS ALONG WITH PECANS ( WAS ALL OUT OF WALNUTS) I ALSO COATED THEM IN A BATTER OF BROWN SUGAR, MELTED BUTTER AND NUTS BEFORE I PUT THEM IN THE OVEN. OMG 10 TIMES BETTER THAN CINNABONS. I TOOK ONE BITE AND I WAS LIKE " CINNABON WHO"???

These are the best rolls I have ever made. People even offer money for me to make them. Everybody begs for them. I cut recipe in half though so bread machine can handle it. For a different taste add fresh orange zest in middle with cinnamon, sugar, and butter. These are to die for.

Stephanie:  Thank you for posting this recipe!  These cinnamon rolls are delicious; I've tried several recipes and this one was easy to make and tasted wonderful!  Since my 1.5 lb. bread machine will not handle 6 cups of flour, I halved the recipe, but I may have to make a full batch by hand next time, because 12 rolls isn't enough!  I think the melted butter in the frosting really makes these rolls a lot richer, and professional quality....most other rolls are made with a thinner glaze of water or milk and powdered sugar.  This frosting is delicious!  If you love cinnamon rolls, try this recipe---you won't be disappointed!

For the first time ever, I made cinnamon rolls and this recipe was so easy, they turned out perfectly. My family devoured them in one day and my eight year old even bragged to the neighbors!! I will cherish this recipe and pass this one down to my children!!!

I love cinnamon rolls & wanted to have a go at making my own.  I browsed lots of recipes & decided this one was THE one. I was VERY pleased!  They were delicious!  I took in some of the other reviews & opted to use part brown sugar & part white sugar, and it was delicious.  Also, I love cinnamon, so I hiked up the amount of cinnamon I used, which only made it tastier to me! :)  Great job!

I thought these were really good and I am now making the second batch for my husband to take to work tomorrow. The only thing I had to change was the amount of flour. I always use bread flour and keep an eye on the kneading and it was way too sticky with 3 cups of flour. Ended up adding about 1/2 cup more. I disagree on the freezing. I put 2 cinnamon rolls in bags and froze, a week later they were just as good.

This is a great recipe. I used bread flour because I was out of regular flour and they turned out really good. I freeze them, then bag and vacumn seal them. When we want them for breakfast I take them out of the vacumn bag (they're all "squished"), then I put them in a styrofoam tortillia warmer, microwave them for a minute or so and they puff back up. Then I put the topping on. They taste like they just came out of the oven.

My family and I really loved the final product with this recipe.  I did run into some confusion with the directions, but it looks like Stephanie clarifies that below.  Also, I goofed and didn't half the recipe for my bread machine.  Most machines can only handle about 3 cups of flour.  OOPS!  Overall, I loved the recipe and will make it again.

I made this last night and was very impressed with the recipe. The recipe was easy to follow and my kids enjoyed the rolls the next morning.  I doubled the icing and left out the raisins. the rolls were a hit.

Once again, I made these cinnamon rolls for Christmas morning.  In fact, I was TOLD that I HAD to make them.  The dough turned out a little wet this year...not sure why.  Although they weren't beautiful, they sure did taste good, and the family scarfed them down.  The recipe is too big for my bread machine, but I just watch it during the rising process, and take it out when it gets too high.   My family is hooked on these, and I spend every Christmas Eve making them.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

These rolls were good right out of the over, but became too chewy after they cooked off. Was ok, but don't think I will make again.

Very good and very simple.  I thought the topping needed more liquid just to stir together so I added more milk & vanilla to the frosting and thinned it out a bit.  I didn't have any difficulties with the liquid to dry ingredients and I made a full batch in the bread machine easily without halving.  I think it depends on your bread machine capacity-mine can handle 12 cups.  These riser well and I got huge cinnamon rolls.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were good - I had a tough day getting dough to rise (made two dough recipes) but that isn't a fault of the recipe. I unfortunately cooked them a tad more than they needed, again not a fault of the recipe. My youngest son and I still really liked them, oldest son & DH thought they were so-so but I will try this again :) the frosting was quite good!

I am beside myself with giddiness right now.  lol  I have never in my life made a yeast bread.  I've always been too scared.  They seemed SO intimidating.  I made these today because cinnamon rolls are my hubby's favorite, but I didn't tell him I was doing it because I was honestly afraid they would be an epic fail on my part.  They just came out of the oven 15 minutes ago and I frosted them.  Just had my first bite.  Heaven!  They are simply some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  They are SO light and airy and they nearly melt in your mouth.  I cannot wait for DH to get off work and get home to surprise him with them.  I will NEVER ever go back to premade or tube cinnamon rolls after this.  These are literally 10-15 minutes of hands on time is all.  And the rest is done by the bread machine!  I can't thank you enough for posting this recipe!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I honestly cannot imagine anyone giving this recipe less than 5 stars.  I did double the cinnamon-sugar filling and added quite a bit of extra cinnamon (our personal preference in CRs) and I doubled the icing.  Again, just our personal preference.  These are simply fantastic!!! TY TY TY!

Although the finished product of this recipe was amazing, I did have a few small issues along the way. I don't know if it's just because I made these by hand (without a bread machine), but I had to add A LOT of extra flour to make this dough manageable... at least a 1 1/2 cups. I didn't have enough white sugar for the filling, so I used half white and half dark brown sugar, though I thought most cinnamon roll recipes called for brown sugar anyway. I found that I didn't need quite as much butter (the butter that is spread on the dough before the sugar) as the recipe called for. Also, the amount of cinnamon seems like way too little, so I doubled it and the cinnamon content came out perfect. The only other issue I had was that some of the butter/sugar leaked out of the rolls while cooking and candied in the pan so the bottoms of some of my rolls were kind of hard, but still good. I only had to bake mine for 15 minutes before they were perfect, and they were soooo good. I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the small modifications I had to make.

EDIT: I just thought I'd let everyone know, if you're having problems with the sugar crystallizing on the bottom of your rolls like I did... then try just mixing the butter/cinnamon/sugar together before spreading it on the dough, instead of smearing the butter on the dough first and then sprinkling on the spices.

This was about the easiest recipe ever! Just throw the ingredients in the bread machine and let it do the work for you!  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and used chopped pecans (did not have any walnuts) and they turned out FANTASTIC! My husband and son gobbled them in one day (only made a 1/2 batch). Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  The only problem I had was the baking time/temp is too much.  Either don't bake as long (no more than 15 minutes) or reduce oven temp.

Made these a couple times w/o a bread machine and they turned out somewhat dense. Reading baking tips suggest more fat or sugar (or both), so I may try that. Also, frosting is a bit tricky - the frosting was runny so I reduced it - then there was not enough to spread on 2 doz.

These cinnamon rolls have a great texture.  Easy to make since the breadmaker does most of it.  I read in earlier reviews some people want to cut the rolls before rolling - a easy way to cut the rolls is to take dental floss and make a loop around the dough and pinch it off that way - the rolls stay in perfect shape.

I have friends & family who BEG for these cinnamon rolls! They're so easy and good! For a new twist, I mix orange juice (instead of milk) with the powdered sugar for the frosting. You can also use vanilla extract to add more flavor! My husband is the biggest fan of these - he thinks they're better then Cinnabon!

This is my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls. Seriously, these are SO good, and SO easy, it's ridiculous. My mom has an amazing family recipe, but I've forsaken hers and I'll only ever make these now - they're the best, easiest cinnamon rolls ever. I've made them probably 15 times in the past month, because they're always gone the same day I make them (: The only thing I ever change is sometimes adding a little cardamom to the dough (family obsession with cardamom).
Also, I make a vegan version sometimes, with Ener-G Egg Replacer and Earth Balance in place of butter. They're by far the best vegan food I've ever had (:

My husband, who LOVES cinnamon rolls, says these are the best cinnamon rolls he has ever had, better than Cinnabon.  I followed the recipe for the most part, omitting the raisins.  When it came time to put the butter, cinnamon sugar, and nuts on the dough, I did not measure.  I used softened butter and made sure everything was covered with a thin film of butter.  I covered the butter with a layer of cinnamon sugar that was not super thick, but enough so you couldn't see the dough.  Finally, I sprinkled pecans on liberally.  I used the icing recipe given here, but made two recipes so the rolls would be liberally covered with icing.  They were absolutely delicious!!  Thank you, Stephanie, for sharing your recipe.  It is going into my favorite recipes folder!!!

OOh Stephanie, when I put on 30 pounds it is your doing!!!!  Seriously though, these rolls are wonderful.  Due to the size of my bakeware I have been using 2x 8" square tins and making 9 rolls in each, so when I eat 2 I'm not being so naughty. I also find that they freeze well after baking and I just pop them in the microwave to warm and freshen when I want them. Thank you very much for this recipe.

I love love LOVE this recipe, I am 8 months pregnant and its one of my faves...one of my tips is I add a tsp or so of cinnamon to the bread machine along with all other ingredients, double the cinnamon sugar and also add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the icing as well between myself and DH and the kids..these MAY last over night...and that's providing I don't get up and eat them myself

These rolls were very easy to make and I made it exactly has the recipe said to.  Next time I might make just a couple of changes.  In the filling I think I'll use brown sugar instead of white and add more cinnamon.  I wanted to serve these for breakfast for our guests, but I didn't want to get up super early. So I made them a couple days in advance and after I rolled them up and sliced them I put them in a baking pan and put them in the freezer.  The night before I made them I pulled them out of the freezer and let them thaw and rise over night.  It turned out perfectly!  I will make these again for the next time we have guests come visit!

As others mentioned, there is way, way too much liquid.  The bread machine just spun it around and around.  It took at least another 1/2 - 1 cup of flour (I halved the recipe) to get the dough ball I expected.  
Like others I found that about 15 minutes was a much better bake time.

I also went with brown sugar instead of white for the filling.  Next time, I'll probably add more cinnamon.  The rolls just didn't seem to be very cinnamonny.

Taste, texture (with added flour) etc were just fine.

I made this without a bread machine, and they turned out incredible. Of all the times I have made cinnamon rolls, this is the first time i can honestly say they were "professional." Look no further, this is the recipe you want.

I am not much of a baker, but I tried these cinnamon rolls and they are easy and delicious! Making the dough in the bread maker is a snap, no mess to clean up and the end result is yummy rolls that don't stand around very long. (I also added a couple tbsp. of brown sugar to the filling, made it a little stickier, very good!)

Best cinnamon rolls I've ever made, and I make them all the time! I have always made the recipe that is in my bread machine cookbook, and they always turned out pretty good. But I made these because we happened to be at our Inlaws' for the weekend and I didn't have my recipe handy. These turned out far better than what I normally make. They were light, fluffy, soft and delicious. This is a keeper.

My cinnamon rolls turns put to be awesome. I don't have the bread machine, cause I'm studying abroad and why would a Medical student need a bread machine for, haha, so I did the dough manually. Made a few adjustments based on reviews. I warm up the butter and milk. Add 1/2 tsp of sugar to 1 package of yeast and 1/2 cup of warm water and cover it up, leave it for 10 minutes. This is my very first time of doing it, and it surprised me on how the yeast bubbled up. Awesome. I substitute the white sugar with brown sugar, sprinkled the dough with grated chocolate bar and it still turns out great. All my friends are loving it and I'm so gonna make some back home in Malaysia. Thanks! :)

First of all, I followed the instructions to a T. Although I have a good bread machine and used good quality ingredients, the dough came out terribly tough. I proceeded with the recipe. Smeared the butter. Sprinkled the cinnamon sugar. Rolled them up. Cut them up. Etc. 

Once they came out of the oven, I was very disappointed to see that they looked nothing like the picture! They had unwound and barely "grew". The sugar/butter mixture melted all over the place, creating a sticky mess.

Still determined to be an optimist, I tried one. The dough is tough and hard. The cinnamon sugar is so sticky that it is still stuck to my teeth. I wasn't impressed with the glaze either. I even tried grating some orange zest into it to redeem it. No help.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it came out horribly. I am very disappointed and will not make it again!

Wonderful, quick recipe for cinnamon rolls.   I let them rise for an hour vs. 30 minutes (only because I couldn't get to them) and I used rapid rise yeast.   They doubled nicely in size.   Only thing I would reinforce recommending as others here have is to put a cookie sheet under your pan.  I put all the rolls in one pan and didn't think I needed a tray underneath, but hence the sugar boiled all over my stove.    The rolls were ooey, gooey and yummy and were great the next day as well.   Will make this again.

I just made these today. Followed the exact recipe. They are the best I have ever made. Very easy recipe. Outstanding!! Will be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Do you mind if I ask where the recipe originated? Just curious. Also I used this frosting: 3 oz. cream cheese, 3tbsp butter, 1&1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2tsp.vanilla, 1/8tsp.salt, little bit of milk, combine all ingredients.  EXCELLENT!!

OMG! These were by far the best cinnamon roll I have ever made or eaten. The recipe does not yield many but is so very satisfying and leaves you yearning for more. Easy to follow recipe, methods and does not need to be redone or upgraded in any way unless adding more of the finished product.

Really great recipe , 1st time I made it was short some all purpose flour so I ended up useing half bread flour instead and accidentally used only a 1/4 oz yeast .They came out even better  and now still make them with the recipe changes . Also used a butter icing to top them .  Butter icing  2 cups powder sugar  1/4 cup magerine  1 tablespoon raw vanilla  2-3 tables spoons milk depending on desired consisitency   mix until whipped

This had a wonderful & well-received outcome. I used half bread flour & half AP (1 1/2 c. of each) as well as half brown sugar & half white (1/6 c. of each). I'm a cinnamon junkie so I used 3 tsp. it was perfect! I also added pecans (instead of walnuts) & raisins to sections of the roll so I had 4 varieties within the dozen (plain, raisin, pecan raisin & just pecan). Lastly, I used a whole tsp.of vanilla for the frosting & just added milk until I liked the consistency. I had to run out so I left them in the first rise (in the breadmachine) for over an 1.5hrs so it rose up the top of the machine - & punched down perfectly. While the dough rises UP the 1st ride it spreads OUT the 2nd rise. They're done when you see a steady golden brown across the whole pan. They were HEAVENLY & a hit with my picky culinary family:) Enjoy!

My husband loved these much more than the ones that take me 3 hours to make by hand!! Quick and easy....get your filling and topping ingredients all laid out and ready to go while the machine is doing the heavy duty work. I made 1/2 with walnuts, half without. I covered the rolls with a damp towel while they were rising. I have also used soy milk in this recipe with great results.

These were easy to make and I appreciated having the bread machine do all the work (kneading etc).  I let the dough rise overnight since I didnt want to bake them until the morning. They were easy and delicious. THe kids loved them (*without raisins and nuts of course!*).  THanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Amazing rolls!  I was afraid about all the dough fitting into my bread machine - based on other reviews - so I only made 1/2.  That was still plenty for my family of 3!  I guess I'm a lucky one though, because I could have easily fit it all into my machine.  Good to know for next time!  I still made the full amount of filling and I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I like my cinnamon rolls sweet, so I'd probably double the filling if I made the full amount of dough.  I let the dough rise for 2 hours and then stuck it in the fridge overnight and baked them the next morning.  They came out perfect and delicious!  I had no idea cinnamon rolls could be so easy!  Thanks for a fantasic recipe.

This is the first time that I tried baking something other than a cake and also the first time I ever tried any recipe from this website.I could not believe its going to be so easy and the results perfect.I have a stand mixer so things were pretty easy for me to make dough, but the recipe itself was so easy and quick to follow. As adviced on this forum I also let the Rolls rise for 2 hours and I also added a little more cinnamon then written here. I reduced the oven temperature from 350 F to 325 F for first 10 minutes then increased to 350 F for another 5-7 minutes. This helped the rolls to cook nicely from the inside without burning. My husband and friends just loved them.

Do not expect Cinnabon quality cinnamon rolls. I made it twice, the first time I tried to "slack" on the butter. And I definitely would not recommend that. I didn't slack on butter the second time, and while it was mcuh less heathful, it was much more tasty. Also, I groud my own fresh cinnamon, and it makes it much mor e flavorful and tasty.

This is an excellent recipe for cinnamon rolls.   I have made this recipe many times.  They can be made the night before and left in the frig to rise the second time...but the texture of finished product is not quite as good as it is when made right before baking them.  As I think is typical of most cinnamon rolls (?), these are only good for a few hours after they come out of the oven...but loose the nice fresh fluffyness after a while.  As one other reviewer said...they do not freeze well.  I don't use a bread machine...I assemble the dough 'old fashioned' way...it still works for me!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were gobbled up not by my family - but by my dog! When I set the rolls out to rise he ate the whole pan. But I was very pleased with them even without eating them! The dough was light and rose up well, and it was easy to work with. Next time when I bake these I'll set them someplace *high*. :)

I followed instructions as listed - in a 2 lb bread pan.  I watched carefully while the dough was on the last rise cycle, and yes- it did overflow the pan, but - it was ok since I was right there to punch it down.  I ended up adding about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour while turning the dough out onto parchment paper.  I then rolled out the dough into a large rectangle, making sure to flour well.  For the filling I went with 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugars - and probably at least 2 tbsps of cinnamon.  Rolled into a log, cut with a knife, put into a round pie pan lined with parchment paper.  Put them about 1/2 inch apart to allow for rising.  For easy rising, preheat your oven to its lowest setting while you are preparing your dough, then open the oven and allow some heat to escape (10 minutes or so) - then place your rolls in the oven and allow to rise got 30 minutes, then turn on oven to 350 - bake for about 20.  This made about 18 average sized rolls, I baked 9 - and froze the other half flat in a gallon zipper bag.  I feel that without the changes in spice to butter ratio - the cinnamon would not have been strong enough.  With the changes listed, they were amazing.  We attacked the pan out of the oven!  For the frosting, I just used 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp or so of vanilla extract (but I bet almond would be awesome too, or even orange!) and 1/4 cup of heavy cream (I was out of milk, and needed to use the cream up).

These are so good and so, so easy to make! Contrary to other reviews, I mixed the dough in my small 1 1/2 lb. bread machine and it worked just fine. Maybe it's because the pan is taller and narrower than most of the machines I've seen elsewhere?! I did end up adding the tiniest amount of flour towards the end of the cycle as it looked a bit sticky. I'm also vegan and was able to successfully substitute the animal ingredients with soy milk, Ener-G egg replacer and Earth Balance. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

WOW! These are delicious and very easy to make. I used a bread machine to do the dough. Decided since the kids are home for summer vacation I would make them something a little more special this morning. They were amazed at how good they were and they looked great too. I will be making these reguarly and probably for every holiday and family gathering as well. Thanks so much!

These were pretty good. They rose nicely overnight and even more when I placed them in a warm oven the next morning. After baking for 16 minutes, the tops were already brown and almost overdone. Next time, they need to be baked at about 350 degrees so they won't brown as quickly. I also think the filling needs to be doubled. Nice recipe, but Clone of a Cinnabon was better.

I made these using my kitchen aid dough hook. Once all the flour was incorperated I kneeded it for 5 min on a flour board and put aside in a bowl to let rise. I used dried cranberries rather than raisins and If I had an orange i would have used some zest as well. These Were great after I added extra cinnamon to the top when they were frosted (because they seemed mild). My kids were Delighted to wake up to these before school.  The rolls turned out perfectly! A new family favorite!

I was super nervous to try these being a cinnamon roll virgin but they were delectable! I only used about 1/2 cup of all purpose flour then subbed bread flour for the rest. I added an extra pinch of cinnamon to the dough while the bread machine was on. Doubled the amt of filling and melted the butter to brush it on. Mmmmm! I put them together to heat up on Christmas morning but they looked so good that we ended up having them for Christmas Eve dinner! My 4 yr old son deemed me best Mom EVER! These were fluffy and exactly what I wanted them to be. Can't wait to make them for my Mom when she comes to town.

The last comment on this recipe said to half it because it would expand out of the bread machine.  Not the case with me.  Half the recipe made enough to make 24 mini (and when I say mini, I mean it) buns, which were great for boys.  I would also double or triple the middle mix, not add the butter into it but instead melt it and brush it into the rolled dough and then sprinkle on your sugar/cinnamon mix.

These are the most delicious homemade buns ever! With a breadmaker to do the hard work, they are extremely easy to make, and they rise so beautifully! My family had finished them all off within a few hours, even my husband and 4 year old son loved them (which says a lot)! I followed what someone else had done, using one cup wholemeal flour, two white flour, 2 tbsp wheat germ and 1 tbsp ground flaxseeds. I used sultanas, walnuts and brown sugar for the filling. I didn't think they needed the icing/frosting because they were sweet enough already! This time I would like to try and freeze some before baking, so we can have them for breakfast one day, and don't have to eat them all at once! :P  Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe Stephanie! :)

These were fabulous!  Simple & quick.  Few minor alterations: 1c whole wheat flour, 2 white plus 2tb wheat gluten, 1tb ground flax & 2tb wheat germ.  I make it in my stand mixer, warmed the water, butter & milk to 120 degrees then added the yeast and let sit for 10mins.  Only used 2tbsp butter which was more then enough, and added a bit of brown sugar to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Let sit in the fridge over night and baked in the morning.  I was skeptical because they were so easy, but they were fantastic!  My husband who doesn't often prefer homemade over store bought  asked for more!!

I followed the dough part of this recipe exactly, I have given the recipe 4* as even though they are a wonderful tasty cinnamon roll, the dough is quite difficult to handle.  Once removed from the bread machine, had to kneed with quite a bit more flour to make it less sticky For the cinnamon center I did use brown sugar instead of white (Thought this was more traditional), rolled and cut the rolls, placed in the baking dish then I let rise for a further 30 minutes before coving with wrap and leaving in the fridge overnight.  Following morning I pulled the rolls out of the fridge and left on the counter for 45 minutes to bring to room temperature before baking.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I changed the filling a little bit.  I used brown sugar instead of the white sugar, and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and used lots of chopped pecans instead of walnuts.        These were relatively easy to make, and have to be some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted.

I've made these 3 weekends in a row.  Needless to say, my family loves them.  After the bread machine does its thing, I divide the dough in half and make a pan of dinner rolls and make the rest into cinnamon rolls.  We'll never go back to store bought again!

i craved cinnamon rolls, i even borrowed my mom's bread machine to make some, and had planned on making the 'clone of a cinnabon' ones, but after reading hundreds of reviews for those cinnamon rolls and reviews for other cinnamon rolls i finally decided on this recipe since most of the negative reviews had to do w/ the size of other's bread machines not being large enough ((which was EASILY fixed by just cutting the recipe in half)) not neccessarily with the quality of the recipe. also, i read the comment you posted about using brown sugar in the filling and only cooking them around 18-20 minutes, took your suggestions & they turned out wonderful! i didnt measure the milk for the icing since its the same recipe i use for frosting xmas cookies and i have never once measured any of the ingredients for it. the ONLY thing i added to this recipe was a splash of butter flavoring (along w/ the vanilla) to the frosting. so thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe! its one of the few recipes i plan on using over and over again.

This is a great recipe.  I got lazy this Christmas morning and instead of rolling out my traditional "cinnamon rolls for breakfast" I took kitchen scissors and clipped inch-square pieces off the dough into a buttered, sugar & cinnamon lined muffin tins and alternated sprinkling all the ingredients between the blobs of dough until the tins were full.  I let them rise a bit then baked.  We all liked these pull-apart rolls even better than the roll-out type we are used to and they were so much quicker and less messy to make.

I used to nanny for a family that LOVES cinnamon rolls. They would buy them from Costco almost every week. I made them a couple dozen of these one time and they went nuts! Never again did they buy cinnamon rolls, but they employed me to make them :)

These are super soft and doughy, with the perfect amount of cinnamon. They expand a lot, so I would recommend to not roll them SUPER tight, so that they don't end up bulging too much.

I have a regular size bread machine, but this recipe was too much, the dough actually raised out the bread pan.  I was able to clean it all up and then use the dough.  The rolls turned out Awesome!  I made them the night before.  Put one batch in the fridge and the other in the freezer.  Both turned out great; real hit.  I will be making this recipe again soon, but only half the size.

While these were very good cinnamon rolls, they are not the type that I prefer texture-wise. Not as "bready" as some. For those that like a lighter roll - this is for you.

These were delicous!!  Everyone in the family gobbled them up, so I have no idea if they freeze well or not (as the author advised)  My only word of caution, is that this is a lot of dough.  I have a  1 1/2 lb. bread machine, and it wasn't able to mix all the ingredients, so I had to get a rubber spatula and help.  But everything rose just fine, and they turned out wonderful, so I'll just cut the recipe in half next time so it will fit in my bread machine better.  And the icing for these is the best I've had!

MAKE SURE YOU HALF THE DOUGH RECIPE! Unless you have a bigger breadmaker. Otherwise, those rolls are EXCELLENT! I sub the white sugar for brown in the filling and put in probably little more then it asked for.

CAME OUT GREAT!!!! 
I didn't have a bread machine so I just made it by hand.  And they were wonderful.  Although they did indeed take about 3 hours to prepare.  Instead of using a bread machine I simply combined the warm water and milk with the Yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Then I Added the milk, butter and egg.  And added all the dry ingredients that I had mixed.  It is a little loose.  But you can kneed more flour into it.  Then I put it in a lightly greased bowl and let it set for 1 hour in a warm place.  Punched it down and followed the directions at step 2.   I also used Brown Sugar rather than white for spreading and used Pecans instead of walnuts.  It was a HUGE HIT.  Will DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN!!

These are very good cinnamon rolls. The only problem I ran into with this recipe was the lack of indication of just how large the rectangle should be when rolling out the dough. Other recipes say to roll the dough into a 9x12 rectangle. Mine was a good bit larger than this, but I think I'll go with this size in the future. I ended up with 17 cinnamon rolls that baked up nicely.

I made these without a bread machine and they came out great!!  I did add 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the filling and a little less cinnamon sugar.  I let the dough rise for 1.5 hours and then the 30 mins.  They are delicious!  My kids loved them!

Very delicious, my husband didn't like the "greasy" texture of store bought cinnamon rolls, so we tried this. I added a capful of vanilla extract instead and it came out very nice.

Great recipes. The only fallback is there was not enough sugar and cinnamon filling. I changed it to 2/3 cup brown sugar mixed with 2tsp. cinnamon.

I haven't eaten them yet so there's a possibility the rating could go up, but it's a slim possibility.  Followed the recipe exactly (although "very warm" is a bit ambiguous), used the dough cycle on my bread machine and found I had a gooey mess in the bread machine pan when the cycle was done.  I had to add at least 3/4 cup of flour just to be able to keep it off my hands enough to roll out.  I didn't want to work the dough too much since that will make them hard and dry.  I stopped adding flour too soon since rolling them was nearly impossible.  After mushing them into a roll (they wouldn't come off the counter) I cut them and dropped in a pan.  They immediately squashed back down into mush.  I'm curious to see if they even try to double in size and am preparing to make pancakes while I wait.  
I didn't need to make pancakes!!  They did rise, and they're certainly edible.  Not the best I've made but I'll try it again with some alterations.  They're a bit dry and the icing has little to no flavor.  DH says they're OK and he's always generous.  I'm tough on everything I cook and I'm not happy with these.  Objectively, a pain to get in as much flour as needed but the end result is middle of the road.

Great cinnamon bun recipe!  I made a few substitutions though.  For the bread dough, I subbed in 1 tbsp of safflower oil for the 2 tbsp of butter as well as added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I only spread 1 tbsp of butter on the dough after rolling.  For the sugar mix, I increased the cinnamon (because there wasn't enough for my taste) as well as upped the sugar by a small handful.  The bread was so light and moist!  :)

Flavor was good, the texture was a bit dry and crusty I thought.  After the reviews I was a bit disappointed as I expected something different, the felt kinda bread like and dry on the outside, not sure if it was a temp thing or maybe I should have put the buns touching each other when putting on the pan, i spaced them about an inch apart on the pan to make room for them to expand, they didn't quite expand that much.

I have been making cinnamon rolls for years, but I thought that I would try this recipe.  They were the BEST.  So soft and tender.  I halved the recipe and made in my bread machine.  My family loved them.  I will be using this recipe from now on.  These would be good with a cream cheese frosting too.  Yum.

This is first time I've made cinnamon rolls.  I followed the recipe to the "T," however, when mixing the dough, I found it to be too wet and sticky.  So I ended up adding at least another cup of flour to stop it from sticking to my hands, so that I could actually knead the dough. Overall, the result was great and my family couldn't stop eating them right out of the oven.  I also made cream cheese frosting instead, which made the rolls all the more mouthwatering.  Thanks.

I make this recipe for friends & family each year at Christmas. This year I had a disaster on my first attempt as I used "enriched" flour by mistake. When the breadmaker completed the dough cycle I had a thick soup rather than dough! I just started again with "all purpose" and the dough looks great. Hint: after putting the milk and water in the pan I removed 1 T, and I think the dough is going to be a lot easier to work.

These were pretty good! I wish i had been more knowledgeable before making them because i realized after mixing everything and measuring everything out that i needed to halve it for the bread machine. and then i used regular white sugar for the first batch before deciding it didn't taste very good and switched to brown sugar. i used a different icing- cream cheese frosting, and it was pretty good! I might make these again but i might find a different recipe.

These were wonderful and not too sweet. I made my in my bread machine and halved the recipe. I programmed the machine for 1.5lbs. It was a cinch. After preparing them I refrigerated overnight. In the morning I boiled enough water to fill a shallow pan 3/4 of the way and put it in the oven with the cinnamon rolls for 30 min. They really puffed up! In the end, they were delish! I only regret not putting raisins in them. And next time I might try brown sugar instead, but it was excellent as is. Thank you for posting!

I couldn't believe how easy these were.  And they turned out PERFECT!!  I was actually worried cause mine didn't seem to be rising like I thought they should, but they still turned out just right.  I even refridgerated half of them and made them a few days later... still... PERFECT!  I did however, use more brown sugar than I did white.. other than that, followed the recipe.  Too bad they aren't fat free, cause I could eat them every day!

Just brought these to Easter brunch - big success.  Only made a half batch (3 cups flour) and 2 of those I used whole wheat pastry flour.  Even though I cut the recipe in half, I used ALL the icing.  One half, right after they came out of the oven so it melted in, and then the last half over the top right before serving. OMG, these were freaking amazing.  Wonderful recipe, and so easy.

Fantastic!  And very, very easy.  My family and friends all love these.  I've done variations on this using almonds and an almond glaze, and cranberries with orange glaze.

I tried this recipe this Saturday, and I have to say if I put one of these cinnamon rolls on the top of my head, my tongue would have beat my brains out to get to it!  Sooooo good.  I did as another suggested and used the frosting from "A Clone of A Cinnabon" recipe.  Outstanding!  My husband said that it was the best thing he ever put into his mouth!

These rolls are sooooo good! I won't use another recipe for cinnamon rolls, I found these to be the best i've ever made. I drizzled on some icing (3/4cup icing sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp almond extract, milk) right out of the oven..mmmmm they don't last long in my house that's for sure!

These cinnamon rolls are very traditional in flavor, and very moist.  I loved the using the bread machine to do the dirty work of kneading the dough - very clever.  This recipe is four stars entirely because of the frosting. The more I am maturing in my taste preferences, the more I do not like the basic butter-confectioner sugar-vanilla-etc... type frosting.  This frosting is more suited to something like sugar cookies.  It's too sweet and lacks richness of flavor to me.  The roll itself is moist and fluffy but it tastes only slightly sweeter than a dinner roll because it is designed to have frosting.  You cannot leave off the frosting.  If you take the frosting away, or plan not to make the frosting, you will have to substitute it with something else to sufficiently flavor the rolls.  Whether it is glazing the tops with cinnamon-sugar, finding a good cream cheese frosting, or adding some vanilla and sugar to the dough, it really is designed to support a sweet topping as it is written, and it needs the extra flavoring.  It tastes bland on its own, even though it has cinnamon in the grooves.  I plan to experiment with other recipes, but if you like the kind of frosting this recipe entails, you will love these rolls.  They just aren't me.

The dough for this recipe was out of this world!! I have been looking for the perfect dough recipe and I know I've found it! Next time I make cinnamon buns I'm going to half the dough recipe (it was a little too much for my wee breadmaker).

These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made.
I made them for my Pastors of my church and they couldn't believe
I made them!  I made them with margarine, then I made them the
next time with real butter.  The ones with real butter turned out
much better than the ones with margarine.

These were great. I got a lot of compliments for these cinnamon rolls. They were very tasty and fluffy. My family couldn't stay out of them, all 24 rolls disappeared very quickly.

Great recipe but I vary the recipe by drizzling Karo Syrup over the dough before rolling up jelly roll style and also drizzling some more over them when they are in the pan. The Karo Syrup does wonders to them and all my friends say they are the best they have ever had.

I made a half-recipe in my bread machine, and it fit perfectly.  The dough was silky and easy to work with.  I made these on a humid day and added about a half cup of flour to get the texture I wanted.  I used both the raisins (softened in hot water and drained) and the nuts in the filling, and drizzled a tsp of honey over the filling before rolling it.  This made twelve small rolls, with excellent taste and texture.  I was disappointed with the size, thus the four stars, but these are really the size we need even though I love big, fluffy cinnamon rolls.

I found these to be very very dry and I even used more filling.  Not sure what went wrong, but I'm not very happy with the results.  I gave it 3 stars because the dough was good, but the rolls themselves left you needing to drink lots of coffee or milk. Very disappointing.

When I opened the bread machine, the dough was distressingly sticky.  It took quite a bit of extra flour to get it into workable condition, but I must say, the rolls baked up beautifully.  The texture was remarkably soft and light.

I used brown sugar for the filling instead of white sugar.  I also used half bread flour and half all purpose flour.  These came out nice and big.

I did NOT cut the recipe in half, and it worked just fine in my bread machine. I needed to add a bit of flour, as it was very sticky at first, but I constantly tweak my machine loaves so that wasn't an issue. I made apple-cinnamon twists with this recipe rather than cinnamon rolls, and it's working up great!

I have made other cinnamon rolls that are much better than this one, but this is still tasty- the thing that bothered me about it though is that there wasn't nearly enough filling or icing.  I only had enough icing for half of the buns and the filling wasn't gooey like a regular cinnamon bun. I would say double the filling and icing part and these will be really good.

I only use whole wheat flour for my recipes.  I think that's why my rolls didn't turn out as moist.  But, I will still give it five stars!

I tried to make this in my bread machine, it ended up creating a huge mess.  I didn't read all the reviews before I made this.  If this recipe is written for a bread machine, would you consider modifying it so people like me who don't always have time to read all the reviews wouldn't end up cleaning up the bread machine?  I couldn't finish making these since my dough was completely wet and messy.

I had to cut it in half and it was kinda sticky, but once I added more flour it was fine.  My family LOVED them.  Next time I make them I'm going to try with brown sugar like someone else suggested.  So YUMMY!

I made these today by hand and the whole family loved them, especially my 5 year old son!  We actually grow vanilla beans in the Daintree in north Queensland, Australia and we have our own range of vanilla sugars, one of which Vanilla Sugar & Cinnamon.  I used this for the filling, so as well as cinnamon, there was also a lovely vanilla flavour in the background - very nice!  I also drizzled a runny icing made of icing sugar, water and our ground vanilla powder instead of icing.  It was so easy, I will definitely be making these again, thank you!

Made these today.  Glad I read reviews and halved the recipe for my bread machine.  Everyone liked that they were light and airy.  Used brown sugar for filling and added cinnamon to the dough.  will add more flour next time, possibly up to 4 cups.  the dental floss hint worked great.  Thanks for the recipe an the reviews with hints.

Just finished eating one (2nd one in an hour!). They turned out really well.  However, when mixing (in my K.A. mixer), the dough was so wet and sticky it wouldn't form a ball on the dough hook even after adding more flour.  So I just dumped it out on some flour and added more until it looked about right (still a little more wet than it should be), then put in bowl to rise.  I was really surprised when it raised beautifully! Had no problem rolling into rolls. Baked in a 9X13 pan for 10 min @ 325, then another 9-10 min @ 350.  DELICIOUS!!  I did halve the recipe, by the way.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

These were great! I used the whole recipe but should have halfed it. My bread machine must be smaller. I had to help mix the top part because of so much dough. Even with that problem, they came out fine. Definitely saving this recipe!

These are great!  They are 5 stars with minor changes.  I cut the dough recipe in half b/c I have a 1-2 lb bread machine.  It would have been too much for my machine.  The submitter must have a larger bread machine.  Second, for the filling I used 1 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbs cinnamon and 1/3 cup melted butter.  I made the full amount of frosting, but added about a tsp of vanilla.  I softened the butter in the microwave.  After slicing them and putting them in a 9x13 glass baking dish, I put saran wrap over the dish and put it in the fridge until I was ready to bake.  It rose in the fridge, so I skipped the second rise.  I baked for 20 minutes, but put it in the oven as it preheated.  The rolls were slightly browned and a toothpick came out clean.  I then dumped them in another 9x13 dish so the sugar middle would slide back in.  I iced and served hot.  The leftovers went in the fridge.  YUM!!! Thanks for a great recipe.  I am glad I tried this one over the Clone of Cinnabon recipe after reading all the reviews.  These are better than store bought!!!

This had to be the best recipe I have ever tried with cinnamon rolls. Using the bread machine, it always turns out perfect. The dough is sweet but not too sweet. I will also make the dough, roll out small balls and freeze. I thaw them 6 at a time about an hour and a half before I plan on baking them and serve the rolls with honey-butter. YUM. The cinnamon rolls always reheat well the next day in the microwave, so these are A+ in my book.

My husband and mother proclaimed these "superb", a big compliment! I make 1/2 a recipe (12 is enough!) and use the filling from the Clone of a Cinnabun recipe on this site. Cool for five minutes upside down on a rack; turn them over and ice. Tasty!

my husband and I loved these rolls.  I have never been able to so any baking with yeast by hand.  I love my bread machine.  I made this recipe and did everything except put the icing on the rolls.  We don't care for things too sweet.  I made the whole batch then divided it up and put several portions in the freezer.  Now we just take it from the freeser to the microwave. They come out perfect.

This is the most moist, perfect rised cinnamon rolls recipe ever. This is what I do.. I use the dough and filing recipes from here. Leave out the nuts, and the icing recipe from cinnamon rolls III recipe. As long as you cut the dough recipe in half and frige it over night (I think over night doughs turns out the best), you will have amazing cinnamon rolls in the morning. I usually take them out of the frige and let them sit for 1 to 2 hours in room temp. I tried several other recipes in this site and other sites as well. they had 5 stars with at least 600 to more than 2000 reviews, but nothing quite as good as this recipe.

Halving this recipe makes the perfect amount in my bread machine.  I've had the best luck using mostly "All Trumps" bread flour, and a little whole wheat flour. For the filling, I use white and brown sugars, and extra butter.  Careful not to over-bake. Delicious!!

These were really good.  A lot of times cinnamon rolls aren't that sweet and just taste like white bread with frosting, but these were good even without frosting.  I did use brown sugar instead of white for the cinnamon mixture and it turned out delicious.

We only give it 4 stars because it didn't have enough cinnamon for our taste.  The dough was great, however.  Nice and tender, and browned well.  We did as others had suggested -- bake at 325 degrees F for 10 minutes, and then another 7 minutes at 350.  They were brown on the tops, baked through, and not overdone and dry.  We will definitely use the dough again (half-recipe -- 12 rolls is enough for us), though will continue to look for a filling.  Alton Brown had a good one for his Overnight Cinnamon Rolls.  Perhaps that will be the winning combination for us!

So yummy! I was nervous to make cinnamon rolls because my mother-in-law is famous for hers and I thought there was no way to compare, but my husband loved them! I'm going to make a cream cheese icing next time and cut the recipe in half- we ended up with about 19 cinnamon rolls for the two of us and as much as I love sweets, that's too much!

SO good....they are fun to make and the kids loved to help. I gave them each their own little piece of dough to play with and add stuff to. I added raisens to one side and walnuts to the other. I also used all brown sugar in the filling. YUM!!!

These are wonderful!  I can't tell you how many times I've used this recipe and they always turn out great.  I make these for breakfast everytime we have guests stay overnight, my way of spoiling them and they love it!  I took some to my husband's Coast Guard station today and they were gone by the time I left!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the rolls didn't rise. I don't have a bread machine so I had to make these by hand. The dough turned out well and they did taste nice after baking, but the didn't rise and they weren't soft or moist like other reviewers said. I was disappointed. Not sure where I went wrong. I guess my search for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe continues...

Wow! These are great cinnamon rolls and they are so easy to make.  Everyone in my family adores them and always asks for me to make them.  I added a bit more brown sugar and reduced the cooking time slightly, but otherwise, I followed the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

I was so looking forward to making these.  Maybe that's why I was so disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly using my bread machine.  I was concerned when it called for 2 cups of liquid.  Sure enough, my "dough" was all liquidy.  After an hour and 25 minutes and 6 cups of flour I had to ditch it.

Yummy! Making this in the bread maker made it so easy. I even put them in the oven before they had doubled in size and they came out great. Everyone was sad when they were gone!

I was a bit disappointed with these, especially after all the rave reviews! :( But it was a lot of work and didn't think they were that spectacular. And DEFINITELY not that good reheated! I had made them ahead of time & put in fridge night before as per a previous reviewer and in the morning the filling had all leaked out around each roll. Was nice for a change but, for me, it wasn't worth it.

These cinnamon rolls are awesome!  The only change I made was that I used brown sugar instead of white for the filling.  They are a bit time consuming but well worth it!  My family absolutely loved these!   Don't forget the icing, it is a must!  Thanks Stephanie for sharing!

Made a half batch and used my stand mixer. Turned out easy with a little flour. No raisins, used pecans.I liked them but would add more cinnamon and butter inside plus double the icing. Nice easy recipe with common ingredients.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and mine turned out PERFECT!  I used my bread machine and it worked out so well.  I will definitely be making these again.  Oh, I did double the icing recipe and used all of it...but that's personal preference, we like a lot of the icing.

Must quit making these!  OMG they are the best exactly as written!  My family thinks I'm an amazing cinnamon roll maker now all because of this recipe!  Made as is, no substitutions or changes!  Perfection!  **Update** Use "cream cheese frosting II" from this site and you have blue ribbon quality rolls!  My family cannot get enough of these!

Oh my Gosh!!!!!! These Cinnamon Rolls turned out excellent!!!!!!! I have made so many before and always turned out hard and dry!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a keeper. Since I have to serve Diabetics type 11 here I made some minor adjustments. I put 2 tablespoons of the splenda brown sugar into the dough and for the filling I used some splenda brown sugar and also some generic splenda. I opt out for the frosting for now until, I can find a sugar free one. If I could rate more than 5 it would be 100 stars! oh I also added 1 cap full of vanilla extract to the dough too. Had to add just a few drops of water to it. It depends on your weather. You want the dough just to be a little sticky. In the bread machine check it after five minutes of kneading, if it's tough add a little more water, if it's real sticky add a little more flour like a tablespoon at a time. Yes I did too sprinkle on the Cinnamon a lot more that was stated in the recipe! Just have fun with the filling! Mine worked out AWESOME! Oh one more thing, if you can't afford pecans, or don't want to get the nut topping in the baking section, thats what I used and you can't tell any difference. I also put the nuts sprinkled over the filling. I used a glass dish and buttered the bottom and sprinkled the nuts and then I put the rolls in! Wow, I could write a book on how great these cinnamon rolls are!

I halfed this recipe knowing my breadmachine couldn't handle 6 cups. (It can only cook two pounds max- and with three cups its up to the top of the machine.) Half still made plenty! I did sub one cup bread flour with whole wheat and added two tbs of flax meal to make it a little healthier. Tasted fine, but it cooked in 18 minutes since I made them smaller. First batch got browner than it should! I didn't like the frosting at all... next time I'll make a cream cheese frosting.

These are great. I spread butter and brown sugar on the bottom  of the pan as well as using in the buns. Never heard of using white sugar so brown it was as well as some Roger's Golden Syrup drizzled over the dough and the bottom of the pan. Makes them wonderfully gooey. No icing and no raisin either, just personal preference. Will definitely make these again.

My family enjoyed these cinnamon rolls, but they didn't have enough filling for us. Next time, I'd double the yummy stuff inside. (Also important to note: I halved the recipe. Otherwise the rising dough would have overtaken my bread machine.)

I tried this recipe twice. The first time, I should have known that this was too much for my 1.5 lb bread machine. 6 cups of flour? Can't do it. I had to throw everything away and start over. I cut the recipe in half, and had great results. I chopped up walnuts and sprinkled them on some of the rolls before baking. Wow, it was really good. I also used brown sugar vs white sugar for the filling. The next day they were still very good, when warmed up either in the oven or microwave. Very yummy!

This dough was very easy to work with and really tasty.  I, too, had to half the recipe for my bread machine...and that filled it up (I have a 2 lb. machine).  I did use King Arthur's cinnamon filling and this frosting.  Lovely weekend breakfast.

Delicious! The dough was a bit soft and hard to work with right out of the machine, but the finished result is fantastic. I sifted 1tsp cinnamon into the flour and substituted brown sugar for white in the filling. An oooey, gooey treat!

The bread is lighter than some cinnamon roll recipes I have tried which is really nice.  The only change I made was to use the filling from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe.  I took them to church for breakfast and everyone loved them.  This is my new cinnamon roll recipe.

This is a lovely soft bun. We like a gooier (is that a word?) filling. I guess closer to a sticky bun. I made a half recipe as there are only 3 of us. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I had originally started with a recipe for regular rolls and then decided on cinnamon rolls. This recipe was almost exactly like the roll recipe but with more sugar, so it adapted well to what I had already mixed up. So glad I decided to go with this recipe. Beware though, for those of you who have a regular old Breadman, this dough makes so much it pops the lid up at the end of the rising part. This makes a ton of rolls though and I guess it's not wise to freeze them, so next time I'll make a half batch, my thighs don't need to be tempted with that much gooey goodness. Great recipe!

I used the basic dough recipe to make monkey bread. I also used fast-action yeast, which worked fine. I divided the dough into balls, dipped in melted butter and rolled in cinnamon/sugar, let it rise overnight and wowed all my friends at our Christmas brunch. The dough is soft and just-right sweet. Awesome!

These are good in a light, fluffy kind of way. I usually make my mother-in-law's incredible sticky buns—got to remember to submit that recipe—so we like 'em gooey. Next time I make these, I'll make extra icing. 

The dough was a little wet, but I didn't mind that as it made it easier to roll out without a lot of tough gluten pulling it back. You just have to flour your rolling surface and the top of the dough fairly well. I also used quite a bit more than 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and, as another reviewer did, added a little almond flavoring to the icing. Yum!

I love how the filling isnt overpowered with tons and tons of brown sugar like the typical cinnamon roll. I'll be making this again for sure.

I decided to try these so I broke out the bread machine and they were fantastic.  This was my first time rolling out dough.  These cinnamon rolls were easy to make and great tasting.  My children are begging me to make them again!

Tried the recipe and everyone loved the results!!I loved the fact that the bread machine did most of the work and the results were fantastic. Especially for those of us that are yeast challenged. Kudos for you.

These cinnamon rolls are easy to make.  The cook time is too long though.  I took mine out after 15 minutes. I also added some almond extract with the vanilla in the frosting.  They were delicious!

This is an okay cinnamon roll recipe.  I didn't care much for the frosting, and the rolls were a bit too yeasty.  Also, the cook time was too long and too hot.  I took my rolls out after 15 minutes, and they were still very dark.  A really great cinnamon roll recipe from this site is Cinnamon Rolls III.  It is definitely to die for!

They went faster than just about any type of breakfast pastry I have EVER made!

Easy and quick. I used a kitchen aid mixer with a dough hook instead of a bread machine. Just let it go on speed 2 for about 12 minutes, when the dough looks smooth and elastic. Taste great!

Great recipe. I altered slightly using 1 cup of milk in the dough and substituting 1 cup of brown sugar for the filling. My bread maker has a   2 lb. loaf capacity so the amount worked fine. I baked mine in muffin tins and they were not just delicious but looked like they were professionally made.  If you add more flour than what is called for they will be drier. I use cooking spray to coat my board and rolling pin.  If you dust a small amount of flour onto the top of the rolled dough, they will easily cut without sticking to the knife. I use a serrated bread knife to cut them. If you use muffin tins, reduce baking time to 12 minutes.

This recipe sucks! The dough was absolutely horrid, it has a hard and rubbery texture. I recommend trying another cinnamon roll recipe. This one will make you feel as if you've just wasted three hours of your precious time. Absolutely horrid!

I tried 4 other cinnamon rolls recipes and this one is by far the best. the dough is very soft and pliable so you and get any shape you want and the syrup is over the top restaurant quality.

Loved these cinnamon rolls. I used 1 tsp ground cinnamon and didn't use the bread machine (mine was broken) but it turned out great. My four year old nephew was at my place who doesn't eat anything normally, and even he liked these a lot.

Update - so they rose and baked up really well, and I was very surprised. However, when you halve the recipe, don't halve the filling. It was too little for the finished rolls. I'm still not sure why the dough behaved like it did, but I'll make these again and just keep trying. 

Original Review: The jury is still out on these. I halved the recipe, as told, for my bread machine and the dough was so gooey. It basically poured out of the bread pan! I was able to salvage it into a basic rectangle, but it was nearly impossible to spread on softened butter and cut into rolls. The rolls are tiny, and they are currently on their second rise right now. We'll see what the finished product is like, but I'm not impressed thus far. 
This must have been human error, b/c of all the fantastic reviews, but I have no idea what I did wrong. I bake all the time, and never had results like this!

Too wet and sticky at the end of the bread machine cycle. I followed the directions to a T.
 I added a cup of flour to try to salvage them. I am convinced there are people who are cinnamon roll makers, they have special powers, sweet dough yeast 6th sense,... and I am not one of them. Soooo frustrating!

Instead of frosting the baked rolls, I placed some brown sugar and butter in the baking pan and the dough on top. After baking, turn out on a sheet of foil - voila! sticky buns! The best I've ever made. These are delicious!

I made this exactly as the recipe says. I think it turned out well. Other reviewers said it was too sticky and needed more flour. Mine came out of the bread machine perfectly. The frosting was pretty good, although I might use something different just for personal preference. The only negative thing I can say is that there is definitely not enough of the cinnamon sugar in the recipe. Next time I will double or triple it (it's no where near as dark as the picture shows). Overall, I enjoyed these rolls and they were very easy to make. I will look forward to making them again with the tweaks I mentioned.

yum!  I double the recipe for the cinnamon spread.  This makes a lot of rolls but that's never a problem because I roll them and freeze them.  They freeze very well.

This is a very good base recipe.  I made a batch this morning and the only complaint was 'not enough filling'.  I left out the nuts because that simply doesn't appeal to me and I wish I had at least doubled - or tripled - the cinnamon-sugar filling for a more 'cinnabon' type roll.  I think I will also use brown sugar next time.  That being said - the rolls are wonderfully soft and sweet and the icing is perfect.  I would highly recommend this recipe, just be prepared to make modifications for your personal taste.

These didn't do it for me.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose, so maybe that made a difference.  They were bread-like, very light textured, like a fluffy dinner roll. The filling was crunchy rather than gooey (i should have used more,probably).  I was hoping for a dense, chewy, moist, rich roll, and these weren't what I was after.  I'll keep looking.

This recipe is very easy to make.  It tastes wonderful.  I even had to use egg whites due to allergies and these came out wonderful.  As I am typing this review, my family is licking their fingers!

Made these the night before and let them rise in the fridge, didn't make the topping as would have been too much for us (Brits) they were delicous.  Definately a new family treat.

Absolutly wonderful cinnamon roll bread dough!  I didn't use the filling in the recipe, because I was unsure about the white sugar.  Instead I used the Clone of a Cinnabon filling (and doubled it since I needed it for 2 dozen rolls.  Also, baked at 350 degrees as recommended by other reviewers, and then iced with cream cheese frosting.

These are your typical yummy cinnamon rolls. I halved the recipe and still got 14 nice big rolls that I frosted using a mixture of powdered sugar, cinnamon, milk and vanilla. I like the currants in the dough, that was something I'd never used before. Thanks!

The first batch was good, but for some reason the second batch didn't rise after they were rolled out, and since I left them in the fridge overnight they ended up not cooking well either. I'll probably half the recipe if I make it again.

I also didn't have a bread mixer, so I just mixed it myself the ol' fashioned way.

Yummy, but they didn't rise very much. I think it's my fault since the fire in the oven went out halfway through their rising time and the kitchen wasn't that warm.

These were ok.  I used a break machine, and the cinnamon rolls came out very hard (not gooey) with very little flavor (needs more cinnamon/sugar).

Like a couple of people said in their reviews, TOO MUCH LIQUID!  Other wise they are absolutely wonderful.  Nice and fluffy and moist!  I ended up adding approximately another 1-1/4Cup of flour to the recipe and it turned out just as great.  Also, I mix approx. 1-1/4 Cup brown sugar to 1-1/2Cup of margarine and a couple of Tsp of cinnamon along with 2TBSP of corn syrup as the filling.  Basically mix it all up and spread it on.  Here comes Caramel buns!  These were a big hit on the last day of school where my son went to pre-K.  I made a double batch and brought them in for the parents as we were doing scrapbooking, as well as the teachers.  I had so many orders for them, it was crazy

My children loved these rolls but I wasn't too impressed.  The dough was very "bready" and the icing was lacking in flavor.  They were pretty easy to make though.  Next time I'll try a different recipe.

The bread machine makes this easy but the dough didn't rise as I would have liked. As a result the rolls were a bit too chewy but they tasted pretty good with a cream cheese icing.

I had to cut the recipe in half as my breadmaker doesn't hold 6 cups of flour, however in the end the first batch went so fast I ended up making a second for my daughter to take to work.
They were gone in  less than 10 minutes.  They are light and not to sweet.
Great recipe.  Best I have ever had or made

I used the dough recipe to make strawberry sweet rolls.  I substituted strawberry jam and butter for the cinnamon mixture.  They turned out wonderful.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe. Followed everything except I added more cinnamon and brown sugar before rolling them up. I also brushed on my glaze instead of the drizzle.

My grandsons loved helping me make these, and eat these.   I did not warm anything before putting it in the bread machine, just tossed it all in cold and turned it on. I used the bread flour I usually use in the machine . The rolls were light and delicious. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top of the frosting for sparkle but I will definitely add more cinnamon to the filling because I am sure we will make them again.  They didn't last long enough for a picture.

I love this recipe! Only thing I changed was added 1/2 cup flour, and I omit salt, due to my dietary restrictions. They turn out perfect every time, and taste as good as Cinnabon! Yummy!!

This makes a beautifully soft dough but it was just a tad too sweet for us.  I don't have a bread machine but this dough is easily made by hand.

I made this recipe with a few tweaks just because I didn't have all the right ingredients.  I was out of store bought milk, so I substituted 1/2 C Goat Milk made from Powder.   Growing up my Mom and Grandma always added Coconut to Cinnamon Rolls, so i added that.  I also used Brown Sugar in the filling.   I had some Sliced Almonds in the freezer that needed to be used so I used those.  
I made the dough in the bread machine and this is a really soft dough, so be sure to work it up as soon as your buzzer goes off, otherwise, it might overflow like mine did.    I rarely make Cinnamon Rolls up til now because by the next day the bread was always hard.  
This is by far the best dough I have ever made.  Making the rolls was so easy.  I will be making these more than i should I am afraid.  
They were so good that I didn't notice until the next morning that I forgot to put the Cinnamon in.  
They are were delicious

The dough fit fine in my 2 lb bread machine (granted it was touching the top by the end). The dough itself is great! Light and fluffy. The rolls themselves were eh. I used more cinnamon than was called for and after baking it looked like I hardly used any and I didn't taste it at all, just the vanilla in the frosting. Next time I would use brown sugar to help give this a cinnamon roll taste and texture. I may also use orange juice in the frosting to give a better taste.

I left out the walnuts. These were pretty good cinnamon rolls, but not the best recipe I've ever used. Simple if you're using a bread machine, but I guess I prefer the old fashioned way best.

Delicious cinnamon rolls. Neighbors all love it. One thing I found out. More butter on the dough does not make it better. All of the cinnamon runs down to the bottom of the pan with the extra butter and gets really Chrisp. My more is better philosophy backfired on me. I have made these 20 or 30 times. I now add a little extra milk and a little extra everything and I roll it out to 24 inches and make two pans out of it. I cut them in one inch sections they rise up nicely. Rolling the dough out thinner and making  24 does not make them quite as big but it does fill up the pan. This way they are not quite big so you don't feel as guilty eating one. This is a great recipe. It takes time but it is really easy and delicious. Enjoy it!

I used my bread machine.  Would only change the amount of cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and lower the cooking temp.  The buns lack a little flavor and browned to quickly even though I covered them with foil.

Very easy and VERY good.  This is the best cinnamon rolls/sticky buns I've ever made and super easy.  I added a little extra flour so the dough wasn't so sticky.  I also added extra sugar/cinnamon mixture before rolling and I sprinkled some on the top, plus I spread a little bit of maple syrup with the soft butter on the rolled out dough.  I put my cut buns in muffin tins to keep them individual which is how I buy them at a local bakery (these are much better, by the way).  The first time I made these I used all purpose flour, they we very good.  The second time I used bread flour and they were excellent and softer.  I'll continue to use bread flour.

Fabulous!

i have now made this recipe twice.  The first time, I had just bought my 1st bread maker about a week before I tried this recipe.  And it was super easy!  And super tasty!  Super light and fluffy.  The entire pan was gone with 20 minutes of it coming out of the oven.  Hubby, 2 sons and 1 grandson, made super short work out of the entire pan.  I didn't even get one!  lol

2nd time, just as good!  

I did not cut the recipe in half and my machine was no where near overflowing, but I do have a very large bread machine.   I've made recipes that call for 6 cups of flour and my machine handled it perfectly.

I made this for a breakfast pitch in at work.  Every crumb was devoured and the guys were fighting over the leftover sugar in the bottom of the pan.  Amazing.  I've tried it with cream cheese frosting, too.  I wish I could give it more stars!

I made no changes whatsoever, put it all in the breadmaker and let it do the kneading/first rise.   I cut mine far too big and made 7 huge rolls instead of 12 normal ones, but that just meant more yummy goodness in each serving.  If I ever would change anything, I might add a little more sugar to the dough to make it sweeter, but my husband says that's crazy as they are already very sweet, so maybe I would never change a thing.

My experience with dry activated yeast is it needs warmth and moisture to give it's all in the 'rise', so I used the water for the recipe and mixed in the yeast with that for 10 minutes (Until the mixture had plenty of bubbles in it showing the yeast was working).   The water needs to be hot, but only hot enough for your hand to be able to handle the temperature.

Apart from adding brown sugar to the cinnamon mix for the filling I did nothing else differently from the original recipe.   I have made cinnamon rolls many many times, in large quantities (Usually 80+ in each batch).   Honestly, this recipe is much much better, and I am saving this one for my personal collection. 

My bread mixer handled the full recipe with no problems, it is an Oster 2lbs machine.   Don't be afraid to try this from other reviews saying the machine cannot handle the full recipe, mine did fine.

Nice recipe, thank you.

So good! Easy and the dough has that yeasty flavor and stretchy quality to it. The only thing I did was double the frosting. They fit perfectly into a 9x13  glass pan if you cut them about 1 1/2 inches.

These turned out really great. I used the "gooey" cinnamon roll recipe on here last time and those were beyond delicious, but were SO unhealthy that we all felt guilty eating as many as we did. This recipe was a bit leaner so we decided to try it out. Contrary to some of the other reviews, I did not have an issue with my machine overflowing. I used my 2lb bread machine and everything fit perfectly. I used buttermilk instead of regular for the dough. I also adjusted the filling a bit by adding a couple tablespoons more of butter, brown sugar instead of white, and lots more cinnamon. My family thought these were great. I cut them a bit smaller and ended up with 20 rolls, so cooked them for only 15 minutes. We calculated each roll to be about 180 calories. Not too bad for something so yummy!!!

The dough is good.  I have a very small bread maker and put part of the flour in then added the rest as it moistened up. The dough tastes really great!  I also put 1 1/2 times the fillings because we like them gooey.

I made a change to the recipe by adding all the ingredients except the yeast into the baking pan, putting the yeast in the yeast dispenser, then running it on the dough mode. The dough came out perfect! I rtossed it and rolled it out , spread the filling (cinnamon, sugar, raisins, chopped walnuts) and then baked.

I made these rolls as-is, and they were perfect for the bread machine!  As suggested in one review, I added scant 1/4 c. flour.  (Note:  I cut the recipe in half the first time I made these--as suggested by several reviews, and they were not adequate for a 9 x 11 pan.  So, second time, I made as directed.)  They are a great textured, light cinnamon roll...esp from a bread machine!  I will most definitely make again.

It was frustrating to read all the reviews and start cutting the recipe in 1/2 and then realize it had been modified and was already halved from the original recipe.  They tasted great and were easy to make.

Best sweet rolls I ever made.I used a 2 1/2 pound bread machine and added about 1/3 cup more flour. Also doubled the amount of filling (no raisins or nuts) and doubled the icing.Beautiful soft dough and very fluffy when done.

Epic fail. I followed instructions, they came out really hard on the outside, Dry flavorless dough. They took a long time, made a big mess, and were not good. Not sure what went wrong.

I made these for Christmas morning the first time.  My mom said they were better than the ones she had the week before from a restaurant known around the world for their cinnamon rolls.  I make them up the night before, then bake in the morning.  Making them again tonight for the first day of school!

This recipe is perfect.  This is the fourth time I have made these rolls in the two weeks since I started and they never last a day, let alone a couple of hours!  In fact I am in the process of making some more right now as I speak.  I do not own a bread proofing machine so I just get all the dough ingredients together and do it the traditional way - I knead the dough by hand - usually takes 5-8 minutes until the dough looks smooth-ish and not so sticky to the hand. It's not that bad at all. Then I just leave the dough to rise in a bowl covered with a damp cloth for about an hour. My husband, who is a professional chef, loves them, my kids love them, My friends love them! Thank you for such a simple, workable recipe.  P.s.  I added two tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk and two teaspoons of vanilla essence - if you don't have vanilla extract, to the final icing, brought it to bubble for about 5 minutes then let it cool before dribbling on the rolls to obtain a more caramelised icing.

Love these! I make this treat on special occasions, such as Father's Day or Christmas. I had a similar recipe that I lost, but the dough is exactly the same. Never had a problem with the dough overflowing my bread maker, and I have an old 1.5 lb loaf type (with the vertical pan); I use bread flour though. My only gripe is that my old recipe had a very thick frosting, and this one turns out a little thinner (I was able to pour it) so I'll need to play with it to get the preferred consistency. I increased the icing recipe by half for just the right amount.

I use this recipe as written in my 2 lb bread machine.  It works perfectly.  Using dental floss to cut the dough into rolls keeps them nice and round.  My family LOVES this recipe -- since I started making it, they will not let me go a week without a batch!

Very solid recipe! I'm sharing a tip from another reviewer. If your house/climate is generally colder, it may take quite a bit longer for your rolls to rise. Try this...right before you start mixing your flour in to make the dough, turn your oven on to 200 degrees. Won't take long to reach temp. When it does, turn off the oven and DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!. When you have finished the rolls and they are in the covered pan waiting to rise, slip them into the oven. There should be enough residual heat to jump start the yeast and get the rising process jump started! If it takes longer than an hour, BE PATIENT, they will rise! I left mine for 50 minutes at room temp and then left them in the "still warm" oven for another 50 minutes and they were ready to go! Oh yeah, I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese to cut the fat a bit. Also added raisens to one half.

This dough fit fine in my 2# bread machine.  I did double the sugar/cinnamon recipe with half white and brown sugar.  After cutting the rolls and placing in a pan, I covered and refrigerated the rolls.  The next morning I removed them from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before placing them in a preheated oven.  Really good and so easy!!  When I make them again, I will also increase the sugar in the dough by at least a tablespoon.

Absolutely decadent.  You can taste the butter in every bite.  The reviewer who said it tastes "bready" must have omitted an ingredient or perhaps measured something wrong.
My bread machine fit one full batch just fine.  Used complete/full dough setting (not pizza dough).  It is a little sticky when initially removed from machine, but a light knead on a flour-dusted mat and it's perfect.  Made 12 generously-sized rolls.  Took 45 minutes for final rise (out of bread machine), not 30.  
Loved this recipe!

I was buying the frozen bread to make my cinnamon rolls before trying this recipe. It is just easier to make in the bread machine. My frozen bread recipe called for pouring 1/3 cup of cream over the rolls prior to putting into the oven to bake. It worked well on these also. Keeps them moist.

Well, I guess I won't be buying them anymore.  Using the bread machine takes half the work out of it and they were delicious. The only thing I did different was change the filling. I like using brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon to get that slightly sticky roll filling.
I made them the night before, let them rise, covered them and put them in the fridge. In the morning I took them out, let them sit a few so they weren't cold and then baked them .  They were perfect. The frosting is great too.

This was also the first time I have made cinnamon rolls from scratch, they rose, look very impressive so I had high hopes but but the taste was not what I expect from a cinnamon roll.  

If making again I would try doubling the cinnamon mixture to put inside and use the brown sugar as per the amended recipe suggestion from the OP but either I have a different idea of what these should taste like or something else went wrong but these were stodgy and heavy despite more than doubling in size when I rested them, and rising more when I baked them.  Apart from the heaviness the roll itself was quite tasteless.

But given the technique worked I am motivated to try again.  I can definitely make these at home just waiting to find the right recipe for me.

Great recipe! Make the dow overnight in the BM and bake them in the morning for breakfast. Can be easily frozen. Just put them 20 sec each in the microwave and they are soft and half-warm again!

Delicious and easy to make using the bread maker on the dough cycle. I didn't use raisins or nuts. I cut the roll into 8 (instead of 12) pieces and put it in a large ceramic pie dish; 20 minutes at 375*. Only needed 1T milk (not 1.5T) for the frosting.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these for after shoveling out from the Blizzard of 2013 (Nemo) and WOW!  Absolutely delicious!  The perfect treat for a chilly morning after the nightmare of not having had heat for 24 hours!  I figure I already burned off the calories trying to stay warm and shoveling! LOL.    I had no problems fitting a full recipe in my bread machine - but I'm used to having a full dough cycle when using it for other dough recipes.  Thanks so much for posting this - and thanks to those who left tips for preparing and freezing the dough in advance - I'll likely do that so I can have some ready to bake off one at a time in the future.

The recipe says it is to be made in the bread machine, yet the author of the post says to cut it in half for bread machines. I have a 1.5lb machine and make a recipe similar to this (with more flour) in it about 4 times a week with no problems. Regardless, I will be making it as written.

This is a fantastic recipe! My family loved them. The only tips I would add are: 1) sift the powdered sugar before making the glaze so that you don't get lumps in it; and 2) make double the glaze because the recipe did not make enough glaze to adequately cover all 12 rolls. Absolutely light and delicious!

This recipe was great.  It wasn't too sweet.  For the icing, I used two tablespoons of butter instead of 1.5 because it was easier to cut.  I added a little more confectioner sugar to compensate for the added butter, I omitted the raisins and nuts since my kids don't like those items. I will definitely make again.  My husband loves these cinnamon rolls.

I followed the directions except I added some brown sugar to the cinnamon /white sugar mixture.  I also only cooked the rolls for 18 minutes. They came out delicious!  I will never buy the store brand again!

great recipe really easy i did have to add at least another 1/2 cup of flour though. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar to mixture with the butter.  I froze half the batch and ill see how that turns out later! YUMMM!

I have to say that this is an awesome recipe, but I did some weird things to it..first, do only half the recipe for the bread machine. Next, I had some raisin/fruitcake dried fruit marinating in brandy that I put in. I set it outside overnight, and the next morning got a bit lazy and did not roll the dough out but baked it in a free-form roll. Let it rise first for several hours, as it was cold. Came out perfect! Baked it at 375 for a bit longer than 20 minutes but stayed fresh enough for the 2-3 days it was around. This was a very interesting discovery. Turned out not to be cinnamon rolls exactly but very tasty, if you like this sort of thing. I also put cinnamon and cardamom in the dough. My husband is delighted, and I have to admit it is quite easy to do (if you are inclined to do this sort of thing at all) Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I give it a three because they turned out very hard...we like them ooey gooey.  But, to be fair it may have been my fault.  I don't work a lot with yeast and I may have had my liquid too hot when mixing with the yeast. I will try again and let you know. Thanks.

Wow!!  These rolls were tender and not too sweet.  Having a bread machine made them a pleasure to make.  Thanks for the recipe!! :)

this isn't a good analyzation due to the fact that I have never made cinammon rolls in my life and am just a beginner baker.
