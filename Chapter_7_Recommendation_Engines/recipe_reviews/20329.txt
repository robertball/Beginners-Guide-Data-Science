Yummy! I made these with my 5 year old great niece. She was so impressed with herself. These are just like the TWIX candy bar, but at least you know what ingredients are going into it. Thanks for a great recipe, Saundra.

These weren't bad, but they taste so much like Twix candy bars that I don't see the point in making them again. It would probably be cheaper and definitely be faster to just buy the candy bars.

This was a great way to use up old shortbread cookies and a bag of carmels that I'd had for 1/2 a year. The shortbread cookies were no longer tasty alone - but were perfect for this recipe. I am not a candy or cookie maker, but even I could manage this and make something delicious.
