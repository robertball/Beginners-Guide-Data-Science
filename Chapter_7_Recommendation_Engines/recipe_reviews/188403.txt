Potatoes loaded with cheese and bacon is incredibly delicious so I knew this recipe was already off to a good start.  It was the addition of the Montreal Steak Seasoning, however,  that caught my eye and made this really interesting.  Great addition, although I wasn't comfortable using the full amount called for and cut it in half - neither did I use any additional salt.  Hubs and I agreed both were a good call.  I added green onion which these potatoes seemed to cry out for and it added great, fresh flavor as well as color.  These potatoes, alongside of "Sunday Meatloaf," also from this site, made for a perfect "comfort food" meal.

Very good.  Tastes like a loaded baked potato without the baked potato part.  I kept calling them baked potatoes, actually.  These are very rich, so definitely not an everyday side, but nice every once in a while.  I left out the salt bc with the steak seasoning, bacon, and cheese, I figured it would be plenty salty.  I am so glad I left out the salt, as it was perfect without.  After eating, I glanced at the steak seasoning jar and noticed the first ingredient is salt--so test it first before adding the salt.  If you think it's not salty enough, then go for it.  Very filling and good with the Montreal Peppered Steak that is also on this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this and ended up adding more butter. I didn't measure. I just added. I'm really glad I tasted the potatoes before I added more salt after I added the steak seasoning. It would have been WAY too salty if I hadn't. These potatoes are different. I'm not sure I like them alone, but they might be good with the Bottom Round Roast with Onion Gravy. I'll update after we have dinner and try them together. EDITED: My husband remarked on how this tasted like a steakhouse baked potato and how he loved it. Just for that, I'm making it again. Thank you for the recipe. It went well with the roast.

I cut the recipe in half for my family and these turned out sooo yummy. They're quite rich and not for the dieter but definitely amazing on a chilly winter night. I served them with a pork roast and brocccoli/cauliflower casserole.

WOW! This may now be my new favorite way to have mashed potatoes. I must admit, I was a little scared to put the entire 2 tablespoons of steak seasoning in there, but decided to just go for it and I am sooooo glad I did! These were absolutely perfect...no changes necessary! YUM! YUM! YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Bacon and cheese will add wonderful flavors to any dish. I followed the recipe only adding 1T of Montreal Steak Seasoning, instead of 2T and it turns out it added a real nice flavor to the mashed potatoes. I also left out the salt since the steak seasoning, bacon, and cheese was already salty. The mashed potatoes were rich, creamy, filling and flavorful!   I served this as a side dish with, “Sunday Meat Loaf,” and “Creamy Mushroom Peas,” also from this website.

Great! Jammed packed with flavor.  Took the advice of other reviews and cut the amount of Montreal Steak seasoning in half and omitted the salt.  I added 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic to the potatoes when they were boiling and also put 1/2 tsp of minced garlic in the potatoe when they were mashed.  Added a bit more bacon and chopped green onions.  The green onion gave it a very nice crunch.  Excellent way to serve mashed potatoes.  This is a must try!!

These are good but make sure you taste as you go, it would have been much too salty otherwise.

I made this with 5 lbs of potatoes. Don't double the Montreal seasoning if you are doing this or it will be too salty! Great flavor, not overly rich tasting. Love the peels left on.

Very good.  I did lighten this up a bit by using FF cream cheese and 2% cheddar (in place of the colby).  I also cut back the amount of montreal steak seasoning to 1 T. This makes 6 BIG servings.  My only complaint is that the dish was too dry with only 1/4 c. milk, but that is easily remedied.  This will be a repeat in our house.

A little heavy on the Montreal Steak Seasoning for me but easy enough to adjust.  I used real bacon and a mild cheddar.  Flavorful, delicious and well-liked by my dinner guests.

Great potatoes!  I served these with steak, of course.  I found the extra kosher salt was not necessary, what with the salt in the water and in the seasoning.  I did use the full amount of steak seasoning and it was a bit much.  I would recommend using less.

These are amazing! Absolutely delicious! I made these to go with bacon wrapped filet mignons for a small dinner party, and everyone loved these! I changed the serving to 10 because I planned to use 5 pounds of potatoes. I did only use 2 Tablesppons of Montreal seasoning, and that seemed like the perfect amount and I also omitted the salt. Although I did make enough for dinner, I really wish I made more so I could have leftovers, yes they are that good! I also added a small handful of snipped chives and that really added wonderful flavor. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, this will be used often :)

Outstanding!  I did find these on the peppery side.  Next time I will cut back on the seasoning and add more bacon.  My family loved these potatoes and I will be making it again very soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to leave out the cream cheese (someone used my little bit I saved for this recipe...) and used cheddar as my cheese. I used a "cheapy" steak seasoning, and am wondering if this impacted the recipe in a negative way. Nevertheless, we weren't fond of said seasoning in our potatoes. We'll keep it on our meats. Thank you anyway.

ditto the rest of the posters....Montreal seasoning is pretty potent stuff and I was afraid to use 2 TB. Plus the seasoning has a lot of salt in it already...and there is bacon..so I omitted the salt. Did love it/will make again...but as written would be too strong on the seasoning and too much salt...so am giving it a 4 as it had to be modified.

OH MAMA.  So delish.  Made a ton and had some to freeze.  Were letting them cool and then my husband, and maybe me forgot to put them in the freezer.  Ugh.  Definitely will make these again and remember to put them away

I tried this on my family.  I made it just as the recipe said.  They were a hit!  My family said I really outdid myself.  Will definitely make these again and will probably not be able to go back to my old traditional recipe!

These are good and certainly different than the usual mashed potato recipes.  I had to add more milk to mine but other than that followed exactly.  This does make a lot though.

I wanted to cut back on calories so I omitted the cream cheese and added more 1% milk. Instead of kosher salt I added seasoning salt. Super yummy. A great way to mix it up with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never tried to make home made mashed potatoes before because I prefer baked, but this sounded so good, I gave it a try.  It was great!  I did as others recommended, and used about half of the steak seasoning, and no extra salt, but I kept everything else the same. Super easy, and a fairly quick side dish.  I might add a little more cheese and bacon, green onions, and/or garlic next time to experiment.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are great mashed potatoes, but very salt even though I left out the bacon... I misread the recipe and left out the cheese.. I used the 2 tbls of montreal steak seasoning which I found to be a bit overpowering. These would be especially good with a steak seasoned with the steak seasoning!!

These were a nice change from plain old mashed potatoes. I have reduced the bacon bits and Montreal steak spice as I found it too salty the first time I made them.  These are a "keeper" for sure.

My family likes creamier potatoes, so I had to add more butter and milk to get it to consistency we like.

My boyfriend loved these potatoes (as did I!).  I asked him to mash them while I added ingredients and he didn't seem to mind the cream cheese, which he doesn't usually like but we both agreed that it was tasty in these! I didn't have any bacon but it really didn't make too big of a difference.  We left our potatoes unpeeled and used fat free cream cheese, lowfat cheese, and Country Crock.  This recipe is a great and rich variation of mashed potatoes...I would use this again sometime. I also added some fresh minced garlic.

These were wonderful!  I didn't add the bacon because I didn't have any but it didn't detract from the great flavor of these potatoes.  I only added about 5 tsp. instead of 2 tbsp. steak seasoning and tasted as I added along the way.  I also added a little more milk than called for.  Great way to jazz up mashed potatoes and I think I will be craving these from now on.

Very good! A different flavor than regular mashed pots but very good and will make again. I did use more milk and butter than this called for.

We have a huge bottle of Montreal Steak seasoning in the pantry that we frequently use on our steaks, but I never would have thought to add it to my mashed potatoes, until I saw this recipe reviewed.  These were spectacular.  Everyone loved them and I will definitely use this recipe time and time again.  I used yukon gold potatoes because that's what I had in the pantry, and turkey bacon, also because I already had some cooked in the fridge.  Great idea - great recipe!

I made this while on vacation, and my family LOVED IT.  I made it after we got home, but mashed to potatoes too much, and they didn't like it as well.  I would recommend leaving larger chunks of potato when you mash them

I did 2 lbs of potatoes (red & yukon gold), 1 tb of Montreal seasoning, omitted the Kosher salt, and left everything else according to the recipe amts.  Quite good, will definitely make again...  I did find they were a bit dry and ended up adding 4 tb sour cream, which helped "wet" them, except the next day the leftovers were a quite dry again... And I used only 2/3 of the potatoes called for so I can't imagine if I had put in the extra lb!  Flavor was excellent though so I'll just dr. it up to our preferred consistency or serve with gravy (not that they need it though, flavor-wise).  Would have NEVER thought to add Montreal seasoning to mashed potatoes, but it totally works!

This was really good and my family enjoyed it.  Even though I heeded the advice of the reviewers who noted lessening the amount of Montreal Seasoning and omiting the salt, I still found the seasoning a bit much.  Next time around I will use even less seasoning and taste it as I go.  I will also add more bacon and add some scallions or onion.  A really good recipe and definitely worth recommending.

WOW!!! we use Montreal Seasoning alot but NEVER thought to use it like this!! i did forget to put the bacon in but we are going to put it on top of our servings on the plate. Made these with a few other recipes from this site and my 19 year old daughter was trying to eat them all before she made her plate, hehe. Getting ready to make my plate now but these are wonderful right by themselves!!! Just give me a spoon!!

This was very good!! I left out the extra salt because the Montreal Steak Seasoning is plenty salty (I didn't use the full 2 Tbsps, either). I also didn't have bacon bits, but instead chopped up a few slices of Oscar Meyer precooked bacon. I will definitely be making this again, and, as naples34102 suggested, I will use either a small onion, or green onions.

I used Bob Evans mashed potatoes and made THE BEST loaded mashed EVER.  I feel conflicted about reviewing this recipe -- I should just post my own recipe and probably will -- but I got a lot of inspiration here so I decided to leave a review in case another cook is stuck with steaks and no baked or sweet potatoes to bake and need a starch/carb side dish -- fast. I took a pack of Bob Evans original mashed potatoes found in the fridge section of the grocery (not the family size one -- just the regular size) and added about three tablespoons 1/3 less fat cream chese, about 1/4 cup sour cream, probably a full cup or more of shredded mild cheddar cheese - divided, three green onions sliced thin (white and light green parts) and probably about a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half of SPICY Montreal seasoning. Mixed it all in a stand mixer. I microwaved them for two minutes in a bowl covered with a paper plate before adding more cheese and stirring and microwaving for another three minutes. YUM. Will definitely make these again -- though not too often since they're terrible for you even with the reduced fat cream cheese & sour cream! Looking forward to dinner tonight!
