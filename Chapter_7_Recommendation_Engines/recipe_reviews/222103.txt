Wonderful recipe, not too sweet. Used almond milk in place of regular milk, and it came out better that way--the almond flavor really complements the other ingredients in the pudding. Used pear in lieu of apples. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to use a wider pan to have more of the crusty top, rather than the softer bottom portion!

I put all the wet ingredients into a bowl, then added the bread.  That way I could really make sure it was moistened without slopping it all over the place.  I added more apple (with the skins on) and ground nutmeg.  I upped the sweetner to 3/4 cup, which was too much because I used the raisins.  I think when I make it again, I might add some nuts.  Overall, I really enjoyed this.  I didn't use a water bath, because I forgot.  It still came out fine as far as I could tell.

I have made this Bread Pudding for the past 7 years, I made some changes, a Mexican and Southern twist.  As an African American I grew up eating Bread Pudding my mother was taught by her mother who grew up in Oklahoma, Arkansas, & Louisiana.  

My most impressionable years growing up I was raised in a Mexican Household, Bread Pudding was made around holidays and at times we ate it as a dessert.

My Mexican God Mother made it with Peanuts, Raisins, and Chopped Apples.  My Grandmother made it with, Raisins, coconuts shreds,  chopped apples.

I have included a picture with this review, I tripled the recipe.  I use my God Mother's recipe with the peanuts, some people that have a peanut allergy, [ use coconuts shreds.] two apples chopped, and raisins. 

I am diabetic, so I removed the sugar and use [Granulated Sucralose zero calorie Sweetener] or Splenda, the measurements cup for cup Like Sugar.

I fooled everyone after they finished eating it, I wait for all of the compliments , I tell them all, "it was Artificial Sweetener" that was used to make the Bread Pudding! "LOL" I get a kick out of that every time people have eaten my Bread pudding.

If you don’t care for sweet desserts, you may want to try this subtly sweet bread pudding.  The raisins and apples add just enough sweetness and flavor to make this a delightful dessert that’s a little healthier than the average bread pudding.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I am happy to report it worked with gluten-free raisin bread too! I skipped the butter since I was already using whole milk, and I used Granny Smith apples and tossed in an extra one since I needed it finished off.  I didn't realize it would still be quite sweet, even with the sour apples that I highly recommend trying. However, my family usually eats little sugar--okay, except for my school-aged girl who eats candy daily (sigh), although she, too, thought it was too sweet! Shocker! I was also serving it for a crazy-day's dinner, though, so a sweet main dish was a little foreign to all of us. ;) Good stuff, though. I've been enjoying it ever since for a quick treat or meal, as I had made a double batch. I can see it being perfect for cold winter days.

I have used unsweetened almond milk for part of the milk.  I have also used cinnamon raisin bagels for the bread & raisins.  I like it with less sugar and I like the apples.  I'm not always a raisin fan, so the apples are a good change.

This was fantastic. Instead of bread I used bran muffins that I accidentally over baked. They were dry and I didn't want to waste the great ingredients. The walnuts were a great addition as was more apple. I used almond milk instead of dairy and next time I will use coconut oil instead of butter for a vegan dish. Also I topped the pudding with a teaspoon of cardamom and it was delicious!

This bread pudding recipe was okay. I added 
one apple and one pear and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to this recipe. The flavor was lovely, but had too much liquid for my liking. Next time I think I'll cut the milk down to 1 1/2 cups or add an extra slice of bread.

Delicious and easy.  Very versatile recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used a variety of breads (ends from the freezer specifically saved for bread pudding).  Shared with the neighbors who also loved it.  For a 13x9 pan, I added about 10 minutes additional bake time.  Drizzled a little warm store bought caramel sauce over the pieces before serving.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

We didn't hate this which is a miracle since we hate bread pudding. I did have to bake it an extra 25 minutes to make it not have standing fluid, but this was my 1st time making it & inexperience may account for that.

This was awesome and exactly what I was looking for to use up some whole wheat bread I had leftover!  I love that it had apples in that, that was new for me but a must have from now on.  It was not very sweet, which was a huge plus for me, but if you are used to a sweet bread pudding you might add a little more sugar.  I loved it like it was, but I really don't like sweet things and usually have to reduce the sugar in recipes.

I used almond milk with hint of honey and vanilla in place of low fat milk, cranraisins instead od raisins , brown sugar sprinkled on top of the pudding right after taking it out of the oven to cool off .  No need of white sugar as the almond milk is already sweet, it was a Big Hit with my coworkers , even those on low carb diet can't resist having 2 servings!!!

We love this bread pudding and always include the raisins and apples. I always use brown sugar rather than white. I have used the splenda brown sugar (1/2 splenda, 1/2 brown sugar) in place of the sugar and it worked well.

I made this with stale French bread.  Had no raisins so I used dried cranberries.  Used one apple and two peaches - unpeeled.  I was going Square dancing so put in slow cooker on low.  Three hours later when I returned it was done!  Perfection and so, so easy!

I'd never made bread pudding before but had some bread & skim milk I wanted to use up.   I included the raisins, added 1/2 tsp allspice w/ the cinnamon, shorted the 1/2 c. sugar a little bit.  I let the bread sit & soak up the liquid for maybe 15 or  20 minutes  because I had something else in the oven.  I was very happy w/ the results and will definitely make it again.

We found this quite tasty.  Having a mix of healthy whole grain breads on hand, we used them, including 3 end pieces.  Melted the butter in the 9x9 pan while oven was preheating, and added the small torn bread pieces, which I had sprinkled liberally with cinnamon, when melted.   Mixed the eggs, 3/4 cup sugar, evaporated skim milk/fat free half and half mix (2 cups worth), diced unpeeled apple, a few gratings of fresh nutmeg, and the liberal teaspoon of vanilla and poured over the bread.  No raisins.  No water bath.  Cooked in exactly 45 minutes.  Sprinkled with a bit of coconut brown sugar upon removing pan from oven.  This dessert should be stored in the refrigerator, I believe, if you have any left.  Makes a nice breakfast or a dessert and would be great with ice-cream on top, but not as healthy, lol.  Thanks for sharing.

This was perfect! I had too much whole wheat bread and needed to use it for something so I was pleased to find this quick and easy recipe. My husband loved it.  My dish took about an hour to cook rather than the suggested 45 minutes. I am not sure if it was due to the deeper casserole dish I used or the water bath that was recommended. Since my husband loved my first try at bread pudding, I'm stickin' with it as is. Definitely a keeper.

This was honestly a great little dessert. Everyone who tried it loved it! I would, however, reduce the amount of sugar used for a second batch as it can be a little cloying for those not used to sweets.

Superb!  Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and try turbinado instead of white sugar.  Next time I'll try honey...

Loved the recipe! Would definitely make it again. Instead of using an apple I decided to use a banana and it tasted amazing

Yum!  A great recipe and very easy!  Not terribly sticky sweet either.  I actually used Splenda and it turned out great.  Try it with a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top!
