One of my favorite all time recipes, outstanding reviews every time. I add a can of olive oil and garlic flavored diced tomatoes to make for chunkier dipping. Also I cut all the butter out as the flavor is enough on its own. I serve it with toasted baguette (brush with garlic powder and butter before putting it in the oven if you want).

Great flavour with the tomatoe and clam juice cocktail.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to it and will add more of the tomatoe and clam juice, the hubby likes to soak up the juice with a baguette or sour dough.  I didn't realize how easy it would be to make. Might even add some cayenne pepper to give it a little bite. Very good recipe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The mussels were easy and quick to prepare . . .and tasted delicious. I used Clamato and added a bit more clam juice, and the mussels just sucked up all the flavors. The dipping sauce created at the end was a wonderful touch. I suggest using New Zealand mussels.

Very tasty! I only used 0.5 cups of wine to 1 cup of Clamato, as I was running low on wine. Besides, I wanted the main flavour to be the Clamato... I also added some salt & few hearty dashes of Tabasco sauce to the liquid before cooking the mussels. (My idea was to make the broth like a spicy Bloody Ceasar cocktail.) The clamato really gives the mussels a kick that is a nice change from the classic garlic/wine French method. I did use the butter in the recipe, but I find it doesn't thicken the sauce that much anyway, and it almost tasted better before I added the butter, so this step will be optional for me in the future. I had lots of leftovers, so will add some diced tomatoes & tomato paste to the mussel meat and broth and turn it into a pasta sauce another night. What a great way to enjoy mussels, thanks for the recipe -- I will be sure to make this again and again!

Absolutely Fabulous. The flavor, appearance and ease of preparation make this dish simply delicious. I made only minor changes: 1 cup clam/tomato juice and 1/2 cup white wine(instead of 3/4C of each), I did add 1 can of chopped tomatoes as recommended by another reviewer and I reduced the liquid before adding the mussels. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this recipe without altering the directions at all and they were excellent!  Make sure you have a BIG loaf of french bread on hand to sop up the juices!

This was perfect and unbelievably easy to make.  I use the leftover sauce on my pasta afterwards too. My only problem is how it always boils over the top.  I have to stand on top of it and as soon as it starts bubbling, shut it down.  I'd love someone's help on this because I hate cleaning my stove top. :)

This rates 5 stars on all counts.  Healthy, easy, inexpensive (for seafood), quick, and delicous.  The broth is wonderful.  Way to good to be just the appetizer.  Add a salad and crusty bread for sopping up the broth and you have a complete meal. If you have access to fresh mussels, this recipe is a must try.

I used this recipe the first time I made mussels and it worked out wonderfully!  We ate the mussels so fast as they were so yummy. The sauce is delicious, we always dip our bread into it.  We've made this dish many times now and we love it.  Thanks Karen!

This is super easy and tasty! Make sure to clean the mussels first. Soak for 20 minutes in cold cold cold water with a few tablespoons of cornmeal. The cornmeal helps the mussels to spit out the grit and salt. Then take a sturdy brush and scrub grit and barnacles off. 

The recipes is awesome as is and the changes we made are simply for our tastes and what we have around the house. Thank you for the amazing recipe, I have had rave reviews over it! 

Since we have made it a few times we have made the following changes: Instead of butter we use olive oil and saute the garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients. We tend to add a lot more garlic and pepper and some healthy dashes of oregano.  We add a can of tomatoes with the juice instead of tomato juice, and after the mussels are done, I remove them and add a can of tomato paste. It makes a thicker sauce and we serve everything over pasta.

Outstanding! This is an excellent and easy recipe to whip up. I'm thinking about adding a few crushed tomatoes next time to give the french bread a little more to dip with. Top Notch!

My family thought this was really good!  Even the kids asked for me to make mussels this way again.  I used beer as I was out of wine.  I added fresh parsley, black pepper and doubled the crushed red pepper.

I added a little extra butter to try and thicken the sauce but it didn't work. Whisked some cornstarch into a small amount of clam and tomato juice cocktail to help thicken and worked. Next time I will add seasoned, canned, diced tomatoes. Make sure you have a baguette for dipping!

These mussels are tasty!  We didn't have any tomato and clam juice cocktail the first time we made them, so we substituted with Bloody Mary mix that we had on hand and they were great.  Tonight we decided to make them again and we used the Bloody Mary mix again and thought they would be good with pasta, so once we removed the mussels from the liquid and added the butter, we added some sliced portabella mushrooms, de-shelled the mussels and added them back to the juice, cooked it down for a bit and mixed it with cooked spaghetti.  It was fantabulous!!!!!  We will definitely make it again!

Holy ! These ARE amazing! im sure the regular recipe is delicious but I didn't have the "juice" recommended, but I did have spicy vegetable juice and tomato sauce! I use sauvignon blanc for the white wine  and I added a tbsp of cholula hot sauce and a bay leaf, and I had garlic french bread which was stupendous! Definitely saved the leftover sauce  for spaghetti sauce tomorrow! Also I slowly heated up the sauce on medium low for about 30 minutes then added mussels and turned it up to medium for the 6 minutes then turned the sauce on high heat for 5 minutes + definitely a keeper

Lately we've been making this about once a week.  I make a couple little changes to make the recipe spicier and I serve it over linguine.

I use a riesling for the wine, add a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos to make it chunkier, and at least double the red pepper flakes.  I also add about 1/4 - 1/2 tbsp of salt which really brings out the flavor.  

For the linguine I boil it until about 2-3 minutes before it's done and then drain it.  Once I take the mussels out of the sauce and the butter melts I add the linguine and let it finish cooking in the sauce.  It really picks up the flavor.

This is a great recipe, we eat it all the time and it never gets old.

Another home run. Expensive dining out, cheap at the grocer. On sale, $3.69 a pound. I used clamato juice, white wine, garlic powder, and pepper flakes. Yum!

This dish is awesome - with modifications, as a main course. I steamed the mussels separately, while the sauce was reducing. To bulk up the sauce, I added cherry tomatoes and mushrooms (both halved), some cayenne pepper and more garlic. Once the mussels were done, I drained them and poured the sauce over the top.  It was absolutely amazing and is now tops on my list for mussels. Didn't even need bread, it was substantial and yummy on it's own.

This is a superb dish !!!  We loved it so much that the next time I made it, I had to double the recipe.  Serve with a baguette bread to soak up every delicious drop of the sauce.  It's easy to prepare and the taste is out of this world.

My husband and I love this recipe. This was the first mussel recipe I ever tried and it was so easy and turned out great. I've tried others since I found this one but I always come back. A must have in your recipe box!

I always enjoy these mussels in the recipe as is. I also enjoy making a 9 serving size or so for my family of 4 and throwing some pasta and a can of petite diced tomatoes into the sauce as well to make it like a soup almost and serve with warm french bread for dipping.

I make this bi-weekly as it is my boyfriends fave. I make only a few changes - i skip the reduction part AND skip the butter (I've done it a couple of times-but don't notice much/any difference) - add more clamato, NO tomato juice BUT I do add one large can of diced tomatoes (drained...the ones with the italian seasoning already mixed in are great!!). I also use the extra spicy clamato - which gives it an extra kick. I serve it more like a 'Fish Stew' in a large bowl with a baguette - YUMMY!

In terms of ease and presentation - excellent.  Taste -- average.  Seemed dull to us.  Next time I will make the sauce with additional spices, cook the seafood by itself and pour the sauce on top.

I loved the Clamato idea, although it did not do much for me. It was very sweet in flavor (read ingredients.) I added a little more garlic and some basil/parsley to add some body to it. If you really like mussels give it a try.

This is replacing my Mussels Diablo recipe. That being said, cooks might want to note that tomato/clam cocktail juice is made with high fructose corn syrup and msg. I didn't realize this until husband came back from the grocery store with the ingredients. Thank goodness I had V8 and clam juice in the pantry. I made that substitution. Rave reviews from my dinner guest. We served this over angel hair pasta and increased the amounts to serve 5 as a meal. My oldest daughter ate 3 helpings.

So easy! So delicious. A true winner.

One note: I did double the recipe when I made these for a dinner party and they didn't come out quite as well as when I had made the original-sized batch. There wasn't as much of the delicious sauce. I'll add extra wine, butter and cocktail next time!

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I always order mussels in red sauce when we go out to Italian restaurants so for a special treat, I thought I'd try making them at home. Success! I made a few changes as some had suggested. I was pretty liberal with the measurements of the the white wine, clam juice and tomato juice. I added some diced tomatoes, fresh parsley and basil, salt/pepper, minced onions and a little more garlic. This, a salad with oil/vinegar and a loaf of baguette and you got yourself dinner. Can't wait to make these again.

This recipe is so great!  It's yummy, quick, easy, and inexpensive!  It was my first time making mussels and they were perfect.  My husband loves mussels so I made this as part of our Valentine's dinner and we both loved it!  I couldn't find the tomato & clam cocktail juice, so I mixed regular tomato juice with clam juice.  I will be making this again for sure!

This is a fantastic and simple recipe. It was the first time I have made mussels and they came out perfect. I didn't have regular tomato juice so I used V-8 and it worked fine.

very good and very easy. My Husband said this was the first time he ever really enjoyed eating mussels -- I added some fresh tarragon to give it a little extra kick and be patient while the sauce reduces; it smells so good you'll want to have it before it's ready!

It was good. Maybe I didn't make it right, but the taste and flavor of each mussel seemed to be vastly different (some had a lot more garlic, some more basil)

Very tasty,  I mixed it up a bit to use what I had on hand.  V8 juice instead of Clamato, and dry vermouth instead of wine.  Could have used a bit more red pepper in my opinion but very delicous for a lunch on a hot summer day.

Surprisingly tasty way to cook and eat mussels!  I couldn't find tomato clam cocktail, so I just used tomato cocktail.  I love mussels, and thought the tomato with this recipe might taste weird, but it was a peppery tomato flavor and turned out delicious!

I've made this recipe multiple times now and it has never failed to please!! The only thing I do differently is I boil all the liquid for a bit before pouring it over the mussels. The Costco location close to my house sells pre-cleaned mussels which make this recipe very quick to make!

These were fantastic.  I used regular tomato juice and a jar of calm juice, Chardonnay, garlic (reduced by at least 1/2) and then lite butter at the end.  I also used some fresh parsley to brighten it up.  Fantastic taste. I will use this recipe again.  We dipped our toasted french bread in the juice.. it was just awesome.  Thank you Casey52 for a wonderful, easy, and FAST recipe.

Perfect! i used regular tomato juice and frozen precooked mussels out of necessity, and it was fantastic! As such, this appetizer can be pulled out with no advanced planning as long as you have a can  of tomato juice.  Thank you!

I used spicy V8 and more garlic.  Hubs thought they tasted muddy which had nothing to do with your recipe so I got them to myself!  Mopped up yummy broth with crusty bread.  Added some seasoning blend I use for olive oil to dip bread in that's a bit spicy.  Was divine!!!

Amazingly good and most importantly easy! I added tomato sauce to the wine and juice to thicken it a bit, after I sautéed the garlic with some butter and half a finely chopped white onion. Be sure to get some bread to eat with the sauce. I doubled the recipe because we are mussel lovers and this didn't disappoint.

This was wonderful. I followed others and used diced canned tomatoes with chipotles instead of the tomato juice cause we like spicey had no clam juice do added a slug or two of Bloody Mary mix. It was so good. I coulda been heating in a five star restaurant.  Make sure to have lots of crusty bread for the broth

I'm not a fan of mussels but my husband enjoys them and it's really the one thing I don't ever make. I decided I would surprise him so I tried this recipe. DELICIOUS! husband really liked them and I really can't believe it but I did too! My daughter said, "Where have these been my whole life?" Will being making again for sure. Thanks for sharing!

This was completely awesome. We added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion like one reviewer suggested, b/c we wanted a chunkier sauce.  It was absolutely incredible. We will definitely make this again!

Very good!  Used clam juice and V8. Used 5 lbs of clams but only doubled the other ingredients and it was perfect!

I loved this recipe! I added extra garlic, two shallots and two Roma tomatoes chopped in big pieces. I wasn't sure what the red sauce/ clam mixture was made of so I bought red clam sauce instead, flavor was perfect. This recipe was great and easy to do.
