Excellent cookies...I didn't have any brandy so I used the same amount of Orange Juice in it's place and twice the amount of Baking Powder in place of the baking soda.  Will definetly make again!!!!!!

I really loved this twist on the chocolate chip cookie! The cookies have a nice texture and they're very sweet, just how I like 'em. I wanted to try this recipe to use up leftover glace mix from Christmas and it worked great.
