I doubled the recipe for everything except the turkey.  This is great!  I did not puree the mixture because I like the chunks of beans, meat and veggies!  I love how vivid all the colors are!

Good recipe, especially for a high veggie low sat fat meal, with caveats.  I doubled the chili powder and added 2 cloves of diced garlic to the veggies and found it to be STILL mild but very tasty... but I live in California where Mexican food is commonplace and spicy.  I also increased the cumin by half and it could have probably been doubled.  I did not have corn in the house - we eat very little or no starch - so diced a zucchini and sauteed it with the veggies and it worked perfectly.  Also, the recipe makes about 8 servings, not 12, unless you are serving it in small portions or as a side dish.  We ate it as a one dish meal with a little brown rice underneath, and in this case, it was 8 normal portions, not big man-sized ones.  The time allocated is fairly accurate, maybe a little optimistic for the first time unless you're a ginzu chopper!

I enjoyed making this recipe and following some of the other readers' suggestions like additional chili powder and zuccini.  Instead of making the chili thick by puree(ing), I added a can of organic refried beans-really delicious.  I also added garlic at the chili powder stage (to avoid browning).

Made this a couple of times and both times came out amazing.
I doubled the cooking time and used vegetable stock instead, obviously omitting the turkey.

This was delicious.  I only changed two things in this recipe.  I added 4 diced (seeded) jalapenos. I also used a bag of dried mixed beans instead of canned black and garbanzo beans.

Wow!  So great!  I doubled the chili powder and added 1 tablespoon of garlic salt and 1 tablespoon of red chili flakes.  Boyfriend approved!

This was a really good recipe.  I was suprised by how easy it was and the leftovers were even better the next day for lunch.  

The next time that I make this I will make corn bread to go with it.

This was tasty and pretty easy, I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used 1 green and 1 red pepper and canned corn.  I think it lacked salt so I added a little.  It's really very pretty and fall like, the colors of the vegetable look so nice.  I brought the left overs to work and everyone loved it.  We are only two people and it makes quite a bit.  It actually tasted better the next day, I guess all the flavors get to blend together.  My husband does not like chick peas and picked some of them out but all in all it was quite good and very healthy.  One more thing, it is not very spicy at all so if you want it spicy you definitely have to add more chili powder or maybe fresh chili pepper.

Fantastic!  My husband doesn't like spicy, like I do, so I kept the spices the same and he loved it and so did I.  It makes so much that we made a few more meals from it including nachos!  We spooned it over chips, covered with pepper jack cheese then baked.  When the dish came out we dotted fat-free sour cream and avocado...delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It gets big points for being easy, quick, made with ingredients I usually always have on hand, and very filling (great for a diet!).  On the down side, there really wasn't much flavor.

I am sure the recipe is fine as is.  As a diabetic, made some modification and it was AMAZING.  I omitted the corn and cut the tomatoes to two 10 oz cans.  I doubled both beans and used low sodium versions.  I like spicy so I also doubled the cumin.  I am not a fan of carrots, so I cut them thin.  I used to be a beef + deep fry it and dip it in ranch kind of guy, so changing my diet has not been easy.  Recipes like this are INVALUABLE to me.  Sooo good and sooo healthy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  One last note... I have seen people omit pureeing a portion of it.  IMO then it would be a soup not a chili.  Do what you want...just saying that if you want chili you need to puree.

Black Bean & Chick Pea Chili Haiku: "So many colors, made up this 'rainbow' chili! Glad I made a ton!" I took a chance and made a bunch of this (w/ the suggested ground turkey), and froze half; but wow, this was awesome, and I look forward to eating those leftovers, tucked away in the freezer for the next chilitch that I get. I followed the recipe exactly (ingredients), but put everything in the crockpot b4 work in the a.m., and came home to wonderful wafting aromas; missed the part about pureeing part of it, which I'm glad that I did, b/c I love that earthy bite of chickpeas. Awesome. Chili.

This is the second time I have made this Chili, super easy and boy does it taste good!  At serving time, I add a sprinkle of Cilantro and a dollop of sour cream, you can't beat this for a chill November evening.

Great as written - even better after adding 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoes & a seeded, diced jalapeno. I prefer to skip the puree process entirely.

Didn't use the turkey and didn't have carrot or corn. Added a clove of garlic and also a little bit of diced chile pepper. Ate with wholewheat pitta bread one day and brown rice the next - yum!

I use AllRecipes.com a lot, but rarely write reviews.  But this was so amazing and easy that I just had to let everyone know.  I cut the recipe in half, but used the full can of both types of beans.  I also used over a pound of ground turkey.  Because of these modifications it was very thick, but we loved it.  And it was even better the next day!  Thanks, Jenny, for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper!

This dish is phenomenal.  Pureeing a portion of the chili makes it so much heartier.  I tried it without the turkey and didn't even miss it.  This was a hit in my household.

Very good chili except that I used my Fusion Spice works Chili Hot Ground and one tablespoon is way too hot.  Can anyone suggest how I can reduce the heat in this pot of chili; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

I made this without the turkey and substituted vegetable broth because I am a vegetarian. This recipe is great. I actually cooked it over a month ago and froze it. I am just tasting it for the first time today and I am so happy. This was a great find.

This recipe is SO easy it's unbelievable! I halved the recipe and it still amounted to a lot! Instead of canned beans and peas, I used dried ones. I also added Sriracha sauce at the end to give it more kick. Definitely a favourite and monthly entree.

For next time though, I think I'm going to puree just the veggies and chickpeas, and leave out the black beans. Something about the colour of the puree with black beans included turned me off... haha

Very good, simple, healthy (I drained the oil rather than cook with it, however) chili recipe! LOVED the flavors of carrots and corn and found the chick peas to be just enough different :) Added a bit of red pepper to give it a kick. Definitely making again! Would like to figure out how to thicken it a bit more though. (That's why not five stars.)

This will definitely be making its way into my biweekly fall/winter meal rotation. Great base recipe to work with. I omitted the corn and carrots and used zucchini instead since it's what I had in my fridge. I used red and yellow bell pepper for a pop of color. I doubled the cumin and added salt. I think any type of bean or veggie would work well in this dish. Perfect for cleaning out your fridge! Served with sour cream and corn bread. My partner loved it!

Absolute favorite chili recipe ever, hands down. We used ground turkey breast but that’s the only change to the recipe we made. It is EXCELLENT.

After reading the reviews and all the variations folks have tried, I sort of considered the recipe a "base" or starting point. Like others, I used what I had on hand. So instead of peppers, I chopped up some broccoli and tossed in some spinach. I'm not a fan of cooked carrots, so I just eliminated them. I doubled the amount of chili powder, and added red pepper, minced garlic, oregano and onion powder (since I didn't have an onion). I  *thought* I only had crushed tomatoes and started with them, but then realized I *did* have diced, so added them as well. I compensated for the extra liquid by not adding chicken broth, and adding an extra can of beans (kidney).  At first I didn't do the puree, as others had eliminated that and I thought I could. But the chili seemed a bit watery, so I did the puree with the turkey already added, which didn't seem to matter. I used an attachment to my stick blender, and that made it super easy to do. I work from home and whipped this up over my lunch hour. It was super easy, and fun thanks to the experimentation. I had it for lunch today, and it was fabulous. It had just the right amount of bite, but I was ready with more red pepper and some hot sauce in case it needed more. I'll definitely make it again, but as my husband is not a chili fan, I'll probably be freezing some of what I made  and will have it on hand for a while. The extra ingredients resulted in a very large batch. But I'm not complaining. :)

Delicious. I used hamburger and beef broth. Yummy! I needed to use 20 fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Also added small can of tomato paste, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a bit of brown sugar.

Everyone at work loved this chili. I made a few modifications, I used 2 lbs of ground beef, added a chopped jalapeno pepper, diced 2 carrots, used 4 cans of Rotel and 1 can of seasoned tomato sauce and added 2 stalks of chopped celery. I didn't use the chicken broth.  I used about 3 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 tablespoon of cumin. I also added salt. It was nice and thick and full of veggies. I topped with green onion, cheese and sour cream.

I still eat ground beef so that’s what I used and i added a packet of McCormick Chili seasoning in addition to the recipe for added flavor. It was delicious! I added cyan pepper to my serving only since I’m a fan of spicy hot chili. I did not add carrots since I didn’t have any.

I was skeptical about carrots in chili, so I grated them instead of chopping them.  I also added a fresh jalapeno and a can of green chilies because I just couldn't imagine chili without those things.  This chili is good!  I stuck it in the oven on low and let it cook all day then topped it with some corn chips, sour cream, and fresh avocado.  No complaints from this house.

This a simple recipe, but like others I made a few changes   First, I used what I had. So I  used Crushed tomatoes instead of diced. This actually made it Nice and Thick so I only used One cup of chicken broth. This took away the step of Pureeing in. Out of lack of I  omitted the bell Pepper, and the turkey Substituted for ground beef.  Since Some other reveiws said it lacked seasoning, I added garlic

This is my standby recipe for life! I substitute one zucchini and one yellow squash for the corn and add a few handfuls of fresh spinach. Sharp cheddar cheese on top is a great addition.  I've also added a cup or two of cooked red quinoa with good results! I don't puree the mixture either... it's nice seeing all the vegetables and it's easier anyway!  I make a huge pot of it and freeze it for a week's worth of healthy dinners.

this was quite good.  A really nice alternative to a chilli with hamburger and sooo much more healthy.  Will definitely make again but might add a bit more spice to kick it up as it is quite mild.  None the less, will be making again!

Pretty good - omitted the turkey and skipped the puree.  Also added some minced garlic and chopped celery and simmered on low for about an hour.  Served over brown rice - very colorful, low fat and healthy!
