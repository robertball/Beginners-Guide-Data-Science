I made this recipe last night for my family who is visiting.  I made two changes, which I think were crucial to the success of this dish.  I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and I used TWO 26 oz containers of sauce, both the garlic and herb variety.  The only other thing that I did differently was to spread just a little sauce on the bottom of the dishes instead of greasing them, which worked just as well.  I can't imagine making this without doubling the sauce... I just don't think it would be wet enough.  Even with the extra sauce, the casserole still stuck together well enough to serve with a spatula.  I honestly believe that this would have served more like 12 people, because there were six of us and we have more than half left over after some of us had seconds!  This makes a very large batch, which is great because I don't have to cook tonight!

LOVE this recipe. I substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese, though (I think it makes the casserole "stick" together better). I also have added additional veggies and herbs, and it is fantastic. My little ones literally eat this recipe up!

Wow this is good. Wonderful comfort food, soooo tasty. My package of spaghetti was 12 oz instead of 16 oz but that was more than enough. I used more sauce than what is called for to get 'full coverage' of the spaghetti--- probably an extra two cups. I've made this entirely without the meat, for my vegetarian husband, and it's still amazing! He loves it. For those of you who thought the flavor was bland, that is probably because of the sauce you're using. The sauce is really the only seasoning you're using besides the seasoned salt, so use a good one that you really like. I used one with roasted peppers and garlic flavor. Baked it exactly as directed, and it wasn't dry at all. Just exactly right. It is also cheap to make since it makes a lot of food, about eight filling portions, and you can refrigerate and microwave it up. Thanks for this recipe!

Hubby loved this dish. Well, of course I tweaked it to his liking. Used whole grain spaghetti, substituted fresh baby spinach for the onion and added fresh garlic to the meat mixture. I also subbed  non fat sour cream for the cottage cheese. mixed all with pasta and baked at 350 for 15 min. Placed pepper jack on top and melted. Sounds like a lot of changes but it wasn't really. I'm sure this will be a regular dish around here. Thanks so much.

My family really liked this recipe. I added spicey ground sausage for a little extra flavor. (1/2 Pd. ground beef, 1/2 pd. ground sausage). I made it the night before so I could just pop it in the oven the next day.

This was a very thick and cheesy baked spaghetti, the best I've ever had. I did use Ricotta instead of cottage cheese and it was fine. Feeds about 10 b/c it's so thick.

I skipped to Cottage cheese, because i just didn't have any whihc might have been the reason why it was on the dry side, but next time i will use less than a whole box of spaghetti and may be even a thinner kind of pasta and bake it for only 10 minutes uncovered. Also the recipe suggests 1/2 Teaspoon of Seasonned salt, but I suggest a tablespoon, I have to admit I do like my salt. Other than that it was great, EASY, and now i don't have to worry about tomorrow's dinner.

This was good, but in all honesty, to me, it really didn't taste any different than plain old spaghetti. However, it is a great, different way to eat it; the casserole holds together so you can cut through it with a fork rather than twisting the pasta around with a spoon and a fork.

I made the recipe for 4 people and cooked it in in my crock pot.  Layer it like the original recipe and cook on low for several hours.  Yummy!

I make this often for my house of 5.  I have been for years.  The only thing I do differently is add the big jar of sauce.  I use my favorite kind or whatever is on sale.  It just needs more sauce or is dry.  I also add extra cheese because in this house there can never be to much cheese in anything.  It makes a lot.  We usually still have over half the pan left.  I give some to my mother and step-father everytime I make it and still have leftovers.  Small family cut in half.

This is a recipe I have used for several years. I add a layer of spinach, either fresh or frozen (thawed and drained very well).  I also double the spaghetti sauce or it is too dry.  Wonderful flavor and so much less work than lasagna!

This was great, even though I omitted the butter by mistake and also mixed ALL the cheeses together at once. (subbed ricotta cheese and shredded parm).  I was in hurry ... so didn't pay close attention to directions.  I topped it with extra mozzarella.   I'm concluding this is a fool-proof meal!  Will definitely make again.  Maybe I'll even follow the directions next time!

Move over, lasagna.  You have a new competitor for my favorite pasta dish.  I'll have to try some of the other suggestions and include spinach and ricotta next time.  I was surprised at how easily it came out of the pan: lasagna is usually a struggle, but this dish came out in a cheesy cube of noodly awesomosity.  Good thing there are lots of leftovers.  Hello, midnight snack!

This was so good! (However, note I used homemade marinara and barely any cheese!) As I made it, without jar sauce, it reminded me of something I might eat at an Italian American restaurant. I have tried making baked spaghetti before and it is usually dry, following the recipe. This was not at all! I used the recipe for "Best Marinara Sauce" from this website. I used lean beef, lighter cheeses, & whipped butter. I used lite "large" curd cottage cheese, and half of it, and only about 1/2 cup chopped lite mozzarella for the top, so I can only imagine what the regular version is like. And, I am glad I did that, because the ingredients just fit in the pan. I also used angel hair pasta and cooked it well beyond al dente so it did not soak up the good sauce when it baked. And, I decided to take it out of the oven about 15 minutes early, so it stayed nice and moist. Thanks for the great meal!

Excellent recipe. I took the advice of other reviews and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, used two jars of sauce, and Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I tossed the noodles with the egg mixture as directed, then stirred in the ricotta and mozzarella rather than layering. Turned out great. Dish could be cut with a spatula and served in squares. Makes way more than 8 servings, we had plenty of leftovers. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I make this with my own  meat sauce and do not layer it.  I put the mixed spaghetti into a pie dish, push some up the sides, add the cottage cheese, and then the sauce, and top with mozzarella then bake.  Comes out much better and is requested often.  Serve with some extra sauce and garlic bread.  YUM!!  I just saw the question why the eggs.  The eggs in this recipe helps to hold the noodles like a crust.  It is mixed with the noodles, not the cheese.

I'll be honest, I never EVER would have made this on purpose... it's just not my kind of recipe. But I had leftover noodles, some leftover marinara in the freezer and a tub of ricotta in the fridge about to go bad. I whipped this up for lunch thinking we'd have leftovers for days... but my 5 year old is on his 2nd helping and is still eating, my BIL is on his 3rd and I'm contemplating a 2nd. My 9 month old even ate half a piece and loved it. This is really farkin' good. Changes -  I used ricotta, and I added 1 egg and some italian seasoning to the ricotta. I didn't layer, just did noodles, ricotta, sauce. Really REALLY good. Held together beautifully, came out in pretty little (or not so little) squares.

I use Italian sausage instead of ground beef, ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and two jars of spaghetti sauce (whatever flavor I have on hand).  I usually divided it into three 8 x 8 pans, bake one and freeze two.  I frequently give a pan to a sick or homebound friend with an attached card telling them how long to bake it.  I used to wait for them to ask for the recipe, but now I just include a copy with the dish.  I have had so many compliments for such a simple supper.  It makes me so happy to know that they enjoy what I am able to share with them.

This is basically lasagna made with spaghetti pasta instead of lasagna noodles!  But either way, it tastes good.  Just use ricotta if you can - but note that ricotta is drier than cottage cheese. So for those folks who substituted and then said it was dry and needed more sauce, THAT'S why.  Either way - tasty and easy.

This is the best.  I didn't change this recipe as it is very basic, but please add more sauce, or it will dry out.  It is also very wonderful with mushrooms, or as other home chefs did, add peppers, or stewed tomatoes. I also add more cheese, and I love a mix of Italian cheeses. I also add a little red wine for a boost of flavor.  I love doing this recipe in the crock pot on low  if I am time press or cannot be around to watch the oven.  Either way, it is a winner and easy recipe for beginning cooks.

Husband and I loved this!  I loved it because it's simple, but also tasty.  I will add a little more sauce next time or maybe put sauce on the plate and the serving of baked spaghetti on top because my husband likes things a little saucier.  Overall, perfect and beats boring old regular spaghetti!

Very good dish. My 1year old loved it. I also used ricotta cheese and a LARGE jar of spaghetti sauce. It still came out dry. We have a ton of left overs and I will just add some extra sauce tomorrow night to make it not so dry. Overall...easy and yummy

This is not a review - I haven't made this recipe.  I would just like to provide some information to a reviewer's comment concerning the addition of eggs.                                                               The reason for adding eggs to the cottage cheese or ricotta cheese mixture,  is to help bind the ingredients. Eggs do frequently appear as ingredients in many recipes similar to this one .. i.e, lasagna, manicotti.

This is a favorite at my house. The guys at my husbands office love it too.  I do follow some suggetions people have made.  I add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic while cooking the beef and onion, and I use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. I put 1.5 jars in the meat mixture, then when layering, I put the remaining sauce in first, then the spaghetti, etc. Always a pleaser!

Delicious and easy meal to put together.  Cut nice for a pretty presentation on the plate.  Pair with a salad and garlic bread for a filling meal.  I made in two 9 x 9 pans - baked one and froze the other for another meal.  Thanks Louise for a well enjoyed dinner!

Sensational!  This recipe beats any and all of my lasagna or baked spaghetti efforts by a far mile - it's a keeper!   I used cottage cheese and mashed it slightly with a fork because couldn't find a small curd type in local stores and ricotta cheese was more than twice the price.  I did add 3 cloves of garlic along with italian seasoning instead of seasoned salt, but otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  We really liked the mixture of the egg/buttter/Parm Cheese/spaghetti.  It added an interesting combination to the overall flavour of each layers and for that reason I felt one jar of sauce, as stated in the recipe, was just the  right amount.

This was delicious! My 5-year old daughter loved it too. I love reading the reviews because it gives me so many ideas on how to make recipes better--thanks to all of you reviewers who take the time to write about your cooking experiences for me (a novice)! I altered the baked spaghetti as suggested by adding more spaghetti sauce (and I’m glad I did otherwise I think that it would have been dry). I also used less spaghetti (not 16 oz.) as I believed adding more would have been too much. I seasoned it a little more by adding seasoned salt, a little garlic and oregano.   I was a bit apprehensive about adding cottage cheese; however, it worked beautifully—didn’t even know it was there (it looked like ricotta cheese once it was done). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe that can be adapted easily to  individual tastes. The only change I really recommend is breaking the spaghetti into pieces before cooking. Then you have a real kid- friendly casserole - and I also like not having to twirl! Thank you Louise!

I have been using this recipe for about 25 years.  Everyone loves it.  It is a great dish to make and bake later.  I tried ricotta cheese once, but I still prefer cottage cheese. My recipe calls for less spaghetti and more meat.  7 or 9 oz box of spaghetti, and 2 pounds of ground beef.  I just make the spaghetti crust, and the meat sauce and tuck it all together in layers in the pan.  ******

I have made this recipe without the meat.  I substitute ricotta cheese for cottage cheese and layer it like you would lasagna.  Was a HUGE HIT with the family.  Is even better the next day.

My family loved this recipe when I prepared it last weekend! My son was home from college, and he called it "heaven on a plate." I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, although my sons probably would have liked it without. I also used a 48 oz. jar of sauce, and I'm glad I did that. It was just right! My husband, the lasagna lover, said that he likes this better than lasagna - which was music to my ears. He said it held together nicely - much better than lasagna, where the layers tend to shift and fall apart. The four of us ate on this 9" x 13" for three days - the recipe yielded A LOT, even for my three big eaters! I'll make this again for sure!

This is favorite in our house, but I simplify it imensely when I need a quick casserole.  First, instead of ground beef and onions I use pre-made, Simeks meatballs (thawed, and Lots of flavor there!)  I also skip the egg and melted butter when time is short.  Instead I just stir parmesan and cottage cheese (or ricotta) straight into the cooked pasta.  I generally use thin spaghetti, but that is just my preference.  I place the pasta with the cheese into a greased baking dish, top with a can of diced tomatoes (undrained), then add the thawed meatballs, top with a jar of spaghetti sauce and lastly the mozzarella cheese.  Generally I make this a day ahead and just pop it in the oven for 30-45 min.  Turns out great and my family loves it!

It was great. Everyone loved it. I subbed ground pork for the ground beef and used a combo of cottage cheese, ricotta cheese and sour cream. Wouldn't have minded a little more sauce but the flavor was great.

SO GOOD! Even though it's just me and my husband at home, I have no doubt whenever I make this that it will get eaten. It's so creamy! I did use less butter though (don't tell Paula Deen). I only used 3 Tbsp. Also, the first time I made it, I used bow-tie pasta because that's all I had. It was still delicious! Works great as leftovers, for lunches and I might even try freezing half of it next time. Thanks for the great recipe Louise!

Doubled the sauce.  This was very good and makes a lot for leftovers.  May omit the butter next time as I am not so sure what the purpose is for it.

This was really good - a little like lasagna.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and took the advice of others and used more sauce - it was a large jar that had around 45oz and I was very glad I did - not too saucy at all.

Followed recipe exactly except for maybe a half cup more sauce, due to other reviews. I thought this dish was very geasy, and though my family liked it, I don't think I will make again.

Like others I used twice the amount of sauce, ricotta cheese instead of cottage and used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 mild italian sausage. It turned out fantastic. The whole family loved it and I am sure will be requesting it often. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely amazing! It's pretty much a cross between lasagna and spaghetti, so if you like both of those, this dish is probably something you'd enjoy. An instant classic at my house.

I tried this recipe exactly the way it is and found it fantastic. It was very tasty and not dry at all, I think the key is to use a good spaghetti sauce. I love dishes that will do 2 or 3 dinners, this dish freezes nicely so it has the added convenience of thaw and heat.

This is a fantastic main dish. It is even better the next day.I got this recipe about 3 years ago from a magazine I subscribe to. Everytime I prepare it I get asked for the recipe. I always make it when I am having a large group. It serves more than 8 people. Once you make this you will make it over and over.I  Serve it  with caesar salad and focaccia bread.

If I could rate this dish with 10 stars, I would. I had never heard of this dish before, and when I first saw it, I saved it not because it sounded good but just for looking interesting. I used Mids Spaghetti sauce with the sweet banana peppers and green peppers in it and probably a little extra cottage cheese since it's what I had left.. but what an AMAZING dish!! I will NEVER eat regular spaghetti again! Thanks for posting!

This was okay.  I love the idea of it and the simplicity of it but the taste was nothing too special.  I may try it again and add more sauce and maybe some sausage but it will be a while.  Easy to make ahead and pop in the oven when needed.

Overall, a very good recipe.  I agree with using a larger jar of sauce - a small jar just isn't enough. I added some chopped garlic since our family loves garlic. The 9"x13" dish almost isn't large enough...I used a 10"x15" instead.  Also, I substituted a 5-cheese Italian blend for the mozzarella.

This was good, but not great. The only substitution I made was lean ground turkey instead of ground beef; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't think it had enough flavor for me, and it took an awfully long time when I could have just made spaghetti and gotten something that tasted similar.

Yummy and easy!  I used leftover thin spaghetti noodles and leftover homemade meat sauce, and just Parmesan cheese (didn't have the others on hand)... and it came out great!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was really good stuff. I started making everything before taking the cottage cheese out of the fridge and seeing that it had gone bad. I sub'd cream cheese mixed with a little sour cream instead. I cut down on the spaghetti after reading other reviews. Used about 10 oz. instead of 16, which was just right. Added some chopped fresh basil to the sauce from my garden. Delish!

This was really tasty!  Not gourmet tasting, but definitely something yummy and appeals to lots of people.  I used a 32 oz. jar of sauce (most jars are this size now) and I seemed to have plenty for my liking, though if you like a ton of sauce, you may want to have more on hand.  A little labor intensive, but it makes two 9x11 size pans so it feeds a lot!  Reminds me a little bit like making lasagna, but spaghetti.  Oh, and I used whole wheat pasta.  You could hardly tell it was whole wheat (not always the case w/ whole wheat pastas).

If you never try this recipe you will never know what you have missed out on. I have made it three times now and followed the recipe to a tee and it came out soooo tasty. One time I made some mistakes as to when to add what ingredient so it only came out so-so. Just follow the directions as written and you will not be disappointed.

Such a easy, rewarding, flexible recipe. I am not going say the changes I made, it is repeat from others. The best comment I have to add is the flexibility in this hearty recipe. Good, quality ingredients and you can't go wrong. I ate it for dinner, then breakfast the next morning and then lunch. How's that?

I made this for dinner tonight and it is GREAT!  My daughter loves it and so does my husband.  The only thing I changed was to use two jars of spaghetti sauce and I added some mushrooms because my daughter loves them.  I served this with a salad and garlic bread sticks.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe, Louise!

Absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed, based on all of the reviews, was to use an additional can of spaghetti sauce (I used two cans of Hunt's 4 Cheese). With extra sauce we still had a firm consistency - as in, able to cut and serve with a spatula. My husband and 4 year old INHALED this the night I served it as well as for lunch the next day.  It makes quite a lot for my tiny 3-person family so we froze half of it.  It froze and reheated wonderfully the following week :)

This was the best I ever had.  Changed it a little.  I used 2 large jars of sauce, mild italian sausage, and Ricotta cheese.  My family loved it.

This dish had alot of flavor but I thought it to be a little dry.  Using a whole box of spaghetti really absorbs the sauce.  I used 2 24-oz jars of spaghetti sauce instead of one and I still thought it could use more.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, should have added more.  I placed in two 8-inch baking pans.  Will definitely make again but add more sauce.

This was really good, although I made several changes.  This is basically "pasta al forno" but uses spaghetti instead.  Being Italian, using bought sauce is unheard of so of course i made my own tomato sauce with finely chopped onions.  I also added finely chopped carrots to my sauce to increase the vegetable content for my kids, and I think the sweeter tasting sauce paired well with the dish.  Definetly needs more sauce than what it calls for.  I used spelt spaghetti to make it healthier and did not use beef since I don't eat meat.  Ricotta replaced the cottage cheese which I think makes it so much better.  I cooked the spaghetti for half the amount of time suggested on the package so the dish wouldn't be too mushy.  Baked pasta isn't supposed to be al dente but you don't want it too mushy either.  My husband who doesn't care to much for baked pasta thought it was great as well.

This is a recipe that I only make for leftover spaghetti, which sorta reinvents it. It's a little different, but only as good as the original sauce was.

I haven't actually made this recipe, but my mother used to make something very much like this. I had forgotten about it until I read this recipe. She  used about 3/4 of a pound of spaghetti and crushed canned stewed tomatoes and no ricotta or cottage cheese , just some cheddar and some mozzarella. She used to bake it until it got kind of crispy around the edges, which for me was the best part. I am now 75 years old and my Mother used to make this when I was a kid, Brings back fond memories.

This is our family's favorite recipe for baked spaghetti.  The only thing I do different is add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sauce.  A great recipe for entertaining!

This recipe was easy and so delicious!! I made 1 9x13 pan for 7 people and there was tons left over. It tasted just as good if not better the next day! I did add a bit more sauce like some of the other reviewers suggested. I will make this again when we have a big crowd! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm usually not a spaghetti eater but this was great. I opted to use ricatta cheese and mixed it in with the buttered noodles. It's too hard to spread it on top. Please double the sauce.

Yummy!  I didn't give it 5 stars, just because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I did use the cottage cheese, but I added that to the spaghetti, butter, egg, and cheese mixture.  I also used 2 jars of pasta sauce, and assembled the dish in layers: on the bottom sauce, spaghetti, sauce, cheese, spaghetti, sauce, and cheese on top.  My 3 year old, who can be quite picky especially when it comes to leftovers, loves it and has willingly eaten it several times this week.

this was very good. It is a little bland which is why the 4 stars. I didnt add any butter. I thought it was a strange thing to be in the recipe. My family devoured this up and got seconds. My husband hates cottage cheese but he did love this. I didnt have any mozz cheese, so I used cheddar blend. This makes A LOT so next time I should half the recipe. I am also going to add some spices, like maybe oregano, basil, garlic powder, and parsley.

I thought this would taste just like lasagna but it didn't.  My whole family liked it, even my 16 yo who doesn't care for spaghetti.  We did make some changes based on other reviews and what we had on hand.  I did use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and it was just enough for 1 pound of spaghetti...possibly a bit toward the dry side.  I still only used 1 pound of hamburger as we don't like a real "meaty" spaghetti.    We didn't have cottage cheese so I eliminated it.  I usually add it to my lasagna, but I liked it without.    The noodles were delicious even before we put the sauce on.  I used freshly grated parmesean which I think makes all the difference.    I will be making it again.  Will probably add green pepper and garlic to the hamburger mixture.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Very good- though I made quite a few changes & additions:  I added lots more veggies like green & red peppers, some garlic and a tomato.  I also wilted some spinach and put it in the blender with a shot of tomato sauce and some garlic to make a 'pesto' of sorts and spread that on the top of the dish, just to add some more nutrition.  I used hot italian sausage instead of ground beef, too.  And I used whole grain spaghetti for the health benefits!  I had some fresh mozzarella so i cut chunks of that and sprinkled it between layers so every so often you get a chewy chunk of cheese!  Awesome stuff, lots of great left-overs, too!

This was my first recipe that I've tried and it was great. I did, however follow others suggestions and placed 2 jars of sauce and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I also used whole wheat spaghetti and again, it was great. Thank you.

I thought this was delicious, nothing too fancy but a great quick family meal.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it wasn't dry at all.  I love cottage cheese and prefer it to Ricotta in a lot of recipes, so it was just the thing for me.  I like H**D Country Style Small Curd Cottage Cheese in the red box; it is the only brand I ever buy, and the taste is the best.  By tossing the hot spaghetti into the egg and parmesan mixture, this cooks the eggs a bit and makes the spaghetti very creamy, almost like the start of a carbonara minus the bacon.  I used a traditional sauce, not chunky, which I think helps keep it moist.  Does taste like a mock lasagne.  This was very easy and delicious.  My 5yo son helped me make it, so he also agreed.

This recipe is good but not great, I used whole wheat spaghetti and it was too dry, if I made it again I would add more spaghetti sauce.

This was perfect my family and I love it!! Great as is, but sometimes I put chopped spinach in with the cottage cheese, also I like 1/2pd spicy sausage and 1/2pd beef. I've made it a few times thanks for the recipe!

I'll be honest and say that I can't give you a review using the cottage cheese, because I substituted.  I can tell you that using the same recipe substituting sour cream is divine!  The parmesan, egg, and butter mixed with the noodles makes it really hold together and tasty.  I also double the sauce for coverage and add a little garlic and onion.  (You can always add your fave extras to taste) This makes a very full 9 by 13 dish. If you want less, use the original one sauce and cut the noodles in half.  I have made this many times now, sometimes doing meatballs instead of ground beef. Either way, this always gets a satisfied eye roll and grunt from my husband. :)  Everyone loves it!  
*Update- try it with italian sausage cut into 1 inch pieces. Cook a little to barely brown before adding to sauce.  Delicious!

This is an easy recipe and always a hit whenever I make it.  I have made a couple of modifications by omitting the ground beef and decreasing the amount of mozzarella cheese.  I also add some chopped red or green pepper and increase the sauce .  It has the tendency to be dry at times.  You won't even miss the meat.

I made it without the meat and onions and the kids devoured it -- so tasty and easy to make.  Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.  Perfect for a large group.

I gave this 5 starts because it was really good, but I did make some changes.  I made my own sauce instead of using bottled sauce and I used sausage and beef.  I also used Ricotta cheese.  One suggestion: do not put this in a regular 9x13 pan because it won't hold it.  I used 16 oz of spaghetti, as called for, and it filled up my 9x13 deep dish lasagna dish to the top.

good recipe. I did double the sauce. (nothing beats homemade spaghetti sauce) Used ricotta cheese (if you add one beaten egg to ricotta cheese,mix well, its much easier to spread evenly)

Although a little time consuming to put together, this was a sinch to make and the baking time was spot-on.  I made this for my sister and her caregiver who are not big on spicy foods.  It was perfect for Easter brunch.  I'll make this again, but definitely spice it up by using some hot italian sausage or choizo, and some fresh herbs and more italian spices.  I let this sit for over a half hour before serving, and it came out in nice, formed squares.  So if you are cooking for kiddies or those with aversions to spice, perfect as is.  For more adventurous adults, spice it up.  Thanks for sharing this, Louise.  Great family recipe.

This was pretty good...used ricotta as some reviewers recommended. Next time I will probably throw in a small can of tomato sauce or diced tomatoes. Not quite "saucy" enough for me. Others loved it as is though!

I honestly didn't think this was going to be anything special, but I tried it based upon my husband's request. He and I both loved it! So easy and lots left over to freeze. Will most def make again.   FYI: I didn't have any cottage cheese or cream cheese in the fridge, so I used nonfat yogurt instead. Turned out fine. Yummy!!!!

Ive always made my own version of this, pretty similiar but after looking up this recipe and reading reviews i decided to try it with ricotta instead of the cream cheese I normally use. BIG MISTAKE. Took alot of the creamy flavor out, much more bland, and  I use alot more seasonings, cheese and sauce then the recipe calls.

Pretty tasty. Followed the advice of others and ended up using almost 2 24 oz. jars of sauce and 1 lb. ground chicken instead of ground beef and added some minced garlic. Used about 12.5 oz of thin spaghetti and ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Will make again when we're craving comfort food.

Was a big hit with the 9-year-old. Next time I will add a bit of chopped garlic when I brown the onions and beef, and I will increase the amount of sauce slightly, as this wasn't quite saucy enough for my personal taste.  I think this will be a 5-star recipe with those minor modifications. A great alternative to plain old pasta!

This is a wonderful dish.  My whole family, little kids and all, loved it.  I did put 2 jars (48 oz total) of sauce, and I used one Marinara and one Garlic & Basil.  Otherwise, strictly followed the recipe.  It was a bit too full for a 9x13 (couldn't cover w/foil w/o the cheese touching it).  So, next time, I will use my deeper casserole dish.

i made this last night! i loved the consistency of the pasta! baking the ghetti is such a nice change to the traditional dish and is firmer and heartier! only chnage i would make is adding another lb of ground beef, seasoning the sauce or using a more expensive sauce and next time i will add mushrooms and season the pasta after i toss it in the coating!

So yummy!  I think I will cut down on some of the mozzarella cheese next time.  It was almost TOO cheesy.  I also added some fresh mushrooms to the sauce, sauteing them with the onions and meat before adding the sauce.

So good.  Enough for 8-10 people, for sure.  Put a pan under it in the oven for overflow.  Would be a great recipe to take to a friend after they have a baby or need a dish.  Bring with green beans or a salad.  Enjoy!

I followed the instructions pretty closely--didn't have season salt, so I used chili powder and salt, store bought 24oz sauce and used less ricotta and mozarella cheeses. 

Overall, it was still more cheesy than saucy. I thought it was a little bland in that sense. I know my husband will think it needs more salt. I even put garlic salt on the meat. Not sure what went wrong. 

Otherwise, it's not a bad dish if you can figure out the proper proportions. Beware--this is seriously a LOT of food. There is no way my husband and I could eat this alone. I had a tiny corner piece to try, and that's all I could manage for dinner--it's very filling. I will have to invite people over this weekend to get it eaten!

better than i thought. very easy. I added more seasoning salt. It could use more seasoning besides the salt. Other than that it was good.

We did not like this.  My kids like spagetti and do not like this-a lot of work for something no one would eat.  Will not make again.

Easy and filling!  I added Italian spices to the sauce mixture, and also used a second jar of sauce like some others did.  Will definitely make this again!

This one is a KEEPER!! Everyone loved this dish, it is FABULOUS! Delicious flavors, nice and filling, and sure to please everyone. I made mine with ricotta instead of the cottage cheese, and also added a few cloves of garlic to the meat-browning. I don't care if I ever eat traditional spaghetti again...this yummy dish will easily take it's place!

This was a great dinner.. We enjoyed it very much.. I made some changes.. I boiled 2lbs of Sweet Italian Sausage with the onion and a little beer and water.  I cut the sausage up in bite size pieces and threw them in the pot for the sauce.  Instead of the jar sauce I made 3 packages of the Spaghetti sauce in a package using the broth from the boiled sausage in place of the water required. I added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic, some Italian Seasoning, Parmesan Chz and cooked the sauce for about 45 minutes to make sure sausage was cooked.  I substituted Romano and Asiago chz for the Parm Chz. I then used some previous recommendations.  I put a little sauce down first and then the noodles.. Instead of cottage cheese I used Ricotta and then layered it accordingly..  This turned out great!!  Thanks!!!

This is one of my family's favorites! I substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese and add minced garlic to the meat while I'm browning it. Other than that, I stick to the recipe. I love this meal, and so does everyone else in my house!

This was really good even with using whole wheat pasta.  Took the suggestion of others and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and did pepper jack on top in some areas to compare.  Will definitely make again.

Made this with penne instead of spaghetti.  I put all of the meat sauce in the middle layer, and topped with a thick layer of mozzarella.  Sprinkled with basil & oregano.  Really easy, and really good.

OUTSTANDING !  The family enjoyed this very much.  Made as directed--with the additions of; 3 cloves of garlic added when browning meat--also used 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 Italian sausage.  We plan on making this for a future camping trip in a cast iron dutch oven...and it's sure to be a big hit.  Thanks so much for a great recipe

Great dish! Got rave reviews. Used ricotta, doubled the sauce. Used 2 cups of mozz and 2 cups of a shredded Italian blend cheese. Added some crushed red pepper. Leftovers didn't make it 24 hours!

This has become a weekly favourite in our household.  Absolutely LOVE this receipe.  I have made a few modifications to suit our personal taste, just seasoning the ground beef while frying up....I add Maggi, Soy Sauce and some crushed chilies.....

In a word - amazing. I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta, had to get creative and mix a regular jar of spaghetti sauce with a 14oz jar of pizza sauce, and cut up string cheese sticks on the first layer for the cheese (thought I had enough but didn't) and it STILL turned out amazing. This will be my new favorite meal!

Very tasty. Only change I made was to substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese, which I do for any pasta recipe that calls for cottage cheese. I think I'd use a bit less pasta and quite a bit more ricotta next time. Maybe use 2/3 the spaghetti and 1 1/2 times the ricotta. Everything else seemed just right. Great recipe! Thanks!

Delicious spaghetti bake!  Although I made this without cottage cheese (didn't have any), with only a little of the parm cheese (only had a tiny bit), and quite a full box of spaghetti, everything still turned out great!  My son said, "wow this is good", which isn't always the case when it comes to meal.  My hubby and I loved it as well!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

AGREE with others to season the meat.
WAY too much like butter.
WAY too much mozarella cheese.
AGREE with others that this is too much like lasagna.
Would rather just make plain spaghetti with noodles, meat, and mushroom and chunky sauce!

This recipe was great! I used to jars of spaghetti sauce because I did not want it to be too dry. Also I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese because I am not a big fan of cottage cheese. Big hit at my house!

GOOD! I really enjoyed this and so did my family - the only alterations I made was to use 1 egg and 2 Tbsp of butter - I just didn't think 5 Tbsp was necessary and it still turned out fine. Will definitely make this again - thanks for a great recipe!

Folks, this is the ONE!  This sounded good and it's so cold today here in Richmond.  SO...early this morning I decided I wanted some baked spaghetti tonight for dinner.  I was tired from shopping today so DH said he'd throw it together.  He made it just as written except for adding some Italian seasoning and a little garlic with the hamburger.  He also added a few links of Italian sausage that we had.  Other than those tiny changes, we made it as written.  (I sat and directed with my glass of cabenet in hand.)  This baked spaghetti was awesome.  My son is student teaching this semester and he asked if he could take some for his lunch tomorrow.  (As long as he brings my Gladware back, he can!)  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Thanks Louise Miller!!!

What a great dish!  I prefer using ricotta instead of cottage cheese, but both ways are good.  I love this too because, like lasagna, it can be prepared ahead of time and kept in the fridge or freezer until ready to cook.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a hit with the fam! I did do some modifications since many reviewers said this dish was bland though... I used a 12 oz bag of spaghetti instead of the 16 oz suggested and added some italian seasoning to the egg, parmesan, and butter mixture. I also used ground italian sausage instead of hamburger and used 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a bellpepper as well. I added a little garlic powder, italian seasoning, and paprika to the sauce. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and cheddar instead of the mozzarella in the middle layer. Sounds like a lot but it was very simple and ohh so good! :)

This is a combination spaghetti/lasagna recipe.  I did as several reviewers suggested and added a big jar of sauce, and even then it could have been saucier.  Also, put a thin layer of sauce down first, then the noodles.  Oh and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  This was pretty good and with just my husband and me at home now, made a ton and froze about half.  I liked that it just cut into squares.  Made some garlic bread, and there ya go!  I will be making this again with the addition of even more sauce.

Very good AS WRITTEN! I am so glad I didn't follow the other reviewer's advice of substituting ricotta for the cottage cheese! This was great AS IS. If anything, I might add a couple of other spices to the meat sauce, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Loved it! I cooked it exactly per the original recipe only I chose to seasoned the meat with a bit of onion salt and omitted the onion (just personal preference.) The cottage cheese was great. I might use a bit more sauce the next go round, but it was a huge hit that I will make again and again.

I didn't have the cottage cheese on hand, so I used cream cheese instead. It was great. As otheres noted, using 2 jars of sauce is the way to go. I ommitted the butter and used garlic sea salt instead of the seasoned salt. Kids and DH loved it. It made enough for lunch and dinner the next day and was great reheated.

I doubled the spaghetti sauce and used sour cream instead of cottage cheese - my family loved it.  I think it will be even better as a leftover.

Delicious. Modified based on reviewer comments. I used 46 ounces of my own homemade sauce and part skim ricotta cheese. I will use this recipe again and again over the long cold winter. wickedly good!

Great idea recipe.  This is a modification of a recipe my daughter has used for years to eat up left-over spaghetti and meatballs.  As stated in this great recipe, she mixes the spaghetti (usually a bit less than half the box (cooked of course) with 1 or 2 eggs, a little melted butter and 1/4 cup parmesan; then builds a fairly thin pie crust, shaping it up the sides of a pie dish; mixes the cheese (ricotta by preference) with an egg, another 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup or so grated mozzerella; add your tomato sauce of choice (she uses her own homemade favorite) and sliced up meatballs or sauteed chopmeat; layer with more sauce, another thin layer of pasta mixture, then cheese mixture, and topping with meat and sauce with a generous covering of mozzerella. She covers and bakes for 30 min, then uncovers for another 20 min. or so.  So she uses meatballs and spaghetti for two meals, both of which are really tasty.  To make this successfully, you do need lots of tomato sauce as the pasta can become too dried up.  First meal is simple meatballs and spaghetti; second is using leftovers to create a kind of spaghetti lasagne.  Great if you're on a budget.

Made this vegetarian by substituting some TVP (textured vegetable protein, Bob's Mill brand) for the ground beef. Also followed other's suggestions and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I used a 32 oz. Jar of spaghetti sauce and it was fine. The whole family loved it, even my SUPER picky daughter.

Excellent recipe!  We enjoyed the variation on a standard family dish.  I just added in some venison for a slight variation, but other than that, followed everything else as listed.  All this despite a review that just said it was "awful".

This is hands-down the best baked spaghetti recipe we've ever had - at home or restaurant.  We used ground turkey (diet restrictions) and it was still yummy.  Very satisfying and can't wait 'til leftovers tonight!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good!  My Boyfirend loved it!   I did make some changes.  I added mushrooms and green peppers which I sliced long and thin and sauteed the in EVOO together.   I added turkey pepperoni cut up to the ground beef ( or canadian bacon)  Stirrd it all in with the meet and red pepper flake and then layered!  It was a huge hit!

This is delish!  I've made it several times, but double the sauce, and use ricotta cheese, but I melt that into the meat sauce rather than layering it - made it much easier to put together.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great! I did make a couple of my own changes based on other reviews and my favorite things. I made it with whole wheat pasta, added a green pepper in the beef cooking, added minced garlic to the beef, used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.   My husband liked it so much he said it might be the best thing I've ever made. We both agree that maybe next time I would add a little extra ricotta and would like to try using the cottage cheese. I would definitely recommend using 2 jars of sauce, otherwise I think it might be too dry.

This recipe got me started.  Made a few changes.  I added green bell peppers to the mix, fresh garlic, garlic and season spaghetti sauce, and instead of ground beef, used ground turkey.  To top it off I added Italian meatballs and pepperjack for the hubby.  I also left out the all of the other cheeses.  Didn't have them handy.  Yummo!

I made this tonight for a family at church and another pan for my family. Hubby loved it! I did make some mods based on other reviews - I used ricotta cheese and increased the spaghetti sauce, BUT 2 jars is too much in my opinion. I would use 1.5 jars. A 12-13 oz. pkg of spaghetti is plenty also if that's what you happen to buy. I also think that 4 cups of cheese is WAY too much, I'd go 3 cups at the most. My husband LOVES mozzarella cheese and usually complains that there isn't enough but he was happy as a clam and I used 3 cups. The first pan I made I used hamburger, but for ours I used 1/2 lb. Italian sausage, I thought it would give it good flavor. I have to say it didn't really give it the increased flavor I thought it would, so I'd do whatever your family likes. I forgot the seasoned salt in ours and didn't really miss it. I agree with another reviewer that your flavor depends on what sauce you use. I combined a garlic sauce with a basil one for one pan and basil plus mushrooms for the other. The flavor was good in both. This makes a TON. Next time I'll use 2 pans and freeze one. Great recipe for a crowd!

My husband and his friends loved this recipe and he's not a pasta eater.  He said it was the best he had ever had.  However, I made lots of additions to kick up the flavor based on other reviews.  Here's what I added: 1. I used double the meat and doubled the sauce(still could have used a little more in my opinion) 2. Added Italian seasoning, green bell pepper, mushrooms and a can of Italian diced tomatoes to sauce. 3. Used half sharp cheddar and half mozzerella for the 4 cups of cheese.  The sharp cheddar gave it a nice zip.   4. Microwaved a pkg. of pepperoni just long enough to remove some of the grease and covered the top of the casserole with them and an extra sprinkle of cheese when I uncovered it for the last 25 minutes of cook time.  The pepperoni came out crunchy and cheesy delicious on top. With all my additions, I had to use a 15 x 10 lasagna dish and it was filled to the brim.  Next  time I make this I will try half ground beef and half spicy Italian sausage.  Also I will mix the cottage or ricotta cheese in with the noodles and egg mixture for better coverage and a better appearance.  I also think it needs more parmesan cheese.  I will sprinkle parmesan on top next time.  I think this is a great basic recipe but needs lots of additions.  I can not imagine how dry and bland it would be if you don't make some of these additions.  I hope this helps

This was great except that it was way too dry.  I will make it again but with double the sauce.  I made the recipe exactly as written except that I omitted the butter.  Great flavor.

Taste was very good!  But a little dry ... especially the next day when reheating.  Next I will add more sauce to it!  Followed recipe exactly.

This recipe is fantastic. If you like Lasagna and spaghetti, your family will love it. I didn't use the onions as my kids don't like onions and it was still fabulous! This has become a family favorite!

Myself and my family really enjoyed this recipe. I made some changes with it.  I used Italian sausage instead of the ground beef and did not use any parm. cheese.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you!

This recipe was a wonderful new take on spaghetti. My family really enjoyed it. The only change I made was adding extra sauce as other reviewers have suggested. This dish holds together really well like a lasagna and it makes a ton! We had enough for dinner the next night and it tasted just as good reheated. We will definitely be making this again.

This is likely good as is, but my taste pallet likes a bit of tang, I am crazy about tangy italian things, so I added 1/4 cup of ketchup to my meat sauce. If you like like tangy, the ketchup adds an amazing sweet tang. I will make this again!! Soon. Thank you.

Okay this recipe is incredible! No leftovers at all. I too took the advice from some of the other reviews and used extra sauce and meat. AND yes the ricotta really makes the difference. everyone in our house went through it like hoover vacumes. In our house that is rare!!Thank you for sharing this great recipe. Attention all parents your kids and family members will love this. My brother and his kids were visiting at the time and are taking a copy of the recipe back to California with them. Again thank you for sharing :)

My boyfriend really like this dish, except that it takes forever!! I did however substitue ricotta for cottage cheese, which I believe made it a little dry. I did mix the ricotta and parmesan and part of the mozzarella in with the egg before tossing the noodles, I believe it gave the noodles a full coverage of cheese. 
To the woman who said that this recipe was aweful.... I think that you need to explain why it is so!!! I mean it is called corrective criticism. I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH YOUR RATING!!!

This is so delicious.  It is a mix between traditional spaghetti and lasagna.  It is very easy to make, and taste great as leftovers.

I have made baked spaghetti for years but I believe that I like this one the best. It is definately my husbands favorite. I use cottage cheese because the ricota makes it pretty solid and not a lot of taste. I put an egg and part of the cheese into it along with salt and pepper and it is very tasty. I also put a little of the meat sauce between the spaghetti and the cheese layer,not a lot but enough to cook into the spaghetti on the bottom. It will probably be better if you let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes before serving.Great the second day!

This is SOOOO good!  I think we have it at least twice a month! I add 2-26 oz jars of spaghetti sauce and instead of seasoned salt, I add italian seasoning. I use a lasagna pan, tried it in a 9x13 once and had to clean my stove! It was definately worth is though!  It also heats up really good.

WOW!  This is the best baked spaghetti I've ever had!  Made it for my husband, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and my two toddlers.  Everyone LOVED it.  We even opted to eat leftovers the next day instead of going out to eat!  I made it exactly like the recipe says.  Will definitely be adding this to a regular rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is perfect! I loved it, my boyfriend loved it and so did my friend. My boyfriend is picky and doesn't really like speghetti, but he loved this. All the cheese makes it perfect! The only changes I made was adding fresh garlic and seasoned the beef while cooking it. It is so easy and very yummy and the left overs are great; which is great because I can bring the leftovers for lunch all week long and not have to worry about what I am going to have for lunch! Amazing recipe, 5 stars!

This was very good.  I would add garlic salt next time instead of season salt and like previous posters I added a chopped green pepper with onion and meat.  My husband raved about this for 2 days!  He doesn't normally eat leftovers, but he ate this several times over the weekend.

This was yummy.  I really liked the cottage cheese in there, even though I didn't think that I would.  I used my own sauce and cut down on the butter.

I used about half the cottage cheese and I thought it was great.  I also took the suggestions of some others and used a little less butter and about a jar and a half of sauce (this turned out to be a little more sauce than I like).  It had a great taste, though, and boy did it make a lot!

Excellent dish! I did make a few changes. Instead of ground beef, I used chopped chicken breasts and diced prosciutto. I also replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese. In lieu of mozzarella cheese, I used a mixture of monterey cheese, feta cheese, goat cheese, and gorgonzola cheese. My family of picky eaters loved it!

We really liked this recipe.  I modified it to use what i had left over in the kitchen.  Instead of cottage cheese-i used ricotta (mixed with an egg and parsley).  Instead of ground beef-i used shredded chicken (4 breasts).  i did use 2 jars of sauce with lots of garlic cloves-fresh basil & chunks of fresh tomatoes! The best part was adding a few handfuls of fresh spinach to the sauce-it gave the entire dish a great color and flavor AND it felt healthier!  I topped w/ grated Parmesan and mozzarella!!! It was wonderful-already written on a card and in my permanent box.

I had home-made sauce, so I used it and added the remaining ingredients.  Easy and had a good flavor.

It was great but I give it a four because it had way too much spaghetti.  Half the noodles and it will be awesome!  We also used Ricotta cheese.  Thank you!

This was really yummy!  I used ricotta because lots of people said they did (I usually make a recipe exactly and tweak it the second time).  It turned out really well but I think next time I'll do the cottage cheese.  The ricotta was difficult to spread evenly.  I did do tablespoon dollops all over and then spread it out, that helped some. ;) I think next time, I'll try 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozzarella too. Overall, this is a definite make again recipe!

This was fabulous! My boyfriend and i love lasagna but now we prefer this recipe instead. I did double the sauce like other reviews said. Thank you for that extra tip because without the added sauce I think it would have been way too dry.

Easy and delicious! 
I added mushrooms to saute with the onions and beef. I think I'll also throw in some Italian sausage next time.

Absolutely delicious!  Only thing I added was some fennel seed and some Italian seasonings to the spaghetti sauce/beef mixture.  My kids helped me make it.  My oldest said it was her new favorite meal and my picky eater enjoyed it as well.  My husband said it was a definite comfort food and had a hard time stopping.  This will be my go to dish to take to people when they need a meal.  Thanks so much for sharing.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is good, but I'll still be searching for other baked spaghetti recipes.  I made half the recipe and it was still a lot of food, especially for one person.  I used tomato and basil spaghetti sauce and whole wheat spaghetti.  I added about a tablespoon of Italian spices to the beef.  I didn't have onion, so I used two tablespoons of minced dried onion.  I also used a mix of prepackaged pizza cheese and mozzarella cheese.  I layered pepperoni slices across the top to make it a "pizza top baked spaghetti".

I may be in the minority here but I think this dish could use quite a bit less cheese.  I still gave it 5 stars because it is delicious, just next time I make it I will probably cut the mozzarella by at least half.  Great comfort food!

Turned out very well!  Didn't have a pound of spaghetti, so I put some macaroni in too...  Worked out well.  Doubled the sauce like I saw on here and it may have been just a little too saucy...  Other than that, it was very, very good.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was good but I didn't think it was as good as everyone else was saying on here. I was a little disappointed actually. My boyfriend and his son just thought it was OK too. I don't know if I would make this again although it was very easy to make.

Great recipe..I cut the recipe in half since it was for 2 with plenty left over.. If you don't care for the chunckiness of cottage cheese, I mashed mine with a fork and added half of the egg mixture to it. I already had that in my fridge and it turned out just like ricotta.

I made this vegetarian friendly - and a bit healthier - using tofu crumbles instead of beef. The second time I made it, I used an extra 1/2 jar of sauce and preferred this proportion. It's one of those dishes that just might taste better reheated one the second day. Hearty and delicious for a crowd.

Pretty good. I used Italian sausage and ricotta instead of ground beef and cottage cheese. I wanted more red sauce and less ricotta and sausage. Also, for a family of 4 I would cut this recipe in half.

This tasted pretty good to me, so that's the important part.  However kids didn't appreciate the effort compared to regular spaghetti (a 15 minute meal), in fact they were disappointed.  Also, this makes a TON of food.  For my family of five, I could halve it and still have leftovers.  I couldn't fit the whole top layer in my standard 9x13, I had to leave some out of the final product.  Will not make again, though it would be a decent meal for a large group of people.

This baked spaghetti was very good. Next time I make it I will use more than one jar of sauce. I also used half cottage cheese and half ricotta since I did not have enough cottage cheese in the fridge.

Great Italian recipe to serve to the masses. I would reccommend using more sauce or less pasta. I added 3/4 minced garlic cloves and an extra 1/2 cup or so of cottage cheese. Ricotta cheese is a perfect substitute for the cottage cheese. Be careful, this will barely fit in a traditional 13x9.

Serve with garlic bread and merlot and invite the masses.

Very good and quick meal to make on a week night. I did not use cottage cheese. I had cream cheese. It really made the dish creamy. Be sure to have enough pasta sauce for the topping. I did not cover the top completely and the pasta in the sides dried out a bit. Very good dish that I will be making again!

This recipe was very good.  To satisfy my families taste I added ½ teaspoon of minced garlic to the sauce mix.  Also, after I uncovered to bake the additional 20-25 minutes I added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese on the top.  My teenage daughter loved this.  This is a keeper.

Thank you for this great recipe!  My 2 very picky boys ask for 3rd helpings of this. I used egg noodles instead and I used a 4 Cheese Mexian Reduced Fat cheese by Sargento. This is a keeper.

I think this recipe makes way more than 8 servings.  I would double the spaghetti sauce, cut the mozzarella in half, add some garlic and use ricotta cheese.

My mom and I made this as a family meal. It was super fun to put together -- we each assigned little jobs and then at the end we layered it together and stuck it in the over -- and on top of that, it was GREAT. We made it as is except we doubled the sauce after I read the reviews. I'm thinking about remaking it tonight only use spaghetti squash this time (and likely make a smaller amount!)

Yum!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  It was delcious!  The only downside was it took a long time to prepare.  Maybe i'm really slow, but it took me an hour to put together.  As long as i have the time, i'll be making this again and again for my family!

This was really good. And it made a ton! It fed 7 people, inlcuding 5 big guys and there was still leftovers! I did add about 1/2 a jar more sauce per the previous reviews and it was perfect.

Should have thought ahead and undercooked the pasta since it gets baked for an hour. Nothing worse than (very) overcooked pasta--tasted like Chef Boyardee.

Winner!  I made two of these to take to a carry-in dinner - they disappeared in a flash and I got no less than 6 requests for the recipe.  I added assorted seasonings to the sauce but the main change I made was to reduce the mozzarella from 4 cups to 2 - and still got rave reviews.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of butter as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I did not have enought cottage cheese, I used Kraft 4-cheese instead of mozerella and it was still wonderful. It is a very forgiving recipe!  Made plenty and everyone loved it!

This was really delicious, and a great recipe for using up leftovers!  I made this with what I had on hand: I had less than a pound of leftover cooked spaghetti that I just heated up in the microwave; I had some leftover cooked chicken that I ground up; and 4 cups of leftover (notice a trend? :)) homemade tomato sauce.  All other quantities were as written, and it turned out awesome!  We are a "saucy" family, so we almost always add more sauce to a recipe, but I would gladly make this with the correct ingredients, and I'm sure it would be great!

I made this for dinner lastnight. My sister in-law made a recipe like this for the whole family a couple of years ago and my husband loved it. So when I told him I came across what seemed like the same recipe he was stoked. I wasn't so sure about how the final product came out, not sure if it's the same recipe or not. The only change I made was adding an additional 1/2 jar of sauce, because it was left over and needed to be used up. I, like another reviewer, thought this was pretty greasy and I attribute that to the amount of cheese in the dish. This recipe divided into 8 servings equals 1/2 c. cheese per serving, not counting the cottage cheese, which equals a lot of fat. We used extra lean ground beef, reduced fat cottage (that's the only kind I buy) and Ronzoni fortified pasta (which is also all I buy for the extra fiber, makes it a little healthier). The dish also came out pretty watery, despite other's reviews of it being dry. I think it will be better on day 2, and actually might have been better to make ahead and refridgerate before baking so the spaghetti would absorb some of the moisture. This also created a lot of dirty dishes and was kind of time consuming, not sure if I'll use this recipe again.

I agree with most everyone else - after making this tonight, it definitely needs more sauce/beef filling.  Either that or cut the pasta and mozzarella by half (which is probably a better idea unless you want to feed an army).  I imagine the leftovers are going to be very dry and will need extra sauce on them.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the flavor and the convenience were both excellent!  I made it with just the one jar of spaghetti sauce and I think I would like it better (for moisture) if I used two.  As a matter of fact, we're having it for supper tonight and I can't wait.  Yum, yum!!!!!

This was yummy!  It took longer than just making plain spaghetti, but I love mozzarella so it was worth the wait.  My husband said it tasted like lasagna!  This recipe is great when you need a break from routine.

Very good recipes, Kids enjoyed it.  Made two smaller batches and froze one.

I thought it would hold together better because of the eggs, like a spaghetti pie, but no matter, it was good.  The process reminded me of making baked ziti or lasagna, but not as time consuming as lasagna.

I added garlic to my onion and meat....it's such a versatile recipe...so many options.

Looking forward to making this for company!

Pretty good! My family was tired of plain spaghetti, so this was a nice change. I used two cups more spaghetti sauce than the recipe called for, a couple of cloves of fresh garlic in the sauce and chopped up some peperoni and added to the sauce also. My family loved it!

I always use both ricotta cheese and cottage cheese.  I also add extra seasonings to the meat while I'm browing it.  My husband and I love this dish and the leftovers don't last long at all.

this recipe is HUGE! It made 4 meals for 2 adults and a toddler and I feel we we're over eating :) I made it into one main pan and then 3 smaller ones that I could freeze. this recipe freezes well and tastes absolutly amazing! My family LOVES it. I used riccota instead of cottage cheese just because we prefer it. Best spaghetti I have ever tasted!

Wowzers!  This was fantastic!  Super creamy and cheesy.  I split this between two smaller 8 inch square dishes and froze one and baked the other.  Our small family would never finish an entire dish!  Loved this recipe!

This is very good.  I made it half with meat and half without meat, my husband said that it is so-so without meat.  But when he tried the side with meat, he said it tasted like lasagna.  I did cut back on some of the mozzarella cheese.

Good but not great; mostly blah.  I followed other reviewers and doubled the sauce, used only 12oz of spaghetti, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and wound up with a  moutain of pasta with little zing. Should have used a spicier sauce or added more seasongs. On the plus side it feed almost 20+ people!

YUM. I was looking for a yummy dinner that would utilize the cottage cheese in my fridge, and this recipe sounded deliicious. It did not let me down! I used just one jar of spaghetti sauce, like the recipe calls for, and thought that was plenty! It was super wet/flavorful. I didn't have ground beef on hand, but I used a little italian turkey sausage and browned that with the onion. I only used about a cup of mozarella, but thought it was plenty cheesey! Love the cottage cheese addition. Thanks so much, I just had dinner and I'm already craving more! My husband and I have enough for leftovers all week!

Bland. Needs more spice. A little salt, garlic, red pepper should make this taste better.

This recipe is FANTASTIC with a couple of modifications. 1) I did use the full 16 ounces of spaghetti, but I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the amount of spaghetti sauce. 2) Rather than just draining the fat off the ground beef & onion mixture I poured it into a colander and rinsed it thoroughly with water after cooking. This is a great way to minimize the amount of fat in your cooking. It does cool off the beef, but it doesn't matter because you're about to pop it in the oven!
 3) In response to other reviewers' comments about lack of flavor I roasted 10-12 cloves of garlic, sliced them, and added them to the meat sauce. I also added a generous amount of garlic powder & onion powder to the sauce. (we love garlic in my household!) 4) I substituted fat free ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. I'm sure this recipe is excellent when you follow the directions to the letter, but my boyfriend and I BOTH went back for seconds when I made it with these modifications. It was FULL of flavor, and we can't wait to dig in to the leftovers. As I'm writing this review I'm contemplating eating it again for breakfast. That's how good it is! I hope this review helps. Happy cooking! :)

Awesome! I used more like 3/4 box pasta, no onion (used onion powder instead), used ricotta cheese, no cottage cheese, used a combo of shredded mozzarella & provolone. Also used 2 jars of sauce, one with meat and one without. I did not use the season salt, didnt seem necessary. I did add some italian seasonings. This made a huge pan, I was able to freeze half of it and even when we ate it later it was just as delicious as when it was fresh out of the oven! Great recipe!!!!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I did not use the cottage cheese and didn't layer it either.  It was delicious.  Will be making it again.

Family of 4 wasn't too impressed with this recipe.  I used racotta cheese in place of cottage cheese.  Added more sauce, garlic and basil to this dish.  After purchasing all the ingredients I should have just made good old Lasagna!

This is SO good! And tastes even better as leftovers. I added more spices to the ground beef while cooking, like garlic, italian seasoning, and pepper. I also added some italian seasoning to the spaghetti mixture. I used 2 jars of sauces and it came out with just enough sauce. I don't think 1 jar would be enough for our tastes, anyway.

Pretty good.  Like others, I omitted butter and didn't toss noodles in cheese.  I also baked uncovered for 40 minutes.  It still turned out great.    It could stand garlic, 2# sausage/hamburger mix, definitely twice the sauce.  I used 1-1/2 jars and it needed 2 for sure.    All in all, fast, easy & great.

This was a hit in my house! I actually made it with elbow macaroni which worked really well. I also froze half of it and ate it a few weeks later. It was just as good the second time around. This is a keeper!

An easy recipe to put together.  Makes a *huge* amount; after cooling I sliced into portions for easy freezing.  I do recommend adding a couple of tablespoons of extra sauce to to each container if you're going to freeze it.  I did add an additional appx. 12 - 14 ounces of sauce  to what the recipe called for, but still found it a little dry.  Next time I'll also throw in a clove or two of minced garlic with the onion and maybe some oregano ... it was a little bland for my taste.  I don't know that the cottage cheese added anything, so the next time I may leave it out/substitute ricotta instead.  I broke the spaghetti noodles in half before cooking them, which I probably won't do the next time, although I doubt it made much difference.  All in all, a good basic recipe that is easy to put together, freezes well and tastes good.

Sooooo yummy! Made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was so good! To reheat though, I'd add a little more sauce before you toss it in the microwave. But reheats good too. Yum!

My husband and I really enjoyed this. It is very tasty. I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese and did't add the sauce to the pan, I just used it when layering the casserole and poured it on then. I will definitly be making this again! FYI- you'll have lots of left overs.

Great Recipe, but I wouldn't double the amount of sauce like the first review said - It barely fit the 9x13 as is. I substituted the spaghetti with left over spaghetti squash which turned out excellent, and a bit healthier to make up for the amount of cheese.

Only gave it four stars due to some changes I made based on the other feedback that are absolutely crucial.  I like garlic in my spaghetti so I sauteed with the onions.  Excellent suggestions on the ricotta cheese!!  Absolutely needed to double the sauce.  If you've made spaghetti before add a little of the normal seasoning that you would in your recipe, it needs it.  I also tried this with ground turkey for a little healthier version and was just as good.  This recipe isn't a bad starter but you will absolutely want to tweek a bit.

In concept this is pretty good idea, but I think if I were to try this one again I would use a bit smaller of a cassarole dish. The layers get pretty thin as you make it. And in the end it tastes more of just pasta. Maybe also use 12 oz of pasta rather than 16.

I thought this was yummy!  I personally would've added more spaghetti sauce and I also had a mixture of ricotta and cottage cheese w/ parsely to add a little flair!

The end result is worth every minute of the prep time. It tastes great, it's satisfying, and we could feed a football team with it. Great recipe. (I put a layer of meat sauce as the first layer as recommended by other reviewers. Cuts just like a lasagne.)

This was delicious! I made a couple of changes, because I am a vegetarian and on a budget. I used rotini noodles instead of spaghetti, and added a green bell pepper and a little garlic to the onions. I also halved the cheese. It was so good and filling, and the best part was the casserole only cost $5.00 to make and we have leftovers to take for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe states. I thought it was delicious, but my family said it was way too dry. Next time I will have an extra pan of sauce for those who want to add it on top.

my kids love baked Spaghetti. I occasionally go without the ground beef and I always use cheddar, parmesan and Feta cheese in mine. I also dont use any eggsor butter but I think I just might try it this way next time. Thanks

I made this last night for some out of town guests. I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and and another jar of sauce since I prefer a wetter baked spaghetti. All in all it was really good! You can even dress it up for with green peppers and mushrooms in the sauce.

Very good and filling.  I, like other reviewers, used ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese.  Serving size very generous - we could use 1/16th of the baked dish per person with a veggie and roll.  Plan to make it again soon!

Whoa this was so tasty!  The only changes I made were that I used ground turkey, and I added about 1/2 jar more sauce than called for.  I think it would have been too dry had I not done that.  Delicious and (relatively) easy.

This was awesome!!  I made my own spaghetti sauce with garlic, tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini.  I also left out the butter, but that was a mistake as I ended up needing to use more egg and parmesan to coat the spaghetti, and I think that made it a little too thick.  But no less yummy!

This is DELICIOUS....I use EXTRA sauce before I layer the meat and cheese, I spread sauce over the spaghetti.  My kids LOVE it and the egg/butter/parm. mixture keeps the pasta moist and tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe!  As for the meat, I just season my own way, not with seasoned salt.  (At times I leave out the cottage cheese, the kids and I like it, hubby doesn't).

I actually made quite a few changes to this recipe (none that would affect its rating  except one). First, I used Smart Taste spaghetti noodles to give it a healthier side. Second, I used Ragu 'Light" spaghetti sauce to make it even more healthy.  Third, I left out the Parmesan cheese (husband hates the taste) and let whoever wanted it, add it after the spaghetti was done.  Fourth, I used "light" butter. Fifth, I took other reviewers advice and used part skim ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I think that was all I changed but the only reason that I gave it a four was because of the changes in cheese (everything else was my personal changes). The taste was marvelous! I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Drop the butter and cottage cheese and replace with 1 tablespoon olive oil and ricotta cheese.  Please double the pasta sauce to about 2 (26oz.) jars.  I also used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and garlic instead of the onion.  If you have a small family make only half the recipe because made as is this will serve about 10 people, unless you eat large portions then it will serve 6 to 8.

Not my favorite recipe.  I thought it had way too much cottage cheese.  I would much rather have good old fashioned lasagna.

Yummy! I am actually making this for the second time tonight. Its easy and cheap to make. I do not eat meat so i just do it without and it is still good. I just add more sauce than what is called for. I also make my own sauce with 2 large cans of tomatoe sauce and i small paste then add spices, onion, and garlic. I also add salt and pepper. 4 1/2 stars!

Outstanding - it didn't seem like there was enough sauce or cheese, but it ended up being perfect.  Next time I'm going to sub Ricotta for the cottage cheese, and maybe add some green peppers and mushrooms.  Absolutely deee-lish, and really easy to make!

It's great for what it is. Also happens to be a fantastic use for leftover pasta and sauce so the hubby and kids don't get bored. Throw some pepperoni on top, too. Yum yum.

I loved this recipe. However, my husband (who is not big on anything with "mushy" ricotta) said it was fine, but he prefers regular spaghetti. The changes I made were: used 13-oz box of spaghetti, used 2 jars of sauce, only used one cup of ricotta. If I make it again, I will use one reviewer's suggestion and substitute 1 cup of sour cream for the 2 cups ricotta.

Wow this was yummy! I actually tried to cut down on the fat and substituted with several things. Used fat free cottage cheese, 2% italian cheese (only used 2 cups), reduced fat parmesean and egg beaters. I also used two jars of spagetti sauce and it really was needed. Make sure to spray foil with nonstick cooking spray. Also added fresh parsley and lots of garlic to the meat mix. Made a ton and bet it will taste even better tomorrow!

My family really enjoyed this dish.  The only things I did differently was used a large size jar of spaghetti sauce, and only 2 c. of mozz. cheese. That worked out great.  Next time I might try macaroni in place of the spaghetti.

Recipe came out very tasty. The only thing I will do next time is to add red pepper flakes. For just the two of us, the recipe made enough to freeze for later.

Did not try with the cottage cheese used Ricotta right from the start.  The only thing I will do next time is I will be adding some garlic to the onions and beef.  That is the only thing I really missed in this dish.  Otherwise wonderful!!!

Loved this baked spaghetti.  However I used sour cream instead of the riccota cheese.  Still came out great, and my husband loved it.

I love spaghetti.  This was great.  Would def NOT double sauce.  This was almost too much to fit into the pan suggested.  I will add more salt and use slightly larger dish next time.  I will be saving this one!

We made this with leftover sauce, and a bit extra cheese. We added extra veggies (olives and mushrooms) and it held together very well! We've actually had it twice now, and there are never any leftovers!!

This was very good and I really liked how it held together almost like a lasagna!  My husband is extremely picky so I had to used a small amount of dried minced onions instead of the fresh, but other than that, followed it exactly.  Turned out really well and will be adding this into our regular "meal menu" :o)

An absolutely delicious spaghetti casserole recipe; it got many compliments on how good it tasted and how it wasn't too thick. I halved the recipe since I was cooking for four people and dialed up the temperature to cook: 375 degrees instead of the 350. I omitted the cottage cheese and actually made my own spaghetti sauce in place of the canned spaghetti sauce called for in the recipe. Get one can of crushed tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce and cook those in a pot on medium heat with two tablespoons of olive oil until it begins to boil (about 4 – 5 minutes). After it starts, add in two to three tablespoons of sugar, one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of pepper, and a sprinkle of dried parsley. Let that cook for another 3 – 4 minutes while stirring occasionally. This is the new sauce base to add your cooked ground beef and onions into. For the assembled casserole, I put it in to cook for about 30 minutes and everything came out perfectly. Cheese was melted and the consistency was great. Just use one solid sheet of foil to cover the pan though; I used two and the bottom one drooped to touch the cheese and that got a little messy. I will try this recipe next time with the cottage cheese or ricotta like some reviewers have been mentioning. Great dish for hungry appetites and will definitely please a wide audience.

I choose not to add onion, since no one in my house cares for onions. Otherwise, I don't change a single thing. You simply can't mess it up, and the pickiest of kids (including mine) gobble it up. It also makes easy leftovers that you can just throw in the microwave. I've experimented with different flavored sauces as well, whatever fits your family's taste.

My picky family enjoyed this recipe.  I actually used 2 9x13 dishes instead of layering the recipe.  I left out the ricotta/cottage cheese, and doubled the sauce as suggested by another reviewer.  I froze the second dish.  I will make this every month!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Was terrfic!!!! This makes way more than 8 servings. I skipped the cottage cheese because my children dont like the texture when they eat it, but added more cheese to replace it. It turned out great. And everyone loved it.

Great recipe. The only thing I do differently is I make the sauce from scratch just because we like it so much better than the jar. I use tomato sauce, tomato paste, onions, and Italian stewed tomatoes. I let it simmer for about 30 minutes and then follow the rest of the recipe. We love this dish and it is very easy to make. Good twist on spaghetti!

This was tasty comfort food on a winter evening, and a good way for me to use up the cottage cheese I had.  I added a clove of garlic and dried oregano, and I used TVP instead of beef.  My whole wheat box of spaghetti was only 13 oz, and I used about 50% more sauce than the recipe calls for ~ this made it rather soupy!  Next time, if using the smaller box of pasta, I would only use one jar of sauce.

This was ok.... definately need 2 jars of sauce or it would be too dry. I also used wheat pasta and ground turkey. I sustituted ricotta chees for the cottage cheese. Don't use too much ricotta cheese unless you like it. Also don't use a whole onion, it makes a lot. Will have to play wit this to make it taste more appealing to me

We call this "Baked Spaghetti PERFECTION" in my house!!!  Doubled the sauce, used ricotta instead... PERFECT!!!  Sits up better if given a few minutes 'rest' in the pan before serving.

Had to make some changes to this recipe to jazz it up a bit or else it would've been BORING!  I added mushrooms, green peppers and substituted Yves ground round for the ground beef.  I also added a tsp or so of oregano.  I used whole wheat pasta, which doesn't taste as good as the regular pasta but its a lot healthier, so the trade off is up to you.  Either way, this was a good base to a recipe but by itself, it would've been just blah.

This is a keeper.  Hubby and school-age boys all liked this one.  
I added a couple cloves of garlic to the sauce and only used 2 cups of mozerella (all on the top.)
Also, this makes a LOT.  We had over half the pan left.  It was very good rewarmed the next day, but can only eat leftovers for lunch for so long - may halve the recipe next time.

I made just a few changes to make this slightly healthier including using whole wheat spaghetti and ground turkey. I also cut the butter to 3 tbsp and can't say I would have noticed any difference. This was rich and delicious, definitely a keeper.

This recipe was delicious.  I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  This recipe got rave reviews from both couples I had over for dinner.  Their 4 year old also loved it!

Great kid-friendly family meal.  Seemed a little noodle-y so next time I will either halve the amount of noodles or double all of the other ingredients, depending on how many I'm feeding.  This will make a great make-ahead-and-freeze dish for the time after my baby is born.

I didn't change much on this recipe. I omitted the seasoning salt and extra butter. I used a jarred sauce I got on the cheap when I had a good couponing day that I jazzed up with extra spices, fresh minced garlic and a glug of red wine. I used "trim" cottage cheese. For me, it reminds me of the church speghetti that we used to have for Youth Group feeds or church potlucks. The boys really liked it, as it's super hearty and stick to your ribs. It did come out a little dry and I didn't like the flavor the eggs added. Next time, I'd cut the spaghetti in half, omit the eggs and add in some sauteed fresh veggies, like mushrooms, peppers, zucchini and spinach. It's not awful, but it can be made more personal to fit your own families tastes.

This was good but nothing to write home about.  I agree with other reviewers that it definitely needs more sauce, which I think would move it up to five stars instead of just four.  I will try it again using more sauce and probably sour cream to give it some more punch.  I did add two large garlic cloves and chopped green pepper to the hamburger or it would have been way too bland, so I will include that the next time as well.

This was pretty good.  I used half Italian sausage and half beef and added minced garlic to the meat mixture.  I also put in some sauted mushrooms.  Easy to assemble and tasted good.

I think this recipe is very good.  I was impressed.  The only thing I would change is to use less noodles so it's a bit saucier.  I made according to recipe (cut down to 5 servings).  The only thing I changed was instead of melted butter, I used olive oil (a bit healthier) and it came out great.

Didn't change much (more sauce, extra cheese), but our family didn't think this was anything special from regular stovetop spaghetti.  You could make this on the stovetop without drying it out in the oven heat (even though I added more sauce), which is what I think did this recipe in for us.  This would be great made on the stove leaving out a few ingredients (like the eggs).  The oven is not needed, in my humble opinion.  So made on the stove, I would rate this a good four stars, but in the oven, I would give it two.  So I give it three stars overall.  Others seem to like it, so it's worth trying!  :)

This was a wonderful recipe!  There was SO much food to begin with, it would not all fit in a 13x9x2 pan!  I had to separate it out into two!  I will DEFINITELY make this again...for a pitch-in or family gathering or something.  It is very simple and very tasty!

Great!! Everyone loved it. I used 1 cup cottage cheese (all I had), and 1 package of cream cheese (soften first, then place in saucepan with 1/2 cup milk, stirring frequently until creamy). We use cream cheese in place of a lot in pasta dishes, and it makes it much richer. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is delicious!  I used a large 44 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and added about 3/4 of the jar.  I could have used the whole jar if the pan would hold it.  I also followed one reviewer's suggestion and used ricotta cheese.  We will definitely make this again, and I might try a larger pan next time.

Im giving this recipe 3 stars because it needs more flavor and the noodles wanted to stick together at the bottem. It's an easy recipe to make but nothing special about it. It's not one that I would make again.

Great starting recipe...I agree that either less pasta or more sauce needs to be used, if it weren't for that I would have given 5 stars. The only change I made was to add fresh mushrooms and it was great.  Next time I will decrease amount of pasta and maybe add some other veggies.

I'd never baked spaghetti before - this was wonderful. But be forewarned:  it makes a lot!  I used VERY chunky tomato sauce (I cooked up zucchini, mushroom, onion and garlic to add to jarred sauce) and so by the time I got it all arranged, it was heaping full above the rim of the 13x9 pan.  I also used thickly-sliced mozz for the layers.  A winner!

Good but not great.  I followed the directons exactly except added a can of sliced mushrooms.  Don't think I'll try this again as the family said they would prefer normal everyday spaghetti.

I've been making a version of this for awhile now.  I usually make too much spaghetti and have some meat sauce left over so I make this recipe with the leftovers and freeze it for another day.  When we unthaw it and bake it, it almost tastes better than the original meal!

This is a pretty good baked spaghetti.  I used Newman's Own Marinara for the sauce.  I also added about 2 Tbsp. minced green pepper, it added a great depth of flavor.

This recipe is wonderful!  My fiance loves it, and has requested it many times since I first tried it last month.  I don't like cottage cheese, so I substituted with sour cream.  It keeps the dish moist, without a strong flavor.  Very easy to make, and stays great in the fridge for several days.  Easy lunch time reheat!  Definately one to keep!

This was great!  I used whole wheat spaghetti, omitted the cottage cheese, used shredded Muenster instead of Mozzarella, and added a handful of Italian bread crumbs over the first sauce layer.  Delicioso!

This is a really great recipe, my husband and daughter really loved it!!! The only thing I did different was use spicy Italian saugage instead of ground beef, we like a little spice in things. This will be the alternative to regular spaghetti from here on out, thanks.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!!!  I added some extra sauce but otherwise followed the directions exact and we served it for some neighbors.  It was a big hit with all, even the kids.  I will be making this regularly.

I changed the spaghetti to ziti and used all Fat-free cheeses, and it was still delicious!  My family liked it too, so I'll definitely repeat this.

Big hit in my house!  I used half as much butter and half as much mozarrella cheese with good results.  I also used my husband's homemade pasta sauce, which we prefer.  Easily enough to feed 6 of us for dinner, with ample leftovers.

I made this for my boyfriend recently and he absolutely loved it.  There wasn't much left over and what was didn't stay that way for long.  I will definitely make it again.  I used more mozzarella than called for to make it extra cheesy and also added sauteed mushrooms and zucchini for more flavor.

This was very delicious! I skipped the cottage cheese since my husband doesn't like it and just added a little more mozzarella. I also added one can of tomato sauce. I have a family of 7 and everyone had seconds and there were still leftovers! It makes a lot! Great for serving when you have company with a nice salad and some garlic bread! Will definately make again.

After reading the reviews I changed the recipe a bit. I added more sauce and seasoning, but not as much butter and it turned out well. The basic recipe is very good but Everyone's taste is different so you can take any recipe and change it to what you like. For me overall this was good!

Made this last week for family and friends and it was a bid hit. Made it again today and took it to our lodge for a potluck. Again it was a big hit. The only thing I changed was I used 12 oz of pasta vs 16. This is definitely a keeper at our house.

Could have gone with less spaghetti noodles. Used 2 jars of sauce. Flavored up with Italian seasonings. Also needs more cottage cheese to spread or ricotta. Could use a little more seasoning also

This is the ultimate comfort food.  Always a hit in our family.  My son has Celiac so we use gluten free spaghetti and it comes out delicious.  We also use Ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

This was a big hit with the teens and they are still talking about how good it was!  Haha.  I used two jars of sauce, with some on the bottom, and ricotta cheese instead of the cottage.  Simple, family recipe that went over very well!

This is the dish that makes family, funeral and church rounds.  Its so simple, fairly easy to throw together and oh so cheesy good.  I don t add anything or take anything away. It stands on its own merits.

I've made this many times and it is by FAR the best baked spaghetti I've had. All I did different was add garlic & a little extra sauce. I'm often generous with the Parmesan too.  SO GOOD!!

Delicious! I made the following adjustments - added minced garlic and italian seasoning to the beef/onions  while cooking and added some extra sauce. Made for a great meal with lots of leftovers!

I make this at least twice a month...I also add mushrooms and sometimes top with turkey pepporoni.  It's a huge hit in my family!  You can even freeze it too and is just as good later.

Cook your spaghetti noodles about half the time you normally do or they will be overcooked and mushy.

This is a great recipe!  I only gave it 4 stars but I'm sure if I liked cottage cheese it would definitely be a 5 star rating!  I substituted the cottage cheese for a recipe of bechamel and to me, that was absolutely perfect!!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!  The bechamel is made with 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup flour, 4 1/2 cups milk, pinch of nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste.  "Toast" the flour/butter mixture in a pot, careful not to burn it. Warm up the milk and gradually add to the flour mix bringing it to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 min. Season with nutmeg, salt and pepper.

love love LOVE!!! This recipe was delicious. I am a college student who loves to cook and I'm always looking for simple new things to try and this was perfect. After reading the reviews I halved the recipe, as I am only feeding myself and sometimes my roommates, but I kept the amount of sauce the same and had no problems with it being dry. I also have roommates who don't particularly like onion, so I left that out and instead seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (about 1/4 tsp of each). Needless to say it turned out DELICIOUS! This is definitely a permanent addition to my recipe book.

This was delicious! I did add an additional small can of sauce and about 1 cup of chopped onions, and I now think that is a MUST-- I could actually have added a bit more sauce. I subbed Ricotta for the cottage cheese, and italian seasoning, garlic powder, and regular salt for the seasoned salt. Here is some advice-- use a little MORE than half of the sauce for the bottom layer, or even put a tad on the bottom of the pan first. I found that the bottom layer of spaghetti sort of stuck together and became sort of dry. Maybe even toss the bottom layer with a bit of sauce after it's tossed with the egg mixture. Either way, this was a wonderful base recipe and can be modified to your personal preferences. Next time, I'll be adding bell peppers and mushrooms. Thanks Louise! This is definitely going to be a recipe I use again.

This was absolutely delicious! I took the advice of other reviews and made half the recipe. There was still tons left over. I was feeding 4. I also spiced up my sauce with parsley, oregano, basil, etc. I didn't have ricotta so I just used cottage cheese, mozzerella, and cheddar. I also add really finely chopped, onion, mushrooms and green pepper to the sauce. The whole family loved it. We had caesar salad too.

We followed some suggestions left by others. We added another bottle of sauce (well 1/2 a bottle) and we also split the cottage cheese in half and added Ricotta cheese for the other half. We also added some other spices to the sauce since it tasted pretty bland. 

Will make this again.

I noticed many people with low reviews complained that it was too bland. I added spices until the meat/sauce mixture tasted amazing and I couldn't keep my boyfriend away from it. I don't have amounts for the seasonings but I added tons of garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and Onion powder blend. I loved it. My boyfriend took the rest out to camp and they devoured it. Only gave 4 stars because without adding spices it probably would have been pretty boring. I also needed more sauce than the recipe called for.

Made this for my family of 3, and it was enough to feed us for 3 nights. It went over great, and I will make it in the future. Like everyone said, I used two jars of sauce. Subbed ground turkey for the beef, which was yummy, but bland. Will try the Italian seasoned ground turkey next time, and maybe a little less cheese.

This was very good- kids 8 and 11 and husband all thought it needed more sauce.  Better the next day.  I made as directed except I put it in two 8x8's instead of a 9x13 and froze one.

This review is based on suggested modifications to the recipe. I would have given this 2-stars without the modifications below.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, saute the onions and peppers until softened. Use one large green pepper (instead of 1 cup). While sauteing the onions/peppers, spread ground beef thinly across a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper (important step). Add ground beef to the skillet and cook until brown. Add Italian diced tomatoes,
mushrooms and oregano. Increase tomatoes to one 28 oz. can and add one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. Use only 8 oz. of sliced white mushrooms (canned mushrooms not necessary). Simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.

To the bottom layer of pasta mix:
Mix one large egg and a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Place half of the cooked spaghetti into a prepared 9"x13" dish and top with egg mixture (better bottom crust). Continue topping with 1/2 of the meat mixture. Combine 1 1/2 cup of the mild Cheddar and 1 1/2 cup of Mozzarella cheeses. Sprinkle half the cheese over the first layer. Repeat. In a medium bowl, mix together cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup water until smooth; pour over casserole.
Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.

Important - If you don't season your ground beef as directed above, this casserole will have little taste.

Next time, I'll try replace the beef for sausage and add basil.

This recipe was easy and great for the kids.  I thought I would try to make less of it but still came out having a ton of left overs!!  (which usually happens always)   Substitute the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese..and used onion powder in my meat and also in my sauce!!  And added medium shredded cheddar.  So a little bit bland not too bad.  Next time I will use more salt and more sauce!!

This was GREAT!  Everyone loved it.  I did however use more sauce than recipe called for.  In fact we used 2 jars of Paul Newman's Sokcarooni. As of 12/4/11 
I have made this recipe 5 times.  I still use 2 jars of sauce, when frying my ground beef I use chopped onion as well as 2 cloves of garlic minced.  I never use the seasoned salt.  I use Ricotta Cheese (instead of cottage cheese) We like mozzarella cheese so I use 6 cups.  I also use my larger lasagna pan because a 9 x 13 is just not big enough.  This has truly been a hit with everyone I have made it for.

I Loved the recipe. I made a small change which was the seasoning. I used my own little mixture of seasonings.  I also doubled the sauce and seasoning. I made this for my daughter and my lady and they loved every bit of it, and i also had more then half left over. I sauced the bottom of my pan and also added extra sauce to the top of the dish. A great dish and a great dish you could experiment with.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make.  I  used half ground beef and half Italian sausage, and it gave it a wonderful flavor.  I used approximately 2 jars of sauce, as I didn't want it to be dry.  This makes ALOT, so next time I make it, I will half the recipe. This is a great dish to take to potlucks and family reunions -  Thank you for sharing Louise!

One jar of sauce is not nearly enough. I used 2 jars and next time will either add a can of tomato sauce or even a 3rd jar of sauce.  Other then being a little dry with even 2 jars of sauce it tasted wonderful and reheated great.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

This recipe is off the charts. Even though it doesn't sound very exciting, it is absolutely delicious. I like to add an extra egg as that seems to enhance the flavor and make the dish more cohesive. I highly recommend this for children and large dinner parties. It serves well and makes great leftovers.

We make this recipe at least once a month, the whole family loves it.  We use all different types of pasta to switch it up and add some garlic too.  I agree with some other reviewers it needs more sauce.  It is amazingly delicious!

I agree with the one post that said they can't imagine it with one jar of sauce.  I did, however, use Ricotta which is a dryer cheese.  But even so, two jars of sauce didn't cut it.  It was VERY dry.  Left overs especially require additional sauce.  Even then, it's not "saucy".  I also added fresh garlic and Italian Seasoning.  Good quick recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this.  I made it just as the recipe says, except a little less spaghetti... only 13oz (which was one box).  We thought it was very tasty.  I was going to add extra sauce as one review had mentioned, but we didn't and didn't feel it was needed.  Lots of leftovers for just the two of us... over half a pan, so next time I may cut in half and do in an 8X8 pan.

this was a great alternative to Lasagna. I did alter it with Ricotta instead of Cottage Cheese, and a mix of 1/2 italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef. Next time, I will add about 1/2 jar more sauce, and 1/2 pund more sausage (we like it meatier and saucier). But it was a first time try that got major thumbs up all around from the family!

Pretty good.  I did change it a little by just tossing the spaghetti with butter and then mixing ricotta with the egg, a little parmesan and some parsley.  Used the ricotta mixture to layer with instead of cottage cheese.  Very much like lasagna but with spaghetti.  My kids love this one.

This baked spaghetti was a HIT at my son's International Fair at his school, he presented on Italy (even teachers raved about it!!). I made double the recipe and it was all gone!! I'm making this tonight as well for our supper and we'll see what the ratings are at home!! I followed all instructions and ingredients, only difference tonight is ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese just to test the difference.

I didn't have any seasoned salt so I omitted it.  The dish turned out good!  I gave it four stars because my 9x13 glass dish was almost overflowing. If I make it again I will probably not use quite that much pasta.  I made it with the cottage cheese and I thought it was good.  I usually prefer ricotta for a lasagna, but cottage cheese is a bit more mellow and it worked well with the sweetness of the onions.

This was sooooo yummy!!! We loved it prepared just the way recipe shows. And it makes so much there is plenty for the next day. This was my first time making baked spaghetti, and this is the way I will fix spaghetti from now. It is nice to be able to prepare it ahead of time and then clean up before dinner. This is even going to be part of my Easter Dinner menu for my picky eaters who don't like ham.

I rate this 5 stars with a couple of changes from the first time I cooked this. First, I used ground turkey instead of beef. While the turkey was cooking I sprinkled a liberal amount of Italian seasoning on it. It added an awesome flavor this time around. Also, as some of the other reviews mentioned, you really, really need 2 jars of sauce. I used the Bertolli Tomato Basil. Other reviews mentioned ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I though the cottage cheese worked fine. This was a hit at my house! Quick and easy to prepare on a work night. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good.  It is very similar to a lasagna, but the cottage cheese gave it a slightly different, creamier, flavor.  It stayed together nicely after it was cut.  Would make this again.

Delicious!! I'm a picky, nauseous pregnant lady in her first trimester and this was a very welcome meal. I stuck with one jar of sauce and felt the noodles were perfectly coated with just enough tomato taste. I used frozen mini meatballs instead of ground beef.

This was delicious!  Much better than plain old spaghetti.  I made a batch for just my son and I which lasted over a week and then made a batch for my boyfriend who devoured it in three days!  It was the first meal I made for him and he fell in love with me instantly!  I followed the recipe all the way through except I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese which was awesome!  Thanks for creating this wonderful dish!

This was a real family pleaser.  I made this as stated but used 3 cups of cottage cheese so I wouldn't have a cup left in the contatiner.  I may add mushrooms and bell peppers next time I make it and a little more salt but it was really good without and it easily fed a family of 7 with plenty of leftovers.

I've made this twice now, and it's SO good.  I definitely took the suggestion to use TWO jars of sauce instead of one, and I use 1/2 lb of Italian sausage and 1/2 lb of hamburger.  I still think it needs a little extra flavor.  Maybe next time I'll use a couple garlic cloves with the onions.  But all in all, a great recipe!

I think this dish was pretty tastey.  I did use 2 jars of sauce, like other reviewers I felt 1 jar wouldn't be enough.  My 2 year old son LOVED it.  It's a keeper :-)

Made this with gluten-free pasta and it was terrific.  Cottage cheese a little bland; will try ricotta next time.  My husband liked this so much, he took the entire dish of leftovers on the road with him this week.  I disagree that it is too much like lasagna; it is more cheesy and a lot easier to make!

This is amazing! I love it, I tried it as written first, and now I know that I like it without meat. I use angel hair pasta and whatever cheese I have on hand, usually cheddar,  I do use the cottage cheese, it helps with moist-ness. I saute diced veggies with my onion and layer that it. Stack it all up like lasagna and pop it in the oven. Yea! 50 stars!

I made this for my sons 16th birthday party and it was a huge hit!!!  I made it with my own homeade sauce and ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I also added a cup of parmesan under the mozzarella.  It was wonderful.  The leftovers also freeze well wrapped in foil and then into a plastic bag.  Great recipe.......thanks

I made this last night and it was fantastic and very easy to make.  I substituted ricotta for cottage cheese like someone else did and used double the mount of spaghetti sauce.  It made a ton of food that we can eat on for three days.

This was yummy!  I didn't use meat in mine, only  because I didn't have any at the time, and it was very good.  My husband loved it!  Next time I will try it with ground beef or turkey, and I'm sure it will be just as good.

I used penne instead of spaghetti and it turned out great.  Didn't have a ton of flavor, so I might try a homemade sauce next time.

I made this recipe a few days ago and I am still eating it. What a large dish! Next time I will cut the recipe in half. My neighbor loves it though. I am glad I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger, because I think it would have been too bland. Next time, I will spice it up a bit more, like using garlic or whatever other spices I have on hand. I also used Ricotta Cheese instead of cottage cheese, which tasted much better. In fact, I put some more Ricotta Cheese on it when I reheat a slice of it for more flavor. Anyway, great recipe and I will make it again, but half it so I will not have so much to eat!!

EXCELLENT!  EASY!!! This baked spaghetti was delicious and so easy to make.  I left out the curd cottage cheese and it was still wonderful!  My 4 year old helped me and loved the layering!

I made this for my family of 5 and it was more than enough.  There is enough here for two night's dinners.  I did add an extra jar of sauce, I just didn't think it was going to have enough, and I would rather have too much than not enough!  Everyone loved it.  It will definitely be replacing our plain ol' spaghetti!

My daughter wanted spaghetti for her 7th birthday party and I wanted to find a way to make plain-o-spaghetti special, this is it! It really is tasty. I did as other reviewers had suggested and added more sauce and it did need it. Really easy, tasty and looks nice coming out baked from the oven. My 7 yr old helped it's so easy :)

I made a few changes: at the suggestion of a few reviewers I substituted ricotta cheese for cottage cheese and used two jars of garlic and herb spaghetti sauce instead of one. Also, I sauteed green peppers and zucchini in olive oil and Italian seasoning and mixed into the meat sauce to add vegetables. I'm making this again tonight, and I'll make this exactly the same way again.

Fantastic.  Perfect.  Awesome.  I had a dish similar to this at a dinner party and (as usual) I was determined to figure out how to make it.  Allrecipes to the rescue!  This was our Christmas Eve dinner.  I feed a crowd of hungry family members every year and I am always looking for something new and yummy.  It was easy to put together, hearty and delicious.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Might make it again for New Year's Eve.  Would not substitute or change a single thing!

Easy to prepare and delicious.  I prepared it the day before; just stuck in the oven & it turned out beautifully.  Because it had been in the refrigerator overnight, it took about 2-2 1/2 hours to bake.

This is pretty good. A good alternative to Lasagna.  Made at least 12 servings.  Easy to divide and freeze portions for later.  I wasn't sure about the egg and the butter on the pasta but it added a lot of flavor.  Will make again.

I made this recipe and will probably not ever go back to the Italian restaurant near me.  It was WUNderful!!  I made the following adjustments. 1 package of Italian Sausage instead of ground beef.  I thin sliced it lengthways.  2 28 oz. cans of spaghetti sauce.  You can often find Hunt's or Del Monte for $1 a can which is a lot less than jar sauce.  Used 2 cups Italian Blend Cheese mixed in and 2 cups Mozzarella on the top.  This was just an absolutely super dish!! One note:  With the extra sauce you will need a bigger pan than 9" x 13" I can't imagine anyone not liking this recipe.

This was delicious, although I thought it was a bit carb heavy. Next time, I'll cut the spaghetti back to 1/2 or 3/4 what it calls for.

Wonderful! Like Clee, I also used my own sauce and doubled the amount called for in the recipe. I used both ricotta and cottage cheese. This dish cut perfectly and was not only great last night when I made it, but was even better today for lunch! My son gets home tonight from college, and I'm sure he'll devour at least half a pan! Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe.

This is definitely a keeper. My family loves it. I of course added extra herbs to the sauce like oregano, thyme, fennel seeds and garlic for that extra zing.

This is a great recipe!  I made my own sauce and increased the quantity by nearly 1/3, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese,  used whole-grain rotini ( a 13.75 oz. box) instead of spaghetti and cut the amount of mozzarella in half - and it was fantastic! This is just a very rich, delicious basic recipe.

Made it exactly as the recipe except had to use my own mix of spices as I didn't have the seasoned salt.  We loved it and will make it again.  The perfect comfort food for a Friday night of a long hard week.

This is a great recipe!  I followed other suggestions and added more sauce - I used 1 1/2 jars of Herb & Garlic Spaghetti sauce.  I also used thick spaghetti and spicy sausage instead of ground beef.  This was a crowd pleaser and was great the next day as well.  Will definitely be making this again!

I have made this a couple of times with leftover spaghetti, which is a great way to get rid of it. The only change I made to this was that I used some dried oregano and basil in the suace mixture, and used onion powder because my family doesn't like onions. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I find that this goes over really well in my family, and freezes well, too. I love the flavor! Thank you!

This is really easy and really good! It seemed pretty run of the mill when i first made it, but when i tasted it I was really suprised! Cheap and easy! TRY IT! You will be glad you did!  I added some garlic, basil, and a few other seasonings to the meat when i was browning it.

Honestly, I don't see why this recipe is getting such good reviews. Even with two jars of spaghetti sauce, the noodles were just too dry. There is TOO much cheese in this recipe. It's really heavy and I just wasn't impressed with the flavor. It made a lot, but I am more concerned with taste than quantity. I would've been better off making simple spaghetti (sorry)

I have made this twice already and have yet to be disappointed. I am a vegetarian so I substituted all the none vegetarian ingredients with Morning Star ground beef and chicken strips. Tofu would have worked perfectly as well but I didn't have time to defrost the tofu that I have.

Delicious!  A good combo between spaghetti and lasagna.  Just need to add more sauce than it calls for.

My wife and kids loved this. I made a couple of substitutions/changes. I didn't add the cottage cheese, just because I didn't have any. I put a full tablespoon of season salt in. Like others I think this was a bit dry and next time I'll add a can of tomato sauce with some italian seasoning to taste. My oldest daughter thought some olives would be good in it and I might try that next time too. Loved this recipe!

Perfect leftover spaghetti recipe. I made this as a single serve supper in a large oven-safe soup bowl.  My proportions were probably off and I didn't have any eggs, but this was incredible.  I didn't even add any meat (though I had a few meatballs I could have thrown in) and it just hit the spot.  It's a keeper and my house will see it in a full-sized version very soon!

I think this is a good recipe with lots of potential. If it had been seasoned good then it would have got 5 stars, but you need to season the ground beef. I seasoned mine with : onion powder, Worcester sauce, ketchup and black pepper and boy was it good.

Wonderful comforting recipe for dinner tonight.  It has been raining here all day, and this was just perfect.  I did use my own spaghetti sauce, but followed the rest of the recipe. Great alternative to lasagna, and much easier.

A nice exciting change from regular spaghetti. I didn't have any cottage cheese so I left it out but the recipe doesn't need in my opinion. Also used garlic salt in place of the seasoned salt. Great served with garlic bread.

This was really good. I used the "calculate" tool to adjust my serving size to 4. Careful if you do this because it did not adjust all ingredients. I had a heaping 9x13" dish, no way could this be 4 servings! Guess what's for dinner tomorrow? :-) Hubby LOVED this!!!

Baked spaghetti! This is as delicious as it is easy. The first time I decided to try it I had no ground beef. No problem! I did have hot italian sausage so I popped them out of their skin, cooked them and incorporated these zesty sausages into the casserole. My husband and I found the results delectable. I've made the sausage a baked spaghetti tradition. It revs the flavor up a notch or two. It's oh so good!

This was fabulous!  I love spaghetti and have been making it a long time.  So I was interested in finding something new.  I think it's the parmesan and cottage cheese that make the difference.  I made it with ground turkey and stirred it all together instead of layering it.  I have made it 3 times in the past month.  That's how good it is.

This was really good!  I made it the night before, and just popped it in the oven after work.  I made it for my 2 Nephews (3 and 5 years old), and they loved it.  I doubled the sauce, and used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese.  Next time I'm going to try it with hot Italian sausage in place of the beef, and maybe add some mushrooms, just to add a little more flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a fantastic and easy to make meal!  The receipe makes ALOT of food.  I froze half of the full portion with still plenty left over for dinner for two nights.  Our family loves tons of flavor, so I substituted Italian sausage and a spicy sauce.  I also used ricotta cheese as others did and found it a good sub for the cottage cheese.  Highly recommended recipe.

This was pretty good.  I think it goes a little beyond regular spaghetti, since I don't usually put all that cheese in my spaghetti.  I don't know if it is worth all the effort to make again, but my boyfriend REALLY liked it and couldn't get enough.  I'm not crazy about spaghetti (I used 12 oz. whole wheat thin spaghetti), so if I do make it again, I will probably use a different pasta, like penne.  Also, I used 1.5 jars sauce, added mushrooms and spinach, and with the 12oz pasta it almost didn't fit into the 9x13 pan.  It was spilling over as it was baking.  Overall pretty good, and makes for great leftovers.

Delicious!  I took others' advice and used about a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce - Ragu Mama's Special Garden sauce.  This makes a huge portion - it could easily be divided into two smaller pans and one pan could be frozen.  So good!  Not sure how healthy, though. . .

This recipe was a bit bland for my taste but I'm kind of partial to spicy foods. It was good but I added garlic powder and Franks hot sauce and it was perfect.

This is super easy to make; reminded me of making lasagna.  My famioly loved this!  I used a full container (24 oz.) of cottage cheese.  I would suggest adding garlic to this.

I cut the recipe in half and it was very good.  My husband really liked it and he isn't a fan of casseroles.  I will definately make this again.  I might try adding some shredded prolone to the cheeses.  It was super easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

As written, this recipe gets four stars.  Use ricotta cheese instead of cottage and you have a five star recipe.  It is very tasty and a nice change to just regular spaghetti.

Nice spin on a classic dish.  We live abroad and can't get certain ingredients so I used quark instead of cottage cheese, gouda instead of mozza.  Made my own spaghetti sauce and added garlic to the ground beef as other reviewers suggested.  Yum!

Good comfort food. I omitted the season salt and added garlic, oregano, Italian seasoning and Italian sausage to the sauce. I also only used half the mozzarella and fat free cottage cheese. Served with garlic bread and a green salad. Will definitely make again.

Awesome if used  with good spaghetti sauce. The first time I made this it was a little blan. The second time I used a thicker spaghetti sauce (about a jar and a half), about 3/4 of the 16 oz of spaghetti noodles, substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese, and added 1tsp of ground cayenne pepper, 1tsp of oregano, 1tsp of cumin, two cloves of garlic, half a chopped bell pepper and some sliced mushrooms. It turned out AWESOME. I must say that ricotta cheese makes the dish sweeter and is harder to spread.

I didn't love this. I thought it was way too much cheese (so I used only half), and agree with other reviewers that it was a bit dry. Having said that, my partner loved it.  I also added garlic, green pepper, frozen veggies (peas, carrots and corn) and spices.

Pretty good. I used ricotta cheese rather than cottage...(personal preference). Good flavor but will use more than one jar of spaghetti sauce next time around. Was a little dry.

Didn't have beef on hand, so I made it w/ sauteed chicken and layered in fresh baby spinach too.  Great dish!  The egg wash really makes the noddles hold the sauce.  Loved it.

I didnt care for this. I would just assume have lasagna or spaghetti not combined into one dish. I used ricotta cheese because I didnt have cottage cheese, I didnt mind the taste but the appearance of this dish once ready was enough for me to lose my appetite. My personal opinion.

Loved this recipe - made just a couple of changes - added a couple of cups of sauce - afraid it would be too dry and i mixed the cottage cheese in with the noodle mixture - my kids don't like the "gooey" layer of lasagna - so they still got the nutrition of the cottage cheese - just hide it - didn't change the taste at all - i've made it both ways.   I get requests for this at least every other week from the kids!

Fabulous!!! My family loves this recipe. Whenever I make spaghetti. I make extra and make this casserole and stick in the freezer to have a quick and easy meal at a later date. And I think this gets better reviews than regular spaghetti.

Pretty good basic baked spaghetti recipe.  People that thought it wasn't that great have to remember, people's tastes are different.  Be creative and adjust things the way you like them.  For instance, I added green pepper, a couple cloves of pressed garlic, some course ground black pepper, sea salt (instead of the seasoned salt), and the basic Italian seasoning while cooking the hambuer.  For the cheeses, I used a mozzarella and provalone blend and shredded parmesan asiago blend.  My husband and 2 year old loved it!

Pretty good but on the dry side and bland. Could be better depending on the amount and type of sauce used. It was a little more work than I would like to put into something that tastes so similar to regular spaghetti. But definitely doable.

This is the best ever baked spaghetti!  I make it whenever I need to make a meal to a new mom, it's good ole' comfort food, and is very filling!  Even my kids like it.

Good with a few tweaks.  I made my normal spaghetti recipe as far as spices and vegetables, then proceeded to follow the layering and baking instructions. It would have been pretty bland without the additional spices. Will make again.

Made this for my daughter's water polo team.  Several of the girls said they thought "yuck" when I said I was making spaghetti casserole, and then they tried it--every single one of them loved it!  Not a bit left over!

Wonderful and easy. I have 5 kids and they all ate it and asked for 2nds!!! I, like the other reviewers, used 2 jars of sauce and ricotta. I was a little concerned about the spaghetti sticking together, so I used angel hair pasta the 1st time and it was great, and then I used spaghetti the 2nd time and it held together just as well. Thanks for the great recipe :)

Pretty good!! I NEVER use jar sauce so I made my own...with lots of onion, mushrooms, garlic, fennel, basil, oregano and italian seasonings.  I use 2 c. diced italian tomatoes...I puree one can and leave the other one diced. 1 can tomato paste (with italian seasonings) and 2 c. tomato sauce (with italian seasonings) and a 1/2 c. to 1 c. of water.  I let this simmer on the stove for a few hours...with pork medallions (that I saute in olive oil and s/p) in it...mmmm. Then I followed the rest of the recipe as stated. Added lots more cheese, though!  Overall, very good!!  Was even better the next day when the noodles soaked up all the sauce!!

This recipe was very good. I added the extra jar of sauce and replaced the cottage cheese with the Ricotta. Very good. I got many compliments on it. I may be adventurous and add some shredded fresh basil on the middle layer. All in all very good.

This would have been great if the sauce had been almost doubled, it was pretty dry.  Other then that, though, I think that it would be fantastic with more sauce. It holds up well and is even better the next day!

Great recipe, I did substitute the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese the first time I made it, but the second time I did uns cottage cheese with chives. And even people that hate cottage cheese loved it (like my Hubby). There wasn't a crumb left both times, so I don't know how it tastes warmed up.

Amazing! I completely disagree with those who said it was plain or "awful."  Not only is this dish super easy to make, it stores well and tastes even better warmed up in the microwave on day 2 or 3.  I used a large jar of ricotta and parmesan Prego with browned Italian sausage, ricotta cheese and freshly grated parmesan and mozzarella.  Wasn't dry at all!

Even better the next day. I did make it vegetarian by removing the meat and replacing it with sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms. I also used ricatta instead of cottage cheese, and increased the sauce.

I've made this several times and it's always turned out great. The only change I make is I use homemade spaghetti sauce with meat in it. My family loves this dish!

First time, excellent choice! My family enjoyed it especially my husband.  Followed the advise of others, replace cottage cheese with riccata and added more speghetti sauce.  For a more healthy version, I'll use whole wheat speghetti in the future and possible use venision and/or ground turkey instead of lean ground beef.

This recipe is awesome though I only changed one item... the cottage cheese I replaced with ricotta cheese. I mixed the ricotta cheese with the egg and parm. cheese and then tossed the noodles in it to coat them then dumped into the pan and topped with the sauce... It was awesome my 3 year old had seconds!!! this one is a keeper!! thanks

This recipe was a great weeknight meal.  I tweaked it a bit... substituting cream cheese for the cottage cheese, adding garlic while sauteing the meat and onions, cheddar for mozzarella (ran out), whole wheat penne instead of spaghetti, and sprinkled italian seasoning on the top for a little extra spice.  My kids liked it and my husband said I should make it again.  May try Italian sausage instead of hamburger next time.

Very Good!  I also doubled the sauce.  Since I was cooking for only my husband and I, I divided it into 3 - 8 inch pans and froze 2.  It was a hit!!!

Mmm, this was ooey and gooey and full of flavor.  Very filling, which is a bonus when you are trying to feed three growing boys.  We loved this.  The only minor change was to double the sauce.  We'll definitely keep this in the rotation.  Thanks!

First off I used frozen meatballs instead of ground beef. I added some garlic, mushrooms and some spices. I didnt use cottage cheese because I dont like it. I just doubled the mozzarella. This is the only way I will eat spaghetti. Really good!!

I used ground turkey and added 3 cloves of garlic to it while it was browning.  Then after draining the fat, I added 3/4c sliced mushrooms.  Even the picky eater in our family who usually picks out the meat in the meatsauce ate it without complaints and even asked for seconds!! Amazing and easy!  Made a lot too.

This recipe was delicious.  I used what I had - 13.25oz box whole wheat spaghetti, about 1 1/2 jars sauce ( tomato basil & rose ), 1 1/2 (12oz) cottage cheese containers and I used 1.5 lb ground turkey seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder & Italian seasoning.  I omitted the onion because my husband doesn't like it (used powder instead).  It turned out great and my family loved it.

This is a really tasty recipe. I made it in a snap tonight with leftover spaghetti sauce that I had frozen and I used fresh sour cream instead of cottage cheese. I didn't have fresh parmesan on hand so grated from the can. I cut the recipe in half and that worked really well in an 8x8 pan and I cut the cooking time by about 5 minutes covered and another 5 minutes uncovered. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy & tastes great!  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese & added a clove of minced garlic to the meat/sauce mixture.  I made this for my boyfriend and I & it was perfect.  It will be too dry for my dad, so when I make it for he & my mom this weekend I will make extra meat/sauce & serve it as-is for my dad to pour on top of his serving.  What a great recipe, thank you!

This was okay.  I thought regular spaghetti tastes better.  I added the sour cream instead of the cottage cheese, and it was good, but not like, wow.  I was expecting more.

YUMMY! Thought it would be even better the next day, but it was best the first day. I added lots of chopped garlic and italian herbs to the meat and onions. I also used the new pouch sauces, I used three... so that's about a jar and a half. Really good!

This was a quick and easy put together dish  using this and that from leftovers. Didn't measure the ingredients but definitey added more tomato sauce, subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese and threw in some fresh herbs from my garden. Thanks Louise!

This was delicious and very easy to make.. I used cream cheese and I didn't have butter so I used olive oil.. It still turned out great. My husband didn't even touch the rest of his food and ate three servings. It's definitely a keeper!

My family loves this recipe. I do make a few changes though, I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage (and I use more that what is called for) and I also use more sauce - as one reviewer said - it is very dry.  It makes a lot, but it is great as leftovers.

This was so good! I did halve it for my small family and it was plenty, still had leftovers. I did make a few changes, I used sea salt instead of season salt. I added some fresh crushed garlic to the meat. Even though I halved the recipe I still used about 1/4 cup of parmesan. I didn't have any cottage cheese so I used about a half a cup of cubed cream cheese, and I used half cheddar and half mozzarella. Also, I didn't layer it like it said. I did spaghetti mixture on the bottom, then the cubed cream cheese, then the meat sauce, the topped it off with the cheddar and mozzarella. Delicious! I know it probably sounds like a lot of changes but it really wasn't. It was very flavorful and not dry at all. Plus the kids loved it! Will make again.

This was okay.  Mixed reviews from the family.  Very dry - definitely needs more sauce.  I added ground beef, onion, garlic, and italian seasoning.  I probably won't make this again.

I loved this and so did my family! They all called it Spasagna cause it looked like a mix of spaghetti and lasagna. I read a ton of comments saying not to use the cottage cheese, but I used it anyway, and it was fabulous. Only changes I made were to use whole grain noodles,and low fat cottage cheese. Served with whole grain garlic bread. Perfect.

The best baked spaghetti and my whole family's favorite. You can also make many variations with it using different noodles. I only use 2 cups of cheese and it is still very cheesy and good.

This was good except it was too dry for us. I had some left over so the next day, I added more spaghetti sauce right on top and kind of poked through the casserole so the sauce would go down into it. I covered it and baked it again at 325 and it tasted better than the first day I made it.

I have made this a few times and decided to sit down and write the review.  We live in China so sometimes the ingredients are hard to come by.  I substituted cream cheese for the cottage cheese and it turned out great.  The cream cheese we find here is imported and not nearly as good as what I could get in the states but it did the job well enough.  this recipe received a WOW from my husband and kids...they really enjoyed this twist on the average spaghetti.  i really think the cream cheese or cottage cheese makes it have a nice creamy taste.  This is a nice recipe for me to throw together and we all ate it until it was gone. Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay, but certainly a good start of something wonderful!  Needs more veggies ie bell peppers, or something.  Pretty dry and bland in my opinion.  I used sour cream instead of the cottage cheese, but that was my only substitution.

Excellent recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  I used low fat sour cream instead of cottage cheese and I cut down to 4 TBS of margarine.  My husband loved this recipe and my kids did too.

I made this one tonight.  It was very easy and the taste was great!  I am not a fan of ziti and was very pleasantly surprised with this dish.  Not too cheesy, just enough meat sauce.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks.

I have to give this a 5 star, even though I didn't have the right cheese (I used sharp cheddar & fresh parmesan) and only had about half enough cottage cheese.  It still turned out wonderful. I like a little more sauce so next time I'll use more sauce. I used Barillia Angel Hair pasta instead of spaghetti. But it is definately going to be a main stay in our home. Served with Coles garlic bread.

This was tasty- a hit with the whole family, which hardly every happens. 
Only a few substitutions to work with what I had:  cheddar, not mozzarella, onion powder instead of diced onion, and I didn't have cottage cheese so I softened some cream cheese and combined it with the shredded cheese.  
I layered the noodles, then smooshed on the cream cheese, then the meaty sauce and sprinkled the top with some more shredded cheese. 
 Mmmm, cream cheesey noodles... ahhhghgh (Homer Simpson donut noise)  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my family and friends and everyone loved it.  It was so filling and delicious.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage just because we like the taste better.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My 13 year old loved it and can't wait to have it again.

Oh my goodness, was this ever good!  I love this twist on traditional spaghetti and can't believe I waited so long to try it.  I added fresh mushrooms and garlic to this dish and it was great but I can imagine it being great without.  I also didn't have enough cottage cheese on hand so added some sour cream in as a sub.  Delicious family meal.  The kiddos will gobble it up (mine asked for 2nd's)!

I didn't use the cottage cheese because I didn't have any but it still tasted great.  I used the "tomato cream sauce for pasta" from this site.  It tasted even better the next day.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it went over pretty well, although I have to say it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be.  Maybe just a little bit too filling.  I was surprised at how well the cottage cheese blended in though, and my picky boyfriend ate it!  I might make it again sometime, thanks for sharing.

Great recipe ~ especially for moms. I was going to make regular spaghetti, even though I am so sick of it, but with a week old baby I needed a recipe I could make ahead and have my husband throw in the oven. I found this one, tried it and we loved it!! However, I did change a bit based on other reviewers ~ I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, me and hubby don't care for cottage cheese. I also doubled the sauce (glad I did) and added some garlic powder to the meat. A small side salad and garlic bread makes this a great satisfying meal. It makes alot ~ we have a half pan leftover, so it also makes for two full dinners and then some. I will definitely make this one again!

I really liked this, comfort food. I did only use about 10 oz. of spaghetti noodles, that was plenty. Added a can of sliced mushrooms, next time will add a little green pepper & maybe some sliced black olives. A keeper.

I followed the original recipe and think it's great. The cottage cheese completely melts if you bake it the suggested time. My husband loves it because it's not too "tomato-y". My two year old also eats it up. I have no reason to try any other recipe!

This recipe is definitly good, but for some reason my kids are not that fond of it.  I think that it turns out just a bit bland and maybe a bit dry for them because they like spagetti with loads of sauce!  But I will make it again for sure.

This was pretty good, tons of cheese. I thought it could have used a bit more sauce and meat. and will make this change next time I make it. This can be made ahead and feeds an army. Great for the kids or if your feeding the  entire football team.

This recipe is great and a lot better than regular baked speghetti.  I don't add the egg and butter and it comes out great.  I do add sour cream with the cottage cheese to add a bit more flavor.  It is almost like lasagna but with speghetti noodles.  Very good.

Will definitely make again!  I cut out lots of fat by subbing ground turkey, fat free sour cream, reduced fat parmesan, whole wheat pasta, and egg beaters. It still tasted great!

Great! I had leftover meat sauce from a failed meatball experience, so I just added that to a jar of spaghetti sauce for this recipe.

I tried this the other night.  It's a few more steps than I like to use for a casserole, I ended up forgetting to measure out 1/3 c. of parmesan cheese, and instead ended up throwing in the entire bag (a little over a cup) - but I added a couple more Tbsps. of melted butter once I realized my mistake and it turned out just fine.  I also threw in some mushrooms (no more kids at home..hehe), some minced garlic and some Italian seasoning, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe.  It's extremely good - and extremely filling - so I'd especially recommend it for growing teens or men with big appetites!  Although it won't be something I do every week, I've already told my daughter that I want to make it for her the next time she visits from college.  Very good recipe.
