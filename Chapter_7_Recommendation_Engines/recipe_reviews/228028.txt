It would have been a great chicken dinner except with 1 TBSP of garlic salt, it made it extremely salty.  There is salt in the dry Italian salad dressing mix.  That would have been enough salt for me.  I love garlic, but next time I will use garlic powder.

I didn't have the Italian dressing so I just substituted with the seasoning. I double up on the lemon but only because I love lemons myself.

Great chicken.  Had everything on hand so I decided to make this tonight.  I used a TBS of garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Put some salt in though.  Thanks.

"This recipe wasn't to my liking.I used crushed crackers, garlic powder, basil,organio and abit of salt."   Interesting . . . how does one completely change the recipe, then say they don't like it and give it two stars?   Perhaps there should be a comments section for people who want to say what they did, but not rate the recipe, since they didn't use the recipe!

I didn't have Italian dressing mix so I simply put half a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  Everything else was the same.  It was pretty good!

My family loved it! A couple of minor changes:  I soaked the chicken in cold salt water for about 45 minutes. I also cut the butter to 3T, and I pounded the chicken until in was very thin.  I only cooked for 15 minutes and then broiled for 3 to give it color.

Great versitile recipe!  You can use either bread crumbs or finely crushed buttery crackers!  I doubled the recipe and used a large quantity of chicken tenders - made for great snack, dip-able nuggets, topper for my salad, and sandwich....the list goes on!
Thanks!!!!  Will use again!

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. It was really good! Just the right amount of seasoning and that was my first time using the panko bread crumbs but they were great! This will definitely be a tradition now! I also was thinking of cutting the chicken up into cubes and serving over rice too?

Made this tonight and it was a huge hit with my picky husband...no leftovers!  I made according to recipe except I used garlic powder because I didn't have garlic salt. Will absolutely make again.

Very easy and delicious!  My husband really liked it, and it was good as leftovers.  My husband added mayo and made the leftovers into a sandwich.  This will go into my regular rotation.  I did cut down on the butter as others had suggested.   Using the Panko bread crumbs verses regular bread crumbs adds a nice crispness.

I followed this recipe as instructed, but I substituted olive oil in place of butter and garlic powder in place of garlic salt. It came out GREAT! Very juicy and flavorful; also easy to make. I will be adding it to my dinner rotation.

Instead of Italian salad dressing mix I used Italian seasoning along with a substitution of fresh lemon zest and crushed peppercorn for lemon pepper.   THE ADDITIONAL SPICE ALONG WITH THE FRESHNESS ADDED THAT POP OF FLAVOR!!   YUMMY!!!!

My family loved it.  Might try to marinade the chicken in Italian dressing for 12-24 hours next time.  Seasoning was great, but the chicken just didn't have enough flavor.  Will try again!

Very easy, I would use less Garlic Salt though.  Maybe half garlic salt, half garlic.

Good recipe. I had a partial box of panko in the cupboard that I wanted to use. It was ok, but not fantastic. I made the recipe as submitted except that I broiled it a few minutes at the end of its cooking time. I still have enough panko left for another small batch, so I might read the comments to get some ideas about how to spice it up. Maybe parmesan cheese and parsley?

So flavorful! I made it as is but used the juice of a whole lemon. Next time I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt as it was too salty for this salt-living family.

I made a few changes based off preference and what I had in the house. as opposed to butter I used grapeseed oil. I only had liquid salad dressing and not the dry seasoning mix, so I used the liquid salad dressing in the liquid mixture and just Italian seasoning with the pankos. I cut it into strips as my oven is a bit older and doesn't cook as well as it used to. It still turned out amazing! Thank you for sharing.

This was really good! I'm always looking for new recipes that will satisfy my somewhat picky teen. This fit the bill! I accidently used too much garlic and it was still good. Can't wait to try it again with the right amount.

This recipe is awesome.  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  However, the next time I make this dish I will omit the garlic salt since the Italian salad dressing mix already has salt in it.

This is one of my most returned-to recipes! Love it.  So tasy and tangy. Sometimes I try to do less lemon because it becomes a little TOO flavorful. Overall, really great!

This was very good.  Nice and juicy and super easy.   I love chicken but get tired of the same old boring ways to cook it.
