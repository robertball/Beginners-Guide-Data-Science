5.17.20  This really is a styled-up mac and cheese, and whatever you do, DON’T substitute cheddar for the Gruyere.  If Gruyere is not available, swiss might work as a substitute, but the flavor that you get from the Gruyere is awesome.  Also, would recommend not skimping on the onions, they’re an important part of making this distinct.   Fortunately, I had set aside some of the pasta water because the cheese sauce was very thick and starting to get stringy, so I used quite a bit to get the sauce to the right consistency.  We love mac and cheese, and this is a special one!

didn't have the right cheese so I substituted velveeta queso blanco, tasting it often so I didn't get too much cheese. It was excellent !! Tastes just like french onion soup !!

This is a great twist on an old classic.  Tastes like onion soup Mac and cheese. Use the correct cheese to get that awesome flavour!
