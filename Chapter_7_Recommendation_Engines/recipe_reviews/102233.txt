These were good and very easy to make!   I did add 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (and I might go with even more next time), substituted brown sugar for half the white and sprinkled vanilla sugar on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  As suggested I added some spices to the dough--cinnamon and ginger--and for fun stirred in some chocolate chips.  This would also probably be very good with some candied ginger and/or dried cranberries in the mix.  Just the thing for a rainy fall afternoon!

These turned out really good after a little tweaking. I didn't have a problem with stickiness (I've found that the best scones are a *little* sticky - flour your board and your hands, cut it, and throw it in the oven). I did need to add some flavor. Threw in a little more sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and grated lemon zest. Topped with turbinado sugar. My scones took about 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I thought these were pretty good.  My husband thought they were lacking flavor, so I experimented with sprinkling cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice over them.  Might be even better if you mix it in the dough.

Don't be afraid to jazz this up with pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, or nutmeg.  Very good.  Altering flour is really not necessary.

Dough is stickly because of the amount of pumpkin puree and is not able to be kneaded or cut into trianges. Do not add too much more flour or when baked the doughiness remains.  Consider lowering the amount of pumpkin to 3/4 of a can, adding 1/3 C flour and some spices- the taste is a bit bland.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, or pumpkin spice are my suggestions.

The scones tasted OK but they were a bit hard and flat.  I think that you should rub the butter and flour together like in a biscuit recipe to make real Australian pumpkin scones.

These were more like a heavy bread with very little pumpkin flavouring.  Will not make again.

I really like this recipe because it gives room to play with flavor. Since there aren't any spices in the recipe, I added a bit of cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, vanilla, and a little extra sugar. They puffed up beautifully and the texture was very nice; moist and fluffy. To avoid baking "hockey pucks" it is important to not excessively knead the dough; only until it holds together! Also, to avoid adding too much flour, I added 2 cups of the flour to the mix and used the remaining 2/3 cup on the board. My batch yielded 8 very big scones. I also baked them for 20 minutes. Overall, the scones are delightful and mildly flavored; they would taste great topped with a savory cheese or a sweet jam.  Versatile and delicious. What a scone should be!

Mine turned out very tough and doughy.  The flavor was good, but the texture was not what I was hoping for in a scone.

These were horrible!  Bland, no flavor what-so-ever.  They were not scone like at all - we started calling them scakes because they were cake like.  Will never be making this again.

I added cinnamon and nutmeg but they still came out very dull when it comes to flavor.  They also were more "bread like" than scones. They need a lot more pumpkin and spice flavor.  I added a chocolate drizzle on top which made them a little bit better, but not much.

not a bad recipe.  Definitely needed some spicing up.  Added 3 tsp pumpkin spice and 1 tsp ginger.  Next time I'll also do a lemon ginger glaze on top.

After reading all the reviews I adjusted the recipte...
About 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour instead of self rising flour and 
1 tablespoon baking powder 
1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar instead of white sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, some cloves, all spice and dash of ginger 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
About 1/2 cup butter, cut into chunks and cut into dry ingrediants.  I mixed the milk and pumpkin together and added to dry ingrediants until just moistened.  Work dough together on a floured surface and cut into triangles.  Brushed with milk and sprinkled with cinn/sugar mixture.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes. These were light, not sweet but perfect with a warm beverage.  Definitely more of a muffin texture than a traditional scone.
Basic idea was there, but needed alternate flour and some spice for flavor.

Dough was very difficult to work with, but I made it....I also added cinnamon and ginger to the dough, and served them with sage butter.

These turned out gorgeous! I sadly couldn't eat them because I'm on a diet but my parents loved them. They made the whole house smell like fall. I added a little brown sugar to the top of the scones over the icing just for looks but as for the scones themselves I added quite a lot of pumpkin spice. Maybe about a tablespoon and a half. Would make again :)
