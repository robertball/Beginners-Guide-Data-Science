Pretty good waffles! They were really fluffy and light, but had a great buttery flavor.  I didn't give this 5 stars since I like my waffles a little bit more dense, but I would make these again.

These waffles are very delicious, considering that we messed up the recipe by not whisking the egg yolk and putting the milk in at the end, plus adding the egg whites in at the wrong time. If I were to make them again, I would put in way less butter. Two cups is NOT necessary. I would definitely recommend it.

I originally got this recipe from an old "Farm Journal's Country Cookbook".  Copyright 1959.  I've been making these waffles since I got married in 1965, and they are always perfect.  I have 4 small round waffle irons, and make them for the whole family when they are here.  Triple batch works for about 20.

I've made these many times, just as the recipe is.  They come out great!  They're light and stand up to sweet syrups.  I do half the recipe, since it's just me, and just toast them the next day.

I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla and they still turned out very eggy. Super light and fluffy and my husband liked them, but not what I was expecting.

Waffles were light and fluffy. The kiddies found the buttery taste a bit much for them. I will cut the butter to 1/2 cup and add in 1/2 cup of applesauce.

Absolutely yummy! I didn't use all of the egg yolk/milk mixture, about 80%. Add strawberries and pecans and you've got a delicious meal!

Pretty good.  The butter taste is very prevalent and really makes the waffle.  Not healthy by any means, but I've made them twice and the family likes them.  I do not get fussy with the recipe. All ingredients get dumped and mixed, no separating the eggs here.  I also add some vanilla and sugar to the batter.  I think next time I'll use cinnamon as well.  I also use my Belgian Waffle maker and they are just fine. I'll make them again.

This recipe has great consistency, but I like my waffles a little bit sweet, so I added 2/3cp of granulated sugar and a tsp of vanilla.

I found the batter way too wet, it was nearly thin enough to make pancakes. There was so much butter I almost didn't butter them on the plate, the butter was dripping out of the iron as it cooked. It wasn't done when the iron said it was done -- it was too soft to come out. 

I did taste very good. I added 1 tbs of sugar (I halved the whole recipe) and a bit more flour to thicken it up. Also mixed in raspberries, strawberries and blueberries (I won't make waffles without fruit in the batter). I will probably make it again, but will further halve the liquid ingredients. I use a half cup of prepared batter to make one waffle in my iron so half the recipe should have made two waffles. I have enough for the whole three day weekend.

My family loved them!  I followed all of the steps, but added 1 tsp Imitation Vanilla Butter Nut Flavor to the egg and milk mixture, plus 4 Tbsp of powdered sugar to the flour mixture.  DELICIOUS!!!

This recipe is fabulous. The amount of butter is appropriate. I put in a dash of sugar and vanilla, and I used a Belgian waffle iron. I wouldn't change anything else in this recipe. This made 9 waffles and my kids wouldn't stop saying how awesome they tasted. To make the waffles it is time consuming but really worth it!! Unfortunately they aren't going to want Eggo's anymore.

A little too much butter, but excellent taste. Easy recipe to make with children.
