When I made these cookies today I made a very critical error - I didn't make nearly enough of them.  This is one of the best cookies I've made in a looooong time,  and I can only explain my making so few of them  because I didn't want a lot of them laying around in case they  were duds.  Oh, quite the contrary.  What a beautiful, perfect cookie  this is!  Not to mention it's an absolute cinch to put together.  I had them ready to pop in the oven before it was even preheated.  The proportions of all ingredients are just perfect - no tweaking necessary unless you 'd like to change up the flavor with a different extract.  Just because rolling out sugar cookies has never floated my boat I simply dropped the dough onto  UNgreased cookie sheets and flattened them just slightly.  Making them a little thicker than the recipe called for made them tender and soft, ideal for a glaze or butter frosting.  Hubs requested a glaze and, happy to oblige, I  used Shiny Cookie Icing, also from this site, for its lack of any flavoring.  The subtle flavor of almond in these cookies was just right.  The submitter suggests these are the perfect cookie for Christmas gift boxes but I submit these are perfect as  a "go-to" cookie all year round.  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm thrilled to give these an enthusiastic two thumbs up.  No wonder this recipe has been passed down through the generations!

Sugar cookies are my absolute favorite guilty pleasure. These are spectacular. I don't like to roll out the dough and cut them either, so I made little logs, chilled till very firm, then sliced and baked. Wow! A home made butter cream frosting makes these irresistible! Thanks for sharing your mom's wonderful recipe, Patsy.

Every year I make sugar cookies for my kids for Christmas, and every year I HATE it. The dough sticks, it breaks, i have to roll it too much and it gets tough. Not this year! These were great. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored crisco. I didn't have the entire 3 hours to wait, so they only got 2. We wanted to roll them, and honestly the dough was easier to work with when warm. The cold dough was too brittle to roll. We made a double batch, and had it perfect by the last few trays.  Rolled out a little thicker than 1/4" and undercooked them just ever so slightly (7minutes). Perfect. I think next time instead of almond, I will use lemon extract or zest. This is my new go-to sugar cookie recipe.

Best sugar cookie I have ever eaten!  3 hour chill time is too long. Press the dough into a rectangle , wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 45 minutes. I rolled it out and cut out 2 dozen cookies. Yum!

Flavor was ok.  Mine were very dry.  After refrigerating the dough, as the recipe states, it was rock hard.  Had to bring back to room temperature.  The recipe also states it makes 60 cookies, I got 25 from the recipe.  The only thing I changed was not rolling them out, can't imagine that would make a difference. Even though the flavor was ok, I won't make again.  Thank you.

Since it was my first time using this recipe, I made a half batch, gave them a simple royal icing, and sprinkles topping, and sent to my husband deployed overseas.  I saved a few for myself, and they were absolutely delicious.  Heard from my husband, and even after a week shipping across the world, he said they were delicious.  Whenever my husband reports back that he likes something, the recipe goes in my file, and it gets an automatic 5 stars :-)

Made these for Christmas and was amazed how well they turned out. They will now remain on my Christmas cookie list. Made the recipe as is. The dough was easy to work with. Only thing I would change is doubling the recipe next time.

These were outstanding. I added a bit more almond and the cookies were gone in one evening from my Hungary family. I had to make them 3 more times before the holiday was over

This recipe needs to be removed. I spent 4 hours of time I can't get back on this. I followed the recipe *exactly*. First off, the 3 hour refrigeration time produces a rock solid dough that cannot be worked at all. If you have an extra hour to let it come back to a workable temp, you may get a better product. I didn't have that luxury of time. I was forced to microwave 1/4 of the dough and then work it into the rest to bring to a workable temp. Rolled out, cut cookies and they CHARRED at 8 minutes. Second tray came out okay at 6 minutes, but at this rate, I suspect the dough is far too overworked. And because the first tray burned, I now don't have enough to send to school for my son's birthday. So, thanks for the wasted time, the wasted money and resources, and the ruined birthday surprise.

I made the mistake with sugar and it turned out super hard. But they were great cookies for decorating and I recommend that you use cookie cutters cause they look really cute.
