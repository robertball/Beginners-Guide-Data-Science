I was very disappointed in this cake. The layer on top was hard. I had planned on taking it to a carry in but had to scrap it and whip up something else.

A harsh disappointment. I was excited to taste this "truffle like rich great cake" and after spending over 15 for the ingredients (I used some good quality chocolate) I must say I was disheartened. The middle took a lot longer to set and the the whole cake hardened on the outside layer and I ended up taking it off and discarding it. It did not taste very rich at all and I did NOT like it with a graham cracker crust. I would suggest using a shortbread crust. It is dense though so grab your glass of milk...you're going to need it! But that's a good thing. I will keep searching for something richer.

This recipe is delicious but very dense rich moist and chocolately. It has a truffle-like texture.

This is so delicious! That's probably why it's in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook but under another name... all the same worth having once a year (that's about how often a heart can take it!).

I love this recipe but I am having a problem with it. At 45 minutes 325 degrees the inside is still very moist and a very hard layer forms on top that I have to peel off and throw away. I have to let it cook over an hour.

This was GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out absolutely YUMMY! The cake did form a "crust" on top as it baked...but it didn't affect the cake at all. The cake was like a cross between a truffle and a brownie. yum yum yum.
