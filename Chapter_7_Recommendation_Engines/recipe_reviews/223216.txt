I’m SO excited to be the first reviewer of this recipe so that I can happily also be the first to report how excellent this salad is.  I wasn’t expecting to love it, but I did. I thought it would be too tangy - but it wasn’t.  Familiar with how boldly flavored (toasted) sesame seed oil is and how little is required to make its statement, I was tempted to cut back on it, and rather severely.  But because I am this recipe’s first reviewer, I believed it was important to offer an opinion on the recipe just as written.  (Down the road, however, subsequent reviewers should feel free to tweak to their heart’s content)  So – I prepared the dressing exactly as specified (just using grapeseed oil instead of canola oil, which I don’t use) and cooked the onion till nearly caramelized.  I must tell you that once the dressing began to boil the odor actually was tangy and pungent, irritating in my nose, but I plodded on!  This salad is simply beautiful.  It is a remarkably elegant presentation and a taste delight, different from anything I have ever tried.  The sesame oil is a creative and delicious addition to the dressing and the choice of ingredients is sublime.   This, to my admitted surprise, is a real winner.

I really hate it when people change the recipe, why not submit your own but I'll do that anyway. First: This was just like Mom used to make and I loved it back then too but if you fry up a few strips of bacon first, crumbled and brown some onions in that bacon fat it will be ot die for.   Second: I have found that I need to reheat the dressing several times after the first pour to really wilt that spinach.

This recipe is outstanding! I was looking for a last-minute salad to make with my homemade pizza last night and spinach was the only leafy green I had to work with, so I searched for a spinach salad. I was intrigued by this one and I am SO glad I found it! My husband said, "Mmmm...this is delicious" after the first bite and raved about it with every single bite after that. He's usually not keen on healthy substitutions for things, but he said he missed absolutely nothing with this compared to the bacon grease version. We craved it and made it again tonight and he said he would like to have it very often. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

This is a bomb recipe. I didn't even have onion or Dijon mustard (substituted yellow mustard) and it still came out great. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I can't wait to make it again!

I make this all the time now, it was so good. Brought it to a party and it was a hit. Just to warn you, though, don't heat up the dressing until right before serving, otherwise it can get ugly.

Excellent salad!  I didn't measure my spinach, I just used a 9oz. bag, as that is what I had on hand.  I think next time I will cut back on the dressing part, maybe by 1/3, as I had a bit too much dressing to spinach ratio.   All in all, hubby and I enjoyed this very much.  Another one for the "do again" folder!  Thanks!

The whole family likes this one!  Love the tangy sweet flavor of the dressing.  I added chunks of roasted chicken and hot bread to make it a meal. I always was a fan of the old-fashioned wilted spinach salad with bacon grease, but this is just as good and has a lot less fat.  We'll enjoy this all summer with fresh spinach or greens from the garden.

Another amazing recipe. A little tart, but amazing. My son (14) hates salads, but loves cooked spinach and even he enjoyed this. I think the only change I would make is to add a little more honey to take down the kick of the red wine vinegar.

Love this salad! I made a few additions: I left the eggs  out and added sautéed mushrooms with the onion and put a little bit of feta on top. Like it so much that I've been having 2-3 days a week. One night with salmon and the other with grilled chicken. Excellent!

I'm so happy to have found this recipe. I like having fresh spinach in the house and use it in many dishes. even so there are times when I have to throw the last of it out because it's going bad. Now that I have this recipe that problem is solved! I made it for the first time last night and could have happily eaten it as my whole dinner. The flavors are wonderful together. I used half of a 16 ounce box of spinach and cut the dressing recipe in half, and used shallots rather than red onions. It was perfect.

my spinach didn't really wilt but this was still delicious.. knowing how me and bf are i left out the honey and doubled the red wine vinegar (we love tart and punchy).. also lessened the sesame seed oil by a third.. i wanted a quick side for dinner so i left out the onion and hard boiled egg.. i might lessen the salt just a bit next time as it was a little on the salty side.. ty for the recipe

My husband loved this, my 4 kids weren't thrilled with it, I thought it was declicious, but too salty.  The oldest child said the eggs were the key to enjoying the salad, but by that time, the younger three had already eaten their eggs and were just left with the spinach and onion staring back at them.  I will make this again, but I will cut the salt in half.  Oh, I substituted pine nuts for the almonds because I was out and didn't realize it until after I had already been to the grocery store.  I would make it with either nut going forward.

One substitution, olive oil for the canola I didn’t have. After the first bite, I began wishing I had reduced the sesame oil. However, by the third bite I was smitten. The flavors meld very nicely; thanks for a great salad.

Excellent!  And so easy.  I used 3/4 of a 6 oz. bag of spinach.  Tossed with part of the dressing and then cooked onions for a while in remaining dressing.  This will be a staple in my recipe box.

I tried this recipe for 2. I honestly think it needs more spinach. As for everything else, it tasted good. I did however cut back on the honey just a hint and honestly I think I could go with the amount called for. Now, I think I might add a bit more spinach as I felt that I was having too much leftover dressing. The dressing itself in my opinion is very good and could be added to other leafy salads for making it a winter dish!

I made this salad as described in the recipe, and it's delicious.  The combination of flavors is simple but wonderful, and it's very easy to put this together.  I heated the oil first and then added the vinegar which resulted in a lot of spitting and messiness, so next time I'll add everything and heat it all more slowly.

We loved this salad and will use this recipe over and over!  I used only 1/2 tsp. salt in dressing, but other than that, made it as printed.  I added sliced water chestnuts to spinach, sautéed red onion and sliced baby bella mushrooms and added to spinach with dressing.  Cracked black pepper on top and sliced boiled egg.  So good!!

Great salad for a quick & healthful side. I added goat cheese on top which was the perfect compliment. Drizzle the extra dressing over salmon and you have an awesome 15-minute meal!

This was just ok for us. I thought the dressing had too much vinegar in it. I probably wouldn't make this again.

I made this tonight just for myself because hubby's out of town and he's not big on hard boiled eggs. Wow I was licking the dish! The only thing I didn't have on hand was the canola oil so I used evoo. Excellent Mstrecke, thank you for a wonderful salad, if I make this for company I 'll increase the ingredients.
