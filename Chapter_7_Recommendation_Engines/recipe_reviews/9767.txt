I love pistachios so I thought I would like this recipe. However as stated by other reviews I found this dough sticky and there were way to many nuts in them. More of a shortbread consistency which I also love,but these were just not for me.

Okay, maybe I didn't know what to expect from these, but I thought they would be a little more cookie-like. Mine turned out very crumbly (maybe the flour I put on my hands to keep them from sticking to me!) and tasted entirely like pistachios. I really like pistachios, but still I would've preferred more of a pistachio-laced cookie than a ball of baked pistachios. Maybe I did something wrong. I thought it was a waste of good nuts.

This recipe turned out to be tasty enough, but I do think the name is misleading. These are not "crisps" at all - they turned out to be rich, dense, almost bread-like....kind of a tea cookie. My husband & I were expecting thin, crunchy, crisp, sweet. Also, I found it much easier to form individual cookies than roll out this STICKY dough.

My wife made these for a neighborhood gathering. Everyone loved them, and several asked for the recipe.I almost talked her out of making these little jewels due to the average reviews. That would have been a mistake. I can't believe that one person actually criticized this recipe 'cause they tasted way too much like pistachios,. Make sure you give these a fare chance.

These should be renamed to Pistachio Crumbles.  I made half the recipe and I'm glad I did. They taste alright.

I reduced the amount of nuts(still a lot!), formed individual cookies, and cooked a bit longer to make "Crisp" -ier. The resulting product was a dry and crumbly but delicious cookie that would go well with milk or tea. Will make again surely.

Mine were not crusepy but they are delightful cookies.  If the dough is too sticky just add a little more flour.  Based on everyones complaints I reduced the amount of pistachios by a half cup and they turned out great.  These are delicious and I've been asked for the recipe many times.

This recipe ingreidents were great but however like others The dough was sticky and kept cracking up on the sides. I just put the dough together and cooked it on the stove and put it into crumbs. My family loved it(even in crumb form). I had to cook this again to make my family satisified.
