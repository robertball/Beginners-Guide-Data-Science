I was a little skeptical when mixing potatoes with brussels sprouts, but I have to say that this is one of the best brussels sprouts recipes I've ever tasted.  The flavor and texture contrasts are amazing.  Flavorful, healthy, and colorful.  Thanks for sharing!

I am a big fan of potatoes, and of brussels sprouts, so I really enjoyed this, but my husband didn't think much of it.  It's sort of bland, but not unlike a good Irish cabbage meal--I'd say it needs to be served with a peppery meat dish to be a good compliment.  BTW--we used green peppers (for the expense issue), and it was fine.  I'm sure the red pepper would add that extra little flavor (I love the red, yellow & orange bell peppers!), but it's out of our current budget.  Works fine with green bell.  I'll fix this again...for St. Patty's Day!

We loved this!  It was easy and tasty and my kids asked for seconds.  We used it as a vegetarian entree and found it very satisfying.

This recipe reminds me somewhat of the Irish "Bubble and Squeak"  that is so delicious.  Rather than criticise someones recipe for lack of salt, why can't you just add salt and pepper to taste?  Most people do anyways.  I think this is a beautiful and very tasty dish.  Thank you so much for one more thing to add to my recipe book.  I'll enjoy it often.

I liked the combination of veggies this recipe called for. It was simple to make but was very bland in flavor and for that reason i give it a 3. It needs more than a bayleaf and pepper for seasoning. The recipe didnt even call for salt!

Brussels Sprouts, most people love them or hate them. This is a great way to get them in and change someone's mind. I did ad some garlic, but that is just because I love garlic.

I added Kielbasa, I got the idea in another Allrecipes recipe, and it was GREAT. This is a very colorful meal that is easy to make and will get you kudos at your next dinner. Will make this many more times!

I used a green pepper because that is what I had on hand. It was good. My husband said that he likes plain brussel sprouts just as much. But he would like to have them again. I think they would taste good with some garlic too. The potatoes needed to be cooked less or maybe I should have cut them into bigger chunks. I will make again for sure.

I added some garlic for extra flavor...otherwise followed the recipe but my Brussels sprouts burned!  I had lowered the heat (which was not in the directions) and also added extra broth.  Otherwise, it was a good taste and something different to do with Brussels sprouts.

These were really good. I wanted to do something with brussel sprouts besides 'heat and eat'. I omitted the red bell pepper (didn't have any). I also added a large clove of chopped garlic. We will be having this again.

I only give 4 stars because I had to change the original.  I used skin on red potatoes and did add salt,  I didn't use the chicken stock or red pepper.  With my changes this side dish was great,  will make again.

With most of my favorite vegetables included in this recipe, I couldn't wait to prepare this side dish. 

DELICIOUS!  All of the ingredients compliment each other and create a blended flavor not known to have ever existed before.  

I followed the recipe completely.  I used 1 fresh laurel bay leaf instead of the dried variety sold at grocery stores.  If you don't already have your won laurel bay leaf tree (sometimes known as sweet bay leaf), then invest a few dollars and buy a small one.  You will not regret the purchase.

Thank you Rhiannone for providing this wonderful recipe!

--- SECOND REVIEW -- ***** - five stars again.  This recipe is consistently superb.  The potatoes dampen the harshness of the brussels sprouts which in turn brings out the sweet flavors.  Totally amazing, and worthy of taking to a pot-luck gathering.
