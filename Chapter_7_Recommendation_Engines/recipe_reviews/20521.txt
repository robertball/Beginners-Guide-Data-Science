Excellent smoothie. I don't care for blueberries and I didn't have any soy powder so they were omitted. However, I added a cube or two of crushed ice to make it more "chilled" and added a tsp of vanilla. Very good! Served with breakfast but it makes for a healthy snack! Thanks Amy.

I didn't have any strawberries or soy milk powder, and this recipe turned out just fine. I just left the recipe without strawberries, and instead added 2 heaping tsp of wheat germ for an extra healthy kick. It was delicious! I poured it into a squirt bottle and used it in my lunch the next day.

The bitterness of the plain yogurt overpowered the smoothie.  Maybe I'll add a couple tablespoons of Splenda next time, or use vanilla yogurt.

This is a wonderful snack!  I was so pleased with the way this turned out!  The last time I made it,  I used the orange juice that is blended with strawberrys (or the grapefruit kind if you like a little tang!) and it tasted really good too!

Great for breakfast!  I used fat free vanilla yogurt and I don't have soy milk powder so I just used skim milk in it's place.  All it needed was a bit of crushed ice and a straw.

Very good Amy.  I didn't have the strawberries so I used 1 can of mandarin oranges and added some vanilla extract like another reviewer.  Would make this again.  Thanks

It was good. I used vanilla yogurt and didn't add the soy milk. It wasn't quite what I expected. It just reminded me of a yogurt with lots of good fruit on the bottom. I think next time I will try vanilla ice cream instead of yogurt.

This was excellent. I added a dash of strawberry extract. I used no fat cheap yogurt and splenda to taste. I toasted wheat germ and mixed it in as served. I used 2bs of carnation powdered milk to make it creamier.

DELICIOUS! I've been trying to find and make a good smoothie recipe, but I'm sticking with this one now for sure. It's really thick and filling, and the plain greek yogurt I used gave it the perfect touch! However, I did not have soy milk powder, but I think it tasted just as good without it!

Yum!! This was very refreshing. I didn't add the soy powder, threw in some flaxseed, and used assorted frozen berries. Otherwise followed everything perfectly. The only change I would make next time is to add some honey because it was a tiny bit sour. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Nothing unusual about this smoothie, but very good.  I used soy milk powder and soy yogurt, added flax seeds and bee pollen.  Made a great breakfast.

I split all ingredients in half and omitted the milk powder.  I used all frozen fruit, vanilla flavored Greek yogurt (way more protein than regular yogurt), a bit more OJ, and a little bit of 2% milk to thin it out a bit.  SO GOOD I drank it all myself!

Very simple, easy, quick, and yummy. I had no powdered soy, so used powdered skim milk. Also threw 2 ice cubes in the blender. Put leftovers in the fridge, and next day it was good, too.

Simple recipe that lends itself to customization.  I forgot to pick up soy milk powder at the grocery store so I omitted it.  I also did not have ripe bananas so I only used 1.  I added a mango just cause.  I also used fresh blueberries but added ice to keep it chilled.  I used fat free yogurt as well.  Very tasty.  The trouble is making yourself only have 1 serving since there's a lot of sugar in it.

One of the best smoothies I've ever had!  I didn't have soy powder, so I used soy milk, and I added a tsp of sugar to make it a little sweeter.  Loved it!

This was pretty good!! I used frozen strawberries & I probably should have used fresh cause I would have liked more of that taste. But it was still good, very thick! Almost like drinking a yogurt lol

I LOVED this smoothie! I added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement instead of soy mik powder and made fresh squeezed orage juice for this, which it does make a difference than store juice. I will definitely make this again!

This is one of those smoothies, that one really has to like yogurt in their smoothies to like it. I thought the yogurt taste was heavy. I was able to modify it some, but the yogurt bite was still there. The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half and it made plenty.

Nice healthy smoothie!! I rated this a 5 because I could not find soy milk powder in any of the stores  where I went shopping for these ingredients (and I know this will enhance the flavor). I used regular dry milk instead and it still came out great!! Thank you Amy, I will be making this again in the future.

This was great! It gave me a chance to use up some frozen strawberries/blueberries from my deep freeze and some over ripe bananas. No soy milk powder but I did have nonfat milk powder which I used instead. I didn't get four servings out of this, but just enough for my two boys to each have one. Simple and a great way to get added calcium and a serving of fruit into my kids. I think this would make a great summer ice pop for the kids, too.

Yum! Now, I only had vanilla yogurt on hand which inevidably sweetened this up and I also didn't have any soy milk powder so I skipped it... But yummy none the less :)

This is a tasty treat.  Like iheartnitz, did not have soy powder, so subbed wheat germ.  Used all frozen fruits, as that was what was in house.  Also used lowfat Dannon vanilla yogurt in place of plain.  Only used one banana, as don't really care for them.  Thanks for sharing!  Update: used apple fiber with pectin in place of the wheat germ, fresh blueberries, frozen strawberries and only one bannana.  Even better!

This was a great smoothie! I made it for my kids for breakfast and they loved it. I didn't add the soy milk powder but I did add a bit of flax seed to it... about 1/2 tsp. Will make this again for sure!

Really good staple recipe. I use vanilla yogurt in lieu of the plain just because it's a little sweeter and goes better with the fruit. No soy milk powder, but it's not necessary. I also did add ice. My 2 year old and I have these every morning for breakfast.  Delicious!

I make a smoothie like this all the time, but never have any soy powder on hand.  I prefer all of my fruit frozen too, this makes it more "slushy".  I'd just like to point out that bananas are, in fact, a no-fat food.  They have 0 grams of fat.  Just to clear that up.

Great base smoothie recipe though I only used 1 banana(bananas are a high fat fruit) and used fresh blueberries instead of frozen.  I did skip the soy powder and have tried out several different flavors of yogurt and love vanilla, cherry vanilla, and mixed berry the best.  I love adding ice for a thicker smoothie and a handful of almonds as well.  Very healthy and can easily suppliment a meal.

The thing about this recipe is, even if u don't have a few of the ingredients, you can substitute them or just leave them out - and this still tastes good!  And, it is also, as the name says,healthy!

Yum! We left out the soy and used a little less banana, I think, but I loved the combination of flavors. I think we also added a small amount of sugar to ours. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Love this easy and healthy recipe-a great way to squeeze fruits into your day in a big way.  I can't eat soy, so I substituted a spoonful of oats for extra fiber.

This is how I always make our smoothies, except I use sweetened yogurt.  Our basics (for two people) are 1 cup sweetened yogurt (we make our own in a yogurt maker), 1 banana, assorted fresh and frozen fruits and 100% fruit juice to make it the right consistency.  Tree Top makes a juice blend from 5 or 6 juices that looks like V8 Splash and I usually use that.  These smoothies are a great way to start the day!

MMMMMM! What a tasty and healthy way to get in your servings of fruit! I like to pre-assemble the ingredients the night before and make this for breakfast. Like most reviewers, I've left the soy powder out, and it's still great. I've also used blackberries instead of blueberries, and altered the ingredients due to the amount I've had on hand. Easy to make and worth a try! BTW for those that are interested, a 6" banana has 0g fat, 24g carbs, 1g protein and about 90 calories.

All of my fruit was frozen which probably caused my blender to have a  hard time moving. I added some milk which helped. I used plain Greek yogurt, maybe half of what was called for. I also added about a tsp of honey and some vanilla protein powder. Nice summer smoothie with good thickness and delicious flavor! Thanks for the recipe, Amy!

Some smoothies can get pretty high in fat and calories, but this one's not bad.  I probably added more blueberries than called for, but liked all the fruit flavors in this smoothie.

A healthy, tasty afternoon snack to tie me over till dinnertime. I didn't have the soy milk powder, but it didn't seem to matter. This is certainly a smoothie that will stand up well to variations, like using vanilla yogurt in place of the plain.

Made this with only a couple of changes. I added 1 tsp vanilla, no soy powder (didn't have any) and used a bag of mixed berries instead of the blue/strawberries alone.  Tasted great!  My 4 year old could not get enough!

I loved this recipe!  I had to substitute a few things though.  I used mixed berries and only 1 banana.  I used vanilla yogurt b/c it's all I had.  It turned out really well. My little girl and I loved it.  I also used a tablespoon of milled flax seed.
