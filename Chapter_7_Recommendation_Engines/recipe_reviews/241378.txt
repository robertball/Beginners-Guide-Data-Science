Change the sugar to either brown sugar or molasses. Once ribs are coated place in oven, cover well with foil, slow name at 300Â° for several hours. Much better.

It's not so much that I didn't like it, it is just that they aren't very "barbecue saucy" when done.  Sure - they did cook thru (a little extra time for my oven) and the sauce does have a nice flavor, but the fat from the meat thinned the sauce out so much that after all the basting  there wasn't any evidence of it after being served.

Personally I like my barbecued meats to show the evidence, whether it was a dry rub or a 'wet' sauce such as this recipe.

I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the dry rub, and it was delicious.  What's BBQ without nutmeg!?!

Made a few modifications: subbed apple cider vinegar, cut celery salt to 1T, omitted extra plain salt, added a little extra pepper.  We also cooked on the grill between 280-300 degrees for 4 hours (really could have gone another half hour to reach perfect fall of the bone, melt in your mouth tenderness, but it was getting late). Seasoned the ribs lightly with a salt-free grilling blend, then basted lightly with the sauce as it cooked and topping with the rest at the end. The sauce is good, if on the tart/tangy side and does have that catsup flavor; not bad unless you prefer a sweeter BBQ sauce.
