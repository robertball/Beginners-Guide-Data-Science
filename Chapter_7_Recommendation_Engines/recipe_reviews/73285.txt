Oh my - what a sandwich! I lightly toasted the bread first. I had some fresh garden tomatoes that I put a little kosher salt and cracked black pepper onto before broiling. I also used a combination of mozzarella and fontina cheeses. I don't even think the pesto is necessary so if you don't like it don't use it and you'll still have a great sandwich that let's the tomato shine.

Just made this for lunch and it was delicious!  It looked just as great as it tasted too.  I may salt the tomatoes a little after broiling next time, but that'd be the only thing I would change.  YUM!

This is awesome when I find myself with no time to cook - for the non-vegetarians in my family; I simply add their favorite meat!

This was okay.  The pesto was a bit strong, so I would go a little lighter next time.  I would also mix up the cheeses and put a couple different kinds on.

Excellent flavor!  I used some multi-grain ciabatta rolls that my grocery store carries and instead of broiling, I used my stovetop grill pan and cooked panini-style.  Didn't measure the pesto and I used baby spinach instead of lettuce.  Fontina is a new favorite cheese for me - it melts so beautifully and tastes delicious!  Loved this sandwich!

Excellent! Made it for a bridal shower along with other dishes, and it was a big hit. Easy to assemble ahead of time and just broil before serving.
