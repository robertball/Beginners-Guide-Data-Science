Not good! Followed the instructions to the letter. After 6 hrs in a crock pot the sausage turned to mush in the casings. The texture was awful. The peppers and sauce was very good together, which was nice. This recipe is not good for a slow cooker. Next time I'll do this in a pan on the stove top!

I liked this recipe, it came out delicious and my friends loved it!! I like that it has sauce because whenever I eat traditional peppers and sausage I always want sauce on it. I browned my sausage (only used sweet sausage) before putting in the crock pot, I used my homemade sauce and I cooked it on low for about 3 hours. The sausages were tender but didn't fall apart. I would definitely adjust the cooking time depending on how your crock pot cooks. Its great over noodles or in a hoagie roll
