I actually tried this in the crockpot today.  I seasoned the breasts with the paprika, garlic powder and black pepper as called for in the recipe and then browned them in two tablespoons of butter.  I placed the breasts in the crockpot, poured the soup mixture on top of them (I did not saute the mushrooms before mixing them with the soup) and cooked it on high for three hours.  It turned out perfect.  We served it over rice and the whole family really loved it (even my picky seven-year-old!)

This was really good after I tweaked a few things. I cut out the mushrooms, and switched to light sour cream. I sauteed chopped celery, onion, green pepper and minced garlic before making the sauce. I also added all of the spices straight into the sauce rather than sprinkling on top of the chicken. I poured a bit of the sauce on to the bottom of the pan, put the chicken in, and then poured the rest over the top, and did not cover it. The sauce wasn't very watery that way, the chicken stayed moist, and it was pretty flavorful.

This is wonderful, and with a little tweaking can be very healthy!  I nixed the butter and sauteed the mushrooms with olive oil and onions.  I used non-fat sour cream (can't tell the difference) and added some garlic (of course!).  I agree that the sauce was a little runny, but it didn't bother me - it tasted just great over brown rice.  A+

Husband and daughter weren't crazy about it...kind of bland.  Probably would have sprinkled dry onion soup across top as opposed to pinch of paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder.

Sauteed the mushrooms, peppers and celery (and I added onion to the sautee) before adding to the soup mixture. Easy recipe, a really tender and flavorful dish! Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe.  I served it with white rice and peas.  It was a big hit!! It is certainly something I'll try when I have company over.  Thanks!

Sauteed onions and celery in olive oil.  After a few minutes, added mushrooms.  Used red wine as no white open (thinking coq au vin).  Tossed in a bag of frozen, grilled chicken strips and heated through.  Finally added celery soup, sour cream, and some TJ's Everyday Seasoning.   Served over rice.  This was quick and satisfying.  It would be a perfect meal to take to someone who hasn't been feeling well, to a family with small children, or to an elderly neighbor.

The flavor of this dish turned out to be quite nice, and it was a pleasant change from other recipes.  I took the advice of other cooks and cooked it uncovered so that it wouldn't turn into a "soup."  I'm very glad I did that.  I also followed advice to brown the chicken first, then reduce the cooking time in the oven.

This was really good and easy.  I love white wine so I usally like any thing cooked with it. The only thing I changed was adding onions.  I will be making this again.

Very easy, and yummy! I would add a splash more wine, or marinate the chicken ahead of time in wine, like another reviewer suggests. I might serve with pasta next time so I can enjoy more of the delicious sauce!

This is one of the BEST meals that I have ever made.  I marinated the chicken in white wine before completing the recipe for a little extra flavor.  My husband and I LOVED it!!!

I saw Nicolette's review & I have most of a rotissirie chicken left over from lunch a couple of days ago, so I copied her idea of adapting this to a freezer meal. I used baby portobellos & did not slice them, omitted the celery (was out), doubled the soup & wine (adding a bit extra), added about half a cup of chicken broth, used chopped roasted garlic for the powdered & added about half a cup of sliced shallots. I was also out of sour cream so I subbed 4 oz. of room-temp nuefatchel. I sauteed the mushrooms, then added the bell pepper & then added the shallots. Deglazed the pan w/ wine & added the soup & liquids, allowing it to simmer for a few minutes. Then I added the neufatchel; mixed well & added the chopped chicken. Had some for lunch on top of egg noodles & froze the rest. It was very good!

This was pretty good.  I don't like mushrooms, so omitted them and sauteed the celery and (red) bell pepper, with a couple minced garlic cloves - why use powdered?  I also used cream of chicken soup, since that's what I had.  This is very similar to an old recipe from Joy of Cooking that mixes sour cream with a can of soup and pours it over the breasts.  So I poured the sauce over the breasts.  I baked it uncovered to keep the sauce from getting runny, per complaints from other reviewers.  Served it over mashed sweet potatoes - very good!

Not bad.  Great sauce.  Could be done in the slow cooker.  Maybe add a little more garlic next time.  Would be good over rice.

Yum - this is like a chicken version of beef stroganoff - love the sour cream. I didn't change it except I followed the advice of many reviewers and cooked it uncovered so as not to make it soupy. Served it over rice - very nice for a "casserole" - even my casserole-hating husband ate this one.

I browned the breasts in my George Forman grill first for a little extra color and flavor, and then I cut the cooking time down to 45 minutes.  It was enjoyed by the whole family and was easy to do after work.

In a pinch for 'freezer friendly' meals, but not fond of canned cream-of recipes, I found this to be a good base recipe -- better, though, if enhanced.  To save some time, I made this on the stovetop by browning the seasoned chicken with the mushrooms, celery, pepper, minced garlic and chopped onion.  Then I just plunked in the sauce ingredients (probably added a touch more wine to thin) and adjusted the seasonings to taste.  When defrosted and reheated, this can be served over egg noodles or rice.  Easy and filling... thanks!

Yummy dish!  I substituted cream of celery soup with lowfat/sodium cream of celery soup, sour cream with low fat sour cream, and garlic powder with a bit of real garlic and it turned out very tasty!  Tasted even better as leftovers!

An average recipe with an average taste.  Definitely not five stars, three at most.  I agree with the other review that said it had a bland taste.
Althought it was easy, I probably wouldn't make it again.

Fantastic! I doubled the sauce and used 6 fairly large chicken breats; served it with Uncle Ben's chicken-flavored rice. I cut the leftover chicken into bite-sized pieces, and mixed it with the leftover rice and sauce for a delicious "leftovers casserole."  Even my picky kids enjoyed this dish.

I also was pleasantly surprised by this recipe as it was simpler than I am accustomed to cooking - an unusual but pleasant and mild combination of flavors. I took the advice of others and thickened the sauce toward the end with a bit of arrowroot/water combo - FYI arrowroot is a healthier and less taste-noticable thickener than cornstarch or flour alternatives.  I also changed the green peppers to red and thought it was more colorful.

Sauce was too thin. I used portabella mushrooms which enhanced flavor. I might try baking uncovered for half of cooking time to thicken  the sauce. This recipe is VERY TASTY and was a hit in my house.

I tried this recipe and thought it was great! After reading the comments, I added 1/4C of diced yellow onion, used mushrooms from a jar which I had on hand, red pepper instead and sauteed all the vegetables first as that's they way my husband prefers. I also followed the recommendation of the frozen grilled chicken strips which made it super fast and easy. I think the grilled chicken gives it a nice flavor. I served over brown rice. This is definately going in my recipe box and I plan to make again that next time my daughters come to town. Easy and delicious!!

Sauce is a little thin but I will probably add a T of cornstarch next time around.  Very tasty and can be made ahead of time for a very fancy looking meal.

It tasted great and was so easy.  I actually prepared the sauce ahead of time and just added the chicken and baked it later.  The sauce was a little thin so I recommend thickening it up a bit.

Made the recipe exactly as written and my family enjoyed it. I can see making this again.
