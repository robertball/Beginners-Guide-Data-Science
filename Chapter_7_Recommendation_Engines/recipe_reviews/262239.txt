I strain the yogurt for about 2 days and this makes the perfect, thick and creamy Greek s Yogurt. Perfect batch each time.

I love this recipe! It is yummy and so easy. I do not have a self cleaning oven, but with some accommodations this recipe works wonderfully in my non self cleaning oven. When I heat and then call the milk on the stove top, I cover the pot and put the whole pot in the oven, instead of in jars. I also preheat the oven to the lowest setting available (200°F instead of 170°F) for half an hour. I appreciate the oven before are you start heating the milk, and that the temperature in the oven even out and cool down a little bit while the milk heats up.

For flavoring, I used concentrated frozen orange juice. Or to taste.
