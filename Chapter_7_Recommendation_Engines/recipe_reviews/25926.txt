This was a fun recipe to try. I used chicken breast tenders, and added some chicken broth to the sauce (I stirred the cranberries and pineapple together instead of layering) and put it in the oven and then had to rush out of the house. OOPS! Well, that was ok. It was awesome! The sauce got thick and sticky. I loved it. The chicken was so tender and juicy. We won't have it every week, because it is a very memorable flavor. I will save it for special occasions.

I seared the chicken breasts too so they wouldn't look so anemic.  I don't know if you really need 4 POUNDS of chicken, I used about 2 pounds.  Very good, a little overcooked at 45 minutes -- will reduce to 30 minutes next time. Served over jasmine rice with a side of green beans.  Whole family loved it.  Very easy to prepare on a working day.

This sounds very much like a recipe I had years ago that called for sausages and could be served in a chafing dish.  It was always a great success.  I now plan to serve this(thanks for the memory kicker)along with other buffet  items at our "Let's celebrate Christmas" we're hosting on Nov 30/03 using chunks in place of whole breasts and will pick up the suggestion of one of your contributors to lightly brown the chicken breasts first.  Can't be too careful about chicken that is not fully cooked. Happy Thanksgiving America from a Canadian friend.

This recipe was great, but next time I make it I think I will sear the chicken in a pan before baking it.  Tasted great and it was healthy!!

The whole family loved this dish, and it was economical, fast, and simple to make.  It would be good around the holidays also. This dish would be suitable for company. I served it with mashed potatoes and italian green beens.

This is a very easy dish. My children loved the fruity flavor, and it tasted nice with buttery basmati rice as a side dish. Next time, I will add a bit of chicken broth to warm up the sauce a bit.

I tried this last night on a whim and loved it!  It's incredibly easy and fast to prepare.  I served it with Brussels sprouts and wheat rice pilaf, both complimented the chicken nicely.  I think the next time I make it I might add some chopped red onion just for an added kick.  Oh, and it passed the boyfriend test with flying colors!

Awesome!  I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken breasts.  My friend actually made these at her house and I loved it.  Full of flavor.  I would have never thought of combining these flavors, but it really was good and very moist!

This was really a great dish! The chicken had a great flavor and was really tender! I took the idea of a previous reviewer and served it with special seasoned green beans, mashed potatoes, and homemade bread! Yummy dinner!!

I made this last night. I did have to adjust the cooking time as I used large bone in breasts instead of boneless ones. I don't understand how anyone could say that this was bland. I followed the recipe but was liberal with the cinnamon. DH & I both thought this was amazingly good! Our sides were green peas and white rice. I know I will make this one again and again!

Made as written but added 1 tsp. allspice, 2 cloves minced garlic and some chopped onion. Next time will try adding a touch of cardemon too.

I halved this recipe. I also seared the breasts and applied cinnamon directly to the chicken as well, although I added a dusting of nutmeg also which I think gave it a nice background flavor. The flavor is VERY good but doesn't seem to permeate the chicken, so I agree that it might be better as a slow cooker recipe. I'll probably play around with it. Thanks for a great idea and a tasty easy dinner

The flavor was fantastic.  Chicken was moist and juicy, and the cranberry/pineapple mixture actually tasted like a warm cinnamon applesauce.  Have already passed this recipe on to friends, and will definitely make it again.  We loved it!

This is a really simple and delicious way to do chicken. The fruit and cinnamon gave a exotic twist to the usual chicken dinner. Thanks for the submission.

I threw all the ingredients in a slow cooker on low for 10 hours, and it turned out pretty well.

YUM!  My family likes lots of sauce, so I used closer to 2 lbs of chicken (and cooked for half the time).  Very moist and delish!

Delicious!  I couldn't believe how yummy such a simple recipe was.  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  My husband and I both loved it.  UPDATE:  My husband was trying not to hurt my feelings when he said he loved this dish.  Turns out he actually hates it.  But I still think its delicious!

Browned chicken first, but the end result was delicisous. Served with stuffing and a salad and it was a filling meal indeed.

Made as directed the first time and enjoyed it. Later, I made it again, with a few tweaks. I prepared a box of instant stuffing mix and spread into greased 9x12-inch baking dish.Grilled the chicken, and arranged over stuffing. Then mixed 1/2-cup barbecue sauce,1/4-cup of the drained pineapple juice with the cranberry sauce and spooned over the chicken. Then, baked as directed. Turned out very nice. Very economical dish.

This dish was OK but something was missing.  It is kind of bland and needs something to round out it's flavor.

This has good flavor, but it is what it is: pineapple and cranberry flavored sauce with chicken. Simple flavors. That said, I cooked mine with breasts in the crockpot and served with rice a roni.  The presentation wasn't great- the color was yellow-brown.  The sauce was thin.  But the flavor with the rice was tasty. 3 stars for taste, 4 for the ease of making and the healthy outcome.

After reading the one review that said you'll either hate this or love it, nothing in between - I'm an in-betweener! It was a fast and easy meal but we realized we don't like hot mushy fruit with our chicken! It was very moist but not until I put cashews over it was it edible. It was missing something but all I could think of was maybe some brown sugar to cut the tartness of the fruit - but perhaps others like it that way. Won't be making it again though.

I really liked this, but my husband thought it was way too sweet; thus the 4 stars.  I only used about 1-1/2 pounds of chicken and I cut it into chunks.  Browned it in olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Only had jellied cranberry sauce, so I used that with the pineapple, mixing it up well.  After browning the chicken, I seasoned it with Penzey's cassia cinnamon (more than a 1/2 tsp.) and a pinch of nutmeg.  Still in the skillet, I poured the pineapple mixture over, covered and baked 15 minutes.  Uncovered and baked another 15 minutes.  I stirred in some passionfruit vinegar I got in a specialty store just before serving.  Served over steamed white rice with roasted asparagus.  I'd make it again, if only....

Very good. Halved the recipe because I had 2 pounds of chicken. Cooked at 375 covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered at 425 for 15 minutes because I had to cook something else at the higher temp. Still turned out juicy, not overcooked at all. A good way to use up leftover cranberry sauce and a good weeknight recipe.

This chicken was very moist and delicious. I love the cinnamon with the cranberries and it smells so sweet in the oven. I only used 3 lbs of chicken so I had some extra sauce. I served this with brown rice with craisins and pineapple chucks and put the extra sauce on top. I will definitely make this again.

This is absolutely great. I made this for a crew on a tug boat and everyone raved about it. I had a whole pineapple that I peeled and sliced. I reserved the larger slices and minced the small pieces and mix in with the cranberry sauce. Spread on chicken breasts, then topped with the large slices and covered with fresh ground cinnamon. Bake according to directions. When I uncovered it there was quite a bit of juice that I put in a small sauce pan, reduced and add a little 'Wondera' to thicken. Served with baked sweet potatoes and beans. A light, healthy dish that leaves every sense satisfied!

I felt conflicted as to what rating to give this dish because there's really two distinctive things about it.  On one hand, it doesn't get much easier to make a dish then this. There's no mixing, measuring or chopping.  You dump a can of cranberry and a can of pinnapple over the chicken and cook it.  This makes it a good dish if you're tired, a bachelor or just lazy.  On the other hand, the chicken was pretty bland.  It definitely needs something else to give it that kick.  Some people have suggested chicken broth, I might try throwing a little bit of soy sauce or teriyaki if you feel like experimenting with it, but as is it's lacking the taste explosion that you get from more complicated recipes.    It does taste good, but there

Very simple and so quick to make.  I was worried about it being too sweet and it wasn't at all. It was tender and juicy! My 2yr old daughter gobbled it up.  I served it with steamed brocolli and it made a wonderful healthy meal.  This is a keeper.

This was really good. I used a cinnamon-sugar mix because that's what I had on hand and I'm glad I did because I think it would have been a bit bitter with just cinnamon. I served it with white rice. I will definitely make it again. :) Thanks.

So easy and delicious! I got my vegetarian friends to eat it! I used whole cranberry sauce and crushed pineapple in natural juice. I also added some chicken boullion and allspice to the mix...gave it some nice flavor.

This recipe sounded really good when I was in the mood for something different.  But, it was a disappointment.  It seemed very watery and I didn't care for the consistency of the sauce.  Sorry, but I don't think that I will make this again.

According to reviews, people either really like this or really don't, no in between. My family is in the latter catagory.  Chicken was very bland and pineapple cranberry produced a very unappetizing liquid.  My husband, who likes almost everything says "don't make this again".

This is a keeper! I seared the breasts first, sprinkled cinnamon directly on the chicken then over the pineapple, & served it with Jasmine rice & steamed green beans. A wonderfully simple yet absolutely delicious recipe.

Finally made this recipe after printing it several years ago and thought it was very good. Didn't use 4 pounds of chicken, used 4 breasts instead. Made my own cranberry sauce using 1 lb of fresh cranberries (added 1 cup each of sugar/water then cooked in the microwave for 10 minutes)and diced a whole, fresh pineapple. Ok, so it took a litle more time; the flavor was great and the leftovers the next day tasted better. Served with Basmati rice. However, if you use the tins of cranberry sauce & pineapple I'm sure it will still taste great. Thanks L. Robertson for your recipe.

It is absolutely insane how delicious and easy this recipe is!  The only thing I did a bit different was to season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Maybe that's implied... I don't know.  All I know is I have to restrain myself from making this every day.

This is a great recipe to try something besides plain old chicken or pork chops. I have used both chicken and pork chops and my family loved them both. I have served it with potatoes and rice. Not everyone in the family likes pineapple or cranberry, but mixed they are perfect. I use the jellied or smooth cranberries, because some people don't like the texture of the whole.

This went over pretty well at my house.  I added some broth to the sauce like other reviewers suggested so it would be a little "saucy" and we served it over mashed potatoes.  Will probably try it again without the broth just to see the difference.

This was a really good, easy recipe. I always brine the chicken before cooking it. I mixed the pineapple and cranberry sauce together and poured it over the chicken, and didn't add the cinnamon. There was enough moisture to keep it juicy. I served it over quinoa - it was sweet and yummy with all of the extra sauce!

I didnt like this too much. But it was edible. I think if it would of been just cranberry sauce or just pineapple it would of been better. Overall it was okay, just not for me. it smelled wonderful when it was cooking.

I really liked this chicken dish.  I added chicken broth because I served it over rice and wanted it to be nice and juicy.  I also didn't layer; I mixed the pineapple and cranberry together. Since it tasted even better the next day, I think next time I will let the chicken marinate in the mixture overnight. I also think I will add a little bit of brown sugar to compliment the cinnamon.

This dish was VERY tasty.  I followed the directions, prep time was a breeze, threw it in the oven and didn't worry about until the timer went off, removed the cover for the rest of the recommended time and served over rice.  I'm not a cook, so a skeptical husband and a son who doesn't like pineapple were the big test.  They ate every last piece!  I will definitely prepare this again and I've already passed the recipe on to other family members.  THANKS!

The recipe sounds good, but is it really a half pound of chicken per serving?  Seems like a pretty large amount, especially when you're talking pure meat (i.e. no bones).

Ok I realize this makes the recipe completely different, but I'm diabetic, so to avoid the sugar I used unsweetened applesauce in place of both the cranberry & pineapple.  Otherwise followed the same cooking instructions as to temperature and time, and it came out nicely.  THis would be great with potato pancakes, but I can't have those either :(

I loved how simple and quick this was to throw together! It was tasty to boot. I didn't have any crushed pineapple so I just mashed up some pineapple chunks. I also added some of the juice from the pineapple instead of draining it all. I forgot to cover the chicken like the recipe says to, but it still turned out really moist and delicious. Like some others have stated, it did not take the whole cook time to finish.

The pineapple and cranberry blended well together but all in all, the chicken still came out quite dry.  Maybe using dark meat, perhaps?  Some revisions to the recipe need to be made to improve the dish.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I love eating pineapple with my chicken and adding the cranberry sauce and cinnmon was an excellent touch!  I think I would've liked it better from a slow-cooker, though, instead of from the oven.  Overall, great recipe!!

My family and I loved this.  I used a whole pineapple ... not a canned one.  Served with fresh green beans and my own orange juice/rice/manadarin orange/broccoli side dish ... delicious!

My husband and kids loved the fruit on their chicken. We served it with mashed potatoes and french cut green beans. This is great for around the holidays and for something different. Thanks!

I think this may be an all time favorite.  Yet like always I adjusted a bit...I only needed 4 breasts and I used a 9x9 pan.  The girls at work tried this over the weekend and their kids loved it.  So quick and simple too.

I liked this recipe because it was super easy however, it needed something... im not sure what exactley.. maybe next time ill put the cinnamon on the chicken then the fruit.. also drain the pineapple because it gets a little watery. i don't know what kind of spice you can use with fruit to give it a better kick.. maybe nutmeg? i dunno but the leftovers are good. all in all its a good recipe to experiment with.

I did exactly as instructed, except I took 5 minutes about off the cooking time. The chicken came out very tender and fully cooked. The chicken wasn't too sweet, but very flavorfull. 5 Stars!

We forgot to add the cinnamon, but this was very good with rice and broccoli.  Since we had everything on hand, made a homemade cranberry sauce and cut up a pineapple.

Was better than expected -- the fruit flavor was a little strong, but it's ok. I'd probably make it again sometime, but not for a while. ;)

This recipe was so simple and full of flavor! I was shocked  at how well the flavors came together, and it was a big hit with the boyfriend. This recipe is great for a weeknight when you are strapped for time or just need to throw something together quickly. 

The only thing I changed was the amount of cinnamon that I used. I did a little less than 1/2 teaspoon. I figured if it was lacking flavor I could always add a dash more once it was cooked, but it turned out fine. That is just my preference though, you may love cinnamon and want more! 

The end product doesn't look the prettiest, but don't be fooled. This is delicious!

DH liked it but I don't think I would make this again.  I made it exactly as the recipe called.  The sauce was decent but the chicken itself had little to no taste.   If I try it again, I will grill the chicken first.

very tasty meal. I was really surprised about using pineapple and cranberries together, or even one of them with chicken, but to my amazement it was a really wonderful dish. I didn't change anything about the recipe and I don't believe I ever would. This would probably be good with pork also.Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

I thought this was really delicious. I brined the chicken overnight (like I usually do because the chicken maintains moisture that way). I ended up reserving some of the cranberry/pineapple mixture and I was really happy I did because I felt that when it was cooked it didn't maintain the sweetness as much. Also, I threw a few cheddar cheese curds over the top when I took of the cover and that just put the delicious factor over the edge! I'm always a fan of cheese and fruit!  Thanks for giving me a way to use my left over thanksgiving cranberry sauce!

Very good!  I had this in a 9x9 pan which was too small, took much longer to cook, next time will do in a 9x13.  Was great over rice to soak up some of the sauce.  Very much for people with a bit of a sweet tooth.

Needs cooking longer than 25 minutes.  But generally good.  Might want to thicken the juices to use as a gravy.

This was very good and so simple. I used about 1 pound of boneless/skinless chicken thighs. I used about 2/3 can of cranberry sauce and about 1/2 can of pineapple that I processed quickly. The cooking time was just right. The flavors were great. Served with rice and veggies.

Very tasty sauce but the chicken was still slightly plain.  I had cut the chicken in bite size pieces, so that helped, but somewhat bland.  I added extra spices too:
Allspice
Ground Cloves
Nutmeg and
Ginger.
I called it Christmas Chicken!

Great recipe - simple but turns out like you spent hours on it.  It was a big hit.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. My husband really enjoyed it. I sprinkled cinnamon directly on the chicken and then again over the pineapple. I served it over rice. Yummy! I will make this again.
