I've made this a couple of times and think it's an excellent topping for meatloaf and probably other meats as well. It's a little more tangy than my husband likes so next time I'll cut back on the lemon juice. Potatoes noodles or rice would be a good side to cut some the the tangy taste. I doubled the recipe so there would be plenty of sauce.

Used this to top AR's Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meatloaf and we loved it. I've always liked chili sauce as an ingredient for a meatloaf topping and the tartness of the lemon juice is balanced out really well by the sweetness of the brown sugar. Very nice and VERY easy to mix up.

I am not big on spicy so I cut the amount of chili sauce down to about half and it turned out absolutely delicious!
