I made this pasta salad as written and it was just ok. The only change I made was used regular black olives because kalamata are expensive. I ended up added a can of chopped artichokes, pepperoni, red onion, a few sun dried tomatoes and regular tomatoes. So essentially I changed the recipe. But the basis of this is good, just not great. I also added cayenne and  garlic powder.

I made this two days in a row, first as written (plus a little dash of olive oil to keep it moist), and today with a couple of changes. Today I used Feta instead of Provolone, and I also added some diced English cucumber. Delicious! Next time I make it (which will probably be tomorrow), I'll add some red onion. Thanks!

I used zesty Italian dressing and two pinches of crushed red pepper. Turned out great.

We LOVE pasta salad and this one is no exception! I did use green pepper in place of red b/c that's all I had, used more grated parm and eyeballed the dressing, but I'm sure I used more than 1 cup. Great combo of flavors...keeper~YUM! thanks for sharing. :)
