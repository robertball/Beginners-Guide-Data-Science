Delicious!!!  Even my picky 9 year old Daughter said she loved them!!!  Used 5 slices of pre cooked turkey bacon instead of 4 slices of thick cut regular bacon.  And to replace the bacon grease to cook the veggies, I used coconut oil spray and a few hard shakes of Smoked Paprika to help impart the bacon flavor.  Used 1% milk instead of heavy cream.  We estimate that these switches made these yummy egg muffins closer to about 100 calories each!

Since I lacked some ingredients I went with what I had, eggs, milk, bacon, cheddar. Still though, you can use anything and they came out splendidly! Delish!

Was cleaning out my refrigerator for hurricane Matthew, and I added more cream and ricotta cheese, and extra spinach and mushrooms, so they don't have to be thrown out. Plan to warm them on a cast iron pan on a fire later when power goes. These were great!

I cooked the bacon first before cutting it. I garnished it with fresh basil and it added to the flavor.

Absolutely scrumptious & great to grab on the go or to pack in your lunch! I utilize various veggies I've got in my fridge; and love adding sautéed asparagus, mushrooms, red pepper & Maui sweet onions to them. I also add shredded Parmesan cheese to the top! Highly recommend & super easy to make!

I changed the cream to sour cream, used about 1/3 lb of sausage and baked 15 minutes. Perfect!!
I also dropped my temp to 325. Served with salsa and sour cream for a little taste variation.

Excellent recipe. Easy as can be. I needed to change a couple of things for dietary requirements.  I used 90g of shredded goat cheese instead of dairy (lactose intolerant) and back bacon (heart safe) instead of regular thick bacon. Made 12 and they were a hit wish I had made more.  Will make these again. Thinking my teen will actually eat this for a quick grab breakfast too.

Yes I will make it again. Had it today as a matter of fact. Neat thing is they freeze well and then just pop a couple out of the freezer and go for it.

OMG if could I would give this 10 stars. I followed recipe  but didn't have the same ingredients. I used ham ,yellow pepper, and I used the    whole box of spinach, and cheddar cheese. I did have to bake them longer ,about 10 minutes longer. Please give them a try. Chris C

I fixed this strictly according to the recipe and it's delicious!  I have them packaged for my breakfasts during the work week.  I used silicone muffin 'tins' without oil, but I think next time I'll wipe them with coconut oil to make the egg cups easier to remove. :-)

These are a great breakfast for when you are running out the door and have no time to eat.  I use real spinach instead of the frozen, eliminated the red pepper and added tomatoes, diced ham, increased the amount of bacon.   I think you can put basically anything you like in these, they cook up well (just don't use the paper liners in the muffin tin) and they freeze great.

Very flavorful, like a mini quiche. I didn’t have any spinach (besides my husband wouldn’t eat it with spinach!) I added a little extra cheese but the recipe amount is perfect.

I used red pepper instead of green and a blend of cheeses. Other than that, this is wonderful recipe.  Great way to get protein and easy to freeze and pop in microwave.  I have made this several times and it works right every time.

A great keto breakfast option.  I omitted the mushrooms due to an allergy.  I used fresh sauteed spinach because that was what I had. The cups were nice and moist with plenty of flavor.  They slid out of the silicone muffin cups perfectly. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made these for a breakfast between services when our choir sang at 8:00 & 10:00 on Easter Sunday. They were a big hit and everyone asked for the recipe. I had bulk pork sausage on hand so I browned it to use in place of the bacon. It was delicious.

I made these and used some ham I had instead of the bacon, I did cook ham in some reserved bacon grease. It was amazing and was a big hit with my husband. I will be making these again. 
They also taste as good reheated!

Excellent and easy to make. Stores well frozen for a couple days (it didn't last long). There is also room to season to taste. I'd say great for low carb diet or just because it sounds good and is.

These egg cups were great and I will definitely make them again.  I shared them with people at work and they liked them too!

We have get-togethers at our 55+ community on Saturday mornings.  They may carry on for the day.  Some of these mornings I just get the thought to have something besides donuts.  This Saturday morning I made the egg cups adding an extra ingredient, sausage.  The residents that attended and decided to try their treat , went absolutely wild.  They called them muffin quiche and kept praising their treat.  I was more delighted than they were.  They liked the idea they were low carb.  I would make again if the vote was to have them again.

Wow, these really are delicious! I used what I had to follow as close as possible. I substituted fresh spinach, egg beaters, no milk and shredded Mozarella along with the other ingredients as listed. This brought the calories down substantially but were still amazing. Quick, easy and really convenient to have done ahead. Surprisingly filling as well.

I made it with green and red bell peppers in place of spinach.  Everyone liked them and it was so nice to have on hand with company.

I added 1/2 of a small jalapeño pepper (since I had two peppers I want to use)  and used cheddar cheese  since that is what I had.  It was delicious.   I couldn't find my muffin tins so I put it in an oblong glass cake pan and still cooked it for the 20 minutes.  It all worked.  I will definitely be making this again.  It's great to be able to store it in the refrigerator and get more than one day's meal.

I made these for my daughter, who takes her breakfast to work every day. I had them sitting out to cool before putting them in Sandwich size Ziploc bags. She grabbed one of the cool ones and tasted it and said, these are even good cold! She knows what she’s talking about.

I doubled the recipe and used turkey bacon, fresh spinach and red pepper instead of green and added egg whites to the real eggs. I would eliminate the salt next time because I think the bacon had enough salt in it. Otherwise it was very good!

Very versatile recipe. I didn't have heavy cream, so I used skim milk. Left out the spinach as I didn't have any, but will put it in when I make it again. (Probably will use fresh spinach, as another reviewer did.) Also added red pepper,  along with the green pepper. Didn't use all the bacon grease.   Another reviewer mentioned the two cooking times.  The 40 minute time includes the time it takes to fry the bacon and  vegetables. The actual baking time is about 20 minutes.

These are basically quiche without the crust the only thing I changed was I added fresh spinach to the skillet and wilted it while sauté the onions and mushrooms. These are so delicious I made the night before and refrigerated overnight and then microwaved two of them for 30 seconds and they came out perfect.

instructions should read 20 minutes and not 40 minutes oven time.  this is confusing when it states at bottom of recipe to cook for 20 minutes.  there are 2 different cook times listed.  20 minutes is correct.

I did not use the onions, bell peppers, salt or pepper & didn't cook the bacon before I added it to the other ingredients, just used the food processor to blend it and chop it all in one step. Used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to put it in the muffin cups ( a medium sized muffin pan), and used a 1/2 cup measure cup to put some in my mini bunt pan - I also doubled the recipe to ensure there was enough made to last a week for 2 people, and still they came out so good that I had to savor EVERY bite! I will be making these often.

I made it as written except I didn't have fresh mushrooms and omitted onion because husband doesn't care for them (he objected to the spinach too but..)  It was surprisingly good. Like a portable omelet. Husband approved so I have a new way to get him his spinach! Plus +
Thanks for the recipe.

These are amazing! I didn’t have spinach so I used broccoli, and instead of bacon I used breakfast sausage & a little ham. I don’t like peppers, so I left them out. You could sub whatever veggies or breakfast meat you like in these and they’ll taste great. If you’re a THMer, it’s the perfect “s” breakfast. So easy to make a big batch & pop a couple in the microwave on busy mornings.

Super Yummy!  My only comment is that it is rather salty - though I am salt sensitive. My husband thought it was perfect. I will adjust some of the ingredients to reduce the sodium next time. But there will most definitely be a next time. These are fantastic.

I add a can of Rotel tomatoes with peppers, drain it and toss it in the skillet with other veggies to heat up. Easier than chopping up a bell pepper.  These can be frozen and it they survive quite nicely.  Great grab & go breakfast!

I made this when I hosted my book club.  We meet in the morning so this was a perfect healthy snack for the group..  I am not a morning person so did the prep the day before and just had to assemble and bake in the morning.  I got lots of compliments on the dish, which I served with fresh fruit salad.  I will definitely be making  this in the future, experimenting a bit with veggies and cheeses.  And leftovers  are welcome making a wonderful and no fuss breakfast - did   I mention that I am not a  morning person?

The consistency/texture was weird. Feel like it needed more cream or cooked too long. 15mins probably would've been ideal.

This is a great recipe -- so versatile!  The recipe as listed is just a starting off point -- add or subtract to the likes of your guests and it still turns out great (I used chopped fresh spinach and mushrooms and red bell pepper -- which gave it very nice color.  No bacon or onions and 2% milk rather than cream).  I doubled the recipe thinking I would get 24 cups out of it, but only got 18.  Didn't matter -- still fed a group of 7 adults and 2 children very well!  This one is definitely a keeper!!

Very tasty! My kids (11, 9 & 5) love these!  I'm freezing them as we speak so I'm excited to try them as a grab, heat and go item tomorrow as we head off to a baseball tournament.  

Here are a few tips: I made the mistake of not using muffin tin liners so they stuck a bit. I tripled the recipe but should have poured out half of the bacon grease before adding the veggies.  I'd like to try these with some chorizo in lieu of bacon and add cilantro and diced tomatoes for a Mexican flavor.

Love these!! Instead of bacon I used about half a "roll" of sausage and added some fresh diced tomato.

These turned out perfectly.  I followed the recipe and only added some red chili flakes for a little kick.  This one is a keeper!

These were great! I can't wait to experiment with different ingredients.  I wouldn't normally think to add onion powder and garlic powder but those additions really enhanced the overall flavor! My kids even liked them.

I love this recipe.  Such a delicious high protein and low calorie breakfast.  I make a big batch and freeze them.  Easy to make a good choice with these on hand!

The options are limitless. You can swap out the bacon for ground sausage, prosciutto, chorizo, etc. The cheeses can be substituted as well. This dish is great as is written but variety will help you in the long run.

This is the greatest recipe!  Take it and run!  Changes?  Streamlined: didn't pre-cook the spinach; used pre-cooked bacon, then cooked the onion in the micro for a couple minutes.  Used a can (drained) of chopped green chiles, and all cheddar; they were fantastic!  Thanks so much for the recipe--been looking for a quickie reheat like these, and they are YUMMY. :) (And I used the whole package of thawed spinach.)

These were really good!  I did leave out the spinach since I am not a fan, but this is a great recipe that can tweaked any way you want.

Excellent recipe that you can vary with practically everything! I used the Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles, a bag of steamed broccoli and various cheeses I had left over. Salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika! I even had half and half instead of what the recipe called for and it all turned out lovely. Great breakfast, snack or even lunch!
