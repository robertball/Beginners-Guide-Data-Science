Loved this! I used 1 egg white and 1 yolk as a slight modification. Also used Xylitol as the sugar substitute and added in almond slivers for an extra crunch. Turned out amazing!

I didn't like consistency. I should have used a different sugar substitute. The stevia had a gross after taste that overshadowed the entire dessert.

I omitted the vanilla, and only used 1/2 cup of sweetener (Truvia). Soft consistency and great chocolate flavor! Definitely gonna make this again.

I just couldn’t make myself like these. They’re so dry and bitter. They looked and smelled great but so do candles and I don’t eat those.

I ran out of almond flower so I used coconut flour for the last 1/2 cup. (I misread the ingredients, oops) I did add an extra 1/2 cup of stevia because I thought the batter wasn’t sweet enough. I also added an extra 1/4 teas of salt to brighten up the taste. Baked it in a round pan for 30 min and they came out great! Nice and moist! Even got kid approval!

These are nasty. Just tried to eat one and I can't get the horrible taste out of my mouth.  Very dense and bitter. Can hardly wait to dump them in the trash.

It'll do.  I used Swerve as the sugar substitute.  The consistency was very much brownie-like but as another reviewer said, they'll never be mistaken as the carbed up version of the brownies.

These were OK. I did use powdered stevia instead of granulated and a lot less of it that recipe calls for. I also added some heavy whipping cream for richness.

Nice way to get chocolate while doing Keto.  Texture was 5 stars.  Would never be confused with a carbed-up brownie, but a satisfying substitute.  Thanks!

These came out sooo good and moist! I used monk fruit sugar instead of stevia because I can not stand the after taste of stevia. I also added some chopped up pecans for a crunch. My kids even approved!

Good flavor when making them with Swerve (stevia gives me a bitter aftertaste no matter what I use it in). These brownies have a more cake like consistency, but I still liked them.

I love these brownies. They were light and airy, chocolate taste was really good, I did take the advice of others and used extra Splenda however next time I won't use quite as much, an extra 1/2 C goes a long way. Nuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit would all be great to mix in, or the keto cream cheese frosting on top. Texture is different with the almond flour, still good.

I didn't have any sugar replacement so I used regular white sugar and added a bit of cream based off of another comment I had read. I also added chia seeds for extra binding. Other than that I did follow the recipe; and for a random spur of the moment brownie craving, it hit the spot perfectly!

Used 1/2 cup of Truvia. That was the only difference I made and I thought they turned out very well. Will definitely be making these again!

Followed the recipe to the letter. I thought when I was making it that it seemed like it called for a lot of coconut oil. The brownies looked amazing but they were extremely bitter (which may be due to the stevia) but the coconut taste was overwhelming. In all fairness, it's hard to make keto desserts that taste decent, it will just never like the real thing.

These we're AHHHMAZIMG!!!
I substituted the vanilla for coconut extract which paired nicely with the cocnut oil.
I also topped w/ a sprinkle of sugar free chocolate chips. I am kicking myself for leaving out walnuts/pecans. I will ne making these again.

This was very easy to make and it satisfies your chocolate fix! It was also “husband approved”! We have been doing low carb diet and I needed something for my husband to eat at family get togethers. Turns out others like them too! Even the kids!

I switched the sweetener to Swerve granular sugar as well. Stevia has too much of a bad aftertaste for me. I ate one with my husband after the oven and I had a slight aftertaste. Had one the next day fully cooled and much better texture and flavor.

I only put half the stevia in the brownies so it would not be too sweet. I let them cool then cut them into small squares to make brownie bites. I bagged them up and put them into the fridge. Making them cold made them totally awesome!!!! And I had brownies for breakfast this morning

Made this today. Everyone loved it. I made no modifications. I just made sure all the items were mixed thoroughly. Texture was perfect. Was not dry. Was very moist. 

I used a cheap version of coconut oil (the hard one, but it melted smoothly once I poured the boiling hot water)  I also used the Hersheys cocoa powder.

Did not taste anything like brownies. Followed the recipe to the dot and ended with a bitter creamy texture. 10/10 would not recommend.

Very yummy, but more of a cake consistency. I would probably use a little less Stevia (maybe 3/4 C) as it was quite sweet to me (not sure what the others did who think its bitter) and I’m going to take it out a few minutes earlier just to see if it give it a little more gooey consistency.

I made the dessert exactly to the recipe. It was just so bitter. I thibk the problem was that i used Stevia. I will try it with Swerve next time and see what happens.

Turned out great.  It took 35 minutes.  I used Splenda and added walnuts to it. The texture is different but a good trade off to get low carb. It was very easy to make.

Texture is more of a cake texture rather than brownie. I subbed 1/3 cup protein powder for some flour and tried PB2 for some of the cocoa. Topped with a bit of bittersweet choco chips. I also added 2 tblsp peanut butter and used splenda instead of stevia to avoid bitterness. End result wasn’t super sweet, but ok. I would use more splenda next time.

I didn't have any coconut oil, so I substituted in olive oil. It came out nice and moist on the inside. I would definitely like to try it with the coconut oil next time.

Really tasty brownies, i added some almonds  to one half and some sugar free chocolate chips to the other half of the brownies. They turned out perfect and the kids loved them too which is always a plus

This was my first attempt at making anything with these ingredients.  They tasted greasy.  Maybe I added too much coconut oil. But, they tasted a bit too chocolatey and gritty. I will try them at least once more.

Too much steviain anything  will give a bitter flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was bitter.  I will try again with 1/2 cup stevia and see how that goes.
