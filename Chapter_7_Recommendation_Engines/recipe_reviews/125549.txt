This is good stuff.  I tend to specialize mine for different occasions.  I will add a little lime cool aid for St. Patrick's day,  some orange juice for Halloween, and so on.  I also like to soak the fruit in the vodka for a couple of hours before mixing.

Used this recipe for my big Dirty 30 Birthday party... it was fantastically delicious!  Made it almost to the recipe-only change was that instead of everclear (Idaho does not sell it! bummer!) I used Bicardi 151.  It did the trick :)

Up here in Washington, we call this Spode. My friend, Jill, and I made this for my thirtieth. It's great because it'll bend easily with whatever alcohol you have on hand. When we made it, we used orange juice and added a 2 liter of Ruby Red Squirt and an envelope of fruit punch Kool-Aid. I think we also added a fifth of raspberry Pucker. Good and potent. I was sucking them down all night.

Made this for a med school party and it was very well received - fed ~50 with the quantities provided in the recipe. Slightly classier than your typical undergrad PJ. Soaked the fruit in the alcohol for several hours prior to the event, and added in the fruit juices when people arrived. Used 6 kiwis instead of 12, 1 bag of green grapes instead of 1 bunch, and added 1/4 of a 2L pineapple soda to make it a little less strong.
