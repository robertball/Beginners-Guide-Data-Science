This is a good quick recipe. The only step I'd modify is cooking the pasta in water first then transferring it to the cheese sauce to cook the rest of the way. It wasn't cooked all the way through.

I added about 1 1/2 C shredded cheddar and also subsituted the water for more milk. I also added about 2 tbsp of butter to add some more flavor. I prefer it my way but it would be good as is.

As is, this is A LOT like Mom's macaroni and cheese growing up. When I make now last minute for my family, I add 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar and a little dijon/Frank's Hot Sauce stirred into the mix, use all milk, and add another 4 oz. of cheese on top. To make it a full meal deal, you can add a 1/2 c. of chopped ham and 8 oz. of frozen broccoli. I also suggest boiling the pasta halfway before adding it to the mix.

Even though I changed the recipe a bit, I was surprised at how delicious this tastes. I made 5 cups of elbow pasta, used 2 cans of soup and grated some medium cheddar cheese into the mix. I boiled the noodles separately and didn't heat the soup at all. I just mixed the condensed soup in a bowl with about 4 cans full of milk. I added salt and pepper then poured my cheese mix into the strained pasta and put it all into a casserole dish. Lastly I added shredded cheddar on top of the whole thing and baked it at 325ÂºF for about an hour. And the outcome was delicious. Everyone loves it! Thanks for the great base recipe.

I didn't think it had much flavor but it was very simple. I just added a lot of salt and pepper!

I expected to get a negative reaction from my kids when I served this - just because it is different from what they are used to.  They thought it was great!  I loved how easy it was, as well as the nice, creamy texture.  I'm going to add a can of cheddar cheese soup to my pantry from now on!

Good, but bland. I added a can of chopped green chiles, half a cup of shredded montery cheddar cheese, and a bit more milk and less water.

I was very disappointed in this recipe, it tasted OK, but not good enough, I couldn't help thinking that it tasted "fake" like it came out of a box .. and I made the big mistake of cooking it for Thanksgiving because I was pressed for time!  Needless to say, none of my guests said it was good, but they kept asking me what kind of cheese I used .. it did not have that home made appearance or flavor which I love.  Learned my lesson.  I will stick to my old recipe and use real cheddar cheese not cheese soup.  Will never make this again.

This delivered exactly as promised--"souper simple".  It was easy to toss together, and the whole family gave it rave reviews.  All I did extra was toss in a sprinkle of garlic salt and some pepper.

I was skeptical but tried it.  Mr C & I thought it tasted ok, but my teens both said it was bland.  It needs some extra spice or additional flavor.  It was a good back up plan for tonight, but I won't be making this often.

My mom always made macaroni & cheese this way.  I like to start with this as my base, but then I throw in any other kind of cheese I have in the fridge, including 1/2 c shredded mozzarella, 1/2 c swiss, 1/4 c parmesan, and any extra cheddar I may have available.  I also top it with italian bread crumbs.
