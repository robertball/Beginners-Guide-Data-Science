Perfect pesto! Don't forget to toast the pine nuts, it makes all the difference...just put them in a small frying pan on the stove and toss them around until they start to turn brown. Don't worry about toasting all sides, just wing it!

VERY GOOD, and easy.  A full flavor Pesto for sure. I added a smidge of coarse salt, and froze it in ice cube trays. After frozen I popped it out (with the help of a fork), and keep the cubes in the freezer. Talk about a FAST side dish.  Pasta, a cube of defrosted Pesto, a diced fresh tomato, and it's a meal!!  Thanks for a GREAT basic recipe!

This is it!  Real, authentic pesto.  I made several batches this morning with our fresh garden basil and my son was in pesto heaven!  If you are making and freezing one-cup batches as I am, then cover the top of each container with a thin layer of olive oil.  Basil tends to turn brown when exposed to air. When you thaw the container, the basil won't turn color.  Use the best Extra Virgin Olive Oil you can afford! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good recipe.  The only suggestion I have is to add some lemon juice to the pesto or store it in the refrigerator with a thin layer of olive oil on the top.  Otherwise, the top of the pesto turns black.

Delicious and beautiful!  If the basil is added to the blender in a couple of separate batches, it helps to avoid "air lock".  I also chucked in a smidgen of salt, which perked up the flavor even more.  Finally, I'm a notorious garlic lover, but even I found that two good sized cloves were enough to perfume the pesto.  Four cloves could easily overwhelm it, so beware.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Exquisite in its simplicity, the only thing I added was a pinch of kosher salt. 
A great recipe.
A hint for keeping the pesto mix creamy~ save some of the cooking water from the pasta. Add it slowly to the drained pasta & pesto paste. Mix well. 
It will make a creamy, hot sauce that will coat the pasta smoothly. Thanks, Valerie.

A little heavy on the garlic and Parmesan, so I reduced the amounts of both by half. Both have very strong flavors of their own, and too much of either will detract from the intensity of flavor you want from the basil.  I toasted the pine nuts in a skillet over medium heat for 5 or 6 minutes, added a pinch of sea salt and freshly ground pepper and did not use the optional parsley--it is neither traditional nor necessary.  The only reason to add this would be to help the pesto retain it's bright green color, since fresh basil has a curious tendency, unlike other herbs, to turn brown when cut.

I love this pesto - I've made it several times.  When I make a large batch, I used a melon baller or spoon to divide the pesto into separate little mounds on a cookie sheet.  I put the cookie sheet in the freezer and when the little balls are frozen, I can easily put them together in a freezer bag and only pull out as many as I need for a meal.

OMG!!  I just finished preparing this recipe... and there is no way I have 2C left!  I tasted it for seasoning and went back for more!  I thought I hated pesto, but I had so much fresh basil ready to expire in the cold that I thought I'd make some and give it away to friends.  No one's getting this stuff but me (OK, and maybe my husband).  Like others, I used less garlic.  Yumm!

Great Recipe -- Changes: I didn't add Parsley & Subsituted Sliced Almonds for Pine Nuts.  I do like Pine Nuts in Pesto, but Almonds are a wonderful LOW $$ sub with absolutely no sacrifice to the flavor.  P.S. I typically add some pepper to taste & sometimes 1/4 Jalapeno from my garden for a lovely spicy pesto. **TO FREEZE:  Pour 1 Cup of Pesto Mix into a Quart Freezer Bag. Close Bag, then Smoosh around the mixture until the bag is evenly covered so it looks like you have a square 'Pesto Pancake' ;0).  Then, when you need Pesto, open bag, break off a chunk and add to your cooking recipe!  MUCH MUCH EASIER & Less MESSY than freezing in cube trays - Trust me!

Who doesn't love pesto?  This is a very good basic recipe.  I used toasted pine nuts, for extra flavor, and omitted the parsley.  I also added pepper.  Freshly grated parmesan is SO MUCH BETTER than the dry canned stuff.  I made several batches of this, when the basil was in season, and froze several portions to use later (in pasta, on fish or chicken, on pizza, etc.)  Thanks for sharing this GOOD recipe!

I did not add the optional parsley. The recipe was surprisingly fast and my kids loved it, wow! I recommend making it a couple of hours ahead of time and let it sit room temp.  Helps with the raw taste.  Also taste great with a little fresh tomatoe and feta cheese, mabey on a pizza.

I've been making pesto for over 30 years, and you can freeze it in little cubes -- but I never do. I make lots each summer (5 to 10 pounds of basil) and keep it in large jars in my refrigerator. 

After making the pesto and pouring it into the jars, all you do is make sure there are no air bubbles in the pesto, smooth it off at the top and seal it with olive oil before closing the lid. When you scoop some out of the jar, just smooth it off again and pour more olive oil on the top, then close the lid.

I've kept jars of pesto in my refrigerator for as long as three years and it gets better as it ages. During the time I've been making pesto, I've only lost two jars (air bubbles). 

Freezing is OK, but the flavor won't really develop like it does when it's refrigerated.  P.S. Don't bother chopping the parsley - it will get cut up in the food processor with everything else.

Perfect! Didn't change any of the measurements. Did not use the parsley and lightly toasted the pine nuts ... I have been trying to make pesto now for some time and it either had too much of something or not enough of something else. This is now my go-to recipe. Don't forget when storing to put a layer of olive oil on the top to help it from turning brown if you want to keep that brilliant green color. Magnifico!
UPDATE: I have made this again without toasting the pine nuts and in my opinion there is no need to toast. It taste great either way!

This is awesome!  And sooo easy!  I added it to penne pasta with chicken, garlic and artichoke sausage and it was delicious!  I took the previous recommendation and let it sit at room temp to blend and it really did cut down on the sharp "raw" flavor.  Glad there is extra for dinner tonight!

Very good recipe.  I have made it twice now.  It definately needs some lemon juice for flavor, I use the juice of 1 large lemon.  I was able to cut down on the olive oil as well.  I have tried it both with and without parsley, and definately prefer it without.  It is good with parsley, but doesn't taste like a true pesto sauce.  Would give 5 stars if not for that.  Definately worth trying without it though.

I had too much basil in my little "basil garden" and every other day i get about handful of basil (had to trim it every other day to let the little leaves at the bottom get sunlight).  I've made spagetti sauce with basil and I love it...but I was running out of ideas and with 2 well packed zip lock sandwich bags filled with basil.  So viola! I made pesto.  If you're a pesto/basil lover you'd definitely love this recipe! Put it over some french bread and some cheese and pop it in the oven. Yummy!

I'm not much into pesto but I made this recipe because my wife loves pesto. It turned out very good. I halved the recipe and was enough for 8 ounces of linguini plus a pair of cooked chicken breasts cut up into cubes. The pesto was smooth and not runny at all. Will probably become a staple for us.

Awesome!  I roasted a whole head of garlic and used it.  I added a squeeze of lemon juice and then froze the leftovers in ice cube trays for my sons.  They can take a cube out and use it anytime they want pesto pasta.  Easy!

Disliked pesto all my life until recently so I don't have a lot of experience to compare this to. I did add some salt and pepper, omitted the parsley and roasted the pine nuts. We adore garlic at our house so I increased the amount. Very easy to make!

This recipe is great! I use only high quality Parmiggiano Reggiano (expensive, but oh so worth it!) I boil farfalle or penne, drain the pasta, put the pesto in the emptied pan and heat on medium-low, add the pasta back in after a few minutes, and heat/stir it all up to coat the pasta well. Add a litte salt, some fresh mozzarella, maybe some marinated sun-dried tomatoes - YUM!!

Four cloves of garlic was too much for me. It over-powered all the fresh basil and stood out very strong, almost spicy. My cloves weren't even big. I tried adding more basil and olive oil but the garlic still overwhelmed the entire sauce. Next time I would add the garlic last; one clove at a time; and taste test as I go. Still a good recipe and worth playing around with to suit personal tastes. I used it to make Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls and as an element baked inside this dish it worked very well.

Fantastic pesto!  I used cashews since I didn't have pine nuts and 2 cloves of garlic instead of 4. I also added the parsley, and a bit of sea salt.  I tossed the pesto with penne pasta, sun dried tomoatoes, and grilled chicken.  All I can say is YUM!  Thanks Valerie!

Definitely one of the better pestos that I've had.  A little too much garlic (and I love garlic).  Also, it says the recipe yields 2 cups, but really it's 1 cup.

great basic recipe...my only alteration was a little course ground salt and pepper...loverly!  an added plus is that it fit in the minibowl of my food processor...a big enough batch to use some basil but small enough that i had enough of everything in the house...i smeared some on some cod and baked it for dinner then froze the rest...thanks!

Great but a little strong on the garlic--I might use only 2 or 3 cloves next time.  I also used toasted salted almonds in place of the pine nuts since I didn't have any.  I left out the parsley and added a little lemon juice.  Don't try to do this in the blender--it is too thick; use a food processor!  Thanks for the recipe...

Quick easy and healthy... what more could you want in a recipe??? i used a little less cheese than it called for. My picky picky family loved it! we put it on wheat pasta and sprinkled more cheese on top(son loves cheese so he had to see that it was on there)

I made this the other day with fresh basil from the garden.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and walnuts instead of pine nuts.  Very good but very garlicy.  Next time I will use just 2 cloves.  This is very good on french baguette with sliced tomato and fresh mozzarella and cracked pepper with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  A meal in itself with a glass of wine.  Salut!

This is an excellent pesto.  I make it using just enough olive oil (maybe 1/4 cup) so that it will blend in the blender.  This produces a pesto 'paste'.  I scoop it out with a 1/4 cup measure and put it in mounds on a parchment lined cookie sheet.  Put that in the freezer; once frozen, simply pop them off and put all in a freezer zip-lock bag and you can have pesto quickly, whenever you like.  (I don't use the parsley.)  This is great in the sun-dried tomato, pesto, tuna salad recipe on this site.

I used a variety of herbs from my garden.  Thyme, sweet basil, oregano, parsely, with a majority of regular basil.   It turned out wonderful.  I brushed some on sliced baguette bread, topped with chopped tomatoes & then parmesean.  Baked in the oven, it is a nice form of bruschetta.  Easy and delicious.  Thank you.

I agree with naples31402 that the garlic should be reduced by half. I'm a cheese lover so I kept the amount as is. My biggest alteration was adding a single Thai Pepper. Wow!  If you like hot this will work for you. I wouldn't add more than one pepper. You can use a fresh Cayenne Pepper in place of the Thai Pepper which should be slightly less hotter.  BEATLEFAN1964 has an excellent point using a few drops of fresh lemon juice to mitigate the oxidation of the fresh basil. I made fresh linguini pasta for this dish which was a great idea. Just remember to keep about 1/4 cup of the pasta water and mix that with the pesto sauce to help bind it to the pasta. Buon Appetite!

This recipe is so quick and easy!  I loved it!  I skipped the parsley but kept everything else the same. We had loads of basil in our garden and my husband made tons of this (without cheese), then froze in ice cube trays. We now have a bag of ready-made pesto cubes in our freezer and just need to add cheese when we cook with it!

FANTASTIC! I whipped this up in no time, tossed into angel hair pasta, and served it topped with shrimp scampi...just wonderful! I'll be sure to grow lots of fresh basil from now on! The response from the people I served it to (myself included)..."Oh my God, this is good...oh, wow, this is SO good!"

Great recipe!  I really like that it calls for only 1/2 c. of olive oil. I try to watch my fat intake, but have found that low-fat pesto recipes  
are not as tasty.
An easy way to freeze pesto is to line a cookie sheet with wax paper and drop tablespoonsful onto the paper.  Put into the freezer and once the pesto is frozen solid, you can peel it off the paper, put into an airtight container, and put back into the freezer.

I would have given it 5 stars if the nuts had called for toasting.  As is, it's a solid 4, easy, good, healthy, and fresh.  I used extra virgin olive oil and followed the recipe exactly.  Please, toast your pine nuts.  It only takes a couple minutes, but makes a world of difference.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I was looking for something to utilize my bountiful crop of basil this year and made this pesto. I liked it very much as is (with a scant teaspoon of kosher salt). I am freezing what we can't eat immediately and appreciate the tip of adding a thin layer of olive oil.

Delicious!  I subbed almonds for pine nuts, a bit less oil and cheese than called for.  Otherwise followed pretty much as written.  Did throw in a dash of nutmeg for kicks.  Tasty, tasty, tasty!

The great thing about pesto is that you can adjust it to taste; I used about 1 cup of pine nuts, and some extra basil.  I also added the juice of half a lemon.  You really can't beat fresh basil, garlic &  parmesan (oh, and ps: I used Kraft!  shocking but it came out just fine if you don't want to splurge on real parmesan) :)

I followed the recipe but added lemon juice (half a lg) as well as salt. Left out the parsley. Thsi was fabulous over pasta! I also spread some on toasted baquettes & topped w/ diced tomatoes then I took the remainder, pureed some roasted red peppers & added them (I added enough to where the color was more rusty than green) then served it on top of grilled flank steak. Loved them all...thansk for the recipe Valerie!

This recipe was amazing.  Very simple - extremely good.  I added a bit more parmesan, as well as a dash of sea salt and some black pepper.  I added this to gourmet gift baskets at Christmas last year, and friends are now asking me to make it again for them this year!

Ive been using a similar recipe for years. NOTE: One bunch of basil from your local farmers market is about 2 cups...I find that really helpful when purchasing the pine nuts which can be pricey. Very basic and flavorful!

This is very good and easy.  I actually put some in an ice cube tray to freeze and will probably make more to freeze since I have a ton of basil left to use.  I will add salt next time though, it needed a bit.  Someone else had suggested toasting the pine nuts first and that is great idea, it really brings out the flavor.

This is definately a keeper recipe just the way it is.  One time, I went to the store and they were out of the fresh basil so I used a tube of basil and it was good as well.  It freezes well made both ways.

never made pesto before this.  followed others notes - used about half as much garlic, slightly less olive oil, no parsley.  Did toast pine nuts and added about 1/2 t coarse salt.  This is terrific and so simple - will make again and again!

Really great, and super easy & fast recipe. Excellent. I added a touch of water while blending to make it a bit creamier. Otherwise, perfect. Watch it -- it's heavy on the garlic, even for a garlic-lover like me!

AMAZING! This was quick and easy to prepare! I picked the basil and parsley from my container garden, and substituted almonds for the pine nuts and freshly shredded Asiago for the Parmesan  because it's what I had on hand for these ingredients. I'm telling you, this was fantastic! I can't believe how simple it was to throw together! For such a minimal investment of time, the taste was fantastic! Thank you for a wonderful post! I will make this often and freeze what I have left over in ice cube trays or small containers! Once frozen, I'll remove from the container and store in freezer bags.

This is an excellent pesto recipe. I've used it several times. It tastes especially yummy in a sandwich with sourdough baguette, buffalo mozarella, sun dried tomatoes, marinated mushrooms, and grilled bell peppers. Try it out.

Oh, man, this stuff is GOOOOOOOD! I wanted to make my own pesto to cristen my new Cuisinart and so I could control the oil content. It's so hard to get massive amounts of basil where I live. So I could only amass two cups. I added extra garlic, parmesan/romano mix and some lemon juice to taste. Tastes amazing! I eat this stuff by itself - no bread, pita, pasta or anything. It's great on its own. Thanks for sharing, Valerie (my middle name, by the way!)

Excellent, authentic recipe! Leave out the parsley and use Locatelli cheese (a salty pecorino). You'll find when making pesto you must adjust the ingredient amounts depending on the water content of the basil leaves and pine nuts.

This was very good. It was my first attempt to make/eat pesto.  I toasted the pine nuts (as someone else recommended) and omitted the parsley.  Next time, though, I'm going to try a little chicken broth and a little less oil.  It was just a bit too oily for my liking. I tossed it with a lb. of fetuccini and cubed chicken breasts and it there was a bit leftover.  I'm looking forward to making it again.

I made this recipe with basil from my garden.  It took about 5 minutes to prepare, and it tastes like a gourmet meal.  I fried up some chicken strips with a touch of olive oil, added them to some cooked farfalle (pasta), and topped it off with this pesto.  Delicious!

A very good, basic pesto recipe.  I didn't add the parsley but added a quarter cup of chopped pecans into the blender and mixed it in.  I'm freezing this stuff as soon as I make it and my freezer is filling up fast!

Made this for a Father's Day cookout & it was very good. However, the following day...this was to die for! The flavors were awesome. I also toasted the pine nuts & added the juice of half a lemon to keep the beautiful, rich green color. Fantastic!

Great recipe, very easy.  I went a little lighter on the oil and it made more of a paste which I used as a spread on sandwiches.  Very tasty!

This was delicious! I had never made pesto before, so I thought I would give it a try with all the basil I had growing in my garden...The only things I added were 2 tsp of lemon juice and about 2 tsp of kosher salt...Perfectly cheesy, garlicky, basil-ly!! Yummy!!

Love this pesto sauce!  Here's how me and my family love it:  Buy basil cheap at the Farmer's Market ($1/bunch).  1 bunch = 3 cups (as in the recipe).  Buy 2 bunches, and plan to double the recipe (why not?  kitchen already messy!).  Use fresh garlic, not the dried-up kind.  One garlic bulb easy to find at the same market.  Parm cheese?  Fresh slab only (sorry - expensive, but that's the way it goes!).  Olive oil?  EVOO only.  Pine nuts (aka pinons - ouch!  $23/lb. at Whole Foods.)  Close your eyes and buy ~3/4 cup: you'll have extra.  Prob = $10.  Remember: you're doubling the recipe.  Parsley?  Heck, no!  Make one batch at a time; combine at the end.  Use only the leaves of the basil.  Grate the parm cheese right into the Cuisinart.  Toast the pinons to light brown in a skillet - YES!  Put the whole to do into the Cuisinart and blend min. 2 minutes (or else its too chunky).  Set aside.  Do it all again, and then put the first batch back in together and give it another minute or two.  Unbelievably divine.  I was eating it straight out of the cuisinart.  This will make a lot, but we plan to freeze it.  The extra toasted pinons will be SO NICE, sprinkled over the top.  Tonight is pesto tortellini night.  Mmmmm... is it dinnertime yet?

This was really delicious.  I didn't add the parsley because I forgot to.  I did add lemon b/c I like the bright taste it adds and it keeps the basil from turning black.  I also added some sea salt b/c other reviewers stated it needed some salt.  I didn't measure it but didn't add a lot.  I thought the ratio of ingredients in this was perfect - I could taste each element seperately and blended together perfectly.  This will probably be my go-to pesto recipe!  I initially rated this a 5 star recipe then realized that since I added juice of a half of a lemon and salt, that I should give it 4 stars.  Still a keeper and still going to be my go-to pesto recipe!

This is very good. If you don't have pine-nuts, walnuts work, too. Did this in my vita-mix for a smoother finished product, and then froze it in an ice cube tray. Each cube is about 2 Tblsp, which is enough for my husband and I to share when having pesto on pasta.

This recipe makes about enough sauce for 3/4 a pound (3/4 of 1 package)of pasta (toss well).  Don't judge the flavor until you've heated it. (Heat on low). We made it as stated except used about 2 cups/full-handfuls of basil leaves and used only 2 large cloves of garlic. We roasted the pine nuts (watch carefully-- they burn easily). It also definitely needs a few sprinkles of salt. Just add extra oil for a full pound of pasta.  Very pleased with how this came out and simple to make!

This was my first attempt at pesto..  The garlic was OVERwhelming.  Perhaps I bought a bulb of bad garlic.  Make sure to process is for a very long time.  I used some good quality lemon olive oil along with my very good quality olive oil.  I had to make adjustments because it was inedible as it was.  I added the juice of 1 lemon, a pinch of sea salt, a pinch of sugar and more basil.  The next time I make it I will use garlic salt/powder instead of garlic.

I added a little lemon juice (half a lemon, about 1/4 cup) and salted to taste.  Plus, I only used 2 cloves of garlic based on other reviews.  It was excellent.

Awesome!  Perfect!  I even realized I was out of pine nuts after everything was in my food processor and subbed in while salted almonds in place of them.  Still perfect!  Was planning to use up a lot of basil by making this and freezing for futures use, however, this turned out so awesome that I revised dinner plans tonight to find a recipe that called for pesto.  Best I've made yet.

Great recipe!!  I used fresh basil from my garden but standard Parmesan cheese.  I did add sea salt after I tossed it with pasta, it really needed it to bring out all the flavors.  next time I will try toasting the pine nuts as suggested and I may cut back on one clove of garlic, it is really strong.

Excellent! Just the aroma is sinful. Made 2 batches today with my daughter.  We used what I had in house - granulated garlic & Kraft jarred 100% cheese. Can't wait for my basil to rebound so we can make more...

You can't go wrong with this recipe. As others have mentioned, all this recipe needs is salt, to taste.

I do not like Pesto. DH had never had it before and found a recipe on this site that called for it. I had plenty of basil in my garden so I agreed to make this. I used walnuts nstead of pine nuts and only made 1/2 the recipe. I now love Pesto! This is the best stuff! I am planning on making some and putting it up as gifts! Thank you for sharing this one!

After looking at many pesto recipes on this site I decided to try this one. I just made two batches. 2 changes. 1) I toasted the pine nuts. 2) I used 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and 1/4 cup olive oil. This was my first time making pesto but definitely not my last! Very good. Thank you for the recipe.

This was a good basic pesto recipe. However, I think I would add a little salt next time to balance out the sweetness of the basil. Otherwise, it's a good base.

This was awesome!! Perfect mix.... with only one exception..... it needed salt. I think I put about a 1/4 to a 1/2 teaspoon in there. Then it was perfect! I did try a couple other pesto recipes on here (I forget what it was called, but it had toasted almonds in it.... way to nutty for me!), and this one is what pesto is supposed to taste like, slightly nutty, garlicy and perfectly full of basil and parm... Thanks so much!

This is a GREAT pesto recipe!  I have made this one multiple times and I feel that its' simplicity is what makes it truly spectacular.  A couple of tips/tricks - 1. If you are making this in bulk amounts, try to buy basil from an Asian supermarket.  They tend to sell large bunches for about $1.  The basil is a different variety, it's "red" sometimes, but it's still pretty good and gets the job done for a lot cheaper.  Of course, get the real stuff if you can afford it!  2. I always add a little bit of salt, I feel that this truly brings out the flavor - we're talking maybe 1/4 teaspoon.  3.  If you find that your basil is a little bit old, or just don't have the spunk that it should, I think a little bit of lime juice will pep it right up.  Anyways, this recipe rocks and I hope you enjoy your pesto as much as I love mine!

Great pesto! I added an extra clove of garlic and substituted baby spinach for the parsley. It turned out great, I will definatly be making this often.

This is awesome pesto! I didn't really measure anything, I just eyeballed all the ingrediants until it looked right. I used it to spread on rolls for chicken sandwiches, but I'm eager to try this over hot pasta as well.

As written, I did NOT like this particular recipe for pesto.  I personally prefer a basil taste as opposed to an overwhelming garlic taste for pesto. (and I only used 3 cloves instead of 4) If I made this again, it would be with more oil, 1 clove of garlic, and salt.

This was so easy and so good. I love pesto but have never tried to make it. I'm going to take others suggestions and make a big batch and freeze, so it's always on hand. I did not add parsley Thanks The first time i made this i bought basil at the store which can be pricy. The last 2 years i've bought basil plants at home depo beginning of summer and end up with so much i make tons of pesto and freeze, Never knew it was so easy to grow and i live in arizona. It loves the heat more than we do.

Delicious, and even better the second day when the tastes get stronger.  I had it on cheese tortellini, threw in some sundried tomatoes, mozzarella (after tossing to keep it nice and white), and diced smoked ham.  A keeper, for sure.

This is a great basic pesto recipe. The only changes I made were to substitute one cup of spinach for basil and to add salt. Otherwise it's great! This amount will cover about a pound of pasta with a little leftover. Enjoy!

This was excellent!  It was a snap to make and it was delicious!  I made it over tri-color tortellini and added some diced cherry tomatoes and it was great.  Definately a great quick summer dinner.

I threw this together in 5 minutes and the taste was remarkable!  A definite keeper and one I plan to use again soon.  I used it for the Chicken Pesto a la Lisa recipe I found at this site.  Both are wonderful!  I plan to make this for my folks on Father's Day.  I am sure they'll love it.

Delicious! If pine nuts aren't readily available, walnuts, pecans or even almonds are great substitutes. Doesn't hurt to add a bit of lemon juice and a pinch of salt, too.  We always plant basil so we can have a plentiful supply for pesto.  We have successfully been able to preserve it by pressing plastic wrap on the surface of the pesto in a glass storage jar, then sealing with a plastic top and keeping in the refrigerator, or by spraying ice cube trays with olive oil, filling with pesto and freezing.  Once solidly frozen, pop out and store in a freezer bag in the freezer, taking out only as many 'pesto cubes' as we need for our recipes.

This is the pesto I've been looking for. I used three plump cloves of garlic, and had closer to 1/2 cup of cheese on hand, and . First taste out of the mixer and I was hit by spicy garlic, but then the subtle magic happens. I can't wait to taste it after it has marinated with itself for a bit.

Delicious! I used slivered almonds instead (toasted in a hot dry pan stirring constantly till lightly browned) and also added a bit of  salt. Used 3 tablespoons in our pasta, then froze the rest in an ice cube tray. Once frozen, transferred them out of the ice cube tray and into a zippered freezer bag for future use.

I just made a new batch with watercress, it has a nice peppery kick.
Pine nuts can be very expensive, I substitute with pistachio's, works perfectly. i freeze it in small plastic baggies.

Yep, that is the flavor of pesto that I know and love.  Put it on macaroni and steamed veggies, and it was great.  Took it over to friends' home and served it.  They said, "Elegant."

This is my go-to pesto recipe! I skip the parsley and add a Tablespoon of lemon to preserve the green color! I love it made with pine nuts but to cut cost & calories, I sometimes sub in the same amount of walnuts. There's not a big difference in taste. Love, Love, Love! It keeps well in the fridge and this year, I'm trying putting it in small jars in the freezer so I can have it on hand.

My sister and I made this recipe in LARGE quantities to use the remaining basil from her garden right before an autumn "frost" was forecast. 
The house smelled heavenly and the pasta tasted exactly the same.  We 'froze' the pesto in zipper freezer bags so that they would lay flat and store well for the winter, if they last.  Super, delicious recipe.  We chose not to use any nuts at all.

Tastes great but I have to say that preparing the basil from my own garden was REALLY labor intensive. It took over an hour to wash and stem enough basil for this recipe. Once that was done, it was a cakewalk. Now if I could just get someone to clean all the rest of my basil I could make about 5 more batches with the basil I have available.

I have been looking for a really good pesto recipe to use up all of the wonderful fresh basil I have been growing this summer.  After reading all of the great reviews I knew this was the one to try.  I won't be looking any further, this is it!  I listened to another reviewer and only put 2 cloves of garlic in and also left out the parsley.  I served it on whole wheat pasta, sauteed red bell pepper strips, and shrimp sautéed in T. butter, some paprika and cayenne with a little lemon juice.  I also sprinkled some toasted pine nuts on top.  Delicious!  My husband raved.  I loved the idea of freezing the rest in an ice cube tray for future use.

Delicious! I've made pesto before, but I didn't have any pine nuts this time.  I had walnuts and pecans in my freezer so I toasted them and put them in my Vita Mixer with the other ingredients and it turned out as good as if I used the pine nuts.  I did add a little salt as well as other reviewers suggested.  I spread some on my pizza tonight and heaven in every bite.

I use up the basil out of the garden and make 3 or 4 batches.  I freeze it in ice cube trays, then pop them into a freezer bag.  Usually 2 ice cubes is the perfect amount for a pasta dinner for 2!

Love the pesto!  Great way to finish the herb garden and put pesto in the freezer to enjoy all winter.  I froze in mini ice cube trays, then popped into a zippy bag.

I harvested my basil bush and parsley yesterday and made 3 batches of this pesto.  I froze most of it in ice cube trays but saved enough to mix with penne pasta and spread on pizza dough for dinner today.  It was delicious. I only have a small food processor so I tried to use my blender and it wouldn't mix properly.  Once it was broken down, I had to scrape it into the food processor. Doing this 3X was a little time consuming, but worth it. Next year I am planting a couple more plants and maybe investing in a larger food processor.

I made this with a little less cheese and garlic (only 2 cloves).  Since I had lots of thyme and oregano in my garden, I also added a few tsp of these as well.  I skipped the parsley.

My blender was totally useless in trying to make it.  No matter how many times I stirred it, shook it, etc, I couldn't get it to blend right, so I turned to my old fashioned tool:  a mortise and pestle.    Nothing mashes nuts, garlic, etc better.  Get a 2 cup granite one.  It will be the best $20 you have ever spent!

I made this pesto tonight with my homegrown basil.  I did use less Parmesan (1/2 cup) because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a pinch of salt.  I toasted some walnuts because I did not have pine nuts on hand.   I am looking forward to making this all summer and putting it in the freezer for the winter.  Excellent flavor!  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe. I never enjoyed pesto so much. I followed it and made modifications that were suggested by other members.  I only used 1/2 cup parmesan cheese that I had cubed, and left the parsley out.  I used only 2 cloves of garlic.  I added salt and pepper and a bit of the hot pasta water to each dish of pasta. Great comfort food!

If you have a choice between a blender and food processor, go with the food processor.  I made half the recipe, and the blender struggled to get this smooth.  Next time, it's the FP for me.  I did toast the pine nuts but didn't add the chopped parsley.  Very nice pesto.

One of my favs....make it often. Pine nuts are expensive. I buy the Basil trees in the supermarket. Less expensive. Watch out you don't put too much cheese. Great spread on bread! MMMMMMmmm

Perfect pungent and fresh. Since making it the first time I now use twice as much olive oil and more cheese also for my tastes.

If you have a vegetable juicer this recipe is SUPER quick. (Just mix pulp and juice) Or just get a blender that doesn't suck.

Perhaps I shouldn't be reviewing this because I didn't actually make pesto - I was having a hard time finding fresh basil so I took this recipe one step further and used only parsley. It made an excellent "mock pesto" that tasted different but similar enough that I could use it in the pesto rolls I was making. I toasted the pine nuts for an extra kick. So simple, and so good.

This is a great recipe - it's simple, quick, and delicious. 
I didn't have pine nuts so I used roasted almonds instead and it was wonderful.
I love to find recipes like this that are realistic for the common cook.
Thank you for sharing this one.

The flavor was good but mine was nothing like my favorite store bought version. Mine turned out thick and gloppy. I had hoped I could grow my own basil and make this a regular at our house since my kids love it with pizza but the work isn't worth it to me.

I LOVE garlic and my first taste of this was that the garlic was too strong. when it is added to hot pasta and is heated up some its not as bad but still the garlic is strong.  other than that it is a good recipe. you could even cut back a little on the cheese and not miss it (and i love cheese too)

A great traditional recipe. Nothing like fresh pesto to brighten up the summer.

This is my new favorite pesto recipe! As others have suggested, I add about 1/2 t. salt. Instead of parsley for color, I just add about 1 T fresh lime juice. For a creamier sauce, add 1/2 cup heavy cream and whisk over low heat. Toss with pasta and veggies or chicken. Yum!

I used this recipe because I wanted to utilize my parsley out of the garden and the other recipes only had basil. I substituted walnuts for the pine nuts. Turned out wonderful. I'd definetely recommend this recipe!

Another summer, another abundant crop of basil in my garden and this is my new favorite pesto recipe. I didn't use 4 cloves of garlic, but I usually adjust amounts whenever garlic is in the recipe. I used 1 large one as all cloves are not created equal.  I added a healthy pinch of kosher salt, a splash of lemon juice and omitted the optional parsley.  I think the next time I make this I will add the oil in small amounts while blending as mine came out a touch on the oily side this time.  As many others have suggested, don't forget to toast those pine nuts.

I had fresh basil from the farmers market, parmesan from the speciality cheese shop and olive oil from a local artisan. yeah, no, i did not feel this recipe at all. i added extra garlic, still doesn't taste right. maybe i should have used more basic ingredients- perhaps the flavors of the speciality stuff didn't quite add up?

Very thick & rich.  Use good parmesan cheese for the best flavor.  I had to add some water while mixing in blender because it was too thick to mix.  I divided the sauce in few zip lock bags, put them in freezer, and thaw each bag for an individual meal.   The sauce never changed color like others said.

This is an easy and flavorful pesto. I eye balled the olive oil and think I used less than what the recipe said. I also added salt and pepper. Yummy!!!

I use slightly more nuts (1/3 cup), 5 cloves of garlic, and along with the other ingredients the recipe calls for I add the juice from 1/2 lemon. A must is to add salt (I prefer kosher) and a liberal amount of fresh ground pepper.

This is okay, but I added lemon juice and sea salt to give it better flavor. I actually prefer another pesto recipe I have which is basically the same but without the parmesan.

A friend gave me a basil plant, and insisted that I try making fresh pesto. I came here looking for a recipe. This was an AWESOME recipe to start experimenting with! I substituted pecans for the pine nuts (couldn't wait until I got the pine nuts to try the recipe!), and decreased the garlic slightly! I can't wait to make the next batch!!

This is an excellent pesto recipe but it wasn't everything I was hoping for...  adding some chicken broth in place of the oil helps cut down on some of the fat... I ended up revising some of the proportions of some of the ingredients until I could get it to taste 'just right'... But it's the best one I've found on Allrecipes!

Perfect proportions. I left out one star because it left out one important step, blanching the leaves. If you don't, you'll have nasty looking black pesto. Just bring a pot of water to boil, and have an ice bath ready.
Salt the boiling water, then drop the leaves in for 15 seconds. Pull them out and drop in ice bath. Squeeze out and pat dry. Now you can make this delicious pesto that will stay bright green!

Way too much cheese. Had to go back in and use much more basil to fix the flavor. Recommend cutting the cheese by 1/2, as a start.

Soooo good! I reduced the garlic to 3 cloves, and added a pinch of salt. I made it first thing in the morning when I realized how much basil I needed to harvest, and I just may have this for breakfast because it is calling to me.... so delicious.

Definitely add the pinch of salt and toast the pine nuts.  Freeze leftovers in ice cube trays for later use.  For a great quick dinner - put some heavy cream in a sauce pan and bring to a boil, add 1 or 2 cubes of the frozen pesto and serve over pasta or chicken.

I made this last night for dinner using some basil that I picked from my moms garden. We really liked it and I would have given it 5 stars, except that a few changes (for us) needed made, so as-is it was a 4 star recipe for me. I followed the amounts exactly, and listened to some other reviewers suggestions. I added the juice of half a lemon, to keep it from browning, I cut the garlic amount in half (and I'm glad I did), left out the parsley, as I wanted this to be authentic and simple, added a pinch of salt, and toasted the pine nuts. I also made the pesto and let it rest while I prepped the other parts of the meal, which I think helped meld the flavors. Make sure to use quality parm and OO, in my opinion it makes all the difference in a good pesto. :) I served the pesto over linguine, with an Italian stuffed chicken breast, and a salad. I will definitely be making this again and might try freezing it since my parents always end up with an abundance of basil from their garden. Thanks for a great recipe.

I subbed walnuts for pine nuts. I also added some kosher salt and red pepper flakes. I, too, freeze it in ice cube trays to pop in pasta dishes later!

This was really really good. I mean lick the bowl clean good.  I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because I had them on hand. I also used Romano cheese instead of Parmesean. It turned out great!

This is awesome!  I went with someone else's suggestion of putting them into ice cube trays and freezing for future use.  This works perfectly and then I transferred into a container.  If I need a quick meal, it's there and ready and perfect for entertaining too!  Thank you for this extremely easy and quick recipe

First time making my own pesto but it was very good. I used a little less garlic, and omitted the pine nuts as we have an allergy problem here, but those are just personal choices.

I made this recipe exactly as it said without the parsley and it came out great.  I used it on a pizza with olives, sun dried tomaotos and roasted red bell peppers, and my husband said it was the best pizza he ever had.  The next time I will make it with the pine nuts roasted to give it an even better flavor.

Fresh basil from the garden used to make this yummy pesto. I did add juice from 1/2 lemon and toasted the pine nuts. Plus I made a taste test of the toasted garlic vs the plain garlic. There want a huge difference though the toasted was smoother and the regular was a bit more sharp or spicy. Both tasted great.

Didn't have any parsley, and only used 1/2 cup parmesan, but my oh my!  This is good stuff!  I used 2/3 sweet basil, and 1/3 Genovese basil, then put that on pasta.  Ummmmm!  Then I made a recipe with 1/3 sweet basil, 1/3 Genovese basil, and 1/3 Thai basil - this is so excellent on homemade bread!  Oh, oh, oh! We are all full!

Just made about a double portion of this one. Good recipe to start with, but needed to adjust considerably to my taste. I added a *lot* more garlic than listed (about 10x what was called for) and also added about a tsp of salt and used toasted walnuts instead of pine nuts (only because that is what I had). Lastly, I squeezed one small lemon into the batch which adds a nice flavor and should help to preserve it a little bit. Mixed about 2 cups into 2 batches of pasta and it is excellent. Sprinkled cheese and salt on top and it is tasty.

I've been doing this for years!! Soooo easy and you can revise it to accommodate any combination of spices you enjoy . I then freeze the paste or mixture in sandwich size plastic containers. After a day or so, remove from freezer, pop it out( usually very easily) but if stubborn , run a little hot water over bottom. Then place in frizzer bag, remove as much air as possible, label for your own reference and when your ready to use , remove, break off a chunk toss right into your dish or defrost in micro on low for. A nice bread spread or pesto for pasta!!  Enjoy!!!!

The 4 cloves of garlic would be way too much.  I put 2 and it was still plenty garlicky.  Did not put parsley (didn't have it on hand).

I have issues with tree nuts so I substituted with sunflower seeds (presoaked). I like the taste even better with the sunflower substitute for the pine nuts.

To make a great pesto you need to toast the pine nuts.  Since the instructions never mention that I only rated this a 3.  Toast the pine nuts and you have a real winner!

I've been making a version of this for years and I've never toasted the nuts ( and I've used walnuts, almonds and pine nuts ). So I toasted pine nuts and I can't say I noticed any difference. I usually grab a handful of other herbs to go in it.  Sometimes oregano, parsley, even sage and marjoram. Whatever is planted next to the basil. It needs just a pinch of kosher salt and a little black or red pepper to be perfect. For new cooks out there, this old Italian granny swears that the best way to use pesto is to boil pasta, drain it saving some of that creamy pasta water to mix with the pesto and combine the pasta, pesto/water, sun dried tomatoes and fresh from the garden sweet cherry tomatoes that have been roasted. This is Sunday dinner in heaven!

Love this recipe! I increased the olive oil just a bit and used Taiwanese Basil instead of regular basil for my second try, since it was easier to find and cheaper at the Asian market. It came out SO great. The Taiwanese (or Thai basil or Asian basil) basil is sweeter, less bitter, and just all around phenomenal.

Both ways are great, but I will be using the Taiwanese basil going forward.

Oh, and don't forget to roast the pine nuts if you use them. Though personally I'll be switching to almonds for price.

Delicious!  I had a lot of basil.. so I experimented with the recipe based on reviews and also what I had on hand.  Loved the recipe as written but needed a bit of kosher salt. Flavor improved w/ toasted nuts. Didn't love it as much when I used only 2 garlic cloves, as suggested by another reviewer.  Tasted changed but loved it equally when I ran out of pinenuts and subbed almonds.  Tip: store pesto w/ a thin layer of olive oil on top to prevent discoloration.  Ditto when freezing in ice cube tray.

I would next time add a touch of lemon as a user suggested to cut down on the olive oil taste. But this is fabulous and my husband loved it! My first time making pesto. Was thrilled! Used a food processor for the whole thing. A+ tossed with tortellini! yay!

This is a great pesto recipe! My only suggestion would be to make the pesto at least 24 hours in advance of using it so that the flavours can blend and mellow. It definitely tastes better the next day!

I give this five stars because it is a great base and allows for personal changes. I used only three garlic cloves, I love garlic but 3 is more than enough. I also toasted the pine nuts in olive oil for a bit.  Last I added a bunch of spinach to the blender at the end.  Felt the basil was a bit on the overpowering side, the spinach toned it down and added another veggie :)

I have a bumper crop of basil this year, so I decided to try making pesto for the first time.  My husband is a chef and rated this as a high end restaurant quality recipe.  I toasted the pine nuts and did not add the parsley.  Other than that I stuck to the recipe exactly.  We enjoyed it on pasta for dinner and then froze the rest in an ice cube tray.

Simple, traditional, perfect!  This is the way real pesto ought to taste.  I did add lemon juice to prevent discoloration and I added a bit of sea salt for extra flavor.   I tripled this recipe and froze it in muffin tins then later put them in ziploc bags.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good basic pesto.  The suggestion from  Beatlefan 1964 to add a little lemon juice was a good idea.  It, along with a couple grinds of kosher salt, gave it a fresh wake-up boost. And yes, I toasted the pine nuts!

This recipe using 3 cups of basil yields a cup of pesto. I also toasted the pine nuts in a skillet for 5 mins. While the pine nuts were toasting I cut about 8 stems of basil from my herb garden and placed the leaves in a bowl with the parsley, then drizzled the leaves with a tsp. of lemon juice and then snipped the leaves in the bowl with scissors. My blender was able to handle the chopped basil leaves easily. A pinch of salt and presto! I have the yummiest basil sitting in my fridge.

GREAT!  This was my first attempt ever at making pesto and I love the way it tastes.  Thankfully I had enough basil to make two batches.

Next time though, I will definitely remember to toast the pine nuts as other mentioned, and make sure my chunk of parmesan is fresh, or buy it grated.  I used the dry crumbled parmesan in my recipe, but it's still really tasty, and very garlicky.  I might mention that I DID NOT use parsley.

Now, if my basil plants will just grow faster so I can make the next batch!

Shh... don't tell.  I threw in a little arugula and kale since I only had 2 cups of basil.  
I liked it fine and it adds nutrition. Pine nuts were toasted as other reviewers suggested and 1/2 sm lemon's juice to brighten it up and add a bit of acidity. Thanks.

Loved the amount of garlic.  I always cut the olive oil a bit by adding 1/2 chicken stock and then the other 1/2 with EVOO.  Another change I always make in recipes is substitute already shelled sunflower seeds for the pine nuts.  It tastes great and only about 1/4 of the price.

I just made this Fo dinner with fresh basil and parsley from my garden! It was fabulous!! I used all 4 cloves of garlic and I thought it was perfect! I used about a 1/4 cup for my pasta and froze the rest in an ice cube tray with olive oil on top!! Sooo excited to have tried this! My husband hates pesto and thought it was delicious!

I followed this recipe closely and found the result very flat.  The proportions are right, but it needed lemon juice and salt, and I think it is better with toasted pine nuts.

Perfect! I made this last night and it was Delicious. Everyone wanted to know how I made it. The only alteration was I toasted my pine nuts just a bit in the over for a toasted hint in the pesto. Great and Simple recipe.

Just finished making this and it turned out great. I did make some changes. I spritzed the pine nuts with olive oil. Then i lightly salted them prior to roasting them.  I used extra garlic and threw in a handful of kalamata olives. Roasting the pine nuts and the kalamata olives made this recipe!!!

Perfect as is and SO simple.  Made with exact ingredients/amounts specified without the optional parsley and it was fantastic (I did toast the pine nuts as others suggested).  I had no problem with mine turning brown/black and I stored in the fridge for a week and then froze the rest without adding extra oil like others have said.  It stayed a perfect bright green.  Can't wait to make again!

Served with buttered Gnocchi I. I did make as is with the optional fresh parsley (had extra to use up) even though the parsley didn't make much of a difference. I would have to say it wasn't the best pesto I've had but it was still edible and accomplished its job.

I made this exactly as directed in a blender. So simple!  A well-balanced flavor that could use a bit of salt, but other than that, perfect!

Pesto is wonderful! A bit too much garlic, so cut it to 2 cloves. Instead of using a food processor, I mixed the ingredients with a mortar and pestle...really liked the more textured pesto. Great base recipe that can be tweaked to every personal style!

Delicious and easy! I didn't add the parsley because I only had dried. I also toasted the pine nuts really quickly. Made it in my spinach/chicken/pesto lasagna!

this was awesome! Made it two weeks ago and ppl are still talking! I had to cut the recipe in half because that's all my basil plant could manage to give this year, still great! Served with little slices of "artisan" Italian bread as an appetizer to lasagna. Will definitely make again!

Awesome! The only thing I changed was to add some baby bella mushrooms and sprinkled some parmesan on top of the feta. I made my own pesto from the herbs I grow in my herb garden. I will definitely make this again.

This yummy basic pesto recipe was so easy to make. I toasted the pine nuts first and also decreased the number of garlic cloves to taste. If you do add the optional parsley, make sure it is Italian parsley and not the curly leaf kind. Pesto is so versatile - it can be used in traditional pasta dishes, fish, chicken, sandwiches, salads, on eggs, in pizza. Make extra and freeze some for later use!

Way too much garlic for my taste, but otherwise perfect.  I'll put in half a clove next time in order to let the basil sing.

Absolutely delicious. The pine nut taste was a little strong the first time I made it, so I used slightly less the second time.

Perfect, authentic pesto. This was DELISH!! I think the key to success here is using fresh, high quality ingredients- fresh basil and garlic, and good quality cheese and olive oil. But this is so good I think even using cheap ingredients it would be yummy :) I skipped the parsley, there is really no need for it. Added just a touch of salt.

2 huge bunches of basil and a bunch of garlic were in my CSA share this week, so I used them to make this delicious pesto.  (I didn't have nuts, so I left them out.)  This was my first time making pesto and it ROCKED!  Thank you!

I made this from the herbs from my Aerogarden, and it turned out so delicious!  I added a little salt, and used macadamia nuts instead of pine nuts, because its what I had on hand.  Yum!

Oh my. So good. I used half cup of pine nuts instead of 1/4, and yes, please toast them first. Also I think I used about 1 cup of parmesan. I didn't measure the olive oil but drizzled it in while the processor was running until it was the consistency I wanted. Didn't have parsley, but want to try that next time. I think I've found my perfect pesto.

My family and I really liked this pesto.  I had leftover breaded chicken cutlets that I had seasoned with basil and some Italian herbs the night before, so I cut them into strips, made some linguine, and tossed everything together for an easy, delicious dinner.  My only changes to the pesto recipe were to toast the pine nuts (watch them carefully and start on a low to medium heat so they don't burn!) and to add some salt.  I also used a tad less garlic and parsley.  Just taste as you go and adjust proportions accordingly.  I will probably try other recipes for pesto in the future, just because I haven't made many different ones, but this is definitely a good starting point.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The garlic REALLY needs to be cut in half like other reviewers have said.  I love garlic, but this was just unbearable.  Thankfully, I was able to fix it.  With half the garlic (or even just a clove) it's spectacular.  It helps a lot to use a very good cheese, too!

Pesto is one of my favorites! The pignoli nuts really make a difference to me (as opposed to walnuts that some recipes call for).  I toasted the pignoli nuts before adding.  Very good with grilled chicken breast or fresh pasta.

Easy to make and was so tasty.  Great way to use all the basil I'm growing in my garden.  Next time I make the pesto I might use a little less olive oil.  I did not use parsley.  I mixed it with cooked linguine and served with grilled chicken that had marinated in Italian dressing, and also had fresh tomato slices on the side.  Great dinner!

Like a few other reviewers I had an abundance of basil this summer, so wanted to try this pesto recipe. After reading the reviews, I reduced the parmesan to 1/2 cup (and would reduce more the next time), added 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper, reduced the olive oil to 3/8 cup and used 1/4 cup of Italian parsley. The pesto does have a stong garlic flavour, but that's just fine in this house.

This is great pesto. I made some substitution based on what was in my pantry. Walnuts instead of pine. Omitted the parmesan. I mixed this with a can of petite diced tomatoes as a pasta sauce, and my picky husband raved over it.

Wow, I couldn't believe the difference between homemade pesto and the store-bought kind! They are two completely different animals, and this recipe is terrific. I omitted the parsley but added a bit of kosher salt and pepper. Toast the pinenuts dry in a skillet first for even more flavor, and use real parmesan cheese (never the stuff in the green-lidded container). CHRISSME's suggestion for freezing with a bit of olive oil on top was great. This makes a super-quick side dish when added to pasta, with or without a bit of heavy cream.

I toasted some almonds in place of the pine nuts and added lemon juice per the suggestion of IMVINTAGE (whose photo of the recipe is what attracted me to it!)This was quite delicious over Really Creamy Fettuccine Alfredo, from this website, and spread on some garlic toast--double whammy!

I took this pesto into work to share with co-workers.  I've never had more request for recipes.  Everyone was raving about this pesto.  They were shocked when I told them how easy it is.  This recipe makes a pesto consistency perfect for spreads, nice and thick.  For pasta pesto you will want to increase your olive oil.  Pesto is expensive, but if you have a farmers market by your house, you can usually find bulk pesto for super cheap.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!!!

A perfect balance of flavor!  I did have to add a bit more olive oil- a few tablespoons to get a good consistency.

Definitely start off small, then gradually add more ingredients to your tasting. I used 1 tablespoon olive oil and I kept adding a bunch of chicken broth to make it smoother + healthier.

First time making this and it was so easy and    
very good. I made Pesto chicken, in the South Bch Diet book, with melted mozerella cheese. So easy and sooo good. Next time I will not add the parsley.

Really, really good.  Some of my basil had gone bad :( so I had a little less than 3 cups.  Probably 2.5 cups.  I should have cut down on the parm accordingly, but forgot.  So my pesto wasn't as "green" as I would have liked, but still tasted great.  I cut down on the oil by about 2 TBS.  Added an extra clove of garlic (they weren't that big).  My babies (ages 2 & 4) and I just devoured half of this with some pretzel chips (from Trader Joe's).  My daughter said "It's so good, I can't stop eating it!".

I'm HOOKED !!!!

I added Asiago, shallots and toasted my pine nuts before adding.

Now I'll try to add sun-dried tomatoes next !!!

I haven't tried it in a pasta dish yet (it goes too fast). I've been eating it on toasted french bread.

My family did not like this, and they love pesto. I only added 2 cloves garlic and it was still to much. If I atempt this again I will omit the garlic and maybe add garlic powder instead.

Yummy pesto.  Ours had way too much garlic, but maybe our clove was too large. We thought we used about a fourth less than the recipe indicates. Also, we used a lot more oil than indicated, mostly so that it would mix well in my coffee grinder.
(Oh, and we're going to buy a food processor. We just figured out that the nasty smell eminating from the grinder is from food that gets soaked into it. Not a good use for a coffee grinder, I say.)

This pesto had a great taste and wasn't too difficult to make.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added some of the cooking water from the pasta, but I think I may have added too much as the pesto didn't mix well with the pasta.  Also, I didn't know whether heating the pesto would affect its taste or texture so I served it cold, but I think I would have preferred it warm.

I followed the recipe exactly - and found that there was too much olive oil for the amount of basil used.  I added more basil, as well as some fresh baby spinach leaves, until it reached a consistency I liked.  This also resulted in each serving having many fewer calories!

I added a little salt, parsley and additional olive oil because it was just too stiff.  Had no pine nuts so used fennel instead and it worked fine.  A good recipe and well received by non-pesto lovers.

This is always my go-to recipe for pesto.  My family and friends love it .  I use this recipe to make small and large batches.  For my large batches, I freeze it in ice cube trays, then use the "pesto cubes" throughout the winter for however many servings I need.

I use Pecans, less $ and I prefer them vs Pine Nuts. Toast them in a pan and let them cool!
You will want to add some fresh lemon, course salt and fresh pepper. Use freshly grated parmesan for sure...
Go light on the parsley or it will over-power the basil. And yes, freeze in ice cube trays. it's great on everything from eggs to burgers.

A very easy and perfect pesto recipe. I will be growing more basil next season to make sure I have lots. Recipe makes enough to fill a 16 cube ice tray to freeze

Taking a cue from other reviewers, I started with less Parmesan cheese and am glad I did. I used 1/3 cup total. All other ingredients stayed the same as given but I didn’t use parsley. I froze my pesto in ice-cube trays, and this recipe makes a full tray of 12 cubes (1 Tbsp each).

This was a really nice pesto recipe. If you are going to make it, make it in advance as it is even more flavorful the next day. Made exactly as written. Perfect for pasta, vegetables, anything. Save it in cubes in the freezer to pull out any time. This was perfect!

I look forward to freezing some of this to be used later in the year. I used basil that my wife grew and we loved it! So good. I left out the parsley and doubled the pine nuts. I was afraid 1/4 cup would not be enough for as much basil as we had. I'll reduce the pine nuts next time and compare. I used this recipe for the Pesto Pasta recipe on the allrecipes website and it was to die for. There are few recipes that offer this much return for so little effort.

Is delicious but not bragging.  Basic is as good as it gets.  Roasted the pine nuts, heavy on the garlic (for the heart), excellent olive oil and grew the basil my own self.  Don't think I'm sharing except with the hubby!

I added some salt & increased the measurement of the cheese to about a full cup.  Next time I will start with 2 cloves of garlic & go up if needed....the garlic was a bit strong but maybe if I used smaller cloves Still DELICIOUS!  Thank you for sharing this recipe ANDERVAL.

I gave this a 4 as is- a 5 with minor changes. 4 cloves of garlic was just too much for us, so I used 2 cloves. I reduced the Parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup. I toasted the pine nuts per an earlier review and added some fresh squeezed lemon juice to keep the sauce green. It’s so yummy!!! Looking forward to making this all summer!

Very good.  I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because of the cost of pine nuts.  It was still very good.

Most excellent pesto !! I’ve never made it before, this was really good. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is to add a pinch of Turbinado sugar just to make it a little sweeter, will definitely make it many more times !!

Will definitely be making this often.  Only thing I changed was that I used walnuts because I had no pine nuts.  Added some sea salt and pepper, too, and a bit extra olive oil.  Served it over tortellini.  So yummy!

I've made this several times and it was good each time. I like to freeze some for the off season in lined ice cube trays and store them in sandwich bags when frozen. I did not add the parsley but may try that later.

If only I could give it more stars!  

I didn't have three cups of basil on my single plant, but I plucked all I could off it to make a small amount of this pesto.  OMG it was wonderful.  I will make a larger batch as soon as I can, but if you like pesto, please give this recipe a shot.  It was much easier than I ever imagined and well worth the price of pine nuts (although I saw where one reviewer tried almonds..I will give that a try also)
EDIT:  I tried this with almonds and  I really couldn't tell the difference.  Still amazing!

Ahhhmazing! This was our family's first time eating pesto and we made this recipe as written. It was great! We mixed 1/3 of the amount this recipe made into 1 lb of cooked linguine and topped it with sauteed chicken pieces that were marinated in light italian dressing  Some of us added a little garlic salt to our plates for a more pronounced flavor but it was fine without it as well. We froze the remaining amount in two portions topped with a little olive oil as recommended in another review.

It's a solid recipe but lacks savoury taste. Salt and pepper it as needed, and I think a lime would make it taste much better.

This is a staple at my house.  It's hard to find better pesto anywhere.  I play with amounts sometimes and if I don't have parsley I will make it with basil alone or use walnuts instead of pine nuts.  You can't mess it up. 
Be sure to use  good olive oil!

Great easy recipe. I took the advise of another reviewer and toasted the pine nuts and it turned out great. I had so much fresh basil that I ran out of pine nuts and substituted unsalted almonds for the last batch. The pine nuts were better but the almonds make a good substitute.

Great easy recipe! To keep pesto from oxidizing, I blanched the basil. First boil your basil for 15 seconds then but in ice bath to stop the cooking process. I towel dry the basil afterward. It works like a dream!

Excellent use of the now bountiful basil plant plant that was tiny when I purchased it in early summer.  I scaled this down, being not sure if I'd like it and made it in my mini-processor.  I did sub chopped walnuts for the pine nuts with great results. It definitely needed salt, and I added a little pepper and more olive oil. After heating up the pesto, I had it over angel hair pasta. It seemed a little dry by on it's own,  but I took care of that by adding enough of the pasta water to make a nice silky sauce.  So many uses for pesto, and I'll surely be making this again, as long as the plant keeps producing! A very easy recipe with great results --- thanks ANDERVAL!

I did make homemade pesto sauce. It has been little while back. As I recall I think I added a bit of kosher salt. It was delicious. I have also tested to see if using a mortar and pestle for the recipe was better. When using a mortar and pestle it is a lot more time consuming. It produces a fresher more basil forward flavor. In both recipes I highly recommend toasting the pine nuts, being careful not to burn them. Always use a high quality pecorino parmesan cheese, high quality olive oil  and all fresh ingredients. You can also use half of a high-quality Romano cheese and half of the parmesan pecorino cheese.

Difficult to blend with a blender as written.  Suggest blending BEFORE adding the parmesan, which seems to absorb the oil and prevent the fresh basil from dropping to the blade of the blender.

Good result, but not quite as good as pesto I have had before.  Will try again, though.

My first time making fresh basil pesto from scratch.  I used almonds instead of pine nuts because that's what I had in the cupboard and didn't add the optional parsley as I didn't have any on hand.  I was pretty impressed

The only addition I made to this amazing pesto was to add the juice of 1 lemon based on another review. I couldn’t stop eating it was sooo good. Making another batch tomorrow to freeze. Parsley was a nice addition too.

Made multiple batches of this incredible pesto last summer and gave 4 oz ball jars as gifts to friends and coworkers. Starting in May this year, everyone started asking for it again. 
So we made it and gave it as gifts again. One batch made about 4 jars. We had an assembly line going. 

This recipe really is terrific.

I agree with others’ comments:

1) Cut back on the garlic a bit

2) Toasting the pine nuts really adds and extra dimension that you can taste. 

3) Fresh Parmesan is nice, but I've made it with the big green bottle of Kraft parmesan (from Costco) and no one complained. It was delicious,

3) The parsley gives it a bright green color that really lasts. I recommend it. 

4) When you jar it, pound out any air bubbles and float a layer of olive oil on top. Then refrigerate. Whenever you spoon any out, level the top and pour a bit more oil on top. This keeps it  from turning brown. I have 3 jars in my fridge now from an early August batch that are still green in mid-October. 

Make this!

This is absolutely delicious! My first time making pesto and I can’t imagine buying it after how easy it is to make! After reading reviews I added about a tsp of lemon juice and about 1/4tsp Of sea salt and a few dashes if black pepper. It made about 4oz worth. I made two batches and it would pretty well fill a 450g (8)

Pesto tastes great!! I followed the recipe mostly, but added around two pinches of table salt and a little extra olive oil, maybe about 1/8 of a cup. The pesto didn’t taste flavorful when freshly blended, but after a night in the fridge, it was super tastes!! I followed another recommendation to add a thin layer of olive oil on-top of the pesto when you store it, so it doesn’t blacken on top. Will be making this again!

I substitute walnuts, toasted, for the pine nuts as I always have walnuts on hand.  Other than that, I follow the directions exactly, including the parsley.  It is amazing!  I freeze it in cubes and have 'fresh' basil flavor all year.

This is the BEST Pesto recipe I have ever made. I did make one change, I used raw cashews instead of pine nuts. Since I liked the 1st batch so much I went to the store and bought more fresh spinach so I could use my lemon basil that is growing like crazy this year. Delicious!

I made this as directed with the exception of the Parmesan, using my best olive oil and then froze.  I pulled out a few table spoons, let it thaw and added freshly grated Parmesan.  It was my best ever batch for bruschetta.  I'll do it this way for ever more.    DELISH!

Fresh parmesan enhances the taste.  I also add a little lemon juice and a handful of pistachio nuts for taste.

I am terrible when it comes to exact measurements. I dumped all the ingredients listed into my blender and its delicious. I turned around and made polenta lasagna with the pesto sauce and I'm so pleased with the results.

I didn't use the parsley. I toasted the pine nuts.  Personally, I like the garlic and Parmesan. We thought it was a bit dry - ended up increasing the olive oil.  Also ended up adding some kosher salt. Good, quick and easy.

I made this for tonight's dinner. I didn't have any pine nuts, so, as per another site's recipe I substituted with walnuts. I did add a little extra cheese, some onion powder, tiny amount of lime juice, and chile pepper powder. I've never tried pesto before but we do use a lot of basil, garlic, and olive oil, so this sounded good. It tastes good. I serves this over egg noodle pasta and some left over roast chicken, with a side of grilled in the husk corn on the cob. Thanks for the recipes.

This is my "go to" pesto recipe. I've been using it for several years. I don't add the parsley. A good quality cheese seems to make all the difference. I usually have a bumper crop of basil during the summer and make lots of pesto to freeze.

This is an excellent and straightforward pesto. I made this to go on top of homemade pizza and it turned out absolutely wonderful. This is way better than any store-bought pasta sauce that I’ve ever tried. Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!!

It turned out great! I added a couple more cloves and Parmesan, and as others have said, I toasted the pine nuts. It adds a great nuttiness to the sauce. I let it chill overnight to use it the next day.

This was a great way to preserve the fresh basil from the garden. I kept it in a 1 quart canning jar in my fridge, with a thin layer of olive oil on top. It was a handy seasoning to have on hand, and it kept for about 6 months, as long as I made sure the olive oil still covered the sauce when I returned the jar to the fridge. It did develop mold on the jar after 6 months, and I hated wasting the precious pesto sauce! 

I used it to season tomato sauces. On a few occasions, when I didn't have a plan for an elaborate dinner, I simply went to fridge. I added a heaping spoonful of my homemade pesto to some canned tomatoes, along with some salt, pepper, and other spices (such as garlic, dried oregano & basil)... it made a terrific chunky sauce for pasta. 

I love the flavor, but I did find that my kids and husband enjoy it more, when I don't use pesto more than once every week or two. I don't know the psychology behind that, but I am so grateful to have this in my seasoning arsenal. Those little tiny jars of pesto are so expensive in the store! 

Thanks for a great recipe. It prevented waste in my garden, and saved me time and money on trips to the grocery store. Simply awesome. I will be making this every year!

Made as directed- I used one large clove for two smalls, it was a bit too garlicky for hubby- I think it would have mellowed out had I let it rest a bit like some reviewers have said.  Next time I will toast the pine nuts and add a tad of lemon juice but trust me there will be a next time- fresh, delicious!

Added a little salt & pepper . .. and twice as much garlic to ease off the leafy taste.  It was the last basil harvest of the year, so the leaves weren’t as young and green.

Easy recipe, we made pesto pasta with it. We did double the recipe, and for some reason it was spicy. I think it was because of the garlic, but we did the measurements correct. Anyways I am not sure if it was my fault. But we enjoyed it with my family.

I used 4 very big cloves of garlic, and it was very garlicky.   But my family likes garlic, so it wasn't a problem.    The toasted pine nuts really add flavor.   This recipe calls for more pine nuts, more cheese,  and more oil than my other recipe.   Not great for someone who is watching their fat intake.   But it tastes great!

Toast the pine nuts until browned slightly before blending, also, use pure olive oil for the initial 1/2 cup for blending (extra virgin can become bitter from mechanical agitation), then add another 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil at the end and re-blend lightly.

This is one of the best pesto recipes I've made. The results are not too dry, not too wet. Perfect as it!

If you are adventurous, add three more cloves garlic, one small hot pepper, like jalapeno, 1/4 tsp salt, and 3 tsp freshly ground sichuan pepper (has to be fresh ground). Then add the juice of one lime, it enhances the flavor and helps it stay green.

And if you are really adventurous, use Asian basil. It adds a subtle basil/clove/anise like flavor that is hard to describe.

Finally, serve over home made sourdough bread (has to be home made, not store bought fake sourdough), and heap some home made sauerkraut (has to be home made) on top. It will be amazing!

I don't think I know the meaning of "packed". I packed it too much. Still....quite good. And ...."Dilution is the solution to the pollution". DO NOT put the pesto mixture in a silicone ice cube tray. You will NEVER get the smell of garlic out of it. I know....and bleach doesn't work.

Loved it.  Made it per the recipe, without parsley.  Our only change was to include a little lemon olive oil as part of the 1/2 cup.  We grow six different types of basil and used mostly sweet basil, with a little lemon basil and Thai basil thrown in.  Unlike some others, we didn't find it too garlicky (and we used good sized cloves).  We liked the slight flavor of the parmesan. Unlike my wife, who liked it as is, I found adding a little of the pasta water as suggested by another reviewer, made it a little smoother in flavor for me.  We had enough left over for a full meal in the future.

I've made this twice so far, both times using the bounty of fresh basil from my garden.  Neither time did I use the nuts, although it's an option for the future.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and pepper to boost flavors.   I have put this pesto over fresh sliced tomatoes, as well as a platter of mushroom ravioli.  Husband said he loved these recipes and wants me to repeat them.

I followed the instructions exactly, and took the advice of other reviewers and toasted the pine nuts first.  Very tasty!

We've made this pesto several times.  Generally, I only use 1/4 c. of the Olive oil.  We enjoy the pesto on toast with slices of cherry tomatoes and grated Pecorino Romano.

Great taste, made exactly per recipe. Great taste, I had cheese Parmesan mixed with Romano, but it gave even better taste. I used fresh basil from my garden. I freezeed it in a bag after flattening paste, will see how it works out.

I thought this was a great, solid pesto recipe but once I tasted it, I knew it needed something. I added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and it added the zip I wanted. Great recipe!

This is the 2nd year I have made this with Basil from garden.  
Have never really enjoyed Pesto from store but this recipe has
changed my mind about Pesto.   So much better than anything
one buys... I have used almonds toasted & last batch was both
green  & Thai basil using almond & pistachio nuts...took advice
of others & used some kosher salt.  No parsley but will add next time.  Some in ice cube trays freezing for use this winter.

Great authentic recipe. I skimped on the oil a little and it still turned our great. Use cheese that you freshly grated yourself and definitely toast the pine nuts - makes a world of a difference. If you're making multiple batches like me, I found that portioning it out in 1/3 cup servings into small vacuum seal bags for the freezer worked really well.

I'm a seasoned cook, and have made this recipe or one like it many times.   Since I have an automatic ice maker, I don't own any ice cube trays,....so I read through the reviews to get tips on the best way to freeze this. After reading many tips i settled on one reviewer's tip to line a cookie sheet with parchment paper, spoon mounds on it and freeze, then put into baggies.  That's what's happening as I write this.  THEN, when all was said and DONE, I read that you can use muffin tins, which I have several.  NO, I didn't think to do this earlier. My point;  if you don't want to use, or don't have ice cube trays, then use muffin tins, and frankly I think ice cube tray portions are too small anyway.  Just sayin'.  Thanks for this recipe.

I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because I don't like the stigma attached to pine nuts. Plus, walnuts are less expensive.

Quite good with following changes:  1.5 cups spinach leaves packed, 3 cups packed basil, 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 c. olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/3 c. parmesan, 1/4 c. almonds. Makes 1.5 cups pesto...

*Try: Doubling spinach (3 cups instead of 1.5 cups). May need to add more sauce when doing so (oil, salt, cheese, garlic powder, almonds). Or could try the Spinach Basil pesto recipe.
*Can make it without spinach, still good, but better with it.

SOOOOOO good. I too used the slivered almonds. It added a wee bit of pleasant 'sweet' to it. And I've never made a 'sauce' before. THIS WILL BE MADE AGAIN.

Made this recipe exactly as prescribed except used  Sliced  almonds in place of pinenuts and a quarter teaspoon sea salt. Also I did roast the almonds in a dry,   small frying pan over  Medium heat.  it can be stored in the refrigerator in a pint jar with olive oil over the top to keep it from going black .

I needed to add lots more olive oil because it was too thick like another cook said and definitely salt, and more garlic too.  I added a squeeze of lemon juice for retaining color.  I would make it again and just realize I needed to add the salt and more oil.

This recipe is very good.  I made half a recipe for storage and freshness purposes. I did follow the suggestion of many about reducing the garlic and using a pinch of coarse salt. It was perfect in every possible way.  I think is a great idea the suggestion of scooping little balls with a melon scooper to then freeze instead of freezing in ice trays. For those watching portions it is the best idea to keep track of  them. Will make it again!

Followed the recipe as written except that I toasted the pine nuts as suggested by others. Loved the results. Depending on your taste you might want to add a little more garlic next time. Made several more batches to freeze.

Great basic recipe. I didn't add parsley because I didn't have any, but I will try that next time. Definitely toast the pine nuts! They are so $$ that you want every bit of flavor! Also, I added  a bit of salt.

Very good and easy. I might cut back on the garlic next time. It monopolized the flavor.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!! I added a little extra garlic (because we love it) and a pinch of salt at the very end. But YUM! This is a repeat recipe for sure!!!! Two thumbs up for sure. And I did add the parsley at the same time as everything else. It didn't effect the flavor but it will add a health bonus.

The only change I made was adding some salt to taste. This recipe was amazing, I will never buy jarred sauce again. Super simple to make and the ratio was all perfect. I just put in the blender and that was it. I added my cheese last to not over work it so I could maintain a good texture. I served mine on a bed of aldente spaghetti and added some grilled chicken on top. Simply delcious!

I love this recipe, it's simple fast and delicious! I did make a small adjustment to make it vegan friendly/dairy-free. I left out the cheese and instead added a few sun-dried tomato medallions to make it a little more flavourful.  The family loved it and I've made it several times since. Fabulous!

So good. Made it with fresh basil and parsley from the garden. I did add about 30% more garlic and parmesan, and just a little salt and pepper. Put this on a cauliflower steaks recipe and it turned out great.

I didn't think I was really a fan of pesto. However, after making this for a dish from this site (Teena's Spicy Pesto Chicken Pasta), I am in love! This is an easy, and super tasty pesto!! It makes way more than I need for this recipe, so I freeze in  Tablespoon size portions. So, when I'm ready to make a new dish, all I have to do is grab 6 pieces from the freezer and I'm ready to go. No store bought pesto here!

Excellent and easy recipe.  We did have to add a bit of salt & more parmesan to offset the "green" flavor.   Next time I'll try toasting the pine nuts for more depth of flavor.

Extremely simple to make and so much more flavour than the store purchased pesto. Will be making this again very soon given the endless supply of fresh basil.

Great recipe!  Really close to an authentic Genovese pesto (without the parsley...)  The main difference is that it is made with a blender or food processor and not a mortar and pestle as it is traditionally made.  Believe it or not, that makes a difference in taste with he traditional method giving a "brighter" taste.  For those that said it needed salt, you may want to try a better grade of Parmesan.  Parmesiano Reggiono is salty by nature and somewhat negates the need for added salt.  I did cut the garlic in half as well.

Surprisingly, even without garlic (dietary restriction) this is good. Second time around making this recipe, but this time made a batch as written. Toasted the pine nuts first, and think it's delicious either way (toasted or not). Overall, good recipe, but we think it's a bit heavy on the garlic. Next time will reduce the garlic to 2-3 cloves instead of 4. Also, slowly added a little extra oil to the mixture. Recipe is easily modifiable to your own pesto consistency and flavor preference.

I bought 3 lounges of basil from a CSA I belong to and decided to make pesto out of it using this recipe. I scaled it up and didn't run into any problems with the larger batch. Was very easy to make using my Vitamix blender and freezes well. I got some weird looks from the family the first time I served them some sautéed chicken breast with green pasta but everyone enjoyed it and is looking forward to the next time I make it.

We are hosting an Italian exchange student. I made this for him tonight.  He LOVED it! He took a few helpings and told me several times that it was perfect. It was nice to see him so happy. The only change we made was to add 3T of water.

Absolutely amazing! I was lacking in pine nuts, so I substituted with toasted walnuts instead. It came out wonderfully, and I think this will be my new go-to pesto recipe.

08.21.16 ~ My sister in-law always grows a gigantic cast iron pot full of basil. It is like a caldron pot. This year I decided to make my own pesto rather than buying it. I made one batch using the pine nuts as this recipe states and the second batch using walnuts. I did grate my own fresh Parmesan as I wanted a little bigger pieces of cheese. I love the taste of both. I used my 1 TB cookie scoop and flash froze the mounds on a piece of parchment paper. This will come in handy this winter.

Followed this recipe almost exactly. Only things I did differently were toasted the pine nuts and added salt and pepper. It was absolutely delicious. My super picky boyfriend and son loved it as well as my sister and her super picky husband. Will definitely make again!!

Good but I wonder if either I am not a fan of pine nuts OR I didn't toast them enough as one reviewer reminded.  It had a bit of a bitter flavor.

A really good recipe for pesto and l will make again. I substituted for the pine nuts with walnut pieces and it worked fine. Be sure to toast the nuts as it brings out the oils and richens the flavour they hold. I made a second batch and added some fresh parsley as suggested and it was just as good. It may not seem to make a lot when you finish, but a little goes a long way. This full of great flavour.

Really nice basic basil recipe. I added a little salt and some lemon juice the second time I made it which in my opinion helped balance the flavor. I froze it in small jelly jars.

Perfection! i toasted the garlic in the pan along with the pine nuts. I had to add a little water to loosen it up a little in the blender. Having tonight with gnocchi. This should be real good...

4.5 stars.  My first time making pesto.  I had some very overgrown basil to use up and decided to give it a go.  It was pretty good on fettuccine noodles with Italian sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes from our garden.  A very fresh late summer meal.  I did let it sit for about 1 hour as other reviewers stated it helps reduce the "raw" taste.  I didn't know what that meant, but I did it anyway.  It did have a bit of a "leafy" flavor, maybe that's what they meant by "raw"?  I did add kosher salt, pepper, lemon juice and left out the parsley.  I would make this again, but am interested in trying other recipes also.  I think it would be best to use smaller, young basil leaves that would be more tender than the older, larger basil leaves I had which were overgrown on my plants.

This is a very good, basic pesto recipe and I've made it with and without the addition of parsley and both ways are really nice.  I usually use walnuts in place of pine nuts for economy and a little less parmesan only because I am sensitive to dairy.  I freeze this in ice cube trays so that I can have a single serving as I live alone.

Made it exactly per recipe and yes, I will make it again.   It was a little strong(bitter) but I used my end of season basil and some of it had bolted hence the strong taste. Those toasted pine nuts were delicious.  I toasted them in an iron skillet. If they weren't so expensive it would be a great snack.  It was delicious out of the blender. I froze some in an ice cube tray with a thin covering of olive oil   I can't wait to try it on pasta.

A little bit too much olive oil but the bext time I use simply less. And I have not added the parsley - it would change the flavour too much.

I have made this recipe 3 years now. I grow big basil plants in a pot on my deck and make it throughout the summer and put it in small zip lock bags in the freezer so I have lots of fresh pesto all year long.

So simple and easy to make!  Have made it a few times and would not change a thing.  Definitely toasting the pine nuts gives it a more robust flavor.  Highly recommend this yummy recipe!

Easy to follow instructions.  Smells wonderful. I doubled the recipe and froze three of my four containers. Plan to make pesto and shrimp pizza with it tomorrow. Only had enough pine nuts for one of the batches so added almonds to the other.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again.

My Basil is coming in like crazy. Yesterday I made several batches using Mario Batali's recipe for Pesto.  It didn't have enough flavor and too oily.  Today I tried this recipe for several more batches.  It is far superior to Chef Batali's in ease of preparation and ingredients.  I made it exactly as specified. I like the robust garlic and I can taste the pine nuts without toasting first.  Must remember to come here first for Pesto recipes.

Wonderful! Basil did really well in the garden and this made a perfect recipe.  Fantastic as the sauce on a homemade pizza. A dash of salt, and the addition of a generous 1/2 cup of baby spinach leaves were my only tweaks (I had fresh spinach that had seen better days and wanted to use it somehow.)

I've made this several times now, it's so simple and easy.  One time I added watercress, and it was fantastic.  I think I added about the same amount as the parsley, it was just one bunch at the grocery store and I was feeling adventurous.

I made this as is except I toasted the pine nuts and omitted the optional parsley but it ended up super thick (like a paste) and very strong flavored.  To make it more to my liking,  I ended up adding  more olive oil and a couple of squeezes of fresh lemon juice, plus some salt and pepper.  It's much better now!

Good pesto!  Substituted toasted pecans for the pine nuts, and didn't use parsley.  I used a little more basil than the three cups called for since we needed to cut a bit extra to keep the plants growing.  This meant that I needed to increase the olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan a bit.  I also added a dash or two of kosher salt and some lemon juice (both for flavor and to preserve the color).  Before the kosher salt and lemon juice, this recipe just didn't taste complete.  Afterward, though, it was delicious!

I doubled and then toasted the pine  nuts. I also used a blender rather than a food chopper for better result. Did not use the parsley. Great recipe!

8/2/16 This time I forgot to toast the pine nuts.  To the food processor, I added the parmesan last-- much easier to get a good result.  Still delicious. I also added 1/4 cup of parsley. It has a noticeable taste and I'm not sure I like it.

I've never made pesto before.  This recipe was easy and delicious!  I only had 1 c of fresh basil so I reduced the recipe serving size to 6 and it worked out great.  I made it into a pesto  cream sauce by adding 8 oz of warm half-and-half which was the perfect amount of sauce for a 12 oz box of bow tie pasta.  When adding the cream I warmed it, poured 4 oz into the food processor (after I finished the pesto), blended it and then dumped everything into the other 4 oz of warm cream.  Warmed it all until thickened - I just put it in the microwave for 1 min and that was perfect.

This was a great pesto but I made a few adjustments to suit my taste better.

I added 1/2 cup parmesan instead of the full 3/4 cup.  I love cheese, but I could taste the cheese with 1/2 c and it was drying it out.  The other change I made was I added significantly more olive oil because I like pesto a little thinner and runnier. 

Other than that this is a delicious recipe that I'll be saving!  This made probably 1 1/2 c finished pesto and it was enough for my recipe plus I froze ice cubes.  If you're going to freeze add a splash of olive oil to the top to prevent browning.  Thanks!

I used a little more oil, but the rest exactly per the recipe.  It was still a little pasty, in texture, but it had excellent flavor. I used it with Penne Chicken with Pesto, and had a perfect meal.

I thought I had reviewed this awhile back but apparently not!!!
This is the only recipe I use and that's because it is authentic and delicious!! I've grown my own basil for years and after trying a number of variations I settled on only using Genovese basil. The ONLY thing I add is a dash of sea salt and a dash of cayenne just because I like the little kick it provides. 
It's easy to freeze if you want by putting in in a small (3oz.) plastic container and pouring enough EVOO to cover the pesto. Put on a lid and it is good up to a year.

I substituted toasted walnuts and cut the garlic to two cloves. It was still very tasty and sprightly. Also I laid it in a flat dish on top of plastic wrap, folded the wrap over and put all into a freezer bag. The next day I removed the dish and broke off a piece to spread on a piece of cod that I baked in the oven. It was excellent!!

Have tried this a few times with fresh basil from the garden. It turns out perfect and tastes wonderful. Tried adding fresh parsley the first time. I liked it, but my wife preferred nothing but basil. It's a keeper.

I did not make any changes.  I made this recipe, froze in ice cubes, and gave 8 of my friends 3 frozen cubes each at the end of last summer.  They all loved it and have asked that I make the pesto again this year--except they want more than 3 cubes each!   I also love the pesto and made a delicious appetizer using grape tomatoes and a mozzarella cheese ball drizzled with this pesto. I used a toothpick  to hold each appetizer together.

Awesome recipe! I added a 1/2 cup fresh oregano and omitted 1/2 cup basil. I also increased the parmesan to a full cup and doubled the pine nuts. I also added a pinch of salt and pepper. It was a great base to get my creative juices flowing! Love it, will make again.

Agreed with naples34102. Too much garlic. I'm thinking of either reducing the quantity of, or roasting the garlic before blending it with the rest of the ingredients next time. Raw garlic has a very strong flavor so be careful how much you add in. Some other things I changed or added: 
- blanched the basil leaves before blending
- replaced a quarter of the quantity called for pine nuts with roasted almonds
- roasted the pine nuts
- added a pinch of fresh, lemon zest.

Make sure you toast the pine nuts. I use my blender to make this pesto. It's so good. My fave. My kids love it too. Delicious on cheese filled pasta. Freezes beautifully. Topped it with a little olive oil before freezing in individual containers. So good. I could eat it once a week. If you don't like as much cheese flavour, cut the cheese to 1/2 cup instead. I make it all the time.

I only use two cloves garlic as it was a bit too strong with four the first time I made it. And I use Romano instead of Parmesan as it has more flavor. Pine nuts are ridiculously expensive and not always easy to find, so I've used walnuts and more often than not, raw sliced almonds which work wonderfully. Excellent, quick recipe that  is a staple in my house now!

This recipe is fantastic. I used a little more cheese and olive oil than called for. I used to use shredded cheese but I used grated this time (as called for) and it worked out much better. I used pecorino because that's what I had, and it was great. I also added salt and fresh ground pepper and a shake of garlic powder. No parsley. The first time I made pesto I applied my "more garlic is always better" mentality. As I learned the hard way, when dealing with raw garlic (such as in pesto), more is not better. 4 cloves here is perfect (as called for); you can maybe do 5, but that's the max.  This was perfect for 3 people.  We served with homemade pasta and it was amazing. FYI--3 cups of packed basil amounted to about 3 oz of basil. ALTERNATIVE: One day I wanted pesto without all the calories in oil. I subbed in 1/2 ripe avocado and decreased the oil to 2.5 tbs. followed the rest to a T. It was perfect!! Highly recommend if anyone is watching their calories.

So good! Needed to trim my basil plant and found this great pesto recipe. Not too much garlic as others have said, I might add an extra clove or two next time. Other than adding juice from 1/2 a lemon I followed this recipe exact and it's fantastic. Great tangy flavor with the parsley and lemon- delicious in every recipe I've used this pesto in!

Love it!  I went a bit heavy on the pine nuts and garlic, but that's the way we like it!  I also serve it on pasta with more fresh parmesan, fresh pine nuts, and cherry tomato halves.  It's also great brushed on chicken breasts and grilled, or mixed with cream cheese as a spread for cocktail breads or as a thin layer under bruschetta. I made 3 batches today - 3 or 4 more to go before the frost takes my basil! (I freeze them in glad containers, with a thin layer of olive oil over the top to prevent browning of the basil.)

I actually replaced the pine nut with toasted almond and I added a bit extra cheese and olive oil  and it turned out very nice. I also tried making a much smaller batch with purple basil instead of the regular sweet basil, it turned out nicely but I added a little too much garlic and I also found out it's a bit more mild than regular basil so I didn't get quite what I was hoping for but it was still pretty good. I will be making this recipe again and maybe I'll experiment more with other nuts and types of basil and herb combinations

The only changes I made was to sub toasted, slivered almond for the pine nuts and reduced the parm to half. I made a double batch and came out with 21 good sized ice cubes. I generally throw this in cooked pasta and just add a bit of fresh shaved parm at the table. Is delicious with lamb and chicken, have also used to ring  a coating with meat and roll in panko or wrap with bacon for a nice flavor full crispy chicken, beef tenderloin or pork chop.

Loved this, but need to cut the garlic back some.  I used some little pieces a long with some large ones & it came out as to much.  We put on Balsamic triscuit crackers, red pepper slices, mozzarella cheese & fresh basil.  Will make again with all the fresh basil be have in the garden.

I added a bit of salt & pepper.   Also lemon juice to try to stave off oxidation & browning.  When I placed it in ice cube trays, I used a disposable pastry bag but that can be a bit messy - second time i used a small rectangular plastic scoop, which worked well.  When done, i then covered the tray with plastic wrap, pressed onto the top of the pesto, also to prevent oxidation.   Delicious recipe.  08.22.2015

First time making pesto, from my fresh basil from the garden.  I did add parsley, and followed the recipe exactly.  It tastes amazing, and my fiance and I are eating it over spaghetti squash with turkey sausage.

Wonderful recipe! I've made it two times already with the fresh basil in my garden. I've frozen some so I can enjoy it this winter. I followed the recipe and added the parsley. I like how the parsley mellowed out the basil. Won't need to look elsewhere for a pesto recipe. Thank you!

Excellent! I've added a little fresh oregano, at times and usually a pinch of salt. Also, I've substituted toasted or raw sunflower seeds, but pine nuts are better; just more expensive. I've mixed a bit of pesto into a green salad for a different dressing, and put it on a Triscuit, with a sliver of Parmesan and basil leaf &/or black olive, as an hors d'oeuvres. This recipe is classic!

OMG! I wish I could award this 10 stars! I made it exactly as directed and used the full amount of parsley. As suggested by other reviewers, I toasted the pine nuts and added a smidge of salt. This recipe is amazingly fast to pull together and a GREAT way to use up an herb garden's summer bounty. This will become a new staple in my house.  THANK YOU!

I chose this recipe because the ingredients are nearly the same as those of a traditional recipe that came from Italy. I prefer this one because it is looser making it easier to use. This is a great foundation for future pesto venture! Thank you!

Perfect pesto!  Ran short of pine nuts so subbed in some almonds...still came out perfect.  This freezes well!

Delicious!!! Never even knew my family like pesto until I made this for stuffed chicken pesto. I needed a recipe to use up some basil. We have 5 basil plants and a ton of basil. Making more this weekend to freeze. The only change I made was omitting the pine nuts due to an allergy in our family. Still tasted amazing!! Loved the parmigiana cheese. Thank you:)

I have been making pesto for the past few summers, but always winged it and never really was satisfied if I was making it correctly. I decided to try this recipe mostly to see if my ratios of basil, oil, pine nuts, garlic and parmesan were correct. I followed the recipe almost exactly and I have to say it was my best tasting pesto yet. I made 2 slight changes. I used 1/2 pine nuts and 1/2 slivered almonds. Pine nuts are so expensive. I also used "young" garlic which was being sold at my farmer's market this week. This garlic is not fully dried and has a slightly sweeter taste. This may have made a difference because I noticed some reviewers stated they cut the amount of garlic in half. One thing I learned from this recipe is I was not using enough fresh basil or olive oil in my previous attempts. Great recipe, simple and great tasting. Appreciate Anderval for posting it.

Perfect starter, i like a touch of fresh lemon juice, the pine nuts toasted, and just a touch of salt . Pepper also if you don't add parsley .

It was a little bland as is. I added extra basil, salt, pepper and red chili flakes and that helped a lot.

This recipe served as a starting point for me. I've had fresh pesto before and the garlic was overwhelming. So I used this recipe and roasted a whole head of garlic. added a pinch of salt and subbed almonds for pine nuts. I can already tell it's amazing but I'm going to let it sit overnight before using it in bruschetta and pasta salad!

This is the best pesto recipe I've tried!  Really perfect!  The only change I made, based on my previous experience making pesto, is that I processed the dry ingredients first, then drizzled in the olive oil as I continued to process, until it was the consistency I liked.  I didn't use the parsley, just kept it traditional.

I was looking for the pesto recipe from my childhood, and this came closest. I only put three garlic cloves and cut the oil down to 1/3 cup, because I like my pesto thick. I used only basil, and excellent quality Parmiggiano-Reggiano for the cheese. Turned out perfect!

I made this recipe to satisfy my daughter's craving for pesto pasta of a restaurant that we no longer live near.  It was very simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly, including the parsley. I made it to use in the Pesto Pasta recipe I also found on this site.  Even though I doubled the pesto for that recipe I still had plenty left over to freeze in cubes as others have recommended.  I'm looking forward to reducing prep time for the next time we want a pesto dish.  My daughter loved it!

Excellent recipe! The only change I made was using walnuts instead of pine nuts only because I couldn't find pine nuts at my grocery store. Would definitely still try with pine nuts if I could find them. But it was still really good like this.

Makes about 1 standard 8oz jar.

I like a thicker pesto. Used 1/4 oil and 1/2 cup Parmesan. The hint of parsley helps mellow the pesto but still leaves it bright tasting. This is good for people who are not huge basil fans. I can eat it straight so I am on the fence with the parsely. I added kosher salt and fresh pepper. Freeze in a quart ziploc, press flat and squeeze out air. Works better than ice cubes, just break off as much as you need.

This recipe was very easy to make.  It was my first time making it and I always follow the recipe exactly as it's listed the first time and make any changes the second time around.  I don't feel like there are any changes that need to be made with this recipe.  The flavors are bold and with only a pinch of kosher salt added, it was perfection.  I added it to cooked shelled pasta, added some more grated parmesan on top and my kids both had seconds.  Yes!

Very easy to make. This makes enough for 3 different occasions (or 3 boxes of pasta). I added salt, pepper, and extra garlic. I added the parsley too. I cooked one batch with sauteed cherry tomatoes with garlic over penne.  I froze the other 2 batches to enjoy another time.  I will double recipe next time as it is a pain to wash the processor parts for just 3 meals.

tastes great!  My only problem was with the pine nuts, I couldn't get them crushed fine enough. (Husband has diverticulitis so can't have bits of nuts)  next time I will try it with the almond paste instead, hopefully that will give the flavor but not the texture.

This was tasty.  I only used two cloves of garlic, and that was plenty.  I couldn't imagine using more. I omitted the parsley.  We ate it on pasta and crackers too. I froze the leftovers with a small bit of olive oil on top.

Just divine! I tweaked mine just a little to my taste. Reduced garlic cloves to 3. Used 1/2 cup of freshly grated high-end parmesan. I like Spanish olive oil because is has a strong taste. Left out the parsley. I think next time I will try toasting the pine nuts. I used the pesto over some curly pasta and I could have eaten the entire pot it was SO good!!

Made a half batch - loved the flavor of the toasted pine nuts and the addition of the parsley!  Scooped in to cubes to freeze for later!  I also added a tablespoon or two of lemon juice.  Excellent!

Didn't add parsley. Added lots of black pepper and a little kosher salt. It was delicious with grilled chicken and veggies over fettuccini.

I used walnuts, because I didn't have any pine nuts (they're outrageously expensive at the moment!), and toasted them as another reviewer recommended for the pine nuts.  I also threw in some kale for extra nutritional punch, and the result is delicious!  Oh, and I omitted the parsley, and reduced the garlic to two cloves.

Good results and simple recipe. Not much else I can say about a pesto recipe. If you serve it with pasta, cook to al dente, rinse with cold water (to stop cooking and keep the texture from becoming mushy), and drain. Next time I'll try toasting the pine nuts like others suggest.

Great recipe!  I put it on sandwiches and pasta and it's perfect.  I always roast the pine nuts prior to blending them in the food processor.  Also reserve some nuts to put on top for a nice garnish.  I have used pecans to make this before too, I roast them too and blend them just like the pine nuts, but I still use pine nuts to garnish.  So if you're in a pinch and have some left over pecans from Thanksgiving, whip 'em in there and it's fine!

I made this as directed, omitting the optional parsley & toasting the pine nuts as others suggested.  I scaled the recipe down to one cup of packed basil leaves to make just enough for the recipe I was using it in. I It was excellent!  I will definitely make again!

This was great!  Added a tad more Parmesan, because, why not??? Freezing the leftovers in ice cube tray topped with a bit of olive oil to pop out and use later in pasta or just to spread on bread.  Yes, I spread instead of dip.  You can get more that way.  ;-)

Mmmmm!  Never knew it was this easy!  I love garlic, but would still reduce the amount a bit next time.  Maybe a bit less olive oil, too, as it was a bit liquidy.  I took one reviewer's advice and froze it in ice cube trays.

This is an amazing pesto recipe. I got lazy a few times and messed with the measurements and it wasn't nearly as good. Be sure to toast the pine nuts. The oils that come out of the nuts have such a rich flavor, it makes all the difference.

I made a batch of this and compared it to "Pesto Sauce," also on this site, and this is the clear winner for me!  The ratio of basil/nuts/oil/cheese was perfect, and next time I will definitely try the parsley for a different twist.

Made this pesto tonight and loved it. Only change was that we used pistachios instead of pine nuts. We mixed it in our pasta dish and froze the rest for more yum at a later date. Really easy and now printed and put in the recipe box. Great cooking!!!

Awesome! I used raw blanched almonds instead of pinenuts because pinenuts were $12.99/oz at my grocery store! I also doubled the nuts and used 1 cup of shredded parmesan. YUM! :)

A great basic recipe for pesto.  I didn't have pine nuts so I used almonds and added a pinch of kosher salt.  Also, just two cloves of garlic.

I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 2 tsp. lemon juice in addition to the other ingredients. Also, I took another suggestion and used cashews in place of pine nuts since when I went to buy pine nuts, they were $26.99 a lb. I froze in ice cube trays. Yummy, yummy stuff. Thank you for the recipe.

I need to rate and review this recipe because I've made it several times and we just love it.  I'm making it again today before my basil all goes to seed.  I'm freezing it in ice cube trays (as someone suggested), then I'll put the frozen cubes in a ziplock bag to use over the winter when my garden is no longer providing us with bountious amounts of fresh basil.  Thanks for a simply divine recipe!

My sister and I have never made home made pesto before but we made this on Sunday for dinner and it was delicious. We only used 3 garlic cloves which was plenty, added some salt and black pepper, omitted the parsley because hers had gone bad and doubled the amount of Parmesan cheese because she misread the directions but it was wonderful and I would make it again just like that. Served it over linguini with some pan-fried chicken breast strips. Only thing I would do different next time, and there will be a next time, is to double the recipe so there are more left overs and save a little of the pasta cooking water to add into the pesto to make it a little creamier and coat the pasta better. Thanks for the great recipe. We thoroughly enjoyed it.

It may have been the fact that I used fresh basil from my garden, but this is seriously inedible.  Very disappointed that the wonderful basil that I grew was wasted.

Everyone around the table loved this but we all found it a little dry and added more olive oil. Otherwise easy to prepare, and a great summer dish if you have fresh basil.

Love this recipe!  Made it with extra garlic and pistachios instead of the pinenuts...  Used it on my homemade gnocchi and it was a hit!  Doubled the recipe and was able to freeze it in 1/4 cup portions for use later.  Definitely going into my "favorites" file.

Really good! Since I didn't have pine nuts I roasted walnuts. Also added juice of 1/2 lemon, a dash of salt, and used maybe about 2 Tbl additional olive oil. Once in the freezer containers, I drizzled with a little more olive oil (as suggested in some other reviews). My basil is just beginning to go crazy in the garden so I will definitely be making several more batches of this. Can't go wrong with this easy and extremely tasty recipe!

I made this recipe after searching different recipes. I have planted an herb garden for the first time and was anxious to try fresh pesto. I used walnuts instead of pine nuts because that is what I had on hand and I have never tasted pine nuts so I was a little unsure of them. I did use some parsley in it because I have that growing as well. I think next time I will add just a little salt to the recipe but other than that it was delicious. I used Kraft shredded parmesan and minced garlic from the produce department. Thanks for a great recipe

I am a huge fan of the classic, basic recipe - and this one for pesto is really good.  I tend to be garlic senstive so I only used one clove of garlic, minced. Also, I added salt to taste.  I will make this one again.

Made 1/2 recipe following proportions.  Great flavor.  Simple to make.  Added a dash of salt as others suggested.  Used cilantro instead of parsley.  Will make again.  Now it has me thinking of growing basil this summer.  I didn't last year but it would be handy to have frozen pesto made from the garden's bounty.

This is delicious! I reduced it down to 4 servings for a topping for salmon.  This had the perfect taste, except for the scaled down version I thought it was a little too thick.  I added about a tablespoon or two of vegetable broth and that fixed it up and gave it a little salt too!

Great recipe!

This pesto was excellent! Made a batch using basil from our little basil plant and used it on homemade pizza dough with veggies and mozzarella. Yum! I did use the parsley to stretch the recipe out a bit, but I might try without next time to compare the difference. I toasted the pine nuts. I added a squirt of fresh lemon juice to brighten it up a bit. Very good!

First time I ever made pesto sauce.  This was a good basic recipe but I felt like the pine nuts were a bit much for me.  Next time I'll cut the nuts in half.

EXCELLENT flavor!  I froze my mixture into individual servings, suited for my family.  I was afraid to put the pine nuts in prior to, so I added them when I was ready to use it.   I cannot wait to try this on other things, besides pasta!

This will be my go-to pesto recipe. I actually liked the amount of garlic, but perhaps the cloves I have are smaller than average. Unlike others, I included parsley in mine and thought it tasted great -not sure if it even makes much of a difference with or without that small amount.

I used this pesto to try "Creamy Pesto Shrimp Recipe". Amazing.

I love pesto! Beware the 4 cloves of garlic-  nobody loves garlic more than I do, but I actually had trouble sleeping after making this and My-oh-My I had to face away from Hubby!!! lol, I'm making it again tonight and will use 2 and 1/2 cloves I think. Awesome otherwise, although do add a bit of salt and a couple of drops of pasta water to thin it, It was quite thick. Thank you :)

Used 2 big garlic cloves, didn't toast the pine nuts, left out the parley and added a generous pinch of Kosher salt.  Husband actually ate pesto instead of his beloved Prego red sauce on refrigerated tortellini.

Amazing pesto recipe and so quick and easy. Used almonds (toasted) instead of pine nuts and a squeeze of lemon. The taste has a strong garlic flavor but it's not overpowering. Tossed a little of this pesto with fresh diced tomato on my pasta and broiled tomato halves brushed with pesto for a side dish! Tasty!

For never making pesto this was super easy and very yummy.  Even my 20month old dug into it.  I did toast the pine nuts as other suggested.  I am really excited to try the pesto pasta chicken from this website.

Was Yummy and Easy!  Made it just as written, excluding the parsley.  Maybe next time I will add some salt, but I don't think it needs it. And I will also try toasting the pine nuts that I add to the pesto and not just the ones I sprinkle on top.

My roommate declared this "awesome" but maybe I'm just too used to pre-packaged pesto...  I processed this for quite a long time (also added extra olive oil and cut the garlic down to three cloves), but I found it to be too "leafy", for lack of a better word.  I'll have to try it in a recipe but based on my first impressions, I probably won't be making this again.
