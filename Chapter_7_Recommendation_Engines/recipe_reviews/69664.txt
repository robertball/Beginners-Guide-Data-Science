I love the concept of this muffin!  In fact, I assumed the pineapple was in the batter until I read the reviews.  Making this even better, I had fresh ripe, sweet pineapple.  I put it in my food processor and then squeezed it out using 2 coffee filters and that worked better than the collander.  I used 1 packed cup of pineapple.  I added to the batter:  1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. rum extract, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  This made 6 Texas-size muffins baked at 37 minutes.  *careful though, these really poof up, so next time I will use less batter and make 7 giant size muffins.  This would also be great with a few marichino cherries chopped with the pineapple, almost like an upside downcake concept.  The streusel topping is great.  I didn't have enough butter for both topping and batter, so used oil in the batter.  They were not dry at all.  They look oh so gourmet.  I also didn't melt the margarine for the streusel, just cut it in with a pastry blender. These really have a bakery look.

I made this a little healthier by using whole wheat white flour and organic ingredients. I did not bother saving the pinapple to spoon over the top, I folded the pineapple in the muffin batter with the rest of the wet ingredients. This recipe turned out a very pretty muffin that was quite moist, though a little on the sweet side for us. The crumb topping was quite good with the pineapple flavor, we just didn't care for the combination of cinnamon and pineapple. That's not the recipe's issue, it's our own personal taste. I'd like to play with this recipe a bit and see if I can't cut back on the sugar, add a little more pineapple and maybe make this a little healthier as we all really liked pineapple in a muffin. It was quite tasty! EDITED: I have made this three times now without the cinnamon the last two times and we really love these muffins. The flavor is almost like an upside down pineapple cake only without all the work!

I loved these muffins and my husband hasn't stopped raving about them! They tasted like the came from a bakery. Mine turned out having almost the texture and taste of a cupcake. I didn't change much but after reading the other reviews, I sliced about 2 Tbsp pineapple chunks which I added to the batter and didn't melt the butter for the topping but used room temp instead. Thanks!   **Update - I made these again and without thinking, I melted the butter for the topping like the instructions say. The tops of the muffins came out hard and crunchy but when I used room temp butter the next time, the tops were soft and came out just perfect. So it's the melted butter that makes the difference.**

Yes! Finally, a real, no nonsense muffin and not a heavy, sweet cake posing as one! Given some of the reviews that led me to think these muffins might be mediocre, I was unsure of what I'd end up with but I needn't have worried - I was pleased. Also given that some reviewers had a problem with these being dry and/or sticking to the muffin liners, I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the batter which apparently took care of the problem because the liners peeled off easily to reveal a light and fluffy muffin that was moist, pleasantly sweet and delicately pineapple flavored. I did add the pineapple to the batter as I didn't like the idea of plopping it on the top, preferring the pineapple flavor to be in the muffin itself.  The topping is a little different, crunchy but not hard. Next time, however, I think I'll skip melting the butter.  A really delightful muffin and quite refreshing for "I'm Sick of Winter" malaise.

I followed Tunisianwife's suggestion and added pineapple to the batter along with nutmeg and vanilla.  I also did not melt the butter for the topping but used room temperature butter.  Baked the large muffins for 37 minutes, regular size for 30 minutes and they were all gone in minutes.  Delicious! I am so glad that I added the extra pineapple to the batter as it was a light, sweet flavor.  Thanks!

For me they were just okay taste-wise, but I gave them 4 stars because I think if I would have just listened to some other reviews and mixed the fruit right into the batter they would have been very good.  The texture was wonderful but the batter was bland.  DEFINITELY mix the fruit into the batter !

These muffins were pretty good, though I did make several changes. I stirred the pineapple into the batter, doubled the amount of juice, and also used room temp butter for the topping, not melted. They came out quite moist with a nice pineapple flavor. My only problem was with them sticking badly to the paper liners.

Something went very wrong with this recipe. I thought the topping was tasty but, the body of the muffin was very bland and almost chewy in texture. I thought the amount of baking soda was a bit excessive. A TABLEspoon? Really? Also, it didn't seem to cook evenly. The edges were overdone and stuck to the muffin cups big time. A real disappointment! Maybe this recipe could be salvaged by adding applesauce, crushed pineapple, more butter/oil and/or turning the temperature down to 350. (?) :-(

These are actually quite good. I used a 14 oz can of pineapple, half of which I added to the batter and half of which I used to top the muffins. I ran out of baking powder, so I didn't wuite use a full tablespoon- but there was no real difference. My sister was over when they came out of the oven and she proclaimed 'These are actually quite addictive!" (only after her 4th one!)

I made them last week on a whim, didn't drain the crushed pineapple just opened the can right into the batter and mixed it in. There was pineapple right through every single muffin, I also like other reviewers didn't melt my butter for the topping. Absolutely delightful muffin recipe thanks. 

I've also used this recipe with canned apricot, peach, pear and apples (added cinnamon to the batter) each one is just as good as the other.

I came on the net in search just for a pineapple muffin and this is the first one i found. 
I just ate two of them. They are very yummy. I added a lil bit of vanilla, i dunno if it made a difference. 
When ever i make more, i will probably add more pineapple. I love warm baked pineapple. mmmmm.
Thank you very much for the recipe :}

I love pineapples. I had a nice sweet ripe "candy" pineapple, which is only available here in Hawaii. When cutting it, a lot of the natural sweet juices flowed from the pineapples. I used buttermilk for the 3/4 cup of milk called for in the recipe. Batter was easy to put together. I added the fresh pineapple bits, with juices, to the batter and reserved a little pineapple bits for the cinnamon/sugar topping mixture. I ended up with 18 muffins. I noticed that the batter rises up. The closer it got to 30 minutes, the top start to get very dark brown so I took it out of the oven. The muffin was moist. The pineapples were delicately sweet and juicy. I loved biting into the pineapple tidbits. The inside was a nice pretty color with specks of fresh pineapple baked right in. As for the topping, I used softened, room temperature, butter to make the topping. The cinnamon/sugar topping tasted fine thou it was a little on the dark brown color. It was quite different - it had a crunch-kind of a hard topping, whereas the muffin underneath was light and fluffy. I could do without the topping next time where all I have is the pineapple muffins baked inside and sprinkled on top. A very light and refreshing treat.

I wish the directions had been more specific regarding the crushed pineapple and the topping. I made 3 different pans of 12 (I doubled the recipe). The first time, I filled the muffin cups just over half full. I added a scant tablespoon of pineapple and a scant tablespoon of topping. That was not nearly enough! So the next batch, I added a HEAPING tablespoon of pineapple and then of topping. Still, I wasn't really satisfied. For the third batch, I mixed the rest of the pineapple (and I ended up needing more than called for) in the batter, filled the cups 2/3 full and added almost 2 tablespoons of topping. These were PERFECT, absolutely perfect. Unlike the first two batches, the muffin was MOIST, and I could taste the pineapple. The topping was perfect at that amount. I would definitely recommend using more pineapple and adding it straight to the batter.

I omitted the topping, mostly due to lack of brown sugar, and to skip on extra fat and calories (used Splenda instead of sugar too). I also added the pineapple to the batter. With that said, These came out great! I will make again and maybe experiment with more flavors.

This recipe calls for way too much baking powder.
you only need one teaspoon of baking powder per every two cups of flower. Definitely no more than 2 teaspoons of baking powder per two cups of flour. This is a good recipe minus all the excessive baking powder.

This needed some changes for it to be a good muffin.  First of all I used veg oil instead of melted butter in the batter. Next I added 1tsp vanilla essence. Only used 2tsp baking powder so I don't get a cakey texture. Placed one cup of crushed pineapple in the batter also used 1/2 cup pineapple juice next time will use all in juice and leave out the milk. Also used the pineapple on the top of the muffin batter with the topping.  This turned out well DH and youngest son like this alot I however thought it could be a bit sweeter.  Also baked for 25min so it would not dry out. Still I think I will check it after 20min. I made the topping with room temperature butter. Came out crunchy and we all liked it. I will make it again but with these changes.

Good recipe, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs some major modification.  The idea of placing the pineapple on top of the batter is unique, but unfortunately results in a much less flavorful muffin.  As per others suggestions, I highly recommend adding the pineapple directly to the batter.  Using canned pineapple, I found that the muffin wasn’t as sweet as I normally like it, even with the addition of the crumb topping.  To compensate, I sprinkled extra white sugar on the tops of the muffins and got rave reviews from hubby’s coworkers.  I also added vanilla, cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg, and rum extract.  The muffins are truly beautiful, regardless of taste, they are very visually appealing.

I added 1 tablespoon of Vanilla Extract and put the pineapple in the batter. I also added some blueberries. They came out really moist and the topping added the perfect amount of sweetness. I imagine they would come out rather bland without the pineapple and vanilla added to the batter.

These were nice. After reading the reviews I added half a can of pineapple to the muffin mixture and used the rest for the topping. I thought the pineapple flavour wasn't strong enough but my husband said he liked the subtle flavour.

The cake itself so flavorless (even even I added pineapple like other reviewers) If I was to make this better I would mix brown sugar with the pineapple and butter on top like a pineapple upside down cake.

I made this after the good reviews. I did everything as said, only used fresh pineapple I crushed. They didn't rise at all and tasted bad, weird. I cook frequently from this website, it's my first bad experience.

I'm not sure if it's just the way I made them, but DO NOT MAKE THESE!!! They taste like batter and the pineapple just made it worse. I do not recommend.

I thought these were great. I used fresh pineapple putting it through the food processer to "crush" it.  I thought the 1/4 cup of butter was a bit much for the crumble mixture...mine came out more like a paste than a crumble, about half that would have been plenty.

I used 10 ounces of pineapple and added it right to the mixture.  I also did not melt the butter for the topping as people suggested.  I also baked the muffins at 375 for 25 minutes.  Do not use cupcake liners!!!!!  The muffins will stick bad - though if you wait a few days they will gather enough moisture from the air and come out easier.  I found it to be much easier to just grease and flour the muffin pan.  Definitely go with 12 larger muffins.  I made two batches the first time I tried and made two more the next day.  Everyone loves them!  So easy to make.  Don't worry about adding pineapple to the top of the muffins - it is unnecessary work.

These were quite awful. I added extra juice, even extra pineapple. They were dense and I could not even taste the pineapple. I didn't have the topping ingredients on-hand, but that was ok by me since I didn't want the added sugar. Had I had them, perhaps the saving grace would have been strictly the taste of brown sugar, with the muffin simply acting as a vehicle to get it to my mouth. Will not be making again.

Delish. I was looking for a recipe that I thought my elementary students would enjoy. Also, one that I would not be tempted to overeat, as I am watching my weight. This muffin is tasty and delicious and a perfect match! Not too sweet. Tomorrow my students will be giving me the final verdict.

I made several changes to the original recipe, largely based on other reviewers' suggestions (Tunisianwife and Sarah Jo, for example), and also because of the current ingredients I had available. 

For the batter: I substituted soy milk for cow milk;

I just tried this recipe out today and they are very delicious! I did what others suggested and used room temp. Butter for the topping and I added a whole cup of freshed chopped pineapple in the batter. I did not used muffin cups and poured directly into the muffin pan, but used real butter to grease the pan and they came right out without any problems! I know that different ovens vary on baking time and mine only took about 22 mins to bake or else they would have burned.

I'd give this recipe 1 star but since my 4 year old really likes them I bumped it up to 3.  I found these muffins pretty but very bland.  It turned to mush in your mouth.  I don't think I'll be making these ones again.  Thanks though.

Very moist and tasty recipe.  Cut to 12 servings for normal muffins.  I did mix 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp nutmeg plus a little extra pineapple into the batter as well as put pineapple on top, will use more pineapple in batter next time, but still like the pineapple on top.  When they mounded up, my pineapple and crumb topping were not evenly distributed, not sure what to do about that, but will have to experiment.

I followed some of the recommendations. I used a larger can of crushed pineapple and added some to the batter, along with a little vanilla extract.  They came out quite good and sweet.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.

Well, I was hesitant to make these because of the mixed reviews, but they looked and sounded so good.  I probably should have listened to my gut!  I made the recommended changes - added the pineapple to the batter, didn't melt the butter for the topping. I didn't have any problem with sticking to the pan (greased pan with crisco). However this just doesn't taste like a muffin!  It has a weird dense texture and hardly tastes like pineapple (as others have said).  The crumbly topping, I have to say, is great! And the end product looks delicious, but it just doesn't live up in taste.  I won't be making this again.

The taste was great if you're looking for a plain, cakey muffin -- it definitely wasn't fruity enough.  My fruit-hating husband said - "These are great, you can eat fruit and not even taste it!"  Goes to show how much pineapple flavour there actually was!!  I also found these muffins very dry, in spite of adding the crushed pineapple right into the batter. Mind you, I was short 3 oz. of pineapple, but the muffins were such that 3 extra oz. would not have helped!  The muffins stuck to the papers terribly.  I may try these again with more pineapple and less cooking time, but I am not too hopeful.....

Being in Hawai'i and all, we used not-totally-ripe (although that wasn't my fault) white pineapple, white chocolate chips, and dropped the cinnamon.  It's good to fill the cups all the way, then they pouff up nicely.  Best muffins ever!  And of course we broiled them.

This was a good basic muffin recipe.  however I made some changes to my liking.  I used olive oil instead of the butter and honey instead of the white sugar.  I also like adding some pineapple into the recipe along with walnuts.  Not so much pineapple on the top,  Also added walnuts to the topping,  Made them good and they were moist the next day,

Good recipe.  I made it without the topping and mixed the pineapple into the dry ingredients.  This will help ensure the fruit doesn't fall to the bottom.  Baked it in a heavy ceramic loaf pan.  You can do this with any muffin recipe.  Just remember to decrease the oven temp by 50 degrees and increase the baking time.  It turned out to be a dense almost pound cake texture.  It doesn't  have an intense pineapple flavor but makes a nice, filling snack.   I might double the pineapple next time. Thanks!

I added blueberries to them when it was a batter and that took the over powering sweetness out. They are perfect mixture of sweet and tangy. My husband loves them.

Moist and tasty.  I put the pineapple in the batter.  That is why I believe the muffins were so moist.

These muffins are a 4* not quite a 5* keeper.  I did add a tablespoon of rum and a little vanilla.  They were nice tasting but did not totally blow me away.  Also the finished appearance mushroomed rather than rise how I like.  Glad I made these, just not sure they are a keeper for me.

I love this recipe because it works really well with whole wheat flour. I used  fresh pineapple, 1 1/2 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour I also added a bit of pineapple and some brownsugar and cinnamon to the batter. I didnt make  the topping and the muffins didnt need it. Ill be making this again soon.

This recipe is fantastic.  I read reviews and was worried, however I did a few things differently.  I followed all the ingredients as written, but made sure I didn't over mix the batter (which is key) used more crushed pineapple on some of the muffin tops (experimented) and it was even better and also only baked for 25 minutes.  (my tooth pick still came out clean)  Also, when I ran out of pineapple I shoved a few fresh blueberries into the the last ones and it was great.  We will for sure make these again!! My kids and husband loved them!!!  I'm thinking I'll use it as a dessert as well with some fresh whipped cream!!

these are great! pineapple muffins are my absolute favorite and now (thanks to this awesome recipe! (: ) my church youth group is a fan too! the only thing is, i use about twice as much pinapples, so that the entire tops are pineapple, it makes them more moist. (:

Overall, a pleasant little muffin, though not exactly what I was looking for. I would have liked more pineapple in the muffin and a topping without the flour. The flour made the topping a bit dry and blander tasting than I like. But it mixed up easily into a very fluffy spongey batter that you have to carefully divide.

I was so excited to try this recipe - used fresh pineapple, and added it to the batter.  They puffed beautifully, and suddenly completely collapsed, shrinking more and more as they baked.  Perhaps I should have used some baking powder to balance the acidity of the pineapple.  I think it could use more pineapple flavor, but I'm not sure the dough could handle any more.

I loved these pineapple muffins, they are not very sweet and the pineapple brown sugar topping provided the right amount of sweetness and it got kind of crunchy on top.  I did substitute Vanilla Soy Milk for the whole milk which added nice flavor to the muffin.  Next time I may increase the sugar to 1 cup.  But everybody in my family loved them.  Thanks!

Delicious! I didn't have milk on hand but I did have buttermilk.  I mixed in the pineapple. I mixed all the wet ingredients first before adding to dry. I omitted the topping.  The muffin is very fluffy! I'm learning to not over mix muffin batter so that my muffins won't turn out rubbery. This was a first success in a while.

I made a significant number of changes to this recipe and it turned out great: Whole wheat flour instead of white. Grape seed oil instead of melted butter. 1 tsp of baking soda. Additional 1/4 cup of spiced rum for flavour.  It's the topping that makes these muffins so good.  Body is boring.  Perhaps some cinnamon or apple sauce in the body.

Good base recipe.  I even tried my hardest to botch it and I didn't (I didn't add the milk and forgot the salt).  I did add all of the pineapple juice to the batter which is probably why the milk not being there didn't make a huge impact.  Can def tell the salt wasn't in there, but my mistake.    I rated this a 4 because I did have to sub things in otherwise it would have been a frighteningly bland muffin.  Added the pineapple to the batter, added cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  Also, on the topping, I didn't have room temp butter, so I melted it and subbed 1/4 cup quick oats and did 1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp flour.  This gave it the crumbly topping called for (also added a bit of fiber).  Oh, and I did add nutmeg to the topping as well.    Good base, otherwise!  I'm going to see how this works with peaches!  That will probably be absolutely outstanding!

i put the chopped pineapples in the mix and actually i think it made this recipe better. Also i put coconut shreds on top as well as the brown sugar topping i think the problem with this recipe is there needs to be a little bit more pineapple juice but besides that it is a decent recipe.

These were amazing!  I made them wrong the first time and put the pineapple in the mix.  The second time I made them right.  I doubled the recipe.  Living in Puerto Rico, things get wet in a hurry here, but these were gone before I had time to put any in the freezer. This one is a keeper.

These were really good. My only problem was that the topping mixture came out king of pasty so it was hard to "sprinkle" it on the muffins. Other than that GREAT recipe once you dont melt the butter.

I was trying to use up some leftover pineapple when I stumbled upon this recipe.  I wasn't in the mood to make 18 muffins, tho, so I decided to to coffee/cake style.  Made as directed (only change was adding a tbsp of vanilla/orange extract).  Baked in 9" pan for 35" and it was simply wonderful.  A little dry, perhaps, but I'm sure thats due to the way I baked it, but good eats with a cup of coffee.  Nice job!  I think tonight will serve with a small dollop of either whipped or ice cream on the side.

Very moist and good.  The only thing that I did differently was add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I may change the streusel topping as well. Overall, very good!

When will I learn to read the reviews before I make the recipe?  As others stated, these turned out dry, stuck to the muffin papers and were over cooked, even at 25 minutes.  I thought there was too much topping, and didn't use it all.  If I try these again, I will definitely mix the pineapple into the batter, undrained, and use some vanilla.  Has any one tried cooking these at a lower temperature?  Maybe 350 F?

I’m an absolute muffin addict, and I couldn’t have been more impressed by these muffins. It’s a wonderful, light and easy to make recipe – and also surprisingly healthy as regards sugars levels. I didn’t bother making the topping, and mine turned out just lovely. I mixed in a dash of cinnamon to the main mixture, and also put in ½ cup of pineapple juice – this turned out great. I’ll definitely bake it again!

I actually thought these were bland and did not have a very good muffin consistancy.  Also, the topping was not sweet enough and did not go well with the muffin itself.  Sorry.

This muffin had a great flavor and crumb.  I mixed 1/2 of the pineapple into the batter, added 1/2 t nutmeg and 1 t vanilla.  For the topping, I had butter that was melted, but back to room temp, and it was perfect for the topping.  I baked these 27 minutes for 12 muffins.  Excellent!

These muffins were alright, I found them a little bland or doughy tasting. The topping makes them better. They stuck like crazy to the paper cups even though I sprayed them with non stick spray before pouring the batter in. We had to eat these muffins off of the paper! Any other suggestions to avoid this in the future would be appreciated.

These were disappointing for me... I read through the reviews and put one cup finely chopped fresh pineapple in the batter as many had recommended, but the muffin was underwhelming. The streusel topping sank into the muffin and because of that wasn’t really crunchy or very noticeable. The muffin itself also had a bit of a strange taste, I wonder if 1 tbsp baking powder is just too much...

Ended up really crumbly. I used fresh pineapple, added most of the pineapple into the batter. Reserved a small amount for topping. Would add more reserved pineapple next time, otherwise really great taste-wise.

We really liked this recipe. I would add some crushed pineapple into the cake part next time to drive home the pineapple.  I did use some of the juice and spooned over the top of each muffin while they were hot. 
This will be a repeated recipe !

Great tasting! I mixed the pineapple into the batter. I also added a large can of mandarin oranges. There was too much toppings.

These are definitely delicious. The pineapple adds a nice tang to the muffin. The brown sugar topping is great. These were a hit. will make again.

These are easy and delicious!  First time I made without coconut and they were moist and so good.  The second time I added the coconut but found them to be a bit dry.  Might make them without it from now on.  Easy and soooo good.

My husband raved about the muffins.  Would definitely make it again.  Would consider adding more flour to the crumb mix to make it more "crumbly."

These muffins turned out wonderful! Moist & great taste! I did make some changes though mainly because some ingredients I just didn't have on hand. I did add the pineapple to the batter but I would like to try it with the crushed pineapple on top of the batter next time. I didn't have crushed pineapple, only chunks, so I cut all of the chunks in half because I wanted smaller pieces. I dried them a little with paper towels then coated them lightly with flour so they wouldn't sink to the bottom of the muffins and set them aside to add at the very end. I just folded the chunks into the batter being careful not to over mix it. (That's 1 thing I've discovered about muffins, DO NOT OVER MIX THE BATTER! It'll ruin them every time! Only mix until the flour is incorporated into the batter. If you can still see a little bit of flour it's okay. )  I also didn't have any milk so I substituted more pineapple juice making it 1 cup pineapple juice instead of 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup pineapple juice. I also added about 1/4 cup of shredded coconut to the batter & sprinkled a little bit on the top of each muffin before baking. I didn't think 1/4 cup of coconut was quite enough. If I'd had more coconut I would have used 1/2 a cup. My brother and nephew love these muffins

Wow, so good!  I changed some things:  used shortening  (did not melt) instead of butter, more cinnamon (personal preference), and mixed the pineapple into the batter as suggested by other reviewers.   I used fresh pineapple cut up fine (used Ninja to chop.)

I followed the recipe pretty much as written but did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients as mentioned in another review. I also was able to make eight large muffins after reading that these puff up quite a bit...they came out perfect, not too sweet just the right amount of sugar.

Muffin stuck terribly to the muffin papers - lost 1/4 of your muffin.  Was tasty - glad I followed the reviews to add pineapple into the batter. My topping was also clumpy so was a bit strange.  Won't make them again

According to my family (who are my raters) these are "very nice".  At first I was a bit dismayed that the recipe makes 16 rather than 12, but I had extra silicon muffin cups so used 4 of those.  My next concern was whether these would stick to the muffin pan and be difficult to get out -- they came out beautifully.  So, overall a reasonably easy recipe that pineapple lovers enjoy.  Very nice!

We really liked these muffins!  I made just as written, but next time, I would add the crushed pineapple to the batter and use soft, but not melted butter for the topping.  Melted butter for the topping leaves it thick and pasty, not "sprinklable."

We all liked the muffins, but I think I will add a little more pineapple next time to give them more flavor. After reading other reviews, I mixed the pineapple into the batter, which makes more sense to me than putting it on top. Also, I think I will try cutting the baking time down to 28 minutes to make the muffins more tender. They were easy to make.

These are light and delicious! Because of other reviews, I added the pineapple to the batter. Be sure your topping is cut very fine as larger chunks get very hard. A bit crumbly but maybe I blended my pineapple too much. I'll definitely make these again!

This recipe has no taste to it. I baked it at the temperature called for but at 8 minutes instead, due to making mini muffins.
Time for more experimentation...

loved these!  Amazing flavor :)!!!!made them gluten free though with 1 cup ground oats, 1/2 cup rice flour & 1/2 cup tapioca flour/starch, 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. Added vanilla. After reading reviews, I decided to use more pineapple about 10oz with juice into the batter, a bit extra on top with the "sprinkled" butter sugar mixture. No cinnamon.  My sugar mixture was too wet to truly crumble - i won't use melted butter next time.  Really moist, each bite was amazing :) didn't have that much rise but still lovely!

i made it as the recipe stated but next time i will mix the pineapple in the batter. it was delicious, fruity and has a nice flavor. Do not overmix, as i barely mixed all the ingredients and it was baked quite evenly. my son and i loved the crunchy top, but used just a half of the topping mix.

This was a pretty good muffin.  I made it exactly as recipe was written. What I would recommend is to mix in the pineapple rather than just putting on top.  It would better distribute the yummy pineapple flavor.  They baked up beautifully.   I will make these again

Yes, I liked this recipe, because it was just what I was looking for. A base recipe for pineapple muffins that used ingredients I had on hand. Did I change some things? Admittedly, yes. But, I always do that. I read through the reviews and decided to make these changes: Used half whole wheat flour, added a drizzle of oil to batter so they would not stick to liners, added the crushed pineapple to batter instead of topping, used softened butter in topping, decreased amount of topping. Result? So good! I would make again!

I made these in mini muffin tins with liners. They were ready in about 13 minutes and fantastic. I used some expired yogurt in place of some of the milk, but otherwise made as directed....sooooo good. Even my husband who isn't a big fan of pineapple, loved them.

Made these yesterday and had some fresh, then I froze what we didn't eat.  I just reheated a couple this morning, being very careful to flip them and get them just barely warm.  I do this regularly with muffins.  I've rated these based on the recipe given, not on how it could be with modifications. These have too much baking powder, and you can taste it. They are also on the dry side. My 10-yr-old daughter thinks they aren't sweet enough and, although I don't think muffins should taste like cupcakes, I agree.  Next time I will try half the baking powder, 1/3 cup of butter (or maybe oil), and 2/3 cup sugar.

Very good! Just as promised they are moist and very fluffy. I made some with and without pineapple since my husband does not like the fruit. I did make them in cupcake papers and they stuck to the papers. Both my 6 and 1 year old ate two when they first came out.

We love this muffin. I changed it up just a bit. I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple instead of an 8 oz. can. I also added the pineapple to the batter as some have suggested. I sprayed my paper liners with Pam also..sure helps to get the paper off of the muffins. I used a different topping as I wanted the muffin to taste kind of like a Pina Colada.I made a coconut streusel. 3Tbs.shredded coconut,2Tbs.melted butter,4Tbs sugar,2Tbs.flour and I added a 1tsp. of coconut extract.They turned out wonderful and I felt like I was at the beach.

Very easy to make. I would definitely try adding another half a can of pineapple to it. I too also added all the pineapple and vanilla extract to the batter when mixing. Very moist and delicious!

I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and grated rind of one orange to the batter.   The brown sugar topping was too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll add the pineapple directly to the batter.   If I want to add more sweetness, after the have baked I can dip the tops in melted butter and then in sugar or a cinnamon sugar mixture.   The muffins did stick to the papers.  Next time I'll just spray the muffin cups with Pam.  Will definitely make again with the changes as noted.

I think this is a great recipe, but agree with all the reviews, the pineapple should be added to the batter.  The papers stick like glue to the muffin, so next time I will either try parchment liners or go through the chore of greasing & flouring the muffin tins.

I made these muffin's last night and they were a huge hit in my office! I did follow a few other reviews adding more juice to the batter and mixing the pineapples right into the batter! Kept the Muffins super moist and not overly sweet. As far as the muffin liners sticking, I followed the advise listed in the reviews of adding a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the batter, however that did not help at all. I will definitely make these again and try to spray the liners with cooking oil in hopes that will prevent them from sticking.

I just finished baking these muffins. Instead of crushed pineapple, I used pureed, and left off the topping to cut down on the butter. I absolutely love these! They were moist and almost like a cupcake, but still had the light sweetness and yummy tang of a great muffin. I suggest these highly.

This is a great recipe but like all the other reviews, I went with adding the pineapple to the batter and used room-temp butter instead of melting it. I also substituted the white sugar with evaporated cane sugar which made them sweet enough but not overwhelming. Delicious Pineapple Muffins will be a fave in my kitchen!

These muffins were OK; nothing special. I read the reviews and used room temp butter, along with folding the crushed pineapple into the batter for flavor and moisture. The taste was decent, although what really ruined these muffins for me was how they stuck to the muffin papers. Half of the muffin was stuck to the paper, which was a huge bummer. If these tasted more complex, I might consider trying to make them again and adding a tablespoon or two of oil to the batter, but I'm not motivated enough to do that considering that I like more complex, layered flavors.

These are very good. They are actual muffins, as opposed to cupcakes in disguise. I made mine with half whole-wheat flour and they turned out very well. I froze them for quick breakfasts for my family. The inside was slightly drier than I would have liked (even before freezing), which I attributed to my use of whole wheat flour. I think I will add a small amount of applesauce next time to balance it out. The recipe made 12 large muffins, which rose up to nice crowns over the top of the muffin tin.

I just made these and WISH I would've read the reviews first..I would also not melt the topping butter next time because melted butter does not make crumbles...and next time I'll add the pineapple into the recipe as well, wasn't sure if it would be too moist and not bake well...but reading the reviews looks like that's OK.  The topping just kinda 'sat' on the muffin.

Lite fluffy and simple. These would go great as an afternoon snack with a glass of iced tea. 

I would use cold not melted butter for the streusel unless you want a hard crust.

Don't expect pineapple upside down cake or you'll be disappointed.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My fiancee bought chunk pineapple instead, so I had to slice it up first, but it was well worth the extra effort!  I also used an entire teaspoon of cinnamon, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to NOT melt the butter in the topping - the room temperature butter made the topping mixture great!    SO good, I will double the recipe next time so we can have some to freeze or give away~  Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

This muffin was delicious with a tender crumb and fresh taste. I stirred in 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts into the batter. Also, the recipe made 9 muffins for me, in a regular muffin tin. These are delish. Try them.

Pretty good. The base definitely needs more flavor though. I used whole wheat flour and yogurt instead of butter. I also added some extra pineapple into the batter and I'm glad I did because without it, it would have been completely flavorless. Might make it again with some added flavorings.

I put all the ingredients together and mixed it. It was extremely tasty. I also oiled the bottom of the muffin tins. I didn't use the high temperture listed and my muffins fell. Maybe too much liquid or not enough heat.Will try again.

In all fairness we didnt follow the recipe exactly, my boyfriend insists he knows best, overbeating and additing way too much pineapple so that it was a big, moist, collapsed-muffin mess. Tasty but way to moist... so follow the recipe!

As a whole, these are pretty good, but they are more or less just a basic muffin.  I could only taste a hint of the pineapple now and then in the ones I've eaten.  If I make them again, I think I will try stirring the pineapple right into the batter.  Also, at least for me, I found the recipe rather time-consuming, but it was a nice project for a chilly, wet mid-April Saturday afternoon.  I doubled the recipe and used a 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple, which resulted in 30 cupcake-sized muffins.  I used paper liners, but next time will probably spray the cups with non-stick cooking spray instead.  The liners tended to stick to the muffins when I sampled them the same day I baked them, especially to the bottoms.  However, after refrigerating them overnight, the paper peeled off a lot easier.  There was also too much butter in the topping, so I added some extra flour and brown sugar to make it more "sprinkleable."

Actually, I was a bit disappointed with these.  There were so many rave reviews, while I felt they were just "good."  They were pretty, but the muffin itself was a bit blah.  I am willing to take the blame on this one, as I am infamous for following recipes and getting abnormal results.  I'd make these again if I had the excess pineapple laying around the house that I did this time, but I probably wouldn't make them with the intention to impress anyone.  Okay.  That's all.

This recipe sounded so good but when baked I was quite disappointed. Needs much more pineapple and the outside of the muffin is to tough. It also did not rise well. I'm going to try to tweek this recipe.

The idea behind these is great, it's just as is, they are dry on the muffin part. Added another 1/4 cup pineapple juice and mixed in a little extra pineapple with the batter. Much moister, and a lot more flavor. Used room temp butter for the topping to get the crumblier texture, use cold if you are looking for the streudel texture. God recipe, just needed a little tweaking.

I found the consistency too doughy and chewy.  Pineapple needs to be added to the dough and a lot of it for taste.  The tops get a little too hard.

I found these muffins to be a bit dry.  Also, I may add a little pineapple extract to the dough.  I will make these muffins again.  This time I may add some crushed pineapple to the batter as well.

Yum!  This recipe yielded 12 muffins for me, and they were moist and tasty.  Next time I'll also add a little pineapple to the batter, and only soften the butter to mix in the crumb topping to make it more crumbly.

This was my first time making pineapple muffins, but these were pretty easy to make and very tasty! The recipe is very similar to coffee cake with the crumb topping. I sliced some pineapple chunks instead of using crushed pineapple and they were delicious! Thanks for the great idea!
