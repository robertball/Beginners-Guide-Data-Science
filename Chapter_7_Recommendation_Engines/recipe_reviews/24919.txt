A really easy recipe.  Not only is it kid friendly but the kids helped me make it. To make it even easier  I use the 93% ground beef so you can skip draining it.  My group liked it with the hot & chunky salsa.

Oh my gosh, this was great!   I did leave out the olives as I dislike them.  I generally prefer cheddar or Jack cheese for something like this and was a bit leary of the American cheese.  And I could tell it was American, but it was very subtle and just blended in with the other flavors. This is not a very spicy dip and is a bit different than some other similar ones, but it does have flavor.  (And a hot salsa would spice it up if someone wants that.  I used mild.)  Great with tortilla chips and I wanted to just keep eating the stuff after it was gone.  Unfortunately it's not something I would make often cause it's so fattening (even w/low fat cheese, milk & vegetarian beans, there's still the beef & tortilla chips), and I also try to keep cut back on the red meat.  Definitely "junk" food.  So sad. :-(

I was ok, I didn't care for the texture of the beans in the cheese dip. If I make it again I'll leave the beans out and put sausage in instead to give it more of a zip.

I made this for a potluck and there was not a drop left!  It is super easy.  I have made it with or without the olives.  And I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  Thanks! I will be making it again tomorrow for a football party.

We made this for a game night with our friends and everyone really liked it. When I found the recipe, I was hoping it was more of a bean dip than a cheese dip but it was still really good as is. Next time I will try adding another can of beans just to see how I like that.
