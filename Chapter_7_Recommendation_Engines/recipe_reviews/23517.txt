The time to prepare this is definitely too long.  I cut down the time by adding 1 cup of uncooked rice to the mixture after the soup, water, & cheese were added.  I then covered and simered for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, the consistency was perfect for stuffing the peppers.  I also added a 16 oz can of cut-up tomatoes to the bottom of the baking pan and placed the stuffed peppers on top, sprinkled the remaining cheese over all, and sprinkled croutons over everything. These changes cut the cooking time by an hour.

Recipe turned out great. I won't use minute rice so I used half a pound of ground beef half a pound of ground pork browned them and the chopped onion in a large frying pan with a lid. When that was finished browning I added 2 cups of raw long grain white rice and the rest of the ingredients brought it to a boil reduced heat to medium low and let it simmer for a half hour until the rice was cooked. Then I stuff the peppers raw, baked them for half an hour added the cheese on top stuck them back under the broiler until cheese bubbled. Only one pan to clean up and all the flavors blended well.

Really good, but I did make a few changes. Red peppers were on sale, so that was a no brainer. Instead of cutting the tops off the peppers like I normally do, I sliced them in half lengthwise. Boiling the peppers isn't necessary, so I skipped that part and just added some water to the bottom of the pan before it was ready to be baked. I used tomato sauce in lieu of the soup, replaced the rice with couscous and then topped the peppers with shredded Pepper Jack cheese. The family really enjoyed the fact that the recipe called for sausage (although I used turkey sausage) instead of beef. Thanks Nancie!

I rated this recipe a 4 just because I changed it a little as others advised. This was my first stuffed pepper encounter and it was a great one! I was able to shorten the time it took by about half by not boiling the peppers. For the meat, I used a chicken sausage that had been stuffed with red peppers. See the irony? Oh yes my friends. Peppers, inside of chicken, inside of peppers. Now if only I could fit the stuffed peppers into the cavity of a roast chicken, my life would be complete.

I like this recipe, but I will keep searching for a better stuffed peppers recipe.  It's outstanding, particularly when we look at the simple and easy ingredients.  As others have said, I would like to repeat emphatically:  DON'T BOIL THE PEPPERS.  3 of 6 peppers cracked as I attempted to remove them from the pot to the baking pan, despite being extremely careful.  No wonder.  They were so mushy and weak that it's amazing they all didn't split.  I should have listened to cwillisf, another reviewer.  I did increase the ingredients by .5 to insure that I would have enough stuffing.  It was nice to have the extra stuffing to spoon over the peppers, especially since three of them capsized from being split.  Because half of the peppers ended up flat, this looked more like a casserole than traditional stuffed peppers.  But on taste, this is a good dish.  I will try it again someday.  And by the way, since we aren't meshing a complex blend of spices, the stuffing mixture does not need to cook for more than a few minutes--in my opinion--just enough for the cheese to melt properly.

1st attempt at making stuffed peppers. They came out great! Only difference was I ommitted boiling the peppers prior to placing them in the oven. I scaled the recipe down to 4 and had lots left over. Will you remainder for burritos tonight. Perfect.  SIDE NOTE: I HAVE SINCE MADE THIS RECIPE SEVERAL TIMES AND NO LONGER USE IT FOR STUFFED PEPPERS. MAKE BURRITOS OUT OF THEM EVERY TIME. SO GOOD!

Excellent recipe--great taste, but I believe that three cups COOKED instant rice was intended.  My filling had alot of rice and not much of anything else.  I will try the recipe again with the small change, and I will add a can of chopped tomatoes, drained.

I used marinara sauce rather than tomato soup. I used some leftover brown rice instead of instant. Oh and I subbed the pork sausage with a homemade low-fat chicken sausage. Omitted cheese :(  I got the calorie content down to about 200-much better than 800! post holiday dieting ;-)

The stuffing is really good.  Makes an excellent buritto mix as well, just as add lectuce.  I made the mix with the plan of six large peppers which I had, I ended using about 3/4 of it.

For the peppers aspect, DO NOT BOIL the peppers unless you like them mushy and tasteless.  

To cut down on the cooking time add less water to the mix when you add the tomato soup, I would suggest cutting it down to half the recommended amount.

I love this recipe!!  I just had my fourth pepper in a week! I didn't boil the green peppers (that would overcook the peppers and cook a lot of the nutrients out) and I also only simmered the filling for about 5 minutes.  I cut the tops off the peppers and chopped up the tops and added them to the filling which made it more hearty.  I used Heinz tomato soup (I can't find it in the US but it's available in Canada) because it is SO much better than Campbell's!  I also used brown rice.  I didn't add in salt or anything since the soup made it salty enough.  I put the filling into the raw peppers and baked them at about 375 or 400 for about 40 minutes (about 50 if I stuffed the peppers a few days ahead of time since the stuffing would need the extra time to heat up after being in the fridge).  I loved the chili powder and garlic powder and the sausage gave the filling a nice twist instead of using the usual ground beef.  The cheese inside the filling was also a nice hidden touch.  I used mozzarella and topped the peppers off with just a little.  Anyway, this recipe is so good and I'm a tougher rater (3 stars = good).  Thanks for the recipe and I hope others will enjoy this recipe as much as I do!

Best stuffed peppers Ive ever had........I use hamburg instead of sausage and orange peppers instead of green because they are sweeter....that is just my preference but Im sure its scrumptious the way the recipe states!!!  LOVE the tomato soup idea...never thought of it before, and the cheese I cut in half to lighten it a little....It came out so tasty and hearty...GREAT meal, and a great twist to spice up the flavors of boring regular stuffed peppers...but not so much that it overly alters this traditional meal. THANKS FOR POSTING....Will be making this way from now on.....VERY GOOD

Yummy!  I read some of the other reviews and modified the original recipe.  I did NOT boil the peppers at all, just used the raw halves - I used yellow and orange bell peppers.  I used most of a jar of marinara spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato soup.  I just used the leftover half of a large onion I had sitting around.  Also, I added 2 cups of white rice with the liquid after browning the meat and onion, brought it to a boil, and simmered for half an hour, which worked fine (the rice was just a tiny bit on the crunchy side though, so maybe I should have let it sit a little longer).  I simmered for half an hour, then stuffed the peppers.  Also, I didn't add extra cheese on top of the peppers at the end; the stuffing was already so cheesy that I didn't think it needed it.

NO short cuts here folks. This is a great recipe but you DO have to blanch the peppers. I read reviews who said the peppers split on them, and reviews where they omitted blanching because of it. The reason the peppers split on those folks is because they lost track of time and let them boil to long. The added bonus is if you then shock them in cold water, you can peel them. I attemted to omit the blanch step as well and the peppers were raw. I corrected the problem with alot of extra effort. I didn't want to bake x2 to soften the peppers in the oven. This is a great recipe if you pay attention to the peppers and the time, in the blanch process. NO SHORTCUTS!

The best stuffed pepper ever!  Changed a couple items due to what was in my fridge: Used chopped green onions instead of large onion.  Used 1 can tomato paste and 1 can diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup.  Texture of peppers was perfect, and tastes blended together wonderfully!  Amazing dish!!!

For having such basic ingredients this recipe is really packed with favor. The combination of the garlic and chili powder with the sweetness of the green peppers is terrific. Also the sausage gives the filling extra pizazz! I actually did half ground beef, half sausage. I did not precook the peppers just covered the dish for 30 mins in oven, after 30 mins simmer time on stovetop. The last 15 in oven I left the dish uncovered and the cheese and pepper edges browned nicely. Very tender.When I reheated this at work everyone wanted a taste. They were not disappointed. I will definitely make again and good tip to use leftovers as burrito filling. Delicious!

Add cooked bacon to this recipe - it adds so much flavor. And don't skimp on the cooking time. The time simmering really incorporates all of the flavors. But no need to boil peppers before hand. This is my family's favorite recipe!

This recipe is very tasty.  I read the reviews and decided my first go I would stick to the recipe.  I now can say...DON'T BOIL THE PEPPERS!!!  I had issues with them collapsing but luckily ended up with only one splitting.  I reduced the recipe to yield 4 (since there is only 2 of us) and I still had loads of extra stuffing.  I put it in a little casserole dish and heated it up the following night for burrito filling..yummy!!!!  I will definitely be making this one again and again!

Okay these peppers were awesome! Hats off to the poster of this recipe, because they have a winner! My whole family loved them and agreed to the 5 stars. They were very easy to make, but give yourself time to prep and cook. 
Some minor modifications to the recipe I made: 
-I used orange peppers; they are sweet and complement the flavors of sweet sausage well
-I did not boil the peppers before hand, but after halving them and cleaning out the seeds, I microwaved all halves 4 minutes to dry and soften them. 
-6 cups of cooked rice is a lot, you only need 3 cups of cooked rice for the 6 peppers (use Carolina rice and if you need more servings make more rice)
-I made the sausage mixture as is, but did not add the water, cutting the cooking time by 30 minutes
-When the rice and sausage mixture are done cooking, combine them and stuff those peppers!
-Put a shallow layer of water on the bottom of the pan before cooking as it will steam soften the peppers and cook at 350 for 55 minutes on the top rack.

Excellent recipe! I did NOT parboil the peppers. I used pre-cooked brown rice and used 1/2 turkey breakfast sausage and 1/2 ground beef. I placed a medium onion and two carrots in the food processor and added to meat while browning. (I have a three year old and need to incorporate as many veggies as possible!) I did not put cheese in the mixture. I only simmered the meat/rice mixture for about ten minutes, while I prepared the peppers. I filled the peppers and placed in baking dish with one can of tomato sauce and one can of hot water. I sealed the dish tightly with heavy aluminum foil and baked at 375F for 50 minutes. I removed the foil, made sure the peppers were cooked, topped with Jack cheese and placed back in the oven for about 10 minutes.  This reminds me of when my departed Mom used to make this...

The recipe, as is, will fill about 20 large bell peppers, not 6.  I recommend decreasing the amount of rice to 1 cup and also the water to 1 cup.  As for the cheese, use 4 ounces in the recipe and about another 2 ounces to top the filling.

As for blanching the bell peppers, it's a bad idea.  Boiling for 15 minutes makes the peppers very soft.  Do it for only 5 minutes or skip this step all together.  The peppers will cook just fine in the oven.

I agree with the other reviewers that the recipe takes way too long.  Simmer only long enough to get the onions tender and meld the flavors, about 15 minutes.

Good flavor, but the cooking directions take way longer than necessary. I can make this in 25 minutes tops. 
1. start rice in rice cooker or on stove - this step takes longest. (Also, reduce rice by half for a more meat rich dish.)
2. add peppers to boiling, lightly salted water for 15 minutes.
3. While they are cooking put sausage and onion in large skillet. Brown the sausage first. Then add diced tomatoes, cheese and spices. (I used mega hot chili powder, but I love super spicy things. Adjust spices to taste. Use italian sausage and spices if you like flavor, but not heat.)
4. Remove peppers from water and set aside - they won't cool too much. Add cooked rice to the sausage mix and stir. 
5. Stuff the peppers. Put cheese on top and put under broiler for 3 minutes to toast it. Done - takes 25 minutes max.

Love this recipe - the stuffing is wonderful.  Only thing is - peppers are too raw if i don't cook them, and when i boiled as directed they were way too mushy - ended up baking them for 10 minutes empty and then filling them - made the texture of the peppers a lot better for me.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so great!  I use turkey sausage to cut back on the fat/cals.  I also like to use a reduced fat cheese.  Turns out beautifully!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I looked at several recipes, but found this one best to my liking.  Like others, I made a few changes, using hamburger instead of sausage, and regular long-grained white rice instead of instant, and no cheese on top.  I added in diced tomatoes, as recommended by one reviewer, but found that it was a bit too tomato-y.  My husband and son loved them, but I am still not completely satisfied that I've found the "stuffed peppers my mom used to make" yet.  I had no problem with the peppers staying firm, and they were completely cooked and tender, but not at all mushy.  I don't believe I left the peppers in the hot water as long as recommended. I had more filling than necessary, but ended up just putting it around the peppers in the baking dish, so nothing was wasted.  I think this recipe lends itself well to customizing, and I'll make it again, still trying to get to figure out "how did Mom do it?"

These were very good, although I did change quite a few things. First, I took other reviewer's advise and didn't boil the peppers. I halved the recipe but used a whole tube of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage (we like it hot). I simmered everything for an hour but then put brown rice straight into the mixture with some extra water and simmered for about fifteen minutes. Instead of leaving the peppers whole, I decided to cut them in half, which made them eaisier to stuff as well as eat. Then I baked them for 45 minutes. Seeings I have never attempted to cook Stuffed Peppers, I have got to say, they turned out real well thanks to this recipe.

This recipe turned out really good. I didn't boil the peppers first, however. I stuffed them and baked them at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Rather than using sausage, I used ground beef. Couldn't have turned out any better!

Good recipe. Used mexican rice instead and it turned out great. Had extra left over because I only had 3 peppers but ate it the next day as a burrito and it was great.

This recipe is the perfect base when one wants to vary for their own family specialties.  I don't pre-cook the peppers; prefer firm to soft. and for a bit more bite I add one cup of sauerkraut to the mix.  As always cover with a nice sharp cheese.

I made this last night and my husband and I LOVED it! The only alterations that I made was I used half ground beef and half sausage. I used yellow rice instead of white rice and added a bit more rice to the mixture because it seemed kind of soupy. Not sure if that is because I used a different kind of rice? In any event, I will make this again and again! I did have leftover stuffing mixture so I decided to freeze it and use it again next time. Thanks!

I actually did not boil these peppers, but I don't think I put in enough liquid when I cooked these puppies.  However, the filling was pretty good.  Even though they did not come out they way I want them, I was able to cut them and stir them in some leftover atuffing and use it for burritos, like another user.

The filling in this recipe is SO good, I really could eat it by itself and be happy.  I did boil the peppers in 2 batches for about 5 minutes while I was cooking the filling, and I used brown rice and low-fat sausage with great results.  It does take a long time to make--I didn't check that before I started and wasn't planning on waiting so long to eat!  Fantastic recipe, though; I will DEFINITELY make this one again.

I really liked the flavor of these. When I've made other stuffed pepper recipes in the past I've always been disappointed that they seem to lose the flavor during baking. This recipe held the flavor very well. I used Jimmy Dean spicy sausage (which was much better than traditional beef) and i used a favorite local hot pepper cheese instead of cheddar. Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. It was awesome. The stuffing is great all by itself, which is good because it was way more than enough for 6 peppers. (I'll use 8 next time.)

If you actually follow the recipe as it is posted, they come out perfect.  That is my photo, of course they crack a bit at the top, but the rest of the pepper was fully in tact.  Don't over boil them is about all I can say. They looked fantasic and tasted even better!!! Enjoy!

this is a favorite for my husband and me, the kids just eat the filling...I made the following changes...I didn't boil the peppers, I used half sausage and half hamburger and one can of tomatoe soup than filled the empty can half full of bbq sauce, I didn't have instant rice so I just made regular rice and added it to the beef mixture after the simmering, also didn't use a pound of cheese just covered the top of the peppers with cheese at the very end

These were very tasty. I didn't add any chili powder because I did not have any but they were really good just the same. I used hot Italian sausage and it gave it the right kick. My family preferred these sausage stuffed peppers over the classic ground beef stuffed. I think I do too.

This recipe is a WINNER!  I used red and yellow bell peppers because that's what I had on hand.  I DID NOT boil them first.  I used regular, long-grain-rice to equal 3 cups, again, because it is what I had on hand.  Even though I had enough tomato soup for the recipe, I chose to use up some leftover fire-roasted tomatoes that I had.  I simply put those, un drained, into a measuring cup and made up  the rest of the liquid with the tomato soup. The only ground sausage I had was Italian, so I used that.  I did put in the chili powder, but I added in a TBSP of Italian seasoning and I used mozzarella cheese to compliment the Italian sausage. PLUS, it was what I had on hand and I had actually misread the recipe thinking Italian sausage was one of the ingredients needed. It turned out AMAZING!  My husband loved it.   I will DEFINITELY make it as written next time when I can have all of the items listed.  I KNOW it will be another hit!  I actually can't wait to make this one again! I don't like making a recipe that has been altered and then rating it.  But I KNOW food; AND ingredients.  This is a winner made as it is written for sure!  Go ahead and make it, you won't be sorry.

This was delicious!  Even my daughter - who doesn't like rice or peppers - loved it.  I was lazy and chopped up the peppers to turn it into a casserole.  I also used half mild Italian sausage and half ground beef, but added a Tbsp of red pepper flakes.  Finally, I used Parmesan and shredded smoked gouda, because they're my favorite cheeses.  I'll be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe!!! I really enjoyed the use of the soup considering I've always used tomato sauce/paste in the past.  I used a box of Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup and it was very tasty.  I also used ground beef (just a matter of personal preference), but I'm sure it would be equally as good if made with sausage or even a meatloaf mix trio of beef/veal/pork.  I also used a variety of colorful bell peppers - green, red, orange, and yellow.  I received compliments from everyone who tried the dish.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing :)

Wasn't bad, but was pretty bland. I would add some crushed tomato or something if I made it again.

Well, made this tonight, great recipe.  The family enjoyed even the picky eater.  I did read some reviews, and did not par-boil the peppers.  I did add fresh garlic and onions, salt and pepper. Made rice ahead of time but really did not need to.  This recipe is now in monthly rotation. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe and did my best to make it healthy. I made brown rice and  substituted ground turkey.  I also used parmigiana instead of the cheese.  I had some left over sauce in the refrigerator which I added to a can of soup.  No need to boil the peppers.  Delicious!

Good recipe.  I modified it.  Don't cook the rice and don't boil the peppers, and that reduces the time. Also sliced the peppers lengthwise, since they are easier to eat that way.   I used a turkey sausage mixture to reduce the fat.  Very enjoyable.

Really good starting recipe; all the ingredients are there, only changes for time & personal taste!

I used ground beef instead of sausage, did NOT boil/cook the peppers pre-oven, did not mix in cheese, used left-over rice --- cooked at 350 for only 30 min --- turned out great! Whole fam liked it, including picky husband & picky 7 year old! Will certainly make again!

took a long time to make, longer than an hour an a half. Good but the peppers turned out a little soggy. Next time, might use italian sausage and/or hot chili powder.

great recipe. gotta be honest, I tweaked alot of it, but as far as the bones of the operation,, this is good! I DID blanche my peppers! I used ground turkey, brown minute rice and a jar spaghetti sauce. this cut about an hour and 15 minutes out of the cooking time.

Omgoodness...I tried this recipe for my 1st time at making Stuffed peppers.  I too changed the recipe a bit...No I did not boil the peppers.  I used 1/2 lb turky burger and 1/2 lb turkey sausage.  Added onions and spices to taste...but I also used 1 small can of mushrooms. Once the meat mixture was cooked I added 2 small cans of tomoatoe sauce and 1 can of ROTEL...that kicked it up a notch. 2 small cans of water ad 1 cup uncooked instant rice.  covered for 20 mins or so until rice was cooked.  Since I had so much stuffing, I took a tortilla and layerd the bottom of my pan and then took the meat/rice mix and added a thin layer to the tortillas and added cheese on top of that.  Then put the stuffed peppers on top of the meat/cheese layer. The meat/rice mix was delish...Cant wait for the peppers to come out of the oven, cause I know it will be awesome.  Of course this gave me another idea, take the meat/rice mix and layer tortillas/meatnrice/cheese in a casserole dish and now you have a whole new dish...love it.

lots of the stuffing leftover which was fine by me.  Great flavor by using tomato soup, but it took way to long to cook everything so if you dont have the time, I would suggest a different recipe. But did come out very tasty.

TIP: Instead of boiling the peppers I prep them as stated and then put them in a one gallon sized zip lock bag with a little bit of water. Almost seal them completely, leave a little crack open for steam to escape. Give them room, two to three per bag. Microwave them for five minutes. Caution they will be very hot!    We all enjoyed this pepper recipe.Next time... I would pick up on seasonings, my favorite herbs. Top with parmesan cheese, maybe even stuff a chunk of cheddar,goat or jack cheese in the center with the stuffing enveloping it.

Great recipe, first time Ive ever made them. Glad I read the reviews though, saved some time. Like adding the rice with the mix uncooked & not using so much. I used 1 & 1/2 cups uncooked rice. And I made 8 peppers, and had plenty. And only simmered the mix for 30 mins.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I did change it slightly.  Instead of using tomatoe soup, I used two freshed tomatoes, which I blanched and put in an ice bath to remove the skins.  I diced the tomatoes and removed the seeds.  I also used ground pork instead of sausage [cheaper], and when I finished browning it with the chopped onion I added the tomatoes as well as a 1/4 cup of ketchup for colour.  I really enjoyed making this recipe and in addition made a vegetarian one for my dad with Yves soy ground beef.  It also turned out really well.  Over all a great recipe, but a bit time consuming.

Not bad.  I appreciated the suggestions to cut down cooking time, and using spicy Italian sausage gave it a little kick.  It has more of a Mexican flavor thanks to the chili powder, so I almost wished I had used chorizo instead.  I also agree that this could be great in burritos!

I've made these a lot, but always vegetarian-style: have tried with tofu, vegetarian meatballs (yep!) and vegetarian "ground beef".  It's great stuff, and one of those recipes that's great to improvise and edit as needed.

great recipe. I made this for a gathering because there were some vegetarians coming. I used a italian flavoured tofu-ground beef substitute and it was phenomenal. I also used both red and green peppers for some color and variety. Would definatly do it again!

Very good.  Things i did differently was use instant brown rice, canned whole tomatos broken into chunks, spicy italian sausage, and no seasonings (the sausage was enough).  My fiance loved it!

We've become pretty big fans of stuffed peppers, and this is a decent reciepe to use.  Though we usually substitute the sausage for beef, because I like it better.  This is a good, classic reciepe though, and I highly recommend it as a starting point if you're in for some nice stuffed peppers.
We also don't boil our peppers before we bake them.  It seemed like an unnecessary step that didn't do much for the peppers.

These were good!!  I have to say I agree with some of the others that the meat/rice mixture does not need to be cooked as long as the recipes says.  I just boiled the peppers, stuffed them, and put them under the broiler for a few min. to get the cheese all crusty and bubbly. I'll make these again!!

Definitely will make again! Yes, I made a few changes just to save time, such as I used 2 Knorr's Mexican flavored rice pouches, I did not cook the peppers first,  I added red pepper flakes to the sausage mix, added the rice to the sausage mix after draining the sausage/onions. I used mostly red peppers and 2 orange peppers. I did not simmer everything for 1 hr., maybe 20 mins. especially since everything would bake for 30 mins. in the oven.  I also sliced a small amount off the bottom of the peppers so they would stand up.

I only had three bell peppers so I cut the recipe in half then added extra chopped garlic to the meat mixture.  I used Success rice instead of minute rice which I cooked separately then added the meat mixture.  I added the left over meat/rice mixture to the space left in the pan and WALAHHH

I rated this a four as it takes a long time to prepare.  I always make one major change when a recipe suggests tomatoes or tomato soup, etc.  I used mild salsa instead since my family as a whole, does not like tomatoes.   Salsa is a lot less acidic.

I also doctored the stuffing a bit as have many others.  It is a good basic recipe from which any cook can make easy and reasonable modifications.

I blanced the peppers as directed for 15 minutes and this really should direct to blanch for 5 minutes.   My peppers were splitting and really not worth stuffing.....so I chopped them up and put them in the rice and tomato soup mixture and served this as stuffed pepper stew.   It was delicious.  And other reviewers are right, it would be a fabulous burrito!!

Don’t boil the peppers! Totally not necessary. I add a small can of tomato paste and double the chili powder.

I felt the rice to meat ratio was too high. I added a can of tomatoe paste to the meat mixture and added a 15 oz can of tomatoe sauce to the top before topping with cheese and baking. It had a great taste and we all enjoyed it. 
Next time I'll reduce rice.

Although the cook time for this dish is quite a commitment, it's worth the wait!  I like veggies with some crunch to them, so I didn't boil my bell peppers.  For the stuffing, I used roasted garlic tomato sauce instead of the soup.  I substituted shallots instead of the red onion and sauteed them in red wine instead of oil.  I also added fresh chopped cilantro, oregano and Italian parsley while it was simmering.  I used some leftover cooked rice (with lime butter and cilantro in it) instead of the instant rice.  On the whole, this was a delicious recipe with a crazy depth of flavor. I will absolutely make it again!

Really a great recipe.  I did cut the rice down to a cup and a half, cut down the cooking time by adding water as it cooked (about a cup I believe).  Also, we used red & green peppers, green peppers shouldn't be boiled for 15 min tho the red will stand after 15.  I'd recommend 5 min for green peppers.  I also used half pound Italian, half pound breakfast sausage. I've always diced the tops of the peppers to add to the mix and this time in particular, had some mushrooms lying around and they made a wonderful addition.  Tweaked just a bit and this recipe is the best stuffed peppers recipe by far.

I think the recipe is great alone, but I added more Spanish flare with Goya yellow rice, black beans, and topped with Colby Jack and sour cream. I made a mistake that turned out great! I used Annie's organic tomato soup and saw that it wasn't concentrated. ....so I omitted the water.  I was able to fill 8 organic red and green peppers and still had leftovers for tortilla chip dipping. I blanched the peppers for 3 min.! They were perfect. Oh, and I didn't simmer for an hour.

I made this twice. First time I followed directions to a tee, but replaced the Italian sausage with breakfast sausage because of the limitations of what I had in my fridge at the time. Everything turned out great. The second time, I went rogue. Followed most of the ingredients, but added extra spice and a healthy supply of hot sauce for an extra kick. Tossed the main ingredients  in the crock pot on low for six hours to cut down on active preparation time. Still boiled the peppers and then baked at the end, but the slow cooker seemed to cut down on the long preparation time and made the experience a little more leisurely. The extra spice was also a big hit.

There is way too much stuffing in this recipe for 6 bell peppers no matter how big they are.  Instant rice is also a bad idea as it blands down the entire recipe.  Definitely consider adding a few extra ingredients to spice this dish up.

Delicious!  What I changed: substituted one can of tomato sauce with about the same measurement of mild, chunky salsa (I put a tad more) and rather than boiling the peppers pre-bake I cut and filled them with the sausage mixture and put water about half way up the baking dish and cooked at 400 for 35 minutes. Crispier, yet cooked peppers. Just be careful getting the water filled dish to the oven. No waterlogged peppers!  I also didn't let the sausage and rice simmer for an hour. I let it simmer for about 15 minutes and it's turned out quite nice.

Yummy! This was really good! I was very nervous to make this for my picky husband... But he was pleseantly surprised. I added a little kick by using jalapeno seasoning in the meat. Even my two-year-old gobbled this up! I would actually make the stuffing again before I did it in the pepper. We ate it seperately and liked it better.

Absolutely wonderful as written. The slight changes you can make won't alter the dish that much from the original. (example- using a different cheese or brown rice) I personally like red peppers better than green, but overall-this is the recipe my family requests time and again! Thank you for sharing it!

Fine stuffed peppers, these. I used two cups of rice in a rice cooker and fresh tomatoes instead of tomato soup, sauce or paste, and -- just before stuffing time -- microwaved the six hollowed peppers for 3-1/2 minutes.  No cracking.  After stuffing, regular oven for 15 min., take out to cheese the tops, then back in on broil for three or four minutes. Five-star tastiness!

Because this recipe as written takes a long time, I browned the sausage, added the soup, cooked through, cooked the rice in the microwave, added it and then put it all in the oven.  Turned out just fine, with no simmering for an hour or half an hour at all.

They were great!  I didn't need to simmer for as long as it says, and they still came out fine.  I agree that a little extra chili powder will help give it a kick :)

I only had small green peppers (very hard to "stuff"!) available because we live overseas, so I sliced the peppers, poured the rice mixture over the peppers and baked it in a Pyrex dish.  Good with the tomato soup as the tomato base, but slightly bland.  Perhaps if I had added some chili powder it may have given it more of the "kick" we were looking for.  Good despite!

ok, these tasted sooo good. but! the 15 minutes in the boiling water made my peppers way to soggy instead of crispy. also, stuffed peppers are suppost to be a quick meal, why in the world did it take almost 2 hours to make these??? thats the only reason im not giving it a 5 stars! i probubly wont make these again simply bc of the amount of time it took to make them.

Excellent recipe.  Excellent for stuffed peppers and even better for enchiladas!  I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic with the sausage and substituted tomato sauce for the soup.  Decreased the water to 2 cups and added some fresh diced tomatoes.  Great base recipe.  Quick and easy!

Used ground beef instead of sausage. Used brown rice instead of white rice. Added creole seasoning, and cut them in half rather than topped them. Froze the leftovers. Loved it, will make again.   It's about 3 months later and I took a couple of the peppers out of the freezer. They were even better than when I first cooked them.

This was a big hit with my husband.  I used Bob Evans hot spicy sausage and changed none of the ingredients. My peppers had gone from green to red, so I skipped cooking the peppers before I stuffed them.  They had the same tender/crispy texture of a stir fry.  There was a ton of extra filling left over, so the following night I used it in burritos.  Cooking once and eating twice fits my lifestyle.  This is a keeper!

I liked this recipe, but made a few changes.I used a 1/2 lb of lean ground beef and a 1/2 ab of chorizo sausage, I used 1 cup of cooked basamati rice,green onion,1-10oz can of tomato soup and 1cup of hunts spicy tomato sauce,and threw crumpled in some blue cheese instead of chedder, for spices I used Mrs  Dash spicy blend , fresh garlic, fresh ground pepper. I omitted the water and used some tomato juice instead. If you find its not thick enough you can use pureed tomatoes or tomato paste, or some more thick and chunky tomato sauce but play around with the ingredients like I did and you will have a recipe you'll want to keep for a long time if you like blue cheese and with the leftover mixture I saved it and made a cabbage caserole with it. Hope it turns out for you all.

I turned this into a healthy recipe by making brown rice, using about a 1/4 of the cheese, and I used vegetarian ground beef in place of the sausage. I did not boil the peppers, as recommended in many reviews. The peppers came out crispy, which is good because more vitamins are retained, but I think I would have liked the taste better if the peppers were soft (as I remember stuffed peppers to be). I sautéed 1/2 onion and 3 cloves of garlic before I added the other ingredients (tomato soup, water, seasonings). After 30 minutes, the mixture was thick and I added the brown rice. I did continue cooking the rice for the additional 30 minutes. I also poured a can of diced tomatoes over the top before baking. The recipe took 1.5 hours from start to finish. Next time I would use a marinara sauce in place of the tomato soup. I’ll try covering the peppers with tin foil to see if they steam a little.

I made this with Ground beef. It needed more seasoning, so I added some Tony's Creole season to taste. I didn't simmer any of it as long as it asked- 30 mins here and there, were substantially reduced- and it still turned out great!

Excellent with a few changes. To cut back a little on the fat I used 1 lb of ground pork and 1 lb of ground beef and used low fat sharp cheddar. I also cut back the rice to 2 cups. This still made 6 large stuffed peppers that my husband and I loved. Next time I will blend 1 large can tomato sauce with the tomato soup and put some aside so I can have extra sauce to pour over the tops before adding cheese and baking. Good recipe...it's a keeper!!!

Was very good. Used to much rice in my mixture, and also used colored peppers, recipe was very tasty. Next time I will not use 2 cups of regular rice.

I'm only giving it a 4 because the filling was good.  Others say not to boil the peppers, but I think you should.  If your only making for 2 people you can almost cut the recipe in half.

One of our favorites! Cut the sauce part in half, but still add the same amount of sausage.

My husband is on a low-carb diet.  o I took this recipe and reduced it to 2 servings. I then used 1/2 lb. ground sausage + 1/2 ground beef and omitted the rice.  My husband, who is a very busy restaurant manager, made the time to call home and RAVE about this phenomenal recipe.  THANKS SO MUCH NANCIE!!!!  You are helping me to score points in the low-carb kitchen.  :)

Really yummy! I've never had stuffed peppers before, so this was a good one to try. I grilled my peppers instead of steaming them. SO GOOD!

I replaced the tomato soup with tomato sauce, and the peppers came out delicious!  Definitely a great recipe, although it does not need to be cooked so long over the stovetop.

These were very good.  Could use some more seasonings.
