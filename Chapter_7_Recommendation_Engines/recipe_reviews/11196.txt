These go quicker if you roll 1/3 of the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap, then just spread the suger over both sides of the sticky dough before cutting out. You can only roll once, but as with any pastry, the more you roll the worse it gets. Also try taping 3-4 forks together separated by skewers. Then you only have to tap each cookie once! I've made 300+ of these before, and these were real time savers!

They take a little time but are worth the effort.  Instead of making a fork prick square on each cookie I found it easier to make three fork pricks in a row.  When I did the square sometimes the dough would break before I could get it to the baking sheet.

I've know these cookies to be called CREME WAFFERS because they melt in your MOUTH.. and they get better each day!!!  These are a must have every holiday season.  I double the recipe and match two batches.. One to give as treats and one to keep as the whole family simply devours these cookies up.  Some tips... This recipe seems like to fly by if you have a partner helping you.  Also the tip with taping 4 forks together is a HUGE time saver with pricking your dough.  Also they need to be only lightly golden.   They are extremely fragile but that is the joy in them.. melting in your mouth!!! When it comes to frosting them... I used the buttercream frosting   recipe halfed it and made green frosting and red frosting as well as some white.  But use your imagination and use jelly as somebody else suggested or even a lemon filling would be awesome!!

I got compliments on these shortbread type cookies. Some tips: don't try to do elaborate cookie cutter shapes as these cookies are too crumbly. Also, make sure they're a nice golden brown before you take them out of the oven--they need more baking than just waiting until they're puffed up.

These cookies are cute but just way too buttery for me. I kept mine refrigerated because of the raw egg yolk in the filling...so that may be why they seemed so greasy.

I made a batch of these today, exactly as written, and they are exquisite little bites.  I didn't have a small round cookie cutter, so I used a plastic medicine cup that came with my kids' cough medicine.  It was the perfect size to make a 1-2 bite cookie.  Whoever said "melt in your mouth" wasn't kidding.  Delicious little bite...and not just your average Christmas cookie like everyone else is baking and sharing.  Thanks for this recipe!

Simply Addictive.  We did cookie baskets for Xmas this year and this was a hit.  Had husbands and wifes ticked off that one or the other ate more than their share of this cookie.  We stuffed them with the cream provided.  Added Cocoa and chocolate to a bit of it for some and strawberry jam for others.  YUM!

Sorry, but we didn't like these very much.  They were very easy to make - a little time consuming with the chilling, rolling, cutting and dredging with sugar, but that's just par for the course.  I did like the crumbly texture of these cookies.  They are a delicate cookie, but I didn't have a problem with them being too crumbly to handle as some people have had.  It feels strange saying this as most people seemed to have the opposite opinion, but we found these cookies to be very sweet.  I know there is no sugar in the recipe, but the sugar on the outside and the sweet frosting definitely compensated for that.  I might make these again if someone asks for them, but I won't be making them regularly.  Sorry, but they didn't impress me...

This is one of the 7 types of cookies we make for Yule, according to Norwegian tradition, and the favorite of everyone in my Family. Tiny, delicate, and they melt in your mouth...YUM. And so pretty. We tint the frosting a light pink and they are the first to disappear from our cookie platter. Great recipe!!

These are a must-make cookie every Christmas.  I started making these for my brothers when we were all still at home and now that we're all on our own they won't spend Christmas at my house unless I promise to make a batch of these.

These cookies taste great, but I too had a problem with them sticking to the pan. They crumble so easy it was hard to ice them. I will just have to pratice thats all!!

Great recipe!  I did them with heart shape cookie cutters and tinted pink frosting.  The only troubles I had were in getting them off my cookie sheet and working with really wet dough.  Next time I might add a bit more flour.  As for the cookie sheet problem, I just made sure I didn't over bake the second batch and removed them from the cookie sheet quickly after pulling them out of the oven.

I had this cookie years ago at a wedding and  searched for the recipe...and finally found it here!  This is a perfect cookie for a tea party or shower.

These were such a huge hit at work and at home.  They're absolutely scrumptious!  I did find that the middles firm up nicely if you put them in the fridge for a while before serving.
