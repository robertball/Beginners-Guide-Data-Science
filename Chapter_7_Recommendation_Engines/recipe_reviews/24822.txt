This is the best chicken salad I’ve ever eaten with a couple adjustments. I made it a couple of years ago for a birthday brunch for my mother, and people still ask me for the recipe! It’s wonderful as is, but since I like to throw it together fairly often, sometimes I don’t always have all the ingredients. I omit the Swiss and the chestnuts sometimes, and I do vary the fruit a bit. I like to use red and green grapes, just for a little color variation. I’ve also added diced green apple with scrumptious results. If you don’t like mayo (like me) a nice light variation is to use half Miracle Whip and half sour cream or plain yogurt. There is so much flavor with the fruit and veggies, the dressing doesn’t need to be so mayo-y. This is amazing just plain, or on a toasted bagel or croissant. Once you try this one, no other chicken salad will suffice!

All the ingredients are just right. I would change only the prep by adding the lemon juice, pepper, onion and garlic powders to the chicken before anything else. Let that soak for 10 minutes, then add the rest. In any case, great recipe.

I made this recipe for a baby shower that I hosted, and everyone raved about it.  I left out the grapes because I was serving it on croissants.  The twenty minute prep time is just plain wrong, but it was worth the time spent preparing the dish.  I will make it again, and I have to send the recipe to several people who attended.

This chicken salad was delicious, unusual but delicious.  Please ignore anyone telling you to cut the poultry seasoning.  The dry recipe amounts called for are perfect.  The only thing I think you need more off is mayo.  Just add it at the end to adjust the salad to your creaminess preference.  Other than the mayo I followed the recipe exactly & I have added this to my permanent recipe book.

I liked this recipe with a couple of modifications: The celery and the water chestnuts made this a little too crunchy for me. I will leave out the water chestnuts next time. I'm not sure the cheese is necessary. You could probably cut it in half or drop it all together.

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday party (we had about 50 adults) and scaled it to 30. So it took a long time to cook the chicken and cut the grapes & chicken, but it was well worth it.  I shredded the swiss cheese by accident (didn't read the directions) but it was actually better than I think diced would've been. Everyone LOVED it and I sent the recipe to all via email afterwards. I will definitely be adding this to my "party" menu.

We loved this chicken salad. So tasty!!! I did omit the water chestnust and added walnuts like others suggested also used chunky apple sauce instead of the apples that I was going to use because it seemed to dry if you wanted to put it on a sandwich and I didnt want to over load it with more Mayo (my husbands suggestion and right on). Delish!!! The more I make this the more I get asked for the recipe! So yummy!

Delicious.  Omitted the swiss and the grapes and added 1/2 cup toasted pecan pieces. All my guests requested the recipe.  Used my Pampered Chef food chopper and prep time was much faster.

I am always in search of "The Best" chicken salad recipes since it's my favorite lunchtime meal. This is a 5 star recipe. My husband is yhe food&beverage manager at our local golf and country club. Can't wait for him to try it there!
I didn't have water chestnuts, poultry seasoning, nor grapes. Still, it turned out to be wonderful!

This recipe tastes wonderful!...I can't wait to take it to work tommorrow. I agree that the 20 minutes is a little far fetched with all the chopping that is involved. But I judge a recipe mostly on taste, and this one was well worth the wait.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe-I did use only 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning but I think the full amount could have been used.  I also used red grapes instead of green.  I did let the flavors marry in the fridge for 24 hours and the salad was awesome!  Also, I have added dried cranberries and it comes out FANTASTIC!

I tried this recipe on my Home Makers' Club and it was a big hit.  The mixture of flavors is absolutely scrumptious.  However the 20 minute preperation time is a little far fetched.  It took me that long just to cube the cheese and halve the grapes.  But the time it took was really worth the results!  Add it to your recipe box!

I get raves everytime I make this Chicken Salad!!  I have used fresh boiled chicken breasts chopped, or canned chicken breast - both are great.  I leave out the celery, because I don't care for it & I use purple grapes instead of green for some added color.  The water chestnuts and the swiss cheese make it - so don't dare leave those out!  10 STARS to Carol - FABULOUS!

I invite our teachers for lunch once each summer, and this is the recipe they always ask for. I do use less poultry seasoning and no water chestnuts (my own personal preference--- I can't stand them in anything!); but it's a great recipe any way you "slice" it!

People loved it.  They wanted the recipe.  I didn't put in the grapes or nuts because I didn't have any and replaced the swiss cheese with chedder using alittle less than it called for.  I also cooked frech bread and took the middle out of it and stuffed the chicken salad inside it and let it set in the icebox to firm up alittle.  It looked appealing and tasted great!!  Loved it, Thanks!!!

I am somewhat of a chicken salad "snob" and this is fantastic!  Definitely slice the grapes in half to release the juice (I did use red for the color) and make the night before.  It is so moist and delicious!  I served on pitas lined with fresh spinach.

Awesome recipe!! I prefer Miracle Whip/sour cream instead of mayo and pineapple chunks instead of grapes. I also added a little dill which enhances the zip!

Made this yesterday afternoon and voila...was ready for a lite dinner last night.  Didn't have any cheese, but it was great without it.  I would pull back a little bit on the poultry seasoning...I didn't put all it indicated in and it was still a little strong with that flavor.  Otherwise, it is EXCELLENT and EASY (my two favorite things about cooking).  Added pecans instead of water chestnuts and red grapes for great color.  Will make again.

I was so excited to make this recipe, but I turned out to be disappointed. I had tried a chicken salad w/ swiss cheese recipe in a restaurant and I thought this would be good like that, but I was wrong. The poultry seasoning gave the chicken salad an odd taste. If I made this again, I would either omit the poultry seasoning or reduce the amt drastically. It was WAY too overpowering.

This is a really elegant chicken salad.  I liked it for a warm weather dinner.  It makes a LOT though, so if you know you won't eat it all in a couple of meals I would only make half.  Really good flavor with the Swiss and grapes.

I made this for a bridal shower. I'm not wild about mayo, and neither (so they said) were the women at the shower. But this recipe was a huge hit! The spices and the fruit add a complexity of flavor that's really nice. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Ok.  I would leave out or DRAMATICALLY reduce the poultry seasoning.  I dont know, it just gave it a weird taste.  And as you eat it, you try to figure out what that flavor is instead of enjoying all the other flavors.  If I make again, it will be without the poultry seasoning.

This was awesome, especially on a hot summer night when I did not feel like cooking.  I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to make prep easier and I used red grapes because that is what I had in the house.  Delicious!

My husband isn't a fan of fruit in his chicken salad but he LOVES this recipe! My grandma even called to get the recipe after she had it and believe me, her recipe is excellent. I served it with a choice of sourdough or pumpernickel and swiss or pepperjack cheese... SOOOOOOO good!

Great combination of spices for flavor.  For a shortcut on the chicken, I use some grilled chicken breast from KFC.  They are the most flavorful, moist chicken breast you will ever use.

I've made several recipes from this website, but had to join after making this!  I cannot make this and not review it!  BEST MEAL EVER!!!  I didn't have quite a bit of the ingredients on hand, but used what I had instead.  I substituted the swiss for marble cheese chunks.  I didn't have an onion or celery.  I added some mandarin oranges as well.  The combo of salty with sweet was amazing.  I will definitely be making this again with more ingredients.  I think you could change this up to suit your needs, and it'd still be awesome!  A+++.  It's on my list of favourite meals ever!

Really good!  I used about half the water chestnuts and cheese, and topped with some toasted cashews.  Yum!

By far, the best chicken salad recipe i've come across yet. My husband and son loved it and they are very picky eaters! 

I used red grapes instead of green and substituted the chestnuts with pecans. Delicious!

Greatest chicken salad I have ever tasted!  The creamy dressing really has a great flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I added a 1/2 cup of pecan pieces to this which gave it a nice crunch as well as 1/4 t of paprika to give it a little color and extra tang.

This is an excellent recipe with a lot of flavor.  I made it for a playgroup luncheon and it was a hit!  Next time I would slice the grapes smaller.  Otherwise, I thought it was perfect.  Thanks to Carol.

Made the recipe almost exactly like the instructions. I omitted the water chestnuts and boiled the chicken in chicken broth. It was the best chicken salad that my husband and I have ever had and it went over great with my hunt club. I've now started making it almost once a month because I crave it. Very quick and easy too!

Not very good.  This should be called "Carol's Swiss Cheese Salad".  The cheese overwhelms everything else.  In fact, there's such little chicken, you can't even taste it.  IMO, any type of cheese has no place in a chicken salad.  And shouldn't chicken be the main ingredient in a "chicken" salad?

This would be much better by reducing or eliminating the cheese altogether and substituting something that complements the other ingredients such as diced radishes, mild diced onions, more celery, or chopped egg.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was good, but next time, I will definitely reduce the poultry seasoning by half and probably eliminate the water chestnuts altogether. The poultry seasoning was way too pronounced and the chestnuts didn't add anything. I will probably add more mayonnaise too, as the mixture ended up being pretty dry.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had,  I think it's the poultry seasoning that really gives it a wonderful flavor.  I add chopped cashews and crasins to it.  Great on it's own or in buns - Hawaiian bread is great with it, too!

The first time I made this recipe I found the seasoning to be way to strong so I had to add more chicken and mayo but I did really like the flavor (although I omit the celery, nuts, and onions cause I am really picky and it's a texture thing). What I do now is double or triple the seasonings, mix them together really well, and put them into an empty spice/shaker container and label it "Chicken Salad". That way I can add as much as I like and it's ready for the next time I want to whip some up.

Very good!  I left out the water chestnuts and swiss cheese, and it still tasted delicious.  Had it for lunch several days with some tomato on pita bread.  Plan to make this again.

I found this to be a very yummy chicken salad, although I made some changes to make it healthier. First, I cooked the chicken by placing it in a pan of chicken broth, bringing it to a boil, then removing it from the heat and letting it stand for 15 minutes to cook through... tender, flavorful chicken resulted. For the dressing, instead of 1/2 cup of mayo, I used 1/4 c reduced-fat Helmann's mayonnaise and 1/4 c reduced-fat sour cream. I omitted the cheese altogether, as I didn't really feel that was necessary. The result is a 3/4-cup serving with 124 calories, 3.5 grams of fat and less than a gram of fiber (3 Weight Watchers points for anyone interested) which is a much lighter, much healthier version but with all the creamy yumminess. Next time, I will reduce the poultry seasoning from 3/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp, as I found it to be slightly overpowering. All in all, the recipe gave me a great base from which to create a delicious, healthy meal. I'm sure it would taste fabulous the way it was written, but for those of you who are like me, you can't afford 19.5 grams of fat in one serving!

Great recipe, even though I left out a few ingredients because I threw it together at the last minute and didn't have time to run to the store. I'm always in search of ways to use up leftover boiled chicken and I've been looking for the perfect chicken salad recipe.  I chose this one based on the number of positive reviews. I did not have celery, green onion, water chestnuts or swiss cheese, so I just left these out.  I used red grapes instead of green and added some chopped pecans.  After 7 years of marriage, I finally convinced my husband to try chicken salad (he has always maintained that he doesn't like it).  After a few bites of this, he declared it "the best chicken salad I've ever had." And then he proceeded to eat the rest of it.  Even my 2-year-old liked it! Thanks for converting my family to chicken salad lovers!  I can't wait to take this to a potluck.

This is a super recipe.  I've made it several times but not always the same.  If I use the recipe as is, I leave out the swiss cheese from the salad mixture but add the swiss cheese when I use this salad for a chicken melt (alternative to tuna melt).  I also will sometimes omit the poultry seasoning and use yellow curry powder instead.  I also omit the swiss cheese when I make it with curry powder as flavors seem to compete.  This salad is great and we have it a LOT during the summer months.

Everytime I make this recipe everyone raves. I make several changes though. I omit the waterchestnuts and add cubed apple and sliced almonds. I also add 1/4tsp of paprika to the sauce. It is excellent on a scorching hot day, on a fresh baked croissant with a glass of lemonade. Yummy!

This is the best chicken salad I've ever had, and I've made it countless times now for company and potlucks. I bake the chicken coated in Italian dressing until just done, then chill before chopping, for moist chunks.  I add an extra 1/4 cup mayo, and like it with seedless red grapes.  I love it on croissants with lettuce, but often eat it straight from the bowl, too.

This is absolutely the best chicken salad I've ever had! My inlaws sampled it and agreed it was quite delicious.  The chopping is a little time consuming but well worth it.  I cut my grapes in quarters instead of halves and left out the water chestnuts.  Definite keeper!

This chicken salad is so good!  But it does go bad quickly.  I make it for lunchtime potlucks, and it is always a hit! If making it at home, you may want to 1/2 the recipe.  That way there won't be a ton of excess to go bad.

This is delicious.  The only reason it didn't receive 5 stars is b/c my batch was watered down after sitting in the fridge overnight, presumably from the grapes.  However, after letting the flavors sit overnight, it tastes like (a very good) restaurant quality chicken salad!!!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This chicken salad was a big hit with my co-workers and family!  I didn't have water chestnuts, so instead I used walnuts for crunch.  FABULOUS!  I also used red grapes and a sprinkling of tarragon, which really brings out the flavors in this mix.  Try it!!

I think I love Carol.  This is fabulous with rotisserie chicken and as a personal preference, I double the mayo mix.  The water chestnuts add such marvelous texture to this.  I get my swiss cheese at the deli and ask them to slice it 1/4" thick.  Makes cubing a breeze.  I know a pound was too much, probably 5-6 slices would do it (and allow for the mandatory grazing during prep).

Good recipe. Omitted the chestnuts - bf thought grapes in chicken salad was weird enough as it is! Canned white chicken meat works just fine (already salted, but I did add a bit of poultry seasoning to it). Grated the onion for more of its juices as opposed to chopping it. Also, I served it in a Kaiser roll, with the swiss cheese slices over the top of the salad, not diced inside it. yum.

I needed a chicken salad recipe to serve to a large group people.  I saw this one and decided to try it and I had so many compliments and people asking for the recipe.  It turned out great. My only problem was that I had to make more of the dressing because it was too dry at first.  I used red grapes instead of green like some others suggested.  Fantastic!  I will make this again and again!

This was the first chicken salad I've ever made. It was terrific! I'll definitly be making it often. I made it exactly by the recipe (which is unusual for me) and it turned out perfect.

The best chicken salad I have ever had.  I sustituted the water chestnuts for cashews and it was great.  I didn't have onion powder but I don't think that it needed it because of the green onions.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us.

Delicious! I reduced the poultry seasoning a little, as someone else suggested, and added some cashews for some extra crunch - but I think it would have been great as is. I will make this again.

This recipe was fabulous!  Instead of the water chestnuts, I toasted almond pieces, which added a distinct flavor to it.  Halved red/purple grapes are a must.  PS - I don't know if it's because I'm an inexperienced cook, but this recipe did take me longer than the 20 minutes it said.

This is a great chicken salad recipe! I was doubtful even with all the rave reviews but this one is a keeper. I followed directions exactly except I used less poultry seasoning (under 1/2 tsp). It is fabulous on a croissont.

I shared this recipe with my sis-in-law & we are absolutely in love with it.  She makes it at least twice a month.  DOUBLE THE MAYO.  This is even yummy made with leftover oven fried chicken.

Not sure how I feel about this recipe. It’s good, but I think I can find a better one. I will decrease the poultry seasoning in half when and if I make this again. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using green onions and adding chopped walnuts. I served the salad in wheat pita pockets.

We didn't care too much for the STRONG taste of the poultry seasoning.  If you like a very bold tasting chicken salad, you will probably like this recipe.

This recipe is excellent!  I made it for someone who has eaten many versions of gourmet chicken salad and she told me that it was the best chicken salad she has ever eaten.  Don't leave the poultry seasoning out until you've tried the recipe once. It really makes the salad different from others that you've tried! Thanks for sharing Sharon!

I did not like this at all. I didn't dare use poultry seasoning from all the bad reviews it got. I just didn't like it. It tasted more like a chip dip than chicken salad. I prefer the local grocery store's deli version so much better.

What a wonderful chicken salad recipe!  I omitted the poultry seasoning after reading others reviews.  I also subbed the water chestnuts with sliced almonds and left out the cheese to lower the fat content.  I used fat free Miracle Whip instead of the mayo and I also left out the grapes just because I didn't have any, but I will use them the next time.  Served on a crossaint with a side of strawberries.

I would not put ANY poultry seasoning.  It was so overpowering that it completely ruined the entire dish.  The grapes was a nice twist because of the sweet burst of flavor.  But the poultry seasoning made it taste gross and I had to throw out the entire thing.  What a waste of chicken...The recipe has potential, just don't add Poultry Seasoning and if you do, add it little by little and taste it in between, do not add the amount listed in the recipe.

This is my absolute favorite chicken salad recipe. The only changes I make are to omit the cheese (to cut down the fat a little) and use red grapes instead of green (I prefer the extra sweetness of the red grapes). I would have never thought to put water chestnuts in chicken salad, but they really add to the recipe. Thanks!

I agree!  This is a great recipe!  I love the seasonings in the dressing along with the Swiss cheese...delish!  Like many other reviewers, I swapped the waterchestnuts for pecans and the green grapes for red.  The only other change I made was to make the dressing as directed, but then I also made a bit more by making 1/2 the dressing recipe and adding it to the salad.  In my opinion, the salad was just a little too dry, and it's such a tasty dressing that adding a bit more made the salad even better.  Plus, I made it the night before serving it, and the salad stayed moister this way.  Great recipe all around!

By far the best chicken salad recipe out there! I have made it quite a few times and always get rave reviews.   My advice: • Use thigh and breast meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken.  • Make sure the grapes are sweet.  • Finely chop the celery and onion (fresh chives may be subbed for onion)   • Coarsely chop the water chestnuts. • Don’t dice but coarsely grate the Swiss cheese.   Serve this to guests and you will get a lot of requests for the recipe.

This definitely did not meet my expectations.  It was too dry and the poultry seasoning was over bearing.  Won't make this again.

This review is mostly for the dressing - It was the best! I did use another suggestion of half Miracle Whip and half sour cream and doubled the amounts. For the base I used chicken, apples, green onions and water chestnuts. I will make this again - thanks for the recipe.

This was really a good recipe,I only gave it a four because I didn't make it as exactly like the recipe stated. I used sour cream instead of mayo as another reviewer suggested,I put in pecans,didn't use celery (preference),I used a yellow bell pepper,and pepper jack cheese! talk about gooooood! I took it to work with me today for lunch and my parents ate what was left and well,there is none left,surprized? you shouldn't be,it's a good one to make!

The WHOLE family loved it! Because my DD gave such a rave review my DH came home and tried it. He loved it! We did make some adjustments - but that was only based on what we had on hand not because we didn't think the original recipe would be off at all. We added apple chunks, no onions (preference), purple grapes, cheddar cheese (what I had!) and... oh ya, since we used canned chicken I'll back off the salt a bit next time. But if I cooked up some chicken myself I think the salt will be just perfect!

Definitely use toasted pecans and try plain yogurt or sour cream for part of the mayo. It allows you to make it creamier without adding that extra mayo richness.

Scrumptious and very easy to make. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I added additional ingredients that made it taste even better. (a splash of the juice the dill comes in)

Thanks for posting the recipe I will now always use for chicken salad!  This is wonderful.  I kept all the spices the same, except I left out the water chest nuts and the swiss cheese.  I served it on buns with lettuce and muenster cheese, it was sooo good!

The poultry seasoning is what makes this chicken salad taste so good.  I left out the water chestnuts (don't care for them) and put in chopped walnuts instead for the "crunch" not having water chestnuts would have given.  Yummy!

This is an excellent recipe.  I was a little skeptical about the combination of all of the ingredients, but I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was wonderful.  Took it to an office party and everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a great recipe for those of us who do not like too much mayonaise on our chicken salad.  I also loved that it wasn't a dry chicken salad, which I really do not like.  I did, however, change some things considering former reviews. 

I first seasoned the chicken in half of the spices the recipe called for (minus the poultry seasoning) then let it sit for a while.  I then boiled the chicken in a deep skillet (with the lid on) in chicken broth and oil, which adds a great flavor to the chicken and isn't as overpowering as poultry seasoning (the broth should be about half the level of the chicken breats).  I let the chicken cool and then pulled it apart instead of chunking it. 

I also changed it by using half green grapes and half red grapes which adds a great color to the salad. I also added some extra crisy crunched up bacon, just to add something different to the mix.  I always love something spicy so a added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I completely omitted the nuts and cheese and instead put some cheese on my sandwich. 

This really did turn out awesome and was a huge hit!

This was good. (Not as good as my favorite Rotissary chicken salad at Archer Farms, but a close second.) I made it pretty close to the recipe, substituting walnuts for water chestnuts and sharp cheddar for swiss cheese. I added about a tablespoon of sugar for some sweetness. I served it in a wrap with romaine lettuce. Very healthy and great for a summer lunch. Thanks!

THE BEST CHICKEN SALAD I've had!!!  I do not like creamy salads at all and this one was the perfect texture!  I followed the recipe almost exactly but I cooked the chicken in lemon-pepper first (it adds the PERFECT taste) and I did not add the swiss cheese.  The grapes make it taste so refreshing and the almonds add the perfect crunch!
HIGHLY RECOMENEDED!!!

this is a good recipe for basic chicken salad.  i added a little mustard and used hellman's mayonnaise because it is less sweet than the other mayonnaise brands.  i added 1/2 tsp. sage and used cashews instead of the water chestnuts (we don't like them).  try it and you won't be sorry!

Excellent recipe. The POULTRY SEASONING IS A MUST, otherwise it has no 'umf' to it. I decided to use two 12.5 oz cans of chicken: one all white meat, the other white and dark meat because it shreds better leading to a better cohesiveness if using this on a sandwhich or on a cracker and the dark meat adds a deeper flavor. I left out the grapes because I think the salt from the salad draws out the water in the grapes making it more prone to turn soupy and spoil quicker. I also left out the swiss cheese and just add it right before I eat it.

Excellent!  I took a taste of it right after I made it and all I could taste was the poultry seasoning and thought "what was all the fuss about how great this recipe was" ... I thought it was horrible.  But then I put it in my fridge and let it sit for a few hours and WOW ... very yummy!!!  I saved some time by cutting up already cooked chicken (bought two of those cooked chicken strip packages in the deli section).  I'll definately make this again!!!

Yum, Yum, Yum! Made a few changes and got fabulous reviews. Reduced amount of poultry seasoning to a little less then a ½ a tsp, lost the cheese and water chestnuts, changed from green to red grapes, and added a ¼ cup walnuts … and the magic ingredient – Cool Whip! I added about a cup. Mixed it all together and Wha-laa!

I made this for a luncheon at work & everyone just loved it! I followed recipe excatly only I used green grapes & added red grapes for color. The poultry seasoning I used was Old Bay & it is a must. I didn't have garlic powder so I substituted the salt quanity with garlic salt. The only thing that I can really reccommend is to DOUBLE the mayo & use a whole fresh lemon squeezed.  I cooked my chicken with teriyaka merinade in a disposable pan on the grill (easy clean up) I served with fresh croissants & fresh fruit.

This was a really good salad - for mine, I put no water chestnuts and no swiss cheese in. Although the flavors were good, my husband balked at the grapes (which were my favorite part) so I won't make this again unless it was just for me. I wouldn't like it without the grapes.

This was really tasty. I reduced the poultry seasoning to 1/4 t. as some others suggested, used shredded Swiss cheese instead of diced and red grapes -served it on croissants. I'll definitely make this again.

I have never been able to make chicken salad, but I decided I really wanted some that was homemade.  I had some grilled chicken with a montreal seasoning mix and went for it.  I used this recipe base.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used a mix of sour cream and light mayo, I toasted almonds for added crunch, and chopped up a granny smith apple instead of grapes.  I used mozzarella like someone suggested, and 1.5tsp of Splenda.  All I know is, even with the changes, I can't stop eating this!!!

We make this all the time! My parents are doing the low carb thing, and I just leave out the grapes for them.  Also, I use mozzarella cheese instead of the swiss, I only like swiss cheese in fondues.  :)

Very nice recipe....next time I may try slivered almonds instead of water chestnuts.  And I'd either cut back on swiss cheese or eliminate altogether.  A general comment about any chicken salad recipes...best results obtained when using a whole roasted chicken.  Poached chicken breats don't have the same flavour or texture.  If short on time, sometimes I'll purchase already roasted chickens from supermarket.

Excellent flavor.  I added some cashews to it and served it on toasted, buttered sourdough bread.  YUM!

This recipe is one of the best chicken salad recipes ever!!!  Everytime I make it people just love it!!! To save time I take a few short cuts.  I use Tyson's grilled chicken strips already cooked, and also by the swiss cheese already shredded.  This saves alittle time!!!

I first served this recipe at one of my Christmas cookie exchanges.  It was such a hit, I served it again the following year.  I have given out alot of copies of this recipe.  It truly is the best chicken salad I've ever had.  The blend of all the different ingredients makes it unique and very delicious!  Try it...I don't think you'll be disappointed!

This recipe is good, but I had to change it a little (the second time) to make it great. I didn't use the entire can of water chestnuts...half was definately enough. I also added sliced almonds, shredded carrots and extra celery. A tad bit of chile powder gave it some kick. Very yummy on a croissant.

This turned out really well...I added a couple cups of cooked brown rice and then doubled the dressing (and added some extra celery) to add some bulk without having to buy more chicken. I would definitely make it again, and maybe add more water chestnuts.

This is my first review of a recipe as all have been good - until now.  The poultry seasoning was sooo overpowering and the swiss cheese didn't add a lot.  I had to double the amt of mayo and add more pepper.  Won't make again.  Sorry!

Wonderful chicken salad flavor! The seasoned mayo really adds to this salad. In an attempt to cut a little fat, I omitted the Swiss cheese. Didn't miss it. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe,
Sharon.

Terrific! A huge hit at my dinner party. We didn't put the celery or chicken into the salad (served on the side) and it was still terrific. A real keeper!

Made it with a few changes. Did not add poultry seasoning, onion powder or  water chestnuts. Added one small  packet of Splenda for sweeter taste.   My husband loved it.

I've been using this recipe as a base for about 10 years. I serve on sandwich rolls at almost all of my kids birthday parties and the guests are never disappointed! I usually season the chicken breasts with salt and rosemary and cook with olive oil. I then toss the chicken into my food processor. What a lifesaver since I'm always making such a large batch and also want it less chunky to go on a sandwich roll. For ease, I use an Italian blend of shredded cheese. I omit the water chestnuts and celery because I think the grapes are the perfect compliment on their own. I make the dressing as stated but sometimes need more or less. Just depends on how much chicken I've cooked.

I would probably like it better without the green onions or with less...they overpower the other ingredients.

The best chicken salad I've ever eaten. My family loves it. I originally used walnuts and they are perfect for this. On a different occasion, I used almonds. Both are great but we prefer walnuts. Delicious and my go to chicken salad!!

I liked this recipe and made it, however, the poultry seasoning was so overpowering I could not eat it, tried adding more mayo, and other seasonings and the poultry seasoning just was so strong.  I made it again without the poultry seasoning and it's delicious!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I've been making it for years now and I get many requests to bring it to gatherings. The only adjustment I make is I don't use as much poultry seasoning as it calls for. Maybe 1/2 teaspoon instead of 3/4.

Yum! made for a summer picnic. Mom and sister loved this chicken salad. My favorite chicken salad recipe so far. I haven't used the Swiss cheese yet and will not be using water chestnuts- just don't like em. I like another reviewer's suggestion of using sour cream as well as mayo -will try that next.

Was looking for a good base recipe and this was it :)  I subbed Ranch dressing for mayo, used 1tsp minced garlic instead of the powder and some diced dill pickle in place of the lemon juice. Didn't have green onions but half of a yellow worked. I left the fruit and chestnuts out and added 4 slices of cooked crumbled bacon. 2 chicken breast baked for 35 min at 350 and shredded worked well. Thanks!

This is my favorite chicken salad and everyone who I make it for asks for it again and again. We love it! I like to serve it on a croissant. The only slight change I ever make is that I will used shredded swiss cheese if the store has it to save time!

This recipe is delicious!  I added 1 jalapeno (seeded and finely diced) for heat.  Served chicken salad on flourless wheat bread with alfalfa sprouts.  Excellent lunch!  Thanks Carol you get 5 stars!

Love it, make it all the time especially for conventions. Have also used red grapes, just as good (make sure they are seedless!) and often keep forgetting about the green onions. Still delish.

Sharon and Carol, thank you for sharing this recipe. It is absolutely delicious! I used your recipe for a sandwich mix. I left out the grapes this time (my husband doesn't like fruits in his meals) and also the diced Swiss (used sliced muenster cheese). Had canned white meat chicken in water on hand so used that instead (3-12.5 oz cans, drained). Prepared everything exactly as directed. This mix was moist and tasty! We have lots of leftovers to snack on with crackers, celery sticks, or to make more sandwiches for the week. Thanks again!

I did modify the recipe but still gave it only a 4 because I felt the flavor of the mayo mixture was very strong.  I only added half of the mixture and then straight mayo after that to get the creaminess I wanted.  Now it is perfect.  I omitted the water chestnuts and the cheese, used half of the recommended grapes and used white onion instead of green.  Thank you for the recipe.

I know everyone says this is the best chicken salad they have ever taste and they are right..  Who would have guessed that poultry seasoning would make such a difference.  I use what I have on hand and have used chedder, cojack and colby cheese and it's always great.  Used almonds, sunflower seeds when I am out of water chestnuts.  Thanks for the great recipe

LOVE this. I even added pasta and extra dressing and made it for picnic. I used red grapes, that's what I had. You could use apple too. I'm not going to look any further for a chicken salsd recipe.

The reason this recipe is nearly 5 stars is because it is terrific!  The poultry seasoning is just right.  I doubled this recipe using a whole roasted chicken. I followed a couple of other suggestions: used half mayo and half sour cream (low fat for both); mixed the seasonings and lemon juice and tossed with the chicken before adding the remaining ingredients; substituted dried cranberries for the grapes. Everyone wanted the recipe!  Kudos to Carol!

I thought this was really good.  I left out the fruit and cheese, because I was making for sandwiches.  I put a slice of Swiss cheese and some lettuce on the sandwich.  I love water chestnuts so I really appreciated them in this salad.  It was good just eating alone also.

This is a good recipe. I didn't give it a 5 because I did make some changes to the original. I omitted the water chesnuts because I personally don't like them. I added chopped pecans to the recipe and used 2 types seedless grapes. I took this to church for an afternoon reception. People raved over it and wanted to know who made it and the recipe for it. I think if you have to adjust the recipe or if you choose to, thenit is unfair to rate it exactly as written. It is a good basic recipe that can be played around with. Thanks for sharing!! Try my additions if you like pecans and see how people respond to it.

Pretty good recipe.  Omitted the water chestnuts (didnt have any)I went easy on the poultry seasoning, I added dried cranberries instead of grapes (what I had on hand).  Also used half miracle whip and half sour cream and a splash of apple cider vinager for extra zip. You can play around with this a lot and get just what you want I think.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this chicken salad, served in a croissant with curly leaf lettuce and tomato slices, for a luncheon, omitting the water chestnuts and serving the grapes on the side. Now I am passing out the recipe. It was a hit!

YUM!  I added dill & it gave such a nice flavor, but I'm also a huge fan of dill.  Definitely put this on croissants!!  It was delicious - and a big hit at our Mothers' Day luncheon.  I left out water chestnuts and it was perfectly fine.

Great base recipe!!  I usually add pineapple, grapes (red or green), and apples as my fruit.  Instead of using only mayo, I mix half mayo, half Ranch dressing and add dill and a bit of apple cider vinegar to my sauce.  It makes it nice and creamy with a bit of a zing from the vinegar.  Keep the seasonings the same, with the addition of dill and it's a big hit!!

Seriously a perfect chicken salad recipe.  The only thiing that I changed about it was the second time I made it, I used only 2 cups of chicken.  It kept it from being so dry.  I wouldn't change a thing as far as seasoning.  I didn't have any grapes, so I used mandarin oranges.  YUM

Delicious.  I did make some adjustments though. First I doubled the recipe since making for the entire week.  I salted and peppered 4 chicken breasts then cooked them in the oven for about 40 min or until done depending on the size.  then after cutting that up I mixed the celery, onion, cheese, and all the spices together before adding the mayo. I did have to add more mayo then called for, not sure if that was because I used real chicken instead of canned.  I found the onion to be a little overwhelming, probally won't add very much next time around.  I also omitted the grapes and water chestnuts.  Still delicious will make again.

Yum!  Used low fat miricle whip and canned chicken.  Very good on a roll for a quick lunch.  Does take longer than 20 minutes to prepare though.

Tasty chicken salad.  I made as directed.  I'll use a little less poultry seasoning next time, but that's the only change I'd make.

I made this for a kayaking picnic that never happened. We ate it the next day, and really liked it!  I did not have water chesnuts or green onions, so I just left them out. I added chopped walnuts for some crunch, and it was great.   I really liked it. We even added the cheese and all that good stuff.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I elected to omit the poultry seasoning and the salt, just personal preference.  This is a perfect light lunch dish!!  Definitely a 5 star!

Great recipe.  The seasoning adds nice dimension to the salad and the veg/fruit additions really rounded out the flavor and made it something special.  I did substitute leeks for green onions, as its what I had on hand.

I've tried chicken salad a few times and this is by far my favorite recipe!  I cut back on the poultry seasoning as others recommended, using only about 1/4 tsp. We didn't have any bottled lemon juice, so I squeezed a fresh lemon and then grated a little of the lemon zest into it.  I took this to an office carry-in lunch, and it got rave reviews!  Thank you!

Good Chix salad.  I followed the recipe to a T except I did not have swiss cheese so I used cheddar.  Still very good.  My hubby loved it.  I like nuts in my chix salad so I think I would have liked it more with some sliced almonds or pecans.

This was AWESOME!  I used 3 chicken breasts and did without the poultry seasoning, water chestnuts, and cheese.  I added a handful of chopped walnuts and it was perfect!  I WILL be making this again!

I made this last night for dinner and followed the recipe without making any changes. I was pretty disappointed overall. It really was somewhat bland. I actually put over a bed of dark red lettuce. My husband kept trying different dressings to give it some flavor. So it defeated the purpose of making the mayo dressing given we had to add more calories by adding more dressing. If I were to make this again I'd defintely add some crisp Fuji apples, currants and almond or peacon slices and make a sandwich with maybe some dark thick pumpernickle or rye bread. But it definitely needs something. Sorry. I was really hoping for more flavor. This was my first poor review on this site too.

Great recipe but i find it a little dry. It maybe because i omit the grapes.  I double the dressing and it's perfect. I made this chicken salad for a baby shower w/ 30 guest and have had many request for the recipe.

So good.  The grapes are that perfect touch of sweetness and the water chestnuts add a nice crunch.  I didn't have swiss so used grated cheddar and it turned out really good.  I love sweet relish so added a couple of spoonfuls.  Made with light mayonaise and it tasted wonderful.  The only thing I would change is the salt.  I actually don't know that it needs any maybe because the cheese is salty (swiss is salty like cheddar is).  Next time I'll leave it out and then just add it to taste.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks so much for the post.

We have made this many times, always to great reviews.  This is the BEST chicken salad you will ever have.  We add 1tsp poultry seasoning when cooking chicken, which really brings out the flavor.  Perfect recipe, always getting 5 stars from everyone who eats this wonderful dish.

I've made this recipe about 6 times now to rave reviews each time :)  It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to prepare but is well worth it!  After making it twice I tried cutting the amount of grapes in half and loved the results.
A great trick is to have a deli worker cut your swiss cheese in 1/2" slices, it cuts down on some of the prep work and you can have them weigh out exactly what you need :)
I use this as my standard recipe for chicken salad.  Makes a great lunch/snack.  Try spreading it on toasted sourdough bread!  My favorite part of this recipe is that I can buy precooked roasted chicken at Safeway and make a bunch for multiple meals right in my teeny student apartment :)

Pretty good salad with some extra spices; paprika, mustard and thyme were good.  I didn't think it took long to chop this up, not with a sharp knife and good wooden cutting board.

Best Salad that I ever tasted.  I did not have poultry seasoning, so I used old bay, couldn't find water chestnuts used chopped walnuts instead.  Doubled the recipe and added a whole romaine lettuce to it.  Will definetely make again.

One of the best chicken salads I've ever had! I really like the lower carb count and made it even less fat by not adding the cheese and using low fat mayo. I also did not add celery because my guest do not care for it. Still had a great crunch with water chestnuts and grapes. I took the recommendation from another reviewer and used half of the spices (minus poulty) to season chicken breast and then cooked them in a bit of olive olive and chicken broth. Everything turned out really nice. Thanks!!!

I am giving this 4 stars only because my boyfriend liked it and he normally doesn't care too much for chicken salad. This for me personally had too many flavors that seemed a little too strong. I think I like the typical somewhat blander taste of a normal chicken salad. Just too strong for my taste.

This is good stuff!!  I omitted the grapes and water chestnuts based on personal taster.  I shredded swiss cheese instead of cubing it since the chicken was already cubed.  I added a litte extra cheese also.  I subbed 3/4 tsp sage and 1/4 tsp thyme for the poultry seasoning seeing as I was out.  I served the salad on croissants and it was awesome.  We had an unexpected dinner guest at the last minute and even he wouldn't stop raving about it.  This will def be a part of my regular rotation!!

The onion taste in this salad throws some people off, but I think it is excellent!  I love the mixture of all the spices - it adds more than many "plain" chicken salads.  I use this recipe all the time!

This recipe is great and tastes even better the second day. For the chicken breast I used the Tyson oven roasted diced chicken breast to save time. I did add a handful of chopped white onion, left out the grapes and nuts (because I don't like nuts or grapes), added minced garlic instead of garlic powder, added three boiled eggs, and sprinkled a little curry powder on the top. It was delicious!

Delicious! This was my first time making chicken salad, and to cut down the preparation time I bought two packages of sliced, grilled chicken. I also did not add the swiss cheese, and I put some sliced, crispy almonds in it. VERY GOOD.

Yummy chix salad recipe. I doubled the mayo, but halved the salts(since many suggested reducing the salts)I didnt add grapes, since it was being used with crackers. I do think the water chestnuts, all the different salts, and the swiss cheese are the keys to what sets this recipe apart from typical chicken salads. I also use shredded swiss cheese.

I like this recipe.  Most chicken salads taste too heavily of mayonnaise, but this one I like.  I did make some changes though (to suit my pantry, mostly!).  I cut out the celery, water chestnuts and swiss cheese.  But I add 2 Tbs.  Dijon mustard and a bit of sugar/sweetener to taste.  This helps to cut the mayonnaise taste.  I have also substituted fresh lime juice instead of lemon at times and this is a nice change. I make this and serve it on the Amish White Bread recipe from this site.  It's always a huge hit!  I have also used red grapes instead of green (depending on what I have in the fridge).  
Thanks,Carol!  Even though I've ammended this recipe to my taste, I needed your basic recipe to start from.

This is our favorite summertime recipe.  We make this just as the recipe states except we don't use the water chestnuts and we lessen the amount of salt (I do this on all the recipes).  We always eat this on pita bread that's been grilled on the stove top.  Phenomenal recipe!

This chicken salad was fantastic.  I used a pre cooked chicken from safeway instead of cooking my own.  I took the advice of others had lessened the poultry seasoning to 1/4 tsp and left out the swiss cheese.  I used a mixture of green and red grapes and added a little more green onion.  The more this sat in the fridge, the better it was.  I used the Amish white bread recipe from this site and together with home made bread plus this salad, my spouse and I were in heaven.

This is fabulous - my husband gave it rave reviews and he ALWAYS compares to his aunt's famous chicken salad.  I omitted the grapes b/c he tends to like it as a sandwich and that didn't appeal to him however follwed everything else exactly as the recipe.  I also have done this using grilled chicken or rotisserie - both come out GREAT!

This is definitely the best. My son said it reminded him of chicken and dressing.

This is a tasty chicken salad. Love the grapes in there for the bit of sweet. Have never tried it with the swiss cheese, though because I'm not a fan. Need to find a cheese to substitute to get the full effect of this salad, I presume. I usually grill my chicken on the Foreman and move forward from there. Want to try it with canned chicken for convenience sometime, too. Clearly, I've come back to repeat this recipe several times, so that's definitely an endorsement. Enjoy.

Sharon, we really enjoyed the heck out of your friend Carol's recipe  for our lunch today. (I did end up omitting the water chestnuts though, and I used half the swiss cheese.) The only suggestion I would make here is to prepare more of the mayo mixture. I needed almost twice as much. Besides, it's delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

As a rule, I love chicken salads...but not this one.  It was okay, but not one I'd be really eager to make again.  The water chestnuts were a real turn off for me and maybe it was the swiss/grape combo that did me in.  I love swiss, love grapes, like water chestnuts, but all mixed together just didn't do it for me.  Maybe walnuts (as suggested) would be a better alternative.

I was looking for a great chicken salad recipe and this is it!  It is excellent!  I bought a rotisserie chicken at the store and diced it up.  Then as other reviewers suggested I used walnuts instead of water chestnuts and red grapes instead of green, just a personal preference.  Then I served the salad on pita bread.  Yummy!

This was an excellent recipe. After I made it I was a little concerned because it looked like there was too much going on, but tasting it after a couple hours confirmed most of the reviews on this salad - excellent. I did make a few changes, no water chestnuts, subbed craisens for grapes, and subbed shredded "italian" cheese for swiss. Really outstanding. I didn't even notice the flavor of the poultry seasoning - it was just really, really good!

I was a little hesitant to try this because I'm not a big fan of fruit in my chicken salad; but at a friend's insistence, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!!  I enjoyed the combination of flavors.  I made no changes, but I do think I'll reduce the amount of poultry seasoning just a touch the next time I make it, which is merely a personal preference.  Thanks for the delicious and unique recipe!

Everyone loves it when I make this (about half a dozen times, now).  I leave out the water chestnuts, and they aren't missed, but otherwise, I'm giving it 5 stars. I like the "sauce" part a lot, so I usually double all of it (seasonings and lemon juice) except the mayo to give it more flavor.  
I also think it works better when the celery and scallions are chopped extra fine.   Delish!!

This recipe was loved by all who tried.  I smoked a large marinated chicken for 6 six hours.  5 stars for sure the grapes give surprisingly nice sweetness.

Loved it! I doubled up on the garlic and onion powder, and added an extra 1/4 cup mayo just to make it a little more moist. I will be making this one again.

Very good. Excellent, in fact, but I'm here for the dressing.  Somehow I can't imagine cheese and water chestnuts in chicken salad.

Excellent recipe! Hubby even enjoyed it! I used red grapes for more "grapy" flavor, and substituted craisens for raisens as others have done. Extra curry for more flavor (did NOT make it more spicy!). Also, served on a croissant as a sandwich. This recipe is really a symphony for the tastebuds! Lots of different textures and flavors! Next time, I will add some sprouts on a light but "grainy" bread - yum! I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

A wonderful recipe, I used red grapes and I seasoned with the poulty seasoning to taste..which was slightly less than called for. I found the longer this chills in the frig the better it tastes. I served over a bed of lettuce with some chewy french bread on the side.

Very flavorful chicken salad.  As mentioned in other reviews, I cut back on the poultry seasoning.  Used 1/2 tsp.  I grilled my chicken breast and sprinkled Tastefully Simple's Dill Mix on it while grilling.  I also left out the cheese and grapes since I didn't have any on hand.

I just served this at a luncheon and it was a hit!  I reduced the poultry seasoning just a tad (after reading the other reviews).  I definately wouldn't take it all the way out- it added a nice and interesting flavor.  I also added some tarragon.  Yum!  Will make again!

Very good!  I didn't realize my kids had eaten up the grapes I had, so I had to do without.  I also needed to add more mayo than called for, about a cup total.  That may have been because I added extra chicken just to use up all my leftovers.  I let it sit overnight and tasted it, then added about a tablespoon of Splenda to sweeten it up.  The grapes would have probably done that if they had been in it to begin with.  Then it was just delicious, crunchy and totally a keeper recipe!  Thanks!

Fabulous chicken salad! I used canned chicken breast meat, and my mother mistook it for tuna salad, so I'll likely try something different - possibly rotisserie chicken meat - next time, but I love the recipe!

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had!!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would! 

I've never had a chicken salad that has swiss cheese in it. What a wonderful addition! I will make this again and again!!! Definitely a keeper!

The only change I made was that I used red grapes instead of green. That's just a personal preference and what I had on hand. And then next time I make this I will probably make just a bit more of the dressing than it calls for. I just like my chicken salad a little more creamy. Again just a personal preference. Oh and the dressing is WONDERFUL! It would be great even on a lettuce salad. 

Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!

I have been making this chicken salad for several years and it is my absolute favorite.  I love it!  I have served it bridal showers, graduation and birthday parties.  Serve it on croissants and it just delicious.  Only two changes I make are that I use shredded Cheddar cheese instead of cubed swiss cheese.  Also, I use red grapes instead of green.  Try this recipe, it is fantastic!

I made a few modifications, but overall this is a wonderful recipe! I omitted the poultry seasoning, swiss cheese, and grapes.  I only used about 1/2 the can of water chestnuts, which was plenty. Tastes great on a crusty roll. My fiancee and I love it!

Liked this a lot. Served on kaiser rolls spread with light creamy swiss cheese, the kind that comes in little aluminum foil covered wedges in a round box. Didn't have water chestnuts but will add them next time. The mayo with seasonings(cut poultry seasoning to 1/2 tsp) is subtle and not overpowering. Thanks for this recipe.

This chicken salad is really tasty.  I served it to a few of my friends and it went over great.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I substituted with other spices. I also omitted the swiss cheese for personal peference.  I will definitely make this again!

Best chicken salad I’ve ever tasted! I did make a couple of changes: used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise and Feta cheese crumbles instead of Swiss cheese. Tastes fine with the Swiss but we like the flavor of Feta more and it isn’t as ‘rubbery’ as Swiss.  Also added dried cranberries- delicious!

I made the recipe as is. The poultry seasoning was odd and overpowering. I grated the Swiss cheese and quartered the grapes (just to try and avoid any one flavor dominating a bite). It was def better on day two than day one. Now that I have made it and read reviews, I am sure the recipe would improve a lot with changes (i.e., less poultry seasoning, add nuts), but I’m so blah about it that I doubt I will try the recipe, again.

Five stars if you do not add the poultry seasoning!! It was amazing and a huge hit.   Two stars  if you do. The first time I made this I did not have poultry seasoning and it was fabulous. I should have left it alone but 2nd time  added and yuk completely overpowered all the other ingredients also don’t add the salt it doesn’t need it.  So disappointed

Delicious. I don't care for the flavor of poultry seasoning  so I just marinate chicken in balsamic vinegar dressing then grill.

We LOVE this chicken salad !! I do make a few changes that we have liked a bit better, first we do not use any poultry seasoning, instead of green grapes we use red grapes and instead of water crescents we use red apples!

Really delicious chicken salad! I used a medium-sized cooked breast, so scaled it down to 5 servings. I didn't use water chestnuts, but did add chopped walnuts. I had some Miracle Whip that needed to be used, so I went with that. It worked well here. I never added Swiss cheese to chicken salad, but it really complements the other flavors. After reading reviews, I cut back on the poultry season which I think was a good call. After testing, I did add more of the spices. I'll have to get some croissants....this would be great served on those. Thanks for this gourmet-like chicken salad!

Wow! Love it! I used smoked chickens I had left over and used red grapes too. I did not have water chestnuts but I’m sure they would have been great. I’m typically not fond of chicken salad, but this is a game changer! Thank you!

Yes, I will definitely make it again!!!  Husband had 2 bowls of it!  Changes that I made:
I doubled all the spices except for the pepper and salt.  
I also doubled the lemon juice.  
Instead of Swiss cheese I put Chipotle Monterrey Jack cheese instead.

I love this recipe. I sub half the mayo for poppyseed dressing and add a finely diced pink lady or honey crisp apple for the water chestnuts. I have made it before exactly as it is written, but I’ve gotten more compliments with my additions. It’s a great salad.

This is our go to with our roasted chicken leftovers. So needless to say we eat it at least 2-3 times a month. The only changes made is we don’t use the poultry seasoning (we don’t like it) and we add a little extra lemon juice.  Love it. Would recommend following the recipe first, then next time see if you want to make changes. You may find it perfect just the way it is.

It was good. I decreased the poultry seasoning by just a bit. I think it needs more mayo. Not very creamy at all. This is not your traditional chicken salad

I make this exactly like the recipe using rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. It is 100% delicious every single time. There are only 2 of us in my home but we eat this for lunches for a week and never get sick of it. We change it up by putting it on different vessels for eating. Our favorites are: tortilla, romaine lettuce leaf, half a hollowed out tomato, or on a halved lengthwise cucumber which has the seeds removed.

I have made this chicken salad twice now and it was fabulous both times. First time I made it exactly as written and the second time I omitted the cheese and water chestnuts. I was in a hurry and simply forgot. It was great either way. Next time I will add the water chestnuts and omit the cheese. The dressing for the salad is delicious.

My family wolfed it down. They decided they wanted a little more "tang" so i will add sweet pickle relish next time
I added dried cranberries this time
I used crushed pecans because that is what I had. They want a little more crunch so I will add more pecans and more celery next time.

The best chicken salad ever! Every time I serve it, people ask for the recipe!! I use “Bell’s poultry seasoning” from food.com, and leave out the water chestnuts because I never have them. Leave out the Swiss cheese or sub for Gouda as a personal preference. Red grapes for color variation. Serve on croissants for the best chicken salad sandwich ever! My husband has also mastered this recipe so it really deserves 10 stars!

I made this thinking it would be a keeper recipe. I followed it exactly and  the poultry seasoning was a big turn off. My husband kept tasting this seasoning throughout the afternoon. I wouldn’t make it using this spice but everything else was just ok. Nothing to brag about.

I made no changes, I may have added a little more chicken so I did need to add a little extra mayo.  My wife and I both enjoyed it and we will make it again.  Thanks

This was awesome! Everyone loved it! I did use apples instead of grapes and used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo but other than that, I left the recipe pretty much the same. 

Next time, I will double the recipe!

This is the best chicken salad I have had.I didn't have a couple of items so, I substituted swiss cheese with 1/4 cup parmessan and skipped poultry seasoning and it still turned out pretty good.

It's chicken salad for petes sake. Omit lemon juice, onion & garlic powders. Use sliced green onion, forget garlic. Miracle whip. Red and green grapes for colour variation or diced apples. Sub walnuts for water chestnuts.  Cheese is nice but unnecessary.

Love this recipe! I made some adjustments to account for who I was serving; I left out the water chestnuts and Swiss cheese and added a handful of crushed almonds instead. I also used light Miracle Whip instead of mayo to cut down on the fat content. The seasoning is perfection and this is a big hit in my house!

This recipe blends just the right amount of seasonings to give our neighborhood "tea room" chicken sandwiches some real competition.  I added Craisins  and omitted the cheese and poultry seasoning. I also used Dukes mayonnaise.

The basic recipe looked very inviting but I didn't have all the ingredients.  I was also making it for two instead of nine.  Besides the chicken and mayo, I used red seedless grapes cut into quarters, vidalia onion minced, a touch of thyme, garlic powder, and salt.  I was looking for some sweet to put in my chicken salad made from leftover roti chicken...the grapes were perfect.  It was good enough for the fussy eater in my house.  I'll be making it again and will stay closer to the original.

I wanted to keep eating this until it was gone.  Lots of adjustments:  I used walnuts instead of water chestnuts.  I bought a whole chicken, quartered it, and poached the chicken breast quarters with thyme, celery, onion, and carrot before dicing the chicken for this salad.  Very moist tasty chicken that way.  I used less poultry seasoning than recommended.  I used purple grapes of course.  And I substituted sour cream and vegenaise for half the mayo.  No green onions.  No swiss cheese needed but might try that next time.  It is so good.

This was a delicious chicken salad- I've found my recipe.   I boiled about 2 lbs of chicken, cut it up and cooled it and added carol's ingredients.    The end result was a step above basic - I really enjoyed it and the family seemed content (I mean to some degree good chicken salad is good chicken salad).      To me,  what made it special though were the chunks of Swiss.  I am not usually a fan of Swiss but it really added a nice texture in contrast to the crunchy onions and it went really well with the chicken- don't leave it out.  I was worried there wouldn't be enough mayo mixture at first but it was perfect.     This was the first chicken salad I've ever made and this recipe is going into my cookbook of tried and true to pull out on special occasions.    There may be a better one out there but I don't think I'll bother experimenting to find it because it would probably take too many attempts to make it worth the effort.   In my "spare time" it could be fun to try a comparison some day. In the meantime,  I'll be quite proud to bring Carol's chicken salad  to an event and have it referred to  as "Laura's (my) chicken salad"!  I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow for lunch!

Easy-Peasy to make.  Seasoning is great!  I used an Old Bay lemon seasoning in place of poultry seasoning, and red grapes for green.  Made amazing chicken salad wraps.  This recipe is a keeper!

We followed recipe exactly and really enjoyed this.  Only thing is that next time I would probably leave out the cheese (and I am a cheese lover).  If I use the cheese it will be shredded and maybe cheddar instead of Swiss.

Very good after 2 hours chilling; much better the next day.  A a few adjustments based on other reviews:   I added the seasonings (using 1/2 tsp only of poultry seasoning) and lemon juice to the diced rotisserie chicken, and put that in the fridge while prepping the other ingredients.  Used celery, green onions and chopped water chestnuts per the recipe, and black seedless grapes. Subbed about half the mayonnaise with sour cream.  A great way to use leftover deli chicken.  Served with ritz crackers the first day ... Hubby loved it on sandwiches the next day

This is an enjoyable chicken salad. It is savory (if you want a milder flavor you might reduce the pepper & poultry seasoning), but it is good as is! I did not have the cheese, water chestnuts, or onion powder (I used a small amount of minced sweet onion). When I make this again I'll make sure to have the water chestnuts on hand.

I didn't have green grapes or spring onions but otherwise, I followed the directions exactly.  Tasty! I LOVED the crunch of the water chestnuts and celery! I mixed everything together the night before and was planning to add the swiss cheese the night before but I simply forgot.  I will definitely make this again.

Odd combination at first, but I decided to give it a try. 
Possible to add a tad mustard to tang it up. Kinda sweet. 
Made family & friends a sandwich with it and they liked it. 
Glad it was a hit & super easy.

This is the best chicken salad ever!  Great combination of flavors.  I've made it several times.

Went by the recipe exactly except didn't have any poultry seasoning. It was still pretty tasty. Added toasted pecans over romaine lettuce. I'd make it again.

I tweaked it by using Kraft mayo with olive oil and by adding sliced almonds but I still found it delicious.

I just made this chicken salad yesterday and must say that the dressing is outstanding.  Because I don't care for water chestnuts, I substituted cashews and that was delicious. I also substituted an avocado for the grapes. Everyone asked for the recipe so I think the substitutions were well received.  I will definitely be making this chicken salad recipe again.

This recipe is so satisfying--it's very savory. Make a few hours, or a day ahead and let it all marinate together in the fridge. I also tried it with some feta cheese sprinkled on top--delish.

Overall, this is a good recipe. I did not include the poultry seasoning, water chestnuts, or Swiss cheese. It was great without them! I also used red grapes instead of green because I only eat red grapes. I’m curious to what the recipe tastes like as is, I just didn’t want to chance it this time.

I made this exactly as directed (except for the green onions) and I wouldn't change anything!  I think water chestnuts instead of walnuts is great, it gives it a great texture and crunch. I didn't have green onions on hand so I added some finely chopped yellow onion and it turned out fine, I don't even know if it made that much of a difference.  I used fresh chicken breasts and the way I cooked them made the chicken tender and juicy which added to the overall taste and texture I think.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was enjoyed by everyone in the family, even my picky eater! We don't like much crunch in our chicken salad, so left out celery, green onions, water chestnuts. I used celery salt and onion powder instead. Didn't have Swiss cheese or lemon juice & was still yummy! Used red grapes instead of green. Would add the lemon juice & maybe try the Swiss cheese next time. May also add walnuts next time as well.

The seasoning in this recipe is fantastic.  I absolutely love this as does my daughter and husband.  I did leave out the grapes, water chestnuts, and cheese.  I don't care for grapes or water chestnuts so this was just a personal preference.  I think the cheese would be amazing but I cut it out because I am on a diet where I need to limit the amount of dairy.

I use "Garlic Chicken" from this website (Cut up, of course)  and omit the garlic powder, onion powder, and poultry seasoning in this recipe as the "Garlic Chicken" provides the flavors. I never add grapes or nuts to chicken salad and didnt have water chestnuts....still DELICIOUS

This is a really delicious recipe. I followed directions except for the chestnuts which I substituted pecan pieces for and instead of swiss I used horseradish cheddar because it's what I had. I also used canned chunk chicken breast which worked out perfectly. Perfect for a hot summer day!

I prepared this chicken salad tonight so I could have it for lunch tomorrow.  I have used this as a base recipe before but to be safe I double checked the reviews before beginning.  I didn't read anything about it tasting over-seasoned but that is what I found.  Too much poultry seasoning and salt in my opinion.  I created a variation using celery, red grapes and pecans (to be added before eating) since that is what I had on hand.  I ended up having to add more lemon juice, grapes and mayo to offest the seasonings.  It still doesn't taste great but it will have to do for lunch.  Next time I would definitely use a half or a quarter of the poultry season and no salt.  I'd rather sprinkle a lil while eating if need be.

I have made this chicken salad I dont know how many times!! We use a rotisserie chicken, shred the swiss cheese and leave out the water chestnuts. My husband always begs me to make it, so I always double the recipes even though its just us 2 LOL We eat it up in the matter of days. This is by far my favorite chicken salad recipe. Thank you Carol for posting it!

This was pretty good.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but good.  I used half red grapes and half chopped apples.  I also added 1/2 cup pecans.  I agree with other reviewers about the swiss cheese.  Don't think it needs it.

My husband makes this when I can't make dinner and it is delicious!  He makes it exactly the same as in the recipe, except he leaves out the poultry seasoning.  It has been phenomenal every time.  I love it on Triscuits, homemade wheat bread, and just by itself.  I highly recommend this recipe, it's delicious and foolproof (just ask my hubby!)

This is a great summer dish. I made some alterations though. I skipped the grapes & onion powder & instead of swiss cheese, I used cheddar. I also mixed in some sliced carrots. My husband liked it so much, he took some to work for lunch the next day.

This is by far the best tasting Chicken Salad I've ever had!!  The flavors and textures are just amazingly delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of using red grapes (because I love them more than green) and I omit the water chestnuts, not a fan of them.  And to make things easier, I usually just buy a store bought roast chicken.  By the way, the addition of the Swiss cheese is ingenious!!!  Love the creamy, sharp taste it gives.

I used less mayonnaise and added some sour cream; I did not use salt at all and did not miss it; used both white and dark meat; did not have water chestnuts so cut finely 1/2 Granny Smith apple; used seedless red grapes, that is what I had. Left out the swiss chunks but next time will add as after eating can see how it would blend nicely. The dressing was just right I think the poultry seasoning was the trick here. Thank you Sharon. This is a keeper.

This is an easy meal & my kids all love it. I've made a few changes, I don't add celery, onion, cheese or nuts & instead of grapes I add mandarin oranges & mix them real well throughout.  (The kids favorite part are the oranges!)

This is  is probably the best chicken salad recipe I've tasted!  I didn't have green onions, water chestnuts, cheese or grapes so it was pretty basic but sstill SO very good!  My kids asked for seconds, and that's saying a lot!

As always, I made some changes. I changed the quantity to 30 to serve about 50 people at a catering event I did. (I bought croissants, cut them in half, and made a pocket to put the chicken salad -- worked great). The sauce, I did NOTHING to, it's perfect. I omitted the water chestnuts, I used shredded swiss cheese instead, and about 1/2 the grapes it called for -- perfect!

I like that there are a lot of ingredients in here that make this chicken salad more gourmet. I.e. grapes, green onion. I used red grapes and I really liked the color. I however thought that the poultry seasoning was very overpowering. I made this once and I don't think I'll make it again.

For a summer salad or with soup it's great and very simple to put together.  One of my standards.  I did make a few changes.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, chopped onions, or green onions.  The lemon juice makes it!!

EXECELLENT! I made a few changes, used red grapes rather than green. I also did not add the swiss cheese or water chestnuts and it was still perfect. I also didnt have a lemon, so I used lemon pepper instead. This was so good and everyone at work loved it. Will be making this again very soon.

I just made it.  I used old tasteless fried chicken that I bought from the grocery store and froze, defrosted it and followed the recipe (without the skin).  I didn't have any celery so I used celery seeds instesd.  AWESOME!!!

I just made this an hour ago.  My son loved it. [very picky eater]  I used chicken leftover from last night's dinner.  I changed things a bit [of course].  I omitted the celery [sorry--I don't like dental floss as a vegetable!!  haha!!] I used pine nuts instead of water chestnuts because that's what I had on hand.  My husband shredded the swiss and I liked it that way.  Also, I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I just used a dab of sage, thyme, and crushed rosemary.  The only complaint I have [shich is why I gave it a 4] is that it's WAY too salty!!!  I would cut the salt in 1/2, or cut it out completely.  If you season your chicken when you cook it, I just don't think you need it!  Other than that, it was very tasty!  I'm sure I'll make it again. :)

During Oregon's heat wave last week, I made this for dinner for myself and my two teenage boys. Next morning - it was gone and they wanted it again. So I made it. Next night was fast food and another boy asked me to make it the next night! So good!

As many have suggested, to some the poultry seasoning doesnt cut it. Just use seasoning salt instead and you'll be satisfied with the results. I Add apples and Dried cranberry or dried Goji berry & a lil paprika. I dont use the nuts or cheese. Just tweak it to your own taste budz!

Best chicken salad I have ever tried! I left out the swiss cheese simply because I do not care for it. Also left out the water chesnuts. On accident, I did not add the poultry seasoning but it still turned out amazing! My mother tried this recipe with the poultry seasoning and raved about how much better mine was than hers. This will be a family favorite for years to come!

This was definatley a good base recipe but needed some tweeking to make it more exciting.  Instead of using the poultry seasoning, I used Montreal Chicken Spice and this really added some zing.  I also toasted pecan rather than the water chestnuts and used shredded Swiss.  Overall we all enjoyed it.

This was super easy to make and the taste was delightful. We had this for lunch with toasted, homemade bread. Very nutritious and satisfying. I will make this again. Oh, we had no lemon so used apple cider vinegar.

I have two complaints about this recipe.  First, it was way too dry for our taste.  I doubled the mayo dressing, and that fixed the dryness problem.  Second, the poultry seasoning gave the salad a harsh taste.  Perhaps if I hadn't doubled the dressing, it would have been okay.  I'm going to try the recipe again, doubling the dressing and leaving out the poultry seasoning.  The texture and crunch of the salad was wonderful.  I'll repost after I try it again, without the poultry seasoning.

We used red grapes in this.  I thought it was very rich, but the kids loved it.  After the meal, we realized we hadn't added the lemon juice! Great salad!

I don't know why anyone would not rate this 5 stars.  It is delicious!!  My pick 14 old daughter who dislikes mayo tried it and loved it too.  She wants me to make this again soon!

I love this chicken salad!  Every time I make it, I get rave reviews.  My husband (not exactly a chicken salad lover) even requests it.

This is my all-time favorite chicken salad recipe! I've made it countless times, and use it as a base for whatever I have in my fridge. I usually make the following changes: omit the water chestnuts, replace the swiss with monterey jack cheese, and use rotisserie chicken. With these changes it is simply delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never been a big fan of chicken salad but this recipe was great!!! I did however omit the water chestnuts and added a little more mayo at the end but that because of personal preference... GREAT RECIEPE!

This was fantastic!  I served this as a sandwich in mini croissants for lunch and it was a big hit.  I used the other rater's suggestions of 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 sour cream.  Also, I had to use red grapes halved because the green grapes looked awful.  Great recipe!! Thank you!!

I used green and red seedless grapes, added some toasted walnuts and used cheddar cheese instead.  It's the recipe that I've been looking for all these years.  Thanks for sharing!  It's good served on butter lettuce!

My family loves this recipe!  I haven't made it in awhile, but stocked up on chicken today to make sandwiched for the week!  The only changes I make are omitting the water chestnuts-just because I don't think my children will like them-and omitting the poultry seasoning because I never have any on hand.  I just dice up the swiss cheese as another reviewer mentioned as well.  It's delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!!! I used this recipe for the dressing part. (meaning I didn't add the onions, water chestnuts, cheese, grapes) I just added the chicken & some dill relish. It was perfect!! Thanks so much for adding this recipe. I will make this over & over again!

I have lost track of how many times I have made this recipe. My whole family loves it.   
We prefer toasted almonds instead of water  
chestnuts and cheddar instead of swiss. It is great served on sesame seed bagels.

Great chicken salad!  I couldn't believe how well the grapes tasted in it.  I even used diced/sliced swiss because I had no shredded on hand.  Can't wait to make it again.

A great basic chicken salad recipe!  I did make a few modifications, however..like omitting the poultry seasoning because my family doesn't like it.  I also omitted the onion powder since I didn't have any on-hand.  I also used shredded Parmesan instead of the Swiss cheese because that's what I had on-hand.  I didn't have time to cook some chicken up, so I used two 12.5-ounce cans of chicken breast packed in water (Kirkland/COSTCO brand), drained.  It still came out absolutely wonderful!  We all gobbled it up...Thanks!

Didn't care for the poultry seasoning taste.  Thought it was average.  Next time, I would use less of that seasoning or not use it at all.  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this! It had the best flavor of any chicken salad I have ever tasted (while still tasting like a good traditional chicken salad). This was a last minute decision for dinner and so we didn't have all the ingredients. I used red onions instead of green, red grapes instead of green, and omitted the Swiss cheese. Served the salad on rolls with lettuce. This was a hit for a quick summery dinner!

This is the first 5-star recipe from Allrecipes that I have been disappointed in.

The recipe calls for too much poultry seasoning in my opinion. The sage taste totally overwhelmed this recipe.

When I make it again, I will leave out the poultry seasoning and instead just do some rosemary and thyme.

Other than the powerful sage taste, I think it was a good recipe.

Great recipe! The spices are whats key in this recipe...other than that you can change up the rest to your liking.  I changed it a bit just b/c of what I had on hand.  Added sunflower seeds, monterey jack cheese and raisans rather than grapes and swiss and scallions.  Yuuuuum!

I love this recipe and make it quite often, especially when having guests over.

I use slightly less poultry seasoning and no water chestnuts. I serve in pita pockets or on croissants. To make it easier (because all the prepping takes longer than the time listed), I typically use 2 cans cooked chicken.

This recipe was great.  I actually changed it a little bit because of the things I was lacking in my pantry and wanted just a quick lunch.  I didn't have any grapes, so I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and a handful of chopped walnuts.  I made 2 sandwiches, one wrap and one on pumpernickel and rye and they were both hits!

Made for 40 ladies today.  It was delicious!  I omitted the cheese.  It was a little overpowering.  The next time I make it will will probably use red seedless grapes for added color.  Everyone loved it!

Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for in chicken salad recipe. I change the green onions for red onions and green grapes for red grapes and it adds a lot more color and better flavor (for me). I also use shredded swiss instead of cubes and it's perfect!!
The amount of dressing used is perfect. It seasons everything wonderfully without being too gloppy or overwhelming.
I make this all the time and it lasts for a good while. Definitely a great dish to make ahead! Tastes even better after sitting overnight in the fridge!

Wow!!!! This recipie was amazing. It was a perfect combination of rich robust flavors with a hint of sweetness. I used store bought roasted chicken but i do suggest that if you cook the chicken at home that you season the chicken before cook it. Also, i doubled the onion and garlic powder. This is a keeper (this salad is better than any store bought salad  0.

Made this to take to a party and it got mixed reviews. I thought it was good, not great, but definitely good. I love the grapes mixed in with the chicken, but I will have to keep searching for the perfect blend of ingredients, sauce and spice. This wasn't it for me, but don't misunderstand, it is still quite good. I did get positive comments from some people at the party.

I made this for my son's first birthday party, and it was great with crackers (among the other food we made).  Great recipe with the grapes. I used red grapes for color contast.  The poultry seasoning gives it great flavor.

Tasty!  I followed the recipe, except I used only 1/2 tsp Poultry Seasoning and added 1/2 cup red onion along with the green onion.  I could have used 1/4 tsp Poultry seasoning, as it is very strong.  But overall, a really delicious salad!

My family loves this salad. A perfect recipe for left over rotiseire chicken. I substituted red grapes for green and walnuts for water chestnuts and the results were divine.

I liked the cheese and the grapes, but I personally found this recipe too salty - I added a little extra mayo to help that. The flavour of the poultry seasoning was a little too strong for my liking.

My family loves this.  I'm not a fan of water cress or celery, so to get the needed crunch I add chopped pecans.  I also substitute green grapes for red grapes.

Made this chicken salad again last night and it was incredible! I did use 1/8 tsp celery seed since I didn't have any fresh celery and used 1/2 ea. green apple and red apple in place of the water chestnuts but the scrumptiousness is in the sauce.  So good.  This is my go to recipe for chicken salad.

This is a fantastic recipe....  I also used red grapes for color.  I also used croissants to sandwich the salad.
My husband had it for dinner and took it to work the next day for lunch.  He agrres that this is "keeper".  Thanks Sharon!

While this is not my favorite chicken salad that I have tasted, this was a good, simple chicken salad.  I used red grapes for color and shredded the swiss cheese.  I served it on croissants.  The whole family liked it.  I would give it 3.5 stars, if I could. I might have to make this again to really tell if I like it or not.

Great chicken salad!  Made the salad the night before with everything except the celery, cheese and grapes to keep them fresh/crisp.  I served this at a luncheon so I added the remaining items about 3 hours before.  Used red grapes instead of green.  I also used a whole chicken instead of just breasts (get one from either Sam's or Costco).

This is the best chicken salad I've ever had and I'm very picky about my chicken salad!  I cooked split chicken breasts with chicken broth & seasonings first.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was not using as much poultry seasoning and used red grapes.  The water chestnuts and swiss cheese really make it, but you don't taste them specifically in the recipe.  Awesome!  I served it on croissants.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and unfortunately, I thought it was rather bland. Without the green grapes, it would've had no taste at all. Sorry, won't be making this one again.
