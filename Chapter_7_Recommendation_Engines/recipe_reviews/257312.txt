I made this dish tonight, and it was surprisingly tasty! Instead of preparing this in 2-3 steps, I took the advice of another cook and dumped everything into my InstantPot at once, frozen bone-in thighs and all. I used the manual setting for 30 minutes, allowed the pressure to release naturally for about 10 minutes. The liquid was thin, so I added a little thickener (about 2 tablespoons of corn starch mixed thoroughly with about ½ cup milk) and put the InstantPot on saute mode. After about 5 minutes the sauce had thickened to a honey consistency, and I served it over white rice. My family enjoyed it thoroughly. I hardly have enough for my lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much for sharing such a simple and yummy recipe!

A++++ for flavor, just loved this recipe in the instant pot. I wasn't sure if the ingredients called for boneless or bone-in chicken...I assumed boneless but I used the chicken thighs I had purchased for cacciatore so I up'd the cook time to 15minutes. I was also confused by the directions to sauté after cooking the chicken since I knew there would be liquid from the chicken. Instead, I fixed the pepper and onions and sautéed separately on the stovetop. Then after I released the pressure and added the remaining ingredients, I also added the pepper and onions on top. The chicken finished cooking/braising in the sauce made from the liquid and soy sauce (plus all additional ingredients). I let it cook down and thicken a bit but stopped cooking when chicken was done and when there was enough sauce to pour over rice. This is like a sweetened version of adobo chicken. Sooooo happy with the flavor!!! Thanks for a great keeper recipe for the instant pot!!

Unbelievable. I threw it all in the instant pot with frozen chicken and cooked it for 30mins. It was a hit with all my family and I have fussy eaters!

Thankyou all for the fabulous reviews! Like many of you, we sometimes add Red chili flakes, pineapple chunks, water chestnuts, cashews, and other variations including just plain chicken breast. I’m so glad that you all have liked it and have reviewed and posted pictures. Please check under my My profile I will have new Insta pot recipes posted. I would love to swap recipes with all of you.

We liked this.   I made a few modifications. I used 2 bone in breasts. After putting them in the pot and setting the time the burn warning came on.  I had to add 1/2C chicken broth. Set the timer for 20 minutes. Made rest as written but added 1 tsp red chili flake and a cup of chopped pineapple.

Made this for dinner tonight and all I can say is Wow! Turned out to be very delicious. Served over rice. My wife and kids have asked me to definitely keep this recipe for future use. I love the simplicity yet it is loaded with flavor. Kudos to you on this one.

I gave this 4 stars for delicious flavor and tender chicken!  It was easy, quick, and yummy over rice. I didn't change a single ingredient, but I did make changes in the preparation. As others have mentioned, the Instant Pot requires liquid in order to come to pressure, so I placed the boneless thighs on a rack over 1 c. water. I found 8 minutes at high pressure and 6 minutes natural release was perfect. Then I set the chicken aside, drained the pot, and proceeded with the recipe, not adding the chicken (which I cut in chunks) till the pepper strips and onions were crisp-tender. I decided to thicken the sauce with 1 tsp. cornstarch in 1 tsp. water.

I received an instant pot for Christmas and this was the first recipe I tried.  The IP instruction book said anything cooked on pressure cooking mode required at least 500 ml of liquid so I added this to the chicken but I scooped out most of the water before moving to the saute part.  I did not have any chicken broth otherwise I would have used broth.

The chicken was delicious!  So moist .  I will definitely make this again.  I think I would try it with less brown sugar & honey because I try to avoid sugar when I can.

I followed another review and added everything to the instant pot. First I browned about 1 pound of diced chicken breast in a little oil on sauté then I added the peppers onions and garlic and stirred a few more minutes until the vegetables were a little soft. Next I turned off the pot and added the soy sauce brown sugar honey then  1 1/2  cups of rice and finally 2 cups of chicken broth. I did Not stir, put the lid on made sure it was set to sealing not venting set to pressure for 10 minutes with quick release. Perfect.

This was so good! I just got my instapot for Christmas and was looking for a good family friendly recipe. I am so glad I tried this one. Even my 8 year old (who hates all food accept chicken and nuggets and fries) gave it an 8 our of 10 stars! I saved the remaining sauce to use on my lunch tomorrow because it was so delicious. I will definitely be making this again in the near future.

I followed the instructions, but used boneless skinless chicken breasts (bc that’s what I had on hand). I couldn’t believe how much my boyfriend & my dad enjoyed the dish (yay!). I only had a bite (bc it was gone by the time I was ready to enjoy it) & I thought it tasted good, myself. Thank you for this recipe!

very easy, quickly made dish that was fabulous!!  love the taste.. but changed the method: in my one-pot, cooked the thighs on saute setting in 1 tsp oil , with the veggies, ( onion and peppers) with garlic powder, til lightly browned. added the soy sauce, honey, etc,,, changed the brown sugar to Splenda brown sugar and reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup... this due to personal tastes. also added 1/2 cup baby carrots, for more veggies .  then cooked it on stew setting ( high pressure) for 15 min. it came out tender, and delissshhh!!!  hubby said it was his fave soy-based dish ive made!!  ( he doesn't normally like soy sauce ) ita a keeper!! thanks for the recipe!!

Dump water out of the instant pot after you’ve cooked the chicken and before sauté-ing.

Prepared exactly as written, and it was perfectly fast and easy and very good... in fact, I’d take a picture but we ate it all up! We added some roasted peanuts after cooking.

Delicious!  I read the reviews and their ideas and realized this is easily adaptable.  The submitter's comments included adding red pepper flakes, pineapple, etc so I added them and in addition, I used waterchestnuts and macadamia nuts that I had in my pantry.
I just threw everything into the IP and let it cook.   The result was fall off the bone chicken and like others, the peppers and onions melted into the sauce.  I had saved out some of both and added it in after it was finished cooking.  I turned my IP to the saute and let the sauce reduce while I shredded the chicken.  Shredding the chicken turned out to be a great idea.  The dish turned into more of a stew with a TON of flavor.
I served it over coconut rice. 
Next time, I will saute the chicken and vegetables and play with the timing.  I think I allowed it to stay in the pot a little too long while using the natural release function .

This was very good. The sauce ends up tasting a bit like teriyaki. I used chicken broth to cook the chicken in the Instant Pot.  I then scooped out as much broth as possible before saunteeing.  I enjoyed it, especially all of the peppers and onions, my husband said he wouldn’t mind having this monthly.

My first time pressure cooking something, prepared exactly to the recipe with some red pepper flakes to boot. Was fabulous. No need to do a 1-step dump as some other reviewers have done, while the chicken is doing its thing you got plenty of time to do all your peppers and onions chopping and ingredient gathering.

Turned out GREAT! with a few changes.  Brown the chicken first.  I had to increase the cooking time to 20 minutes, 10 minutes didn't fully cooked the chicken.  I removed the chicken and sauteed the veggies in the ingredients then added the chicken back.  Used peppers, brussels sprouts, celery, mushroom and green onions....delish!

Yummy. As a newcomer to the Instant Pot game, I found this recipe simple to follow. I did find that it took longer than 15 minutes for most of the liquid to evaporate, but it left a nice sauce to use on the side.  I used bone-in chicken thighs and some leftover uncooked chicken breast pieces. The chicken cooked beautifully and was very moist. The bell pepper was also nice and tender. Flavorful dish - will become a dinner staple.

Very good favor but was a bit to sweet and strong for my husband and me, especially by the end of the meal. Next time I think I'll cut back on the sugar, honey, and soy and see if it suits us a bit better. Definitely a keeper though!

It turned out as it should, but it didn’t quite make the mark for us. It was edible, but my family wasn’t impressed.

Loved the taste.  I had boneless, skinless thighs and as it was on sauté in the pot the chicken fell apart.  So I mashed up the bigger pieces of chicken and threw it on soft taco shells and added salsa and sour cream... everyone loved it.  Brought to work for lunch and it was great by itself out of a bowl.

Very good, easy recipe. There was a lot of liquid when it was finished cooking. Given that the liquid was salty from the soy sauce and sweet from the honey and brown sugar, next time I’ll scoop out the chicken, peppers and onions and put it in lettuce wraps or over rice.

No complaints here! I made it exactly as written. Served with egg noodles for the kids and then, since I didn’t make enough egg noodles, my husband ate it over rice. Everyone enjoyed it very much.
The sauce is thin BUT I don’t think I’d change the consistency. It makes the chicken tender and it’s great that it isn’t too gravy-like. Perfect with rice, which absorbs the flavor of the sauce.
Next time I might add some broccoli and snow peas.

Dumped everything in the pot at once. Added a little McCormick Asian seasoning, cooked boneless thighs for 8 minutes. We all LOVED it!!! Definitely a keeper.

My husband is extremely fussy  about chicken and will only eat the breast. Snuck this one on him and he loved it! I followed the recipe for ingredients and then  referred to    Hilary Smith Brown post for preparation (no Splenda) . I didn’t take out liquid but that was ok . It was delicious. For leftovers added frozen peas and carrots and served over white rice. This is a keeper for me.

This recipe is BOMB!!! I’m a pretty ok cook but this turned out so good I impressed myself and the boyfriend! All I did was follow the instructions exactly how they’re written!!! Anyone who didn’t like this needs to trade in their taste buds for some new ones or follow the directions exactly as written and not try to modify it!!

I loved it but I changed it up a bit. I put the black pepper, soy sauce, powdered garlic and half of how much it calls for brown sugar with stevia. (I am avoiding sugar) Then I pressure cooked it with frozen thighs for 25 min. After it was done I  sauteed it with green and red peppers and onion.

I was skeptical of this recipe but it was very tasty! I used red peppers instead of green, added a cup of pineapple, and spiced it up with some habanero sauce and Sriracha. Make sure you remember that the Instant Pot needs about a cup of water when cooking the chicken the first time. I discarded the water before starting to saute. If you put the chicken in while you saute and stir the vegetables, it will fall apart almost like pulled chicken. Would be great served over rice!

I will definitely make this again. I doubled the recipe, and doubled the garlic on top of that, added 4 thinly sliced serrano peppers, and used a small amount of molasses in place of the brown sugar. The result was about 12 meals' worth of food.

I’m new to Instant Pot so I’m looking for recipes that I can add to the collection that came with the appliance. I followed the suggestion from one of reviewers and put everything in all at once. And I used bone in chicken thighs and legs. It was terrific. The chicken practically fell off th bones. Definitely would make again.

Next time, I would use boneless, skinless chicken thighs (is that a thing?). But other than that, this was a definite winner.

I used red bell pepper instead of green.  I put everything in the Instant Pot and cooked for 30 minutes--my thighs were skinless, bone-in and frozen. The only thing is that cooking it all together, the onions and peppers were pretty much cooked into the sauce, but that was fine with us. I added cornstarch to thicken it up and served with noodles. Very tasty.

I would thicken the sauce and add more black pepper, but otherwise very tasty!

I made this with the recipe as written, and then with modifications. No matter which way I make it, it turns out fantastic! I now add a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the mix, and toss everything in like other reviewers mentioned doing. We love our garlic so that gets almost tripled. The kids love it, and leftovers are never available with this! I also shred the chicken afterward (which isn't hard, because the chicken just falls apart when you try to stir the mixture).  Definitely a keeper!

Very good. I usually don't like green peppers and didn't mind them a bit in this dish.

Made it exactly as called for, even used low sodium soy sauce, but it was just way too salty for my family. Both times. It sounded delicious.
