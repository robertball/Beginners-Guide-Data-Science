My family ate everything on their plate. Loved it! I baked the tilapia - 375 degrees for 12 minutes.  I cooked for 4 people so for the pasta, I used 10 ounces of pasta, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 cup parmesean, 1/4 tsp. each of oregano, basil, and cilantro.  When I drained the pasta, I reserved some of the pasta water just in case I wanted to add it, and I'm glad I did.  Once, I got all of the pasta, cheese, & herbs in the pan I decided that a little bit of the pasta water would give the pasta the exact consistency I was looking for.  I did not measure how much I used, but it was probably about 1 Tbls maybe 2.   I served this w/ broccoli as well.  We will have this again!!!!

The pasta was delicious but the tilipia left something to be desired.   Even though I more than doubled the seasonings, it was still bland.  The seaoning is really important when cooking tilapia because it is such a mild fish.  I would not make the fish again, but I will definitely make the pasta as a side with parmesan crusted tilapia (very easy to make: 1/2 C grated parm, 1 Tbsp garlic powder, 1 C panko crumbs, 1 tsp oregano, 1 egg, beaten: dip in egg wash, coat with combined dry ingredients and cook in heated light olive oil over meduim heat 4 min each side).

This was a very good recipe. I followed it almost exactly, except the cilantro. It's not something I keep on hand. next time I might try penne pasta instead of macaroni. I think it would lend itself better to the dish. Thanks for a great recipe.

What a great little recipe!  I did increase the amounts of seasoning to 1/2 tsp of each spice for the fish - except cilantro which I didn't have.  For the pasta I used 1/8 tsp of each spice for my "pinch".  We enjoyed this very, very much.  The flavors mingle together beautifully.  The best tilapia recipe I've found so far on this site.

I really liked the flavour of this fish - it was light and refreshing.  I did 1 tsp of each spice (except cilantro cause I didn't have any - and salt and pepper of course I just added to my liking) - a pinch didn't seem like enough.  The pasta was pretty good - I think next time I will add some red pepper flakes for some heat, a little more lemon and some of the pasta water so it's not as dry.  I will make this again with a few changes for sure!

It was okay. The flavour was good, but the look was terrible. Beige with a side of beige. I served it with mixed roasted veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and snow peas), which helped the appearance a bit. It was fairly quick and easy, although it took a little juggling to have it all ready and hot at close to the same time. My husband liked it (especially the pasta).

For me, this recipe was quick and easy (only took 10 mins from prep to eating!) but nothing to write home about, however my husband RAVED about it and called it restaurant quality. I omitted the cilantro and got the pan oil really hot before I added the fish, which gave the tilapia a really nice blackened look. I will definitely make this recipe again, but I'll keep tweaking it.

This recipe was great and easier than I expected.  This was my first time cooking Tilapia and everyone loved it.  I used lime juice because I didn't have any lemon and I used fettuccine instead of elbow mac and served with cut steamed asparagus.  I wasn't going to use the pasta recipe at first but decided to try it and was glad that I did because it was a great compliment to the fish.  Everyone who tried this said it was a 5 star recipe.

Very simple and very good. I doubled everything and was engough for three people. I also used shredded Parmesan about a cup worth,the wife and I have a cheese thing. Worth making again, if you like seasoning just add more then a pinch I think thats why some felt it was too blan.

i gave this a five star because it was so easy and i had everything on hand.  i used a mixture of pasta's that I had left over in my pantry.  Next time will use fresh garlic and maybe some fresh herbs.  I did not have cilantro..I think that would of added a strange taste to italian style dish.  The pasta if very similar to pasta Aglio Olio which is an italian classic.  When I make this again I will add crushed red pepper to spice it up some. I will for sure make again with my own twist

A good basic receipe and very easy to make. However, fresh herbs are much better than the dried pencil shavings you use from the spice rack (except oregano). Try it with all fresh ingredients...the flavour is more intense and it adds more colour to the plate (as another reveiwer commented on presentation).

Absolutely deeeeelish! I made only a few substitutions by also adding a pinch of garlic powder to the fish and I used a heaping 1/4 tsp for all the herbs in both the fish and pasta. I also had to use Fontina cheese instead of Parm because that's what we had on hand. I also used grape seed oil instead of olive oil.   My husband who is not a very adventurous eater loved this dish as well. The flavors were just amazing. I will definitely make this dish again in the near future.

I only made the tilapia, and I didn't make it exactly as instructed. I sprinked one side of the tilapia with lemon juice then sprinled the herbes on the fish until covered. Then put the fish herb side down in a non-stick pan and cooked it on med-high heat until there was a little color. While that side was cooking I covered the up side with the herbs. Flipped it over. Then hit it with a little more lemon juice. Only needed to cook for a minute or 2 on that side. Not fussy and so delish.

The fish was realllllly good, but I didn't care for the pasta - dry and bland. I will probably make the fish again, but with some other pasta recipe.

Loved it.  I served it was salad (no pasta) because I didn't want the carbs.  I used fresh basil instead of dried because I had it and didn't have any cilantro so I skipped that.  Everything else was the same.

Oregano and black pepper never excite me, but I tried the recipe and in the end I sprinkled on pomegranate balsamic vinegar to add a touch of sweetness without added sugar.

Not our favorite, the fish was a little bland. I also had a problem with the parmesan clumping at the bottom of the pan. If I did this again I would save a little pasta water, add the seasonings and olive oil then sprinkle the parmesan cheese over the past once it was plated.

Quick and easy-great flavor, perfect for any busy person who wants something decent to eat. My 7 yr old said she is willing to eat it again, although it isn't one of her favorites. I would cut the amount of olive oil-I didn't need that much in my pan for the fish, and the amount for the pasta seemed a little much. I think it would be adaptable for other tastes and the pasta would be good with other fish, or chicken or a light summer beef. So with a little tweeking this could be an excelent healthy dinner. Add some bright veggies for color and nutrition.  When making it for myself and my daugher I had enough pasta left over for my lunch the next day

I made some adjustments. I hardly ever measure spices only less I'm baking. I did an even coat of lemon juice and seasoning on each side of the tilapia. Used fettuccine noodles, left some water in the pot when I was done cooking the noodles, 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, added a thin layer of garlic powder, few light squeezes of lemon juice, and nickle sized seasoning. Served with Corn, Carrot and Asparagus steamers. It was a hit!

I followed the recipe but for a screwup with the grated v. shredded parm which required me to use some of the pasta water.  The pasta was delightful, loved it.  The fish alone needed more, I'm not sure what, just more. Fortunately, there was sauce left over to spoon over the fish.  I will probably make again, but try to make more sauce.

Baked, as per a previous reviewer, 375 for 12 minutes.  The seasoning on the fish complimented it very well.  The pasta itself was a little lemony, so I will probably cut the lemon juice next time for the pasta.  Everything else was delicious!  I used whole grain pasta, so this was a very WW friendly recipe!

The seasoning gave this bland fish some kick, but I don't think I'll be buying Tilapia anytime soon.  The pasta accent was a different spin on buttered noodles...the kids loved them.

Very, very good.  Used a cast-iron skillet to sear the fish.  Sauteed 3 (small) cloves of garlic in the olive oil for the pasta and mixed all the pasta ingredients together before adding to the cooked farfalle (bowtie) pasta (instead of macaroni), along with a pinch of lemon zest.  Fast to make, easy, and great flavor.

I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe because all of the seasonings in it and I thought my kids would say "whats all the green stuff?"  Boy was I wrong!!  This was amazing!!  So delicious!  I made this as is and I doubled the recipe and my kids wanted more! Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again for sure!

I loved this. Made it for dinner tonight, using mozzarella instead since I was out of Parmesan. Definitely a keeper for future dinners on the go!

I enjoyed this recipes. There wasn't a WOW factor but it is definitely delicious, satisfying, and EASY. The only thing I added as a dash of cooking white wine when I started the fish. Will do again.

I always read the reviews before I try it or save it and although this was not a five star it sounded good to me. Have an abundance of Tilapia so always looking for new ways to cook it always. The first time I did it I did not have lemon juice but key lime juice was in hand and did not have elbow mac but did have bow tie (small) and I did double the spice mixture for both the fish and the Mac. and fallowed the recipe for cooking I have printed this recipe for 10 days now and it is so good I have cooked it 4 times all with different pasta bow tie, angle hair and penne . the last time I did it with elbow pasta kind of disappointed bow tie was the best and it adds the class look to the dish this recipe deserves all in all pretty good don't over cook the fish and you cant go wrong.

This was really quick and easy and my guys loved it! I also added more than a "pinch" of everything and I thew a (leftover) 1/2 can of diced tomatoes into the pasta mix.

Very good recipe--I lightly floured the Tilapia before cooking and added more lemon juice, pasta water and herbs to the pasta.  This turned out great!

I like cooking the tilapia better on the stove than baking in the oven. This dish is light, yet filling. And the spices make it even better than when I used to use just EVOO, salt and pepper!

This is SO delicious! The lightness of the fish mixes with the richness of the cheese in the pasta perfectly! My husband and I have been trying to eat healthier and choose more fish over red meats and this will most definitely be made again. Fabulous! :)

This was very good. I added some panko breadcrumbs to store-bought seasoned breadcrumbs to give it a little crunch, which worked well. My wife & kids hate fish & this was by far my most successful experiment - they all agreed it was good. In particular, I think the pasta & parmesan/breadcrumb coating really helped them get past their mental block for fish & just focus on the taste. It'll take a few more meals with this recipe, but I think I've finally found a way to have fish at my table, thanks!

This recipe has great flavor. I added a little cajun spice to the fish to give it a little kick. I forgot to save a little of the water from the spaghetti as one reader suggested. the dryness kept me from giving it five stars. Served with garlic toast and salad

Fish turned out great, very tasty, but the pasta was quite boring. I'll definitely do just the fish next time with a different side dish.

I give this a 4 star rating because it was a great meal for very little effort.  The flavors were great.  I used lemon zest (@ 1 tsp) instead of the lemon juice on the pasta for a more lemony flavor.  I agree that the pasta could use more olive oil than called for to keep the pasta from getting dry.

Very good.  All I had was angel hair pasta, however it turned out delicious.  I added about double the garlic, olive oil, and parmesan cheese to the pasta, and followed the rest of recipe as it states.  I'll be making this again.

SO yummy!!! While my hubby felt the fish itself was a little bland, he REALLY enjoyed the pasta! On the contrary, I liked both the fish AND pasta (what does the hubs know anyway lol???). Having said this, you DO need to double the spices on the fish to get even the slightest flavor, but that's just my $.02. I think I'd even go as far as suggesting that the spices (sans the s&p) be tripled or quadrupled. Other than tinkering with the spice blend, this is super yummy - a light yet filling healthful meal. A side of steamed broccoli drizzled with a bit of lemon juice complemented this nicely. Thanks for sharing this hidden gem on here, vo0do0. Mucho deliciosio! :)

This was super tasty!! My husband and I are not big fans of fish, but are trying to find creative ways to add it to our menus for the health benefits. This was definitely one we will be making again :)

OH...
MY...
GOODNESS!!
SOOOOOO GOOD!
My wife hates pasta, and LOVES TILAPIA. I hate fish, but LOVE PASTA and cod, so I made a few changes to this recipe. 
FIRSTY!!!! I used cod instead of tilapia. CPT. HILIGNER makes A GREAT frozen cod filet that I LOVE using in recipes. 
SECOND!!! CUT out the cilanto. Not needed! I'm not making Guacamole!!!! LOL!!!
THIRD!!! Instead of dried herbs, FRESH FRESH FRESH! That's the way to do it!
ALSO if you have a chance, this recipe is great when served with nacho chips and guacamole instead of pasta!

This tilapia is amazing.  We do it without the cilantro, but other than that, exactly to the recipe.  It's super easy and fast, and very inexpensive, too!  It's easy to make just as much as you need.  I can make it for myself, or for a crowd in about the same amount of time.  It's really the best tilapia recipe out there.  And chances are you have everything you need already.  So try it already!

I made this for supper last night, and it was really easy. I served it over penne instead of elbows. (And just as a note for those who complained about the monotone colors of the dish, try multi-coloured pasta, or add some veggies to the pasta if it really bothers you that much.) I cut the olive oil that goes in the pasta in half; it was plenty. And I think I could have doubled the lemon juice that goes into the pasta; it was too subtle. I put half the cheese in the pasta, then the remainder I sprinkled on top of the fish. The fish itself was nice, but I'd prefer a slightly stronger flavor. My husband on the other hand, said the flavor was too peppery (but he's a bit of a wuss... a real Turkey-on-white kinda guy, so I don't heed that much). I'll use this basic recipe again, but more as a base that I can tinker with and change each time I make it. White or brown rice might be a nice swap for the pasta, or a bed of cooked veggies! Yum! Grilled veggies under grilled fish? Yes, please! :D
I'd probably add stronger (but less "peppery") flavors to the fish, maybe a marinade, or I could brush it with honey or lime. The seasonings given were great choices. I might just cut the pepper from my hubby's fillet and it'd be fine for his pansy palate.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was instead of elbow macaroni I used whole wheat Penne. I kept everything else the same and it was incredible.  Thanks for the great recipe. :)

Excellent and easy...I'd definitely make this again!  I used a half teaspoon of the seasonings for the fish and an eighth of a teaspoon of the seasonings for the pasta.  I didn't have macaroni noodles and used mini penne noodles instead.  Oh, and I didn't have the cilantro, so I just left that out.  So good!

I loved this recipe!  It was really easy...I added extra servings of the suggested seasonings, used fresh cilantro, and used Old Bay Seasoning as well.  I also served it over a bed of Fettuccine Alfredo.  My husband said the extra seasoning really gave the fish some flavor.

My husband & I both thought this was really yummy! It's kind of a mild flavor, so it could have maybe had a stronger ingredient, but the serving size is perfect for 2 people.

Very light in flavor but i liked it. A fresh squeeze of lemon over the top of the fish and extra parmesan cheese over pasta did the trick.

Easy and tasty, DH & I enjoyed it.  I probably used a bit more lemon juice, and had fresh cilantro which was a nice fresh looking & tasting garnish.

Absolutely loved it. I like how it was very light but flavorful. I think the lemon with the pasta gave it a nice zest. I also liked how simple the whole dish was. I did add a bit of old bay to the fish (me and my boyfriend LOVE old bay) and I didn't have fresh parmesan cheese so I used the kraft grated cheese... next time I'll definitely buy the fresh cheese, it would have probably made this dish ten times better!!!

Followed the directions as written, except for substituting whole wheat egg noodles for the elbow pasta. Pasta was a little too dry & bland, so we ended up adding chopped tomatoes as a garnish. Won’t be a recipe we make again, but I could see how kids might like it?

The lemon seems to bring out the fishiness of the Tilapia. Our family favorite is the black pepper Tilapia recipe. Gave it 2 stars since its not a bad recipe; it's just not for my family.

It was decent; not terribly flavorful. Would probably be better if the tilapia was parmesan breaded, and it needs a sharper cheese than parmesan.

The basis of this dish is really good. I'm eating very healthy right now so i baked mine with the seasonings and just a rub of olive oil on a bed of seasoned asparagus in foil and then made my pasta with  white wheat low carb spaghetti noodles and olive oil. I cut the parm to 3 tbl spoons for about 6 oz pasta and added the herbs and seasonings and it was great.  The flavor was there.

Made as the recipe stated, except I skipped the cilantro. Delicious! Both my husband and I loved it. Our new go-to tilapia weeknight meal.

This is really a wonderful fish and great pasta combination. After dressing fish with seasonings and lemon, I dredged it in a little flour and pan fried it in EVOO.  After fettuccini pasta was al dente (drained and held out), I put EVOO in the pan with a fresh clove of garlic minced (cooked briefly), some wild hedgehog and oyster mushrooms (that we harvest wild, lightly sautéed in EVOO and froze in single servings when they were fresh) then seasonings (no cilantro/ personal preference), returned the pasta, then added the lemon and parmesan cheese.  I luckily doubled the pasta part so I will get to enjoy this all week.  I have to say the wild mushrooms were really good in this, yet I felt they were mild enough to not overpower the seasonings and lemon and cheese.  I think this is so quick and wonderful that I can make this with fresh pan fish and mushrooms in the summer.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Definitely a keeper. It was easy and quick to make and tasted delicious. I made it to serve 4, so I increased the tilapia and pasta. In full disclosure, I also left out the cilantro because I don't care for it. This will become a go-to fish recipe for me. I think both the fish and pasta recipes could stand alone and be used frequently at my house.

I made it as written and we liked it. The pasta had great flavor. The fish was good but needed more seasoning.  

I would recommend a different pasta: like rotini, rigatoni or even penne. The elbow macaroni left a lot of the cheese and seasoning in the pan. 

This is a great basic/starter recipe that's why I gave it  four stars.

Taste: I made without cilantro (I thought I had some and it had gone bad in the fridge). I added extra fresh basil to the pasta and just used half a lemon's juice on the tilapia and the other half in the pasta. Subtle basil/parmesan with a light fish and a heavy pasta with a side of asparagus tied with lemon: very delish. Didn't need extra pepper. Husband (who is picky about heavy foods) loved it. Not fishy at all.

Presentation: Beige on beige and the fish didn't brown well. Added extra fresh basil. and server steamed asparagus between pasta base and fish top to give it a pretty look.

Ease: My husband who, god bless his soul, has trouble with pancakes handled this very well. It's easy to season and taste as you go. Texture is easy to monitor and everything goes in 4 minute cycles so there's no timer overlap.

Very EASY recipe to follow. I did make a few changes as I am allergic to I used Go Veggie Parmesan; no basil; added ground red pepper for a KICK!! I also used Smart Balance dairy free butter instead of olive oil in the noodles. Turned out AMAZING! My family is asking for more. This WILL BE ADD TO MY WEEKLY DINNER ROTATION!

This was so good, made it along side with some steamed broccoli.  I did forget to put in the lemon in the pasta and added a little pasta water in the noodles.  Definately going to make this again, so easy!

I made this recipe you this evening. The pasta was too dry. It needs a sauce with a cream or yogurt or something to go over the noodles because it just was a little too dry.  However, the fish was good.

Good, but definitely needs additional seasoning. A pinch of each spice is not enough. I more than doubled the spices in both the fish and the pasta. I also reduced the olive oil for the fish to 1 tbsp and that was plenty. You really need to crank up the heat to medium high to get any kind of crust on the fish. This made more than two servings (three adult servings for us), unless you have a huge appetite. Serve it with a vegetable or salad.

Loved this recipe! I don't typically eat fish with pasta, but this was a great meal for one! I am single but I like to cook. The portions for this recipe are great! I did add a few vegetables(asparagus, squash and mushrooms) to the pasta, because I did not want them to go to waste and it was a great addition to the pasta! I have my leftovers for tomorrow, but I will add a piece of feta-cheese sausage to the pasta!

It was fast but bland. For the pasta, I had to add more olive oil and flavor (garlic salt is the best!). I cooked the tilapia longer than 6 minutes each side and it still tasted "fishy". It's a small dish that will make you feel light. I also served it with a small ceasar salad.

This recipe is SO good. My husband absolutely loved it. I didn't really follow measurements for the spices. I eyed what I wanted. I also baked the tilapia at 375 degrees until it was slightly brown on the edges and it worked out perfect! The pasta was great. I used different noodles than elbow. I used cellantini and added pasta water like a previous reviewer mentioned. It would also be great with Alfredo sauce. Next time I'm making extra!

This is pretty good, even though I am not a big fan of tilapia.  My variation was to add capers for extra color and flavor and a little light butter to the noodles.

The fish was fantastic, lots of flavor and the citrus hint is really refreshing. The pasta, on the other hand, needs some TLC and some alterations.
All and all a great fish recipe but only an OK pasta recipe.

I'm not a huge fish fan, and I thought this was a little bland, but my husband really enjoyed it. I did like the seared method which left some of the edges a little crispy. We are trying toner more fish, so I will probably make this again! We had mango and strawberries with it for a nice, light dinner.

Just made this for my family of five, good starter recipe. Next time I will add fresh basil and tomatoes, maybe some garlic to the pasta, it was just lacking a little. Served it with grilled asparagus. Kids loved it.

Okay so I tried this recipe without the garlic powder, salt, or pepper. Crazy I know right. But it was good! Not as flavorful as it would have been, but definitely a success. I suggest using cilantro and basil leaves instead of dried. Also, actual garlic instead of garlic powder, it adds more of a naturally tasty flavor. (: Also, I cooked the fish with white wine, DELICIOUS.

absolutely delicious! The dish holds true to the current rating; I knew it would be a good recipe, but even so, I was surprised by just how good it came out. Easily one of my favorite fish recipes I have ever eaten- full of flavor, light, and healthy. I ended up adding more spices than listed above to fit the size of my fillet and pasta servings. I also used whole grain pasta shells instead of macaroni and garnished the dish with fresh cilantro and lemon wedges. Will be making again and again :)

We are trying to eat healthier and I was searching recipes. This one popped up. Wow! This was awesome. The only thing that I did different was add some Tony's to the tilapia. After trying out so many different healthier recipes the man was very happy with this light yet savory dish.

made this w/out the pasta just sounded like a good fish recipe. I made it in the skillet and turned the heat up to high at the end and let the fish crisp up on each side for less than a minute. This was one of the best Tilapia recipes Ive tried, delicious!!

This is definitely a keeper I always go heavy on my seasonings anyway the fish had plenty of flavor and I used fresh cilantro but all the rest of my herbs were dried and after I made my plate  I squeezed more fresh lemon juice on it. Was delish

This dish was very light and tasty, but the pasta was a bit too dry so i added some chicken broth and it was just right!

I give the tilapia a "5", but the pasta seemed to lack a little, how do I say this, more bang. I may try this again with butter instead of the olive oil. I'm a vegan and I cooked the tilapia for my husband, and he absolutely loved the simplicity of how the flavors collided. I will update you when I try the pasta again with butter, rather than oil. :)

Very good recipe. Super tasty!   Made with fresh cilantro, and pre-grated parmesan cheese.  Substituted oregano with Italian herbs and also added a pinch of Fine Herbs for the fish. We didn't have garlic powder, so used fresh garlic.

I left out the lemon juice because I didn't have it.  Left out the macaroni too.  Lightly brushed the fish with olive out to make the seasonings stick.  Used Italian seasoning instead of basil because I didn't have that.  Was GREAT!  I'm not a fan of lemon on chicken or fish.  My hubby liked it crisper than the picture shows.

This recipe was very tasty the only thing I felt was a little off was after i made the tilapia I felt that it needed a bit of salt. I also had a little problem with the tilapia crumbling when I took it out the pan. However all that aside it was terrific I will be making it again!

we liked the pasta a lot but the tilapia wasn't great. however, i did omit the cilantro (didn't have any) and these fillets tasted particularly fishy, so it may not be the recipe's fault.

The tilapia was excellent and very easy to make.  The pasta was definitely missing something, so I will try something different next time for the pasta.
