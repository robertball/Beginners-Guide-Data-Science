I enjoyed this very much. I'm considering using banana flavored pudding next time.

I did not have instant lemon pudding but I did have instant cheesecake pudding. I used that instead. I did add in one more cup of chopped strawberries and two more chopped kiwi. This is a very nice fluffy salad--the kids and I loved it........I can't stop eating it. This is even better if it sits overnight, if you can wait that long to dig into it.

This is very good. It maybe had a few too many marshmallows, but that didn't keep me from getting a second helping. I also liked putting just a bit of whipped cream on top. DH is allergic to kiwi, so I had to leave that out. Kiwi would have added a nice bit of color to it though.

This was very yummy!  Very easy to make.  I didn't have any strawberries or kiwis, but I did add some cool whip and it's delicious!  Thank you for this recipe.
