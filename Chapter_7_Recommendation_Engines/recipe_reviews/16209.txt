This is a delicious and easy recipe!  We are always watching those calories, so I am an avid modifier.  I give this 5 stars after these modifications:  substitute 2/3 of the oil with apple sauce, use 1/4 cup eggbeaters for every egg, use low or no-fat yogurt, use skim milk.  This brings the fat% to less than 15% without hurting the flavor.  

Using whole wheat instead of all purpose flour will increase the fiber 3-fold and adds a robust flavor.  I grind my own which means that it is fresh & chocked full of extra flavor & nutrients, too.  Whole wheat has fewer calories and more protein, too.

Addressing the comments of others, we thought the cinnamon was not overpowering -- in fact I might add more next time.  It only took minutes to prepare, just the time to quickly peel an apple which is a breeze with the good peeler Santa brought me.  And as far as knowing when to turn the pancakes, give them a little shove with the spatula -- if they easily move around, you can safely turn them.  If they seem to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down a little.  I found that medium high, but more towards medium than high was the best setting for me after making all of these changes.

Oh my goodness! These are so good! I substituted 1 cup of flour for oats for extra fiber and added the remaining amount of flour. I used applesauce instead of oil, and I added about a half teaspon of apple pie spice. I used light plain yogurt. And instead of chopping my apple, I grated it. I also added artificial sweetner to the batter. If you choose to use sugar, try with about 1 tablespoon at first.

These were very good pancakes! I found the cinnamon to be the perfect amt (it is my signature spice) and instead of chopping an apple, I grated it into the batter. Plus, I'm not sure why other people thought this is a time-consuming recipe because it only took me minutes to make.  My ONLY complaint is that they were not as fluffy as other pancakes I've made before.  Still, I would make this again and I loved the way my house smelled from these! Thanks Bonnie!

The kids like it but I will cut my apples smaller next time. At first they were aprehensive about these chunks in their pancakes and I added 2 TBS wheat germ to make it even healthier and it doesn't change the flavor.
Very good recipe.  A change from the regular pancakes was needed here!

Pretty good.  If you're looking for a ready in 5 min. breakfast, this isn't the one.  I had trouble telling when they were ready to flip.  It doesn't usually bubble until it has already burnt a little.

Man did we love these pancakes!!! All I had on hand was peach yogurt so I threw that in instead and it worked out great!  I used a little more apple than was called for and every bite was a piece of heaven.  Our leftovers (what little we had left) were rather moist the next day so we popped them in the oven and crisped them up.  Delicious!!

I don't think these pancakes are worth the going to the trouble of peeling and chopping an apple.  The pancakes seem heavy, dark (from the amount of cinnamon), and the flavor of the apple is overpowered by too much cinnamon.  I would not make these pancakes again.

Great pancake recipe! I read through the reviews before I made it and a few people thought they could have been fluffier, so I doubled the baking powder and baking soda. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. These turned out moist, flavorful and with the addition of the extra baking powder/soda, very fluffy. I think it could use a little more apple, but that's really a personal choice. I served these pancakes with homemade maple vanilla pancake syrup. I'll make these again with the doubled baking powder/soda--we really enjoyed them. NOTE: I think this would work well with a cup of sourdough starter. I think I might try this next time, cutting a cup of milk out and substituting a cup of starter. I'll try that tomorrow and update my review after.

These made a tasty pancake and not any more difficult than your traditional recipe. The yogurt definitely helped them stay nice and moist, and they were really filling. My girlfriend says they're the best pancakes I've made yet (and I make a lot of pancakes!).  I did make a few changes to the recipe though, since I wanted a sweeter pancake than it called for. I substituted the vegetable oil for unsweetened apple sauce, added a 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and cloves, and also added about 2 or 3 tbsp of white sugar. Next time I would definitely use a fairly "light" plain yogurt (I used Balkan-Style) and sift my flour too, since they were a little heavy otherwise!  So overall a great recipe, once tweaked a little bit. Glad I stumbled on it :)

Thought these were a little light on flavor, so the second time I made them I doubled the salt. Made a huge difference. Also twice as much apple. Cook SLOWLY (med-low) for best results.

Maybe I did something wrong, they tasted good but they were very heavy an rubbery.  I don't think that I will make these again because I don't know what I could do to improve consistancy.  Barb in BC Canada.

Great recipe!  Followed the recipe as is.  Makes a thick, semi dense pancake but it's still soft and fluffy.  Good taste :).

I think this recipe is great!  I used unsweetened almond milk and 1 cup wheat flour in my version.  This really made enough for 6 people!  Between my two boys and I, we have 4 servings left.

Oh my goodness this is delicious! I substituted oil for Apple sauce and used granny smith apples. The flavor was really strong. I also cut all of the ingredients in half and I came out with more than enough pancakes.

I thought this was a fantastic, simple recipe- the yogurt made them a lot creamier and had great flavor. Also ran out of flour so used 1.75 c. and a handful of oats- actually better and not as thick as everyone mentioned- all gobbled right up at brunch!

This recipe is great!  I did make some substitutions--oats for half of the flour amount and fresh strawberries instead of apple.  I also added more cinnamon and a pinch of sumac.  They were soooo delicious!  Q and I loved them and he doesn't normally have a sweet tooth.

Ehh, OK. Heavy, odd texture, and not a whole lot of flavor. I'll add some brown sugar as other reviewers have suggested and try it again, but don't have high hopes.

Pancakes are quite dense and filling.  I found them perhaps a bit thick...I might try adding a bit more milk next time.  I used homemade yogurt. I also used about 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and the rest all purpose.  I used about 1 1/2 apples, and I think it would be fine to use 2 whole ones.  These were a nice switch from our normal recipe.

I have been making these pancakes for a couple years now.  They are so much healthier than normal pancakes (especially if you use applesauce in place of oil) and they don't get boring after the first 3 bites either.  They don't sit so heavy in the tummy and have a great taste!

I made specifically to use for training treats for the dogs. They are healthy and wholesome. The humans however complained that they didnt get any! So I made a batch for the family and a seperate batch for the dogs. They are very tasty and freeze beautifully!

I replaced milk with unsweetened almond milk, used non-fat greek yougurt and shredded my apple. The pancakes were a bit soft in the middle, but the overall flavor was very good. Thanks!

I had high hopes for this recipe, as we enjoy our traditional German apple pancakes each weekend. Unfortunately, this recipe didn't compare. Instead of including the cinnamon in the recipe, I sprinkled it on top with some sugar. This left the pancakes tasting a little bland. In addition, I used grated Gala apples, which didn't pack the punch I had hoped for.  I suggest thinly slicing the apples and placing them into the batter once in the pan. This not only looks great, but delivers a tasty amount of apple in each bite :)

These are good! I used dried apples and added a banana and some vanilla. A great way to use up some extra yogurt!

Yum Yum Yum! I think it would taste great with some raisins sprinkled in too. Next time I will add that and maybe some walnuts also.

This pancake is very good, I certainly will make these again. As mentioned in prior reviews these pancakes are dense but not overpoweringly so. It's just the right amount of denseness. In my opinion this adds to the overall heartiness of the pancake. They do bubble when ready to be turned but not as much as the store bought mixes. I also found thaby using a griddle these pancakes were forgiving if my attention was turned elsewhere. As long as they are over a low medium heat they come out perfect. My only complaint is that the apple did not come thru as much as I'd hoped. I used a mcintosh apple perhaps next time I'll use a granny smith. Also the pancakes were a bit bland. Next time I will add a bit of vanilla extract and maybe a smidge of nutmeg and sugar. Just to jazz up the flavor. All in all it's a great base recipe guaranteed to warm your heart on a cold, yucky morning.

Loved these pancakes! They had a nice soft texture, combined with a little firmness from the apples. The flavor was a nice change from regular pancakes. I'll definitely make them again.

I would make these again.  I'd take Apple Yogurt Pancakes any day over plain old pancakes.  We made a half batch last night for dinner, accompanied with a veggieham omelet, and it was quick and good.  It did make 3 servings, and I reheated the last serving this morning for breakfast.  I did shred the apple and not chop it.  Easy to make, not time involved at all.  Peeling an apple is not hard work.

Excellent alternative to plain pancakes!  I added 2 tablespoons of Splenda, 1/2 cup walnuts, and doubled the cinnamon and apple quantities which made them slightly sweet.  The same basic recipe would work with other fruits such as bananas or berries, so variations are endless.  Very very good!

I made them according to the original recipe, used vanilla yogurt and a golden delicious apple.  I thought they were pretty bland, but OK.  My toddler put away two of them though, so I will keep making them for her.  Next time I will try adding a little more spice to the batter.

I made a haf batch (just to use up leftover yogurt).  I used applesauce instead of apples.  They were so yummy, I bought more yogurt, made a full batch and froze them.  They toast well once frozen -- I think the yogurt keeps them moist.  Yummy.

I was looking foward to making these.  I sub'ed applesauce for the oil, kept everthing the same, not sweet at all, which I guess is OK, but the kids were not big fans!  It was yummy with maple syrup, I guess you have to play with the ingrediants a little if you want sweet.

I did not care for this recipe as it is. I had to make a bunch of additions before I was finally somewhat satisfied. I added more spices, more apple, about a 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/2c of oats. I thought the original recipe was bland. My family likes sweeter pancakes.

I am trying to find healthy breakfast options for my children and myself. This is difficult because I like sweets. I loved the pancakes after my modifications. I added just enough sugar to give it a little bit of sweetness but not overwhelming. My children liked these pancakes very much! Here are my substitutions:  I used 1 ¼ cup WHEAT FLOUR + 1 ¼ cup ALL PURPOSE FLOUR; added 2 tablespoons of SPLENDA; APPLESAUCE instead of OIL; used SKIM MILK, LOW FAT YOGURT; I SHREDDED the APPLES and to make sure they ended up FLUFFY, I let the DOUGH SIT in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. These are good cold or for next day also.

WOW! Everyone in my family loved these pancakes.  Even my picky 3 year old ate 3 of them. I did change the recipe a little, though.  I was worried about apple chunks in the pancakes after reading some reviews, so after peeling the apples, I cut them into chunks and cooked them in a little water and brown sugar.  They were softer and easier to make into smaller pieces after that, and the brown sugar added a little sweetness to the pancake. Because I cooked the apples in a small amount of water, I cut the milk in the recipe also.  I will DEFINITLY be making these pancakes often!

These were good, moist and yummy. I tweaked a bit as I wanted to make a smaller batch - used 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, 1 yogurt, 1/4 cup applesauce instead of oil, 1 heaping cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and grated a half peeled apple. They turned out just like I expected, rose well, good consistency and just the right sweetness and spice.

I love these!  The yogurt gives them a nice unexpected flavor.  If you're looking for a super sweet store bought commercial mix type pancake this isn't for you.  These are REAL pancakes made from scratch that are light and airy with a tiny bit of tang that plays nicely off of the cinnammon flavor.  The smaller you dice the apple the better it cooks and adds a nice touch to the texture.  Will be making these again and again :)

These are very good.  I used my apple slicer corer and then used my salad shooter so in about 2 min. I had my apples done...Easy...and I got my 4 year old who does not like fruits to eat them.  Thank you for a different pancake recipe.

I deviated from the recipe. 

I put 2/3 cup oats in the blender to make oat flour and cut the regular flour buy the same amount. 


And,  we didn't have baking powder so I used a little extra baking soda. 

I diced 2 small apples and sautéed them with maybe 1/8 cup brown sugar.  I also threw in 1/2 cup or so of crushed pecans into the apples. 

Oh, no oil so I used butter to cook them in. 

Very fluffy as you can see in the photo.  and really,  really good!

I made these to the recipe the first time. They were really good. My only issues were I cut the apples too large. The second time I shredded the apples. I also subbed a cups of oats for flour (ground the oats to resemble flour) and used 1 1/2 cups wheat flour. I also subbed one egg for a Tbsp flax seed meal and 3 Tbsp water. (I'm a nursing mother and try to add lactation help anywhere I can)

Loved them! I subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil and used 1 cup of oats to sub for 1 of the cups of flour (per another reviewers suggestion). They took awhile to cook, but they were well worth it. They were the perfect birthday breakfast for my little girl.

Good recipe!  I followed it mostly to a tee but made some modifications. First, I also grated the apple as did many others. Next time I would add more apple to the dish. The second was that I used Greek yogurt as it made the pancakes fluffier and lastly, I added a pinch of nutmeg to the mix, delicious!  To finish I topped with sliced apples, a spritz of fresh lemon and honey!  Would make again.

Was looking for a pancake to make without butter, and these were decent.  Subbed GF flour, so I needed to hydrate the batter a bit more with some applesauce and some extra milk.  I think they would have cooked more evenly if I had grated the apple in, but they were still enjoyable.

These are excellent! If you want a fluffier pancake and a teaspoon of vinegar. I used apple cider vinegar. I made these with a tropical twist using coconut yogurt in place of the plane and pineapples instead of apples. I omitted the cinnamon. My kids gobbled them up.

These pancakes are AMAZING!! I used strawberry yogurt instead of plain and only a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Great flavor without all the sugar. My kids loved them too. Even my picky 16 year old. Very happy to find this great recipe.

The batter is a little too thick for my liking, which made it hard to spoon into the pan, and cook. Also, not nearly enough apples for apple pancakes, in my opinion. We doubled the amount, and it was better. I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This is the second time I have made these pancakes and they are yummy! The only thing is they feel a bit heavy so next time I would add more milk or use less flour maybe. I also added a few cranberries to each pancake !

I'm sorry, but these were terrible. I made the pancakes as the recipe said and hey were very very bland. Without any sugar and not enough cinnamon I didn't like them one bit. I am a good pancake maker, but the texture of these were weird and the bites of apple were the only flavor in them. I wouldn't recommend or make them again.

Since the day I was allowed to help in the kitchen, I've hated recipes with a passion. This recipe is easily transformed from Apple to Peach, Strawberry, Apricot, Guava, you name it. When I made these I didn't have enough flour, so I adjusted it by eyeballing it. I forgot the salt, but they turned out like crepes! My family said they were some of the best things they ever ate. Try to add different yogurt and fruit for different flavors (peaches and raspberry yogurt is one of my favorites). Overall a great recipe.

I found these to be incredibly bland.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed, but they basically had no flavor at all.  I get the feeling they would be better if served with melted butter, but that defeats any attempt to eat lightly.

I followed the recipe except didn't have milk so used almond milk which could have been the reason why the pancakes were just ok.  They were moist and texture was right however they were missing something.  I would try these again and try to add something to make them a touch sweeter I think.  But all in all they were good.

This recipe is a win! I substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil, and added a little more cinnamon.

This recipe makes a dense, filling pancake.  It is very delicious and so far also seems to freeze well.  I grated my apple rather than dicing it to save time.

Well mine turned out mushy (the batter smelled wonderful and was tasty what i could eat of it).  The mushiness may be due to some substitutions so i didn't want to rate the recipe low but i wanted to warn others.  So i substituted half of the flour with oat flour, used almond milk instead of milk, used egg beaters instead of eggs, used greek yogurt for the yogurt cause that's all we eat and used applesauce instead of oil.  Typically these substitutions work for me so i wasn't worried but something didn't work because no matter how low and how long i cooked them they just never cooked through (although the outside looked done) so i had to throw out the whole batch.  :-(

I'm no pancake coinneuseur, so perhaps you should take this review with a grain of salt.  I thought they were fine, but regular pancakes.  Then again, maybe that's bc I used our complete pancake mix just to get rid of it.  Still, since the ingredients pretty much match it, I'm a little skeptical.  They were good, and I like the apple pieces and the yogurt, but I didn't see that they were any more moist than other pancakes.  Still, its a versatile recipe and bf liked them.  I used strawberry yogurt--no plain yogurt in the house--and it worked just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love these pancakes.  I make them with homemade yogurt which is very tart.  I add between 1/4 to 1/2 cup of crushed walnuts to this.  The walnuts give a nice balance to the sweetness of the apple.  I make them every Sunday morning.  They are great for when the weather turns chilly.

Great way to use up some homemade yogurt!  I made it with half wheat flour to add a little more nutritional value, and chopped the apples into tiny pieces.  The kids loved it - this one is staying in my recipe book!

This was just okay. The best thing about these is that they're still pretty good when cold or reheated. 
My favourite pancake recipes on allrecipes are still Easy Pancakes and Oatmeal and Wheat Flour Blueberry Pancakes.

I was making these pancakes for my kids in the 1970's and they loved them!  I also shredded the apple which gave a more even apple taste.

These pancakes were good.  I only had low fat strawberry yoghurt on me, but this gave it extra flavour.  My bf did complain that he thought it was too much extra flavour, but still gobbled his pancakes up.  Next time I'll try to get plain or vanilla yoghurt, and I think I'll grate the apples rather than chop, but other than that I wouldn't change anything.

Great recipe!!! The cakes were a beautiful color, texture was fluffy yet substantial and the taste was nice... not too sweet. I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and a dash of vanilla. The finished cakes were enjoyed with a bit of butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. YUM!

it's not the texture. it's the taste. these pancakes were terribly bland, and their fluffiness were only because i didn't follow your mixing techniques exactly. the apple bits in the pancakes were sweet and were the only saving point of these pancakes.

Should have listened to Karen! I have 7 people in my family. Usually if one doesn't like something, no problem, cause someone else will! NO ONE IN MY FAMILY would take a second bite! Not even to cover it with extra syrup!

They are really not bad, the only thing I found them a bit heavy, they are definitely not like those made with yeast. But very good for a change, plus do not take much time for cooking at all! Thanks.

Very good recipe.  The addition of yogurt makes the pancake light and fluffy despite having pieces of apple in it.  Leftover batter makes great pancakes the next day too!  My children did not like the bits of apple in their pancakes and preferred their pancakes plain.  I, however, loved my pancakes with a lot of apple.

I thought that these pancakes were pretty good. They were not at all hard to prepare and I liked the overall flavor. I thought that adding 1/2 cup sugar to the batter made these ten times better. They tasted pretty sour with out it. My picky husband said he would only give these 3 stars. He didn't like the actual pieces of apple in the pancakes, but that is one of the things I did like about this recipe. I don't think I'd make these again, but there are plenty of leftovers I will enjoy. This recipe made 15 very large and fluffy/thick pancakes for me. Thanks for the recipe!
