I love these sandwiches. I do omit the cumin, and add a little dill weed. I put the mixture on sourdough bread which is a little stronger than white. But these are really great!

I really enjoyed this sandwich. I added a little salt, season salt,  and dill weed. I think it was too much salt but I forgot season salt is also salt. It is so fresh and great. I put it on soft butter bread. Good stuff! Will definitely make again.

The use of cumin in this recipe gives it a very different taste from other cucumber sandwich fillings. Different doesn't mean bad...just not my favorite. I liked it though. I used it today for my lunch, a tea party for one with the bread cut in heart shapes.

All I could taste was was cream cheese.
