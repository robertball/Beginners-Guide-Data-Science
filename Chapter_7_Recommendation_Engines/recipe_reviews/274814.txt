These were really tasty. I cut up the chicken before marinating it. Just cooked the chicken in a pan. The salsa needed some additional salt, but I like my food salty.

made it tonight. very good but didn't really taste pineapple. All we tasted was hot sauce, didn't put that much either. I'll make again and experiment.
