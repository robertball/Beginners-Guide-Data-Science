Wow, just made this and it was really great!  I doubled the amount of fresh lemon juice and added a bit more onion powder and honey and the end result was just fabulous.  I also substituted extra virgin olive oil as I had no grape seed oil on hand. I served the dressing on a Greek salad made of spinach, chopped orange bell peppers, kirby cukes, red onion, feta, kalamata olives and tomatos from our garden.  The dressing has a great fresh and balanced taste with a bright, sweet and flavorful balance.  Thanks for making this great dressing recipe available as it will be a regular at our table!

I literally put this recipe together in 5 minutes.  I did up the Dijon mustard and honey to 1T each.  I only used 1T poppy seeds and very little salt.  I did not have grapeseed oil so I used evoo.  This was so good that I can't wait to have it again tomorrow after all the ingredients meld together.  Thanks for the "great" and easy dressing.

This isn't exactly what I was looking for, but it's close and it'll do and it tastes good. Next time, I'll use fresh onion & an extra teaspoon of honey, and mix with the mini food processor or immersion blender, with oil drizzled in to make a nicer emulsion.

This recipe is just perfect. I made a similar mix to the sweet kale salad mix they sell at the store and topped it with this because it doesn't have egg (which I am allergic to). It was delicious! It isn't creamy like the dressing that comes with the mix, but the flavor was great so I didn't mind at all and wasn't expecting it to be anyway.

What a great dressing.  Great for a change or to always have on hand.
