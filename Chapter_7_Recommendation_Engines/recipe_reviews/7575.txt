This icing was awful too!  I have been baking for years and this is the first time that I have broken an appliance baking!  The icing was so stiff it bent the beaters on the mixer!

Way too thin and runny!  I even chilled the mixture for a few hours and rebeat it before using, and it slid right off the cake. DO NOT USE THIS
