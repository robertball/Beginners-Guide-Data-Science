Excellent recipe. The bacon stuffing mixture was my favorite part.  Make sure to use a good balsamic for the sauce and you will have a delicious meal!

My family all loved this recipe.  I didn't have time to stuff, but I put the bacon topping on the chops and then covered it with sour cream.  If you love bacon, you'll love this!
