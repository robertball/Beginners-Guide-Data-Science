This recipe complimented our homemade pesto and our home made gnocchi very well! We used the Johnsonville Pork Chicken Sausage which was a pleasant change from the more fatty choices.

I have made this twice for my husband and me and we LOVE it! I couldn't find gnocchi in our grocery store so I made it with angel hair pasta and it is still good! You have to like garlic though! It is very easy to make and not alot of dirty dishes!

This was simple and tasty! I do have to agree w/ the reviewer that said the cream added nothing to it except for fat and calories, as it pretty much disappeared, so I'd eliminate that next time. Also, I used regular peas, b/c that's what I had on hand. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really tasty and fast.  I used less meat and added in an orange pepper (I had one that needed to be used up), frozen regular peas in place of the snap peas so my kids would eat them, and homemade pesto.  I tasted before and after adding the cream to see what I preferred and I ended up thinking it was not needed so next time I would not use it.   Next time I would also drain the meat very thoroughly before mixing everything because my end product was too greasy/oily for my taste.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was fast, easy and most of all flavorful. I used frozen baby peas as I already had them and we prefer them. I will be making this again but I will probably make my own pesto next time. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe needs some serious work. I made this because I wanted something new and I had all the ingredients to make this. To be polite it was not tasty at all.  My biggest problem is that I did not like the texture combination of the sausage with gnocchi.  I find that pesto on its own is quite delicious and adding the cream adding nothing to the recipe except calories and fat. If I were to do it again, I'd eliminate the meat and cream and add a heaping amount of fresh veggies.

A very easy delicious meal.  I didn't have some of the ingredients and substituted green pepper for red, artichoke salsa for the pesto, low fat yoghurt for light cream, and used turkey italian sausage.  My husband enjoyed it and told me I can make it again any time.

This was superb!  I made my own gnocchi from another member's (Manella) personal recipe and my own pesto from the last of my basil plant.  Once the gnocchi was cooked it went together in no time.  I used red and yellow peppers and frozen baby peas.  This will be made often this winter.  Thank again, Johnsonville!

Yummy, easy, fun.  Johnsonville scores again.  I had an orange bell pepper, so that's what I used, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  It certainly would be easy to adjust the recipe to your tastes and what veggies or pasta you have on hand.

Simple yet one of my favorite new recipes. This is absolutely amazing! I left out the cream, you could make it either way but it is more savory without it. This is a new family favorite we will make over and over again!

My boyfriend and I are a huge fan of gnocchi so I bookmarked this right away. I do not like snap peas so I added frozen peas and added a yellow pepper along with a red pepper. I used fresh Italian sausage from the local deli and added basil at the end. Delish!

This is a delicious dish.  I made homemade basil pesto and added roma tomatoes to the original dish because my husband doesn't like peas.  I also used low sodium turkey sausage that I bought from a local butcher. On top of that I finished it with a fat free half and half. Oh so yum!

Loved it! I thought it had great flavor and followed the recipe. I used homemade pesto which I think makes a huge difference. Fresh, flavorful basil is the star of the dish. I did also add home grown tomatoes roasted in olive oil last summer...diced up. The tomatoes really vamped up the flavor of the basil. I added light cream as it said too even though several reviews said it wasn't needed. The cream adds...well...creaminess to the whole dish so I don't think I'll leave that out. Thanks for sharing! This will definitely be made again!

This was an AMAZING recipe - so easy, so quick, and so gourmet.  I added fresh spinach and subbed snap peas with frozen peas.  Making this again for certain.(And I was OK with the amount of cream - I think it really added to the pesto.)

Love this! I couldn't find frozen gnocchi, so we made it with penne pasta. I am planning to make it again soon with homemade gnocchi! I made homemade pesto and made the recipe as is. It was delish with the penne pasta, so I imagine the gnocchi will put it over the top! Can't wait to try it like that. The hubs LOVED this and ate way too much hahaha Thanks, Johnsonville!

I really liked this. It certainly is quick and easy. I used my own homemade pesto, some red, yellow & orange peppers that I had on hand, and threw in some onion that I had left in the frig to use up. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I really liked how the light cream and pesto made a nice sauce that coated the gnocchi perfectly. Yum!

I used a cheese Gnocchi, and my family absolutely love it!  We didn't need to add any additional Parmesan.  It was great without it (and I LOVE Parmesan, so leaving that off is an oddity for me).  This was easy to make and looked and tasted like it came from a fine restaurant.

I thought this was very delicious and quick. I did add a small onion, diced. The recipe probably would have still been fine without it. I forgot to buy a red bell pepper, so had to settle for a green one that I had at the house. I imagine it did affect the taste slightly and certainly the beauty of the dish. I will definitely make this again, and next time I will be sure to get the red pepper.

Super good and super easy. I just used ground Italian sausage instead of removing the casings of Johnsonville brats.

This was very easy to make and my entire family loved it, which is not a very easy task in my house. I made the recipe as is, the only thing I changed was I could not find the sausage called for in the recipe so I used garlic and cheese sausage which was very good.

Awesome taste and texture all in a one dish meal. My husband even loved it and he usually dislikes everything. Easy to make but I would suggest adding more cream or water to moisten the dish a little bit. The gnocchi seems to soak up the sauce.
