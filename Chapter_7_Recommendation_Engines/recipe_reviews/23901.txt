This quiche is delicious! (I had doubts about the cottage cheese). I did not add the vegis listed, but used spinach, mushrooms and white onions to go along with the ham. Very good!

Mmmm...I used what I had on hand, which was diced potatoes, diced carrots, frozen peas, chopped onion and cooked, seasoned, chopped chicken.  Mixed that with the cottage cheese and egg whites, and since I did not have mozzarella, I topped with 3 Kraft Singles slices and grated parmesan the last 15 minutes or so of baking.  I used my round pie pan for this.  It came out DEEEElicious!  Easy and healthy!  I will make this again!

This was delicious.  It made for a nice light meal.  My only complaint is that the main ingredient for this quiche is cottage cheese and not eggs. But it was still very good.

This is a nice little dish. Works for breakfast or dinner.  No, it's not a traditional quiche--no crust, and quiche generally uses 3 eggs.  Having said that, though, if you want a traditional quiche, look for another quiche recipe.  The cottage cheese gives this a moister consistency than a regular quiche.  It's nice, I like it.  I didn't have the veggies called for, but I did have some frozen spinach, so I added that along with diced potatoes.  If I'd have thought about it, I would have added some diced tomatoes as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was pretty good and healthy. I used peas, a box of frozen spinach, onion and a couple of diced potatoes (cooked). Quite tastey! Will definetly use this idea again and mix up the vegies some more. Fed our family of 5 but no extras.

I made this recipe exactly the way it is listed. It was very delicious! I made it for my dad's senior citizen Christmas party and they devoured it! It's quick and delicious - and it looks pretty too!

Changed some of the veggies used for personal preference.  Not sure what went wrong, but it came out with a layer of liquid in the bottom of the pan.  This needs to be served as part of  a larger meal; it is not enough to be one, which a quiche really should be.

Wanted to make this recipe even more figure friendly, so substituted chicken for ham and used reduced fat cheese (cheddar instead of mozzerella). Also opted for low fat cottage cheese.  Really filling and tasty, not to metnion guilt-free!  Thanks!

My husband and I thought we would try this recipe. it didn't turn out as well as we had hoped(even after cooking it for an extended time). Sadly our dish came out very wartery. We won't be making it again.

Yummy and healthy!  Like mentioned in another review, this quiche is mostly cottage cheese rather than eggs, so maybe adding another egg would help.  I omitted the bell peppers and used vegetables from a package of "Organic Foursome" medley from Trader Joes (peas, green beans, carrots, corn).  I also used a 9 inch pie pan, and added a crust on the bottom, using Trader Joe's multigrain baking mix.  Delicious!

I doubled the recipe (12 servings) 
Used onions,zucchini,eggplant,green, red and yellow peppers, string beans, corn and  tomato's for the veggies,(all fresh veggies) sauteed all the veggies and ham first  then strained everything to get rid of moisture. Used the same volume of ingredients as noted in the original recipe only doubled (approximately  7+- cups of veggies). I also used 3 additional eggs to the doubled recipe. Seasoned with black pepper onion powder, garlic powder and parsley. I omitted the salt because the diced smoked ham has allot  of salt already!  I used a Mexican cheese mixture containing cheddar and pepper jack cheese.   Everyone thought it was great. I considered it simple and easy. Basically a refrigerator cleaning dish. I had to many sauteed veggies but not enough cottage cheese to triple the dish so I used  the left over sauteed veggies  to make a  noodle kugle with potatoes which also came out great.
Defiantly comfort food, Nobody left hungry and no left overs plus my refrigerator is finally empty. Yeh

It was very watery and I wasn't wild about the taste or texture.

Very tasty and very light - worked out to about 360 cal per 1/3. Served with garlic toast or wild rice for those that needed a grain in the family. Substituted the odd veg for what I had - everyone loved it. Used turkey instead of ham. Next time (with turkey) would add some poultry seasoning. Also, am considering fine shaved rounds of potato for a faux crust. Was not as good leftover next day, but was still good. Will definitely make many more times. Thx so much!

This recipe came out very watery, and the vegetables are crunchy even with extra 10 minutes bake time.  Tastes very good, no need for salt.

Used Chive cottage cheese and bottled roasted peppers. I also added a few tablespoons of grated Romano cheese to the mix. 

Really delicious!!
