Great recipe! There's nothing like something "Hot Off the Grill" and this was no exception. I used a small foil pan lightly sprayed with Pam vs. a foil packet to make things easier. I also used Land O Lakes light butter and I'm sure whatever "butter spread" you use it'll turn out good. This was a nice combination of herbs and all I added was a little minced garlic. I opted out of the bacon, but I'm sure it would be a nice addition. I covered the pan with foil and these were delicious - perfect accompaniment to grilled chicken!

These were very tender, but wasn't too impressed with the flavor, or lack thereof.  Not bad though.

Love these! The only thing I didn't add was the bacon and the paprika. But I think the dill is the seasoning that really makes these stand out. We make grilled potatoes all of the time and I will be using this recipe from now on. Thanks!

Great! of course, made some alterations, instead of using the buttery spreqad I used EVO (extra virgin olive oil) and omitted the cheese (family doesnt like it) and took out the bacon to omit some of the fat.  Cooked in my oven for 50 mins, and then put on broil for a bit, Fantastic!!

I did this in a corningware dish in the oven instead of on the grill and used some vegetable oil instead of buttery spread.  Delicious!

Luv this recipe! Made it exact the first time & they were excellent. I have made several times now, tweaking recipe/ingredients by switching up the herbs. I’ve used roasted garlic & butter, rosemary & olive oil,  etc. It’s easy & yummy every time!

My family and I loved this recipe so much that I made it twice in one week.  I didn’t change a thing and the recipe was perfect. Thank you for this recipe.

These were super yummy!  I used real butter instead of the spread called for.  I also did not have bacon on hand.  Everything else remained the same.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!
10/06/18 Update - Have made these a few more times and have added bacon - OMG - totally love these with the bacon.  These are my new favorite potatoes!

Made a much light version with EVOO. Love having the potatoes sliced that way. Really tender after 30 mins. Only added chives and salt & pepper

Great recipe for the grill. Used regular butter, didn't add bacon, substituted some thyme for the dill, and grilled them for 35 min.
