.... and where's that Ole Janx Spirit?...  Sorry...  having a Doug A moment.  Too fun and reminds me of a college roommate who had the Klingon bartending guide.  Thanks for making me smile.

This is not an enjoyable drink. The creme de menthe is the dominant flavor but is a weird mint flavor due to the additions. Strong and a bit odd.

I use 1 oz 151 rum, 1 oz tequila, 1 oz vodka, and 1 oz Roses lime Juice. Shake in ice and strain over ice. I have been making this since 1983. Goes down easy, but has a punch......

I made it as described without any changes; it was minty, but grew on me as I drank it.  Next time I might add a very small amount of sugar or something to sweeten it just a tiny bit.
