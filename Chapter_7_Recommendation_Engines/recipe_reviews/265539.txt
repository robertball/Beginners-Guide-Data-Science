My husband said this is the best meal I’ve ever made. It was simple and very tasty. I had to make a couple changes just because I don’t have a spiralizer and couldn’t find the Moroccan slice ingredient in my area. I cubed a squash and baked it in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper, these toppings were per the recipe, for 25m until tender. Then I had to make my own Moroccan spice mix from a recipe online:

Could not find Moroccan Spice in my grocery store,  so I bought Jamaican and it substituted nicely. Cubed the chicken and squash. Added some cinnamon and ginger to the squash pre-baking, a can of Bush’s black bean fiesta, and doubled the topping. Fantastic flavors!!
