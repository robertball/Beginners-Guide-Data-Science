I made this and it was good but the apple butter was very over powering. I would use maybe a 1/2 cup or less. The bottom of the tortilla was soggy so I would bake a little longer then 15 minutes and add the cheese a little after you start baking it.

I decided to try this recipe as an option for a topping at a potato bar I was hosting.  I used a pork roast instead of beef but otherwise followed the meat portion of the recipe to the letter.  This turned out to be the first topping to run out and everyone loved it.  No one even guessed there was enchilada sauce in this let alone apple butter all the flavors came together so nicely.

This was pretty good. I used applesauce in place of apple butter and followed other reviewers’ suggestions to use about half a cup. It wasn’t sweet at all, which was good.

This would have been good without the apple butter. The apple butter made it way too sweet. I am going to give it a second chance and either cut the apple butter in half or omit it all together.

my husband thought it was too sweet and I thought it was too spicy.  next time we will not use the apple butter and see if that helps the sweetness.

They were good. But maybe add some of the sauce to the bottom of the pan, the flour tortillas stuck to the bottom of the pan. Maybe ill use corn next time, but these were delicious

Really good. You can taste the apple butter but it is very toned down. Made it for dinner and had leftovers for days. None of it went to waste. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe exactly as given except I cut the apple butter in half based on a previous review.  It was so yummy! Will definitely make this again.
