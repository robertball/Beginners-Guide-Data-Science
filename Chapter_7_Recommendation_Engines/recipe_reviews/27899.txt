so instead of using canned chicken(which I really don't like) I bought one of those already cooked chickens at the grocery store took it home & just pulled the meat off it. tasted sooo much better!!

I love this recipe- I use it as a salad dressing using crushed chili powder instead of oil- adding walnuts almonds or crasins to the mix depending on my mood. Delicious!

This is excellent chicken salad! I liked it so much I could have eaten the entire dish by myself. I only used 1/3 c mayo I think a half cup would have been too much. I could have used only 1/4 c and I think it would have been okay and not too dry. As it was the third cup was a bit generous. I used red curry powder and 1 chicken breast. Fabulous!!!! Thanks this stuff is unreal it's so delicious.

My husband loves this... I added another teaspoon of curry 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Siracha sauce. I served it over a bed of greens with dried cranberries on top. My hubby also likes to add a little hummus.

This recipe is outstanding. I added 1 harboiied egg some chopped onion and celery (slightly sauteed' in olive oil to bring some of the flavor forward in the onion). Since my wife on a lo-carb diet this was definately a crowd pleaser and now I "seem" like a supportive husband. Yay!

Like TracyVeronica I added thinly sliced green onions and sliced or chopped almonds.. left out the oil and added pineapple tidbits.. served it on croisants (Mimi's used to have it this way along with a little crock of custard Lulu.) I roast chicken a lot and save most of the white meat for the chicken curry salad.

Awesome Recipe! Simple yet delicious. I didn't have Chili Oil on hand so I used Mongolian Fire Oil. Will try it with the Chili Oil today! What a great Appetizer. The only Complaint was: There wasn't enough...

Also adding apples raisins bananas onion - pretty much any of them (and I am sure others) gives it an extra kick!

My first attempt at chicken salad. I generally try to make the recipe exactly as specified the first time but I read through the reviews and decided to make a few additions. I added dried cranberries green onions and some almond slivers. The recipe came out fantastic! I even used extra hot curry powder but it couldn't have been too hot to handle because there were no leftovers. I've also had a request to make more tonight!

Simiplicity is the strong point for this dish! Good on sourdough rounds for a lunch sammy---good straight out of the bowl at O-Dark-Thirty! Had thought about adding halved small grapes for sweet or a bit of minced scallions for savory! Thanks!

I omitted the chilli oil simply because I didn't have it in the house. I ate these with saltine crackers and glass of milk. very very good if you love curry and it's not spicy so you can get the kids to try it at least.

I added pineapple tid-bits which gave it a light sweetness to compliment the curry each and every time I make this I have to double it up.

Pretty good base recipe. I omitted salt since canned chicken is already salty to me. Also omitted chili oil. I'm sure fresh cooked chicken would make this fit for guests but as it was I appreciated being able to whip it up fast with pantry staples and no cooking. I added some raisins (wish I'd had graped I would have added split grapes instead). Served it on sandwich rolls with some very crisp lettuce for texture and freshness.

I agree with previous reviews. DO NOT use canned chicken. I doubt I will try this again but I think if I had used the leftover chicken I had it would have been better. The sauce would be ok to use for other recipes or to use as a dressing/dip.

The only way I have ever made chicken salad. I do not use canned chicken though. I also love to add a sweet tart element (Granny Smith apples dried cherries green grapes...). Pretty served on split croissants.

This made a yummy lunch with buttery bacon flavored crackers! Chili oil gives it an extra flavor boost. I'd prefer it to have more texture so I added crushed almonds.

Honestly I thought this was a little bland. I added in a tablespoon of curry powder and that really brought it to life! I also didn't have grapes so I used raisins as a substitute.

Really loved this. Threw in some celery just because it's not a chicken salad to me without it onion for the husband and a few dashes of cayenne pepper because I didn't have chili oil. The hubby chased me down to tell me how much he loved it. Always excited to have an extra poached chicken breast laying around now that I know what to do with it! Agree with the reviewer who said 1/3 cup mayo is perfect.
