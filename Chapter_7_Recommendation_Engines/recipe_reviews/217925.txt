This recipe is a very good one to use for those of us that like your salsa a little hotter than just a mild salsa! I would strongly recommend that you double the recipe to make it worth your while. It has a great taste to it!!

Wow! This recipe is way too tangy for my taste! Be sure you measure out the tomatoes AFTER you have cored, chopped de-seeded. I used the recipe off of the Ball website and it said "7 cups or approximately 15 medium tomatoes". I used 19 medium tomatoes and don't think I had enough....only made 3 pint jars of salsa for me.

It was watery because I forgot to seed it! However it tastes good.  I just drain it before eating it.

This recipe worked very well.  I did simmer the salsa for longer than specified, and that kept it from being watery. (I like a thick salsa.) This recipe is flexible, too, so if you want it milder or spicier, just adjust the amount of hot sauce or jalapenos.  It's really not a spicy salsa as the directions are written, but be aware that jalapenos can vary greatly in heat, so use your taste buds as a guide before you preserve it.

This really received a lot of compliments from my family. I made it and gave it as one of my Christmas gifts. I doubled this recipe, used half fresh tomatoes and canned diced and crushed tomatoes, added extra onions and a whole bulb of garlic. A chef on an oil rig tried and gave it a thumbs up. I collect my tomatoes during the summer, wash them and put them in a ziplock bag and freeze until I have enough to make a full recipe. This way you don't have blanch them, just thaw and they pop right out of the skins.

This is by far the best salsa I have ever had. I made double the recipe so I can give it to my family for Christmas but I'm not sure if they are going to last that long. The jars might be gone before then. Lol! I'm more than likely going to make more. I added sweet vidalia onions to the recipe to add more substance to it and it was well worth it. Next time I'm going to add some peppers to it. Five star recipe in my book it was so fresh and tasty and highly addictive.  I'll be making this recipe for years to come!

I have made numerous batches of this recipe over the past 2 years and it always turns out awesome! I do it just as written, and have gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tried it. This will be one recipe that gets hand down the generations.

I ended up with only three pints, but we finally tried this after it's been on the shelf for a couple weeks, and it is terrific!  I used some fresh Roma tomatoes and jalapeño peppers from our garden, and you can definitely taste the difference relative to salsa purchased in the store.  I'll use this again before summer's over, with the next bunch of fresh tomatoes.

With the varying size of garden Roma tomatoes, I've found that I use approximately 24 Romas to make up 7 cups of them after they're peeled and chopped.  I've made this recipe four times now, in the last two years, and have always had three pints, not four, but it's still fantastic.
EDIT: This year I experimented with two salsa variations; mild as written above, and a 'medium' version, where I double the jalapeño peppers and onions, and add a couple extra drops of hot sauce (I wouldn't go nuts with this before canning; you can always add more before serving).  Both variations turned out fantastic, and still taste as fresh as the day I canned them, even after sitting on the shelf for a year.  This is one of four main recipes I use every season for saving my organic tomatoes harvested from my small (12'x12') garden. Thanks for sharing... the salsas are always a hit with friends and family at gatherings. 
Note to self: DO NOT skimp on wearing gloves while cutting your peppers!!  Did this again, thinking I could handle the capsacin, and ouch!

this is an awesome recipe. Very basic and easy to make on top of that. This one is a keeper. I was only able to make two jars, because this also good as pico de gillo (raw salsa), but I'll be making this from now on instead of buying it. The canning is a big plus.

Wow this is so good! Never canned salsa before but I have my first garden so I had some tomatoes to use up! I let the chopped tomatoes drain in the sink a while since I only had heirlooms to use. ended up needing a little tomato paste to thicken but other than that I stuck to the recipe. Next time I might add some seasonings but honestly its so tasty as is!

I like it mild left seeds out of jalapeño. So fresh tasting. Many compliments!  I do suggest doubling recipe. I have made this several times.??
