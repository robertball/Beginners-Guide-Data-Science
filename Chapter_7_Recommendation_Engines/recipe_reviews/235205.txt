I first made this as written, and while it is pretty healthy, it is also pretty bland.  After cooking all day in the crockpot, I put it on the stovetop and added:  onion slices, garlic, salt and pepper, a couple of shakes of lemon pepper.  This added a lot more flavor.  The can of potato soup was completely lost as there is a lot of liquid in this dish.  I think if I were to make this again, I will just add fresh diced potatoes to the recipe.  I served this with 'Spiced Applesauce Bread' from AR and fresh San Francisco Sourdough Bread.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is the perfect recipe for the basis of the Cabbage Soup Grandma used to make, she would literally just use chicken stock and cabbage and toss in whatever else was available. I pretty much did the same thing, as I am on a budget and will only make meals with what I have on hand in the house already. 
Changes I made:
Used 3 chicken breasts and cut them into bit size pieces
Added chicken breast to crock pot and sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Lawry's season salt.
Used 32 oz of chicken broth and added a can of cream of potato soup to that, stirred it up and let that boil until chicken was done. Roughly 1.5 hours.
Chopped up one very small head of cabbage, 3 carrots, and 3 stalks of celery. Added these along with 2 cups of water to the crock. Also added a packet of Swanson liquid chicken seasoning as I tasted the broth and it was very bland. You could use more chicken broth instead, I just happened to have a packet of this left, so I tossed it in. I also added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I let these cook on high until veggies were done, about 3.5 hours.
I had a bowl soon after this and wished I had added some extra potatoes to this. Not to worry, I cut up some potatoes and boiled them on the stove and added them for my leftover meals. This made it less soupy, so if you would rather have more broth, don't add more potatoes. For me, adding the potatoes made this perfectly yummy. Thanks Bizzle for the great recipe!

I am very new to cooking so I tried this as one of my first slow cooker adventures. I was very happy I read the reviews bc it must just be an oversight that salt and spices weren't included. So I added a large chicken bouillon cube to the stock and salted the chicken. Then I added about 1/4 of a large sweet yellow onion and 4 small yellow potatoes and galic powder to the veggie step. I removed the cabbage bc my crew doesn't like it. Turned out amazing. Certainly a wonderful base recipe and very versatile! I will certainly make it again.

The recipe as is provides plenty of room for your imagination. I like the cabbage component, that's what makes it unique. But it does need flavor. I use low sodium chicken broth so additional seasoning was necessary. Salt, pepper and I added 2 tsp basil and 1/2 tsp oregano. Seasoning salt would've been good too but I had none on hand. For potato soup I used a can of Campbell's, but I may experiment with this next time, with something creamy but zestier. I did not add any water, not even the 2 cups the recipe called for.  I like hearty soups. It was fine.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I was out of town caring for my son who was recovering from cancer surgery and I was looking for a good comfort food chicken soup recipe.  It was delicious and was just what we needed.

Followed recipe exactly and this was very bland. I had to add a lot of seasoning to make it edible. Wonâ€™t make this one again.

The only change I made was to add some sliced onion to the soup.  It was delicious.
