I followed the advice of other reviewers & cooked the flounder filets seperately (also, there's one person in our house who will only eat plain flounder) and added the sauce to the plate. I also used only half the amount of capers called for (I thought 4 Tbs woulkd be too much), a can of petite diced tomatoes(drained) and I couldn't get fresh basil so I used dried. The dish came out so good, I was very close to making the same thing for dinner again the next night. We had it with Jasmine rice, steamed summer squash & fresh Italian bread.

I made this recipe for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit.  I put everything together before hand, and I popped it in the oven while everyone was having appetizers.  Everyone raved about it.  The only problem was that I didn't have more.

This recipe is soooo good.  I used Talapia as I like no bones or skin.  My husband and I both couldn't get enough of the topping.  Don't be scared by the first reviewer, this recipe is awesome!

I prepared the sauce exactly as directed and it was delicious! This fish didn't cook so well in the oven with the sauce on top however.  I, too, recommend cooking the fish (little salt, pepper, lemon) then adding the sauce afterward.

I can't believe I haven't already rated this one. I've been making this one for awhile and I always LOVE it. I typically don't use flounder, but instead use orange roughy, just because that's usually what I have on hand. I love topping this with a bit of feta cheese as I put in on my plate. It just adds to the whole Mediterranen feel. I love this one. Our family is divided, though. My husband is not an olive fan (and there is no way I'm skimping on those yummy kalamatas), and my youngest son is sort of picky, but my oldest son and I LOVE it. I think it would make a great sauce for pasta also.

The fish came out like mush... If I made this again I would make the fish seperately and use the rest as a sauce over the fish.

I loved this recipe!! I did change three things though- I used regular onion, a lot fewer Kalamata olives (I was afraid it would make it too salty), maybe half what it says- and fewer capers (about 2 Tbsp)- again afraid of the salt. Fish is so good for you but sometimes not the best tasting- this made it taste GREAT. I will be making this one again and again.

I am an average cook who likes easy recipes.  This was perfect!  I used Tilapia and diced canned tomatoes.  Directions were perfect, fish turned out flaky and sauce was not too heavy and tasted very fresh!

You must try this!  I omitted the capers and olives, personal preference and used diced (petite) tomatoes with the juices.  Drizzled some olive oil over the filets and arranged most of the sauce around them and just a bit on top.  Then, sprinkled italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese over the filets. Placed in the oven for the recommended baking time...created the perfect "crust".  Crispy on top-moist and flaky on the bottom! I think it's really important to simmer the sauce until reduced by at least half....otherwise too wet. My 4 year old and 8 year old boys LOVED it!

Delicious and flexible recipe. I used with cod, a little thicker so had to cook longer, naturally. I threw about a cup of fresh baby spinach into the sauce that I needed to use up and that worked just fine. I sprinkled a little goat cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of baking, served with rice.

This was terrific. I love this website because you always have the advantage of those that have cooked before you.  I  used what I had; diced tomatoes instead of plum, reg. black olives, dried basil and white vermouth.  Having seen how thin my fillets were, I actually prepared the sauce in a saute pan and once reduced I added the fillets, spooned the sauce over them and kind of poached the fillets in the sauce.  EXCELLENT and couldn't have been easier.

If you like the savory zip of kalmata and capers this is a great dish!  My husband, who is not a fish fan, really enjoyed this.  I used talapia instead of flounder, a can of diced tomatoes instead of blanching and peeling fresh ones, and about a tablespoon of dried oregano instead of the fresh. Served with steamed broccoli and buttered new potatoes.

This is a simply delicious recipe and very easy to prepare. My family who does not care for fish simply could not get enough of the spectacular sauce. The nice thing about this recipe is that I think that you can alter it (substitute type of fish)without changing the character of the dish. Will make this a favorite of our family.

I am not a great lover of fish, but I do like it at times and try to eat it at least once per week to maintain a balanced diet, so I always am on the lookout for good and easy variations of fish recipes to cook after a hard day at work. This one hit the nail on the head. Now for the variations: not having the kalamata olives (though they are great), I chopped up some black and green olives and added a teaspoon of basil pesto which we happened to have lying around in the refrigerator. Since this meal was being made for only one person (me, because wife was on another diet that week), I scaled back the ingredients proportionately and cooked everything in the same skillet. Near the end of cooking the sauce, I made a space in skillet to cook the flounder. Being very thin, it cooks quickly right in the same skillet in just a few minutes. This recipe tasted great and was a definite improvement over the standard lemon-butter recipe. I can see where this recipe can be used for other varieties of fish besides flounder.

I've never reviewed a recipe on this site that has been this good. I didn't expect much from the recipe because the ingredients seemed simple enough. I would blanch the tomatoes and peel them allover again for this recipe. The fresh roma tomatoes likely made a huge difference in this rather than canned tomatoes.

I would recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys Mediterranean dishes or fish. I plan to make this recipe again.

This was really good.  We really enjoyed it and plan on making it again and again.  The only thing we did different was add a can of quarter sliced artichoke hearts (drained) and did half kalamata and half black olives.  This could easly go over chicken or beef as well as any other fish.  Can diced tomatoes (undrained) worked as well as fresh tomatoes. Ok one other change. Took the advice of other reviewers (because the flounder was thin), we poached it in white wine, lemon juice and a little bit of butter in the oven on 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes. We didn't add the fish to the dish instead we just spooned over the fish when served.  Since there is only two of us we had leftovers (cept the fish) which was then used over steak the next night and it was another delicious dish!  Thank you Martin for posting this awesome recipe.

Had this for dinner last night - we loved it, and so did our guests! The sauce was really delicious. Although I seem to have made several modifications, I think they were not major changes, and left the dish essentially as posted. I used sole, as we don't have flounder here, and reduced the olives (pimento-stuffed green) and capers a little, as I was afraid the guests might not enjoy them. When the sauce seemed to be getting a little too thick, I added a little more white wine. In accordance with some reviewers, I baked the fish for about 10 min. before spooning the sauce on top, and then baked 5 min. more to give the fish time to absorb the flavor of the sauce. Next time I will try cooking the fish in the sauce, in accordance with the directions, as with separate cooking, the fish liquid was not incorporated into the sauce. The dish was very convenient for me, as I was able to make the sauce earlier in the day, and just reheat before adding to the fish. Yum, yum! - can't wait for the few leftovers for lunch today.

I would have given this 5 stars but I don't think you should cook the sauce with the fish & I made a few other measurement changes. Otherwise, I find it delicious! I do use canned diced tomatoes with garlic, celery & onion and about 1/2 the olives & half the capers. I squeeze lemon juice on the fish (usually tilapia or swai), season with lemon pepper, italian seasoning, and a little garlic salt and bake for 12-15 minutes. I serve it over basmati rice. It's healthy & extremely flavorful!!

This recipe is excellent.  I used Tuna steaks instead of the flounder.  The tuna steaks were thick so total baking time was about 1 hour.  I sprinkled Feta cheese on top for even more of a Mediterranean taste!

My husband came home with flounder last night and I had no idea what to do with it.  I found this recipe and tried it.  I would not change a thing.  He absolutely loved it and told me not to lose the recipe!

This is the third time (third recipe) that I've tried cooking flounder and the first time I liked it.  The sauce is AMAZING.  I served it over rice.  I used regular olives and only half of the amount of capers suggested.  Loved it!  This would also be really good with shrimp or nothing at all except the sauce over pasta.  Delish!!!

Made this twice: first time exactly as written - it was edible; second with some tweaks to improve flavor - better, but there won't be a third time. "Flavorful Flounder" and "Mainely Fish" from this site are twice as good in addition to being faster and easier to prepare.

This turned out great!  An easy way to peel roma tomatoes you are going to cook with is to freeze them.  Then, hold them under running warm water and the skin will slide right off with gentle pressure.   I love that this dish is so healthy.

This was delicious and I didn't even have all of the ingredients.  I did not have olives, so added a few extra capers.  I used garlic powder and dried basil instead of fresh garlic and basil.  I had some leftover asparagus, so added that also.  I did not add the parm cheese either.  I seasoned the flounder and baked for about 15-20 mins and then just added to the frying pan with other ingredients. I'm sure if I used all of the right ingredients, this would be even better.  I will be making this over and over again, since it tastes great, is easy and is not fattening.

I made this for a light New Years Eve dinner and it was pretty good. I don't like olives so I didn't use them and I didnt have capers so they were out too. I used a can of diced tomatoes which made this much easier. Also, like another reviewer, I cooked the flounder without the sauce. I squeezed half a lemon over it, seasoned with salt, pepper and a pinch of old bay, added chopped basil and fresh flat leaf parsley before I put it in the oven. Very easy. I might try this again.

A perfect summertime dinner!  So healthy, so fresh, so delicious.  I used very thin flounder fillets, so my cooking time was a bit less than the recipe called for.  And I used canned diced tomatoes simply because my Jersey tomatoes had gone bad on the counter.  The garlic, wine, capers, olives...so Mediterranean!

I made this with tilapia and it was easy, fast and tasty. Boost flavor with extra garlic or a dash of cayenne.

Fabulous!  I had all the ingredients in the fridge, (except roma tomatoes- I used canned diced) and my husband raved!  A loaf of fresh rustic italian bread is a must to go with this dish.
Try it- you won't be sorry!

The sauce was delicious but while baking it according to the directions listed above made the fish extremely mushy.  I will definately try this again but will cook the fish separately from the sauce and just add the sauce before serving.  I will also be trying this sauce with chicken and beef after this attempt.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  I followed the ingredients to the sauce exactly.  I did bake the fish with just salt and pepper in a foil pouch for 18 minutes at 375.  This also helped save time since you could bake the fish while the sauce simmered.  I used Halibut instead of flounder because I was looking for a more solid fish.  The fish came out great, and the sauce is delicious.  Make sure you have extra Italian bread on hand to soak it all up!!

OMG delish. I cooked fish separately in the microwave for 4 min and then drained it. Topped it with the sauce and basil. Wow! Used canned tomatoes, drained capers, 18 olives chopped. Make this!!! Served with brown rice and peas.

My wife had shoulder surgery, so I need to cook for a while.  I NEVER cook.  I made this dish.  It turned out great (my kids didn't like it).  The olives were awesome.  I'll definitely make it again (or get my wife to make it if I'm lucky).  Thanks to whoever posted it.

Made this tonight for my family and we all absolutely loved it!  It was just the right combination of onions, garlic, capers, etc...I did omit the olives and used fire roasted tomatoes from the can because of time.  We also don't like olives but that was the only change.  Can't say enough about how good it was!

This is delicious.  We live on the Gulf Coast and we use this for all the fish we catch.....lately, Red Snapper. We love capers so I add more than the recipe calls for.  Made numerous times and everyone loves it!!!

Fabulous! We roasted the fish in the oven separately like the other reviewers suggested. We didn't have italian seasoning, so used herbs de provence instead. There were no left overs!

This is absolutley delicious! I have made this several times, but forgot to review. I often use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, and it turns out fabulous. I have also used dried basil instead of fresh, which works well also. It's simple, light but yet very robust with flavors. This recipe can be used for halibut and tilapia as well. Thanks for sharing, I love this dish :)

I made this last night.  I was going to use flounder, but when I got to the store the cod looked better.  Like others, I used a can of diced tomatoes drained, and I baked the cod for about 10 minutes in some white wine, salt & pepper.  Then I topped with the sauce and baked for another 15-20 minutes.  We all enjoyed this, it was very healthy and light.  I tossed some green leaf lettuce, grape tomatoes, and red onion with a little olive oil, fresh lemon juice and feta for a side.  Great Mediterranean evening!

Big hit- "We can have fish now" was the quote.  Cooked it exactly as listed, I think you could substitute the kalamatu (sp?) olives with regular if you couldn't find.

delicious! I didnt have any parmesan cheese, so i used monterey jack, and it came out really good. The flavors of the ingrediants are unique and taste well together. This is my first time making anything mediterranean, and i really enjoyed cooking it, and eating it. I served it on a bed of rice with a side of asparagus. yummy!

WOW! This was amazing!  I used Organic Oven Dried Roma Tomatoes in a jar from Costco that I had sitting in my pantry because I didn't have any fresh Roma Tomatoes.  I just added some water and cooked them down a bit.  I also cooked the fish separately by poaching as someone suggested and then added the sauce on the side.  This is one of the best dishes we've even eaten from Allrecipies...and I've cooked a lot of them.  This sauce would be good on pasta or chicken...heck, it is good just eating it with a spoon.  Love, love , love....

This is an awesome recipe, the sauce is restaurant quality!  The only change I made was I didn't have Italian seasoning, so I just added a little oregano and hot pepper flakes, also I used 1 can diced tomatoes, drained them, didn't count the olives, just bought a jar of sliced kalamata and used one cup.  Baked according to instructions, and used thin fillets and it was great!

Managed to make the time to use all fresh ingredients in this so not sure how canned tomatoes, olives, etc might be but it turned out great! With lemon juice, capers & olives I thought it might be very strong and salty but it wasn't at all. The mild white fish (I used flounder) mixed well with the strong flavors. It was tasty and healthy! I will make this again for my family, including 3 teenagers. Served it with rice & a big salad.

Prep took longer than 15 minutes but OMG so worth it!!!  One of the very best fish dishes I've ever had.

Normally I prepare fish by it's self, either poached or grilled with a little salt and maybe fresh dill.  I didn't realize what I was missing!

We cut the olives in half to reduce the salt (and there are still plenty of olives left), also, we use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  It's not necessary, but adding artichoke hearts creates an even more outstanding dish.  One of our favorites!

I enjoyed this recipe very much. I did make a few changes. I used dice canned tomatoes as it was easier than using fresh tomatoes. I also used tilapia instead of flounder, I prefer the taste of tilapia over flounder. I cooked this fish and sauce separately, so that I would not over cook the fish. Lastly, I did not add white wine, since I did not have any on hand. I serve this with kale and rice. It re-heats well the next day.

Easy & delicious...even my picky kids loved it!  Left out olives & capers because I didn't have any...subbed 1/2 tsp dried basil for fresh & 1/4 tsp oregano for Italian seasoning (again, not having all ingredients & improvising). Very tasty, moist, quick & healthy meal...two thumbs up!!!

Following the advice of other reviewers I made the sauce as directed on the stove and baked the flounder separately.  It came out great!   Unfortunately, when I grabbed fresh basil out of the fridge it was far less perky than when I put it away so I had to use dried basil.  It was still good, but it would have been infinitely better with fresh basil.

Made the recipe exactly as described.  The topping was made stove-top and then added to the flounder and baked in pre-heated oven as listed.  Came out perfectly.  Will make again.

Made this last night for my fiance and we both loved it. I was looking for something easy to do with flounder and this was it. I omitted the capers since I didn't have any in the house, and used canned peeled tomatoes instead of fresh Romas, and it still turned out wonderfully. The sauce is robust and delicious. I served it with tabbouleh. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  The flounder was very moist and the kalamata olives offered a great balance.  This recipe is great with Quinoa in place of rice!

Beautiful colors and great salty and tangy flavor. My filets were thin so I cooked the whole dish on the stovetop. Enjoyable and healthy meal.

This was quite tasty - will definitely make again.  We are on a special diet, so I omitted the olives and since my tomatoes are not ripe yet, I used a can of organic diced tomatoes in place of the romas (probably also saving time, as well).  I used fresh herbs from my garden for the Italian spices.  Great recipe!  Tangy and yummy!

this was a great recipe. I RARELY cook without some type of seasoning- salt, pepper, etc, but this recipe did not need it! 

I left out the capers + wine because I didn't have any (white wine) at the time. I also used dried basil (not fresh).  i'm almost certain that it would have enhanced the recipe. But I do not feel it was any less tasty without it.  definitely recommended.

We tried this tonight and it was fabulous. The sauce is a stand-alone hit, and works very well with the fish. We believe this sauce would work very well with chicken. The only thing we changed was the tomatoes. We used a 14.5 oz can of diced Italian tomatoes. Otherwise everything was the same. Highly recommended.

This is an excellent tasty recipe.  I have made it twice.  Both times I used canned diced tomatoes...one time I used black olives because that's all I had in the pantry...the next time I used green olives with capers.  I used a little less olives and capers per the recommendations of other reviewers.  I will definitely make it again.  We have used it on Flounder, Tilapia...and I have used leftover sauce over a baked potato.  A winner each and every time!

This was a big hit. I used canned tomatoes as recommended because fresh are out-of-season, with fresh basil, and a good quality Parmesan-Rigganno. I didn't cook the flounder with the sauce, but ladled it over the fish after baking. The sauce is awesome and needed no adjustments.

Really nice sauce! My BF is in heaven. I used canned diced tomatoes, a regular yellow onion and, because I could not find kosher capers or kalamata olives, I used a jar of mixed capers and olives and some other red stuff - it was great! It would be fantastic on pasta!

The sauce for this was fantastic!  So flavorful and fresh tasting.  My New Year's resolution for this year is to eat and try to like fish.  This was the first recipe I tried.  Although I loved the flavor of this dish, I was not fond of the texture of the Flounder.  Since this is a personal problem, I gave it 5 stars!

This is really a tasty way to make flounder. I usually just season fish and bake it and was looking for something different and this really delivered. I only used 2 T capers and black olives (what I had on hand) and crushed tomatoes as others suggested. My oven runs cold, so I ended up cooking it about 17 minutes and the fish turned out great! Just enough sauce to cover the fish as well. Will definitely make in the future.

This was very yummy and would be good on chicken too!  I followed the recipe exactly and it made more sauce than I needed.  Next time, I will either have more with it or cut the recipe back a bit.  Thanks for sharing it was delish!

Fantastic recipe.  I had read the warnings about mushy fish.  I placed the flounder in the baking dish for 5 minutes and then added the sauce.  I am not sure if this was necessary, but the fish was firm and flakey.

This was so awesome. My family just loved it. One of the tastiest recipes for flounder I've found. Olives, plum tomato, capers and parmesean cheese are a magical combination over fish.

I loved this! I used feta and parmesean cheese at the end. I only had regular black olives and it worked out well. Next time I will pan fry the fish and then seve with the sauce. When I baked the fish, it was very watery.

This is a fantastic tasting fish recipe! We fixed it for a large group. Don't be mislead about the prep time though. It took at least an hour to prepare the ingredients for assembly. It is worth it by far, but allow 1 1/2 hours before the cooking begins!

Great recipe.  Made exactly as listed and turned out great!  I think the sauce would go well on chicken breast or chicken cutlet, maybe shrimp too.  Love it, easy, versatile, it's a keeper :)

Very good flavor.  I left out the olives (personal preference) and used a can of drained diced tomatoes because I didn't have fresh.  Will definately make this again.

My family and friends loved this recipe, but then I love salty dishes. Although I think that you can substitute haddock for the flounder, I don't think you can do w/o the fresh basil and roma tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again, and I'd love to make it when we have guests as well.

I found this a little too salty and overwhelming for the fish.  I think I'll stick with something simpler next time.  I gave it 3 stars because my husband liked it, but I won't make it again.

This was an excellent recipe, enjoyed by my family.  I took the recommendations of other posters and cooked the fish separately from the sauce and it worked perfectly.  The fish was crisp and the sauce was wonderful!  My husband, 11 y/o and I loved it.  My 11 y/o daughter normally doesn't like fish that much and she ate seconds of this dish and asked for more.  My 9 y/o daughter who DOES like fish DIDN'T like this recipe.  I plan on making this again.

I made this for my husband, he said that it was good. I didn't have kalamata olives on hand, so I used some black olives. I will probably make it again, but it won't be a frequent user.

I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and added mushrooms. It turned out delicious over flounder. I think the sauce would be a great topping to any meat!

I substituted cod for the flounder and used canned tomatoes.  I cooked the cod separately in over for ten minutes then added to sauce in pan.  The result was delicious.  I think any number of white fish could be used successfully with this recipe.  Flounder is often unavailable.

I made it but could not find Spanish onions.  Used tilapia and turbo filet, flounder not avail.  Came out very liquid.  Maybe did not cook the sauce long or hot enough.  But family enjoyed it anyway.  will try again.

Definitely will make this again - may use orange roughy next time.  I'm a widower.  I have to learn how to cook, or be doomed to peanut butter & jelly for the rest of my life.  This was easy, the flavor was wonderful, and even a rookie like me had no problems./

Delicious as written. Only adjustment was that I followed other suggestions and cooked fish separately.
I doubled the sauce and served over angel hair pasta.

An excellent recipe. I used Tilapia rather than flounder and served it with a small side of linguini. In the future I’ll make this sauce to serve with pasta alone. It reminds me of pasta putanesca. Kalamata olives and capers are two of my favorite flavors. I finished the meal feeling full but healthy and not weighed down. Goes great with a glass of white wine.

We followed the sauce recipe, but added a pound of lump crab and when it finished, topped with cubed avacado, covered with aluminum foil for 5 min while the dish rested and warmed the avacado.

Good, easy recipe. I would suggest using a fish with a fuller body like grouper, snapper or mahi. The flounder got lost in the powerful taste of the olives and tomatoes. I also used sweet vermouth rather than a table wine. It helped to bring all the flavors together.

This was outstanding.  Made it tonight.  Used  diced tomatoes and black olives.  Did saute fish separately (used catfish).  I bet this would work well with chicken cutlets. Will certainly make again.

Used cod instead of flounder. The sauce is a definite keeper, over a variety of meats, but need to figure out how to tame the salt. Drain the capers maybe?

Halved the recipe and used 6 oz. of Flounder.  Accompanied with Asparagus baked at (and for) the same time, a little crusty bread, and pesto in EEVO.  The fish cooked perfectly and the sauce was satisfying.  This was an excellent light meal for two that could easily act as the fish course for a more elaborate dinner.

This was very good.  My husband loved it.  I used canned flavored tomatoes (garlic, oregano etc) and used red onion since I didn't have Spanish onion.  Turned out just fine and will definitely make again.  You could use any mild fish.

This recipe was so delicious! As a single working professional, it’s a great meal prep recipe because it doesn’t take long to make and tastes delightful. I used ALL of the capers and a few extra olives Blaine they’re my faves....can’t wait to make this recipe again.

I made this and it was delicious.  I also cut back on the amount of Kalamatas and on the capers.  I may have cut back a bit too much.  Next time, I'll use a bit more.  I, like others, cooked the fish separately in the oven and then poured the sauce over each serving.  We loved it!  Will make again

Made it as outlined in the recipe and everyone raved about the taste and tenderness of the flounder.  I will make this again.

I made it as written and I will make it again.  I cooked the filets separately as advised and it was delicious.  This would be a great dish to serve to company.  It is easy to make, and it appears elegant.

I used tilapia as flounder wasn’t available today and it was great. I substituted black olives for kalamata because I can’t stand those, but the rest was standard. I did cook the tilapia in the oven separately and topped with the sauce. This is  a real keeper!

Loved it! I worked late so was looking for a fast but light dinner so I had to sub a little because I wasn't going back out! Only had red onion and no tomato, but in the fridge....about half a can of diced tomato with chipotle....close enough! My friend had brought over fresh caught perch the day before, so we were in business! I cut the recipe in half for the two of us. I sautéed the S&P fish in EVOO first ( after reading about mushy fish ) set it aside and prepared the tomato sauce in same skillet. Turned off the heat and plopped the fish back in the pan and covered with the sauce to warm it back up. Did not bake it because everything was cooked, didn't need parm but yummy either way! Thank you for sharing! * also added a little white bean because he is on a high protein diet and that was nice too! Chopped, wilted spinach would be good too I imagine....

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I was hesitant to make this bc i didn't have all the ingredients, but i looked at other reviews, left out the olives and capers. I ran out of white cooking wine, so I used what I had which was Marsala cooking wine. I also only put the sauce around the flounder instead of directly on for baking, and sprinkled some on top, also w/some extra Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. It was sooooo tasty and perfectly flaky.  Everyone including the children loved it, thank you!

I didn't have olives, capers or fresh basil, and I know this will make the dish even better when I use them next time, but it was still great without them! I read about cooking the fish separately after I made it, and I can see how that would work well, but I especially liked the ease of throwing it in the casserole without cooking it first. It just needed more time then stated in the recipe.

I was under the impression the olives would blend well and not have an obvious taste to them. It took the overall flavor if the recipe and was simply not that good. This recipe is very palate specific and definately not for everyone.

Delicious...but of course a
I made a few minor adjustments.  Increased the garlic by a clove and gave it a bit more seasoning (large pinch of thyme, oregano, and basil).  Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh basil but that would have only 6 stars.

I am horrible at preparing fish.  So I had my doubts.  But this was excellent.  I left out the fancy stuff like olives and capers, and used canned tomatoes.  As suggested by others, I cooked the fish alone, well, for about five minutes, then the last three minutes after putting the tomatoes on I put it on the top shelf in my oven.  Finally, I have a go-to fish recipe.

This is hands down one of the most amazing dishes I've ever made, even my meat and potatoes loving husband was raving about it!  I didn't change anything except I used cod and added some peeled and deveined extra large shrimp prior to cooking.  I think any meaty white fish would work perfectly in this (I cooked the cod to an internal temp of 130-135 before pulling from the oven).  I also used dried basil because its what I had on hand.  The only thing we both agreed it needed was a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, next time I'll add them while cooking.  This would be lovely over Israeli couscous or rice.  I reheated the extra broth/sauce left in the dish (veggie bits and all) and used it to make couscous and it is SO GOOD.   I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I made this with tilapia instead of flounder as that was what I had. It was absolutely delicious! I took the leftovers to work for 2 days afterwards. I took others advice and cooked the fish separately from the sauce but I also had to make some for my son without the sauce since he doesn't eat the ingredients in this sauce anyway. No doubt I will make this again. I think it could be used with any white fish and would even be good with swordfish. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used one can of diced tomatoes (feeling lazy) and cooked the fish separately. I thought the sauce was a little sweet for my tastes-maybe because the onions had carmelized? Maybe it would be better with feta cheese rather than Parmesan. I think I would like it better on chicken-since the fish was sort of tasteless in itself.

My family loved this dish! I did make a few changes so we would not have to add a side salad. First, I used Red Snapper as my family is not a fan of Halibut. I used a whole onion and used 6 Roma tomatoes. I wanted a lot of vegetables! I added artichokes with the the olives and capers. I drained a can of artichokes and chopped them up. I followed the rest of the recipe how is was written. Combined with the rice, this was a hearty dish! We didn't need anything else! My family has requested this again!

Excellent recipe! I was out of kalamata olives and capers, I substituted regular green olives. I was out of white wine and substituted red. I used a can of diced tomatoes. It still came out delicious! I bet it will be even better when I have the right ingredients. Will definitely make again. I believe you could use any kind fish with this, I love recipes like this that are versatile.

We really enjoyed this fish dish. I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand in my kitchen, with the exception of the olives. I was making about 1/2lbs of fish (2 fillets) and had only one plum tomato, so I changed the servings to 1 and didn't do exact measurements but guess-timated it. I didn't want to waste any of my only tomato so I omitted dropping it in boiling water and removing the skin. I followed other suggestions to cook the topping on the stovetop and then put on after the fillets finished baking.  This was a simple, delicious and healthy meal. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a delicious recipe. I made it with Tilapia but followed every other ingredient. There was too much sauce but it was so delicious I saved the extra for a twist for a topping on an omelette. Yummy!

This was delicious and easy to make.  I didn't have olives,  also only had dried basil.  It still was delicious.  I definitely will make again.  The flounder was so thin that I didn't have trouble getting it done.  Following the recipe made it perfect.

It was absolutely delicious. I did bake the flounder first, for about 10 minutes, then added the tomato topping and baked for another 12 minutes.  The flounder still was not done.  I would suggest baking the flounder for at least 15 minutes first so it will be done.  Other than that, it's on the 'do it again' list!

This was really good. I followed recommendations and baked the fish by itself. I used canned diced tomatoes because tomatoes are out of season. Otherwise I made it as written. It was easy and good. I'll definitely make itaagain.

First and foremost, I have to apologize.  This dish was so dang good, we ate it before I could take a picture of it.
This was one of the best recipes for Flounder that I have ever made.   I didn't see the value in making them together so I made the sauce, then I made the flounder.  I made jasmine rice which I put down over a spoonful of sauce, then the fish, then a little more sauce.  It was awesome! Flounder is a very mild, delicate fish and the sauce is a bit heavy with the olives and tomatoes, so I felt, the sauce was an integral part, but shouldn't overpower the fish.
My husband LOVED it and I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I will make this again for sure.   I am so happy that I have leftover sauce because I have some chicken in the freezer right now that is SCREAMING for it!   Thank you thank you, thank you!!!

I used tilapia and it turned out great. I used half a white onion and 2cans of chopped tomatoes. I really liked the sauce. It had a sweet taste. My fillets were swimming in it. I had to cook it 5 minutes longer then tried to uncover the fish a little and broiled for 4minutes. I served quinoa and used up a bit of stir-fried kale I threw on top of the sauce which added some color.

This is the recipe I've been dreaming of! I don't like olives, so I omitted them. This is seriously delicious.  I used Sole instead of Flounder because that's what I had already bought. This is going into our family's "Tested Best" recipe book.

Finally I found a recipe that made fish taste good. The flavors are so strong, the fish almost is like a compliment to the sauce.  When I baked the fish, I did not add salt, the sauce had enough salty ingredients.    Instead of going through the hassle of boiling water & peeling tomatoes, used canned peeled tomatoes to shorten the cooking time.   So easy to make & can't wait to make again. 

Thank you for giving me a recipe that will make me eat my own fish dishes!!!

I needed to make a quick dinner and only knew I had some frozen flounder laying around so I thawed it out and found this here recipe and went to work. I substituted canned chopped tomatoes, a yellow onion and canned black olives instead of what the recipe called for. I also used an organic apple wine that I made last year instead of white wine and organic purple basil from my garden. I served the med. flounder on a bed of basmati rice and it was a hit, everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing!

Easy recipe that my husband and I loved.  I did omit the olives since he hates them, but then I sprinkled some on my individual serving.  I used all four TBS of the capers (unlike other reviewers) because they are delish!!  I was also out of white wine so I used one TBS of white wine vinegar and 1/4 cup of water.  Very good results!

I also cooked the fish separately. I didn't bake anything, but did both the sauce and fish on the stovetop, then combined on the plate.  I didn't have any white wine so left that out, but didn't miss it at all. Also used tilapia instead. Everyone loved it, and it was a great way to kick off my mediterranean diet - super healthy!

Excellent!  I was eager to try this, just because of all the wonderful ingredients, even though I did not have wine, or fresh tomatoes.  I used canned tomatoes and the juice from them, instead.  We served it over rice rice and it was oh-so-good!!

Everyone really like this recipe. I thought it was great as I am diabetic and this fits right in with my program. The only change I made was I used sliced black olives as that was what I had and I really think it liked them better as you have the tartness with the capers. I have had several requests for this recipe and that always tells me that it is a keeper! and dish I will serve again and again.

Great healthy dish, perfectly flavorful. I left out the olives, but this dish is great even without them! I like to add a little more wine so that there is a nice sauce to drizzle over fish as it is served.

Very good. Peeling the tomatoes was a little tedious, but the end result was worth it. I think the sauce would also be great on bruschetta or with fresh mozzarella on a bagette.

I wanted to do a different fish than the old standards, and on paper this looks like a great recipe.  There's a lot of strong flavors going on here.  I made it exactly as directed and I think next time I will omit the kalamatas.  The capers are enough zing.  Otherwise it was excellent.  I served it with asparagus and rise.

Loved it! My kids loved it! My husband who eats only fried fish LOVED it! (of course he doesn't know what's in it haha) I followed the advice of others and  NEXT time I will definitely follow the recipe and cook together not separate! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I also cooked the flounder seperately from the sauce and it was DELICIOUS! I rarely rate recipes but this one was so good. My only complaint is, it was a bit too salty. I'd go with less olives.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Noting some past reviews I was hesitant but have come to realize that some people just don't know how to cook fish. One cannot follow a recipe verbatim when cooking fish because processing times differ based on the freshness of the fish, thickness etc. Some hands on common sense is required. I have passed this recipe on to many of my friends.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was awful - the fish was incredibly mushy.  I know other reviewers liked this recipe because they changed it substantially - to me though the rating should reflect the original recipe and that recipe just isn't good.

Very delicious.  I substituted 2 tbsp of spicy brown mustard for the capers and used a fillet from a whole Panamanian snapper I bought from my local farmer's market.  I thought the basil would be overpowering in the dish, but the flavors melded together and were very complimentary to the fish.  Will definitely make again.

This was very good, however I used only 1 tablespoon of capers (I thought 4 tbsp were overkill).  Being Greek, we liked the kalamata olives and we use tomato base for a lot of fish recipes.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This is a very good flounder recipe.  I did it without the olives, and it still tasted great.  I'd go easy on the capers because this is a very salty dish.  Overall, it's really good and definitely a keeper in my house.

Very tasty.  My family loved it even my kids.  All the spices and tomotoes go together so well.  I will make again.

This recipe was amazing.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used canned.  The left over sauce was added to spaghetti the next day!  Yummy!

This is a different and delicious way to serve flounder. It was very flavorful. I did substitute cherry tomatoes for the plum tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.

Wonderful!  My husband doesn't like onions, but he couldn't even taste them!  I didn't have olives but it still turned out great.  Everyone said it tasted like something from a restaurant.

I made this sauce separate from the fish and used Tilapia just because its what I had on hand.  The sauce was pretty good but very salty.  My family ate it but thought it was a little strange.  I probably wont make this again since it didnt receive a great reception.

Delicious!  Made it just the way the recipe says, and we loved it.  Good left over, too.
