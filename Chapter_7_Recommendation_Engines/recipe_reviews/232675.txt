This recipe is similar to the one I use from America's Test Kitchen.  They also use the cold oven method but set the oven to 400º, rotating foil-lined pan halfway through cooking, cook time 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size of bacon slices and size of baking sheet.  I have found using the convection setting my bacon is crispy in about 10 minutes.  Another tip, if putting a little water on the slices before baking, they lay perfectly flat, no curling.

This is how I always cook my bacon now. It's absolutely foolproof and I get perfect bacon every time. NOTE: After I pull the bacon off, I use a spatula to help scrape the grease into a jar to save for cooking.

I think you'll find that your cooking time depends on how thick your bacon is, as well as how quickly your oven heats up.  I used center cut regular bacon, and it took about 16-17 minutes.  What was interesting to me is that the bacon didn't shrink up much, and turned out perfectly cooked with no mess in the oven.  I left the bacon grease solidify a bit, rolled up the foil, and just pitched it in the trash.  Once you get your timing down, this is a great way to cook bacon.

First I would like to clarify a misconception about Canadians and bacon: people think we eat "Canadian Bacon", which is actually either "back bacon" or glorified ham. Sure we eat that...occasionally, like anybody else, BUT we DO know what bacon is, and that is what we eat when we refer to bacon - the long glorious strips of salty, greasy fried bacon just like you Americans. And we LOVE it! I don't know why back bacon has become known as "Canadian Bacon", because it's just not the bacon we cook most and love!
Now I would like to make 3 comments on my experience with this recipe:
1. Super easy, but depending on thickness of bacon, adjust time. My oven also has "hot spots" so i need to rotate the cookie sheets.
2. CAREFUL when taking out/moving cookie sheets, there may be a lot of grease. Once the grease spilled out and burst into flames in the bottom of the oven...made a huge mess that was hard to clean!
3. My oven takes WAY longer than the 14ish minutes it's supposed to take to heat up...just watch bacon, depending on thickness. Take out when a little under-done or 'just' done, don't over do it unless you like very crispy bacon.
Cheers from your neighbors to the North!

Perfect bacon.  This is the way the military "fries" bacon to serve in it's Mess halls.   Learned this back in 1967 when I was in the Army's Cook's school. Time saving and perfect crisp bacon for the troops. My wife loves my bacon and all the meals I cook. Still use many of my Mom's recipes for one pot or skillet meals she taught me when in high school.

I have been cooking bacon in a preheated oven for some time, but it turned out like pan fried bacon: shriveled and greasy.  Joseph's method turns out picture perfect bacon!  It hardly shriveled at all, and had a wonderful texture.  I don't know why a simple change makes such a difference, but why question it?  The answer is BACON.  Thanks, Joseph!!

This recipes is fantastic.  I used to think, "Why would I need a recipe for bacon?"  Then I tried it.  WOW.  The apotheosis of perfect, easy bacon.  Do yourself a favor:  Make the bacon.

What have I been doing to bacon my entire life???  Thank you for this amazing recipe!  Will never go back to pan frying this delicious cut of pork.  One FYI - tent the baking sheet with more foil...it may get messy inside your oven if you don't.

The only thing I did different was to put a cooling rack on a cookie sheet then put the bacon on the cooling rack, the bacon doesn't sit in grease while cooking. I used Oscar Meyer Center-cut Bacon it took about 12 minutes once the oven reached 425. 
What a super way to make bacon.

I always bake my bacon starting in a cold oven.  I heard it helps render more of the fat out.  I should like excessive use of aluminum foil in this recipe, since my retirement is strongly tied to this commodity, but it is really not needed.  Clean up is easy without it.  I used to use a rack but quit because it was a pain to clean.  I did not see a significant change in the final product.

I only bake bacon and am anxious to try Joseph's cold oven start.  I cook up the whole pound no matter how much I need and store the rest in the frig or freezer.  Pre-cooked bacon is so handy to have on hand and by doing your own you can use much better bacon than what the stores offer precooked.

This is the only way that I make bacon. You can also use parchment paper instead of foil. Try sprinkling on fresh ground pepper and brown sugar together. Heaven!

I always use the broiler rack so I can keep the bacon fat for cooking in and seasoning. My oven does best at 375 degrees. No more splatter on the stove top for me.

This works great.  The only difference is that I use parchment paper on the bottom and the top.

Excellent way to cook a lot of bacon. Bacon was crispy and not overcooked. I used Oscar Meyer Center Cut Bacon. I timed it for 12 minutes and it needed more time. In my case 3 more minutes. Watch it carefully.  You can tell the bacon is almost done when little bubbles appear. It will cook a little more when you remove it from the oven. I think cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the bacon. Just remove bacon from pan and place on a paper towel. Blot grease off and it is ready to eat.

Simply put this is the way to cook bacon! Just tried it for the first time this morning – used thick cut apple smoked bacon and a large baking sheet lined with foil as per the instructions – wow! Best bacon - The strips stay large – did not shrivel – and the bacon was scrumptious – and super easy cleanup – in fact no cleanup – just bunched up the foil when cooled and threw it away.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe – I'm teaching my kids to do it this way too - great idea!

Tried this before reading Joseph's recipe and was not so impressed.  Used Joseph's recipe except a little lower heat for thinner bacon and totally loved it.  The best thing is how it doesn't shrink up and get all squirrelly. Thanks Joseph.

I hated making bacon because of all the grease splattering all over my cooktop.  It always was such a mess to clean up afterwards. I have no idea why it doesn't splash all over the oven, when you bake it, but it doesn't. This is a simple and fantastic way to add bacon to your menu!

So simple, and starting with a cold oven makes absolute sense-slowly warming the cold bacon up to getting crisp and yummy! Thanks so much.

I have been baking my bacon for over a year now.  It took me a few tries to get used to it.  I was used to either microwaving it or frying it.   I do spray the foil w/some cooking spray because for some reason even w/all the grease the bacon would stick and the foil would tear creating flipping issues.  I do turn my bacon over half way through.  8 minutes each side.   I have done both the pre-heated and not pre-heated method, and the not pre-heated works great.  Saves on the electric bill and time!

 I like the way the bacon doesn't shrink and cooks to a perfect crispness and chewiness at the same time.  I cook the whole pound, and then refrigerate the left overs for the next few days, just give it a 15 second zap in the microwave when I want it.  It definitely to saves some time being able to cook the rest of the meal w/out having to constantly watch the bacon and have grease splatter everywhere from the frying pan on the stove top.

Tried this for the first time this morning....it's a winner already. 
I had to cook it for a couple more minutes and at the last I put the 'fan-bake' on and it crisped it beautifully.
My Sunday mornings just got a whole lot easier!
Thank you!!!!

Outstanding bacon -- perfect crispness and not too greasy. Used in a much-needed breakfast sandwich after a late night on Halloween.

A pound of regular-cut bacon takes two cookie sheets. I rotated the pans at the seven minute mark to get even cooking. The bacon was not finished cooking at 15 minutes so I rotated the pans again and cooked them for three more minutes.  It took another four minutes after that.

Although it is true that the bacon cooks perfectly and doesn't curl up like when cooked in a frying pan, it still seemed liked a lot of trouble. It required four layers of aluminum foil and I had to deal with the bacon multiple times during the 22 minutes it took to cook.

If I do this again, I'll try adding some flavors like maple or brown sugar (or something savory) to make it more interesting.

Update:  I found that using thick cut bacon takes half of the space -- one large baking sheet can contain a whole pound of bacon.

I learned the method 30 years ago while in Culinary School. I use the foil but put the bacon on a rack and let the drippings fall off away from the bacon.

So, my only problem with this is that we rarely eat bacon. When we do, I usually cook up 3-4# in the oven - I can only have a cold oven ONCE! :). I use my convection setting @ 385 and last time did 2 trays at once, rotating them once during the 14 or so minutes. I wrapped my baking sheet in foil. Then I used disposable grill trays upside down on the foil wrapped tray. I gave it a little squirt with Pam then draped the bacon over the grill tray. It cam out GREAT. On the last batch (there were 3#'s, 3 batches) I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the bacon. We had BLT's and a container of left over cooked bacon that needs just a quick warm in my cast iron pan! It will NOT survive my son.

I see no reason to put strips 1/2 inches apart.  I Place mine close together to save space.  Strips shrink and so far I have not noticed  problems.  Othewrwise, right on target  thanks

I have been cooking bacon in the oven for as long as i can remember. I put the oven at 400 though and depending on the thickness of the bacon I cook it for 10 to 14 minutes.

I actually heated the oven to 380°. I covered a large cookie sheet with tinfoil. I placed the Baco tight but not overlapping and baked it for 20 minutes. I removed it from the oven and placed paper towel over it until it cooled and then I placed  paper towel  on another cookie sheet and placed the bacon on top and left it cool more. Then I transferred the bacon into Ziploc bags and put it in the freezer. Now when I make breakfast I simply take out a few strips of bacon and place them in the microwave for 30 seconds.

The bacon turned out very tasty and crisp but I had to leave them in for 22 minutes to get them crispy the way we like them. At 14 minutes they still looked a bit undercooked. Either way, I liked using this method way more than making it in the frying pan and there was no mess to clean up!

Great Method!! especially when you're cooking a lot of bacon for a lot of people :) if you want really crispy, this is perfect, less crispy bacon lovers in your family? take some out a bit early or add more bacon a couple of mins later after starting.  People sometimes forget the method can be just as important as the measure of ingredients.  Oven bacon.. perfect every time!

No one has addressed the gas/electric oven question.  My electric oven takes about 20 minutes to reach 400 degrees and I still need about 14 minutes for the bacon to reach the desired degree of doneness.

I use parchment paper instead of foil.  The typical roll is oversized enough to wrap nicely around a large baking sheet.  Never had a leak and absorbs versus floats the fat.  Thanks for the cold oven tip. MJB

This is the only way I cook my bacon! Great method with one exception,  I put the bacon on a wire cooling rack in my pan so the bacon isn't sitting in the grease, it drips down into the pan as it's baking.

So easy to do. I didn't have to stand over the oven. Just set a timer and went to cut my tomato and lettuce. I cook my bacon @350 for 28 minutes.  DON'T PREHEAT the oven. Put the bacon in the cold oven. Now you will have a slow cook on the bacon. Then I added my own style  things I did different is I turned the pan evry 7 minutes {all 4 sides} all sides get turned to the back of the oven.   For a wonderful seasoning I brushed «Dean Jacobs roasted pecan flavored syurp»on the raw bacon before I put it in time the oven, then 14 minutes in. Take it out and brush it again and grind «OLDE THOMPSON Hot & Spicy seasoning».  I also used a broiler pan instead of a cookie sheet.  In the broiler  grease just falls into the  bottom pan.  When I'm done cooking a pounds of baocon I let the pan rest for about 5 mins. Then drain the grease in the grease pan. I cook my bacon @ 350 degrees because I cooked private selection apple wood Thick Sliced center cut bacon.

OMG! I'll never cook bacon on the stove top again. This way save me from getting burnt from grease popping out of the skillet usually on my arms or hands when I'm reaching in the skillet to turn the bacon over. This way is the Greatest! THANK U! Joseph

We use a broiler pan, which allows the bacon grease to drip through and away from the bacon.  Otherwise, good recipe.

This is my favorite way to cook bacon, and the best part - easy cleanup! Ovens will vary, so keep an eye on the time and also keep in mind thicker bacon will take a few minutes longer. I often save the grease in a jar for other uses, like frying eggs. Otherwise, just fold up the foil and toss!

I lay the bacon on a rack above the aluminum lined jelly roll pan, that way the bacon isn't laying in the grease and comes out much crispier and less greasy.  I've been using this same recipe, start out cold and heat to 425 for at least 35 years.  Thank you for written instructions I can share with children and grandchildren.  I never write anything down.  Can't even imagine anyone not having terrific results cooking their bacon.  It's way too easy to mess up.

My mother showed me how to cook bacon like this when I was just a teenager. Thick cut bacon does work best and I set the oven on 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, give or take a few minutes. I use foil on the baking sheet and after its cooled off, I crumple the foil and throw it in the trash.  No mess and perfectly straight and crispy bacon everytime!

I just got this recipe this morning 6/12/15 and thought I would try it since I already had thick sliced bacon I the house. I followed the recipe exactly! It was perfect! The best thing I ever tried for bacon to come out just crispy enough and neat looking. The second best part was the easy clean up after bacon fat cooled, just wrap the foil a little and throw it away, no mess to clean up! I wish i had this method 40 years ago!!! I will never cook bacon any other way. Thank you!

This beats standing there cooking the bacon with splatters of grease on me and the stove! The bacon came out great...crispy and in uniform flat strips with no bubbles of fat or curled up like on the stovetop. Right now, my oven is having temp issues that need to be addressed, so I did have to pull one batch out sooner as they were almost burning. Just go by your own oven. I did the last batch at 400 deg, and that temp seemed to work fine. I'll use that temp or lower in the future. The bacon stuck to the foil when my oven temp went higher. Thanks Joseph...great method for bacon prep that I'll be sure to use again!

The BEST...the ONLY way to prepare bacon is this oven method.  Goodbye grease-spattered stovetop, wall, clothing, and arms/hands.  Let your oven take care of makin' bacon.

Perfect! Bacon is crispy and fat melts in your mouth. I used a slightly thicker, fattier cut of bacon so baked for 21 minutes.

Great idea for cooking bacon. BUT it does depend on your oven. Mine was only up to 260 degrees after 14 minutes. I gave it another 8 and it still wasn't up to 425. I pulled the bacon though and it was still good. It just takes some ovens longer to heat up. I will try it again and maybe not start with the cold oven.

Easy, yes, but accurate cook time, no.  After the allotted 12-14 minutes, the bacon was still raw and I used regular thickness bacon, not thick bacon as he suggests.  Would not make it this way again unless I'm making it for a big crowd and I would plan on doubling the cooking time.

It didn't shrinkl I placed mine on a rack so it wouldn't lay in the grease. Mine took 22 minutes in a NG oven. Easy clean up.

It’s a pretty easy way to make bacon. One thing. Don’t rely on the time suggested. It varies wildly, based on your bacon’s thickness and the crispness you desire. I use very thick (Wright’s) and it can easily take 16-17 minutes to get close to how I like mine.

I've been cooking bacon like this for 30+ years. No standing by the stove avoiding the hot spatter, no greasy stove top and counters to clean up and the best tasting bacon ever. For some reason oven baked bacon doesn't spatter like it does in a pan on the stove top, so no messy oven. If you haven't tried this easy method yet, what are you waiting for? You'll be happy you did!

I use a large baking sheet pan and remove slices as they are done and add more slices until I have cooked 2 lbs. I drain on paper towels and then layer between clean paper towels, put in a zip loc bag and freeze.  When I want a couple slices I remove them from the bag lay on a paper towel and microwave for 30 to 35 seconds. This way only one clean up and 2 lbs. of bacon ready to heat and eat.

I agree with the comment that the heat was too high.  I usually cook at 350.

I also drain (when I drain) on draining racks.  Using paper towel  means you are soaking it in it's own grease.  using a rack will allow it to crisp up better.

I crumple a sheet of foil for bottom of  shallow  large cookie pan, with sides,  and place a long cookie cooling rack in it.  I can do 10 slices of long bacon at a time.  I did 20 slices.  After cooling I placed in an upside  down cheese holder with wax paper between each layer of bacon.  Then put in freezer.  Then when I fix myself an egg I heat one slice of bacon in a  skillet or even the microwave with a cover over it.  So much nicer than frying bacon every day and having to get rid of grease.  I store the grease in a jar under my cabinet until full then dispose in garbage sack...still in the jar with a tight lid.  pickle jars and jelly jars make good containers.  I dont reuse the grease as not good fore arteries.   Becky

Probably the only person on the planet that thought the bacon was greasier than making it on the stove. Lifting a hot tray with grease swimming and trying not to drop the tray is a bit scary. Back to the stove top for me! Glad others liked this method as it is good to find cooking methods that are helpful to busy cooks.

Simple and straightforward recipe but like many of the other reviewers, the cook time totally depends on how thick your bacon is. With the cold oven method and only 15 minutes, my bacon was nowhere near cooked thoroughly enough. So I took it out of the oven, flipped the pieces over and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Came out perfect! I also added a little brown sugar and black pepper on them before I initially put them in the oven. The bacon came out crispy, with a hint of sweetness and the kick of the pepper was great.

What did I do wrong, My oven temp is accurate, but even after reaching 425 it took another 17 minutes. I used the middle rack, should I have used the bottom rack.  I used Hormel Black label thick sliced which is not really that thick.  Thanks for any help.

I learned to cook bacon this way 43 years ago at a restaurant that I used to work at.  I have added another twist to save my house from smelling like bacon for hours though.  These days I cook it out in my gas BBQ using it's oven.  My backyard backs-up to a golf course so I do receive a large amount of requests for samples from all of the golfers that pass bye.  I was thinking of setting up a little stand and sell BLT's.

Oh, yes. The easiest and best way to cook bacon, ever. I've been doing this for forty+ years. I even do this in a toaster oven when cooking a few slices just for one serving.  Sometimes I will put a bit of the bacon fat in a skillet for fried eggs, yummy!

Used a rack so that the bacon would not be in the grease.  I drain the grease into a jar and place in refrigerator to use when I sauté kale, spinach, corn, etc. ---Linshine

This was my first recipe as a new user! I had to increase the cook time to 20-25 minutes as it took forever for my oven to warm up, but it came out nice and crisp! Going to use it for BLT salad this evening!!!

This recipe is SO EASY!!  My oven takes a little longer than 14 minutes to get the bacon to the crispy state, more like 20 minutes.  I use Heavy Duty aluminum foil because it's wider and fits the baking sheet better.  I tried two sheets of regular foil but the grease seeps through the overlapping part and I end up having to wash the pan (which is what we're trying to avoid by using the foil) It's such a great way to cook bacon - no more grease splattering all over the stove, or on me! The house doesn't smell of bacon for days after baking it this way, and the bacon can cook on it's own while I work on whatever I'm making to go with it. Thank You Joseph for sharing this wonderful way to prepare BACON!!

I've done this for a long time, however, in addition to lining a cookie sheet (with raised edges a must!!!), take a slightly smaller sheet and crinkle it a bit.  I roll the sheet, wops it up a bit, and sorta, kinda make it flattish.  This way the grease pools a little, & for some reason, the bacon gets crispier, and drippings don't "slosh" so much when removing pan from oven.   (Belated thanks to the late Ione, a cafeteria worker in the school cafeteria when I was in high school 55 years ago).  Timing & temperature is of course, your own.  I calibrate my oven frequently, by hanging a oven thermometer in the middle of the oven, heating the oven to 350 degrees (any temp will do) and checking the thermometer to verify.  If it's "off" I re-verify 10 minutes later, & if still "off" I make a note of it right by the stove. This way I avoid any possible "oops's" that can occur.  I admire Joseph's bravery in leaving bacon unsupervised, but I prefer not to.  I also thank him and all those who take the time to share with all of us!  Blessings!!!

I've made it this way since I saw it done in a restaurant kitchen. It's soooooo much easier then messing w/ frying or broiling!!! An you get beautiful, flat, crispy bacon every time!! I stick mine in once the oven preheats to 400. An if whatever else I'm making is going to take awhile I'll cook it at 350 so it takes longer.

Wow, this was a fabulous way to make BLT's in 30 minutes, (3 lbs of bacon for 4 teenagers and hubby!)) no standing over the burning flames of fire for an hour! The cold oven was definitely the key.  I cooked a pound at a time, so they overlapped some and were still perfect
Thank you!

This works! A longer cooking time (depending on how your oven runs) will also yield great crispy bacon. I saw recently that Ina Garden makes her bacon this way too, but starts with a hot oven and a different temp.

Bacon tastes so much better cooked in the oven!  This is definitely my preferred method of cooking now. I just found a recipe to make a large batch of fried eggs on a baking sheet in the oven that takes about the same amount of time. Breakfast is served!

From how I interpreted the directions, it appears that you have to put the bacon in a cold oven, let it heat to 425 then cook for 14 minutes.  I had to take my bacon out before the oven got to 425, it was crispy but burnt.  I did like the convenience of it and the fact that I didn't have to clean grease off of my stove top after cooking bacon.  Will try again using a lower temperature.

Certainly one of the easiest ways to make bacon! For me, it took much longer than 14 minutes, however, and I lost track of the total amount of time. Also, I noticed each slice was jus slathered in its oil and I really had to pat off the excess. I am excited to make this again after reading the tips about coating the slices in water so they stay flat and laying on a cooling sheet so they don't cook in the oil. Thanks for the recipe and all the helpful reviews!

I hardly ever cook a pound of bacon at a time, so I made a few minor revisions. I place 5 to 6 slices of thick cut bacon in a cold oven. Turn the heat to 425 convect bake, flip the bacon after 15 minutes and cook for an additional 7 minutes. Place the cooked bacon on a cooling rack, it’s crispier that way as opposed to placing the bacon on paper towels.

This (apparently foolproof) method yielded me a half-pound of absolutely gorgeous, mahogany-colored bacon! I was skeptical that it would actually be as easy as it sounded, so I initially set the timer for 10 minutes. When it went off, I looked in, and thought “HA! I just KNEW it wouldn’t work!”  The bacon was pretty flabby and raw-looking still - looked like it would.take at least another 10 minutes - but what he says about the “magic” that takes place at 425 degrees is spot-on! - I let it go to the 14-minute mark, and voila’ - gorgeous, perfect bacon!  I’ll never cook it any other way.  THANK YOU!

I love this recipe!  Bacon is a favorite breakfast meat in my house.  I hated dealing with the grease splatter when cooking it on the griddle.  Cooking it in the oven is so convenient and it comes out just as good as frying it.

This is a terrific way to cook bacon, I've  done it several times, probably won't go back to pan frying - except for the foil waste it's perfect.  Trying it with turkey bacon now, but I'm keeping my eye on it!

It took much longer than 14 minutes to cook the bacon.  I used thick sliced like the recipe suggested but it took at least 25 -30 minutes.  I will make it again but will make note of the timing.

Also didn't think I needed a recipe for bacon and hubby was even grumbling about what I was doing. SURPRISE, we both loved it. (And for him to love something he was complaining about is quite a feat.) I will cook it this was from now on!!!

The cook times will vary depending on the type of oven  that is being used. I find that electric cooks faster than gas.  I use the convection  gas bake setting at 350 for  about 8 minutes. Then crank up the temp to 400, crack your eggs onto the sheet, and bake for 3 minutes. Perfectly cooked runny eggs!

I have cooked bacon this way all of my life...  People are always amazed by this...  It is by far the best way to cook bacon..  I save the grease in a jar and keep in the refrigerator to use in all kinds of great food...

The extra thick cut bacon was almost done cooking when the oven reached 410?. So I dropped it to 400? and cooked it for an extra 7 minutes. That's all that was needed turned out great.

Wow....This worked really well! Crispy, but NOT BURNT! I did have to leave the bacon in the oven a bit longer, but my oven takes a while to heat up.  I also rotated the baking pan, and flipped the bacon over. Be sure to watch it while it's baking to avoid burning it;-) Happy cooking!

My bacon came out great and tasted just like it always does when I fry it in the skillet.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because after 14 minutes (what the recipe called for) my bacon was still undercooked.  It probably took about 20 minutes or so to get it cooked, crispy the way we like it.

The best oven baked bacon recipe EV-AH! We test far more bacon types and brands using this batch method. This way we (only my bacon lovin’ family) can eat & judge together. We have baked thick & center cuts, high end brands, name brands & local brands. The family seems to seek out new brands to bring home for a test run.

It does work beautifully, far less messy than on the stove top.  I make a lot of bacon when I cook it so it did require a few trips to the oven, however, it would have been far longer to do batches in a pan.  love it will only make bacon this way from now on.

Cooking bacon in the oven was so easy. Clean up was fast using the foil liner. Bacon was crispy and not greasy. Will cook bacon like this for now on. It's delicious!

I've been preparing my bacon in the oven for a few years now and have always had to monitor it  and flip it over halfway.  It almost always turned out overdone.  Using this method, it turned out much better.  Although I did have to cook it about 10 minutes longer.  It seems like my oven takes longer than usual to heat up.  At the 14-minute timer mark, the bacon was definitely not done.  I flipped the bacon over and added another 10 minutes of bake time and it was perfect.

Oven temps really vary.  So, it’s very very important to start checking the bacon 5 minutes before the recommended time and temp.   IF you want it ‘perfect’ ONLY you can decide when it’s done - not a timer and oven temp.

We did this on a commercial basis for a restaurant and I just got so spoiled with that  size of parchment paper.  I finally went to a restaurant supply and was surprised at the price...$28 for 1000 sheets so makes it worth it to keep a box on the top of the  fridge. Rather than aluminum foil I HIGHLY recommend a sheet of parchment paper.  I use it for lots of things...don't have to wash much.

Use parchment paper instead of foil. Doesn't stick, doesn't rip. Oven bacon is sooo much easier!

This is the only way I make bacon after learning about it 10 years or more ago. Always perfect and I like crispy bacon so I usually have to wait between 20 - 25 minutes. It is a long time when smelling the wonderful aroma, but certainly worth the wait. Clean up is a breeze and no messy stove top to address either.

Works well. Cooks even and is really good. Makes it nice if you have a large pan to use.

I have been baking bacon this way for over a year now. It is the best and easiest way. I started doing it this way because I thought it would be faster and quicker. It is.  Oven doesn’t have to be on as long. Comes out perfect.

This is a great way to have crispy bacon without the mess of frying, grease spattering, etc.  I use a broiler pan, spray the top with cooking spray and bake at 350 until crisp.  The bacon drains as it cooks, with minimum mess to clean up.

This works, but if you have a microwave and not much time,
line a plastic or other oven proof plate with two thicknesses of paper towels and lay strips of bacon down so they do not overlap. Cover with 2 paper towels and cook on high for  one minute per slice. Timing depends on microwave strength, so check for doneness after first two minutes.

I have used this method in the past, but can't now because the oven I have currently uses an extra element to speed up preheating, which would burn the bacon, even if I used a lower setting. People who are having problems may have a similar oven. If the manual warns you to not put anything in there during preheating, they mean it. I'm pretty sure gas ovens might give a different result, also - better most likely.  Also, this method tends to be messy, but it's hard to beat if you have a big crowd to feed. The two sided grill is a much cleaner fast way to cook bacon. I am disappointed not being able to cook bacon in the oven, but console myself with pre-cooked bacon. ;o)

Been doing this for years.  Hate the mess of pan  frying.  I start with a hot oven (400 degs) and bake 15 to 20 min.  It all depends on the bacon thickness and your oven.  No matter your method the oven the way to go!

Bacon is great, I love it crispy!
One problem, please consider not using aluminum foil while cooking, serving or storing your food. Your food absorbs the aluminum which your are then ingesting into your body.  It is hard to eliminate aluminum from you body, it just accumulates causing damage.  Aluminum is very toxic to your body and brain.

Wish I had known this years ago...This is THE ONLY WAY to cook bacon!  I turn up all of the edges of the foil. I SLANT THE FOILED COOKIE SHEET SO  GREASE COLLECTS AND ONE END and is drained as it cooks.  Pan remains slanted after I remove it from oven to put the drained bacon on paper towels. When cool,..Just wrap greasy foil and throw away.  I use HEAVY FOIL for safety and better overall cooking.  NO MESSY STOVE AREA!!

I’ve somewhat perfected this method by trial and error. I preheat to 400* and line the pan with parchment. I check the bacon around 18 minutes as the thickness of the bacon varies the cook time but usually it’s done the way I like between 20-23 minutes. Try drizzling maple syrup over the slices and sprinkling a little onion powder. Yum

My bacon sems to take a few minutes longer.  Probably my oven which takes a long time to reach temp.  I make extra bacon slices to add to sandwiches or chopped on salad.

I have been making bacon like this for years, using the cold oven method, but I only cook at it at 400 degrees and the time depends on the thickness of bacon.  You need to start checking after 10-12 minutes, otherwise, you may have super crisp or burnt bacon.  Super easy to clean up too.  No grease splatter either.

I like your idea of starting with a cold oven.  I put bacon strips on a non-stick 12" X 17""cake cooling rack over a jelly roll pan.  After cooking, let grease cool & it scrapes easily into a container to toss.

I agree the oven is the best and easiest way to cook bacon.  I preheat my oven though and do not line my baking sheet.  I put the bacon strips directly on the sheet.  Once crispy (12 - 14 minutes depending on bacon thickness), I remove the bacon and roll up in paper towels.  I drain the grease into a small bowl, and immediately rinse the sheet with water.  It comes clean quickly - no messy foil to try to fold up, etc.  Been doing it this way for a very long time.

I usually do the same, but layer the whole pound of bacon, even overlapping some.  After a few minutes, I then separate all the bacon, so it doesn't stick to each other.  Comes out perfect each and every time.

Would have given it 5 starts if I hadn't left it in another 5-7 minutes to crisp it up (may be the type of bacon I used).

THANK YOU! No more burning bacon in the pan for me anymore!

I use a large cookie sheet and  place a whole pound of bacon on it. I find it takes about 20 minutes to get the bacon the way we like it. However, there are SO many advantages to this method: 1)ALL the pieces are evenly done; 2) no greasy stove or skillet to clean,  3) I can cook the rest of the meal while the bacon cooks. Tastes better than in the microwave, too. This is a gem...Thanks, Joseph!

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised as well as impressed with this. I had tried other oven baked bacon methods and they paled in comparison to this one. 
This method did not alter the bacon flavor, rather it actually was a very close equal to pan fried bacon only without all of the splatter mess associated with pan frying.

I have been using this method for years and love it.  I like his suggestion of starting the process with a cold oven.   It does make for crispier bacon.  I use the oven on convection for more even cooking.  In the summer I use my barbeque grill, just forming a pan out of heavy duty foil.  No mess in the house at all.

Easy!  It took me longer than 14 minutes because we like our bacon throughly cooked but not burnt.  Next time I will use a rack to keep the bacon out of the grease.  This will probably affect the timing as well.  5 stars for easy clean up!  Thank you Joseph for sharing your recipe!

Although the 1 star rating says 'couldn't eat it', that would have been if we tried to eat it using the cooking time recommended.  We have an electric range and had to at least double the cooking time before it was edible. Definitely not worth the trouble and would not make it again - easier to use the microwave and keep cooking it 4-5 pcs. at a time.  Don't waste your time, sorry to say.  I was excited to try it and very disappointed in the outcome.

My oven must take a lot longer to heat up than most as it took 20 minutes and that was with regular thickness bacon , not even the thick sliced. 
It was easy with no turning though and stayed flat and much less shrinkage.

Great way to make bacon, though I needed to bake it for 20 minutes. The bacon doesn't curl which makes it great for BLTs!

We love it!  Bacon is cooked perfectly and doesn't splatter your oven!  The only downside is that it is laying in grease after it cooks, but placing it between two paper towels remedies that problem
Bacon is cooking as you prepare the rest of your meal.

This sounded interesting so I thought I would give it a try, and this is now the only way I will cook bacon! Used thick cut bacon and once oven was up to 425 it only took 9 minutes to be cooked perfectly, guess our oven takes a little longer to heat up. Then thought I would try it at 400 and found 14 minutes was perfect. Bacon comes out laying flat and all cooked the same. No more babysitting a fry pan full of bacon and reaching around it to cook eggs. Thanks for sharing this Joseph!

I've tried doing bacon in the oven before, but it just didn't turn out very well, so I had to try this process. I think putting it into a cold oven is definitely the key. I ended up adding two minutes onto the roasting time, but I was also using thick-cut bacon. I will definitely be doing this again.

This was so easy to prepare!  I laid a pice of aluminum foil over the bacon for the first  approximately 13 minutes, then removed  to finish cooking!  Great way to prepare bacon!

Loved this way of cooking bacon! I flipped it towards the end of cooking time and also addded a couple minutes due to the bacon being nice and thick. Easy cleanup.

Excellent recipe.  I used to work in a restaurant and this is how we cooked bacon for large groups.  You can lower the temperature to 400 degrees depending on the thickness of the bacon, just keep an eye on it regardless.
You should also cook your bacon cold and if using a fry pan also put the bacon in cold and then turn on the heat.  This minimizes shrinkage regardless of your cooking technique.

The Navy taught me this method years ago when my husband was going through Supply Corps school. Two tips to add to this or ANY bacon cooking...get your bacon to ROOM TEMP before cooking and roll then unroll your bacon package into a tight roll before opening and you will lift each piece separately..

Didn't work in the time indicated. In fact it took a total of 27 minutes. Most ovens take 10 minutes just to preheat. I finally did get crispy bacon but not in the time listed.

My son in law taught me this trick and then I shared with him about lining the pan with aluminum foil! 
This is the only way to do bacon now! No splattering of grease all over the stove, counters and floor! Easy clean up! And my hair and clothes don't smell of bacon all day!

Usually flip bacon 1/2 way through.  Set my oven to 400 usually and time depends on cut of bacon.

The ONLY way to cook bacon. No mess! Cooking time will depend on the thickness and quality of your bacon.

Hay, someone else finally thought of cooking bacon in the oven. I been cooking bacon like that for a year or 2 now.  I tell people I cook it like  that around here and people look at me like I had 2 heads.  I start with a cold oven too, but then I start with a cold oven with everything. Don't think I ever heated it up first. And also I put a rack from an indoor  grill left over from mother's things and put the bacon on there and I have a  drip pan under it. Just take a drip pan and a rack from a table top grill and put the bacon on the  rack and rack  on the drip pan. All the grease goes in the drip pan. How do you get all the grease to stay on a cookie sheet? I never thought of that let alone try it.  Also I don't put my oven at 400º  I put my oven on about  340º (maybe a little lower, my oven isn't accurate) and cook bacon for a ½ hour because I like my bacon like the restaurants, not crispy.  I look now and then to see if the bacon is ''bubbling'' up and down each slice and that is usually a good indication it's done.

Place the bacon in a COLD over,  set to 400 degrees and cook for 16-20 minutes, depending on desired crispness.   PS, cleanup is easy if you let the grease solidify, then remove the foil from the pan.

This is absolutely the best way to cook bacon. The only thing I would add is that you should place a metal cookie rack under the bacon and use a large rectangular pan under the rack. Makes it easy to discard the grease and having the bacon off the surface of the pan helps it cook through.

I always  make my bacon this way with one slight modification. I place the foil on the bottom of the pan (for easy clean up) but then I insert a  double-cross wired cooling rack on top of the foil so the fat drains off the bacon for less greasy bacon. And Jones Dairy Cherrywood bacon is the only bacon I buy--it is the BEST bacon I have ever tasted.

I always bake my bacon now.  I use a toaster oven (there's only me) on 400.  I line a toaster-oven sized baking sheet with foil.  Then I put the little baking rack  (that came with the baking sheet) that's been sprayed with Pam on the foil-lined baking sheet.   I set my toaster oven to 400, set a timer for 15-20 minutes (I like my bacon super crisp) and prepare the rest of my breakfast.  Using the rack means I don't have to turn the bacon; and it doesn't sit in the grease.  After baking, I put the bacon on paper towels to blot excess grease- and I have terrific, perfect bacon.

Absolutely the only way to cook bacon.  Simple & easy.  Personally, I cook it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Afterwards I also save the grease to use when cooking other things (like eggs)

I've cooked bacon often in the oven. I first heat the oven to 425 degrees, then place the bacon on a jelly roll baking pan in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the bacon. After that time I turn the bacon over, place it back in the oven and turn the oven off. I finish preparing breakfast and remove the bacon when I'm ready to serve, usually 5-10 minutes later. The bacon is perfect every time.

I just found this recipe today, but I've been cooking baking this way for years now.  It's much easier than cleaning up a fried up kitchen when frying on the stove.  I also cook it longer because I like a bit crispier piece of bacon.

I place two cookie racks on the foil lined jelly roll pan.  that way the grease drips below and the bacon is crisp but not greasy.  I got the cookie racks at the dollar store and keep them just for this purpose.

I like that if I have anything to go in the oven anyway, I have the oven hot without "wasting" the preheating time and gas.  If not, then no big deal...it's worth it just to not have grease spattered everywhere.   Will never make it any other way and will make sure everyone in my family knows about this awesome method.  Thanks!

When I made this and did what another chef recommended.   I covered the slices with a sheet of foil.  I don't know if this slowed cooking but it took almost a half hour.  It didn't shrink up but i wondered if it was well cooked.  Parts were crispy some not do much.  Doubt I will do this again.

Took 19-20 minutes in my oven but loved it! No grease spatters on my cooktop OR in my oven. Such a luxury to put bacon on my cookie sheet with its short rim, set the oven timer, and return to perfect bacon and a delicious smell. All I needed to do was eat the bacon and save the grease (another benefit I don't get in the microwave). Thank you, Joseph!

I used thick cut bacon. Took about 2 minutes longer, even on the convection setting. Recommend keeping a close eye on the bacon after the 14 minute mark. I used a shallow baking pan instead (like one you would use for a jelly roll) and placed a cooling rack inside the pan. I sprayed the cooling rack with PAM prior to placing the bacon on the rack. The bacon came out nice and crisy. All of the bacon grease dripped into the pan and was easily poured out when cooled.  Clean up was easy.

I started throwing my bacon in the oven a long time ago when I was too lazy to stand over the stove and watch it or I had too many other things going. I stuck with it because it tasted better and crispier but I never knew the science behind it, thanks Joseph.

I put a fine grid, 1/2"? squares, cooling rack over the cookie sheet and put the bacon on the rack, letting the grease drip into the pan as it cooks. Less greasy, more crispy. A little faster

Followed recipe exact and got perfect bacon! Soooo much easier then frying in a pan, where hot grease is splattering everywhere and your trying to use a fork to flatten the bacon so it doesnt curl up, then having to flip bacon over.  I will definitely be cooking bacon in the oven from now on.  Awesome recipe!

I've made this three times now and I'm still tinkering with the directions to get it just right.  I'm using regular cut full strips of bacon, on only one cookie sheet, dropping the temp to 375.  I like it and will keep after it!

I followed directions exactly using medium sliced organic bacon.  Like everybody else here says, this is the only way to cook bacon. My oven did not get spattered, and the bacon was flat and delicious.  Thank you Joseph!

Easy to make, not messy and bacon comes out crisp and delicious, even in my hinky oven.  Will never cook bacon in pan on stove again.

Bacon wasn't at all crisp. I know my operating oven temp is fine, but it must come up to temp more slowly than his. I went as high as 3 stars because, you know, it is bacon...

This worked great, and the time was perfect.  No mess to clean up, no smoke alarms going off, and bacon was crispy but not overdone.  I think the secret is starting in a cold oven.  Will be my go-to way for more than 3-4 slices from now on.  And who doesn't like leftover bacon for salads, next day eggs, etc???

Good idea, particularly for avoiding grease splatter.  i will probably do this again.  Didn't turn out as crispy as pan fried, even though I baked a couple minutes longer.  I used parchment paper and that worked well for the baking.  However, still had to deal with grease when I removed the greasy, cooled paper from the sheet pan - not as simple as just pouring the grease from the frying pan.

I've been cooking my bacon this way, for years, except I put mine in a cast iron skillet  instead, and only cook as much as I need at the time.  By putting it in a skillet, it's easier to pour off the bacon fat for later use.

This is also my go-to recipe and I've  been making bacon like this for several years now; however, instead of using aluminum foil, I use Parchment paper.  I also like to use thicker bacon, like, Wrights....so cooking times my vary.  

KEEP your bacon grease.....amazing uses.   I have a bowl in the refrigerator and I'll add it to everything....Eggs, burgers, sautéing whatever, etc.

I have been baking bacon like this for over ten years.  I was vacationing in Reno, Nv and was at a fabulous breakfast buffet when a cook came out with a huge refill tray of bacon.  I asked him how he cooked the bacon so perfectly and he gave me the details.  I was so happy as every time I ate there I just could not believe how PERFECTLY COOKED AND DELICIOUS it was!!!!!  LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

08-06-16 ~ This was a great way to cook the bacon while I prepared the salad and the dip that I was going to use it in. I chose to use a cooling rack as I wanted to save the bacon grease. In my oven the bacon took 25 minutes to get to the crispness I was looking for. Clean up was great and there was no mess in my oven. I will be using this method again.

I make my bacon this way always, it is so easy and I use a disposable very large foil pan, the size for buffet serving, because the higher sides keep the bacon fat from sputtering onto my oven bottom and no need for tin foil but I do coat the pan with butter spray first which helps crisp the bacon and keep it from sticking. We like crispy bacon so I cook for 20 minutes at 420 then turn and cook 10 minutes more at 400. Perfect.

Will never make bacon any other way again. I followed instructions exactly in smaller upper oven. Used thick cut "Wrights" brand hickory smoked bacon (the best there is IMHO). Came out absolutely perfect and clean up was a breeze. So glad I found this one. Thanks

Great method. Put thick-sliced bacon right on gold pan and it was done when oven hit 425 (~16 mins), cleaned up pretty easily. More uniform cook/less of a hassle than in skillet.

I always cook my bacon in the oven and it comes out great.  I tried this because I was curious if it would work.  My bacon was not done in the time limit quoted and I added about 5 minutes after turning the pieces over.  I like my bacon crispy and the extra time was definitely needed.

Such a great method to cook bacon. I really thought this might make a splattered grease mess out of my oven but it behaved properly! I didn't use thick sliced bacon but it wasn't the paper thin stuff either. I did bake it about 5 minutes longer than suggested just because @ 14 minutes it didn't look like it was quite to the degree I like. I like my bacon just a smidge chewy and not crumbly. It turned out really well and clean up was a breeze  - just allow the grease on the foil to solidify and toss in the trash.. You can also use the bacon grease to fry up your potatoes and eggs. The grease keeps for quite some time in the refrigerator.

The reviews were all so fantastic, maybe I did something wrong. My family complained that it was soggy and they didn't like the texture (rubbery). Next time I will try it in a cold oven described by one reviewer.

This was good but it is just as easy and quick to do bacon in the microwave. Layer a couple of sheets of paper towel on a flat microwave safe plate, put the bacon on the paper and cover with more paper towels. Cook on high. Start with one and a half minutes and in ten second increments until desired crispness. Obviously, more strips require more time. Bacon comes out flat and grease is mostly absorbed.

I used thick cut peppered bacon, and stuck to the instructions with exception of not allowing 1/2" between slices.  Turned out great, but at 14 minutes the bacon was far from done.  It took 20 minutes total, but for now on I'll know to set timer for 20 minutes - no problem!   And lots easier than using a broiling pan.  Definitely a do-again!

I do mine almost exactly the same however I also use a cooling rack...line the cookie sheet with foil place rack on cookie sheet then place the bacon on the rack the grease drips onto the foil lined pan and the bacon stays out of the grease. Perfect every time!!

Fabulous recipe for cooking bacon....worked perfectly for me!
I checked the bacon at 12 M but I needed the full 14M to cook the bacon.  Yes, I would make this recipe again...in fact, this will be the only way I will cook bacon rom now on.

Followed directions to the letter.  Did not cook/fry up as described. Will continue to cook up the whole package on my George Forman grill.  Now, that cooks bacon the way I like it and so much less clean up.

I have been cooking my bacon like this for some time now and it always comes out great. One thing I don't do that the reviewer says to do and that is leaving a space between the bacon slices. The bacon shrinks as it cooks so the slices separate on their own. Also, if you use heavy duty foil, you only need one sheet. The reason for the cold oven is that if you put the bacon into a hot oven, it can curl a little. Personally I never had a problem with putting it in a preheated oven, but this is the reason given for starting with a cold oven. Just an FYI in case you wondered why.

Made it! Used regular bacon. At 425 from a cold oven it took 23 minutes to get it crisp the way I like it. Used deep cookie sheet with drying rack inside so that I could pour the bacon grease into the container that I keep it in for future use---even including popcorn which was how my mom always made it. Yum! This is a great way to cook bacon. Will use from now on.

I fried for 30+ years. Then I switched to pre-heated oven for 10 years. Now this! Bacon perfection! Truly. P.E.R.F.E.C.T.I.O.N. If you haven't tried this - just do it. I'll never go back. Thanks for sharing!

Finished product = delicious!  Cook time, way off for me.  My oven wasn't even heated to 425 in 14 minutes so cook time for me was 35 minutes and I used thin sliced bacon.  Also you need a really big pan to do a whole pound!

Our family tried this last Sunday morning, & it was fantastic!  Easy to make & absolutely perfect bacon.  Didn't shrink & was just crispy enough without being tough.  Will make often!

I've been broiling my bacon for years.  That way the grease drips into the underlying pan.  Probably takes more attention than baking though because you do have to turn it to get it evenly done.

Perfect bacon with no mess. Great for when you are short on time and want a BLT or egg & bacon sandwich on the go. My family loves it.

Perfect.  After baking,
I left a few bacon on the sheet pan and placed back in the oven for 2-3 minutes.
