For having a recipe that was screwed up, it was a nice change. Happy mistakes are always a plus. This recipe was slightly dense, however I think it plays it into it's favor because it can easily be baked in a jelly roll style pan and made as snacking bars for after schoolers. I thought it still had a nice flavor, and I could taste both the banana and oatmeal. TY very much.

I was trying to find an egg-less recipe to use with my ripe bananas.  This was definitely a good choice.  I lessened the vegetable oil by one tablespoon because that was all I had on hand.  It turned out really good!  Great flavor and texture.

I thought that 1 cup of white sugar was a lot.  I cut it to 1/2 and it was good. I left the brown sugar as shown.   I also added chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.

I screwed up even further and forgot to add the vinegar to the milk.  It probably would have turned out better if I had.  And I always prefer butter to oil for taste.  
Moral of This Story: Don't get distracted when using a new recipe!!  :)
