My husband & I loved it! Followed recipe almost exactly. Cut zucchinis 1/4 in then quartered them. Did add 2 oz of cream cheese, as suggested in reviews. Probably will use 1 oz next time just to be healthier.Omitted bacon & onion bc don't like them @all. I'll add more zucchini next time too; 1 of my fav veggies. Didn't have mex cheese mix so used mont jack & mild cheddar mix. Was fine. Just sautéed corn & zucchini on med head, as directed. Removed frm heat, stirred in the cheeses & put back on med heat til all was melted. Garnished w freshly chopped cilantro. Def a winner & easy too! Tastes best eaten immedietely. Looses creaminess as it cools

I loved this dish once I removed the bacon pieces from mine. I only gave it 4 stars because I personally did not like the addition of the bacon on top so as the recipe is stated I am not at a full 5 stars. When I made the dish I thought the bacon was going to be the ingredient that set this over the top, but I am not sure if my bacon was way too salty and my corn was so sweet I just did not like the combo. I scrapped all the bacon off mine, but my husband said he loved as it was. I will be making this again and like the another review said they did not have the Kraft cheese so I followed their recommendation with the 2 oz of cream cheese and cheddar cheese, but I added a little taco seasoning to mine so it had the "mexican" flavor.

Very good.  In place of the Kraft Cheese I used 2 oz of low fat cream cheese (block style) and about 1 cup of shredded Mexican style cheese.

This was an ok side dish.  Out of my family of four I am the only one who cared for it, but even then I was not crazy about it.  It was too heavy and cheesy for a side dish.  Add some chicken and rice or potatoes, mix it up and I think it would be a great main dish.

Gosh I hate to review a recipe I only made halfway but just getting the corn, onions & zucchini sautéed smelled SO good we decided to cut the calories and quit right there.   Seasoned with a little Italian seasoning.   Will probAly do the cheesey version for guests someday!

Surprisingly delicious! I used yogurt instead of sour cream, and frozen corn- still got raving reviews.

It's not very often I come across a five star recipe that doesn't work out, but alas, this is one of them.  It has no flavor despite me adding garlic, salt & pepper.  The sour cream taste was overpowering.  Cream cheese would definitely work better.  I won't make this again.

As is, I found this to be a little bland. I added 2c of cooked shredded chicken and used cream cheese and then nacho/taco cheeses as suggested by other reviewers. I ended up needing to add some spices. I added onion salt, garlic powder, salt, and red pepper flakes. The added salt really brought out the flavor of the cheese--my husband even wondered if I used taco seasoning. I think in the future I may add some tomato chunks in at the end. I will definitely make this again, but will remember the changes I made.

I made this for dinner tonight and my family loved it. So simple and lots of flavor. I couldn't find the cheese it recommends, so I used cheddar with a bit of cream cheese. Will definitely be making this again.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe with the exception of the bacon and was not impressed.  However, I decided to make this again and used Ranch Dressing instead of the Italian.  I didn't even notice that I skipped the sour cream and cilantro.  I used Jalapeno cream cheese for a little kick and it was delicious.  Next time I will remember the cilantro.  So quick and easy.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. The only thing I messed up on was covering the pit while it was eating because it added access amount of water. Other than that it was great!
