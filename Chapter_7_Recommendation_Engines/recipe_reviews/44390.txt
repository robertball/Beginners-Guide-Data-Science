In Peru, they usually don't put mustard. Usually it's either with just the mayonnaise, or with lime juice & salt. It's called "Ensalada Rusa" which translates to  "russian salad". Usually the people there add other vegetables to this salad, such as cut-up string beans(boiled), and peas or corn.

Nice - like a fancy potato salad - goes well with burgers or chicken. I washed, peeled and chunked the pieces ahead of time lowering the cooking time a little bit (15 min for beets, add potatoes 10 min, add carrots 10 min). Made a nice salad plus I saved the broth for veggie soup.

A good combination, but a little bland for my taste.  I added some chopped chives; also needed a bit of salt at the table.  But otherwise, a nice dish.  I peeled and chunked veggies before cooking and pressure cooked them to save time.  I put them in a steamer basket with about a cup of water in my pressure cooker.  Just 1-2 minutes at pressure, then release pressure immediately.  The beets should be cut into the smallest chunks and the potatoes in the largest chunks for everything to finish cooking at the same time.

I, too, had only had the salad bar version of beets.  This was great!  I used a sweet potato instead of a regular potato, and cut the veggies in chunks to reduce the boiling time.  It's definitely a keeper.

As with other reviewers, I chopped up the veggies before cooking them.  In order to "sell" my husband on a salad that contains beets I boiled the beets separately so the red color wouldn't bleed onto the rest of the vegetables in the cooking process.  I cooked the beets for 30 mins and the carrots and potatoes for 20.

Hi ladies! Thank you for the positive feedback and suggestions! The only reason why I don't chop or peel before hand is because I found the peels retain more of the vegetables flavor. I've done it both ways and just prefer doing it the longer way. I do add salt and a lil more mayo than posted on here. Also a lil salt goes a long way here!! Sorry for forgetting that one important ingredient!!

I've been looking for this recipe for so long! I tried it as a kid at a friends house. And, yes I was just being polite and trying it, but boy was I surprised that beets could be that good. I never liked them before. Thanks for sharing!

What a different way to use these vegetables! And very tasty. I added a couple of boiled eggs, used dijon mustard and thought it was an awesome dish.

I made this because I received beets in my organic produce box. This recipe was really yummy- a lot like potato salad with carrots and beets. Beets are definitely an acquired taste- I still do not like them too much.

Great, colorful presentation. Okay flavor, somewhat lacking. I encourage anybody making this dish to add their own pizazz to it.

Reminds me of Peru ... I found it was too much mustard so I'll use less than half next time, and I added salt, but otherwise was great.

This is so yummy. My husband does not like mayo or beets and turned his nose up at it until he tried it. He actually liked it. I love this dish and it is easy to make. I used dijon mustard instead of plain yellow and fresh ground black pepper.

MMMM!  Ensalada de Rus!!! My suegra taught me how to make this too!  The mustard gives it a little zing and the beets are so sweet.  It's like a jazzed up Potato Salad.  My family likes it with eggs too and green peas.

When I lived in the campo of Peru my host mom would make me huge bowls of this.  We usually had it with lime juice and salt and pepper instead of mustard and mayonese.  I didn't think I liked beets before I ate this salad, but they now have a special place in my heart!

This is oddly enough awesome!  I cheated - used steamed baby beets and steamed carrots from Trader Joes (fridge section).  Cooked purple pot. in microwave - thr. it in a bowl w/ mayo and mustard and had a meal in about 5 minutes!  Did need some salt and as others said hard boiled eggs would be good to.  Yipee for a bit of a healthier take on pot. salad!  Thanks!

If you add some chopped pickles and canned peas, it will be Russian salad, known as Vinegret. It's amazing, that these two dishes from the opposite sides of the world are so similar.

A great way to enjoy beets! I thought this was a little too bland and could have benefited from a zestier sauce. Next time I might do something with horseradish. Like other reviewers, I cut everything up beforehand and reduced cooking time. Saved the broth for tomorrow's soup stock.

Yours is good, but when in Peru it had peas and tuna in it, so it was a bit more bland your way.  Thanks for posting it, I had forgotten all about it!

Very tasty attractive salad. Good starch & vegetable combo. But cooking times do not match up to recommendations. Whole beets took about 1 3/4 hours to cook, while potatoes and carrots took about 20 min & 15 min, respectively

I do not like beets but I had a bunch from my CSA that I needed to use and found this recipe. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and chopped up all the produce before boiling. My salad was done in an hour and half. I still do not like beets but this salad was pretty good. I added two hardboiled eggs and chopped raw celery. My church picnic gobbled it all up.

This was fantastic; however, I recommend it be served hot.  My family like it best that way, and reheating it made it kind of gross. But, fresh and hot, it is simply delicious.

Didn't do the mustard but otherwise it was awesome! YUM.  i haven't really cooked with beets.  So per some research, someone said to boil the beets without having cut them.  Don't cut the root leave about one inch of stalk above the beat and boil like that, the skin comes off real easy when done.  I boiled the potatoes and carrots as she said but separate from the beets.  It is really delicious too bad it doesn't look so pretty. My salad was more pink:)

I made this with the vegetables roasted instead of boiled. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely be making it again.

Neither hated it nor loved it.  Boiled beets tossed with a little olive oil and salt is a lot less work and we like it a whole lot better.  Won't be making it again. :(
