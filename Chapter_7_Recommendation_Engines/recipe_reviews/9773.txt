I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  Although a very tastey cookie, I could not taste the maple at all.  The recipe mixed up well and baked beautifully.  I rolled them in a white sugar/maple sugar mix.  I'm the baker at a local Farmer's Market so thought I would bake these for maple season.  I let a co-worker taste one and she could not tell me what type of cookie it was, even with the maple sugar on top.  It makes a delicious brown sugar cookie - but not maple.  Today I did make another batch and added 2 tsps. of maple extract as well and omitted the vanilla.  Tomorrow when I go back into work I'll see if it's better with the addition of the extract (they weren't baked off yet when I left today).  The recipe does have promise!  Followup:  So now I've tasted the cookie with the maple extract and it is a beautiful cookie!  The extract absolutely makes all the difference.  I will make these cookies again but only with the addition of the maple extract.

These cookies needed something so I put on a maple glaze.  They turned out better this way.  I used 2 cups powdered sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar,  1/4 cup maple syrup and just enough milk to make it spredable.  YUMMY

These were very good and not too sweet as some maple cookies can be. The maple flavor was subtle, so if you want a more pronounced maple flavor add 1/2 tsp. maple extract.

I made this for the first time for my daughter's school project.  She was researching the state of New Hampshire and found that maple syrup was one of their state's products.  She had to provide a 'taste' of this for 150 students and teachers.  I loved the idea of the 'maple glaze'(from another reviewer on the site) to "finish" off the presentation of the cookie. We actually liked the cookies, as a family, with or without the glaze.  It was an incredible "hit" with EVERYONE (all asked for second helpings!) and a teacher asked me for the recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe a 'regular' in our family's list of favorite cookies! Thanks Craig!!!!

This cookie is a nice change from others, as it is not too sweet.  I did, however, heed other reviewer's advice and add 2 t. of maple flavor to the dough AND made a glaze of powdered sugar/maple flavoring.

These cookies are fantastic- chewy and soft.  They are good with or without icing.  We made half with and half without.  We used a simple icing of about 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons maple syrup and enough water to make it spreadable.

Wonderful recipe! I baked them for 10 minutes so they were soft and chewy. Rolled them in natural sugar crystals instead of granulated suger - it gave them a little extra sparkle and crunch. This is a keeper - thank you!

I altered the recipe a little the 2nd time I made these, with even better results than the original: I substituted some of the butter with shortening (1/3 c butter 2/3 c shortening) to prevent too much flattening / spreading. Instead of vanilla I used maple extract (I think I'll try doubling the map,e ext next time), I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients and chilled the very sticky dough to make it easier to roll into balls. I also drizzled maple frosting over the cooled cookies (2 c powder sugar, 2 Tbsp butter, 2 Tbsp milk, 1 tsp maple ext.) - went easy on the icing so it wasn't too overpowering. I think this is one of my favorite cookies!! :)

these were quite delicious. Because some of the other reviewers remarked they were similar to sugar cookies, i added a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg, like i do to most of my sugar cookie recipes, and the flavor was great. Crisp on the outside, and chewy in the middle. Mmmm.

A good cookie, I wouldn't say a great cookie.  I have made Ultimate Maple Snickerdoodles on this site and prefer that recipe.  Perhaps I should have purchased Grade B Maple Syrup as that is supposed to give a stronger maple flavor, but I used the Grade A for the other recipe and didn't have to use quite as much as this recipe.  Maple syrup is so expensive it is better to get a better tasting cookie using a smaller amount.  I also added some cinnamon to the sugar that I rolled the dough in prior to cooking.

These is a very decent cookie recipe. Like a soft sugar cookie with a hint of maple flavor. What the recipe doesn't specify, and it should, is to use grade B maple syrup, which is different than the grade of the typical maple syrup you'll find on the grocery shelf for pancakes. Grade B is darker and stronger in flavor, and is used specifically in cooking and baking. That is what I used in this recipe, and it yielded just the right amount of wonderful maple flavor, the flavor that other reviewers complained was lacking. You then do not need to replace the vanilla extract with maple extract, as some did. I also added in some maple chips, which can be hard to find, but if you do, you're lucky. I just like a little something extra in my cookies, but these certainly don't need it.

The kids decided that REAL maple syrup wasn't their bag, so I decided to use it up this way.  Cookies deserve 3.5 stars.  They're (like everyone's said) not very sweet, and just a super subtle maple flavor (Didn't have maple flavoring).  I did add walnuts to the last half of the dough and I thought they were better with them.

OUTSTANDING.  Prepared them exactly as written.  Use REAL maple syrup, i.e. not Log Cabin or the sort.  They were so light and fluffy.  Also, don't believe the others who thought they weren't sweet enough.  They are just right in sweetness.  Again, OUTSTANDING!

These are simply wonderful.  I used Grade B real maple syrup for a more robust maple flavor and omitted the vanilla.  Added a handful of chopped walnuts because we like maple and walnut together.  Rolled the cookies in a mix of maple sugar and granulated sugar.   A new favorite at our house!

This is going to sound absolutely ridiculous, but I actually didn't make these with maple syrup (even though I'm Canadian and love maple syrup).  I used honey with fantastic results (maple sryup and honey are easily interchangeable in recipes, especially baking).  I halved the recipe but used the full egg, and other than replacing the syrup with honey that was the only change I made.  The dough was soft but easy to roll, not too sticky at all. They turned out soft and cakey (which I love) with a mild taste to them.  They are a plain cookie, but (in the words of my favourite chef, Nigella) they are gloriously plain.  Perfect for tea or coffee.  This is my new favourite recipe for cookies, and will be going into the new recipe collection I'm putting together, which will hold only my absolute favourite recipes.  Thank you so, so much!

I neeeded to make 3 dozen cookies for an event and I was looking for something easy but good to please a crowd. This is a great and easy recipe. I drizzled maple glaze drizzle on the cookies for the added maple favor ( just icing sugar and maple sirop) These were yummy, easy and made 5 dozen! Will be keeping this recipe on hand :)

These came out great.   I rolled them in maple sugar (good luck finding it if you don't live near sugar bushes).  All we had was light amber syrup, so the flavor was subtle.  A medium amber syrup might give stronger flavor.

Everyone loved these cookies.  All I did different was add a pecan to the top of each cookie before baking.  Maple and pecans are an awesome combo.

Great Cookie!  Very soft cookie.  Terrific and easy recipe.  Tastes very similar to a sugar cookie, except it has that little kick of maple.  The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I didn't grease the baking sheet.  It isn't necessary.  I made these for my students while completing a unit of study on Canada.  All the students LOVED them and were practically begging for more.  My son and husband also enjoyed them.

I thought these cookies turned out pretty tasty. They baked into perfect circles that looked hand cut. They weren't overly sweet or maple-y, but I would definitely recommend them. Perfect for events because they're oh-so-pretty!

Not sure what to say about these.
I made them as directed. 
I taste baking soda. 
I rolled them in mixed maple sugar/cane sugar. Zero maple flavor.
I will do a drizzle of maple syrup glaze to see if that helps.

Delicious.  Made just as recipe said.  Great right out of the oven and expect them to be better tomorrow when the maple flavor intensifies.  Remember, it is a short dough, so handle lightly.

I really like this cookie. It's very easy to make, soft, chewy, and has a nice flavor. The maple flavor is subtle, but it's hard for me to get maple extract, so the original recipe by itself is fine.

5 star with the additional maple flavouring (definitely a must!). I used the full cup of maple syrup + 2 tsp. extract, and they are delicious. I'm so excited to take them to a cookie exchange tomorrow. Oh, and I also combined a little bit of the maple syrup with the sugar I used for rolling them in. Yum!

I came across this recipe in search of a cookie I had never made before. Although somewhat atypical, these maple cookies are traditional enough to be guaranteed a warm reception. I had some extra after stuffing my family, so I took them over to the senior center where they were appreciated all around.   I followed the advice of previous reviewers, however and 1) reduced the vanilla by half and 2) glazed them with a maple glaze. The glaze I made consisted of maple syrup and confectioners sugar in a 1:3 ratio, but it's really to taste.   All together a splendid cookie, with a wonderful subtle maple flavor. Will make again.

These were very good. I added them to the long list of cookies we bake over the holidays as maple just says... "FAMILY". I did wish the maple flavor was stronger but I loved the chewiness of the cookie and they were so simple to make with my daughter.  Any cookie that you can just roll into balls and bake have my vote. Super Easy & Yummy!

These cookies are amazing! I found them because I had some leftover maple sugar to use up and wasn't sure what to do with it. I'm glad I did. I almost didn't make them because of the reviews saying there wasn't enough flavor, or that these cookies needed something extra. But I'm glad I did. It's true the maple flavor is subtle (almost an aftertaste), and I think adding maple extra would add the flavor some reviewers felt was missing. However, as is, these are delicious, soft centered, slightly crispy edged tiny little round disks of heaven.  I halved the recipe and used 1/4 cup maple sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar instead of dark brown, because I thought light brown would be less likely to mask the maple flavor, and I rolled them in maple sugar at the end. Maybe my favorite cookies ever.

Following the advice of other reviewers I omitted the vanilla and opted for maple extract.  Even after using 1 1/2 tsp of the extract I found it light on flavour.  I might make up the glaze that was suggested today and see how I like that.  This recipe does produce light, uniform cookies.

These cookies were the best.  They're so full of subtle yet wonderful flavors.  I used half grade A dark amber syrup and half grade A light amber, but only because I ran out of the dark amber.  The darker the syrup you use, the more of that maple flavor it'll have.  Also, I made a small batch the night before and realized it wasn't as maple-y as I would have liked, so when I made a larger batch, I replaced the vanilla with maple flavoring.  Everyone loved them!

I used Griffin's pancake syrup and they came out just great!  But if you have real maple syrup, it would probably really do wonders for the taste!  These are soo good I'm addicted now!

I used our homemade maple syrup to make these soft and chewy cookies.  I only added 1 tsp vanilla and I dropped them on the pan with my cookies scoop, and then pressed them with a sugared glass.  With 1/3 cup syrup and 1 cup pwd sugar, I made a glaze that I drizzled on top of each cookie while on the cooling rack.  They have a mild maple flavor that is not too overpowering.  For a bolder flavor, I would use maple extract in place of the vanilla or a combination of both.

These are the best cookies! The Texture is so perfect. I used 100% maple syrup from costco and it had such a great maple flavor. They are buttery, rich and plenty sweet! I think Vanilla/maple syrup quality if crucial. Also it is important to roll them in the sugar because it really makes the difference to enhance flavor and texture.

These cookies are amazing! I just made them for our superbowl party tomorrow--and just had to eat one! I did use maple extract instead of vanilla, and used Butter Pecan Maple Syrup instead of regular---and I did do the glaze from one of the previous reviewers. They are awesome! Great cookie.

This is hands down the best cookie I had made thus far.  I added maple imitation instead of maple extract, I had no maple extract and they turned out amazing.  I scooped them out by a cookie scoop but didnt press them down at all and rolled them into 1/3 cup of sugar and a random ammount of red and green sprinkles to make a nice color for the season.  To get a cooked cookie I had to cook them to 16 minutes, probably because mine were thicker but they turned out very soft and chewy. Amazing cookie

Yummy! It wasn't as Maple tasteing as I thought it would be. The dough was gooey. I thought I did something wrong but it ended up being fine. I put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes and that helped. Will definately make this again.

I accidentally ate 4 of the big ones for breakfast... They are so SOFT! Oh they are so good with tea! I love these, and so did the parents at school, there were many requests for the recipe.  We only have dark brown sugar, which worked great. I made them again, and only had 3/4 C. maple syrup, you definitely need a full cup, do not skimp on the syrup! And they stayed in the oven a bit too long, so they weren't as soft as the first batch.

I was so excited to try this recipe! I only made half the recipe and I'm glad I did, those cookies aren't what I was looking for, I found them dull and tasteless, I did use dark maple syrup, maple essence instead of vanilla. I was going to try the glaze another reviewer posted in their comments, but I'm going to save that recipe for something else. I'm very sorry but I really did not enjoy the cookies at all (though the raw dough wasn't to bad!!!). I only baked half of the half recipe, and not sure what to do about the leftovers. Maybe chocolate chips will spruce them up!  I also found the dough hard to roll into balls, but that could be with the fact that it might have needed a wee bit more of this or that (my measuring cups are based on 250 ml and I don't do well with metric conversions in grams) but I did roll the dough (I love doing that anyway whenever I can) and it was easy to cut, the cookies also did keep their shape. So it's not an awful recipe, we simply didn't like it.

I made these for Canada Day, and they were a big hit.  They were easy to make so I will probably make them again next year.  Thanks.

This is a very good recipe.  I found the dough to be very soft and just a little difficult to roll into balls, but the result was delicious.  I also topped these with a walnut half which is exactly what they needed.  Serve for dessert with maple walnut ice cream and a nice hot cup of coffee.  Delicious after a big dinner featuring pork.

These cookies have no maple flavor to speak of. They're very good plain sugar cookies, but certainly not "maple" flavored. Also, I really don't appreciate all the reviewers who give online recipes 4-5 stars, but then talk about all the changes they made to the base recipe in order to make it better. Instead, rate the actual recipe as it's written and then talk about the changes you made in your review. It's very misleading for people looking for recipes to see a high star count if the actual recipe isn't any good unless you make changes as described in the reviews.

Very good. I made these in cute little tree shapes for a Christmas party. I added a glaze made with powdered sugar, butter, and maple extract and sprinkled pecans and bacon crumbles on top with a pinch of sea salt. They were a big hit!

These cookies are an excellent example of confection at its finest. Even though the maple flavor was subtle, the cookies were delicious. I did however bake the cookies for 14-15 minutes instead of the time on the original recipe so they were baked all the way through. No salmonella please. All in a great harvest time treat.

These are delicious cookies, but the maple flavor is a bit subtle, so I rolled the second half of the batch in maple sugar instead of regular sugar, and that made all the difference.

The good: easy to make, good texture. Good base cookie recipe
The bad: hardly tasted the maple. I can't find maple extract where i live so had to do without.

I plan on making these cookies and started reading up on types of maple syrup - for baking you need Maple Syrup Grade "B", which is difficult to find - but I finally checked the health food stores in town and found some. Make sure you use the Grade B. The grades are marked on the front of the bottles - pancake syrup is usually Grade A.

These were great.  Made just like the recipe called.  I did add a maple drizzle on top but they didn't need it.   I liked them either way.  Kids loved them.  Will make again.  Thanks!

the dough tastes delicious! ;) but once the cookie has been baked, it doesn't takes like maple at all. suggestion: instead of vanilla extract, use maple. this increases the maple-ness of the cookie. 
the texture is incredible though! very very soft and chewy! still tastes great without the maple flavor. but disappointing when expecting a maple flavored cookie

Just made these this morning and they are a very yummy little cookie! the perfect texture and crispness to the edges. The reason I am not rating them higher is that as other reviewers have said they aren't very mapley, next time I will add some extract as well.

I gave it 5 stars for effort and for an excellent base maple cookie!  I myself have never made maple cookies before.  I did use another members suggestion (2 tsps of maple extract) I however next time might even use 2.5 or even 3 tsps to really bring out a more distinct maple flavor. 

Thanks very much for posting.

These are awesome. I do agree with a few other reviews that it needs maple extract. Add a little of that and you have some delicious maple cookies. They are soft and I used large crystal sugar to roll them in which gives them a little crunch. They were a big hit, and one of my new favorite cookies.

Listen to the reviews people! Maple syrup is expensive and it can't be tasted at all. I had no maple extract; tried the frosting's posted but even that wasn't enough. These cookies are bland. Maple cookies that taste like maple can be bought at 1/3 of  the price it took to bake these.

I was looking for an easy Canadian recipe to serve to my first grade students as we embarked the plane for our Canada unit.  Wow, these were so simple to make and I didn't even have real maple syrup on hand-I used lite maple syrup and didn't bother to sift the flour.  They turned out great!  I sprinkled red sugar on top and they were perfect.  One student told me he had a new second favorite cookie!  Thanks!

I read the reviews first and was concerned they wouldn't be mapley enough, so I added about 1/2 cup of organic maple flakes and omitted the vanilla extract. I think they're absolutely fine this way and would consider adding chopped walnuts or pecans next time. For anyone worried about a lack of maple flavour, make sure you are using a good quality REAL maple syrup. I used Canadian No.1 Light, but I'm sure it would also work with medium. No need for artificial flavours or essences!

The cookies were very delicious. They were almost the best cookies I've ever eaten! There is just a good touch of maple syrup. I don't really like pure maple syrup that much but the maple syrup in the cookies was not to sweet which made me love the cookies. I would to totally rate the cookies 5 stars!

I made these as the recipe suggested.  I love the texture of these cookies.  Nice and soft on the inside with a crispy outside.  I do wish, however that they had a bit more "maple" flavour.  I don't like using extracts since they have a "fake" flavour, but overall these are very good.  If hubby loves them, I'll make them again :).

These are delicious! To add a more maple-y flavor, I just added a teaspoon of maple extract.

mmmm, mmmm, good!!!
These truly are fantastic cookies!! Perfect amount of maple flavor, sweet but not too sweet... awesome!
For presentation, however, I drizzled a bit of powdered sugar glaze over the cookies.
For those saying not enough maple flavor... are you using REAL maple syrup?? Gotta make sure it's not the "Mrs. Butterworth" type syrup. These are not those maple cookies you buy at the stores but a more subtle maple flavor.
Will definitely make these more often!!

I thought these were very good but I took off 1 star because I think they type of syrup you use makes a difference. We had bought a new kind of maple syrup that was almost watery so I decided to make maple cookies to get that syrup out of my house. While they did make a lovely maple cookie, the cookie was very soft, even after "over baking" it for me. I think I could've burnt them and they would still be too soft. I suggest using a syrup that is thicker in consistency.

Just made these this morning. The cookies taste like butter cookies, cannot taste the maple. I should have followed others suggestions to add maple extract. I will try this one again with that change.

Wonderful recipe! As others have mentioned, using the syrup only results in a milder maple flavor. I used dark brown sugar and medium amber maple syrup (fancy/light should never be used for baking!) and have a lovely flavor. If I want a stronger maple flavor next time - I will definitely use the extract. A simple icing of syrup and confectioners sugar is great drizzled on top.

These are a very tasty cookie.  I only had Grade A maple syrup so they did not have really any maple flavor to speak of, but they were still good.  I used Crisco margerine instead of butter and added a 1/2 cup of sliced almonds.  I did not grease the cookie sheet and they came right off after I let them rest on the pan for 5 mins after baking and before removing to a wire rack to cool.  Will definitely make these again trying it with Grade B syrup and/or any other maple flavoring items I can find like maple sugar or maple extract or maple chips.

As the reviews say, surprisingly not a very sweet cookie. Tempted to add a dash more salt for a more interesting contrast with the sweetness of the brown sugar and maple syrup. All in all a good cookie and one that is nice to have around.

These cookies are good, and I will make them again. They are very good as far as a basic cookie goes; nicely crisp on the outside and satisfyingly chewy on the inside.  I was hoping for more maple flavor though. Replaced the vanilla extract with maple extract and the flavor was still very subtle. I added in butterscotch chips for fun and that upped the interest a bit. My kids really liked them a lot, so thanks for providing the recipe!

This cookie is quite good! It mixed up well, rolled well, and baked well. A past reviewer recommended adding 2 tsp maple extract. I added 1 tsp and I am so glad I did because even with the maple syrup and 1 tsp maple extract, it's still a mild flavour. I will definitely make these cookies again, but I will use the full 2 tsp maple extract. I also have VE Canadian Maple Chips (like chocolate chips) and I think I will try throwing some of those in too to see what the result would be.

Made these with my girls for a cookie exchange.  It was our first time making cookies from scratch. This recipe was very easy to put together.  The cookies came out a nice golden brown and they taste just like buttermilk pancakes with syrup. Next time I might try making ice cream sandwiches with them.  They'd go great with vanilla ice cream.

Awesome! Loved these! I took a commentor's advice and subbed maple extract for the vanilla to make it just that much more maple-y, and it was great. Brought these to work after the fam had their fill of them and they were gone very fast!

These are very good.  I only put in half the brown sugar because we really don't like cookies that are sweet sweet sweet.  I also put in a teaspoon of cinnamon for a little extra flavour.

I was "assigned" to bake these cookies for my daughter's cookie exchange at school.  So last night I got out my mixer and baked away.  Imagine my horror when the cookies came out soft and almost raw in the center!  I was appalled, because I had to cook THIS cookie.  So today I went and talked to a co-worker.  He used to be a pastry chef at the Four Seasons in NY.  Anyhow this was his advice:  1st use a wooden spoon to mix the cookies.  Sometimes a beater mixes everything too fast and too well.  His first apprenticeship was with a Danish cook who swore by this technique.  His second suggestion, when I described how soft and gooey the cookie dough appeared, was to cook down the maple syrup a little bit.   

So tonight with a new $7 jar of maple syrup,(and a couple of Pillsbury Sugar cookie doughs and some imitation maple flavoring,which was my co-workers THIRD suggestion--just in case)I tried the recipe again.  I cooked down the maple syrup just a bit--it was just under 1 cup after cooking it down.  Then I put it in the refrigerator to cool down.  I used a WOODEN spoon to do everything including creaming the butter and the brown sugar together.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of flour to the mix.  My dough was still soft, but not as gooey as the night before last.  

Then I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.  Even if the cookies are getting brown around the edges, they are not done.  You know when these cookies are done when they start to "buckle" on top.

I'm going with other ratings...Could not taste the maple. I kinda feel like it's a waste of expensive maple syrup. If I make these cookies again, I'm definitely going to try using the 2 t maple flavoring and maybe adding some chopped walnuts. Sorry. It sounded really good...

Contrary to other reviewers my cookies turned out more crunchy, less chewy.  No problem though as they're still tasty!  Like others have already stated, they were also not too maple-y, but a subtle flavour comes through nonetheless.  These went over great at work, but I think the guys I work with would be pleased with just about anything!

I thought these cookies were very tasty, but not very "maple."  They have a soft, chewy texture and a very good flavor.  Not too sweet, but very rich. I found one cookie satisfied my nightly sweets craving, which was nice.  I used Grade A Medium Amber syrup, so that might explain the lack of strong maple flavor. I will make these again, but I might try adding some maple extract as others have suggested.

This is an excellent cookie recipe that I will definitely be making again. It isn't that maple-y though (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5), and I would follow the recommendations to add some cinnamon and nutmeg, which I forgot and hence neglected. Still, the cookie was delicious. I had a small bit of maple syrup remaining, so I mixed it with powdered sugar and drizzled it over the cookies.

This recipe is fantastic. I think that maybe the people who said the dough is too "cakey" just weren't expecting a maple sugar cookie.

I added 1 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of cinnamon and they tasted fantabulous!

The dough is impossible to handle and "shape into 1 inch balls".  I added ingredients as instructed and the end result was a thick batter more than a dough.  I spooned the batter onto the cookie sheet inches apart.  It spread out into a thin pancake with crisp edges...

My entire family LOVED these cookies.  I baked them until golden brown so that they were crispy on the bottom and moist and chewy inside.  Soooo good!

WONDERFUL cookies!!! Yum, yum, yum! Just a hint of maple flavour...definitely not overpowering. The first batch I undercooked like I do with my chocolate chip cookies, but I didn't care for these chewy! The next batch we left in for almost 16 minutes...they were crispy and delicious! You have got to try this recipe!

I made these cookies for my class, and since there were so many, I passed some around to other school friends as well. After school, I was mobbed by hugs! It was unbelievable. I found out later that my teacher doesn't like maple syrup, but she adored these (she had 5 without thinking!). The dough was soft, but rolled fairly easily once covered in the sugar. I cooked mine a bit longer, too, until golden. This made them a little crunchier, but just as tasty and more travel-proof. I'm sure they are delicious when chewier, as well. Thank you for sharing!

Makes quick, easy, and cute cookies. They taste great too. My mom thought the maple flavouring was a bit too subtle at first, but the taste improved with time. A few days after baking, my dad was just inhaling them.

Hi Craig. This is the best maple cookie. My family and I are from maple country aka Canada. Although we reside in the states our love for maple has never gone away. I made these last year and am making several batches this year. Thank you so much. Robin

Not my favorite. I couldn’t taste the maple either. What I tasted was the flour, maybe too much being asked? The chewy ones are better.

Such a disapointing cookie. Made these cookies with real butter and real maple syrup to discover they are a glorified sugar cookie. The maple syrup is overshadowed by the brown sugar in the  recipe. Was most upset with wasting a cup of our own syrup on a sub par cookie

I love these cookies! Making them for the third time right now (in a less than a month!). 
I like to use coarse Himalayan pink salt and I double it to make them sea salt maple brown sugar cookies and they’re just so delicious!! I highly recommend using coarse sea salt and doubling it. They’re so addictive. I probably eat a dozen a day.

I tried another recipe for maple cookies and it called for shortening instead of butter. This recipe was much better! I added walnuts and this cookie turned out chewy and delicious!

Changes: used vegetable shortening instead of butter (I was out of butter and needed to use up the shortening); dusted with icing sugar after they were baked rather than rolling in granulated sugar. They came together very easily and baked beautifully, but as others have said, they're very much lacking in maple flavour. They sure *smelled* like delicious maple cookies while baking, and while they are good, I'm giving this recipe one star because they just taste like plain brown sugar cookies, not even a hint of maple. Unfortunately I forgot to read the reviews before making them or I would have waited to try these until I went out and got some maple extract. Even with maple extract, I don't think I'll make these again - I just can't see anything making them good enough to justify using a whole cup of maple syrup. I suspect I'd get the maple flavour just adding maple extract to a regular brown sugar cookie recipe.

Absolutely delicious! We couldn’t stop eating them! I used a maple glaze receptor that someone posted and we ended up running out with about 5-6 cookies to spare, but we did put a lot on. 20/10 would recommend.

I thought they were very good, and I'm planning on making them again. Although, they taste more like sugar cookies because you can't really taste the maple syrup. :)

My daughters love these. We added about a tablespoon of " Mapleine" maple flavor and 1 tsp vanilla. We flattened them with a spoon. When they were cooled, we melted some chocolate and drizzled it over them. These are a regular cookie on our Christmas cookie platters. Thank you!

Oh!  How I wanted to love these cookies!  The batter smelled wonderful, the cookies smelled great when they were baking and the flavor was flat, even with all that maple syrup and adding maple extract instead of vanilla.  I think I may try to salvage them by making a maple glaze with confectioners sugar, maple syrup and a shot or two of Crown Royal!  It is the only thing I can think of to salvage them.  The batter was absolutely velvety when mixing it together, I was so optimistic.  Perhaps I will add some sugared walnuts to the glaze, as well.  That being said the texture and chew of the cookie was perfect.

I added 2 tsp maple extract. Very nice cookie. I used a 1oz scoop instead of rolling them (I also did not roll them in sugar since I will be making a maple glaze for them.) It yeilds about 45 this way.

I'm rating the cookie as is, rather than with the suggested modifications (which I read too late).  The maple flavor is very subtle, and definitely overpowered by the cookie itself.  Next time, I'll add the maple extract, as well as try the glaze.

These cookies need something.  Last time I put chocolate chips in them and they were good that way.  They remind me of snickerdoodles without the cinnamon.  This time I'm going to put cinnamon and nutmeg in and they should be great.

I had to tweak it a little because I can't use brown sugar. I omitted the brown sugar, used a little less butter, and almond flavoring. The pure Grade B maple syrup I used gave it all the sweetness they needed. WOW....ended up with a light textured, maple blast, delicious cookie. Browned beautifully, and cooked through. Will make again. The maple glaze mentioned would be a great addition for someone looking for gooey sweet.

I was very disappointed that I couldn't taste any maple flavour in this cookie.  It tasted like a greasy sugar cookie - no vanilla or butter flavour, just tasteless.  I won't make these again.

As most people have stated, the maple flavor is very subtle.  I placed a pecan half on the top of each cookie before I pressed it down.  I thought it added a nice touch to the cookie.

This recipe was a good beginning... I tweaked it by I adding a whole bag of milk chocolate chips (270g) and a whole pack (500g) of maple bacon (bake in the oven 20 minutes at 400F, and crumpled up). Also used maple extract instead of vanilla. Oh and didn't use any sugar for decoration.  Suggestion: making smaller balls and minimizing cook time will make for a lighter (less dense) cookie that will probably more satisfying than a bigger, harder cookie.

I halved the recipe and stayed with one egg.  I used a cookie scoop to put them on the cookie sheet and then sprinkled decoration sugar on top and then pressed them down slightly.  They came out perfect and taste awesome!

I made this without planning ahead, so I made do with what was in my pantry. As it turns out, I wished I had had maple extract available. As others have mentioned, these cookies don't turn out quite maple-y enough and would have benefited from a 1/2 tsp maple extract. Also, once I tasted the batter, it was screaming to me, "Please, add some chopped walnuts to me!" So glad I did that. Plus, since I didn't have the extract, I finished the cookies with a little maple glaze. If you were to make this recipe exactly as written it would turn out a bit fluffy, somewhat cake-like, not too sweet, with just the barest hint of maple. I will definitely make again with these same modifications.

I used grade a maple syrup because that's what my family buys so the cookies didn't have much of a maple taste.
I also forgot to flatten them but they turned out nice.
I also made the glaze and drizzelled it over the cookies.

Next time I make these I will cut it in half for less cookies if it's just going to be my family of 3 eating them, I will use grade b maple syrup, and I will exclude the glaze if I use grade b maple syrup because the extra sweetness isn't necessary if it tastes all mapley delicious. :)

Very good cookie! I had no problem with mine turning out like a cakey snickerdoodle with subtle maple flavor. I did take some reviewers tips though. 1st I used 1/3 c butter and 2/3 cup crisco shortening. I also used 2 tsp of Maple Extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I could have used 3 tsp of maple and I will next time. I only had Grade A syrup but I did have the dark amber kind. However, if you have a Sprouts near you, they carry the Grade B and I will try that next time.  I dont think I needed the extra flour. 
I also used a maple glaze which really helped with the maple flavor.. it was 2 C Powdered sugar, 2 tbsp butter, 2 tbps milk, and 1 tsp Maple extract (although you could bump that up to 1 1/2 or even 2) depending on the intensity you like. I really did like this recipe! It turned out as I wanted it to with pillowy soft cakey cookies that I  am using for bake sale! I "audited" a couple and they are very good!  Oh and I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and reduced the baking soda by 1/2 tsp.

These cookies are absolutely delicious and their texture is perfect every time.  I add 1 tsp of maple extract to the recipe and do not roll the cookies in sugar, otherwise I leave it as is.  I have tried rolling them in maple sugar flakes but they don't turn out quite the way they should.  I only bake one cookie sheet at a time (12 cookies), turning it halfway.  My gas oven bakes these to perfection at the 9 minute mark.  I use a Silpat and a cookie scoop to ensure perfect portions and even baking every time. I flatten the cookie dough ball once I've dropped a scoop onto the Silpat.  Follow my method and you'll have perfect cookies every time.

Nice soft chewy cookie.  Very mild maple flavor, more of a sugar cookie. I added a nice maple glaze on top and wow, that really upped the flavor.  Overall, a good recipe.

Really yummy.  Yes, the maple is subtle, but it's still delicious.  I cut the sugar in half and it was still plenty.  Used whole wheat instead of white flour and they were still soft and good!

This makes a DELICIOUS sugar cookie!  Really don't taste the maple.  I've been making this for a least eight holiday seasons and it never disappoints.  I find they are undercooked unless in the oven for the full 10 minutes.  VERY soft and chewy.  I give out the recipe a least once a season.  Thank you!

The first time I made these I accidently left out the baking soda (blond moment:)they spread out and ran together.  I was going to throw them away , but my boyfriend got hold of them and thought they were great! I went to my Co-op and bought my syrup from the bulk bin, that way I only had to buy what I needed.

I read many of the reviews before making.  I decided to halve the recipe and make it exactly as presented before changing the recipe.  The recipe as presented results in a chewy, mild-maple cookie that is not extremely sweet.  The syrup is used primarily as a sweetner.  I will make this cookie again but i will follow others' suggestion to add maple extract as well, for a bolder maple flavor.  This cookie reminds me of other mild cookies like shortbreads and some of the less sweet sugar cookies.

Delicious. I replaced the vanilla extract with maple extract and rolled the cookies in turbinado sugar. It doesn't have that real Quebec Maple taste but they are very good.

This recipe is wonderful!  The cookies are sweet without being too sweet, and the maple flavor is there without hitting you over the head (I make them as is without any alterations).  My mom, who doesn't usually care for anything maple-flavored, absolutely loves these.  Yum!

I like this recipe; it has a lot more maple flavor than others that I've tried.  However, my dough came out very sticky and it took nearly twice as long to bake.  I'm thinking to try them with Grade B maple syrup for a stronger flavor, but using a bit less for a more workable dough.  I also sprinkled some maple sugar over top and that was tasty, too.

could be cakey, but the flavor is really good. so i added a little more flour, n extra 1/2 cup brown sugar (cause I like it sweet), refrigerated it, and rolled them into balls in cinnamon and sugar, and flattened before baking.... made very very yummy and pretty maple flavored snickerdoodles

Both my boyfriend and I agree these cookies arn't bad, but they arn't exceptional either. They are too cakey for my taste.The flavor is good and they will definetely be eaten but I think I wont be making them ever again, too many other better cookie recipes out there.

These cookies are great.  They are soft and chewy with a great texture and flavour.  I followed the recipe exactly and was super happy!

These turned out great!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  However, I ended up with about 110 cookies.  Perhaps mine were smaller.

I made this recipe several times.  Always delicious - Like a sugar cookie but softer and with more flavor.  My kids love them.

These cookies turned out nicely for me and the maple taste is just right...not too overwhelming.  I made the cookies a bit larger and increased cooking time to 15 minutes.  Everybody in the family enjoyed them.  Thanks!

The texture was great but I thought the flavour was lacking something, I'm just not sure what. We all still enjoyed them though. Thanks

I remember trying this recipe last year and loved the texture and flavor of this simple cookie.  I will definitely try it with the maple glaze today!  Thanks for the suggestion!

This is a sweet cookie but it has an excellent maple flavor. I made some of the cookies rolled in sugar and some without. The cookies without sugar on them we're not SOO sweet, but both ways were good. Thanks for this one, Craig.
