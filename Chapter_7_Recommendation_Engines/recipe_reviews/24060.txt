I have a similar recipe and use a jelly roll pan instead of 9x13 -- I like it much better as the layers aren't so thick and it serves a large crowd. Just decrease the cooking time of the crust a little. Also increase the milk to 4 cups use 12 oz Cool Whip over pudding layer and drizzle on a glaze of: 2 T butter melted with 1/3 cup chocolate chips add 1 C powdered sugar and 2 T hot water. Then top with chopped toasted pecans and serve chilled -- not frozen. My family loves this recipe!

Just came across this recipe and had to write a review. This is an old standby for us! It is often requested for gettogethers with friends and family. I make it with cheesecake flavored pudding - gives it that eclair taste. To avoid lumps in the cream cheese mixture be sure to beat your cream cheese alone until fluffy before adding the pudding. Our all-time favorite dessert!

This recipe has been a staple in our family for years... with two changes. I use a larger pan and cook the crust for much shorter and I've never used chocolate pudding always vanilla or french vanilla! To die for and ALWAYS a huge hit at any get together.

Fantastic dessert couldn't be simpler to make. I made this almost completely sugar free for my husband for Turkey Day as he is diabetic. I took a hint from someone else and used sugar-free cheesecake pudding. I thought the flavor needed a little punch so I added a few drops of vanilla and almond extracts. Topped it with Cool Whip Lite sugar-free and Lite Hershey's syrup. I also toasted some chopped pecans with a smidge of butter some Splenda Brown Sugar baking blend and some cinnamon. It was a huge success!!! Our fellow diners had no idea it was sugar-free. I'm also going to try is with SF coconut pudding and toasted almonds and toasted coconut on top.

I've tried outless cream puff recipes and this has to be the best! Everything came out absolutely perfectly and it was delicious. I tried a whipping cream filling instead of the creamcheese though.

I have made this many times. I usually use sugar free pudding light cream cheese and fat free whipped topping to reduce the calorie content. I have made it with several different pudding flavors all to rave reviews. I alternate toppings depending on the pudding flavor. I like the idea of baking it in a jelly roll pan. Definitely whip the cream cheese before adding the pudding.

Delish! Everyone LOVED this- was a nice light dessert! Instead of putting in a baking pan I used a cookie sheet put parchment paper over it and spread the 'crust' on it. Great!

This is my husband's fave! I add a little vanilla and sugar to the choux before adding the flour. I got this same recipe from somewhere else but have never tried to freeze it. I had better not or I'll be making it every weekend right? Leftovers are NOT good so make sure it is gone. Wonderful refreshing dessert.

Try this w/ coconut cream pudding and then sprinkle toasted coconut on top. I've made this many times and for some reason at times the crust is pourable and at times it's sticky and needs spreading. If eggs are large decrease to 3 because it can start tasting really 'eggy'.

I have been making this dessert for years now. I have never had it frozen but may try that sometime. Also I have made this with different flavors of pudding such as vanilla and french vanilla which are very good as well. Instead of the choc syrup I sprinkle shaved choc. on the finished product. Very yummy dessert. Thanks for a good post!!

I made this as written and then with some changes that made ALL the difference. Just 3 eggs works great and doesn't taste eggy...the chocolate sauce recommended by JMILLER4 is wonderful!! (& it's sooo easy) Tastes rich & packs a chocolate punch just like eclair chocolate!! Chocolate syrup tastes watered down in comparison. I spread the chocolate directly onto the puff & it helped protect the puff from getting soggy with the pudding. Lastly my husband prefers vanilla eclairs and I love the contrast that the rich chocolate has with french vanilla pudding. Thanks for all the helpful reviews....my hubby's favorite dessert!

Yummers! I used vanilla pudding and it was divine. The cream cheese with the pudding makes it rich and really irresistible!

This is delicious! I did the same as jmiller4 putting it in a jellyroll pan and made her chocolate glaze rather than using the standard chocolate syrup topping. Everyone loved it!

I have made cream Puffs for years here are to ways to wow the crowd. 1. make them as usual but when you place them on the cookie sheet for baking place them in a circle so when they grow they'll for a wreath carefully cut top off all together remove guts then line the bottom with hardening chocolate add Mousse or whip cream put top back on cover with hardening chocolate and fill a small bowl of fresh strawberries and place in the center of the wreath- they'll be amazed! I asure you I make this for the holidays for the grownups and if you want to take it one step further... 2. This one's for the kids. Every year for the holidays I make a Cream Puff Bar Make shells as usual but put them in a basket. then make in different bowls-several kinds of mousses' or ice cream fruit chocolate whipcream sprinkles- nuts whatever you want. set it up in a bar fashion and let the kids make their own cream puff. Evey year I am asked a thousand times if I am going to make "the Bar" and of course I always do I am the cool Aunt in my family:)

Very good! I did substitute vanilla pudding for the chocolate because that's the way I was raised eating it and I prefer it that way. Excellent recipe and very easy!

This turned out great - similar in texture to an eclair. The kids weren't thrilled but I would make it again for potluck or company.

Really tasty. All of it went at the pot luck. I did have a problem with getting the cream cheese to blend completely with the pudding. Next time I will beat the cream cheese first till smooth and then add the pudding and milk. Maybe it will blend better. You do need to make it the same day you eat it as the crust was starting to get soggy and I had made it in the morning for an evening event.

Great dessert but it doesn't "hold well" as a leftover. Very scrumptious - but make just what you need.
