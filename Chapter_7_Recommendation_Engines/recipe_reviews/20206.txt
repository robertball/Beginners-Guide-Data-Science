I substituted raspberries and frozen raspberry/cranberry concentrate due to the season.  My wife loved it and was very impressed.  A big hit for one Michigander transplant!

really good recipe.. my whole family enjoyed it.. I did add a little less ginger ale than the recipe calls for but we found the cherry flavour a bit strong (although enjoyable) so the recipe is probably spot on. delicious recipe.. will make many times over..

For a true Michigan treat, make sure you use VERNORS.  Soooo Good!! Also amazing with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, float style.

We used frozen Cherry/Apple because we couldn't find just cherry. 4 out of 6 people liked it. We stirred and stirred but a chunk was still left at the bottom and it looked kinda like fruit, or a piece of liver (yuk!)
