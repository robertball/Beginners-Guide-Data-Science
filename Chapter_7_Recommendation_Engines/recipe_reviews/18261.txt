I fixed this for a brunch and it was a hit!  I added about 1 1/2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I also used a bit more water cooking the grits to have the finished product more of a grits consistancy, rather than a casserole consistancy.  I used only 1 tbsp of hot sauce and that was just the perfect amount.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  It's a real keeper!

In answer to the question about making this dish ahead of time, yes, you can.  I made it the night before and cooked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, then refrigerated it.  The next morning I warmed it (covered with foil) for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees and it came out great.  I haven't tried freezing it. I have made this both with processed cheese and sharp cheddar.  I think you could use any hard cheese that suits your taste.

Very good.  I used cheddar rather than American cheese and didn't use the hot sauce.

Good side for breakfast or dinner. My husband grow up in the south and said these were the best grits he has ever had. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and used garlic salt instead of seasoning salt. Would not change beyond that.

Thank you for this recipe! My kind of comfort food. Followed it to a "T" except for these changes: Added 1 tsp of minced garlic, quick-cooking grits and used a block of Velveeta processed cheese. Left out the hot sauce and for me it was still perfect. But, would like to try it with the hot sauce, also.

Can this be mixed the day before and covered/set in the fridge?  maybe the liquid would get soaked in the grits and not work out for a next morning baking.  thoughts??  thanks.

I did not actually make this recipe (though it looks great and I plan to in the future!) but I wanted to address the review below mine.  It looks like you were expecting something very different- maybe something more like cornbread?  You wrote that the texture turned out very similar to cream of wheat.  That actually IS what the texture of grits should be like.  They aren't something you can pick up and eat with your hands.  It looks like the recipe turned out just fine for you, just you were expecting something different.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because it has an average of 4.5 stars right now and maybe my rating can kind of even out the 2 stars of the review below mine since it isn't the recipe's fault that the cook didn't know what to expect and they even said they thought the grits tasted great :o)

Took this to a family fish fry yesterday and the bowl was practically licked clean!  My father-in-law refuses to eat grits, but I convinced him to give this a try.  He went back for seconds.  I'll be making this many more times.  Thanks from one Carmen to another.

I'm not from the south and when I heard of this dish I expected these to turn out a lot like a buscuit or some type of bread you could hold and eat.  They had a great flavor but turned out like a cream of wheat with cheese with no ability to cut them at all.  I follewed the recipe 100%, not changing a thing.  I even cooked them for longer than the recipe asked and they still turned out mushy.    We served them like mashed potatoes because they just wouldnlt hold together.  What on earth did I do wrong?!  Or is this just how grits end up?  Again, they tasted fine, but I don't think I'll be making them again unless I can get them into something we can hold and eat.  I'm not one for mush.

Outstanding recipe!  I used quick-cook grits because that's all I had -- a heaping cup of quick-cook to 4 cups of water did the trick.  Put a pressed clove of garlic in the grits water for flavor, and used cheddar cheese an some fresh-grated parmesan for the cheeses.  I baked it longer than called for, and it came out sliceable but still a great soft texture.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome!  There is a big difference between whole grits and the quick or instant variety.  One of my favorite things to do with the leftovers is to slice it about  1/2" thick and fry it in a little bit of butter and have it for breakfast.

I couldn't find regular grits and had to use quick-5 minute ones.  I used 4 cups of water and it came out great.

This recipe tasted DELICIOUS. Creamy and rich and cheese-y. But, it was swimming in butter fat. I mean I took paper towel after paper towel and pressed it into the grease in the pan to sop up the grease. Even then it continued to ooze grease so my son-in-law tilted the pan on one end so that we could better drain the grits. Yes, I'll make this recipe again, but I'll definitely reduce the butter content.

I made this for a work brunch tomorrow & baked  for 30 mins. I'll finish heating thru before I leave for work in the morning.  I thought this photo would show the nice egg "puff" while baking.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used just one stick of unsalted butter and only 1 tsp. of Cholula and salt because the cheese is so salty.  My real grits were buggy so I had to rush out to shop and settled for Quaker quick grits, not instant.   A good tip is to "temper" the beaten eggs before adding so they don't cook and clump when adding to hot grits.   To temper, add several spoonsful of hot grits to the bowl of eggs and stir.  The eggs will stay nice and smooth and blend well in the hot grits.  Other than licking the scraper, I haven't tried them yet...but the scraper was delicious..tho the salt and fat content is troubling.  I agree with another reviewer that you can add or subtract ingrediens to suit your family's tastes.  NEXT DAY:  It took longer than 30 mins at 350 to reheat.   The dish was very rich and tasty but next time I'll add garlic and more hot sauce.

I thought these grits were excellent. I've made them twice. The first time I used american processed cheese and the second time I went spicy with pepper jack. Both time were good.

This is good.

I mix up the cheese a bit (Swiss, romano, etc.) to liven it up.  I also cut the water and replace it with light cream or half & half to make it richer.

You can do a lot of things to this recipe and it's still easy to make.

EVERYONE loved it!  Complimented over and over!!!

Used White, sharp Cheddar instead of American!
Used normal salt!
Used Unsalted butter (1-1/2 stick) instead of margarine.

Will definitely make over and over!!!:)

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, except I used sharp cheddar instead of the American cheese. It was good, and I will probably use it again, but next time I will leave out the seasoned salt and go with plain salt, and maybe add a little garlic.  The seasoned salt just gave it a really odd flavor.

My daughter served these at our 1st ever Ladies Brunch and they were the hit of the meal!  We're having our 2nd ever Ladies Brunch this weekend and guess what is on the menu again!

Omg amazing!! It's a simple yet delicious recipe and I subbed Cheddar for American cheese. Great for a snowy winter day like today! I made a portion of 4 and they fit in 2 corningware bowls that are used for French Onion Soup.

This recipe was great though I changed it slightly. Less margarine (I used butter) and less cheese though the full amount of cheese would probably be fine depending on your taste. Also I used cheddar. I also put a clove of garlic in the water before adding my grits and took out the clove once the grits had thickened. This added a nice flavor but I'm sure it would have been good without too. I made half the recipe and baked in a glass pie dish for 25 minutes. It was perfect. The next day we had the leftovers which I heated in the microwave and the overnight refrigeration firmed up the grits to where they could be easily sliced. Personally, I preferred them the first night when they were still softer.

My husband does not like grits.  I made it for 2 so I could try it, and he loved it and wanted more

The idea of Velveeta would make a very bland dish.  Instead, add smoked Gouda or a sharp cheddar with lots of garlic.  As a southerner,  this is a dish served often.  We so miss Kraft's garlic cheese .  So sorry they discontinued it as it was always the cheese used in cheese grits.

Tried it just as is in the recipe, and it was really good, but I like a little more zip in my cheese grits.  I think this recipe could be jazzed up a little with diced jalepanos.

This was actually quite yummy, but didn;t go over as well with my toddlers. So honestly, if you love grits, I'd give this 5 stars...I'm only rating 4 for my own use. :)  I used about half the cheese and it was still yummy

A bit too too cheesy for our taste.  Probably could sub some cottage cheese for American and get creamy but less processed cheese taste.
