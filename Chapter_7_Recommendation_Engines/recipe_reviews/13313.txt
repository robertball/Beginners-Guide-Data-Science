Well....this is a prize winner recipe.  I've made this many times and have tweeked it to perfection.  Use BUTTER, not margarine.  The onion should be Vadalia.  It adds an exceptional flavor and a touch of sweetness to the soup.  The original recipe says to use the florettes....nonsence...chop the stems and leaves and throw them in.  It says to simmer 10 minutes, NOPE.  It takes at least 20 minutes for the broccoli to become soft.  DON'T use a hand mixer to smash the broccoli.  Use a potato masher and don't go nuts mashing it.  Larger pieces of broccoli really make this soup exceptional.  If you use a blender or mixer, you'll have a bowl of druel.  Try this...fry up a few pieces of bacon and crumble it in the soup.  It adds another dimension to this recipe.  Everyone loves this soup, including kids.  PS...Use Oberweis SKIM MILK.  You can't tell the difference from whole milk and you can save a bunch of calories.

This recipe is great!  I highly recommend it.  We don't put it in the blender - just use a potato masher.

VERY easy to make, comes out GREAT exactly as directed, for the second time I made it I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups milk to get a richer taste. I highly recommend adding parmesan cheese to the top of the bowl when serving.

GREAT!!!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I used 2 stalks chopped celery, 2 cans College Inn Chicken Broth, 1 Cup Milk, 1 Cup Heavy Cream.  I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.

This recipe is perfectly titled; this soup is the bomb!  Rather than puree, I followed another member's suggestion and just let the broth and broccoli boil down, but after 10 minutes, I took some of the broccoli out, so we could have some big pieces of it in the soup.  I doubled the broth, because it does boil off quite a bit.  What a keeper- this is my new broccoli soup, thanks!! (But just know that it doesn't smell so great while it's cooking, but it will taste good)

This soup is wonderful.  I made only minor adjustments to suit my tastes.  I left out the celery and added fresh garlic, more onion and red pepper flakes.  I also added a bit of cream cheese when I was blending the soup.  I used half milk and half evaporated milk and added a pinch of nutmeg at the end.  This is definitely going into the recipe box.  Thanks.

This was a great base to start w/but I tweaked it a bit b/c I'm vegetarian and wanted a Broccoli Cheese Soup.  This will be my permanent recipe, b/c it was perfect.  My changes: 1/2 lg red onion, 2 stalks celery, a few handfuls of baby carrots (chopped), 4c. Unchicken Broth, 2c. Low Sodium Vegetable Broth, 2.5 lbs of broccoli florets, 3 c. Rice Milk, 1 c. Fat Free Half and Half, 1 sprig fresh marjoram, 1/8 -1/4 of a block of fat free cream cheese (gave it more body) and a bit of light Velvetta.  For the roux I used a butter, EVOO blend w/spelt flour, sea salt and white pepper. 

I found a huge bag of broccoli florets @ Sam's Club/Costco so that really helped things along.  I prefer a chunkier soup so I just used my hand blender and blended half of the soup or so.  The broccoli was really tender when all was said and done anyway.  It was really very, very good.

I avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it isn't really the recipe if i do that, however that being said, the  only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after, I like my soup a little chunky.

I would give it 5, but I made adjustments. I added a clove of garlic to the onion/celery mix. I also added 1 shredded carrot to the broccoli. I used veg. base instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. Also, I added sharp cheddar to the milk rue. Much better than using Velveeta. It was very yummy and even my fussy 2 1/2 yr old ate it up!

I have made this a few times, and I really like it - its hearty and tasty.  I have, however, changed a few things up.  Instead of using 2 separate pots, I saute the onion and celery (and I add a clove of minced garlic) in the butter, then stir in the flour to make a roux, then add in the broth.  I just don't like unneccessary steps and extra dirty dishes.  (Call me lazy if you want...)  I also use less onion (about 1/2 an onion, as opposed to a whole one) and more celery (3 ribs instead of 1).  And, as some others suggested, I use half and half in place of milk to make it creamier.  Even without modifying though, its still a good soup with lots of flavor.

Torn about reviews and what I really thought of this recipe. I really didn't care for this recipe at all. Followed it to a T and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup. And bland. No umph of flavor. As much salt and pepper as I had to use, it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that I've had. So sorry, it needs something.

This soup freezes really well, also.   I made it 2 weeks ago, froze it, and de-frosted it for lunch today and it was terrific!

Wish I could review it 4.5 stars, but alas -- I made this with only a few alterations, which I would DEFINITELY suggest for added depth and flavour. First, I added two chopped garlic cloves to the onions and celery. Then when I added the broccoli, I also added 3 small, chopped and peeled potatoes to add a bit of depth and thickness. I also chopped up some old cheddar cheese -- about 3 or 4 tbsp worth -- and added it to the soup. Lastly, when I pureed it, I took out a few scoops of hte broccoli and put it back in after pureeing the rest. A very hearty, delicious and healthy soup! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, I added two leeks and blended the entire pot.   I did add some cream to the roux mixture along with milk and I think that's a nice touch.  The whole family ate it up!  Served with some fresh focaccia bread.

I read a lot of reviews on this recipe before I made it.  I was a bit concerned from the onset that it didn't have enough seasoning in it.  I added quite a bit of seasoning in addition to what was asked for.  It's surprising to me that everyone is/was adding nutmeg to this soup, claiming it was missing something.  It was obvious to me that no one mentioned lemon pepper.  I find that I use lemon pepper in almost everything, it's an excellent spice and lends itself to almost everything, but particularly to broccoli.  I did change the whole premise of the soup though, because I used 4 cans of chicken broth and 2 one pound packages of broccoli cuts.  I also increased the amount of butter/flour for the roux and in addition to spicing the chicken broth and broccoli with lemon pepper, onion (dried), garlic powder, onion powder and about 2 tablespoons of chicken base (paste) I spiced the roux with the same measurements that were already in the broccoli base, adding about 1 tablespoon of celery salt.  I cooked this mixture for about a minute added 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.  I cooked the roux for about 5 minutes to let it thicken and then mixed with the broccoli and chicken broth.  I let it set for about 15 minutes to meld the flavors and realized it needed more salt.  I added about a teaspoon and it was perfect.  I'm giving the recipe as is a three star rating, but with the addition of what I put in, absolutely 5 and I am considering submitting it to Allrecipe

i really enjoyed this soup.  i barely mashed up the broccoli, i like having bigger chunks instead of it all being pureed.  also, trying to watch calorie/fat intake i substituted a light butter spread for the butter, so obviously the butter flour mixture didn't really thicken like it would have if i'd used real butter.  quick fix - mix 2T cornstarch with 2T water and it thickened it right up.  very good soup!

This soup turned out DIVINE.  My good friend and I whipped it up tonight.  Although we tweaked the recipe a bit (can't ever go wrong with a little bit o' garlic!), this recipe is a great starter for any direction you'd like to take.  I can see myself using this as filling for a pasta/broccoli casserole.

This was pretty good as listed, but I like my cream of broccoli a bit saltier, thicker, and creamier.  I made the following changes the second time and found it much more to my liking: 1) Toss about 2 teaspoons minced garlic with the onions and celery. 2) Instead of broth, use 3 cups water and 5 bouillon cubes, so it's saltier without being more watery. 3) Do not puree the soup.  Instead, chop the broccoli, about half finely and half roughly.  That way it cooks faster and has some texture without huge chunks. 4) Increase the roux from 3T/3T/2c to 6T/6T/3.5c.

Very, very good.  The second time I tried for lower fat and easy clean up.  I am sure the suggestions of cream would be delicious but I didn't want to feel guilty.  Didn't saute-just started with simmering veggies and left our the first butter.  Used a stick blender right in the pan.  Creamed the butter and flour in small bowl and added ball to soup before milk.  This will quickly stir in and not lump.  I added about 2 teaspoons of mustard.  Small amounst of mustard add interest but can't be identified.  I add mustard to soups, salad dressing, mac and cheese.

This recipe is simply excellent. Don't understand the bland comments as it tastes like freshly made soup is supposed to taste delicious and natural not canned or chemical. I use vegetable stock to keep the soup vegetarian friendly - I have also used half cauliflower and half brocolli  and as other reviewers suggest - use a potato masher not an electric blender for superb results - thanks.

I give the original recipe 4 stars. I give MY version 5 stars. Here's what I did: 1. I didn't have celery on hand, but I think it's a good idea. Instead I added about 3 cloves of garlic. (that's just a 'must-have' in a soup. sorry.) 2. My broccoli took 15 minutes to get tender. 3. Instead of blending all the soup, I blended HALF of it and left some broccoli so you can sink your teeth on something. ;)  3. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of skim milk. (You can skip the cream altogether and use milk for it to be less fatty) 4. At the end, it seemed a little bit bland. So I added about a teaspoon of sea salt - in addition to the pepper to taste. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. (No, I'm not crazy.) It really added another dimension to the soup. It is a brilliantly easy recipe, but not as good as my version. ;) (at least to me.) Even the kids gobbled it up. O.O that's when you know a recipe is good - KIDS eating BROCCOLI?! Yup, this is a keeper. :D

I had broccoli that need using so went in search of a soup.  This is so quick to make and the flavor is wonderful.  I browned my flour for the rue more than usual (multi tasking you know)  It added another layer of flavor.  Great meal for a cold September day.

This is a keeper.  I used olive oil to saute the onion and celery.  Added a little fresh garlic.  This is a very good soup.

Mmmm!  I thought this soup was fabulous!  I chopped up the broccoli in small bits then measured.  I didn't puree but mashing didn't do anything but make a huge mess when the masher slipped.  Anyway...I served it with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese.

I have made this soup and just like Ike1974, I like bits of broccoli  instead of puree soup. You do need to cook the broccoli til tender, about 20 minutes. I did use vidalia onion and butter.  I chopped the broccoli into chunks, stem and all. Added the flour and water mixture to thicken it up. After the broccoli got tender I turned down to medium low and threw in 2 tbls of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 2 tblsp of shredded parmesan cheese and stirred til melted. I added 1 tblsp of salt and 2 tblsp of ground black pepper.

This was basically broccoli puree. Bland beyond belief. Needs seasoning. I'm a wonderful cook so I know it was the recipe & not my cooking. Don't bother with this one.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe with a few changes. Added a clove of garlic, and 1 potato because I didn't have enough broccoli.  I also cooked it in one pot.  Sautéed onion/celery in butter, then added flour, then water/broccoli and cooked.  Then added milk at the end.  It was awesome!! My 3 kids loved it, and my 18 month old ate 2 bowls and then licked her bowl clean! Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM. You won't be disappointed, especially if this is your first time tacking this stuff. I have always loved creamy broccoli soup but for some reason have never thought to make it. Now it's a regular! I didn't puree, but instead used a potato masher. I also simmered for more like 20 minutes rather than 10, and added some thinly shredded carrots as well. Absolutely delicious.

Used 2 lb. bag of chopped frozen broccoli cuts, used the potato masher - PERFECT! Big hit, thinking of making double next time and freezing half as a base before doing the roux/milk.

Excellent soup.  I changed a few things because somehow I can't ever make a recipe without doing that.  I added two shredded carrots to the onion and celery when they were about halfway done.  I added 6 cups of broccoli at the beginning and then pureed the soup with a hand blender when the broccoli was done.  While preparing the roux I added the remaining two cups of chopped broccoli to the hot puree so that there was extra texture to the soup.  I then added the roux and left it boil until the broccoli was tender, only about 5 minutes.  I made the roux with 2% milk, that is what I had.  I then  added a little 1/2 and 1/2 at the end for creaminess, not sure this would be needed with the whole milk.  I added a little extra salt and served it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon.  YUMMY!

I did a 3 serving soup. First I sauted the onions in margarine. (I skipped on the celery.) I added 1 chicken boulion cube, and 1 and a half cups of boiling water. Next I added the broccoli. I had some asparagus as well as some mushrooms on hand and threw in 3 asparagus stocks as well as 4 button mushrooms. After about 25 of simmering I used a potato masher to mash up the broccoli, asparagus, and mushrooms. I like a chunky soup. I didn't use flour because I find that it makes dishes taste bland. Instead I grabbed a small glass and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and then the milk. I then mixed it into the soup, which thickened quickly. It tasted really good, but it needed pepper, so I added about half a teaspoon of lemon pepper. To my serving I added some aged cheese (from 2005), and some medium cheddar. This soup is so good! I'll make it again I have a craving for broccoli soup.

Excellent comfort soup for a snowy day!  Very quick and easy to make too.  I made a few changes.  I left out the celery, substituted with soy milk, added garlic salt to taste and used a potato masher instead of the blender as someone suggested.  It was creamy and yummy!

I've been looking for the perfect recipe for this soup and I think I've found it!  I made a couple minor changes...I used chicken stock instead of broth, 2 bags of Trader Joe's frozen broccoli florets (the best frozen broccoli I've found!) instead of fresh, and skim milk since I had it on hand, and the soup turned out wonderful.  I added a bit of salt too.  When eating the leftovers the next day, I added some shredded cheddar cheese which gave it a nice flavor and texture.  It's a great basic recipe...definitely a keeper!

Oh, so good! I just ate from my first batch of this soup, pretty much exactly according to the recipe. I didn't use just the florets, but the broccoli stalk (peeled) as well. Also didn't have the last cup of broccoli so added 1/2 a celery stalk extra. Next time I'll try adding asparagus and garlic as well. I'm diabetic so really glad the soup is not only delicious but low carb as well.

This was a great broccoli soup. The only thing I would change is to only puree 1/2 so that you have some broccoli pieces left in the soup. Served with bacon and cheese. YUM!

I had some fresh and frozen broccoli I needed to use so I decided to make this recipe.  I was a little short on broccoli so I scaled the recipe to make 4 servings.  I used my emersion blender to puree this right in the pot and found I needed to add another half cup of broth because it was too thick.  I froze this before adding the butter, flour and milk but will add those after thawing and reheating.  This is a good, basic broccoli soup recipe that I’m sure I’ll be making again.

I found the recipe a bit bland.  Added lots of salt and would have liked more depth -- perhaps potatoes, cheese or butter.

If I made again I'd probably saute the garlic, then the celery, then the onions for a carmelized flavor.  Then I'd add salt and the chicken stock.  I'd probably put some half and half with the butter and milk.  And then I'd do as some said, puree half and leave some large florets.  Grated parmesan on top.

I can't give this recipe the way it is 5 stars - had to make too many changes.  Broccoli florets aren't very good when pureed - they end up being grainy.  If you use only the broccoli stems, that's another story.  The way I make this soup which is really delicious is to use both the florets and the stems - making sure to peel the stems.  Chop everything into 1 inch pieces.  After adding the broccoli to the sauteed veggies add 1/2 tsp of salt, some black pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper and a dash of ground cloves.  Cook the broccoli for at least 20 minutes.  If you live at high altitude, you may need to cook it longer, but you want the broccoli to be pretty soft.  Let it cool a bit and then, like other people on this site, I mash the broccoli with a hand potato masher until it's broken up into small pieces.  Then I cook up the roue with the milk and add it to the soup.  Taste for flavor and add more salt if necessary. I learned that vegetables like spinach, celery and broccoli can use a bit of a lift from spices like cloves, and any soup is improved by a dash of cayenne or a bit of Tabasco sauce.  This soup is just OK the way the recipe is written, but these changes make it delicious.  If you're cooking gluten free, use white rice flour instead of wheat flour for the roue.

I am not going to give it a rating because I changed a lot of things. (they are making me rate it to submit, I give myself 5 stars!!

 First, I added 3 whole cloves of garlic with celery, onion, butter mixture.
Second, I added 1 good sized potato cut into 2 inch chunks 
Three, I added carrots (about 2 cups worth whole baby sized)
Four, I used a whole head of broccoli.
same amount of water/stock
brought to a boil then dropped to a simmer till potatoes were done (about 30 mins)
I did blend the soup in stages as I had left everything very, VERY chunky. 

For the roux, I doubled the butter and flour to 6T each as per another poster but used 2 cups of milk.  
Salt and peppered the veggies before mixing in my roux.  
It is going to be thick, like, wall paper paste thick, but I like it that way. 


HOLY COW!  This is the BEST FREAKIN' SOUP EVAR!  
It reminds me of the cream of vegetable soup from A.O.C. L'aile ou la Cuisse in NYC's West Village on Bleecker.

Worked great with chicken bouillon, and I used a tip from another user: instead of blender, use a potato masher! I mashed while cooking the roux. Delicious as a wintery season lunch.

This was great!  I used vegetable broth, carrots instead of celery (what I had in the house).  I cooked the onion, carrots and broccoli in the butter, added the broth and let it cook on high for 15 minutes.  I added liberal amounts of sea salt.  Pureed it all, then added the melted butter, flour and milk. Shredded parm cheese was a wonderful addition.  All my kids loved this!

I'm a huge fan of cream of broccoli soup, but I didn't care for this at all. Followed the recipe with no changes. I found it to be very bland and didn't like the texture. Ended up throwing the whole pot away. Very disappointed after reading all these rave reviews.

Loved this recipe, I did not have as much broccoli as required in the recipe but the result was still great. And very easy to make, no fuss.

Finished product was way too thin for my liking.  I almost knew that when I saw the amount of liquid to roux.  Anyway, after making the soup I added a tablespoon of yogurt, it tasted amazing!  Very good.  I did add a little bit of garlic and tarragon.  And fresh grated Parmesan on top!  Very good recipe.

A keeper! I love that this soup is healthy, but still tasty. I topped it with cheddar, but it would have been good with just a bit of salt and pepper on top. I went easy on the blending to keep it a bit chunkier, but might try going really smooth next time depending on my mood. Thanks for sharing!

I give it 5 stars and only made minor alterations. I used 4 tablespoons butter while saute'ing onions, 3 stalks celery, and then 4 tablespoons butter and 1 1/2 cups milk when making rue. I also added 2 potatoes to the saute'. It makes the soup even creamier. I didn't use a blender, but used a hand blender and a hand masher on the broccoli. Delicious.

I cooked about 3 cups broccoli with sauted onions, celery and garlic powder added to the chicken broth then added 3/4 cup shredded carrots until tender to puree. Added 4 oz of  white sharp cheddar cheese to the flour and half and half cream and combined all adding salt, pepper and garlic to taste with some broccoli florets. Enjoyed

This a good soup with great broccoli flavor.  Of course, you do have to get over the army green color.  I added minced garlic in with the celery and onion.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth to cook the fresh broccoli.  For the roux, I used one small can of evaporated milk as part of milk for a richer flavor.   The soup was even better reheated the next day!

I added twice the amount of butter, flour, and milk for creamier soup.  
(More fattening though)   
Absolutely delicious!!

This soup had great flavor.  I used skim milk to make mine and pureed only have of the broth so I would have some chunks of broccoli (like other reviewers did).  I think this made the broth thinner than it would have been.  My broth would have benefited from being thicker, so I will either use whole milk or add some cream or cheese the next time - - although this obviously will add calories.

A good starters recipe for this soup. Even though it isn't the original recipe any more.... I added some carrots and did what other reviewers said by adding sweet onion instead of regular. I also made it with some fresh parsley sprigs, dried lime leaves, bay leaves, cheddar cheese and smoked cheddar cheese. Maybe I will make it as is next time and see how I like it to give it a fair rating. Otherwise, it was good!

I really loved this recipe, easy and quick.  I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup milk to add some richness and I also used asparagus with the broccoli.  I also pureed it a little bit in my food processor, but left it a little chunky. It was delicious and I will be making it again!

This soup was great!  I made it mostly as directed.  I omitted the celery (my daughter didn't want it) and used 1.5 c milk and .5 c heavy cream instead of the 2c. milk.  I also took other's advise and used a potato masher to break up the broccoli instead of blending it.  I don't care for pureed soup.  As many have stated, it takes more than 10 minutes to soften the broccoli. My entire family (including 3 children, 10 & under) loved it!

My kiddos were STARVED, so I didn't take the time to sautee the onions and celery and just omitted them. Still, this soup was unbeatable with only broccoli. I couldn't believe it. I know that next time (with a little better planning) when I make it with the celery and onion that it will be out of this world. 

I didn't blend, but mashed with the potato masher. It had cooked for about 20 minutes and was very soft. Also used frozen broccoli floretes and it was SO easy to have a super quick meal in no time.

I made this soup exactly as the directions indicated, precisely measuring all ingredients. The soup just wasn't thick enough. Actually, it was really thin. I had to thicken it. The flavor, prior to thickening more, was pretty good. It's a little bland - seemed like it needed salt for some reason and I did NOT use sodium free broth. I think this is a good recipe and it just needs tweaked. I'll play with this next time and see how it turns out. Thanks for sharing.

I paired this soup with a turkey and cheese melt and, boy, was this good!  So here's what I did:  I used the suggestion of a previous reviewer and chopped up the stems and leaves of the broccoli.  I sauteed the onion and celery in butter until tender; added in the broccoli and chicken broth; simmered it for about 20-25 minutes; in the meantime, I made the white sauce (butter, flour, half and half instead of whole milk and beat it until it was thick); then, I mashed the broccoli/onion/celery/broth mixture with a potato masher (to leave some texture to it); and added in the white sauce and let everything simmer for a bit.  I did add salt to my desired taste (because I like seasoning and the recipe did not call for any).

This is a great recipes!  I following it excatly and used skim milk.  I may part cream next time or possible even some cream cheese as I found it needed a slight boost in flavour.  I also added salt and pepper and it made a world of difference

Well~ those 16oz frozen bags of broccoli only have 4 cups in them so this turned into "Best Cream of What-needed-to get-used-up." So I had those 4 cups, 1 cup of fresh broccoli, 1 cup of cauliflower, and 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas. It tastes pretty good actually. You would never know it wasn't just broccoli. I liked this because it wsas super easy and very cheap to make. I didn't love it because it's bland and should have garlic or cheese or something. And the texture is off. Don't blend all of the broccoli and don't cook the milk/flour until "thick" or you will get broccoli pudding! Stop when it's like a sauce, before it gets to a gravy consistancy and it will better. But I liked it enough to make again and change the things I didn't like.

Delicious!  My kids really enjoyed it.  I had to make it gluten free for my daughter, so I used rice flour, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  It was fast to make and I put it in the crock pot to keep warm.  Will definitely make again.

this recipe was just a tad bland for my cooking style but I added 2c of sharp cheddar cheese at the end and added a little bit of salt.  I did read other reviews and I did not blend all of the soup because I like a little texture in my soup.  I would make it again but with the tweaks that i added.

I liked this soup but it could have been creamier for 'best cream' of broccoli soup. My kids didn't really like it and my husband didn't go for seconds (and he's usually easy to please)

This is amazing and so easy. I use large package of frozen broccoli and simmer it for 15 minutes. I also took the advice of other reviewers and use a potato masher after 15 minutes. My kids love it and actually ask me to make it.

I made this with my 12 year old daughter.  I don't even like broccoli and I had to admit it was delicious!  If you want a more refined creamy soup I suggest you run it through a strainer.

Pretty tasty! Not as thick and creamy as I had hoped, but the flavor was really tasty. I threw in some potato, carrot, garlic, salt and pepper based on what others had indicated. I may try it again with cream in the place of the milk next time to see if I could get it thicker.

Very good! I had a bag of fresh broccoli and cauliflower florets I needed to use, using both it ended up to be about the 8 cups. Another reviewer mentioned mashing it in the pot, which worked well, but I also used the immersion blender just slightly to bring it together more. Next time I think I'll use low sodium chicken broth, just my personal preference.

This was simple and fabulous. My 8 and 9 year olds gobbled it up and one wants to take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Here were my (minor) substitutions: Fresh broccoli (stems and all) rather than frozen, an extra half cup of milk, a shake of onion powder and garlic powder, plus I added a tiny bit of nutmeg as suggested by others. I didn't have to chop hardly at all, just chunked things up and threw them in there - once they were soft the immersion blender did the rest.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out really good and really tasty. Always read the reviews from other people such great ideas. I mashed the broccoli and ended up put it in a blender and pulsed lightly. I cooked some turkey bacon and crumbled some in each serving. It was very filling. I also added some salt and garlic powder.

I really like this recipe. A lot of recipes i want to try call for a can of cream of broccoli soup, but I don't like to use canned anything. This seemed to fit my needs perfectly.  I read throught the copmments and followed one suggestion simmering for 20 mminutes instead of 10. Also, I am trying not to use cow milk, so I substituted with almond milk. Very tasty.

I don't like when people review recipes and change the whole recipe..but, I made this adding a couple cloves of garlic and a sweet potato for extra nutrition. It was great and my kids loved it too.  So healthy!

When I looked at the recipe it looked pretty quick, so I figured I would make for lunch, but it took a little longer than expected. I used frozen defrosted broccoli. When it was done it was a lot more bland than I expected. I only had 1% milk, so I used that, but I think whole milk would have been much better. To flavor it some I added a couple of pinches of onion and garlic powder. That helped some, but it still seemed like it was missing something? But, I also prefer a chunkier soup to.

Excellent soup!  Rated it as 4 stars because the exact recipe was bland for my taste.  I added extra salt & pepper, celery salt, garlic powder to the soup.  I also added 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese to the milk & flour mixture.  Melted the cheese before adding back into the soup pot.  Served with additional cheddar to top and saltine crackers.  Thank you for sharing, this will be one I keep.

This was not the best but ok.  I was able to doctor it up with some seasoning.  I won't be making again as written as it's way too bland.  I agree it is sort of just broccoli puree without some help.

This soup was good! I didn't blend the blend the soup, as I like my soup with bites of broccoli throughout. I did also find that once mixed with the cream mixture it needed salt. But that may be because I used low sodium broth. Great recipe.

This is a good and easy recipe. I took some advise from other reviewers and only pureed 1/2 of the broccoli. After it was done I steamd another 4 cups of broccoli and added it to the soup. Also added some dried dill and salt.

this is great!  I am on a vegetarian diet and decided to cut the chicken stock and use vegetable stock. I DID add one chicken bullion cube. I also used skim milk and margarine, and I used olive oil instead of butter to sautee the onion and celery in. YUMM!

For such a simple recipe, this soup is very flavorful. I only had green onions on hand and used 1% milk although the recipe isn't specific on that one. I also sauteed the onion and celery in olive oil. Those were the only adjustments. I taste tested it before serving and found myself starting to eat it. Oops. Good thing it was for my family and not guests. Thanks for sharing this simple, healthy soup with us.

I just made this and it was great! with just a few adjustments..i added a little more chicken broth then this called for and let the broccoli simmer for 25 minutes instead of 10. I reserved a cup of the soft broccoli to add at the end and pureed the rest in my blender as i don't like my soup to be all liquid. I added 1 1/2 tsp salt and a few dashes of garlic powder and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. So good and a great way to eat some veggies!

A lovely soup that can be prepared in no time at all.  I cooked only the broccoli stocks (peeled first) in the chicken broth.  I allowed the stock to simmer down quite a bit, pureed and added the milk.  There was no need to thicken the soup since I had cooked the broth down so much.  I steamed small broccoli floweret's and added to the soup.

Thick and satisfying even when made with low fat milk, this soup is a dieter’s dream.  I added a couple of cloves of garlic when I sautéed the onion and celery and whirled it all up with my immersion blender.  A squeeze of lemon in each bowl before serving brightened the flavor.  My teen who was sick with a sore throat ate bowl after bowl (I doubled the recipe) and took the remainder back to school with her.  Great soup!

Good soup!  I didn't have any celery so I did onion and garlic...added the broth and lots of broccoli - didn't measure - got a big bag of broccoli at produce junction and it seemed like enough - it was.  I pureed most of it in my cuisinart and left some chunks of onion and broccoli.  I added nutmeg as one reviewer suggested and loved it.  My husband insisted something was missing and added madiera - which was good - but be careful of the pour.  I made this yesterday and as I do with other soups-  only eat it the next day - delish!  I made some homemade croutons for toppers and shredded parmesan and cheddar cheese so we could decide what we wanted on top.  Both good.  Will make again!  *oh...forgot that i was low on milk so I added a can of cream of celery soup which was good because you really should use celery in this soup so the taste was nice.

This was excellent. I made my own broth using leftover bones of ham and fat, added celery, carrot, and onions. Simmer for about 3 hours.  This is a great make ahead soup, I let it sit in the crock pot until dinner. Served this with homemade yeast rolls. Delish!

I used broccoli from my garden, stems and all and wish to advise you that If you add stems, please make note to do the following:
Cut them very small (chopped size) and cook them very well, otherwise your soup may have fibers in it.  If it does just put your blender on liquidate and let it run for a little while.  Hold out the little florets of broccoli until you have finished cooking and blending the soup and then add them back.  They won't take long to cook and will add some interest.  I added Chinese five spice to the soup and it was a great addition.

I skipped the celery because I didn't have it, but added everything else as specified. This recipe is simple and delicious!  A few bacon bits and parm on top complete it.  I will definitely make this again.

I have made this soup again and again and it always hits the spot!I use shallots for the onion and I increase the celery and onion by not quite double.Like others have suggested I use a potato masher, but what makes this a five star recipe for me and my family is cheese. Before stirring it into the soup, I add about a cup of grated sharp cheddar to the milk mixture as it thickens. Not for the calorie counters, but SO delicious. I made this as the starting course for Easter dinner at my in-laws and it was a huge hit! The next day I put some of the leftover Easter ham into the leftover soup, YUMMY! Lastly, I have found that this recipe can be doubled or tripled without any problems. Thank you Jesse A!

Delicious! I didn't use celery but I added 2 cloves of garlic when sauteing the onions. I used a hand blender to blend the soup, but I only blended a third of it so because I wanted to leave bits of broccoli intact. I added about a tsp of salt, pepper and a half tsp of chili powder and flakes. Next time I'll set aside broccoli florets to add at the end. Great recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

this was amazing!  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions, used half and half, only because I needed to use some up, 1/2 brick cream cheese, and nutmeg.  My whole family lOVED it!

I tried this recipe Sept. 26th 2008.  It was very easy to make and very tasty and good.  I will make this soup often. A lot of flavor in a few easy steps.  I did add some graded chedder cheese.  That was the only change I made to this recipe. Think I'll leave it just like the recipe calls for.....with a little added cheese at the end, just before serving.

very good - used two cans of chicken broth;  next time, I might try three cans - it evaporates a lot while cooking the broccoli.  Also, I only pureed about half of the soup (large chunks of broccoli), and left the rest for some texture in the soup.

Wow - what a soup! I used olive oil rather than margarine and used two onions and three cloves of garlic. I also needed to add more liquid - five cups of broth still made a very thick soup. I served with grated cheese and it was a big hit!

i've made this a few times... always turns out great.  i usually add 3 chopped onions (instead of 1), and a bunch of minced garlic.  i'll use celery if i have it, but i usually don't have it on hand.  i don't measure the broccoli, i just buy two stalks.  you can totally skip the blending step and just let the soup cook down... doesn't take long and it's easier!  add a bit more water or stock as it cooks down if you need to

This was good and easy. I added 6 chopped garlic cloves in with the onion. I  used the florets and peeled and diced the stalk. Added 1/2 teaspoon Emeril's essence into the broth. Broccoli took about 20 minutes not 10.

I goofed with this recipe quite a bit.  Because I only had about 4 cups broccoli instead of 8, I added a couple carrots.  Then I added a dash nutmeg and leftover velvetta.  I added some salt, some Lawry's seasoned salt and finally some left over juice from Rotel tomatoes...that did the trick.  My guests were impressed and went back for more.  Oh yeah...I served it with cornbread.

I've made this exactly as directed, and it was good.  But I found a key component that takes it to 5 stars and beyond:  In my ex-husband's midlife quest to convince himself he wasn't aging, he up and turned vegan on me (he thought it enhanced his mountain biking skillz...way to go, buddy)--which left me constantly scrambling, trying to figure out ingredients to make recipes taste like they were still made with the original ingredients to satiate my own carnivorous palate.  I found that if you substitute the chicken broth with MISO SOUP, this recipe turns WOW.  
Yes, you read that right.  
I omit the broth, take 3 cups water, add a healthy dollop of miso paste and WOW.  Just WOW.  
Even my roommate and her daughter--neither of which like broccoli, eat the bejeezus out of this soup.
He's since run off with the proverbial younger blonde, but I still have this one relic of vegan life to thank him for.  
And now you're welcome, too.

Followed the recipe and made a few adjustments. Added shredded carrot when the broccoli and broth went into the pot.  Also added some shredded cheddar cheese, and some salt to taste.  It was very good!

My 15 year old twin sons inhaled this soup before my husband got home tonight.   It was all I could do to reserve a bowl for him!   Needs a little salt.   I will definitely make it again, but it will need to be doubled or tripled for my family!

Update: The flavor was even better when I added onion powder and basil.  I saw a reviewer added nutmeg.  Might try that next time..

I just made this soup. It is outstanding. I followed the recipe closely but not exactly. I used skim milk as that is the only milk I buy now.  I used fresh broccoli including most of the stalks. I just cooked the broccoli a little longer to soften the tougher parts. I cut off the really fibrous thick ends. I will never buy another can of commercially made cream of broccoli soup. This was very easy to make, inexpensive, and contains great nutrients. Thanks go to Jessie and to all who made the recipe, reviewed it, and gave their suggestions.

Like others I tweaked it. I love garlic so added 3 cloves. I didn't use the blender either just mashed a bit.

I've actually been making this recipe for years. My Mom got it from passed it along to me and I just love it. It's a fantastic way to get your veggies in a healthy and tasty way. It's not too creamy which I love. I think this time I'll try one of the suggestions to not puree it, but leave some chunks. We'll see how that turns out.

I loved this recipe! I've been looking forward to cooking cream of broccoli soup ever since I had some on a trip we made to Scotland, we were staying in Inverness and the hotel had the most amazing cream of broccoli soup so I made this one hoping it would be the same taste, it was even better! My family loved it as well, this one is definitely going to our weekly menu.

How does this soup have such a high rating with NO salt?  It is soooo bland without it.  Add salt, and possibly a handful of sharp cheddar cheese to your bowl, and you've got a winner!  However, no salt = no flavor.  (Only explanation I can think of is I used homemade chicken broth, which I NEVER add salt to.  Perhaps the canned stuff is so high in salt already that this tastes good without the salt).  I thickened with arrowroot powder as an alternative to white flour.

I changed the soup slightly and it became a broccoli cheese soup - increase the chicken broth to 2 cups(2 cans) and add 1+ cups of shredded cheddar cheese to the roux.  It was fantastic!  JosieMom

I really liked this soup but I did not stick to their measurements........but used all ingredients except celery-
really quite good-  I cook a lot and usually change up the recipes....upon serving this I added crumbled crisp bacon and grated sharp cheddar to the top of each bowl....everyone had seconds!

I thought this recipe was great! I tweaked it like others and added garlic and carrot while I sautéed the celery and onion. I just think that's always a great base. I also mashed with a potato masher as suggested since I do like some chunks in my soup.  Tonight, I wanted something a little cheesy so I added about a cup of cheddar to the roux before adding that to the soup. It's great! I love the versatility of either going creamy or cheesy!  I will definitely make this again and depending on my mood - might leave out the cheese. Thanks for the recipe :)

It was good but next time I think I will replace some of the milk with cream.  It lacked any richness but it was plenty thick from the flour.  I took many others suggestion to cook the broccoli longer and smash it with with a potato masher.  Some bacon on top would have made a huge difference.

In my opinion, there are two kinds of broccoli soups; one is bold and the other is delicate.  Many restaurants serve the hearty kind  with scallions, cheese and sometimes bacon.  This particular version is a more delicate one.    It is tender and tasty, and perfect for lunch on a chilly day.  If it's not exciting enough for you, add the extras you like.  Either way, it's a treat.

I've been trying for years to make a good batch of my favorite soup, cream of broccoli.  I'm no expert in the kitchen, but this was delicious and soooo easy!  The only adjustments I made were using buttermilk for half of the roux because I ran out of milk.  I added a pinch of nutmeg as some reviewers suggested.  I also ended up doubling the roux because I used way to much stock.  I also only used a potato masher for the broccoli.  Fantastic!

Yum! This was absolutely delish!!! My broccoli-hating hubs was out with his dad last night. It was downright chilly outside and a rainy, dreary day to boot - perfect soup making weather! Although an excellent base recipe, ike is right.... This is in need of a few tweaks. First and foremost, ABSOLUTELY use more than just broccoli florets!Simmer for at LEAST 20 minutes (10 minutes is not nearly long enough!) and DO NOT puree (just mash gently, leaving some chunks). And you don't need to use anything but a basic 'ol yellow (or white) onion. I didn't have the Vidalia onion ike suggested and my soup was fine without it. The only tip missing from ike's review is to season to taste with SALT. This simple addition REALLY enhances the overall flavor, IMHO. NOTE #1: A small head of broccoli will EASILY yield 4 cups florets (ESPECIALLY if you include the stems). NOTE #2: If you are looking to cut calories, fat-free milk is a GREAT substitute (and using it doesn't affect this awesome soup in the least). For a special treat, serve in a sourdough bread bowl and garnish with shredded (SHARP) cheddar and / or chopped bacon. Heck, you can even add some cheese to the soup itself! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe with the AR community, Jessie. My hubs just doesn't know what he's missing haha. :-)

Wonderful flavor!  As the title suggests, this is the best cream of broccoli I've had so far.  I used the stalks in addition to the florets -- just peel them first so they're not too bitter or tough.

this was awesome. I didnt have chicken broth so i made my own out of chicken bullion cubes. It went perfectly along side of grilled cheeses. I have 2 stepkids 12 and 7 and they didn't like the looks of it at first but they ate every bite. Great recipe. easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing. My only issue was when i put it in the blender my blender was in "on" position and i didnt have my hand on the cover and i lost some soup and burned my arm lol. so be cautious with the blender and don't over blend.

This didn't have much flavor, but it was also a healthier version of a full cream soup so that makes sense. I will be making again, but will make some adjustments.

Love this recipe! I tried adding a little bacon (didn't really notice much of a difference but wasn't bad either). It took much longer for the broccoli to soften than the original recipe says (I would allow at least 25 minutes, depending on how small you cut the florets). Also, I ladled a couple of cups from the soup into my food processor and blended it. Afterwards, I added it back into the cooking soup. That left the consistancy nice-- smooth with florets of broccoli still left (you definitely want to leave some broccoli unmashed so it's not completely runny)...some sharp cheddar would've been good too as a topping. Thanks for the recipe!

Finally I can get my kids to eat their veggies. They ate 2 bowls each. I added some carrots and sauted them together with onions and celery. When the soup was ready I put half of it in a tall container and blended it with an immersion blender for the kids. My husband enjoyed the not blended half. Delicious!

I had some left over broccoli to use up, and this recipe fit the bill!  Cut it down to 4 servings and followed the recipe loosely.  My broccoli had been sauteed with roasted peppers and garlic, which really enhanced the soup as well, I believe.  Hubs said to make THIS one again, and not mess with trying others.  Will do!

Of course I altered the recipe using what I had.  First I trimmed the broccoli stems & chopped them up.  I then sauteed all the veggies & garlic  1 chopped carrot [for more flavor] reserving the flowerettes.  Proceeded to follow recipe.  When done the soup was thin & a little bland, so I thickened it with hot pepperjack cheese & some hot sauce.  When ready to serve I blanched the flowerettes & added them to the soup.  Presentation  looked great!  Nice bright green veggies in my soup.  So inviting.  Try it you"ll like it!
Everybody licked their bowls clean.  Including the kids.

It's a good basic soup recipe for my creativity. Depends on what I have in the fridge, I might add carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, even tilapia for a twist. Of course, I won't waste broccoli stems. I cook them first with onions for about 15 minutes and mash them coarsely with a potato masher. Then I add broccoli florets and cook for another 10-15 minutes before mashing them to the texture I want. I prefer not to use blender because I'm too lazy to wash it. Add more milk at the end if the soup turns out to be too thick. It goes well with grilled cheese sandwiches.

I saved some of the broccoli to add to the soup after I blended it.

GREAT soup.  We made this to go along with Christmas dinner - got great reviews.  We did add cheddar cheese to the milk sauce so we did change it a little.  Also didn't puree it with the wand - we used a hand mixer that left some broccoli pieces bigger.  Will definitely be making again!  Thanks for sharing.

I got kind of a less flavorful soup.  It was okay but I added a bunch of pepper and some sour cream to liven it up.  Then it was pretty good.

Loved this! Read a few reviews and made the following modifications: 2 celery stalks, 1 additional cup of broth, 1/2 cup almond milk, salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste. Yummy! (Finally a way for me to love broccoli!)

This recipe came out terrific!  I omitted the celery since I didn't have any.  At the suggestion of some other reviewers, I made a few changes:  I added 1 large cubed potato after sweating the onions with a few cloves of garlic.  This is also when I added some chopped broccoli stems (no need to waste them) since they take longer to soften, and then added the florets after 10-15 minutes.  I reserved some of the cooked florets for texture and garnish, and blended the rest of the pot with an immersion blender.   As one reviewer suggested, I seasoned this soup at various steps throughout cooking to ensure that it would not turn out bland--it didn't.  I used some Nature's Seasoning, Seasoned Salt, some garlic powder, and also added some dried spinach flakes for color.  I also swapped heavy whipping cream for half of the amount of milk.  I think that the addition of potato and cream helped make this soup very rich and creamy.  I served it with some sharp cheddar, but it didn't need any extras.  It was very flavorful and delicious on its own.

This is a simply wonderful and satisfying soup! I made this as is a few months ago, and it was well received by all. In subsequent makings of this soup, I did add the stems and all as it does get creamed. As requested by family, I also thickened it more by using 5 tablespoons butter, ½ cup flour in the making of the rue. Then the family wanted to try it as a broccoli cheddar cheese soup. This was easily accomplished by adding 1 ½ to 2 cups of shredded light cheddar cheese once the rue is to the right thickening consistency. It is best to melt the cheese in the rue then add to the soup. So this is a two for one soup for our family and friends who ask for it on a regular basis!

I made this using all the proper ingredients, just changed the method.  Rather than using a blender I just mashed the cooked broccoli with a potato masher.  
It turned out soooo good.  The whole family loved it, including my 11 month old son.  Will add to my permanent collection.  

Thank you so much for sharing.

UPDATE:  I tried this recipe again and added about 1/4c of Velveeta cheese.. and WOW... incredible.  Very nice Cream of Broccoli and Cheddar version!

wonderful simplicity. I added my flour to the celery and onion before the broth, so I didn't use the second amount of butter listed. I also used a can of evaporated milk rather than 2 cups milk, as I wanted to freeze the extra, and that freezes better. Then I threw in a handful of shredded cheddar, because I had it and wanted it a little thicker. Tasted great both ways though...

Pretty much followed the recipe, minus the amount of time simmering the broccoli and vegetables, which was actually a little over double the time.  And I added carrot and garlic.  Delicious!

Even my kids enjoy this soup recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing. I had quite a bit of broccoli in the fridge that wasn't going to get eaten so I searched for a soup recipe.  I am so very happy I found this one, and this will always be my go to broccoli soup recipe. I do add some Velveeta cheese and after combining all ingredients I add a couple more tablespoons of flour to thicken up a bit more.

Great soup!  I didn't like the idea of making it completely smooth so I just used an immersion blender a little to break up the big chunks.  I used frozen brocoli and also subbed 1/2 c. half and half for 1/2 c. milk (the remaining was 2%).  I can't say if that made a difference but it still wasn't that thick so I think it was worth the calories.  I also added garlic and nutmeg based on previous reviews.  It needed salt to in my opinion.  Overall a great base recipe and SO simple to make.

I changed this a bit, I used frozen broccoli and added fresh garlic and half and half. It turned out really tasty, I was able to make it with things I just had in the house and that made it extra good!

It is DELICIOUS. My husband and I enjoy it so much.I triple the recipe and did everthing according to recipe except 1. I added half head of garlic and sauteed with onion 2. I didn't have celery so I sub. With parsley and thyme like someone mentioned 3. I use smart balance instead of butter. I used blender not stick blender. I added salt, pepper, the taste was great but dull. So I added 1 table spoon worcetershire sauce and that did the trick. I freeze leftover. Will definitely cook this again.

I used 1/2 and 1/2 and squahed with potato masher instead of blender as some suggested.  I made this 4 stars only because it was missing some seasonings, however it's an excellent base recipe and we loved the creaminess of the 1/2 and 1/2.  Thank you!

My kids love this soup, but I don't use butter at all, I like it more with two Ts. olive oil and I also put only one cup of milk and three Ts. Light creamy cheese, it really makes a direfference!

Great soup!!!!!! This is the first soup my 5 year old would ever try, and he loved it! followed the recipe mostly just added nutmeg and some cheddar cheese to the milk and flour mix. And used a potato masher instead of a blender.

This recipe is toddler approved!  My 3 kids gobble it up.  (granted, they love broccoli to start with)  Delicious as is, but I added carrots, frozen corn, and cooked chicken to make it a little heartier.  I cooked the broccoli to death and didn't bother pureeing it at all.  Grab some tuscan bread and call it a meal!

I made this soup and tasted it at the point when I added the flour mixture and it was very bland. I added extra garlic-I added some with the sauteed onions and it was still bland. I added extra pepper and almost a whole package of sharp cheddar cheese and it came a little tastier. I think the 5 star reviewers must be bland eaters because I was expecting it to be very good just by hearing the reviews alone. Still searching for a better version.

Perfect recipe as written, the only change I made was to use veggie broth instead of chicken broth since I'm vegetarian.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly and I think it is five stars on its own.  Next time I'll try adding cheese to the flour/milk mix just for a bit of a change.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper :)

great soup! i lightened it up by using 1 and 1/2 c skim milk and 1/2 c fat free half and half. i also didn't have a food processor, blender, or stick blender when i first made this, so i used an old-school potato masher and it still came out great, albeit a bit chunky (which i didn't mind at all.)  i was looking for a good broccoli soup recipe because i love a premade one from the supermarket but found it a bit expensive.

I used frozen broccoli from my own garden and home made chicken broth. Added a bit of grated carrot which didn't change the taste but added color. Topped each bowl with grated cheese and croutons. Yummy and just right on a cold winter night!

Delicious recipe, I have made this several times and it always turns out well. I didn't have celery this time so I just sprinkled a little celery salt in with the onions, also I pureed it in my food processor until smooth and it was excellent. My family all loved it! This will be my permanent Cream of Broccoli soup recipe.

Good Soup!! Very Filling!! Could use a little more milk/cream when you prepare. I served it with toasted French bread with Parmesean cheese slices on top. I will definitely make this soup again!!

Great! I added a spur of the moment thing which totally changed this soup...I had artichoke and asiago cheese dressing from New Years left over, added a few tablespoons of that and VOILA! Added an interesting dimension! Great recipe as is, though! THanks!

OMG!  This is the best soup I have ever made!  My husband and I love it.  I will be making this quite often.  I didn't puree the broccoli, celery and onions.  We prefer to have it a little more chunky.  This is an excellent recipe!  Definitely a 5 star recipe.

My Husband and I loved this soup although I made the following changes of my own and after reading advise from others: First, I used homemade chicken broth. Second, I use both broccoli flowers and peeled softer parts of the stems. I saute lg onion and pressed 2 garlic cloves into the broth. I added 4oz of 1/3 less fat Neufchatel cream cheese and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to the flour, milk and butter after it had thickened. Third, I used a potato masher while soup was cooking for more texture. I grated a pinch of fresh nutmeg on top of each bowl of soup. Made my husband smile :-) Thanks everyone for the team work!

AMAZING!! This came out wonderful, even though I am quite a beginner cook. I made this exactly the way it said, and I was so happy when I tasted it and thought "Wow!".  My husband loved it and could not wait for more, will definitely make this more in the future. Plus, it's a great way to get in your greens! :)

Really good.  Would have given it 5 stars but I added a couple of things to my taste.  3 cloves of garlic to the onion/celery mixture and a 4x4 cube of diced velveeta cheese to the milk mixture.  Will definitely keep on hand to make again

Really tasty soup. I had fresh broccoli I needed to use up so this seemed like the perfect recipe for that. I added garlic powder and a bit of garlic salt for more flavor and added 1 1/2 cups of grated cheddar cheese. Also went fattening the whole way and used 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup of milk. Made it that much better! It came out so rich & creamy.

Wow! Totally tasty! We have never had cream of broccoli before, but had some homegrown broccoli from last year floating around in freezer. It tends to get mushy when cooked, so soup seemed a good option.   Used 4 chicken bouillon cubes instead of stock as I didn't have any on hand and skipped the salt because of it. Used a immersion blender and it all turned bright, BRIGHT green (My homegrown broccoli was very dark green). The men in the family had fun with the way it looked, but they all got themselves bowls after being convinced to try it.    It was good the next day for lunch also.  We will be making this again! Thanks, Jessie.

Excellent recipe. I did make a couple changes. First I added a couple cloves of garlic when I was sweating the onions and celery. Instead of milk I used a can of evaporated skim milk and topped it up to 2 cups with skim milk. And lastly, the most important thing.....add a package of light Boursin cheese when pureeing the soup. MMMMMMMMMMM Super creamy and rich but still very healthy!

This recipe did not disappoint!  It produced a nice, creamy broccoli soup with a delicious flavor.  I pureed half of the pot of soup, leaving some smaller "chunks", which is just a preference of mine.  I also added a shredded carrot, a diced sweet potato, and some minced garlic for added flavor.  Garnished with sharp cheddar and croutons.  YUM!!

I made this tonight for dinner. Noticed the recipe did not call for salt which for some cooks is a given but for those who don't cook often, it's an important ingredient to leave out, since they tend to follow directions exactly. The same goes for the milk mixture- the author suggests a bechamel but doesn't tell folks how to make it properly.  Like many other reviewers, I used real butter instead of margarine to sweat my veggies and make my rue, used a combo of half and half and heavy cream for the bechamel for extra thickness. I also added the rest of the mild cheddar cheese I had to get rid of it which was about 1/4 cup, making a cheese sauce.  I did puree the broccoli but after incorporating the cheese sauce into the soup I added more broccoli florets to the soup and simmered covered  until tender, sirring occasionally for about 25 to 30 minutes.  Lastly, I added a touch of nutmeg to garnish for a punch of flavor.  The soup turned out really, really well. I've never made broccoli soup before and I chose this recipe for it's simplicity and east.  This recipe was a great starting point for me, which is why I rated it 4 stars.

Awesome recipe!  My whole family loved it, including my 13 year old son!  Sprinkle just a small amound of shredded cheese on top, and it's even better, though it's great even without the cheese!  It's so easy too.  I make it often because we all love it.

It took alot longer than the recipe said it would, but it was super tasty. However, if I make this again, I will probably cook the onion in olive oil to decrease the fat. I also added some chili flakes as suggested as well as a clove of garlic. Really good!

My daughter has informed me that this is her favourite soup.  So very quick and easy to make.  I substitute skim milk, use my Braun hand-held blender directly in my stock pot. No extra clean up required. Try adding some cheddar cheese. Wonderful!

This was super easy and everyone loved this for dinner with some bread on the side. I will be making this often! I did as other reviewers suggested and cooked the broccoli for 20 minutes and mashed the broccoli instead of blending it. The only note I have is that when you cook the broccoli in the stock for 20 minutes a lot of the stock evaporates. I had to add an extra can to compensate. Otherwise it was just broccoli mash.

i use olive oil instead of the margerine, and use fat free mocha mix instead of milk. Great soup, and very low calorie when use my subsitutions.

I used this recipe as an inspiration for my own broccoli soup: basically I just use about 5 potatoes, steam them with 1 or 2 broccolis, then cook them a bit in about 3 tbsp olive oil.  Then I add about 2 cups of chicken broth and a little bit of milk, season it with some salt, thicken it with a bit of flour, and tadaa.  Easiest soup ever.  Thanks for the idea. :)

I loved this soup too but because of what I had on hand, I had to make a few improvises.  I used 1/2 c 1% milk and the rest 1/2 and 1/2 to make the 2 cups of milk needed.  I put in a few shredded carrots for color.  I wanted to make it a cheesy broccoli soup too and so I added the  creamy cheese sauce from a macaroni and cheese box.  It worked out really well and I will figure out what to do with the mac's next time!  I thought it needed a little more broth so I added some more chicken stock but all in all it is a great addition to my soup recipes.

This was pretty good but it was missing something. The only change I made was I put 2 garlic cloves in the onion/celery mix. The broccoli did take about 25 minutes to become soft. Next time I will leave broccoli chunks also. I ate it with crackers cause it was a tad bit bland. Boyfriend thought it was fabulous!

Amazing!  I made this for dinner last night and it didn't last very long.  I guess I'll have to make 2 batches the next time which I don't mind because it was so easy to make.  As my daughter and I are vegetarians I made one change.  Instead of using 3 cups of chicken broth I used  2 vegetable boulion cubes and 3 cups of water. It really tasted great. Another positive about this is it partially covers 1 serving of vegetables and 1 serving of milk as outlined on the Food Requirements pyramid(depending on how much you eat). I'll be adding this to my recipe file.

This Soup was just delicious.My family loved it.I used  1 1/2 cup of milk and 1 cup of Half And Half milk.  I added 2 slices Velvetta Cheese to  the sauce.Next time I will use Sharp  Cheddar Cheese.I can't wait to eat this  soup for dinner.I will be making this  again.Its best to mix the flour and milk  in a seperate pan.I didn't puree the  Broccoli as the recipe stated.I like  the Broccoli to be chunky.I cant wait   to eat a bowl of soup for dinner.

This was delicious.  I added more celery (4 stalks) and two cloves of garlic.  I also used soy milk and used an immersion blender to blend the soup.

Yum!

This recipe took a lot of doctoring on my part before I was satisfied with it.  I followed the recipe but when I was finished I didn't think it had enough taste.  After I added an extra bullion cube, pepper and some crumbled bacon I felt it was pretty good.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I used butter instead of margerine and instead of blending I used a potato masher.  After mashing I added some chopped carrots (I really recommend this) and the soup was a little thinner than I hoped (probably because I used skim milk) so I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch, which I mixed with cold water before adding).  The roux really makes it for this one.  I will definately make it again!

A keeper.  Added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheeze and it was delish!  Thanks to a previous review, I knew to use a potato masher instead of getting the blender out.  We like it chunky better anyway.

I cut the recipe in half- was more than enough broccoli. I used fat free milk and it was still a nice thick soup from all the veggies pureed in it.

This soup was the best.  Tons of flavor.
I mashed the vegetables instead of puree
as we prefer the chunky texture.  Also I added a few slivers of carrots. YUM!

I was quite surprised at how little this recipe made but the flavor was wonderful. I added some more broccoli to give it a more chunky effect.

This is a great soup.  It's quite easy and fast, and very healthy.  Next time I'll follow some of the reviews and leave chunks of broccoli in the soup. By the way, I added some cheddar cheese, and it was good, but I think if your calorie concscious it isn't worth it because you have to put a lot of cheese in to be able to taste it.  It's good enough with out cheese.

I had to use chix boullion because i had no broth, and I added some velveta to the final product, but the recipe itself is a keeper.  I'll be using it again...Thanks.

I really liked this recipe, but we prefer to have chunks so we pureed only a portion of the vegetables.  Add some cheese soup to the mix for extra flavo and richness!

I added nutmeg and garlic.  Didn't have
chicken broth so used vegetable with a chicken bouillon cube.  Skipped the roux and mixed the flour in with the milk; left the broccoli in small pieces instead of doing the puree.  Much less effort overall and it's good soup.

This was a great soup, but I made a few adjustments. I used butter instead of margarine. Instead of flour/margarine roux, I mixed 2 tbsp. of cornstarch with broth before adding to pot. I substituted fat-free half and half for milk and added cheddar cheese. I pureed only half of mixture with hand blender.

06/20/16:  This continues to be my go to Broccoli soup recipe.  I do throw in all the broccoli parts, peeled stems, chopped leaves and I usually add more celery since we LOVE celery.  So easy and delicious.  We always love this soup.***
I have made this multiple times and it's always terrific.  USE BUTTER.  I keep mine in the freezer and chop/slice off what I need with a good knife.  I have used vidahlia, green and regular old onion and combos thereof---it's always yummy!  today I thought I'd be smart and add some shredded parmesan romano---nope, does not enhance the flavor and I pulled out the lumps of cheese with my whisk.  I also use the immersion blender and leave some good chunkiness as well.  I have made a vegetarian version by using veggie broth/stock with excellent results as long as you use that butter.  fresh and wonderful.

This is about the 3rd soup I have made. I made it for my mom while she was out painting. She came home to a house full of yummy smelling broccoli soup! This is great! I didn't even puree it. ( to lazy ) : ) It turned out great, and even my dad liked it! The only thing I would change is a little less broth so it's thicker in the long run. Otherwise the taste is really good! Its really easy too! I whipped it up fast!

I made the recipe as is but instead of the roux, I added a Jalapeno Cheddar flavored Maruchan Instant lunch, cooked it until it was thickened and then blended it with my hand-held blender. I then added additional milk until I got it to the consistency I wanted. It added a wonderful flavor and it was so easy!  Next time I might try it with a macaroni and cheese packet without the noodles.

Good soup! Used 16 oz. bag frozen baby broccoli florets, vanilla soy milk (it was all I had) instead of regular milk, added a pinch of nutmeg and a cup of velvetta cheese. My husband made several trips back to the kitchen for more. Thanks for the recipe. I never substituted ingredients or added to a recipe until I started reading reviews on this website. What fun!

This is a really great soup, although I did add about 8oz. of Velveeta to mine(my family likes cheese)I would have liked it either way. This is good enough to serve to company. Thanks for a great recipe!

While I appreciate how healthy this is, it was very bland.  I dressed it up with cheddar and parmesean cheese, garlic, and more milk and cornstarch, and it was still OK at best.

This soup was FABULOUS!! I even left out the flour and the last 3 tablespoons of butter, and it was perfectly creamy and flavorful, and a little better for you. Top with grated chedder, and you will find yourself one happy camper.

Pretty darn good. I simmered the broccoli for about 20-30 minutes though.  I also used the steams of the broccoli as well, since it adds more flavour than just the florets.

Lovely soup and very easy to make.  I did boil the broccoli for 10 minutes and then turned off the burner and left to go to gym.  Came home and blended it, and make the roux in a separate pot and then added it to the broccoli.  Makes a nice simple soup.

I love this soup. It does take more than 10 mins of simmering as others mentioned in their review. More like 20 mins. I put 2 stalks celery, 2 onions and 6 cloves chopped garlic. I browned the roux stirring with a whisk and added skim milk slowly and brought to  a bowl stirring frequently! I also added about 2 tblsp of course ground pepper to roux and let sim while using the stick blender to coarsely chop up the broccoli so more texture. Then stirred roux and poured into soup, brought to boil again and turned it off to let stand for 10 mins for flavours to blend. Delicious! No left overs for this simple, inexpensive soup!

First time making this recipe and I did a lot of other reviewer's suggestions. Came out perfect. I love the idea of making this in my electric power cooker as it browns and cooks the broccoli in one container and is big enough to add the sauce mixture to it. Using a potato masher is the way to go for consistency that still gives you broccoli chunks. I used the whole quart of chicken broth rather than 3 cups. I also added 1 c. extra sharp cheese shredded and made the white sauce with 1 c 1/2 and 1/2 with 1 c. milk. Added 1/4 tsp.nutmeg, 2 pinches of cayenne pepper, a 1/4 tsp blended pink salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. This is a keeper and will go into my regular rotation. Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

Delicious! I added more broccoli - I used two 5 Cup Trader Joe's bags, and only had to adjust the milk. I used coconut milk and it came out delicious.

Was Looking For A Soup That Hit Home, This One Did Just That. A Little On The Grainy Side But Nothing A Little Extra Blending Couldn't Fix. I Substituted The White Sauce With Some Heavy Cream & It Worked Perfectly! LOVED This Recipe, Recommended It To A Friend, Definitely Will Be A Recipe I Make Again.

I made a half recipe.  I ended up adding about a cup plus of chicken broth since a lot of it simmered away.  I also used skim milk.  I added the white sauce to the broccoli mixture and used a stick blender to puree it.  Came out really good.  I'm on Weight watchers.  This soup with whole milk is 8 points with skim only 6 points.  Great lunch.

This is a great recipe. You can use any vegetable, with or without pureeing. I also added a little brown rice for additional body.

Love this soup, but I do it slightly different that appeals more to my taste.  I don't include celery as I don't usually buy it.  I sweat the onions in butter along with the broccoli stalks cut into coin-sized pieces.  In a separate pot I lightly steam the broccoli florets until just done and shock in cold water to set that beautiful green color.  I puree the onion and broccoli stalks and then create the cream part.  Once that soup is done I add  the florets.  I like having hearty chunks of broccoli with the soup.  This soup is fantastic.  Thanks for sharing it.

Followed previous recommendations and used a potato masher instead of  a blender- nice and chunky. Used 3 carrots chopped and 2 cloves of garlic minced. Used 2 cups of whole milk plus 1/2 cup of half and half. Adding grated Boars Head Canadian Cheddar on top and garlic croutons made it scrumptious

It's a great base recipe! I made it with a combo of broccoli and cauliflower because I had a bunch left after a fondue party.  I used a bit of Sargento Italian shredded cheese mix (about a 1/2c) and added about 1-2tsp minced garlic to the onion/celery, otherwise I did the recipe as-is. Seasoned at the end with salt/pepper and it is YUMMY! (I also had cooked bratwurst leftover from the fondue party that I think I'll chop up and put in my son and husband's soup so they will eat it; otherwise they'll probably pass on the soup because it is all vegetables!)

I made this almost as written and it was so easy and GOOD! Broccoli was from my garden - I used stalks and (some) leaves and it was great. I had a little leftover heavy cream so I used about 1/3 cream, 2/3 1% milk.  All 1% would have been fine. Added sauteed garlic too but couldn't tell whether that made any difference. Also took out some of the broccoli after a few seconds of stick blending and added it back at the end to make it chunkier. Cooked it for closer to 30 minutes (probably needed to because of all the stalks in there). I needed to add some water at the end - it was very thick - but maybe I used a bit too much broccoli. I'm not used to making a roux so I was very careful to stir it like crazy and it never lumped up. We had some shredded cheese - the kind we use on chili - and plopped that on top which was a nice addition but not crucial.  This was a real winner!  And it's healthy and can be vegetarian. I will surely make this again!

Wonderful recipe. I had to tweak simply because I didn't have celery on hand and wanted to add just a touch more flavour. I used broccoli and onions from my garden, and I sauteed up about 4 cloves of garlic with the onion. I also seasoned the soup as it was simmering with McCormick Vegetable Seasoning Paprika and white pepper. Hubby wanted cheese added, but once we tasted the finished product, decided to forgo that and enjoy the wonderful flavour it had already achieved.

I am a "taste cook" and was looking for a basic recipe that I could use to make and freeze in individual servings to substitute for heavy dinner meals during the steamy hot summer nights(mug-o-soup-broccoli doesn't have to be piping hot to enjoy, just warm and tasty)  going to low-carb this one by omitting flour and milk, use the butter to sautee the onion, use more chicken stock & chicken bullion (Knorr large cubes, one at a time until I get that rich flavor), cook the broccoli a little longer, pulse blend instead of puree and then "tighten" it with heavy cream to desired consistency. Add some variety to individual servings by using bacon pieces, shredded cheddar cheese or parm cheese, sprinkling of nutmeg or cinnamon  or maybe all of the above.

Great recipe! I made it vegetarian by substituting veggie broth and used almond milk (what I had on hand) instead of regular milk. I also had to simmer about 5 minutes longer to soften the broccoli. So tasty, my 8 year old asked for seconds!

Holy Moly this is fantastic!   I was working on some things and then noticed it had gotten pretty late, so I needed to find a quick recipe for some type of broccoli soup that wouldn't take over an hour.  I found this recipe and it was quick as well as delicious.  My teenager loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!  Also, I didn't have celery or bouillon (I would have used vegetarian instead of chicken) and just used water.  Still awesome!

Updated: I had made the yummy soup but the next day wasn't in the mood for soup. So, I made Rice and ten added a cup of the soup and some cheese. Delicious broccoli cheese rice

This turned out great although I did alter the recipe a bit. I added one Tbsp of flour to the onions and worked it in completely before adding 2 Cups of broth and 1 Cup of water. I also used all parts of the broccoli, chopped well and cooked for about 30 mins in the broth mixture. For the sauce, I still used 3 Tbsp of flour and added about 1/2 cup of sharp grated cheddar and about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. Before mixing in the sauce I used a hand blender to lightly puree some of the broccoli chunks. I also used chopped up crispy bacon as a garnish in the bowls. It was delicious and my hubby loved it too! Highly recommend!

This soup is excellent!  I followed some of the other suggestions, and replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with heavy cream.  I used a potato masher instead of a blender, and the consistency was perfect.  I also sprinkled a small amount of grated medium cheddar cheese on top.

This was really good. It is a pet peeve of mine when people rate a recipe and then tell you all the changes they made. I tried this exact to the recipe and took it to a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it. I will probably make some changes next time because I like to experiment but you definitely don't have too.

Excellent soup!  I made this for the first time with only a few modifications, including adding a touch of salt and substituting boccolini for broccoli.  I also processed the onion and celery first with a food processor, then also processed the broccolini to small bits to speed up the cooking time a bit (though cooking it does take a bit longer than 10 minutes).  Using an immersion blender gave it a nice texture with little bits, and certainly avoided the overly processed effects of a blender.  I'll definitely make this again!

I have a hard time following recipes I rather look them up and make it my way it usually works out better for me 

With this one I only had a small amount of fresh broccoli left so I used my steamer and made my own veg. Stock 
With all the herbs , a couple of carrots, celery , scallions then removed  vegs 
 I used just enough to make broccoli wett with broth then puréed it up 
I made a rue added some milk and cheddar cheese to it then mixed it altogether 
A healthily little treat with extra cheese on top!

I made this just as the recipe calls.  Next time I will use half and half or part half and half.  It was missing something.  It was edible, just a little weak.  I think when I re-heat it I will melt some cheese into it to give it a richer-creamier flavor.

i had a friend give me quite a bit of broccoli, as her hubby works in the fields here. so i looked up some recipes here for broccoli. i liked this one because everyone who tried it had good reviews and suggestions as to make it better. here's mine: i grilled 1/2 an onion with two cloves of garlic in imperial margarine. added two stalks of celery, chopped, til you could put a fork in them added four crowns of broccoli and the stalks, cut up and did the same. meanwhile i put four cups of water in a pan with chicken bullion to a boil. added the broccoli and fixens, simmered 20 min. then melted 2 tablespoons margarine, added 4 &1/2 tablespoons flour, then added 1 cup 1% milk til thick. added that  and ground pepper and salt to taste and continued simmering til dinner was ready, bout an hour. i made steamed broccoli with melted cheese just in case they didnt like it, but to my amazement they ate it all and had seconds on the soup, yay! i will make it again!!!! and it was so simple!!!!!!! ty!

Delicious as a stand alone or as a starting point, it just needs a bit more salt.

Try adding about 12 ozs sliced mushrooms to the saute, and add about 12-16 ozs of fried bacon to the final product.

This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was perfect for someone just beginning to cook. As an avid gardener, I had a lot of frozen broccoli to use before the new crop comes in. Seeing how this one had 805 reviews there was no question on which to try. At the end I just felt there was something minor missing. What goes with cream of broccoli soup? Cheese! I added some grated cheddar and Turkey bacon crumbs and they were the missing ingredients for me anyway. My wife was thrilled to have a nice bowl of soup after a long and stressful day. Thanks to the submitter for sharing.

Absolutely loved it and so easy to make. I used fat free half&half in place of the milk for a richer flavor I added a little ground red pepper only because I like my foods a little spicy and a bit of nutmeg tuned out wonderful.

Yummy!  Used the potato masher which was perfect.  Took about 20 minutes for my broccoli to cook down.  I added a shredded carrot for color, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  Also added 1 1/2 cups lowfat shredded cheese and used skim milk.  Made a good eight cups total.

Delicious! I was looking for a low sodium recipe and this is it! The only thing different was I added half of a carrot to the onions, celery and broccoli as it cooked. Used 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup half and half cream, and added 1 cup mild cheddar cheese at the end. I wanted to leave a few chucks of broccoli but puréed a little to long. Oh well, next time, but this is defiantly a "make again" soup!! I added homemade croutons on top when served! Thanks!!

Just made this tonight and it is really good; although I did tweet it a little sorry.  I added two potatoes peeled and chopped into small junks with the broccoli just because I like this type of soup thicker.  I also added a small handful of chopped cooked bacon and some cheddar cheese at the end after I had added the milk mixture.  Used a potato masher instead of a blender to keep some of the chuckiness of the soup.  Will be making again thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe as posted, found it to be OK, tweaked it some and liked it a lot more.
My variations:
1. Melt all 5 T butter called for, saute celery and onion, add flour, make a roux and cook gently till veggies are tender and the roux is light golden. (This step adds more work but takes away the flour taste other cooks noticed.)
2. Add broth and cook till thick. Then add broccoli and simmer till tender but not overdone. 
3. Add milk and bring just  to a simmer. Put 1/4 to 1/3 of soup through blender and return the blenderized soup to the remainder. This is for people who like creamy soups that are still chunky.
4. For spicier soup: add Spike, chili powder and/or garlic.
5. For richer soup: stir in 2 cups shredded cheese at the end. I usually use sharp cheddar.
I have tried all these variations and usually use them all.

Good soup!  I added garlic, used frozen broccoli and potato masher to break up the broccoli instead of pureeing. I added sharp cheddar and crumbled bacon at the end to it. My husband and 5 year old ate it all. The 3 year old snubbed it since it had green things in it , but overall great soup and I will make again.

Good recipe. I doubled it. Added 2 cloves garlic, 2 carrots, 8 ounces chopped mushrooms,  1 tbl fresh parsley and 1 tsp tarragon. Cooked down onions, celery 
and carrots first then added mushrooms, garlic and spices with one cup of broth. In seperate pot cooked down the broccoli in the rest of the broth and added half of that to onion mix and pureed. Using a potatoe masher mashed remaining broccoli and added that. I needed very little white sauce to thicken the soup cooking it this way. Turned out great.

I needed to go ahead and cook some fresh broccoli I had in the frig, so this was the recipe of choice. I used FF chicken broth, skim milk, a few stems to make up the amount of broccoli needed, and a sprinkle of salt. My immersion blender was perfect for the job (so glad I bought it when it was on sale). It made a nice low-cal lunch chock full of veggies.

Wasn't the greatest.  Had to add cheese and crumbled bacon to our bowls to make it sort of good.  Will not make again.

Delish - I puree half and leave the other half unpureed - that way it's creamy but still has lots of yummy broccoli pieces!

Yummy! My 3-year old gave it two thumbs up :) I replaced the milk with heavy cream and used a potato masher to mash the broccoli. I think it would have been a 6 star dish with some bacon. I would have tried it if I had had some in the house...next time!

I added grated carrot and garlic to the roux. Then used half and half instead of milk.  I,too, like chunky soup so I just mashed with a potato masher.

I was really excited to make this soup. My sister had an endoscopy on her throat today and I wanted to make something for her to eat that wouldn't hurt going down in case her throat was sore. She enjoyed it very much but I didn't. I will try it again though and give it another shot.

I used a potato masher to make a chunkier soup per others reviews.  I also used skim milk since I feel whole milk or cream are a complete waste of calories in soup.  That said, while good, this soup tasted just a little too healthy to satisfy me as a meal.  So when I reheated the leftovers I grated a whole 8 oz block of moterey jack cheese into it.  Voila!  5 stars.

This is a good basic cream of broccoli soup.  We did enjoy it.  I stayed true to the recipe except for the celery which I omitted.  Be aware that this makes a very thick soup.  I needed to thin it out a bit with additional chicken stock for our taste.  I will make it again I'm sure.

well, i always change things up to make it 5 star for my family. so here is my take on this fine basic soup recipe! first, i used finely sliced veggies: 3 celery ribs, 5 garlic cloves, and 1/2 of a vidalia onion in the saute, then added 8 oz of finely sliced crimini mushrooms. after 5-10 minutes on low, i added 4 cups of homemade chicken broth, 1 red potato with skin on, and broccoli stems, both finely minced. brought to a boil, lowered to a simmer and after 10 minutes used a potato masher to squish the veggies up a bit. then i added chopped broccoli florets and simmered for 10 minutes. i let this all sit, while i made the roux. i put 1 can of fat-free evaporated milk at room temp, with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a bottle and shook it like crazy until it was mixed up. added it to the veggie pan, and turned the heat back to low. very slowly the sauce thickened. i had to add a bit more chicken broth to keep it from getting too thick, stirring all the while. i let this cool and stuck it in the frig for the night. the next day, i put this in my slow cooker crock on low and let it heat up slowly. right before serving, i added 2 cups of extra sharp shredded cheese and the spices. the spices i used were very simple and you need to use what you think is best: we like 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of cumin, kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper and place hot sauces and chopped fresh jalapenos on the table for individual taste. great with cornbread! thanks for the good basic!

Mine turned out similar to Panera Bread soup without the cheese. I chopped up the broccoli and used a potato masher, and added small pieces of carrots, plus lots of pepper, garlic and Alpine Touch seasoning (from Montana), with a sprinkle of parmesan on top. My soup didn't get as thick as I would have liked but it had a very good taste with the extra seasonings. My hubby even ate a full bowl!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I tweaked it with some additional veggies (carrot, garlic & extra celery), since broccoli is pricey where we are located. It resulted in a tasty soup with a lovely consistency.  My children adored it!

This is great! I couldn't believe the broccoli was really soft after only 10 minutes! I added some carrots with the broccoli because I had 3 to use up. I used a 32 oz (4 c.) container of chicken broth instead of 3. I cut up about 4 medium heads of broccoli, and that was plenty. I also used 1 %milk to make it healthier, and the roux still thickened well. Very good!

Sorry, I didn't care for this.  I made as written except mashed it with potato masher versus using a blender.  I found it to be very watery.  Decided to try to save it and added several cups of sharp cheddar.  Still not what I was hoping for.  We ate very little of this.

Excellent for sure, we loved the rich flavour with these simple ingredients. I make this often on the weekend to have on hand during the week. I highly recommend adding 4 cloves diced garlic, two small potatoes (2 kinds) and a leek. I pulse instead of blending, keeping some chunks in there for all that goodness.

Decent soup to some in the family but I really didn't care for it. Took a lot longer than 35 minutes to make. It was easy, but time consuming. Dirtied a lot of dishes. If I were to do it again, and I had "helper hands", I would have the flour mixture cooking soon after starting the broth mixture to cut down on the time. But, I don't think I will do this one again.

Delicious! I first made it chunky w/o blending it up but b/c the leftovers got really mushy I used the blender. As suggested by another reviewer, I added some bacon pieces and parmesean cheese to top it off. Will definitely make again! My boyfriend who hates veggies, thought it tasted really good.

This is really simple to make and doesn't take many ingredients. I altered the recipe by adding carrot instead of celery and mashing the broccoli instead of pureeing it.

I used the Immersion blender because I like to have some broccoli pieces in the soup.  This soup recipe is easy and delicious!

Simply amazing. I do not put in blender either - as many others have said. I did not have celery this time, so omitted it. No difference with or without. use a sweet onion. Otherwise, everything is perfect! Serve with crusty bread! yum

added garlic and didn't blend until smooth as we like the chunks. Next time will try some bacon and maybe some cream cheese/cream but it was totally yum just as it is :)

This is a great recipe. I did lightly puree the cooked veggies, since the stems didn't soften enough to mash as some suggested.  I mase two additions that only improved the recipe. I added a couple of pinches of turbinado sugar, and a bay leaf for the last 10 minutes of simmer after adding the roux. The bay leaf imparted a nice floral undertone that really rounded out the soup's flavor.  Don't expect this to be a thick soup. It is thin without being watery. I don't like super-thick soups, so this was perfect.

"Best broccoli soup I've ever had!" my husband said.  Sound like 5 starts to me!  I diced 1 potato instead of the celery and I added garlic in with the onions.  Used a potato masher instead of blending it and skim milk.  I had to thicken it at the end a little with cornstarch/water blend, but that's probably because of using skim milk.  It was fantastic!

Great soup recipe - very fast and easy.  I had low-sodium broth, so I added a little extra salt at the end to taste.  Definitely use a stick blender if you have one - it works wonders!

Two thumbs up for this recipe. I followed the recipe with the exception of the puree step. My family likes the onions and celery pureed but not the broccoli so I just picked out several pieces of broccoli before pouring it in the blender. To serve I used the suggestion from one reviewer and sprinkled parmesan on top. I will definitely make this soup again. Thank you Jessie:)

Delish! Used green onions and added a clove of minced garlic. Skim milk worked great for us. I also used a potato masher instead of a blender. Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was amazing! I took a little bit of everybody's advice as far as processing the soup.  I used a blender on the onion, celery, a third of the broccoli, and about half the broth.  I mashed another third of the broccoli with a potato masher, threw that in along with the remaining broth.  And left the last third of the broccoli in chunks. Turned out fantastic.  I sprinkled a little parmesan on top before serving and made a turkey sandwich on french bread to go with it. Simple and DELICIOUS!!

I had to use chicken bullion in water instead of broth for this recipe, and it was still fabulous. I added some thyme in at the end. This soup is creamy and tasty without being too rich. My family loved it... and we ate it with french bread. 
Yum! I will make this again!

Didn't know it could be so good. I usually like heavy seasonings and spices - especially in soups - but this one is excellent in simplistic form. Perfect for a bread bowl!

I totally cheated on this recipe and it was so easy and yummy. I bought a 1lb bag of frozen chopped broccoli and 1lb of florets and added it to the boiling chicken stock. In the smaller saucepan I sauteed the onions (omitted the celery) added lour then milk and added to the soup pot. I used the seasoning my family likes and everyone loved it.

This is the first time I have made broccoli soup without cream and was delighted it tasted just as good if not better.  Less calories, healthier, and tastes better - who knew?  I had used frozen chopped broccoli because I had an abundance of frozen broccoli in my freezer.   We all thought it was great.

This was just ok for me.  I liked that it was simple and filled with tons of veggies but it just wasn't something that I am going to crave.  I used skim milk and I wonder if it would have been better with half cream/half milk or whole milk.

Prepared as presented and blended everything like mad!!!!  (MOther had dental surgery).  Good and nutrious.  Revised this ONCE again as my Mother is in ill health. Did mostly brocolli but did add cauliflour to make the mandatory veggies and added cheese to the flour/milk sauce and blended like mad!!  Did add some garlic this time, very good and perked Mother up!!!

This is a quick and delicious soup. Instead of pureeing everything after it was cooked (and because I like a chunkier soup), I used my chopper to cut up the onions and broccoli (they were quite fine). After following the recipe as written, I added some cooked ham to the soup at the very end - it was just what the soup needed. I will definitely be making this soup again!

Very Good - just made a double batch for the first time on this cold wintry day and the guys just loved it! Didn't cream the broccoli because I like a more chunky soup. Added some shredded sharp cheese and yum!!!  Definitely will make this again!  Possibly for the lenten soup suppers that are here.  Enjoyable, very tasty!!

Delicious!!  Used frozen broccoli florets and used a potato masher instead of blender. Added freshly grated parmesan cheese to soup before serving.

I picked this recipe because I love cream of broccoli soup and it looked easy. Well it certainly was easy but it wasn't that "Campbells" or restaurant taste I was looking for. It was healthy, edible and probably meant to be how real cream of broccoli sans all the preservatives, ect. should taste

Very good broccoli soup recipe.  I made it just like it says in the recipe, and it was perfect.  I would suggest doubling it if you can, because you will want leftovers.

Delicious, but only after I spiced it up a bit.  I added salt and pepper to taste, then I decided to add curry as an interesting addition.  Wonderful!!     Also, in the saucepan the butter and flour should be made into a rue before adding the milk and cooking until thickened instead of all three added at once to the saucepan as the recipe indicates.    Freezes well in small quantities.

I am not sure why everyone gives this recipe 5 stars and then go on to tell us how they changed the recipe!! Anyway, my family thought this soup was edible but not great.  It was rather bland.  I have a great cauliflower soup that I think I will just make with broccoli instead. Recommend NOT pureeing this soup or maybe just half of it.

Excellent cream of broccoli soup. I didn't use as much milk (only 1/2 c), and used water instead of chicken stock, came out great. You can also add other veggies which I will do next time.

I tried this out, because I ADORE the Cream of Broccoli soup at a local restaurant, but I just can't justify going there daily (plus, the menu tempts me with onion rings and their specialty burgers - yum!). I've made this twice now, and it's much better with some adjustments. I add about 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the onion and celery, and I saute them in a separate pan. I threw the broccoli in with three cups of water and three bullion cubes. It makes it easier to separate the broccoli later. I like to leave a little less than half of the broccoli chunky and put the rest through a light chopping in the blender. The blender is fine as long as you don't go crazy with it! With the roux, I only used 1 cup milk and the rest was heavy cream. I tossed 1 cup of sharp cheddar into the white sauce. I wound up adding about 1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream later on to the soup, because it just wasn't thick enough. I then added 1 more cup of sharp cheddar, smashed 1TB butter with 1TB flour, whisked that with some of the broth, so it wouldn't make floury chunks in my soup. I simmered the whole thing, covered for 20-30 minutes. It thickened up just the way I like it! 1 1/2-2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and about 1/4 tsp nutmeg rounded it off nicely. Whew! I know that's a lot. It's not the same as my favorite, but it's really, REALLY close to the real deal.

Good recipe, but I like it thicker, chunkier, and greener.  The second time I made it, I made a few modifications.  I used both stalks and florets, but put only the stalks in the blender.  This made for a creamier texture without using cream.  I had some frozen spinach which I thawed and put in the blender also.  This made it much greener and added some extra flavor.  At the end, I added a couple of teaspoons of nutmeg.  This will be one I will make over and over again.

Used a bag of frozen broccoli and frozen bag of asparagus stir fry.  Also added a tsp of parsley.  Added a 1/2 of 4 blend cheese at the end of cooking. Very delicious and will make again.

This one was tricky to rate. I say 4, husband says 3. I'm going with 4 because I think he's just being difficult because there's no cheese or hot pepper in this one. This was easy to do and I thought it was tasty, but I doubled the onion and also added garlic (about 4 cloves, minced). I also had to add extra salt, and I garnished with real bacon bits. (Not sure if it needed those, but I always garnish veggie soups with bacon bits. It helps the veggies go down with less complaints.) Thanks for the recipe!

Very good base. It was a little bland. The second day, after resting in the fridge, it tasted better. I also added some cheddar cheese to the soup the following day and that was very good.

I only gave this 4 stars because I made a couple of changes to the original recipe. I used 2 cans of chicken broth which was about 4 cups. I also added one cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese to the flour/butter/milk mixture before it was added to the broccoli pot. I seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of cayenne. In my opinion, this way is 5 stars!

The soup is absolutely wonderful, my husband and I love this recipe. It is very simple, yet so delicious.  I came accross this recipe because I had leftover broccoli steamers (microwavable bag of veggies) and I wanted to use them in an effort to be resourceful and I am so glad I did! I have since doubled the recipe to 12 servings so we can freeze some and have for lunch on a cold winters day... it is surprisingly soooo good!!!! Thanks for this recipe!!!!

Delicious soup!  So easy and cheap.  I used frozen broccoli and made it in the crockpot with just a few changes.  I added the onions and celery and a bit of butter to the crock, then added the frozen broccoli and 5 cups of water and 5 bullion cubes on high for 4 hours.   I added a bit of flour mixed with some water in the last hour of cooking.   I added the extra water because I didn't have milk in the house.    Instead I simply added a small container of cream cheese in the last 30 minutes.  Used a masher and it was done.  Will make this again!  It's so simple.  

ETA:  I've made this a few more times and half the time forget to even put the flour in.  I think it's thick enough without out.  Especially if you take some out and blend it up.  I've also added garlic as suggested by a few people.  You could also add a lot more veggies to sneak in if you wanted to.  Carrots are great in this!

A very good soup with good flavor.  A nice way to get more vegetables in one's diet.  When in the mood for broccoli cheese soup, I added 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.

Really good.  Easier than I thought it would be to make a really good, rich soup.  Have made twice and have found I need additional liquid and have thrown in about 1.5 cups of water.  Also, you can use olive oil in first step if you want to use less butter.

Ok, I think I needed to blend the broccoli more to be smoother and cream would make it a little richer.

Very good recipe.  This was my first attempt at making cream of broccoli soup, and so I made it exactly as written to start with, but found it to be not substantial enough.  So I added about 2 cups additional broccoli florets at the very end and let them simmer in the soup until cooked but still somewhat firm to the bite, and then it was perfect for my taste and for my fiancee (we are both broccoli lovers).  Thanks for this recipe!

I never follow a recipe. This is a good base recipe- to follow. I just made this soup and I  used fresh and  frozen cut up broccoi-- about  7 to 8 cups to  in 3 cups chicken broth.I  added a huge garlic clove, celery and onion chunks.  I remove  these with  chunks of broccoli and purreed and put back with rest  of liquid and broccoli chunks left in the pot.  I added  1 1/2 cups of milk  ( used fat free creamer and 1% milk), 3T butter, 1/2 t. thyme paprika and worschestshire sauce , about 1 to 1/1/2 cups shredded  cheese   (a mixture of Italian cheeses and cheddar) --- I  did not use any flour....it was already thick enough and it tastes  delicous.

Awesome soup!  This was my first attempt at a cream soup and this recipe was nice and easy to follow for a beginner.  I followed what another poster mentioned and used the entire broccoli instead of just the florets (why not?!) as well as using a Vidalia onion instead and I let it simmer for 20 mins.  I also just mashed it using a potato masher instead of pureeing it and I prefer this texture.  I added a little cream at the end as we prefer rich soups.  Very yummy.  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks.

Loved it! I took the other reviews into consideration and mashed the broccoli with the potato masher instead of using the blender and I'm soooo glad I did. I thickened it up a little more with an extra can of cream of broccoli soup I had on hand and 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.

Amazingly quick, easy, and yummy recipe. After making this a couple of times, I've realized you can supplement quite a few different vegetables into this instead of just broccoli.  The first time I made this, I didn't have enough broccoli in the fridge, so I supplemented it with a bit of cabbage and it still turned out tasting great. I also used a bit less butter in the beginning and used half milk/half cream to make the soup a bit richer.  The soup turned out to be fairly bland, so I ended up putting a fair amount of salt to taste, but overall a very yummy soup.

We loved this! My changes: More celery, didn't puree (just mashed with potato masher), added potato flakes to thicken, and added some cheddar cheese. Simply delicious! One note - I did add a pinch of nutmeg like one reviewer suggested, and we did not like that, so I wouldn't recommend that. Definitely a keeper!

Great soup! I also prefer just mashing with a potato masher. Also doubled the celery. It's refreshing to have an alternative to the typical cheesy broccoli soup.

Yes, I would give this a four, four and a half if I could! The only thing I did different is I used a fourth of red onion ( did not feel like peeling a whole onion and red onion was on hand ) came out...it took me a few bites to figure it out but it's almost a velvety texture to it, some florets stayed in shape but it was still so smooth down your throat! Now my soup came out a darker green than this picture on the site. But all the same, a good soup to have on the week of Saint Patrick's! Thanks you to the cook of this soup.

Fantastic and so easy! I followed other reviews and used 1 cup milk and 1 cup light cream, used two stalks of celery and not only the florets of the broccoli but the stalks as well, and a splash of dry white wine while the veggies were getting tender.  I also only pureed 1/2 of the veggie mix and mashed the other 1/2 in the pan with a potato masher, the result was a great consistency that wasn't too chunky or too smooth.  My 3 year old daughter gobbled it up!!!  This will become a staple for sure in our house.

This is the simple recipe like my Mom use to make.  I don't puree mine, I just use a potato masher as I like a chunkier soup.  Simple, fast, and very tasty.  Adding cheddar cheese is a plus.

Yummy!  As a vegetarian, I used organic mushroom broth.  I added one large potato when adding the broccoli.  I didn't used just the florets, but the whole thing.  Since I didn't have any celery, I added some celery seed.  I also added a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Croutons are a must!  Perfect for this snowy day!

This soup was so simple to make and very tasty.  I made a few changes in the recipe because I am a vegan.  First, I used fresh broccoli and steamed it.  I sauteed garlic along with the onions and celery.  I used two stalks of celery.  Used a vegan chicken-like broth.  And finally, made a heavy cream by blending cashews and water which I added to the recipe in place of the milk & flour.    It was wonderful.  This recipe is a real keeper!

Good soup- I added garlic powder, freshly ground pepper and nutmeg per other reviewer suggestions. I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar before serving and mixed to melt it into the soup. Healthy and good for a cold night.

I followed other people's suggestion to mash the broccoli with a potato masher and that worked really well. The consistency of the soup was good but it was really, really bland. I tried adding a pinch of nutmeg and some salt and pepper but it was still pasty.

This is a great recipe base.  For my taste though, it is a bit bland.  To zip things up, I added cayene pepper, cracked black pepper, and 3 cloves of garlic.  Also, instead of pureeing the whole soup, I picked out most of the florettes and pureed what was left- the onions and garlic.  The end result is both tasty and appealing to the eye.

I left the broccoli in the chicken broth boiling for about 25 minutes. There is no need to puree as the broccoli sort of melts/crumbles on its own after boiling for that long. If you like it a little chunkier, then I would let it boil for at least 15 min.  I would not "puree" the broccoli.  I thought it was a really good soup

I wish I'd have read the review for the tip about not using the blender. It was kind of a wierd texture. I added a bit more flavor because as is it was bland but once I used some garlic salt, and a couple cups of cheese my family ate it. Next time I will just cut my broccoli up really fine before I start and not use the blender and it will be even better.

I gave it 4 stars because I feel I might have gone wrong in making this.  Instead of chopping the onion, I grinded it too small, possibly leading to the onion dominating the flavor  because it tasted like onion soup.  Otherwise I was very impressed with the texture without having to use cream like the other recipes, thereby adding extra fat.

Great recipe! I used beef stock instead of chicken stock - I had started making this to realize that my husband had used the last box of chicken stock - but it still turned out great. I served it with a dollop of sour cream in the middle, and some Parmesan cheese shavings. Definitely one for the recipe box.

Not sure if this would still be 5 stars made as is but with my changes it was delicious.  -- Used about 12 cups broccoli -- Added 1 large finely grated carrot and 3 coarsely chopped cloves of garlic when onion/celery was almost done; cooked for 3--4 more mins -- Used Rapunzel vegetable w/ sea salt bouillon instead of chicken broth -- Mashed with potato masher before adding milk/cream -- Substituted 1 cup of light cream for one of the cups of milk -- Stirred in about 3/4 cup finely shredded cheddar before serving, and also topped each bowl with a tablespoon of cheese

I don't know if the best part of this soup is it's wonderful flavor, how easy it is to make it, or how healthy it is, but it certainly is all of the above!  I have used this recipe and used half broccoli and half cauliflower as well and either way, it always turns out just great.  Highly recommended.

Just made this for dinner last night.  i followed the recipe exactly as written. Used butter (notice the difference between ingredients and directions).  The only change i made was I used a hand mixer to puree it instead of a food processor.  It was delicious and hubby said the recipe was a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good.  I did use butter in place of margarine and held out 1/2 cup of flowets until I had pureeed the stock. Just a preference to have some larger pieces in the soup.  I did add about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarrella, because that is what I had but will use cheddar next time.  I thought is was a little bland so I did add some garlic powder to it and felt it was excellent after that small addition.  Thanks for another keeper.

Can't go wrong with this one!  My son has been eating this since I first introduced "real" food! For those of you who cook in batches, this freezes very well! I do use butter.  I prefer the consistancy of this soup best when I use a potato masher.

Awesome thanks! We grow a lot of our own veg and even when I'm careful about blanching & freezing - broc & cauli never are as good as fresh. Now... I'm going to make this soup with them instead! My tweaks - used 1/2 broc 1/2 cauli - butter instead of marg - 1/4 cup diced cheddar per cup of milk - and I used 1/2 cream 1/2 milk. I used my old wand blender thingy to zap it down to a coarse chop before adding cheese sauce. Yumma!

Loved it! Sooo easy! I added 2 cloves garlic to celery and onions. Also, added more broth. I blended with an immersion hand blender to create a creamy soup. Be sure to season with plenty of pepper.  Great with grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but added a clove of minced garlic and a pinch of nutmeg per other reviewers.  I'd thought we'd need to add cheese at the end but it was so good we just ate it without.

I added garlic and simmered for between 20 and 30 minutes.  I enjoyed this and it tasted especially good topped with cheddar, but some flavor was missing and I'm not sure what.

Very tasty recipe!  Minor changes based on other's input:  added 2 stalks of celery; used fat free half-n-half (eliminates lots of fat); added a handful of bacon bits; chopped with potato masher.  Instead of chicken broth, I used 3 cups of water and 4 tsp of bullion (cheaper).  Definately a keeper!

Delicious, even with frozen broccoli I also used evaporated milk, because halfway thru the recipe I discovered that's all I had. Four stars because it needed a big handful of CHEESE!

I made a variation of this tonight and subbed Silk Unsweetened soy milk(added couple tablespoons of flour for thickening). Kept the broccoli in larger chunks. It is a keeper! I would have tried olive oil to sautee onions and celery, if I was not out of it.

Made this for friends while we were vacationing in central Oregon.  It was incredible!  Don't blend this - it's so much better with the texture.  I even prefer it over the cheesy version of this soup! And it's good with fat free half-half!

This is the "BEST CREAM OF BROCCOLI SOUP"!!! I've tried many & this time my family scraped the pot clean!  They loved it!  The only thing I didn't do was puree the soup.

I just couldn't get the right taste for my palate after initially making this, tasting it, then modifying it. I finally succumbed to adding Velvetta. ***UPDATE*** Made my own chicken broth and the flavor is even better! Would like to try a creamier version next time.

It's true - believe what you hear. This is a great recipe. I browned a little bacon in the bottom of the stock pot to brown the onion and celery in the drippings, added my own stock, simmered broccoli for 20 minutes, mashed broccoli with a fork (not too aggressively) and added a little shredded cheese to the roux before adding it to the soup. turned out absolutely delicious.  added crumbled bacon to the top - really good.

This was a very simple and yummy start...but we felt like it needed to be thicker to stand on its own...we'll be adding some instant potato flakes for a little extra flavor and thickening next time.  Thanks!

Great flavor - I diced up 3 med. size potatoes and added them till tender then I mixed in the flour and milk mixer. Also I used frozen chopped broccoli, by the time I was finished with the soup all broccoli had fallen apart so I didn't blend it. Really simple and great taste.

great way to use up produce about to expire.  I doubled the recipe(used up some shallots too!) I used a hand blender to chop up broc/onion mixture.  After cooling, I stored in a couple containers in freezer.  Pulled out when I needed to make a quick dinner or lazy day lunch.

This was very good, but I did add 1 pound (1/2 box) of Velveta cheese to it towards the end. I took held back about 1/2 of the cooked broccoli and added it to the pureed mixture so it was chunky.

very fresh tasting. Broccoli was right out of my garden, but I felt that the soup was a little bland as is and could use some additional seasoning.

This IS the best cream of broccoli soup!  No piles of cheese or other high-fat dairy products here.  I substituted out 1 cup of the milk for more high-quality vegetable stock, and doubled up the roux to make the soup thicker.  Fabulous!  Thanks!

We made a huge pot of this (quadrupled the recipe) and added potato (peeled, diced, and boiled separately until soft) and ham (diced).  Then we served with shredded cheese on top to several families from our church.  It made a delicious meal.

This is sooo good and easy.  I did saute the broccoli stalks with the other veggies and then pureed them together then added the broth and broccoli florets.  Then I used the potato masher to break them up.  I even made extra and froze the base without the milk for an even faster soup.

Used 1/2 an onion, didn't use celery. Soup turned out great when a cold front moved through on a Saturday afternoon. We went to a city "WinterFest" where they bring in a truck that blows snow, made of bags of ice. Y'all up north are probably laughing, but here in the tropics of Houston, it's a novelty! Anyway, I used a 1/2 pint of whipping cream for 1 cup of the milk, and 1 cup of whole milk for the rest. Needed some salt, and I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar and a piece of provolone as it simmered. Used potato masher as per other reviews, and left some big chunks for flavor. The "picky" kid ate his whole bowl! Will keep. Thanks for posting!

Oh my stars this was awesome!!  I always read through the comments before i try a recipe so i tried a few tweaks!  I didn't have a potato masher so i just took out some stalks of the broccoli and used my hand mixer and i also added a couple of potatoes and it turned out fantastic, nice and thick.  I added some cheddar cheese just before serving and i also like to put some cheezit crackers in too!

Wonderful soup! Thanks for sharing, I didn't have celery on hand, but I didn't miss it.  I went to souplantation recently and they had a similar soup so I searched and found this recipe, which I actually prefer!  Will make this recipe regularly!  Also, French's fried onions are a delicious topper.

This had a great, fresh taste. I added a little garlic to the vegetable saute. I also used a whole bag of frozen broccoli florets, and this worked just fine. Once the broccoli was cooked a little bit, I took most of the broccoli out and blended it in my blender into smaller pieces with a few chunks. This provided the great consistency I was looking for. Additionally, I wanted a little bit of cheese in my soup, so I added this to the milk mixture to melt. By adding the cheese to the milk mixture, it melts and does not clump to the broccoli pieces. Overall, the soup had a great taste, but it needed a good deal of salt to fit my tastes. Other seasonings might give it that extra oomph that you expect. Maybe in the future I will add a tablespoon of onion soup mix or something similar.

Everybody writing reviews just adored this soup and I didn't care for it...So I am definitely going to have to try it again because I must have done something wrong.  I love broccoli soup and this recipe is so quick and easy.

I added a carrot & 1/4 head of califlower, plus a little cheese (about 1/2 cup total cheddar & cream cheese).  I also pureed about 1/3 of the soup & mashed the rest.  It was wonderful!!!

This was a good basic soup recipe, and it was great for a cold night like last night!!  I didn't add celery, b/c my hubby isn't a fan, and I used a potato masher to mash the broccoli instead of pureeing it. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

I was responsible for the soup at a family gathering.  I had never made cream of broccoli soup before but, I love it.  I tried this recipes and everyone raved over it, including my two sons. I'll be making this from now on instead of buying it or asking someone else to make it for me.

Very tasty and very flexible. I used a chicken bouillon cube and water in place of chicken broth and I added potatoes and carrots with the broccoli.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I made the recipe exactly as described, though I did need to add some salt at the end because I found it to be a bit bland. We also garnished ours with shredded cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe and so easy to make.I also preferred to use a potato masher instead of pureeing the broccoli. I wanted to taste some chopped broccoli.   I didn"t have celery so i preboiled some little potatoes.I then cubed them and put them in after I mashed the broccoli.Mash until it is the size you want.Enjoy. Very satisfying and filling.

It was easy and fairly good, but something was missing.  I always try to make a recipe exactly as read the first time.  Next time, I will add thyme, nutmeg, garlic, white pepper and sea salt.  Also, a cup more broth.  But tasty.  And I prefer the pureed soups.

Great! This is not one of those heavy, paste-y "cream of" soups, but was just the right thickness. The flavor is simple, but really good - fresh broccoli really makes it shine. I served it sprinkled with some grated cheese. Don't expect this to be a main dish soup because it is light.

I was a little short on broccoli, so I used half frozen broccoli and half steamed carrots, and it was delicious.  I also added a little grated cheddar at the end.

I have been searching for some time for a good cream of broccoli soup and I have found a winner!  This soup is delicious, easy and just plain wonderful. The only change I would make is to add some salt and a bit more pepper, that's just my preferences though!  Even the kids liked this one!

Excellent soup.  Tasted very rich and creamy.  I added 2 carrots (chopped), and a 2nd stalk of celery and removed the onion.  Instead of blending I merely smashed it with my masher.

This was a hit in our family dinner tonight. I added some cheese, as other reviewers suggested, athough living in Spain it was impossible to find sharp Cheddar, so I used a cream of cured Manchego instead...and it tasted good!

This is a delicious, easy soup! I used veggie broth to make it vegetarian, and added some garlic because I like garlic in just about everything. Home made croutons were also a very addition.

The recipe, as listed, was good; however I felt it was missing something.  I added a touch of nutmeg.  It turned out perfect.  I think I'll try and add some garlic next time as well.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Amazing soup. I needed to get rid of a huge bag of broccoli because my hubby hates it plain and this was the best way. He ate it all up. I used Real unsalted butter, added carrot shavings and almond slivers. It was gone before I knew it. Very filling!!!

Wonderful if you like broccoli. I added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the chicken stock and also included garlic. Served with just a dollop of light sour cream. It's really filling and very tasty.

Yum, great flavor.  I like too have something to chew on, so i did not puree the soup.  But I found doing it this way it needed an extra cup of milk and a little more flour.  Turned out great.  Even the kids loved it, well the ones that like broccoli anyway.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I worked at a restaurant that's specialty was cream of broccoli soup, and this was just as good! I will make again and again! The only drawback was that my viciously picky 2 year old refused to eat it, but then again, he only eats cheese crackers and fruit snacks.

Recipe is a good place to start, but I had to add extra chicken soup base to make it not so bland.  Also added white pepper in addition to black pepper, and some salt.  Needed extra thickening as well, so I used cornstarch in addition to the flour.  My finished product was then excellent...husband loved it!

I don't know about the kid part, but I liked it.  I will add more cream next time, but the flavor was great!  I made it completely vegan and it came out yummy.  I used a soy creamer made by SILK, which is slightly richer and thinkens better than soy or rice milk.  Also used vegan parmesan cheese, which is quite similar to regular parmesan.

Wonderfoul soup. I didn't have 8 cups of broccoli, so I supplemented with potatoes, and it turned out fabulous.

This was a great recipe, but I also had to simmer the broccoli for about 30 minutes. I think it would be easier to cook at medium heat for about 10 minutes.

Very tasty recipe - however, I found that the broccoli needed much longer than 10 minutes to simmer before it was soft enough - my batch needed closer to 30 mins. When it was all done, though, it was great - especially with some cheddar cheese grated on top!

Agree with others.  It’s a great base but needs more flavor.  Adding these to the original recipe worked for me:  2 celery stalks, 2 chopped carrots, 1 garlic clove.  Sauté for approx 5 mins along with onions.  I puréed the entire soup.  Fab!

--A wonderful basic recipe.  I expected it to be a bit tasteless since it didn't call for cheese.  Used both broccoli stems and florets. I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp. of nutmeg with the butter/flour roux.  Also added 1.5 cups of diced ham when all of the ingredients came together to make my meat-loving husband happy. Even better the second day!!!

Loved the recipe, but I did make some changes, I added a half cup of wine, I love the added flavor, after sautéing the veggies I added the wine before simmering, and I chopped the broccoli and celery and onion pretty fine so I didn’t feel the need to blend it, I like some texture. But the rest I followed closely, the ingredients and proportions are perfect.

Absolutely delicious! Kids loved it. Only differences: I used skim milk but added some heavy whipping cream at the end, used a veggie bouillon, and I probably used double the amount of broccoli. Our household loves broccoli so I’m happy to double up. Thank you!!

I LOVE that this recipe uses milk instead of heavy cream.  I am always trying to watch calories.  Having said that though, I've made it twice now using up whole milk from my young granddaughters' visit that I didn't want to throw away and it was DELICIOUS.  This last time, I only had bone broth on hand, a chicken & mushroom variety so I used that.  I also threw in carrots.   Both times I made this I added salt, and it needs a lot of it in my opinion otherwise I found the soup to be bland.  This is a great recipe!

Wonderful! I did make one change though. I used 1 Cup of 2% milk and 1 Cup heavy cream, for a richer sauce. I added salt and pepper to taste. Perfect soup for a chilly fall Wisconsin evening!

If anyone knows me, they know I can’t cook. This was was so easy to prepare! I used bagged broccoli florets to simplify preparation and an immersion blender to make it super simple to blend. Topped with sour cream & cheddar cheese and served with garlic toast. My family enjoys this as a regular go to meal.

Delicious!  We added some garlic, and also a grated carrot.  Gave some color.  We cut the broccoli up small, and then used the mixer to blend it at the end, so it would still have some chunks.  Delicious!

Loved it!  I cooked the broccoli a little longer and used a potato masher.  It was a better consistency with small lumps, and cleanup is way easier.  I made gluten free parmesan croutons to go with it.  Great lunch!

Super easy recipe, I added a generous amount of salt and pepper as it needs seasoning. I served it with grated cheddar cheese. I really loved it and because it's so simple I have added it to my soup recipe collection.

This recipe sounded really easy to make at first glance so I started out later realizing it required a blender of some sort.  My blender broke down a few weeks ago and hadn't gotten around to replacing it.  I wish it would have stated at the very top along with the ingredients that it required a blender.  Then I would have just skipped this one.
To make a suggestion, please list any tool or equipment that is needed at the top of the recipe so that you move on if you don't have those tools.

Great base recipe. 
Next time I think I will use whole milk instead of 2%.

The tip about only blending VERY lightly with a hand blender was great.

I added a dash of thyme and oregano and it helped deepen the flavors. If I had rosemary next time I think I might throw some of that in too.

For toppings I added some shredded sharp cheddar from TJs and it was a hit!

I added 1/4" diced:  carrot (3 small), 1 black bell pepper and 3 chard stalks to the onion, celery and butter in step 1.
I substituted 4 cups of broccoli for cubed young zucchini and added 3 chopped chard leaves.
I added to seasonings: 6 twists of ground fennel seed (pepper corn grinder), Spice Supreme; sweet basil, seasoned salt, garlic powder.
I added a little bit of cheese after the last step.

I’m a beginner cook and have come across many “simple recipes” that always taste mediocre. I, however, want to minimize food waste and had no idea what to do with the broccoli stems/stalks. I tried this recipe and I now cannot wait unti I need to get more broccoli just so I can use the stalks to make this soup! So good.

This recipe is very good. my suggestion would be to prepare the roux with warm milk. This will make for a velvety roux that doesn't clump. Also, add the milk gradually. Brown the flour to your liking. I sprinkled a pinch of nutmeg. I also used my hand held blender. This is restaurant quality soup that is extremely easy to make!

I agree with Melissa Goff; this recipe needed something.  I made it exactly as written at first and found that it was bland and had an unpleasant texture.  So that I could still have something to serve my family for dinner I added 1 teaspoon of dried minced garlic and  6 oz. cream cheese.   I pureed the soup with an immersion blender several times to get the consistency that was creamier.

It was really good, I ran out of onion, so I used dehydrated onion,which I thought was even better tasting.I used better than bullion, because thats what I had, so I didn't add any salt because I'm trying to cut down. I put grated cheese on top in my bowl, the last time I made cheese and broccoli soup I had to put a ton of cheese before I could taste it and keep adding salt for the flavor to pop out, so thats why I did it this way this time, less cheese, less salt.more flavor.

Very good recipe. I used chicken fat instead of butter and threw in a handful of cheddar cheese. Came out good. I also threw in some buffalo tofu. As an after thought for protein.

Well, this turned out good in spite of me!  I nuked broccoli in batches and that worked fine. But the 8 cups for the broccoli? my mind copied it over to the broth. So, I used too much broth. Tastes good, though! I'll try it again

Made this and followed some suggestions from reviews. I cooked the broccoli for longer (20 minutes) and mashed instead of using my immersion blender. It was good and would make it again.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe, added 2 carrots, used a combination of 2% and whipping cream, added salt & nutmeg, added 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar at the end.   I also allowed the veggies to simmer a full 20 minutes so the flavours could really shine through. Will definitely make it again.

I also used a stick blender, cooked 15-20 minutes before blending, used half and half instead of milk, added salt, added 1 cup of sharp white cheddar and drizzled with fire oil. Great recipe, will definitely be making this a lot.

The first time I made it - no changes.  My husband and I loved it.  The second time I made it with my cousin and she wanted it chunkier so we didn't puree as much.  It was still very good.
I like it better pureed more.

Excellent and easy! I only had an onion- no celery, added a little celery salt instead....this is gorgeous tasting. I kept it to one cup of milk and only a tablespoon of flour. Everything else was the same and the broccoli flavor was perfect- not overwhelming and NOT lost.

Just finished making this. Going through the fridge found a bunch of broccoli my son bought and forgot and decided to find a use for it.
The only modifications to this I made were, I added a clove of garlic; used bacon grease to fry the onions, celery & garlic instead of butter and last used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk as I have most of a quart that I bought for company and haven't used.
I don't think the changes were major but I have to say this was easy and came out delicious!!
I'm not a fan of broccoli but do like this soup!
The second bowl I added shredded cheddar & smoked gouda cheese blend as I'm trying to use up things near their  BB dates.
Both ways are 2 thumbs up!!
I did find that salt was needed but that was a simple fix.

I thought this was good, but the rest of the family... eh.  They wanted cheesy broccoli soup I guess.  Fresh nutmeg added a subtle layer of flavor.  Easy to freeze in smaller amounts for those cold winter days when you just want something hot and filling.

My husband loves this soup even though he doesn't like broccoli!  I sprinkle some shredded fontina cheese on top when serving.  Great recipe.

Very good! This had been my healthy go-to soup for chilly January.  I added more celery, removed the flour step and it's still delicious. I also made the same soup using cauliflower and it came out just as awesome.

This is a lovely soup  -  perfect for family and entertaining.  I followed the AllRecipes' adjusted recipe  for a double batch and used an immersion blender because it is so much easier than transferring the soup mixture from the stovetop to a blender in batches.  I did not puree until smooth - just enough to give the soup another level of texture.  For  half the total batch, I followed the  rest of the recipe with the milk mixture for great results.  For the remaining half without the milk mixture,  I froze it in individual  6-cup measures for my freezer inventory.

Very good, easy recipe to make!  The only change I made to this recipe is I used one can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and I added one tablespoon of" Better Than Bouillon Chicken" for additional flavoring.

I liked this cream of broccoli a lot!  I used 2 heads of broccoli, 1 liter homemade chicken stock, only added 1 clove of garlic, and a little bit of salt.  I did not follow step 3 (flour, additional butter), only added 3 tsp of cream and a 1/2 tsp pepper.  I then blended everything and returned it to the stove to reheat it.  I added more chicken stock to reach the consistency I was looking for.  This is a great recipe, the basic ingredients are perfect, thanks for sharing!

This was a rather quick and easy recipe to follow for cream of broccoli soup.  While i enjoyed it, it may have tasted more flavorful if i wouldn't have used store brand items.

Great basic soup. I did not have enough fresh broccoli,so added 1 bag of frozen broccoli thawed and put it in about 4 minutes before mashing with immersion blender leaving some florets whole. I added a bit of Nutmeg as suggested.

i decided to make this after my mother in law overcooked some broccoli for my son.  i halved the recipe since i had about 4 cups of broccoli she cooked.  the only thing i changed besides my broccoli being almost ready to be mashed was that i used heavy whipping cream instead of milk because i needed to use the leftover cream from making some cream brulee couple days ago.  i blended it since smashing it didn't seem to work well on my end.  but it came out very smooth and nice tasting... it was better than i expected it would be..  we will see if my son eats it.  he likes broccoli but not much of soup person.. but i liked it so far.

This is a basic and yummy cream of broccoli soup recipe. My kids loved it and I will definitely make it again. If you're looking for a lean soup without the cream, the pureed soup before adding the cream, flour and milk is delicious on it's own.

The recipe was easy to make. It was flavorful, but runny. I did use 8 cups of frozen broccoli florets, which may have made all the difference. I will be making it again, using more sauce or fresh broccoli.

A nice and easy recipe.. I followed the directions...although I tend to have a hard time doing that ... at the end, I added a few TBSP of Helluva good dip.... gave it just the zing I felt it needed... and of course some finely chopped parsley fresh from the garden... just over the top now!!!

Easy peasy with an immersion blender. Will try with a little Parmesan or Cheddar on top.

Followed the recipe exactly, and served the soup topped with shredded cheese. It was amazing and so simple to make! So much better than the canned one! This recipe is a keeper!

Great soup.  Will definitely make again.  Don't own a blender so used my little Cuisinart stick blender.  Worked out just great as I wanted to leave little pieces of broccoli in the soup.

It was my first try on soup making. Surprisingly it turned out very well I mean it was really delicious. I tweaked a bit by cooking chicken and the broccoli together to get the original broth and removed all the chicken and blended the broccoli  and the broth. Also added garlic....hehehe . U get the real deal!

I followed the recipe and the soup tasted good but it was not thick enough so I had to add more flour. This altered the taste a little so I had to add extra seasoning.

The first time I made it following the recipe and it was fanatic and my whole family loved it! The second time I used bell peppers instead of celery and used 1/3cauliflower and 2/3 broccoli simply because that is what I had on hand. Both times the soup came out really good.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

The soup turned out really good. I added a clove of garlic to the sautéed sweet onion an celery when they were done. I used a hand blender to purée and was careful to not over do it.

Really easy to make! Very happy with this recipe. Substituted a carrot for the celery and miso paste for butter (weird, I know). Added 3 cloves garlic. Used an immersion blender. Worked out perfectly - family loved it. Thanks!

I ended up using margarine instead of butter only because I was out of butter (GAH!).  I also added some shredded carrots for color and nutrition.
My daughter saw the broccoli I cut up for lunch and asked for soup.  She LOVED IT!  I will definitely be adding this to my own book of recipes.  Thank You!

I did as one of the reviewers suggested use a vidalia onion instead of a regular yellow onion and I used white pepper.  Turned out great. My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Will make it again soon.

Made the soup as described but it lacked flavor. Maybe I'll give it another try but reduce the broth. I did add a bit of garlic but again, lacked flavor.

We really liked this soup, but like other reviewers said it didn’t have enough flavor. As a base it is a great start, but it will need additions to make it flavorful and memorable. I just kept doctoring it up. I used cayenne, cheddar cheese , Parmesan Cheese, even some Gruyere. I added sautéed garlic and a cup of cream too. In the end, it’s a very simple recipe and everyone loved it!  I define recommend just add to your own liking. It’s worth your time and after all, everyone is having some broccoli.

This was good, but a bit bland. We ended up seasoning to preference with seasoned salt and grated Parmesan cheese. The one addition I added was  a half cup of frozen okra during the boiling time, then puréed the okra, onions and half the broccoli. This thickened up the soup nicely without needing the flour, which I can't eat.

Great recipe. I did not have chicken broth so I used bullion instead. I also cooked the vegetables in a frying pan with a little water, rather than butter. I also added some spicy paprika, and lots and lots of garlic!

Doubled the recipe with no problem.  Mashed broccoli and broth instead of using a blender, agree that the texture is much nicer this way.  Also simmered for at least 20 minutes as I also use chopped broccoli stems.  Added a nice amount of pepper and blended in two cups of shredded sharp cheese at the end so no salt was needed.  It is my mothers favorite soup and it must run in the family as it was adorable to see my three year old granddaughter tipping her bowl to get every drop!

I didn’t think it had enough flavor and added some thyme and some additional salt. Once I had done that, it was very good

This soup really hit the spot.  I sautéed the onions and celery in my electric pressure cooker, then added the broccoli,stems and all (no waste). Put the chicken broth in and pressure cooked on high for 3 minutes with quick release method.  While broccoli was cooking I thicken flour butter mixture on stove top and added a few slices of velvetta cheese, poured this into pressure cooker and used potatoe masher.  Turned out very yummy.

Not much flavor ~ I sprinkled some cheese on top after heating but noticed the family using a lot of pepper and some salt but sill commented that it was bland.   I’m not sure what I would do differently.

WOW! This is fabulous! I made a couple of tweaks. Took tips from reviews and mashed the broccoli as opposed to purée. I love the chunks of broccoli. Added a couple cloves of minced garlic. Yummy. Used veggie broth, and used a mix of heavy cream and half and half for more richness...not into counting calories just yet...lol.  Threw in some shredded Monterey Jack and hot sauce at the end...personal preference. Soooo good. Great comfort soup in cold weather!!!

Very flavorful. I used 1 1/2 cubes of Knorr bouillon cubes to 3 cups of water instead of using chicken broth. I saved 1/2 of chopped broccoli and added it later after I pureed the soup. I like chunks of broccoli in my broccoli soup.

Easy and delicious. I jazzed it up with some fried (and drained) Genoa salami, pureed potatoes and fresh garlic. Great for a cold winter day. You can certainly customize.

Love this soup! Instead of butter I used extra virgin coconut oil with the onions and celery. I find its healthier and gives the soup a nice sweetness.  I added some sweet peas as well and used the immersion blender so its a bit more chunky. It tasted amazing and was so easy to make!

IT is a good recipe. technically, this deserves 4.5 stars. It does need a little bit of spices to make it complete. salt is one of them... and something else (not bacon - too many calories). I also followed suggestions of other people about mashing it ,not blending. I love it this way. Since i am a strong dude, i mashed it as much as possible, still leaving some larger pieces. it ended up being perfect.

One issue i had with the recipe is the amount of broccoli. How much is 8 cups exactly? it's not flour that you can accurately measure in cups. I had 3 large florets and that ended up being too much. so i had to add a it more broth and flour/milk mixture.

Another good thing about this recipe is that it can be adjusted to your liking. It leaves so much room for it..

will make it again for sure.

I was unsure how this would turn out because I looked at so many recipes and they all required cheese. this didn’t. It did not disappoint. My 4 yo who is on a vegetable abstinence currently lapped it up. Served it with a side of ciabatta rolls and shredded rottiserie chicken in the soup. I also used leftover broccoli instead of fredh broccoli. Still tasted amazing. Topped it with generic parmesan cheese and still tasted amazing. Can’t imagine how amazing the flavor will be with fresh ingredients.

We added cut up fresh carrots as we ran a bit short of broccoli and it really added to the texture and flavor.  We'll likely continue adding carrots to this already great recipe.

Beautiful soup: used potato masher for chunky consistency, used half homo milk and half table cream, used blending flour and added a pinch of salt, as used unsalted broth.  Let sit in fridge overnight the fuse flavours.  Top with fresh grated Parmesan upon serving. So good.  Next batch will include 2-3 cloves minced garlic with the celery and onion.  Considering topping with fresh crumble bacon as well as the cheese.

This is a great base soup. I doctored it up with a couple different types of chesses including a truffle cheese and added just a pinch of nutmeg. But the base soup is solid and has good flavor.

I have to agree with the lower ratings. It's kind of chewy and bland as written. I added more salt and garlic and let it cook down. The broccoli did soften and it was better. I definitely wouldn't serve it straight up as described. Not bad, though. Just probably won't be my go to recipe. Was easy enough to make though

I didn't blend or mash the broccoli and we enjoined it with the chunks of broccoli .  Next time I will add garlic to give more flavor.  This is an enjoyable soup.

I'm with Melissa, not impressed.  It tastes basically like broth. Beautiful garden fresh broccoli best crop ever, homemade broth, garden fresh herbs. I added garlic, bit of cayenne to try and spice it up, both American cheese slices, and raw cheddar cheese, sour cream. Nothing I added helped. I was concerned the more I added to it the less broccoli taste there would be. Going back to my original recipe.

Easy to make and tasty. I made a few changes - everyone should always make changes to their taste. 

I added a clove of garlic, about 1/4 cup chopped parsley, and 2 small red skin potatoes. When done I added the juice of half a lemon. I also saved back about 1 cup of broccoli finely chopped and steamed it separately then added at the end. I like my soup chunky. Might save back a bit more next time. 

Plan to garnish with chopped green onions and some parmesan. 

Bring on soup season!

It was quick and easy and I used lactose free milk so everyone could enjoy. I only pureed as much soup as would fit in a magic bullet and mashed up the rest with a potato masher to make a mix of chunky and puree which was perfect. I added cheese when served and it was delicious!

We liked this soup a lot.  I may add more spice to it when I make it again.  I used a hand blender and it made for a great soup.

Lacking in flavour. This was alright, but given the reviews, I was expecting something better. I have had and I have made much better broccoli soup.

It doesn't really have any taste. It just tastes like broccoli with no spices. I believe adding garlic, salt, and some other spices would have enhanced the flavor. Will not make this recipe again.

This recipe is definitely a winner.... but I had to add a lot of garlic powder and onion powder to bring out the amazingness that this recipe has! Best soup recipe yet, even my kids eat it and they don't like broccoli!

This soup was great!  I did use unsweetened almond milk, and I omitted the onions (food allergies and lactose intolerance). Salt and pepper and it was great!!

My husband was crazy about it also. He said that it wasn't like broccoli cheese soup, but had a nice subtle  taste of broccoli. 

Oh, I steamed the broccoli florets and stems. Waste not, want not.

I've made this several times according to the recipe - but the last time I made it, I added a 16 oz. container of Panera Bread's Cheddar Broccoli Soup (store bought) - it really turned this soup into something rich and special.

I made this today so that I could use up some fresh broccoli I had, my 4 year old had 4  (small) bowls ...she loved it and that's saying something.. I simmered for about 20 mins and used a potato masher instead of blender. I like the pieces in the soup. I will keep on making this, maybe I'll tweak it here and there down the line but it's great the way it is.

The instructions to this are terrible. It was so detailed on how to use a blender but didnt care to explain what soup they are referring to. It says "Pour the soup into a blender" (What soup? Step one only instructs to simmer brocoli) Are you referring to the 3 Cups of Chicken Broth? Or is the sauteed Onion Celery and Brocoli being referred to as a soup? Step 3 just says to make a mix that will be added to the Soup, and thats it.. Please be more specific this recipe was useless I have to find another one online

Great base for a wonderful soup.  Instead of 2 cups milk, used 1 cup milk one cup heavy creamy.  Also added a splash of hot sauce and a little nutmeg at the end.

Excellent recipe for a very tasty broccoli soup!  Like other members, I added garlic for taste and a few small potatoes to help thicken.  Topped with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and pepper.

I think following this recipe exactly would have been good if I was making "cream of" broccoli soup.  My husband and I really like chunky soup.  Only changed two things.  1.  I used 1 Cup heavy cream and 1 Cup milk.  And I simmered the veggies for 20 minutes then mashed them slightly with a potato masher.  I will be making this again!!

I changed the technique some but followed the recipe. Don't know why people are saying it's bland. You adjust the seasoning to your taste which is why the recipe only calls for pepper. Salt is at your discretion. I don't know maybe people are used to the chemical loaded stuff.  This is a great broccoli soup, it's not a chicken soup or a carrot soup or a vegetable soup it's broccoli soup and IMHO should taste like broccoli  which it does, very much so. I am glad that it doesn't call for heavy cream. That is something I only keep during the holidays and don't buy the rest of the year.  
I agree that real unsalted butter should be used and as for the onion is there any other kind but Vidalia? :)  The natural sweetness in the broccoli and the Vidalia come through and is so good!  I don't understand what people are talking about when they say the soup is gritty? I must be missing something but to me gritty means sand and there is nothing like that in this soup.  I loved it and it is now in Mom size portions in my freezer just for me on cold nights in front of the fire watching a bit of TV. MmmMmm

I loved the flavor of this soup.  As someone who cooks with broccoli a lot but have never made Cream of broccoli soup I made the mistake of adding the stems not just the florets as the recipe stated.  A very good flavor but the stems were not a success!  lol  I will make again but will only use florets as the recipe stated!

We substituted the milk with canned coconut milk and added garlic salt at the end. It was pretty good. We'll probably make it the next time we have a ton of broccoli!

I  added shredded chicken to the broth because my daughter loves chicken. Oh, and I had no celery so, made it without and it turned out great! Am making this one again, for sure...

Good soup!  Don't forget to add seasoning.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of brie...made it a bit richer..

This is a family favorite.  We use butter instead of margarine and I double the recipe for my family.  We purée 3/4 and leave some pieces.  It's delicious!

I love soups, though usually the first time is a trial and don't expect to get it, but this was easy and really delicious. I will make it again and suggest to anyone who asks for a broccoli soup recipe.

I will definitely make it again. I added a little grated cheese and a few croutons  at serving time and I would recommend that. Also , try and leave some broccoli chunks when you purée.

I made a few changes and my family loved it.
I used 2 celery stalks with green leafy tops.
I added 1C julienned/grated carrots for color.
I used 4C chicken broth.
Instead of milk, I used cream.
I made my roux with 4T butter and 4T flour.
I kept 1C of the broccoli in florets.
I used a food processor before cooking the raw veggies.
After it was all cooked and resting, I added 2C sharp shredded cheese.
I super-thinly sliced 2 beadsticks left over from Olive Garden and put them on a cookie sheet in a 350° oven for 8 minutes to crisp them.  Served as garnish on soup.

I just made this.  Wow.  I read several reviews.  Made this recipe as written, but saved some of the cooked florets for texture and garnish.  Added some nutmeg and adjusted the salt and pepper  to taste at the end.  I also added 5 cloves of garlic and a drizzle of very good olive oil.  This is the best broccoli soup I have ever had.  I will make this again with some of the variations mentioned in the reviews.  This is a very versatile soup.  Froze some for later.  YUM.

REALLY good. I replaced a little of the milk with heavy cream. It also wasn't salty enough for me so added more salt and a little soy sauce for a wee bit of umami.

Really easy and delish!
Can't wait to bake a crust bread and enjoy them together.
I didn't change a thing and used 1% partly skim milk and the consistency is great.

Very good! I followed some of the tips from the top reviewer, and they were good recommendations....cooking the broccoli for 20 min and  then mashing most but not all with a potato masher (easier than with any type of blender). I liked that texture better than completely creamed. I did half whipping cream (had on hand and needed to be used) and half milk. I found it needed salt, too. Topped with a Mexican blend of cheese and some crumbled bacon. Yummeeeee!

Delicious and buttery!  I used skim milk and it was great.  Like some of the other reviews, I scooped out about a ladle of the cooked broccoli and did not puree it.  Adding it back to the pureed mixture gave the soup a more hearty texture.  For garnish, I may add a few bacon bits or a bit of shredded cheddar, but the soup is delicious the way it is.   Will definitely make this again!

I used vegetable stock for the chicken stock. I used olive oil for sauteing the veggies but butter for the roux. I didn't have enough broccoli so I used extra celery and some fresh spinach. I used some onion and some green scallions. Was the best  cream of broccoli soup I've had!!! Very quick to make!!!

Fantastic recipe with lots of flavour. I've made it a couple times thus far, using Pacific brand chicken stock. Recently, I've been melting a bit of cheddar cheese into the soup before serving and it's been very tasty. I have two suggestions for others trying this recipe... First, if you're using an upright blender, not to blend too long if you're looking for a soup with small pieces of broccoli. The soup quickly gets very smooth and uniform, and it ends up looking unlike the picture and lacking texture. I would stop to check the soup every few moments while blending just to see how it's coming along. Secondly, BE CAREFUL when blending this. Hot liquids can build up steam in the blender and cause it to explode. If your blender has a lid, or even a small opening in the top, remove it, then fold a towel and place it over the top to stop splashing. Start blending on a low setting, then move to a higher one. Doing this will allow the steam to escape through the towel, without it exploding all over you. (Removing the lid also means you have one less piece to clean up afterwards!)

I made it gluten-free by substituting wheat flour for garbanzo bean (chickpea) flour and mashed it with a potato masher to leave it chunky.  This time I topped it with hot sauce but next time I will try a pinch of nutmeg.  Thank you, Jessie A. for sharing this simple and yummy recipe.  ??

Really a great recipe. I just made a few changes: I didn't use celery; I chopped the broccoli as fine as I could so I could skip putting it in a food processor/blender, and simmered for 15mins instead (loved the texture!); then I put somw grated cheese before turning off the heat. Then, I made my own croutons. Really, really good! Thanks, allrecipes!

I used this recipe as a base - added garlic, chopped cooked chicken and small amount of cooked baby pasta shells and a good pinch of nutmeg. Yum!! Turned in to a good dinner with a side salad.

Easy, pretty quick and super tasty. I substituted butter for Nuttelex and regular milk for lactose free and still delicious!

I mostly followed the recipe.  I used 2 stalks of celery instead of 1 and I peeled and thinly sliced a carrot.  Before blending I added 4 cloves of roasted garlic.  Instead of using 2 cups of milk I used 1 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of half n half.  
To serve, I bought  4 small round loaves of bread and served the soup in the hollowed out  bread and lightly toasted the insides to use as croutons.
We loved it.

Love this recipe! It's a favorite in our house and the kids and husband love this just as much as I do. I follow the recipe as stated but will leave the celery out whenever I don't have it on hand.  This freezes and reheats well.

This was pretty good the first time! I made the mistake of using my newly acquired blender and while blending, I was also on the phone, and it got way to watery and blended down. :-( 
Luckily I had some petite broccoli florets frozen and threw them in. Voila!!!! Perfect!
The next time I made sure to pay attention and only blend a couple of times , hee hee. It turned out very very good! Hubby raved about it!!!

This recipe is perfect. The soup is thick and delicious. I like the texture of the broccoli, so I blended half and then minced the other half and added it in at the end. Either way, this recipe is fantastic! I will definitely use it again.

This soup is delicious.  I chopped a few cups of celery, onion, red pepper, and jalapeño pepper.  I sautéed those vegetables until softened and then added 3 cloves of chopped garlic for about another minute.  I used about 8 cups of broccoli along with the broth and it took about 25 minutes to soften.  I pureed everything in the pot with my inversion blender.  After I added the roux, I added about two more cups of chopped broccoli.  After warming for a few minutes I added lots of black pepper, a few shakes of crushed red pepper, and a bit of seasoned salt.  This is a very easy recipe. The soup was very filling and sooo good!

Went with the mashed method instead of the puree, gave it more texture which i like. Next time I will add more flour to make it a bit thicker but otherwise it is a very tasty soup.

So good 
I wasn't pulling out a blender in the middle of the night so I just used a potatoe masher like I read in one of the comments . 
But seriously really good. If ur Canadian and you have had Tim Hortons cream of broccoli soup, this taste almost the same to it!

This was so easy and quick and my six-year-old loved it!! I skipped the celery and chopped the broccoli in my food processor before adding it rather than using a blender at the end. I also added shredded cheddar with the roux. Delicious!!!

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to top it off with cheese for the ones on the family that wanted cheese.  It was super simple, quick and filling.  This is definitely a broccoli lovers soup as the there is plenty of broccoli in it and I love the fact that I can make it with regular milk instead of real cream and it still comes out creamy and delicious.

Love this recipe! I've made it numerous times, usually tweaking it to what I have to get rid of. I always toss in some carrots and usually some cubed ham. I've never gotten it to thicken properly, but it's just as good on the thinner side. I also use milk and condensed liquid chicken broth (instead of water or broth) to make it a bit more filling. If you choose to do so, be sure it doesn't boil over!

Wow, this was so easy. Like others, I mashed the broccoli after cooking in the broth and then used my stick blender for a bit to keep it chunky. I also added some chopped carrots because I had them on hand. Following another submission, I added a pinch of nutmeg and it does add a nice flavour. Also, I added about 1/4 cup or so of Kraft cheese whiz.

So easy and flexible - it allows for so many variations.  I've  used leeks instead of celery and onion; made it vegetarian by using veggie broth; and simplified it even further by using organic frozen broccoli florets.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

OMG,...made it in a wink.  My version, in butter and olive oil - sauted 2 carrots, 1 celery, 1 yellow onion, then added Swanson's Chicken Broth , and boiled that a bit. Used my soup immersion blender to blend, then added the milk/butter/flour mixture + cheddar cheese .  Absolutely perfect for a cold, rainy day like today!

It was awesome. This is a winner with the whole family but I I will not make it too often just due to the amount of butter used. So this soup is perfect for once in a while.

I added 2 cloves of garlic to the melting butter that starts the roux.  And, I steamed the broccoli to cut down on the amount of butter.  Didn't have any onions or celery, so I added onion powder once everything was mixed together.  It still seemed a bit bland after adding salt & pepper.  So, I added some nutmeg and thyme.  And, that made it so yummy.  Then, when I served it, I put grated gruyere cheese on top and that made it really good.  But, easy to make and fast.  Recommend, but with some added spices & herbs.

Great recipe, though I did replace 1/2 cup of milk with heavy cream.  This made it too rich in my book, so next time will use the classic recipe.  Also added one chopped carrot.  I mashed most of it with potato masher and pureed about a tenth of it.  Consistency was nice.

It was very good, not too rich. When making the roux I got distracted and it turned out clumpy, but i was able to save it with some extra whisking. I used the exact ingredients listed here with no substitutions (except veggie broth to make it vegetarian), but I wanted to use up some onion/celery I had so I used around 1/4 extra of each ingredient. I completely winged it and it turned out great so it seems like a very forgiving recipe. I put a little shredded cheese on top but it didn't even need it. Next time I will try low sodium broth and skim milk to make it even lighter. I have never made a blended soup before and was pleased with how easy and smooth this was.

Very good - I left out the celery, added a carrot, a potato, nutmeg, shredded cheese and olive oil in place of some of the butter.  Definitely puree this soup, I tried using a potato masher and it felt like I was eating broccoli and onions soaked in milk.  I used a hand blender on the leftovers and the flavor was enhanced.

Used a large onion and two stalks of celery. Also used cauliflower for some of the veg as I didn't have enough broccoli.  Experimented with coconut flour - wouldn't do that again as it didn't thicken up the roux to the same extent. Used 1% milk which didn't noticeably change the flavour.  Overall, a nice healthy-feeling soup. Good when you have leftover veg from a veggie platter.

Very easy to make!  I modified it according to other reviews by using butter and I substituted 1/4 cup of milk with 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream to thicken it up.  The soup was delicious and only needed a little salt/pepper to add flavor.

Bland, gritty and not very creamy. Second try I cut the milk in half and added 1/2 cup of heavy cream when I added the flour and milk mixture which helped make it creamier. I did not blend it the second time and instead finely chopped the broccoli for a chunkier soup. It definitely needs flavor so I added 1 fresh garlic clove to the celery and onion then a pinch of red pepper flakes, a pinch of thyme, and 2 tbsp dijon mustard. The modifications helped but even then...only 4 stars.

This is a really good base recipe. We are from southeast Louisiana, and we prefer more flavor than the original recipe offers. This was fixed by adding some Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning to taste. I also added cheese. Talk about delish! Great little recipe to get things started.

A few tweaks - two dollops of cream cheese, some added onion powder, and a teaspoon of garlic in oil (in lieu of a clove). Turned out pretty decent!  Oh and a tiny bit of soy sauce.
My family loved this but I tend to like things a little more flavourful. They also prefer not to have any butter/margarine due to health concerns, so this will have to be a once in awhile recipe for us. Oh and I may add some paprika or basil next time.

I haven't tried other recipes on the site for this item but this was a good soup. If you prefer a richer taste make sure to use 2% milk. I used fat free by accident this time and it definitely affected the taste

Ive been making this soup for a long time and my family loves it. I don't dirty another pot by making the cream sauce separately nor add in the extra butter. I just pour the cold milk in a large measuring cup, add cornstarch or flour, then whisk it  until smooth. Then after pureeing the broccoli and broth soup, I slowly pour in the milk mixture  and keep stirring.  Reduce the heat and stir as it thickens.  You also can at this stage add parmesan cheese.  Close to serving time I throw in another grated cheese like cheddar  for extra richness.

This was fabulous!  I didn't have celery and I added garlic. Like others suggested I mashed the broccoli with a potato masher to give it some texture and also added some shredded smoked gouda cheese.  Will definitely be making this again.

I agree with some of the posts from here that it had an overly broccoli gritty texture but I  added 13 oz of cheddar cheese dip (melted). This definitely changed the texture of the soup to a creamy, Panera-like, taste. My entire family loved it!

So delicious! I just made it and my 2 year old kept asking for more. I didn't use celery as my husband doesn't like it and I used heavy cream as that's what I had in the fridge from another recipe. I also used cumin and garlic powder. I'll definitely make it again!

I followed the directions exactly the first time and found the flavor kind of bland.  Second time around, I added minced garlic and crushed red pepper when sautéing the celery and onion....definitely needs more simmering time to cook the broccoli.  I blended 1/2 the soup and used a potato masher for the rest.  At the end I added 8oz. of cubed cream cheese, salt to taste and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Delicious!!

I needed more salt to get the flavor to pop, but this was a great way to use up some broccoli that was going to turn soon. And now I've got some soup in the freezer for nights I don't feel like cooking.

Simple, elegant and easy.  I have served this to guests many times, and it has never failed to impress.  Make sure you puree the broccoli in batches so it is smooth as silk.   I serve it with stilton and cheddar so guests can add what they like to the soup.  Thanks for this recipe.

Very good. Everyone enjoyed this soup. I shredded some old cheddar cheese and blended it in the roux & milk prior to mixing together with the soup. A bit  more of the cheese for garnish made a nice presentation. Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

broccoli is abundant around here, so we gave this recipe a go.  The recipe is very bland if left as is.  Needed fresh celery and fried onion croutons to give it some life. I also chopped a jalapeno into the mix, with fresh cilantro and basil.  It was a hit.

I own a small gourmet food shoppe and even though I usually tweak recipes or do a variation - I do this exactly as written and my customers devour it! I suggest trying it as the author has written it. That said, I have made it both with and without celery (I'm not a celery fan) - both are delicious, trick is to use Fresh celery, old celery has a "woody" taste.

Great starter recipe with good bones just crying out for culinary masters at home to tweak it and make it their own!

My initial version that followed the recipe tasted a little bland, so I gave it some oomph by adding 1/3 packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix - DELICIOUS! (Although it does deepen the color somewhat, as a warning to purists!)

I made this recipe because I had purchased the jumbo-sized package of broccoli at Costco. What to do with so much broccoli? Make this scrumptious soup!

This is good stuff! I and my friends love it! I used a plain old fork instead of the blender and it gives me larger granules, don't really like puree. Also down here in Yucatan we have a very rich cream, made by Lala which I use instead of the flour, more butter, etc. I cook VERY healthy, less grease or fats the better! Ate this with a bread of Yucatan...so good!   Thanks.

Very good. We had some leftover broccoli so I put it together in no time. I just used cornstarch not flour. And grated a small carrot for color. Topped with cheddar cheese. Yummy. I'll do that again.

this was very good. I did use half and half instead of milk and added crumbled bacon to the top when served, but paired with a hot ham and cheese sandwich on a chibatta, it was a very nice winter meal! I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious. I added a whole head of broccoli and since I didn't have celery, I added about 2 oz.  of cheese. I used dried skim milk in the recipe for extra protein. I used skim milk, not whole milk. So scrumptious. I'd love to show a picture, but your site isn't allowing this.

Definitely a keeper. Got rave reviews, even from my picky hubby! Just added a bit more salt and some cornstarch Ro thicken it up (I think I added too much broth). I agree with all the reviewers opting to use a masher for the broccoli.

Great recipe! This will now replace my old one.  I simmered broccoli for 20 minutes.  I too used a potatoe masher as we like our soup chunky, as suggested by others.  I didn't use celery, used garlic instead and chopped up carrots finely to sauté with onions and garlic.  I added the flour to the pot right after sautéing the vegetables, before adding the liquid just to make less dishes to clean.  Just added 1/2 & 1/2 to the pot until heated through.  We topped with cheddar cheese. Thank you for sharing, Jessie A!

It was definitely bland if made the way it is written. We had to add a lot more garlic, paprika and a block of smoked sharp cheddar to make it taste good.

Great recipe!!! I used EVOO instead of butter and skim milk. Little more waist friendly! 
Added a sprinkle of cheddar on the top! An overall hit with my husband.

I've made this recipe many times. I'm headed to the store to pick up the needed stuff. I agree with another user; I only use a valdlia onion, and I add bacon to it. I use a potato masher and other than the bacon I wouldn't change a thing. It's definaly a keeper thank you for sharing this, my whole family loves it.

A little too bland when made as directed.  A sprinkle of nutmeg and some shredded sharp Cheddar cheese helped a lot.  Next time I would substitute half (or all?) the milk with TJ's nonfat half-and-half as it should have been creamier.

My 2 adjustments were using 1 cup of heavy cream in place of 1 cup of milk & blending half of the broccoli to a smooth texture & then mashing the rest with my spoon so there were big chunks. This was absolutely delicious!!!

I read the reviews before making the soup and so added 3 stalks of celery and one potato to ensure a thicker consistency. I also added dry mustard powder and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese to the finished product before serving to kick up the flavor a bit. I was pleasantly surprised with the result. I've added it to my recipe list and will be making it again.

I liked Ike (couldnt resist, tho he was b4 my time????) 's review and my curiosity got the better of mr!  You can have it real smoothe like pea soup, you can have it textured, you can add spices and heat if you want to sear your tonsils, and you can make it with an undetectible tweak. My only tweak was: substitute  one can of fat free evaporated milk for 12 oz (1&1/2 C) of the milk called for. I HAD to do that because I did'nt want the self appointed food police tearing my review apart. It also makes the roux w/butter slightly more acceptable to all the Carrie Nations out in the big brother/sister world. Did I like it???  As my mum used to say "Does a duck swim?"

okay I followed this just like the directions, I didn't add onions, because I don't like them, I used onion powder instead. I cut the broccoli separate in my food chopper instead of using a blender. so I got some chunks in there, which I liked. the only thing I added was about a cup of mozzarella shredded cheese. it was yum!

My wife and I love broccoli so we're always looking for new recipes.  This one worked very well and like most soup recipes is easily adjusted depending on the ingredients you've got in your larder.

I made this exactly as written except I used frozen broccoli and added a small diced potato to the celery and onion.  At the end I added a cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese because my daughter's boyfriend wanted cheesy cream of broccoli soup.  It came out just right.  Was good even without the cheese.

This was terrific! Used lots of peeled, chopped broccoli stems in addition to florets. Made it vegan with rice milk, Not Chikn bullion, and an olive oil roux. Delicious and so healthy! Will definitely be making this again.

This soup was delicious.  I did not puree the broccoli, just chopped it a bit as it cooked in the chicken broth and also added some fresh garlic.  Really easy and really good.

made a few adjustments for my supplies on hand and for the microwave, incredible!
used grape seed oil instead of butter,
 in a thick ceramic bowel grape seed oil add thinly sliced ( local ) onions. frozen dollar tree broccoli about half a bag, nuc for 9 minutes.
 in a cup heat tablespoon or two of grape seed oil , heat for 45 seconds, add table spoon of flour, heat for 1 minute.
 after broccoli and onions are cooked puree in blender (bella works great!)
 heat the oil for the flour, then put aside ( i use a glass coffee cup
 then i dissolved one cube of garlic onion bullion ( very small cube) in a tiny bit of water, then added chicken broth and about a half cup of condensed milk and the puree mix and the rue and heated for 3 minutes.a
 sprinkled with Parmesan (dollar store heh) and it was amazing!
 a touch too salty, less broth or bullion next time, but fast and incredible!

The soup is excellent. I listened to the reviews and used a hand masher instead of a blender. The recipe is a keeper.

I've made this recipe about 4 times now - so good! I do use only one pot though (mix the butter and flour into the onions after they're soft and let it "cook" for a little bit then add the broth and broccoli) and don't puree everything, just a couple cups to leave some chunks.

I love this soup. I made some minor tweaks such as.... Add a few pieces of cauliflower.  I steamed my broccoli & cauliflower while I saluted the other ingredients.  This saved on time. I used 2 stalks of celery and a tsp of minced garlic. A dash of adobo.  Once simmered added everything to my ninja blender. Puréed until smooth (personal preference). OMG!!! The blender gave the soup the creamy texture without the milk. Even so...I added 1/4 cup of light cream and 1/4 cup 1% milk and followed the remaining directions. Delicious perfection.  Got the thumbs up from both of my kids  (who don't do green ANYTHING). I will definitely make this again.

I'm giving 5*...however, this is what I feel needs to be altered slightly; I don't use celery (personal preference) I do add a good pinch of oregano & marjoram and it's very important that if you want a good thick soup, make sure your broth doesn't cover the broccoli (just enough broth that the florets still poke out if perfect) also, I double the butter for the cream sauce and use heaping spoons for flour as I want a real rich & thick cream sauce. I add the cream sauce to the broccoli & broth when the broccoli is tender then use an immersion blender because I like the odd chunk. That's it! enjoy :)

This recipe was genuinely good! I used 2% milk, and it came out a little less creamy than I would have liked, whole milk would probably give it a bit more flavor. The potato masher instead of a blender was a great idea, it keeps the texture a bit more chunky.

I wanted to get excited about this but just can't. It is just gritty broccoli in a milky base. I too left some chunks out and added them back in after blending. I used half cream in place of the cup of milk. Nothing worked. Where is the salt in this recipe? I even added some garlic powder.

Love this recipe! I rate success on whether or not my husband takes seconds and says he wants it in his lunch the next day and he did both! It was quick and very flavorful. I did add 1 clove of garlic after sautéing the onions but before adding the broccoli topped it off with just a touch of cheese. Loved it!

Great base recipe leaves plenty of room for trying different things. My first time making it I blended half of the broccoli and left the the remaining whole as was recommended in the other reviews . Also i added some boiled potatoes and batata as well as some fresh corn that i cut off the cob. The corn really made the dish and added some great texture. I used almond milk instead of whole milk, and vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I finished the dish with a roasted almond garnish, as i prefer an edible garnish. All in all the the dish was fantastic i recommend to any one. I called this one steve's  broccoli and corn chowda.

sent some of this soup home for my daughter in university. she said it was 'fantastic soup and wished I had more'  very easy to make-  took some of the other  suggestions: mashed the broccoli in the pot so it would have small chunks of broccoli and pureed of the cooked soup to make it thicker. substituted 1/4 cream for milk. other than that made it just like the recipe.

Really enjoyed this soup and it turned out great. I did a few things differently. I used 1 head of cauliflower and 1/2 a bag of fresh spinach in addition to the 1 head of broccoli. I put the veggies in my food processor and lightly pulsed. I also used 5 cups of broth and simmered for 20 minutes. I used a potato masher to get some of the bigger pieces that the food processor didn't chop. For the cream sauce I used 1 1/2 cups 1% milk and 1/2 cup of light sour cream. Final result was awesome. I added minced garlic too with the onions and celery. Definitely a keeper!

I used organic chicken base for the broth called "Better than broth" and the whole recipe was just okay. Very quick and easy though.

Tried this recipe without any celery but I added the pack of smoked salmon we couldn't finish into the soup towards the end. The salmon added flavor to the soup and my fiancé thought it made the soup tastier and fancier too . He said the soup was fancy just like those from a restaurant :)

I tried it but added the heavy cream, baby carrots and red pepper flakes after reading some of the reviews while I was cooking. I forgot to put the nutmeg in. Not sure if that would have conflicted with the spicy. I crumbled up pita chips and tossed them in for some crunch.

Very good but made a few modifications to meet my preferences.  I added 2 tsp of salt with the broth, a cup of chopped carrots with the celery and onion, 3/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar, and substituted half and half for the milk.  Even with these changes, the calories for a 2 cup serving was 400 calories.  I ate this as a meal with a slice of wheat artisan bread from the grocery store deli.  Delicious!!!

This was pretty good! I swapped frozen chopped spinach for the celery, then added some cheddar cheese and parmesan at the end. It was a little bland... I used some sea salt, a lot of black pepper and a little shake of nutmeg, but it still seems to be missing something. Maybe garlic? I'll make it again anyway! It's yummy and my non-soup-loving husband asked to have it for lunch at work, which is compliment!

My husband does not like broccoli and he had seconds. I used a stick blender rather than the method the recipe used. It took less than a minute to blend in the pot I was cooking the soup in. I also had some left over cheddar cheese so added that. Great soup.

I substituted the milk for coconut milk and the chicken broth for mushroom broth and it turned out slightly sweet, which our 13 year old boy (who hates vegetables, especially broccoli) absolutely loves! He just can't get enough of it! We also graded cheese in it to give it a little extra yumminess. This recipe is amazing!!

I really liked this recipe but I used Farmland Skim Plus Milk since that was what I had. Next I will use whole milk since fat adds a little extra flavor. I also added garlic powder to give it a little oomph. Will definitely make again.

This was a wonderful base from which to create a delicious cream of broccoli soup.  I went with the non-blender version.  I also set aside some broccoli florets to add back in to the soup after the rest was mashed.  It looks good and tastes great.

Very good and easy recipe.  Just a note...when you melt the butter and add the flour and milk, make sure you cook the flour in the butter for a minute or two before adding the milk so you avoid that "raw flour" flavor.  Additionally, I pureed half the broccoli and mashed the other half, so to have a heartier soup.  I also substituted 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk so it would be richer.

This is a great base recipe.  I had a delicious cream of broccoli soup at a restaurant near my home months ago and I wanted to relive the experience.  I used olive oil and margarine to saute two stalks of celery and 1/5th red onion until soft.  I then used about 2-3 tsps of vegetable base with 16 ounces of boiling water.  I didn't have fresh broccoli so I used a bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrot instead.  I nuked in the microwave until soft and ate the carrots and placed the cauliflower and broccoli in the pot to simmer for 10 minutes then I used a potato masher to break down the cauliflower and broccoli into smaller parts.  I then pureed half of the contents and returned to the rest of the soup, added about 1/2 cup of low fat milk, salted to taste, mixed, and served with croutons.  I will definitely try this again. (I uploaded the pic in the orange bowl with 4 croutons on top).  Thanks again for the recipe!!!

Quite nice! I mashed my broccoli rather than blending it, and added a cup of shredded sharp cheddar at the end of cooking it.  Really enjoyed it, nice and hearty. Made me feel good about eating my vegetables! We'll see how the leftovers taste once they cool down, if they last that long!

I agree with others on not blending this soup so much nicer with chunks of broccoli to enjoy.  I also peel the broccoli stalks and chop them straight in as well. Potato masher works great to smooth out a little. 

Try somesharp cheddar cheeses sprinkled over the top.

Additionally this can be made with vegetable stock for a great vegetarian option.

Add a wedge of lemon in the bowl and pour soup over it.  While eating, mash the lemon a bit with each bite.  Yummy!  Thanks.  I used to make this for my kids when they were little, now they ask their wives to make it.

I just made this for tomorrow night. We've been buying Subway's Cheddar and Broccoli soup and I make a good homemade version, but we've had Timmy Horton's cream of Broccoli soup a couple of times and I was looking for a recipe like that. It's just as good as the soup with cheese, but a bit healthier. This is just the soup I was looking to make. And very easy!

This soup was o.k. but just lacked something.
Maybe some cheese, but that only adds extra
calories.

The best soup I have ever made!  I followed the recipe, mostly.  Added potatoes first to the broth mixture and when they were cooked I added the broc-I only used a masher like other reviewers.  Also I added parmesan to the roux and it turned out amazing!

Tasty and easy recipe -I made 18 servings (love freezer soup)  using almond milk and br. rice flour & chicken base (which is probably why I needed to add salt?) Also I used my "Hand Blender" to smooth it all out...what a great invention!!  Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I always think broccoli soup needs cheese - I may add some when I heat it up.  Thanks for my NEW broccoli soup recipe!! Update: DOES NOT NEED CHEESE - YUMMY AS IS!!

Great recipe for a base and leaves much room for personal taste and flare. 

I'm 12 weeks pregnant with major Hypermesis and seem to be able to at least tollerate thick soups. I love broccoli so this seemed perfect. I did try it with just the milk and only 1 stalk of celery but the second batch I made I went with some of the reviews choices. 

I did 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk. I used 3 stalks of celery (And I would contemplate adding a little more because it fills it with fiber without the calories). I did se margarine and I know why some people say you should use butter, but make sure you really enjoy the taste of your margarine before you go and use it; it will taste like it and the butter jst gives it more of a delicate flavour. Nutmeg definitely gave it a bit of a kick on the first batch, the second batch however I added a bunch a parm in it and it made it taste so yummy. 
The third batch I'll make tomorrow I'm going to used the heavy cream, milk and the extra celery but I'm also going to put in some nice cheddar and make the milk base into a cheese sauce then add the broccoli. I think it will be just as yummy if not better.

This was pretty tasty. If I hadn't tweaked it to my liking, it probably would've have been on the blander side. I added one packet of powdered chicken stock, fresh and powdered garlic salt, and a pinch of nutmeg. Overall, will make this again.

Delicious and easy. As another user recommended, I simmered for 20 minutes rather than 10. Substituted milk with almond milk and that worked without issue. Added just a little bit of salt afterwards, lots of pepper, and melted a pizza mozzarella/cheddar cheese mix on top for an awesome finishing touch. Loved - will make again.

Add a little salt and grated cheese to add a bit more flavor, and substitute butter for canola oil to make it healthier.

This was great!  I took the suggestions of other gals and just mashed the soup and it was very good.  I did use evaporated milk that I had on hand and wanted to use so it did make it more creamy (and of course added some fat) but will use milk next time.  Will definitely be permanent in my recipe box.

Really enjoyed this soup--especially because it is so easy and quick.  I did cook it  quite a bit longer (my mother called on the phone) This however  really brought out the full flavor of all ingredients!  Healthy, tasty and hit the spot! Viva La Soupe A+

Dreamy, creamy soup!  Just happened to pick just enough fresh garden broccoli to make this recipe.  Followed the directions, as is, using ingredients as noted...maybe adding more pepper to my taste and oh yeah -- 1/2 cup half 'n half, rest skim milk -- but turned out super!  A-1 rating!

The recipe sounded bland to me so I added 2  garlic cloves & 1 shallot the the saute mixture. I used my excellent homemade chicken stock and I still thought it was bland even after adding salt, pepper & the nutmeg another reviewer suggested. Then I  chopped & sauteed in butter 4 Baby Bellas &  a little bit of  chopped dried Porcini Mushrooms that I happened to have  for a few minutes and added it to the soup. The mushroom flavors didn't incorporate well untill I poured the soup back in the blender and reblended the mixture. What a difference! This soup was fantastic that way, with the mushrooms.  I think the dash of nutmeg helps too.  I topped it off with some grated cheddar.

i didn't have celery so added some carrot.I guess I put too much carrot that's why it was little on sweet side and instead of grinding I just mashed it.

This was great, and best of all cheap! I think I may have spent $6 on all the groceries I needed for the recipe. I didn't bother blending up the broccoli but rather just mashed it up leaving a few big pieces because blending seemed like a pain and I like big veggies in my soup. I also subbed veggie stock making the recipe vegetarian and topped with Parmesan cheese.

Oh sublime yumminess!  Would give it 10 stars.

What I will do different next time (yes, there WILL be more times):  I will steam the broccoli in the chicken broth so it gets tender quicker.  

For the roux I used whole wheat flower b/c that is what I had and 1/2 almond milk and 1/2 reg. milk b/c, again, that is all I had.  Did not seem to affect the recipe so I may just use all almond milk in the future.

I used my immersion blender rather than mess w/ reg. blender.  I cannot live w/o this hand appliance.

Very good flavour, but quite thin. I'd add more flour/butter/milk next time, and maybe less broth. I chopped up the entire broccoli stalks, not just the florets. No need to waste the stems! I served it sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese and some garlic toast on the side.

WOW!! I can almost eat the whole darn pot in one sitting. An absolutely perfect and delicious soup. Only minor changes I made were I added a small packet of crushed red pepper for the extra kick, a handful of baby carrots and some garlic salt. An electic mixer right in the pot of soup works perfectly and much easier. Soup was smooth with just enough chunks. Flavorful and delicious!! Will double the recipe next time.

Very good and I am not a broccoli lover!  I found myself with an excess of broccoli, so I doubled the recipe.  Followed others' advice and smashed it a bit with potato masher.  Made the roux, stirred in  12 oz of evaporated milk and partially pureed it all with an immersion blender.  Its a keeper!

I made this soup as a vegan, gluten free, lactose free version and it still tasted really good!  Substituted the butter with olive oil, the milk with almond milk and all-purpose flour with rice flour.  When I don't have vegan guests, I'll add a dollop of 99% lactose free sour cream as a garnish.

Eating this as we speak! Amazing soup. I added a clove of garlic (minced). I used a potato masher instead of using the blender. I found it gave a better texture to just cook the broccoli down and mash it manually... and topped with shredded cheese. YUM!

very good,  I use all the broccoli, peel the stems to get rid of the hardstuff,  I use it all, waste not want not is my motto.  I also do not blend,  I like clumps,  sometimes I dice it up before I cook it other times I mash it,  So good.  I have also used a mix of cauliflower and broccoli.  works like a charm.  This is real comfort food.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well except for the fact that there were flour lumps remaining in the skimmed milk I had used, even after it had thickened and I had to strain the mixture prior to adding it to the soup. Since I was in a hurry, I did not attempt to break up the lumps, just threw them away. Nevertheless, everyone liked it, even my husband who is not a fan of broccoli, and my daughter went for seconds. Some at the table preferred to sprinkle salt according to taste. Wanted to keep it light since rest of the dinner was to follow, so did not add any cheese etc. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe!  My partner and I just loved it.  I substituted heavy cream for the milk and added crushed red pepper to give it a bit more kick.  Turned out delicious.  Thanks for passing this recipe along!

This soup was really good!  I made a few adjustments based on what was already in my kitchen (and also used the broccoli stalks after removing the woody outside).  My kids love it and I will absolutely make it again!  Thanks!

This is a fabulous recipe! It's healthy, it's pretty quick, and my family really likes it! The serving size is generous and filling. I love to sprinkle parmesan cheese. Approx 5 WW points+ per serving.

Good soup, even my toddlers liked it.  I would have liked it to have a thicker/creamier consistency.  I mashed the broccoli and used 2/3 heavy cream.  Simmered my parmesan rinds before adding the cream mixture and added grated parmesan at the end.  Yum.

Wonderful soup but I did have to add some salt and garlic along with the nutmeg others suggested since it was too bland without it. But with that small change it is a keeper! Loved it. I will make this often.

i made this yesterday exactly as is, and it was perfect! i didnt have chicken broth, so i used 2 broth cubes with 3 1/2 cups of water.
i had the left overs today, still as good as it was. i made it for my parents, they adored it, and even our maid commented on how good it was. ill definitely do it again.

This is really a good soup.  I rated four stars since I did make some changes to suit my taste.  I left my broccoli chopped as I don't don't care for Broccoli soup that is pureed.  Instead of chopped celery I used one can of cream of celery soup.  The base agent for thickening (the butter and flour) next time I will double since using the soup it wasn't as thick as I would of liked.  It's really a five start recipe but like I said, if I make changes I really can't rate it five stars.

Yumm!  So simple and so tasty.  After reading the other reviews, I let it simmer for 20 minutes and also used a potato masher to mash up the broccoli so it was nice and hearty.  The only thing I added was some salt.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My 8 y/o granddaughter loves Cream of Broccoli Soup, when I made this she said it way better than anything else I have bought. It will deffently be made offten in our house. The only change I made was to use half and half for the milk. It's some thing I always do when making cream soups and I added some garlic powder. Thanks so much for sharing your awsome soup recipe.

This was a good recipe, but I did make a few changes. I only hand blended in the pot instead of putting the soup in the blender, we like it a little chunky. I also added a little nutmeg to the milk mixture as another review suggested. My family liked it. It ended up being a bit runny and I added cornstarch to try to thicken it up. I believe I added too much chicken stock at the beginning, so that is probably why. Great basic recipe though.

I actually veganized this recipe and it turned out great! I didn't have any celery so I used one potato in place to make it a little filling and I topped it off with some cilantro. Overall, great basic recipe!

A+... after tasting we added 1/2 shredded mozzarella, and 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar, however, it was good without the cheese as well.  Did use a cup of light cream and a cup of milk since all I had was 1% milk on hand and wanted it to taste creamy. Used a potato masher.  Is now in my recipe book.  Thanks Jessie A.

This was wonderful. Very flavorful. I made with exact ingredients specified but mashed the broccoli soup mixture with a potato masher instead of using a blender. Also cooked the broccoli 20 min instead of 10 min. I used Smart Balance skim milk and it was still creamy and delicious.

This was very good. However, I omitted the butter and flour mix and replaced it with a heart healthy version which is way tastier. Take about 3 medium sized shredded and peeled potatoes and boil the shredded potatoes into a starch using a mixture of milk and water. No butter needed at all except to tenderize the onion and celery at the begining.

I was surprised how quick and easy this recipe is. I used 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup heavy cream for a richer flavor. Tastes great! Thanks!

I think that this recipe is really easy and great tasting. I like my Cream of Broccoli soup to be "Creamier" so I think I would double the cream sauce and add a little bit of cheddar cheese.

This is really good. Great consistency and super easy. I used a hand blender rather than a blender. Much easier. I also went a little more liberal on spices since I thought it came out a bit bland. I added chicken seasoning, garlic salt and white pepper to taste.

The best!  Most broccoli soups have way to much pepper, but this was great! I added 4oz of cream cheese to the soup.  I also just used a potato masher in the pot to mash up the broccoli.   When I served it, I put cheese and French Onions on top. PERfECT!

This was great and pretty simple.  I didn't have 8 cups of fresh broccoli, more like 4C.  So I also added about 4 C. of fresh green beans and it still came out great.  Added the dash of nutmeg too.

Just made this for my husband's birthday tonight.  We have made a lot of COB soups and this by far is the best I have ever tasted.  The only thing I did differently was to add about two teaspoons of salt when the broccoli and broth were simmering.  You will have no problem with soup being thin if you thicken the rue correctly.  Will be making this over and over again!

I thought this was excellent.  I added a bit of minced garlic and used some heavy cream that needed to be used from my fridge. I didn't have any celery so I used celery salt, it added a bit of flavor but not much.  I also cooked the broccoli and then mashed with a masher instead of pureeing.  It turned out awesome. We sprinkled some cheddar cheese right before eating.

I just made this tonight for the first time and it was wonderful! I uped the amount of  broccoli and broth (I used vegetable stock instead) and  also added a few carrots. I LOVE cheese, so I also added some to my individual bowl. The only thing it needed was some salt to taste. GREAT recipe, who knew it would be so easy and take only 35 minutes?

I give this only 3 stars likely due to my error... For 4.5 stars, I expected a lot more from this recipe, but perhaps making it with low sodium broth and unsalted butter and 2% milk wasn't the best idea... I cut the fat and the salt (and excluded celery)! Granted, it still came out well enough, but lacked flavor--but in the same way a typical low sodium soup might, I suppose. I did add some fresh white corn, however, and that helped a bit with bursts of sweetness and more texture.

My neighbour was throwing out a large bag of broccoli - NO!  I made this soup recipe and we loved it.  We share it with the neighbours and they loved it too.  I also added grated cheese on top.  Yum!!

My boyfriend and his best friend really liked this soup, I LOVED it!!! I was recluctant to measure out 8 cups of broccoli so I just used an entire bag of the frozen broccoli (1kg) you can get at safeway. Also, we didn't have any onion on hand so I used a package of onion soup mix along with about 3 cloves of garlic! The soup turned out perfect, so thick it bordered on solid!!! Very filling, great for a rainy day

Ours came out a little thin, but that could easily be our fault. :)   But the taste was great! We used a masher instead of a blender.

Soooooo Good.  Some changes I made:  no celery, a bit of kosher salt.  Brought to a boil and cooked another 20 minutes.   I used the mashed in the pot with a potato masher method rather than the blender, works great.   I melted the butter, added the flour and mixed to paste then added heavy cream a bit at a time constantly stirring.  It tasted fine but not great, then I made the final mistake and added 4 TBS of leftover sauce from a slow cooked pork barbecue dish.  This made it really great but when the sauce runs out I am cooked as it can never be made the same again.

I had just used my last onion, so I substituted garlic (which was phenomenal!) and went ahead an used peeled, chopped broccoli stems as well - and this soup was fantastic! (I think the key was really great homemade chicken broth, though!)

Yummy!  Nice base recipe.  I use the stalks, peeled and chopped, as well as the florets.  Added a minced clove of garlic.  I simmered for 30 minutes and used a submersion blender and it was blended in seconds!

MMMMMM good!!! I didn't have enough broccoli so I topped the 8 c. with cauliflower.  I will be passing this recipe along to my girls. I hand mashed the broccoli and cauliflower as I enjoy chunks in my soups. I will be making this soup again and again. Thank-you so much:):):)

This soup is absolutely wonderful!  A simple but perfect soup.  I did make two changes: I did half milk and half heavy whipping cream, and I added a 1/2 pound of velveeta.  I felt guilty about that last one, but it didn't make the soup super "cheesy", it just added some color and flavor.  I fed this to a group of 12 teenagers and most of them said they didn't like broccoli and were shocked at how much they loved the soup.  The bowls came back to the kitchen clean!  Thanks for the great recipe!  It will be used again in this household.

yummy...great tasting.  I added a bit of salt, because the recipe didn't use salt, but unfortunately we like things a bit on the salty side.  I suggest that if pureeing the soup when hot..only fill up the blender to about 1/4 - 1/3.  There will be less chance of exploding soup, that way.  Enjoy!  (Oh, and it is also pretty low cal..also a nice feature.)

This was just ok.  I like a creamier cream of broccoli, but even after making double the roux, I had to add sour cream and shredded cheese to make it just a little creamier.

I loved it! Definitley a keeper! I did just about everything, tweeked some things here and there... Something that wasn't in the recipe at all was instead of milk, I used cream to make it more of a 'cream' of broccoli soup... Not nessicarily a watery soup..... Also, I added a package of mixed monzerella and cheddar cheese into the soup, and spinkled on top for plating. Other than that it was great!

Without exception, this is the best broccoli soup I've ever eaten... I cooked the broccoli, stems and all for twenty minutes then mashed the broccoli with a potato masher instead of putting it in the blender.  It's quicker to make that way and also there are bits of broccoli left in the soup instead of being all liquid.  Believe me.... it's the best way to go... The final product is broccoli soup that takes second place to none!!!!

This is ultimate comfort food! It's so simple to throw together and takes almost no time at all. I feel so great eating things that aren't full of processed ingredients, and I definitely can't wait to harvest my own vegetables this summer and make this again. This one is going straight in the recipe book. I'm eating the leftovers right now with grated cheese on top and dipping homemade sourdough bread in it...Yummy!

Excellent soup!  I did find that it needed just a little salt, so I have added  a scant pinch to each of my three-cup daily rations.

We used 'better than bouillon' veggie stock and frozen broccoli to GREAT results! This is our new favorite soup. Just 2 of us managed to eat the whole pot.  I'll be making more tomorrow.

This is delicious. I used frozen broccoli, thawed it in the micro, then added it. Instead of a processor I used simple electric beaters and it worked beautifully. I used nonfat milk, and also whole wheat flour instead of white. Two TB less butter. Absolutely delicious!

I love cream of broccoli soup, and so badly wanted to love this recipe. I was very disapointed. Flavor, texture and thickness were all wrong. I don't think I would try making it again even with some tweeking. I did use half and half in place of milk. Each of us ate about half our bowl and then just couldn't take it anymore. I wound up taking the whole pot out to the pigs. I will stick with the ready made soup from Safeway from now on!

Followed recipe except I removed about a cup of broccoli florets before blending. Turned out very good, but not as creamy as I expected.

great soup, a bit bland, i needed to add plenty of salt and pepper to taste. next time i make it, i will probably try to find a way to flavor it more during the cooking process without adding salt to the end product. thanks for the recipe!

This soup was awesome! I threw in a few extra celery stalks and bumped up the chicken broth a half cup. I also added half a small box of velveeta cheese . As others have stated I used my potato masher and mashed the brocolli  My daughter who "hates" brocolli wolfed a whole bowl and wanted more! This will be a great keeper recipe!

Goodand really easy.  I also just used a potato masher after simmering.  It leaves the soup more chunky and it's faster with less to clean.  I used 1% milk and it still was thick!  My whole family loved it including my 2 YO and 4 YO!

What a great dish for St. Patrick's Day! It is very tasty. The broccoli purees very easily if you make sure that each batch has some of the broth in the bottom of the blender.

this is a good recipe for cream of broccoli....I love the taste of broccoli stems so I chopped those up small (same size as onions) and then sauteed them with the onions and celery. I also added a touch of nutmeg.   Will make it again. Thanks.

This is a simple, nutritious, comfort food. I used a low sodium broth and it turned out delicious! I will continue to make this one! Oh and use every last bit of the broccoli, not just the florets... it all gets blended anyway, and there is nothing wasted.

Of course I made some changes, so I feel bad for rating it 3 of 5 stars, but the end product didn't have a very strong broccoli flavor, and was a little too thin for my liking.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk instead of the 2 cups milk.  More calories, but definitely more taste!

I made this vegetarian (vegetable broth instead of chicken) and it was great.  A huge hit, and the kids didn't even realize they were eating broccoli.

Good, but something is missing.  It might be better (and considerably less healthy) with cream rather that milk.

I probably made it a little different, putting my broc in the food processor (I seemed to make quite the mess), but it came out really good. Needed some salt, though; we used celtic sea salt which sort dissolved as we ate.

Very good.  I do think it needs a little bit more spice, definitely some generous salt and pepper.  And I might try adding some cream next time to make it a bit richer.  But overall an easy, yummy soup.

Good, not great.  Next time will puree 1/2 of broccoli and then add 1/2 of the broccoli a finely chopped for better texture.

My husband hates most anything green except broccoli, so I was surprised he loved this soup so much he went for seconds and thirds!  The only things we changed was using half and half instead of milk, and adding steamed broccoli to the final product to get chunks.  It was delicious!

This soup was VERY bland. I added a bunch of seasoned salt and pepper and it didn't help much. I did not puree the soup as directed because I don't have such a device. I would suggest adding cream and lots of cheese and spices for flavor. Maybe bacon bits as well.

This soup is so gorgeous.  I did make a few changes, had no celery so left that out.  Used butter instead of margarine.  Substituted 1/2 a cup of milk for thick cream.

I used this recipe as a starting point. Here are the changes that I made. I sauteed the onion in olive oil instead of margarine. I substitute carrots for the celery because I was out of celery. I skipped the margarine/flour/milk step. Instead, I followed another reviewer's idea and boiled the broccoli in the broth for 25 minutes. Then used a potato masher so the mixture was not completely pureed. I added some Italian herb seasoning. The soup was ready a few hours before serving. So when it was time to serve, I heated the soup and added a splash of half & half. Mixed it through and the end result was surprisingly delicious.

This was a very easy soup to make. The only tweaks, i added carrot  when sauteing the onion and celery, then melted in quarter pound of munster cheese to the  soup.

Definitely one for the colder months rotation of recipes!! I used a little more broth because it didn't seem like enough (it could have been) but I just added a little more roux and I used 2cups of light cream in place of the milk and added 2 cups of shredded monterey jack cheese. I also omitted the celery and didn't miss it a bit. For me it was totally unnecessary to dirty my food processer and I just used a potato masher till my desired consistency. I left it a little chunky. Absolutely delicious!!!

**Made this again yesterday because I served it xmas eve and had only a few spoonfuls for myself.... yesterday I did half broccoli and half cauiflower and put a little white wine in with the broth. It was yummm.**  This is one of those great versatile recipes. I started with chopped bacon, then cooked onions/celery/broccoli in the bacon grease. I used cream instead of milk and added shredded sharp cheddar to the roux. So it was really cream of broccoli, cheddar, bacon but it was fabulous. The only bummer was that I only had 4 cups of broccoli and had to cut the recipe in half so there's wasn't any leftovers!! This is a definite keeper! Thanks!!

My husband and I ate one bowl and threw the rest out.  Maybe it was my fault but I tried to follow the recipe exactly.  This is the first time I've ever left a negative review, but this soup was not good.

I just made this last night, it was very easy and very tasty. I tweaked my recipe as ike1974 said to, with chopping the broccoli (I did it in a Cuisinart) and used non fat milk. There was no mention of salt to be added, so I added a few pinches to taste. After all was said n' done I took out about 2 cups worth and hand blended the rest, then added the 2 cups back in. I give it 4 stars only cuz I've never made this before so I can't compare.  Today I am going to take the left overs and cook in some turkey bacon. Perfect soup to have at the end of a cold rainy day. :P

This was delicious! I kept mine a little chunky like others suggested, and only used a tiny bit of celeriac, because I am not the biggest fan of celery but had some leftover. I also added a little garlic because I love it! It was very tasty and I will be making it again.

I crave this soup! It is really good. I adjust the ingredients a bit (more stock, less milk) and add a lot of thyme and some garlic when I saute the onion. I use a hand blender to puree. Quick, easy, yummy! Thanks!

this was very good even though i had to use frozen broccoli. after reading several reviews i used a potato masher, added garlic, and added lemon pepper. i was glad to find a broccoli soup recipe that didnt call for heavy cream or cheese for a change of pace.

Pretty good recipe, the soup was missing something though so I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. Along with salt and oyster crackers it spruced it up a bit and was prett good.

Very good soup. Just added some garlic and cheddar cheese on the top after it was done.

I made this recipe for a cooking class, and it turned out great! I made quite a few changes though, based on the other reviews.   Instead of totally pureeing the broccoli, I just gave them a few spins in the food processor, and kept the stalks in as well. Doing it like this however means you won't get the rather nice green colour in the photo, and I also wish it was a little thicker. Next time I would make more of a roux to thicken the soup.   I put in some cloves and nutmeg in for flavour, and some cheddar cheese. It was wonderful as a garnish, along with parmesan cheese. We also had some Parmesan Garlic Triscuits on hand and they went fabulously with the soup!

This was wonderful!  We got a huge bunch of broccoli with our organic box delivery so I thought I would try this.  Used every bit of it, stems and all, just cooked a little bit longer to soften. Threw in some garlic with the onions at the beginning, and used the potato masher idea, which gave it lots of nice texture, otherwise followed the recipe. Can't wait for the next broccoli delivery!

I love this soup!!! I added a little bit of garlic to it and blended it with my Magic Bullet, leaving some whole pieces for a thicker texture, added some Parmesean cheese to top it off, and it turned out amazing!

Fantastic. I added 2c shredded cheddar to the white sauce before adding it, but that's my only change and it was out of this world. Even my toddler was begging me for more "bocky soup!"

Personally, I would have rated this  3 stars as I found it quite bland, but my family ate it all up so I'll compromise with a 4.  I did add sharp cheddar to it and that helped give it a little oomph.

This soup was delish!  Of course I used what I had on hand.  Low sodium chicken broth, because I don't like celery didn't add it, and I don't do onions that much so I just used half of one.  Will be making this again.

Yum! I followed suggestions to mash instead of puree, to use a sweet yellow onion, and to substitute butter for the margarine. I had no chicken broth, so used beef broth instead, plus a pinch of salt. The soup was really flavorful and had a nice texture. We get a lot of broccoli in our CSA veggie box, so I'm sure this will become a favorite recipe!

Okay, so this recipe as is came out more like a broccoli stew than cream of broccoli soup.  (Way too much broccoli for my taste.)  I would probably cut the broccoli by 2-4 cups, just to get it creamier.  Hints: 1) Use chopped broccoli - it cooks faster.  2) DEFINITELY sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top (to taste) - it really adds something.  3) It tastes better the second day. Once I cut back on the broccoli, I'm sure this will be five stars.

Yum!  We love this.  We both agreed that whole pieces of broccoli were definitely in order, so I only pureed about half the broth/broccoli mixture.  Also, I had some heavy cream to use up, so I used 1 cup along with 1 cup of milk.  We threw in parmesan when it was nearly done cooking.

Yummm :) Did not change a thing and everyone enjoyed this from my hubby to my 11mo old. She really ate this up! Loved the bacon addition suggestion. I put some bread in the oven with butter and garlic salt just as a treat and used it to soak the bottom of the bowl. I will make this often. Great recipe.

This was wonderful! I used skim milk and low sodium broth and it was great.  I didn't have any onion on hand so I was worried about the flavor, but it still was delicious.  Next time I will definitely add it though.  I finished off with a generous helping of sharp cheddar cheese.  Will make again!

This soup took no time to make and came out delicious. I did not have celery on hand and did add a little bit more of flour and water to thicken it up, just a personal desire. I will next time double everything because with the four of us there was very little left.

Nice recipe, very tasty and the husband loved it. I altered it a little: I did not see the need to puree the soup, I just let it simmer for 10 or 15 mins. I also mixed 1 cup heavy cream with one cup skim milk and added that, instead of creating a rue with flour. I also tossed in a couple of tablespoons of shaker Parmesan cheese.

My family  (even my 4 y/o twin girls) liked this.  I substituted 1/2 cup of hale & half and added about 1/4 c. of grated parm cheese. My husband reccommended leaving some florets not pureed.  I agree.  Nice for the cold weather!!

This soup is exactly what I was looking for in a cream of broccoli soup!!  I wanted a good base soup to make cheddar broccoli soup, and this turned out fantastic for that.  I made the soup exactly as the recipe stated except for the following modifications:  I used my food mill and "creamed" half of the recipe, leaving the other half chunky.  After the milk thickened, I added about a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and stirred this until melted, then added to the soup.  This is a keeper!

Very delicious.  My 13mo ate his whole bowl.  Instead of margarine I used real butter.  I also added cheddar cheese from grass fed cows and my own frozen chx stock.  Yum!

This was very good! Used 2 heads of broccoli, 2 c chicken stock, 1 c skim milk and sprinkled a bit of grated cheddar cheese. Also used the advice of one of a previous reviewer and didn't puree the broccoli. Just mashed it a bit and it still turned out great.

I thought the recipe was very good. But in the section where the roux is made, I added the celery, and garlic. After I added the milk I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup.
I also doubled the recipe and added 2lbs of velvetta block cheese, and a bag of shredded Monterey Jack & Colby cheese.
Being from the south, besides the salt & pepper, I also added a cajun seasoning we always use.

The only reason I give this 4 stars is because so many changes were necessary.  I did use MMONSIEGNEUR's suggestions, though I did puree about half of the broccoli and left some out for a more chunky soup.  I was a bit startled by the green coloring, but once I got past it, I fell in love with this recipe-  and I've never been a big fan of cream of broccoli!

Original recipe yields a very bland soup. However, as other reviews suggest, this can be used as a base, with other modifications (garlic, salt, cheese...) and it will come out nicely.

Sorry but this wasn't a fave among my family.  Though I loved the simplicity of it, the flavor was very bland.  And after adding various spices from Mrs Dash, to garlic when sauteeing the veggies, it still wasn't good.

This is an excellent soup, but if the directions are followed precisly, it is too thick.  I had to add about 1 1/2 cups of broth.  But other than that, this is my favorite broccoli soup recipe.

This broccoli soup is very easy and delicious. I find the flavor is fuller if I let it sit a while before we eat it.(20 minutes) Also, I season it with onion powder, celery salt, and LOTS of pepper for extra kick. A winner! Thanks Jesssie A.!

Yummy! But I did add about 6 slices of cheddar cheese to make sure it was creamy.  It was as good as any soup you could get at a fine restaurant.

This recipe is WONDERFUL. It is quite involved and requires much attention, but it is well worth it! I have made it for get-togethers and I receive nothing but compliments. I do only one thing different, I do not puree 2 cups or so of the broccoli and return it to the soup after it thickens. This makes for a lovely, chunky texture. YUMMY!!! If you like cream of broccoli soup, I highly encourage you to try this recipe. Take your time, don't rush it,(otherwise the roux will get lumpy) and you WILL NOT be disappointed.

This is a really easy and delicious soup - I've made it with both chicken stock and vegetable stock and both were delicious.  Even my 3 year old ate it up.

Mmm, so good! For variety I add a whole bunch of different vegetables each time so I don't get bored, because I make this a lot!

This was  a very good cream of broccoli recipe! We did not use the blender, just cut up small.
I also added 16 oz of velveeta cheese to the cream mixture before adding to the soup and it was 
great! I have other cheese variations but the cheese has a tendency to seperate, expecially when reheating.
The Velveeta works great for cheese flavor. I also doubled this recipe since we have a family of 5 and we all like
broccoli soup. It was very good and I will mostly definately make this one many more times :)

I had a few of my students make this recipe in high school food's class and it turned out great.  One group added a little  velveta cheese and it was great.  Very quick and easy.

This was a great recipe.  My husband and I love it.  I'm not much of a soup
maker but this was very easy.  I did add an extra cup of milk with
the flour and butter to thicken the soup.

I needed to cook the broccoli longer than 10 minutes, for approx 25, until very tender. I also used non-fat milk and corn starch instead of flour. DELICIOUS AND SIMPLE.

This was great!  I added some Velveeta cheese to make it a broccoli cheese soup.  I also did not puree it in a blender, I just crushed the broccoli with a potato masher.  This made it chunkier, which my family prefers.  Excellent!  Will make again.

I added an extra cup of milk and tablespoon of flour to extend the recipe.  I will be making this again but also adding an additional packet of chicken boullion for extra flavour.  Great and easy recipe!

This is great soup!! Very easy.  The only thing I'd do different is make it creamier.  But this soup is delicious and easy and filling and not too fattening.

I found this soup to be very good.  I added the stems of the broccoli (rather than composting them) seemed to work fine.
