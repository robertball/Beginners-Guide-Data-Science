I decided to try and make sangria for the first time for my annual cinco de mayo party.  I was a little hesitant at first because I was not sure which type of red wine to buy.  After deciding to use a merlot, I added lemons, limes, and oranges and pineapple.  I didn't have any cherries, so I left those out.  Everyone loved this so much that I wish I had doubled the recipe as it was gone in about 10mins.  Will make this one again.

I used Merlot wine and 2.5 cups of lemon-lime soda. For fruit, I used 1/2 pineapples, 1 apple, 1/2 lemon, 1/2 lime, 1/2 orange. It tasted WONDERFUL! I had to go out and buy more wine though because the recipe that is posted was enough for me to drink alone!!!

Thought this was pretty tasty. Added some bottled lime juice as well and served over ice. This was great for using some leftover red wine that I had.

This was excellent!  We made it on Thanksgiving day.  All the ladies loved it.  I suggest not to crush the oranges to avoid the pulp taste.

This is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I will always use this as my sangria drink.  As far as the fruits I added I used what was on hand.  I used lemon, orange, strawberries, and a jar of maraschino cherries.  It was so refreshing.  My husband and I drank the whole jug while he worked on the the car.  Will def make over and over.

I made the recipe adding a cup of orange juice.  The flavor of the sangria was great, but I thought it had too much citrus fruit in it.  Next time I think I may do half of the citrus fruit and add different fruit like mangos and melons instead.

This was an okay version of sangria, although I did change it up slightly.  In addition to the other ingredients listed, I added about 1 cup of orange juice and 3 oz of triple sec (or any orange flavoured liqueur you may have).  This added a lot of great flavour.

I give it a three-star for it's potent strength for a regular party.  But I'm experimenting for a wedding reception and I wouldn't want my relatives to fall over.  It taste just okay.  I added more OJ to the recipe.

Sangria had always eluded me until I saw this recipe.  Its a great balance of flavors and the pineapple is nice.

I didn't love this sangria.  Although I didn't have cherries and used canned pineapple instead of fresh.  I also used about half the sparkling water in the recipe but I thought it was still a bit watered down.  Maybe I should have added another bottle of wine?

I had to augment it with Grand Marnier and Brandy (1 1/2 shots each). I used tart cherries and dry wine.  My son liked it with a little OJ and some simple syrup. It packed a whollop!  Very pretty but my picture is too small to post.
