The directions here are spot on. Boiling the potatoes first is an important step to get the perfect consistency for shaping the tots. This is obviously more time consuming than just opening up a bag of frozen ones but these are fun to make and you  can control what spices go into them. I plan to play around with the flavors and even make spicy tots. I froze half of the batch to use at a later date and I am going to try baking them in the oven for a healthier alternative. I will update my review once I do.

Really, really good just as is. When frying potatoes, oil temp is very important to keep the oil from soaking into the potato. Make sure the temp stays above 350 while cooking. I set mine at 356 & cooked them for about 6 minutes. Doubled the recipe and it made about 45 tots

I questioned the amount of salt in the recipe. I should have listened to myself. Had to throw them away. Gagged from salt taste. Back to the drawing board for a better recipe

Thanks for the recipe!  Fun to make as part of our Christmas Day feast.  Made it as written, skeptical about them not breaking apart as they cooked, but they cooked up perfectly.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the 1 tbsp of salt called for.  I’m quite a saltaholic and even for me that was a bit much.  Next time I’ll cut back to just over a tsp.  Thanks again!!

Prepared this recipe staying as close as possible to the instructions.  It was spur of the moment so I used vegetable instead of peanut oil & they were still very good.  They passed the scrutiny of my 10 year old's expectations of her school's tater tots, which she loves!   I'm sure I will be making these again.

The first time I made these, the fault was mine: the oil wasn't at the correct temperature.
The second time however, it didn't work out as it should have.

Maybe making these again when I have a lot more patience.
