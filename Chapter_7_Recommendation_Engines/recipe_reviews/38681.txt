it's yummy! i substituted the chocolate with chocolate chips. i couldn't find buttermilk so plain yogurt was the next best alternative. however, i couldn't taste the orange, i could smell the orange from the oven but it was lost in my mouth. therefore, i plan to add orange extract the next time. 
awesome muffins. i baked it for valentines and my frens loved it. thanks!

Tops! A light subtle flavor with touches of chocolate suspended throughout the cake. Very subtle and sophistocated. I used butter instead of margarine and cooked miniature muffins. Each morsel is a gourmet's delight. The combination of chocolate/orange makes it a little tricky to identify the flavor. Enhances its gourmet  mystery.

instead of using grated chocolate, i used the cocoa powder conversion of three squares.  also, i used the one bowl method where i dumped everything in and mixed it up real good.  they still came out great!  with very little effort i got muffins that were very chocolatey with just the right amount of orange flavor.

We liked these muffins very much.  I have a food processor, so the grating of chocolate was a snap, but I could see it would be time consuming if grating by hand! I thought the orange and chocolate flavors blended well, and for those who would want more orange flavor I would suggest adding a bit more of the orange zest, that really brings the flavor out!  Thanks for a nice muffin recipe to add to my collection.

Either I did something wrong or the other reviews were written by the cook's relatives!  First of all I found it very tedious to grate all that chocolate.  The muffins turned out flat, greasy, & the texture was kind of mealy.  I used butter  instead of margarine and fresh squeezed orange juice because I thought it would have more orange flavor, but it didn't.  Don't know what went wrong, but considering the work involved in making them, I wouldn't bother to make them again.

This was a big let down. Did not care for them at all. Not enough orange flavor and not at all what you thought they were going to taste like. Yuck.

Nice orange flavor, we will be making these frequently.  We just put in half a bag of dark chocolate chips instead.

Excellent tasting but dry and dense.  Take out of oven sooner and use honey in recipe instead of sugar.

This were a big hit at church this morning. I used chocolate chips because I needed to make them fast and added an orange glaze made out of concentrated orange juice and powdered sugar as soon as they were done baking to add more orange flavor. As a side note I ended up with 16 muffins instead of 12.

i made these, but made them healthier.  they came out soooo good.  i used mostly whole wheat flour (combined with unbleached white flour).  i only had one egg, so i put it plus half a banana.  i didn't have any milk, so i put more orange juice.  and instead of margarine, i put apple sauce.  plus, i added a couple tablespoons of flaxseed meal (for extra nutrition) and walnuts.  the muffins came out so good, my husband and i, each, had 2 of them.  i would definitely make them again!

Very good.  The muffin is very light and moist, not dense and hearty. It has a delicate orange flavour.  Perfect amount of sweetness. It was very easy to make and took only 15 min to bake. I used milk chocolate chips instead (1 Cup) and I used butter instead of margarine. I will make again.  THX

I think these muffins would be better with some vanilla. Aside from the mild orange and chocolate tones, there just seems to be something missing. I might try subbing cocoa for the chocolate next time I make these, and adding some vanilla to give it a better taste.

These are very easy to make and soooooo good. I used chocolate chips and they worked great. I am embarrassed to say I ate three of them as soon as they were cool. My Mom will love these.

These were really good. I wish they would have had a bit more orange flavor, though. They were more chocolatey than orangey :) Also, grating the chocolate was VERY time-consuming. Wish I had a food processor!
The kids will love them, I'm sure!!

Good recipe. When I made this, I used 1 small fresh orange instead. Not enough orange flavor so next time I will use 2 oranges.  Batter turned out thick.

These muffins were really good, but also less sugary than most (add more sugar if you have a sweet tooth).  I used orange/pineapple juice, and a little milk soured with more juice, instead of orange juice.  I also used part brown sugar instead of all white.

Very nice recipe. I added vanilla and did not grate the chocolate, just chopped it. I liked them because they were not overly sweet. I baked them for 15 min. and it made 12 muffins. Thanks, nice recipe.

this is a great recipe. Instead of grating chocolate, I used mini chocolate chips. I made sure to cream the butter and sugar well, then mixed it a lot with the eggs to fluff everything up. The result was wonderful. They baked up beautifully to a perfect color and firm top.

yuk! The grated chocolate isn't good at all.  They are bitter from the orange.  Maybe they could be fixed by using powder chocolate, more sugar... I don't know.  Not worth my time to figure it out.  There are a lot of other recipes out there I would rather try instead.

I substituted 1/4 cup flour for cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey, and I added dried cranberries, but somehow, I couldn't taste the orange, chocolate, or cranberries.

These turned out great! Although I'm one of those people that substitute everything. So I subbed in brown sugar, olive oil, an entire blended orange and white chocolate chips. I also added hemp seeds. I would have given it five stars except I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

Delicious recipe!  Instead of the chocolate I used 12 tablespoons of cocoa, four tablespoons of sugar and six tablespoons butter.  For buttermilk I put a teaspoon of vinegar in half a cup of milk as well as adding two dollops of plain yogurt.  The batter was really thick when you put it in the pans but the muffins themselves were sort of light.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

My first batch following the recipe was disappointing: too dry and ripped apart when you peeled the liners off the muffins.  My second batch was very delicious and had a great texture with these changes. Many thanks to the reviewers for some of these ideas:
1. Preheat oven to 400 and prepare muffin pan with liners.
2. In a small bowl prepare the glaze, 2 tsp oj concentrate & 1 tsp powdered sugar.
3. Mix dry ingredients (2 cups all-purpose flour, 3/4 cups sugar (half brown sugar and half white sugar), 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp baking powder, no baking soda, 1 TBSP orange zest, 1 cup mini chocolate chips.
4. In a measuring cup, add 1/3 cup canola oil, 1 egg, 1/2 plain lofat yogurt, and fill to the 1 1/2 cup mark with orange juice (about 1/3 cup). Add 1/4 tsp orange extract.
5. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir just to moistened or almost moistened.  Okay to have little bits of flour unmixed. 
6. Fill muffins to top of liners and top with glaze.
7. Bake 15-20 until toothpick comes out clean
8. Let cool on rack for 10 minutes before removing from muffin tin.

Changed the recipe to what I had on hand in the house. Was out of buttermilk so 2 teaspoons of vinegar in the half cup then filled it the rest of the way with milk. Chocolate chips instead of grated squares. Butter instead of margarine. An orange marmalade instead of the juice and zest. Next time I might do half a cup instead of 1/4 thou, for more flavor.

This recipe was okay. It might be 4 stars if it had more flavor! The muffins just tasted plain and it was hard to taste the chocolate and orange, even though I doubled the chocolate amount and added orange extract. I might try these again but I will add more orange extract, orange zest, and chocolate!!

this is a very good recipe for muffins.i just added a little less sugar and i think that can be made of varied ingredients.the mixture turns out so well.
