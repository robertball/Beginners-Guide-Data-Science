Very good recipe, the vanilla was a tad overwhelming, I suggest using 1/2 teaspoon instead of a full teaspoon.

I had a little bit of peach-mango-passion sherbet left in the freezer, so I used it instead of the orange sherbet, otherwise, followed the directions.  I had concerns that it would be too sweet with the 10xx sugar in it, but it provided the perfect amount of sweetness and did not overwhelm.  Don’t just think “summer/hot weather” for this; at least in this house it’ll be served all year.  The texture was spot on, and the serving amount just what we were looking for.  Bright & fresh with a good pop of citrus.
