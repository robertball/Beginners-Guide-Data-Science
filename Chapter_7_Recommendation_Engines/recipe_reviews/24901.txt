Great recipe.  Keeps well in the fridge, and only improves.  As a former cook in a wing place, I can tell you this: Don't try to sneak in low fat mayo or sour cream. (I've tried) Find another recipe that calls for them.   A small dash each of wostershire, tabasco, fresh lemon juice, and a small crushed clove of garlic will really brighten up the flavor. I also add about 50% more cheese than called for and leave it in bigger chunks.  Definately let it sit for a day or two before serving.  That makes all the diffrence.

I've been looking for a creamy blue cheese dip ever since I ordered chips and dip from room service at a five star hotel in New Orleans and received ruffles and a homemade blue cheese dip.  Believe it or not it was a great combination with a simple potato chip and a tangy dip.  This recipe emulates that dip perfectly.  I have to admit I'm not a big fan of mayonaise but I used the exact amount in the recipe and it made it nice and creamy.

We held a 'taste test' with this and a recipe from another site. This one was by far the winner! The only change we made was to sub a quarter cup of fresh parsley for the two tablespoons dried. Aging for a few days really does improve the flavor, if you can make yourself stay away from it long enough! My husband, the blue cheese fanatic, was in heaven when he tasted this. Thank you for a perfect recipe!

So good!  Made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer buffet two years in a row & have been ordered to make it again next year!  Definitely use high quality bleu cheese ~ makes a dramatic difference in flavour.  I used reduced fat sour cream but full fat mayo ~ had a wonderful creamy texture.  Also, I highly recommend making it at least a day in advance to allow the flavours to meld.  We liked this best w/veggies (cherry tomatoes, red bell pepper, and celery in particular).

FANTASTIC dip if you like blue cheese! Definitely let it sit overnight if time allows. I used finely chopped red onions (to taste) instead of green and it still tasted great. Add a little milk and you'll have great salad dressing!

Great recipe.  Be aware that it makes a ~lot~ so you may want to halve it.  Also, you can control the level of blue cheese in the dip by just adding more or less of it.  I added more than the recipe called for, and it gave the dip a richer blue cheese taste; it did taste perfectly fine before the addition though.  Fantastic, will definitely make this again.

Update: I have made this dip almost every holiday for my FIL, Father's Day also of course! This recipe has become one of my 'go to' recipes. This time I modified a bit. Couldn't get to the store so I used 1/2 a bottle of blue cheese dressing in lieu of the chucks and I didn't add the mayo. Turned out really good! Original review: I love blue cheese, and so does my FIL. I made this for him for tomorrow for an appetizer. I tasted-tested it and I thought it was really good! I am serving with blue corn chips. Did not add the green onions, subbed a pinch of onion pwdr. Sprinkled with garlic bread seasoning instead of garlic salt.

This dip is excellent!  I had to make it twice in one weekend because it was so popular.  Was great with wings.  Makes a great thick salad dressing too.  Thanks for this recipe!

To intensify this recipe, use the "wedge" Blue Cheese, not the pre crumbled. Use 1/3 of the wedge and smash into the mayo and sourcream, adding about an ounce of milk. Smash well to make a "slurry." Crumble the next 1/3 of the cheese into dime size bits and the 3rd, 1/3 of the cheese into nickle and quarter sizes. Add 1 tsp of Japanese gourmet vinegar and mix all. This gives more depth of taste. Add more milk to entire finished mixture if you want a great salad dressing. [It's the "slurry"that "pops" the flavor up a few notches.]

Loved this dip!!  Definitely use the best blue cheese (not the precrumbled stuff) you can find and make it a day in advance to let the flavor develop.  Everyone at the party wanted this recipe, including the men!!

This gets 5 out of 5!  Its amazing, easy to make, relatively cheap, and very versatile in its application --veggies, wings, chips, you name it!  I went for danish blue cheese which I found to be less creamy and easy to crumble... i'm by no means a blue cheese expert, but from eyeballing in the supermarket, this seemed like the best option.  I also used light mayo (PC brand for those of you north of the 49th), and light sour cream and it was still excellent and not lacking by any means.  The yield is quite large so be forewarned... this is a dip for a large party.  if you're planning a smaller event, and don't want leftovers, definitely decrease the quantities.

Taste was good but I used this recipe because it sounded thick and chunky.  It was at first, but after a few hours in the fridge it turned completely watery.  Very disappointing, especially since I doubled the amount of bleu cheese chunks called for in the recipe.

Loved this! I made one change - instead of using sour cream, I used plain yogurt. Turned out fabulous.

I served this recipe with both chips and with buffalo wings, and got RAVE reviews.  Everyone just loved it.  Thanks to the submitter!  Definately a keeper.

First time I followed the recipe exactly and thought that it was ok. Then I modified it: 1) cut the mayo and sour cream in half, 2) replaced garlic salt by garlic powder (remember, that blue cheese is very salty 3) added a lot of chopped fresh dill. With my modifications, it was the best dish on my holiday table.

Very, very good with the Restaurant-Style wings recipe. Cooked them for Super Bowl 2011 and used this dip... extraordinary! The better the blue cheese, the better this will be. Spend a little extra on really good blue cheese (bleu), it's worth it! In California there are a number of SF Bay Area dairies producing some awesome blue cheeses locally. Point Reyes Original Blue is one of the best I have ever had and would make this a very tasty dip.

This dip really is a great basic recipe.  I usually make it and add extra blue cheese, because i really like blue cheese.  I leave out the dried parsley simply because i do not care for it, instead i add some fresh black pepper. You definitely need to let it sit overnight to let the flavors marry!  Once the flavors are able to come together it is AMAZING.  If you try to eat it right after you put it together you will lose the full effect of what the flavors can be.   Also, you want to use real mayonnaise and not salad dressing.  The salad dressing will make it watery and it will not hold together.

This is really an amazing dip.  I really, really, really do not like blue cheese but made this because my husband loves it and we both can't stop eating it.  I used Maytag blue cheese which is somewhat pricey but well worth it!

This is very good. I let it chill at LEAST 12 hrs before serving (24 hr mark seems perfect). To get rid off the mayo taste and make it creamier, add 1 tsp of white vinegar and problem solved!! I use fresh minced garlic! The longer it chills the better the blend of flavors!

This was very good. Had a deep flavor. Not like standard onion dip. I served this with Buffalo flavored kettle chips. Great contrast. It was a huge hit. Thanks!

Awesome! Added a bit of milk to get a thinner consistency for dipping wings and veggies. Also used garlic powder instead of salt as I find cheese always adds enough sodium for my taste.

I first made this recipe for Christmas.  It is by far the best blue cheese dip I have had.  It's very simple, doesn't take much time.  The only changes I've made are adding extra blue cheese which is just a personal preference.  Also, I only add about one and a half Tbs. of dried parsley.  My dip is a thick consistency, and doesn't get watery.  Lasts several days in the refrigerator.  Make sure to make this a day ahead to let flavors meld.  Also, make sure to use green onions, the taste is essential to this recipe!

This was excellent.. my only change was to eliminate the green onion, due to the fact i needed this to be more of a condiment and not a dip.. i was afraid that upon storing in frig for several days that the green onions would change taste or consistency too much so I used a small amout of dried onion.. my husband would definitely eat this as a dip.. a couple tablspoons of milk and you'd have dressing.. im using it to eat with meat.. I'm a low carber...thanks

I really enjoyed this and my guests seemed to like it too.   Could be mixed with a bit of milk (or buttermilk/cream) and used as a homemade blue cheese dressing.

This was a good dip.  We put it on burgers the next day.  I let it sit 24 hours before serving as suggested and that seemed to be perfect.

I've made this recipe twice...the first time almost as written. I used fresh minced garlic instead of powdered garlic. I tasted it right away and all I could taste was mayo. Then a few hours it was better, and the next afternoon it was wonderful, but a bit too much onion. The second time I tried this recipe I cut the onion down to just 2 green onions but I used fat free mayo...it was not good! I could not get past the gelatin texture. I ended up throwing the whole thing out. I will definately make this again using REAL mayo!

Everyone loved this dip, everyone that loves blue cheese that is.  I served it with cucumbers, broccoli, carrots, turnips, celery, and pearl onions.  That's right, pearl onions!  All the folks we hang with love onions, even all our kids.

I liked this dip/dressing. It was really thick at first. Unfortunately, after a few hours in the fridge, it got thinner. The follow day it was the consistency of salad dressing. Still tasted fabulous, if not better! My only other complaint is it has too strong of an onion flavor. That could be due to the green onions I had. I thought they were a little strong to begin with because they made me cry when I was cutting them, which is not something I find typical with green onions. All this said, I will absolutely be making this again!

Divine. Use the good blue cheese (solid piece, not crumbles) and use a bit extra (or cut mayo & sour cream back a little). A clove of fresh garlic minced is better than the salt.

Awesome recipe!! Only change for me was adding a little more blue cheese ( about 2oz ) and putting it in my food chopper. It made this recipe a little thicker and creamier. Also, I double the green onion just because I like green onions :) EVERYONE loved it and wanted more when it was gone!

it's a sort of tzaziki with a northern twist... very good with chips or veggies, it's not to die for. As everyone else said, it's better to let it sit for at least 24 hours. I also agree on using much more blue chesse: I quite love it and in my opinion you failed to taste its presence among the green onion and all.

Yum! This is exactly how I like my blue cheese dip. I used fresh parsley instead of dried, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. We had this with fruit, veggies, and hot wings. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh.. my.. goodness.  Fabulous.  I added just a tiny bit of white wine vinegar as per other cooks but everything else was exactly as called for.  I made this to go with buffalo wings and made the mistake of tasting it the day before I made the wings- hardly had any left for the wings because I dipped every other dip-able thing I had into this stuff:  veggies, chips, and finally wings.  It really does taste best after about 3 days chilling, no joke.  Thanks SO much for this one!

Theresa from Nov 2, 2009 rating - Did you let is sit in the fridge for a day? I've made this at least 20 times and never had that problem but I always make it the day before.

This was incredible! 
I read the reviews where some people thought the mayo was a bit much and that would have bothered me so, I measured maybe 3 tablespoons less than one cup and then replaced the missing mayo with heavy cream. I also had fresh parsley and the minced garlic in a jar so I used those instead of dried and I only used 3 scallions because it just looked like I had plenty when I'd chopped that much.
It did need the 24 hours to sit for the flavors to blend but I disagree with the people who said 2 days was better. I thought the 24 hours was exactly right though it was still pretty good the next day. I served it with both celery sticks and the extra thick wavy potato chips from Cape Cod and it was really great.
I have a new favorite dip.

I was making Restaurant-Sytle Buffalo Chicken Wings (from this site) and I needed some kind of Blue Cheese Dip.  I saw this one and had all the ingredients it called from so I tried it.  This is a KEEPER and so were the wings.

This was good, but too much mayo and the dip felt SO heavy.  Probably will not make again or maybe substitute Miracle Whip for the mayo.

A real party favorite. This was a big hit. A do over recipe. I cut back about 1/4 of a cup of mayo so as not to over power it with the mayo flavor.

If you look in my review box, I have never given 3 stars before, this dip just did not do it for me, or anyone at the party (about 30 people).  The dip just sat there.  I followed the directions to a "T" and it just was Blah.  I would have been better off just opening a jar of Marie's Extra Chunky salad dressing.  There are much better recipes out there in my honest opinion, sorry.

Good enough.  Made 1/4 of the recipe just to try it.  Will make again.  Needs to sit before it tastes good.  Left out the salt for personal preference.

Saw this recipe and thought it would go well with the Baked Chicken Wings from this site. Not a fan of blue cheese, thought others would enjoy it. Used gluten-free "Spectrum Organic Mayonnaise". Made this the day before to let flavors meld. Surprisingly, I was the one who could not get enough. Really enjoyed with celery sticks as well as with wings. Thanks for a good, good recipe!

You wouldn't believe how good this is!! You should definitely follow the reviews that suggest you make it ahead of time. I think plain greek yogurt could be subbed for some of the sour cream/mayo.

This is really a great basic dip. i leave out the garlic salt, i use a PINCH of garlic powder. i use 1/2 to 3/4 c of MAYO and 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 c sour cream. you definitely need to use MAYO for this, miracle whip/salad dressing is completely different and will just water it down, that could be what is giving some the watery results. I add freshly ground black pepper and add extra blue cheese, we like the flavor of blue cheese. Definitely let it sit for a day, or overnight if possible.  Also great for dipping with anything, from chips, veggies, or topping on a potato.

Great flavor, but use STRONG tasting blue cheese. Mine might have been too cheap, the flavor didn't come out enough even 24 hours in the fridge.

Excellent!  Minor substitutions included light sour cream, one grated garlic clove, and since I was out of parsley, I added a few ribbons of celery greens.  I am looking forward to tasting the leftovers after a day in the fridge.

This is pretty good. I'm not sure that I cared for all the dried parsley and would probably use fresh next time. I've eaten it with pretzels and will probably try some on a salad as well. I left out the green onions, as I didn't have any.

I was looking for a basic blue cheese dip and this was perfect. I used a hunk of real Roquefort, fresh minced garlic, and added lots of ground black pepper and a tablespoon or so of fresh chopped rosemary. I also used light mayo and light sour cream so that it wasn't so very heavy.

Perfect blue cheese dip, really.  I made two mistakes (ENTIRELY MY FAULT NOT THE RECIPES).  I upped the blue cheese and still added salt.  Very stupid because it turned out way too salty. Made it again without adding salt and it was wonderful (I added more cheese due to personal taste)and I added a bit less mayo.  Excellent, highly recommended even if you're on a diet, hahahaha!

Made this dip for a football tailgate and it was delicious.  I did use slightly more blue cheese (about 6 oz).  Served it with hot wings, celery and carrots.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I first made it several years ago, and many people have asked me for the recipe since then.  It tastes best if you make it several days in advance, and leave it in the refrigerator to "age" and let the flavors blend properly.  YUMMY!

This recipe has been a hit for the past two years at Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my guests just loved it (even those that don't normally enjoy blue cheese).  This dip is great with vegetables and different kinds of crackers.  My personal favorite combination is dipping Cheez-Its in this dip.  Blue corn chips dipped in this dip also taste very yummy.  Enjoy!

This was very good.  I added about 2 oz. more blue cheese to it (6 oz total), some cayenne pepper and 2 cloves of garlic (through a garlic press), instead of garlic salt for an added kick.  Everyone at the dinner where this was served raved about it.

This is a FANTASTIC dip!  Its funny to ready how different it comes out for people. My motto, you get what you pay for.  Buy a good mayo, good sour cream and good blue cheese (I use a 5oz container),use only MINCED green onions and include part of the green chive part and must make the night before!!  Everyone loves it that likes blue cheese.  Dill (I use dried) is an excellent addition!! Thanks Lisa!

This recipe is a keeper.  I made the night before, let the ingredients blend and the next day, it was even better than I had expected.  I took it to an xmas party and it was gone before I left.   The only adjustment I made was by using dried chives rather than fresh g.onions and a (big) pinch of dried red onion.  It turned out fabulous.

Excellent!  We liked it with crusty bread instead of chips.  Needs atleast 8 hours of chilling.  The longer the better!  I used red onion finely chopped and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  Yum!

Excellent! Simple! Easy and quick to prepare! I added extra blue cheese crumbles and made the night before to blend flavors. Served with crackers. I took this to an office holiday party and several people asked me for the recipe!

Excellent recipe - was a big hit at a recent party, and even with those who are not-so in love with blue cheese.  Yum!  Thank you very much.

This is the best blue cheese dip that I have ever had.  I made this for a party and served it with corn chips.  My guests could not pull themselves away fom it.  I used leftover dip as a salad dressing for dinner and it was delicious.  This dip makes a better salad dressing than any fancy restaurant's.  Can't wait to try it with buffalo wings.

I made this recipe when I was in Australia where there is no blue cheese dressing/ dip anywhere.  My friends and I used for the buffalo wings, which we also had to "create."  This is great.  It has a nice thick consistency and feels so decadent.  I added more blue cheese to make it chuckier, but it was also fine without.

This was a great dip, I served it with snack crackers. It had a great blue cheese flavor, but I think you would like it even if you weren't big on blue cheese.

This is an excellent recipe, but I would make it the night ahead to give the flavors time to blend. It is good with veggies, bread, crackers, or my kids were even dipping fritos into it!

It tastes delicious but turned all watery but when  went to put it out after it had been refrigerated for a few hours it was all watery. I did use fresh parsley instead of dried and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

Couldn't be easier and very tasty. However, like another reviewer said, it turns quite thin after sitting overnight and is no longer the consistency needed for a dip. So I'd suggest not making it more than a few hours ahead of using.

I loved this!!! So did my husband although he said he’d prefer a little less of the onion. I also put it in my food processor for a smoother consistency. Best dip I have made yet! I will be making this again and I served this along side buffalo wings and celery sticks.

I made no  changes to this recipe which sat in the refrigerator for 12 hours or so before serving it with cut vegetables to my "stitchers" group.   Everyone loved the dip!  I now will never worry that I am not getting enough vegetables.

This dip was a big hit at work . I had to alter the recipe some based on my available ingredients. I could not find green onions, so I used diced Vidalia instead. I used cilantro in place of the parsley as that was what I had at home. I don't own garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and sea salt. I like this better as it allows me to be a little heavy with the garlic and not have to worry about the salt.  I made two containers of this, one for work and one for home, it was a big hit in both places. For work I brought in Utz rippled potato chips, they went really well with the dip. At home, we tried the dip with Ritz roasted vegetable crackers and they were a perfect marriage to the flavor of the dip. ?I will be making this again.

I made this as a dip for a veggie tray.  It was DELICIOUS!  I did make a couple tweaks - I used a very high quality block of danish blue cheese.  I used a freshly minced clove of garlic, added some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  I also used fresh parsley.  Based on another reviewer's suggestions, I also added a dash of worchestershire and a bit of cajun seasoning (instead of hot sauce, which I didn't have.)  I think it was amazing!  It was chunky and thick, but could probably be thinned with some heavy cream or milk to use as a salad dressing - think: Wedge.

Soon glad I chose this one to be my Super Bowl Sunday dip.  Awesome.  Too bad I wasn't organized enough to make it a day early as it just gets better.  The problem is though that once its made, it doesn't stay around long enough to sit!
Followed the recipe as advertised, as I'll do again and again!

I did not have the dried parley/herbs so just added more green onion and a dash of Garlic Plus. I was very pleased with the results. I will make this again! I served it with veggies and crisp chips.

I tried to sneak in light sour cream and the result was a runny dip.  I learned my lesson - use the real stuff!

The taste is amazing, but I was really disappointed after day 2 it was very watery and lost all its thickness.

Great flavor. Got a little runny in the fridge the second day the last time I made it, but I used the lowfat mayo, so that might've had something to do with it. This is the ONLY blue cheese dip I like.

Not my regular recipe, which I cannot find(Rival Wing It! recipe is THE best!!!). This was way too sweet! Too much mayo. Having to tweak it to get the sweetness toned down. Perhaps a drop or two of Frank's Hot Sauce. Won't be making this again!

I make a lot of dips for events at friend's houses. This dip seems to be the favorite out of all of them. Its best served with carrots or celery.

This was a very good dip. My guy loves blue cheese and celery with his wings that I made, also from this site. I only added MORE blue cheese and only because he likes it sooo much. Thank you for making me a hero for a day!

Wow this is really amazingly good! I added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and parsley just cause I like those flavors. It was so good even when I first made it.  Hope it lasts till the party tomorrow!! Thanks for the recipe. It is in my favorites!

The dip tastes amazing but when left in the fridge for a few hours gets very,very runny. Disappointing as I needed this for a dip, it is more like a dressing for salad. I could not use it and was very disappointed.

I made the recipe pretty much as written, except used 6 ounces of cheese and garlic power instead of garlic salt.  I made it two days ahead and the consistency was perfect; the taste superb.

This is an awesome dip!!  Letting it marinate overnight is non-negotiable, tastes 100 times better the next day.  I used a clove of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt, and served with blue tortilla chips, corn chips, celery and cherry tomatoes.  Big hit with both adults and kids at the Christmas party!!  Makes a pretty presentation with all the colors too...

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The green onions are a nice addition. I did make mine with low-fat sour cream and mayo. Great dip for carrots, celery, red peppers and broccoli.

Made as directed except for onions. Seemed like a lot. After a day in the fridge, I also added 1/2 tsp. lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. worcester sauce and 1/4-1/2 tsp. tabasco sauce. This was so good,we were looking for more food (after the wings were gone) to put it on.

I think this adds way too much mayo.  The mayo flavor was overpowering but I used reduced fat may so that could be why.  I added more sour cream to balance things out.  Next time I may use yogurt and sour cream and less of the mayo.

My husband absolutely loves this dip! It definitely needs to be made ahead as the flavor becomes better with age. I thought the mayo would be overwhelming but it made it all the more creamy and the green onions added the perfect flavor to balance the blue cheese! I make this every get together and people ask for more!

Did the job ok - flavor-wise. Found it to be a little too thick - had to add more mayo & sour cream to lessen the thickness of the sauce.

Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!!!
We ate it as dip with chips first then I added more blue cheese and a little milk to thin it and ate it with buffalo wings the next night. It was even better the next night after the flavors blended.
Definitely the best;)

When I tasted this dip after I made it I was unsure how it was going to turn out.  After refrigerating overnight I was quite pleased.  It got many compliments.  I used it for wings and veggies at my Super Bowl party.  I also followed the suggestions in the reviews to add the vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, this is so good! I used fresh parsley in replacement of the dried and chopped everything up super fine. Added a capful of white vinegar to cut the mayo taste. The flavors had meshed after a few hours, I think because I chopped things up small. Man, this is perfect!

Great dip for Blue Cheese lovers.  We dipped tortilla chips and pretzles in it.  I will make this again when we have hot wings.  I added a tad more blue cheese and a little less mayo.

I make this for every event we have in our home. It is terrific with sliced veggies. Not a health food, but a tasty treat.  This MUST be made a couple of days ahead of time. It tastes much better after setting up in the fridge.

This dip is awesome!  The only change I made was I put just a little over a cup of sour cream to drown out any extra mayo taste. Served this with Buffalo Ranch Doritos on the 4th of July...big hit - can't wait to try it on a grilled burger or hot wings next time!

This was excellent!  My husband loves anything blue cheese so this was an appetizer with chips and veggies on Father's Day.  I added additional blue cheese because we love that flavor.  My husband had a great idea, so we are using the left overs by putting it on burgers tonight for dinner.

I took this to a party and it was a great hit. I loved it, and will be making it again this year. It's so simple to make and tastes like you've spent hours on it.  It's one I'd be happy to serve to company. 

I served it with corn chips, and used real mayo.

It was ok. Not bad, but not delicious either. It contains so much saturated fat that I don't think I'll make it again.

You must LOVE blue cheese to be a fan of this dip.  And my husband and I most certaily are fans!  I used more blue cheese than the recipe called for, and since I didn't have scallions, I used finely choped white onion.  We let the dip sit like the submitter requested.  First we tried it with crackers, then I brought out baby carrots, celery, and mushrooms.  We so much preferred it with the veggies over the crackers.  We are going to try this again with more veggies, like broccoli and snow peas in the pod.

I made this for a Boxing Day (December 26) treat for my friends as I'm an American living in Northern Ireland, and blue cheese dip/dressing is not something you would ever come across here.  I'd forgotten how delicious some of the most basic American 'party cuisine' can be! Cheers!

This was an ok dip.  I am not sure if it would have been better with a particular type of blue cheese or if real mayo is better than salad dressing?...  The longer the dip rested the more thinner the consistency.  I will not make again :(

Awesome dip!  Noone really tried it at the party.  I don't know if they new what it was and there was so much other food!  Although we did eat it for the next 3 days, and it is so addicting!!  I also added 1/2 tsp. cayenne, I love spicy food.  Also ate leftovers on a ham sandwich and was awesome also.  I am going to make another batch and try as dressing, with buffalo wings and celery.  Best dip I've ever tasted!  Great also with crackers!

I really liked this dip. I was skeptical at first because I had never used blue cheese before and I didn't like the smell of it in the 4oz container I bought. It is true that the longer it sits the better. I refrigerated it overnight and it was wonderful the next day and even better the day after that. I served this on Christmas Eve with corn chips and veggies. My guests liked it too. I did use only 2 green onions instead of 4 but that was only because the green onions I bought were really big. I would definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and left out the dried parsley.  It was good with raw vegetables.  Definitely better after two days in the refrigerator.

A hit at a dinner party! I tinkered with the recipe a bit in order to please my blue cheese loving guests. I doubled the amount of blue cheese, added carmelized onions and roasted garlic. Garlic powder never does it for me- ick. The garlic is very mild after roasting and leaves an awesome flavor.
The dip was a delight and scarfed down!

Very easy, and very good.  It is great with vegetables, bread, and chips.  Spend the (little bit of) extra time making this instead of buying pre-made dip---it is worth it!

SOOOOO easy to make and very yummy. You have to be a fan of blue cheese to truly enjoy this dip. I served it at my daughter's birthday and it was gone in a flash!

I have made this several times and it is excellent as a dip and salad dressing!  Since blue cheese is salty, I use 1 tsp. of garlic powder instead of the garlic salt.

Definitely a VERY tasty and yummy dip! :9  Very easy to make! I'd serve celery sticks with this dip as well as with the corn chips as it would go well with them.  Heck, even with buffalo wings I'd say. I'd make this again and again!

Great recipe - works well with potato or corn chips, veggies chicken wings, and I even used it as a sauce for a Mexican buffet.  Fabulous!  This is now a signature dip for any party I host or am invited to.
