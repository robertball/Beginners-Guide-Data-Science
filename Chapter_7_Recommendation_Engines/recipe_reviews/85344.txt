This drink was a major hit at a recent party I threw. We had a menu of about 15 drinks but EVERYONE had this drink all night. I made about 100 of them!! After a few I decided to throw it all into a blender and add a little extra ice and some shredded coconut...amazing! Great drink recipe. I will include them at all of my parties!

A unique drink. I didn't know what hazelnut liqueur was so for sure so I used a Hazelnut kahlua. I think the thicker texture surprised me the most... almost like a 2% milk? A different drink for every now and then:)
