I've never been a big fan of potato salads, but this one is excellent.  I used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise (personal preference) and added about half a teaspoon of sugar, and it turned out great.  Rich, creamy, and full of flavor.  I'll definitely be bringing this to summer barbeques!

too much dressing for the amount of potatoes.  i also added more traditional potato salad stuff like eggs, onion, celery, pickle relish.  Otherwise it was very good, very dilly.

This potato salad is very good, especially if you like dill. I added a little chopped red onion and a couple of chopped hard-boiled eggs, which made it even better.

Very good salad...with a few changes I made.  I used miracle whip (1/4 C) and sour cream (1 C) instead of the mayo (makes it lighter and fluffier and adds zest) and regular mustard instead of Dijon.  Also, I didn't add the vinegar to the dressing, but instead sprinkled it over the hot potatoes when they were done cooking.  That way, it soaks into the potatoes to give them more flavor.  Also added diced onion and garlic powder along with some freshly ground pepper.  Yummy!

This potato salad rocks!  Next time I'll use a bit less vinegar (just a personal taste), but overall this is great potato salad.  I love the dill!

This was great but only because I added the following:
1 tbsp mayonnaise ( was just enough)
1/3 cup Green onions
2 tbsp Honey mustard
4 pickles chopped up
4 eggs chopped up
2 celery chopped up
2 tbsp paprika 

Delish! 
I also used 8 small red potatoes and left the skin on and cut into chunks, it was much easier and faster this way and looked great too!.

Very very tangy. I omitted celery salt because I didn't have any.  I did add just a tad more mustard and 4 eggs.  I'm taking it to a church function tomorrow, and won't know until then how it will be received, but I like it.  It was easy to prepare.  I love vinegar and everything vinegar, so it was perfect for me.

No celery salt, reduced mayo, added sour cream, chopped onion, chopped hard-boiled egg.  Finally, a yummy potato salad I can enjoy that doesn't call for pickles!  The dill flavor is sooooo good! Keeper, definitely.

Super tangy and lovin' it! I did as someone suggested by substituting balsamic vinegar and finely chopped celery. 

As a caveat, don't overboil the potatoes like I did, otherwise you'll have smashed potatoes on your hands instead of a "salad".

I loved this b/c it had no egg chunks and it was very dilly; my husband felt it was missing something.  We added bacon bits (real), radish (shaved via mandolin), and scallions which made it that much better.  I felt that it was a lot of dressing for the amount of potatoes called for, so it was not a big deal to make a few extra potatoes.

A very good, simple recipe. I wanted to make potato salad at the last minute but didn't have the usual ingredients like onion and celery and this was a great alternative!  Very easy. I modified by using a bit less mayonnaise because that is the way my husband and I like potato salad.

I needed a potato salad without eggs snd chose this one because I had everything on hand. I didn't use the full amount of vinegar, just added it until I got the taste I wanted. My husband who's not a great potato salad fan said he could eat a bucketful of this. Many Thanks.

This was pretty good, but I found I had to doctor it quite a bit. (I added some zesty Italina dressing, chopped up pickles, celery, and red onion, ect.) I was tasty though, and every one seemed to like it.

This is a good starter recipe. I used about 20 baby red-skinned potatoes and found that 1/4c vinegar was still far too much. I would use about half of the vinegar. Rather than adhering to the suggested amount of mayo, I suggest squirting mayo over the potatoes, stirring and adding more to taste. I also used spicy brown mustard. Adding pickles, celery and about4-5 hard boiled eggs really enhanced the salad. Yummy!

I liked it and it was SUPER easy to make.  I did think it was just a bit too tangy ...  I like tangy but this was just a little to much.  All - in - all I liked it but in small doses.
