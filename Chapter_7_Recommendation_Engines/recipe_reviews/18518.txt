I've ever only tried "sugar" fudge recipes that require heating on the stove and making sure that nothing is burning.  With the cheese in this recipe, you don't have to do that, and it saves a great deal of time. It also results in a smooth texture that delicious flavor. One pointer though...it is ALOT easier to work with making one batch of fudge, and not a double batch as this recipe is scaled for. If you're trying this for the first time, divide it in half, and then go at it.

I made this once and it turned out terrible so I tried it again figuring that I had done something wrong.  But no, it is just really bad.  It tastes something like mac and cheese with cocoa.  Save yourself the time and trouble.

I forgot in my earlier review to state you do NOT have to cook this fudge -- just mix it. Also, use no-salt butter.

This is an excellent recipe.  It makes a very smooth, creamy and chewy fudge.  It reminds me of fudge I've gotten from bakeries.  It does makes huge amounts, so halve it unless you're cooking it for a big party.  It works best if you sift your confectioners sugar and cocoa to get rid of lumps.  It's easy to make, but does require lots of stirring.  It gets stiff very quickly, so I wound up kneading it with my hands.  I took it to a party and everyone raved over it.  I do think it's best not to tell people what is in it until they've made their mind up about it.  Some people are very suggestible, and if you tell them it has cheese in it, the cheese will be all that they taste.  Otherwise, you really don't notice the cheese.  I used Velveeta and it worked nicely.

Greasing the pan is not necessary. Like the original recipe says: Do NOT tell people the "secret" ingredient until AFTER they have tasted it. Trust me!
This is an awesome recipe!! Thanks!

This recipe was ok. It was very easy and quick to make but the flavor/texture was another story. I was a little bit "iffy" about the whole cheese thing, but the end product didn't really taste like cheese at all!  However, it did taste kind of strange.  I made it for a party yesterday and didn't get any of the rave reviews that other reviewers talked about.  People mostly commented that it had a strange texture and a strange taste that they couldn't put their finger on.  

So, while the fudge wasn't BAD, it wasn't great either.

This fudge did come together as it should, and it hardened like fudge, but it DID taste like processed cheese.  Out of 6 diners, it was nearly inedible, noone liked it and all thought it tasted like cheese.

I have always been a failure when it came to making fudge.  This receipe was so easy, and the final product is the best fudge ever! I plan to make the fudge as a "sweet" gift for friends and co-workers for Christmas.  Thanks for the GREAT receipe.

I would recommending on halving this recipe. Also, it takes a strong arm to mix it in to shape. But very good in the end. I agree on using velvetta cheese.

It tasted like cheese when I tasted it without it cooling all the way, howeve, after refrigerating it, it just tastes like (delicious!) fudge. We cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton of fudge. We'll be eating this for a while...

WOOZERS! You can't taste the Velveeta. This makes an easy, perfect fudge. Use unsalted butter and a really good quality cocoa. Used my kitchenaid to mix. Everyone really liked it.

I did half the  recipe, as suggested. Keeping the heat on low the whole time. It took longer than 20 minutes for the cheese and butter to become smooth (more like 40 minutes). I also poured the mixture out onto wax paper, thinking it would work for me. I should have put it in a pan, as it was too thin the way I did it. The flavor was awesome though. Thanks for the recipe!

This was not spreadable. It looks like it's trying to escape from my pans because it's trailing up the sides from where I had to wipe it off the spoon and shake it etc. Furthermore, my husband said the consistency is "weird", without having a clue that it has Velveeta in it. Maybe I should have turned the heat back up after adding in the powdered sugar? I don't know, it was so hard to stir at that point that I figured it'd burn if I turned it up. 1 star :(

(I was forced against my will to give this recipe a star, but I want you to know that if I could I would rate this NEGATIVE 5 STARS)

The kids like it. But they don't count -

WOW! This was seriously the best and most creamy fudge I've ever had! My hubby actually made this recipe. He thought I was crazy to even suggest it and he was very heistant because he LOVES his own fudge recipe! But he LOVED IT as well! We didn't tell anyone what was in it and they all loved it as well. After we told them the secret ingredient they didn't believe us and kept on eating it! We 1/2 the recipe down and I recommend doing that as well! VERY easy to make! This is definitely going on the Christmas plates! Thanks for a great fudge recipe!!

We cut this recipe in half. We melted the cheese and butter in the microwave then followed the recipe exactly. Next time we will melt the cheese first then add the butter for a smoother consistency. Our final product was YUMMY!!!!

This fudge was delicious! I suggest halving the recipe; as is, it makes an enormous amount of fudge. I wasn't able to taste the cheese but it makes it very smooth and rich. Yum!

This was a mess to make. Confectionary sugar was hard to sift with the cocoa. The velveeta was hard to smooth out with the butter and all and all it was like milk chocolate , not rich in chocolate. I was disappointed. Also, it is expensive to make. I would not make it again.

Sounded good from some of the reviews, however this recipe was just awful.  You cannot moisten 4 lbs or sugar with the cheese and butter mixture.  Maybe it should read 4 cups. It was so hard to mix and turned out as hard as a brick and that is without nuts.  What of waste of food and time.

I've made this recipe twice and have given it out at work.  Everyone loved it. Both times I halved the recipe. I was given the suggestion to use no salt butter by one person.  I can't wait to try that variation.  This is the best!!!!

I loved this as did my chocolate-holic husband! It tastes just like milk chocolate milk. The only thing I didn't like was it is a little on the soft side, hard to use my cutters on it. I froze it then cut it into little leafs and such. Also I halved this and still had PLENTY! Makes lots of fudge! I never tasted cheese(used Velveeta) neither did hubby. VERY GREAT FUDGE!!! Thanks!

I used this recipe but didn't use velveta.  I used regular cheddar cheese that was thinly shredded.  It worked and tasted just fine and doesn't taste like cheese at all.  I too split the recipe in half.

I've made this on 4 occasions now and everyone loves it. Noone believes there is cheese in it.  In fact, I've even received the comment, "I know fudge and this does not have cheese in it."  I would recommend this to anyone.

I never cooked fudge before and mine was a success.  I used chocolate chips and mixed nuts otherwise the exact recipe.  It is as easy as advertised, make it with confidence.

I'm truly lousy when it comes to making fudge, but this one turns out every time. With this recipe, I look like I know what I'm doing. :) I agree with the previous posts that say halve the recipe and sift the cocoa into the powdered sugar, it really helps.  Other than that, I follow the instructions. 

If you want to have some success at making fudge under your belt, this is the one to start with - it's as close as I've come to fool-proof.

I made this for a large fsamily gathering the night before Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit!  One friend said he liked it better than traditional pumpkin pie.  I'm getting ready to make again for Christmas eve.  Definitley a favorite.

This is a really good fudge and very simple to make.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it is slightly salty from the processed cheese.  If they ever come up with low-salt Velveeta, then you'll have a 5 star fudge.  My husband DID NOT want me to make this when he saw there was cheese in it.  Of course, I did anyway and he was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  He took some to work and everyone loved it but he hasn't had the nerve to tell them what's in it.  I took Mary's advice and halved the recipe and it easily fills a 7 x 11 pan.  Makes plenty.

Love this fudge!  It was first time to make fudge and this was an easy recipe.  I did split the recipe to make to separate batches. One batch with nuts and one without.  In the batch without nuts I added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and it was delicious!
