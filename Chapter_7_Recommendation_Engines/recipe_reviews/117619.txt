This recipe is awesome. I made a couple of changes and it turned out great. I added the sausage to the cheese filling instead of the spaghetti sauce. I also added a bar of cream cheese to the cheese filling and it was to die for.

I made this for dinner and my whole family raved about it.  I used more cheese than the recipe called for because we are cheese junkies.  I also added sausage and mushrooms to the cheese mixture.  I used a ziplock bag with the corner cut to fill the pasta. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

I was looking for something different but familiar and tried this recipe about a week ago.  

My husband and daughter loved it, and I ended up making it again within a few days because I had leftover stuffed manicotti in the freezer because I made a big batch the first time.  

I added more garlic to the stuffing along with some pepper.  I also had a bigger jar of spaghetti sauce and a slightly larger package of sausage than called for, so this turned out to be a very hearty, very meaty dish. (I didn't have to grease the pan because I used more sauce.)

The first time I made this, I sauteed a minced onion with the drained sausage and spaghetti sauce.  The second time, I just browned the sausage and added the spaghetti sauce.  The first one with the onion was a little better.

Do not attempt to serve this without letting it rest for at least 10 minutes!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I use a pound of Louis Rich turkey sausage and low-fat cheeses, but I don't think it takes anything away from the recipe.  The box of shells came with 14, and this made enough to fill them all.  Excellent!

This is a great recipe!  Full of flavor.  I did not add the meat, I sauteed a small can of mushrooms, 1/4 cup of chopped onion and minced garlic to go with the spinach in the stuffing.  The stuffing of the shells is messy, but fun.  Be ready to hand stuff them!  I used a jar and a half of 2 different flavors of spaghetti sauce, one that had chunky tomato and a zesty Italian flavor.  Make sure to spread the sauce evenly, especially in between the shells.  I used a small spatula to spread it around and let the sauce fill in between, as well as when you add the water.  You must use a 9X13 pan or larger.  The pan gets filled to the rim!  Family and friends will love this one.  Very easy to do.  Be ready to get complimented!

This was very good, and easy to make. I used hot Italian sausage, so it was spicy. I also used fresh spinach, steamed, sqeezed dry, and chopped, because that's what I had: same thing in the end! I will make this again, adding more garlic.

This was so easy and so GOOD!! I love that you don't have to cook the manicotti first - it makes them easier to handle and saves a step. I put most of the sausage in the filling, instead of all of it into the sauce. Just plan ahead because it has to bake for an hour. Worth the wait though!

Yummy! This is a delicious recipe...thank you, Donna for sharing! I followed the directions exactly and only added fresh mushrooms to the mix.  I put the mix in a gallon ziplock bag and cut a hole in the corner and squeezed the mix into the shells, but I still had to hand-stuff them to get the mix all the way in. It was not hard at all...just messy! I was able to stuff 12 shells. I used Italian sausage patties [all I had], cooked them, drained off the grease, and crumbled on top of the shells.  Then I poured the spag. sauce on top and spread it out [after adding the water].  The shells cooked perfectly!  My family [all 4 kiddos, under 10] LOVED it! My hubby was so impressed! :)

Followed recipe as written except added more garlic and some italian seasonings. My husband liked it more than I did (I thought three stars, he thought four). I think it was the cottage cheese...something in the "stuffing". I guess I'm use to ricotta .

The cottage cheese in this dish really infused flavor that would have been absent with the usual ricotta cheese!  What a nice addition.

This Recipe is great! I made this for my boyfriend last night, and I followed it exactly, except that I didnt have oregano... I used dried basil instead and it didnt seem out of place. I also used spicy italian sausage, which was great. The only thing I will say, is the prep time was probably closer to 30 minutes for me, but well worth it.

This was good. We added chopped mushrooms to the cheese mixture. We did like using the cream cheese and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese as I don't like warm cottage cheese.

Great!  This was a hit with my family.  I followed a tip from a review and used cottage and ricotta cheese, plus I used the sausage in both the mixture and the pasta sauce.  I sprinkled some italian seasoning atop the mozzarella during the last 5 mins of baking - nice!  Look forward to making this again.

This was great!  I made a few changes: used 1 lb of ground turkey and cooked that up with onion and mushrooms.  Otherwise, the rest was pretty much the same....maybe a bit more cheese.  My entire family loved it.  Tasted amazing!  Will most certainly make again.

Loved this recipe. It was so easy. As one of the other reviewers suggested, I added sausage to the filling mix and the sauce (I bought 2 lbs. of Italian Sausage). My family really enjoyed it. It did take me a little longer than 20 minutes to prep, but I will try this again.

I only had soy meat on hand, and no spinach except Caribbean taro leaves. (So it was a Soy Taro Manicotti instead, haha.) I used cottage cheese for the protein, and I'm so pleased! I only had enough mixture for 7 manicotti shells, so I used just a little less water (1/2 cup) and it worked perfectly! The only thing I would've changed is adding cayenne pepper to the sauce to make it spicier. This was such an easy and amazing dish; I'll be making this often! Thank you so much!

This is a great recipe.  We have served it for company with a salad and french bread.  Everyone has raved about it.  I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese but both work well.  Also, I use additional sauce.  I have tried it by mixing the meat with the cheese and it is very good also.  I always go back to the meat and sauce on top.  I have passed this recipe on to many friends and family and they all continue to use it.  Enjoy!!!

Really good! I added at least an extra tablespoon of marsala wine. At the end I added 1/8th cup Parmesan cheese to each plated dinner. Also, next time I will use 2 cans of tomatoes to give it more sauce. My husband (who hates eating leftovers) wants the leftovers for dinner tomorrow night! Success! Probably the best meal I have made.

I made crepes instead of using pasta noodles but the filling was excellent altho I used ricotta in lieu of the cottage cheese.  This was a nice change from the usual all cheese filling. Thank you Donna!

DO NOT double this recipe without trying it the first time!  It says that this will make 5 servings, but it makes a lot more than that if you use any of the recommended reviewer modifications.  I did add sautéed mushrooms and onions with garlic into the mix, and I put all of the browned Italian sausage in the "stuffing" as well to beef it up.  My guys are meat eaters.  I doubled the recipe because I have a hungry crew and didn't want to run short because 5 servings usually doesn't do it for us.  I used 2 boxes of shells, stuffed them both, and still have enough filling to probably do another 4+ boxes of shells.  The recipe is GREAT, and I am excited to buy several more boxes of shells to stuff tomorrow so that I can make freezer-ready meals, but if you aren't into batch or freezer cooking, definitely don't double it.  That being said, this is definitely a KEEPER!  Thank you Donna. :)

5 stars for the idea. I used ricotta but think I will use 1/2 ricotta, 1/2 cottage cheese next time. I added sweet italian turkey sausage (cooked/drained and finely crumbled) to the cheese mixture. I had a 9oz box of G Giant frozen chopped spinach which was plenty. I did use more garlic/spices and cooked 1/2 a diced sweet onion with the sausage. Also, I par cooked the shells so they could expand a bit which eliminated adding water to my homemade marinara sauce.  The shells expanded somewhat but remained stiff enough to fill easily (using a quart zip bag). I guess I didn't want the pasta itself to be gummy by not cooking it at all. Very good basic recipe and the cooking time was spot on for me, although I uncovered after 45 minutes and topped with the mozz and additional parm cheese and baked another 15 minutes. I would personally say it needs more herbs/spices if you'd like more flavor.

Great recipe but definitely needed extra sauce. Luckily I had an extra can. Just warmed it up and poured over the top of manicotti.

DELICIOUS!!! I did make 3 changes. First, there was no way cottage cheese was coming any where near my food so I used a mix of ricotta and feta cheese. I did not have italian sausage so I used pork sausage. And finally, I like a lot of sauce so I poured more on top before cooking, then added a little more with each serving. It came out sooooo good!!

Excellent.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I also used already cooked spicy sausage that was not italian (I think it had a little mozzarella and pine nuts?) I sauteed the spinach (canned) in garlic.  I also stuck in some cream cheese.  I sprinkled a little parmesan on top before I covered it.  Added more cheese as instructed after I uncovered it.  I will cook it longer next time because the shells were a bit chewy.  Great!

Made this the other night for dinner.  My husband absolutely loved it.  It was great.
