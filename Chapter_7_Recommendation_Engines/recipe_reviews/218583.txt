Wonderful recipe!  Very forgiving in its composition.  I didn't have enough eggs or any buttermilk on hand.  I used one egg and substituted 2% milk for the buttermilk (plus a little extra volume to make up for the missing eggs).  Still delish with the modifications.

Great recipe - followed it as best as I could (didn't have buttermilk, used 1% with a splash of vinegar... didn't have marjoram, sprinkled a bit of sage in).  Made half the recipe and included one potato (didn't want to break open a whole zucchini for 1/2 c) and I don't think that changed the taste a lot.  They were delicious!  Puffed up a bit, added mozzarella (would've been better if fresh) and some banana legs tomatoes from the garden to garnish.  Thanks for a great recipe!  You could totally add some different seasonings to spice things up a bit!

Wonderful fritters! I followed the recipe as stated, only I made my fritters a little smaller than 1/4 cup batter per fritter. I used Old German Heirloom tomatoes, and also topped each fritter with a little chopped fresh basil. I served this with grilled "Balsamic Chicken." Nom! To reheat these fritters, microwave until just warm, then heat the rest of the way in the toaster oven...

This was EXCELLENT!!!!!  I didn't have Marjoram or buttermilk on hand so I substituted with Garam Marsala for Marjoram and I used almond milk + 2 tsp of lemon in place of the buttermilk.  This was soooooo good!!  :D  I actually joined the site just so I could rate this recipe!

I only would give this 2 stars as it is rather bland. I think that more Parmesan cheese would help and I would grill the mozzarella on top of the tomato before placing it on top of the fritter.

I love this recipe!  It is so delicious.  I especially love it with a little goat cheese spread on the fritter and topped with a fresh home grown tomato!  I have made them twice so far.  I shredded the zucchini and let it sit in a colander on paper towels to drain off some excess moisture while I assembled the other ingredients.   Both times I used 1/2 Whole Wheat White flour and 1/2 AP Flour.  The second time I baked them in the oven at 425 for 7 mins, flipped them and cooked for another 7 mins. Still delicious and healthier.  They also toast up real well as leftovers!

Followed exactly- so yummy!  Be sure to mix the dry ingredients first, add zucchini and mix very well to coat prior to adding egg mixture.  I can see myself manipulating this in the future, but it is fantastic as it is!  Must use fresh, good quality ingredients!!!

This is a simple and forgiving recipe - I forgot the parmesan cheese and it was still a hit! I used roasted cherry tomatoes instead of fresh and added chopped scallions for texture. Definitely a recipe I will use again!

Fabulous!  I added some fresh parsley and green onions and with the tomato and cheese on top it makes a meal.

Very good!  Makes more than 10 fritters, though. More like 14 so I had a lot left over (and I didn't make them skimpy by any means). I substituted sage for marjoram. They also didn't take a full three minutes per side once the skillet got hot.  Probably only need a couple of minutes per side.  Very good and the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes really make them great!

The best zucchini recipe I have ever made!!  Simple yet gourmet.  I omitted marjoram and used about a tbsp of my pesto instead of the basil and garlic powder.  I halved the recipe and got 7 fritters! (I probably used 2 cups zucchini).  Looks as good as it tastes.  The fresh mozzarella is key.  I will make these and freeze them!

I made this for dinner and I was surprised by how great it tasted. The flavor and texture were superb. I fried the fritters in olive oil, so it was reasonably healthy. I only have one slight tweak; I added a few drops of balsamic and fresh basil leaves.

Made this for my girlfriend and I. Used sage instead of majoram because that's what I had. Worked out well! Also added a bit more garlic powder, and some dill. The recipe makes a lot for two people, but the leftover cooked fritters freeze really well and are great for a quick lunch in the toaster oven . Perfect pair with Chef John's Tzatziki sauce!  I would recommend using shredded cheese so it gets melty easier. I will definitely make this again.

I prepared this exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  It's a little time-consuming as I was frying fritters for a long time.  I got about 20 out of the recipe (so 2 per serving).  However, the time investment was worthwhile.  Straight out of the pan, these fritters are light-textured with a crisp outside and a creamy interior -- pure comfort food.  I don't expect the crispness to last, but I'll see what reheating in the oven does for them.  Regardless, the combination of seasonings is very good and gives these are great flavor.  I'll definitely make again but would love to have a griddle on hand for my next attempt.

awesome base recipe -  I just tweaked: 1) a pat of butter with 2% milk 2) -1/2C flour +1C Maza 3) +1/4C chopped onions, -garlic powder, +garlic paste, +squirt lemon juice, +fresh cut corn from one ear to the liquids/eggs and power burst for 30 seconds 4) -salt +salt_substitute -marjoram -basil -oregano +1tsp italian seasoning 5) +1/4C SHARP cheddar 6) cooked fritters on a non stick griddle sans oil (only seasoned when warming)

The added corn and reduced seasonings REALLY adds flavor to this and brings out the other flavors. If I find a way to form the batter a tad thinner, this would make the perfect wrapper for and type of fresh burrito :)
