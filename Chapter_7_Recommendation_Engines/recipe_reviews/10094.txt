The cookies tasted like flour cookies.  Not sweet and way too many white chips for such a small recipe.  Also, it's supposed to make 48 cookies, and it made 22.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Try the recipe on the back of the Nestle Toll House white chip bag!

The other reviews are right there is something wrong with this recipie.  I added an extra egg and 1/3 cup of milk in order to make it a texture that I could mix the nuts and chips into.  Also, I rolled the dough and flatted before cooking as the drop cookies were ugly.  The cookies were tasty if you like cake-like cookies.

I was very disappointed - had to throw the entire batch out.  We followed the recipe exactly and they came out as super dry and crumbly.  Almost as if they needed more butter or another egg. :(  I ended up using the stand by Toll House recipe and substituting white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts.  Yum!!

This recipe was very good - it got rave reviews from those I served it to.  It makes a cake-like cookie.  The dough mixed up fairly stiff - so much so that I added about a cup and a half of milk to it (double batch) to get to a good consistency for dropping on the cookie sheet.  Probably could have used a little less milk and had a slightly firmer cookie, but they were good anyway.

Make sure you do not overbake, they will turn out hard as rocks.

Good and easy cookies.  I made them without the chocolate and they turned out perfect, gooey on the inside and toasted on the outside.

This recipe is AWFUL!!!  The "cookies" didn't even bake!!  I agree that there were way too many chocolate chips for the recipe as well...I used the Nestle toll house recipe, but did add the melted unsweet chocolate to the recpe.

I wish I would have read all of the reviews before making the cookies. I doubled the recipe, omitting the macadamia nuts since I was making them for someone who is allergic. The first batch turned out not the greatest. The second batch I shaped into balls and flattened with a spatula and reduced the cooking time to 8 minutes. These cookies turned out pretty good. I think if I try this recipe again, I will reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 and see how they turn out. Not my favorite, but they were ok...

I think the recipe calls for too much flour and not enough chocolate.  The dough and cookies come out crumbly and flour like.  Definitely needs modifications.  A type-o maybe?

Here's a twist on this recipe. Skip the nuts and white chocolate. Prepare the dough as listed and bake 1 tbs. balls that are flattened to 1/4". Bake for only 8-9 minutes. Remove from the oven and gently push in unwrapped Hershey "Hugs" into the center. These are simular to Kisses but are mixed with white chocolate. Definately a very elegant cookie!

Disappointed.  Like several others I found these have a heavy flour taste.  I reduced the chocolate chips to avoid an overly sweet taste & added a little extra butter to smooth out the batter.  They never spread out during the baking..when finished they look like little rocks.

This recipe needs more sugar. I added 1 CUP of it and the cookies came out better the second time around.  I also added a little salt.  Oh, and a cup of Rolled Oats.  Not too bad.

I will not be using this recipe again. The cookies were to dry and not enough to make 4 dozen. I'll just use the recipe on the back of the bag of chocolate chips.

Definitely not a rich chocolate, melt in your mouth cookie.  But edible.  I will be looking for another recipe in the future!!!
