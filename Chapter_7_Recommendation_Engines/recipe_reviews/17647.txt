One of the BEST pound cakes I've ever made!  Very moist and delicious.  I added 1 pkg instant lemon pudding along with 1 tsp lemon juice to the batter, and it was fabulous!  Thanks for a great recipe!  :o)

This is delicious.  The ingredients don't list salt, but since I didn't have self rising flour, a substitute is to add baking powder and salt to all-purpose flour, which is what I did.  No additional salt was required though.  The only thing I should have done differently is keep it in the oven maybe 5 minutes less because the outside got a little too dark; other than that...perfect!  Thanks Rhonda!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have self rising flour so I used all purpose and added 1/2 tsp. of baking soda. Cake came out great.  I also don't like lemon, so I added Tsp of Orange and a Tsp of Vanilla.  Wonderful Flavor.

A very moist cake and and a favorite at social events. I do have a comment on the directions. It tells me to sift the all purpose flour, self rising flour and salt.   No where in the ingredients is salt mentioned or how much to use. I neved added salt and it tastes great.

This recipe is fantastic. I even called my mom to tell her that her recipe (that was passed on from her grandmother) has seen its last generation because I won't use it anymore. This cake comes out dense like a pound cake but soft and moist like a regular cake. Absolutely wonderful! And it makes a sweet crust on top that is delicious. The only problem that I ran into was putting it into a cold oven and then turning it to 350. It burned on the bottom. Maybe next time I'll put the pan in when the oven is heated up halfway to give the cake a little time to rise but hopefully not burn. Very easy and tasty recipe. Thank you!! (though my mom doesn't thank you)

I have made this cake for every holiday, family gathering, meeting, and special event that I've been to in the last year.  This is without a DOUBT, just as its name says, the BEST pound cake recipe I've come across.  Now I get special requests to make this cake for other people when they are entertaining or just want a treat for themselves.  Thanks for sharing!

I have never been a pound cake lover but since my mother-in-law loves it, I made this pound cake recipe and it converted me. It is just awesome. I made it last week and it went in an hour. It was moist and so flavorful. I gave the recipe to a friend, he made it the next day with the same results-just fabulous. I see that another user "Kerowyn" on 3/11/2005 mentions something in the recipe regarding almond extract but that user must have been rating another recipe because there is no Almond Extract in this recipe, only Lemon and Vanilla extracts. Maybe that's why his/her rating was less than perfect. I assure you this recipe is wonderful!! It truly is "The Best Pund Cake"  Rhonda, "Thank you" for submitting it.

This is a VERY moist cake, and very flavorful.  It freezes extremely well.  It's very good with lemon curd or raspberries.

Excellent cake, though I did make a couple of changes.  As I had no lemon extract on hand, I substituted with a tsp. of grated lemon zest; I didn't have self-rising flour either, so I made some by combing a.p. flour with baking powder and salt.  My cake took an additional 10 min. to bake.  Served with strawberries and cream.  Will most definitely be making this again.

Even after leaving the cake in the oven twenty minutes longer than the recipe called for, the middle still didn't cook all the way through!  Followed the recipe to a T but i guess i did do something wrong cause it was pretty much a disaster.  Also, the lemon taste was way too profound.  If i'd ever try this cake again, i'd put in half the lemon extract if any.

My sister and I made this the other day, and we were very pleased with the way it came out. Lemony.  Looked great, and moist.  It was better the next day, my sister having declared, "it really is 'the best pound cake'!" after having a slice for breakfast!

I'm impressed! I think this REALLY might be the very best pound cake. It's the best I've ever had, anyway.   Wouldn't have changed a thing about the recipe if I'd had lemon extract on hand. I had orange. It was wonderful! Will make it in lemon the next time...then orange...then lemon and over and over again...:)

I've been searching for the perfect pound cake recipe and I think that, with a little tweaking, this could be it.  I did cut the sugar (to 2-1/2 c) as suggested by some other reviewers.  Next time I make it, I think I'll cut the lemon and use more vanilla and try making it with butter.  I can play with the taste, but I want to definitely keep the texture which is perfect in my opinion.  Thanks for this one!

I've made this cake several times.  It is always moist and delicious.  Instead of using lemon extract, I use all vanilla.  People always tell me how good my pound cake is.  Remember to cream the butter, sugar and shortening until LIGHT AND FLUFFY.  I think this is very important.  It may take a while if you don't have a good mixer like KitcheAid.

Wonderful cake.  I used Earth Balance shortening; reduced sugar to 2 C; added poppyseeds (didn't measure, prbably about 1/2 cup).  Everyone loved it!  Very moist.  Next time I may add more limon extract for a more intense lemony flavor.

Great Cake.  I added about a tsp more vanilla flavoring.  Superb.  I love pounds cakes with those crusty tops, so this was excellent.  Thanks for this great recipe!  I bet this is a great recipe for weddings and birthdays.  More people should try this recipe!!!

An excellent pound cake.  I didn't have a bundt pan or tube pan- so I poured the batter into 2 loaf pans (9x4).  It still worked well, and the result was delicious! My husband and I ate more than a half a loaf in one sitting. It's dangerously good and I fear I may eat the rest all by myself. A definite keeper.

I can't say that this is not good BUT I didn't get what I was expecting. The texture was denser that a "traditional" cake but it wasn't reminiscent of a pound cake for me. I did enjoy the cake though. I was making it to go with strawberries and it was quite good. I used the bundt pan (that was so old it didn't have the size on it) and it filled the pan about 2/3 of the way full. It rose slightly over the pan but it did not spill over. Also, the top browned pretty darkly in comparison to the rest of the cake. I checked it right at an hour, and it was done, the full time would have burnt it for sure. It released nicely from the pan and was a nice even golden brown, nothing like the top. Sorry for the lengthy review, but often more than not I find these reviews so vague.

Stuck to recipe minus lemon extract (which I was out of).  Used Vanilla flavoring instead.  Baked about 15 minutes longer laying a piece of foil lightly over the top of the pan to keep the top of cake from browning too much.  Loved the cake.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Hummmm, the recipe sounds good, however the poster should have used a better photo of the cake.
This cake looks like it is was over baked big time!

In fact, it looks like it was burnt~

I give it 4 stars for the recipe( I use buttermilk or cream),  and O for the presentation.

yummy! I used butter flavoring as I had no lemon extract. It was difficult to get out of the bundt pan and had a bit of a crust on the outside. Nice and moist on the inside though! Served it with blueberry sauce and whipped topping! Thanks for sharing!

You have got to try THIS recipe with the CHOCOLATE BAR FONDUE also from allrecipes.  By the way, I used 2 pks choc morsels instead of chocolate bar, it's easier.  This pound cake was perfect with that fondue.  Good dense texture you love in a pound cake.  If you want your party to be a hit make these two recipes and bring a little extra strawberries and pretzels to go with.  Yummy.  Thanks for the keeper recipe.

This cake was very good and moist, I didn't have Lemon Extract so I used lemon juice which is not as potent as the extract so it could have been a little better. Also I think it calls for too much sugar, the sides and top of cake were very crunchy. But overall it is a good cake, I will make alteration's the next time I make it.

The texture and taste is like that of a regular cake mix. Nothing special, it is nothing close to a pound cake.

I followed the recipes exactly and it burned bad. I don't know what I did wrong but when I took off the burnt parts, the actual cake was DELISH!! So next time I will make it into loaves and I may have better luck. The crust is my favorite part of pound cake so I was really bummed that I couldn't eat it. But, the cake is so good that I will DEFINITELY try it again!

The title is truly accurate, it is the Best Pound Cake. I added an additional 1/2 tsp. of vanilla,but everything else remained the same.  I will make this cake many times over. Very very good!

Great flavor.  Would have been the perfect pound cake if not for the crust topping.  Thanks, Rhonda.

Though I made a few changes the cake has turned out excellent,I used brown sugar instead of white and used butter, I never use margarine.I had no lemon extract .I added t tablespoon of hot water to the evaporated milk and no self raising flour so added 1/2tsp of baking soda and the cake turned out great,delicious ,it's really yum.
Thank you for sharing this recipe it's a keeper for sure and super simple to make.

Cake baked withing 50-55 mins due to preheating the oven. I didn't like the idea of putting the cake in a cold oven. Nevertheless, the cake tastes great! And I like the crusty top, but I did cover the cake with a cookie sheet (didn't have any foil) to prevent over browning. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Recipe worked perfectly.  I did a variation by adding grated orange rind instead of lemon extract and folding in fresh blueberries.  After it was baked and turned out of the pan but still warm, I mixed 2tbsp orange juice with 1 tbsp lemon juice with 1/4 cup of white sugar.  Use a toothpick to poke holes in cake and glaze with juice/sugar mix.

I made this with 3/4 tbsp of vanilla, 3/4 tbsp of almond, and added about 1 tbsp of poppy seeds. I didn't change anything else, but I did refrigerate the batter overnight before baking it. Left it at room temperature for 45 minutes before baking, but the outside was a bit burnt and the inside not cooked through. Don't know if it's because it wasn't at room temperature yet, or because something else didn't work. The parts that were cooked and not burned were delicious so I will definitely try this one again. My tips for you: bake right away and play with the extracts! This has potential!

Baked and smelled wonderful, had a great taste, and the texture density was just what I wanted, but mine turned out slightly dry.  I may decrease baking time or add some sour cream next time and see if that solves the problem.  I used a bundt pan--be sure to grease and flour liberally to prevent sticking.  I topped with a lemon juice/butter/powdered sugar glaze and the taste was excellent.  I will definitely try this one again.

I used strictly vanilla extract since lemon extract was not preferred by my guests.  This made the cake too sweet, but overall a good quality pound cake.

I baked it with butter instead of margarine and coconut oil instead of shortening. I used 1 C of self rising flour because I had white whole wheat flour. Also, only used 1 C of raw sugar and 1 C of coconut sugar. Since I didnt have lemon extract, I zested a lemon and used 11/2 TBLS vanilla. Very moist. I wouldn't want it any sweeter.

I thought it came out great, a bit too sweet for my taste maybe next time I'll add less sugar.
Regarding changes made, I  didn't have shortening so I added 1/4 cup (125 grms.) more of margarine and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.
Also didn't have lemon extract so I substituted with 2 table spoons lemon juice.
For the flour I used regular flour and added a tea spoon of baking powder and sifted before mixing in.
I did have to cook 30 mins longer, don't know if being at sea level has anything to do with it or if it's  my oven ??
The texture was moist enough and it did not crumble when I cut it. Thumbs up.

I made it!.  I'm not a cook. Never been able to bake anything. But, this cake turned out perfect! My fiancée loved it. My sisters loved it.  I did make one adjustment though, I used 3 sticks of margarine instead of the cup of margarine and the 1/2 cup of shortening--just seemed like too much oil.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions to the T. I used a gas oven.  Cake was delicious. I'll try it with the extra oil for Thanksgiving--I'm sure my family will love it.  Thanks for the recipe :)

It browned too quickly which I can solve by covering with foil, but it rose very quickly, overflowed the bundt pan, and went fairly flat before it was done.  The taste is terrific and texture perfect.  I would very much like to know how to fix what happened.

Excellent cake, best I have ever made. I don't make many pound cakes as I have always thought "what am I doing wrong"? Dry, heavy, I never get them where I'm happy with them. Well not this time. This one is awesome! I did however make a few changes; for the shortening I used Extra Virgin solid Coconut oil, I didn't have evaporated milk so I used 1C  reg milk. (Another recipe called for that amount in it. I also used fresh farm eggs that are much smaller eggs than store bought, and used equivalent of 7 eggs instead of the 5, and I used Almond, and Vanilla extracts. I was concerned that it was not fully cooked, but knife came out clean, so I didn't want to over bake it. It turned out to be a super moist cake, delicious! This will be my go to pound cake recipe!!

This cake is the best. Came out great the first time. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. Instead of 3 cups I only used 21/2 and it was just right for me and the family. I will make this from now on.

needs a lot more baking time.  had to cover with foil to stop it from overbrowning.

I wasn't personally a fan of this recipe (didn't like the hard crust-although the inside was nice and moist).  However, my boyfriend and dad both thought it was pretty good.  I only cooked mine about 50 minutes and it still burned quite badly.

This was good, but not 5 star good. I added only half the almond extract and am glad I did--the whole amount would have been way too strong.  It was not as dense as I care for, either.

Very good, added a package of chocolate pudding and made a marble cake out of it.  Thought the white part was a bit too lemony and will try almond extract next time.
