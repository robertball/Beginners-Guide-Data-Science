Horrible recipe. I made this for dinner for four of us. We all thought this was terrible. I made it exactly like the recipe called for.

Very good. I didn't have all the ingredients. Used Jasmin instead of Basmati rice. Used oyster sauce rather than fish. My store didn't have curry paste so I used powder (I know, totally different). Made half the recipe, except for the raisins, almonds and coconut, so really they were doubled. Should have made the whole recipe, even with just 4 of us we ate the whole thing and could have eaten more. Making it again now to take to a party.

As a stand alone salad, this is good, but not that flavourful, I however cooked Barbequed Thai style Roast Chicken (from this website) and had that ontop and they were superb together as a meal. Can not wait to make it again.

This was very rich and probably not something I'd make again, but I enjoyed it. I found it very flavorful, but I made a few changes: I used a 2-to-1 ratio of liquid to quinoa, using mostly coconut milk; subbed raw almond butter for peanut butter; subbed currants for raisins; and added fresh cilantro at the end. I think the cilantro was key. Don't expect this to taste like coconut, though; the sauce is the dominant flavor.

I followed this recipe to the letter and ended up wit hdry tasteless rice.  It was a waste of ingredients.  Maybe if you doubled the sauce, it might be OK.

Was very disappointed. The contrast of hot and sweet just was not there despite the combination of raisins and curry paste. Also had issues with the texture not living up to what I am used to in a rice salad.

This was really good. I served it hot with curry. I left out the rasins and almonds. Thanks!
