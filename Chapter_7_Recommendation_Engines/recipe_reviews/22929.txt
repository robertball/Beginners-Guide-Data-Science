The vanilla and cinammon gives this smoothie a great twist. I don't use egg.  Added three ice cubes to the recipe. I also added a few things to enhance the nutritional content:  1 T brown rice protein, 1 T flaxseed oil.

Alicia, I loved this recipe.  I have to agree with others that I will need to cut the sugar (to each his preference of course) to about 1/4.  I tried 1/2 of your amount and it was still too sweet, but very delicious and very filling.  Applause to your father and family for sharing this recipe.  One last note, if you freeze the banana before making the smoothie, it will come out thicker.  Just some FYI.  Thanks again.

DELICIOUS! I used a frozen banana, and I think that really made it extra good. I also used half the sugar, but next time I will probably only use 1/4 of the sugar.

This was really good.  I used splenda instead of sugar and no egg and I also put a few pieces of ice in it.  Thank you.

Excellent dairy-free version:  1 cup almond milk, 2 ice cubes, 1 ripe banana, 1 egg, 2 teaspoons sugar (I used turbinado, but white is fine) and (optional: 2 squirts flax oil (1 tsp)), - a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg adds a nice touch, but isn't necessary.

Even after cutting the sugar in half, this smoothie was too sweet for my liking. I added an extra banana for a little more flavor. The egg definately is needed to make the smooth texture. Thanks Alicia.

This recipe was alright.  It was pretty thin even with the egg.  Next time I will try freezing my banana first for more texture and wait until it is very ripe.  Decent recipe to play around with.

I also added some ice cuz it was so thin. It  was probably because my banana was too small! I also used Splenda, and actually only 1/2 the amount of vanilla because I ran out, and it was STILL good! Next time I will try it with egg substitute.

This was the best smoothie  I have ever had.  My daddy always told me that a raw egg added to a smoothie was the only way to drink one.  Boy, was he right!!!

My smoothie turned out thick and delicious without adding the egg, not thin like others are saying. Also love that it doesn't need ice.

This smoothie was a healthy and yummy treat!  However, I did modify the recipe just a bit.  I lessened the amount of sugar to 2 teaspoons and added a bit of honey.  It was also good with or without the cinnamon.  I absolutely plan to make this for breakfast again!  I was amazed at how fast this was to make, and how much there was!

This was pretty good.  The flavor was a little 'milky' for me.  Next time, I'll add another banana or maybe some strawberries.

I was surprised at how easy this was - and I had all the ingredients on hand. I left out the egg, my health is too weird to mess with it! Still, it was very good without the egg.

Even after eating a small breakfast, I'm usually starving by noon.  With 16oz of this drink, I can go much longer, and the energy it provides is unparalleled.  I leave out the sugar completely..and it still tastes great! I also have tried a tablespoon of strawberry yogurt and it added quite a bit of flavor.  I like the egg, but having one everyday makes me nervous, so sometimes I throw in a couple tablespoons of protein powder instead.

Excellent.  Also, the raw egg and the banana make this a good foundation for a power drink after a morning workout.  Don't skip the pinch of cinnamon!

I didn't add the egg or use the blender but oh well. It wasn't too bitter because of the cinnimon. I also only used 1 table spoon of sugar.The cinnimon was a great touch to it also! This was a great recipe!

At first, I was a little afraid of adding the egg in, uncooked, but it ended up tasting fine. Maybe a bit too liquidy for me, but I didn't mind.

Wow, I've made a lot of recipes from this site and this one is fantastic.  I used honey instead of sugar, or 1/2 teaspoon of Stevia will also work if you are so inclined.  Egg really adds to texture.  Great drink.

So good! My favorite way is to use a frozen banana, no egg, no cinnamon, and 1T sugar. The frozen banana gives it a thicker consistency without having to use an egg. I know it's annoying when people change a recipe, but I had to rate it to say how much I enjoy this smoothie. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

I doubled the recipe to have some today and tommorrow. I used a packet of Truvia for the sugar, and left out the raw egg. It had a nice flavor, but tasted more like a vanilla smoothie then banana. It also wasn't very thick, but it might be because I didn't add the egg. I would like to experiment with this to add more banana flavor and to make it thicker.

Delicious! And I omitted the egg! There's something very ice-creamy about this smoothie to me. The reason for the egg omission was only because the idea of drinking a raw egg just turns my stomach the wrong way, but even without it, I loved this recipe! Will definitely be making this again.

This reminds me of a recipe for eggnog I used to make when I was a kid (back in the 60's!), from a Junior Betty Crocker cookbook.  We weren't afraid of raw eggs back then.  I love this smoothie that tastes like eggnog with a banana in it! I'll definitely be making it for breakfast, thanks for the memory and the reminder.

Instead of 1 egg, I add 2 egg whites to eliminate the chloresterol content of the yolk.  Plus, I cannot taste the egg whites at all!  I also cut up and freeze the banana the night before.  Tastes great and is a quick way to get my protein and fruit in the morning!

You definitely don't need to add all that sugar to this recipe. I used half the amount suggested and it was still too sweet. The taste is reminiscent of a banana-y eggnog. If you don't like eggnog/makes you sick, this recipe probably isn't for you.

I made a few changes to this recipe, as follows:

1 banana
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup non-fat plain yogurt
1.5 packets Splenda
1 pinch ground cinnamon

I used the yogurt in place of the egg to give it frothiness and a little thickness. Definitely use frozen bananas for this to prevent runniness and to make it colder. It is delish!

Very nice breakfast drink.  The smoothie isn’t as thick as I usually make so I whipped it in the blender until frothy.  I would make this again.

After reading the other reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/2 tsp. I used a banana out of the freezer. It wasn't bad per se, but I don't think I would have it again. Truth be told, the raw egg kind of creeped me out while I was drinking it. It was all in my head, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

I'm not a banana person, but this smoothie sure made me one!  Mmmmm!  A couple of tips:  1) It helps to peel the banana first THEN put it in the freezer (don't ask me how I know!), 2) Keep blender UNPLUGGED when you let your 4 yr old assist, or at least keep the lid on so that your smoothie stays in when he decides to hit the "blend" button, 3) This really is a meal in itself.  You'll feel as though you will explode if you try drinking this shortly after dinner.   Great smoothie though!

My kids aren't breakfast eaters but downed this without a problem and asked if I would make them every day. I too used frozen bananas and will keep my eye on the reduced produce to keep a stock in my freezer.  A quick nutritious start to the day.  This recipe is a keeper.  EDIT:  When my kids realized there was raw egg in these, they wouldn't drink them.  Sigh.  I now add a scoop of chocolate protein powder per serving.

It tastes good but it's not very thick. I'll add some ice next time. Also, I used half the sugar and it was plenty sweet. I will probably use even less next time.

Good smoothie.  I used 1 tablespoon of Agave in place of sugar.  It is pretty runny, so use a frozen banana to thicken it up.

This was a great drink.  Last night I was looking at many smoothies and this one caught my eye.  The next morning, I made this drink & loved the way it tasted.  I did make a few changes though to my personal taste.  I added a scoop of vanilla ice-cream and instead of using a whole egg, I used the egg white.  I also used only a tablespoon of sugar.  I wish I would have frozen the banana to have the drink chilled though.  I also would have blended some ice with the drink, but didn't have it.  With all of that said, this drink is the best!

I enjoyed this. Used a frozen banana,3/4 cup skim milk,1/2 tblspn Splenda(didn't need to be much sweeter)and no egg. My banana wasn't frozen solid,so I threw in a few ice cubes for a better consistancy. With these slight changes,I'd make this again.

I loved it! I added ice, but that's just because I like it really cold. When I first read the recipe, I wasn't sure If I would like it or not, so I tried it, and it was delicious!

Loved this recipe, but tweaked it a little.  I used frozen bananas & omitted the egg.  End result: thick and very tasty.

This was good enough to forget the fact that it had a raw egg!! I used to make this for my husband but instead of the egg I used to add some canned strawberries and a touch of honey -He likes sweet drinks-. And I'd resort to a touch of red food coloring, just a couple of drops and it would give it a lovely rosy color. Hint: If u run out of vanilla u could add a teaspoon of rosewater..

Tried this recipe this morning! Came out very delicious and filling for one banana! Following on from previous reviews, I used 1/4 the amount of sugar and it was still very sweet. Must be the banana or the vanilla extract. Didn't use an egg or cinnamon (didn't have any).
Definitely going to use this recipe again though!

Good recipe. Only thing I did different was used half n' half ilo milk, added 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt and a handful of ice ( about 1/2 -3/4 cup). Smoothie came out creamy and cold just like I like it. :)

Very good. I added some crushed ice and instead of sugar I  did a little less of the milk an used a dash of sweetened half and half. I had some banana in the freezer that I had mashed up in a ziplock bag. Once defrosted is tastes just a good but is a bit thicker. I didn't use the egg, I don't like eating raw eggs. Love it! I think I will add some mini chocolate chips to make it dessert.

Tried this for an afternoon snack for the kids. They LOVED it! I made one with an egg (We have laying hens.) and one without. I couldn't tell the difference, only to know one had a protein boost. Like others I added some crushed ice. I will definitely be making this again and again! I'm thinking of trying other fruits, as well. Happen to have some peaches on hand...

So yummy and so easy! I left out the egg, as I am pregnant and added 1 tbsp sugar instead of two. I also added 3 ice cubes as someone else suggested. I like my smoothies nice and cool :)  It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Skip the egg and sugar (the banana adds enough sweetness) and add two table spoons of
unsweetened dark chocolate cocoa powder and a cup of ice cubes.  Blend.
Sooo delicious.  I am addicted.

This shake was delicious and it made a great breakfast. I just tweaked it and made it with 1tbs of sugar and that was sweet enough. This is great for anyone on a diet as I am. It's a great breakfast on the go!

I made it exactly as is using 2% milk and it was just too liquid, like plain milk.  I added another banana, a splash of half and half,  and 3 ice cubes.  It was wonderful! Great flavor!

This smoothie is delicious.  My mother used to make this when I was a child also.  Now I make it for my son.  It is delicious as is.  No need to change anything.

Perfect exactly as written.  Will try freezing the banana next time (to thicken it up and make it colder).  Have made it with soy milk as well and that works just fine.  This is going into our regular breakfast rotation!  UPDATE - have used a frozen banana the last few times and it is an even bigger hit - I finally have my teen eating breakfast without a fight thanks to this!!  Make it almost every morning, often with 1 tbsp honey instead of the sugar.  Pasteurized eggs or egg product can be used very easily in this.

DH really liked it but certaintly agreed it does not need ANY sugar/splenda.  I only used 1 T. splenda too.  He also added peanut butter to his.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe, but used one frozen banana and one fresh.  I substituted a 1/4 cup of honey for the sugar and omitted one egg.  I also added a 1/4 cup of plain yogurt and and 1/4 cup of orange juice.  I will make this again.  It's a great after exercise snack.

Oh yeah baby! This was good! I made some changes, as I was making this for my kiddos. I had some "Just Whites" on hand so I used that instead of the raw egg. I also cut the sugar down to 1 tbsp, and added one ice cube. I also used an overripe frozen banana.  It was nice and thick, and I think the cinnamon makes the recipe - it adds that extra something. This recipe was a HIT! Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Easy, tasty, healthy. I added some ice cubes to make it cold and kept the egg in it so it froths up nicely. Since I work out I also threw in one scoop of protein powder. Found the recipe last week and have already made it three times.   Highly recommended.  Thanks to the contributor.

Yummy!  Am easy way to get fruit and protein into the kids in the morning. I did use a little ice and I used brown sugar, but it probably doesn't change the taste that much.

I personally love smoothies and this isn't exactly a smoothie. Even after i froze the banana and added the egg, it still was to thin. And also you should add some ice, because it came out a little too warm. But the flavor was there.

I didn't add the egg. I added wheat germ. Honey in place of the sugar, and a frozen banana. I was unhappy with how thin it was. It was barely thicker than milk itself. I thought it tasted pretty good though. Update::: I made this again doubling the banana and it was a better consistency. I also added some yogurt- and used nutmeg instead of cinnamon on top. Yum

This was great!  I added a little bit of nutmeg to mine.  My husband said he liked it better than the banana shakes his mom made him growing up.  A great way to use over-ripe bananas.

Very good and very filling!  I didn't have any bananas on hand, so I used a few frozen strawberries -- satisfied my craving for something sweet immediately.  The only thing I disagree w/ is the serving size -- it's more like two servings instead of one!

This was delicious...and I normally hate bananas! I normally get hungry around 10:30 after eating breakfast at 8...but this smoothie filled me up until 12:30, yet it wasn't overly rich when I drank it. It had the perfect texture and flavor although I did only use two teaspoons of sugar, as another reviewer suggested. It was a nice, balanced breakfast...I'll definitely make this again!

This is an easy recipe and excellent breakfast food for those paleo and protein rich dieters out there.  I used 3/4 of a cup of milk (all I had in the house at the time),  Truvia instead of sugar and accidentally omitted the vanilla extract and it still was VERY tasty!  NOTE:  use very ripe frozen bananas.  Makes a deliciously smooth smoothie.

It was very good and if you don’t want to use the raw egg you shouldn’t need it but it will change the texture.

This recipe has too much sugar. One can intensify the natural sweetness by using an over-ripe banana (freezing also increases the sweetness). Also eating a raw egg is not advisable.  To add protein, add protein powder or use a table spoon of almond butter for healthy fat.
I removed the egg, added 1 teaspoon of coconut oil, 1 teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder, a 1/8 teaspoon of almond extract, one handful of raw spinach and a tablespoon of chia seeds or ground flax seeds  for fiber and protein, the flax adds omega vitamins which are heart-healthy.

I use skim milk instead of regular milk and I freeze the bananas the night before. I put a tablespoon or two of ground flaxseed as well.  I don't add sugar anymore as the bananas are sweet enough for me.  Very tasty, one of my go-to smoothie. It's so easy to make and I always have the ingredients available.

Super easy to make. I confess to going a smidge off recipe: had bananas I desperately needed to use up, so mine was 3 bananas to everything else. I also added a half cup of ice. Used honey in place of sugar, and put the cinnamon right into the blender vs. using as a garnish. DELICIOUS. I PROMISE YOU CAN'T even taste the egg, and it does help bulk up the drink. Try it, you'll be glad you did!

This is a very good and easy to make recipe. I didn't have any bananas and didn't have time to go get any. So I used frozen strawberries that I had in the freezer. I followed the recipe but added some crushed ice. About one ice cream scoop of crushed ice.

I enjoyed it, or am enjoying it right now.
I got a banana, and wanted something different, and decided to look up a Banana Smoothie, and found this quick and easy recipe.
It states that it takes about 5 minutes, it actually took me less than 3 minutes to throw it all together and use my bullet blender to mix it up.
I did as Anatt did, and added ICE to mine as well, this gives it a thicker consistency than without. And I kept the egg, as I needed the protein that the egg provides.
Thanks, Keep up the good work.

Simple and easy.  I used 1 Tbsp of honey in place of the sugar, and I added 1 Tbsp of flax seed.  I was very generous with the cinnamon.  And I left out the egg.  Delicious!

I tried this recipe and I loved it, though I did add vanilla ice cream, because I like my smoothies thicker than what I got, plus it added a nice creamier taste. Other than that it was a great recipe!

Delicious!! I used egg substitute to eliminate the fat calories and cholesterol, no sugar, and plenty of cinnamon-- plenty sweet and tasty! Tip: If you want a very slushy drink use a frozen banana but if you want a smooth drink use 3 or 4 ice cubes. It's my breakfast every morning!

This smoothie is awesome! At first I felt kind of weird drinking something with a raw egg in it, but it really adds to the texture. Nice having something healthy for breakfast, too.

Very good but too much sugar, leave the sugar out and add 2 tbls of dried milk powder. It boosts the protein content without too many extra calories, makes a great breakfast. - army barmy

I've been using this recipe for years! It is a wonderful smoothie! The egg bring it all together making the smoothie nice and frothy! I highly recommend this smoothie to anyone who isn't afraid of a little raw egg in their diet.

I made this for my almost 7 year old daughter so I left out the egg.  She LOVES it.  I would only use 1 tablespoon of sugar next time. I did toss in a few ice cubes.  Will freeze the banana next time.

This was a good easy recipe with ingredients I had on hand. I made this for my brother today--I left out the egg, added another banana and a dozen ice cubes which made it nice and thick. Thanks!

I read SEA9164's suggestions and made a similar smoothie:  I used 1 frozen banana, 1 cup almond milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, the vanilla and cinnamon, and pasteurized egg whites instead of a raw egg.  It made a very thin smoothie so I added some ice.  I doubt I would make it again, but it wasn't bad.

I also did not add the egg but added a frozen banana and icecubes. This is a really good smootie. This is not a bland smoothie. It has a lot of flavor.

Loved it!  I doubled the recipe, but only used 3 tablespoons of sugar and omitted the eggs.  The second time I made this I added frozen blueberries.  My kids even drank this and they are picky.  Now I know what to do with my overripe bananas!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used about 1/8 tsp. and i added ice. i like a smoothie not a drink. no offense. All in all it was great. I would like to try it with melted chocolate and strawberries.. ces bon!!
