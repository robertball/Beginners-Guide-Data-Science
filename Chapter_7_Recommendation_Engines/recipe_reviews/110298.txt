this was amazing! i agree with smillis- the flowers need to be strained out. i went about this by mixing the sugar, water, and lavender together, bringing it to a boil, and then letting it sit and steep for four hours. i then strained the mixture before i added it to the peaches. i figured this would be easier than picking the flowers out of the puree. i halved the recipe, but i kept the three tablespoons of lemon juice (i like sour things - my boyfriend thought it was too sour the way i made it, so the proportions the recipe uses for the lemon juice is probably right for most people.) i also added 1 tbsp of vodka - alcohol helps sorbet from becoming too hard in the freezer, and good quality vodka does this without adding any flavor.

In my opinion there is one crucial step missing from this recipe; you should strain the lavender out before adding the water and freezing.  Also I used 1/4 of dried lavender.  The sorbet is really great without chunks of dried lavender!

I will definitely make it again.  I did strain the lavender flowers out of the mixture before freezing.  It is sweetly elegant - not just sorbet.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  However, I found the lavender blossoms all stayed at the top and it was quite overpowering.  I let it thaw and then strained the blossoms out.  The flavor was perfect after extracting the blossoms!

I liked it, but next time, I will cut the lavender, which I strained, by half.  I also cut the sugar by 1/3, which worked. Tasted better with whipped cream mixed in when serving.
