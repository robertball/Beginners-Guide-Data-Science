This was an excellent way to use scallops. However, small bay scallops should never be boiled rapidly, especially for more than a minute or two.  I sauteed the onion and garlic for a few minutes, added the scallops and sauteed them for about 4 minutes then removed them from the pan. I then added all the other ingredients and let it cook down to the amount I needed and desire consistency. Returned the scallops and served over angel hair pasta. Excellent!

This is by far the best recipe I have ever gotten off this site and believe-you-me I have gotten alot! I did make some changes to the recipe per the reviews of other users.  I used a half butter, half olive oil combo instead of margarine...I used scallions instead of the onions....I added shrimp, mushrooms and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded swiss cheese....I used parmesan cheese instead of romano and I only added a little parm during the cooking and added most of it right before serving while I was adding the swiss cheese.  This came out delish, it was like being at the olive garden. The only thing that I will change next time is to double the sauce because with the added shrimp and mushrooms the sauce didn't seem too plentiful.  I got rave reviews from my bro-in-law and sis and their only complaint was that they wanted more sauce. I served this with garlic bread and the remainder of white wine.  Great! One more tip...add the cheese when it is warm, not boiling.  So basically take it off the stove and let it set for maybe 5 minutes before adding the cheese.  I figured this out the hard way.  If you add the cheese when it's too hot it will clump up and stick to everything.  The sauce doesn't get creamy that way.  Only if you add it when it's warm.

This was wonderful!!!   I did make three changes and I think they really made this dish a winner;  I used butter instead of margarine, doubled the garlic and substituted a can of white clam sauce for the chicken broth.

Everything else was fine and my wife and I loved it!!

Since I first made this in 2002, I've made it many times since.  I now add twice as much garlic, use half chicken both, half white wine, a half teaspoon each of oregano and basil, and a good sprinkling of red pepper flakes to this recipe.  It was good back then, but it kicks butt now.  Thicken with cornstarch just enough for the sauce to stick to the noodle.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  Serve with salad and garlic bread.  What a feast!

This recipe was so much fun to play with! If you really like to cook (like I do), it's a kick! I doubled butter & wine, used a bunch of green onions instead, used Parmesano Reggiano, used Emeril's Essence instead of salt & pepper, added 12 oz. sliced baby portabellos, and made it with angel hair; couldn't afford the scallops right now, so I used a can of baby shrimp & a can of crabmeat...YUM!!! My 7 month old son was begging, so we gave him tiny bites of the pasta...he LOVED it, and so did we!When I put the plate in front of my husband, he said, "Oh, wow!" Lots of "m-m-m-m-m's" in the room...thanks!

I added shrimp and used angel hair pasta.  Parsley was not mentioned in the ingredients section, but the recipe says to add parsley in Step #4.  It needs it for a touch of color.  You'll probably want to thicken the sauce as the narrative stated.  Very good.

This was such a delicious recipe. I followed some of the previous suggestions and added green onions, shrimp and mushrooms.  The sauce turned out perfect, but it may be because I used ricotta and parmesan cheese instead of romano. I also adjusted the sauce to be thicker by adding about 2 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in cold milk before adding the cheese.  This really is a great, restaurant quality pasta.  Thanks for sharing!

THIS IS INCREDIBLE!  We have made it SEVERAL times and I LOVE IT - I am NOT a seafood person either. Made some small changes: Omitted margarine (don't believe in plastic butter - trans fats BAD!) instead used only about a tablespoon of olive oil. Doubled the garlic. Cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. Used Egg noodles cuz that was all I had. DEEEEEELICIOUS!!!!  MMMMMMMMMMMM!

Not bad.  Need to reduce the wine as well as reduce the chicken stock.  Next time I will use seafood stock, it just tasted to "chickeney" to me.

My husband has bad heartburn when he eats reds sauces. been trying to find other pasta recipes w/o the sauce. This is great!!!! I didn't use the chicken broth, just a chicken cube (no extra water added). One extra garlic. My husband and 3 year old couldn't get enough. didn't have that fishy taste that I was afraid of. Great for those you can't handle the red sacues.

This was delicious!  I did 1 full cup of white wine, and 1/2 cup of chicken broth, added red pepper and oregano and did use the cornstarch to thicken.  I also followed the advice of sauteeing the scallops with the onion and setting them aside, adding them again only before serving.  I tossed this with angel hair pasta.  It was fantastic!!!!  Five stars all the way, my favorite way to have scallops yet!

I loved the quality of this recipe.  I used all 4T of real butter, plus 2T olive oil, added shallots and sliced mushrooms to the onion with extra garlic.  I cut the broth back to one cup and added a full cup of white wine and boiled to reduce.  Then I added the scallops, stirring to coat with all the sauce.  Remove from heat, then add the cheese, and the cooked pasta on top.  Invert into a serving dish and put the parsley on top.  Excellent dish!!!

Excellent recipe! Very easy to make. My kids (6 and 2) love this and my husband likes it too. My husband is the one who likes scallops and I'm not quite sure how to cook them. I followed one reviewer's advice and cook the scallops with garlic and onions and then set them aside while cooking the sauce. And then put the scallops back in the sauce. I used 1 lb bay scallops and 1/2 lbs shrimps. This turn out very soupy, no shortage of sauce here! I thickened the sauce a little with flour and water mixture. 

I served this with angel hair pasta. I re-heated the sauce (with the scallops already mixed in) a few times because we eat at different times. The scallops did not turn rubbery or hard, they remained succulent and beautifully tender. Very good! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!! I doubled the amount of garlic called for and subbed in freshly grated parmesan for the romano (just personal taste preference), and squeezed the juice of a lemon over the top after adding the linguine into the sauce and right before adding the parsley and tossing the whole thing together.  My supermarket had gorgeous sea scallops on sale, so I used those instead. I seared them off ahead of time, then covered with foil, then made the sauce in the same pan. I added a little bit more chicken stock and wine to make more sauce, and once I added the linguine and a touch of the starchy pasta water it thickened up beautifully. I placed the sea scallops on top and served with garlic bread. My red-meat eating husband actually said 'AWWWW!' when we ran out! Highly recommend this recipe--quick, easy and delicious!

As A culinary school student I take recipes I find and modify them. The reason I gave this a 4 was I could not give it a 4.5 and I did not want to give it a 5. Anyone who had problems with the cheese clumping up should have had the sauce on a boil. I used sea scallops instead of bay and I found that I only needed to cook them for 7 min fully thawed. So I recommond for bay (thawed/fresh) only cook for 4 min after you bring sauce to boil. Try adding a squirt of fresh lemon juice for a more complex flavor, white pepper instead of black pepper, and add a little basil and oregano.    I made this again tonight and tinkered with it again. I used butter instead of margarine on a med heat careful not to burn the butter. I used Shallots instead of onion and four cloves of garlic till the aromas came out then added about 2 tbsp of flour and let that cook for about 30 secs. Then I added the wine, broth/homemade stock (prefer reduce sodium if store bought) and added about 1/2 cup half and half let that simmer for a few mins and add the scallops cook for about 2-3 min till just done halfway thru I added fresh basil and I seasoned with kosher salt (if using table salt use half of what the recipe suggests, kosher salt is more delicate) and white pepper. I had an after thought when I was finished to add a squirt of fresh lemon juice for more complexity. This time I had all of the flavors from the first time with a little added richness from the half and half (I would prefer cream but it was w

My husband raved about this recipe.  I substituted butter for the margarine and added a splash of olive oil to it.  I used both scallops and shrimp.  When done, I removed the seafood and reduced the juices considerably before combining with the pasta.  Delicious!

I have tried other scampi recipes on this website, but this one is hands down the best.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 2 tsp. of dried.  I omitted the onion, simply because I thought a large onion would overpower the garlic flavor, which I like better in scampi.  I doubled the sauce like other reviewers suggested, because as is, it is not even enough for 4.  I used langostinos (tiny lobster tails) instead of scallops too, and served this with a lemon wedge, extra romano cheese and semolina italian bread to mop up the wonderful sauce.  Everyone raved about it and went back for seconds.  I will definitely make it again!

My only complaint is that the sauce is pretty runny and doesn't stick real well to the pasta, but it tasted really good. Great lighter tasting pasta dish.

Yum!  I added shrimp along with the scallops.  Doubled the sauce using half butter half olive oil.  I also used parm cheese instead of romano and fettuccini instead of linguini. I also let the sauce simmer for a little bit before adding the seafood.  Perfect!

My only variations were: extra garlic, chopped onion instead of minced, extra cheese, added hot pepper, chicken stock from bouillon instead of can, I used 1/2 lb rock shrimp with 1/2 lb of bay scallops, I marinated shrimp and scallops 5 hours prior in a mixture of white wine, fresh garlic, scallios, fresh cut parsley, fresh cut cilantro, salt, pepper, and Aleppo pepper.

Instead of margarine I used butter, other than that I followed the recipe and we loved it. My 9 year old son even loved it. Next time I will try adding shrimp with the scallops.

I followed the recipe except for using olive oil in place of margarine. I didn't like it. It tasted like fish.

I used a combination of frozen shrimp and scallops.  I defrosted them in warm water and sauted them rather than bringing the mixture to a boil.  I also topped the plates with fresh parmesan cheese which really made a difference.  We skipped the parsley.  Both my boyfriend and i were really impressed with the simplicity of the recipe and the overall taste.

This recipe was great.  We've tried it a couple of times with excellent results.  I recommend cooking the scallops in a pan just big enough to accomdate all of your scallops.  This helps to keep the sauce from reducing too quickly.

This was good, but there was too much liquid, and, as others have posted, the cheese does not blend into the sauce, leaving melty blobs at the bottom of the pan. Do yourself a favor and reduce the amount of broth & add cheese to individual servings as desired. Served with "Herbed Mushrooms with White Wine" (from site), and those mushrooms added so much depth and flavor to the dish that I couldn't imagine ever serving without the mushrooms (I used portobello mushrooms).

I think for this recipe to work best you must start with a roux, use less wine, green onion instead of 1 large minced, add some blackening seasoning then only add FRESH Romano once it is on the serving dish.  Sauce had no 'body' and overall was a bit bland.  Plus, boiling the scallops will over cook them making them dry inside.

Other than cooking a pound of raw shrimp with the scallops and using green onions, didn't change anything.  This receipe was better than I expected it to be.  My husband thought it was just about as good as a seafood pasta dish he orders at Cunetto's (on the Hill in St Louis).  I might try sea scallops instead of bay scallops next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good and pretty simple, and my whole family (including very picky 10-year old) liked it. I used another reviewers recommendation to sautee the onion/garlic then add the scallops and sautee them for several minutes, remove the scallops then add the rest of the ingredients to boil the sauce, adding the scallops back in at the end. I think this method helped keep the scallops tender. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and ingredients exactly. This was a good basic recipe, and I'll probably doctor it up a little more next time, possibly artichokes and shallots, and maybe a little crushed red pepper . Thanks!

Excellent pasta!  I cut back the butter to about 3 T and that was fine.  Also added the scallops at the very end, after a previous reviewers suggestion not to boil the scallops.  The scallops turned out tender and delicious!  We all loved it!

This is a winner.  My daughter was tentative, took one bite, and said "this is my new favorite dinner!"  I used shrimp and lobster and it was fantastic.  I went heavy on the garlic but it wasn't overpowering since all the ingredients blend so well together.  Next time I'll double the sauce, it's that good and we don't have any leftovers even though it was just me, and my 11 and 9 year-olds.

Awesome! I doubled the recipe but thought that doubling the wine made it a little to sweet, so next time I'll cut back on that. I also added shrimp, mushrooms, chili flakes and doubled the garlic. This recipe was fantastic and my husband raved about it. It felt like we were in a fancy italian restaurant. The only set back would be that with the scallops it's a fairly expensive dish.

This seems to have too much chicken broth - dilutes the flavor.  I replaced the margarine with butter and increased by two TBSP.  I added two more garlic cloves, and substituted green onions for the large onion.  Added the juice of one lemon, salt and pepper to taste.  With those changes, it seemed to have more of a punch.  Hubby loves scallops, so this was a great idea instead of shrimp.  Served with freshly grated parmesan and red chili flakes.

We enjoyed this scampi very much. It is very similar to a low fat shrimp version that I made, and I think in the future I'll make it with both shrimp and scallops in it. 

I did add a couple more cloves of garlic, to suit our tastes, as well as chopped a bunch of green onions, adding 3/4 to the scampi mixture, and saving the other 1/4 to sprinkle on as a garnish once plated. With a nice salad and crusty bread on the side - excellent!

This was just okay for us....I followed the recipe exactly except for using Ramano/Parm blend.  The cheese clumped up and the sauce too runny, although it did have a very nice flavor.  In the end, I drained off much of the liquid, added some more cheese, & seasoned it a bit more so we could eat it.  I wish I would have tried to thicken the sauce a little more using corn startch but didn't want my scallops to be over cooked.

I increased the amount of sauce and thickened it a bit with some flour and milk that I added at the end. I sauted the scallops before everything else,  added them to the sauce, and then heated through.

We really enjoyed this dish. I made some alterations though. I used olive oil and butter as others recommended; had no mushrooms so used a bit of fresh asparagus chopped; had no wine so used cream and thickened it all with some cornstarch. I also sprinkled on parmesan when done. I didn't use any romano. It was great over thin spaghetti.

Not the greatest--a little too soupy for my liking. I would actually recommend the creamy scallop chowder on top of noodles (I made it the night after I made this and put it on my extra noodles)--that was tasty!!

This got raves from the family.  Added shrimp and mushrooms and a handful of Swiss cheese to the sauce.  Also used a thickener to thicken it up enough but not too much.  This sauce should be on the watery side.  GREAT meal.

Awesome recipe.  I substituted minced clams in juice for the chicken broth, added shrimp also, and left the grated cheese out until the end.  Followed others suggestions to cut the butter with olive oil and substitute scallions. It was the hit of the party.

Using the previous reviews, I made some changes to this recipe that made it very good.  I used butter instead of margarine (which I always do), used five cloves of garlic instead of three, substituted green onions for a regular onion, halved the salt (and in the future will omit it as it was still too salty) and used clam juice instead of chicken broth.  To make more sauce for the pasta, I halved the pasta and added corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also substituted shrimp for scallops (my son **loves** shrimp).  My family called it a "keeper".

This was so good! I used 1/2 shimp and 1/2 scallops for this recipe and it still turned out great. I also thickened the sauce and made it a bit more creamy at the end by dissolving corn starch in some milk. This definately tastes like a great dish from a restaurant. I will make this one again!

This was a hit in our house.  We love scallops and garlic and this was delicious.  Will definitely be making again.  I took out scallops as soon as they were cooked and then continued to reduce and thicken sauce, otherwise they would have been overcooked and rubbery.

i used shrimp instead and chopped four green onions (used entire onion - except root) instead of the large one it called for. used real butter, a third of the broth, and also one teaspoon of flour at the end. this is so good! it is really like restaurant food! great recipe! a keeper!

I think the whole can of chicken broth is too much.  Next time I would use maybe 1/2 can.  I ended up thickening it.  But besides that, my guy and his friends really thought it was "ono" (delicious)!!!  They ate the whole pot.

I wasn't happy with the chicken broth taste combined with the scallops, so the second time I made this, I used half chicken broth and half clam juice. I thought that was better. Although there is fat added to this recipe, it is divided among 4 to 6 portions, allowing it to still be called "low-fat" in my opinion.

My husband & I enjoyed this recipe, but I think there is too much liquid.  If I make it again, I will cut the chicken broth in half.  I used garlic flavored chicken broth & used four cloves of garlic.  I omitted the teaspoon of salt, but next time will probably add at least half a teaspoon.  I also added some flour to thicken the sauce a bit.  I only used 8 oz of pasta.  If I were to use a whole box of pasta I would use two pounds of scallops & follow the directions as they are currently written.  The recipe is very easy & I would definitely recommend it.  It is a dish that looks hard to make and is impressive to serve for company.  Only you know how simple & easy it really is!

I did a variation of this that was fantastic!!!  This is a great recipe, her way or mine!  I used Shrimp sprinkled with Emeril's Bayou blast, I used parmesean cheese and added sliced green and yellow squash and used angel hair pasta.  My husband thinks this could be a signature dish at any gourmet restaurant! Be sure and try this one , it's a winner whether you use hers or mine!!!!

My Family absolutely loved this recipe! I added a little more garlic than called for as we love garlic and it was delicious! We recommend this recipe highly! We do not care for a "heavy" pasta so I used angel hair making this a nice light meal.

This was yummy.  We used butter and olive oil and added artichoke hearts and mushrooms.  Doubled the wine and then let it cook off for a few minutes.  We threw the scallops in for the last six minutes and then added some green onions right at the end.  Served with whole wheat thin spaghetti and steamed broccoli, all in one big bowl.  So good, thanks!

It was okay....the sauce was VERY thin and I tried thickening it with cornstarch as the recipe suggests but one tsp is definently not enough. I made it with Parmesean cheese instead of Romano because that is what I had and the sauce was very rich and delicious but just too runny. I also added mushrooms which was also a very good choice.

I loooove this recipe for scallops! The first time I made it I didnt add Romano and I think I like it more that way...compared to the second time when I did add cheese- it overpowered the rest of the ingredients a tad.

Like many other reviews, I used butter instead of margarine.  I also added more garlic (6 cloves instead of 3).  I added the cheese as directed, and I certainly WILL NOT do this next time I make this recipe.  The cheese melted pretty quickly and wound up turning very clumpy in the sauce.  In the end it didn't make much of a difference in terms of flavor, but it definitely made the sauce difficult to work with while cooking.  In cooking the scallops, I didn't rapidly boil them as it says in the recipe.  I didn't want them to overcook and become tough, so I just sauted them in the sauce for a couple of minutes and let them finish cooking on low heat (when adding the parsley).  I also wouldn't add the parsley until the very last moment before serving.  I included some mushrooms in the saute of garlic and onion, and that added a great dimension of flavor to the sauce!  Overall, a great base recipe that you can definitely tweak for different variations.

unfortunately I had a cold while making this dish so my review is based on my family's. Everyone liked this dish, the sauce was very tasty, just a little to much butter. I did thicken the sauce w/a bit of cornstarch & had to use Parmesan cheese. Nice presentation.

I was craving scallops and found this recipe for them.  Boy, was I ever not sorry to have chosen this one!  It is really delicious.  The sauce was creamy, garlicky, with that lovely flavour that white wine adds to dishes such as this.  I pretty much followed the recipe and was very happy with the results!!  I used and prefer the smaller scallops.  Yum!!

Tasty and done in a flash, both my husband and I agree it's a terrific recipe!  I used home made chicken stock and as a user suggested, omitted the salt but added a little crushed red pepper. Next time, I will add more garlic because both of us tend to like loads of garlic taste.  It'll be a definite whenever bay scallops are on sale!

This was good and really easy to make. I sauteed the scallops in olive oil and garlic for about 4 minutes and set them aside, before starting on the sauce. My husband who loves seafood dishes thought the onion was a little weird tasting like other reviewers mentioned. I thought it tasted good.  I did cut back on the onion and used only 1/4 of a large one.  I added a bit of cornstarch- 2.5 tsps to thicken it up a tad- it wasn't as thick as the photo; I didn't want the sauce that thick. Served over Angel Hair.
SO EASY and VERY tasty!!!

This meal was outstanding.  Robert couldn't quit talking about it!  I followed some of the other users and substituted a small box of clam stock instead of chicken broth, green onion for the white and butter and olive oil for the margarine, added oregano, basil and red pepper.  I will definitely make this again

Good taste, but the salt could be omitted in my opinion - I think the cheese gives it enough of a salty taste.  I also added peas in at the end to add a vegetable to the dish.  Husband loved it!

Really enjoyed this dish...but modified it...used primo dry white wine and added mushrooms-omitted onions. Also used butter instead of margarine and cooked scallops right after getting garlic and mushrooms going and then removed the scallops. Added the white wine and a touch of fresh lemon juice and a teeny tiny bit of red pepper a quarter of a bay leaf and I let it reduce as my pasta cooked. After that reduced nicely, I added the scallops back in and finished it with another tsp of butter. Added parm to it after it was dished out and it was great. My two year old wanted 2nd's and my husband had 3rd's! Piggies! :)

I had alot of trouble with the sauce too. I tried making it several times and changing how I did things and I still can't quite get it. The cheese gets clumpy and gross and the sauce is very runny even with cornstarch. Although I must say that it must be a good recipe if I won't stop trying to get it right and we still enjoyed the taste, very yummy. One thing I do is pan sear the scallops and cook the sauce seperately. I just like my scallops with that caramelization from searing it.

The only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars is the cheese.  Like a few other reviewers, no matter what I did it turned lumpy and gluey when I added it while cooking.  I tried Romano and parmesan.  So now I just add the cheese before serving.  Great taste, I've made with scallops and shrimp and everyone really likes it.

We thought this was very good! You could easily substitute shrimp for a classic scampi. But boil the scallops for 8 minutes? Yikes! I removed them, as others did, after a few minutes.  Also used the butter/olive oil combo, extra garlic and added the cheese at the end. Had some fresh basil on hand and minced that up with the parsley.  Yum.  We'll do this again.

We did everything by the recipe and it turned out really good.  We added cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, and next time we will probably skip that step.

Wonderful recipe!  

This is my first attempt at making something from my new favorite website.  Though I did not have the Romano cheese, I used Parmasean and was happy with the substitution.

My only “negative” is that I was not prepared for the texture.  It was a bit more liquidity than I anticipated but this was quickly remedied by adding a bit more cheese!

This was a good basic recipe.  Could have used some more spice.  I think I will season the scallops with cayenne and s&p next time before I sautee them.  Went well with dry white wine.

We loved this recipe! I too used butter instead of margarine, added an extra clove of garlic as well as a dozen shrimp (51/60).  The recipe really doesn't need to be toyed with though, it's fabulous, easy, and fast.  I didn't thicken the sauce and it was delicious just poured over the pasta.

Very, Very Yummy!!  My son keeps begging me to make it again and again!  We like it with thin spaghetti noodles instead of linguini; the smaller noodles allow more of the flavor of the sauce to come through.  Other than that, I didn't (and will not) change a thing!  Definitely a keeper!!  Thanks!!! :)

Excellent! I used large sea scallops and it was delicious. I also put it over rice, so there was a lot of extra sauce (which my husband loves for dipping). Thanks! I will make it again.

This recipe has definite potential.  I substituted with butter, grn onions and champagne (will use Chardonnay nxt time), and added 4 oz sliced mushrooms.  Omitted salt and blk pepper.  Removed scallops and reduced sauce (another reviewer suggested).  Will decrease pasta nxt time (12 oz instead of 16).  Contrary to what a previous reviewer stated, this recipe IS healthy (26% cals fat, 25% cals protein, approx 50% carbs) as I made it.  Even if you cut the pasta in 1/2 the fat cals are 33% - lighter than just about any other non-red pasta sauce will provide.  Will work with it to get it perfect, but it is a good base recipe!

This was a delicious meal. I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops, but it was still perfect. I felt like I was eating at a fancy resturant. The only differances were I didn't pay an arm and a leg and I had to wash the dishes.

We don't understand all the rave reviews. I thought it was adequate, but not something I would make again. My husband gave it a -1 rating. Thought it was a waste of scallops. Why bother. 
And, healthy??? With a quarter cup of added fat to a pound of scallops (I cut it back) it is NOT healthy in any stretch of the imagination.

I trippled the garlic since my girl friend and I are garlic freaks. Also, we did not have quite 1 pound of scallops so I added a bunch of shrimp. I sauteed the shrimp and the scallops in olive oil seperatly from everything at first. I just estimated a small hand-full of parsley to add near the end. Tip: Get your water boiling for the pasta just in time you add the chicken broth to the sauce. In the end the sauce turned-out very potent and strong which actually could stretch a long way if you really want it to.

We used a sweet white wine instead of the dry white wine.  Also, we added more garlic and less onion.  Gruyere and parmesan cheese were used in place of the romano cheese.  My husband, who always adds extra cheese to everything, felt that this recipe had no need for any extra cheese.

This recipe was delicious! And easy too. I suggest starting the pasta at the same time as the scampi in order for them to be completed at the same time.

Simply fantastic! Of course, I had to try a variation using shrimp instead of scallops. I added portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers, and kabobed some shrimp using  butter and Chef Paul's Seafood Magic, and served the shrimp on the side of the noodles. Everybody was begging for the recipe, and seconds!

This was very easy to make and tasty. The only thing I would change is to omit the salt as it was a little too salty for our tastes.

Very tasty and quick too.  If/when I make this again I will have to figure a way to make the sauce thicker so it clings to the pasta.

Excellent!!   Stuck pretty close to the recipe since this was the first time I made it.  I did use real butter, increased the cornstarch in the note from a teaspoon to a tablespoon and served it over brown rice.

Overall this is a good recipe, I think it may have been better if I used a better quality wine and the cheese didn't clump. I would love suggestions. I made two changes to enhance the flavor. I decided to brown the scallops and seasoned them with crushed red pepper. In an effort to be healthier I served them over spaghetti squash. I will definitely try this recipe again.

I followed the recipe as listed, but instead of chicken broth I used a can of Progresso Light  New England Clam Chowder, I drained just the soup part and left out the clams.  I didn't use the entire can maybe about a half cup and stirred it into the mixture.  I added flour at the end to my desired thickness because sauce is pretty thin.  I used green onion instead of onion.  I used a whole garlic as well.  I served it with a side of sautéed asparagus tips and orange bell pepper.  Delicious!

great flavors, everyone loved it. with a family of seven that's a huge statement. I did find the sauce to be really thin though. when I remade it, I cut back on the broth and added some heavy cream to help thicken it.

I needed a quick dinner using the scallops I had in the freezer.  This was a great way to pull together a nice tasting weekday meal.  I followed the recipe as is and the broth over the linguine came out delicious, although the scallops themselves didn't retain much flavor (hence, only 4 stars).  I will tweak it a bit in the future to see how both scallops and broth come great together.

I followed the recipe verbatim.  The sauce was pretty bland as the chicken broth smothered the butter and garlic and left this dish wanting flavor.  Also, the sauce was more of a soup and wasn't very thick.  I don't normally leave reviews, but this just wasn't a good melody of flavors.

Just okay for us. I would cut the sauce in half if I did it again. It needs some spice. The scallops get "lost" in this recipe.

This was SO DELICIOUS!  I halved all but the garlic and scallops and we ate it on the side of green beans without the pasta.  There was a bit of juice left over that you'd better believe I'll be soaking up in some crusty bread for lunch tomorrow!

Delicious! Added fresh mushrooms; thickened the sauce with a little flour mixed with a little milk; used Parmesan and Swiss cheeses, and olive oil and butter rather than margarine. Also used angel hair pasta. I used extra butter and olive oil to be sure to have enough sauce, and I skipped chicken broth and added 2 chicken boullion cubes to the butter/oil/wine mix. This is a restaurant-quality dinner! And I'm talking a decent restaurant. I think it's better than anything I've ever eaten at Olive Garden. My 9 yr old son told me to make it every day he loved it so much! Be sure to not overcook the scallops. As someone else said, you don't need to boil them but rather sautee them.

Very good.  This was the first time I made scallops for the kids, two of the three loved it... tastes like shrimp, they said.  I served over angel hair pasta, substituted parmesan for the Romano and real butter for the margarine, doubled the amount of garlic, added extra fresh cracked pepper, and since I didn't have much parsely I added basil as well (used my freezer stash from what I harvested in the summer.)  The addition of chicken broth makes it not too greasy.  Will definitely make again.

The family loved it! I used shrimp instead of scallops, and I cooked the shrimp in the onions and garlic and removed them to a bowl while I finished the rest of the steps for the sauce. I don't think you should boil little scallops or shrimp for a long time. You really don't want to overcook them. I added them back into the sauce for the last 2 - 3 minutes.

Sadly disappointed but will play with this recipe in the future.with better quality bay scallops. Used frozen bay scallops which were entirely too small and fishy. Followed recipe and found the sauce to be soupy & thin so used corn starch to thicken.  Also used fresh parsley & parmesean. Willing to try again with adjustments.

This was great!  Only changed a few things. I can't eat onion in that amount, so used about a tablespoon of dried onion for taste.  Added red pepper flakes for a little heat and substituted parmesan for the romano cheese.  I also served over whole wheat penne pasta and it was great!  Even better the next day when the pasta had soaked overnight in the sauce.

We loved this recipe. I used a combo of scallops and shrimp. I also topped it off with quite a bit of parsley just because we like it so much.

Mine didn't turn out well. The margarine is a weird ingredient to use and the sauce was too runny and the scallops were too chewy.

This was a hit with my husband and I (no surprise), but my 4-year-old and 13-month-old happily gobbled up the scallops and pasta as well!  What a success!

I followed the ingredients to this pretty closely and it was delicious. I never really measure things exactly so that's why I say ingredients. I used a little dried basil and parsley since I didn't have fresh parsley and I used a little lemon juice as well for just a little extra kick. Good recipe! Oh I also used fresh mushrooms as well!

Smelled & tasted fabulous!  Used sea scallops & cut into smaller pieces.  I added more cheese(personal preference) to thicken the sauce.  Also added additional garlic and crushed red pepper as suggested in other reviews.  Would definitely make again.

This was very yummy. I didn't add the onion because I don't like it, and didn't have any romano so I added a tablespoon of cream cheese instead. This was made the sauce very creamy, but still light!! I will use this again!

I am torn on this recipe.  The taste was great but the presentation was weak.  I like to have both.  I think I will stick to my regular scampi recipe.

This dish was OK...just kind of middle of the road for us.  Despite the white wine, garlic, parsley and a generous sprinkling of red pepper flakes for some zing, this dish is lacking in flavour.  If I were to try again, I think I would sautee the scallops in with some garlic and then remove and work on the sauce.  Like some others, I thickened with cornstarch as it was just too soupy.  Used whole wheat linguine and fresh parm instead of romano (did not have) and did add fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for the post.

I liked this because it was a healthy way to use scallops but I felt the onions made this taste like a recipe that was made in the home not really the gourmet type of cooking I usually prefer to make. I think I will make this again however I with replace the onions with green onions or maybe pearl onions, at any rate I will play with the recipe.

This is a fantastic scampi recipe and works well with baby shrimp as well as bay scallops. I would definitely reduce the amount of salt significantly though. The first time I halved the salt and it was wonderful. The second time I forgot to halve the salt and it was so salty I almost couldn't eat it.

Good flavor, but lots of problems.  Cheese clumped and sauce was very runny.  I didn't have wine so I added a 1/2 tsp. of white wine vinegar, flavor seemed unaffected.  Dish looks rather ugly without parsley.  I added 1 cup fresh basil leaves, helped immensely, added some much-needed kick and color.  Eight min. seems too long for the scallops, either saute separately or wait until sauce is reduced to add.  Might suggest cutting down on chicken broth.

I think that this recipe had a lot of flavor. 
I sauteed the scallops rather than boiling them. I used the food processor to very finely mince the garlic and onion so that it would totally infuse... 
But this recipe did not get a 5 because the cheese clumped as other reviewers have noted.

Thought this recipe would be an excellent choice for New Year's Eve. Sauce was too runny and had no flavor. Scallops were dry. To salvage the leftovers I added 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard and more garlic. I will not make this again.

Well, I had the same problem with the cheese turning into a globby mess. It really didn't have much flavor, I increased the garlic and I used olive oil and butter too. I will try again and change it up a bit.

It was okay, but not that impressive.  It seems that the cheese, despite the problems of being lumpy, is really important.  Without it, the sauce was really liquidy and lacked some flavor.  Next time (if there is one) I would reduce the liquid by half.

Didn't knock my socks off. I did replace the margarine with half butter and half olive oil as suggested.  I added some diced tomatoes to the mix and served on rice to help absorb the sauce. The flavor however was just too subtle for me.

This dish tasted wonderful.  I followed it exactly, not changing a thing.  Very simple and easy to make.  I used frozen sea scallops, and the sweet taste really added to this dish.  If doing again I would use a more aged cheese like parmesean.  Overall, though, I highly recommend this dish!!!

Thanks for the recipe Nikki - it was good!  I took others advice and used shrimp, mushrooms, and swiss cheese.  My only complaint is that it is runny - even with the cheese.  I wish the sauce was creamier - if I could make that change this dish would be a five star!  Definitely worth making..

It was too bland, flavorless, and runny for me.  I used 4 garlic cloves, parmesan instead of romano, and 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil, and used 1 1/2 lbs. scallops, and added the parmesan nearer the end. I also added lots of cornstarch, but couldn't get it to thicken to a desireable consistency.  The parmesan cheese got clumpy and didn't mix well with the soupy sauce.  No one in my family was too much a fan.

I used olive oil in place of margarine. It's a simple recipe that's quick and good to eat. It's worth making again.

I made this recipe the other night because I purchased scallops and was unsure how I wanted to prepare them. I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. It is soooooo easy and so yummy! My boyfriend and I ate every bit of it!

Must be the romano cheese, but it was too sweet. Also would have put mushrooms in. Next time I try I will use parmesan cheese and add the mushrooms. Will let you know next time

I found it kind of boring.  It lacked flavor and I couldn't figure out what to add to it to gain some flavor.  I'll mess around with it and come up with something.

We used half olive oil, half butter and sea scallops.  Simmering rather than boiling seemed the best avenue for keeping the scallops from toughening.  I didn't like this at all, I felt that the cheese flavor was too overpowering, but my husband rated it a three.  I did use pecorino romano, perhaps a less expensive, milder romano would have made a difference.

We loved this recipe, after reviewing comments I made some changes like: green onions, a bit of cream, fresh basil, parm at the end, angel hair, sundried tomatoes, butter/olive oil, it was AWESOME!!  I will definately make this again.

Pretty good.  Definately something I'll make again.  I used olive oil instead of margarine & homemade broth in place of store bought, so there was no excessive salt.  If I do use store bought broth, then I will definately cut down on the salt as others have suggested.  Once the scallops were done, I removed them & reduced the sauce.  Tasty...thanks!

We rate recipes on a scale of one to ten and we gave this one a six.  It was *okay* for dinner once but it is not a *make again* recipe.  Nothing special.  Leftovers this morning were average.  I also added the cheese last.

We made the recipe with 1 1\4 cubes of fish buillion disolved in 10.75 oz of water. The taste was good, very rich, but the appearance was definately lacking something. My boyfriend suggested next time to use cream and buillion instead of the chicken broth. We will definately use this recipe again. Very fast, easy and light. Perfect for those warm evenings.

This was really good.  The only thing I'd change next time is adding the parmesan cheese.  It made the sauce lumpy.  Next time, I'll just sprinkle parmesan at the very end.

This was my first time cooking scallops, so I was very nervous, but it came out fabulous!.
Here is what I changed: half butter, half olive oil, but less of both in quantity, I used green onions instead of onion, parmesan instead of romano, as most here, I took the scallops before reducing the sauce and in the end, I added some seeded, chopped fresh tomatoes to the sauce and just warmed them up, before serving.
Next time, I think I will serve this on a bed of steamed asparagus instead of a bed of pasta.
Thanks, Nikki!!.

WOW!!! This recipe is fabulous!! My husband LOVED it and said it tasted like something he would order at a nice seafood restaurant. I agree. Like other reviewers, I omitted the salt and substituted green onions. Without a doubt, this will become a regular on our home "menu".

My fiancee is the cook in our household, so it was with some trepidation that I took on his request for "a good recipe with scallops"; however my fears were totally unfounded, as this is the best recipe I've ever tried from this site.  The linguine soaks up the delicate flavor of the scallops so every bite seems loaded with seafood.  It was relatively cheap to buy the ingredients, and easy even for someone like me who has trouble boiling water.

This is delicious! I used some of the suggestions here: removed scallops after a few minutes and the let sauce boil off a bit, added cheese at the end, used only half of suggested pasta. 

Won't let boil off as long next time (didn't watch close enough), also will use less butter and more wine.

Yummy!

I thought it was a good starting recipe. I used 8 ounces of chicken stock and next time I won't add the Romano cheese until last minute(it became lumpy when melted). I used cooking wine so I omitted the added salt and I used scallions instead of onions. I also used half the butter and olive oil.

This was delicious.  I added oregano and basil for more flavor. I did carmelize the onions and garlic in the pan before adding chicken broth and scallops.  I wouldn't recommend using shredded parmesan it gets a little clumpy but it still came out really good.  Toss with a bit of angel hair and you've got a complete meal.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars!! My 9 year old daughter is such a picky eater, but she absolutely loved this dish and asked when we were having it again.  Even my husband loved it, and he doesn't normally like seafood. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Absolutely delicious recipe!!! However, I did substitute butter instead of margerine, and added a spash of olive oil. Next time, I will also try adding broccoli florets. A definite winner! Had no leftovers, and they are pestering me to make this again. I will very soon!

Very good.  I used 12 pound of pasta and found it to work well for 4 large servings.

I used olive oil instead of butter, substituted scallions for the onion, and added a zucchini, that had been sliced lengthwise and then cut into slices, to the sauce.  I also served it over half a lb. of whole wheat angel hair pasta.  Next time I'll try 4 oz. of chicken broth as it was pretty liquidy.

Easy, healthy, good for vegetarian company.  The only thing I would change is the name.  I would call it Scallop Linguini since there is no actual scampi in the recipe.

This recipe turned out great.  I used shallots instead of an onion, and thought the overall flavor was terrific.  Very easy, too.

whipped this up in minutes and the kids (5,3,+ 1)  and I all loved it! (hubby is a red sauce man!) Nikki is right - add some nice french bread and a tossed salad - dinner in minutes...thanks Nikki!

This recipe is quick and easy! So far I've made it twice, with rave reviews. Blush wine works well in place of the dry, and I've also cut the amount of onion in half, doubled the garlic too. If you need a recipe to impress, give this one a try, you won't be sorry!! Deliious!!!

In about the same time it took to make the Greek salad, I had a very tasty, pretty healthy meal that was still wonderful the next day for lunch!
