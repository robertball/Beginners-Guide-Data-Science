Pretty versatile and easily adaptable to your diet (tofu instead of chicken tamari instead of soy). I changed up some of the veggies. After tasting the stir fry half way through I decided to toss in some fresh ginger and thought it worked pretty well. i would use rice wine the next time instead of cooking wine. As far as method it works. Thank you for the recipe.

I also "eyeballed" the measurements and it turned out so tasty! I used minced garlic when frying up the chicken. I substituted sesame oil for vegetable oil and Yoshida's sauce instead of teriyaki sauce. I also broiled broccoli on the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and added that to my dish with the rice noodles.

I changed it up a bit. I used sesame seed oil added radishes instead of bell pepper. My grandsons loved it asked for more!

This was a good basic recipe. I forgot to add the black pepper and rather than cutting up the onion and green pepper I just used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies. I omitted the green onion because I didn't have anyone hand and substituted the baby corn with bean sprouts. I just felt it was missing something.

This is a good option for gluten free Asian food since rice noodles are already GF and you can substitute liquid aminos for the soy sauce. I think the chicken needs to be dark meat for texture.

As suggested by another review, I added fresh ginger. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  No leftovers, all the family enjoyed this recipe and wanted it on the rotation in the future.

It was just ok for us. We found it to be missing something, but couldnâ€™t put our finger on what that was.
