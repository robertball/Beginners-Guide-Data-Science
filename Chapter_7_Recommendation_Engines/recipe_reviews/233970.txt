Just made this tonight. Hubby and I loved it. I used a pre-made thin crust (similar to Boboli)that came in a package of two and only needed half of the meat mixture to spread over the crust, so I am ahead of the game when I want to make a second one. Using a pre-made crust I didn't need to mess with moving the pizza from low to higher rack. I just cooked it in the middle at 400F for about 10 minutes and it came out great. I adjusted the seasonings down (about 1/2 tsp. cumin and 3/4 tsp. chipotle pepper) to suit our tastes, and it was hot enough for us with the 1 Tbsp chili powder. I used one poblano pepper and chopped it rather fine, so there was no need to pick any of it out. This was a very simple and tasty recipe, and satisfied our desire for Mexican food around Cinco de Mayo.

Chef John beat me to the posting of this recipe. At least you all get to taste it Sooner then if I had submitted it! (This comment is for the AR GODS). Anyhow, I mixed a little spaghetti sauce to the chipotle sauce since I had both opened in the fridge, I smeared it around the crust after I flipped the dough over on the grill. I added the cooked crumbled Italian sausage & pepperoni.  I spent the afternoon roasting Hatch chilies, so I chopped up a couple and on they went too! Topped the whole thing with cheese, let it melt. I served my hubby right on the cutting board! I thought it made a unique serving vessel. He went CRAZYYYYYY for this pizza!! Wish I could give this 10 *'s! !! THANK YOU Chef John. Keeper for sure :))

I made it as is. Was really quite good.  I used a whole wheat thin pizza crust.  BTW Patty Cakes got the wrong recipe- the one she was reviewing didn't have pepperoni, etc. -??

A winner!   It seems odd,  but it really works well.   There are many recipes that are designed to use up ground beef.  What makes this a stand alone is that the ground beef doesn’t commandeer the flavors of the whole dish.    No one is gonna say, “Hamburger again?”   They’re going to say. “Oh good, el passo pizza”
