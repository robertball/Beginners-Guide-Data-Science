In Arizona you can't get a real New York Bagel. I made these and my man,( a New Yorker) said,"Finally a New York Bagel!"

Oh my GOSH!!! These were delicious. I love to make breads and had never tried bagels before so I gave this one a try. They turned out great. A couple of changes though. I only need 4 1/4 cups of flour, and to make it healthier I substituted 1/2 cup of WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR for an equal emount of all-purpose. Next time I think I'll substitute more. And I also used brown sugar for the bagels. And I also extended the baking time because 25 minutes was not entirely long enough; they were still too moist in the middle.

as a 16 year old with free time during summer, i love cooking and these bagels are wonderful. they don't take too much time to make, aside from waiting for the dough to rise, but forming the bagels into a nice shape is tricky (i haven't been able to make them look like decent ones yet) but they taste delicious, wonderfully chewy and yet not the least bit rubbery.

Ifound that the bagles were a little salty, but I think that if you cut the salt in half that went into the water it would solve that problem, The steps were very easy to fallow, but bagles take work.  My son loved them but said they tasted diferent than the Bakery.  I added Chocochips to mine and they were great but a little salty.

this is the first time i made bagels and i think they turned out pretty good.  they tasted great.  they looked like bagels, but not perfect circles (look at the photo on this site).  i think that will take some practice.  i followed the step by step photo tutorial on this site "Forming and Baking Bagels".

I`ve been very pleased with the taste, but the look wasn`t very impressive. Maybe I did something wrong, because they weren`t very smooth on the top. Or is it because I made them with 3 cups WW Flour and 1.5 cups white flour? I have no idea! But anyway, the taste was delicious. And that`s all that matters, right?

These bagels taste awesome...I followed the recipe exactly, let my bread machine do the hard work...The only suggestion I have is once you have shaped the bagels, before boiling, let them rise for a further hour so they are not so heavy.  That was the only comment that the kids made and I have made them hundreds of times now since finding this recipe.....Thank you

I have a bagel maker which makes the boiling part much easier.  I hadn't thought of boiling them in a skillet.

Excellent Recipe! Don't need bread machine.  Mix as usual just heat the water and butter before adding.  Use only 4 cups of flour in mix and add only necessary amount of remaining 1/2 of cup as kneading dough.  Wait until the tops of bagels are slightly browned which may take 5 to 10 min longer than recipe calls for.

I suggest using high gluten flour/bread flour in place of the all-purpose flour.

Not bad for my first attempt at bagels, tho' they didn't turn out quite as pretty as I would have liked. Hopefully that, like anything else, will improve with practice!  I used butter rather than margarine and prepared the dough in my bread machine.

Excellent - easier way is layer water, salt, sugar, butter then flour and then yeast (didn't have a package so used 2 tsp yeast) in bread machine. Select dough setting and then make shape and place into water simmer and then bake - these turned out amazing!

The minor differences: I only used 1 tbsp sugar to bloom the yeast, I used cooking oil instead of margarine, and my oven takes longer to bake them.  Otherwise, I have followed the recipe exactly several times, and these always turn out yummy.  Protip: make sure you are putting the bagels somewhere warm when you take them out of the boiling water.  I had two bagels deflate because they were in a draft.

Awesome!  Totally tastes like a real bagel.  We recently moved to Hungary and they don't sell bagels where we live so I was sooo excited to find this recipe!  Not hard at all, just takes a little time.  2-3 of the bagels I made were still a little doughy and I had to bake them about 15 mins. longer than the recipe but I'm think maybe my water wasn't hot enough when I cooked them.  I will make sure it's simmering a little more next time and see if that cuts back on the cooking time.  I plan on making double batches and freezing them so we always have some on hand!  Very yummy! :)

This recipe was awesome. I had never made bagels before, and they turned out sooo good! I left some of them plain and put cinnimon, sugar, and brown sugar on the rest before I baked them! Sooo good! but before you try to form them read the "Step by Step: forming and baking bagels." it helped a lot and i didnt have any trouble at all.

Great recipe and easy to follow!  Our bagels turned out good but were, frankly, ugly looking.  However, I believe that is because we used all purpose flour and not bread flour as some others have suggest.  Despite their "beaten by an ugly stick" appearance they were delicious!!  They were gone within two days!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was my first try at bagel making, and even after being spoiled for years on NYC bagels, these are delicious! I let the dough rise for about 1 hours until it almost doubled in size.  Had to bake a few minutes longer to get the right consistency outside.  I've made this recipe twice this week already!

An excellent recipe, easy to follow and practically fool proof. Used butter instead of margarine   and halved the quantity of flour for whole wheat flour. Turned out great but instead of making 12 next time will make 8 to get the standard size for bagels. They are on the small size but good kid size bagels.

These are fantastic! 
I've been looking for a great recipe for bagels for a long time, I will be looking no further!  The key is the salt and sugar in the water at the boiling process.  I also made some garlic and herb varieties too, thanks for a wonderful recipe :0)

Nice & chewy with a great flavor. They were easy to make and tasted better than store-bought bagels. This recipe would have made a large dozen and we prefer mini-bagels, so I cut the dough into 18-20 pieces and made most smaller. I cooked the smaller ones in water 2 minutes on each side with the same bake time as the larger and all turned out perfectly! Yum!!

Yum!  Glad I made these.  Next time I make them I will use whole grains for added nutrition.  I did not have a problem forming the "bagel" shape.  I took a ball of dough, poked a hole in it, and then put it on the counter and shaped a larger bagel form without picking it back up.  Don't try to hold it while you make the shape, it doesn't turn out as pretty.

Good plain bagels.  They need a little longer in my oven, so I'll try to remember that next time.  The salt and sugar bath was interesting to me; I've always used baking soda, but this worked too.  I just boiled 3 minutes on each side, then dipped in egg and then toppings.  These turn out chewy and good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe yesterday and as it is here, it turned out okay. They didn't look the greatest, but the taste was great. My family all loved them. The full dozen were gone by last night. Today, I decided to try again and this time I wanted to make a few changes. I used this as a base recipe, and I did the following things differently:  - I used instant yeast instead of regular; - I wanted to make them cinnamon raisin, so I used cinnamon, raisins and molasses; - Instead of boiling them in a skillet in 1" of water, I boiled them in a pot, fully submersed. They floated to the top and I continued to boil them for another two minutes; - I allowed them to air dry on a cooling rack, placed over a tea towel before baking.  Now I don't know if it's just because of the changes I made or not, but I baked them for 40 minutes, and they have turned out amazingly well! This recipe will be the one I use from now on as a base for all the flavours of bagels we want to try.

I liked this a lot, it did remind me of New York bagels. I tried the work saving method of the bread machine, but was rewarded with more of a clean up, a yeast dough will stick to a non stick surface. I made an old favorite but hard to find salt bagel using course salt and they came out wonderful.

Add 1 T of Malt Syrup before mixing for a more hearty, bakery-like flavor.

mmm...these bagels are good. I recommend brushing the egg white on top before baking, it gives them a nice shine.

This is a really good recipe to use and they taste amazing! However, I would boil the bagels for at least another minute. I also shape the bagels with a cup and then stick a clean finger in the middle of it and spread the hole out to make the perfect bagel shape!

oh my goodness! I almost burnt my mouth eating one straight out of the oven just now and it was completely worth it. These are AWESOME! I used 1/2 C spelt flour, 1 C whole wheat bread flour, and 3 C bread flour. Hand rolled 18 bagels rather than doing the hole-in-the-ball technique. Used 1 t salt in the boiling water instead of two. Did need more flour while rolling the bagels, even though it formed a perfect ball while kneading in the bread machine. Not a problem, though! Gotta go and eat more!

After making another recipe and them not rising at all, I thought I would make 6 bigger ones. But they got huge! so actually they were too big. I added cinnamon and raisins. I am going to make these again tomorrow using a bit more of both and more bagels and possibly boil them for a little longer as they were quite bread like...but on the whole great!

Thankfully I found this, I was missing bagels after not being able to buy any after moving to Poland. This was simple to make and it is worth making.

This is an excellent at-home bagel recipe.  I used 4 1/4 cups whole-wheat flour instead of 4 1/2 cups white flour and added just about 1 1/2 tblsp more water.  I also added 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.  Bagels turned out soft and chewy.  Perfect texture.  They were a little small though, but very tasty!

This recipe worked out well for me.  I substituted 1 1/2 cups ground oats for 1 1/2 cups of the flour to add more nutrition with no effect on taste or texture.  As suggested in a review for another bagel recipe, I used molasses in the boiling water instead of sugar, but since I haven't tried it with sugar I don't know if there was a difference.  The pans need to be well greased, and even so the bagels stick; next time I will use parchment paper or a silpat.  They are chewy, but unfortunately do not have the yeasty/sour taste you look for in a bagel.  I made half of them cheese bagels (use very sharp cheese for this), and half cinnamon raisin.  They are delicate while boiling, so turn them over with a spoon or fork rather than tongs to avoid ruining the shape.

I had never made bagels before attempting this recipe. They turned out great! Next time I would add a little more water to the pot as some of the final bagels in began to stick to the bottom. Using a wooden spoon to mix is just as quick and effective, if you'd like to have less clean-up. I will definately make them again.

I used the bread machine for the dough, which took 90 minutes.  Everyone in my house loves cheese bagels, so I added about a cup of mixed grated cheddar and parmesan.  You could totally customize this recipe to make cinnamon-raisin, or any other sweet or savory bagel.  The recipe's easy to follow and wasn't super-messy (thank you!) I baked the bagels on parchment paper, which helps with clean-up. Ours turned out a variety of shapes and sizes (which is what I wanted;snack vs sandwich vs toasted) and they were all really, really yummy.

My teenage daughters made these today, following the recipe as closely as they could, and they came out great!  So good!  They used the bread machine to make the dough, and baked for 30 minutes total which seemed just right.

YUM. These were awesome. I followed the directions exactly...except for not flipping the bagels in the water for a third time on the first batch. I noticed on the second batch that the bagels were much smoother on the top if I did the final flip, and therefore much prettier. Either way, ALL of them tasted delicious even without cream cheese and my family couldn't leave them alone!

These are great.  It's interesting to make different flavors and use different kinds of flours.  I have mixed in whole wheat, oat flour, oat bran, flax meal, soy flour.  When you add whole grains just be sure to add extra water as needed until proper consistancy is achieved.  Whole grains soak up quite a bit of water.

Loved them!   My husband only likes one brand of cinnamon/raisen bagels so I wasn't too hopeful since this was the first bagel recipe I've tried.  He loved them! and I made some with onions and chia seeds in them for me and they were great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is simple and makes great bagels! The only thing I did different was allowing the bagels to rise for thirty minutes after I shaped them. Once risen though, the dough is really sticky so I had to use a spatula to move them from the tray to the boiling water. I definitely plan on making a lot more bagels.

I have been baking breads and sweets for over 30 years but I have just decided to make bagels. I tried another recipe a few days ago and it was a disaster. This recipe was great. I followed directions here, except I did forget to put the salt in the water. I also made 8 larger bagels instead of 12. The bagels had a great taste and looked beautiful. My husband, how doesn't eat breads very often, loved them and wants me to make more.

As three married women, husbandless for an evening...on a dark cool night...we decided to try this recipe! Boy are we glad we did! Our bagels were enrobed in poppy seeds, outfitted in cinnamon and left plain. What a delight these bagels were. AND WE KNOW BAGELS! Sincerely, soon to be chubby.

This was great and so easy to follow. Two suggestions. 1, you probably will not need all the flour 3 1/2 cups should be enough. Also, next time I think I will only make six bagels, these were too small.

Very easy even without a bread maker.  This is a very versatile recipe, because I made a lot of changes and even made a mistake or two, and my batch still turned out great!  I will definitely make these again.

These were great!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and made mine "everything" bagels with sesame and poppy seeds, a little kosher salt, some onion and garlic.  Some reviews said they were too salty, so I reduced the salt, but next time I will use the amount called for.  I didn't use a bread machine, and I thought they came together pretty easily.

Very good- excellent taste. For some reason my dough wouldn't rise, so after two hours I just made the bagels anyway. Very dense, but tastey! The malfunction was likely my fault.

my bagels turned out really ugly although, they tasted ok.  i wish the recipe stated how long to let the dough rise because i don't think i let it rise long enough and they were really dense.  my husband and son both gobbled them up.

Excellent recipe! My roomates and family request these "Better than store-bought" bagels constantly.  They are usually gone so fast I have to hide them so that I can have one with my morning coffee!

I doubted I really could make a "real" bagel from a recipe but I DID! The recipe was great.  My family thought they were good,too.

This was my first bagel baking attempt and I love this recipe. I doubled it, and they turned out fantastic! I substituted half of the flour for whole wheat, and will definitely make these again!

Turned out much better than expected! Soft centered, crunchy exterior. I've never had a fresh from the oven bagel, I'll never buy stale bagels again! The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 cup honey and and 1/2 cup molasses in my water because that's what I had on hand. I can't wait until my husband and kids get home to try these!! Thanks for the excellent recipe.

This recipe worked great! My husband loved them. We had bought some homemade ones from a mother raising money for a cause. They were ok, and I was happy to help out, but these were a whole lot better. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this one again, with cinnamon and raisins next time.

I made whole wheat bagels (2.5 cups of bread flour, 2 cups WW), they were excellent! I think the boil time needs to be a few minutes longer, a few of mine collapsed after i took them out of the water. I'll be trying cinnamon raisin tonight!

I'd give a four and a half if I could. We added garlic and onion to ours, yum. We really enjoyed these, but they were a little too dense and not as soft as we would have liked.

Taste was very good, in fact my adult son loved them. I am giving only 3 stars, as they did not cook well with given technique and time in recipe. There were portions/pockets of dough that were sticky and undone, some being along the OUTSIDE of the bagel which I found odd. I made half following the recipe exactly, those I didn't care for. I did other 1/2 following s shorter boil time as posted by another reviewer, 2 minutes each side. I also think it is important to allow the bagels to drain and dry well post boil before baking. I will make again, but with these corrections. Great with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, garlic powder, salt, cracked pepper, grated Parmesan cheese and finely minced onion all sprinkled on top. (Like an "Everything" bagel!)

These turned out really good! First time I've ever made bread or anything that had to rise, so I was terrified. However, they turned out very well. They took a long time to make but I suppose that is to be expected. I added egg white and cheese to the tops and they turned out lovely. Not quite round/smooth, but very tasty, especially with cream cheese. Very dense. If I have a couple hours to kill, I will definitely make these again!

Wow! Very yummy. I didnt use a bread machine. I kneaded by hand but, it only took about 5 min to bring the dough to a smooth elastic quality. I floured my work surface when I was dividing and shaping the bagels which made it very difficult to form smooth balls. I may just oil my hands a bit next time. I will make them again and again.

I just can't believe how well these bagels turned out.   They were so easy using the bread machine to do all the work and then just taking out the dough and making my bagels.   It was a quickie boil in the pan and then added sesame seeds to some and cinamon sugar to the rest.  They were just incredible.    Can't wait to try variations with basic recipe.    Just loved them.     Totally pleased with the ease of making them using bread machine-- couldn't be easier and the results were incredible. THANKS for sharing these Sally!!!!

The result is tasty, with a bit of a tough crust on the outside and a soft, chewy interior. The dough was tricky to handle (flouring my hands helped a bit, especially when shaping the bagels).

WOW- these turned out great! I am really bad at making bread of any kind and these actually turned out! I made the dough on Friday and boiled and backed them on Saturday. I topped them with all kinds of stuff. (cinnamon sugar, Italian seasoning, french onion soup mix) I followed the boil directions listed in the "forming and baking bagels" directions on here. I topped the bagels before i baked them.

Soooooooooooo awesome!  Living in the south, it's impossible to find fresh bagels.  I tried to make bagels once before, but they didn't come out quite right.  This recipe is amazing though, and i will make these bagels again and again!!!

Very good, used 2 and a half cups whole wheat and 2 white flour and they tasted great. Made 9 good sized bagels that held their shapes well. Try sprinkling with onion powder, mmmmm...so good.

So, so, so good! This was my first attempt at making bagels, a venture I had been looking forward to for months. Though I spent all afternoon doing these(stupidly, I used a small pan that could only boil one bagel at a time) they were well worth the time and will be treasured as gold. To make them everything style, I sprinkled with dried, minced onion; poppy seeds; sesame seeds; and kosher salt. Eating them right out of the oven, they didn't even need to be toasted. Just smother with a little cream cheese and enjoy.

In a nut shell, good recipe, easy to do, time consuming, but worth it if you have the time.

I grew up getting fresh bagels from a real bagel shop most weekends. For the last four years we have lived on a small island in the Pacific NW and there is no place to get a REAL bagel.  This was my first attemp to make my own bagels and they came out great. At the request of my family I made them the next day as well. On the second day I increased the temp to 400 degrees at 20 min. I also brush all the bagels with a light water/egg mixture to help the toppings stay on and to help crisp up the outside a bit.  These came out perfectly.  By the way, I mixed by hand and baked on a pizza stone.  I made two batches the second day.  One batch had 3 cups reg. flour 1.5 cups wheat...they tasted great too.  Thank you!  I will never again long for a REAL bagel!  The only possible problem is that my wife says this needs to be a new Saturday morning tradition.  Oh well.

They were gone an hour after i had them baked. My husband and kids were eating them as they came out of the oven! I didnt shape them as bagles though. I rolled them into sticks, and added cracked pepper to the flour before I mixed it so we could have them for dinner. The only other thing I changed in the recipe is how I boiled them. I boiled them in a large pot. I am way too lazy to stand there turning bagles. When they float, you know they are done! much easier!!!

Amazing!  I replaced 2 cups of the flour with whole wheat and they were soft and flavorful.  I dusted some with caraway and a few with garlic powder for something different.

I'm torn about this recipe.  It started out as a disaster and turned out to be really great bagels.  I used a mixer, and lost track of how much flour I ended up using (-more than the recipe - trying to salvage the big gooey mess).  They turned out to be quite a bit of work, but the results were quite delicious (almost a bagel with a croissant character).
(And yes - I agree with some of the others to cut back on the salt (particularly in the water).)

These bagels were fun to make. Although they did not taste like real bakery bagels and were a little tought at chewing they were delicious. I even made a misrake in the baking and they still turned out good. Try making these!!!!!

Sorry...I just wasn't impressed with these. They tasted alright, just not really like a bagel should taste.

After reading multiple reviews,  I  made these with a mixer (couldn't find our bread maker) These turned out wonderful!  I  let the dough rise after shaping them into the bagels for an hour. After boiling them, draining them on a towel,  I  brushed them with olive oil and topped with garlic. I  also made Asiago cheese bagels, onion with dried minced onions and some cheddar cheese bagels.  These taste better than Panera and Einstein bagels.  I  also kept an eye on the baking time to make sure they baked all the way through.  I did 30 minutes.  Perfection!

First timer here!!! It was delicious!!!! I didn't change much. Instead of buying store bought flour (which is devoid of all nutrition and over processed) I used my Komo Grain Miller (purchased from Pleasanthill Grain if I remember correctly) and milled my organic hard winter wheat into flour right then and there. Used organic sun flower oil instead of the recommended. Cheated and dropped everything in my bread maker on the dough setting. Once it was done, to smooth it out, I broke it up as directed and literally rolled it in my cupped hands until my arms burned for each one. (I only made 3 as it was my first attempt) Then I took my finger and punched a whole through, then rotated it through my palm with my index finger and thumb lightly pinching as I rotated to form a larger and more solid hole in the center.  I let it rest while I brought my water to a simmer and dropped them in. They puffed up pretty well. Then followed the rest of the directions. I cooked mine for about 28 minutes and they came out better than I ever expected! Absolutely amazing!

Used whole wheat for 1/2 the flour and then covered with sesame seeds and a lite sprinkle of salt before baking. Yum!

AWESOME! The first time I made these my husband said ‘it smells like a bagel shop’. We ate the whole dozen. They’re irresistible & light. Not as big as bagel store bagels-you can make less than a dozen. I made plain, sesame, poppy, garlic, onion & everything. They sorta deflate as they go in the simmering water. The next time I made them they didn’t come out well. Was it the metal bowl, metal tongs & spatula or Kosher salt (that would be funny). There were many things that weren’t the same cause I made them at my MIL’s house. It meant I used her water, which is hysterical, since she lives on Long Island! I no longer buy the ‘it’s the water’ idea that brainwashed me. As far as I’m concerned, there is no excuse! Thank you for this recipe! Please understand: Hubby & I lived our first 30yrs of life on LI, NY. Those familiar know it’s ingrained in your brain that there are foods you just “can’t get” (to NYers liking) outside the NY/NJ area: bagels, pizza (Italian), & Chinese. I’m not saying I agree just what we’re told: ‘it’s the water’ nowhere else gets the same results. We had a blueberry bagel in SD that anyone would’ve called a donut. While living in MA we got bread with our Chinese food, but had to buy white rice. We were mystified why we got apple sauce w/eggrolls until we realized it was their duck sauce. Then people from Brooklyn appeared & all was right in our Chinese Food world. Now we live in rural Upstate NY. We can get bagels & they’re ok but we have to go a distance.

We have made these a couple times now, and they are pretty good.  The dough is very thick and once cooked, these bagels are solid and hearty, but the taste is good and they are really easy to make!

Very good basic recipe to work off of. I have made them plain, added cinnamon and plumped raisins to the dough, dipped in "everything" spices, used dried apples. the possibilities are endless. thanks for a great recipe!

I made some sea salt bagels in addition to plain bagels. The plain were a little bland, but still good. Also, I had to lower the temperature and cook longer in order to get an even bake.   I would still recommend it to my friends.

These were really good and easy to make.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it took a lot longer then 20-25 mins to cook.

Came out tasting doughy although they looked good and the texture was good.  I baked them for 25 minutes and maybe they should have baked longer or at a higher temp.

LOVE these! I made them today for the second time in three days. They're incredibly easy since the breadmaker does all the work of kneading, rising etc. The only time-consuming part of this is shaping the bagels. The first time I made them I added  1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries, and the second time I made them I added 1 cup raisins and 2 teaspoons cinnamon. I used whole wheat flour both times and they were still light and soft. Amazing! I skip the boiling though, it doesn't seem to work for me. I just brush the bagels with 1 egg white mixed with one tablespoon of water before putting them into the oven to give them a shiny look.

I thought these we delicious! However, as bagels are, they are extremely time consuming. I don't have a bread machine and did it all by hand. I also added some raison for a little extra flavor. They turned out great!

I've been baking since I was 13 and never tried to make bagels. This was a great recipe to start with! Shaping takes a little practice to get that perfect look. I turned up the oven to 400 the second time. The only real problem I've had is not being able to keep up with the requests for more from friends and family!

Maybe it's because of the flour here in Spain... but my bagels tasted great but were soooooooooooo hard you could kill someone by throwing one at them!!
Will keep trying and changing the flour... Wonderful taste though... none left! (even though hard as bullets!)

I have made bagels before, but this recipe really did not turn out at all for me.  I live in NY and are searching for the best bagel recipe for salt bagels that I can find (actually looking for Manhattan Bagel's recipe!!!).  All went well until after the boiling.  They appeared fine, but were very unappetizing looking (not your normal boiled bagel lumpy) and I baked them for over an hour....the inside was still like runny egg white.  They simply did not bake on the inside.  I don't know what I did wrong - I followed the recipe exactly, however, it certainly appears that people had a great experience with this recipe!  I really don't know if I will try this one again.  I'm too a-feared!

For a first time try these turned out great!  I followed the recipe as directed(I did not make them in a bread machine)....except I wanted cinnamon raisin bagels.  So I improvised the recipe.  I added (about)3 tablespoons to the dry ingredients and I added 1 cup of PLUMPED raisins also to they dry ingredients.  I think next time I may add 1/4-1/2 cup more raisins.  I will be making these again!

Is about all I can say .. AZ you can’t get a New York style bagel and there is no substitute. if you want a New York style bagel this recipe is it..

The water used to boil bagels should have baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) added to it, not salt. It does two things: it imparts the moderate top-note saltiness to the bagel's taste, and it also helps with browning during baking. But I don't think sweeteners are ever added to the water. Most bagel varieties aren't sweet, after all. For something like a cinnamon-raisin bagel, I think the sugar just gets added to the dough.

I cut the salt in both process (low sodium diet). This recipe rocked. Chewy and crusty,  it is a real bagel no explaining  that they are home made.

Thank you for recipe, bagels are tasty . I made just 8 bagels to have them bigger, as well I switched to 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of AP flour.

Too sweet. I think the base recipe would be fine for sweet bagels  but not for savory.

Great recipe!  I did have to add a tiny bit of water and let them raise 30min to get a little bigger.  WOW, they were good.
