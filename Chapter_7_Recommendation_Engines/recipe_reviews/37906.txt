Based on some of the reviews here I made some changes.  In place of the Worcestershire sauce, which I really only like on beef, I used some cumin, corriander, chili powder, crushed red pepper, sea salt, and fresh black pepper.  I also used fresh lemonade, (real lemons juice, simple syrup and water) and a lot of lime juice.  I marinated the chicken in the lemon/lime juice for an hour, and I also simmered it until there was very little liquid left, like others have mentioned.  My family really enjoyed it.  Although I made some changes, the recipe was a great starting out point.  Thanks!

Added some jalepeno, fresh onion, red and green peppers, and cilantro to the pan after chicken had simmered for a few minutes.  It gave it some kick and a great cilantro flavor- even better the next day!  If no sour cream is on hand cream cheese is just as tasty!

Delicious.  I made only a few changes.  I used 3 - 10.5 oz. cans of white meat chicken instead of breasts.  I prefer the canned chicken in mexican food because it breaks apart easier.  I added a small chopped yellow onion to the marinade.  I used hard taco shells instead of tortillas but next time i will use tortillas.  I also cooked the marinade until all of the fluids had cooked off.  In the future I think I won't use an entire head of lettuce as I had way too much leftover.  Great recipe Tara.

This is a very nice recipe that the whole family enjoyed. The only thing I changed was I simmered the liquid all the way down. It made it much more flavorful.

This was so easy to make.  I wasn't sure about the lemonade, but really it give it a very delicious flavor.  My husband really loved them too.  The salsa was a great touch!  Yum!  I can't wait to make them again. Thank you!

I'm very attracted to recipes with unique preparation & ingrediants. So naturally this one caught my eye. The chicken itself was flavorful, but in the tacos it didn't stand out as much due to the other fillings. This recipe is tasty, but needs a little  kick to make it stand out more. I didn't use the bay leaves & added more lime juice. To cut out fat, I'll only use 1 tbsp. oil next time. I will also try a more intense, tart lemonade to make the flavor pop. Lastly, I think de-glazing the chicken in the pan would give a more tasty texture.

Wow! So delicious, even my super picky daughter that hates chicken ate her entire taco, and loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it, and now I am wishing I had tripled it because every last bit was eaten right up! So light, fresh and lemon-y, a refreshing change of pace for tacos, and one I will be making again and again, thankyou!

These were SO good!  I was out of Worcestershire sauce, so I used a little soy sauce (not much) in place of it.  The recipe didn't say what type of lime juice - I had both - so I used sweetened and it gave it a nice sweet/spicy kick!  I also don't use onion powder - I diced up some onion instead for a fresher taste.  I use granulated garlic also.

These would be really good if they weren't so sweet. The lemon and lime gives the chicken a wonderful citrus flare but the sugar from the lemon jucie makes you stop and wonder if you were supposed to taste that. Next time I'll use lemon water instead of lemonade.

This is a very good recipe. I was skeptical because so many reviews said that it was bland.  I found it to be quite the contrary. However, I did make some modifications (1) I used Simply Lemonade, which happens to be a very, very flavorful, sweet lemonade. Other reviewers used fresh squeezed lemon and/or lime juice or lemon flavored cool-aid. I think using Simply Lemonade made a difference in how flavorful it was (2) I also added additional spices: sea salt, fresh garlic, black pepper, chili powder, a bit of onion powder and half a packet of Adobo saffron seasoning, and added fresh pico de gaillo while cooking which was also used as a topping. I didn't use the worchister sauce. (3) I marinaded the chicken in the lemonade and spices for about 30 minutes. (4)I cooked the chicken in the marinade until it was completely reduced (gone).  My chicken was not bland at all.  It had a spicy, lemony, sweet flavor that was accented by, the fresh salsa/pico de gaillo and cheese. We don't eat sour cream, so we didn't include that. My husband enjoyed it. I cooked up the second half of the chicken breast on which I was going to use traditional taco seasoning, but my husband told me to use the lemonade instead. Also, the recipe was very easy and quick. I really recommend this recipe. I will definitely be using it again.

Three from me.  Close to a five from those kids.  I used homemade lemonade so it wasn't too sweet, or really sour either. I used three pieces with same amounts except decreased garlic to 1/4t.  Simmered till done then removed the chicken to a plate; increased heat to reduce to a thin gravy consistency.  Sliced the chicken & added it back.  Cooked till very little liquid left.  Tasted & thought "That was a waste of time." so added some salt, pepper, a tsp taco seasoning.  Still bland.  Added more taco seasoning & wasn't impressed yet.  'Went to work & came home the kids said it'd be okay if I made it again.  "You're kidding"  "No."  :?  :)  Go figure.  The kids, 12 & 14, liked it.

OK recipe, not something that I would constantly do, but it is a nice way to have chicken. Did the original recipe, maybe next time I will take some feedback from the reviews. Overall an ok recipe

This is excellent, but try this, instead of the worcester sauce, after cooking the chicken add one packet of taco mix and 1 cup of water or broth.  Let it come to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes (add more water if necessary).  Absolutely better than ground beef.

I am a Diabetic so I used the juice of fresh lemons plus added a tablespoon of lemon juice in the bottle.  I added 3/4 cup of water.  I also added real onions in addition to the onion powder.  I used cabbage instead of lettuce and it worked just fine. (I was out of lettuce)
Next time I might skip the Worcestershire and experiment with other spices.  
All in all- pretty tasty.  (although my girlfriend would want it to be SPICY!)  She can just add some cayenne!

My recipe is very similar but I use more spices, Chili power, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and sea salt, then I add a diced white onion and a diced green pepper, to serve people get their choice of, cooked white rice, diced tomatoes, green onions, jalapeno's, shredded lettuce, old or sharp cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream.  You can also add a can of refried beans to the chicken mix while heating it up.  Use hard or soft shells, and have fun!!! They are really filling!!

I made this for dinner tonight for my DH and I and we thought it was just ok.  First...this recipe does not feed 8 people as stated, it would probably feed 4 (8 if there is only one taco per person).  I added additional spices as other reviewers said the chicken lacked flavour, so I added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp seasoning salt in addition to the other spices.  So in the end, the dish wasn't horrible, it just wasn't anything exciting.

Low rating, but that could be my fault.  i tried to use up some leftover cooked chicken breast and use the ingredients to make a sauce to go over---but it didn't work at all on account of simply making the already shredded chicken soggy.  i'll try it again and follow recipe exactly for a more accurate rating next time.

I didn't really get a lot of flavor out of the chicken in this recipe.  If it had a flavor, it was masked with all the toppings.  It definitely wasn't bad.  You can't really go wrong with chicken tacos.  But if you were expecting a home run with this recipe, it wasn't it.  You could have just boiled chicken and end up with about the same outcome.

I followed the recipe, adding cumin, chili powder, cliantro, dried minced garlic., and 2 large fresh banana peppers seeded and thinly sliced. I also added 1# medium sized shrimp, halved, when the chicken was almost done. Next time I will begin to reduce the liquid before adding the bite sized chicken so the chicken and shrimp don't overcook. Otherwise it was quite good!

This was good. I made a few changes.   I sprinkled cumin, chili powder, minced garlic, salt and pepper, fine shredded onion (no onion powder), Worcestershire sauce, extra lime juice, 1/2 the lemonade, cilantro flakes over the chicken. It was very good. I only cooked it for 10 minutes, 20 is way to long and will give you dry over cooked chicken. No one wants that.

My family really loved this.  I simmered the chicken in the liquid, then shredded it, returned it to the pan and continued cooking it till all the liquid was gone--I added some salt and a southwestern seasoning blend for more flavor.  Excellent!  Definitely a do-again!

Was easy. Was easy to make half for recipe. Will definitely try again. Chicken would be good on a salad also.

Absolutely delicious flavor!  However, you will need to add salt.  Not sure why the recipe doesn't call for any.  I also added a bit of cumin and some red pepper flakes.  Don't worry that it will be too sweet, it's not.  Will definitely make this again and again!

Don't change a thing! I tried suggestions in other reviews and it was just not right.
If you want to spice the taco up use salsa.
The meat is perfect the way it is done.

I really don't get this one.  It's not that the chicken wasn't good, it just didn't taste like chicken tacos should taste.  The meat was too sweet (definitely the lemonade).  I even added some pepper, salt, chili powder, and a little bit of crushed pepper.  I wouldn't make this again.

These chicken tacos were AMAZING!! As I do with several recipes, when they only call for a couple seasonings, I still add to it. In addition to the garlic & onion powder, I added Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning, black pepper, a little cayenne pepper. I used Simply Lemonade & ReaLime juice. You MUST allow the liquid to reduce and the chicken should be juicy...mine was!! I will definitely cook this again.

I cooked the chicken for about 7 minutes and only used half the lemonade. The chicken actually browned a little instead of boiling in the liquid. Was very good. Also even better with guacomole and hot peppers.

I made this two nights ago and it was delicious! The chicken cooked in the lemonade/lime/Worcestershire with the garlic, onion and bay leaf was such a great combination and much better than I've had at any restaurant. The only change I made was to use a low carb flour tortilla instead of the corn tortilla. Very light & Tasty!!

Not impressed...why lemonade and bayleaf? To me, taco's are are supposed to have sort of a spicy Spanish twang to it and all I tasted was sweet and bland.  I even added cumin and Cayenne pepper but it really did nothing for the flavor. Now, for the rating, I gave it a 3 because the chicken was really tender and I liked that aspect, yet lacked in flavor.

Very good and fast and great for frozen chicken breasts.  I used lemon juice rather than lemonade as I don't like sweet mexican food.

WOW! I was skeptical of the lemonade - this was really different and delicious.  These are the modifications I made:  4 B/S chicken breasts - boiled in chicken stock and 1 bay leaf.  (then Shredded chicken) - sauteed onion/green pepper in oil, added chicken a good tablespoon or so of Bill's Taco-Seasoning-I (from this site) + the lime, lemonade, Worcestershire - sauteed and reduced the liquid to more than 1/2.  It was Delish!

I accidently burned it and my husband ate it up and asked me to make it again (which happens about 1 in 25 dinners).  I think it will be good not burned.  I did add cumin, red pepper, black pepper and salt.

Okay, but not as tasty as you'd think, given the ingredients.  Would be easier just to grill the chicken breasts without all the extra fuss--you'd achieve pretty much the same flavor with less fat.

Edible, but bland. Something is missing here. I suspect you could substitute margarita mix for the lemonade and lime juice. I might also add green chiles and a bit of cumin.

I tried this last night.Was very good. I did make a few minor changes to it, like i didn't use the shells or regular lemonade(low carb diet) I did use sugar free lemonade and turned out fine. My huband thought it tasted a little wierd but he's not a big fan of citrus but he said it was good. My kids ate it all up and wanted seconds.I let it cook until all the juice was gone and browned the chicken a bit.

Definitely interesting ingredients and easy prep. Smells great while it's cooking too, but only tasted so so. Not a good way to stretch chicken by any means. I doubled the recipe (2 pounds of chicken) and it was ony enough for 5 conservative servings! Also, I had lots of broth that got drained off -- I hate to waste anything but didn't have time to keep simmering. Probably won't try it again, but admire the originality.

This wasn't bad, but also wasn't great.  I think that I prefer grilling (even on the George Foreman, if the weather is bad) chicken breasts seasoned with Montreal Seasoning and shredding them for tacos.  I won't make this again.

I changed a few things, and have made it several times in the past month. Use Limeade instead of lemonade, omit the extra lime juice, drop the bay leaf. Mince fresh cilantro (about a tablespoon worth?) and add half a packet of hot taco seasoning. I also simmer everything a little longer to reduce the sauce so it's thicker. I love this meal.

Love this recipe.  Very flavorful.  Perfect for a hot summer night as it is quick (no oven, no standing over a hot stove for long) and it is very light.  I used canned chicken breast - cooks quicker and very easy to shred.

This was lovely & people raved. I used 1 tsp soy sauce instead of 1.5 tsp worcestershire sauce. I cut it down to 1 Tbsp olive oil. I also used more ingredients in the taco seasoning portion, including chili powder, paprika, red pepper flakes. I forgot the bay leaf and am curious what that would have added. The dinner was an absolute hit but I would have liked even more of a kick in the seasoning and will play with that in the future.

I created this recipe exactly as specified and did not care for it at all! It calls for lemonade which I thought to be unusual, and sure enough, the chicken tasted exactly like lemonade even after properly simmered.

As others suggested, I let the chicken cook until the liquid was completely reduced.  I also added a few extra spices--cumin, cilantro, and a packet of Sazon Goya seasoning.  Very flavorful, but my chicken was a little dry on it's own. Once paired with the toppings and sides (black beans & Spanish rice) in home fried taco shells, this was an awesome family meal! (Used Hard Taco Shells recipe) My kids helped with the preparation and really enjoyed making their own tacos.  This is a keeper!

Very weak taste. I did not follow the recipe exactly though so that may be why. I didn't have lemonde so I used a less amount of lemon juice. Still bland though also did not use onion powder but chopped onions instead. though i did not follow it exactly i will not try it again because i do not see how the actual recipe would make it any better.

These were the BEST tacos ever! I will never make tacos with beef again! My kids & hubby loved these. I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with a few others...let the chicken simmer, allowing all of the liquid to absorb. So tender. Thanks so much for this delish recipe!

this was very bland and disappointing. No good. After i tasted the bland boringness that is the original recipe I tried adding some chili powder, salt and some taco seasoning. Still boring.

Very good recipe. Followed as directed but we like spice so I added fresh jalo peppers and onions then simmered till juice was gone. Husband actually commented that it was good, which means I will make again!

This recipe is ok, but I would add cumin to chicken before cooking, and add chopped avocado and cilantro to give it a more Mexican flavor.

I feel like these lack a little bit of flavor. The flavor is there but it needs to be punched up a little. I will make these again, but with some minor adjustments.

OhMyGoodness.  This was SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the lime juice (I ddn't have any) and it turned out amazing!  Next time I'll add the lime and I'm sure it will be even better!

The chicken ended up being dry and tasted a little bland. I think if I ever make this again I will simmer the bone in chicken and add a little seasoning and salt the shred the meat off the bone.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because while the flavor itself wasn't out of this world the versatility is great. Besides it doesn't need to be super flavorful when you are going to top it with sour cream, salsa and who knows what else. We put the left-overs on rice the next day and it was like a chinese dish because of the sweetness of the chicken. It was pretty good. My "BOOs" liked it too :)

This was really delicious.  I cooked it until the liquid was gone as other reviewers had recommended and the flavor definitely stands out more.  No it does not taste like Mexican tacos, but they were delicious.  I did not have sour cream or salsa, but I used mashed avocados and it added that creamy texture.  We used soft tacos.  Oh yeah, we also doubled the garlic.  We will have to double this recipe because we were all wanting more. Yuuummmmmy!

The meat was great... very juicy and flavorful.  Agree with another review that you don't taste the meat as much once you add all the topppings.

Great recipe that I will be making again and again.  I did make a few changes for my tastes: a.) used the juice of a whole lime to balance out the sweetness of the lemonade; b.) used 1 chopped onion and 3 smashed cloves of garlic for a fresher flavor; c.) since the good fresh tomatoes are out of season I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained), much more flavorful than those hothouse tomatoes; d.) used taco sauce instead of salsa, the smoothness complements all the other textures; and added cumin, ground coriander, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and black pepper to taste.  I also let the marinade cook all the way down.

This was wonderful!  I too made a few changes, I used powdered no cal drink lemonade mix and it worked really well.  I added some chili with lime powder to give the chicken a little more kick.  I also used fat free sour cream, and home made fresh salsa. Also used lite taco cheese.  I added some fresh cilantro and mexican green onions too.
Next week when I make this again (yes, it's that good!) I'm going to add some black olives and some red onions to the cooking chicken. 
Great recipe, I would never have dreamed of using lemonade to cook chicken in!!

This was not phenomenal--kind of bland, but pretty good. Goes well with the rest of the taco fixings. Spice come from salsa or whatever you add. I would likely make it again.

Delicious and it really is easy. I left out the lime because I had none, and it was still good. Heating the meat in a wok is a good way to cook it through without drying out your meat, plus, you can leave it to cook with minimal attention.  Served it with a tomato-ey rice which everyone put in their taco with the chicken. Will definitely make again.

This was great alternative to regular tacos and the lemonade and lime made it even better. I left mine in the skillet till all the juice had been absorbed by the chicken it gave it a tangy taste and was moist. We didnt like the corn tortillas and next time will stick with the flour ones...over all a really good summer time meal!

Awful! As usual, reviewers give a recipe a high rating based on their own recipe. The recipe AS IS taste like flavorless sweet chicken. It was not good at all. Fortunately I was able to save the meal by adding green enchilada sauce, sour cream, and cheese. It still had that overpowering sweetness. But at least the family could stomach it this way.

My husband and I did not care for this at all.  I'm not really sure why you called it "tacos" since it had no seasoning.  It was very bland, and the corn tortillas did not help.  Would not make again.  We threw it out and ate chips and salsa.

This is one of the most labor-intensive recipes to make. A lot of chopping and dicing, then waiting for the chicken to cook on the stove, then the assembly of the tacos -- I would not call this quick .  But it does taste good once you assemble everything.   One way to make it quick and easy for a weeknight dinner would be to chop and prepare the ingredients ahead of time and refrigerate them until needed.  Then just assemble the tacos and reheat.

Pretty good! Just made these tonight for taco Tuesday  
I let the juice cook down and simmer in the lemonade sauce mixture. 
Topped with taco sauce, pico de gallo, shredded sharp cheddar, sour cream and shredded lettuce! 
I will make this again.
I think the next time I will use natural lemon juice with a bit less sugar or maybe add some type of spicy seasoning.

Like most other reviewers, I added a few things to the recipe. First of all, I marinated the chicken in olive oil, minced garlic, salt, pepper and chili pepper for an hour. Afterwards, I added a little olive oil to a skillet, let it heat up, then added the chicken. After a few minutes of it simmering, I added a few splashes of lemonade, lime juice and wostershire sauce. I added some cilantro, more chili pepper and chopped white onions as well. 

Total time in skillet was around 15 minutes.

This recipe is awesome. I swap out the chicken breast for ground chicken, add green onions and cut a lime in half and put it right in with the chicken to cook. This makes a great dinner and is incredible for salads during the week.  I recommend this to everyone.

They where ok, very lemony, I think they would have been great if I was in the mood for them. They didn't look appealing would be my complaint and the mind is tricky. They could have been great but I don't know, they needed something and most people tweaked them a bit so in conclusion the recipe needed tweeking so go with a difererent recipe or use this one for a base.

I made these tacos for dinner tonight and they came out delicious!   I didn't fry the tortillas,  just heated them open flame.  And mixed the raw chicken with the seasonings before putting it in the pan to cook.  This made sure that everything was well mixed together first.  I also added sour cream to my toppings.   Yummmmm!!!

I made this tonight. It was tasty. Sweeter than I thought probably due to the lemonade since I used simply brand. Kids liked it. My picky eater ate it and she normally wont. I marked it as OK because I might make it again... but it won't be at the top of my list.

I saw the the Worcester sauce which was a big red flag but with all the four star reviews I gave the recipe a chance, thinking maybe it would be something special. Boy was I wrong, The The Worcester sauce made the chicken taste like beef which clashed with lemon and lime flavors. The meal had a dirty confusing taste that was barely palatable. I would have had a more balanced and enjoyable meal if I went to Taco Bell. The food was edible but not enjoyable. Next time i'll read more negative reviews before deciding on a meal.

Not bad - I tried doing this in the crock pot with less liquid - 2 T. lemon juice, 2 T. lime juice, and 1/4 c. water. Cooked it on high for 4 hours, but of course not enough liquid evaporated in the crock pot. Had to simmer it on the stove for about 10 minutes to boil it off. Kids liked it a lot, though! I might try again with just the juices and no water. I also added 1T. chili powder for a little kick, and I might add more next time.

Pretty good! Only thing I'd have to say is that the meat is a twinge too sweet. I'll try something different next time to cut the sweetness out. But very easy to make and quick.

We loved these!  I didn't have onion powder so I finely sliced 3 green onions and added a small handful of cilantro.  My husband and kids said flour tortillas would be good, our corn ones fell apart.  So, instead, next time I will put a bit of shortening in a skillet and heat them up that way, they'll be less likely to fall apart I think.  We also had sliced avocado and chopped cilantro.

My kids loved the chicken  -they called it "Lemonade Chicken!" I simmered most of the liquid down so the flavor was really concentrated. It tasted like candy chicken. It was too sweet for me. Next time I might try to cut the lemonade w/  straight lemon juice.

Loved it! Make it just as it is! If you don't have lemonade, use fresh lemons and some sugar. Loved the combination of Worcester sauce and lemonade! Don't listen to the naysayers who want to "spice it up" with the traditionally boring taco spices. This recipe is great as is and I will definitely make it again!

It was a pretty good recipe, but not a lot of flavor really. I didn't simmer it until all the juices were gone for fear that it might over cook the chicken, but I will have to try that next time along with adding a few other spices to give it more kick. I like my Mexican food spicy!

Tried to follow other reviews and cook until the liquid was gone.  I am impatient.  I will try to wait until most of the liquid has cooked off next time.

It was ok, a little bland for those of us that like spice.  I added more chili, more garlic, more onion,  deglazed the pan and made  a killer guacamole.  I'm going to encourage some other cook to write another recipe and set the bar even higher.

This was okay. It was a little bit sweet for what I expected for taco meat but it wasn't necessarily bad. Just too sweet for me.

This recipe was great!  The chicken was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did add some avocado and cilantro to the choice of toppings.  Super!  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was delicious, even my picky daughter loved it. I did however, make some alterations due to lack of ingredients. I used a half of cup of lemon juice with a half of cup of water and 2 tbs of sugar instead of lemonade. I also used fresh garlic and onions because I didn't have the powder version. The other difference was I marinated the chicken in those ingredients overnight. Will definitely make this again and more of it!

It was a good idea, though I felt the chicken texture was too dry.  I don't like boiled chicken.  Next time I would add lemon juice instead of lemonade and use olive oli spray, then sauté.  Otherwise, it had good flavor & my family enjoyed fixing their own tacos.

Good recipe, but a little too sweet for me with the lemonade. I probably will not make again, if I do, i'd make sure the lemonade is weak in the 'sugar' department, and add some fresh cilantro.

These were a hit! So delicious.  For spices I used my taco spice mix that I got off allrecipes along with the lemonade and lime.  I followed the suggestions and let the lemonade-lime marinade really reduce and it made it so good.

It was okay but a bit lemony for being a taco. I made my lemonade fresh so its possible that was the reason. Still not bad, but not outstanding either

So good! I've seen this in my Allrecipes "tried and true" favorites cookbook (orange cover), but never made it - until now! I am sooo glad I gave it a try :) My fiance and I were pleasantly surprised (well, at least me... my fiance thought this was so-so). I pretty much followed the submitter's directions to the letter, but did make a couple of changes to suit my/our tastes. First, as many others have suggested, I too simmered my chicken until there was little sauce/marinade left (about another 10 minutes or so) and added a small handful of chopped cilantro (I chopped too much to use as garnish!). Note: you do not need to shred an entire head of lettuce, nor will you need an entire bag of cheese, jar of salsa or container of sour cream (my gosh!!!). You may need more than one tomato, depending on how big yours are.... Just prep what you need and use the garnishes you like (we topped our tacos with lettuce, tomato, cheese, cilantro, sour cream and salsa - mine with green, my fiance's with traditional 'red' salsa). One more thing to note: If you do not like sweet/savory together, you may not like this; although not overly sweet (like a dessert), there is a slight, yet subtly present sweetness to it. When mixed with the savory toppings, this is barely noticeable (IMHO). Served "tostada-style" with a side of mexican rice, this was a great, quick-fix meal. Thanks for sharing, Boos_Mommy!

My husband LOVED, LOVED, LOVED these!!I didn't have lemonade, so I used lemon juice and water.  I added cumin also.  I simmered it until it started falling apart.  pretty close to the end of the simmering added a handful cilantro.  The cilantro was essential!!  really made the flavor!  We served them on warm flour tortillas w/ fresh cilatro, chopped onion, rice and bean (on the shell), plus I used a tomatillo green sauce that I bought at a local Mexican restuarant.  My husband used their spicier red sauce on his.  FABULOUS!!  We will be eating these often!

These are the best taco we have had in a long time.  The flavor is so light and crisp that we rarely add too much extra to them.

this was pretty easy to do.  we used ground chicken and added chili powder as well, since someone else suggested it.  chicken was still kind of bland but the lemonade made it a little sweet.  will probably make this again with minor modifications to spice it up.

OMG... when I read the other negative reviews I was leary of this recipe. But I was wrong!! My family LOVED this recipe and I didnt change a thing. It was so delicious and not bland at all!!! The lemonade and lime make the chicken delicious and tender.Only thing I did was fry the soft tortillas but beside that followed perfectly. THIS WILL BE OUR ROTATION FOR FAMILY MEALS. GOOD JOB.

Good and simple recipe. I made a few changes. I didnt have lemonade or lime juice on hand so I used 1/3 cup water and added some chili pepper and jalapenos. The chicken was very tasty and the tacos turned out delicious.

Can be 5 stars with a little tweeking.  What I did different was to marinate my chicken in tomato sauce, lime, and olive oil mixed with taco seasoning. Then pan seared.  It was delicious.

I cooked this one night for my boyfriend on his birthday.  I was very nervous and it was the first time I had ever cooked for him.

He loved it!  He had three tacos and then fished off whatever chicken was left in the bowl.

I made this for my family when my fiancee came over for dinner, and after we ate a few tacos, we sat there eating the chicken! This chicken is so good, maybe one of the best I've ever had.

These were not bad but once you put the chicken in the tortilla with the other ingredients it tasted like plain chicken.  You couldn't even tell that the chicken was simmered with other ingredients.  So, although the taste wasn't bad, I'll save my ingredients for another recipe.

A great alternative to standard tacos! Simmer untill the sauce if fully reduced to maximise the flavor. Thanks Tara!

Great taste! I used flour tortillas instead b/c my husband prefers those. I've tried using those taco seasoning packs for so long and it never gave the chicken the right flavor. This was wonderful!

The marinade is really quick and delicious.  A nice update on an old classic.  Use more chicken than the recipe calls for, though.

This was very good. Kids and husband ate it up. As another reviewer suggested, I simmered until the liquid was almost gone. I think that made the chicken tastier. Will make this again.

Really good! I switched the steak sauce out for more lime and cumin, and marinated that for an hour like the top comment suggested. turned out really tasty, even if I forgot to use the sour cream and salsa!

Made this tonight.  After reading several of the reviews, I opted to double the batch, using 3 lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, and added 1 lb of extra small peeled and deveined shrimp.  Used Limeade  rather than lemonade.  Tasted halfway through, and was a bit bland.  So, I added lime juice, cumin and paprika to taste.  Let the sauce cook away, and this made a tremendous flavored filling.

Served with chopped red onion, guacamole, sour cream, mild cheddar, lettuce, and choice of sriacha and verde sauce.

This is now going into my keeper recipes and will get added into rotation of meals for me and my boys.

This was WAY too lemony!!! I only put 3//4 cup lemon and still way too lemony like i was eating nothing but chicken marinated in lemon for days.  I followed others and added more seasoning.  Will try again with just 1/4 cup.

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it at my dinner party. I did add  some chili powder and cumin. I simmered until most of the liquid evaporated.Once finished  I refrigerated until the following day. I wanted to shred the  chicken so when I cut the breast pieces  up initially I left them a little larger. When I reheated the next day, I shredded the meat and then added a little chicken broth.to keep it moist as it reheated. Thanks s dish was a HUGE hit at my  Taco bar party!

Very good as written. One of my kids thought it was a little too lemony, but everyone else loved it. There weren't even leftovers. I was really looking forward to using it in a quesadilla! Next time, I'll make more!

Like other reviews have said, I didn't include the Worcestershire sauce and instead included traditional Mexican food spices (cumin, chili pepper flakes, etc). I also swapped out the lemonade for 1/2 cup lemonade, 1/2 cup water. Next time, I'll increase the lemonade so the citrus flavor will come through a little stronger. Do what other reviewers have also said- let the "sauce" reduce to almost nothing. Wonderful!

Pretty much made it exactly as the recipe, except I put it under the broiler on low for some crispness. The flavor was good, but it's missing something.  I wonder if you put it in the slow cooker and shredded the chicken instead of cubes.  I don't know if it needs cilantro rice or what, but it needs something.

Bland at best.   I was faithful to the recipe (as I always do the first time) and even with all of those wonderful flavors in there I just wasn't impressed.   I had a bunch of chicken breasts that needed to be cooked so I doubled the recipe; it was like having boiled chicken...I wanted to reduce it but there was just sooooo much liquid.   If I make it again I'll add some spices that others recommended to liven it up.

We loved this recipe. I did exactly as the recipe said. I ended up making my own lemonade. Consisted of 1 cup of water, 1/4 cup sugar and half of a large lemon. Next time I will use less sugar. It was a little sweet but love love this recipe! We will definitely be making this again!

I Love this recipe. I used 1.5 lbs because that's what i had on hand and I think that was the perfect amount  for all the juice that was with it and the recommended cooking time. I also made with white rice and poured some of the  juice on it. I added a little salt while it was cooking and  made my own lemonade" with lemon juice water and sugar yo taste. Will definately share recipe with friends and make 
Again!!

Loved it!  Next time I would use 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice and 1/2 cup water.  It was delicious!!!!  Also, I used Chobani Greek yogurt and Ezekial fajitas to make it healthy :)

I used less lemonade, no Worcestershire sauce, and more lemon juice and lime juice. Delicious!

I would give this 5 stars, but I kind of altered this recipe more than normal so I will give it 4.  I don't know how it would taste as is..but I think Worchestershire sauce is gross soooooo.....
I used a about a teaspoon of Mccormick taco seasonsing instead...I mixed that, the lemonade (I used that Simply Lemonade) lime juice, the taco seasoning, garlic power, onion powder, olive oil and about a teaspoon of sugar.  I marinated the chicken with this for about 30 minutes then put it all in pan and simmered down until it was cooked. 
On a side note...I sauteed mushrooms with a little garlic salt, olive oil and a little whipped butter to serve with it and my boyfriend literally ate 3 tacos and all the mushrooms before I even sat down with mine. 
Hope this helps and enjoy!

I enjoyed the smokey flavor the Worcestershire added. Lemon juice was fine instead of Lemonade. I also made a pico de gallo with the sides along with the sliced iceberg lettuce. Laying the tortillas on a hot(electric) burner for a few seconds will give them a nice charred effect. Be careful tho! Lift off with a metal spatula. Wanted to add Avocado but forgot to buy a ripe one!

I really loved this recipe just as it was written- the best part was the simmering with the lemonade mixture, ended up being poached and a little sweet-really yummy.

I heavily modified this recipe because I didn't like the artificial, acerbic flavors of the garlic and onion powder or the Worcestershire sauce. Instead I put the sliced chicken in a bath of lemon juice (2 lemons per whole chicken breast,) cumin (3tbs,) paprika (1tbs,) cilantro (2tbs,) and 2 cloves minced garlic. I'm not against adding a lime, but they are expensive and I don't really taste it over the lemon juice. Even better would be to use fresh cilantro but I don't often have it on-hand. Then the whole thing goes in the skillet for about 6 minutes. I really try hard not to overcook the chicken because everybody hates dry chicken tacos.

This was so good! The only thing I would do differently next time is leave out the oil. The chicken was a bit greasy. I used the left over chicken the next morning in breakfast burritos with onion, Swiss cheese and scrambled egg. YUM!

Thought this would be more flavorful but something was missing for me. The kitchen smells wonderful and noone disliked it but it just didn't wow me. I did not change anything about the recipe except use real garlic instead of garlic powder.

I needed this to be as quick as possible, so I bought a pre-cooked chicken, shredded it, then followed the rest of the instructions. That worked out fine! Didn't have a real "Mexican" flavor as others pointed out, but with the toppings, it was good. Even my picky son liked it!

This is definitely a favorite taco recipe for us!  As is this recipe is 3 stars due to lack of Mexican flavor but adding some regular taco seasoning to the chicken makes it a 5 so I'm splitting the difference.  And please keep the Worcestershire sauce in there! It does add a little something to the recipe, especially if you are starting with the recipe for the first time without changes - you'll need the extra seasoning!

My husband is a man who loves his tacos, and he said these were some of the best tacos he'd ever eaten. I would have to agree. I used fresh onion and minced garlic instead of onion and garlic powder, and added 2 fresh jalepenos (diced) but other than that remained true to the recipe. Seriously awesome tacos!

I made this last night and did add a few of the suggestions of others. I did add a splash of Tequila, cumin and green chilies.  I also placed the chicken strips into my slow cooker and let it cook on low for 6 hours. Then I took forks and shredded the chicken.  I then placed it into a skillet and cooked it over med-high heat with the liquid it had cooked in, until that was nearly completely gone.  It was really great.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The rest of the family ate it but didn't say if they liked it until I asked.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I don't have everything to make this on hand often, I will have to remember to buy for this recipe if I make it again.  I think i would like to try it in the slow cooker next time.

These were good, I doubled the chicken, added green and red peppers, and added onion. Was kinda bland in flavor so I added cajun seasoning and more spices. With my additions, this made enough for four people. Will make again the same way.

My son loved it, I thought it was okay.  I'll give it 3 stars because my son is picky.  It was just a little "strong" but not horrible.  A nice change really.

Recipe was good, I just added curry powder, a little chili powder, and salt and pepper.  Overall, a good recipe.

We liked this recipe.  It didn't have the flavor I was looking for, but in the end I really liked it.  I even took leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving and used it in this recipe.  I did add some mexican spice mix I have to add a little more "taco" flavor. I've made the recipe several times and will comtinue to do so.

Very tasty! I made the lemonade fresh and only used 1/3 cup of it, added a half tsp of salt, and some black pepper. I cooked it until the sauce was almost gone and shredded the chicken while it was still cooking. It turned out fantastic! Even my somewhat picky 3 year old was asking for more.

These were good, although I would not classify them as great.  I thought the chicken would have more flavor.  I liked them and will probably make again unless I find another recipe that I like better for chicken tacos.  It may be because I used Crystal Light Instant Lemonade.  Maybe the flavor was more bland for that reason. It is a good alternative to beef tacos though.  We enjoyed. Thanks.

I make this all the time.  I love it!  It's a great, quick meal.  I use the whole wheat soft tacos and I grill them straight on the burner.  Awesome!

Delicious and so easy! I made these with Quorn chicken pieces. Used 1 1/2 cups of Kool-Aid lemonade, and added onion salt in place of the onion powder and salt. I also added cayenne pepper for a little kick. Served with a mozarella mix, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes. Great flavor and so quick to make!

I follow the directions on this recipe but the chicken didn't have much flavor. I think if you used the ingredients as a marinade the chicken would have more of a flavor. I think next time I will try that and see if it helps.

These were okay. I let the chicken simmer all the way down until there was no more marinade so the chicken could get as much flavor as possible. After the recommended 15-20 minutes the chicken didn't have much flavor. My husband didn't mind eating them but it's not something I'd go out of my way to make again.
