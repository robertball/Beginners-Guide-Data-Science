Simple, rich and excellent dinner. I made two changes. I thought I bought cheese ravioli, but I bought butternut ravioli by accident. It turned into a happy accident BTW I also tossed a handful of fresh basil leaves while layering cuz my basil plants are shivering and threatening to turn. In spite of my changes, this was excellent. Very velvety and yummy. Sparky gave it a very big thumbs up too. Assemble the ingredients and keep them chilled early in the day and quickly layer and you have dinner on the table in 30 minutes.Nice enough to serve to company too. Crisp chardonnay, crusty bread and a romaine wedge balances this nicely. Thanks so much for sharing this K-Dub. Excellent!

DELICIOUS! I did omit the chicken, but added some sauteed mushrooms, onion and garlic in with the alfredo sauce that I made homemade. Also added a layer of homemade pesto in the middle, and that was an awesome addition. I loved the flavors/richness of this dish and the fact that you can add whatever you like and come out with a simple, yet tasty meal. Made this a bit ahead of time and just baked it when I was ready, and that worked out well. I servd this w/ a salad and garlic bread. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a quick and easy dinner.  The only think do different is I throw in some fresh baby spinach.  It is so good and I love how quick it is.

Very easy, very rich and very, very good!! We really enjoyed this. I had a couple of packages of the refrigerated chicken and cheese ravioli and approx. 1/2 of a container of the alfredo sauce that is sold with the pasta. I added that alfredo to a jar of mushroom alfredo from the pantry and it was perfect. Using the 2 packages of pasta, the top layer was 1 or 2 ravioli short but it wasn't noticed.  I sauted some onion and a little garlic with the chicken, seasoned well and backed the Italian seasoning down to 1 TBS. Perfect for our taste and received many compliments. Thanks for sharing, K-Dub! We will enjoy this often.

Delicious! How could it not be, creamy cheesy goodness! I skipped the chicken, just too lazy to make it. I used spinach and cheese ravioli and forgot to put the parmesan on, so I just added it once the pasta was served. I used a little less mozzarella to save some fat, but I think I also used a smaller package of ravioli, so it worked out to a good amount of cheeseyness anyway. Excellent recipe K-Dub!

Great base of a recipe, you can make this a hundred different ways.. I omitted the chicken, used beef ravioli's and added a bag of frozen vegetables. This is so easy and you can always keep a bag of ravioli's in the freezer for a fast last minute dinner. thanks for sharing!

Loved your casserole and have wonderful leftovers to enjoy. I used 4 small chx breasts, totalling 1 lb. After sauteeing, I used the same pan to sautee 4 minced garlic cloves, 1/4 chopped onion and a 6 oz bag of baby spinach. Mixed all with the cooked cubed chx and proceeded to build the casserole. I opted to use tortallini as we had recently had ravioli for dinner. I used Classico Lite Asiago Romano Alfredo Sauce - very yummy. Topped with pecorino romano. Definitely will be making this dish again! Thanks K-Dub for a winning recipe!

This was good, but could have been better. It needed more sauce, we thought, and the chicken could use more seasoning other than the italian seasoning. I will make again, but will tweak it some. A good starter recipe.

DH & I loved this dish! I did cut in half since just for two, cut back a little more on the Italian seasoning for DH's preference, chopped some leftover steamed broccoli & added that. A delicious meal with a simple salad & garlic bread. Leftovers heated nicely for lunch.

Great Recipe! I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing and sprinkled with Italian seasoning. The Italian dressing gave it a beautiful flavor.

I think using tortellini instead of ravioli would make this recipe a little bit better. I would also add some diced tomatoes next time

This was a huge hit with my husband and I! I used what I had on hand, not because I wanted to change the recipe but because we were having a huge snowstorm and I keep my freezer and pantry stocked for our cold Illinois winters. I had some refrigerated cheese ravioli and Alfredo sauce that came with it. I also had some fresh mozzarella but only Parmesan from the "green can." I also pull rotisserie chicken from the bone and freeze or refrigerate to use in casseroles. When I knew we were having the storm I got two of them. We are huge vegetable lovers so I added fresh blanched asparagus. This was so delicious! This would be great as written or with broccoli as well.

Very good, very simple to make, and very rich!  I definitely wouldn't make this on a regular basis.  Minor changes I would make are to reduce the amount of italian seasoning a bit.  I would also salt/pepper the chicken instead of the entire dish.  And last but not least I would change the type of ravioli.  I like cheese raviolis but don't love them, but this recipe is versatile so you could use just about any type.

Made this recently and subbed in marinara sauce for the alfredo, since we prefer it.  Big hit with the whole family, especially the kids.

We loved this! I threw in some leftover spinach & fresh sauteed mushrooms. I also seasoned the chicken w/garlic, onion powder, seasoning salt, & 1 tsp of Italian seasoning(because I really detest it). Really wonderful!

This was  HIT at my house! I boiled some chicken on the bone(saved the stock for another use,of course) shredded it and made an Alfredo sauce using Laughing Cow wedges, Parmesan cheese,flour,milk and garlic powder. I had a bag of spinach ravioli and Munster cheese which I used. I even added a 1/2 can of chopped tomatoes and 1/2 cup of corn & peas, they looked like little colorful jewels amongst the white back ground.  Super easy and fabulous flavor! I Really enjoyed making this! Thanks a Heap K-Dub! Another Winner Winner chicken dinner:)

I made this with broccoli instead of chicken, it was good and even my fussy kids liked it.  Next time I'm going to try it with both chicken and broccoli.

Fabulous.  Absolutely fabulous!  I did add just a handful of Italian bread crumbs before baking.  But this was incredible.

I thought this was a great recipe. The whole family loved it! I added a little bit to it though to give it some color and flavor. I added garlic powder, red & green peppers and onions to the skillet while cooking the chicken. Yum!

I made this for Christmas dinner for a group of about 25.  Some were vegetarians and some weren't, so I made two batches, one with chicken, the other without.  This dish came out so good that people were asking for the recipe.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to take a photo before it was all gone.  I'd definitely make this again.

I made this recipe pretty much as it, the only thing I added was some garlic powder cause I think jar alfredo sauce is kinda bland. It was sooooo good! I think next time I'll add sweet italian sausage. This is def. going in my recipe book.

This recipe received high marks from my family. I made this ahead for a ski trip, and stuck it in the oven as we arrived.  It was easy to assemble and easy to customize.  I put chicken on half the casserole, and left the other half vegetarian.  I would love to find some easily available lite alfredo sauce to make it a little more healthy, but will make it again either way.

Followed recipe, with one exception I added spinach. Recipe was a little bland and a lot of sauce. So I roasted cherry tomatoes and threw those in for flavor and color. After the tomato addition, this casserole was delicious.

A few changes! first, I used the ravioli that I had on hand- spinach and walnut. Second, I replaced the butter with olive oil and made my own, lo-fat alfredo sauce. Added broccoli and it was delish! A nice way to make a one-dish meal with things you may have on hand!

Really good and super easy. My only change was I didn't have breasts, so I used some thighs. I just cooked them whole, and shredded them. Will be making again very soon!!

This is a very versatile recipe, depending on the type of pasta/sauce/meat you have. I substituted tortellini for the ravioli and it turned out delicious!

We knew we'd need something hearty and over-the-top tasty after everyone gathered to do our annual fall yard clean up.  This was a major hit with adults and the kids.  I also tossed in some baby spinach in a use it or lose it situation and the addition was perfect.  Big tossed salad and 2 loaves of Amish White Bread (AR) and we wiped it out!  Very good, very easy..oh yeah, prepping early in the day was right on!  No problems doing this one again!!

Simple, easy, not terrible. Not terribly innovative either. Needs vegetables (some color) also to improve the over nutrition. I used unsalted butter.

Yummy! I made this for my 8 year old grandson who is visiting for the holidays. I promised him I would make it again before he leaves. I too skipped the chicken and substituted mushrooms instead.

Compromising on dinner ideas can be difficult...until I told my boyfriend I was considering this dish. I told him the ingredients; he thought it sounded good. I made it!..... I was told I out-did myself! I added fresh basil after it was baked - Yummy! Next day leftovers included fried onions and peppers. I also topped mine with a balsamic sauce - Delish!! I would use pork or steak for a variation too!!

This was a great recipe. kids. love it! I made a few tweaks though. I used fresh four cheese ravioli from the refrigerator section. for the chicken I cut up into small pieces and used Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, onion powder and  garlic powder. And then I cooked it in a pan with butter and 3 cloves of fresh garlic. I did this because the Alfredo sauce in the jar can be bland and I wanted the dish to have more flavor. once the meat was cooked i added the Alfredo sauce to the pan with my chicken and warmed it up. Then I layered sauce, pasta, sauce, cheese. and I did that  untill I had two pans. served it with salad and garlic bread. it was awesome!

I made it into a vegetarian dish - substituted the chicken and replaced it with broccoli.  It was still really good.  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of 5 is because I felt that it needed a little more alfredo sauce and a little less parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  I didn't have ravioli on hand, so I just used Farfelle instead. I used leftover grilled chicken breast from the night before. I broiled it for a few minutes, and then added some Parmesan to the top before serving. Quick, easy, and the whole family loved it. Thanks!

Yummy, yummy!  I made this for friends and everyone really enjoyed it.  I made it as posted, next time I probably would just cut my chicken into smaller pieces just because I can, and perhaps I would experiment with a little bit of garlic - but my friends definitely said I should make it again.  I made it a day ahead of time and then baked it the following day.  I used a glass baking dish and it looked so beautiful the way it slightly browned.  Definitely a keeper.  My co-workers are eating leftovers as I write this review!

I've made this twice and both times it's been a hit with my family. I used a Creamy Vodka sauce instead of Alfredo and increased the amount (I used most of a 25 oz jar). I also added garlic salt and some fresh minced garlic to the chicken in addition to the Italian Seasoning as it was cooking. I recommend cutting the chicken pieces smaller than 1" to make it a bit more bite-sized and easier to spread on top of the ravioli.  My first grader said "thank you for making this" at least three times!

This is a great, simple, versatile recipe!  Instead of chicken I browned sliced smoked sausage with onions and garlic. I doubled the recipe and used one jar of Alfredo sauce and one jar of traditional marinara to make an easy tomato cream sauce. It all added up to an enormous dish that the family loved!!

Made this recipe for dinner tonight (as written), and it was amazing! The entire family loved it. Served with garlic breadsticks and Caesar salad.  Great to double and serve for company or a crowd. Super easy to make but tastes like a restaurant dish!

All enjoyed this.  After reading reviews, I decreased Italian seasoning to 1 Tbsp., sauteed a small chopped onion and a couple of cloves of garlic with the chicken, and added 1/2 can diced tomatoes, drained, to the sauce.  Will make again!  I would have added spinach if available. Oh, and I used "light" Alfredo sauce (by accident, actually, but now would do again)

Great recipe and a great idea too! Tried this with a soft Gorganzola added to the homemade Alfredo sauce along with some grated fontina and parmesean cheese. Also added some garlic sautéed in the butter for the Alfredo. Sautéed chicken cutlets to layer with the raviolis. Delicious, couldn't eating it.

At our house 4 stars is the best. My husband gave it a 5 star! It was delicious. I made it exactly like the recipe stated except I precooked 1 cup of sliced carrots and 1 cup of peas to make it somewhat healthy! I didn't know how many cups 3 chicken breasts would be. I cook my chicken breasts ahead of time, shred and freeze in 1 cup container. I used three cups of chicken mixing the Italian seasoning with the chicken in a bowl. (No butter needed) Very fast to make and very yummy. Thanks for sharing

My husband has a new favorite.  This is a great alternative to a meat pasta bake.  I added in red and green peppers to provide a bit more flavor.  Very easy to make and a hit!

The first few bites were...ok. it was so rich and creamy... but not in a good way. I couldn't even finish a small bowl before my stomach started hurting. 
Some might love that sort of thing, it just wasn't for me.

Great recipe. I added garlic and more seasoning to the chicken. Cooked it in olive oil. I'll definitely make this again! Next time I'll use cheese and spinach ravioli and add mushrooms. Taaasty!

Made without vegetables for the entire family and sauteed some mushrooms to add to mine.  Excellent!!  Would be wonderful with roasted red peppers too.  I used precooked chicken which made this even easier!  The smoky taste of the chicken was really a good addition. This was a hit at our house!

This was good. I think we'd have liked it better with an Italian blend of cheeses instead of so much mozzarella and possibly some breadcrumbs on top. I used Classico sauce which was fine but store brand ravioli which had very little flavor. I wish they still sold the Barilla dried tortellini in my area! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was very tasty.  I used shredded chicken that I already had on hand (first I mixed in the butter and italian seasoning for maximum flavor) with chicken ravioli.  Used an Italian blend cheese that had many types of cheese including parmesan so I skipped the last step of adding parmesan.  I layered a few fresh spinach leaves with each layer which gave nice color.  My 9 year old didn't even gripe about the spinach because I think it looked like basil in there... hmm that would be good too.

This was awesome and very filling.  I've made it several times with and without chicken (for my vegetarian daughter).
