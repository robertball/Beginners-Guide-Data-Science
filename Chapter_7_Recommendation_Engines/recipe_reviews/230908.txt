Very easy and very tasty! I did up the garlic a bit and added a little oregano to the mix. I brushed this over the bread vs. dipping and topped it with a little chopped parsley. Simple and delicious!

I love all things that are garlicky and buttery so this was perfect! I softened most of the butter and toasted garlic in about two tablespoons of the butter, then I mixed it together. Let the bread cook until it was crunchy, put the garlic butter on and put it in the oven for a few more minutes. This made it so the garlic butter melted into the bread, delicious!!1

3 ingredients!  Toasty, yummy garlicky goodness!  Absolutely foolproof.  This is exactly like the bread my husband's family used to make with all their BBQs.  Now I we can do it too!  Awesome!

About an hour before making, I chopped the garlic and added it to the butter that I had melted in the microwave.  The garlic flavor infused beautifully into the butter.  After toasting the bread, I brushed the butter mixture, wrapped the bread in foil, and popped it in the oven to heat. It worked out great and my family loved it.

VERY GOOD.

Added a whole clove of garlic.  Next time chop it more fine.

I made this and it was delish!  I followed others advice...after I toasted the bread I brushed it with the butter/garlic mixture, put it in foil and kept it in a low oven to keep it warm while I finished with the rest of the meal (scallops..yummy!)  .  It was crunchy goodness!!!!

This, unfortunately, did not work for me - not nearly garlicky enough. Not sure if I did something wrong or if it's just not a super garlicky recipe.

Tasty. I did brush the butter on instead of dipping the bread into it. Yum!
