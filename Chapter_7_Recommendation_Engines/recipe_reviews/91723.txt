This cake surprised me! I took it to a fall celebration at my church, rave reviews from really good cooks.  It had everything I in a recipelike going for it. Easy, to prepare & transport & great flavor.  I only had 2 medium apples so I used those + 3/4 cup chunky applesauce & sprinkled custard with cinnamon after baking.

Very yummy and soooo moist, I especially loved the custard top, the tang was perfect with the cake. The only thing is the custard didn't stick to the cake and they separated when you tried to put it on a plate.  Next time I will try poking holes into the top surface of the cake with a straw before I pour the custard to see if this helps the custard "grip" the cake at all.  Will definately make this again!

Make sure this cake has been refrigerated before you eat it - that is when it tastes the best. The icing is kind of rich, but soo easy, I love it!

Totally awesome cake. I put in some ginger and apple pie seasoning too. The topping is so good, you want to eat it in a bowl before you even spread it on the cake.
