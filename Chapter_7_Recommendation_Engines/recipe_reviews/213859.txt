I used the breast meat from a rotisserie chicken since I had that on hand. I liked it but family said it was a very dry pasta salad. I have to agree with that as I also thought only 2 TB of oil in 16 oz of pasta was off. Maybe add some Italian dressing next time? Still a keeper for me.

Wonderful Dish!!  Super easy after I got the sun dried tomatoes chopped...I did add some sun-dried tomato bruchetta (sp) to provide a little more tomato tatse and I used an olive medley marinated in red wine.  Looked so fancy!!  Will definitely make again

Enjoyed this better served cold. I used penne instead of orzo and next time will add some garlic.

This is a great recipe! I made a couple of minor changes to use ingredients I had on hand...black olives instead of Kalamata, and regular cooked boneless, skinless chicken breast halves instead of the Tyson grilled and ready. Other than that, I made it as written, and my whole family loved the results! We ate it with a garlic flavored Italian blend shredded cheese on top, and it was perfect. Thanks so much for sharing this one...we'll be making it again!!!

This recipe is great! I always forget how much I love basil and it goes so well with the chicken and tomatoes. I cook my own chicken breast rather than the pre-cooked stuff, so it takes a bit longer. But all in all it's a fast, easy, and light summer dinner. And sooo yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used a rotisserie chicken as I had just bought it.  The only addition I added was using the zest of the lemon I squeezed.  Will make this again.  If made without the chicken it's a great side dish...with it it's a delicious main dish.  A good pot luck recipe.

This was great!  Really easy and turned out perfectly.  Only change I made was to add some green olives as well (I like them).

I made this last night and it was great. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding roasted asparagus (I had it on hand). I did not use the Tyson Chicken I roasted my own - which wouldn't alter anything.  Very tasty and simple.

Excellent! It had plenty of flavor without a heavy sauce and was really easy to make. I kept the olives out of it because my fiancee doesn't like them, and just added them to my dish! I will definitely make this again!!

I followed this recipe, but found using only 1/2 of the ozro was enough and using black olives in place of Kalamata olives and using the italian dressing in place of lemon juice & olive oil worked great.  Had this for daughter's bridal shower, lots of  compliments and people asking for recipe.

Fun and easy to prepare. I made as written (except i grilled chicken breasts and cubed) and the olives were too powerful for my family. Maybe next time i will use black olives. Just our personal taste. Nice presentation.

I also sautee'd chicken tenders I had on hand. I made this for two, exactly as suggested but with TWO servings of orzo, not a 1/2 lb, and followed the rest. We both really enjoyed this, it was really easy & super quick & perfect for a warm summer evening.

This was really good.  I sauted fresh chicken in olive oil rather than using Tyson breast strips.

I Loved this1  I made one major change by substituting the orzo for Spaghetti Squash.    Cuts the carbs and packs in more nutrients.  Husband didn't even realize is wasn't pasta.

Pretty Good. Not an olive fan, but overall the taste was good. Easy to make, esp. if you use the pre-grilled chicken.

Delicious! The recipe called for too much orzo. I used half as much, which made the dish much more flavorful. I also just used black olives and grilled my own chicken.  Very simple, and my family even liked it!

I used farfalle pasta instead of orzo, slightly less pasta (could probably just add a little more olive oil if you're using 16 oz of pasta), feta vs. parmesean, added onion and garlic (powder for me!), mushrooms, and black and green olives along with Kalamata (I love olives!).  Awesome!!!!

This was pretty good.  Made the recipe as written, except that i heated the chicken, tomato, basil and olives in a skillet.  Then I added everything to the bowl with the lemon juice and olive oil, and mixed.  We did add more Parm on top, but second helpings all around :)

It can be a bit on the bland side, but for me, it's a good recipe to add to the box for a very quick dinner on a week that we may be eating out or having some richer dishes, to balance my menu.

We used used a can of black beans rather than the chicken, since my DH is a vegetarian, but we all loved it. I'll probably try vegetarian "chicken" strips next time!

This is supposed to be four servings, but we've had four and have at least another four left. The recipe calls for way too much orzo; I had to tweak lots of quantities. One pinch of salt for a pound of pasta??? Not enough pepper, lemon, olive oil, basil, olives, or Parmesan either. I would have added more tomatoes, but since they were so messy to cut (due to being oil packed), added red pepper instead. Next time, I'll use 10 oz of orzo instead of 16, and reduce the chicken. 

I did enjoy trying the oil-packed sun dried tomatoes, and while I was at it got oil cured olives as well - turns out I like these way more than regular olives. I added green beans because that's what's popping in my garden.

I took off a star because the proportions were so far off, but less experienced cooks might want to mentally take off another few stars and be prepared to do a lot of adjusting.

This was delicious!  I  am lucky enough to have a boyfriend whose a chef and every once in awhile I get to cook for him and he was very impressed with this dish!  Even went back for seconds! :) I substituted the basil, olive oil, and lemon juice with Italian dressing and marinated the chicken in Italian dressing as well. Also, I added in black olives. Simply amazing!  I will definitely be making this dish and adding different things to it each time!  Thank you for sharing!!
