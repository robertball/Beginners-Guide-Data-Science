I have used this many times and everyone loves it!  An easy clean-up tip.. Put about 1" of water in the broiler pan and clean up is a breeze, just por out water and rinse off, no scubbing!

We make this bacon, but haven't ever used the flour...just sprinkle on the brown sugar and pepper.  I love that you cook this in the oven.  It's so much easier that way!  (Spread a piece of foil on the cooking sheet for even easier clean up!)

This is heavenly.  A family favorite.  Just make sure to do a couple of pounds. I have a gas oven so it cooked it perfectly on 350 for about 30 minutes or more.  I put the bacon on parchment paper too which works great.

Now this was fun; it's so bad for us but it tastes very good.  I actually cooked it at a lower temperature to cook along with another dish, 350F for 35 minutes or so.  It came out nice and crisp, the bacon kept its shape pretty well.  As another reviewer said, I used aluminum foil in my baking pan to save clean up.  We'll have this again, I'm sure, but not often.  It'll be more of a special, rare breakfast treat.

The bacon turned out nice and crisp.  It was just a little bit sweeter than I would have preferred so next time I'll use a little less brown sugar.  Loved the baking in the oven idea.  Thanks!

This is a great way to fix bacon and something a little different than the usual. The sweet sugar and the black pepper went well together and this was a really nice dish. A little plain and bland though in comparison to carmelized bacon twists, but more suited for everyday or a nice weekend brunch. Super easy in the oven to make this. Thanks, I'll use this recipe again. It was pretty good.

This recipe is good but I tweaked it just a bit!!!  I mixed together 2 C Dark Brown Sugar, 
1 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. black pepper and 4 tbls. Dijon Mustard.  I slathered the mixture on (each slice) 2 lbs. thick sliced bacon and refrigerated it overnight in a gallon sized zip topped plastic bag.  The next morning, while the oven pre-heated to 400 degrees, i laid placed parchment on two large cookie sheets and placed a rack on top.  I spread the bacon on the racks and baked for 15 minutes; turned each slice over and baked an additional 10 minutes.

I have never used flour either, but do put in about a tablespoon of dry mustard.  It cuts the sweetness just a bit and adds "interest."

I had something similar to these at a wedding reception. I remember the cook saying the pans were a pain to clean after baking/ broiling them. They are delish and they went very quickly off the table. I tried these at home and clean up is long if you cook a large qnty.

I made Sugar and Spice Bacon for V-day breakfast. I happend to have maple bacon on hand but I think it made it even better. I think this will easily become a family fave.

This recipe as written for me was no good.  I should have omitted the flour.  I followed the directions to a T and what I got was bacon lightly coated in flour with no sweetness whatsoever.   I'm sure this is a good recipe w/o flour because I've had bacon with brown sugar wrapped around little smokies and that was awesome.

This bacon gets rave reviews, regardless of where I take it. I did take someone else's recommendation to bake on the broiler pan - clean-up was a snap and the bacon was even better.  While it was still hot from the over, I sprinkled a little extra granulated brown sugar on top - yum!

Be careful - I overbaked the first batch and it filled my kitchen with a burnt smell right before my guests arrived for brunch.  But the second batch was a perfect new taste and was gone before the "regular" bacon tray!

Pretty good. I think less bacon and more flour would be better.  I couldn't taste the brown sugar which was disappointing, so I add more and through it back in the oven.  It's very crispy.
