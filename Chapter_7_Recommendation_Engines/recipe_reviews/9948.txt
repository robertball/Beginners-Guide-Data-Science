Excellent cookies!  The original contributor is right; substitute some margarine for part of the shortening.  Our family also thought it needed a lot more vanilla; I'd triple what it calls for.  But the cookies were fantastic, and definitely a big hit!

This is without a doubt the best chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I've been freezing the dough in cookie-size balls, flash freezing them, putting them in freezer bags and giving them as extra treats to my friends when they have new babies.  I'm not sure if any of the dough has actually gotten baked, or if it all got eaten straight out of the freezer.  YUMMY!

I made these for a group of teenage girls who all said that these were great.  My friend who helped me make them even wanted this recipe to replace here usual recipe.  I thought they were pretty good.  But unfortunatly I really like a more buttery falvored cookie than these were.  I did use butter flavored crisco but it didn't take the lack of butter away.  These cookies are nice and soft.  I do like having more brown sugar than white sugar,  I like the flavor better.  When I make these again I will probably modify it a bit and add both shortening and butter (only a 1/3 or 1/4 of what it calls for will be butter until I find the right mix for me) this will hopefully give me the butter flavor I like and still keep them softness that I also like.  I have now made it with regular crisco, the flavor isn't all that.  Plus make sure the crisco hasn't be sitting around the house too long, that will make the flavor even worse!!!

This is by far the BEST chocolate chip recipe I have ever tried!  My husband usually only eats cookies when they are fresh out of the oven, but when I make these cookies, I can't keep him out of the cookie jar!

Pretty much all that you'd want from a traditional chocolate chip cookie.  First of all, they have great flavor. (Cookie dough MUST have a little salt for best flavor!)  They're moist, soft, chewy and tender, no doubt from the higher ratio of brown sugar to white.  As the submitter suggested, I used half butter and half shortening, aiming to achieve the best properties of both.  It doesn't surprise me this was "Grandma's" recipe.  They always seemed to know how to do it right. My personal preference, however, is for a drier, crispier cookie but that is just my preference and not a criticism of this recipe. My five star rating, then, is for those whose preference is for a softer chocolate chip cookie.  What's nice about this particular, softer cookie is that it doesn't rely on a lot of fat to make it so.  I believe it's all about that extra amount of brown sugar as well as making sure they aren't overbaked.

Me and my husband loved these cookies. However, we did not put the nuts in and it made the cookies a little saltier than I prefer. So I am going to try them with the walnuts next time.

These are a 4 1/2... I made them exactly as written, no substitutions or omissions. Missing the butter flavor I like in a cookie but otherwise well flavored. :)

FANTASTIC CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE! :) The only substitution I made was to use butter-flavored shortening as that is all I had. I baked for the 8 minutes, they looked underdone but I took them out anyway and let them sit a good 10-15 minutes on the baking sheet before I transferred to the cooling rack. They are absolutely delicious---a definite keeper! I used some leftover Grocery Store Frosting (AR) to sandwich some of the cookies with sprinkles for the kiddos. Thanks for sharing!

A good recipe that is very forgiving, each time I make it I throw in a few nuts, or some oatmeal, dried fruits, etc.  Whatever I have leftover in the frig. Cookies turn out perfect each time. Last time I made these I drank a margaritas while they baked, even MORE enjoyable

My family loves these cookies! I've received many compliments on these chocolate chip recipe, some were even shocked that these were home made from scratch.

I used softened butter instead shortening and, since I don't have brown sugar on hand, I've had to substitute white granulated sugar and add blackstrap molasses. I also have to bake them for a longer time - closer to 12 minutes to get them baked properly. 

I'm starting my third batch because I these cookies keep disappearing as quickly as I make them. This recipe is a keeper!

These were very good cookies, but nothing about these stands out from other chocolate chip cookie recipes.  I did use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and did not use the walnuts.

Tasted very salty but otherwise, very chewy and good. I dont keep shortening so I used a butter substitute, not sure if it makes a difference in the consistency. Use less salt and baking soda, freeze until they will keep a shape on the sheet while baking, and use a little more flour. Probably 1 1/4 cup.

These had a great chewy texture.  I did not have shortening, so I substituted margarine.  They tasted way too buttery in my opinion, but I can't hold that against the recipe, and other than that they were great!  I will probably use half margarine, half shortening or applesauce in the future.

I was looking for a recipe using shortening as an alternative to my usual recipe since I am out of butter/margarine. I doubled this recipe and realized that it is the same as my usual recipe with a replacement of shortening. I was thrilled because it will be such an easy and wonderful second choice to remember! My mom always made chocolate chip cookies with shortening so, in addition, these have the added bonus of reminding me of my Mother's cookies! I love that it says to bake for 8 minutes--most cookie recipes over bake, 8 is perfect!

I've tried so many different chocolate chip recipes, so far this is the best.  I tripled the recipe, using 1/2 c. margaine and 1 c. shortening.  I baked them, just a little longer, about 9 minutes. So far, ths is the best.  Putting this in my recipe book.  Thank you for sharing an easy recipe.

This recipe is fabulous!  I found it for a friend who tripled the recipe following the butter/shortening suggestion and had excellent results.  I tried the single recipe and also was pleased.  Just can't beat this one!

These are very good and the small batch is occasionally just what the Doctor ordered.  I had these in a basket on my table for unexpected guests in less than an hour.  I did not add nuts and I used a stick of butter for the shortening.  I also upped the flour to 1 1/4 cups.  Great cookies!

I made these exactly as described. I liked the texture but it is definitely lacking flavor. I'd increase the amount of vanilla next time, to 1 teaspoon or 1 1/2 teaspoon and I'd also do as suggested by others and substitute some shortening with butter.

Excellent--better than the Toll House recipe in my opinion, and it comes together easily.  I used half Crisco and butter to equal the 1/2 cup which gave the cookies a slightly more crispy texture which I like.  It made 26 nice-sized cookies of which I froze half (in individual heaping teaspoonfuls) for baking at a later time. (If you freeze them, let them come to room temp for a minute or two before baking).  I needed to bake them 10 minutes in my oven, but ovens always differ.  This recipe is easily doubled (or more) for company or for the around the holiday's.  Really delicious!  Thanks so much for this one and thanks to your Mother and Grandmother, too! :) p.s. My husband said "Man, that's a good cookie!" :)

This recipe yielded a great tasty small batch of cookies! I did not have shortening so I used butter.  I added the chocolate chips and walnuts according to my own personal taste.  I also threw in some white chocolate chips.  Baking time for me took 10 minutes. I've uploaded a photo of the cookies :)

Great recipe!! My husband has been wanting homemade chocolate chip cookies, this recipe looked quick and I had all the ingredients. They turned out so yummy and chewy. I made them exactly as the recipe says to. It made just the right amount for my family of 3.

Tasty standard chocolate chip cookies - I didn't add walnuts, but they were still delicious. The brown sugar adds a nutty flavour.

I was craving the chocolate chip cookie taste, but chocolate chips are not available in Malawi, I placed one Smartie (plain M&M) in the middle of each ball of dough. The cookies spread out quite thin, so a teaspoon sized ball is the best way to make sure you end up with individual cookies instead of one large cookie. They were very good.

Very good! Perfect size batch. The only changes I made were 1/4C shortning and 1/4C butter and since I only had XL eggs I used 1 XL egg white. They turned out VERY good! I will definitely make this again. My husband loved them!

We had a cookie-off, and made several recipes in our attempt to find the best CCC recipe and it was by a vast majority that this was everyone's preferred recipe. It has the flavor of a truly homemade cookie but the texture and presentation were of professional quality. We are much obliged to your grandmother for her amazing recipe and to you for sharing it with us.

I bake a lot, even sell my goods. I followed the recipe to a t. The cookies taste like nothing except shortening, even after using butter. They are too flat and just crumble apart when done.

Absolutely excellent. I like that it's such a small batch. The only real modification I did was use unsalted butter because that's what I had. I also used parchment paper to line the sheet because it helps the cookies release like a breeze. This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the advice about vanilla, added 1 tsp, and inadvertently used 1/2 of the shortening.  Fantastic!  Nicely rounded cookies with a great taste.  Doesn't make very many cookies, though.

I have tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes from this site and this is THE BEST COOKIE RECIPE!!  The ONLY change I made to the original recipe was to use only brown sugar and triple the vanilla like other users suggested.  Thanks for a great cookie recipe!! This is the only one I will use from now on!

I made this recipe exactly like it said - no substitutions or alterations - but it didn't turn out. The dough was very dry before  I even added the chips and nuts. The cookies themselves did taste OK but were kind of crumbly.

These were the best chocolate cookies ever! I was reading the other ratings and noticed some people were changing the original recipe, then giving bad reviews. TRY THE ORIGINAL RECIPE FIRST! If your trying a new recipe, why would you make more than one batch? It would waste all those ingredients!

I read the reviews and thought I would try this; I sure did think that was a LOT of shorting. Well the cookies have an alright taste they are not nasty by anymeans B U T !!! they fall very flat they need more flour to make them stand up. They ran all over my pan and I ended up with 1 big flat cookie. if you look up at here comment she says 1/2 cup margarine and 1 cup shortening I would try that insead of the all shortening. I will not be making this all shortening cookie agian. hope this helps.

Easy to make but I used half the sugar resulting in more of a cakeish cookie. Still good and the chocolate chips made the cookie sweet.

I picked this recipe because we don't cook with butter in my house.  The intent with these is to freeze the batter and bake the cookie dough into cupcakes.
I made a few substitutions: 
used 1/3 cup vanilla soy milk instead of the egg because we were going to be eating the dough raw
Doubled the amount of vanilla
Instead of shortening, I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil.  
The coconut oil gave the dough an amazing coconut flavor.  Not only did I eliminate trans fat from the recipe but I increased the omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.  It almost makes the dough healthy.

Best cookies ever! I omitted the shortening and used just butter, and added about an 1/4 tsp of almond flavoring. The cookies did not last a day in my house!

I doubled the recipe but used 1/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup shortening and yeilded 5 dozen delicious cookies.  This was my first time using shortening in cookies and I am very impressed.

This is the chocolate chip recipe I've been looking for.  I double it each time I make it and they're perfect every time.  I omit the walnuts because we just don't like them.  Thank you for sharing.

I've been searching for a chewy delicious choc chip cookie and I've Finally Found It - my search has ended!!  

These are SO YUMMY!!  I've made two batches this week alone - everyone gobbles them up!  I changed a couple of things though - 1/4 C veg oil + 1/4 C butter and 1 t vanilla.  Make sure to take them out of the oven just as the edges start turning golden brown.  

These remind me a lot of Freihofer or Entemann's choc chip cookies.  Make sure you have lots of ice cold milk on hand to wash these delectable spheres down with.

You won't be able to resist them - when they're still warm & gooey....... it's Pure Heaven!!

This was fantastic! I did have to alter the recipe only because I had to make due with what I had on hand.  No shortening so I used same amount of butter, no baking soda so doubled amount of baking powder, I used dark chocolate chips since I didn't have milk, and no nuts so I used same amount of dried cranberries.  Fantastic! something about the dark chocolate & cranberries that just made this for me.  Great recipe will make again!

Only had margarine so used that. Read a review that said batter was slightly salty, agree. Also, changed flour to one and a quarter cups. Baked up nicely, a pretty cookie. Thought cookie itself, altho perfect in texture, was slightly bland. Used chocolate chips and dried cranberries along with a few drops of almond extract. Will continue to tweak because of how it bakes up. I ended up with 24 medium sized cookies.

THIS IS THE BEST!!! OUR #1 FAVORITE. I've made these several times and they even beat out the tollhouse cookies!Fabulous cookie! Nice and crispy edges, chewy centers. My husband said these were "perfect". I've done these with milk choc chips, semi sweet chips, white choc chips and butterscotch try them with just one flavor or mix and match as I did, we loved them all, except the butterscotch. The butterscotch just didn't go with anything, so don't try those. I have used both crisco and butter flavor crisco sticks, these are great either way. I don't add the nuts b/c they prefer them plain anyway. This is great for a smaller family as this made two dozen cookies. I made Tablespoon sized scoops. I had to double this though the subsequent makings as they disappeared within hours and there were none left for another day. Many Thanks for sharing this with us!!!

I just finished making this recipe. The flavor is good and they bake nicely, but they turned out a little flatter than I usually like. I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. It probably isn't my favorite recipe, but they were pretty good and definitely worth trying.

This recipe would have been perfect IF you had used butter INSTEAD of shortening. I was out of butter and was deliberatley looking for a recipe that didn't use it. Big mistake. They just tasted.. blah. Bland and sugary. They formed a "crust" on top that, had butter been used would have been nice. I'll just not make cookies unless I have the butter to use!  Thanks anyway.

I think this is a never-fail recipe. I don't want to tell what mistake I made on the first batch I made, but I will say they turned out delicious anyway. This is the perfect texture for a chocolate chip cookie. My husband loved the ones I made a mistake on, and we gorged on the second batch, too. This is a perfect cookie! (I did use half margarine and half shortening.) Thanks Kit for sharing this recipe!

THe taste was good but they were too sugary. Also too flat. Did not rise enough and spread out too thin. May lessen butter next time.

Cookies turned out great.  I used only shortening no margarine or butter and was pleasantly surprised that they turned out so well.  I also doubled the vanilla extract and added one teaspoon of almond extract.  In my oven cooking time was 10 minutes.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've made in years!  They're even better than my Mom's old recipe!  They keep their shape without going flat and the nuts give them a crispy sort of crunch that makes them extra yummy!! I have made them three times in two weeks ... they're that good!

Soft and yummy.  I substituted 1/4 c. flour with cocoa, but that was it.  I selected this recipe because I didn't have butter and it called for shortening, but if I had butter, I probably would have substituted 1/2 the shortening.  I think we through in some extra vanilla too, as my 9 year old daughter and 7 year old niece actually made the cookies, and both wanted to put some in.  Oh, and I used 1/2 whole wheat flour too. (I like to pretend they are healthy that way!)

They turned out nice.  I will use margarine or butter flavored shortening next time.  No walnuts for me, either.  Also, bake at 325 degrees for 9 minutes so they don't burn on the bottom.

They're not as pretty looking as some other cookies I've made (they look all cracked), but they're pretty good.  I add 1/2tsp of corn starch which keeps the cookies soft in the center and crunchie outside.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll make it again (works well if you don't have any butter on hand).

These were sooooooooo good!  Although a few days short of grocery shopping day, I decided to make these with a few modifications...I used 1/2 c shortening and 1 c margarine...also 3/4 c brown sugar and the rest white.  Also didn't have any walnuts handy so did without.  I baked these at 350 for 9 minutes and they were absolutely delicious!  I followed the advice of the submitter and tripled the recipe...next time I will just double it instead.  I baked 2 cookie sheets full and still ended up with a HUGE (at least the same amount I baked tonight, if not more) amount of dough to bake tomorrow....BUT then again, they're going pretty fast...so maybe I'll stick to the triple amount! Thanks for these great ooey gooey fantastic cookies!

My family loves chocolate chip cookies, so I'm still looking for the perfect recipe.  These ones are right up there, but they were just a little flat for us.  I  made a few changes; first I quadroupled(SP?) the recipe then, reduced the brown sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used 1 cup margerine and 1 cup butter flavored shortening.  They were very tasty!  I may try these again but add more flour.  Thanks Kit!

I tried this recipe based on the strength of the other reviews.  I used half shortening and half butter as recommended by other reviewers.  The first batch that went into the oven didn't look done to me after the 8 minutes (I have an oven thermometer, so I knew I was at 350), so I left them in another couple of minutes.  Mistake!  8 minutes is exactly perfect.  Sometimes the timer IS better than your gut feeling!  These have the perfect cookie texture, great flavor, I am proud to have these at my house when the mother-in-law comes over, if you know what I mean!

These cookies didn't last a night. I made about 18 medium sized cookies and between my roomates, guests, and family they were gone before I even had my second cookie. The one that I did get to enjoy was great!

These are the best cookies I’ve ever made! I didn’t have shortening on hand so just used unsalted butter (and I browned it, because why not?!) and they were absolutely amazing! I added an extra tablespoon of butter after it was browned to account for evaporation and everything else as is (no walnuts though as I didn’t have any) perfection!

I wanted a dairy-free cookie recipe (one that was made to be dairy-free from the get-go), and came across this one. Used pecans instead of walnuts, and doubled. They are incredible! Highly recommend.

What a great cookie! I made these as is and they were great and tasty. But as any other cook would probably do, I made the 2nd batch and made a few small changes and they were excellent. I used butter flavored Crisco shortening, used all brown sugar and no white (came out to 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar), and I increased the vanilla to a full teaspoon. This is definitely now my go to recipe for a small batch of chocolate chip cookies so that I can cure my craving without overdoing it with too many cookies. Thank you SO much for sharing! :)

Easy to make! Had everything on hand for spear of the second cookies.  I made a single batch at first. Using a soup spoon to scoop them onto the pan it didn't make a lot of cookies. So I doubled the batch and made more. They all turned out GREAT!  Nice BIG cookies that don't drop (cave in) when you cool them. I have an older electric oven so 350 for 12 min was great for me.  Try them. I promise you'll love them!!

Used butter and tripled the recipe. First batch came out not really cooked but then flattened them and made them a bit smaller and they are awesome! Best chocolate chip cookies ever! They were still super moist days later, just like chewy chips ahoy- but better!

These cookies tasted ok, wasn't happy with the way they flattened when cooled.
I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts, pretty good.

Fabulous recipe!  I have made these cookies three times now and loved them every time.  After a little experimenting I found what works best for me is using 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 shortening.  Gives just the right texture for my preference.

I love the thickness and softness these cookies have, but I definitely recommend softening your butter first, and letting the dough chill for at least an hour, if you can.  I use butter instead of margarine.

These are so delicious! By far my favorite chocolate chip cookie. I used butter, since I was low on shortening, but I’ll make with shortening once I buy more. Unfortunately the first batch were very flat, and a little undone, yet I contribute that to my baking pan. The next batches were made on a pizza pan with holes, which produced a better formed cookie (I used parchment paper as well). All in all these cookies are truly perfect!

These were super good but I put them in for eight minutes and they were still gooey so, I put them in for 10 minutes instead and they were perfect. I added a tiny bit more sugar to. They have the perfect texture and taste I would recommend this recipe to everyone I mean I'm only 10 and the turned out great!??

Love these cookies!  My husband and son loved them too.  Then I took a batch to work everyone there loved them and they keep asking me when I’m gonna bring in more.

I use coconut oil instead of the shortening and they come out amazing. My friends call these "the cookies."

Perfect! The only change I made was a touch more vanilla. Let the cookies rest for about a minute or two before removing from the sheet. This will be my default recipe for sure.

I made a few changes to this recipe as I found it had way too much sugar. I doubled it and put the 1/2 cup white sugar in a doubles batch as well as 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I also used just margarine as I didn't have shortening.  I put 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup raising and 1.5 cups chocolate chips to a double batch. I'm also not sure who the recipe. oops in 8 mins as I had to cook mine for 18 mins. But nonetheless these are delicious cookies

Love love love this recipe. This is the only one I logged in to review and add a picture! 
Super easy and quick to make, even with 2 crazy kids running around. 
Changes: I used 1/4 stick real butter and 1/4 of margarine (imperial)
I read the reviews about some being flat...so I used a full tsp of baking powder instead of baking soda
** Definitely check them at the 10 minute mark as I too didn't think they were done and over-cooked the first batch. They were STILL deliciously chewy and tasty after 20 minutes lol!
I added semi sweet chocolate and peanut butter chips.
A WINNER!

Doubled the batch and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I would use a little less sugar next time as they tasted a little too sweet for my liking.

I also made these with a 1/2 Crisco, 1/2 butter mix.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as provided.  These cookies were good, but not outstanding.  Just personal preference. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. As per other reviews, I used 1/4 shortening and 1/4 butter, and I tripled the vanilla (1.5 tsp). I also doubled the chocolate chips (2 cups) and left out the walnuts. This is my new go-to for choc. chip cookies.

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe.  The cookies were slightly crisp and chewy.  My kids loved them.  This is an easy recipe to make.  I cooked them on my Pampered Chef stoneware cookie sheet.  I did have to cook them for 12 minutes instead of the 8.

I thought they were a little dry, maybe not add the extra 1/8 C. Flour I also had lots of chocolate chips left in the bottom of the bowl after making the cookies.

Perfectly sound chocolate chip cookie. I didn't put the walnuts in, because that's really not for me, and I used butter as my shortening. I also tried the jelly pan variation listed in the description. I liked how it turned out, but there was no indication about adjusted cook time, so I kept checking, and ended up about doubling. It turned out to be a shade too long, but not so long as to stop them from being gobbled up.

Excellent cookie recipe. I doubled recipe and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup of butter with a little extra vanilla extract. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet because that's what I had on hand.

I did double the vanilla extract, and made it with half milk chocolate and half peppermint chocolate bits. I didn't use any walnuts. They turned out perfect!!

This is exactly what I was looking for! I even love that it makes a small batch. I substituted butter for the shortening. They are amazing! This will definitely be my go-to recipe!

These are hands down the best chocolate chip cookies ever. The right consistency every time. I like to mix white and dark chocolate chips with a blend of chopped pecans and macadamia nuts. Super scrumptious!

My daughter made these cookies several times over the last few weeks and got rave reviews each time.  Today she asked me to purchase some of the ingredients that we were out of.  One of those ingredients was "white sugar".  When I looked at my sugar supply, it seemed adequate, but then she pointed at the powdered sugar and said that it was what she had been using...1/4 of "white" powdered sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as specified in the recipe.  The cookies are soft and so tasty made with the powdered sugar instead of regular granulated sugar.  An accidental substitution that makes these out of this world!!  We'll continue to make them this way!

Made the hem today. My husband likes a firmer cookie, I prefer chewy. I can enjoy this cookie instead of a chewy one now. It has the texture of what my grandmother made. I did double the recipe and used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco. It is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Instead of the shortening I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup plain yogurt. Very good but needed to grease the cookie sheet. Also cut back on the sugar a bit. Needed 10 minutes for mine but they came out delicious.

Fabulous, and easy!!

I had to cook a bit longer than 8 minutes, but they were soft and delicious. I tripled the recipe and used 1 cup softened butter & 1/2 cup shortening, too, and always use about 1/2 of the sugar called for kids never miss it with the sweet chips. For my own, I added dried cherries and walnuts for nutritional value - might as well!

My first review because just have to! I have been searching for a long time for a keeper chocolate chip cookie.  Doubled the recipe and got 3 dozen regular size cookies.  Did half butter half shortening and they were absolutely the perfect cookie for me.  Soft, chewy with a little crispy bottom.  Perfection! My search is over.

I did as the recipe stated except I tripled the recipe. I used a kitchen Aid mixer. I only added chocolate chips. I left them in the convection oven for an extra 6 minutes. They turned out soft and chewy and we're not runny. I even added a smidgen of extra shortening because I didn't want to waste it. I did not refrigerate the dough before baking. Three stars because I felt the baking time was too short and I felt they were a little too sweet.

Okay these have to be the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. I have searched for the best recipe for years now. I found a cream cheese chocolate chip cookie recipe that I love but as far as regular chocolate chip cookies these are the BEST. I refrigerated my dough for 4 hours before baking, and added half chunks with half chips and they're perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

Just like Grandma used to make. :) Would be perfect if using 1/2 butter.I followed the recipe exactly, using shortening since I wanted just a small batch and I was too lazy to soften my butter. I like that these are easy enough to stir up in a bowl by hand rather than get out my mixer.

I made a triple batch using the suggested 1/2 c. margarine and 1 c. shortening because I did not have butter on hand. These turned out better than expected! This dough holds it's shape very well, no overly flat or cake-like cookie here. Pull from the oven just as the edges and tops begin to turn golden for a moist chewy cookie, bake a little longer to please those who enjoy a crisp cookie. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great cookie. Easy to make. Most ingredients are already in the house. I place the batter in the freezer before cooking. This keeps them from going flat.

I like this type of cookie, it came out very moist and had a lovely flavor.  I did double the recipe and used half margarine and half shortening, baked for 8 minutes and cooled on the pan for 2 minutes then transferred to a wire rack.  Awesome!

This recipe makes a delicious cookie, slightly crisp on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. 
I made the recipe as written, with the exception of following the instruction in the original recipe notes, and used 1/4 cup regular crisco, and 1/4 cup butter.  The cookies were not too flat as some other reviews said, and did not need more flour or the addition of baking powder.  I think adding more flour would change the texture and taste of the cookie and I would not recommend it.  I also did not chill the dough before baking.
The recipe states it makes 12 cookies, but that would be 12 very large cookies.  Mine were a pretty standard size, I measured them after baking at 2 1/2 to 3" across, and I got 20 cookies from one original recipe.  
The cookies took 10 minutes to cook to a light golden brown. 
This is an excellent addition to my recipe box, great when you don't need a big recipe, and a subtle, yet tasty alternative to the standard chocolate chip cookie recipe.

The taste was good and a lot like any other chocolate chip cookie I've tasted. I had a feeling they would be flat however, so I added a full teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 cup more flour to thicken them. I'm glad I did as they turned better this way. Adding chopped walnuts or almonds gives them a tasty crunch too.

Just tried this recipe last night and loved it! The only thing that I didn't understand is that the cookies came out flat. So I added a little more flour and baking powder.

Loved it! It was very tasty, but I think it had to be kept in the oven alot longer than it called for. I also used chopped coconuts instead of walnuts and they tasted great too.

These cookies tasted great but they fell apart because of the shortening. I would recommend using butter. These cookies were very gooey and yummy.

I did make these cookies per suggestion from the person who posted it. I tripled the batch and used 1 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margarine and put into jelly roll pan. They where amazing soft and goey!

Two stars because this recipe did not work out for me. The cookies came out super flat and fell apart even though I cooked them longer. They tasted good though, they just need something to stay together better.

Very good recipe. Before baking I put the dough in freezer for an hr. Or so, found they set better. I followed with one comment on here and that was the flash freezing one. Great to have a quick dessert on hand.

This is my go to dessert recipe. It never fails. Everyone always loves these. I don't change a thing about them, except sometimes I leave them in the oven just a few minutes longer.

I didn't know Chocolate Chip cookies could be so good! I might reduce the amount of chips a little next time. Maybe. Just be sure to give a lot away. I didn't & put on 4 lbs.!

These cookies turned out delicious!!! I can't wait to make them again! The baking time was a little of for me; they had to bake for 12 minutes rather than 8. However, that could have been because I used stoneware cookie sheets (which I love). Otherwise, I love the recipe, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

Super great recipe- my family and job absolutely adored these! I read some of the negative reviews about the cookies going flat or runny- not sure where they went wrong, glad I didn't listen to the review and tried it out for myself since it looked pretty basic.

I chose this recipe because I didn't have time to run to the store for butter.  If you are looking for a shortening recipe, go ahead and try these, otherwise, move on.  I did triple the recipe and put in 1/2c margerine and 1c shortening as recommended.  I also increased the amount of vanilla.  I have made about a dozen different chocolate chip cookie recipes and I would rate this down at the bottom.

Excellent recipe. I doubled it and used half margarine half shortening as suggested. The only substitute was using milk chocolate chips. The kiddos demolished them! This is my new favorite choc chip recipe.

Didn't really like these, because of the texture.  All of my cookies usually come out of the oven soft and chewy, but these started to be dark brown around the edges while the middles were oily and almost as gooey as warm, raw cookie dough.  Other than that, the flavor was pretty good for an all-shortening recipe.  I just can't get past the fact that the middles were undone.  Probably won't try these again.

the dough tasted great!   Cookies came out with crisp edges and soft centers. ^_^ Just the way I like it.
