Good, easy, refreshing chicken salad.  Added a little extra balsamic vinegar and used baby spinach instead of lettuce.

This was really tasty, but it didn't do well as a sandwich...it kept falling apart.  Next time I would serve it on a bed of lettuce instead.

This seemed to be missing a layer of flavor. The basalmic over-powered the salad. It was okay, but not amazing. It needs good bread or, I hate to say it, but... a slice of cheese
