Awesome! I took these to my daughter's preschool class and one of her teachers asked for the recipe. :) I used half-dark brown sugar and half-light brown, and I used Â½ cup of regular Crisco shortening plus 1/4 cup softened margarine. I also mixed the water in at the same time as the oats, it came together fast. If your preserves or jam (I used Smucker's Strawberry Jam) are a little clumpy and doesn't want to spread, just pop them in the microwave for 20 seconds or so. It'll make it easier to spread them over the base. Oh, and lastly, I just sort of crumbled-and-pressed the topping part over the jam, I didn't arrange the dough over top. Very good bars!

I followed this recipe exactly, only used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Seemed to have a lot more peanut butter/oat mixture than jelly so it was a little dry. But very tasty and my kids loved them.  Will make again--probably add more water next time.

Mine didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture but my family loved them! They said it reminded them of strawberry newtons. After a couple days they get very crumbly.

Mine didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture, and it was pretty dry... but still yummy! I want to make it again but i'm not sure how to fix the dryness problem...

I don't know why I haven't rated these before--I've been doing them for years, even with my own homemade jelly/jam--my kids LOVE them!  LOVE THEM!

When I made mine they didn't come out near as pretty as the picture. Also they could have used a little more jelly. There were some parts of the bars where there was no jelly. Other than that they tasted really good.

These taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich!  My daughter and I made these together, and we didn't have enough regular oats to make the topping, so we used a couple of packets of maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal.  Now that added a yummy twist!  We used grape jelly.  Held together nice.

This is so easy & wonderful, my very picky 2 1/2 year old and 4 year old both loved them when I made for my 2 1/2 year olds preschool.  The teacher requested the recipe immediately.  Thank you very much for the great recipe!!!

These were OK.  They were kinda dry.  I did increase the amount of strawberry preserves.  Adding some cool whip on top made them better.

These were great. My changes: I didn't have butter flavored Crisco, so I used regular shortening, substituting 1/3 of it with butter. I used old fashioned oats, so I upped the water as well (doubled). And I used 1 1/2 cups of jam based on others' suggestions. I baked for only 20 minutes and they did not dry out. I dotted the 2nd half of batter on top instead of how the recipe suggested. Were delicious, creamy, chewy and wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

The taste is fine, but the texture is on the dry, crumbly side (even though I increased the jam/jelly to 1.5 cups and added a bit more water). This is one of those desserts best served a la mode or with a large glass of milk to offset the dryness. If I make it again, I will double the amount of jelly/jam, add a little more water, and serve it with vanilla ice cream.
