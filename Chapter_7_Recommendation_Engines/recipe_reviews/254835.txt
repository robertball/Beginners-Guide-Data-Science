I thought this dish was delish! I used fresh broccoli, asparagus and corn. I used  frozen peas as well and followed the directions to the "T".  It came out great.  I would make this again maybe add some more veggies like carrots for color.  Besides being really yummy it was so quick and being a mom of 4 quick and good is a major plus.

I made this as directed but used frozen peas and my own homemade pesto.  Great way to use your veggies.  I added asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  It would be great with chicken or even salmon added.

This was fantastic! I added chicken pieces, asparagus, and sliced cherry tomatoes. Probably will avoid asparagus next time, the pieces felt out of place. I also used linguine since that’s what I had. It’s a good base recipe to experiment with!

It doesn't get any better than this! So creamy and delicious, plus veggies! You can't go wrong with this dish! I would like to try it with some grilled chicken for a meal.

I added mushrooms and one hard boiled egg, chopped. I did not cook the frozen peas so they stayed a bit crunchy.

This was good. I ended up only using half the pasta since I wanted more veggies. Only had 1 jar of pesto but it turned out great.  This is delicious side dish!

Great way to eat asparagus! I cut everything in half but I should have used the full 8oz jar of pesto instead of only using 6oz of it.
