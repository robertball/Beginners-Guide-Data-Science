This was EXACTLY what I was looking for. I cannot tell you how much I despise those flat long dumplings. I like the plump, dense ones and this recipe was perfect. I followed the directions as given and just threw the dumplings into my chicken and soup I had almost cooked. Finished cooking for about 10min with the dumplings, they rose to the top and it was beautiful! I will use this recipe for chicken and dumplings every time!

I had a bunch of sourdough starter that I either needed to use or throw away, so I tried adjusting this recipe to make use of it. Instead of the milk and water, I added that much of the proofed starter and omitted that much of the flour. I added the started to the heated butter and added a bit of flour to feed it and let it sit for about an hour and then added the rest of the ingredients (omitting a bit of the flour and just dropping it into the stalk instead of rolling out). It was wonderful in our chicken soup, the only change I might make next time is to use a little less sugar. That might have been from the sweetness already in my starter though.

I was very skeptical to use this receipe, because for me if the dumplings are not chewy and too fluffy...needless to say, I am not happy, however, these were perfect! I just made my chicken and dumplings and could not wait to try.. and all I can say is that they are not too doughy but yet perfectly chewy dumplings!... simply perfect! thank you!

Yep, these were delicious! These are the dumplings I have been looking for. Actually, they were different than what I was looking for... but better than anything I have tried! I cooked about 12 minutes, and followed instructions exactly other than that, adding them to my normal chicken and dumpling recipe. I agree with poster who said they were too large, though â€” I would probably cut 1" x 2" squares next time and maybe roll the dough a little thinner than 1/2" -- but will definitely make these again.

I used these dumplings in a chicken soup (chicken and dumplings).  So tasty!  I'm a gadget person, so went ahead and used my bread machine to take care of the dough for me.  Worked like a charm.  I only used a little of the dough in the soup and steamed the rest.  It made unbelievable steamed buns.  Next time I will stuff the dough with some sort of a meat mixture, you know like the hum bao buns?

Just like my Nanaws!  I will use a little less sugar next time and more salt.  Nanaws were less sweet and a little salty. Dad said she also would saute onions till they were a mush, blend them and then put in the dough.

I had never made dumplings before but I love cooking bread with yeast so I tried these out and they were a HUGE hit! I'm a vegetarian so I substituted veggie broth and opted for egg beaters too. I was confused about the 'cut into strips' direction as it seemed they'd be very large so I cut them into 2" by 2" squares. I made potato soup to go along with them and ended up with a big time crowd pleaser!!

Well, this is what I've been searching for.. and I made it even healthier by change up a few of the ingredients.  These are the heavy, dense kinds of dumplings that I like.  I used only 1 egg and 1/2 cup of Egg Beaters.  I used only 2 T of reduced calorie margarine and only 1/4 cup of sugar.  I fed the yeast a teaspoon of sugar so that it really fluffed up before using it.  I had to use about an extra cup of flour to make it not sticky (perhaps because of the changes I made) but the flavor and texture was perfect after boiling in my homemade chicken broth for about 45 minutes.  Thank you so much for the recipe, I'll be using it again soon!

Very good recipe. I too added some sauted chopped onion, celery and carrots along with leftover baked chicken. I also threw in some baby peas and a little fresh sage and parsley I had on hand at the end. A very comforting meal on this cold winter day.
Thanks, I will keep this one.

This recipe was not very good at all.  I had high hopes based on the reviews, but it was so heavy and blah.  I made sure that I followed the exact directions, but I'm going to remove this from my recipe box.  I'm glad it turned out good for the rest of you.

These are by far the best dumplings I've ever made.  I used only 2 Tablespoons sugar (otherwise too sweet) and rolled out dough only 1/8 inch thick and they were the perfect size.  I also used at least a gallon of broth and could have used more.  I will not be looking for another dumpling recipe, THIS IS IT.

I liked these very much. I had to come up with something different from Bisquick dumpling since we were out of Bisquick. I liked them better..my husband still likes Bisquick dumplings.  I'm sure it's because they are salty.

These were really good, though not entirely what I expected.  They basically taste like really really dense dinner rolls. I found them much too large and actually preferred them when rolled to the size of a marble, as they do expand while cooking.

This recipe is not, I repeat, not for chicken and dumplings.  I had never added sugar to a dumpling recipe so was surprised when it called for 1/4 cup of sugar. (recipe for 3) I added 1 tsp, but that was still too much sugar.  The recipe might be ok for a dessert, but not for chicken.  My husband loved the consistency and said best dumplings he ever had, but if I do them again, I'll completely omit the sugar. Southerners don't need sugar in their dumplings. Don't add sugar to your Chicken and dumplings!

The consisentency of the dumplings were good, however it could have definetely done without the sugar.  The sweetness was so overpowering that it dominated the recipe.  I had even added chicken, carrots, and celery and couldn't taste it over the sweetness.  It also took much longer for the dumplings to cook than 10 minutes.  I would say it was more towards 20-25.

This was an excellent recipe! I'd been searching for a yeast (and not baking powder) based dumpling recipe on the internet for a while and this one, the dirst that I came across was a sure winner. I varied the recipe a little and yet the dumplings still came out wonderfully. Firstly, I trimmed the recipe down to a serving for 4. Instead of melting butter in milk I actually used buttermilk (for 4 servings use about 150ml). After leaving the dough to settle, I did find that I needed to knead the dough a little longer than the suggested 3 minutes but go according to the consistency of your dough. Mine was a little too sticky initially and needed additional cake flour to elasticize & harden it. 

Also I shaped my dough into little round balls instead of the strips and although I was a little apprehensive that they may not cook right through, they absolutely did. And boy did those babies double in size! Glorious. I simply cooked them for 15 (and not 10) minutes in the broth & they came out excellently. I used a combination of minestrone soup and spicy chicken soup broth to boil mine in and the flavour that it gave them was lovely. 

They were as heavy, delicious and hearty as I wanted. Im not a fan of the light and fluffy variety of dumplings. This recipe is going into my file of 'to prepare again' recipes. Thank you for sharing.

I usually make traditional dumplings with baking powder & thought I would try something different this time.  I had high hopes for this recipe but was not impressed with it.  I followed the recipe &  instructions exactly except that I cut the dough in squares rather than strips.  The dumplings floated to the top almost immediately but they were still raw so I let them simmer for another 10 minutes.  I found the texture to be that of wet, gummy bread.  Not liking to admit defeat I followed the advice of another poster & made steamed pork buns with some of the dough (it makes a LOT).  I just purchased some Chinese BBQ pork, minced it up & added hoisin sauce.  I made small discs of dough, added a heaping teaspoon of the meat filling & pinched it closed.  They were the approx shape & size of a golf ball.  I put the balls on squares of wax paper and let them rise a little.  Then I got my electric pressure cooker up to pressure with water in it, turned it off, quick released the steam so I could get the lid off and put the buns inside on a steaming rack.  I pressure steamed for 6 minutes. You could use any steaming method. They were pretty good.  The dough seems more suitable for steaming than for cooking in a liquid.  The 2 stars are for the dumplings - I would give the steamed buns 4. Perhaps if this is what you grew up eating for dumplings it is the recipe for you.  I will stick with the recipe my mom passed down & that I've been using for 34 years.  Why fix what's not broken?

Way wayyyy to sweet and there was no where near enough salt in these. I had to throw them out and remake them with different amounts because who wants a sweet dumpling with chicken stew?!?
I would suggest doing 1 tbsp of salt and 2 tbsp sugar, much better ratio.

I made it just as shown.  They came out great.  After the dough had risen, and rolled out, some was cut to 2" squares, and boiled in broth.  They were really good.  Another part was cut into 1/2" squares and boiled in the chicken soup, they were really good.  I had a little left over,  I cut 2" squares, and put it in the oven at 400F- they made really good dinner rolls too.

This is simply an amazing recipe for dumplings. It does take a little more work but it is so worth it. just be aware that this recipe says it makes 6 servings of dumplings. that's not the case. This recipe makes at least 8 servings. Other than that, you have to try this recipe. I've made it several times and I have never deviated from the recipe and I always get rave reviews.

I make this a lot using this recipe.  The only thing I need more of is flour in the end.  I use my kitchen aid to mix initially and then once mixed I use my dough hook.  Once the dough sets I cut into 4 pieces so it's easier to handle and roll out.  I cut into noodle size pieces and sometimes smaller.  The size and shape is preference for what you're making.  I always make a homemade chicken stock so once I take everything out I will boil them in the chicken stock which gives them a great flavor.  This is my go to recipe and I usually will make chicken noodle soup or make a gravy with the rest of my chicken stock and make creamy chicken and noodles for a delicious comfort food dish.  Great recipe!!!

Really good. Reminds me of my grandmas. I added less sugar though as I didn't want them so sweet. I also added it to my chicken needle soup in place of noodles.

This recipe was a terrific as written for an old fashioned "heavy" dumpling just like they recipe states.  I was very pleased and will make again just because it reminds me of old family style dumplings rather than torn biscuits out of a can that now people think are dumplings.  Home cooking takes work, but this was easy and satisfying.  Anyone can open a can of biscuits, drop in recipe and lie about it being anywhere close to a true dumpling made from scratch.  Well done!

Just what I've been trying to make, several times tough dumplings, but a 1/2 inch is way to thick I think next time 1/8 to 1/4 at most

The perfect dumplings for chicken and dumplings.  We have made these twice now and can't get enough of them.  We make our chicken broth and I recommend doing that if you have the time, it makes them so much better.

I'd say it was a good base for something better. Too much sugar, so next time I'll cut it way back. Maybe add some more seasoning, like Italian seasoning, black pepper, and serve with garlic butter. Nothing like taking a German dish and making it Italian! And due to the heaviness, I'd say it serves 8-10, not 6.

Wow! These are amazing! I had to try one right out of the water. Did I say, Yum? Well, YUM! 

Now, helpful stuff: This recipe makes approximately 60 dumplings if you roll them into slightly-larger-than-a-marble sized balls. Which is what I did. I also cut the sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup, plus one teaspoon to use in proofing the yeast. I didn't have any problems with having too much liquid or not enough with using the 4 1/2 cups of flour. I did allow it to rise twice - the first time it just didn't seem to rise as much as it should have, so I pulled it out, kneaded it some more and put it back in the bowl, covered it with a warm towel for about an hour. That looked better so then I proceeded to make it into balls and plop them (carefully) into the boiling broth. They rose to the top quite quickly but I left them in for a full 12 minutes and they turned out perfect. (YUM!)

I drained, cooled, and bagged half of the dumplings and put them in the freezer for an easy future meal. The rest I left in the broth and added left-over turkey from Christmas, a little salt and pepper, and turned it down to simmer. It will be our dinner tonight. I can hardly wait! 

Thank you for this recipe Rhonda35! They are awesome!

The best dumpling recipe ever if you are looking for a chewy dumpling.  It makes a lot so I freeze half the dumplings and they come out great.

These proportions are way off.  I'm still at the mixing phase.  I used 1/2c butter, 1/2c milk, 1/2c water, 3 eggs as per the ingredients list.  I am now well into 6 cups of flour, and the dough still hasn't formed.  
At 4-1/2c flour, it was a soupy mess.

These were fantastic and so easy to make.  My entire family loved them.  I even called my mom and bragged about them and she had me send the link.  Some of the best I have had in a long time.
