I made this today for my boys, using a pinch of apple pie spice, a little brown sugar and a frozen banana. They drank it up right smart.

This is a good smoothie that really does taste quite a bit like apple pie.  It's a good way to get my veggie-hating husband to have his vitamin A, and even my picky stepdaughter likes it.  I like my smoothies with more of a milkshake consistency, though, and this is far too thin for me.  I added as much ice as I could fit into the blender and it still didn't help much.  Next time I'll freeze the banana and probably some of the other ingredients before I make this.  Also, I think this recipe makes more than two servings.  It's about 5 cups even without adding ice.

This is very, very good!  I tried it after mixing everything together, and couldn't believe how delicious it was! I then added some vanilla protein powder.  That messed the taste up, so I fiddled with it for awhile, but never quite got that first yummy taste back.  I will be making this again and won't add the protein powder next time!

I enjoyed this very much. I think the more propper name would be pumpkin pie smoothie. I'd make it again

It was okay... I added some pumpkin pie spice, brown sugar and more yougurt and that improved it a bit.

I love pumpkin anything, especially when fall arrives! I cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 a frozen banana, and subbed skim milk for the apple juice. Of course, now it's a pumpkin pie smoothie instead of apple pie :)

pretty good!  I was nervous about the pumpkin flavor taking over, but it didn't seem to.  I served this as course one of a 3-course breakfast, and everyone was pleased.  Because of the banana, the consistency is more of a sipping smoothie than the kind you might dip a spoon into.  Perhaps giving it some time in the freezer would harden it up a bit.  Will definitely make again!

This smoothie tastes great and I can hide a veggie without my picky 2 year old finding out.  I added a splash of vanilla extract as well and froze it for a nice snack.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was spot on for what I needed...to use up some left over canned pumpkin from pumpkin cookies that I had made the week prior and to use up some brown bananas sitting in the fridge.  I sub'd cider for the apple juice and found Weight Watcher's Caramel Spice Cake yogurt and sub'd that for the plain vanilla.  Thanks for sharing!!!  My kiddies LOVE it, and so does Mama ;)

I skipped the apple juice which is way too much sugar.  I peeled and cut up an apple instead, cooked it in the microwave with a little orange juice, added the pumpkin (home canned-no added sugar), cinnamon and nutmeg, half the yogurt, the banana & 2 tbsp Splenda - put it through the food processor.  Came out nice and smooth - not thin at all, required a spoon to eat it. I could have added more yogurt to thin it down but we enjoyed it as is. Delicious, will make it again.

Just ok.   Imade apple juice ice cubes to use b/c I was afraid this would be too runny just using juice.  Added a little splenda which helped.  Might try it again.  Just needs a bit of tweeking to get the flavor right I think.

This was delicious! I used fat free yogurt, pumpkin puree and reduced calorie/sugar juice to make it healthier.

I’m not one for pumpkin. But this is great..add about 10 slices of apples and used apple cider instead of apple juice. And since I’m doing dieting I also added a scoop of vanilla protein powder.

Wish I could rate this 2.5. My mouth totally disagreed with this. But my wife thought it was allright.
