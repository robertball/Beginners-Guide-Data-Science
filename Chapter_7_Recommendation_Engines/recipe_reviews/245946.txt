Made this recipe for the first time and it incredibly flavorable!  I read the reviews and took the suggestion of adding  1/4 teaspoon of cumin, cinnamon, graham marsala.  I also added dried apricots, cut into small pieces which added a touch of sweetness.  Also I kept adding broth as it gets absorbed the more you cook it.  Delicious- will definitely make it again!!

This was an good recipe. I'm not sure if it called for canned sweet potato but I used fresh. After it was cubed, I softened them a bit so they would be thoroughly cooked. I prepared the eggplant before cooking by putting the cut chunks between salted paper towels to drain the fluid while the chicken cooked. I also added a teaspoon of Italian spice mix, garlic powder, smoked paprika and salt and pepper to taste to the chicken before I cooked it. After I added the eggplant, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, cinnamon, graham marsala. I served it as is with some pita bread.
I will definitely put this on my keeper list. Very tasty and easy.

I made it exactly as the directions stated but there was no sauce and it was very bland.  I added half of a can of coconut milk, some sriracha, dash of cinnamon, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and curry powder and then it was delicious.  We ate it over basmati rice.

This is so, so, so, good. Even the people in my house who don't like sweet potatoes, liked this. It's so easy to throw together, it's a perfect work night meal. Leftovers heat up beautifully the next day. I would suggest using a bit more broth than written as it incorporates quickly and you'll want that liquid later, especially if you serve it over rice or couscous (I served it over cauliflower couscous). Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was very good and so easy to make. My only recommendations would be to make sure the sweet potatoes are cubed evenly--makes it easier to get them softened and cooked. My husband cubed them larger than I wanted and it took a bit longer to cook. Overall, made recipe as written and it was delicious! Served along with saffron rice I made in my rice cooker.

I did not care for this recipe. Was searching for a healthy (alternative) meal and decided to give this one a go. I'm an experienced cook and know my way around the kitchen, but the prep time was seriously beyond the 15 mins as listed. (From start of prep to final cooking, I was just under 2 hours!). The recipe also did not state if I should use canned or fresh sweet potatoes, so I opted for fresh. (If I do this dish again, I will use canned).  Reading another reviewer, stating she had done the same, I decided to "soften" my fresh potatoes as well.  (I cubed the potatoes prior to cooking & these became a bit overcooked /"mushy"...I suggest boiling for only 7-10 mins.). Decided the overdone potatoes was not a big deal and continued on with the dish. I served this over brown rice.  The first bite or two seemed tasty, but I thought the tumeric and other spice combinations were very overpowering.

Very good! My husband is a very picky eater and really enjoyed it. I did feel like it needed a little salt. I served it with naan. It was a filling and healthy meal!

I didn't use the eggplant or the garlic and it turned out nicely. I definitely wouldn't call it a stew. I will make it again, though.

Very good.  I did add more chicken broth like others suggested and added a sprinkle of madras curry powder to add a bit more heat.  I would also suggest cutting the sweet potatoes into small cubes.  Mine were larger and took longer to cook through.  I also added salt.

Very tasty recipe! Stewed this recipe for over an hour, added some chickpeas to the pot. Also added more broth, garam masala, curry powder, and cayenne as some people suggested. Of course included some salt at the end. Since I cooked it with the lid on I had a lot of liquid left over, so I just added the basmati rice right to the pot. Delicious.

Delicious savory comfort food! I wasnâ€™t sure about the cooking times and the only thing I did differently is reduce the heat from medium high to about a 4/10 for simmer, then again I am a cooking Noob! I also added a lid while simmering to retain moisture.

Yes. I used olive oil and ground ginger rather than fresh ginger, but everything else the same. It's healthy and tasty but I recommend adding a jalapeno, also salt and pepper. It needs more of a kick to the flavor.

I used the couple of recommendations of adding cumin, a dash of cinnamon and paprika. Also, I substituted chicken broth for veggie and added a dash of cayenne for a little heat without altering the flavor too much like with siracha. I made it with some quinoa. This recipe will be added to my rotation.

I made the recipe without the eggplant and it was a little bland.  I added some dried apricots and cinnamon as someone had suggested and that helped.  I did like the dish and it seems very healthy.  I would make it again with my additions because it was so darn easy.

I needed way more broth.  But a very nice different flavor and satisfying warmth for chilly nights. I also added some flour to thicken.

I have been trying to cook healthier lately, so I have been trying to find different "unique" recipes. I saw this and decided to give it a try. I feel that this is a good base recipe, but as many others have stated, it is very bland. I added 1tsp cumin, curry powder, and cinnamon to this recipe and it still came out very bland. I think next time I would add more of those spices plus some garam masala. I also took the advice of others and diced my sweet potatoes instead of cubing and they still took about 25-30 minutes to cook fully. I ended up using more like 2 cups of broth instead of 1/2 cup as well.

I really liked the mixture of ingredients, but discovered in the middle of putting it together that I was out of turmeric.  I substituted curry powder, ground coriander and cumin in generous amounts as I like it spicy.  Also added salt and pepper.   Next time, when I have turmeric, I will add the chicken pieces toward the end instead of at the beginning, as it was over cooked and dry, but the veggies were great.

Loved it! Brought some to my neighbor - he loved it too, & some of my cooking is a little too spicy for him. Perfect as is, but even better when served with  a slightly spiced rice. I put in too much ginger - tiny piece leftover, didn't want to put it back in the fridge - but I simmered it a bit longer which reduced some of the slight bitterness. (It was also an old, somewhat dried out piece in the first place.) Added one diced, peeled and seeded plum tomato, rather than a bit more chicken broth to thin it. Definitely a keeper!

Decent base recipe but seemed very bland and 1/2 cup is not nearly enough chicken broth. I ended up having to add 2 cups of chicken broth and doubled the garlic, ginger, and turmeric. I also added cinnamon, garam masala, and cumin. The result was still extremely bland though I didn't have the problem of the sweet potato being still raw. The eggplant added nothing to the recipe and I think next time I'll leave it out and double the sweet potato instead. Also, I'll have to add even more garam masala and cumin to give it some flavor.

This was a great recipe and I loved the format. The only thing is that I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth to get it â€˜stewey.â€™ But itâ€™s also completely possible that I just didnâ€™t know what it was supposed to be. Regardless, it was a delicious meal and it a great recipe.

Made this tonight. Here are my modifications - not a huge fan of eggplant, so none of that; no red onion on hand, and used a regular onion instead. Also made my own low-sodium chicken broth (chicken bouillon cube and boiled water). This smells and tastes really good - didnâ€™t even have to add any other seasonings. This should also last me a couple days - nice work lunch and saving money for the win. Definitely gonna make this a staple meal in my house.

I don't like it when people change the recipe and then write a review but that is exactly what I did. I want to eat less meat so I  substituted Garbanzo peas for the chicken and I used Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I also skipped the eggplant but only because I did not have any. I served the stew with Nan . I really liked it and will  be making it again.

I baked mine as a Casserole vs. doing it on the stovetop. 

I seasoned the Sweet Potatoes as I don't recall seeing any Salt listed in the Ingredients.

I will certainly give it another try and hope for improvement the second time around!

I took the advice of others and added extra spices, I think it would have been a little bland otherwise. I added cinnamon which gave it a lovely flavor. Also garam masala and cumin. eggplant got a bit soggy so I would add closer to the end of cooking next time. Will make this again!

It needed more flavor - so I added a teaspoon of Garam Masala and 1/2 tsp of curry powder - and a bit more broth, and simmered it for an additional 20 minutes until the vegetables cooked down.  Next time I'll cut the vegetables a bit smaller, and perhaps add carrots.  

The remaining "gravy" thickened just right and tasted great.

(ETA:  Tonight - I made a box of Near East Mediterranean Curry Couscous ..... just perfect addition to the stew.)

My husband had two servings! He really liked it. I was not as impressed, but it was pretty good. Served on Israeli pearl couscous. Think it would be better on rice. Like others commented, I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, cumin and garam masala and more chicken broth during the cooking process.

I actually loved this dish, but the recipe required a bit of tweaking (I added an extra sweet potato and garlic clove). The prep time was more like 30-40 minutes because I diced/chopped all of the ingredients ), except for the turmeric (hey, I'm no chef, LOL). It required additional seasoning; I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, and added a pinch of kosher salt, black pepper and smoked paprika to the stew as it cooked. I liked it with more broth, so I doubled it. 

Just take the recipe and make it yours; you're gonna love it!!!

I made it exactly as in the recipe, and it was too dry and too bland for me. I ended up adding more broth, spices, especially cinnamon, and dried apricot. With those additions, I would rate it four stars. But as written n I only give it two.

We added the spices others mentioned. Cooked in cast iron skillet and served over cauliflower rice... it was fantastic!

This came out dry and I felt there was too much turmeric. I'm not a sweet potato fan but they tasted good in this recipe.

I pretty much followed the recipe although I added a bit of cumin and cinimmon as some others did.  I was camping so prepared it in a cast iron skillet over flames.  It was easy to put together and very taste.
