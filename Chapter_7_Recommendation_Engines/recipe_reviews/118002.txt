Very good. I used half olive oil, half butter instead of all butter. It was gobbled up, even by teenagers!

This is a super easy and really tasty way to dress up peas! I didn't have fresh pea pods, but I had a bag of the steam-in-the-microwave sugar snap peas. These saved me a step; I simply steamed the peas in the bag according to package instructions, and then made the rest of the recipe according to instructions. The finished result was very good, but not exactly spectacular. I did cut back on the butter; I cooked the onions in the 2 tbs. as recommended, but did not put the final tbs. in, because I thought the peas would get too greasy. 2 tbs. turned out to be plenty! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Amazing! Quick and easy.  I added part of a red pepper, just because it was there.

Very tasty and simple.  I used 1 TBS of butter rather than 3.  Still came out great!
