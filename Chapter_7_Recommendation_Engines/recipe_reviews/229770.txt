Oh My Gosh! This was great! I only had 4 chops and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, which I think you need, no green pepper, used a yellow one. Even my picky husband ask me to make this again..soon! Definitely use the cornstarch to thicken the sauce and serve over the chops.

I was wary of this recipe at the start and told my husband that I had a back-up plan meal, just in case...  Was not even REMOTELY necessary, my husband LOVED it!!! Took one bite, looked at me and said, "This is DEFINITELY a keeper." I did make a few minor changes. I used 3 large, 1/2" thick, bone-in chops (browned as directed). I also added 3 cloves of pressed garlic (minced would also work) in addition to the onion and bell-pepper mix.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used a 14.5oz can of no-salt added diced tomatoes and about 15oz of canned crushed tomato, and then doubled the sugar, vinegar, & Worcestershire sauce. I generally omit the salt from a recipe, but in this case I did grind a little fresh rock-salt and fresh black-pepper corns over the top of the pork chops after browning them. I also placed 3 bay leaves in the sauce over each pork chop. I cooked it on high for 3hrs and placed it over rice (did not use the cornstarch).  It turned out REMARKABLY juicy with a wonderful flavor!!!!

Good flavor the meat fell apart but was a little dry. I think I will cut the cook time the next time I have this. The sauce is very tasty and a perfect match with pork.

I threw in one tomato that needed to be used up, and only used three big thick chops, but kept the sauce ingredients the same. Did add in some shakes of dried parsley and ground pepper, minced garlic. The chops were done in six hours, and the sauce was so delicious, great served over a bed of rice to soak up the great sauce.

This recipe was great! Will definitely have to make again. I also have made a few adjustments as well. First off instead of brown sugar I added white since I don't like it too too sweet. Next I didn't have vinegar, so I added one of my favorite dressings, which is raspberry vinaigrette. Gave a nice flavor to the sauce. I added sweet peppers since my wife hates bell pepper when it's cooked but loves it raw. Go figure right? And also I added some minced garlic. Can't go wrong with garlic!!!! And I cooked it on low for 5 hours, anything longer makes it dry out. And instead of putting it on a bed of rice, I put ours on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and it was terrific!!!

For so few ingredients this was surprisingly good! Very quick and easy to make.   I made the recipe as is but did shorten the cooking time to around 5 hours which was plenty.  I find pork dries out quickly in the crockpot.

This was a fantastic recipe.  The sauce is wonderful.  I added about a quarter cup of Heinz Chili Sauce to the mix and it gave it the kick it needed.  I didn't add cornstarch, but rather just left the sauce as is.  It was wonderful to spoon over rice.  I reserved all the leftover sauce and peppers and used it the next day over bratwurst.  Excellent!  Thanks!

Delicious.   After browning the chops I sautéed garlic then deglazed the pan with wine and added it to the slow cooker.  I used bone in chops and cooked for about five hours.

My girlfriend (who doesn't really like meat) actually cleaned her plate for once! It was great and I followed the recipe EXACTLY because I believe you always should at first, but will make changes next time. It was a little too sweet, so I'll cut the brown sugar in half. Also, my girlfriend and I agreed it needs some spice so maybe a fire roasted jalapeño or some crushed red pepper flakes. I served it over white rice and my sauce was VERY thin, even after adding corn starch to 1/4 cup of the sauce then adding back so next time I'll leave the lid askew for the last 30 minutes or more. But for the first go it was great, this will be a regular in my dinner rotation.

My daughter came home from school and said our house smelled like a Mexican restaurant which gave me the idea of making  this fajita style so I heated up some flour tortillas and layered it with rice, since I had already made it, and then topped it with the pork mixture. I used the exact recipe, except I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and cut my cooking time down to five hours on low. Meat was tender and juicy. However, next time I make this, I might add something to give it a little kick.

This was an awesome recipe, so easy and made the best pork chops I've ever had.  So easy and lots of flavor.  We substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce for a little extra flavor.  Yum, yum, yum!!!

My 6 and 3 year old loved it!! So did my hubby and I. I used a sweet onion and sweet peppers... I also slow cooked for 5 1/2 hours. Any longer would have been too long.

This is a family favorite in our house. I don't even thicken the sauce. Great flavor and very tender pork chops! I've used bone in chops but I'm trying the boneless for tonights dinner. I usually double this recipe, but learned the hard way not to double the salt!

Great basic recipe.  With a few tweaks that I made up as I went along, it earned nothing but a bunch of "mmmmmms" from hubby.   I had two 3/4 inch or so bone in chops and 2 bone in pork loin "steaks", also about 3/4" thick.  Browned all in a little oil. Then had a half of a red bell pepper and half of a pablano pepper that needed to be used. Sliced those with the onion and gave them a quick saute in the pan that I used to brown the meat. I just knew that 8 oz of tomato sauce would be nowhere near enough, so I used a 15 oz can and doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients. Put the veggies on top of the meat in the crock pot and poured sauce over. Added fairly generous sprinkling of course ground black pepper over the top.   As other reviewers noted that the pork was dry, I cooked on high for about 2 hours, then on low about another hour.  Set to "keep warm" for about an hour before serving.   I was hesitant about the peppers because we generally do not care for cooked peppers of any type, but these came out fabulously sweet. Next time will use 2 onions and a whole red pepper and whole pablano.  Will probably add a little more vinegar too.  Served hubby's with mashed potatoes and mine with white rice because that's just how we roll!  Really, really good!  Thank you for the recipe.

This is at least the third time I made this recipe. I really dislike cooking,  so I am always thrilled to find an easy and delicious crock pot meal to cook.  Today I used red and yellow peppers because I was out of green. I also added a splash of red wine to the sauce for a bit more liquid. You could add a bit of water if you like more sauce.  Maybe I will try skipping browning the pork next time. That step is my only complaint and I am not sure it makes a huge difference to the end result.

Didn't change a thing in the recipe. The sauce was, surprisingly, saucy. But the pork ended up dry after 5:15, and I cut the chops extra thick. Overall, I found it to be a bit more blah than so many other slow-cooker recipes.  Very simple recipe, though, so I'll find a way to tweak it before discarding it.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I had two large pork chops, so I made the full amount of sauce, cutting back on the brown sugar to about 3 T.  Rather than the green pepper I used a mix of red, orange and yellow peppers.  In my slow cooker, these were done in five hours.  I liked the consistency of the sauce so I opted not to use the cornstarch.   These were quite good and a snap to throw together.

The sauce is fantastic! I would not recommend cooking for over 5 hours unless you start frozen. I cooked it for right at six and I found the porkchops to be too done for me. Following the suggestions of others, I used 1 can of tomato sauce and about a half cup of ketchup to make extra sauce. I used 1 red bell pepper because I don't care for green. Absolutely thicken the sauce to go over rice, it exceeded my expectations! Delicious!

The pork chops were tender and the flavor was wonderful.
With some baked sweet potatoes and a salad we had a complete and very tasty meal!

This was fantastic!  I tweaked with a little Chili Sauce added to the sauce, and some chopped cooked bacon.  I cooked on low for 2 hours then on Med. for 4 hours. (I used my instant pot slow cooker)  I sprinkled pork chops with a little Chili Lime spice after cooking.  My husband LOVED IT! Only bad thing is no left overs...He ate it all!

These are a dinner favorite! The only change is I also add a can of Italian style diced tomatoes -  and add the other ingredients to it - along with the tomato sauce as suggested.  I don't even brown the chops - I just throw it all in a crockpot when I get home and cook on high for 2 1/2 hours - by the time we get home from the gym it is perfect! Sere it over Jasmine rice and enjoy! I have cooked all day on low as well - and it's just as good!

Everyone loved it. Very tasty. I did the same as another reviewer and added a can of diced tomatoes and then doubled all but the peppers and onion.

I had four center cut boneless pork chops that I was looking to cook with a new recipe.  Four hours on low was just enough cook time.  Will try this one again.

I made no changes and will definitely make this again.   Loved the flavor.  I served this over white rice and next time will serve
it over garlic mashed potatoes as another reviewer did.  I  cooked 5 thick boneless chops in my slow cooker for 8 hours and they were very tender and succulent.  The next time I will use only 1 T cornstarch as I found the sauce too thick.

Made this exactly as directed except only cooked for 4 hours and let it sit on warm for about 45 minutes. The pork chops were dry and overdone and the sauce tasted like tomato soup.  Not good. We tossed the leftovers out even though I was hoping to warm up for lunch. Won't be repeating this one.

So good! I used the really thick boneless pork chops from Costco, and only cooked for 5 hours on low. Jazzed it up with a bit of garlic, garlic salt, and a bit of Siracha to add some heat, and a bit of bbq sauce to add to the zing. 
Also two yellow onions and 1/2 a red, a bit of celery, and some sliced apple. Used yellow bell peppers, not green. Served it over Farro, which is a heartier grain than rice. Yummy!

A 'real meal' with a minimum of ingredients. Used thick cut pork chops so they weren't dry but I didn't bother browning first. 6 chops cooked under 6 hours. Served over wild rice.

I used our home made tomato sauce, cut the brown sugar to 1/8, cut the salt to 1 tsp and added 1 tbl spoon of minced garlic and 1 tbl spoon sweet chili sauce. I will make again and cut the cooking time to 5-6 hrs. I will also use my larger slow cooker so that the sauce covers the four chops . These were bone in and  thick as well as large. I also added the chopped onion to the sauce and let it sit for an hour before using to have the spices blend.  The top chops in the cooker were slightly dry.

Absolutely wonderful! I did use ketchup instead of the tomato sauce and the consistency didn't require me to thicken. I did cheat by using frozen red, green, and yellow peppers. This is a definite keeper.

Used thin chops, which are usually tough, but they we're fall-apart tender in this recipe. We thought the sauce could use a flavor boost for our tastes, but this is a great base recipe that will hold up to a variety of alternate seasoning options. I did not care for the peppers in this and would place those in last, on top, in future. Thanks for sharing, I'll make this again!

This is an awesome recipe. I made it over spaghetti noodles so it was kind of a "pork chop cacciotore"...Only difference to the recipe is that I chopped up a tomato and added 8 oz of V8 juice. My family loved it, my 9 year old son wolfed down a big plate and then asked for seconds. It only takes 10 minutes to brown the chops and prepare the sauce and then I put in slow cooker on low for 6 hours. Then 10 minutes to do up the noodles and thats it. Incredibly easy dish but so tasty. My wife said it was good enough to serve to guests. Thanks S Rodriguez for posting the recipe!

My family loves this recipe!  It is now my go to meal when I am taking a meal to a family in need.  I double the sauce, use country style ribs and omit the cornstarch, peppers and added salt.  I also adjust the Worcestershire sauce to taste.  The meat is so tender it is simple delicious and so easy to make!

My family loved, even the husband who is a pizza and hamburger only kind of guy. I did use bone in pork chops since it's cheaper and instead of 2 green bell peppers I used a green and a red. I wouldn't cook it as long as recommended, it was a little dry but it did fall apart and all the meat had came off the bones!!

This was really good.  My family and I really enjoyed this. I did not bothering browning the chops before hand and they were nice, tender and flavorful just the same. I did double the sauce and I'm glad I did because there was plenty to spoon over the rice I served with it. Easy and throw together and quite tasty.

Best Pork Chop I have had and it was really easy. I didn't have tomato sauce or I used whole tomatoes and chopped them up. Turned out great.

Delicious and EASY in my Instant Pot. Used 4lb of picnic ribs, 15 oz can of tomato sauce, about 8 oz of pasta sauce, dried minced garlic  (I admit I was too lazy to mince garlic) and 1/4c brown sugar. Browned pork then dumped  the rest, including onions and peppers, and cooked on Hi for 15" and did a fast release. It was perfect!

This recipe is awesome! However, I did substitute Italian petite diced tomatoes for tomato sauce and because I had no apple cider vinegar, I used De Nigris Glaze with Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. I was also out of corn starch and used 3 tablespoons of plain white lily flour.

My picky eater husband loved it. Easy to make, ingredients are usually on hand. I only made 2 chops so I halved the amounts. Added 4 mushrooms that I wanted to use & a slice of cooked bacon I had in the refrigerator. I didn’t measure the olive oil & used a generous amount to brown the chops which I  also put in the pot. Used sweet peppers I had on hand instead of the green, &I did add the cornstarch. After 5.5 hours it was tended enough to cut with a fork,  not at all dry. Served over white rice with green peas. Delicious. Will
definitely make  it again!

This one is a keeper!  I used 6 chops so we'd have leftovers.  I even heard my SO telling his mother about it on the phone before he came up to warm some up the next day.  And he's a picky eater, so much so that he does much of his own cooking.  So for him to like something I made that well says a lot.  I did use a can of diced tomatoes and a jar of my own home canned chunky tomato sauce, minced garlic and bay leaves as reviewer Caitlin suggested, doubled the other sauce ingredients and served over a packet of Costco's Seven Whole Grains blend.  Delicious! And the leftovers were just as good, if not better.

I followed recipe exactly as written which I always do first time out. I had very thick boneless chops. After 6 hours they were close to being over cooked and were close to falling apart. Sauce was thin so I added the 2 tbsp corn starch which slightly thickened the sauce but sauce was still thin. I served them with mashed potato which was a good choice. I may make this again because it was a quick easy meal but I was not wowed by it. Hubs liked it but then again hubs loves to eat.

This was so tasty and already having sliced peppers and sliced onion in the freezer made this super fast and easy to put together. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so subbed white wine. Next time I will make sure I have the cider vinegar on hand. The gravy thickened up nicely with the corn starch.

I used bone in pork chops and it was falling off the bone but as another reviewer said a bit dry, to me anyway. I had cut the recipe to two servings so maybe I need to play with the cook time.

My DH took one bite and said mmm, mmm, mmm. Second bite and said it was a keeper. Kept saying how good it was throughout the meal. :)

I used 4 large bone-in chops.  I left out the green pepper.   It was in the crock pot 4 1/2 hours on low, which was too long.  The pork was overcooked and dry.  The sauce was delicious on the pork and on mashed potatoes.  I will make it again and only cook it about  3 hours.

This was totally delicious and just slightly sweet.  I substituted V-8 Juice (2 small 5oz low salt cans) as I did not have any tomato juice handy and I used a mix of red, green and yellow bell peppers (Trader Joe's frozen bell pepper trio - I keep em in the freezer for just such occasions).   *I made the side of rice with more V-8 juice and just a little water with a pinch of salt.  It was a great compliment to the sauce.  For sure will be making again, oh yes indeed!

Made the sauce as is, but omitted the peppers (a family member does not eat them). Cooked for 6 hours and no more, per others' comments about pork drying out in slow cooking. Sauce was delicious and 5-star, received compliments. But still a tad dry, hence the 4-star rating. Maybe I will try cooking it for a shorter time in the future.

I made it but left off the brown sugar in an attempt to avoid sugar. It was delicious! However, there was not enough liquid in the crock pot for 6 hours of cooking so I refilled the 8 oz can with water and added to the crock pot. It covered the meat and vegetables and it turned out moist and delicious. Make sure you stir the pork so that there is sauce on the bottom of the crock pot and the pork is not just sitting on the bottom where it will burn.

I believe my old apple cider vinegar & excess of lemon rines tainted my dish, but i acquired a taste for it.  I went overboard trying to give it a spicy kick.  Too many peppers & onions.  I screwed with it too much.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. There are just the two of us, so I used only 4 chops but made the sauce just as written. We liked the extra sauce for the rice. (We had mashed potatoes for the leftover chops and sauce two days later, and that was equally good.) My only changes were that I had a can of chopped tomatoes that I used in place of tomato sauce. I also used red peppers in place of green, as that is what was in my fridge. I did add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Delicious! It might have been even better as leftovers!

Really great recipe, family loved it and they don't normally like crock pot food.  Since crockpot = should be very simple, I did not brown the chops.  I also did not have apple cider vinegar.  Everything else was the same.  Very flavorful.  Do not listen to others saying only cook for 5 hours.  I took a chop out at 5 and it was grossly rubbery.  At 7.5 they fell apart beautifully.  Served with pasta.

I used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce (did not have any) and we found this to be very good and just the right taste of sweetness.

I didn't have tomato sauce, so used a can of diced tomatoes Was a little liquidy, but verry good!  Will put more cornstarch in next time to thicken.

One of my favorite go-to pork chop recipes!! 
I did make a few changes (or add ons) to suit our taste buds. Added a can of diced tomatoes, garlic salt and Italian seasoning. Also, we love spice so I add with a heavy hand some Frank's red hot (or whatever hot sauce we have on hand) and crushed red pepper flakes. 
Super yummy!!!

this was really good. the only change i made was adding garlic. Next time i will add peppers a little later because they were a bit mushy. the flavor was good and pork was super tender!

I adjusted this recipe to my taste, I did not have tomato sauce so I boiled 2 tomato's and peeled them, I used  the magic bullet , only 1 tomato needed,  I added yellow pepper and sliced onions, I did not use cornstarch, I used a slotted spoon to remove  the veggies. I  cooked it covered until the pork chops fell apart, then I took off the cover and cooked another 15 min to thicken it up. It is a great recipe!

Wonderful taste!  Would make it again.  Sauce needed to be thickened either with tomato paste OR flour/cornstarch to make it more like gravy consistency.

My family loved this!!!  I added jalapeño and serrano peppers, garlic and Italian stewed tomatoes.  This made it a little spicy, but not bad.   The tomato sauce that I used was 8 oz. size can.

Oh my goodness this was amazing!!! This dish reminded me of something my Nana use to make for use as kids. She would serve it over broken spaghetti and by chance because I did not have enough rice for 4, I served it with broken spaghetti topped with some grated Parmigiana cheese. I did add some basil, garlic & parsley to the sauce but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. I will definitely be adding this to our menu rotation as it was extremely quick and easy to make plus loaded with flavor.  Thank you for a great recipe and the nostalgia:)

This recipe came out great in the crock pot. I didn't have any apple cider, so I used a whole apple. The chunks softened up and seasoned the sauce nicely. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce and just a little salt to taste.  Have served it over egg noodles and sometimes with mashed potatoes.

Both of us liked this and cleaned our plates.  The pork chops were fork tender.  I will absolutely make this again.  I followed the recipe without any deviation and would recommend that anyone else planning to try this dish do the same.  Tweak if next time if you must.  I don't believe that I will make any changes.  It's good just the way it's posted.  I served mine over rice and my husband chose homemade noodles.  So it's a flexibl dish.  Mashed potatoes would have been a tasty choice as well.

It was my 1st recipe that I made using my newest purchase, my slow cooker.  Although I did not use green peppers as suggested ( I used red b/c I don't care for green) & didn't use cornstarch to thicken the sauce, this was a delightfully delicious recipe.
This will go into my repertoire and I will definitely make again!!

Absolutely yummy.  I didn't have a green bell but fresh jalapenos (not too hot) added wonderful flavor.  Made a mistake by whisking 1 tblsp. corn starch into liquid before adding to crock pot; the sauce turned out beautifully!!

Loved this dish. Made a few changes. I doubled the servings and added  two tablespoons of oregano and  minced garlic with a hint of rum.  Like the other reviews cook it  only 5 hours.

Followed the recipe completely - even my 13 year old son who says everything is "ok" said he really liked it and asked for me to make it again ?? thanks for the recipe! Watch the cook time though... The meat ends up super tender and so yummy.

Really easy and my boyfriend loved it.  Made it with three pork chops in my smaller 3 quart crock pot.  I doubled the sauce recipe so that everything would be covered in sauce so the chops wouldn't dry out and it worked out great.  I used a whole can (15 oz) of tomato sauce, doubled the brown sugar, Worcestershire, vinegar and salt and it was great.  Also added a yellow pepper and used half an onion (although a whole one would have been better, just forgot).  All in all, we both loved it and it's now going on the regular dinner list!  We thought we're gonna try it with white rice and chicken thighs.  We tried with garlic mashed potatoes and it really wasn't a great combo... regardless, we loved it!  Thank you!

Pretty good recipe.  I thought it was a little too sweet with the 1/4 cup brown sugar and the sauce was a little too thick.  It's similar to sweet and sour pork without the breading.  My daughter, however, would certainly give it 4 stars.  I'll make it again, cutting back a bit on the sugar and the cornstarch.

Quick and easy to make and tastes great.  I doubled the sauce in order to have enough for the rice.  will make again soon.
