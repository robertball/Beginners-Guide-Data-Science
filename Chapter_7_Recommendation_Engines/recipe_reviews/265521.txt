My husband really loved this dish with rice. I only added a splash of white wine. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this as a main dish, as my wife is vegetarian. Very, VERY easy to make. I added celery and carrots that I softened in broth so they would be at the same consistency as the zucchini. Then used the broth for my quinoa. It was my wifeâ€™s first quasi-ratatouille and she loved it. Happy wife....

Very good.  I used Italian seasoning because I didn't have any herbs de Provence .  I am saving this recipe in my favorites.  Thanks!

Really a delicious dish. I also add some grated Parmesan to give it more intense flavor.
