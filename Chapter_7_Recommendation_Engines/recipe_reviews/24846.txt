**5 star potential** if the following changes are made (IMHO). I soaked the pinto beans overnight, then drain well. In a large pot, I added 4 lb. pork butt, 7 cups water, 1 chopped onion, 3 garlic cloves minced, 2 heaping tablespoons chili powder, 3 heaping teaspoons ground cumin, 1 heaping tablespoon SMOKED PAPRIKA (that's the secret ingredient), 1 tablespoon coarse sea salt, 1 teaspoon dried oregano & one 4 oz. can chopped green chilies. Bring it to a boil; reduce heat & simmer covered for 3 hours. Remove pork & cool enough to handle. Shred meat with fork. Return meat to pot & cook uncovered until thick, about 30 minutes. Serve it over corn chips with shredded lettuce, minced green onions, salsa, shredded monterey jack & sharp cheddar cheeses, & avocado cubes. Beautiful! The entire family loves it.

I found this in the Allrecipes Cookbook and read all the reviews online before making it. I did the following: soaked my beans overnight, added 3 TBS chili powder, 2 TBS ground cumin, several shakes of Adobo seasoning, 5 cloves garlic, 2 cans of diced green chiles and fresh ground pepper, along with my appx. 4# pork loin roast.  I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes with my 1 quart water.  Cooked on low for most of the day, shredded my pork loin roast (it mostly just fell apart) then added it back to simmer until dinner. My 10 year old could not stop eating it!! My bean-hating 8 year old even loved it! Very tastey - a cross between a mexican shredded pork dish and chile.  Will definitely make this again - it makes a LOT!! Great for a crowd!! I set out a myriad of accompianments to choose from - brown rice, white and wheat tortillas, tortilla chips, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese, sour cream and guacomole - everyone did theirs a little bit different!!! Thanks for a great new pork (and crock pot) recipe!!!

Delicious recipe!  I used a 2-1/4 pound boneless pork roast, 1 29 ounce can pinto beans instead of dried (I may use 2 cans next time), 2 cans chopped chile peppers, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1+ teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano, 2 Tablespoons minced garlic, 1 16 ounce Mexican tomatoes, 1 8 ounce can tomato sauce & 1 large onion choppped.  I omitted the water & cooked all day in the crock pot, shredding the meat after a few hours.  We ate this delicious dish in bowls like chili with shredded cheese & sour cream on the side to add on top.

I have been making this for over 20 years.  It is much more interesting, and tasty, if you offer the following to sprinkle on top of the chips and Chalupa (in a bowl):  Shredded lettuce, diced tomato, chopped onion, sliced ripe olives, guacamole and shredded cheese.  Topped with salsa it's delicious.

I gave it stars, though this is after my own changes... The beans didn't cook for me in the slow cooker the first time even after 9 hours.  Next time, I soaked the beans overnight first, then cooked for 8 hours on high in the slow cooker with the pork, and I added a lot more of the spices, plus garlic, and 2 cans of Mexican style stewed tomatoes.  Over corn chips with all the toppings was good, but it's also a great basic mexican filling for burritos, tacos, anything.

Great recipe for a crowd.  I used chicken breasts, chicken broth instead of water, added jalepenos, canned Mexican style tomatoes, cilantro and garlic.  It was yummy and everyone wanted the recipe.

I also followed others suggestions. I added two cans of green chiles, garlic, and used tortillas instead of corn chips. But I used venison instead of pork. It was delicious. My husband was a little leery at first, but really loved it. I also used powdered cumin instead of seed. I will make this again. It does make enough for an army so have lots of friends over.

The whole family really liked this.  I was in a "rush" so I used canned pinto beans and I cut the pork up before putting it in the crock pot.  I also cooked it on high to speed things along.  I added about 1/4 cup chopped onions and a teaspoon or so of garlic powder.  I have two young children so I didn't add extra spices as some have suggested.  Both kids really liked dinner tonight.  I served the meat in home made fry bread with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, cheese, sour cream and onions.  It was fantastic. A keeper for sure!

Pretty good, but it really needs some more seasoning.  I would add more chili powder, garlic, and probably a can of mexican tomatoes, and maybe even another can of chile peppers.  I don't like too much "kick", but it just needed a bit more.  You might want to add some extra water, because mine was on the drier side.  All in all, a good recipe!

I thought this recipe was OK.  It is easy to make, and makes a lot so you can stick some in the freezer.  Plus, it's very adaptable, can be added to tacos, burritos, etc...  But I thought the flavor was just average.

I love this recipe.  My Mom's been making it for years.  We ate it over a tortilla that had been crisped on a skillet with cheese melted on it.  NUM!

I loved this recipe. I used tortillas instead of the chips. Next time I plan on adding some Spanish rice and guacamole to the tortilla. I too included garlic and I sliced up half an onion into large piece so I could remove after cooking. Beans and I do not get along so I used canned pinto beans the last 20 minutes.

This was not spicy enough for us.  I ended up adding a lot more seasoning and a lot more chili peppers.

This was ok.  I think for us it was one of those recipes that is nice once but you probably wouldn't make again, I liked it much better than my hubby but he's terribly picky.
I think this recipe is really good-just not to make over and over for our family.

I liked this! The only thing missing was a little more spice. Next time, I'm going to double the green chili. I went ahead and fried my own chips and that made this super tasty. Thanks for the recipe! Even my picky roommate ate it.

As a base recipe, we liked this.  Since it made so much, we had enough left over to eat 2 more dinners, and liked the flavor better after the first day.  We used it as a burrito filling, rather than eating it over chips, but to do that, you have to drain the juice off the spoon pretty well.  I asked my husband to heat some corn to serve with this, and he thought I meant to dump it in.  It was good that way, and gave us the idea that adding hominy would be good, too.  When we make this again, we will be adding some Hatch green chile (we like things a little spicier), and maybe some onion and garlic.  We might soak the beans overnight first, too, as ours turned out a little more al dente than we like (and it helps eliminate some of the gas-producing effects...).  My 16-year old liked it well enough to ask for the recipe so he could make it for his grandpa when he visits next summer!

Very delicious.  I didn't do the chips.  I put into flour tortillas and rolled them up and had all the fixings to go along with them.

SOOOOOOOO 5 stars with the suggestions from "I'm Not Stupid, I Know Tings".  I used canned beans- about 6 cups of water, and cooked this in the crock pot.  It was AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow!  Btw, the chili powder I used was from New Mexico- chamayotogo.com- do yourself a favor and get the real thing!

This version gets 3 stars.  Using the complete advise of the reviewer "I'm not stupid I know things" it receives 5 stars (thanks for the advise!)  My family likes a lot of flavor in their food and the additions to the original recipe make all the difference.

We thought this was pretty good, though not as spicy as I would have preferred.  I used half pinto beans and half black beans, which worked well.  It was very easy, and I will definitely make again.  I will probably season a little more heavily and might serve wrapped in tortillas instead of on chips.  Thanks!

I really wish I could give this meal 5 stars - the pork and bean mixture worked out really great for me, tender pork and well-cooked beans I use in bowls with rice and in burritos. But the "southwest" flavor is pretty non-existant. It really does not taste like anything but pork and beans, which is great but a lot of tweaking would be needed for this to have any kind of southwestern flavor. I know I'll be making this again and again (with flavor adjustments) so thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe was okay.  The meat is very very tender, but it just needs more seasoning!  I don't like spicy things at all, but this was incredibly bland!  I even added 2 chopped onions and garlic--but I think I would have doubled or tripled the spices.  Next time I may try it without the beans because maybe they diluted the seasonings--a good base to work from, but definitely needs some improvement!

This was OK, pretty difficult to eat on chips, we finally gave up and tried tortillas. I doubled the spices and it was still bland.

VERY delicious!!  I would add a bit more spices than called for, but still very good.  It made a ton that was wonderful for leftovers!

Good basic recipe, however, I added a ton more seasonings and some spicey roasted red pepper salsa to the meat mixture. The corn chip part didn't tempt me, so I fried flour tortillas in oil for about thirty seconds on each side, drained them on paper towels and then popped them into the oven to really crisp up. Delicious!

Easy & great for quick company meal.  I also tried it using 1 pound of cooked hot pork sausage instead of chicken and it was super.

Skip the corn chips.  Just go straight to the store and by some tortilla shells to ensure enjoyment of every morsel.

I added a few cloves of garlic and a can of tomato sauce and it was much tastier. Can be served in tortillas or on rice also.

I’ve been making a version of this for years and while this one is good I like it with modifications better.   I skip the green chilies and add 4-6 chopped jalapeños along with the juice from the jar.  I also use more beans and instead of just pintos I use pintos and small reds.   That gives the final product a little more body as the small reds don’t turn to mush when reheated.   Third, I add a couple of large onions chopped to the mix.

My family LOVED this! Instead of cumin seeds I used ground cumin, no oregano, no corn chips & made it into wet burritos.  I put into tortilla, covered with shredded cheese. Then placed them in a lined 9x13 pan. Covered & placed on middle rack @ 350 degrees for 20 min. Just long enough to melt cheese. Served with Spanish rice.

I made the mistake of soaking the beans overnight and did not reduce the amount of water and this came out soupy. After 4 hrs on low the roast was nowhere near tender enough to shred. I had to cook it 4 more hrs on high before I could shred the roast. While this smelled good while cooking it tasted bland. It needs something but I'm not sure what.

I made adjustments according to my family's tastes.  I used Cumin instead of Cumin seed and I added 1 large finely chopped onion and 3 minced garlic cloves.  I also increased the chopped green chilies to 2 cans and the chili powder to 3 Tablespoons.  I omitted the salt altogether.  
After it's prepared abd ready to serve on a bed of corn chips, top with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, diced green onions, diced tomatoes and fresh diced avocado.
This meal is one of my family's favorite meals and a request for special occasions.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

This was just...nasty.  Sorry, that's the nicest thing I could say about it. I ended up making us lunchmeat sandwiche.  And I apologized to my family.

I thought this was very good! I used a 2 lb pork loin and 2 cans pinto beans with liquid and 1 1/2c water. Cooked on high all day and the beans held up great! Thanks for sharing.
