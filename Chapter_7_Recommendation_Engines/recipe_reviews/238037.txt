The mango relish adds such a freshness to this dish. I couldn't find the red bell pepper and ancho chili pepper jam, so I used red pepper jelly and then rehydrated an ancho chili and added some of it to the relish. It added a nice kick!  The cooking time and method for the salmon was spot on. Just flip, remove from the heat and let it do it's thing. Delicious!

I used a homemade habanero pepper jelly because that's what I had and dusted the salmon with a bit of jerk seasoning.  So fresh and simple.

This is delicious and very simple to prepare.  My kind of dish!  I made it actually as written and was happy with the fish and with the mango topping.  This recipe will be on our dinner table again.

Excellent.  I did not have the red bell pepper and ancho chili pepper jam, so I use the jalapeno jelly that we had on hand.  I also added a little diced red onion.  I loved the mango.  What a great taste.  Delicious.

I used peach jam and a pinch of cayenne and chili powder as a handy substitute for the chili pepper jam.

Made it to the recipe except I couldn't find the Ancho pepper jelly so I had to use just a red pepper jelly.  It was really good on the Salmon.

I couldn’t find the jam in the receipt, so I improvised and used strawberry jam and mixed it with cayenne pepper, Lemmon, honey and mango. It tasted great. Great receipt, thanks for sharing chef John. ???

This salsa was a big hit at my family gathering.  And served over the fresh caught salmon was wonderful, though I noticed a lot of people just eating the salsa with chips! it was a good thing I tripled the recipe!  No leftovers!

My wife and I  both agreed.... this was the BEST RECIPE I'VE EVER COOKED.   Getting a fresh ripe mango was key.  Getting salmon that was fresh and tender was key.  I found farm-raised was juicier in this case than wild-caught alaskan (go figure?).  A must-try recipe!  The flavors melded so well.  Thank you once again, Chef John!

Like others, we were creative with our peppers.  We used half a red bell pepper, half a poblano pepper and a generous tablespoon full of the  Habanero Pepper Jelly (by Lunasea here on allrecipes).  Was wonderful on the salmon.   I later paired the leftover salsa with Trader Joe's Curried Kale & Cauliflower salad for lunch.  Yum!

This turned out great.  I had a larger piece of salmon so I cooked for 4-5 min before flipping the salmon and then another 4-5 in the skillet off the heat.  I couldn’t find the suggested jam so I used Strawberry Balsamic Serrano Jam.  This was so easy to make; I’ll make this again.

This recipe is a keeper. I seasoned the salmon to taste using what I had on hand and felt a taste for. The mango salsa is delicious! What a great combo.

The only pepper jelly I found at the store was Jamaican Habanero so I went with that. Also chopped and added 1 small red bell pepper for colour and extra flavour. It was delicious on the salmon. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious and easy.  I had a thick piece of salmon so cooked it for 4 minutes and then flipped, covered and left it off the heat for about 5.  It was perfect.

This came out pretty good. The salmon was delicious. But I had trouble dicing and peeling my mango, probably since it was going bad. So instead of diced chunks, I had like mango mush like it was defrosted in the fridge. I skipped the ancho jam and added red pepper. I didn't have any cilantro and skipped it too. But it came out pretty good.  I would make it again.

A quick way to make delicious salmon. If you are really rushed for time you can substitute jar mango salsa. A nice summer meal.

This is a very tasty relish for salmon.  We used Tobasco jelly instead of ancho, as soon as we can find some, we will try that.

This recipe didn’t quite work for me. The salmon was very tasty, but took longer to cook. Maybe my fillets were thicker? Additionally, my mango wasn’t very flavorful, and didn’t blend well with the pepper jelly and lime juice. It was mango lumps with puddles of liquid. But the salmon, once done was very good, and I improved my salmon-skinning skills by watching Chef John’s video!

Fantastic recipe.   I made as is except for substituting green Paprika (bell Peppers) instead of red.   I chopped a small bird eye pepper deseeded and added to mango salsa.  This recipe can be highly recommended.

Sooo yummy!  A must!  Such a perfect spring/ summer dish.  I used pineapple jalapeño jelly, as I couldn’t find the ancho chili pepper jelly.

Arguably the tastiest thing I've ever made, although I'm pretty new to cooking. The mango and salmon flavors pair fantastically, and I really appreciated the simplicty of the preparation. I had but one problem, and I'm probably just bad at this, or I was supposed to butterfly it or something, but 2-3 minutes to a side did absolutely nothing to cook my salmon through. Ended up shoving the skillet in the oven for about 15 minutes to get it cooked perfectly. 10/10 would make again.

Served over a nice crunchy slaw - such a great combo of flavors & textures! I’ve made this several times now, and always make extra for lunch the next day - I just flake the cold salmon into a refreshed slaw (I just throw the leftover slaw over more fresh cabbage/any other shredded veggies on hand), and add the mango salsa like a dressing. I’ll keep making this one again & again! Plus, this is a stink-free way to bring leftover salmon into a break-room - no microwaving required!

This was absolutely the best! Not a big fan of salmon so this fab side was perfect. My husband, ever the skeptic loved it also.

Great recipe! I’m very satisfied with how it turned out. Here is what I changed. I marinated the salmon in teriyaki sauce. I did not have the Chile jelly stuff for the salsa so I diced around a half jalapeño instead. I doubled the lime, cilantro, onion (red onion used) and red bell pepper. My husband loved it and so did I. It’s going on our rotation for sure!

Substituted the jelly for jalapeño jelly since I couldn’t find red bell pepper and ancho chile jelly at the store. Salmon came out OK, but the mango slaw is amazing! Paired with a side salad and a glass of wine.

Yep; two thumbs up. Filets had a beautiful crust, moist centers. I had thick cuts, so the saute time was a little longer. A nice thing about salmon is that you can watch the sides for doneness. NOTE: Make sure you know your couscous. This recipe calls for quick couscous, so prepare what you have to the correct directions. A little extra time may be required. And add a little extra salt to the boiling water. This one is a keeper. Delicious.

I made this.  I thought it really lacked any pizazz. Yes Mango is good with the fish, but it still tasted just like Mango. Also it was not like a salsa, actually kind of brown and runny.

It was delicious.  HOWEVER.... The recipe puts the bell peppers on the same lin as the pepper jelly.  I had to go to the store for the jelly and hardly anyone carries it.  # different stores!  Finally found it.  Like I said, it was delicious.  I even made it again and substituted Tilapia for the Salmon (OK, so I am cheap). It was excellent also.

I will definitely make this again.  I couldn't find the ancho chili jam so I used red pepper jelly and added some chipotle chili powder.  I also added some chopped red onion.

This dish was absolutely delicious. I added diced pineapples, red onions, red bell peppers and corn. I could not find the red pepper ancho jam, so I simply hydrated the Ancho chili seasoning I bought at the store. This was a hit on my family table.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I can't get hold of the Earth and Vine red pepper and ancho chili jam, so I used red pepper jelly and added dried jalapeno to it and cooked it down to more jam-like consistency.  Turned out great!

I've been making something similar to this for years.  I usually add pineapple and diced oranges with a bit of honey and scallions.  If you do use fresh pineapple, please do not store the leftover salmon with the salsa.  The pineapple will turn the fish mushy.
