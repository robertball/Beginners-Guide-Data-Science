HUGE THANK YOU EVIN for satisfying my sweet tooth. This was a perfect recipe and the ease was almost scary. So simple that I could probably make it every night. When I asked you for a description you said..."Imagine a blond brownie and an apple pie... they meet on a moonlit night in paris... they share a bottle of wine...They're chewy bar... like a butterscotch brownie kinda..." no truer words were ever written. The one addition I made was adding a 1/2 bag of Heath toffee chips to the batter. Just outstanding and rest assured, I'll be making these again.

This is my recipe and I made it 2 nights ago and was short an egg - so I just used 1 and I liked it even better than the original version. If you like your brownies fudgy (like we do) then 1 egg is the way to go. It makes the batter stiff so I thinned it with a little milk.

Made this soon as it posted!  Couldn't wait to try my new skillet!  Very easy recipe and super tasty.  Omitted the clove as family is not much for gingerbread flavor.  Recipe has plenty of spice without.  Used walnuts as had on hand.  Served with homemade vanilla ice cream.  Will use often.  Great way to use up 3-4 apples that need eating up! ( EDIT: I have made this several times now and cut the spices in half.  Much better and not so overpowering.  I also have added dried cranberries on occasion - delicious!)

I doubled this recipe because my cast iron skillet is GINORMOUS. I might not do that next time, only because I'm an impatient baker. (It's not a reflection of the recipe. If you want to double it, go nuts.) I only made two minor changes. I eliminated the pecans because I didn't have any and I just threw butter into the cast iron skillet, not really measuring. Other that a doubled recipe, those were the only changes. This did take an hour-twenty minutes to bake and I did have to cover it halfway through with foil. For a novice cast iron skillet user, this was cake for me and it used all pantry ingredients I had on hand. It turned out beautifully and the smell during baking was almost like.....apple-bready-custard. Thanks, Ev! NOTE: Don't double the recipe. HUGE mistake on my part. Just do a single recipe. You'll thank me.

I made this as is, but I agree that something was missing. I loved the taste with icecream, but I think that there was too much of the spices. Each one needed to be cut down a bit so the apple flavour could show through better.

Love love love this! I didn't change a thing except cook it in something else because I don't have a cast iron skillet. It took an extra 10 min. in the oven for me. You're right the 2 eggs make it cake like which is delicious. I might try the one egg next time but we loved it so much I am not sure I want to mess with it!

I enjoyed this - unfortunately I was using fresh-grated nutmeg for the first time and totally underestimated how strong it would be.  I did not add cloves and used wheat flour instead of white.  I loved the texture and the apples in this.  Next time I will cut the sugar back to 3/4 c and maybe use 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

We thought this was great. I reduced the cloves because I knew it was too much for us! My batter was pretty dry, quite hard to scoop, so I think in the future I'd add a bit of milk to thin it out somewhat. The finished product tastes great! Thanks for the recipe :-)

Loved, loved, loved this.  I like that you find some areas that are a little crispy.  Wonderful warm with a bit of vanilla ice cream.  Will for sure make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make and it has that old fashioned down home comfort food feeling.  My husband said this was one of the best deserts he has had.  I did add a bit of allspice to the recipe but not enough to detract from the original.  Yummy!  Enjoy!

This was delicious!!  The only change I made was to leave out the cloves, NOT a fan.  I never would have thought of making something like this, and especially not in my cast iron skillet! I love how the outside cooks from the butter / hot skillet.  The only thing I might change next time would be to add a touch more salt.  I used unsalted butter (I do in all my baking) and I think 1/4 tsp wasn't quite enough salt.  Great recipe!

This is exactly as described....warm, chewy apple dessert. I was looking for something different to make, instead of pies, crisps, etc with apples. I made it exactly like the recipe calls for except I doubled the recipe, it turned out wonderful. My daughter is who pretty picky about spice, even loved it. I will make this many more times! Thanks for a great recipe Evin!

These were pretty good.  I made them exactly as written except that I don't have a cast iron skillet so I just used an 8x8 baking dish.

After resurrecting a 100+ years old cast iron skillet originally belonging to my husband's grandmother, I made this delicious, delightful dessert last night.  What a treat!  The only change I made was substituting 1 tablespoon of apple pie spice for the cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves.  Fast, easy and inexpensive, my family was in love!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I decided to make a few changes after reading reviews. I followed recipe except I only use 1/4 teaspoon of apple pie spice and use 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon. I added about 1 1/2 -2 tablespoons of butter to iron skillet. My family doesn't like nuts in food so i left out. I edges were nice a crispy with buttery flavor...much like a "blonde"  the center was soft like a brownie. They are over 1/2 of my cast iron skillet that night. 

Ill make again. Im thinking of adding a caramel drizzle next time and serve with a nice vanilla bean ice cream.. Like,
Applebees apple pie. Family, is asking for this again tonight!   I tried adding photos but, the site kept saying...this isnt a image.. Ill try again later..thus its a keeper!!!

Received my allrecipes magazine and found this recipe.  It is worth every one of the 5 stars.  As I reviewed the recipe, I really didn't think it would fit in my 8 inch iron skillet but it does fit perfectly.  I used less than 1/4 teaspoon of the cloves as I don't care for cloves.  When it came out, I could taste the cloves but it still was delicious.  This morning, I decided to try some as a coffee cake.  Oh my, other reviewers were absolutely correct.  The cloves blends in and isn't so strong the next day.  This is great at dinner with ice cream while it is still warm but it is also wonderful the next morning as a coffee cake.  I like things I can do the evening before and still have it be special the next morning (not a morning person).  Next is to try to make it so that I can serve it to my diabetes friends and family.

I had to make this in a casserole dish.  It was very good warm with a scoop of ice cream and carmel sauce, it was good by itself too. Although it was not excellent.  I would rename this "Apple Coffee Cake" because it was not at all like a brownie and had a similiar flavor to most coffee cakes.

My 9 year old grandaughter said she didn't like this dessert, she LOVED it and the rest of us agree. It isn't overly sweet and nice and moist. I did serve it with vanilla ice cream and drizzled a little caramel sauce over it, but we all agreed the cake really didn't need it as it was excellent on it's own.  Thanks Momzilla for the recipe. I will make this many times.

Absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have cloves so I used allspice instead.  I also didn't have any nuts on hand, but this recipe was amazing without them. Great job and thanks for sharing!

I used a gluten free flour mix, with a pinch of xanthan gum, and only 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. I am the only one that loves cloves. Everybody loved them. My husband had it for breakfast.

Very good! I omitted the nuts and regretted it, but my stepson does not like nuts. So next time I'm making it with raisins and nuts! I like the chewy edges, so maybe I'll make it with just one egg, not two. This is a very sweet experiment. I cut the nutmeg in half and used no cloves since my family does not like gingerbread. The cinnamon was just the right amount. This is great for breakfast coffee cake if you cut the sugar down a little. Will definitely make again and again in many different variations. Thanks!

I followed the aside of others and only added 1 egg. I also omitted the nuts because my daughter is allergic. I did not add the clove or nutmeg, just the cinnamon. The texture was like a chewy and fudgy brownie. Easy and delicious! It is a keeper!

Very good, with a minimum of work.  I halved the spices (except salt), as recommended by most reviewers.  All enjoyed this, including fussy kids.

I made this today after reading the reviews.  My husband loved it and said "be sure to save this recipe!" I followed the directions exactly as written and it was very good.  I didn't have any ice cream in the house, so I used whipped cream.  The only change I will make the next time I make this is to use slightly less cloves; otherwise, I won't change anything!  And I WILL be making this again!

Delicious, will definitely make again! I used half white flour and half whole wheat, whatever nuts I had on hand (a mix of almonds, pecans, and sunflower seeds), and I added raisins. I also diced too many apples, nearly 4 cups, and ended up using them all. I thought the cake would not hold together as a result, but it was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this last night after seeing it in a recent Allrecipes magazine.  Very easy and the flavors are great.  Not overpowering at all.  I made it in a larger than suggested 10 inch copper chef pan and it was still moist and gooey.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make with ingredients that I usually have on hand. 
I added a smidge more apple (3 large, which was about 2.5 cups), and had chopped walnuts so used those instead of pecans. Didn't have cloves. Extra star for not being super sweet, but sweet enough to be satisfying. Family loved it!

I don't submit reviews very often because I tend to change recipes a lot when I cook.  This time, my changes were fairly minor.  I was about 1/4 cup short on apples (Granny Smith), so I added that much applesauce and reduced the melted butter to 1/4 cup.  Shaves off a few calories and fat grams while ensuring full the full amount of apples.  Yum!  This is a terrific recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I will probably make it again, substituting a gluten free flour blend and an egg substitute due to loved ones with food restrictions.

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe though I am giving it a four star rating because everyone else seemed to like it.  I reduced the cloves by half but they still seemed to overwhelm the taste of the dessert.

Although the recipe itself sounds really good, I am on the Keto diet and though why not try to make it a bit more friendly.  I subbed the 1 cup flour for 1.75 cups almond flour and changed the sugar to all sweeteners.  Also reduced the cloves by half after reading the  reviews.  It turned out really moist and flavorful.  Served it with Keto Ice Cream.  Hubby didn't know the difference!!  LOL

When I made this, I used 2.5 cups of frozen Haralson apples from our trees.  I used 1 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and omitted the ground cloves since I do not care for them.  I also used a gluten free all purpose flour as I recently found out I am gluten sensitive.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans since I had them on hand.   I also used the Truvia for baking white and brown sugar.  Finally, I baked this in my 8" cast iron skillet.  I baked it in the morning and served it to my aunt and cousin in the afternoon.  They enjoyed it.  I liked it as well and thought the texture was quite dense, which could be because of the flour.  I was pleased with the flavor and did not think it was too sweet.  I would make it again.

Finally something new and easy to do with all the apples from our trees. Wouldn't quite call it a brownie more like a fresh apple skillet cake.  This was extremely easy to make. Flavor was wonderful-I used 2 different apple varieties, was moist from the apples. Served with a little vanilla bean ice cream. Great fall/winter dessert. Also thinking a great camping dessert with the cast iron pan.

So simple. You could serve it any time of year and would be great to take to an event. It came out as pretty as a picture. I may try a light frosting drizzle or Carmel drizzle some time to change it up. This is a keeper! 
This is the best website on the internet for recipes! My “go to” for some new, different, easy and tastes amazing recipes.

I increased the cinnamon and reduced the nutmeg and cloves.  I also made one for a neighbor and left out the nuts as they are not allowed to eat nuts due to stomach problems. They liked very much.   It was a hit.  It is similar in taste to a fresh apple bread my grandmother used to make.

This was wonderful!  My daughter's calling it "That yummy apple thingy" and requesting it for the second time this week!  

I just made it gluten-free (by using brown rice flour) and omitted the cloves and nutmeg (as I can't have) and it turned out great!  The full amount of cinnamon was perfect and the glassware I used worked beautifully.  Thanks!

I doubled this because my skillet is about 12". I would like the recipe to have specified what kind of apple. I used gala as that is what I had on hand. Next time I would use a more tart apple. I used Gluten Free flour from King Arthur and a little extra of all the spices. I baked it about an extra 10 min, I would not call it chewy like a brownie but that could be my fault using different flour and/or baking it too long. This cake would be great with a homemade carmel sauce on it.

I did make this in my cast-iron skillet, and the melted butter made a nice crust.  I took the advice of the originator and only used 1 egg, which worked well.  I served it warm, right out of the skillet.  Fun!

This is delicious.  I love it because it uses simple ingredients I usually have on hand.  It is so good warm, with cool whip or vanilla ice cream. I usually use 3 cups of chopped apples and it turn out great.

Overfilled a 2 cup measure with chopped apples, all dark brown sugar, plus a couple of tablespoons of Boiled Cider, (a highly apple cidered syrup).  Was wonderful.  Soft and chewy and very tasty!  Yum!  Will make again!

This is awesome I switched up a little, did not have pecans on  hand so I did not add any nuts at all but added 1/2 cup more apples, I used 1/3 cup of grapeseed oil instead of butter, only one egg + sour cream,  to thin the batter a little,almost everything was substituted and yet everyone loved it, so addicting! Very good.

This bread/brownie was really yummy!  I could not cook it in a skillet so I cooked it in the oven in a glass pan and made sure I buttered the pan well.  I used the same amount of cinnamon and the only thing I changed was that I cut the cloves and nutmeg down to about 1/4 teaspoon for both.  I will definitely make this again!

This is the perfect recipe. I usually make as directions indicate, however, I made radical changes to accommodate a family member with allergies. I used gluten free flour, duck eggs, dry figs and almonds. The result was delicious. In all recipes I found that 1/3 cup of white and brown sugar is sufficient. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe.

We liked this a lot, I have a 12'' cast iron skillet, so I doubled the recipe, served warm with ice cream and it turned out great  Although I thought it had just a bit too much nutmeg for my taste, I will definitely be making  this again, maybe using apple pie spice next time

Very good. I didn’t have the right size cast iron skillet so used a 9” sq pan and sprayed with cooking spray.   I found it to be a little sweet so I’ll cut the sugar a little next time

This Skillet Apple Brownie is absolutely delicious and very easy to make. The only thing I was without was the pecans so I substituted with a few walnuts I had around the house.
But the next time I make it, which is very soon, I will include the pecans.
I recommend to anyone that's looking for an easy to make and a delicious dessert.

I made this just as written, with the exception of slightly lowering the amount of cloves and barely adjusting the cinnamon. It was delicious!
Next time I will try to make a light, more heart friendly version however. 
Thanks for a delicious idea!

After reading other reviews, I decided to add less nutmeg and cloves than what the recipe called for. I used half of the suggested amount of cloves and a little less nutmeg. I am not sure if I would use cloves again, or maybe a quarter of what the recipe called for.  The vanilla ice cream was a good addition.  I would definitely make this again and my family enjoyed it.

This  brownie is amazing. I had never heard of apple brownies before so I gave this a try using a glass pan instead of an iron skillet and it turned out beautifully. This is so yummy that I made one for my in-laws. It took a bit longer to bake than the recipe calls for.

Very good, SUPER quick and easy!  A little too sweet even tho I reduced the white sugar a bit.  I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts. (worked just as well.) I didn't have any ice cream, and it really needed it! But my family loved it and I'll make it again the next time I have apples that need to get used up.

I made this recipe in individual cast iron pans and it worked out very well.  Top with a little vanilla ice cream and it makes a wonderful presentation.

I love this cake, bar,  brownie!!  I used organic sugar and only about 1/3C and the brown sugar.  Walnuts would work also.  It is so good warm with whipped cream.  I will make again.

I will use whole wheat flour, skip the cloves, and cut the other spices in half.  I will make it in the dutch oven I have (not cast iron).

I followed directions completely, only I added 1/2 the cinnamon allotted as that’s all I had. I also omitted nutmeg as I didn’t have that either. It was extremely delicious and everyone raved about it!

I put the apples, vanilla extract, and melted butter in my blender and blended into a mush.  No big chunks but lots of delicious flavor!!!

Ok. I guess my skillet was too big? (12”) Kind of flat and not much cookie/brownie to it. It did taste good but I’d recommend using a smallish skillet or double up the recipe.

Thank You very much for this yummieness. This is so easy and so good. A great way to use the last few apples. Did not have pecans so I used almonds and I added 1/2 chopped dried cranberries.

I did not make any changes. Followed the recipe. It is so good.
Incredible. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Optional---drizzle very lightly with caramel , but it is fine without it.
Yummy yummy yummy. Best dessert I've had in ages.

Wayyyy too much nutmeg, which overpowered the dessert.  I already cut the cloves to 1/8tsp because I know it does the same.  I will probably do 1/8tsp nutmeg next time as well if I ever give it a try again.

I made this for our office Thanksgiving Potluck. I reduced the apples by a 1/2 cup and added cranberries for the theme and baked them in a cast iron muffin pan. Absolutely fantastic is all I heard anyone say. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was delicious! I think the trick is cooking it in the cast iron pan. It created a slightly crisp, caramel-y bottom and a moist delicious center.

Quick and easy, and very yummy. I only made 2 changes - reduced the amount of both brown and white sugar by maybe a quarter of the recipe amount, and used homemade (white) lavender sugar I had received as a gift. It was plenty sweet even reduced. I don't have a cast iron skillet, like many of the reviewers, so used a 9x9 dish. Worked perfectly.

Great, moist cake.  I followed the advice of others & cut the spices in half and I also decreased the white & brown sugars by half.  I found it was still sweet enough & the spices weren't overpowering.  I will make this again...great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Very, very good.  I reduced each spice by about half and it was delicious.  Best to eat fresh out of the oven with a dollop of ice cream. Becomes a bit soggy by the next day.

This is absolutely fantastic!  What could be better than an apple dessert that has the texture of a brownie.  I had my doubts when making it because the batter is so thick, but it baked up into a moist and delicious dessert.  One taste wasn't nearly enough and I found myself going back again and again for "just one more bite".  I plan on using this as a staple for my holiday dessert table.  Of course I'll probably dress it up with a splash of brandy and sweetened whipped cream so it looks festive.

New family favorite. I only had cinnamon on hand so used 1TSP and due to cost and lack of really needing, we will drop the pecans. I think I didn't dive the apples small enough but wow,  great recipe! Will make sure to have at least some nutmeg on hand next time.

I made the recipe exactly as written and we loved it, especially the crusty edge.  We topped it with caramel topping which was perfect.  I will make this again!

Chewy with a little crunch.  I omitted the cinnamon etc. And let the apples and pecans speak for themselves.  This is a very easy, very good dessert.

This is the perfect apple dessert to serve with ice cream and I love using my iron skillet to bake and serve it. I give it 5 stars for the easy instructions. My personal taste is to leave out the cloves because I'm not a fan of cloves, but I will keep and use this recipe forever.

This is a rustic chewy easy to make yummy fall apple dessert.  I used whole wheat flour which gave it even more texture.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and cloves and it was perfect.  I used 2 large Honeycrisp apple and did not peel them.  My husband raved and I will make it again.

This recipe sounded easy and delicious, and I had apples on hand that I needed to use.  I made it in my square cast iron skillet, and the only change I made was just using a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg.  This is one awesome recipe and is now a family favorite.  Thanks so much for sharing this, Evin!

I made this recipe, adjusting it only in cutting the butter in half and substituting unsweetened applesauce for the rest of the butter. The "brownies" turned out very spicy!! The next day the flavor mellowed out, and it was SO good. This is definitely on my make-again list!

I have made this many times since the first time I tried it. It is my go to for breakfast treats, winter desserts, and special events. The first time I tried it I unknowingly used self rising flour. It turned into a delightful cake. You just can’t mess this up!??

Very good. I left out the cloves because I didn't have any. The next time I make it I think I'm going to sprinkle extra pecans on top.

This is a great recipe! Much better than apple pie. Crispy edges taste divine! Seasonings are perfect! Used 1 jumbo egg and 3 cups chopped apples resulting in a fabulous birthday dessert for my husband. Baked this in a #6 Griswold skillet. Highly recommended this recipe!

I make this in a 5 qt. Lodge cast iron Dutch Oven and it comes out perfect,  just follow the recipe.   Served it to company for dessert and now printing the recipe for them to take home.   A winner!

Made with Golden Delicious apples, spices cut back by half, served with fresh whipped cream. This has become one of my "go to" recipes for a simple yet very tasty apple desert.

Too sweet....used 1/2 c Xyla and 1/2 c palm sugar.
Used 1/2 the spices and felt still too much cloves.  Made with 1/2 c whole wheat c & p flour and 1/2 c THM baking blend.

Doubled the recipe (except only used 3 eggs), made in a heavy nonstick 9 X 13 pan, substituted dates for nuts because I had some drying up in the fridge. Left peel on the apples and rough chopped in food processor with dates. Took about 45 minutes to bake. I love apple desserts, and this one is a keeper.

Excellent apple dessert! I used half the cloves and 2 medium eggs, and sprinkled pecans over half the top. Convect baked at 350 for 30 minutes, it was perfect and so delicious. We did enjoy with vanilla ice cream, thanks so much for the recipe Evin!

This brownie was very good, tasty and nutricious with the great texture. Very easy to make. I added a little less sugar and used walnuts instead of pecan, but it will definitely be great with any nuts or even raisins. I will make this very often in apple season.
