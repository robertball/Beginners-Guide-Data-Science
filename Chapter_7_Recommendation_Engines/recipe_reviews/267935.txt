I made this for the first time this evening. The only alteration was the addition of mushrooms and serving on rice rather than toast. It was delicious! (Even my picky daughter loved it after I picked the mushrooms out of her portion.) This will definitely become a staple in our household. Thank you, Chef John!

I will make this again though the dish came out a little more oily than anticipated. Maybe using less butter than called for would be ideal. I would recommend cooking the chicken the entire way through before blending with the sauce so you dont have to time the chicken cooking all the way through with the desired thickness of the sauce. Also substituting white wine for chicken broth for the deglazing part was a improvement the second time i made this.

I have made dozens of chef Johnâ€™s recipes. This by far is one of my favorites. I cannot believe it has so many few reviews. Try it out folks, you will love it!

Not very difficult to prepare and cook. Turned out just as expected and was delicious.  My wife told me that the serving sizes were too large which was perplexing but you have to listen to your spouse.  Just saying...

Another great recipe from Chef John! I used vegetarian "chicken" pieces, threw in an extra bell pepper and swapped basil for tarragon. A warming comfort food with plenty of flavour.  I think I'll try it over pasta next time.

I roasted the chicken breasts in the oven, and I ended up with enough pan juices to use for the chicken broth. We ate this over rice, and it was delicious!!
