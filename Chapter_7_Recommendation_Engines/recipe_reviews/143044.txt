As a vegetarian without many vegetarian friends/coworkers, this is my go-to dish whenever we have cookouts or I need to bring a side.  Everyone always loves it.  I use 2 red bell peppers and omit the green pepper, use 1 can of corn instead of frozen, and I halve the olive oil.  It's great eaten with a spoon or as a "salsa" substitute on chips.  I've also used it as a topping for baked potatoes.

Nice flavor.  Not spicy, though.  I added chopped tomato and avocado and it made it even better. I will make this again because it was good, easy and healthy.  Next time I will use half the olive oil, though.

I didn't have 100% of the veggies, instead I used only black beans and no green pepper.  I chopped up a few jalapenos and the heat disseminated pretty well.  I was a little leery of the vinaigrette but it turned out pretty well balanced, ill use that as a base fore some experiments in the future.

Awesome recipe, easy to make and gets better every day it sits!  I used canned corn and it was fine, and I added chili sauce to make it a bit spicier.  Thanks for sharing!!

Oh MY!!  I loved this salad!!!   SO VERY GOOD.  I didn't use the Splenda but rather used white sugar to taste.  Added extra cilantro (about a bunch), extra cumin and chili powder to taste and added a touch of paprika.  I've been looking for a bean salad like this for some time....and now, I've found it.  It's a KEEPER.

Very good salad; big solid flavors, but won't overwhelm other elements of whatever you're serving.  I subbed in canned pinto and pinquito beans...not as pretty as the black beans and cannellinis, but one of the people eating had an irrational hatred of black beans, and kidney beans really don't do anything but lay there.  

I also used a mix of very good red wine and sherry vinegars, so the Splenda wasn't necessary.  If you can, toast whole cumin seeds and grind them...a lot more flavor.

Excellent ....used 1 packet of Stevia sugar substitute instead of 2 full tblspns. This was sweet enough with 1 lil packet. Also had to use dried cilantro leaves..1tsp. And 1tsp each of cumin, dried corriander, and chili powder. Great dressing!  This was really not spicy at all...but delicious non the less. I added red hot pepper flakes to mine. Will be a summer goto salad. Really very good and healthy.

I am Over the Moon with this salad. So much flavor , color  and fiber!!! How much better can it get! I used canned corn from Trader joe. I more than doubled the garlic. I was heavy handed with the cilantro, I used 1Tbsp.of sugar and 1 Tblsp. of Splenda. I used 3/4 th of the dressing.
Now I need someone to prevent me from going to the fridge  to just sample  a little bit more.                Thank you Karen Castle for sharing this recipe!

This was good. The only thing I did different was omit the green pepper and added a bit more cilantro. Next time I will half the amount of oil and vinegar, it was more than enough. Very nutritious and colorful dish!

Made this first time  for tailgating at TX Speedway.  Loved it.  Made it a 2nd time for pot lunch at work and folks all wanted leftovers. Changes to recipe included adding a can of chick peas and using entire lemon and lime.  Also aded one finely chopped jalapeno.  Make it a day ahead if you can - to allow flavors to blend.

I really enjoyed this salad, especially the second day - if you like cold beans, you'll like this salad.  We were split though on if it was a dip (which the kids prefered to eat with chips) or a salad but everyone loved it.  I only had 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, used equal amounts of olive oil and one tablespoon sugar, but kept the spices the same. Next time I'll add a couple of dashes of hot sauce as well as a jalapeno pepper.  This was way more than 8 servings for us - more like 14. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Love the original version of this so I was glad to find this revised recipe.  We eat this as a "caviar" bean salsa with tortilla chips.  The vingrette is wonderful as the original!

This salad is EXCELLENT!  I've  made it several times and it's always a hit, even with the kids!  Really the only changes I make is adding a bit more garlic and substituting raw honey for the Splenda.  Easy and quick to make and Super healthy!

Made this at work for a "Chopped" competition with the ingredients roasted red peppers, onions and tangerines.  I substituted tangerine juice for the lemon and lime juices and added lots of little cut up bits of tangerines and then didn't add any additional sugar or sugar substitutes.  I won the competition and now my coworkers ask me to make it about once a month to snack on for the week.

One of my favorite dips to go with chips! I didn't change anything except I put in real sugar instead of Splenda. After preparing, give it a day in the fridge and it'll taste it's best.

What a delicious combo of flavours! I will use less olive oil next time. I added half a jalapeño (minus the seeds) in place of hot sauce. Will make again for sure!

Found the cilantro a little over-whelming and it wasn't hot/spicy at all.  With a little alteration, I'd eat it again.

Very nice!  This would make an excellent side, but we ate it as a vegetarian main dish.  Colorful and tasty, this would be a hit during the warm summer months.

Good base for a bean salad, was not at all spicy so I added jalepenos, omitted corn and added tomatoes. Also, I used stevia instead of splenda (would never cook with that poison known as artifical sweeteners). With those changes it came out pretty good. Also added extra hot sauce, but I like it spicy! Oh, and only needed half the oil/vinegar.

I have been making a version of this recipe for years.  When my Boyfriend and I were craving salad for dinner, I looked this recipe up to see what we needed.  I used sugar instead of Splenda because I am not a sugar substitute gal.  I also added a fresh jalepeno for some bite.  I put this salad on a bed of lettuce and topped it with avocado, tomato, and shredded pepper jack cheese.  It was delicious!
