thighs tend to be a little greasy---remove from pan immediately

This was okay; however I couldn't really taste the spices once the chicken was done. I might try this again and add a few of the spices called for to the veggies too.

This dish was alright not the best. It was really easy though. I used chicken legs instead of thighs. Maybe wine could be added for xtra flavour since there wasn't much on it's own. The left over's didn't get eaten so that tells you there's not much interest in the dish.

This was definitely too bland. It needed some type of sauce but it was a nice change and easy to make.

The veggies got a little soggy but if you remove the aluminum foil about 5-10 min before taking the dish out of the oven it's not a problem. Also Needed more spices but overall not to bad:)

Very easy recipe and healthy too. The house smells great and I will definitely be doing this again. I am using leg quarters for mine. Can't wait to try the breast this way as well!

The recipe was good. Easy to make. However I found I had to cook it an extra 1/2 hour.

I used chicken tenders and there wasn't much grease. I thought it was good but I'd add some green vegetables to add flavor.
