Just made this baste tonight when the BF and I realized we had some chicken and not too much else.  It is absolutely delicious!  I added about two Tbs of Worcestershire sauce, omitted the cayenne pepper, but our pepper mill is filled with a mix of white, black and red pepper.  Very, very good!  Will make again, probably in a day or two!

I have been making this same sauce for basting for 10 years. You are right, everyone loves it. Try brushing both sides of some pumpernickle bread and grilling them with your meal. OH ya!  For Steak, I sub crushed red peppers for the cayanne and add a 1/4 cup of Merlot wine.

This is a great recipe. I used lime juice instead of lemon juice simply because my lemons were not ripe enough. It was great. I loved it. Thank you for sharing!

Thought this was just OK. With the ingredients list, I expect it to be delicious. Will probably tweak and continue to use.

For our Mother's Day BBQ I made this recipe and basted it over tri-tip steaks and they were sooo flavorful and juicy!  I did change it slightly by adding 1 Tbl of Worchestershire sauce.  I will use this again!

I had some cobia steaks that I needed to cook and found this sauce.  I was planning on grilling but time got away so I just cooked my fish in the pan with the sauce. I kept right with the recipe except I adjusted it down to just 3 servings since it was just me and I only had 3 pieces of cobia.  After the sauce was made I just put my fish steaks in the pan and cooked about 4-5 mins on each side along with some basting. The 4 stars were for following the recipe. Yum. On the second one I added a little mayo to the sauce after fish was cooked and that gave it a extra kick. Using  my last piece the next day I warmed it in the leftover sauce, put a piece of cheese on top,  and covered. With that sauce, they were all great and I love that you can add your touch if you want.  This sauce is Great by itself or add your own touch to make it your 5 star.
