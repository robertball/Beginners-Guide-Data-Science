A bit on the bland side. The second time I made them, I added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 of a minced onion and omitted the herbs called for and added in basil and oregano. I also added an egg. Yep, it's a bit distanced from the original recipe but these taste Italian and delicious.

Nice, easy recipe.  I added 1/4 C grated parmesan cheese and one egg to the meat mixture.  I formed meatballs with an 1/8 C measuring scoop and ended up with 20 meatballs.  I skipped the blender step- really unnecessary.

We added about 1/3 cup of milk but still thought these were a little dry. I will try adding an egg next time. I'll also reduce the Rosemary next time, as I found it a little overpowering.

I added breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, and one egg like suggested. So can't really say I stuck with the recipe. The Rosemary and Thyme were too overpowering in my opinion. Probably won't make this one again. If I do it would be with much less rosemary and thyme.

Baked Italian Meatballs came out very flavorful.  Used smoked paprika...will use regular paprika next time I make this dish..it changed the flavor too much..but my family and I still loved it!

Loved it. But I added Italian bread crumbs and an egg. I also cooked the meat balls on a rack to keep it out of the grease.

Very easy.  I doubled the recipe and added one egg and 1/2/ cup panko bread crumbs.   Did not use a blender. I cooked larger meatballs at least 10 minutes longer in 2 separate glass dishes .    Drain oil.  Combine in 1 dish and add sauce.  Cook at least 1/2 hour.  May add 2 eggs and more bread crumbs next time.

Very dry and no flavor. I even tried fresh garlic and added eggs. I do not know what made them dry.
