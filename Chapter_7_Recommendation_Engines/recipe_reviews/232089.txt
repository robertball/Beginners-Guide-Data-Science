YUMMY I love mashed cauliflower and this recipe is the bomb! The mixture of cheeses is perfect, the cream cheese helps to make this a creamy delicious dish. The children at my Sunday dinner table didn't even know they were eating Cauliflower and they came back for seconds. YUMMY!

A long time ago I couldn't stand cauliflower. That was until I went to a restaurant that served Parmesan mashed "potatoes". I ordered it as a side and did not realize that I ordered mashed cauliflower and not actual potatoes. Best food ordering accident ever! I didn't understand back then that they could taste so close to mashed potatoes. Fast-forwarding to now and this recipe - cauliflower and topped with cheese? YES PLEASE! Now this is something I could eat everyday. This is pretty much a base recipe for all of the cheeses you can play around with in this dish. The cream cheese just adds an even more rich, creamy blend to the cauliflower which I enjoy. Then you top it off with a layer of cheddar...cause why the heck not?!

Loved this dish, made it exactly as written except added some Season All. Have seen it with sour cream but think I like the creaminess of the cream cheese better. I definitely felt like it was missing a little something. Might add chives or Parsley next time and call me crazy, but may have to even add a little bit of butter. Can't help myself....

Feb.29, 2016---update---I made this again, today, for dinner. The only seasonings I put in it were salt, pepper and season all, I left my Cauliflower a little chunkier and I did add the butter. I used a half stick and it was so, so good! Def could've used a little less and it would've still been good but gosh what a difference.

Yummy! This was my first attempt at mashed Cauliflower. I love potatoes and I loved this just as much. The consistency of this is almost the same and it cooks faster than potatoes. I didn't steam it. Instead, I cooked it like pasta and drained it before mashing. It mashes like potatoes too. No starch means it's not gummy. I only had about a tablespoon of cream cheese so I threw that in. I added a bit of shredded cheddar/jack in the mix. I topped with blue cheese crumbles because we had some and because we love blue cheese. I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  My husband thought it was better than mashed potatoes (and he loves mashed potatoes). This is a keeper recipe and my new go to. Amazing.

First of all, I LOATHE cooked cauliflower! Hate the smell!  With that said, I have found myself in need of a comparable potato side to our grilled chicken, steak, etc. --- especially now that I'm on a low carb way of life! This recipe has saved my life. I am rating it a five-- as is. However, the second time I made it, I added a bit more Parmesan cheese, bumped up the garlic, added onion powder, chives, parsley, celery salt, and a touch of cayenne because I like the kick! The magic of this dish is that one can tailor it to her or his particular palate! Well done, AMiller...and THANK YOU!

When I mentioned mashed cauliflower to my husband, he was less than enthusiastic. He ate it all and loved it - that's the test! I followed the recipe adding crumbled bacon as shown in one of the photos. Yes, I'll make it again.

I lowered the calories in this dish to about 75 per serving. I used Neufchâtel Cheese and fat free cheddar cheese. The other thing I added was red pepper flakes. I enjoyed it very much.

This was very, very good.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I changed it slightly.  I used whipped cream cheese, added bacon bits, and increased the amount of Parmesan cheese by a few tablespoons.  I also added chopped chives.  This is fun recipe to experiment with according to your taste.

Made this for the first time tonight, and boy was it a hit! I used a package of diced cauliflower that was large, and steamed in the microwave. Since the cauliflower was large,  I eyeballed the amounts of the rest of the ingredients list, adjusting as needed....oh, and added chives to the mix. My family was completely fooled

I really don't like cauliflower that much but had to try this recipe.  I'm still not a big fan of cauliflower after eating this but I'll eat it if it's prepared like this.  So if you really like cauliflower, you'll really like this... might even make it almost every night.

Surprisingly good, but crack a window because WHOA.  I was looking for a diabetic friendly sub for mashed potatoes and made a Shepherd's Pie with this recipe.  Not bad!  The cauliflower is a little too sweet to really convince, but still good.  Use a blender.  I flung micro-florets all over the counter with the hand mixer.  And be warned,  Farts of Death.  Enjoy it, but turn the fan on and crack the window later, it'll scare your dog.

Delicious!  Changed it by using yogurt instead of cream cheese.  I think next time I may add bacon and jalapeños.

Next time, I'm going to use garlic salt and a touch of chicken broth.  It was a little dry, and there wasn't enough seasoning.  Great along with low-carb meatloaf and a salad!

I've been making this for the last few months and it is delicious! It's better than mashed potatoes. One of my wife's colleagues hates cauliflower and after tasting this she asked for the recipe. I'm rating the original recipe but since making it I have experimented with a little sour cream, onion powder, and always add dried chives. We love this recipe!

I made it in an instant pot (IP) with frozen cauliflower.  I first cooked the cauliflower till tender and then mashed it with the cream cheese and followed the rest of the instructions.  I am allergic to pepper so left it out.  I put a cup of water in my instant pot and then put it in a lidded container which I placed on the IP trivet.  I cooked it on high pressure for 20 and let it naturally  release for 10 minute and then released the rest of the pressure by hand.  It was wonderful...my husband loved it too.  Since I am diabetic the 5.9 carbs per serving is why I tried this recipe.

This is a pretty tasty way to use the cauliflower from my garden. Followed the recipe as written except that I did not have cheddar cheese and substituted Velveeta. (It was all I had.)  Not sure it really needs the extra cheese on it. I might try substituting  sour cream for cream cheese next time..

It was a super easy recipe, but I added baked chicken into it and replaced parmesan with Italian breadcrumbs cuz I ran out of parmesan. It's just about to come out the oven so hopefully it works together ?

Love this recipe!  Great for low carb diet. Even hubby, who hates cauliflower, liked it. Didn’t have cream cheese so used a little butter & heavy cream instead.

Delicious. Easy. Fast. Will definitely make this time and time again. I only used ½ of the garlic called for - my garlic powder is from Penzey's and is strong and really good, so it was enough.

Followed the recipe, except added chive and onion cream cheese as suggested by other reviews.  I also had to boil the cauliflower since I didn't have the proper steamer, still came out very good.  We will be having this again.

This is going on the menu often at our house.  Hubby raved about it.  I didn't change any of the ingredients although I think I will cut back on the garlic powder a smidgen.  The only thing I did different was use my food processor to mash the cauliflower and mix all the ingredients - it made life easier.

Woooooooow!!!!
Now that we have that out of the way...  let me say , I tweeked this a bit.. I added 1/4 c diced onion,  1/2 c mayonnaise,  1/4 c milk  and 3 tbsp cornstarch 
I did this because it was initially too garlicky.. but what this did to it over all made this something that I didn't want to stop eating!!!!! I baked for 40 min ..
Absolutely delish!!!!!! Will be making again!!! #ketofriendly

This was delicious, my husband who doesn't like cauliflower actually enjoyed it. I made it instead of potatoes to lower our carb intake, but with all the cheeses I'm wondering how much healthier it actually was.

This was so good! I followed the recipe exactly and I was so happy. It still tastes like cauliflower (which is ok with me) so I wouldn't mistake it for potatoes but I'll definitely make that again!

I can't believe how delicious it was and that I never heard of making cauliflower this way in my 40-something years on earth. I boiled the cauliflower based upon others who found it diffucult to mash after steaming. This will become a regular side dish in the house from now on.

Absolutely delicious.  We called it "popcorn casserole" to encourage the kids to try it, although they still weren't fans.  That's just more for the adults!  Four of us plowed through most of a double batch.  Next time I think I will steam the cauliflower longer to make it much softer and easier to mash/mix.

We made this for the first time for Thanksgiving this year.  It was sooo good and such a hit that we made it again for Christmas, and even though we just finished the leftovers a few days ago, my husband insisted that we make it again for New Years.

AWESOME!  I chopped the cauliflower up and used my pampered chef large microcooker -- 9 minutes and I had perfect cauliflower.  I used 5 oz of cream cheese and also used Kraft Italian recipe Parmesan cheese so I did not have to add many seasonings.  I also pressed a garlic clove instead of using powder.  Topped with a handful of cheddar cheese -- this was a huge hit!!!

Wonderful. I did add chive and onion cream cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe. I also made this earlier in the day, so when my company came, all I had to do was reheat in the oven. I forgot to add the cheese on top, but it was still great. Will definitely make again.

I made this today and it as DELISH! But, I added some Zesty Lemon Seasoning made by Webber grilling company.... It put a tang to the dish that my family loved! I will definitely be making this again!
