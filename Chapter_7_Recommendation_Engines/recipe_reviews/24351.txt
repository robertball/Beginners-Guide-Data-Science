Great recipe - even easier to pull off the second time around.  A few lessons I discovered:
1) As others mention, use 8oz of cream cheese in frosting, not 3 oz as listed in recipe.  Turns out perfect with 8 oz.  Must be a typo.
2) I let mine rise for about 3 hours, they got much larger and fluffier that way - 1 hour wasn't enough. May be a result of the yeast I used?
3) The dental floss trick mentioned in other reviews worked great.
4) I have no idea how one is can roll out a rectangle!  I just did a big circle and pulled out the corners by hand.
5) Leave the far side (the one you are rolling the "worm" of dough toward) clear of any butter or sugar mixture.  It is easier to seal the seam if you have about 1/2" of clean dough to work with along that seam edge.

This recipe is the best one I've ever tried for cinnamon rolls, and I'm really picky.  I did, however, do a couple things differently:  1) let the stand mixer knead it, which transformed it from sticky to smooth dough in 10 min, eliminating the need for extra flour 2) let the dough rise after kneading for 2 HRS - this makes it pliable, silky, and very easy to roll out into rectangles (plus, much lighter), 3) after rolling and refrigerating overnight, let them rise for 2 more hours in the morning (I know, it's a lot of time, but it's soooo worth it!).  The end results were rolls that were tender, fluffy, and soft even after they cooled off.  The frosting was amazing too.  Thanks for this recipe!  It will definitely be a regular in my reportoire!

p.s. - for those who don't have a stand mixer, try letting the mixture rest for 10 minutes before kneading it (a French method known as autolyse).  Flour needs time to absorb water, which will help with the sticky dough problem.

This recipe is easily halved :) 
As for refrigerating the night before baking, I let the dough rise for an hour before I shape it into rolls. Then after shaped into rolls, I put in pan in fridge covered with plastic wrap. Then I turn the oven on in the morning and let them rise at room temperature/on top of oven for about 30 min-to an hour, until about doubled. Works wonderfully. And the frosting is sooooooo good!

very good recipe.  One tip i would suggest is that after letting the milk mixture cool down some add the sugar and yeast first.  also you want the liquid to be around 105 - 115 degrees F.  if you add the salt at the same time as yeast it will cause the yeast not to activate and due to this you will have problems getting it to rise.  the yeast feeds off of the sugar which causes it to activate and rise more quickly.  adding salt before the yeast activates kills off some of the yeast.  So once you add the sugar and yeast wait about 10 minutes or until some foam forms on the surface of the liquid before adding the rest of the ingredients.

Good recipe but as a professional baker I would suggest to put all dry ingredients in bowl ( I also added 2tbls of glueton to flour (found in grocery store with the flour) this gives it a lighter, fluffy texture and helps preserve longer. Sugar activates the yeast not the salt as a review mentioned. I also melted butter and spread on dough then the brown sugar and sprocket cinnamon with raisins. Put in refrigerator if u want to bake in A.M.  One viewer said it took a long time to rise. If u have a bread proofing cycle on your range use it. Otherwise if you press 140-200 no hotter on your oven then shut off put rolls in this cut rising time in half without killing the yeast. If u don't want the work u can use a loaf of frozen bread dough put in microwave on defrost for 4-5 minutes should be soften to roll if not put back in for 1 more minute only then roll spread melted butter, cinnamon mix with white or brown sugar or half brown & half white sugar and raisins roll up and cut 9-11 slices. Put in greased Pan not touching allowing for doubling in size then repeat oven instructions for proofing  when doubled bake 350 for 15 minutes

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his co-workers, (they're firemen). They absolutely loved them. Now they all want the recipe so that they can have their wives/girlfriends make them at home. They especially loved the icing. I did need a little extra flour. Also I made up an extra batch of the cinnamon/brown sugar. I put it in a bowl with melted butter (just enought to make a slightly runny paste). Then I spread it over the tops of the cinnamon rolls right befor they go in the oven. It gives them just that much more yumminess. They especially loved the icing. These are now a favorite among my family, co-workers, and several local firehouses.

If you're a novice (like me) or looking for a compilation of most useful reviews, I'm listing the tips I found most helpful for these HEAVENLY rolls. I'd never used active yeast or made 'real' bread before, so I spent some time researching to figure out what to do and when. Here are my tips! 1)Once milk mixture cooled, added yeast & sugar then let sit 10 min to ensure yeast activated, then added salt, eggs, flour. 2)Added extra 1/2 C. flour to manage stickiness of the dough. After all flour was mixed, I let dough sit ~10 min (autolyse method). 3)After kneading, placed dough in greased bowl & placed wet towel over top to let rise ~2 hrs. 4)Divided dough, then used 9x12 sheet pan to gently press dough into rectangle 5)doubled cinnamon (4 tsp) for "filling" 6)Rolled dough from long edge, wrapped in plastic & put in fridge to cool (easier for slicing). I later sliced, put in pans (two 9x13 and one pie plate) and put back in fridge overnight. 7)Spacing - I did 9 rolls in each 9x13 pan, spaced about 1.5" apart. They rose enough during baking that they ended up covering entire pan, edges touching 8)In the AM, preheated oven and let pans sit on warm stove for 1 hr to let rise a bit more. Added leftover butter and sugar/cinnamon to tops & baked ~22 mins. 9) doubled cream cheese for frosting (6oz) which hydrated frosting enough that I didn't add milk, but definintely got a thicker frosting.  If you want "drizzling" consistency, add a little milk.

These were well worth the effort.  As for making ahead of time, I wasn't sure at what point to stop, so I made the rolls and put them in the pan - then placed in fridge.  Got up early to let them warm, then rise, and then baked.  Delicious!

I am not really sure how to review this recipe since I did not follow it exactly. I have some experience with sweet breads and I was puzzled by a couple of things with this recipe.  First of all, there is no step for yeast proofing, it does not instruct you to add the eggs called for in the ingrediants list nor does it call for a first rising of the dough before forming the rolls.  So, here is what I did.  I used the one cup of water called for (110-115 degrees) with 2 T. of sugar out of the 1 cup called for as the proofing.  When the yeast was foamy after 10 minutes I added the milk, butter, sugar, salt, eggs (which should be at room temp).  I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla and then I added first 2 cups of flour.  After all the flour was added I used the dough hook on my stand mixer to beat the dough for about 5 minutes.  The dough was sticky and shiny, not soft and smooth but sticky and shiny is what you should have with a sweet bread.  Anyway, I scraped it into a buttered bowl and let it raise about 1 1/2 hours. Poured it out on a floured board and divided it in two pieces. Rolled into rectangle and added filling along with some extra cinnamon.  Placed rolls in buttered dish and let them raise again for about 1 1/2 hours.  Baked for 25 minutes.  I used the frosting recipe but added a little more butter and powdered sugar so that I had enough to really slather the rolls.  These were so good my husband almost swooned.  I am giving the recipe as it is 3 stars but with

These are absolutely divine!  I was very nervous about these, as they were my first cinnamon rolls and I can have difficulties using yeast.  I made these the night before, put them in the fridge, and let them rise and baked them in the morning.  My boyfriend does not belive that I made these myself! Thanks for the recipe!

I forgot to add the egg until 15 minutes into the dough cycle so I pulled out the dough and worked the egg in by hand. I put it back in the bread machine and started it over.  I was worried that the dough would be tough but it turned out wonderful.  So, I'm thinking next time I'll remember the egg and it will even be better.  My family loved these!  Next time I may use a bigger pan like a lasagna pan since 13X9 was a bit crowded.

WOW!  Definately for those with a sweet tooth.  I Poured 1/4c corn syrup, 1/2 c butter and 1 c brown sugar mixture over before baking and the rolls turned out very moist and yummy.  My boyfriend has a new favorite food.

This recipe is great!! It smelled so delicious even before my family had a chance to taste it. After trying, they couldn't get enough! A few suggestions: WAY too much sugar in the original recipe. I used 1/4 cup of sugar in the dough instead of 1 cup, and 1 cup of sugar in the filling (instead of 2 cups). Still turned out perfectly fine. The frosting was also way to sweet and thick for our liking, so we use a mixture of confectioner's sugar and warm water in a 1:2 ratio. Add the sugar first, then add the water. Stir until clear. Otherwise, these cinnamon rolls were amazing!!

This is the recipe I've been looking for! The one I normally use only makes half as many & with this much work, it's good to make more rather than less. As to rolling out the dough, I've always spread the dough with my hands; using a regular sized baking sheet, gently but firmly spread the dough towards the edges until you have a rectangle of dough which is fairly even in depth. I did appreciate the tip not to put any sugared filling on the last bit of dough; it does make it easier to roll up and makes it stick to itself much better. The icing is a bit sweet for some tastes, but by leaving out the cream cheese & butter & using a plain old confectioners sugar & milk icing, the sweetness factor is lessened. Delicious recipe!

We loved these cinnamon rolls AFTER I used a whole EIGHT ounce package of cream cheese for the frosting...I don't know if the 3 ounce thing was a typo or what, but the frosting was really gross and only sugary that way. They were a little more dense than I like, too, but maybe that's because they didn't seem to rise very much...maybe the yeast I used.

My mother has made tis recipe for 70 years.  Instead of a frosting to top off the rolls, make a caramel topping by covering the bottom of the pan with brown sugar and pecans drizzled with melted butter.  Place rolls on top, bake, and, when done, immediately invert the pan onto aluminum foil.  The warm caramel & pecans make a perfect topping.

Great recipe. I have made bread for years but this was the first time I made cinnamon rolls. I let the dough rise for about 1 hour before I rolled it out and then allowed it to rise for another hour before popping into the fridge overnight. In the morning I took the rolls out and let them rise another hour and then baked.

Amazingly good! Halved the recipe and worked great. After in the stand mixer with hook attachment and kneading, let rest in a lightly oiled glass bowl for 2 hours. Then after rolling and cutting, placed in greased 9x13 and let sit out overnight to rise and then baked in the morning. Didn't have to put in refrigerator.

This recipe is perfect. I followed it exactly, and these have made it to the top of our christmas tradition list. They were even good the next day. I did use the autolyse technique that another reviewer mentioned where I let the dough proof for about 10 mins before kneading so the flour could absorb the water. This made the dough easier to knead and less sticky. This was the first time I have ever kneaded dough, and it came out perfectly. Simply delish and so worth the work.

I made a half recipe of this. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar (I cut the sugar back to a quarter cup) for ten minutes, then added the butter, eggs, warm milk,  flour and salt. I did need a little more flour than what was called for in the recipe, almost another full cup. I kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes, then set the dough to rise for an hour or so in a large greased bowl on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and mixed the softened butter (I upped the butter to a full half cup--for a half recipe) together with the brown sugar (changed to light brown sugar as that was all I had on hand) and cinnamon before I spread it on the dough. I sliced them up and set them in a baking pan, covered them with foil and set them in the fridge. In the morning, I set the cold rolls back on the warm heating pad to rise again for another hour or so. 400 degrees for a little over 15 minutes and they were done. When I made the icing, I only used one cup of confectioners sugar and only a little over a tablespoon of milk. I used a spoon to glob it on the top and as the icing warmed, I spread it with a knife. I was able to get 12 rolls out of a half recipe so adusting the servings was spot on. I did split the rolls into two pans, one was for my family and another I gave to my favorite cashiers. All were eaten and very much enjoyed.

Had to make two batches because I didn't closely read the other reviews that said you need to add more flour than the recipe states in order to avoid very stick, unworkable dough.  Second batch with more flour worked perfectly and I will make these from now on.  I have avoided working with yeast in the past, so it felt great to have a successful experience and delicious cinnamon rolls on Christmas morning.

First time making Cinnamon Rolls, could not believe how great they came out!!  Definitely due to the recipe.  It was my first time kneading dough and was worried they wouldn't turn out, but I let it rise for 2-3 hours (like other reviews) and it was worth the extra time for the huge rise and fluffy rolls.  Fantastic recipe!

QUESTION: When placing on the baking sheet, how far apart do you place them or should they touch? Thanks.

Loved these!  I used my bread maker to make the dough last night, then let these rise overnight.  They baked up light and fluffy this morning. I only made 1/2 batch and ended up with 14 decent sized rolls.   The frosting is the perfect topping to these rolls.  My kids were in heaven this morning.

Better than I could ever have predicted.  I wanted a recipe for buttermilk cinnamon rolls, so I substituted buttermilk for the milk in the dough and frosting.  I also added orange zest to the frosting which just added a little extra charter to the vanilla frosting.  This dough is so easy to work with.  I'm looking forward to making these Christmas morning.

This is about the third time I have made these, each time they get better and better. Maybe I am just getting better at it. I have found with this recipe, your friend is the Stand Mixer. Yes, the dough is sticky: don't keep adding flour. After kneading, flour your surface, work the flour into the dough and let rise for at least an hour. At this point make dough into cinnamon rolls, then let rise for at least an hour again. The frosting was great just as written, I like cream cheese, but not alot. Thank you for this recipe, it made some of the best cinnamon rolls me, my family, and friends have ever had.

Amazing! My friends loved it and it tasted wonderful- soft, fluffy and delicious. I am definitely making this again. My husband’s family has a tradition of making either sweet rolls or cinnamon rolls Christmas morning. After she had some, she asked me to make them this Christmas, they were so good!

I used a lot of the tips I read from other reviews- adding the yeast and sugar to the lukewarm (105-115 degrees) Milk & water and let it sit 10 min before combining the rest of the ingredients... letting it rest for 10min before kneading it, letting is raise in a greased bowl for 2 hrs.

I had rolled and cut the dough, placed them on pans and i stuck them in the fridge to bake in the AM. I let it sit on the counter to warm to room temp and let it rise a little before baking. 

I frosting was so easy to make and super yummy!

Delicious! They were pretty easy to make, but took a long time to rise... I would ideally let them rise for 2-3 hours. I also added a sprinkle of extra sugar and cinnamon on top with some extra melted butter! Yum!

Really good, the key IS letting them stand after you cut them  and put them on the sheet, the last  rise is the important one, remember to cover with a damp cloth. I always start my yeast first no matter what, warm water or milk according to recipe, yeast and a tablespoon of sugar from the recipe....stir and let stand till its nice and bubbly.........then add to the rest of the ingredients. Perfect every time!

I followed the instructions in the "Forming and Baking Cinnamon Rolls" article. You can have the rolls touching but remember that they will take longer to cook inside that way so you may have to cover after a while.

Very good!  They were golden brown on top @20 min, but I should have covered with foil and left them in a little longer.  They were mostly done, but just a little gooier than I like. Otherwise, very tasty.  Also, sharp kitchen scissors work well to slice the rolls (better than my dental floss- it was shredding!).

These are amaaaazing.  I've never made anything requiring yeast and kneading before, so I was kinda nervous at first.  But it ended up being a lot easier than I thought, and the kneading thing was pretty fun.  I used more flour than it called for because the dough was pretty sticky at first, but they came out great.  My whole family was raving about them.  This is definitely a new family favorite! Don't be afraid of making these if you are a novice like me.  :-)

I made the for our Christmas Brunch. They were AMAZING!!! I also had a very sticky dough after adding the remaining 4 cups of flour. Don't Panic and don't adjust the recipe. Just generously flour your board, dump the dough out, knead the flour in. Use a bench scraper (if you have one) to lift and fold over, Keep kneading and adding more flour, a few Tablespoons at a time. When dough stops sticking and is smooth as a babies bum, you're good to go.

These freeze very well. I made the full recipe and then put half in little bags of 2-4 uncooked rolls each and froze them. When I'm ready to cook them I just take them out about an hour before and let them de-thaw on the counter before I cook them. Haven't noticed a difference in quality or taste doing that

This took a long time to make.  But perhaps it's the extra love required that makes them so darn good.  I can't believe how delicious they are.  My husband also gave his two thumbs up.  Yummy and decadent.  However, because of the work involved, I'll probably save this recipe for company or a holiday.

in order to guarantee the dough rising, i proof my yeast separately on the counter (with 1 c warm water and 1 t sugar) before i start the recipe.  this always turns out great and very easy to make.

Wonderful recipe! These tasted fabulous! We did have to add a lot of extra flour though (at least 2 cups) to get it to look right. I like a lot of frosting on my cinnamon rolls so I didn't feel that there was quite enough frosting to properly frost both pans; next time I might make a double batch of the frosting. We will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent rolls! I let them rise for 2 hours, but they didn't grow much larger. I finally gave up and put them in the oven--they really puffed up there! I would recommend not using a dark pan. The sugar leaked out and burned. I used a white pan the second time and it was much better.

These were good, and everyone said they were good, but they just didn't rise that much. These resembled thick cookies instead of high rolls. I let them rise twice, two hours at a time but I guess it just wasn't enough. Maybe the yeast was old or something. Overall, the taste was good but the texture and the height wasn't terrific. (Note: I used half white sugar because I ran out of brown but they tasted just fine.)

My family loved these.  Not as light/fluffy as I'd like, but I'm thinking my water was too hot for the yeast.  I'd definitely make again.

What can I say but wow! These were fantastic. I made them for a Sunday breakfast when a friend came to stay for the weekend. He had one hot out of the oven and loved it so much that he immediately ate two more! They are very light and fluffy. However, the cream cheese frosting would have been too much sickly sweetness for me, so I just brushed the top of the cooked rolls with melted butter and sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and brown sugar on top.

I wasn't too sure about these when I was making them, but they are really the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. This was my first time making any type of bread, and I learned a few things with these. 1) Use a stand mixer to knead the dough. Makes it much easier. 2) don't roll the dough too thin; otherwise it will break when being rolled up. I also made these the night before baking and they turned out delicious, but a lot of the brown sugar filling leaked out into the bottom of the pan. This wasn't a problem though because it created a kind of sticky syrup at the bottom. So you have the stickiness on the bottom, cream cheese frosting on top, and soft tasty rolls in between. They reheated in the microwave really well too. I will definitely make these again and again and again...

These were very good...my first time making them too.  I rolled the dough a bit thinner, makes a bigger roll not so thick walled, sprinkled a cup of raisins (pre soaked)into one batch and pressed them lightly into the dough, then sprinkled a bit of cinnamon over top the raisins then sprinkled on the brown sugar/cinnamon mix. Also, I didn't think the original recipe made enough icing for 24 rolls so I added an extra cup of icing sugar and an extra ounce of cream cheese and extra milk.  ENJOY!

I let the bread machine do the work and on my machine, the dough cycle is 1.5 hrs.  I used bread flour, light butter, skim milk and egg beaters and had no problems with the dough.  After making the rolls, I refrigerated overnight.  In the morning they had almost doubled in size and after letting sit out at RT for 1 hr, they had almost doubled again.  My family was super surprised at the light, yeasty flavor and have already requested they be made again soon.  I'm not a good baker and this recipe came out beautifully. Will definitely make again.

I've used a cinnamon roll recipe for years and this recipe is now replacing that one, which is an old family recipe.
One thing I kept from the old recipe is using 1 cup of bread flour and 5 cups of all-purpose flour. 
I use my mixer and dough hook to initially put the dough together and let the dough hook knead it until it looks about ready then turn it on to a floured board and knead it another few minutes.
At this point, I put it in a greased bowl and let rise til double, about 45 min, then punch down and let rise again til double. Then at that point I shape the dough according to the recipe. Cover and let the rolls rise til double, then bake. I use the convected bake setting on my oven at 350 for 20 min or til done.
These rolls are so tender and yummy!

The icing was good, a good topping but recipe didn't used enough flour. The brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon was also a little flat.

These are amazing!! We made them this Christmas and have made them a few other times since then. I made them the night before and then let them sit over night. They turned out amazing! They were soft and sweet! If I didn't make them myself I would swear that they were from a restaurant!

I would cook them for a little less than the recipe calls for. When I cooked them they turned out dry, and I like mine soft and moist. I also had trouble with the brown sugar. As it was baking, all the sugar melted out of the of the cinnamon roll and stuck to the baking pan.

These were a real hit.  Will definitely make again.  I had to add significantly more flour though.  Only other change was that I added raisins to half the filling, in future I will put them in all.

This was an excellent recipe! I have never made cinnamon rolls from scratch and these turned out PERFECT.  I actually used my breadmaker to make the dough, and it was beautiful dough.  Next time I make these I would only make one change and that is to add an egg wash prior to baking to seal in the cinnamon and sugar that oozed out of the rolls and hardened like caramel around the edges after the rolls cooled.

Best dough for cinnamon rolls ever! Mine needed about 1 more cup of flour. The secrets are: 1) bake just until golden brown on top and still whitish on bottom, and 2) use the right pan. I used a pyrex and a glass pie dish with a thick bottom. The ones in the pie dish came out so much softer and fluffier! Delicious! Otherwise I followed the recipe, except I did not make the frosting. Thank you for this recipe!

I'm a cheater. I used frozen bread dough instead of making my own. I got the idea from a cooking show on foodnetwork. These were perfect, and so easy! There is a lot of room to change the filling to as much or as little as you like

I was quite disappointed with this recipe (...and this was a first for me--I've been completely pleased with EVERY other recipe that I've used from allrecipes.com!).  I wish that I'd read the previous reviews, since I went by the star rating only.  I followed the recipe exactly, THEN had to add 2 1/2 cups EXTRA FLOUR.  (With the 6 cups called for in the recipe, the dough was simply "batter", and I find it hard to believe that in any weather, climate or humidity, one would be successful using this recipe.).  Adding this much extra flour left the rolls dry, hard and pretty much tasteless.  YUCK!  I definitely DON'T recommend this recipe.

I've been making these for almost every birthday in our household for 3 years (and I have 5 kids)! We love them. I usually make the dough in the bread machine and then refrigerate the second half of the dough to make sweet bread on another day. And instead of halving the filling/topping- we add it all to the one batch because...it just turns out so sticky and yummy. Do use softened butter and not melted to avoid making hard candy at the bottom of your dish!

I made these, put them in the fridge overnight and baked in the morning.  Used my mixer with dough hooks to prepare the dough.   It was lovely to work with, however once baked I foun them to a disappointment -  they had an odd texture, not like anything I've ever made or had before. Also 2 cups of brown sugar is too much.  I had about 1/2 cup left over and  still found it to be too much sugar. 
Probably won't make them again..

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls homemade.  This wasnt a good recipe.  They didnt rise at all but when I baked them they did double in size.  If you dont eat them right away, they are hard as a rock.  Not soft at all.  I will say cream cheese frosting was good but you have to add more cream cheese than it calls for.  The flavor wasnt very good either kinda dull.  So, I dont know maybe this recipe needs to be revamped or something.  I was disappointed.

Great base recipe. I did make some changes, in that I use stevia and vanilla powder in the dough and splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar. Otherwise, wonderful recipe. I only made the changes after making them exactly as the recipe states. Either way, turn out wonderfully!

A good cinnamon roll recipe. I proofed the yeast first--after boiling the milk, added the butter, water and a few tablespoons of the white sugar. Waited till it was warm (as to not kill the yeast). Added the yeast and waited 5 min till frothy. Then added the rest of the sugar and egg and poured the wet mixture into the flour and salt. This prevents the salt from killing the yeast.The rolls are Fluffy and heartwarming! I cut the recipe in half. Divided the filling in half-used half inside the rolls and added 1/8 c . of pumpkin pie filling and some raisins (soaked in hot water first). Used the remaining half of the filling (melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon)  to spread on top before baking. AMAZING Taste! To fancy up the frosting a bit...I added a little maple syrup instead of milk, a splash of lemon juice so it wasn't all overly sweet and fresh ground cardamon to taste. The symphony of flavors was great. I too let it rise about 3 hours and baked them a little longer till slightly golden brown. Make sure you leave enough space in the pan because they turn our huge. Half the recipe made 10 rolls for me. I did 4 per 8" pie pan and they filled the pan in the end. Enjoy!

I have just spend the last 48 hours making 4 different cinnamon roll recipes trying to find the ONE that I was looking for.  After 3 recipes, this one is the closest.  I wanted something light but with a boost of flavor.  While I did make some changes, this one was the closest.  First of all, I needed about 8 cups of flour before my dough would come together, no matter how much kneading I did.  Secondly, to make 24 rolls, I needed more flavor in my filling so I used 2 cups of brown sugar mixed with 3 tbsp of cinnamon.  I made my dough, let it rise for 2 hours, rolled it out in two separate pieces, filled, cut, let rise another hour then baked at 375 for 22 minutes, though 350 would have been better as my rolls got a little browner than I would have liked on the outside.  After a few more tweaks I think I will have finally found THE ONE.

The dough was way too heavy. I'm not sure if this was due to the high altitude where I live. I did give it ample time to rise (once before making into rolls, and again after making into rolls). Not sure I will try these again.

These are absolutely wonderful! I had never made HOMEMADE cinnamon rolls before and was kinda scared. But I will never fear again. I have made them several times and they turn out every time and are better than ANY store bought! This is our favorite weekend treat! I make them up the night before and bake them in the morning. And if papa hears I have made them, beware...he is soon knocking on the door!

I have been making  cinnamon rolls for many years with my Mother's recipe. She was well known for her rolls. I tried this recipe  because it makes  a smaller amount. I will probably never go back to the other recipe. i made these the past two weekends at my daughter's in England to rave reviews.I especially like being able to form the rolls as soon as you make the dough and then putting in fridge over night. I let them sit out about an hour before baking. I am not sure that is necessary. AWESOME

Great recipe, thank you for sharing.  I used the dough as a dinner roll also omitting the sugar and cinnamon rolling them in balls, turned out great.  Thanks again for sharing.

These were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had.  I split mine into two pans one I baked the same day the second I placed in the fridge overnight.  The ones I let rise in the fridge overnight definitely rose better, but both were delicious.  I will never by store bought again.

Loved them! I followed the advice of several other people. I was waiting to add the salt in because several of the other reviews said it would hinder the rinsing process, but then i forgot to put it in all together (haha) And i let it sit for 2 hrs before rolling it out to rise, but it did not do much rising for some reason (maybe the lack of salt) So i rolled it out put the yummy brown sugar, Cinnamon mix on it and sliced them up, used a non stick butter spray for a 13X9 pan and let them sit with saran wrap over it over night on the counter, when i got up they had risen more. I baked them and they turned out delicious. I could tell i had forgot the salt though (haha) All and all good experience, and reading all the reviews really REALLY helped.

"CINNABUNS" move over, this recipe is awesome, best homemade cinnamon rolls I have tried.  I added raisens to half the batch and they were great.  My daughter suggested adding chopped pecans, which I'll definitely try the next time.  Way To Go Pat.

The bread had good flavor. I did not like that much of the cinnamon filling ran to the bottom of the pan- that would be ok if you were making sticky buns

I made these rolls for Father's Day and everyone loved them. Several women asked for the recipe. I did add an extra cup of flour and would double the cinnamon next time I make them. I have never had rolls raise as well as I did with this recipe. It's a keeper!

I halved the recipe and got 1 9 x 13 pan full plus about 4 or 5 extra which I put in another small pan.  After step 1 I just put everything in my bread machine (flour and yeast last) and let it do all the work.  After filling pans I refrigerated dough overnight then pulled out on Easter morning to let rise and popped them in the oven.  I really liked the texture of the rolls although for me the cooking time was too long.  I think at 375 15 minutes is enough so watch very carefully or they will be overcooked and won't be nice and soft.  I think next time I will lower oven temp to 350 to avoid overcooking.  Also, next time I won't halve the frosting because I had to mix up more since there wasn't quite enough for my batch.  I believe this is a better recipe for rolls than the Clone of a Cinnabon roll recipe on here.  That roll dough always comes out a bit tougher and the texture of the rolls isn't as nice.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

These turned out delicious!  Here are my deviations from the recipe:  First of all, I made 1/4 of the recipe (6 rolls).  Second, when using Active Dry Yeast, sometimes you need to ACTIVATE it-- my 50-cent package came with directions on the back--basically take some water (deduct it from the recipe total), add some sugar for the yeast to eat, add the yeast, let it sit for 5 minutes or so, and THEN dump it in and continue with the recipe.  This ensures the yeast is active.  Third, I ended up using more than the apportioned amount of flour, simply because I don't know how to knead dough and kept adding some to keep it from sticking to me.  Fourth, I let the rolls rise in my oven (heated to 170 and then turned off) since my house is about 60 this time of year (so consider the temperature as a factor in rising time).  This took about 3-4 hours.  They came out with good texture and the icing was very nom too!

Yummy and very easy! I've never made cinnamon rolls before, so I was a little bit nervous, but they turned out great. I made them the night before, then when I got up, I preheated the oven and let them sit for half an hour. Perfect!!

These were great. I added extra cinnamon and I actually made them overnight by letting them rise in the pans then just putting in the refrigerator overnight.

These were delicious. I used 8 ounces of cream cheese as others suggested. It was perfect. I also used half light and half dark brown sugar because that's all I had on hand. I had some tightly packed in one pan and just a few spread out in my second one. The packed ones came out moist and delicious and the others were hard on the outside and burnt a little on the bottom. Next time I'll make sure I have enough to tightly pack both pans. I added extra filling and next time I'll add more cinnamon too. I also spread melted butter on the tops halfway through baking and they came out wonderful!

Absolutely the Best!!!! My adult kids and hubby loved them. I kinda messed up, or so I thought because I let the dough rise a little before I kneaded it. Then I rolled it out. I definitely had to use more flour than called for as the dough was quite sticky after I had mixed it thoroughly, so I just continued to add flour until the texture was right. I then placed it in a sprayed with cooking pam bowl, covered with damp towel and placed in a warm place for an hour. I then halved it and began rolling into a rectangle, which I didn't have any problems with.  I placed them in three seperate pans, placed two in the freezer for later. (I placed the pan in a Ziplock freezer bag, sealed and into the freezer). Then I let the rolls I wanted to cook, rise for another 1/2-45 minutes, then baked as directed.  The creme topping was great! I don't care for that much sugar, so I just used 1cp confectioners, it was perfect for us.  Thank you soo much!!!!

I mixed everything step by step and they did not rise. I think I should have let the dough rise after it said to divide the dough in half. The recipe did not say to do it this way though. Very dissapointing with all the ingredients and time it took to make them.

To die for!!  I put myself through college baking cinnamon buns at a bakery so this recipe made me feel young again!!  I followed the dough recipe exactly.  I think that if I were more  patient, I would have let it rise longer.  I changed the icing recipe to make it more watery so i could put it in a bottle and drizzle it out on top of the buns.  I also brushed the top of the buns with butter after baking them.  I used to make so many flavors and I plan to use this recipe as a base.  You can easily make chocolate buns by using brown sugar and chocolate chips.  Apple cinnamon by getting a can of apple pie filling and adding a row or two on top of the cinnamon mixture.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have been using the same recipe for my cinnamon rolls for years. I thought I'd try a new recipe and this one sounded good. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The flavor was good, but they came out a little heavier than I would have liked.  If I make them again I will allow the dough to rise once before rolling it out and then let it rise a second time before baking.  I will also roll the dough out to a larger demension, I thought the layers were a little too thick.

I didn't realize just how much work this recipe was going to be.  It took me the better part of the day including the rising time.  I changed the recipe just a tiny bit.  I added about 1/3 cup more flour just so I could get the dough out of the bowl.  It was very sticky!  Once it was floured and everything it was fairly easy to work with.  I didn't have non-flavored dental floss so I floured a good sharp serated bread knife and used that.  It still took a while but it didn't turn out too bad.  I added a bit of nutmeg to the filling and topped all the rolls with a bit of syrup and melted butter before I put them in the oven.  They turned out very good!  I may have also used a bit of extra brown sugar in the middle to make them extra gooey!  The frosting was very nice.  However, I did change that as well.  I added the 8oz cream cheese as other reviewers recommended and I only added 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  The milk and vanilla I just guessed.  Anyway, overall it was a very good recipe.  Very sweet, but very good!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Those of you just trying it...don't give up on the sticky dough!

I just made these tonight and they were delicious!! But I'm definitly going to change it a bit next time. I kneaded the dough for about 8-10 minutes and I left it alone and covered to rise for about 4 hours. They turned out pretty fluffy because of that. But next time I make these I am going to use less brown sugar for the rolls. The icing was pretty good but again a little too sweet for my taste so less sugar next time and definitly more cream cheese. I also added some cardemom along with the cinnamon. :) The dough turned out pretty good for me and it was easy. I just kept adding flour until it was no longer sticky. I will definitly be making these again...and again...

The first time I made this recipe it took me ages and ages but the end result was worth it so i kept making it and now it doesn't take as long and friends and family love them. The only thing is, I use about twice as much flour, but maybe because I live at a high altitude?

these rolls were great. I had to use about a cup and a half more flour though because the dough was just too sticky to roll out. Have to eat these things right out of the oven though because they harden when cooled

This was a good recipe.  I made them for Father's Day and my dad loved them.  He said they competed with his mom's.  I used a cinnamon sugar mixture instead of brown sugar.  Next time I would reduce the butter for spreading on the rolled out dough to 1/4 cup.

My children, dd12 and ds11, made these with a little help. I asked them to cut back on the sugar since the recipe as written is over-the-top sweet! The video makes it look easy and clean--it's not. They were delicious. Ds8 says they taste like store-bought (that was meant to be a compliment!).

I have made this basic recipe several times and have enjoyed the results.  However, I went back and read some of the other reviews and decided to incorporate a few of the suggestions just to see how the rolls would turn out with some slight changes.  I first followed cory's suggestion to first allow the milk, water and butter mixture to cool and then mix in the sugar and yeast and let it stand for 10 minutes (it got all bubbly and frothy) and then I added the rest of the ingredients.  Then I followed mrs.duenes's suggestion of letting the initial dough rest for 10 minutes (for the dough to absorb the flour) before kneading it.  Then I let the dough rise after kneading for two hours and then let it rise for two more hours in the morning before baking it. The results were very moist, fluffy and most decadent cinnamon rolls I have ever made.  Sometimes it pays to try something new.

Me: Beginner baker, first time making these rolls.  A blunder I made: Completed steps 1 and 2 without adding egg! Realized this 10 minutes after placing kneaded dough in warm area to rise. Panicked a little. Quickly went to google for some advice. Read that I can add items before the first rise, so took a chance. Took out my beautifully kneaded dough, added the egg and was left with a wet mess. Kneading the dough at this point was tough, but I managed to work in the egg. Will it work? was my question. After an hour of rising the dough, the dough lump was cohesive and a-ok :) 

I also worried that I rolled out the dough too thin, but read that having many layers are preferable?  

Another thing - I cut down on the sugar/cinnamon mixture. Love that I can control the amount of sugar! 

My cinnamon rolls turned out well. Not too sweet, fluffy and goes great with cold milk.

If you are looking to impress your tastebuds, this is the recipe to use.  I proofed the yeast and followed the instructions with no problems.  I did double the frosting.  These freeze well.  I use 9 x 9 pans and put 4 in each.  If you are not in a hurry, or if you have an errand to run - make up the dough and place in oven to rise.  I made this on Thanksgiving.  We had a party to go to so I made the dough, placed it in the oven, we came home about 3 - 4 hours later, and it was ready and waiting to go -- absolutely the best -- I've made this 3 times now.  Enough to give away to friends and neighbors and enough to freeze for those weekend morning treats.

I this was my 18 year old daughter's first attempt at making homemade cinnamon rolls. She followed the recipe exactly but they didn't come out that well. I did give it three stars because after I notced the yeast was expired, which could have been the proble, but they still should have tasted good. Not sure. We will try again.

This is the version I usually make with one difference. For the topping I take one can of Eagle brand sweetened condensed milk, place opened can into water bath on top of stove and reduce until it reaches a caramel consistancy. Spoon over warm rolls. UNREAL!!!

Had to add around 2.5 cups more flour than recipe stated to get the dough right.  Will definitely do a double rise next time to enhance the flavor.  Will also increase the amount of butter in the filling.  But was very good as well.

These  were probably the best cinnamon rolls I have made. I made 1st panfll and pt the into th oven overnight to rise then baked in the morning.  Only reason for th 4 stars instead of 5 is that I like more of a cinnamon flavor and these were more like caramel rolls to me. 

Th 2nd batch I sliced a bit thinner and have frozen for another time.

These were awesome.  I made half in a thin dark metal 9x13 pan and the others in a glass 9x13 pan.  The ones in the metal pan were perfect!  The ones I made in the glass pan didn't finish cooking on the bottom, not sure why.  But the taste was amazing!  I did make this the night before I wanted them.  I made the dough, roll them up, cut them and stuck them in the pans, then in the morning sat them out, let them rise, and then baked them.  Turned out great!!

It takes some effort to make these, but they are absolutely delicious. I think it takes a bit longer to let them rise than the recipe says though. Also, I used less brown sugar and more cinnamon in the filling the second time I made them, and I was pleased with the results.

Very very good!  I followed the other's advice to make the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night.  It's time consuming, but the recipe is easy to follow.  The results are fabulous!!

These are the first cinnamon rolls I have ever made, and everybody really enjoyed them.  The first time I made them they wouldn't raise until I put them in a warm oven, thanks for that review, and then I thought they were a little tough.  This time, though, I added a tsp. of baking soda-they raised REALLY well.  I do have one question, however, is the dough supposed to be really sticky, or do I need to add more flour?  How sticky, or non-sticky should it be?

This recipe is soooo close to perfect!!! The dough itself is perfection, silky, rises beautifully (you do have to proof the yeast before you add it- for those having a problem with the rising) The dough is something like a donut dough, not yeasty or too bread like, or dry at all, simply beautiful.  The filling to me needs much less sugar, this will also prevent the filling from forming a sticky caramel like crust on the bottom of the rolls- cut your sugar down to 1/2 cup light brown and 1/2 cup white and you should be fine.  I also added extra cinnamon- 4 teaspoons total,  yes you do end up using about 7 to 8 cups of flour but this is typical when kneading any bread.  I used a frosting that you can buy in the supermarket- whipped cream cheesing icing and it was wonderful- not too sweet at all. There rolls were a HUGE hit this Easter and I will be making these very often!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Based on other suggestions, I cut back the sugar in bread part to 1/2 cup, but I don't think it is sweet enough.  I am not a beginner as far as bread, and had difficulty w/ this one.  I followed the recipe as far as just rising the bread once (instead of twice as some did) and then they sat for many, many hours, w/o a lot of rise.  But the rolls do look okay, but they did not rise as big as I thought they should.  Mine were not really moist, so probably baked them too long.  I baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  The filling did run out, but did not stick to my pans (used pyrex, LB pottery, and an alum. pie plate).  I cut back the brown sugar in middle to 1 1/2 cups.  I probably would add a little more cinnamon since don't taste much of it.  Tried cutting w/ floss, but did not go well, used a sharp knife instead. Don't know that I will make again since I struggled so much.  They are good, but not enough for me to rate the amount of work involved.  Taking to church this am and hope all enjoy them.

Delicious! But way too sweet with 200 grams of sugar. I changed it to about 90-100 grams it was much much better!

The rolls are WONDERFUL!! I took the advice of the other posters and halved the sugar in the pastry and in the filling and I doubled the cinnamon as we're addicted in our house... a definite keeper.

Best Cinnamon rolls I have made.  I have tried so many different recipes and this one is the best.  Because the dough is sweet, I only add half of the brown sugar as called for.  Since its just me and my husband at home, these rolls last us for about a week. The problem I have had with other recipes  is that they dry out after the first day.  Not these though.  They are moist from beginning to end.

incredible! I followed the ingredients exactly, but switched up the directions a bit. after shaping the rolls, I stuck them in the fridge overnight. I meant to cook them after rising for about 2 hours, but they ended up rising for almost 6 hours since I was out! afterwards, I cooked them for a little less then 20 minutes. I used one baking stone and one 13x9 pan. The baking stone was fine, but the rolls stuck to the pan, even though I buttered it well.  Still, the rolls were delicious and moist.

Definitely fabulous and decadent.  Hubby wiped out half a batch in 3 days.  Use 8 oz. of cream cheese in the icing and DO NOT use a dark non-stick pan.  I'm not a big fan of sweets so I left 3 rolls un-iced and loved them.  First class recipe!!!!

Bake only 15-18 minutes. My husband says they are better than his mom's. If I can make a homemade something better than his mom, I must be a celebrity chef! I have made this as a 1/4, a 1/2 and a double batch for different occasions and they all turn out perfectly! I also used the sweet-dough recipe for monkey bread and it was delicious!

Really easy and so very tastey.  I used a bit more flour and used more cream cheese in my icing.  I didn't leave over night either but I did let rise for almost 3 hrs.  I ended up with 24 very large and awesome buns.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be keeping this one.

I really enJOYed preparing and baking the rolls. It was much easier in the bread machine on dough cycle. While baking, I used foil to cover the tops so they wouldn't bake too tough/dry! After you bake it, you might see the brown sugar on the bottom of the pan, but the taste of the rolls are still there! They turned out tasty--soft, fluffy, and gooey.  The frosting is amazzzing! Its just perfect! It enhances the taste! Go for it! Have fun!

My first homemade cin rolls and they rocked it!  I halved the recipe and it halved well.  I'm also high altitude and made sugar/dairy subs and it still turned out great. Lots of work, but SO worth it for an occaional treat. Thanks for the recipe! Yum!

This is my first time making cinnamon rolls. However, this does not affect my own judgement with a 'kneadable dough'.    The dough turns out very sticky and unlikely to be kneaded. As such, I add 1 extra cup of flour. It turns out to the hardest bread that we had ever eaten.    For taste wise, it may be too bland for people who love cinnamon. I add double cinnamon as stated.

Made these for Easter brunch, and my family LOVED them!  A few notes:  1) I went with the 3 oz. of cream cheese in the frosting, and it was fine.  Can't imagine almost tripling the amount as some other have! 2) This recipe as written makes 24, and we couldn't eat that many.  So, I baked 12 of them on Easter, and put 12 in pans in the fridge (after I cut them and let them rise an hour).  Just baked the last batch today (4 days after), and they are still amazing!  Definitely will make this again and again...

Best Cinnamon rolls I've mave by far.  A few tweaks to the original... added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp almond extract to dough.  Used KitchenAid to mix dough and it took about 1 cup more, but I added it slowly. It never pulled away from the bowl - was still sticky but I put it on a well floured surface and kneaded 1 min or so and it turned out beautifully. I also let rise 2 hours and they were light and airy! Served at a party with great reviews and people took all the leftovers home.

1st time making cinnamon rolls - they turned out even though we were sure we'd messed them up. We added more flour to dough in mixer, maybe a  little under 3/4 cup extra? Kneaded in the electric mixer w/bread hook for a little over 10 min and let dough rise in the bowl on the counter for 4 hours.  Probably only used 1 1/2 c of brown sugar mixture but did add a little extra cinnamon and some chopped pecans. We rolled them out, had to add  little more flour but not much at all and then baked them for about 16 min. Drizzled w/icing (powdered sugar+milk+vanilla) and we were done! Made two 13x9 in pans + an 8 in square pan + a custard cup!

I think that this recipe would have been great if all of the filling hadn't fallen out of the rolls and then cooked into hard candy on the bottom of the rolls.

These are delicious!  I used 8 oz. cream cheese and an extra half cup or so of confectioners' sugar and a hefty splash of vanilla.  These remind me so much of the ones my grandma made when I was a girl!  Thank you for the recipe.

The dough was really sticky after adding the amount of flour called for in the recipe.  I had read others' reviews that said the dough would be sticky and not to add more flour, but to just work the dough until it wasn't sticky.    After working the dough for 45 minutes, it was still just as sticky/loose.  I added more flour, but then my rolls wouldn't rise.  I let them sit out for a couple of hours in a warm place, and they didn't rise.  All of the filling in the rolls melted out and caramelized in the bottom of the pan during baking.    I would never use this recipe again.

What happened???  I finally asked my friend for this recipe after falling in love with her oh-so-tasty cinnamon rolls.  I tried it, and they did not turn out even close to the same.  I added a little extra flour because the dough was not workable with 6 cups.  I let them bake for a few extra minutes because they were doughy at 25, but then they were overdone.  I also let them sit for 2 hours before baking but they hardly rose.  Any suggestions for making them better next time?!?!  I know they can be yummy, but somehow these were a flop!

These were so yummy.  I made these the night before and them put them in the fridge overnight.  I pulled them out in the morning, let them rise for about an hour and a half, them baked.  So good!  Although, it made a lot!  I ended up sending one of the pans to my neighbor.  My husband is starting to complain about me fattening him up.

These are great. The dough was easy to work.  I allowed for a first rise in the bowl, then I formed the rolls and put them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning the got their second rise and it was perfect!

Just like the ones my mother made. So perfect!  I replaced the water with milk and just threw all the ingredients in my brradmaker on the dough setting. Also for the filling I used half white and half brown sugar so it has a less gooey more crispy effect. So delicious!

These are absolutely Cinnabon quality!! I kept to the recipe except I used 2 tsp. yeast and after cutting them into rolls and putting them on a cookie sheet, I cover with wax paper and let it rise overnight. In the morning you could smell the dough and yeast and they were big fat buns! They came out amazing!!!! The BEST recipe ever!!

First Cinnamon Roll recipes I have ever got to turn out. Love them! Remind me of school lunch rolls. I pile them all on one cookie sheet nice and snug. Also to quicken the rising process I ALWAYS put a hot pad (the medical kind) under the pan while rising....it's genius!

I have been searching for a cinnamon roll recipe that  would be nice and fluffy and delicious....this one definitely is!  The dough is sweet and yummy.  Unfortunately I placed the rolls on a baking sheet that was too big and they didn't even touch when cooking.  I would recommend that you make sure the rolls are touching after they rise so you will have soft delicious rolls.

Great recipe. This is my first time making Cinnamon rolls from scratch and i think this recipe is pretty forgiving. I used a stand mixer but the more I kneaded it in the mixer the stickier it got so I added almost another full cup of flour. I thought I would end up with hard bricks but i didn't :-) I only let them rise once after cutting and placing in the pan but i made sure it was a 2 hour rise. worked PERFECTLY. fluffy, soft cinnamon rolls. I'm pretty proud of myself :-)

Not sure what i did wrong but i noticed alot of people said they let the dough rise before they added (butter, cinnnamon etc) i did as the directions said and they didn't rise much but the cinnamon etc was melting all over the pans?? i cooked them and they tasted ok(weren't all gooey inside(more hard inside) and the taste was ok(i think most of the flavoring leaked out.I'm sure this is a good recipe and this is my 1st time trying the rolls(and new to baking) so i'm sure it was just me. Thank you.

OMG!  It is a recipe like this that tells me baking is extremely fun and rewarding!  This is my first time making any sort of bread dough, or kneading it for that matter!  These turned out amazingly well for a first timer.  I listened to a few reviews such as knead it longer than 8 mins ( I kneaded it for 30 min ) and let it rise for 2 hrs.  The dough came out very fluffy and soft and slightly gooey in the middle.  I only baked mine ( 8 in a pan ) for roughly 15 mins, bc I didn`t want them overcooked.  My boyfriend loved them so much that he ate 5 within 20 mins!

First thing I ever made from scratch and it was delicious!  I did just use 4oz. cream cheese for frosting as some of family isn't big on the taste of it, but they didn't even care, they loved 'em.  So proud of how they came out and glad the recipe was well written. Thanks!  Also, a tip for those having a hard time with the dough rising, make sure you add the ingredients in order because the yeast is activated by warm liquid and then the sugar feeds the yeast which is a fungus, so the feeding with sugar causes a byproduct of carbon dioxide which raises the bread.  Also, I let it rise two hours before baking instead of the prescribed one, to make extra fluffy. Yum!

I thought this recipe was great.  It was my first time making cinnamon rolls and they turned out SOOO good.  Some reviews say to add flour, I can see why you would think to add flour because the dough is a little sticky when it's done. You don't need to add more flour you just need to keep covering the dough in flour when you are kneading it so that it doesn't stick to your hands, doing this adds flour to the dough in itself. Also I don't see how some people think this tastes like biscuits, it dosn't taste at all like biscuits, it tastes like the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had in my life.  Definitely use 8 ounces of cream cheese for the frosting, and I put pecans and raisins in the filling, too.

After a second attempt at this recipe... I was REAllY HAPPY and impressed.
The first time I made them the dough turned out great.I didnt need to add extra flour.What I did Then I had'nt read all the reviews that had recommended to let the rolls rise for a good amount of time. So I just threw them in the oven and my cinnabuns cam out and were a cinnamess:(
 Well I had to attempt this recipe again and I did and was glad I did.Definetly  let them rise for a good 2-3 hours after they have been rolled and before for a 1/2hr.They are much more fluffier that way.
Dental floss is great to cut them with.Great tip thanx. And I also used the "creamcheese icing II" recipe on this site. Wanted more creamcheese taste. Overall,They were amazing. My family luved them and it's a keeper.UPDATE..01/11/11
So i've been making this for a few years no and i've experimented more with it... I add 3 eggs now to give the dough more richness and flavour. and the sugar and cinnamon mix..i add the butter to it to make it a paste and spread evenly on the dough....this recipe rocks... I get asked to make it all the time.. request after request... i have never had leftovers they get devoured everytime.

THe more thet rise the better.... I always let the dough rise after kneading it for at least an hr. and when they are rolls let rise till doubled in size. then bake result: light and fluffy.

k i'm not gonna lie, i totally did my own thing for the dough.  but i'm rating the topping a 5-- it's the best icing i've ever had, although i used 200 g of cream cheese (i think about 8 oz) and a full teaspoon of vanilla-- really good though, everyone loved it!  i also followed another person's suggestion and poured melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar over the rolls before baking and they turned out all the better!  another alteration that i made (to make the dough less dense) is i used about 2 parts all-purpose flour and 1 part self-rising flour in addition to the yeast (with a tsp. of honey to feed it) and let it rise 4 hours-- the dough was very fluffy and i had enough to make about 20 rolls.  really awesome cinnamon rolls!! and even better icing!!

These weren't very good at all. Like a previous reviewer noted, they taste more like biscuits with a little sugar. 
Also, they ended up really hard shortly after cooling. We were really disappointed. Thanks anyway, though.

Nobody can resist the cinnamon punch delivered by these rolls.  Making them the night before is even better.

Great cinnamon rolls, though not as gooey as I like mine. Excellent cream cheese icing, as long as you use one 8oz package of cream cheese (is the 3oz package a typo?).

These turned out well, but didn't raise because I think I killed the yeast with the warm milk mixture. I also had to use MORE FLOUR; about a cup or more because the dough was all sticky and impossible to roll out.

Great base recipe. I ran out of AP flour, substituted whole wheat. Hubby is crazy for pecans, I chopped about a cup of leftover- from- Christmas candies pecans and sprinkled them on half in addition to the brown sugar mix. I went with the two hour rise, fluffy and yummy.

Wow, we loved these!  I did everything to the T, got them in baking dishes and refrigerated overnight like suggested.  My rolls did not rise one bit overnight, which worried me.  My yeast was brand new, so I'm not sure what happened?  But once I got them in the oven they got HUGE!!  So I would say it was a success :)  They tasted wonderful as well and the whole family gave them a thumbs up!

I made these yummy cinnamon rolls using the exact recipe so I could see what I thought might need to be tweeked. I can't think of anything I would do different except maybe roll them out a bit thinner. They were just delicious. Shared with the neighbors on both sides of us and they loved them as well. Going to try another batch for Christmas morning.....this time rolling out a bit thinner. Won't be buying store cinnamon rolls anymore!

These were easy to make although very messy and time consuming. The cream cheese icing in my opinion was too much. I think these would be excellent with a basic icing instead. Otherwise, delicious, especially because the filing leaked out and formed a caramel glaze on the bottoms. I recommend using a cookie sheet instead of 9x13 pan, since they get pretty big.

Ten stars!!!!!!
One addition though, I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2tsp of cinnamon to flour.  As suggested by another review posted. Thanks.

I melted the butter on low heat with the milk till the butter melted. Let it cool down to lukewarm. Then I proofed the yeast in 1 cup of lukewarm water and 1 Tablespoon of the sugar. Then I put the milk/butter, white sugar, salt, eggs (slightly beaten), then the 2 cups of flour with the yeast mixture on top in my kitchen aid stand mixer bowl. I then set the timer for 10 min. Using the dough hook and speed 2 adding 1/2 cup of flour at a time. Also used King Arthur flour.  Also let the dough rise 2 x's

This recipe is fantastic! The first time I made these, very thing was great excepting was dry and it was because I didn't use all of the brown sugar mixture because I thought it was way to much so don't be overwhelmed by all the brown sugar because using less won't give much taste. Other than that the bread was fluffy, and the frosting was delicious. This is my favourite recipe for making cinnamon rolls and the great thing also is that it's easy for any age. Im almost 12 and this was super easy for someone like me. So I highly recomend this recipe to anyone!

I only made 1/2 the recipe to make 1 pan. Put in fridge the night before, took out of oven in the morning, and allowed to rise for 1 hour. It rose even more compared to the AR video. The icing tasted just right but would have to agree with other reviewers to use the whole block of cream cheese for 2 pans. Tasted great but still prefer cinnamon rolls with nuts.

This recipe turned out great cinnamon rolls. Makes 24 full size rolls - you might want to reduce accordingly. I made the full recipe but ended up using only half the recommended quantity of cinnamon and brown sugar; that's all that would fit on the rolled out dough. Next time I plan to double the width of each rolled out portion (to 12 x 18 instead of 12 x 9, but only half the thickness) and roll the 12" side inwards(as before). That would accommodate the full measure of cinnamon and brown sugar. You may need more butter if you do that. Next time I'll cool the milk mixture to 110F and add the yeast. Also, I'll add a bit more flour than was called for before turning the dough out to knead. Mine was too sticky. Kneading more flour in at that point was both time consuming and messy. I may also do it in smaller batches in a food processor. But you may correctly infer from all of my "next times" that I plan to make this recipe on a regular basis. It's a winner. :)

I really wish I would have trusted my instincts on this one. I followed the recipe exactly, despite the lack of yeast-proofing and warm liquids. I also ran into the issue of the dough being like a gooey paste and having to add a lot more flour than called for. I was making them ahead, so I put them into the refrigerator at the point specified in the video, despite the lack of a "first rise"......Needless to say, the rolls didn't rise, even a little. I'm still going to put them in the oven, but I'm not at all excited about it. Oh, well. Live and learn.

Ok,I realized that since I use this recipe often with a few changes I should write a review.We LOVE these!! I have five children and these are the all time request.i use the review that GCRIM wrote and rise them for 3 hrs but the difference that I do is I put them on the preheated oven to rise with a towel over all of the cookie sheets together ...they get just enough heat this way. I rotate them periodically to make sure that the ones that are further way from the oven vent get time closer.This makes all of the rolls grand sized.Warning!!! make sure that the rolls are close to  touching if not as the rise they will loose all shape and burn.meaning make them no more than 2 inches apart.Oh if you want a completely square dough to work with I found it really easy to do with a pizza cutter to cut the edges to make a square (rectangle)

Made these today.. I just wanted something sweet and didn't have fruit or chocolate in the house.. they are amazing!  I did probably add a cup and half more of flour while kneading, then I let it rest in a buttered bowl for 40-50 min before portioning and let it rise another hour. I had to use two seperate casserole dishes. Do be careful because one I have is brown and one is clear. The clear one cooked faster..

I used egg yolks instead of whole eggs and it came out much more airy than cakey than the first time i tried them.
instead of using a cream cheese frosting i used a simple butter frosting. 
they came out fantastic, my boyfriend enjoyed them very much!

I messed up the dough somehow. Its all sticky and not rolling into the perfect bun shaped as in the video. It flattens, and sticks to my hand. I followed the recipe required for 6servings. I have currently placed the dough in the fridge.

I am an experienced baker and something about these just weren't right. I halved the recipe.
1. I know I didn't kill my yeast because it was active before I added my flour but the dough didn't rise AT ALL. 
2. After I added all the flour it wasn't reall dough, it was batter. So I added an extra half cup.
3. I let rise for an hour between kneading and rolling out. No rise. None.
4 I rolled it out and cut the rolls. And let rise for an hour. No rise.
5. I baked them. They rose a little but really they came out like little bricks.
I gave the recipe 2 stars because they tasted fine but the texture was just awful, not at all what a sweet bread should be. Bad recipe.

Great Recipe.  I also added 3 teaspoons baking powder since the yeast that I have used in the past has not always worked. They rose to a good level and were really fluffy. I also ran out of icing sugar and I replaced with equal amount of custard powder. It actually made them less sweet and very tasty. I added just a hint of sugar and they turned out great. I will be making them again!! :)

This recipe produced some great rolls.  The dough was a little sloppy, so I was nervous. However, the rolls turned out great.  

I did a few changes... a few that paid off and some that I regret.  For the good changes - the butter that I spread on the dough seemed excessive, so I used a bit less than the full amount and I did the same with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  I used the leftovers to rub or sprinkle on the outside of the roll. It caramelized nicely.  I am also glad that I took the advice of the other reviewers about letting the rolls sit for more than an hour.  This, indeed, did produce giant, yummy, fluffy rolls. 

The regretful change that I made was to the icing (per a few suggestions from other reviewers).  The changes made it into a cupcake icing, not a roll icing.  Next time, I will follow the original recipe for icing.

I let the yeast activate in the warm sugar milk for about 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  Also, used the stand mixer to "knead" for 8minutes or so, and hand kneaded for a minute or two.  Refrigerated prepared rolls overnight, and the next morning let rise for approx 1 hour before baking.  They turned out great!

Very easy to make, everyone loved them. For some reason, mine weren't rising well, so I left them overnight on the kitchen counter and they were perfect in the morning and ready to bake. This is the only recipe I have ever tried, and I don't feel I will need another :)

They were delicious, with one exception:  Some of the bottoms and sides were burnt, probably because of my electric oven.  (I left it in the least amount of time because of my oven.)  The next time I will leave them in the oven for 15 minutes instead of 20.  It was hard rolling the dough into a rectangle, but I did my best.  Also, it took longer than an hour for the buns to rise.  They only started to rise when I sat them on a warm stove of 250 degrees.  My icing came out perfect as well.  My family enjoyed them though.  And those who had burnt buns, ate around it.  Definitely will try again and will try Cinnamon Rolls III.

Best Cinnamon roll recipe ever! I've made cinnamon rolls in the past using other recipes and they never turned out quite right. I was looking for a really fattening and decadent recipe, similar to Cinnabon, when I found this one. I've used this recipe twice and both times they turned out perfect. My family loves loves loves them! They are definitely good enough to share with others. Another great thing about this recipe is it could easily be changed a bit by adding raisins or nuts. I will be baking these again in the near future. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Maybe I did it wrong, but the bread tasted like.. I dunno, really doughy bread. Not at all like what I expected (compared to canned rolls). Did I not let it rise enough, or what? I might try it again sometime, in a much smaller batch, because I really don't like what I made at all :(

I took a chance on this recipe after reading the reviews.  I wanted a recipe I could make the night before and then bake in the morning. These were perfect.  I made the rolls Christmas Eve, covered the pan with plastic wrap, and refrigerated.  I pulled them out the next morning and let them come to room temperature and rise for about an hour.  The only change I made was to the filling.  I mixed 1 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup softened butter.  I didn't have time to make the frosting, but these rolls were so good they didn't need it.

These were so very yummy!  This was the first time I've ever tried to make cinnamon rolls and I for my first time I think I picked a winner of a recipe!  For my oven I should have cooked these at  only 350 degrees and for probably 18-20 minutes.  I cooked at 375 for 20 minutes and they did get a little too done, but they were still so good.  I did cut the recipes in half so I only made 12 rolls but I kept the recipe for the icing the same.  We love a lot of icing on our cinnamon rolls!

These were awesome!!!!!!!!!! Thank you for the recipe. My family couldn't believe that i made them  myself. The frosting is awesome as well. Because of my condition i will use less sugar or try to make them with splenda, for myself anyway. So from my family you get two thumbs up for this.

Not great. They looked like cinnamon rolls when I put them in the oven and even when I took them out, but all I got was tantamount of hardtack with sugar inside.

Halved it, let it rise, then was too lazy to roll it out, so put it in the fridge till morning.  In the am, rolled it out, but in the butter mixture, cut, let rise again and baked.  Delicious

These are amazing! They are light and fluffy, with a good, yeasty roll flavor. The only change I made was to have them rise for 2 hrs before rolling them out, then they rose for an additional hour after I made them into rolls. Definitely my new favorite recipe!

I first made these strictly following the recipe posted...they didn't rise and were basically doughy. Then I used Sarah Jo's recipe. I proofed the yeast first (about 10-15 min or until i saw it bubbling)and then added milk/butter mixture. I made a half batch and it turned out AMAZING!!!! I added the milk/butter to the yeast and added flour to make dough...i cover dough with damp cloth and sat on heating pad on med setting for 2 hours and it rose beautifully. I also used half the amount of brown sugar suggested and usual amount of cinnamon. I spread butter then put the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture in a sifter and spread so they were very even and sprinkled/dusted. Cut and placed in glass baking dish (pie plates) and sat back on heating pad and let rise even further. Baked for 25 minutes, They turned out PERFECTLY. Again, I followed Sarah Jo's review and put my own tweak in and they are great.

I made these recently and they turned out amazing. Although I used a different recipe for the frosting.

1/2 cupButter
8 oz.cream cheese; softened
1 tsp.Vanilla
and I think 2 or 3 cups of Powdered sugar, sorry I forgot.

I shared them with my room mates, and sister and nieces and nephews, they were a huge hit with everyone.

These were fantastic! First time making cinnamon rolls but def not my last! Followed some of the feedback and cut the sugar in half and doubled the cinnamon. Also did my dough the night before and allowed it to rest in the pan.  Just baked it off in the morning and they were absolutely FABULOUS!

These rolls did not rise at all so the rolls were very dense. They tasted good but if the dough would have risen it would have been much better.

I cannot believe how easy this was, I actually impressed myself. The first time I made it, it was a success, a huge hit! I made this for a treat for my son's 7th birthday party, let me tell you, it was the hit of the party. Now I have requests for other birthdays, communions, etc. The recipe is true to itself, try it...your family will thank you!

Very quick and easy recipe.  I have made them twice now and they have come out amazing.  The dough is a excellent consistency.  I have tried a couple different recipes but this one by far is my favorite.

So Easy and So Good!  I added half whole wheat pastery flour and they were still very good - it didn't make them dry.  Highly recommend this bakers of all abilities.

Delicious! Although this was long and complicated it was totally worth it! I halved the recipe. I made these last night and let them rise over night. They weren't as massive as I thought they were going to be. I took another reviewers advice and used a whole package of cream cheese and that worked well! I didn't have any confectioners sugar so I used white sugar for that and I couldn't taste anything wrong with that! It was difficult to roll the dough into a square. It kept turning into an oval. Two words of advice, use water to seal the seam in the cinnamon rolls, I didn't and a couple of them were falling apart in the oven. Make sure when you cook them that they are close together, this makes the edges soft! This recipe is definetly a keeper! Beware these are very sugary so you can only eat 1 and 1/2 at the max! Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding recipe. Anyone looking for a very good, well tested & well designed recipe for cinnamon rolls is in the right place here. I've printed it out and pasted it to 4x6 cards to use again.

I've been making this recipe for years.  They turn out perfect every time! They do take at least 2 hrs from start to finish.  But any really good cinnamon roll recipe requires an hour for the dough to rise anyway. They are a labor of love but so yummy!!

These were delicious!  And really not that difficult to make. Only thing I ran into was it took my rolls longer than an hour to rise to double-ish. (more like 2-3 hours)

Winner! Everyone are in love with these. I used the tip to make the paste of karo syrup, brown sugar and butter paste on top of rolls before you put them in the oven. It gives almost a carmalized glaze on it. Grestness with the delicious cream cheese frosting. I added an extra 4 oz to mine for richness.

Definitely need to let rise for about 5 hours.  Seriously.  These are absolutely to die for.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese and followed the rest of the recommendations for the frosting and it was perfect.  Will use this recipe everytime I make cinnamon rolls!!!!!

The dough is perfect! Love it! Did everything as indicated, only used fresh yeast. I've never used the dry kind so I deceided to stick with what I know. Rose for 3.5 hours (I went for a walk) and when rolled and cut, some 2.5 hours and they're double in size. I will try leaving them over night next time, just to see the difference ;)
Thank you, I love it!

amazingly delish!  I used all wheat flour and they where so ooey gooey and awesome.  I did need to let them raise for much longer than called for but no big deal.  I like the idea of doing them the night before for breakfast.  That will be the plan next time.

This is by far the best recipe I have ever tried for cinnamon rolls. It is easy to make and the finished product is rich tasting, moist, and fluffy. My family prefers bit more cinnamon but that didn't stop them from eating the rolls. I did let them raise for about 3 hours though. Thanks for the great recipe!

My step dad would make his cinnamon rolls every Christmas and they were good but this recipes is the bomb. I read all the reviews and the first time didn't put the extra cup of flour but the second time I added the extra cup of flour and my husband said they were even better than the first time. Live in Housto and have our on pecan trees so added raisins and pecans and they couldn't taste any better. Thanks for sharing your recie all my neighbors love me for sharing such good cinnamons rolls.

i am in the process of making these and I just added about 7 cups of flour. WHY?? It was soo sticky I would of had to POUR them out of the bowl after kneading it for 10 minutes in my kitchen aide. I am so excited to see if these are yummy. I am taking the advice of letting them rise for 2 hours. I have 1 hour and 55 minutes left to find out what happens!!!!

This turned out really good! I was afraid of how they would come out of the oven but they were perfect. Something I would do the next time: Add more cinnamon and a little bit less sugar, they turned out to be too sugary and not very cinnamon. Also, I added cinnamon to the frosting and it turned out to be waaaay better. I loved them!

These were pretty good. I didn't exactly follow the recipe for the icing (I'm in a different country) but I did for the rolls and I think the butter I used might have had a funny taste. but overall they were really good. Maybe a little too sweet, but good! My Egyptian friends enjoyed them!

Well here's a variation - I didn't have enough flour in the end and it was pouring down rain here in Buenos Aires.  So I used what I had -    masa for corn tortillas (!) And they still came out fine - didn't rise as much (claro) but were still really good

I picked this recipe because it was simple and didn't have any unusual ingredients.  They turned out great.  Some say the dough was sticky and I did notice it was "wet" in the bread machine, but after the first rise, it was fine.  Here in Southern California I did notice that I have to either add yeast or really put any bread dough in a very warm place (like on the stove while the oven is open and on very low).  I guess if you do not bake much you wouldn't know that in some areas dough just does not rise as well.  Also I did not make the frosting part it was great without it.  The butter and cinnamon that melted to the bottom made them even better.

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with a sticky mess.  I tried adding additional flour like other reviewers had suggested and it just got tougher and stickier.  I will be looking for another cinnamon roll recipe after this disaster.

These were a big hit at my office.  This was my first try at yeast dough myself and it turned out great.  I added an extra cup of flour as a couple of reviews suggested, next time I'll try without the extra cup.  Used my stand mixer to need it.  Dough was very nice to work with.  Also for the frosting I added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of the 3 oz in the original and the consistency was good.

Excellent!  This was the first time I have made cinnamon rolls ever and they turned out great!  I made them the night before and the next morning let them rise for 1 hour on top of the hot stove. Then put them in the oven.  My husband and kids loved them!  Warning...you'll only want ONE!  I ate two and my belly was stuffed!  Thanks so much!

I'm sure these would have been amazing, but I baked them for only the minimum time suggested and they were WAAY over baked.  I know that my oven temp is fine so not sure what happened there...they looked perfect before i stuck them in the oven!  I'll definitely try them again!

These were delicious but my dough barely rose and I let it sit for a few hours.  Had it risen, it would have  been better.  I'd definitely try it again, though.

I have searched for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe for a long time, and this one is my keeper!!!  Made them on Christmas morning and will continue this tradition.  Very soft dough - not tough or dry at all.  I will use light brown sugar next time instead of dark, however.

I did not care for this recipe. Didn't rise after a few hours and the rolls were hard, flat, and dry. Followed directions to a T!

Instead of  using an icing with cream cheese i used simple glaze icing, using icing sugar, a few tablespoons of really hot milk , a tablespoon of soft butter, and vanilla essence..mix them well till very smooth and coat the rolls while they are still warm...

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever.  I have made them 5 times now.  It takes some practice to work with the dough, as it is sticky.  However, it is supposed to be sticky because that is how sweet breads are.  The trick is to work in the right amount of flour while kneeding on a floured surface.  Try to add the least amount of flour as you can and do not overwork.  This will result in a better cinnamon roll (not tough or too dense).  Hope that helps!

These are the first cinnamon rolls I've ever made from scratch and loved them! I made them the night prier and cooked them in the morning... Only flaws in recipe were that to let the yeast rise at least 3 hours, for the filling add more cinnamon and butter (so its "gooey"er), and bake no longer than 20 min.  I will probably use this recipe again...but I froze half the dough so I don't much have an option.  Thank for the recipe! The family loved them!

These Cinnamon Rolls were worth the work and time to prepar. I'm not much of a baker, the instructions were easy to follow. My wife and  I just loved these CInnamon rolls I,ll be making them again.

Very sticky dough - when i made these into rolls finally  i put on cookie sheet - and they spilled onto oven - they needed to rise and recipe does not call for the dough to rise. I  had to scoop the mess onto a  cake pan and cook like a cake instead of rolls. I will probably not be making these again -tasted good.

First time ever making Cinnamon rolls.  These turned out great.  I made them gluten free by using Jules Gluten Free All Purpose flour.  The only adjustment I had to make was adding one extra cup of flour.

OMG these are sooo good. I just took them out the oven and I'm eating one right now!! This is the perfect cinnamon roll. Really soft and moist. They are Perfect even without the frosting. I used a different recipe a few weeks ago and they were terribly dry, so for fear of a repeat, the only thing i changed here was cook time. i baked em up for 18 minutes at 175C. Can i say one more time that these are perfect?

This was my first time ever cooking with yeast and boy was it easier than I thought it would be! I don't know why I was so intimidated by it. I halved the recipe and ended up using about 4 cups of flour, maybe because it is humid where I live? I also let the dough rise in a greased glass bowl, on top of the oven which was turned on and under a warm damp cloth, for about 1 1/2 hours after the dough was first mixed. Rolled the dough out very easily and filled, rolled up and cut into 12 rolls. The cream cheese icing adds a special touch to these. I will be making this again and again, what a great treat and they smelled SO good while baking! Took exactly 20 minutes to bake. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I just made these this morning, they came out well however I think I did something wrong because they needed more bake time than 25 minutes. They were golden brown but still doughy so I cover then and put them back in the oven for a while. They taste great, I didn't make the icing though...maybe next time.

Excellent recipe. I would let them rise more than an hour, mine turned out a little more dense than I would have liked. I haven't even tried the frosting recipe, it is so good without!

WOW!!! These cinnamon rolls smell as good as they taste. For a first-timer, these took a lot of effort to make. However, they are well worth it. Keeping the rolls close packed in the pan helps to keep them moist. Also, mine baked in only about 15 minutes. I will be making these again.

These are incredible. The only difference I made is that I had to run out before I finished prepping them, so I kneaded the dough and then put it in a bowl to rise, so essentially it rose twice. My husband said that you can't tell the difference between these and Cinnabon and that I had to keep the recipe. Amazing!!!

This is a very good recipe.  It was fast and simple.  I followed the directions exactly (aside from substituting the white sugar since I ran out!) and they turned out exactly right.  I was concerned reading other reviews that there should have been a proofing of the yeast and the dough should have been allowed to rest.  I didn't do either of these things, and that didn't seem to be a problem. Don't worry if they don't rise all the way. They plump up in the oven.  Only problem is I found them very rich and very big!  Next time, I would roll the rectangularish dough horizontally so I would have more, but they each would be smaller.  As they are, these are the size of grapefruits!  Be careful not to water down the icing too much with milk.  Mine would've been better if I hadn't added so much.

Wow!  I made this Christmas Eve and baked them for Christmas breakfast and they were an absolute HIT!!  Soooooo goood!  The icing wasn't too sweet, the dough was perfect and they lookd beautiful out of the oven!  I do like a sweeter filling so I did add a little more brown sugar than what was called for.

These were sooo good. My family thought I had some sort of magical powers (TeeHeeHee!). I made 1/2 the recipe and made 4 huge cinnamon rolls instead of 12. Just cover with foil for first 15 minutes and add 5-10 min to cooking to so they get cooked in the middle.

I liked the texture of this cinnamon roll.  they came out very fluffy and soft.  I will make these again, but I will use more brown sugar, as they didn't seem to have a very sweet flavor, except for the icing(which was excellent by the way).  They were very easy to make the night before, too.

made 1/2 sheet pan of these and took them to work.  All but three were gone and we are a small office.  Everyone raved about how good they were.  People from downstair were even coming up to sample them.  I did change the amount of cream cheese in the frosting as others suggested.

I made this today using half of the recipe. However, I had to add 200g extra flour as the dough was very very sticky to knead. Thanks to other reviewers' advise, I let the dough rise for 2 hours after kneading and the rolls were very soft and fluffy. The cinnamon taste was not strong enough for me and it was too sweet. I did not add the frosting. Anyway, the sweetness was more than enough. Next time, I would double the amount of ground cinnamon and reduce the amount of brown sugar.

It took me a total of 2 hours, from start to finished-cooking, not long at all. And they were warm, to melt some butter on top. Thank you Ms. Meyers!

These are perfect as is.  They taste just like Cinnabon.  I usually make them the day before and refrigerate them.  I let them rise for about 45 minutes in an oven that was heated to warm and then turned off.  Great recipe!

Wow. This is so wonderfully easy and tastes great. Tried this on christmas morn and what a hit. Will be making this often - my hubby, kids and the grandparents loved it even the neighbours who popped in loved it. I made this up the night before and like someone mentioned to put in the fridge, then take out on the morn to rise and bake and then ice. My family arose christmas morn to a delicious smell. Well Done this recipe is the best! Tanks for sharing.

If you use margarine to spread on the dough before spreading the cinnamon and brown sugar, it will not all melt to the bottom of the pan... it has a higher melting point than butter. Still use butter when making the dough.

I thought these were very good cinnamon rolls. It seemed like there was way too much brown sugar-cinnamon filling. The first pan I really put alot of the filling in, they were a little hard to roll. The next pan I didn't use as much filling. Go ahead and pack them with up, the overfilled ones were fantastic. They were much better than the ones I scrimped on. I will definitely make them again.

My first attempt at cinnamon rolls.  Flavor wise they were wonderful. They weren't as fluffy as I would have liked but I know that was my fault not the recipe. I kneaded to much flour in. I will try again..as they say practice makes perfect :)

Very good cinnamon roll recipe. Here's how I made it extra amazing:

1. use 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 all purpose

2. after mixing and kneading the dough, let it sit and rise overnight in the fridge (no need to let it rise again in the morning)

3. cut up candied/crystallized ginger into small pieces and sprinkle on the top of the rolls before putting into the oven

These rolls were really yummy!I had to put in extra flour because I had some difficulty rolling  it but it was worth it.The frosting was really good too but I used 8 ounces of cream cheese as others suggested and I used a little more milk to make it more runny.This is a great recipe!

Ok, so this review is long past due. I made these for some family and close friends of ours for Christmas day breakfasts. I made the day before and didn't bake them just covered and placed in the refrigerator. I premade the frosting and put into cups with lids. I just made little tags with the directions on how to cook them and placed on the tin they were in (I made sure that they could be cooked in whatever they were placed in after I cut them. We took them to the houses on Christmas eve. Everyone absolutely loved them!

wonderful. I tried this one because i did not have any cake mix to use for my other recipe. theese are actually better. i did my own thing for the frosting and filling, but the dough is really wonderful, after adding more flour, and letting them raise for an hour and a half.

Awesome!!!! I loved this rolls and all my family raved about them. This is my first time baking/trying cinnamon rolls since they're not a traditional treat here in my country, but i'm sooooo glad i gave them a try. I rated this just 4* because i had some "problems" making the dough. I didn't add all the liquids the recipe called for, and even after that i had to add more flour because my dough was extremely sticky. Kneaded for about 10 min, and then let the rolls rise for about 2 hours totally covered with a cloth and a blanket. Warmed the milk and the sugar together, and also prefered to add the milk mixture and the flour gradually, little by little, so you make sure you have enough flour for all the liquids that are requested in the recipe. Brushed my rolls with butter before baking as others said. Omg, they're so fluffy and rich. Definitely a keeper!  PD: I made this recipe 2 years ago for the first time (7/22/2007), and it's so versatile!! I love it! You can change the filling with great results (chocolate chips, nuts, jams,etc), try different shapes and this dough also makes a mean brioche. My last adventure was making little buns filled with vanilla custard, sooo good!!!! Usually, i knead in the evening, let the dough rise for a couple of hours, then shape the rolls/buns/whatever I'm craving for at that moment, and let them rise overnight. This way you'll get fluffier rolls and a delicious breakfast. All i can say i thank you!!

They turned out pretty good, I let the dough rise for an hour before rolling out, and let them rise overnight after slicing the rounds. Added half a teaspoon of nutmeg to the brown suger mixture, and I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.

I think it would help if you let the dough sit for a little while after kneading to rise for a bit.  I stuck with the instructions in this recipe so I didnt do this and after an hour went by, they barely rose at all.  I kept them in a pretty warm spot though and after another hour or 2 they had risen to the right size.  Before I put them in the oven, I brushed them with some melted butter, cinnamon, and a little bit of cloves.  I also put some nutmeg in the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on the inside. (by the way, remember to leave a border when putting the mixture on, otherwise you won't be able to seal it) They came out great, nice and fluffy!  I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top of the icing too.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for halving it. The taste is worth 5 stars but I'm a little disappointed in the texture--not as light as I'd thought they would be, in fact, pretty dense. I should have read the reviews before I made them, because now I see that others had some of the problems that I had (needing to add more flour because the dough was so sticky, and the rolls not rising enough--after an hour and a bit I swear they had not risen at all, but I put them in the oven anyway). They did rise some when baked. I thought maybe I hadn't used enough yeast (I live in Spain and I don't know if the yeast here--little pressed cubes--is the same as what the recipe calls for). In any case, next time (there will definitely have to be a next time, because my husband loves them) I will try adding a little more yeast to see what happens.

I loved the cinamon roll recipe, but the frosting was lacking.  Instead, I used twice as much cream cheese and was much happier.

First time using this recipe.  Came out delicous.  However, I had to use more flour than what the recipe ask, probably cause I live high altitude.  The frosting, I change it al ittle.  I added only 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspon of powdered sugar instead of what the recipe called for.  I read other reviews and they added 8 oz of cream cheese and  knew I didn't need to add that much, because I would end up too much icing.  It came out perfect consistency not too sweet.  I poured over hot cinnamon rolls and let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.  It tastes just right.  Hopefully, it helped.

I was less than impressed with this cinnamon roll recipe.  The dough did not rise up like I was expecting, which very well could have been something I did, but besides that the rolls seemed rather bland.

Snaps for Pat! This is the third cinnamon roll recipe I've tried and its true, third times the charm. This rivals any mall recipe and I can have them any time I want. They're moist and gooey with enough filling to satisfy any sweet tooth. A truly spectacular recipe my whole family loved. Thanks!!!

The rolls themselves are the best.  I believe I didn't roll the dough tight enough, most of the brown sugar filling ran out the bottom.  My filling also was a bit too thick and didn't spread well. What ran out became hard like candy after it cooled. Also the icing was not what I expected but was ok.  I will make these rolls again but will try another filling and icing.  I give these rolls a thumbs up !

Wow!My first attempt at ever making these rolls. My family just raved. I had no problem weith them being dry.
The icing however, was a problem. I used a whole brick of cream cheese and it was still way to sweet and it never got to a spreading consistensy.Besides that, my family loved them...

I was a little intimidated at the thought of making these since I know it usually wrecks the whole kitchen when you have to knead bread, but these were very easy.  I took them to work for a meeting and everyone loved them.  They were gone in no time while everyone else's store bought cinnamon rolls were left on the table.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are very good as overnight rolls!  I wasn't sure about omitting the first rising, but they turned out fine.  I set them out of the fridge a couple of hours before baking in the morning, so they could rise.  The texture was good, and the butter-cinnamon mixture had oozed out of the rolls a little bit to make them nice and sticky when turned out of the pan, but not too gooey.  I used a plain powdered sugar glaze, and they were wonderful.

These cinnamon rolls are so tender and delicious.  The frosting is ok, but not a whole lot of cream cheese flavor.  Maybe because I used low fat cream cheese.  I used my kitchen-aid mixer and dough hook, these are VERY easy to make!!

My rolls did not rise much. They tasted wonderful, although a little dense.  The butter & sugar mixture could easily be doubled for extra yummy goo. I will try this again, but maybe with the "Sweet Dinner Rolls" recipe as dough. (Try those!)

I thought these were very good.  You do need to add a lot more flour than the recipe calls for to keep the dough from sticking to everything during the kneading process.

These were so wonderful!  My husband and I made them together for a Mother's Day treat.  Neither of us had really done cinnamon rolls before, and I was a little nervous--even when we took them out of the oven.  But they weren't crispy or dry, just perfectly soft and delicious.  We even added mini chocolate chips in one pan (my hubby's favorite).  Excellent!

Yummo! Best cinnamon roll recipe I've tried! Only a couple of changes-- doubled yeast and added to warm milk/water. Let it sit while put together dry ingrediants. Also, didnt have a whole cup of white sugar, so used about 2/3 cup, still turned out perfect!

These were very easy to make.  However, I like the "Grands" size cinnamon rolls.  I just quartered my dough and after rolling out, I layered dough, cinnamon & sugar, dough cinnamon & sugar.  Roll this into on big roll and cut into 12-15 (depending on thickness.  I cut them about 3/4"  thick) large cinnamon rolls.  One recipe will make 2 large logs to cut.  Also, I let them rise in the refrigerator overnight and cook in the morning.

Excellent!! I made these exactly as the recipe says, except I cut the recipe in half to only make one pan. Yummm! My family rated them an 11 out of 10! I did roll them out at night and took them out of the refrigerator in the morning. I put them on an electric heating pad to help them rise more quickly.

Made two pans of these last night. Refrigerated overnight, then put in proofing box for an hour. 25 minutes was perfect in my oven. Made the frosting without adding the milk, and used 8 ounces of cream cheese. Iced it as soon as it came out of the oven, which melted it enough to make it spreadable. Delicious.

Good classic recipe. I cut it in half as I don't have a crowd. I used some leftover evaporated milk for the regular milk in the recipe. I also used a separate cream cheese icing recipe from this site but substituted the rest of the evaporated milk for milk in that recipe.

I took the tips others have added (thank you!) which included letting the dough rise before forming into rolls to rise again before baking, I also was short on time while also having a chilly home so I preheated the oven to 180 and turned off, then put the dough in to rise as noted by another user. The photo I included is pre-icing =)

I’ve baked all my life and these are by far the best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever made. Thanks for the recipe! like my rolls flatter, so they for sure get done in the middle, and aren’t overdone on the outsides, so I cut each roll into 16 pieces and that worked perfectly. The extra 4 pieces fit nicely in a bread pan.

The recipe was easy to follow. I wish the ingredients were divided into sections--dough, filling, icing. My husband and grown daughter really enjoyed them. I made my own icing with butter, sugar, milk, and vanilla as my husband does not like cream cheese icing. It makes a lot of dough--I put the second half in the fridge in a bag. I'm going to use it for monkey balls. I printed the recipe. I'll make it again.

After rereading the recipe I know that I followed the directions as it was written. For some reason I couldn’t get my dough to thicken enough! I had to keep adding flour. The dough was still too sticky. My cinnamon rolls came out tasting like flour! I’m going to try one more time since I love a challenge! Oh, and yes, all my ingredients were fresh!

The dough didn't seem to rise as much as I expected, but they turned out great and we're delicious. I used 8 oz of cream cheese in the frosting.  I cut the first half into 1/2 inch rolls, I would cut them a bit wider next time, more like 3/4 inch.

I used this recipe because of all the amazing reviews and I was so disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and by the time I got the dough smooth and elastic it was so overworked that the finished product is just dry and crumbly. I did as many reviews suggested and let it raise before rolling it out but that shouldn’t affect the crumbly ness. My husband and I each ate one and the rest got tossed. I don’t know how everyone else managed to get great rolls from this recipe, but I’m really bummed it didn’t work as written.

Didn't have the pudding mix to make the 3rd version of this recipe, this one has wayyyy too much sugar. I love sweets and it was way too much for me. Also not mixing the butter with the sugar makes the sugar gritty, don't enjoy crunchy cinnamon rolls.

I made these delicious cinnamon rolls and they were better than Cinnabon’s Rolls!  I made one dozen rolls and put them in one 9”x13” glass baking pan!  After I mixed up the dough, I immediately halved the dough and spread out each half (one at a time) to cover about 12”x18” on a heavily floured surface, spread ghee on it in lieu of butter, then spread the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture to cover the whole surface area of each half!  Then I rolled it all up and cut 12 rolls of about 2” thick.  For this recipe, I used GHEE in place of butter as it’s healthier for us, and it spreads so nicely!  For the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture, I used 6 tablespoons of cinnamon (in place of the recommended 2 tspns!) and mixed it with 2 cups of brown sugar, and they were scrumptiously divine!  (If you like Cinnabon’s Rolls, you’ll LOVE these!). I loosely placed the large rolls in the glass pan and they fit 3 across and 4 on the long side of the pan.  Since it’s summer time, I loosely covered the rolls with plastic wrap and set it outside in the 100 degree heat of Texas, and in about an hour they were drooling over the sides of the glass pan and had expanded at least a half inch above the top of the glass pan!  These big rolls were as big as Cinnabon’s Classic Rolls!  LOL!  Since they were so huge, I had to cook them at 375 for 30 mins, THEN COVER with aluminum foil and cook another 20 minutes!  Covering them kept them from burning on the tops!  My family loves these huge rolls, as do I!!

The recipe calls for the dough to be split in half and made in two pans.  I ended up making all of them in a single 9x13" Pyrex dish, and tried the overnight method, allowing the dough to rise in the morning for about an hour.  The center rolls were not fully cooked, while the edges were getting overbrowned.  This may be remedied by using the TWO pans, as the recipe stated.  Just posting this as a possible warning to others.  
I also would have added a bit more salt to the dough, for my taste.

So I just made this 20 minutes ago. I am not sure what the dough is missing, but its missing something. for this being the first time making it by hand and not buying from the bakery. SO I mean my family ate it which is great. Because I do have picky eaters,  thumbs up on that . but it is still missing something.

Tasty! I used 8 ozs. Cream cheese as recommended. I used heavy whipping cream in the icing instead of milk. Mmm good.

If i could give it a zero I would. I attempted to make this twice and both times the dough came out way to sticky to work with. I followed the recipes as said the first time and the second time I mixed the yeast with the water and waited ten minutes before continuing the recipe. I’m very disappointed. I tried to save the dough by kneading long and adding flour. Nothing has worked.

Loved the icing as I used it with a different cinnamon roll receipe.

This is a great recipe! Based on other reviews, I went ahead and proofed the yeast before adding it to the batter (if you pour the water and the eggs into the hot milk, it brings it down to a perfect temperature). After cutting the rolls, I let the pan sit on the radiator for an hour, then covered them and put them in the fridge overnight. This morning they were huge, which is when I realized this recipes was supposed to make 24 rolls. I had only cut 12. Unfortunately, this meant that when I cooked them, only the ones on the outer edge cooked through. Those, however, tasted great. (I attempted to recook the ones in the middle; they came out very strange.) The frosting is delicious. I will certainly make these again. Even my partner who doesn't like cinnamon rolls liked these.

This is my favorite cinnamon recipe.  I make it slow and steady.  Heating up the milk on low to 128-130 degrees before i add in the butter.  (Unsalted). It’s usually frozen so I keep the heat on until its melted and then I add the water.  This process can take up to 10 minutes.  While the milk is heating up I add the sugar to the mixing bowl and then add the yeast on top.  When the milk/water/butter mixture is at about 124 degrees I add it to the sugar/yeast very slowly and I mix it together with a fork. (I loose less yeast that way). I let the yeast mixture set for 10 or 15 minutes before I add the egg and 2 cups of flour.

These were fantastic!  I followed others’ suggestions and let the dough rise for two hours. The rolls came out of the oven soft and fluffy. Will definitely make again.

I bake A LOT! I wanted to perfect my cinnamon rolls.  This was the not recipe so I will keep looking.  There were SOOO many suggested changes that I cannot imagine why this got 4-1/2 stars.  Too much dough - not enough filling.  Nope.  The search is on but my hubby does not mind.  He thinks it is good but for me...not good enough! :-)

I tried to write a review and it posted without my changes. So here they are just Incase they help.  (note:  I am new to bread making and this is only the second recipe that I have tried).  1.  First change is I added the sugar and yeast (in that order) to my mixer and then added the milk/butter/water at 120-130 degrees.  I let it sit for 12 minutes until I could see a good amount of life in the yeast, even though it was instant yeast it really did help it rise.  2.  I added one cup of flour and mixed it in before I added the eggs.  3.  I added the salt after the eggs so that the yeast didn’t die out to fast.  4.  I let it rise in a clean bowl for two hours.  5.  I doubled the filling mixture, there was more dough with the long slow rise and it made 24 cinnamon rolls in one batch.  6.  I let the rolls rise for 90 minutes before I started to bake them.  7.  Since my hubby is picky on frosting, I used a store bought one, melted it in the microwave and poured it on top.  Next round I am going to find a better substation than that.

Not my first cinnamon roll recipe but Im not picky. My changes were simple: I melted the butter while heating the milk; I put ice in the water to cool it down quicker; I did not make these the night before so I cannot compare results, and after kneading, I let the ball of dough rise for 15mins before rolling it out, then I let rolls sit and rise again after placed in greased pan for remaining time.

Add a teaspoon of baking powder to the flour. Use dark brown sugar and add cornstarch for the filling. Before baking pour cold heavy cream on the rolls. Instead of vanilla for the frosting use dark maple syrup. They will come out gooey and moist. The filling will not harden up.

Made these for my husband's birthday and couldn't believe how insanely delicious they turned out. Just as with most great things in life, they were well-worth the wait. The only change I made was adding a dash of salt and cinnamon to the icing to cut the sweetness a tad. This recipe made tons (as it is supposed to) so we're freezing the majority of these lovelies for rainy days or for when we're back into working out (haha).

We followed the recipe just as it was and they were delicious. I always make extra frosting because we are always a little heavy handed when it comes to cream cheese frosting!

These were the best cinnamon rolls I’ve ever had! I made these with a friend and it turned out great! We doubled the filling recipe and ended up not needing to make the frosting. Like other reviewers suggested, we made sure to knead the dough for ten minutes, and then let it proof for 2 hours. To our disappointment, the dough didn’t rise at all. Perhaps it was the recipe or just our inexperience (it’s our first time making cinnamon rolls or bread, for that matter) but the texture wasn’t as fluffy as we would have liked. Nonetheless, once we pulled them out of the oven, they were heavenly! Worth the work, but if you’re short on time, I would recommend making the dough ahead and letting the dough proof overnight, so the next day, all you have to do is roll them out and bake.

The finished product is outstanding. It is very similar to TJ Cinnamon's rolls, which is a very good thing.

During preparation, however, we found that we needed a LOT more flour than what the directions said. It was closer to 8 cups of flour. With only six, our dough was very sticky and runny. Once we added more flour to come up with a more bread-like dough, the rolls turned out great!

Delicious!  We added one extra teaspoon of cinnamon. We put the rolls in the fridge overnight and put them in the oven the next morning. It took an extra 5 to 10 minutes to become golden brown. The glaze is perfect. Yummy Christmas morning treat!

I divided the frosting and added rum extract to half  of it, I was amazing both ways. I might add some pumpkin to the rolls next time.

Delicious!  Used parchment paper along base and edges to ensure soft edges;  Also had to add a good cup or so of adt'l flour to make it even remotely manageable..... but my goodness, they were spectacular!

Mine turned out really doughy and gooey. Not sure where I went wrong. Had to cook for much longer than 20 minutes. The flavor was great but my execution was flawed. :(

First of all I really loved this recipe although I made a few changes to it: 1) I did not let them rise. If you let the rise while they are baking you get a much larger roll. 2) I use half the amount of water for I find that it makes the rolls crispier. 3) I didn’t use any salt at all in the recipe because it makes the rolls sweeter. Thank you for the great recipe!

A delicious recipe and a seamless process. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the dough acts differently every time I knead it, and sometimes feel like it will never have enough flour! But that could just be me.

I liked them very much. Added pecan pieces to bottom of dish and on dough before I rolled it. Had difficulty rolling. Chilled in freezer 10 minutes before I rolled it to make it firmer. Added extra flour as I rolled it flat. Still too sticky. Not sure what I did wrong or what to do to solve that problem. Very pretty. Husband loved them!

I made the rolls the night before baking them and in the morning, I took them out of the refrigerator, let them set on the counter for about 2 hours before baking them.  I put the frosting on about 5 minutes after taking them out of the oven.  I used a glass baking pan, greased with crisco.  My husband and daughter both loved them, and I thought they were better than any I'd ever tasted.

These turned out well, but it is not a well-written recipe.  I had to add at least an extra cup of flour to the dough to make it workable.  Also, despite having more dough from the extra flour, 2 cups of brown sugar was a little too much for the cinnamon mix.  Maybe 1 1/2 would be better.

Far and above - best cinnamon rolls EVER! I let them rise longer than I've done with other recipes and they got so fluffy and light! Such wonderful flavor! I added pecan pieces to the brown sugar mixture and used twice as much cinnamon! Kneaded with my bread hook for about 10 minutes. No more kneading needed.  Will make these again for sure!

Awesome just says it all.....just a little tip for those who are trying it for the first time as I was,recipe called for  1 cup milk and 1 cup water which equals to 2 cups liquid. I used 1 and 2/3  milk.When using bakers flour I go for less liquid because dough is so sticky. My dough came out as smooth as the video using a dough blade from an hand mixer it's another way to get the dough smooth.

Interestingly, there is no first rise but they still came out very good.  I made half the recipe and baked it into two round cake pans.  The refrigerated pan took quite some time to rise so it would not have been ready .for breakfast, but of course, cinnamon rolls are great any time.

This recipe is awesome, easy, and truly delicious. The only change is made is that I made the dough with my hands, it took time but it worth it. I will probably make it again and again.

Came out perfectly!  Took 3 hours from start to finish, meaning when I could sit down and eat one.  Very tasty.  Next time I'll do everything the day before, as the author suggests.  Thank you!

Great tasting cinnamon rolls! :) I will be making these again!  I did follow the advice  in other reviews to cut the sugar in the dough to 1/2c and let the dough rise for 3 hours.  I made only a half recipe for one 9 x 13 pan.  They turned out perfect.  Yum!

The texture of the rolls was pretty good, but there was almost no cinnamon flavor at all. It needs some umph.

I made these the same day and everyone loved them. The recipe was really easy to follow.  I ended up adding a little extra flour, and let them rise for 2 hours. Though I ended up having to bake them about an extra half hour to make sure the centers were cooked.

Thanks so much to all the people who reviewed this recipe. It was a huge help to someone like me, who hasn't made cinnamon rolls in a very long time. This recipe was outstanding. The rolls turned out soft, sweet, just heavenly!  Definitely worth the time and effort. If you're making these, follow the suggestions of proofing the yeast before mixing the dough, and letting the dough rise 2 hrs. before rolling. It allows the dough to relax which makes rolling a lot easier. Great recipe, thanks!

This was the first time I had ever made any kind of bread/roll recipe.  I actaully made only a half recipe. It was fantastic!  The only thing diferent I did was to place them in a warm oven to raise.  They weren't doing much on the counter.  An hour in a 170 degree oven and they were puffed up nicely!  They were loved by everyone!

I made these as the overnight version. They turned out great. A few notes though- the dough needs about another 1/2 cup of flour to come together. I also let it rise in a greased bowl before rolling it out. Also- i refrigerated the rolls overnight. Make sure they get enough heat to rise- I let them sit on the counter for a while before I let them sit on the preheating oven. Definitely let them rise on top of the oven! They went from ok to perfect after 40 minutes. Everyone loved them! (And 8oz of cream cheese for the frosting as everyone has commented)

Make sure to add the sugar and yeast and let it sit for a few minutes before you add the salt/continue. Otherwise it doesn't rise enough. Otherwise this was a great recipe. And I followed it exactly twice.

I will make them again, but I found that they needed a lot more flour. The dough was extremely soft, and I had to work it with my bench scraper until I finally had enough flour worked in to get a dough I could handle. Each half weighed about 2 lbs.

Not only will I add more flour while mixing, I will cut the brown sugar by about half. It was a hot mess in the bottom of the pan. But flavor and texture were pretty good, so it's worth working with the recipe until I like it better.

I tried this recipe for cinnamon rolls and it turned out great. I also decided to try the recipe and make cinnamon pull apart bread and it came out great. So sweet and it worked well. Everything was the same except for the brown sugar mixture i decided to add more butter and a little milk. I heated it up in a sauce pan and This made it smooth and liquid caramel sauce. I added this to the dough when baking.

I had a craving for cinnamon rolls last night so whipped these up quick. Total time took about 3 hours. The things I did differently: 1. I didn't have any brown sugar, so I made my own with white sugar and molasses. 2. I was also out of regular milk but had some whipping cream tucked away so I used that everywhere it called for milk thinning it with a little water. 3. I added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger powder. 4. I added a tsp vanilla to the dough.

I got raves on the rolls themselves, but I still can't get my daughter to shut up about how good the frosting was. Rich and creamy without being too sweet.

Made these for Christmas morning and they turned out so good! I followed the recipe with only a couple minor changes- I mixed the dough in my stand mixer and then let it rest for two hours. Once rolled out and cut, I refrigerated the rolls overnight then let it rise in a warm place (my oven) for another two hours when I took it out in the morning. I used only about 1.5 cups brown sugar for the filling and 1.75 c confectioners sugar for the frosting. A lot of reviewers used 8oz of cream cheese but I stuck with the 3oz and I found it tasted great, especially with the slightly less amount of sugar I used. I don't like a lot of frosting anyway. I also sifted the flour before mixing it in. For the filling I read somewhere that mixing brown and white sugar makes it more "gooey" so I added in four tablespoons of white sugar into the filling mixture. I used a 9x13 pan and two pie pans. They came out great both ways.  The only problem I had was cutting the 12x9 roll into 12 slices. I ended up with 8 slices with the first roll, then had to roll the second one much bigger.

This was so good! The outside was nice and brown and the inside was soft and gooey (but not undercooked). It was my first time working with yeast, so I was a little nervous and followed the directions carefully. Will definitely make these again.

Had to add more flour.  Added more cinnamon and still thought the rolls weren't as flavorful as they could have been.  I did add the salt to the dough (I thought I may have forgotten).  They were ok, but I think I will look for another recipe to try next time.

No changes other than the 8 oz of cream cheese, I can't imagine these being any closer to perfection than they already are!
Fishing line works well to cut the dough into individual rolls, and the hubby has no problem with sacrificing line for these rolls!

Easy and oh so good. Longer rising time would give fluffier rolls. The dental floss didn't work for me. Mom used a white packaging string. If I can find some that is what I will try next time.

This is by far the BEST cinnamon roll recipe out there!  I make this recipes for breakfast every Christmas and get nothing but positive review!  The only change I made was that I added 8 oz of cream cheese to the frosting instead of 3.

Best recipe ever! It's a keeper, I even doubled it and gifted some of them to my friends. I also stuffed some of them with bananas. However my daughter thinks it can take more cinnamon, and I agree.

Amazing ooey gooey cinnabon type cinnamon rolls. It made a ton and they turned out nice and fluffy. The icing is delicious too. I made the dough in my kitchen aide with the kneading arm attachment and they turned out great!

Excellent! My first try at homemade cinnamon rolls. To make a rectangle I used a ruler and metal spatula to get close measurement and shape. I added cinnamon, vanilla, and almond extract to the dough to alter the taste. For the glaze I wanted a healthier alternative so I substituted the confectioners sugar for Tropical traditions' honey. Their honey does not have a heavy honey like taste. It is very mild and delicious. I also used vanilla and almond extract in the glaze. I used about 6 oz of cream cheese. My husband absolutely loved it and he is a very very picky eater.

This is it!!!I made these fab rolls after reading the reviews. Therefore, I let the dough rise for two hours and I baked at 350. You must allow the rolls to sit overnight and allow to rise for an hour or so the next morning. I think the next time I will add a little more sugar and cinnamon. But these are a must try and eat! Enjoy!!!

My experience in using yeast is very different than what this recipe calls for but tried it as is anyway and it turned out just fine.  So glad to have a recipe for cinnamon rolls now because I don't like the ones available at the store.  I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used 8oz of cream cheese.  It was just enough.  In one batch I added 1/2 cup of raisins.  Sooooo good.

Made this recipe and it's the best one from several cinnamon roll recipes I've made. They are best fresh, but warmed in microwave after having them refrigerated are a nice treat.

My family and I LOVED this recipe!!! The cinnamon rolls were not a bread-like consistency like some are...these were fluffy and delicious! However I let the yeast proof with the water and a tablespoon of the sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients. Then, after the dough was kneaded, i let it rest for 10 minutes covered before rolling. Then after rolling they sat in the fridge overnight and we had fresh homemade cinnamon rolls on christmas morning.

First ever making cinnamon rolls from scratch. They were so good but I had a hard time trying to cut them after I rolled them up. I will be making them for Christmas for my family.

Not sure what I'm missing; I bake all the time & followed the recipe exactly & they were just ok. Honestly, the Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix cinnamon rolls are far superior in taste & a lot less time consuming. I spent several hours on these are don't feel it was worth my time. I also prefer regular sugar & cinnamon over the butter vs. the dark brown sugar which seeped out all over the pan. Maybe just my own personal taste but I was not impressed.

Very yummy!  I threw these together at night and refrigerated over night.  They took a while to warm up and rise.  I ended up having to put a warm, damp cloth over the top and sit them under the vent on the stove where the heat from the oven comes out.  They are delicious though!

I used this recipe for my first time ever making cinnamon rolls. It did NOT turn out well. I followed the recipe & directions to a T (still wondering if I did something wrong...) and the rolls ended up being kind of stiff...not soft as I like a cinnamon roll to be. Also, the cinnamon sugar filling was almost impossible to spread for some reason...too dry.  I doubt I'll be trying this one again, even the cream cheese frosting wasnt good enough to save it.

These were great! The dough was perfect and stayed soft. I use alot more filling in mine-twice the butter, tons of cinnamon, and however much brown sugar I can pack on! If you use this icing be sure to use 8 oz. of cream cheese-otherwise it's just sugar taste and not to good. I haven't made cinnamon rolls in years and my family is so excited that I have found the perfect recipe again! These are also great with raisins in them-just soak the raisins in warm water until they soften up and put them with the filling-so good!

I loved this recipe. I read the other reviews, and decided to add more yeast.  I also warmed the water, and dissolved the yeast before adding it to the milk and butter.  they rose just fine, and tasted amazing.

Great cinnamon rolls! Perfect sweetness, nice and soft, moist too. I did need to add more flour, as I find is pretty typical of my experience with breads.  I kneaded with the dough hook on my Kitchenaid. I also let it rise after mixing to make the dough easier to work with so I wouldn't have to keep adding flour. For the filling, I used light brown sugar (didn't have any dark) and 3 tsps of cinnamon after reading reviews that it was not "cinnamony" enough with 2 tsps. Also, make sure they're close enough to touch in the pan so that they stay moist. Five stars+ with those minor tweaks.

First time I have ever made any type of bread/roll using yeast. I scaled down the recipe to 12 servings and have a feeling it was not correctly calculated.  The dough was soooo sticky I had to add close to an additional cup of flour. Not what I was looking for but they baked up nice and tasted okay.  My advise - don't change the serving size!

Good recipe--I used one cup milk and one cup buttermilk  to replace the 1 cup water because I had some in the fridge. Turned out super. I also made the glaze without the cheese and it was also good. The dough was easy to handle also.

best ever! Needed and extra 1.5 cups of flour (even though I used a stand mixer).  Dough was sticky, as mentioned, but firmed up while rising.  I let dough rise for 2-3 hours before rolling out, then put in fridge overnight.  Let rise again for 1-2 hours before putting in oven.  Agree with 8oz cream cheese in frosting.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made. The only change I made was to use 4 teaspoons of cinnamon, instead of 2. These are very, very good.

Making these cinnamon rolls was step one in overcoming my fear of yeast breads.  They replaced our traditional Christmas morning cinnamon rolls and turned out GREAT!  Recipe was easy to follow, clear and straightforward.  I also used 8 oz of cream cheese for icing.

These buns were AMAZING!  I had to add a little extra flour because the dough seemed a little too sticky to work with, but i LURVED them, and so did my husband.  SO fluffy and gooey, and not at all hard!  Anyone who's afraid of yeast dough should try these, you'll never fear it again.

Good Recipe!  I made them the night before.  I put them in the fridge without letting them rise at all and then set them out 1.5 hours before baking.  I took the advice of others about the cream cheese, and my husband thought it was way too "cream cheesey", guess it just depends on how much you like cream cheese.

These are excellent! Definately use 8 oz of cream cheese in the frosting.  I let mine rise for 2 hours, they are so fluffy and moist, better than any bakery!

These were fabulous! I made them Christmas morning to rave reviews. For one of the batches I added chopped up pecans to the bottom of the pan, yum! I also used an entire package of cream cheese for the frosting.

Delish! Even a novice like myself did awesome on these. Highly recommend! The icing was good too but I think i prefer the "Savory Cinnamon Rolls" icing better (from this site)

Kinda chewy, but still yummy rolls.  The frosting wasn't quite right.  I suggest you use more cream cheese and less butter.

These are AWESOME! I made them this morning and they are gone already - my husband and brother can't get enough. My picky five year old actually ate one and we can't get her to eat anything. I changed the frosting a bit. I added buttermilk and omitted cream cheese. Just a personal preference. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

well for right now i will only be able to rate this recipe a 1 star as i have no idea what went wrong, i tryed making these this afternoon did exactly what the recipe told me too but the dough came out sticky i even added more flour but it still was doughy i tryed putting in on the flourd counter and knead hoping this would help it but nothing,mabey because i used 3 cups all purpose flour with 3 cups whole wheat flour.
i guess i will try again mabey i should stay with the all purpose flour, does anyone have any idea what i did or maybe didnt  do.
ptmuguca@msn.com Help 
i would love to make these

Wonderful, just enough sugar and butter.  Light moist . Beautiful to look at. I would increase the cinnamon by 1tsp next time.
Makes 24 good size rolls.

I actually let these rise 2x before forming...just because of interuptions.
When formed, I put them in the fridge overnight.  They took about 3 hours to rise fully from cold.  I warmed my oven slightly, (under 100 degrees)turned it off, covered the buns and let them sit in the closed oven.
I repeated this very slight warming 2 x.
Take the buns out to preheat.

Also, slightly oil the pan before the buns go in.

These were really good. The rolled up so pretty and the icing was to die for. We live in Europe and everyone raved about these cinnamon rolls and begged for the recipe. 
Great recipe, will defiantly use it again!

I put them in a glass roasting pan. and these scorched from th botton. i kept waiting for them to brown on the top but that never happened. and after 30 minutes they were scorched at the bottom. and the filling was all dry. im so upset. is it because of the glass? and the sugar did go all gooey and leak out either. it just came out and got stuck to the bottom of the bun and got burnt :(

This was good ..not as cinnamon-y as I would like and a little too sweet so probably next time I will reduce the amt of brown sugar and increase the cinnamon..the dough was perfect, although I did tweak a few things based on the reviews here. I combined the dough, kneaded for 30 minutes and then let rise for 3 hours.  I then punched down the dough, and rolled out into the rectangles. I cut my rolls using a serrated bread knife and it worked great!  I cut this recipe in half and cut the dough into 2 inch rolls and it made 18 rolls for me...plenty big enough to serve. My husband asked if we were having a party as there were so many for just the two of us. My 1 year old didn't like them, too sweet for him so next time I will use a lot less sugar.

This was my first batch of homemade cinnamon rolls ever.  Although I went through the preparation rather hurriedly (compared to some of the other reviewers), they came out really moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making them again and taking the other reviewers' suggestions.

Made this in our imperfect oven and turned out great (after adding lots extra flour as others have said). Yummy but quite rich.   I will try a different glaze next time maybe with some orange  to cut the richness.

This recipe was good, however the dough was very soft and I had to add lots of flour to get the consistency right for forming the rolls. I beleive this made it not as soft.

Amazing, Came out much better than I expected, I cut the recipe in half to make just one pan but wished I hadn't since everyone gobbled them up so quickly. added little extra vanilla and 4oz cream cheese to the 1/2'd recipe. Also never had anyone rave so much about frosting but it wasnt to sickening sweet just perfect.  I'll be making another batch very soon.

The cinnamon rolls were delicous. It wasn't too bad for a first timer. However, did not like the frosting.

Definitely a good place to start. I gave 4 stars because they didn't rise until I put them in a warm oven, and only then it was minimal. As I was kneading the dough, I found the yeast had not dissolved at all - there were little granules throughout the dough. I wondered if this would be a problem and I think it was. Next time, I will try dissolving the yeast with the warm milk, and I may let it rise first before forming the rolls.  Hubby and son loved the taste though, so I will give this another try.

This is my first attempt making a bread-based recipe. I wanted to be safe and followed the recipe for the most part except I halved the recipe and made two mistakes (add warm water when forming the dough, baked at 325 degree for 40 minutes), my cinnamon rolls are still awesome!  They are so soft and in perfect sweetness. I took one reviewer's suggestion on letting the unbaked rolls rise for 3 hours in room tempture before putting them into the oven.  Hubby loves them. Will definitely make it again and add pecan chunks.

Perfect! This was a perfect cinnamon roll recipe! I only made 12 and followed the recipe with only a few small changes. I added a dash of clove to the filling and added some cinnamon to the dough. They turned out amazing!!

I made some really healthy changes and these came out unbelievable! Firstly i used  white whole wheat flour, soy milk instead of regular, and canola oil instead of butter. None was able to tell....I will surely be making these again!

I made these for Christmas morning with my two year daughter.  They were so easy (and fun) to make - though definitely messy!!  I took another reviewer's advice and made them with 8 oz cream cheese.  That was way too much icing - I ended up scraping most off.  There must be a happy medium here.  The dough and filling was fantastic!

This recipe is okay. It's a lot of work for cinnamon rolls. While mine were in the fridge over night a lot of the filling caramelized and emptied into the bottom of my dish. I let mine rise for over an hour and they didn't really rise very much. The icing is okay, I had a ton left over.  Over all an okay recipe.

Excellent Cinnamon Rolls.  I used a different icing on them because I cannot handle cream cheese and they were still great and disappeared quickly.  I am glad I hid a couple for safe keeping.

I wasn't very happy with this recipe.  I followed to the "T", but will make changes IF I decide to try again.  The size of the dough when rolled was too thick, which meant, when all the sugar was piled on, it was very difficult to roll tightly and thus all my sugar fell out all over the counter and into the pan.  I tried the overnight method, but it took WAY more than an hour for the dough to rise, so we ended up having rolls for lunch, rather than breakfast, which was annoying.  Finally, the sugar that I managed to keep in the dough, basically fell out as the dough settled, so all the flavor was stuck to the bottom of the pan.  The icing was not very flavorful and while this was edible, it was not enjoyable.  I think I'll either go back to the way I made them before or look for a new recipe.

I used a different recipe for the actual rolls, but used the filling and frosting parts from this and the cinnamon rolls were phenomenal!!  My family asks for them all the time and all said they were better than Cinnabon.  :)

I really didn't like the recipe, my rolls came out hard - the filling oozed and carmelized on the tray. When I was busy chipping away the rolls from the tray a bunch of them fell on the floor. Bleh. 

This recipe needs some rewriting, I think they were hard since it was all gooey when I was rolling it out, I put too much flour on the dough, and on the surface - overworking the dough and making a more chalky substance, than what it should have been; firm.

The filling was good though - even though most of it was wasted. 

[The icing didn't really matter after I had the roll itself, I put put in whatever porportions I felt were okay.]

These were really good. I think that these will replace my old standby cinnamon roll recipe.  I too made the changes that previous reviewers suggested.  I needed to add a little bit more flour, and used an 8oz package of cream cheese for the icing.  I also let the dough rest/rise for about 10 minutes after kneading.  I may let the rolls rise longer than an hour next time...they were still huge, but more dense and not as fluffy as I would have liked.  Still, these were delicious, and my family LOVED them and couldn't stop raving : )  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at homemade rolls.  They turned out great. I did add 1 tablespoon cinnamon to the dough mixture only because I like a lot of cinnamon. I used cream cream frosting II (from this web site) to top them.  My daughters loved them.

Really good, but had a hard time rising.  Might want to let the dough rise once BEFORE you make the rolls themselves.

This was great! Very easy to make, and everyone loved them! I used 8oz of cream cheese like other reviewers had mentioned, but that made a little too much topping. I'd try 5 or 6 oz next time.

Very popular with my inlaws. The filling oozed out to the edges of the pan quite nicely. After reading the reviews, I used the frosting recipe from "Clone of a Cinnabon" on this site. Thanks.

Pretty good. The only thing I think could be improved is that they are a little on the dry side. I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from this site for the icing. The guys at my husband's work devoured them.

I agree with the other reviews that the recipe does not have enough flour. I just simply added a cup at a time till it was the right consistancy. I believe those who had to dry of rolls added to much and should add a 1/2 a cup at a time. I give these a 5. The frosting made it not to sweet, we loved them!! We would make them again FOR SURE!!

These were really easy to make. They didn't rise much and I thought that they were too sweet. The dough is sticky, but nothing a little extra flour won't help. I will add less brown sugar the next time around. Yes, I will definately make them again. My boyfriend fell head over heels in love with the rolls and with me for making them. Thanks alot for sharing!!

Sorry but I did not find this recipe at all appetizing. I don't know what I did wrong, but the rolls tasted like biscuits with butter,cinnamon, and sugar sprinkled on top of them. I don't know, maybe ya'll like the tastes of biscuits.

The rolls had a very good flavor, and they were easy to make in the bread machine.  I added extra butter, cinnamon, and sugar to make the richer...and I used a cream cheese frosting. I also did not separate the dough into two sections.  I used all the dough to make 7 HUGE rolls...they were pretty good.

These cinnamon rolls are REALLY delicious and rival those Cinnabon ones in the mall! I'm so happy I found a recipe that actually used a frosting instead of a glaze.

I made these cinnamon rolls the other day and they are delicious.  My picky 2 year old REALLY likes them.  I'm making some right now to take over to a good friend who's recovering from surgery.  Great recipe.  Angela

I haven't met a good cinnamon roll recipe yet that wasn't really time consuming but this one is really worth it. I added walnuts and raisins to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture and it turned out fantastic!

I give it 2 hands on the belly~! It is nice and fluffy. Although it takes awhile to prepare the dough and for it to rise, it is absolutely worth it! Give it a try, and you will fall in love with it too.
