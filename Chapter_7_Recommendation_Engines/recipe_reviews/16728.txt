This was an excellent recipe, with the caveat of several necessary changes.  The amount of pepper asked for has to be a misprint.  I halved it, and upon eating, decided that it should be halved again.  Also, halved the garlic.  Used fresh tarragon instead of dried, in the same amount called for.  We like a thicker sauce, so doubled the amount of cornstarch.  Also, used low sodium tamari rather than soy, although had I not had the tamari on hand, would've used the soy, but also in a low sodium variety.  Otherwise excellent, and will be added to the regular repertoire.

This was very good.  I cooked it at 350 for 1 1/2 hours, then I removed the garlic, pepper, and tarragon off the roast, and cooked it for another hour at 200.  It was so tender it almost fell apart.  My family did not care for the carrots, potatoes or the sauce.  Very soy tasting.  Will make again, minus the carrots and potatoes.

This recipe was definitely an easy family pleaser. We added it to our recipe box (and noted the pepper change)! I usually read the reviews before trying a new recipe. My mistake! I wanted a quick and easy last minute recipe in which I had all the ingredients on hand and this was it! I questioned the amount of pepper while preparing it and decided not to adjust it. I think it must be two TEASPOONS instead of two tablespoons. It was a quick fix for tonights dinner. We just scraped off the seasonings and enjoyed the most moist tenderloin we have ever eaten! I am already planning on using this recipe for an upcoming large family gathering. They will think I slaved for days preparing this beautiful, tasty meal!

There was too much pepper in this recipe.  My husband would not eat it.  I personally would cut down the pepper to less than a teaspoon.  If it hadn't been so hot it would have been delicious.  Was that pepper amount a misprint????

I made one substitution in this recipe: I used lemon pepper for the pepper. And I made one mistake: I mixed 1 1/2 cups water with the soy sauce. The aroma while it was cooking was wonderful! This recipe is a keeper for us. Very flavorful way to make a pork tenderloin.

OUCH! This was painfully hot! I like spicy food, but this was too much. The flavor itself was quite good, while my tastebuds were still working. Try it, but cut the pepper in half, at least!

I took all the ingredients & put them in the crockpot all day. Then I took the meat & vegs out w/a slotted spoon & put them in a serving dish (I used fresh tarragon instead of dried so I removed the sprigs @ this time). Then I poured all the juices out of the crock pot into a saucepan on the stove, added the cornstarch & thickened it. Then I poured all that yummy gravy over the meat & vegs. Voila! Good stuff. Thanks!  :)

Way too much spice for my family.  Even after scraping off the seasonings midway through cooking, the smell brought tears to the kids eyes.

I agree with the other reviewers that the amount of pepper was probably a misprint. I used 2 teaspoons instead of the 2 tablespoons and kept everything else as written. DH, myself and my 6 year old son loved it but it was too spicy for my daughter. My son puts pepper on his popcorn so he can take the heat. I think when I make this again (and I will), I'll just use 1 teaspoon of pepper and see how that turns out. The pork was very tender and the veggies were pretty good too though a little over cooked for our taste but a good flavor.

My family just loved this pork loin. My son is very picky and he just went on and on about it. I will cut the pepper in half next time, too much. Also, I did not use tarragon, I used an Italian seasoning mixture. My wife has insisted that this is the only way she will eat roast pork again.

This was delicious!  I didn't use tarragon and instead I took the advise of another rating and used Italian Seasoning.  Very tasty!

WAY TOO SPICY especially for kids - I will never again try a recipe without reading the reviews.  If I had followed their suggestions about the amount of pepper it might have been OK.  Very tender but too hot.

I didn't like this recipe but my husband thought it was ok.  If I made it again, I wouldn't use so much pepper and tarragon as the flavors were just too overwhelming.  I couldn't even eat any of it, and my kids? Forget it.

Seriously, cannot believe people said it was too spicy, they must like real bland food. Was a real nice blend, I also substituted lemon pepper for just straight pepper and added 1/2 cup lemon juice with 1 cup of water. Loved it.

The pepper has to be a typo. I know from a friend that it's also printed this way in a nationally known cookbook. We tried 2 tsp of pepper, and it was still a bit much. I'll try a single teaspoon next time.  We're not a soy family, so we substituted a marinade for the soy and were very happy with the results. The veggies do absorb a lot of flavor, so they're much better with the reduced pepper as well.  We like an au jus rather than a gravy, so we skipped the cornstarch step.   The next time we cook this one, we will probably add some crushed walnuts to the garlic spread... oooo, and perhaps some ginger... hhmmmm... the possibilities abound!  No matter what you like, this recipe is easy to cook and easy to customize. It's definitely a winner at our house!

Made this for dinner last nite...  It stayed really really juicy, but I found the soy sauce to be over-powering on the potatoes and carrots.  Teryaki will be a sub next time I try this one!

Would cut back on the Soy.....The vegetables lose all their taste and aquire a 'Soy' flavour.
The roast itself is very good.

My family did not like this recipe.  We drained the soy sauce off the tenderloin halfway through the cooking process and tried to rake off the minced garlic.  The smell was horrible!!  I will not use this recipe again. It was easy, but the taste was not to our liking.

This could be a terrific recipe but the pepper and tarragon were too much.  I will make it again and use less of both spices because we did like it a lot.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I didn`t use all the pepper, and doubled the corn starch. Next time I will go half and half for the pepper(lemon&black) and cut down the soy sauce(even with reduced sodium) I found it a little salty. The meat was so tender no knife was necessary.

I'm giving it a 3 only because my son and husband liked it. I thought it was way to spicy and I like spicy food. I probably should have read the reviews before I made this. Next time, I would cut down the garlic and the pepper.

Loved this recipe, worth the prep time. I made a couple changes,  I used a dash of rosemary instead of the tarragon I didn't have. I also only used 1 1/2 cups of carrots, and 2 potatoes. Cooked for 60 minutes, took the foil off and cooked another 20 mins. This is peppery but that's our kind of food! If it's too much pepper,  I suggest halving it. Served on top of white rice, delicious dinner.

Pretty much did the recipe as directed except I did as suggested by others and only used 1 teaspoon of pepper. Also opted to used fresh tarragon instead of dried. Also used low sodium soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. My husband was in love with the vegetables (he's usually more of a meat guy). He was also a huge fan of the sauce. The meat itself was good as well. I could see how some could find it too hot, but with the sauce it was perfect. Will definitely make again!

Wasn't sure how to rate this. As written, there's probably WAY too much pepper. However, using my own judgement as well as the other reviews, I cut the pepper in half. In this form, it's worthy of 5 stars. It's hard to find recipes this easy that are this good. One note: I didn't do the vegetables and accordingly cut the soy sauce in half.
