My pork tenderloin turned out great!!  I used BBQ sauce rather than the chile sauce and regular mustard instead of dry.  I cooked my 2 pd tenderloin covered w/ foil on 225 covered for 35 minutes and then turned it up to 425 for about 20 minutes..  It moist and just great.  Even my very picky hubby got seconds and all 3 of my kiddos ate without complaining!!!

Excellent!  I didn't have dry mustard, so I just added some regular mustard. I also added salt and pepper.  My family ate this like it was going out of style.  The 5 year old and 7 year old were fighting over the last piece of pork.  My father in law asked for the recipe.  I can't wait to make it again!

We liked this a lot, but did make some changes.  We used Sriracha for the chili sauce and didn't use as much as it called for.  I'd say we used about 3 tablespoons, maybe a little more?  Also, we used prepared dijon mustard because the idea of that much dry mustard scared me--dry mustard is hot!

Anyway, we thought it was delish with the changes we made and will definitely keep this one in the repertoire!

I have fallen in love with this marinade.  It even works well on chicken.  I only made a few changes to it due to what i had on hand at the time.  Instead of chili sauce i used a couple of tablespoons of chili powder, and when I am in a pinch i use regular mustard instead of dry.  Depending on whether or not I will be bbq-ing the meat i will include a little of the final bbq sauce with it.  I also like adding a little garlic and onion powder because I just can't seem to cook with out them :)  As I said I just love this marinade.  (it works well as a sauce for Crockpot cooking too!)

This is the best marinade yummy! I cut the dry mustard down to 2 Tbls (because 1/4 cup sounds like a lot) I marinaded over night then put on the grill with indirect heat and a pan under it with some water and then putting the left over marinade in the pan also makes like a candy coating on the outside SOOOO YUMMY~

What a great easy and tangy marinade. The only change I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar (added it a tiny bit at a time) Marinated some boneless pork chops for 24 hours, and they came out great. Husband said he'd like a bit more spiciness next time. Thanks!

I pretty much cut the recipe in half (only needed enough for 1/2 rack of ribs) but omitted the white sugar and substituted mango juice for the pineapple juice. Yummy!  Am marinating the ribs as I write, but know  they are going to be fab.  Will let you know.  Also, am going to use about 1/3c. of the marinade (not  used on the meat) and add some olive oil to make a salad dressing.  May use it over green salad or cuke salad or cole slaw.  Should be awesome!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family really really enjoyed the pork steaks I used to make this recipe. I ground mustard seeds to make the dry mustard(because I didn't have any powder), also made a quick fix Chili Sauce recipe from here(since I didn't have any either) But followed the recipe with making accomendations. As I thought the recipe was decent and fairly good. I could have used something added to break the sweetness up. My opinion, a little soy sauce. But otherwise, it is a nice base.

Excellant marinade! I've been trying different recipes and this was one of the better one I tried. Marinaded boneless spareribs in this they were delicious. Didn't change anything.

I have used this on pork as well as tofu, and it is well received.  I have subbed 1/2 c. yellow mustard when I was out of dry.  I've also reduced sugar by half without loss of flavor.

This marinade is AMAZING! Major hit in my house. Even caught my daughter running her finger in the pan I baked the pork on and licking it, lol. Can't wait to try this on chicken! Thank you so much for sharing!

It was ok. Used chile powder because we didn't have chile sauce, not sure what difference it would have made. Would not make again.

This recipe was a great starting point.  I used prepared mustard, and Pineapple Chipotle salsa.  For good measure, I added 2 chopped fresh Jalapeno peppers as well. It tasted sweet and hot.  Clearly a winner.

I followed this recipe to a tee except for the mustard(can't stand mustard). I thought it to be still very good and can imagine the mustard would give a little kick to it. This would also go great with chicken or any other meat.

I found this marinade very sweet, even though I did not use the white sugar.  I added 1 green pepper sliced, 1 cup of pineapple tidbits, and 2 carrots chopped to the marinade.  Instead of the dry mustard I used regular mustard.  I will definitely make this again, but I'll cut back to 1 cup brown sugar.

VERY GOOD!!  I made this looking for a different taste for pork than what I typically do and found this.  As others noted, I used 3 tbps of Sriracha instead of chile sauce and orange juice since I didn't have pineapple juice.  I'd suggest saving some of the marinade - everyone wanted extra!!  Has become a favorite at my house.

This is a great marinade, I used it for pork rib and it was delicious! I used honey bbq sauce instead of chili sauce and juice from crushed pineapple. I did not have a lot of juice from the crushed pineapple so I just added some of the crushed pineapple to it. I added the pork ribs and put it it the refrigerator fro a couple of hours and the used my George Foreman grill to ccok them. My son loved the flavour, even the hard crunchy part, he normally leaves that on his plate! Thanks so much!

This was very good.  What i did though is marinaded cubed pork and pinapple chunks.  When i went to cook, i draned the marinade and saved.  I cooked the pork, then added a little flower to the drained marinade, i then slowly added the marinade back into the pork which made it saucy.  Served that over rice

This was SOOO good!  I was skeptical of the Mustard but you couldn't even tell it was there.  I also used a small can of crushed pineapple instead of juice and it was so flavorful!  I did as one of the other reviews suggested and brought the remainder of the sauce to a boil and used it as a dipping sauce.  Will definitely be making this again!

This was a great easy recipe for a pork marinade. I didn't have Chile sauce, so I used soy sauce instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was really tasty!

I used the marinade on cubed pork loin for kabobs. They turned out great. Very flavorful and stayed moist and tender. Tried the recipe as written the first time like I usually do and wouldn't change a thing.

Bored with the same old pork? This is a must try marinade. When you eat this, you get a nice sweet (but not too sweet) flavor followed by the actual pork itself.  Finally, a kick of heat pops in at the end.
As other reviews suggested, you can substitute regular mustard for dry and use the hot sauce of your choice in lieu of chile sauce.  I selected Cholula Original Hot Sauce and marinated over night. 
Everyone from our 8 year old son to my 60 year old parents devoured their meals. We served it with seasoned brown rice and snap peas. Thank you to Sal for submitting this recipe.
