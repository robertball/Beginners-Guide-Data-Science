The first time we made this salad there was too much dressing, this time I cut the dressing in half and it was just right.  We also used chow mein noodles instead of wonton wrappers and used a bag of lettuce.

This was sooooo good!  It's one of the best things I've made from this website and I find about 95% of my recipes from here!  This is the kind of salad served at a restaurant and they charge $11... The dressing is excellent! The nutritional value is a little scary but as a dietitian, I'm sure it's from the wontons and you can omit those if you want. Also I think the almonds and olive oil in the dressing add fat - but the good fat!  EXCELLENT!

We really enjoyed this one!  This recipe made a ton of dressing, so instead of mixing it up before serving we just had it, as well as the oranges and water chestnuts, available on the table so that we could customize our salads.  I also added some baby spinach to the lettuce, which was really good.  Great summer salad!

Very good!  I used chow mein noodles in place of fried wontons - mostly because it makes it simpler.  The salad was wonderfully flavorful and a hit with the whole family.  I did cut back both on the chicken and the dressing.  Half a recipe of dressing was plenty, and we aren't big meat eaters so one monster chicken breast did it for us. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great salad!  My husband is a meat and potato mand and doesn't really like having salads for dinner, but he loved this one.  Next time I would use chow mein noodles instead for the convenience.

Delicious and refreshing summer salad!  I used homemade teriyaki marinade, which I think put it over the top.  I kept everything else the same except decreased the salad dressing since it made a ton.  This is a definite keeper for summer grilling!

So good, the more wontons the better, they help balance out the dressing.

Well, I kinda, sorta made this recipe.  I made the chicken as directed.  I scaled the dressing back to 1/4 of the recipe and it was plenty for two salads.  I did think the dressing was overly sweet, so I added another splash or two of vinegar.  I mixed it up right in the bowl using my emersion blender (love that thing and cleanup is so easy!).  I also cheated and used wonton strips that I had on hand.  My biggest deviations were in the salad ingredients: I used a mix of baby lettuces from the garden, the almonds, the mandarin oranges, and added some chopped green onions.  I didnâ€™t have water chestnuts, so I threw in some dried cranberries and I omitted the sesame seeds because I thought the salad had plenty of crunchiness going on with the almonds and wonton strips.  This turned out very well and I would definitely make it again!

I marinated overnight in a bottled teriyaki sauce as I am always planning meals 1 day in advance.  We really enjoyed this deli-quality recipe and is easy!  The crispy wontons are easy and I made a peanut sauce just to dip them in.  I don't like the oranges so I omitted those and i didn't make nearly that many sesame seeds because I find the flavor over-powering; I think I used a tablespoon. We aren't the biggest teriyaki fans and this was really b good but next time I think I will marinade in the peanut sauce.   Overall, this is easy and worth a try and if you love (not just like) teriyaki then you will give it a 5-star rating!

Recipe Group Selection:  02, May 2015 ~ I cut the serving size down to two and adjusted everything accordingly.  With the adjusted size I used three green onions and cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  A trusted AR reviewer, bellepepper, mentioned that she thought the dressing was a little sweet.  I'm glad I took her advice and cut it back.  For my DH and I, the dressing portion for 2 was perfect with the 2 tablespoons.  We enjoyed the combined flavors of the salad ingredients.  I had a package of tortilla salad strips in the cupboard, so I used those in place of frying my own.  A great summer salad that we really enjoyed.  I used 'Teriyaki Sauce' recipe from AR to marinate the chicken.

Easy enough. We did use wonton strips that were already to use instead of the cutting & frying of them. Also we don't care for water chestnuts so added diced apple. I didn't have a can of mandarin orange segments so we used some little cuties/halos. I think they taste better anyway than can fruit. Will make again, especially in the hot weather.

Hmmm.  It's edible.  Frying wonton wrappers was harder than I had expected.  They burn quickly.  The rest of these ingredients were alright, but really nothing to get excited about.  There was WAY too much dressing; a person could definitely cut that in half.

I took the advice of others and halved the dressing recipe.  We didn't have sliced almonds so substituted dry roasted pepitas.  Also, made without wonton or chow mein noodles.  Great summer salad!

Delicious and refreshing salad, perfect for summer. The dressing made a bit more than we wanted so we didn't use all of that, probably just half. Also, did not make the wonton strips ourselves, just bought the store packaged kind. Lovely, thanks for sharing!
