We loved this recipe. I did not bake this as I've found that that sometimes dry's out the pasta. I added the soup and then the cheese, a chedder, mozzorella mix and let it sit two minutes to fully melt and it was amazing. Next day's leftover's were just as creamy and cheesy. I did not put in the pimentos because my daughter and grand-daughter wouldn't eat it with them. This is the one from now on. Thanks to Grandma Bee

This is the easiest mac and cheese ever! I added some dried onion bits, garlic powder and red pepper flakes for a little extra zip. It was a huge hit.

This I my recipe, and I have been experimenting. I melted 2 tablespoons butter in the microwave, mixed in the crackers, and used that for the topping. I also mixed in small frozen peas in step 3. Nice additions!

I remember this from when I was a kid too.  I made as is a a trip down memory lane.  next time I would add hamburger, sausage or bacon as it is a little bland.  This would make a really good side dish for spicy meats.

First time I ever made home-made (not from a box) mac n cheese.  I read thru many recipes and wasnt crazy about using eggs or evaporated milk.  So I decided to try this one.  I left out the pimentos, added diced ham, about 1 Tbsp of dried mustard and pepper to taste.  I used 8oz. of sharp cheddar and 8 oz. mild because many of the recipes I looked at called for sharp.  The cheese and soup did not mix well, so I added 1/4-1/2 cup of milk.  I might add a little more next time.  Oh and I bought Progresso Bread crumbs instead of soda crackers and only used about 2 oz.  I will make it MY way again!  Thx Bee!!

My family was not crazy about this - maybe with some seasonings it would have been better.

Family and company really enjoyed this mac and cheese.  I used Fat-Free cream of celery in place of the cream of mushrooms as we don't care for mushrooms.  Enjoyed the taste of the pimentos in this recipe.  Served it with 'Meatball Grinders with a Yummy Sauce' another AR recipe.  Dinner was a success.  Thanks MOTTSBELA for sharing this recipe, it will be made again in this house.

Awesome Recipe!!!  Came out perfect.  Not a fan of olives, so added fresh mushroom, jalapeno, and diced ham.

Good recipe but I didn't find it cheesy enough. Next time I will use two cans of cheese soup.

This wasn't bad, but I prefer to melt my cheese in a bechamel type sauce before mixing in with pasta because it melts better.  Next time I intend to add a small amount of water to the soup so it is thinner and then heat it and stir in cheese until melted, and then mix this in with the pasta.  It is just my personal preferance.
Other than that it is pretty good.  I don't know why I didn't think of using cream of mushroom soup like a sauce to melt the cheese in before.

Used elbows and didn't have any pimentos. Also didn't have saltines so I used Panko crumbs. Delicious! Had this for supper one night and lunch the next day.
