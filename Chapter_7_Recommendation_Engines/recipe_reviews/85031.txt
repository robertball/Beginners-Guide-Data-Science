These are delicious. They remind me of a similar dish I get at Season's 52. I roasted the poblano's and added a few tbls of cream cheese to the filling along with cumin, paprika, and a little fresh salsa as well.

Good flavors with this recipe - here's my tips on making this.  I was a bit confused about what peppers to use because it said to fill them with only 1 T of the mixture.  I ended up getting the long green mild chiles.  I roasted them and after I peeled the skin realized that it was going to be pretty much impossible to slit and stuff them neatly - the roasted peppers are thin and slippery.  There was also the seeds inside that I didn't feel should be left in there so I seeded them as well as skinned them.  I then put the roasted pepper on a fajita size flour tortilla and proceeded with adding the mixture and wrapping like a burrito.  A key flavor is the enchilada sauce, so get that has good flavors.  In the larger grocery stores they usually have a good selection of specialty sauces - check those out.  I used one that had roasted peppers and citrus.  I used mexican Fresco cheese in the chicken mixture and then sprinkled a mexican blend of shredded cheese on top.  The roasted green chiles are so delicious - I'm going to think twice about buying canned ones again!

Fantastic! I know the recipe was talking about poblano peppers, but I can see how it could be confusing. I made it for dinner tonight and my SO said it's "fantastico! que sabor! que rico!"  If you have the opportunity, roast the poblanos on the grill over a really hot fire (like just as soon as you get the coals going). The skin will blister and blacken easily. Keep turning them until you blacken them on all sides and then toss them in a doubled or tripled plastic grocery bag and tie it shut.  When the chiles are cool enough to handle, the blackened skin will be easy to remove.  Run the chile under cool water to wash off the last bits of skin. At this point, if you're cooking ahead,  you can pat them dry and store in the fridge overnight.  Take them out and let them come to room temp before stuffing. If you're the type that likes to putz with appetizers, you can do the same thing with nice big jalapenos, but you need to remove the stem end and get the seeds.Then you'll be stuffing the chiles from that end instead of cutting a slit. This is a fantastic recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

Fabulous!!!  Like another reviewer, I too used poblano peppers (5) and a rotisserie chicken that was shredded and I added cumin and chile powder too. I am thinking the next time I will try a light batter to the stuffed peppers and then I'll fry them to make them more similar to a rellano.  Delicious, thanks!

I also used the store bought roasted chicken and used the leftover chicken for other dishes later. I used 4 large poblano peppers instead of the 24 small green peppers mentioned. I also removed the seeds once I split the peppers. I served with spanish rice. So easy and SO yummy. My husband claimed this was now one of his favorite dishes.

Insanely good...i used the already made roasted chicken at the market.  I shredded this and it saved so much time. I also added monterey jack cheese into the filling for extra zing, and topped off each chile with fresh pico de gallo. This was extremely creative and different---I loved it!!!  Thanks for the wonderful idea.  I did the same thing with huge tomatoes, but liked the chile version better.

I made this a few weeks ago but I am just now getting around to rating it. I made it for Bunco Night when the theme was "sweet and spicy" (this of course being the spicy, and a trifle as the sweet). I changed a few things so I dont know if without my changes if it would've been spicy. I used a pre made cajun/bbq chicken that was already very spicy. I also made enchilada sauce and kicked it up alot, too. And I topped with a peppery and hot cheese. So with all that together it made a very spicy but DELSIH dish. Ill make again!

This was really tasty and I actually enjoyed it better the next day.  I think the type of enchilada sauce that you use really makes or brakes the dish.  I used the canned stuff but think I was to try the dry packet next time.

Restaurant QUALITY for sure. This was easy to make and was awesome in flavoar. I used the enchilada sauce packet as other recommend (which was cheaper) and removed all the seeds from teh peppers. IF you leave the seeds it will definitely kick up the heat. Served with sweet corn tomalito and this was superb!

This turned out soupy.  It TASTED good, but didn't really make a meal. It fell apart and we actually served it over tortilla chips as nachos and that was really, really good!

This was great and SUPER easy! I bought some roasted hatch chiles from a roadside stand and used those. However, I didn't realize until near the end of stuffing them that I hadn't scraped out the seeds. Hooboy. 

Furthermore, I had some leftover chicken that I'd baked a few days ago, so I simply shredded it for the stuffing.

When I make these in the future, I think I'll just cut off the stem (where most of the seeds hide out), discard it, and stuff the meat mixture down into the pepper that way as opposed to slicing them stem to stern and stuffing it lengthwise. It's a bit less messy and you don't risk destroying the entire in the process.

I served these with a simple black bean side dish and it was great - easy, tasty, and affordable.

This was great! We tried this on an "indulgence" night, since we normally try to cut down on fat and eat healthier.  It was well worth the extra fat from the cheese. It is a little time consuming, but definitely worth it. We used Anaheim peppers (6 of them by adjusting the serving size to 3) and used Pepper jack cheese for the chicken mixture, but used regular cheddar for the final 5 minutes. We also used canned Old El Paso red enchilada sauce.  It was very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced the amount for four people and used poblanos peppers. We also made it a bit simpler by using a store bought rotisserie chicken. We didn't take the skin off our peppers, we like the flavor of the blackened pepper. Used Las Palmas green enchilada sauce. We served this with Chili-Cheese Mashed Potatoes on this site. This really was a simple meal to make, not too may ingredients, and so delicious.  I imagine you could use any peppers, but poblanos have such a nice smoky flavor to them. Thanks PALS, we will be making this again.

I made this last night and it turned out great! I used 4 poblano peppers, three chicken breasts, and made my sauce from a packet of enchilada sauce seasoning with 2 small cans of tomato sauce. The poblano's were a perfect substitute!

Delicious!! BUT!...Take the seeds out first!!  (Unless of course you don't mind callin 911 for the firetrucks to come out!)Taking the seeds out is time consuming so have patience!  I also used poblano peppers because I just like them better than chile peppers and they needed to be scorched in the brolier much longer than 5 minutes...more like 1/2 hour with MY oven. I bought a 16 oz container of sour cream and mixed in 8oz of it with the chicken & cheese mixture...also added some sauteed fresh garlic. Will make this again for sure! =)

We made this dish with Anaheim Chilies.  Absolutly loved it.  We like our food very hot.  I sauteed {sp?} yellow onions and a diced Jalepaneo and then added it to the shredded chicken mix.

I made these tonight for dinner. I cut the recipe to 4 peppers and it was so mucho bueno!  I used some frozen chicken I'd cooked in the crock pot then froze, Mexican cheese blend and canned sauce. It was very easy to make. It was also my first time to roast and peel peppers so I expected it to be very difficult but since I only had four it didn't take any time at all.  Thanks so much for the scrumptious recipe.  I will definitely use it many times.

made with poblanos and mixed hot taco sauce with enchilada sauce for spice. This is incredibly good, even with reduced fat cheese. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll throw some chipotle into the sauce. Incredible flavor in the roasted peppers.

OMG! This recipe was amazing! I will definitely make this over and over. I used pablono peppers, like others suggested. I also used green enchilada sauce (in the can.) I marinated my chicken in salsa and cooked it in the slow cooker the day before I made this. Really cut down on the work for me-plus the flavor of the chicken was fantastic.  Next time I think I will include the olives in the chicken mixture rather than putting them on top of the peppers.

I followed one of the other reviewer's suggestions.  I used anaheim peppers by downsizing the servings to 3.  The first time I did them I used all cheddar but the second time, I used the packaged mexican cheese variety (cheddar, monterey jack, etc.).  Both came out wonderful.  It is true.  The enchilada sauce is key.  I used the mild El Pato red enchilada sauce in the can.  It has enough flavor without it being overly spicy.

This worked well.  I roasted the peppers with my weed burner (flame throwing torch.  I usually use that to start my smoker) and it worked beautifully and quickly.  I chose Anaheim Chiles because I like them better than poblano, but beware their delicacy as they become soft.  For the mixture I chose to use 2 cans of costco canned chicken breast.  Normally I would crock pot some breasts, but I was lazy today.  Peeled and seeded the chiles and stuffed them generously with the chicken/cheese/enchilada sauce combo.  Baked as directed,  garnished, and served with spanish rice.  Wahlah!

Yummy! I used poblano peppers - not sure if I was supposed to, but they worked great. Just a few tweaks because I knew it would be a tad bland for our tastes. I added a can of rotel and about a cup of sour cream to the filling, along with garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin. I also used green enchilada sauce. I'll make this again; we really liked it. Thanks :)

This recipe was by far my favorite!! Amazing!!! I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker the night before seasoned, a can of chicken broth & a few dashes of chicken bouillon. The chicken was tender and fell apart & had a lot of flavor!! I followed this recipe minus the olives. I used 10 large poblano peppers( which I grilled) took out most of the seeds.   We like it spicy. Medium enclilada sauce served with spanish rice and refried beans. My husband loved it!1 I can't to make this again!!

I made this last night and it came out great.  I did substitute green chile enchilada sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe I can add to the rotation.

This recipe is Fabulous! I stuffed roasted poblano peppers and made my own enchilada sauce, it turned out fantastic!

Great recipe! Almost like Chile Rellenos but without the egg wash and with the addition of chicken. Loved this! Wanted to repurpose some shredded chicken and this was perfect! I, too, used poblano peppers. They turned out great! My husband has already asked me to make it again!

This was a hit! I used Anaheim chiles and partially removed the seeds. We like green enchilada sauce, and I used Las Palmas canned, but combined it with some Rotelle tomatoes (drained) and some cumin. I also sautéed onion and 2 serranos and added to the chicken mixture, along with about 1/4 cup sour cream and Monterey Jack instead of cheddar (goes better with the green sauce). Was a great recipe and I'd like to try as written next time. Thanks!

These were a hit with my family! I followed the recipe exactly except I used canned Ortega Chiles only because I already had them on hand. If doing it this way was very good, I can only imagine with how it would taste using the fresh peppers. I will be making these again because my husband asked that they be placed on "the list" of make again dinners!

these were really, really great! i have made these twice now, once with canned green sauce and once with canned red sauce. the sauce really does matter!!! i liked the green better, the red was a little too bitter. also, the longer you char the peppers in the broiler, the easier it is to remove the skin. i would also suggest scooping out the seeds once you slit the peppers open, too. my bf loved these, except some of the peppers were extremely hot... so he just ate the guts of those. we will be making these often!

This is delicious. The only reason I won't probably make this again was the work it took to roast and skin 24 chiles(I used 6 inch Anaheim peppers). It took me over an hour.  If I bought canned whole chiles that would be faster but I'm too cheap to buy canned. Ha! Also I only used 2 chicken breast halves and that was perfect. Thanks for the wonderful recipe PALS.

These were so great! I used 6 big poblano peppers instead of 24 small chiles, and it turned out like a baked chiles rellenos. I left out the olives because we don't care for them.

Awesome! Followed exactly... didn't serve w/sour cream but I'm sure that would have just made it even better. Sprinkled w/cilantro... it was so yummy!

This recipe was really good.  I seemed to have a lot more chicken mixture than I had chiles though, so with the extra, I just kind of piled it on top of the chiles after they were stuff and places in the pan.  Also, I forgot about the sour cream, but they were good without it anyway.
