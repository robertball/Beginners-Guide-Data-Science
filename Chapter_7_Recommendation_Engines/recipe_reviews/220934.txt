I wish I could give this more stars!  Italian cheesecake is so different from the usual cream cheese based cake that there is really no comparison.  I didn't need as much cake as the recipe clearly states it makes, so I halved the filling, but retained the base as written.  I ended up with one 9" cheesecake and 4 individual tarts.  The balance of flavors is perfect, I was a little concerned it might be to strong an anise flavor but it isn't.  This isn't an inexpensive cake, so save your pennies for that super special occasion (mine is my DS birthday) and then enjoy this decadent treat.  Thanks, Bon Appetit - this is perfect!

I did not care for this recipe. The recipe yielded way too much, it was gritty (for lack of a better word) and the amount of lemon zest over-powered the flavor. It looked really good! I was disappointed.

I made this for Easter dinner dessert, it was very, very good. 
I will definitely make this in the future.
I made 1/2 of the crust part but next time I would make 1/3 to have a thinner crust. 
I made 1/3 of the cheesecake part, which filled my 8 inch springform perfectly. Waterbaths make me nervous, I put a roasting pan on the rack under the cheesecake.
I am not a fan of anise so I doubled the vanilla and lemon. Mine baked in 1 hour and 45 minutes, the texture was perfect.
I served with strawberry sauce and whipped cream.
I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless

it was decent.  I have never eaten cheesecake any other way besides how it's made traditionally in America.  I did make lemon curd and had blueberry pie filling as a topping.
