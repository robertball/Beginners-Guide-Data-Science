This was just ok. It tasted kind of like a cheeseburger but the lettuce and veggies just did not stay crisp at all despite being added right at serving time.  I also think the soup was just way too rich and it really needed more than just the meat and the minimal veggies. My 6 year old didn’t like it at all and the rest of my family thought it was ok.  I wouldn’t make it again.

My husband and daughter and I loved this, and we even had seconds.   The only thing I would do different is maybe add two pounds of ground beef instead of one.   Otherwise, it’s delicious!

I didn’t worry about pushing the meat down into the bottom of the pan, I just browned it and went from there. This was such a good soup!

I added garlic, and left off the bacon and lettuce. It was not a big hit with my kids unfortunately. I liked it, but most likely will not make it again since I would be the only one who ate it.
