I love balsamic vinegar and I love the flavor of orange, however this vinaigrette was a complete was of ingredients. The balsamic overpowered the orange flavor and the mustard came through - but not in a good way. I tried to save it with some sugar, a bit of salt and some orange juice...

My husband and I recently started eating healthier, and that included eating more salads and with vinaigrettes rather than commercial salad dressings which can contain lots of saturated fat and sodium.  That being said, this is a pretty good recipe.  It is quite tart though, so I added a couple tablespoons of honey and that seemed to do the trick and was a nice compliment with the mustard and orange.  It is also quite a large recipe, so you may want to cut it in half if you don't plan to use it all week.  All in all, I'm glad I found this recipe and plan to continue to use it in the future.

Use White Balsamic Vinegar instead of dark.  Or you can use rice wine vinegar which is sweeter.  Be sure you have a good sweet orange.

Pretty good. Not enough orange flavor to balance out the strong vinegar flavor for me.

I liked this just fine. It has helped inspire me to start making my own salad dressings instead of buying store bought.

I made a few changes - more like I used the spirit of the recipe.  I used 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup white wine vinegar and 1/2 cup olive oil.  Added 1 TBS minced scallions and 1 Tsp sugar.  Going to use for a cumber salad and that will be served on the side with Southwest Bean soup and rustic bread.

This was very good!  I was given a friend's CSA shares and didn't know what to do with chicory and tat soi.  I decided to chop them both up and wilt them in some olive oil and a little butter, a clove of minced garlic and a couple Tbsp of diced onion.  I put that in a bowl and poured this dressing over the top along with some pine nuts.  YUM!  It's really good.  I will make this dressing again to try on other things!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  If you like the flavor of Balsamic vinegar, you'll like this.

Needs less vinegar or more oil.  I added more oil and orange juice & zest. But very good.

I decided to make 3 servings worth of dressing.  The balsamic vinegar overpowers all the other tastes and it's hard to taste anything really...I had to make too many adjustments with the rest of the ingredients so it's probaly that the balsamic vinegar does not work with these ingredients, or way less than half of what the vinegar is called for should be used.  Perhaps utilizing the regular clear vinegar would be better.  But I dont think I will try to make this again.

This was an okay dressing. It was easy to make, but the vinegar completely overpowered the other flavors. I added more oil and mustard, but to little avail. Tasted all right on the salad I served, but I don't know that I'd make it a second time.

I used white balsamic because I prefer that taste better with citrus flavors. I also used a pretty fruity extra virgin olive oil and added salt and pepper to taste.  This is a good recipe and I will tuck it away for future reference.  I have also made a similar recipe with TJ's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar in place of the balsamic and it has a wonderful citrusy flavor as well.

This is with out a doubt a very good option to go with almost any salad.
