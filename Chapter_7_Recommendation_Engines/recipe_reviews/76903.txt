I simply use left over London Broil or roast beef that I simply slice it very thin. Actually I always prepare a BIGGER london broil or roast beef specifically for this next meal. I sautee fresh sweet peppers (red, green, orange, each, all...whatever I have on hand) and onion slices in butter, remove those, add the thin sliced beef and just a bit of au jus to simply warm the meat. Sometimes I use a baquette I've cut down into 6" portions, other times I buy individual rolls. I slice them open, careful not to slice all the way through, then I scoop out the excess bread (leaving a bread shell that opens like a clamshell). I spread a thin layer of horseradish, stuff it with the warmed beef, top that with the sauteed onions and pepper, then place a layer of cheese over the top. I've used, swiss, mozzarella, and pepper jack - we love them all. The sandwich then goes on a  baking sheet and into a medium oven for the cheese to melt and the bread to crisp (keep an eye on it, it doesn't take long!), then serve with au jus. Buy the best au jus mix you can. To fancy it up substitute wine or brandy for SOME of the water.

"Slice the rolls open, and place sliced side up on a baking sheet."...is what the recipe says.  So yes, it's like leaving open-faced.  A torpedo roll, hoagie roll, submarine roll, cheesesteak roll, long roll...I guess it's a regional thing, sorry. Anyway, since the roll is buried under all the topping....it doesn't get a chance to burn.

Super quick, easy and delicious! Left out the garlic powder but other than that what a nice sandwich. I didn't think the hubby would like it with the red peppers but he qwolfed it down. Definitely, a nice fix for when I am in a hurry and still want something yummy. I didn't need anything else to go with it, the sandwich was so filling.

Torpedo rolls are rolls... shaped like a torpedo. I tend to prefer doing this kind of sandwich on baguettes -- better stuff-to-bread ratio, and, well, I love their crustiness.

If your cheese isn't melting, try leaving it out on the counter for a while so it starts at room temperature. If your slices (of any cheese) start out too cold sometimes you can have the edges altogether melted while the middles aren't even soft. 

Also, this kind of provalone may or may not get gooey when it's melted -- that's mozzarella's job, after all. This cheese should be warm and soft, ideally.

(Unrated because I didn't actually make this, but if I DID make it I'd probably add a bit oregano.)

My hubby is not too kean on store bought deli roast beef so I purposely bought a 4 lb prime rib and cooked it traditionally on Sunday with that being the Sunday meal for hubby and I. We made a bit extra ajus and save a good bit of the meat and ajus to make these sandwiches. On Tuesday I sliced the remaining meat as thin as I could and added to the ajus in a pan. I let it slow simmer for about 1/2 and hour and then assembled the sandwiches as per the recipe. They came out really good and was a nice change. Will make again but probably only when we do a rib as indicated above.

This is a great sandwich.  Toasting it under the broiler makes it just perfect.  I will definitely be adding this one to the rotation!

This was a quick and tasty recipe. I used french rolls (easy to find at the grocery store) and swiss cheese (my boyfriends favorite), and a whole jar of roasted red peppers. I added a little fresh garlic, oregano, salt and pepper to the au jus..YUMMY! I will definitely make this again!!!

Very good, nice for a quick dinner.  I used sourdough sandwich rolls and lightly butter and toasted them before adding the cheese & meat.  They were perfect!

The best bread to use with beef sandwiches, is cabatta bread. They come in square shapes. They dont get soggy at all! And they are nice and crispy if you put in the oven for a little while.

Good sandwich--I cooked up some shaved steak that I seasoned with onion & garlic powders, salt & pepper with a little liquid smoke seasoning. My only thing I recommend is toasting the bread a little before.

My family really didn't care for this recipe.  I usually like strong cheeses, but the sharp provolone was awful.  In addition to the problem with the cheese, we just found the sandwich bland.  The au jus sauce was good (credit to McCormick), and I served pepperoncini on the side, but it wasn't enough.

My husband and I learned to make a similar version of this 30 years ago when we worked together in a little college tavern in Indiana. Then, we made it from scratch. Today, we buy sliced roast beef from the deli, and make a broth from beef soup base, minced garlic, oregano, thyme and pepper, and we simmer sliced onions, red and green pepper slices until the vegetables are cooked, then stir in the beef and simmer until hot. Provolone or mozzarella slices are great and don't forget to top the sandwich with banana pepper slices and hot sauce! It's the perfect Super Bowl sandwich!

Made this recipe for dinner last night.  We really enjoyed it.  I forgot to add the garlic powder and we didn't miss it.  I also couldn't find extra sharp provolone, so I just used regular provolone.  Best part is that I got home from the store with the ingredients at 6:50 pm and we were eating by 7:10!  Thanks!

My husband and my mom loved this, i thought it was just o.k. I forgot to season it with the salt pep. and garlic powder which might have made the difference for me. Good recipe. Will be keeping it and changing it around to my liking. I loved dipping it into the gravy, that made it for me, i just wish when you dipped it didn't make the roll soggy.

These were ok, but a little bland. I gave this 4-stars instead of 3, since I used regular Provolone, rather than the sharp kind. A little pesto or dijon mustard would probably have taken care of the problem.

I did come up with a great alternative for the au jus, though. I used 1/4 cup beef broth, 2 TBSP olive oil, and some garlic powder, and this mixture worked great for soaking the beef. It probably wouldn't cut it as a dipping sauce, but did a great job of making sure the beef was moist and juicy!

I didn't think the recipe was poorly written at all. The instructions were very clear, I thought. Anyway, although neither of us especially cared for the red pepper, we enjoyed this. I think, however, I would prefer sauteed onions and cheese though - a Philly cheese is hard to beat. Anyway, thanks, Kelt!

Very nice sandwiches.  I'm not a roast beef fan, but hubs is, so every once in a while I'll buy it for him.  I pulled out sliced lunch meat for this recipe and made homemade au jus (used Chef John's Beef Au Jus recipe) for the recipe.  I'm not a big fan of dip sandwiches, but I thought these were pretty good and hubs loved them.  A little heavy on the steps, especially making the au jus from scratch, but these really didn't take that long--about 15 minutes to make 3 sandwiches for the two of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

I roasted my own red pepper (see oven roasting instructions on this website),  I broiled bread with garlic butter, added cheese, heat to melt, added meat and pepper.  No au jus.  Sandwich is killer without it!

This was a great sandwich and easy to make. Used sharp cheddar in place of provolone since that was what I had. Will be trying this one again with provolone next time.

Sooo good.  I think I will try with mushrooms next time.  I couldn't find a jar of roasted red peppers so had to do this from scratch, but still pretty easy.

Made recipe exactly...very good.  The changes I will make next time will be to add sauted onions and possible add a milder cheese, although my husband liked the provolone. I also will be sure and get a firm crusty bread, the roll type I chose was a little to soft.

This turned out tasty, but the recipe is poorly written.  I have never seen or heard of torpedo rolls or extra sharp Provolone.  Does the author mean for one to make open-faced sandwiches, or regular sandwiches with a top and bottom, or to cut the rolls only partially through and then layer the stuff in the center??  I used the top and bottom approach, and the tops began to burn WELL before the cheese was melted or the rest was hot.  Thanks to my husband's quick thinking, I did not wreck supper.  He pulled them out from under the broiler and buttered both sides of the rolls.  Then we BAKED them until they were done.  Next time I would cut the rolls in half, butter both the exteriors and cut sides, and broil them on both sides until browned.  Then I would assemble the sandwiches as directed, and then nuke them until all is warm and the cheese is melted.

This worked for a quick and easy beef dip recipe, but the flavors and method of making it just wasn't there for us. I had left over roast beef (made day before) and some fresh bell peppers (sliced, drizzled a little olive oil, and lightly seasoned with salt; roasted in oven at 450 F for 30 min total on sheet tray, tossed peppers about half-way through roasting time; and removed to cool). Make sure the beef is really thinly sliced and at lease medium rare. Keep a close eye on broil too--silly us almost burned the cheese finishing the other side dishes. Made the au jus using same ingredients there would be in the packet, just less salty with homemade. Bread (GF and regular torpedo rolls) toasted OK (a lil under toasted for what we would like) and did not burn, but again keep a close eye on broil. Next time, I'll lightly toast bread first, then layer with beef, peppers, and cheese, and place in oven until cheese is melted. Overall, recipe is quick and easy to make though and would make again in a pinch!

I followed another reviewer's recommendation to toast the roll first.  I toasted the roll with butter and garlic.  I sautéed onion in olive oil, and added the roasted red pepper at the end to heat it through.  Because I had the moisture from the onion/pepper sautee, I omitted the au jus. This was an amazing sandwich, I plan to put it on my regular menu.

Family absolutely loves this! Such a nice quick meal after work. I do make more au jus. I buy the "Restaurant Style" jar au jus as it's a bit less salty and then make about 2 cups so plenty for dipping.  Even my sons who usually don't like peppers asked for more on their sandwich!  Thank you!

Delicious!  Quite a treat after a long day of work, and the whole family liked the provolone cheese.  I used sliced leftover steak.  This is something I will definitely be making often.

Wow... Delisious.  What a great way to use leftoveer roast beef.  I had it as the recipe was written and it was wonderful.  The next day I tried my own variation with hot peppers and cheddar cheese- great as well.
