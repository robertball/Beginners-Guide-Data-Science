I sauteed my onions and mushrooms before adding it to the mix since I don't like raw onions steaming in a meatloaf. I also added 2 small cloves of minced garlic & some black pepper to the mix - this is just my personal taste. After adding all of the ingredients-the mix was so wet it wouldn't even form into a loaf. I gradually added additional bread crumbs until it was just able to form into a loaf.   I needed to add over 1/2 cup of extra bread crumbs. Since the recipe stated it should take about 5-6 hours I didn't check it until about 4 hrs and 20 minutes at which point I figured I would add the glaze. The meatloaf already registered 200 degrees! My fault that I didn't check it sooner I suppose, so, I strongly recommend you check well before the 5 hr. mark. I decided not to leave it in any additional time for fear that it was already a hockey puck, so, I put the loaf on a cookie sheet, topped with glaze and broiled about 5 minutes just to heat and get lightly sticky. I was surprised that even after cooking to such a high temperature the meatloaf was moist and had a perfect texture (thanks to the addition of more bread crumbs). I do think it could use some additional seasoning-maybe a little ketchup or steak sauce. Due to the changes in cooking time & the need for additional bread crumbs I would rate as a 3, but, a few changes would make it 5. Excited to learn though that I can make this successfully in a slow cooker!

An easy twist on regular meatloaf.  

I baked in a loaf pan the traditional way, at 350F for an hour and fifteen minutes.  Spread the glaze on during the last 15 minutes.

Just like Mom's and slow cooker convenient! I've substituted oatmeal or chopped up old bread with onion powder, garlic powder and sage for the seasoned bread crumbs and it's great!  Definitely a new Sunday noon meal for our family!

This recipe turned out great. Instead of using ketchup for the  glaze, I used Hickory BBQ Sauce. I'll definitely make this meat loaf again.

This was an awesome meatloaf......my kids liked it and I have been eating leftovers for a couple days now.

It was moist and flavourful, I made the glaze this time but I might try the gravy next time because I will most definitely make this again!

Loved this. I added a package of lipton beefy onion soup mix to the meat mixture and fresh onions.  Added potatoes and more onions a couple hours before it was done along with a can of french onion soup mix. It was delish, and turned out more like a salisbury steak than meatloaf. I had to make those changes to get a very picky child to eat it, (she isn't a fan of "meatloaf")

I just realized that when I've made this (about a half a dozen times now) I never add the milk. But I do add 2 cloves of garlic minced. Delicious.

I didn't use a slow cooker , I just shaped it and put it in a baking pan. I also microwaved ketchup and brown sugar heated till sugar dissolved. Then spooned some on top on the last 10 minutes, served the rest.

Nice to be able to use the crockpot, but overall just OK.
