simple to make, and delicious. I did not bake in over proof skillet; I transferred mixture to a glass baking dish, and it still turned out wonderfully. I did have to bake for approx. 40 min. though.

Delicious.  I put this picture up and you can see that I added mushroom and tomatoes.  The sour creme really adds a nice flavor.  Looking forward to trying it with spinach, feta cheese and artichokes!

I was having brunch guests with very little notice - looked here for an easy recipe I could modify and here it is! I cooked and crumbled a pound of sausage and used shredded cheddar and swiss plus 10 eggs. It didn't look like the casserole dish was full enough, but it puffed up just fine. I ALWAYS add a sprinkling of ground nutmeg to eggs...it enhances the taste. This was easy and I could do it again in my sleep!

This is fantastic and I have had to make it for the past 3 weeks.  DH has to have this every morning now.  So simple and easy.  Warms up great also.  Meets south beach diet requirements.  Thank you for sharing.

Like most everyone else, I adjusted the add-ins to what I had on hand (caramelized onion and swiss cheese) but the basic egg base I kept the same. I started it in my grandmother's cast iron skillet and finished it in the oven. I also added a good dose of fresh black pepper and a touch of fresh ground nutmeg.  Loved the addition of the sour cream, it did give the eggs more body and added a nice tang.Thanks, Colette!

I made my first fritatta this morning using this recipe. I served it for my mom and grandma and it was a huge hit. Today is meatless Monday so I replaced the sausage with Morningstar Farms meatless sausage patties and included mushrooms, onions, bell pepper, fresh spinach and green onions for garnish. I put it in a pie dish and it came out beautifully. Great recipe!

This Fritatta was outstanding! The sour cream made it creamy and delicious. I didn't have sausage so I used ham. I sauted the onion and added some red peppers and ham to the pan. I also added some dried mustard to the egg mixture. I used shredded mexican cheese and some swiss cheese.  I will make it again!

This recipe is delicious and versatile. Easy enough for family on a busy morning, and good enough to serve guests. I've made this numerous times using various meats, vegetables and cheeses and it always turns out great.

Very good. Instead of sausage, I added bacon and sauteed spinach. I didn't have fresh onion so I used minced dried onion.  I'd make this again, maybe add some hash browns.

Very good, I cooked mine in a glass pie pan.  I added green & red peppers, onion and used left over ham.  I had to cook mine for 40 minutes.  Very tasty.  Next time I would put more of the cheese in the pie and less on top.

Excellent recipe!  I like to add green/red pepper and have also used leftover ham instead of the sausage - either way, it's wonderful!  Great for those "I don't feel like doing serious cooking" weeknights!

Used smoked turkey sausage & didn't cook the onions, just scattered them raw on top of the sausage.  I also added banana peppers.  This was good, just nothing special.  Also, I transferred the meat to a 8x8 in pan & cooked for 20 min.

I quite liked this recipe, I did make a few changes.  I added croutons to the bottom of the dish, then layered with sausage, mushrooms and onions.  Topped with the egg mixture (used lots of ground black pepper) and topped with sliced cherry tomatoes and mature cheddar cheese.

This is a great recipe! So simple! I usually cut it in half, using about 1/3 lb of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage, cut baking time to about 14 minutes. Once I overcooked it by 15 minutes and it was still good. Thanks Colette!

Easy to make, delicious to eat. Since a oven ready skillet was not available, a 1.5 quart casserole dish worked great in an extra 10 minutes. I added 1/4 cup of green and 1/4 cup of red peppers. Great tasting on the reheated leftovers!

This recipe came in my daily recipe e-mail today, just as I was thinking about making something for breakfast, so I decided to try it, and am so glad I did! I added chopped jalapenos, red pepper, onions, and green onions, along with the smoked beef sausage. I didn't use all of the cheese that it called for because we are trying to cut down on that, but it was wonderful without it. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe! It's going in my recipe box!

Have made this several times with varying meats/vegetables and we LOVE it.  It's a great breakfast for us gluten free folk, also makes a wonderfully hearty dinner when you're in a pinch and don't want to dirty up a bunch of dishes.  I do it ALL in our cast iron pan...from stove to table top.  My kids love it, as long as there is plenty of cheese.  Tonight's version is leftover Thanksgiving turkey, broccoli, sharp cheddar, and quinoa cooked in stock.  Nutritious and versatile...and filling...AND comforting and warm...just a great recipe!  Will become a staple.

Love the addition of sour cream to the eggs.  I changed this a bit...kind of combined two receipes.  I first brown 4-6 slices chopped bacon in an iron skillet.  remove when crisp and drain.  Using 2 tbs of the bacon grease cook 2-3 small diced potatoes and half chopped onion and cook until almost done.  Pour on egg mixture and crumbled bacon and half the cheese.  stir and Cook eggs slightly on stovetop and bake in 400 oven till knife comes out clean.  Top with Cheddar cheese and broil till melted.

This looks so good when it comes out of the oven. I made a half recipe, threw in half a green pepper that needed using with the onion and sausage. Served this with sauteed tomatoes and mushrooms. My husband was a very happy man, thankyou Colette.

Delicious!  I used this basic recipe, but put in onion powder instead of onions, omitted the smoked sausage, put in leftover spaghetti noodles.  Got great reviews & requests for the recipe.  Would be a great way to use up almost any kind of leftovers.

I guess I'm the only one who didn't like this. I thought I would try this for dinner, and I just didn't like the consistancy of the eggs. Will not make this one again.

this was super-easy to make.  I did add some cubed ham, frozen red & green peppers and some onion.  I used a turkey kielbasa, which i did not care for, but the recipe itself was excellent.  Will make again, with a  different sausage.

This recipe arrived just as I was thinking about what to make for supper. I 've never made a fritatta before - I wish I had known how easy it is! I used a glass casserole, and added a cup of hashbrowns. I didnt use the full 1 1/2 cups of cheese, it turned out a little dry. But it was very good. This is a 'keeper ' recipe for sure.

Used turkey sausage, low fat sour cream and fat free cheese.  It was good, but not outstanding.  Will likely make again but will add red peppers and broccoli- whatever veggies I have on hand. Quick and easy gave it the 4th star.

My first frittata! Very easy.  I added green peppers and garlic powder with the onions and sausage.  Did the whole thing in my cast iron skillet, both on the stove and in the oven.  Made it with fat free sour cream and was still delish.  Served with couscous and steamed broccoli.  Reheats really well!

I used turkey sausage instead to cut back some calories.  This is an amazing and quick meal!  I also have also substituted different cheeses for variety.

I cooked 4 slices of bacon separately, and fried two potatoes. Then I added 1/4 cup of onion and cooked the potato and onion mixture for 3 minutes, added in the bacon, sprinkled the cheese over, then poured the egg mixture over it all and baked for 18 minutes. Finally added the rest of the cheese and returned to the oven, which was turned off, for 1 minute to melt the cheese. It was tasty, but I usually make the equivalent as a skillet and that takes probably 20 minutes less time than this recipe, since I cook it all on the stove top. Probably not worth the extra time from my perspective.

This is a great base!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but I put it in a pie shell and made it more of a quiche.  The basic recipe is great becaues it can be tweaked...and it tastes YUMMY!

Delicious and easy!  The sour cream gave it a nice flavor and a great texture.  The beauty is that you can add anything.  My daughter is pescatarian so I skipped the sausage and used onion, spinach, zucchini, leftover salmon and feta cheese.  I will be making this one again for sure.

Made this with veggie sausage, yellow onion, green onion, red pepper, and parsley. I'm very finicky about eggs and this turned out perfectly! On top I also put some veggie bacon which crisped up nicely under the cheddar. It was a great way to use up some leftover veggies in the fridge.

I did not have smoked sausage so I used pork breakfast sausage instead and added green peppers. It turned out moist and delicious.  Next time I make it I will put sliced tomatoes on the top for the last few minutes.

Very easy and very good.  After only the second bite, my husband said it was a keeper!  I added a  little bit of diced red pepper and a couple of handfuls of well chopped fresh spinach.  You can't taste the veggies, but it ups the nutritional value a pinch.

What a tasty frittata!  I made with 8 eggs instead of 6, so I added a little more milk and sour cream.  To fill it out, I also crumbled some breakfast sausage in with the smoked sausage and onions.  It’s the best frittata I’ve ever made and my family loved it!fami

This recipe was loaded with fat, for a healthier version, I cut the amount of cheese and sausage in half (3/4 cup each), added shredded hash browns, black beans and spinach - it was  delicious, and far healthier (higher protein and fiber content).
This would also be good with jalapeño jack cheese and spicy Italian ham substituted for the sausage.

I don't know if it was my ancient oven or the dish itself, but I had trouble getting it to cook all the way through without burning the edges. It still earned high praises from the family.

Pretty much followed the recipe in a cast iron skillet. Easy and delicious. Stays hot and is ready for everyone as opposed to frying individual eggs. It did take longer than 18 minutes to set up in the oven; about 28 minutes.

I made it for four servings. Added peppers, mushrooms, sriacha, worcestershire sauce, garlic powder (didn't have fresh), paprika. and dried parsley. The basic ingredients made a good base. I poured the egg-milk-sour cream mixture over the sausage and vegetables, layered horseradish cheddar on top and baked it in the skillet.  Quite good. Apologize for additions--many reviewers don't like it but I hate to waste a meal on flavorless food. Being a low-carber (not by choice but necessity), the food HAS to be spectacular.

This is so versatile. I was looking for a light meal for brunch on Easter and this was it. I made changes though, I used a pound of cooked, chopped bacon, sauteed fresh spinach, garlic, onion, a few drops of hot sauce and, since I didn't have sour cream, I used cottage cheese. Baked it in a pie plate about 30 minutes @ 400 degrees. I watched it carefully though to be sure it didn't overcook. It was delicious! Served it with fresh strawberries and brunch was perfect.

This turns out wonderful every time. I add garlic, onion powder, chili powder, salt and pepper to the eggs. I also made it up the night before and put the dish in the oven before preheating. It too 40 minutes to cook but worked out beautifully!

Great recipe and I love how easily it can be adapted with whatever ingredients are on hand- I switched out cooked pieces of Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage Links for the smoked sausage!

Thanks Colette for posting!  This is a great recipe!  So many variations you could do and love the addition of the sour cream.   I'll admit it... we substituted freely (we had ham, spinach, a mix of Mexican and gouda cheese).  Threw in a dash of cajun seasoning.  Threw it in a 9x13 pan so needed a little longer than 18 minutes to cook.  Great way to clean out your fridge.

I pan fried some chicken sausage. Placed them in a glass pie dish. I sautéed kale and onions and then added sliced Yukon potatoes until tender with some olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper. Sprinkled the cheese over the sausage, layered the kale mixture, and added the eggs with sour cream. Topped it with sliced Roma tomatoes! Yummy!!!

Just made this for dinner but in a baking dish as I don't own an oven safe skillet. It was delicious. We all liked it. The only changes I made was using spicy chicken sausage and eliminating the pepper. Next time, I will add some broccoli or asparagus for an even better flavor. Thanks, Colette, for a GREAT recipe!

Made it for breakfast this morning, very tasty.  I stuck to the recipe as it called, however I did have to cook 25 mins instead of 18 before the center set in my iron skillet.  I'm looking forward to trying again but using different items, like peppers and mushrooms, this was just a tad plain for us but very good.  Will keep the base the same.

Great fast breakfast.  I would do it with ham or pork sausage next time though....my husband loved the smoked sausage, but to me it's not for breakfast!!  Adding veggies would be good too!
