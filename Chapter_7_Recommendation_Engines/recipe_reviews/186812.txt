I didn't make the mayo sauce, and I didn't eat it as a sandwich, but I did season the tilapia fillets with Old Bay and garlic and pan fried them in butter.  I poured the butter from the skillet over the fish when I served it.  It didn't need any extra sauce as far as I was concerned...delicious as is.

I made this tonight using some frozen tilapia purchased at a local store.  The store packages each fish fillet individually, making this a fantastically easy recipe!  I don't really like spicy, so I did not make the sauce.  I did use the tomato and mayonnaise on the bread, however.  The seasoning for the fish was perfect; I added some salt as well.  I don't think it would reheat well, so it will remain a quick dinner or weekend lunch meal.  I served it with vegetarian vegetable soup and pickle spears.  Fresh fruit for dessert.

Yum, as one reviewer mentioned, great as fish tacos w/ crispy or flour tortillas.  Use olive oil or coconut oil to cook fish and low fat or fat free mayo and  Low fat cheese. Tortillas can replace bread or crumble fish in your choice of greens and low-fat dressing for a delish salad. Ask community for suggestions to make dishes more "heart" friendly.  We love to share.
Thanks Nan13 for sharing a great fish sandwich.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I can't picture myself ever eating a battered fish sandwich again.  Loved the spicy "kick", the freshness of the tilapia and the "out of this world" salsa. YUM!

My husband and I loved this! We didn't have all the ingredients on hand (tomatoes, chopped onion, pepperjack cheese), however, it was still very good. This was also something quick to whip up for lunch. Definately adding to our weekly rotation.

My favorite way to fix these is w/soft taco shells. The mayo is the best part. Mix mayo w/cilantro and finely diced tomatoes. Have side of pico de galo (not sure of spelling). Breaded halibut works great. Frozen is fine.

I'm only giving this four stars because I had to alter the recipe due to not having everything on hand. No piri or cayenne, and no tomato. I also added fresh cilantro to the mayo. WE LOVED THESE SANDWICHES!!! I will definitely make these again and again. Thanks!

The sauce for this was great, the fish would have been better done in olive oil with a light breading.

Perfect. I used sunflower seed bread and it was great, I did however scoop out some of the bread to make room for the innards. This was fabulous and messy and so good I couldn't even stop myself to take a picture.

This was very good and that is coming from someone who very very rarely eats fish. We do eat tilapia once in a while because it's so mild. Aside from some seasoning adjustments to suit our tastes I made it as written. The pepper jack cheese is a great idea. I'll make this again and enjoy every one of the 800 satisfying calories.

Very simple and a big hit with the boyfriend. I did make a few changes though. Left out the onion as he doesn't care for it much, had no chile pepper so I used a few drops of siracha sauce, and added a small squirt of lemon juice in. Came out very tangy with a hint of heat. Definitely taste as you go as the siracha can be pretty hot if you're not already a fan. Put over top of the fish, it was something I'll make again.

about as gooded as non breaded fish fry can get.  The sauce is great.  Using Miracle Whip light and low cal high fiber bread can bring down some of the empty calories.

yummy. i made a change to the mayo sauce since i don't like pickle relish or fresh tomatos. i left out the two ingredients i don't like and added about a teaspoon of ketchup. the seasoning on the fish was just enough spice and flavoring. overall everything came together and made one yummy sandwich!

This was super spicy and that = super good for me! I did not make the sauce for this recipe because I used the left over cream sauce from a different recipe from this site. I seasoned the tilapia with cayenne pepper very good. Taking this for lunch tomorrow.              Thank you Thank you!!!

It was not that good.  The recipe calls for way too much cayenne pepper.  My husband I were dissapointed in it.

Awesome tilapia, but the sauce really makes the dish. My husband and I loved this!! However I did change it up to meet our dietary needs: Fried the tilapia in PAM with 1/2 tbsp. butter, used light mayonnaise,one slice of Pepper Jack Cheese per filet, no bun and no added salt. Also I could not find the Piri Piri Chile Pepper, so I used Cayenne Pepper - just the right kick. Will make frequently.-Susi

Really good sandwich.  I left out the onion and tomato, didn't have any. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder, which made it too salty.  I will use just garlic powder net time, which is how the recipe is written.  Will make this again!  A good way to eat fish without breading and frying.

A regular in my household. Quick and easy to make. You can adjust the amount of pepper to taste and use more or less mayo to get the desired consistency. ( I like to use less mayo to bring out the flavors of the other ingredients and make it lighter and fresher tasting)

YUUUMMMM!  I used cayenne instead of Piri Piri.  I also didn't have any dill relish so I finely chopped some dill spears.  I made some guacamole and used flour tortillas instead of bread.  These are my new favorite fish tacos!

Didn't have any of the spicy ingredients so made it without. It was basically like eating a fish sandwich with homemade tartersauce. Plus i used potato bread for the toast. I liked it a lot!

I actually only prepared the tilapia to eat with something else, so this rating isn't for the sauce or the cheese-fish sandwich. The fish turned out bland... it was nice to have such a delicate fillet, but not a method I'd regularly use on tilapia.
