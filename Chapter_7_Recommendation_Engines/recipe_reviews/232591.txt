This is my recipe.  I wanted to make a burger that was a little different and hubby and I loved this one.  If you don't have sriracha, don't worry you can use another type of hot sauce.  I had originally put the srirache as "adjust to taste" but it does not appear to have made it in the recipe.  If you have fresh ginger and garlic, by all means use fresh.  Give it a try!

DELICIOUS! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing...great flavor and spice! Mixed them up and formed them the night before to allow the flavors to blend. I served them on buns w/ a slice of pepperjack, tomatoes and a touch of mayo. The family raved...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a fantastic, flavored packed burger!  I made as written, only subbing fresh ginger for the ground ginger.  Mixed them up in the morning and formed the patties to let the flavors meld.  Before grilling, I put a hole in the center of the meat so the burger (85/15%) would not shrink up.  It worked like a charm and the burger grilled to the same size as the bun.  Ten minutes per side was the perfect timing on our grill.  Saveur, another AR member, suggested this burger and I'm so glad I saved it.  The burgers were served with 'Mad Hatter Salad' from AR and fresh fruit. It is an Asian based salad.  It went really with the burgers.  Occasional Cooker, you have another award winning recipe to add to your collection.  Thanks for sharing.

This was just what I hoped it would be! Perfect Asian flavors with just a very slight amount of heat! I made this recipe as written except I didn't have hoisin sauce so I made my own using a recipe from the Internet. And I omitted the red pepper flakes because I'm very wimpy when it comes to spicy food. But I used the full amount of Sriracha sauce. I mixed the ingredients together, formed the patties and chilled it for about 4 hours before grilling so that the meat could soak in all the lovely flavors! These burgers were so moist and delicious! Thanks OC for this fabulous burger recipe that I will use often!

Made this recipe last night and hubby and 
myself absolutely loved it.  Flavors are absolutely 
on point. The only thing hubby kept asking 
was when are you going to make this again?

What a great burger recipe!  These were so moist and flavorful, delicious.  Patted them up in the afternoon and hubs grilled to perfection.  Served with a dollop of yum yum sauce.  A do-over for sure.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, OC!http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Yum-Yum-Sauce/Detail.aspx

The flavor was excellent, but this needed a binding ingredient; my patties fell apart on the grill. Very frustrating.

So interesting!
(I was out of Hoisin sauce so I added a little soy sauce and peanut butter (I looked it up, it's a good sub!) and added a smidge more of the garlic, ginger and sesame oil).

After reading other reviews, I only added 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, and it was almost too spicy for me. Surprisingly, my teens ate them up, served on wheat hamburger buns I'd toasted, green beans, and mac-n-cheese. This is a nice twist on regular burgers.

Excellent recipe! I used this for my ramen burgers and it was amazing! For those of you who have trouble forming patties, try using the lid of a jar/container, laying plastic wrap in, and forming a patty inside. I used a whey protein lid and it helped form perfect patties.

These were SO good! I love hoisin & sriracha, so had to try these. I made them as directed, but would add a little more sesame oil next time because I love that flavor, too. I cooked them on the George Forman grill and served on toasted ciabatta rolls with slaw mixed with the Yum Yum sauce Saveur mentioned. They went well with Baking Nana's pineapple fried rice & the Napa cabbage salad. Thanks for posting this, OC!

Phenomenal!  I have had this with no toppings or just mayonnaise.  It's great either way.  I made with fresh ginger and garlic.  Everyone in the family loved it and my son said I have to make this a lot.

Had these with friends at a barbecue and they were great. Made them at home for my husband in the oven and he loved them as well and told me I must make these at least once a week.

Really good, flavourful burgers! I love hoisin sauce but I didn't have any and was too lazy to make some so I subbed with oyster sauce. Also used finely chopped white onion instead of green. Otherwise made as listed and we really enjoyed them. Served with mayo/siracha sauce to up the spicy quotient. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was a great recipe, everyone loved it called it one of the best burgers I've ever made. I borrowed from the juiciest hamburger ever recipe and added an egg and 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs to make sure it stayed together and moist. Also put about a tablespoon of extra hoisin sauce under the piece of cheese as it melted for a final touch. Made it a bit sweeter, and great flavorful burger if you're looking for something a bit different.

So good! I didn't have hoisin sauce so I used 1 tbsp each of oyster sauce and fish sauce and I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder. It had just the right amount of heat and flavor.

Great recipe! Thoroughly enjoyed the burgers. We didn't have the chilli-garlic sauce on hand, so the hoisin sauce made our burgers a tad sweet. But, if we did have it, this would be just perfect.

Since I am vegetarian, I made this with a Beyond Burger that I had in the freezer. I don’t care for the Beyond Burger, so I have been holding it waiting to decide how to flavor it up. This was perfect. I enjoyed the burger very much.

Loved the “heat”. Grilled for 12 minutes only and melted pepper jack cheese on top. Served on bun with tomato and lettuce. YUM.

Most of the family said they were very good but I'd say perhaps not worth the extra effort.  Spicy condiments on top probably just as tasty.

Followed the exact recipe but added a splash of soy sauce.  After reading feed back regarding binding I decided to add an egg and 1/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs - they were bbq perfection! Everyone loved them. Thanks for sharing!

I buy prime rib burgers at a local butcher who has them already made into patties (they are huge, so my husband & I split one in half and use 8" wraps instead of buns). Once you've tasted prime rib burgers, it's impossible to go back to plain lean ground beef. We needed a change, so I tried this recipe that received rave reviews. I mixed 1 lb. of lean ground beef with 1 lb. of ground pork and I really like this combo as opposed to using only ground beef. I decided to double everything else since I doubled the amount of meat. I used 3 large cloves of garlic, minced , and approx. 1/2 Tbsp. freshly grated ginger root instead of the dried spices. I cut back just a bit on the sriracha sauce (approx. 1 1/2 Tbsp.) I weighed each burger so they were 4 oz. each and poked an indention in the centre of the patty, covered and refrigerated them while I prepared home made oven fries. We barbecue everything on heavy tin foil sprayed with vegetable oil spray, instead of directly on the grill. Everyone loved them, and I plan to make them again.  I found  the burger was just a bit too hot, but this was likely due to me using fresh garlic and ginger instead of dried. Ginger usually adds quite a bit of heat to a recipe. I wouldn't change a thing, except use 1 Tbsp. of sriracha rather than 1 1/2 Tbsp. for  2 lbs. of meat. They were moist, very full of flavour and a refreshing change from regular burgers. Delicious all on their own without any condiments  added to my burger. I did top it off with

This was so so good! I don't like sirracha so i used some frank's red hot sauce instead, and used fresh garlic instead of powder, but wouldn't make any other changes next time besides maybe some fresh ginger. Will definitely make this again!

Made exactly as directed - big hit at our house, and this will go into the regular rotation during grilling season.  Nice combination of flavors with just enough heat to make things interesting without giving us heartburn.  My hubby had his with pepper jack cheese, and mine was with American - mayo, fresh lettuce and tomato was a nice cool balance with the flavors, which may have been a bit...intense without them.  Next time I may give the flavors a little more time to meld prior to cooking, but it was very, very good just as it was.

Fantastic, great flavor. Mine cooked faster than 10 min per side but my grill was cranking hot and immediately had flames growing with my 75% lean meat.  Loved the spice and flavor, wasn't too hot(spicy) which i thought it might be, will definitely be making these again. Mine did break up a bit but i think if you let them cook a good bit before trying to flip they might stay together better.

Wanted to do something different with our burgers and I decided to try this recipe. This was a great tasting burger. I made recipe as written, did not change anything. My husband and brother both had two and wanted more, but could not fit anymore in their gut.

Really yummy served with a spicy pineapple coleslaw on top. I added the egg and a 1/4 cup of panko to the burger mixture as suggested by another reviewer, but I think it would have been just as good without.

I pan fried these spicy little delights instead of grilling. I added 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1 Tbsp panko. They did not fall apart and were really juicy.

I was looking to make turkey burgers when I ran into this recipe.  Absolutely outstanding!  I doubled the chile-garlic sauce.  What this did for ground turkey was amazing, I can't imagine how good it must taste with ground beef.
