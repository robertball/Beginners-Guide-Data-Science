Didn't have cilantro.  Substituted parsley flakes.  Didn't have chili peppers.  Substituted red pepper and chipotle  chili powder.  I'll have to try it some day with no substitutes but for now why argue with success.

Made this to use on top of chicken burrito bowls.  This was so delicious that we ended up eating this by itself when we were done with dinner.  It was amazing and quick and easy to make.

This was delicious, I made it for 8 - added an extra half of avocado, more pepper and used red onion vs. shallot.

Was amazing, big hit!!

Yes! This is excellent and fresh-tasting and so yummy. I made this for my kids, so omitted the spicy pepper. I'll make this a lot during the summer to wrap in a tortilla with some pinto beans, eat as a salad, or for dipping chips. Delish!

Great by itself!  I did some changes, first 1/2 the recipe as it was only two of us.  Substituted jalapeno for the red pepper and used Spanish corn with green/red peppers.  Left the rest the same.  Was to go on fish tacos, but we ate it as a side and i got some healthy veggies in my teen age son!  Win!

This was fantastic! The lime juice keeps the avocado green into the next day. Or get your chips and eat the whole bowl.

I took this to a luncheon & everyone liked it. It doesn't say what kind of chile pepper to use. I got a Fresno chile, and it seemed really hot, so I used only about Â¼ of the pepper. Also cut the amount of shallot a bit.
