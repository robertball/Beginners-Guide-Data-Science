We LOVE Kale and we LOVED this recipe. It has everything ingredient in it that we like, so this was a great and refreshing change from the usual salad for dinner. Lite and tangy and you can taste every ingredient. No need to tweek either. I made it as written. So good! Thanks weeble for a winner! I'll make this again and again!

A very good, gentle tasting salad.  For me, I would prefer a bit more bitterness in the dressing, but for my family it was perfect.

This was a lovely combination of tastes and textures.  The dressing was perfect - hint of sweetness but not overly sweet.  Loved the combination of mangoes and avocados and the chick peas added a bit of substance or "meatiness" to the salad.  I made it as per the recipe and it was delicious!  If I were to tweak, I would add some dried cranberries for an additional color contrast - but definitely didn't need it for the flavor.  I suspect you could also sub spinach for the kale and it would still be wonderful.

I made this before it was kitchen approved. A delicious salad, summer and all year long. I love salads and like to try different ones. I did not add the poppy seeds or sunflower seeds(personal preference)
Left all else as is~~~yummy. Thanks for sharing weeble...

I really liked this recipe! The kale I grew in my garden was really mild and not bitter. I did not have enough mango so I added some pineapple, Yum! I added about 1/4 cup of sugar and no marmalade. I also didn't have rice wine vinegar,  so I used red wine vinegar. No chickpeas, no cucumber, no poppy seeds. My husband is not a big vegetable person but he really liked it. We ate almost all of it between the two of us in one sitting! Delicious!

I didn't tweak this delicious salad at all! It made a lovely supper on a hot summer's evening. Thanks for sharing Weeble!
