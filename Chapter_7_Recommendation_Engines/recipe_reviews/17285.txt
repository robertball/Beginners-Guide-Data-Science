This bread is sooo good!  I didn't add walnuts and was glad.  Instead of in loaf pans I made it in brownie pans and cut into squares..and made cupcakes for the kids with cream cheese frosting. It was a huge hit with adults and kids alike! A+

This was my first time making pumpkin bread!  It was great.  I changed the sugar to 1 1/2 c brown and 1 c white.  I added 1 tsp double vanilla.  I didnt have any ground cloves, so I substituted 1/4 tsp all-spice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and did 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It turned out so moist and yummy!!  I love the addition of the cream cheese. Thanks!

It turned out fine - I will probably make it again and add walnuts next time.

this is not my first time making this bread and it has always been a huge hit, very nice flavor, I have made it with 2 cups pumpkin puree and canned pumpkin, no difference, both very yummy.  The only thing I noticed is I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than recommended.  Thanks for this recipe, will make over and over again.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  My kids won't stay out of them!  I substituted the margarine for equal amount of applesauce and instead of using 2 1/2 cups white I did 1 1/4 of white and 1 1/4 of brown.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg b/c of the reviews that said it might need it!  Think it made it great!  I also did not use the nuts, b/c I'm not a fan of nuts in my pumpkin bread!  Also, instead of loafs, I did mini muffins b/c that is the way my kids like them and they are easier to take places (I'm taking them to church for our youth department tonight)  They only take about 12 to 15 minutes that way and yielded almost 10 dozen or so!!!  I would do this one again!

This is a fantastic recipe. It yielded 3 loafs. I used homemade pumpkin and the cream cheese makes for a nice texture and added taste.

This is really really good!  The only thing I did different was add 1t of nutmeg, and I cooked it in a square dish instead of a loaf pan.  I cut into squares upon cooling.  My 6yo is already asking for another square.  Will definitely make again.

I halved this recipe BUT the conversion chart didn't half most of the ingredients so I did.  I used butter in place of the margarine, half brown and half white sugar and only a small amount of walnuts.  I used two mini loaf pans and divided the batter and cooked at 325 for 45 minutes.   The cream cheese did make the bread dense and moist. But, I felt it lacked good pumpkin and spice flavor.  I may try adding nutmeg and more cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice next time

This is hands-down the best pumpkin bread recipe on this site.  You can't really taste the cream cheese but it makes the cake extra moist and gives it a nice consistancy.

This is a very good pumpkin bread with a subtle flavor. I followed the recipe exactly - except I didn't have any cloves. Instead I used 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and then added an extra 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. My husband thought it would be good to spread cream cheese on it as well but I had used it all in the bread. We'll have to try that the next time I make it.

Just finished baking this bread, awesome! I used one of the suggestions in the reviews, I used 1-1/2cups of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I find the reviews very helpful.

This bread was good but I feel like it needed a little more flavor.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesauce.  I think maybe the addition of additional cinnamon might help.

This bread was very good. I added a cup of raisins at the end.  I also used 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 cup of Splenda. It came out fine. Thank you for sharing.

The flavor of this bread was delicious as a batter and then it was like all the flavor baked out. It still had good flavor, it just wasn't as good as anticipated from the batter taste-test. Also, this is not moist. I knew I should have added oil to the recipe. When someone tells me bread is moist, I expect something like Bob Evans bread. This border lined being dry. I thought I would make this to give to my girls friends - I will keep this to myself.

Really good. 1st pumpkin bread and will def make again. Made almost exactly except omitted nuts for preference, used butter, doubled cinnamon & cloves and added nutmeg. Next time will try a bit more "healthy" by lowering sugar, subbing some applesauce and adding some milk - was just slightly dry. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe.  I made muffins (which yielded 2 1/2 dozen) and baked about 20 to 25 minutes.  Before going into the oven, I placed a pecan half on top and eliminated the walnuts.  I also used butter instead of margarine.

Followed recipe exactly and thought this was good but felt as if it was missing a spice. Pumkin spice or nutmeg maybe?? Didnt taste the cream cheese at all. Overall good but nothing special. This was my 1st time making pumpkin bread so I will try different pumpkin bread recipes just to compare :)

This bread did not taste as good as it sounded like it would.  I was a bit disappointed.  Don't plan to make it again with all of the really great pumpkin bread recipes there are.

This was a hit! I didn't put in the nuts because my father-in-law can't eat those.  I also didn't have ground cloves so I left it out.  It made a lot of bread and it wasn't too much pumpkin flavor..just right.  Instead of using 2 loaf pans, I used one rectangular pan which was a lot! I will definitely be making this one again.

Well, my kids loved it, so it gets a 5. I thought it was a little dry and not enough spices, so I give it a 4. It still tasted good though. My oldest son almost ate a whole loaf himself! Thanks!

Big hit!  My first time ever baking from scratch and everyone loved it. Co-workers and kids were looking for more!  Only thing I noticed was that the top browns realy fast in the last 10 minutes of baking.  Could be my oven, though.

Good, but not spectacular.  I was expecting a difference in taste or texture from the cream cheese, but it was just plain pumpkin bread.

By far the best pumpkin bread yet! Very moist. I just added extra vanilla and used fresh pumpkin and squash.  Everyone loved it!

Wow I did not expect it to come out this good! I made it into 12 muffins and one small loaf (1 batch of the recipe). The only change of ingredients was that I used butter instead of shortening. For the muffins, I put them into a 400F oven for 5 minutes, then decreased the temp to 350. The came out with a beautiful puffed up dome, muffin top. The texture has a very soft and fine crumb. While in the oven, I was worried because they did not smell all that nice, but the flavor? OMG amazing! Texture and taste are absolutely perfect, fine bakery quality. Thanks for sharing this great recipe! I'd add chocolate chips to the batter and make a streusel topping next time, just to jazz it up! :)

This was SO good!!! My only two changes were subbing the cinnamon/cloves for 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. This recipe is so moist and delicious. Great holiday treat!

Love it. I added coconut instead of nuts. And would definitely make again.

I added 2/3 the sugar and unsweetened coconut. The best I've ever had!

A delicious, moist bread that was even better a few days later. I took the advice of a few others and doubled the cinnamon and clove- which I think worked perfectly.  I did use butter rather than margarine.

01-12-16 ~ I had some homemade pumpkin puree to use or lose it.  This was a nice recipe choice.  I toasted some walnuts and baked in mini loaf pans.  I got seven loaves out of one recipe - lots to share.  This was a moist loaf with the cream cheese in it.  My DH and DIL managed to eat one loaf, in no time flat.  I did bake two loaves sans nuts for my son and added the walnuts to the other five.  If I have extra puree on hand, I would make this recipe again.

I made some changes which is why I only rated it 4 stars.  Gingerbread should always include brown sugar and molasses.  I added 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, 1/4 cup of molasses and reduced water to 1/3 cup.  Very moist and great flavour.

Definitely one of the better banana bread recipes I've tried.  I didn't have sour cream, so used vanilla yogurt instead.  It worked beautifully and gave the bread a another layer of flavor.

Very moist and flavorful -- will be great for Christmas morning! I did substitute chopped pecans for the walnuts for family satisfaction.
