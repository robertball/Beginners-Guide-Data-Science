A true Croque-Monsieur isn't battered....it's a grilled ham & cheese sandwich, covered in a cheese sauce & broiled for a few minutes. While not typical, this version is tasty. I used honey wheat bread & because of reviews syaing the batter was heavy, I copied M.A.H. & used a liberal amount of butter-flavor Pam to fry them in. Hubby didn't think it would work but it did...beautifully! The crust was perfect... not greasy or heavy & they didn't stick although I did use a non-stick saute skillet. I served them w/ Michel Richard’s Cold Cherry Soup, (google the recipe) which was the perfect accompaniment. Thanks for the recipe Teresa Neff...we enjoyed it!

I tried this sandwich, as written, and it was good but a bit too rich for me. Another reviewer called this sandwich a fake, which is wrong. This sandwich can be baked and broiled or fried in a pan, with or without Mornay or Bechamel sauce. Gruyère is traditionally used and is a Swiss cheese, although camembert or brie can be used. The version served with the egg on top is called a "Croque Madame". Made with tomatoes it's a "Croque Provencal," made with Bleu cheese a "Croque Auvergant." So you see, as with any recipe, there are probably as many variations as their are cooks.

I made this sandwich with sliced turkey breast and provolone. I eliminated the frying part with oil and butter and used butter flavored Pam instead. I also eliminated the salt in the batter. It was delicious.

OMG, this was delicious. My only critique would be to eat it right away, or it will 'gell' up on you and not be as good (as with any fried food). I added onions to this and sauted mushrooms in olive oil (evoo to all you chefs out there!). I have been out of the country for about 3 months so I haven't had a chance to make my sandwiches, and I made several on this site before my son and I left. This was the best out of three or four that we tried so it gets rated first! After I unpack...I will be back!!!! To rate more of course....

Authentic or not, still mighty tasty sandwich. I don't keep white bread in the house, so I used wheat. I did not use vegetable oil to fry them in, instead I used a little butter in the hot pan. These came out really well--even though it was a bit tricky getting it battered and into the pan and they were a bit greasy. Next time, I'll just cook my sandwiches on the tabletop griddle and skip the extra calories. We had our sandwiches with tomato soup. Nice, comforting lunch. The kids especially liked this.

Very Good!  Liked it better with mozzarella on sourdough.  Made it for dinner with the "Best Ever Hot Artichoke Dip."  Available on this site also.  Very filling.

My husband loved his but I only ended up eating half of a sandwich. They are very filling and I thought they were greasy and messy. I may try again but not fry in oil and butter.

These were good - I liked it with a pasta salad.  However, they were a bit of a hassle, or maybe I should say messy.  I'm not much into having to dip stuff unless it's really worth it, and I haven't decided yet if these were worth it.  I made it exactly as is, except... the first side of the first one I forgot to dip it first. :-)  But after it had partially fried, I dipped it anyway and re-fried and it came out none the worse for wear.  I didn't find them too gooey or anything like that - they stayed together and kept their shape *once cooked*.    In fact, overall this wasn't as messy as a Monte Cristo recipe that I made once years ago.  The one thing I do have to add, though, is how annoying I find it when ingredients are out of order!  It's SOO much easier to follow them in order, and to make sure you didn't miss something, and it's not exactly difficult to get them in order.

Okay what I discovered was ... cut up the sandwich into quarters before dunking and cooking and make smaller portions BECAUSE otherwise it is VERY gooey in the center and I found people where pulling everything out of the sandwich once it was cut in half for eating.  Other than this...it was delicious and I'll be making it again for sure.

Awesome easy recipe.  I left off the mayo and salt and used whole wheat bread.  Huge hit with the hubs and 3 year old.  I have made this numerous times and usually different ways and it always comes out great.

I didn't find it to be gooey in the center at all.   I've now made this three times and have found that it's healthier AND got better flavor if you eliminate the mustard and mayo and use part skim swiss cheese. I also used egg whites instead of whole eggs and sprinkled those with some pepper and salt for added flavor.   If you use part skim cheese, it is harder to melt, so therefore, it won't be as "gooey" if you aren't a fan of goo.   I saved myself tons of calories with a tastier sandwich, in my opinion!

Not that great.  The frying sure doesn't do much for the overall flavor and not enough for the extra effort.  Would have been better as a standard grilled cheese.  Pretty lame...

If you're looking for an authentic, French-cafe croque-monsieur, this is not it. It is, however, absolutely delicious, quite filling without being fattening, and definitely worth a try.

While I give it a "yum" this is far more like a monte christo (egg coated like french toast) than a croque monsieur (grilled).  Check both recipes to see which it is you are in the mood for.  My preference is too avoid the sprinkled sugar and jam traditional with monte christos.  Love the cheese sauce on the traditional croque monsieur and madame.

delicious, easy to make and very filling! I really recommend, to give it a bit of a more serious tone, to put gruyere cheese with a bit of salami.  And to make it a little more complex, for a brunch or something you can change the bread, anything that is not too thick and that you can use for a sandwich!

i made it exactly as recipe called for and it came out pretty bland and too mushy inside. i give it 4 stars after a 2nd try.  i omitted the butter and mayo inside the sandwich. i kept the batter as is and after i browned both sides, i sprinkled parm cheese on top and broiled for a few minutes until outside was golden brown. i liked the extra cripyness outside. i have never had the real french version so i doubt my version meets the criteria.

I love making these for lunch!  I use pretty much any deli cuts I have; turkey, chicken, ham with swiss, or havarti and of course dijon mustard.  I dont like putting mayo in and i like frying in butter - but not too much.  served with a pickle on the side or a little salad - who could ask for more in a quick, easy and very tasty lunch!

Delicious!  It does taste similar to a Monte Cristo, but who cares.  I followed the recipe almost to a tee, except that I used American and mozzarella cheese since it was what I had on hand.  My husband liked this so much that he asked to have it again the next night--so we did!

This is actually more of a Monte Cristo than a Croque Monsieur. Monte Cristo's are battered. But the sandwich was still very good. My family really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

Very, very rich, but oh so good!  I made it w/ mustard on the side and smoked turkey instead of ham to accomodate everyone.  Absolutely fabulous!

These were ok, but I think the batter was too heavy and they could use some additional flavor, like maybe garlic salt.  It was fun to try though- we ate these for dinner with Leek Soup and a green salad.

Loved it, it isn't a true Croqure- Monsier but it is delish! Qe changed up the meat and added different spices to the batter. Made my mustard instead of dijon, and wow were we full!!

I don't know if it was a "true" croque-monsieur, but I do know that it was a really delicious sandwich. I'd happily make these again.

I have no idea about authenticity but this is a super rich delicious and elegant lunch. Just follow the directions and you will have a new twist on ham and cheesecloth won't soon forget.

It sounded good on paper, but the taste was too rich for me. The recipe is easy to follow but the flavor is not my style.

I paired this with French Onion Soup and it was very good but not as good as true Corque-Monsieur  but when in a hurry it is good. I will make it again.

Brill! I love putting the sandwich in the batter first and then frying it, adds a really nice taste. The mayo and mustard together makes it very yummy. I love the recipe! Thank you ??

Just made it today using artisan Sara Lee bread. Would definitely recommend a harder bread as well as maybe "lightening" the egg bath. I wanted more crispy, got more bready. All in all will definitely try again, just with different bread!  Bon appetite!

It was great! I did it for a school project and I thought it was easy and a great tasting food. I will definitely be using this as a little fast food recipe when I'm hungry and need to eat something  this will definitely come in mind! If you haven't tried this I recommend you try it. It is amazing.

We did this with a bit stronger aged whitish cheddar (Smith Bros).  Looks like a lot of oil on the pan at first, but the mid/high heat works out.  The batter was perfect amount for 2 sandwiches even though the recipe seems to make 3.  Cut sandwiches into 6 pieces, oven-baked (350F 5 min) to dry a bit, then ate by-the-hand.  Wife loved it, easier to make than other recipes, tastes relatively (French-Canadian) authentic.

Really good. Great for a table top griddle. 4 sandwiches fit it perfectly. Served with a side caesar salad. I tweak the condiments a bit to personal taste. Good meal.
