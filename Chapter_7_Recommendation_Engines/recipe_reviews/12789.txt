I started to rate this the first time we had it; it was so good.  But I wanted to play with it a bit.  This is  what I found out: 1) I can't improve it. 2) The capers are a nice touch. 3) I've tried it with and without the egg and cannot     tell the difference.  And since simpler is better in     my kitchen, I usually leave it out. 4) I think salmon has an affinity for dill, so I sub     dill relish for the sweet relish with salmon.     Delicious that way, too.      Many thanks, Diane.

excellent recipe!  I've tried nearly ALL tartar sauce recipes, this is the best by far.  I've experimented and created my own recipe for tartar sauce, this beats that too.

the egg is a great addition.

Well done!

that first review is shameful, what? too much flavor?  sounds like one of those ketchup only on hot dog people to me. :D

A very tasty tartar sauce. Try a healthy dash of a habanero sauce to give it a nice kick without being too hot. Capers can be salty so be sure to taste before adding any additional salt.

One of the best tartar sauce's I've had. I didn't have any sweet relish, just dill, and I think the sweet would have made it even better!

This is a great tartar sauce recipe for any fish type meal.  I love all of the ingredients. I also ended up splitting the sauce in half, added about 1 Tbsp of finely diced pickled jalapenos ... at a dinner table of 12, the spicy tartar was gone before it made it around the table!

Very good tartar sauce.  I left out the egg, and added a couple more dashes of hot sauce.  My friends thoroughly enjoyed it.  One suggestion:  make it the night before.  the flavors meld much better than chilling for 30 minutes.

I love this tartar sauce.  I didn't have time to boil an egg, so I left that out. I really loved the authentic flavor and I won't be buying jar sauce anymore.  I'm really trying to eat as much homemade food as possible.  I even used this with hand made mayo (ala Julia Childs).

Very good, I didn't add the hard-boiled egg and used dill pickles instead of sweet relish.

I was relieved to find this recipe, after reading all of the others on this recipe site.  (I didn't think you could make tartar sauce without capers and hard boiled eggs). This recipe is similar to our family recipe, with only a few easy additions. We use only Helmanns Real Mayonaise, and add the following "spice it up" ingredients: a little creole or dijon mustard and "Old Bay" seasoning.  I prefer to rinse the "sweet" flavor from the pickle relish/just run it under faucet in a tea strainer, but be sure to press the water out.

When I tasted this right after mixing it up, I wasn't impressed. Of course, it hadn't had time to meld. The following evening, I fried up some salmon patties and pulled this out of the fridge, dipped my finger in and said, "Wow!" outloud. Surpassed my expectations. Excellent! The bottled stuff doesn't even compare.

This recipe makes you one step closer to a real cook, as you will proud of the fact that you will never go to the store and buy tarter sauce again.

And you sound like you really know how to cook when you tell your dinner guests," oh I never buy it I only make it fresh!

DO NOT OMIT THE HARDBOILED EGG, It gives this tarter sauce It's "MEAT"

It took only a couple of minutes to have it assembled and ready. I didn't have a hard boiled egg available. I used light Miracle Whip. My husband liked this and said it was really good. I don't eat tartar sauce, so I will have to take his word for it. I didn't chill this, he ate it immediately. I scaled it down to 1 serving and it was still enough for two large pieces of fish.

Thank you, thank you. This recipe is wonderful. As a person who likes to add a personal touch to most everything I cook,  I wouldn't change a thing. This is a definite keeper. I wish I could give this six stars.

Absolutely the best tartar sauce I've ever had.  Everyone raved about it.  I "hard cooked" the egg in the microwave, so it was super fast and easy! A definate keeper.

This is the best tarter sauce. I've made it several times. I use whatever pickles i have on hand, sweet and hot peppers, homemade bread and butter pickles. I think the egg and capers make the dish. Even my daughter who hates anything with mayo likes it!

We love capers so I had to try this out.  Wonderful!  Only change was to leave out the egg since I only made 2 servings.  Served with Best Ever Crab Cakes and Wild West Coast Seafood Shrimp Cocktail Sauce.

Yummy!  I made the sauce as directed less the egg.  The capers are a must.  They provide a very flavorful addition to the sauce.

The perfect tartar sauce. Exactly what I was looking for, a traditional flavored sauce like you would find at a fish restaurant. I did not have the capers, but it didn't seem to be missing anything. LOVE IT. Thanks!!

I scaled this back to just two servings, which was plenty for two tilapia filets.  I used dill relish because I didn't have sweet and I ended up using about half of a hard boiled egg (I ate the other half :))  We both really enjoyed this with Parmesan Crusted Tilapia Fillets, also from his site.  The capers make it!

Thanks for this recipe!  I was in a hurry so I left out the egg - intrigued by that, will have to try it with the egg next time. I also added a tablespoon or two of lemon juice, some dill and parsley.  My favorite calorie reducer is to use 1/2 mayo & 1/2 nonfat yogurt.  Gives it a tang and loses some fat.  Had to chop a few pickles (out of relish) but that seemed fine.

I was making Beer Battered Haddock when I noticed we didn't have any tartar sauce.  I came across this recipe and it was GREAT!!!  My family loved it and it was so easy and quick to come together.

I was in a rush so I didn't add the hard boiled egg, so I don't know if it would make a difference but I know it was very good and refreshing without it.  I don't think I will ever buy a jarred tartar sauce again!

Really delicious.  I'll never buy store bought sauce again.  Takes only 5 minutes to make and makes plenty!  I left out the egg as I just saw no purpose in it.  I left out the capers as I was just out of them.  2 BIG dashes of worchesshire and hot sauce.  Otherwise the same recipie.  Super good stuff.  Just made my second batch now for some fish and chips my wife is cooking.

Very good and very easy.  I mixed it together last night and we had it with fish for lunch today.  Bf didn't notice the capers, or if he did, didn't complain.  I like the combo of ingredients.  I'm with other reviewers in that I have no idea what the egg contributes but it doesn't make it taste bad either.  I served with Crunchy Oven Fried Tilapia. This was more than enough for 3 pieces of the tilapia, so we have leftovers of this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed recipe to a "T".  Surprised about the call for a hard boiled egg.. don't know what it did/or didn't do to the recipe; but I'll NEVER buy jarred tartar sauce again!  Used with Hush Puppy recipe found on this site.  OMG.. sooo tasty!

Best tartar suace I've ever had.  This one is better than Frische's.  Thier's is so good, I make a special trip to order their $5 fish sandwich...all because of the tartar.  This is Better!  Excellent taste.  This tartar sauce has a nice balance of spices and mayo that packs a real punch!  This is great because you can use a smaller portion of this unhealthy condiment and not feel like you are getting cheated!

The only change I made was to double the recipe and I should have tripled it.  I will not purchase commercial Tartar sauce again.  I can't say enough about this sauce.  Someone mentioned chilling it for several hours prior to serving and I agree with that.

This is the best Tarter Sauce I've tried. Just one tiny variation, I didn't have sweet pickle relish so I dived up a mix of diced dill pickles and sweet pickles. Delicious

I wasn't too sure about the egg in this recipe, but we'll worth it.  I tasted it before and after adding it, and the end result was absolutely delicious. It had a much richer taste after adding the egg.  This recipe for tartar sauce is my husband's new favorite.

This is the tartar sauce I've always wanted to make. The only adjustment I may make in the future is allowing the pickle relish to sit in a strainer to drain off some liquid, or toss a few sweet pickles in the food processor.  It was just a tad too thin. Other than that, perfect!

The recipe is good as it is ,but humbly I left out the capers and the Worcestershire sauce , and added normal sugar to increase flavor  a dash of dry white wine and a tip spoon of Dijon Mustard, those ingredients are part of my secret recipe that comes from my already dead Grandma , my recipe is almost 130 years old.

This is the best tartar sauce I've ever had. Made according to recipe except for the addition of some Old Bay  seasoning.

Wonderful, I left out the egg and make sure you drain the sweet relish good. A++

Five stars with caveats - first batch far too sweet & salty:
(1) Sweet relish is *too* sweet; second time I used ground rind (avoids fluid & seeds from the core) from low sodium dill spears. 
(2) Use the lowest sodium good quality mayo you can find. 
*SO* much better than commercial blends! THANKS for sharing !!

very good! Left out egg since I didn't have time. Due to the sweet relish it is a bit sweet which is great. I am going to try it next time with dill just to see.

Great recipe!  I have made this several times with many different fish.  The last time I made it I did not put egg in it.  (I was saving them for my breakfast) My 10 year old took one bite and said "Ma-you forgot the egg!"  so I had to add it in right at the table.  Well done Diane!
