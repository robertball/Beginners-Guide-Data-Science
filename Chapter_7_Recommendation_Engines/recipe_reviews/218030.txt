My family really enjoyed this dish. I doubled the tomatoe sauce and used chunky medium salsa. I also doubled the cheese and added sour cream when served. I will definitely make again.

Reminds me of different ways my mother would "bake chops" with rice, easy and tasty. I ommited the green bell pepper and exchanged with fresh Pasilla and Jalapenos. I suppose you can heat this dish up to your personal palate. A dalop of sour cream to top! Great Submission, thanks!

WARNING! If you use half a cup of picante sauce, this is very spicy! I loveee spicy food, and it was almost too intense for me. If you're sensitive to spice, consider using a mild picante sauce or salsa instead. That aside, this was a delicious, easy meal. I substituted condensed tomato soup for the tomato sauce because I realized too late we were out. I also didn't brown my chops first because they were really thin and it would've dried them out. Everything else I followed to a T. I sprinkled green onion over the cheese before serving, and added sour cream to make the heat less intense. This was so good, and my boyfriend asked me to add it to the rotation... But to make it less spicy next time due to his acid reflux ;)

Note to those who said this was too spicy: keep in mind that picante can mean a couple things in the USA. I believe what this recipe intended was a salsa style picante (something like Pace brand). You can choose the heat level of this type of sauce. Be aware that there are other sauces labeled picante that are more like hot sauce and would make this dish exceedingly spicy. (such as Tapatio salsa picante) I used a medium Pace picante and this dish was not very hot at all, in fact my brother added his own hot sauce on top!

This dish was tasty and the rice was complimented by all family members. The problem I had was that after an hour when I took the cover off it was still very liquid with about an inch of unabsorbed liquid on top even though the rice was done. I put on the cheese, turned up the heat, and let it bubble and reduce for about another 15 minutes. Then I took it out and let it stand for another 5-7 minutes hoping the sauce would thicken up and it did. Next time I will probably take the cover off after 40 minutes, bake another 20, put on the cheese, and bake another 10. 

My only other complaint is the green peppers didn't seem to add much besides color. Next time I might dice them and add to the sauce mixture instead of on top. For a pop of green you could add jalepeno slices on top at the same time as the cheese.

Good recipe overall and will make again.

Awesome!!! This was incredible, much better then we expected.  Our pork chops were thinly sliced and we followed the recipe exactly.  It was nice to have pork chops with with a different spin on them.  If you like Mexican food, you will really enjoy this recipe.

This came out great, I didn't add bell pepper(didn't have any), only had a 4 pack of chops.  Next time I might try with chicken.  I liked it, my 3 & 5 year old boys didn't (they do not like anything I try thats new).

I used 2 cups of uncooked brown rice instead of white, added a tablespoon of chili powder,  a chopped red pepper, a chopped red onion, a 14 ounce can of chopped tomatoes and two cups of water along with the can of tomato sauce for the liquid (add more water if mixture gets dry before the rice is cooked).  I also cooked it on the stovetop until the rice was cooked. When the dish was served up we topped it  with sliced green onions and grated Mexican cheese blend. Family all loved it. My son said it was a keeper.

Loved this recipe, it was so easy & tasty..... I added Pico De Gallo instead of Picante Sauce & bought the thick pork chops from Costco. The meat was so tender & juicy! I will definitely be making this again, there was no left overs??

I have to give it only 4 stars because I baked it as directed and the rice was uncooked...it needed more time to stop being "crunchy".   If I would have cooked it longer, the pork chops would have dried out completely.  I'm not sure if I would make this one again or not?  We love spicy food, so I added a lot of cayenne, hot sauce, used hot salsa, etc.

This turned out great! I used instant brown rice, because that was all I had on hand. I used 1 c. rice, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and 3/4 c. of water with the taco seasoning and placed the pork chops and peppers on top. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, then 10 minutes more with cheese on top and the rice turned out perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great, my husband loves it. For just the two of us, i used only 3 chops and 3/4 cup rice with a little less than 1 1/2 cup water. I left the other amounts the same. I have added a small can of green chiles if I have them. I haven't had any issues with crunchy rice. Definitely in the rotation.

My family of picky eaters enjoyed this dish, however a few thought it was a little spicey and I had already cut the taco seasoning down,  I used 1 TBSP of epicure taco seasoning.  I would definitely make it again, but cut down on the spice a little more.

Skipped the picante sauce to make it more kids friendly.  I always make my Spanish rice with chicken bouillon, so I added 2 teaspoons of bouillon and kids loved the rich flavor.  I also use mild taco sauce and rub the chops with taco seasoning.  I've made this several times and I love how fast and effortless this is.  So good.

This was fantastic!  I halved the recipe for the two of us. My boneless chops were a little on the thin side. They cooked rather quickly and the rice still had a few minutes to go (we didn't mind too much). Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will make sure to get the thicker chops. That way the pork and rice will be done at the same time. The flavors were quite good!  Thanks for a great recipe that was easy and delicious!

Pork ended up a bit tough, and I only seared for about 2 minutes over side.  I will make this again, but I'd be tempted to make it with raw chicken strips (or maybe breasts) or raw pork chops without searing.   I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used my immersion blender to purée diced tomatoes.  I didn't have picante sauce either, but I found a recipe for "Copycat Pace Picante Sauce" on food.com that worked really nicely.  I really liked the rice in this recipe.  It came out with a little crunch, which I liked a lot. Spice level was great. Other than the alterations with the tomato sauce, I followed the recipe exactly.

This turned out just OK. I halved the recipe, but used a whole green pepper. I also added onions and a sliced jalepeno pepper. The pork chop seemed dry to me.  I am giving it four stars because of the ease of preparation, which was simple and with ingredients that are usually on hand.

I would definitely make it again; although, I enjoyed the rice mixture more than the pork chop.  I used the entire packet of taco seasoning and the whole  jar of the picante sauce.

Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Super simple and super delicious. Opted for no bell peppers as I’m not a fan. Going to try it with poblanos next time. This is a keeper.

This was a family favorite growing up in the '60s & '70s! I make it quite often, but one time I didn't have any tomatoe sauce, so I used V8 and it worked wonderfully! and when I have to make a big batch of this, I put bell pepper rings where each porkchop is located so that everybody gets a pepper

I only had 3 chops! Maybe that is why it was so mushy after an hour. I followed the directions then I turned the heat down to 320 and let it bake for another 1 and 1/2 hours. It was perfect! 3 chops and beautiful thick rice in a seasoned red sauce. I will definitely reuse this recipe.

Super quick and easy! My family likes heat, so I used fresh jalapeño slices in lieu of green bell pepper and substituted habanero salsa for the picante sauce. It was a big hit with everyone and I will definitely make it again!

I made this over the weekend and my husband and I loved it.  Pork chops were moist and very tasty.  The only thing I changed was I added the whole packet of taco seasoning and I added a small can of green chilies. Since it is just the 2 of us I froze half of it for another meal on a night I might need to make something fast.  Will definitely be making this again.

I added a little more seasonings ( I used seasoned salt on the pork chops) and used a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. I also had 8 pork chops so that's how many I squished into the pan and it turned out great!! The flavor was very good and the chops turned out moist and perfect!

Everyone enjoyed it. And for the friend who doesn't like any type of meat except white chicken or turkey breast meat, I made her a little casserole with chicken. She loved it, so did her husband.

I have made this several times now. When I first started making it the rice was undercooked and the pork chops kind of dry. To fix that  I switched to Jasmine rice which comes out prfect every time. I cooked the dish for 50 minutes then add the cheese and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Pork chops come out perfect.

Made recipe as written.  Flavor was good, even my 3 year old ate it. Rice was a little too tender for my preference - next time I might use thinner chops to cut cooking time down just a little.

This was excellent. I used chicken broth instead of water, loaded my chops up with Adobo seasoning and a spice mix that we like that's basically a fancy chili powder, and added a chopped jalapeno for some heat. The people who had problems with their rice not getting cooked in time might not have had their pan sealed tightly enough. You really need to crimp that foil on there to keep the moisture in! Mine came out perfectly and I can't wait to make this again.

I made this exactly as directed, using my own homemade taco seasoning. It was pretty good! I had thought I picked up mild picante sauce at the store, but I didn’t realize until it was already in the oven that it was hot, not mild. Oops! I figured it would be WAY too hot, but  it wasn’t. That is, if you like spicy food. My adult son said it tasted like enchiladas, which he said was a good thing.  My only complaint was that the rice was kind of mushy. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for exactly 1 hour at 350 degrees, so next time I will check it before the hour is up. Excellent flavor, though!

Great recipe! I only had 3 large bone-in chops and it still was amazing. I used 1-cup rice, 1 1/2-cup water, the full 8oz of tomato sauce, and lightened the hot sauce. I also chopped up the green bell pepper and tossed with the rice/sauce mixture. Delish!

Yes, I used paprika and Chile powder instead of taco seasoning.
Flavor was good chops were to dry

Normally I do not write reviews, but I after reading reviews, I must comment.  First, picante sauce is a type of chunky salsa.  Pace made Picante Sauce a household name years ago, but it still is salsa.  So, you can use salsa in this recipe.  Depending on how hot you want it, choose hot, medium or mild.  Second, sauteing the pork makes the outside nice and crunchy.  If you don't want to do this step, you need to cook it longer.  Pork that is tough may be undercooked. If it is dry, it is overcooked.  Third, if you are in a high-altitude area, rice has to cook longer , with more liquid.  I microwaved the rice in the bake pan with the water about 6 minutes before I added everything else. The rice came out perfectly cooked.  I used one poblano chile and one jalapeno chopped up in place of the bell peppers, but they did not make it any spicier.  I would use more jalapenos next time.  Pork chops were rather dry, even with all the liquid they were sitting in, so they were overcooked.  The concept is great, but we were not happy with the result.

I made this tonight. I made half of the recipe (for 3 people). Wife and son both really liked it. Son suggested adding some jalapeño slices next time to bump up the heat just a bit. I don’t disagree. I might add a little more rice next time - my teenage son is a big rice lover. Other than that it was great and we will definitely make it again.

I made a few modifications:
I used poblano pepper and jalapeño (1 each sliced) instead of bell pepper.
I didn’t have tomatoe sauce, but I puréed a can of crushed tomatoes instead.
I didn’t have Taco Seasoning, but I looked up the ingredients online ..all of which I did have...and substituted.
I added a drizzle of white wine in addition to the chicken broth.
Came out delicious! My husband said as he showed me his empty plate “ I guess you can make this any time you want!”
I didn’t photo after cooking...I need to be better about doing that.

My mom used to make this in the early 1990's using a recipe called "Pork Chops Ole"  from the original "Taste of Home" magazine.  I still make it and occasionally  use bone-in chicken thighs instead of pork.  This is a family favorite!

I followed the recipe exactly and we both liked it. I'll be making this again.  The only  negative was the rice was not fully cooked, even after 70 min. Next time I'll add 10 - 15 more minutes!

Really excellent use of pork chops. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the tomato sauce and loved it. I will make again and may add more spice with a little hot sauce or hotter peppers for the top.

Yes, definitely.  It took only 15 minutes to get into the oven since I browned the 6 pork chops on a pancake two -burner skillet while I mixed 2 cups rice, 4 cups water, 8 oz Tom sauce, 10 oz *Rotel mild diced tomatoes-and-peppers,  14 oz reg diced tomatoes and taco seasoning into 9x14 baking pan, added chops,  green pepper and COVERED.   Baked one hour, turned off oven added cheese.  Easy and yummy.

My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I decided to make the rice a bit more Spanish by adding a can of drained corn and a can of drained and rinsed black beans. It can be a bit spicy but that's easy to change.

I made it with 3 thick pork chops. There are 3 in our family. I did not brown the chops. I mixed everything up in a bowl and then poured it into the baking pan.  It was delicious but I agree with other people a little spicy for me but just right for my son and husband. Super simple.

I used brown rice instead of white  and realized after I dumped it in that I used a large can of tomato sauce but I probably would again anyways. It was easy, cheap and relatively healthy. Will definitely make again.

Made this exactly as directed except used 4 fairly thick boneless pork chops which I only browned for 2 minutes a side before continuing with the recipe as written.  Perhaps I used a bit more than 1/2 cup of cheese at the end.  It was pretty good tonight served with Mexican Corn also from this site.  Quite tasty and will repeat so thanks for posting. Update: Made this again this past week and used the chili powder I have from the ethnic aisle at the store and it is REALLY HOT!  Cut back on this next time if using the same package. WHEW!

This was a hit with my family. I followed the recipe as written and still only make a few changes next time. I think the chops could use more seasoning and will use garlic powder next time. Other than that, great dish.

Anther blizzard and had to cook from fridge. Substituted left over pork roast for the chops, homemade green tomatillo salsa for picante and brown rice for white. Otherwise followed directions, needed to cook a little longer cause of the brown rice. Turned out well great for a snowy day indoors. Thanks!

I prepared this for dinner tonight, subbing the picante with salsa as it was all I had on hand. Except for the fact that the rice took forever to cook, it turned out great and was delicious! I will be fixing this dish again, although I have to figure out how to deal with the rice issue.

If not for the rice issue, I'd give it 5 stars.

If anyone is interested in an Instant Pot version:
For my second try, I halved the recipe (just because I didn't need 6 chops) and cooked it in my Instant Pot. I sauteed the chops, removed them and added the liquid ingredients plus rice. I put the chops on the rack and cooked on Manual for 15 minutes. The result was more liquid, but the rice was cooked and it was delicious.

Loved it! The rice had great flavor. In contrast with other reviews about the rice being undercooked, mine was actually soft and in fact a little "mushy".  I followed the recipe exactly except substituted cheddar cheese for Mexican cheese. Yummy! Oh yeah I used a Mexican seasoning for the pork chops.

4 out of 5 of us liked it!  I think the 5 yr old would have liked the rice at least if she would have tried it.  I have fussy kids  and was so glad the older 2 liked it.

We used quinoa instead of white rice.  It cooks the same, but is so much healthier! Only had yellow peppers so used that instead too.  Kids did not think dish was spicy & followed it exactly.  We all loved it!
