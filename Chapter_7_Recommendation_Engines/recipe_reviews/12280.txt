This lemon version of Key Lime Pie was creamy and delicious! I made my own crust using 1-1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs, 2 T. sugar and 5 T. melted butter, which I baked at 350 degrees for seven minutes. I knew I'd like a bolder lemon flavor so I added 1-1/2 tsp. grated lemon zest to the filling. After pouring the filling into the crust, I  baked the pie an additional 15 minutes. I omitted the meringue as I preferred to top it with whipped cream. This was light, silky smooth and refreshing, and probably about the easiest pie to make!

Very good recipe!  The filling gets 5 stars, but the meringue only gets 3 (I averaged them to get 4).  The meringue is incredibly skimpy.  I recommend doubling the egg whites, although it isn't necessary to double the sugar.  I loved how easy the filling was compared to the lemon filling I usually make.  It took less time and dirtied fewer pans.  It also cooked beautifully and kept beautifully.  No separating at the edges, and no weeping or beading!  I made this first in a lemon version, then in a lime version.  The lime was good, but the lemon was better. If you want a little stronger flavor, simply grate a little zest into it.  But everyone who ate my pies thought the flavor was great just as it was. Hope this helps someone.:-)

Three generations of my family have made this pie - nearly identical recipe - we just use fresh lemons.  It is absolutely THE best!  We usually have to make two to avoid fights over the left overs!!

Is GREAT!!I've been making this recipe for decades.. The TRICK to this pie is to mix egg yolks and sweetened milk thoroughly before adding lemon juice and while mixing add lemon and mix just enough to mix good and then pour into pie shell immediatly

This is an awesome recipe. I usually throw two lemons in the blender and then strain the juice allowing some pulp to slip in. That will take care of any excessive sweetness ppl have mentioned. A wonderful pie that should be made a summer tradition!

If you like lemon curd- you will LOVE this pie! This is an incredible tasting & easy to make pie! I don't know why others have had a hard time getting theirs to come out, but both times I've made it, it was perfect. I make sure to beat the filling on high for 3-5 minutes and it comes out nice and thick. I haven't had any problems at all with the meringue turning out although I do double the meringue ingredients so I can have a higher topping on my pie- I think it's nicer looking. Each time I've made this it's folks devour it in seconds- not even a piece left over for the one who baked it! Your recipe has been added to the Christmas Pie Must list- that's a HUGE honor in our house! This pie is great and I thank you so very much for sharing it!!!!!!!!!!!

We have used this recipe in our family for YEARS. This is my favorite dessert.
It sets MUCH better by using freshly squeezed lemon juice. (I believe the acids in the lemon causes it to set. Just a guess!) It also tastes a whole lot better with real lemon juice.

This is the best Lemon Meringue Recipe!  The sweetened condensed milk makes it unbelievable rich.  I have made this for the last 30 years and my Mother made it before that.  I don't understand why anyone would have any problems with it. Excellent!

My grandpa's favorite dessert is lemon meringue pie with sweetened milk, so i gave this recipe and try and it turned out great!  He prefers a vanilla wafer crust (2 c crushed wafers, 6T melted butter, and extra whole wafers lined up around the outside of the pan and lightly grease the pan).  I used real lemons, and needed at least 4 of them to make 1/2 c juice because my 3 didn't cut it.  I also used 3 eggs, to make more meringue topping.  The lemon juice sets the custard so you don't have to prebake it (I was worried about that part).  Don't worry about overbeating your egg whites, just make sure they're plenty stiff so you can make pretty peaks on the pie.  Since added an extra egg, I added 2 more T of sugar.  I didn't think this pie was sour or overly sweet--the 2 layers balance each other out.  I would reccomend lowering the cooking temp to 350 for 10 min, or until it starts to brown.  Let it cool on the counter for about an hour and then refrigerate to set it.  I can't wait for grandpa see and taste this!!

My husband loved it!  After reading the reviews, I used 1 tsp. less sugar in the meringue, and it was just the right amount of sugar.  This was my first time making a meringue pie, and so I didn't "beat until stiff" since I didn't know how long that was.  I should have beaten it for a lot longer.  I also used a refrigerated egg, even though the recipe said to use a room temp egg.  I should have listened.  The meringue wasn't tall at all.  I'll definately try this one again though!!

I give this 3.5 stars. It’s a good idea, but has some definite faults. First, there is not enough filling or meringue. The base is only about ½” deep and the topping about the same, making a small, flat pie that doesn’t fill the crust. I doubled the entire recipe and used a larger 10” pie crust. 4 egg whites gave an ample amount of meringue. Secondly, there is not enough lemon flavor. I like it tart. Fresh lemon juice alone is not enough and you can’t simply add more juice as it will be too runny. I added two tablespoons of lemon zest (use a microplane, not a grater). I still thought it could use a bit more zing so I put in ¼ tsp. lemon extract. I also added a bit of yellow food coloring. Third, I baked the pie 15 min. at 350 degrees. It’s necessary to bake longer so the eggs in the base are cooked and can set, and so bacteria in the eggs is killed. (I wondered if 6 minutes in the original recipe accomplished either of those.) Lastly, refrigerate the pie for several hours or overnight. The recipe doesn’t mention this but it needs to chill in order for the base to set. The result was an impressive-looking, intensely flavored pie. However the filling was still too soft, with the texture of pudding. Next time I’ll try adding an extra egg yolk to the base and baking longer. I may also bake the base first then add the topping and continue baking until brown. I might try less lemon juice and substitute with some lemon extract so there isn’t as much liquid in the base. Hmmm...

Really good & easy to make!  My grandmother made a recipe similar to this, but she never gave it to anyone.  It died with her.  This pie is a carbon copy to her pie.  Not only did it taste yummy, it brought back great memories!

Awesome Lemon Pie! For better lemon taste I added 1-2 tsp grated lemon zest to filling, as naples34102 suggested (thanks for the advise). I omitted the cream of tartar because didnt have it, but the meringue came out great (I used 3 eggs). I was so excited to try this one, couldnt wait... so when I cut it, the filling was flowing, I was disappointed. But the next day, after it been in a fridge, it turned out normal. SO I suggest, to cool it completely or refrigerate before serving.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Took this to a potluck party and everyone loved it.  People actually fought over it.  Its quick and easy to make, and can be turned into a frozen pie by replacing the merringue with Cool Whip.

I love this lemon pie. You do have to make sure you beat the filling at least 2 minutes for it to thicken. I also use 3 egg whites for the meringue because we like it fluffy. My mom used to make this all the time and it brings back fond memories.

Excellent recipe!!! Easy, too. I used an extra egg (both yolk & white) and made sure to mix the yolk and milk well before adding the lemon. I also made my own crust with graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. I will be making this again...and I am picky about my recipes.

This is a good pie, not very lemony made with pre packaged lemon juice. Perfect for someone who wants a sweeter not tart at all lemon pie. Next time I will choose real lemons and less sugar for the meringue (I doubled the egg whites for the meringue as other suggested).

I love this recipe, learnt it from my mother-in-law :O)  My gradfather loves this pie, I'm not allowed in the house if I'm without a pie! lol  :O) And to help Peg W out ...if you are using the same bowl for the meringue as the filling, once you wash the bowl you have to let it air dry completely and let it get back to room temp. befor eyou make the meringue otherwise, it will fall. Also, to anyone else having trouble , this pie only works if you are using a mixer and the longer you let the filling and the meringue mix the better it will be, I mix it on high with my Kitchen Aid. Hope this helps :O)

I used to avoid any and all recipes that called for sweetened condensed milk, as they were invariably waay too sweet for me! Then one day my daughter requested a birthday Flan, and every recipe I found had that sicky sweet stuff in it. So decided to try using evaporated milk instead and add my own sugar to taste. It was a complete success! There are so many more recipes that I can try now, that I wouldn't before, because I can have complete control over the amount of sugar. Just sharing for those who also found this pie too sweet...

I found this to be too sweet but my husband loved it.  Next time I might change the ratio of lemon and sugar to make it a bit more tart and a bit less sweet. Overall, good recipe - thanks for sharing!

This was very good...I used the Wilton meringue substitute instead of the egg whites. I would double the meringue recipe for more fluff and I had to brown it about 10-12 minutes.

Amazing Pie!  I have become known as the pie lady, and this pie has become a favorite for summer pot lucks!  I would definitely double the topping, only because I like it fluffy.  It was very difficult to cover the pie with the topping proportions given, but its an easy fix.

Thought this was a great recipe, super easy! I had the perfect amount of meringue but I did add more sugar and I did beat the egg whites for around 5 minutes total. I also used the store bought graham cracker pie crust which made it super easy and I had just the right amount for the size of the pie crust!

Well, I took everyone's advice and used 4 egg whites and it was barely enough meringue to cover.  Don't use less.  In fact, I would double the whole recipe next time.  Without doubling it is just too small an amount in the 9" pie shell they recommend.  I have a lot of crust sticking up over the edges and there was just not enough filing in each slice. Next time I am definitely doubling the whole recipe.  I also baked at 400 for only 6 min and it was perfect.  Any longer, as some other readers suggested, and the meringue would have burnt.  Follow the instructions and it will come out great!  Taste was excellent!  Will make again for sure.

Very very good pie, and so easy it deserves an extra star. I did make a 3 (large) egg-white meringue with 1/4 cup sugar, and added a bit of yellow food coloring to closer mimic the color of lemon meringue, but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. It really needs to be refrigerated overnight to set well. Make it tonight, ready in the morning. This will be my go-to recipe from now on when I need a quicky for potluck, etc.

I have made this recipe many times. Here is what I have changed.  I have my husband make a regular homemade pie crust (cause I can't make a piecrust :)).  I use all the ingredients for the filling but I use a whipped cream topping instead of the meringue. I like the creaminess of the whipped cream.  Also, I have tried this with limes instead of lemons and it is outstanding!

Love this type of lemon pie, for one pie I add 3 egg yolks and bake for 15 to 20 min without meringue @ 350 then let firm in fridge overnight. My family has been making this recipe for years and is always a hit. One pie is never enough so for family functions I make my own crust and use a 1/2 sheet cake size pan or larger depending on party size @ 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep.

My mom made this when I was a kid. I loved it then and still do. My Mom was the best!!!
 (Sorry other Moms) :)
This pie is easy, delicious and so custard like. Much better than what you get at a bakery. Glad to see it here.

This was good and easy to make.  I did double the recipe for the merangue, like suggested in other reviews.  I also had to add a little sugar to it to get it to stiffen.

This is a delicious lemon pie, and so much easier than the traditional lemon filling.  I would definitely double the meringue next time, as it was not enough to make a high topping.  This is a keeper for me!

After I made this my husband kept saying, "Babe, I'm gonna end up eating the whole thing." Which I just took to mean he was just complementing it. Well, that evening I went to get a piece, didn't see the pie in the fridge - found the empty pie plate in the sink. So, I guess it was fabulous. I'll have to make another tonight to find out for myself (and also bacause my husband is already asking for another).

I gave this recipe a 2 only because i am going to keep the meringue part so i can use it again. The meringue was PERFECT! but then i took a bite of the actual lemon part of it. I had to spit it out! it was both extremly sweet and extremly sour at the same time! yucky. sorry jane but the recipe didnt turn out at all.

This is a good, easy recipe.
It is a bit sweet, I cut down the sugar in the 
meringue.
I also baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.
Turned out great.

Very disappointing as there is not much of a really sharp lemon taste which I like.  I much prefer the more tradionally made lemon meringue pie.  I will not be making this again.

This is keeper.  Everyone raved about it.  Reminded me of a key lime pie.  The only thing I did different was used a flaky pie crust that I baked for about 20 minutes.  Poured the filling in the cooled baked crust.  I covered the edges of the pie crust (you can use a pie shield or foil) while the pie baked for about an additional 20 minutes to set the filling.  Yummy!

4 out of 5 people in my house loved the pie...very very easy to make, and I think maybe the chef that had the sauce break and not turn out may have added the lemon too fast.  I add it by the tablespoon and then I don't even have to use the beaters.  Also, on a 9 inch pie pan I always use a 3 egg meringue and so I just threw in the 3rd yolk, kept the entire recipe the same, and still had great results.  Even my picky husband who doesn't like lemon pie ate it and said it was good.  But my son who is a lemon pie fanatic, said it isn't lemony enough for him, so next time I am going to use real lemons like other chefs have stated.  But definately a keeper for those days you need a quick dessert.  Thanks for sharing.

I love recipes with sweetened condensed milk.  It gives this pie a smooth consistency, and sure makes it easy to make.  However, we felt that this recipe was too sweet.  If you like really sweet desserts, you'll like this.

A great recipe for when you need dessert in a pinch, though the topping didn't turn out for me.  I had to put the pie with filling in the oven for 7 min to heat the filling up then put the topping on once the pie was hot.  The first time I put the topping on the cool filling and the bottom of the merange didn't cook.

This is an OLD family favorite, going back 50 years or more. We've never done it with meringue; we've always topped ours with (homemade) whipped cream, and always in a homemade graham cracker crust. The menfolk fight over it.

I have made this pie for 20 years and my husband loves. However, I made it twice yesterday with the same results as the person who rated it as a "Disaster".  It was so gooey and runny.  Something was wrong, but it wasn't the recipe. If anyone has a clue, please post it. I'm at a loss, unless the eggs or milk was bad.

It IS a very sweet pie - I generally use 3 yolks, which cuts the sweetness somewhat, and like other reviewers did, you can cut way back on the sugar in the meringue, but this recipe definitely requires a sweet tooth!

I have been using this recipe for 50 years.  If you have an over large pie pan, double the recipe. This recipe never fails for me.  Fresh lemons are better, but the bottled lemon juice will work.  It works with a regular pie crust or graham cracker crust or vanilla wafer crust.  Yummy

I've made this recipe ALL my life.  The only difference is how I make the meringue...I just use a 1:1 ratio 1egg white to 1 T white sugar.   Like many others...my mom and grandmother made/make this with REAL lemons.  They both swear that's the game changer.  My mom has said not even in a pinch make with anything but real lemons.  I've done it with the bottled juice...two different pies IMHO.   This truly is a pie worth keeping.   People beg us (Mom/sister/brother/me) to make it...it's that popular!  
Secret...in my house the kids and hubby just have me make the lemon part of the pie bc they love my meringue kisses so much (2 egg whites, 1t vanilla, 1/8t salt, 1/2c sugar, 6oz chocolate chips) They want me to take the egg whites and make those rather than the meringue topping on the pie!

Thisis a perfect recipe for that lemon tree in the back yard; my neighbors and family love it. So easy to make. I use a shortbread pie crust. And we like with out meringue. One last thing I do place pie in 350 oven for 15 minutes.

This was okay. But I used 3 LARGE room temperature eggs instead of 2, and 2 teaspoons - a tablespoon of the zest. When it came down to the meringue, I used the cream of tartar along with a sprinkle of salt, and drizzled in 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a hot syrup of 3/4 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 6 tablespoons of sugar. Remember to use cold beaters and mixing bowl when making a meringue, and to spread the finished product on top of the pie AS SOON as it comes out of the oven the first time.

I grow up on a lemon Pie somewhat like this. We didn't have much money growing up so it was maked from Graham cracker crust, lemon juice and sweeten condensed milk. We loved it and my kids love it today. I can not wait to try it this way. It can only get better. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is the same recipe my mom and grandma have used for years, and one of my all time favorites.  The only difference is we add 1 tsp of grated lemon grind (helps a little with the sweetness), 1 tsp of cream of tartar, and only 1 Tbsp of sugar.  If you don't like sweet desserts, this one may not be for you.  However, it's a huge hit at gatherings for anyone who likes lemon.

I would call this more of alemon cream pie.  The filling was a bit soft, but had good flavor.  I could definitely have used more meringue than just 2 egg whites worth.  Left it kind of thin on top.

This is the way to make lemon meringue pie in south america... except no eggs for the filling. Just can and fresh lemons.

If the pie is runny you need to work on the meringue because it is "weeping" on you.

I admit, I increased the eggs to 4 as recommended.  I also added zest and ½ tsp lemon extract.  It was excellent though quite rich.  We enjoyed it very much.

I made this pie without the meringue on top. (Not a fan of meringues.) I used an 8" (not 9") store-bought graham cracker crust (Keebler) so the crust wouldn't appear to be only half-filled. I also used fresh lemon juice with some pulp added, the zest of one of the lemons, and 3 egg yolks instead of two (per other reviewers' suggestions). I baked it at 350° for 25 minutes. The custard set just fine. I served it with whipped cream (the aerosol kind!). The sweetened condensed milk did make this pie extremely sweet (too sweet, really, for my taste). But as another reviewer suggested, the whipped cream helped mute that sweetness a bit. While I don't expect to make this pie again, I'm glad I tried it because it looked enticing. Sorry, but I have no ideas about improving the recipe.

This pie was great! Easy and quick to prepare.  I did add lemon zest, about one and a half tablespoons, to the filling. I also increased the number of egg whites to a total of four for the meringue.  I will definitely make this again.  I'm considering making the cookie crust from crumbled lemon cookies next time.  Yum!

3.21.19  A good number of reviewers mentioned that their pie filling never set up.  I watched the video which showed making the filling in the blender, so I used my Vitamix.  The recipe says that the mixture should thicken and be well blended.  I used fat-free condensed milk and wondered if that had something to do with my filling also being  pretty thin.  Another reviewer mentioned that she baked her pie for 15 minutes and garnished with whipped cream, no meringue.  So I stirred in the lemon zest from one lemon (to kick up the lemon flavor) and baked the pie for 5 minutes @ 375ºF hoping that would help thicken it, let it cool down a bit, then spread the meringue on the top, and back into the oven.  That helped a little, but the filling still was pretty soft, although very creamy and silky.  If you’re thinking lemon meringue pie, don’t, because the texture is different.  This is more like a lemon cream pie, and it’s a tasty one.  If I were to make this again, I’d use regular sweetened condensed milk, and add one more egg white, maybe even two, to get a higher meringue.   And by all means, I’d recommend chilling your pie for several hours before serving.  I took my photo before chilling, but the consistency was much better and firmer after being in the fridge for a couple hours.   I’d bought a graham cracker crust for 75¢ at Aldi, and gotta say this was the easiest pie I’ve ever made.

Turned out great.  Quick and easy to do.  I did bake 15 minutes, used fresh juice and zest, and added an extra egg.  Do problem at all with it setting up.  I will definitely keep this one!

This was delicious. I used fresh lemon juice and 1 tbsp of zest. Instead of making meringue I used whipped cream on top.  The filling could have easily been doubled in order to fill up the crust, but with the recipe as stated, it leaves room for a nice layer of cream on top.

If I make this again, I'll use 3-4 egg whites in the meringue. It was too little to spread and it ended up mixing in with the filling. The flavor was good - that's the important part.

11 16 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12280/magic-lemon-pie/ ... Very much like my usual recipe except I use three eggs.  Very easy & very good.  'Bake mine at 350 for about 15 minutes.  Also similar to ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/232936/eagle-brand-lemon-cream-pie/ ... but I suppose most with sweetened condensed milk are.  The idea of whipped cream instead of meringue is a good one, if your meringue isn't perfected yet - like mine, it weeps - & then you have whites for meringue cookies!  Mmmmmm!  :D

Always turns out fantastic.  This recipe has been passed down from generation to generation.  It used to be on the Eagle Brand label, but they have removed it for some reason.  Always gets great reviews.

Great recipe...use freshly squeezed juice if possible plus some zest and you won't be disappointed. To the reviewer who said you could drink it through a straw, my guess would be she used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk...there is a big difference but it seems to be a common mistake!

The consistency was perfect, but the lemon creme was not lemon enough (fresh squeezed), it tasted like sweetened condensed milk, not lemon.

I would probably add more juice, or zest of lemon, plus maybe a table spoon of sugar in the creme.

This a great recipe as-is, but is also perfect to have fun with.   Use vanilla wafers or coconut cookies for the crust.  Top with blueberry compote instead of meringue, or better yet blueberry compote and meringue.  Make it crustless and just spoon the lemon filling over crushed cookies with or without the meringue.   This great recipe has endless possibilities!

One of my family's favorite pies. Also, this pie has impressed company many times. Everyone I served it to liked it.. I had made it with homemade crust and  store bought one with good results. 
The only change I make is adding about 1 Tablespoon of  grated lemon zest with the lemon juice.

Excellent and much easier than a traditional lemon meringue pie.   Add cream of tartar to the merangue is a trick my mother taught me and does make a big difference in the end result.   Must try this pie again because I had forgotten it.

I love this recipe! I have never made a pie before, and it came out great. I loved the simplicity of it, the flavor was great. I know some ppl said it was too sweet, for me I needed more sugar (Im not even a sweet person); I guess it depends on your lemons. I would try 3 eggs next time as suggested by others. I did needed a bit more of egg whites for the top. Overall, I will be making this again very soon! Thanks for the share.

Easy and perfect recipe! I just made my own graham crust (to avoid extra preservatives from the ready crust) and as other ppl said here i used fresh limes, some pulp and zest for the juice, then added it to the cond milk in a beater. Didnt try the meringue. Great dessert!

This was soooo good. I had to double the lemon juice though.  For some reason mine turned out so liquidy. I am not sure if it was the extra lemon juice or not. we still ate the whole thing anyway!

I didn't like the texture nor was the lemon flavor strong enough.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was pretty good. It was 5 stars for simplicity but just about 4 stars for taste. It wasn't bad but not amazing either.

I love this pie. Our family has been eating it for special occasions for three generations, we use real lemons, and make a pie crust, not graham crackers. My sister has even won a few pie bake offs at church with this recipe. YUM!
