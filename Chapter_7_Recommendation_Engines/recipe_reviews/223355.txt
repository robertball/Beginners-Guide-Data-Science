Too many calories when you use the seasoning packets.  Instead, read the seasoning packet to see that you can add 2 tsp. of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and olive oil.  You could also add a little black pepper.  There is plenty of salt in the soy sauce.  I love this combination.

Congrats! I didn't even realize this was published...I had the honor of making this wonderful salad before it became 'kitchen approved', and here's what I had to say: WOW, Molly, this is FANTASTIC! I used white basalmic vinegar instead of regular b/c I just got some and wanted to try it out, but that was my only change. The flavors of this are wonderful and fresh! Hubby usually doesn't like these 'ramen' type salads, but he raved over this and called the leftovers to take to work for lunch tomorrow, so that's saying a lot, lol. I actually had to stop myself (and hubby, lol) from eating this...YES, it's that good! This is gonna be a new side staple for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, Molly! :)

Wow! You too will say that when you taste this salad! Fantabulous!! I forgot about the green onions and chopped some cilantro in instead and tossed in a handful of pistachios. Even my semi picky hubby loved it! Thank You Molly!!  I will absolutely make this again and again!

Awesome! Tastes like my MIL's Oriental salad which we love, but with broccoli instead of cabbage. I toasted and sliced up some almonds instead of the cashews since I had those here. Thanks Molly!

Congrats on the newly published recipe Molly. Here is a copy of my original review before it was published..What a wonderful salad, my slaw mix was only 12oz. so I added in some more shredded carrots. I didn't have any cashews or sunflower seeds, but it was just fine without them. My whole family loved it, and my sons had their gals over...they finished it off. My college kids eat Ramon noodles all the time and gave me a tip for breaking them up. Crush the noodles really good with the package unopened, it was much easier than after it was opened. Thanks Molly, another winner in my recipe box.

I've made this tasty crowd pleasing salad so many times I can do it from memory now.  The sweet and salty flavour with the delicate crunch of the noodles makes a great side dish for just about anything.  I have to omit the nuts due to allergy and usually substitute craisins or raisins.  Thanks Molly for such a great salad.

We really enjoyed this salad.  My store only carried 10 oz bags of broccoli slaw so bought a bag a trislaw (carrots, cabbage and broccoli) and tossed in a big handful of that too.  I only added one ramen instead of the two called for.  Dressed everything 30 min before dinner (didn't use all the dressing) and it was a huge hit for my dinner party.  Will definately make this again.

Yum!  Made this for supper last night and it was really good.  I liked the sweetness of the dressing with the saltyness of the nuts plus the extra crunch they added was a great touch.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

Loved this! I marinated chicken breast, sliced it super thin and tossed it in. Reminds me of broccoli salad so much, I think next time I will add raisins.

Wow, why did I wait to try this!  Hubby took one mouthful and said he was “enamored” by your salad!  A friend also loved it and so do I.  Will make again, as many on the Buzz know, hubby was sent to the store for the ingredients and brought home a case of ramen noodles!  Thanks Molly!

This is a great "mix and match" recipe.  Customize it to your liking by adding different nuts, craisins, raisins, shredded carrot, etc.  I used aged balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil.  Might use less sugar next time to allow for a bit more sourness to the dish but still delicious.

This was great. I was a little worried at first. When I first mixed up the dressing and tasted it, I didn't like it AT ALL. But after everything was mixed together and it sat in the fridge for a couple of hours, it was delicious! So quick and easy to throw together. I'll definitely be making this again. I think I'd add more slaw mix, or less noodles, it seemed like too much noodles compared to slaw to me.

Wow!  I made this salad for a cook-out today.  Everyone LOVED IT! I was asked for the recipe by a few folks.  I followed the recipe as written, with the only exception of using a 12 oz.  Mann's Rainbow Salad Mix (Broccoli flowerets,shredded cauliflower hearts, shredded carrots and red cabbage) and only a half bag of a 12 oz. Mann's Broccoli coleslaw mix (wanted to add a little more color).  Even with the additional vegetables and only using the original amount of dressing, it still was enough to coat everything without it being too dry.  I didn't think the addition of the 2 ramen noodle flavor packets made it too salty. ( Unless you're watching your sodium levels.) I will definitely be making this recipe again.  It's nice for cookouts on a hot Summer day, since you don't have to worry about the dressing requiring chilling.

I originally reviewed this on June 14, don't know why it didn't show... here it is again:  Made this for lunch today.  Didn't change a thing,  only had 1/2 cup of cashews; so I added a bit more sunflower seeds.  Everyone enjoyed this very much.  I was hoping for some leftovers; but it was all eaten.  Thanks, Molly, for sharing a wonderful recipe (love the very original name).

I admit I made some changes.  I didn’t add the seasoning packet because it had MSG, and I lowered the sugar and oil amount a bit.  So if MSG doesn’t agree with you, you can adjust this recipe and still have it come out beautifully.  We enjoyed it immensely.

I made this earlier in the day so the noodles would soften a little. Had DH taste it when he got home & he said he didn't like it. Found him 10 minutes later eating it from the bowl. He said the broccoli was too hard but it was so good! Next time, I will steam the broccoli slaw mix briefly to wilt but still crisp. Had to omit the nuts & seeds for health issues. Per other reviewers, added Craisins & a small amount of sesame oil. This is something different for us & we love it. Fabulous!! Thanks for the recipe Molly! ~~~ I make this wonderful salad almost every week now. Some for us & send some home with son. One DGD wants this with every meal & as her snack. I will add a bit of diced leftover chicken to this for my lunch. Love it!

Very good but very sweet and had already cut down. Only used half the seasoning packet but might add more next time. Good stuff, perfect side and alternative to salad!

Wonderful!  I made this for a July 4th bbq and everyone raved about it.  It was a nice change from the usual bbq side dishes.  Tastes just as good the next day.  I will make this again and again.

Delicious!  I have to admit, I have never been one for broccoli slaw, but after seeing all the raves about this, had to try it.  Well folks... I had three servings! Yes, three!  Only change I made was to use vegetable oil, as I didn't have canola.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so I omitted this time.  It was so good!  My daughter had a friend over for dinner, and she had several helpings too (and she is a teenager!).  My grandma raved too!  A bit hit! Thanks Molly!  Will be making a lot for sure!

Delicious!  Used regular cabbage coleslaw (had on hand) and added some fresh broccoli.  Made only half recipe but should have done the full recipe!  First time I've used the ramen noodles and will break them up a little more next time.  Will be making this recipe often.  Thanks, Molly!

This salad is the perfect mix of flavors and texures, so easy and delicious.  Hubby had seconds...and thirds!.  He raved about this, and that's a first for a side dish.  Absolutely love this sweeter dressing, combined with the saltiness of the cashews and sunflower seeds, yum.  Prepared this exactly as written.  What a great pot luck dish, double or triple the recipe 'cause they will devour this!  Thanks so much for sharing, Molly.

This salad is a huge hit!  People rave every time I make it, and the name always makes them laugh!  I think it might be just as good with a little less balsamic vinegar, as a little goes a long way with that ingredient.  You can vary what you add to this to suit your own taste and depending on how adventurous you feel!  Definitely worth putting in your repertoire!

Substituted Sweetener for the sugar. Added celery leaves chopped and match stick radishes. Keeps well and remains crisp and with an added protein makes a great summer meal when it's so hot.

Made for the first time today. We LOVED IT! Made it exactly as the recipe calls and it was perfect. It's "going in the book" meaning I'm saving it and making it again! I put my ramen noodles in at about 1.5 hours before eating and they weren't too soggy.

I've been looking for this recipe! A lady I used to work with brought this to all of the pot lucks! I had 2 packages of Ramen noodles, but when I looked at the ingredients I just couldn't use the seasoning packets. MSG and other nasty stuff. (I've leaned to read labels since I used to make this) Anyway I followed the salad part, added a can of mandarin oranges (that's what my friend used to add) and used 3/4 cup Trader Joes ginger soy salad dressing. I crumbled up the noodles and added the roasted nuts about 2 hours before serving. Perfect! Everyone loved it, including the kids!

I liked this salad, but my husband did not.  I enjoyed the ramen noodles in it, and they were better the second day.

As is, the recipe is great. I have made changes to make it even better, but it seems fantastic as is. I use 3 packs of ORIENTAL flavored ramen instead of two, and make about an extra bit of dressing to compensate for the extra noodles. Probably an extra 1/3 of the dressing recipe, and then I do add the third ramen seasoning packet in. I add a large can of mandarin oranges and chopped up fresh cilantro as well. I always have white balsamic vinegar on hand and have only made it with white. It's excellent this way but I'm sure regular balsamic would be fine too. This is ADDICTING. and it's fine to me when the noodles get a bit softer. I usually make it about 3-4 hours before serving and add nuts in last. YUM.

Turned out so great!  I doubled the recipe and there was a. It too much dressing if doubled.  Next time I make it (soon) I won't add all the dressing the salad.

Wow! Very good!!I made this in honor of my son who is getting ready to "ship out". He LOVES ramen!  I was afraid the noodles would get too soggy and waited until 2 hours before my party to add them. Well, they were just as good the next day! I will definitely make this again.

We all loved this, thanks for the recipe.  Has anyone tried using sugar substitute, and if yes, which one?  How was it?
I tried it the first time with balsamic, second time rice wine, third time apple vinegar.  The apple cider vinegar was the best.
Also added cilantro and red peppers chopped in the food processor.  Great salad!

I made a smaller amount of the salad for us and used the extra dressing to marinate bite-sized pieces of boneless skinless chicken breasts.  The salad and chicken sat a few hours in the fridge, then I quickly stir-fried the chicken, added the nuts and seeds to the salad and we had a great dinner!  Thanks Molly, for sharing this yummy recipe.

Mom and I loved this! I did tweak it, a bit (= The store did not have broccoli slaw, so I used a regular cabbage slaw. I toasted the cashews, and intended to sub toasted sesame seeds for the sunflower seeds - but, apparently I'm out of sesame seeds, so they were left out )= [I AM glad I used the sesame oil!] I subbed rice vinegar for the balsamic. Oh! And I used a Truvia blend in place of sugar [whatever the equivelent stated on the box] Thank you, Molly!

This salad is amazing! I couldn't get enough! I used regular coleslaw mix and only 1 package of ramen noodles and sauce packet to cut down on the calories and salt and it was still delicious. Next time, I plan to roast the ramen in the oven until brown like I do with my Cabbage Crunch Salad recipe to add another layer of flavor. I will make this again and again!

Made this today. Left out the cashews and used sliced almonds. Personal preference. I've been waiting out this recipe, frankly because the name turns me off. Don't let it turn you off. It's an oriental coleslaw and it is good. The dressing is spot on. Make it ahead and refrigerate for a few hours. It's easy and fast to put together and I love that.

A friend brings this as her signature side dish to all of our get togethers.   I refer to it as "Crack Salad" because it is so freekin' good that it haunts you.   We've been known to eat it first thing in the morning after a party the night before.   Once you eat it - you're hooked.    So good.  So So So Good.

WOW, This is so good. Thank you Molly for this recipe. I used coleslaw mix and add broccoli. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I will certainly bring this salad for my next potluck party.

I made up the sauce for this last night wow it is GOOD!  I too, used sesame seed oil and I quadrupled the recipe but still only used 1cup of oil, it was more than enough.  I was very skeptical about using the Ramen seasoning packet for some reason but WOW this sauce is great!  Had to use brown sugar I got home and didn't know I was out of white :(  My grocery store had only 3 bags broccoli mix, so I grabbed one more bag of cabbage mix.  I chopped a can of mandarin oranges and am going to toss in some edamame as well.  I think everyone will really enjoy this.  There are other 'Asian type' cole slaws on here that are similar but this one is simple and the sauce is fantastic!  I am thinking of making more next week and grilling some salmon or chicken and making that my lunches!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Another great recipe that you can tweek to your taste.  I used olive oil and rice vinegar.  I liked this salad both when the noodles were crunchy and then soft after the salad set for a while.  I added carrots, brocoli and 16 oz of slaw.  I thought it had too much liquid until you add the noodles then it is just right.
