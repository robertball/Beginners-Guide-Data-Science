At first I was disappointed at the very strong vinegar flavor, however, I added worcestershire, liquid smoke and garlic, marinated a chuck roast overnight and then cooked it in a crockpot for 10 hours. It made one heck of a shredded beef sandwich on a Brown and Serve roll.  Excellent!

Sweet with a kick!  I cut the chili powder and cayenne to 1/2 teaspoon because I was concerned it would be to spicy for the kids.  I cut back on the sugar slightly but after tasting added the full amount. My sauce thickened up a lot sooner than 45 minutes.

This was really great!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it on steak.  Next time I will try chicken or something different, but it definitely compliments steak perfectly.  It was a little bit spicier than I'd imagined it would be.  That was good for me because I

I prepared this 3 days ago.  I wasn't sure about it at first.  It has a sweetness to it but then the heat creeps up the pallet.  However...I said the rest in a sealed glass container in the fridge and after a few days the ingredients have mellowed.  The sauce is thicker, tangier, and the heat is mellowed too.  To me, it rivals most store bought sauces.  Nice!

Very good sauce, except a little strong vinegar and to spicy for some people. I cut the vinegar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/4 cup water. Cut the Chili Powder and Cayenne to 1/2 tsp Ea. Over all it is a very good sauce. Thanks

This BBQ sauce is excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the cayenne pepper.  In its place, I added about a tablespoon of chipotle in adobo because I wanted a bit of smoky-spice.   It's the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, smoky,  and tangy.  I reduced it for about 45 minutes and it's the perfect consistency.  I will make this again and again.

This was very good.  Used it for pulled pork and BBQ spare ribs....I couldn't get it to thicken up as much as I wanted it so it didn't get five stars.

This sounded really good, so I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of chili powder & cayenne pepper. (Many family members with tummy issues!). The first & most overwhelming "problem" was the strong vinegar smell & taste.  It was too acidic.  So to cut through the acidity, I added about a cup or slightly more of brown sugar.  It was still too sour from the vinegar, so I added about 1/4 cup honey.  I also added about 2 Tblsp. Heinz chili sauce, about 2 Tblsp. Liquid Smoke, & 1 Tblsp. Wocestershire sauce.  I simmered it for about 15 minutes, but it wasn't thickening very well.  So I added a Tsp. of corn starch in about 2 Tblsp. cool water, then added it to the sauce.  That's what it took to achieve a final product I was happy with, that wasn't too sour from vinegar, & my family was thrilled with!  I used shredded roast beef right into the pan & let it caramelize a bit, then placed it in buns for BBQ sandwiches!  Everyone raved about the final product!  Thanks for the recipe, even though I modified it, it was a great outline for me to start with!

This was a good sauce but I spiced it up a bit more by adding some hickory smoke BBQ flavor and just a 1/4 tsp of wasabi horseradish.  Perfect tang and bite.  Will make again.  Thanks to Paul for a superb base!

EXCELLENT!!!! We looooved this recipe! Thanks so much for submitting this!! 
I made bbq chicken legs with this sauce. Did it on the oven. Was fantastic. It stuck well to the chicken.  Im on a low sugar diet so what I did was make homemade low sugar ketchup using splenda. Then I added a cup of Splenda instead of brown sugar. It was still the tastest bbq sauce ever! Im making it again tonite and doing it with ribs this time. I cant wait! YUMMY!

This was certainly tasty, but after it cooked down, I was left with less than a cup of sauce, which is certainly not 12 servings. So some of us got to enjoy this sauce, and the rest of our guests were stuck with bottled.

I didn't want to give this even one star, because for us it was inedible.  I don't know if there's a wrong kind apple cider vinegar, I just used our store brand, but my daughter and I tried this recipe and it burned our nose and throat.  There seemed to be way too much vinegar and it didn't taste good at all.

In spite of the reviews about the excess vinegar smell, I tried this.  It was ok but I failed to fully appreciate the reviews regarding the extent of the vinegar smell and taste.  Probably won't make it again.

I think this is a great base recipe. It's very similar to what I make so I wanted to try it. If you don't like vinegar then do not make this recipe. It's got quite a tang to it. I also add more brown sugar (and I only use dark brown sugar), plus a little molasses or cane syrup (to taste) and a splash of worcestershire sauce. I also use crushed red pepper instead of cayenne. With the changes, it's more like Emerill Lagasse's sauce and quite good for those who like sweet, spicy and tangy.

I made this the other day and am still trying to determine what I might have done wrong; it's much too sweet and much too vinegary for us!
I used Splenda, which is measured the same way sugar is, and cider vinegar, as called for.

I used this sauce on pulled pork sandwiches at a cookout last night and was blown away. I first I used my pork drippings to saute the onion with some garlic, celery, serrano peppers, and green bell pepper all finely chopped. Then I added the vinegar and made the sauce as written (with a dash of liquid smoke). Phenomenal!

Fantastic BBQ sauce !! I made it exactly as written and it is fabulous.  The only kind of bad thing is that is does make your house smell of vinegar for quite a while, even if you add all ingredients at once.  I plan on quadrupling or more this recipe to keep some on hand in the fridge !!!  Great sauce, my hubby loves it !!

Amazing! I used the directions and it turned out super duper hot. Maybe next time i'll go a little lighter on the cayenne. I used this recipe with the bbq chicken calzone recipe on this site and it was amazing!

Of course, you can mix things up while cooking this sauce, but I guarantee, as long as you follow the basics, everyone will love this. People have asked and received this for XMAS. I have heard people walking by on the street exclaim about the delicious smell while reducing the recipe. Awesome stuff! Gonna have to make another batch soon! Hint: Save some large GLASS bottles to store this in. I have trouble waiting for it to cool before bottling and plastic causes issues.

My favorite BBQ sauces are vinegar-based.  I've made a sauce in the past that uses a large amount of melted butter -  this is so much easier & healthier that this will be my choice from now on.  I read the other reviews and thought about cutting back on the amount of vinegar.  Glad I didn't...

We love vinegar, so this is THE sauce in our house from now on.

We sure liked it at our house - just enough blend of the sweet and the spicy for our tastes. The tangy little kick is a welcome surprise - and balances the brown sugar well.   And he's not kidding about the timing - the longer it cooks, the thicker it gets.  If you're using electric instead of gas, turn it off around 5 minutes early.  Can't wait to try it on ribs.  
Well done, Paul.

Followed recipe EXACTLY, BBQ sauce was okay.  Don't think I'll make it again, I've had better.  The thing that bothered me was that everytime I bit into my ribs, my eyes seem to burn a little, what fun is that?  Maybe too much vinegar or cayenne?  My whole house smelled like vinegar, 2 cups may be a little too much...similar recipes uses only 1/2 cup, etc.  I had to read recipe several times to see if I had made the mistake.

It was a bit too spicy for my taste. Thought it was going to be a bit more sweet and I had to wait too much time so it get tangy.

Excellent recipe. Goes well on nearly everything. I am not a fan of bottled bbq sauce so I looked for an alternative and this more than met my expectations.
