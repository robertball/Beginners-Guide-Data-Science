This is a very old Southern recipe. Southern women have been making this dish exactly this way for centuries. it is absolutely DEE LISH. We often serve it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was the first dish I learned to make 51 years ago at the tender age of 5. Fresh nutmeg is best. If you don't have nutmeg on hand use the same amount of cinnamon. For a spicier style use ground ginger, again fresh grated is best. You can also use frozen defrosted peaches or any type of berries. Thanks for handing along a classic and preserving a great tradition.

Used a cast iron skillet. Didn't have self-rising flour, but my handy-dandy Betty Crocker Cookbook told me that a substitute for 3/4 cup self-rising flour is 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1/8 tsp salt. Used about 8 fresh nectarines instead of canned and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top.

Nice quick recipe.  The family loved this.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and served it with cool whip on top.

This is an easy and great summer dessert.  Serve warm and add ice creme and its a hit!!  I use suger/cinnamon combo generously in place of the nutmeg! Because the cobbler portion is rich, feel free to use other fruit , too--strawberries, blueberries, apples...its all good!

Wonderful, easy cobbler!  My 8-inch pan was in the sink and I didn't feel like washing it so I made it in the 9x11 and yes, it was thin ... but turned out just great.  I'll be making this again.

There was entirely too much liquid for this recipe.  My cobbler turned out as what can only be described as gelatinous.  I double checked the recipe to make sure I didn't miss anything and I did not.  Needless to say...I won't be making this again.

I've found to use 1/2 of the milk and 1/2 of the peach syrup to mix with the flour mixture.

This is an easy recipe to throw together.  A little gooey and runny when warm but it tastes good.  After chilling it forms a type of custard with the peaches and a cakey top.  I am glad I made it, thank you.

Wow, that's amazing. That's what all who had this at the church last night said. My pastor who is a bit of a peach cobbler aficionado said it was was by far his favorite. Can you believe I got these reviews using canned peaches. Next time I will use one and a half cans of peaches. I listened to one of the reviews and only used half to the juice. Other than that, peach perfection. Thank you for making me look good.

Works well with berries too --- the only difference from the recipe I use are the amounts of the flour, sugar and milk - I go with a cup of each and a large can of peaches (I also add cinnamon and vanilla) and I sprinkle with sugar when the crust just begins to rise -- all totally optional except the five main ingredients -- I tried this and imo it was just a tad drier than the recipe I use but very tasty - I also tried one with frozen blueberries and canned peaches.

This also works well with canned cherries for a cherry cobbler and frozen blueberries (thawed). I've made it with frozen peaches and blueberries. YUM-O!!

I tried this recipe only slightly altered.  I added a dash of cinnamon and mixed part of the juice in with the milk when making the batter.  I increased the cooking time considerably (after about an hour and a half of cooking I gave up).  Perhaps the peaches I used were juicier, but mine turned out to what I can only call peach soup. If I make it again I will NOT all the peach juice or as much milk.  The soup did have a nice taste, so it wasn't a complete loss.
