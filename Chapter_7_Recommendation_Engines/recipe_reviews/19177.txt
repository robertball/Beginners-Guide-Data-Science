This cookie is a new family favorite and I will definitely make them again.  I omitted the cherries because I had already made some cherry cookies and didn't miss them at all. I also made batches with Andies mints and caramel kisses filling.  The cinnamon sugar seemed a strange combination with the chocolate, but the slight cinnamon aftertaste of the cookie is my favorite part.

These cookies may take a while to make, but they are well worth the effort!  I made 12 dozen for a cookie exchange at Christmas, and people are still talking about how awesome they are!  Thanks so much, Sallie.  I'll be making this one again.

These cookies came out great and were fun to make with the kids.  We did get a little creative with the toppings and strayed from the recipe.  We cut Andes Candies in half and put that on top with a small piece of a cherry.  (A whole cherry would've been too large.) The cookie itself was soft and chocolaty.   They had fun rolling them and making the thumbprint.  Then when they were baked they loved putting on the toppings!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I baked these for my Christmas Cookie Gifts and everyone that tried them was absolutely blown away! I had several co-workers of mine and some of my husbands say they were the best cookies they have ever had! I followed the receipe for some, dusted others with cinnamon and added mini-chocolate chips to yet others. Each batch was better than the last. Thanks for starting a Christmas tradition!

My family has really enjoyed this cookie. They are yummy, easy, and fun to make, but they do take some time after they come out of the oven to 'fill' so plan accordingly. I used a toothpick to swirl the white chocolate after it had melted a bit and because of the short cooking time, found that I had to completly finish each cookie sheet before I put the next in to bake. Be sure and add the half cherry on top, it adds lots of flavor to the cookie. Thanks for the recipe. It will be on my Christmas bake list every year from now on.

These cookies were delicious was looking for something different. I used the swirled chocolate chips (caramel) and added pecans. Really good!

I loved this recipe!.  I did modify it a bit the second time around.  I didn't use the cherries & I substituted regular chocolate instead of white.  This batch came out very rich & chocolatey!

I found this to be a fairly easy recipe but a long process. They were kind of dense, I think I will make them again, but I will make the cookies much smaller. Most people I gave them to said they broke off the outer ring of cookie and only ate the center to deal with the dense-ness better.

Perfection! They really aren't any more complicated to make than Snickerdoodles-- just 2 extra steps in making an indentation and adding the filling. I rolled them out to 1" balls and used an ice-cream scoop handle to make the indentation, before and after baking. We made a variety for a school party, using white chocolate chips w/candy canes or a single chocolate chip in the center, chocolate chips w/cherries, peanut butter & chocolate chips (swirled w/ a toothpick when melted)-- combinations are endless.  They looked wonderful & festive and went fast! These cookies hold their shape very well and are perfect to make ahead and freeze.  They don't crumble and aren't overly soft.  (Be sure to use butter, not margarine!) The cinnamon isn't overwhelming, just a perfect hint that adds to the interest of the flavors. It could be omitted if ones desires. I'll be making these every year!

So good. Made these for friends and family over the holidays. Many said I could go pro with these cookies. The cherry half is a must for these wonderful morsels.

A little more labor intensive than a standard cookie, but has a very nice presentation.  The cookie is dense,  so be sure to make them on the small side so you get a higher filling to cookie ratio.  Was worried about the addition of cinnamon, but it added a little something different to the cookie.

These cookies are fantastic.  The cherry on top adds a little extra something.  They can be a little time consuming to make so I had my husband roll the dough into balls while I did everything else...worked like a charm!

These were pretty good and not too difficult to make. I made them both with and without the cherries and liked them either way. For some reason, the last bite is the best for me!

I picked these cookies because the review was so good. I really didn't care for them that much. The teature was nice on them but the flavor was not that good.

These were pretty good - I did misread the directions a bit and added the whole 3/4 cup sugar to the dough instead of reserving 1/4 cup for rolling - no harm done, though, as the cookies tasted good.  We're not cherry fans, so I skipped those and did a mix of white and semi-sweet chocolate chips in the centers.  Pretty tasty, but does require some work.  My only recommendation is to use Ghirardelli White Chocolate Chips, as they melt much nicer than any other brand I've tried.

Awesome!  Melted some white candi-quik bars and spooned that into the middle of each and then had a variety of toppings pre-chopped (candy cane, almonds, pretzel bits, chocolate chips, sprinkles) and let my kids have a fun decorating party as they came out of the oven (transferred cookies to a cool sheet first so they wouldn't burn themselves on hot sheets).  Turned out beautifully - quite festive with all the different topping combos the kids came up!

These are pretty good. I only used the cookie part not the filling because I wanted to use mint flavored kiss as filling. I also used skorr pieces as filling and those ones seemed to be the favorite in my class. I tested them out on my class as I will be doing the bake sale for my husbands work so these are a deffinate yes. Thanks for the recipe.

These tasted OK right after we cooked them.  However, I ended up waiting about 2 days before I got to have another and they were amazing then! So, make them a day or 2 ahead of when you need them.  We put the cherry on ours and they looked cute and tasted wonderful.

A VERY pretty cookie indeed, and easy to make.  I don't think it had enough chocolate flavor, so I intend on adding more cocoa next time.  Using Dutch process cocoa would make it a more intense flavor.  I happened to have a half and half blend on hand (half plain, half Dutch).  My husband loved the hard exterior, chewy interior, and loved even more the creaminess of the white chocolate blending with the other flavors.  You can even top it with crumbled candy canes or starlight mints.  Make sure when mixing the flour/cocoa mixture into the butter mixture that you add a little at a time and mix it in thoroughly before adding more flour/cocoa mixture.

This is the only cookie my kids and I make at Christmas, and it is a tradition we all love.  I use dark corn syrup and Heath toffee bits (less work).  Yield is 48 cookies.  This can be a time intensive cookie to bake, so don't rush yourself with batches of cookies coming out every 7-8 minutes...make sure white chocolate chips go on as soon as the cookies are out of the oven, allow them to melt for several minutes, and then we like to stir the melted chips with a toothpick and quickly add the toffee bits and cherries.  I also find it helpful to drain the cherry halves on a paper towel before placing on the cookie.

These are tasty, but kind of a project to make. The first time I tried them, I think I didn't chill the dough long enough because they spread while baking and I ended up with one giant chocolate cookie. I tried them again and chilled the dough overnight and they didn't spread, but they were a bit on the crunchy side. I'd make them again because they are definitely festive, especially if you can find the white chocolate chips that have red and green stripes on them.

These were very good. I accidentally added the cinnamon to the dough instead of rolling the cookies in it, and I liked it better that way. I used crushed candy canes instead of cherries and toffee chips.  They were very Christmasy!

Made for a cookie exchange '08.  Made a very pretty presentation!  Easy, but, time consuming to make.  Tasted yummy...I wouldn't leave the cherry off! :)

This was one of the easiest cookies I have ever made. They were also really delicious. They are my new favorite cookie to make! I omitted the cherry on top as I thought it would be a bit much.

These were very good! Instead of doing the toffee thing, I put andes mints in the middle.  I also added a bit of mint extract to the sugar and then rolled the balls.  They tasted like thin mints!

I liked the cookies, but I could not get the chips to melt in them. The first batch I added the chips after baking, they did not melt. Second batch I added them before baking. Still, I could not get them to melt. I used white and peunut butter chips.

We made these for Christmas gifts this year and they were a huge hit with my family! They're very attractive once they're done, and they were delicious as well! They take a bit of time to make and top, but they were totally worth it. My uncle couldn't wait to dig in when we were opening presents, he'd already eaten several by the time we were done! I'd call that a win! :)

These will be on our cookie tray every Christmas! Others advice to work on one pan at a time as they come out of the oven is the best idea. Yum!!

These cookies are delicious!  The first tray out of the oven didn't have enough chips on it, but we learned from that and added plenty for the next batches.

Will definitely make these again.

I've made these cookies for years... I love the look of these cookies, and the idea that a small chocolate cookie could be the perfect vehicle to deliver bits of chocolate, heath bar and cherry into my mouth... I however, have to face the fact that they are JUST OK. There is nothing amazing about them. They are very pretty-- and can be made with ALOT of variation-- Heath bar, peppermint, candied fruit... But the cookie is dull... I love the way they look on my cookie trays at the holidays, but they are always the last to be eaten. :- /

I changed the filling because my kids don't like maraschino cherries. I tried two different fillings. I tried butterscotch chips with the cinnamon sugar and also andes peppermint chips with candy cane dust. The base cookie was just too bland and floury.  They looked pretty, especially with the candy cane dust but I wouldn't make these again.

Were alittle flatter than I would like and might've been able to use a little bit more flour to give them the look of what I'm used to a thumb print cookie looking like I am not a big chocolate fan and made them for something else overall I think there OK

These are very soft, delectable cookies.  In my oven, they had to be baked 9 minutes.  We will try them peanut butter chips and crushed reeses pieces next time.  Over all, a great recipe.
