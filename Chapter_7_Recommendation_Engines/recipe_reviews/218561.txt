Don't turn over the dumplings! just 10 min lid on 10 min lid off Perfect! Not your "old style" Chicken and Dumplings but, very good! If you don't like using can soup, do your own with stock and flour.

"Beginner" ?? The taste sure isnt! I continue to learn that many of the simplest recipes are the best. The dark meat of the thighs make a difference as they add to the flavour. In addition to dumplings I sometimes prepared egg noodles for those who like it served that way and frequently because the dumplings tend to disappear so fast! A very good 
recipe!
More thoughts:
To economise I've bought skin on bone in chicken (big $ difference). Using an oven & stovetop safe pot, the chicken can then be roasted in the oven at 350-375 degrees for approximately 30-40 minutes. Once cooled the skin & bones are easily removed. Any excess fat can be spooned off and the cooked crispy bits in the pot's bottom will add to the favour. At this point carry on as directed, perhaps choosing to omit the butter as the only change.
Healthorg's recipe is delicious as posted but I'm finding with the price of ready prepped chicken so dear, this can be a savings option by slightly altering only the method.
Cheers!

Delicious!! I substituted the the water and poultry seasoning with 6 cups of chicken stock. In also used a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own. My husband likes lots of dumplings so I made a double batch of dumplings. But it was so good!!

I am an intermediate cook,not a pro,not a culinary chef,and here's my take on chicken n dumplings for a beginner;I usually use thighs but any part will do.Boil chicken in water that covers pieces,use as many as you choose depending on how much you want.Boil for at least an hour and up to 1 hour and 15 min.Set pieces aside to cool.Drain all broth  through strainer into another pot then bring to a boil again.Add whatever seasonings you choose at this point.I use a little of each of sage,garlic,poultry seasoning-if I have it,salt and pepper.At boiling add dumplings either from scratch flour or use canned biscuits and cut each biscuit into fourths.Turn fire down to a med-simmer until dumplings swell.Continue another 20 min or so until broth thickens some.Pull chicken off bones chop into smaller chunks and add to mixture.Perfect every time.

Thank you very much!  My Grandma makes the best Chicken and Dumplings and this can almost stand up.  Great starter!!  I made my own broth and "gravy".  I also serve with collard greens and lima beans.

Wow!  We all loved this, and it was easy to prepare on a week night.  I used 3 large chicken breasts and omitted the thighs.  Had to substitute cream of celery for the chicken.  Tasted great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good! I have never made chicken and dumplings before and this recipe was easy and tastes great! Only thing I would change is dropping the bisquick mixture by the spoonful made the dumplings too big for my taste. I will make them smaller next time. Oh, and use chicken stock/broth instead of water. Just adds more flavor.

easy and can make changes as you like. i used cream of celery on hand. i had no bisquick so i used the following recipe and it made 30 dumplings and i added a dash of poultry seasoning to the dumplings for some flavor and it was a great idea!) DROP DUMPLINGS	 
In bowl, mix 1 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 heaping teaspoon baking powder. Add enough milk to make dough and stir with fork. Have chicken broth boiling in pan. Drop dumpling dough in broth by tablespoon full. Cover pan, reduce heat. Cook only 7 minutes.

A WINNER!  I used chicken thighs only and added potatoes and carrots.  I also skipped the soup and used my own broth and gravy.  I seasoned with some parsley and marjoram.  It was a WINNER for us!  Thank you heatherg for sharing!

This was delicious and easy. I used onion powder and chicken broth instead of bullion cubs ans water and all boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs. I added in a couple of stalks of cut celery instead of fresh onion and tossed in some frozen carrots and peas just before adding the dumplings on top. I wanted the broth creamier so I added another can of soup. Don't turn the dumplings over, I never have in any recipe and they always turn out fine without it. Use a large pan though as the dumplings rise a lot and they need to room to expand. Great recipe!

These chicken and dumplings are awesome, just like my Grandma used to make. Big, fluffy dumplings can't be beat compared to those egg noodles, not a fan of those here.

I made this for my twin 5 year old nieces and they loved it so much that one said, "Auntie, you are the best cooker in the whole wide world!" I used a 15oz can of biscuits and put only 11oz in the soup and saved the other 5oz as biscuit strips for the side. My nieces really enjoyed the different consistencies of the biscuits - wet and somewhat gummy, and the dry. Really easy to make and a great weeknight meal.

The flavor was good, but next time I will cut down considerably on the liquid (4 c. of water instead of 6.)  It was very watery this way.  I also added carrots and sugar snap peas.

Great! I used 3 breasts, substituted broth for water, added fresh chopped carrots and celery, substituted cream of celery for cream of chicken, and added some parsley and seasoned pepper. If its too thin, just throw in a handful of instant potato flakes an it'll thicken right up with no lumps! And don't turn dumplings... 20min lid on then 20 min lid off is perfect!

I made this recipe with shaking spoon in hand since I am not a big soup maker. But, from the first try, my whole family loved it! The changes I've made in subsequent times I've prepared this soup is: 1) use cream of celery instead of cream of chicken soup, 2) add 1/2 tsp. pepper to the soup 3) Add a small bag of frozen peas and carrots to the soup before adding dumplings 4) I use 2 cups of lowfat Bisquick for the dumplings. You don't need to turn them over really as you drop the teaspoons in, I find if I just stir them a bit and move them around so they cook, you're fine. My family loves this, and it's perfect for a cold day, or a day you want to make the soup early, and leave on the stove for the evening!

Boiled some potatos, carrots and celery in 3 cups of water with two tsp chicken bouillon.  When slightly soft added it to the pot with the chicken and onions, (only used boneless skinless thigh fillets cubed)and then added the cream of chicken soup.Will use less water next time, had to thicken with a bit of flour.  Did not flip the dumplings just put the cover on for 20 minutes and they came out perfect.  Husband said this dish was pretty close to what his grandma used to make therefore only 4 stars.  I will make again because it is an easy week night dinner.

I love chicken and dumplings and these are very good. Silky texture and perfect dumplings. I do not think this is a beginner recipe it's just simple and reliable. No beginner taste here. I've made it three times now. Consistently great. I used all thighs instead of the breast. I think they give more flavor and are less expensive. I used six thighs because that's how many were in the package, cut into about 1X1 inch cubes. I minced my onion really super fine. Same flavor but don't see them. If I have fresh celery I mince a couple ribs very fine. Again you get the flavor but don't see it much. I don't want to see vegetables in my chicken and dumplings. Goes against my southern heritage. If I have it I use store bought chicken stock (not broth) instead of water. If I use stock I leave out the poultry seasoning and bullion.  This recipe could get too salty real quick if not careful. Plenty of salt in the can of soup so I don't add any. I do use a little fresh ground pepper. I add 1 teaspoon rosemary from my herb garden (dried in the winter). Easy to get too much rosemary too so less is best. I do use canned evaporated milk instead of fresh. I sift my Bisquick and add slowly as I whisk into the milk. Everything else I did per the recipe. You can make this ahead and reheat for a hearty meal on a cold winter night. I don't want to try any other recipe. I love this one.

This is almost exactly how I make my chicken and dumplings except instead of water, bouillon cubes and poultry seasoning I just add chicken broth and I add some frozen peas and carrots mix to it and I don't flip the dumplings. Always a favorite comfort comfort food in my family.

Turned out very good.  My husband and his buddy really liked it.  I only used chicken thighs and I added some red peppers and mixed veggies to it.  Didn't use the poultry seasoning; substituted basil, parsley and some fresh chopped garlic.  One thing, the dumplings turned out too soft.  I don't know why???  Still good though.

This was my first foray into making chicken and dumplings myself. I grew up eating this tasty winter dish. I used pre-made biscuits instead. Next time I will follow the recipe. This time it came out as a broth instead of a cream. I also added carrots and celery, sauteing and seasoning them with the chicken. The flavor was amazing!

This was a good recipe. We used 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water. We also used five chicken thighs rather than get a separate chicken breast.  I also sprinkled with about a quarter teaspoon of pepper with the other seasonings.  Otherwise, we kept the recipe the same.  It was especially great that the recipe called for Bisquick because I am not a fan of refrigerated biscuits.

Very good with changes. Use rotisserie chicken, add celery cook with onions. Add cooked carrots. Use 4 bouillon cubes, use 5 cups water, add lots of ground pepper. Used biscuits but didn't like flavor of biscuits with it.  Used potato gnocchi in leftovers, much better.

The dumplings were absolutely flavorless.  Perhaps making some from scratch (not that difficult) would make this better.  I made this and no one wanted to eat the leftovers.  I even added some chopped baby carrots when I added the soup and water; still not worth eating.

This was pretty easy and I liked the flavor. I thought it was maybe a touch too soupy, because I had to dig to find the chicken and veggies (I added celery, carrots and peas with the dumplings). But can't complain. I also had to add an extra quarter cup or so of Bisquick to make a thick enough dough to drop in. I will make this again.

Very Good! Next time I'm going to add carrots and celery to make it a more complete meal! I also made a roux with butter, milk, flour & chicken stock instead of the canned soup--less chemicals. The kids LOVED it though!

This was so easy and awesome! I added garlic and lots of salt and pepper.  Omitted peas and used celery instead.  It was amazing!

Used this as recipe for cooking chicken and dumplings for the first time.  Wife loves them, but we omitted the onion due to taste preference.

Very good recipe.  When I first mixed the dumplings the mixture was very thin, like cake batter so I threw it out.  I mixed up a second batch of batter and very gently stirred and it turned out more like dough.  I guess I was just beating it too hard the first time.  Make the dumplings small to make sure they are cooked through.  I cooked mine 20 minutes with the lid on and 20 minutes with it off and it turned out perfect.

Made this even more flavorful by using the juices from a whole roasted chicken instead of bouillon and water. Baked at 375 for 35 minutes instead of on stove. Thanks for a great basic recipe I'll keep around.

I made this for me and my husband tonight for dinner, and it was so simple!  While it was time consuming because I added more vegetables, we both really enjoyed it.  And if I can make it, anyone can!
