I mostly made this recipe because I saw this made on Queer Eye, and I couldn't imagine what all the different ingredients would taste like together. I made this as written. I wasn't able to get all of the pepper skin off, but it didn't seem to matter. I measured everything and chopped everything before I started. This is not a chop as you go thing. Speaking of chopping, maybe get your family members or friends to help you chop. There is so much chopping. I also recommend getting pre-chopped walnuts and pre-extracted pomegranate seeds. It will save a lot of hassle. The flavors were mild and complex. I really liked it. I will likely make again.

This recipe has good flavors and textures. The filling was a little bland so I added cumin and cayenne. It was involved but I will definitely make it again.
