These are delicious, a lot of arm-wrenching stirring as mentioned in other reviews, and one caveat: these look a little, no, a lot like Santa's reindeer left some 'gifts' if you catch my drift - my husband and I had a good laugh after I started making them. To make things easier (and to distract from their look), using a mini-cupcake pan with paper liners, I simply pushed a 1/4" thick disk of dough into the bottom of the cup, pressed a kiss into it, pressed another 1/4" thick disk down around the kiss, and baked them for 6-1/2 minutes to compensate a little for any pan/heat absorption.

These are really good, but the time it takes and amount it makes really is not correct. Mine made double the amount (I was lucky I had both the time and extra kisses). Should it maybe be a tablespoon instead of teaspoon of dough? I also dusted with powdered sugar to dress them up a bit.

I drizzled white chocolate over these for a more festive presentation. I used 1 1/2t of dough around each kiss. Worked out very well. I was skeptical about the six minutes baking time, but it is right on! These are good straight from the oven, however, I'm not pleased with the way the kiss hardens up once its completely cooled. Probably won't make these again, sorry..

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. If my memory serves me right it was a Pillsbury Bake Off winner a few years back. I like to make all me Christmas cookie dough in advance and refrigerate or freeze it till needed, but this dough does not mold well unless used the same day it is made....it was crumbly and didn't hold together.

I found this recipe sounded better than the results tasted.  The 'fudge' dough tastes like the flour so it's more of a cross between fudge and brownie.  I'm not sure how this could be done in 19 minutes...took me over an hour!

These were excellent made with caramel kisses in the center.  I used one level tablespoon of dough for each and came up with about 45 bonbons.

If you love super-chocolately rich recipes, this is the one for you! I used closer to a tablespoons worth of batter for each kiss and I ended up using approx. 40 kisses instead of 60. For a more appetizing look, I put holiday colored sugar sprinkles on the cookies when they were still warm, and pressed the sprinkles into the cookies a little to make them stay. Next time I might try using the Almond Kisses instead, to break up all that gooey chocolate a bit! If you don't like the cookies once the kisses have cooled and re-hardened, try microwaving each cookie for about 10-15 seconds to re-melt the insides. Great with a glass of milk!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It tasted too much like flour and was way to thin to mold.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I might not have.  I do not reccomend

I made mine a little too big and they did look like reindeer poop.  I used Almond kisses, caramel and plain.  The caramel bled out during baking so I do not recommend using those.  These were just OK so I don't know if I would go thru all the effort to make again.

I make these all the time and I am always asked for the recipe. This was a winner from a Pillsbury Contest. The original recipe calls for 1 tbs of dough to be molded around the Hershy Kiss. It also calls for melted white chocolate  to be drizzled over the finished product. It makes a very nice presentation that way. I probably over measure my dough, but I usually get 55-58 bon bons.

I wanted to find a recipe using up some Hershey kisses and this one was perfect.  These were awesome, great warm and then great totally set up.  The picture with the recipe does not do them justice and mine didn't look like that at all.  They looked great and I sent them with my husband to work and everyone wants the recipe.

This was a really good recipie. The outside was delicous. For the candy kisses I used Hershey's. I have always loved Hershey's, but it this recipie is so good, that next to the cheap Hershey's, it doesn't taste good. So use another type of chocolate kiss, a richer one, and the whole recipie will be fabulous!

im a teen who loves to cook, and i wanted to bake something quick and easy for a party. these fudge bonbons are delicious and are awesome when made with carmel kisses. the carmel does make them sweeter, but not immensly. its a simple recipe for those who do not like to bake or dont have the time.

Fantastic!!!  I got more alot more than 60... more like 100. I would cover the dough as mine tended to dry out a little.  I also drizzled some melted white chocolate on the top to "fancy" them up a little.  Try this recipe... you won't be disappointed!!

I melted the choc chips and butter in the microwave. Added the sweetened condensed milk, microwaved it for 20 seconds. Added the rest of the ingredients and used the mixer.  They are good, but I don't crave them.

I have kind of mixed feelings about this recipe. They were a ton of work and I found the dough very difficult to work with, but it was well worth it  to eat them right out of the oven. When they're warm, they're absolutely fantastic. Very gooey and rich and melt in your mouth. But once they set up and the kiss hardened up, they weren't quite as good. I've tried to replicate the right out of the oven taste by putting them in the micro for 12 seconds - not quite the same but does the trick. Also, like others say, it makes way more than the recipe says.  I halved the recipe and still got 45.

I thought these were difficult to make and they still tasted like flour after they were baked.  I followed the recipe to the t, with the exception of adding a bit more vanilla than it called for.  

I would not make these again.

These turned out great! We experimented and made some with almond kisses, some with mint kisses, and some with caramel kisses ... each turned out well and made a nice assortment in a small candy box for my daughter's many teachers (phy ed, art, etc.).  It was an simple recipe that was easy enough for the eight-year-old to participate in, plus we doubled it without any problems. While we will make them again (I'm sure), I gave four stars instead of five because while good, I would not call them "the best".

These are simply OK. I made them for Christmas this year, and honestly I dont think I will put them on plates. They have a "dark chocolate" type taste, bc of semi sweet chips. It takes awhile to mold the dough and this recipe does make a ton of these. I probably wont make again.

I made these with my 5 year old daughter and had a great time. We used regular kisses, almond kisses, and caramel kisses. My family and coworkers absolutely loved them. Will definitely make them again!

So easy to make! 
Put 1.5 dozen in a cellephane bag, wrapped a Christmas ribbon at the top and gave it as gifts to my neighbours.

These cookies were great!  My son helped me wrap the dough around the kisses, which was an awesome bonus to making these yummy, chewy cookies.

We made this recipe with kids and used Rollos instead of Kisses.  It was easy and delicious and the stirring wasn't too bad.  The Rollos are a little hard to bite in half when they've cooled, so I wish I had gone with the Kisses.  Either way, this was an easy and fabulous dessert!

I've made these several times and always get rave reviews.  Try with different types 
of kisses.  The hugs really add a nice touch.  Beth in San Jose

These are really good if you are a chocolate lover.  Wrapping the kisses in the dough is a little tedious, but worth it!  I shape my dough just like the kiss so they look like big Hershey's kisses. 

I couldn't help but pop one in my mouth for every few I put on the cookie sheet!

Awesome!!  My 11 year old daughter and I made a batch to give to neighbors. They were so good the family ate them instead!  Very easy and fun even for little ones to help with.

these were soo good!  i added almond extract instead of vanilla and it gave them an interesting flavour... i also rolled then in red and green coloured sugar and some in cinnamon... they were excellent warm when the kiss was still melted in the middle and the exterior was cooled... i will definitely be adding these to my xmas baking list and experimenting with different things in the middle...
