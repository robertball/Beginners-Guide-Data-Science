I cut this recipe in half to make 12 muffins. I used whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of homemade pumpkin pie spice, I kept the baking soda at 1 teaspoon and upped the baking powder to 1 teaspoon and I cut the sugar down to a scant half cup. I used organic egg whites and organic zucchini. Before using the raisins, I soaked them in hot organic apple juice to plump them and drained them very well before adding it to the bread. I actually got 11 large muffins out of this recipe. This is scary-close to the tomato-soup spice bread Mom made when I was a kid. This was really super moist and flavorful. My husband REALLY loved these, eating four for breakfast and taking whatever was leftover from breakfast to work with him. This is a great way to use up pantry items you have on hand, especially the gazillion cans of tomato soup you end up buying on sale and stockpiling! Next time, I'd like to add some chopped pecans. 350* for 20 minutes was a perfect baking time for muffins.
