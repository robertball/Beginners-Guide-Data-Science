Try substituting coconut oil for the butter, it also works well and  is a healthier option.

Was easy, and Tasty. I split the amounts in half. I did add some All-Bran cereal, chopped dates and coconut flakes. I'm pretty sure I could have added whatever fruit or cereal appealed to me and it would've been good. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet. Definitely will make again. Maybe put in dry apples and cinnamon next. It's a very good base. Great topping for yogurt.

This was very delicious and easy! I made it for my kids so they could have it in the morning and gobbled it down.

Very good! I used maple syrup instead of honey, coconut oil instead of butter, raisins instead of cranberries, and added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.

Makes a ton and is really easy.  My kids enjoyed it too.  I added some Chex cereal, marshmallows and white chocolate chips.  I think it was almost too sweet when I did that as it has a good taste all by itself!
