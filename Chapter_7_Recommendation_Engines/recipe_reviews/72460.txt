Being big fans of cardamom, we knew we had to try these...with a couple alterations.  Double the cardamom -- trust us, it's the thing to do.  And we used whole almonds, not for any culinary reason...just because we're lazy.  We found that chilling the cookies before baking them helped them retain their shape better than just tossing them in the oven.  And speaking of the oven -- the first batch just came out.  Five stars, two thumbs up, ten out of ten...pick your rating system.  We can't do it for you -- gotta go have another cookie.

This isn't a recipe that will appeal to all taste buds because the cookies are more flavored than sweet, but we sure like them.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, I do think the cookies benefit from a little vanilla extract, brown sugar and salt, but the cardamom is key. If you're using the packaged variety, you'll probably want to triple the amount, but using the actual cardamom pods makes a huge difference and really gives these cookies their flavor. I'm the first to admit you can't buy the pods everywhere (and if you do, they are on the pricey side), but if you have them, use them! (To extract cardamom: lightly brown pods in a pan over high heat - but don't overdo them! - remove cardamom seed from shells and crush using a mortar and pestle. For the leftover pods, I occasionally add them to my tea like the Lebanese do.) Also, this is one of few cookie recipes that turns out better using the old fashioned bowl & spatula method rather than the mixer. Finally, make sure your butter is softened (place in microwave for 25 seconds) to ensure a good dough.

The cookies are great (I used 1 heaping teaspoon of cardamom, as recommended in other reviews) but I found they weren't sweet enough for me. So on my second batch I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract (as well as using 1 heaping tsp of cardamom again). That made cookies that were slightly sweeter and still had a good cardamom taste.

In my oven it only took 17 minutes; the first time I checked them at 20 minutes and they were already overbrowned. So I'd suggest keeping a close eye on the first batch to determine how many minutes they need in your oven, since it's very important not to overbake these cookies. The flavor is delicate enough that if you overcook them, the "overbrowned" taste will overwhelm the flavor.

Since I'm lazy, I just made them as drop cookies. They cooked just fine as drop cookies.

these are wonderful!!!  You must try for something very different.  I have had ghroubah in Tunisia and found them to be good but dry (I think they make theirs with semolina flour so they are a bit more gritty) and these were far better!  Thanks to kellimelli for the suggestion of more cardomom...definitely a must do! I added a HEAPING teaspoon of cardomom.  I used my cookie press to make them so pretty and omitted the almonds.  So few ingredients make them perfect..but u will want to double the recipe.  These are intended for a care package to my inlaws in Tunisia...I am sure they will impress coming from their American daughter-in-law!  **Make sure your butter is at room temp....and keep beating and it will eventually come together to form a dough ball.

These were delicious. I doubled the cardamom and added a pinch of salt and everyone thought they were the best version of shortbread cookies they'd ever tried.

The cookies come out a little bit crunchy, but if you think of them as cardamom shortbread, it's great!  The flavor and aroma are wonderful.

Very very good (and simple!) cookies.  Since it said it only made two dozen, I doubled the recipe the first time I made it and, like others, added more cardamom, about a total of 2 tsp.  I also added 1/4c brown sugar and about 1 tsp vanilla extract, and omitted the almond.  Instead of shaping them into wreaths, I just rolled them into "fingers."  They turned out great.

I loved these cookies. I used a little more cardamom and made them in a standard cookie shape with a whole almond pressed in the center. It has a wonderful exotic flavor, and it's just perfect for a snack with a cup of tea.

This is a lovely cookie recipe. I did not use the almonds on each cookie. Some of them I left plain and a few others I dressed up with turbinado sugar. The recipe made approximately 60 cookies. I rolled them into balls and flattened them. The flavour is amazing. I baked them for 6-8 minutes. I guess mine were smaller. The next time I may add more cardamom. This will be a great Thanksgiving and Christmas addition. Thank you ladyheather06.

DELICIOUS! I love cardamom and I love butter cookies so this is the perfect match for me. In my second batch, I pre-toasted the almonds and that made them much more crunchy and yummy in the cookies. The only funny think is that my Egyptian husband says these are nothing like "actual" ghoraiybah. Oh well, I suppose it could be a regional difference. Whatever it is, I love it!

Per reviews, I doubled the cardamom, added 1 tsp vanilla & 1 Tbsp brown sugar.  Taste like cardamom shortbread.

These are excellent. I added 1/8 C brown sugar, some vanilla and use 1/2 T of cardamom, and only needed to cook mine 15 minutes, and they are sooo tasty! yum yum.

I followed the recipe, grinding my own cardamom and leaving off the almonds.  This isn't a sweet cookie, but it's great with tea or coffee - crispy, light, and nicely spiced.  A cookie press makes for a very pretty presentation.  Next time I'll add some rosewater or orange blossom water.

The traditional way of making ghoraybah is by adding a few drops of Arak (lebanese spirit). It gives it such a distinct flavor.

I was short on time but desperately wanted to try this, so I made a double batch and treated it like my favorite shortbread recipe--I pressed the dough into a 15" jelly roll pan lined with foil, baked for 35 min.  For the double batch I used a heaping tablespoon (yes, TABLEspoon) of ground cardamom.  (I did not add brown sugar or vanilla as others have suggested, just upped the spice.  It doesn't need it, really!)  It turned out very well, though I think I may add even more cardamom next time!

These were delicious. I added 1 heaping teaspoon as suggested in other reviews, but I didn't find it was enough when tasting the uncooked batter, so I added more. I sorta dropped the bottle in!!! I got some out, but all in all, I probably had the approximate amout of 1 tablespoon and they were perfect.  I do NOT think they need any extra sugar (as suggested), they are plenty sweet as is.  I rolled out the dough and used a cookie cutter. They came out nice after 15 mins of baking, but they were probably thinner than in the original recipe (yield was of 24 and I got 37). I didn't add any almonds.  I also don't think it is necessary to grease the cookie tray. They have tons of butter already. I lined mine with parchement paper and when I took it out of the oven, the paper was dreanched with oil.  I will definately make these again.

It was weaker on the cardomom taste then what i wanted and i added 4 times the cardomom. It was also very crumbly but that could be due to my extra cardomom added in.

I actually thought these were really bland. I just heaped the cardamom instead of doubling it, and I added a pinch of salt, but so far I still don't think they were worth the time. The only ones that turned out well were the ones I added some sesame seeds to. Maybe I'll try to rescue the others with some icing.

This is a great, basic recipe. I've used it a few time already - sometimes just the way it's written, and sometimes with my own tweaks. I usually just make balls that I flatten with a glass before baking. I prefer more cardamom, and sometimes I add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Even then, this is not an overly sweet cookie. It comes out light and crispy, not heavy or dense. A very delicious butter cookie and a nicely versatile recipe.
