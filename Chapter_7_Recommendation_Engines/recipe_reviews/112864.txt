This recipe needs more moisture. It's as heavy as a ton of bricks without it.

Followed recipe exactly, except for using lo-fat cream cheese.  Toothpick came out dry at 48 min.  Removed from oven.  Cake fell big-time.  Taste is O.K., but texture is weird! What could be changed?

When I made the cake, it was very dense, a bit dry and not as tender as I expected.   Maybe I cooked it too long, although I cooked it the minimum time.  The only change I made to the recipe was fat-free cream cheese.  However, it had a great flavor, so I'll make it again.

This cake was excellent. It has the "heaviness" of a traditional pound cake.  The flavor and texture are much better after it is totally cooled.  I have made this twice with the same results.

This cake was easy to make with ingredients that were around the house.  It tasted great and I used low fat cream cheese, egg beaters, and smart balance.  Will definitely make again!

I wanted to try this recipe just to see how it would come out. Boy was I surprised.  Great taste, and cream cheese to boot. Tasted just like my mom's.
