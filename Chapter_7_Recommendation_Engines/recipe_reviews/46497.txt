Nice recipe, easy to make, interesting concept.  Maybe because of the way I measured it, I found the molasses flavor a little strong.  If I do this again I would reduce the molasses to one tablespoon (overflowing).  I would also reduce the sesame seeds to one tablespoon.

This was fabulous! My husband even went back for seconds (and he NEVER has seconds on broccoli). My teenage daughter loved it too!  I added some green onion right before adding the sauce. Turned out great!

Didn't like this dish--the flavors of the sauce don't complement the broccoli--everything felt like it was clashing.

I am not sure why, but ours had a bitter taste to it and no one would eat it.  Aside from the bitterness, the flavors blended together well.

Sorry but this recipe doesn't even beat plain buttered broccoli.  The oranges don't do a thing for it. I'll go back to adding a cheesy sauce like Cheez whiz with salsa.

I am trying this recipe but altering it slightly. Using honey instead of molasses (I feel molasses is far too strong for this), adding a touch of garlic, reducing the amount of peanut oil and am using an asian stirfry frozen veggie mix with soybeans in it to make this a main dish served over brown rice. I am not sure exactly how it will turn out, but having made similar things before, it sounds like a hit. I love using the mandarin oranges as part of the sauce as I don't usually keep orange juice on hand but those I do...this makes it an easy, easy dish to whip up.

This was really good - more flavorful than I was expecting. I'll definitely make it again, but I might try reducing the molasses a little and possibly adding some garlic.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the dish in an effort to employ a recent harvest of Mandarin Oranges and Romanesco Broccoli. I served this over long grain brown rice. I liked it and plan to make it again.                                                                                                                                            Pro's: Sauce was so delicious that I was sorry there wasn't more of it. Next time I will double the recipe for the sauce.                                                           Con's: The oranges. I tried 'em and I just don't prefer warm or cooked oranges. Next time I will either omit the oranges entirely or add them at the very end and not cook them.  But the OJ for the sauce was great.                                                                                                                                                    I made a few changes, as follows: 1. Used honey instead of Molasses and added garlic like other reviewer suggested. 2. Added 2 sliced green onions and sauteed with garlic in oil to extract garlic flavor. Next time I will add the onion later in the cooking process as to not cook it too long. 3. For the health of it I used EVOO instead of peanut oil and less than the recipe called for. 4. Used Romanesco instead of broccoli and sauteed for a couple of minutes then added 1/2 C of H2O, covered and steamed for about 5 minutes with the oranges like the recipe calls for.  5. Added slivered almonds along with the sesame seeds.

It was okay, but I didn't feel that the falvours really married well. I don't think I'd make it again

This was a good recipe. I would make it again. I did use sesame oil instead of the peanut oil. The sauce was a little bit bitter--maybe I cooked it too hot and burned the molasses a little--not sure. Overall, a good recipe.

This has been a staple in my recipe box for years.  One of my favorite go to quick broccoli sides.  We love the depth the molasses gives the orange sauce.  Although truthfully I really don't like mandarin oranges they really work in this.

This went well with our homemade Chinese food dinner.  I liked the flavors just fine, but I went with honey, not molasses.  I believe the flavor of molasses would have been too dark and heavy and we would not have liked it as much.  My chief complaint is the sauce did not thicken at all and was far too watery.  It seemed like cooking down half of the oranges was a waste and the juice should have sufficed for the orange flavor in the sauce.  Also, I did not want to use the full amount of sesame seeds...would've been too much.  Would make again, following my modifications.
