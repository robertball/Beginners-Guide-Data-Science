well jap chae isn't always this plain. Try adding pan fried spinach, finely sliced carrots (use a Mandolin), sliced shitake mushrooms, and if you want to add some kind of protein other than the mushrooms you can add finely sliced striped of meat ^^!~

I am the publisher of this recipe, and just wanted to mention, as I said, this is definitely not a real Jap chae, it is more of an appetizer that is sweet and very delicate. There are many wonderful Jap Chae recipes on this site that include vegetables and meats.

This turned out great. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, perhaps adding a bit more brown sugar to fit my taste. The second time, I just boiled the vermicelli as I would regular pasta - it cooked WAY faster. I also skipped the skillet part, because the first time my noodles stuck and it made no difference in taste. Instead, I just added a bit of sesame oil - a little goes a long way here - and tossed the noodles with the sesame seeds. The oil seemed to bring all the flavors together much better than the first time.

I have been looking for this recipe for a while and I am glad that I found. It tastes very good, and the roasted sesame seeds adds such a nice flavor to the dish.

this was good. i used more sesame oil for flavor. the kids love this. i went out to buy korean soy sauce just because its not as strong. & at one point i added meat & cabage with shredded carrots. for color. it became a meal. but this was great.

I mixed about 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil with the soy and sugar. I also added some blanched spinach, and garnished the finished product with thinly sliced eggs.

Super yummy. I tossed in a chopped up green onion and all I had was dark soy sauce but I cut it down to 1/8th cup IF THAT...  I just finished my meal and I'm super satisfied.  Maybe next time I'll toss in some greenery and chicken and make it a little more substantial. =D

For being such a simple, quick recipe, it was absolutely fantastic! It's a good base start and then allows you to throw in whatever you'd like! I cut up some sirloin into small strips, seared it, and added that to it. I also added mushrooms, water chestnuts, green onions, and sesame oil. It turned out fantastic!
Thanks for the recipe!

my mother in law is Korean, only get special real Korean,  she does come in town.. my husband likes this so that's a thumbs up for me :-). thank you for this very easy recipe. I mix sautéed vegetables such as sweet onion, celery, green pepper,  and use it as a side dish with grilled steak. I used low-sodium soy sauce and sometimes  sautéed vegetables in light  sesame seed oil when I have it. topping green onion.. everybody's a critic, this is an easy play around recipe for first time international cooks!!

i scaled this down to one since i wanted to use up some leftover rice vermicelli.. other than using rice vermicelli the only other tweak i did was to use sesame oil in place of veggie oil.. this was such a nice little snack.. anyone who complains about this not having the traditional meat/veggies need to read closer.. those who added on to this have the right idea.. i cant wait to try this with the additional meats/veggies for a full meal.. ty for this recipe

I needed a quick easy dish to take to a potluck. I had some glass noodles and this was the first recipe that popped up.
I made it as written with the sauce although for some reason I was reading sesame oil. Used that but I dont think there is much a difference.
I did add carrots and green onion. 
Delicious and my kids were eating before we even left
I wonder though as it really is sweet if I cut the sugar back.

Really good and basic recipe! I suggest waiting to cut noodles after they’ve soaked. Also it’s best served cold.

Yummy, just as promised. I added a healthy, heavy-handed squirt of Sriracha. I also added some chopped chives at the end. Thank you for the recipe.

This is my son's favorite meal ever! He could probably eat this every day. I made it exactly as the recipe said (he's not a very big meat easter, so it's perfect the way it is for him) and I made bibimbop and my son plus family and friends gobbled or all up faster than I could dish out. I'm actually making it again tonight. Thank you so much for the wonderfully simple recipe.

I made this with a few variations. I did use 1/2 cup of soy but used Aloha Shoyu which has a less salty flavor.  I used a box of thin rice noodles instead of vermicelli and before adding the noodles to my wok, I put carrots, mushrooms and green onions in. It was awesome. 
I'm sure it would go well with thinly sliced chicken or shrimp. Very good recipe!

I loved this recipe! As did my boys and husband! It turned out just exactly how I wanted it to, just saucy enough and not too salty. I wouldn't change this recipe at all.
