I made these twice so far. The first time I omitted the nuts, added a bit more cinnamon, they turned out great, they stay soft forever. The second time I added dried cranberries and everyone at work loved them! I keep a sheet of foil a rack below the cookies so they don't burn on the bottom, as they have a longer cook time (15 mins was perfect). I'll definitely make these again.

We all loved these!  I used ww flour.  Instead of white sugar, I used a 1/2 cup of succanant with honey and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.    Also used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the shortening.  

Great

excellent - had the ripest bananas ever and needed something to make quick... substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar...added one tsp of vanilla, added lots of fresh blueberries!  They were awesome - baked at 375 degrees for 16 minutes on baking stones = they were perfect.

These are fantastic.  I used to beg my grandma to make these same exact cookies when I was little.  We always made them with chocolate chips.  On an interesting note, my grandmother told me that she found this recipe in the newspaper during WWII.  It was a good recipe to send to the troops because it shipped well and did not use rationed goods.

These cookies are amazing!!!!  I divided the dough into 3 parts and baked one part just as the recipe states, added walnuts to one part, and mini chocolate chips to the other part.  I baked mine for only 10 minutes and they do not need a minute more!!  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

The only thing I added was a little bit of cinnamon, and these were wonderful!  They didn't last 24 hours!  I was surprised at the negative reviews.  I have found that when you cream the shortening and sugar, it makes a huge difference in the texture if you don't mix it well enough. Other than that, I don't know why anyone who likes banana bread wouldn't love these!

I'd rate it higher but I made some changes that I think made these especially good.  I know how people hate when others tweak recipes but I just couldn't bring myself to use the shortening.  Instead, I subbed 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/4 c. butter.  Rather than using 1 c. of white sugar, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  I also added 3/4 c. chocolate chips and omitted the nuts.  These were amazing!  It's a cookie that is somewhat healthier than the standard chocolate chip but is just as delicious!  Next time I may try using agave nectar instead of sugar to make it even healthier.  Thanks for providing a yummy alternative to a regular oatmeal raisin cookie.  :)

KEEPER!  The kids thought that these were great.  I (as always) made them egg free for my egg allergic 16 mo. old, (by adding an extra banana mashed w/ baking powder).  There was no notice of the oatmeal, which made them even better.  I also added chocolate chips, for a nice but sweet after school snack.  Thanks Pam ;)

This recipe WOULD be a 5 star, however; DO NOT bake at 400F! Mine were burnt to a crisp and the oven was smoking after about 10 mins! I tried a second batch at 350F for about 13 mins.

These are really good.  I have made them many times with great success! They stay into a nice plump, muffin/cake type of consistency cookie.  It's very moist and has the right amount of banana flavor.  It's a great & different way to bake with banana. I needed to bake them for only 10 min.(At the stated Temp of 400)  It's a kid pleaser! Excellent.

Fantabulous!  These taste just like little Banana Bread bites.  They are hearty, but not heavy--everyone was surprised when I told them there were oats in it.  This recipe is on the top of my list for overripe bananas.

400 for 15 minutes is too much.  After 2 batches of nearly burnt cookies, I finally got it right.  Bake at 375 for 12 minutes.   Perfect.

Love these cookies.  I always add chocolate chips to get a fix for my chocolate craze.  I found that I have to cook them from 10 to 13 minutes.

Great recipe and easy to make healthier with delicious results! My substitutions were as follows: 
**flour = whole wheat flour   
**3/4 c shortening = 1/2 c applesauce & 1/4 c olive oil   
**1 c sugar = 1/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar
**quick oats = regular oats (more noticeable in cookie because they are less processed and bigger)
**decrease salt to 1/2 tsp

These were DELICIOUS and went great with my coffee this morning :)  I added some white chocolate and dark chocolate chips and sub'd pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I think next time, I'll try adding white chocolate chips with dried cranberries.

These cookies are very good.  I made the following changes which I think give them a 5 star rating.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, I added a tsp of vanilla extract, I did not have any eggs on hand so I substituted 2 tbsp of Hellman's mayo, omitted nutmeg and put in only 1/2 tsp cinnamon and added 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.  Also I baked them at 350 for 15 mins and they came out perfectly golden.  So good!

The flavor was great, but I think I would rather have either an oatmeal cookie or banana bread. It turned out like a cake cookie- not the texture I was hoping for.

Very tasty cookie. I had to lower the temperature to 325F. The first pan that came out at 400F was burnt on the bottom and a little raw in the middle. After temp adjustment all was perfect. Love the flavor of these cookies.

I used 3 small bananas for my 1 cup, omitted the nuts and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. I also increased the cinnamon and nutmeg. Great cookie! Next time, I'll try more applesauce and whole wheat flour in an attempt to make it healthier. This is a great recipe for those overripe bananas that isn't banana bread!

Good way to use leftover bananas (I used 3) and good way to get a picky toddler to eat banana bread.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce rather than the shortening.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, and skipped the nuts.  Reduced the cooking time to about 10 minutes.  Made about 30 large cookies.  Cookies don't flatten and as a result, look and taste like little banana bread lumps (not the most attractive).  I did sprinkle a little sugar on top to add some sweetness.  Stay very moist, and are great to eat for breakfast.

Oh my gosh- these are just about the most awesome cookies!! And just 'cause I know that raisins and chocolate chips compliment bananas, I added some in too. One thing I tried from reading another post was I only baked them for 13 minutes and they came out perfect. Moist, chewy, fragrant, delicious - even pretty to look at because they remind me of something Laura Ingalls would have come home to after school. HEALTHY too! One of the best cookie recipes I've tried on this site so far. Thanks so much for sharing :).

These were a hit!  I followed the recipe mostly but made the following changes:  1.) I didn't have eggs, so I omitted it and added 1/2 tsp. Baking Powder instead. 2.) I used 1 tsp. Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. allspice - no nutmeg.  Mine baked for about 11 - 13 minutes.  Yum!

I found this to be an EXCELLENT recipe.  I was using frozen bananas up this weekend and looking for a good recipe with some nutritional value.  I didn't substitute any ingredients - I did add some dried cranberries, per someone's suggestion.  These cookies rise nicely and stay soft.  I only had rolled oats, not quick oats and they taste great.  LOTS of banana flavor to these.  I'll be making these again!

These just came out of the oven and are wonderful.  Here's what I did.  I only had 1/2 cup shortening so I added 1/4 soft butter.  I had three small frozen bananas I thawed and used juices as well.  I used half white half brown sugar.  Half whole wheat half all purpose flour.  I didn't have nutmeg and increased cinnamon to 1tsp.  I left out the nuts and did one tray plain and the rest with 1/3 cup mini choc chips.  The banana flavor is great (not weak, not too over powering) and I can see leaving out the chips and nuts all together.  A keeper recipe!  I'll be freezing the majority of the dough so I have my fingers crossed that they freeze well too.

Pretty decent cookie..although very cake-like in texture.  Changes I made are as follows:
Used 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup WW flour.
1 teaspoon of cinnamon.
1/2 cup butter with 1/4 cup applesauce to replace the shortening.
1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 full cup.
2/3 cup of raisins and no nuts.
Baked at 350 for 15 min.

Love these.  They are a nice change from banana bread, as you can just grab and go, rather than slice. They do have the texture of a muffin, so I would agree that they are a 'muffin top'...soft and moist and they do stick together a bit, just as bread or muffins would. They oatmeal also gives a nice texture, with more substance.

Hmmm...banana bread cookies.  That's what they should be called.  They're not like your typical cookie...they're more like...well, exactly like you would expect a banana bread cookie to be.  Pretty good, even though.

I want to like this recipe but it seems like they just keep burning. I followed the directions exactly the first sheet and they burned so I tried the second sheet of cookies at less time and they still burned. I am trying them now at a lower temperature. I cannot say this recipe is good when the directions burned the cookies.

These are wonderful cookies.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, adding only 1/4 tsp. of cardamom to the recipe with the nutmeg because I love cardamom.  I plan on playing around with the recipe to make it healthier... half whole wheat flour, maybe, or some wheat germ or ground up flax seed.  I also want to try it with brown sugar.  UPDATE: Yesterday my eleven year old son said, "Wouldn't it be great if we lived somewhere where we could grow wheat next to bananas?"  I asked why he would want to do that, and he said, "So we can grow all the ingredients for your banana cookies ourselves!"  I guess he REALLY likes them!  My fifteen year old, who really doesn't like cookies, ate a few and said that they were the exception to her 'no cookie' rule.

Great idea to use up bananas! Just a little bland so definitely add that swirl of frosting to jazz them up!

I added most of the ingredients and the cookies still came out wonderful. I think these are the best cookies I've ever made. I used wheat flour instead of white, I used olive oil instead of shortening, and I added cinnamon and dried cranberries.

A good cookie - very cakey - so make sure you like that type of cookie.  Also - you should totally spray a little Pam on the cookie sheet before putting the dough on!!!!  A must!  I added some vanilla bean paste - because I like a lot of vanilla flavor.  These are good with milk - or heat up one in a bowl and put a spoon of vanilla ice cream over it.

I used 1/2 cup margarine and 3 bananas instead of 3/4 cups shortening and 2 bananas.  Really good soft cookies with strong banana flavor (and since my bananas were REALLY overripe, I only put in about 1/2 cup sugar).

These are good.  The 2nd time I added chocolate chips too.  I think I am going to try using applesauce instead of shortening.  I usually do that when I recipe calls for oil.  I'm not sure how they would turn out in this recipe.  I am going to try.

Nice soft cookie.  I used 1/2 cup light brown suger and 1/2 cup white sugar in place of the 1 cup of white sugar.  I also reduced the cooking time to 10 minutes and the cookies turned out perfect.

Delicious! I was hesitant to make these because some of the pictures had that uncooked look I have obtained in the past with oatmeal cookies. But mine turned out with nice colouring. I used 1/3 wheat flour and added some vanilla and extra cinnamon. Also, my ripe banana had been in the freezer awaiting such a recipe, so it was also browned thoroughly. I'm sur these things contributed to the colour, so I'm pleased! 10 minutes was exactly the right amount of time in my oven.

Not happy with these. Burned the first batch - 400 and 15 min was way too much. Had better results at 350 and 12 min. The cookie still ended up with a pasty texture and not much flavor.

I needed a recipe that used up my 5 overripe bananas. I usually make banana bread, but I got tired of doing that or muffins. I saw this recipe for banana oatmeal cookies and decided to try it out.  The amount of mashed bananas dictated the amount of cookie dough I was gonna make. I tripled the recipe, but omitted the nuts. Followed it exactly (cept I watched the cookies to make sure they didn't burn, it ended up that baking it for 13 minutes was perfect!) and oh boy, they are soooo good! Just like little banana breads, but in cookie form.  It's not a crispy cookie, but a more cake-like cookie. Definitely will make these again when I have some overripe bananas to use up.

These were AWESOME.  I actually added 2 cups of banana's, which made them very flavorful, and moist, added one cup of chocolate chips, with the nuts, and wowie!  My new favorite cookie.  Sent some to my son in Arizona, and he said they shipped well too! (didn't crumble all apart.)

You know these were made to go on a assorted holiday cookie plate for a gift and I didn't give it to them.  Reason being I thought the texture was too strange.  It was a really soft cookie and it just tasted strange.  It wasn't terrible but a few is enough.

I thought this recipe was great.  I didn't actually make them, my husband who is retired made them for the hockey team my son coaches.  I could have just kept eating.  Good thing I didn't have a cup of coffee handy to have with them.  Definitely a make again.  (The kids loved them too)

We enjoyed these cookies at our house.  I substituted butter for the shortening (minus 1/2 tsp. of salt as described on the AllRecipes substitution page :http://allrecipes.com/howto/common-ingredient-substitutions/).  I also split the dough into 2 groups before mixing in any nuts, and added 1/3 cup of dried cranberries in one half, and 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips In the other half, omitting the nuts entirely.  I was also a little short of the 1 & 3/4 cups of oats, but the texture was fine.  I baked them at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, with 2 batches I the oven at a time.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe! It was like eating a  slice of banana bread; cakey and moist on the inside, and adding a crunchy oatmeal layer around it.  Truly wonderful.  Next time however, I will reduce temperature to 350F. At 400F as written in the recipe, I had too much browning at the bottom before the tops were set enough.  Storing in an airtight container made the cookie soft through out (although I put them in after cooling compeletely).  But that's how the kids like their oatmeal cookies anyway:)) winner!!

These were very tasty! I used a bigger cookie scoop (probably a little over 1 tablespoon per cookie) and they only took about 10-12 minutes to bake, so watch them carefully.  My first tray was a little over done.  I made some browned butter frosting to go on top of the cookies which was the perfect touch.

This is a great recipe! I was looking for something to do with the old bananas beside always making banana cake. My only change would be omitting the nutmeg. It over powered the flavor of the bananas.

These were great!! I had 4 over ripe bananas so I ended up making a double batch on my first try..... glad I did.  I read other reviews and changed 1/2 the sugar for brown sugar.  I left out the nuts so the kids could take them to daycare and added raisins instead. SOOOO Yummy!

Yummy!! I made a double batch of these cookies because I had so many ripe bananas I needed to use. They were gone withing 24 hours! My husband and kids LOVED them. My husband said they tasted like muffin tops! They are moist and delicious. I recommend these to anyone who loves banana bread :)

Surprised at all the positive reviews on these. The flavor is good, but they look like and have the consistency of a Bisquick biscuit. A very dry Bisquick biscuit.

Light, fluffy, and delicious!  I increased the cinnamon to a full tsp. and also added about 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips.  When they cooled, I drizzled the tops with melted vanilla candy coating wafers.  The texture is so light and airy that you want to just keep eating them.

I honestly dont know how to bake without changing a recipe to suit either what I have or what is needed. I doubled the recipe, used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter, instead of shortening; added 2 tsp vanilla; and added a bag of butterscotch chips... baked 15 minutes on a cookie sheet lightly coated with butter flavored cooking spray..... my husband and children have once again deemed me a goddess :D even after making them clean up the baking mess :D

This recipe is wonderful. I used a bit more bananas, and old-fashioned oats instead of the quick cooking variety. I drizzled the vanilla frosting on top (from a can, heated in the microwave until liquidy) like photo 1 shows. I will be making these again.

I just made these cookies. I thought they were a little bland. I made them as written. Next time I'll change it by using brown sugar and upping the spices a bit to give them more flavor.

YUM! My first try at making banana cookies and this recipe is a keeper.  The bananas were piling up in my freezer so I had to try this.  Just thawed a few of them out and mashed it up. I also used butter flavored Crisco and it makes them melt in your mouth. Will try small chocolate chips, since the cookies are small. Thanks for sharing!

These have more of a muffin texture instead of a cookie.  Mine did not spread at all, so they resembled mini muffins.  My two year old enjoyed them, but I don't know that I will make them again.

The overall taste was good, but the consistency and texture did not feel like we were eating cookies. I follwed the recipe exactly and ended up with cookies that were more like muffin tops. Still tasted pretty good.

I didn't think they had much flavour, were pretty bland as is. Also, personal taste, I don't like a soft cookie and that's what these are. I was just desperate for a banana recipe that wasn't bread, so I made them. They did not travel well, as stated, but were crumbly, soft and fell apart. Not a great cookie to eat while you're driving! But outside of personal taste, I still can't give them more than 3 stars without playing with the recipe. Back to the drawing board.....

While my boyfriend loved these cookies, I didn't really care for them.  I had a hard time keeping them from burning on the bottom and even lowered the oven temp to try to prevent this.  It still didn't really work.  We had to scrape off the bottom of the cookies.  Also, they were kind of soft.  I like a cookie that has a little crunch to it.  I did add chocolate chips to some of them and those were better than the plain ones.  I may make them again but only on request.

These are good but the baking times were a little off (at least for me, and my oven is pretty reliable).  I baked my first batch to 13 minutes before I gave up and took them out.  They weren't burnt, but they were much more brown than they should have been and they turned out a little dry.  My second batch I took them out at 10 minutes, just when they had browned a little, and they were much better.  I made these without nuts so my 16 month old could eat them, but I think they would have been much better with the nuts to add that little crunch and sweetness.  My DD loves them and I feel good about giving them to her.

The nutmeg was overpowering.  Next time I will make using only cinnamon.  I also found the 400 degrees for 15 minutes way too long.  I kept a close eye on them and after 10 minutes they were looking way too brown.  I usually bake cookies at 375 for 10 minutes.  I will make these again but tweak slightly.  I found them slightly bland.  Will add chocolate chips next time.  The texture of the cookies was great--soft and fat.

My family loves these cookies. I make them with 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil to make them healthier. The cookies are very heavy, almost like a muffin. I now have a recipe to use up ripe bananas that isn't a cake.

Okay- I am so excited about this recipe!!! I was looking for a dairy free treat to make for my son, who is allergic to dairy. After making these, I am thrilled! They are fantastic... yummy, sweet, and a little bit healthy!   I subbed 1/2 shortening & 1/2 applesauce (will try all applesauce next time); 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar; and did one batch with chocolate chips, and one without. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I will add a tablespoon of flax seed next time too :)  Thank you so much for sharing this! I can't wait for my son to have his special snack at church tomorrow!  They were ready after 9-10 minutes at 400.

This is a pretty good recipe. I used 2 bananas (which turned out to be a cup), but next time will use at least one more. I also added a half cup of chocolate chips.

These were great!  I used applesauce instead of butter to bring the calories down.  I also added some chocolate chips to half the batch, and they were a good bonus.  The rest was according to the recipe.  A slightly crisp shell keeps the inside moist.  When I make these again, I will use twice as much walnut, though.  I could barely detect the nuts in them.

I made these twice, following recipe except one time I substituted butter for the shortening.  Both times they turned out okay, but not fantastic.  They were a little dry.  I liked the idea of bananas and oatmeal in cookies (adds some nutrients although it certainly doesn't make them health food!)

this recipe was interesting. I followed the instructions without any alterations. The cookies were like mini-bread in texture. I didn't know whether to dip my cookies in milk or put butter on them like a slice of banana bread.

These cookies are yummy and stay really moist! They're kinda cakey though. Instead of using one cup of sugar I used a half cup and threw in a half cup of brown sugar as well

It is a good change from the everyday banana bread I make with leftover bananas. My hubby (the cookie monster in our family) enjoyed them and found them to be moist and cake-like.  I will make them again, but will make some changes by adding peanut butter and temp to 350 for 12 mins (400 is to high for my oven).

I really liked the flavor of these cookies, I substituted equal parts of pineapple instead of banana, they were awesome!

I and my children enjoyed these cookies. I didn't add nuts, as I didn't have any but I did add milk chocolate chips. I found the cooking temp and time not accurate for my oven. I ended up using convection and lowering the temp to 350. I will make these again

We did not like these.  They did not "spread" on the cookie sheet, were cake-y, and were lacking in flavor - even though the bananas were very ripe and I added 1/2 tsp of banana extract.  I will not be making them again.  Sorry...

My toddler loved these, my 9 year old and I were not as impressed.  I added chocolate chips to the second batch and my 9 year old thought they were great.  He complained the cookies were too "chubby".  They tasted like mini banana muffins to me, nothing like oatmeal cookies.

I somewhat followed the directions except used light brown sugar instead of white sugar, added 1 cup creamy PeanutButter, 1 cup chopped pecans bourbon pralines, 1 cup butterscotch morsels and used 4 ripe bananas...it's a wonderful combination of flavors...

400F - they will burn! 350F is perfectly fine to get golden yummy looking cookies in the 10 - 15 minute window. Unfortunately, even when they look yummy and amazing, the flavor is lacking. I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, added some cardamom (I love cardamom but it isn't for everyone) and they still seemed sort of bland. They aren't bad.... just a little disappointing.

I made 36 cookies instead of 48. I baked the first pan at 400 degrees, and they were done in 10 minutes, but the bottoms were a little burnt (even though I lined the pan with parchment paper), so I lowered the oven to 375 degrees, and the rest were perfectly done in 10 minutes and nicely browned on the bottoms. I have convection ovens, so things tend to get done quicker. The cookies came out great. They didn't spread out very much, so I was able to fit 12 on a pan without them touching. They did have somewhat of a banana bread texture, but they were delicious. I would definitely make these again!

These were soooo good! It's like soft cookie / muffin top. I made mine smaller so I got around 30+ pcs (baked mine at 180c for 10mins using microwave). Changes I made for the recipe: *I use butter instead of shortening. *didnt have any nuts so add choc chip instead. *add 1/2 tsp of banana flavouring.*use 1cuo

Made as directed except, a liitle less sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  Cooked at 350 for 9 minutes in my electric oven.  Also pressed down slightly to flatten cookie.

YummyYummy!
I used Earth Balance (vegan butter) instead of shortening, brown instead of white sugar, and an extra 1/3cup of mashed bananas instead of an egg, because I made them for my big brother, who is vegan. I used 1 cup of walnuts and 1 cup of dried cranberries as well. I used my small cookie scoop, so they looked and tasted like yummy little muffin tops :) These cookies tasted so good, I had to drop-kick my  mother!

This recipe is so easy.  They are good plain but I added a quick frosting on top.  1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tbsp of milk, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  They were delicious and my picky kids LOVED them.

Great recipe and I liked the fact that the cookie didn't spread out too much.  Like eating a piece of banana nut bread.  I added chocolate chips to half of the batter for variety.  Will definitely make these again!

Made a few substitutions but overall very good! Definitely more MUFFIN TOP versus cookie... Biggest substitutions were replacing shortening with butter... and adding 1/2 cup more mashed bananas... (my bananas were overripe but not very sweet) and it still was pretty dry after... (think scones!)

These are actually quite good! It's nice to add a bit of nutrition to a cookie. I did half whole wheat flour and it wasn't really noticeable. Also did half butter/ shortening and half brown/white sugar also. And we did add a little bit of chocolate chips for good measure. Yum!

I took these to work. Once the word got out, every cookie was gone. My boyfriend told me that I'd better not lose this recipe. I used the recipe exactly but i had to reduce the temp and cook time just a touch. I have an old oven. I added raisins to half the dough and chopped dates to the other half. They were amazing!

These came out great - very much like banana bread, except in cookie form.  My husband, daughter & friends loved them.  I didn't use the chopped nuts, but I did add about 3 handfuls of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  This recipe is a great way to use up over-ripe bananas.

I personally didn't care much for this cookie, and it didn't get as much attention from my coworkers as other cookies I made.  It came out somewhat dry and lacked the sweetness I prefer in my cookies.  That being said, it is definitely a cookie that tastes better on the second day, once the banana has really settled into the oatmeal.  I'm a cookie fanatic, but I don't think I'll keep this on my "must-make-again" list.

These cookies are fanatastic.  They stay moist and wonderful after baking.  My husband loves the taste.  I have made with or without nuts.  I tend to like the texture the nuts give the cookies.  This is a great way to use up ripe bananas besides making a bread.

In place of shortening, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. I increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and omitted the nuts. I baked the cookies for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and they came out perfect. 

These cookies were similar to muffin tops--very light and moist. I am wondering what would make them taste more like cookies and less like muffins. Next time I will probably use a tad bit less flour and all butter instead of the butter/applesauce combo to see if this makes them more cookie-like. 

Overall, very delicious. I would make this recipe again.

I substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the nuts and added a teaspoon vanilla.  Instead of using 3/4 cup shortening I used just 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce to make these healthier and they still turned out GREAT.  My boyfriend had one when he got home from work and said it was like a muffin top and I agree.

WOW!  These are excellent cookies.  I made two batches.  The first followed the recipe almost exactly (used old-fashioned instead of quick oats) and had to force myself from finishing the entire batch.  For the second batch I used half white and half brown sugar and replaced the nuts with chocolate chips.  YUM!!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!  Hmmmm, can't wait to try with cinnamon chips . . . .

I love these cookies!  They are more like muffin type cookies and are so soft and chewy.  My kids absolutely loved them.  They also FREEZE really well.  I bake a ton of them when I have ripened bananas and freeze them in a Tupperware, take them out and pop them in the microwave for a few seconds and they are sooo good!   I have used swirled choco chips and they are good also.  I also used 1/2 cup butter (no shortening on hand) and 13 minutes was my sweet spot!

Oh man did everyone love this cookie!  I made these for the first time tonight and they were fantastic - had people over and the cookies are all gone now :) Here are the alterations I made (based on what I had available): 1 cup all-purpose flour + 1/2 whole wheat flour, sifted, increased cinnamon to 1 tsp, used 1/2 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce instead of shortening, (2 bananas seemed to be about 1 cup mashed) and used chocolate chips instead of nuts.  Baked them in the preheated 400*F oven for 13 minutes - they were golden on the outside, soft and moist and DELICIOUS!!!! on the inside!  Wow.  Thank you for this recipe blairbunny!
***made these again - no nuts or choc chips as I didn't have any - absolutely AMAZING!!! I love these cookies!

Mmmmm!  So good!  I made them for my preschool kids and they gobbled them up!  Two things I changed:  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 shortening, and I only baked for 12 minutes.  Can't wait to make these again!

I used half the shortening and added some apple sauce. I used fine cornmeal to go gluten free.  400 degrees was a bit too high for me, they were almost burned 10 minutes in. Next time I'm going to try 350.  Great recipe!

Kids love them, I love them.  A keeper.  I used part whole wheat flour, replaced part of the fat with applesauce and, used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white, and used choc. chips instead of nuts.  They make a pretty good breakfast, too.

The cookies turned out great; just like my Mom's!  I will say that if I had let them cook for 15 minutes they would have been burned.  Nine minutes worked perfectly for me!

These cookies are more cake like, they tasted like muffin tops. I topped them with Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting and that just put them over the top! great way to use up banana's instead of the same ol' banana bread!

We really enjoy this recipe! Such a nice change from banana bread/muffins. I used 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 3/4 all purp. flour. Also used egg replacer product so my egg-allergic son could eat them. And instead of nuts, we added some choc chips. Absolutely fabulous!

This is a wonderful way to use over ripe bananas.  A nice change from banana bread.  Very, very easy to make.  I use half brown and half white sugar (baking spelnda), and whole wheat flour. I find they bake in 10 minutes. They taste wonderful.  No need for any icing!  The whole family loves!!

My husband liked them especially with a little white icing. My one yr old son liked them too.  I added a bit more spices to make them really have some flavor. A little bit of cloves, and some pumpkin pie spice. The taste was very good; you can taste both the banana and the spices.  Can't tell there is oatmeal in them either. I, however, do not like my cookies with a cake texture and this is how these came out for me. They were very soft and moist. I called them little cake droppings after I had frosted them!  Will probably make again.

These have great potential, but they were missing something.  I feel like they needed additional spices...maybe cinnamon and vanilla extract.

I rate this a 5, but hubby who is finicky, gives them a 4. He said he would have liked them more with peanut butter. I did put chopped peanuts in them. I tasted a couple-couldn't resist although I am dieting. They are very good!

Tastes like a muffin top, but that is perfect for me. I used butter and 3 large bananas, didn't use nuts because these are for a toddler.  Baked at 350 for 16 mins. I'm rating these a 4 because I think the sugar could be reduced.  I will try 3/4 cup next time or 1/2 c of brown sugar.

Light and moist with a big banana flavor!  I added chocolate chips because, well, because I just had to.  But they definitely don't overpower the banana.  The kids are ecstatic!

These were fantastic!!! I also would not call them "cookies" but maybe muffin tops is more accurate. I made a few changes that made them taste even better. I used half margarine and half peanut butter instead of shortening. I used whole wheat flour and added about 1/4 of a cup of vanilla soymilk to compensate for the whole wheat. Finally, I used 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar. They were moist, not crumbly, and delicious!!

Very good! I cut way back on the sugar because the bananas are sweet enough. "Cookie" is a little decieving because they are more cake-like. As someone mentioned earlier, they're like muffin tops.

Just tried one right out of the oven.  OH My Gosh they are so good.  Can't wait to let my toddler have one after his nap.  Great wait to get some fruit into a treat.  I might even drizzle the with some icing flavored with orange extract if I don't eat them all first.

I gave these 4 stars only because they are okay the first day. The second day they are amazing!! All the flavors mix togther when they sit for a day. I also found, that an old hand held potato masher works awsome for mixing it all together, that way your arm doesn't fall off from trying to mix it. Super good and GREAT for kids!

Good. Not exactly what I was looking for - we quite caky and moist, and I wanted a more chewy cookie... but this is what my kids wanted. They loved them.

This are a nice combination of healthy (oats, bananas, nuts) and satisfying. I replaced half of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and I used 1/4 C applesauce to replace 1/4 C of the butter. Instead of all white sugar, I used 1/4 C brown sugar and only 1/2 C white sugar. With super ripe bananas and 1/4 C mini chocolate chips, they are plenty sweet for us.  This are a nice lunch box treat. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 1/4 cup butter & 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the shortening; I also used 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 white flour.  These were very good & very filling; I would feel good about letting my kids eat them with their breakfasts.  They were still good the second day, but were way too soft & moist on the third day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these cookies exactly as the recipe said, but the cookies turned out slightly burned and flavorless. I reduced the bake time so they were no longer burning, but there wasn't a single thing I could do to make them more flavorful.

I was so dissapointed. I doubled the recipe thinking they would be moist and yummy. Soft, yes. Moist..uh, no!  Bland as all get out!  I would save all your ingrediants and just chew on some oats. Same flavor and texture.  Sorry.

I was looking for cookie that I could adapt to fit the reduced-sugar diet I began a few months ago, and these fit the bill PERFECTLY.  WOW!  I couldn't even tell that they contained less sugar than most other cookies.  I used a combination of white and whole spelt flour in place of the all purpose (wheat-allergy), unsweetened applesauce in place of the shortening to make them a little more calorie-friendly, and 1/3 cup brown sugar + 3 packets of stevia in place of the 1 cup white sugar.  Even so, they were a bit too sweet--next time, I will probably only use 2 tbs. brown sugar.  The banana-flavor was amazing, and even those in my family who don't like sweets couldn't stop eating them.  This is probably the best recipe I've found here in ages.  Thank you so sooooo much!!

Used applesauce instead of shortening and halved the amount of sugar(used 1/4 white and 1/4 brown) added choc chips, walnuts and dried cranberries.  Cooked for 10 minutes. Kids loved them.

These are really good.  I made them early in the morning to take to the zoo and they were perfect.  Moist, light bannana flavor.  I used brown sugar instead of white, no nuts, added some ginger and applesauce because I only had one bannana.  Still very good!

Was looking for a way to use up some very ripe bananas and decided to try this recipe.  So glad I did!  They are very good.  I used almonds for the "chopped nuts" the recipe calls for, whole wheat flour, and added about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  Yummy!

I had these cookies in for only 10 minute and the bottoms were already burnt! 15 minutes is way too long, or perhaps 400 F is too hot!

Yum! I'm not really a baker but had some ripe bananas and didn't want to waste them. Thought it would be nice to make a healthy snack for the kids. I substituted wheat germ for nuts and it is good! I might even try baking something else some day!

This is a pretty good way to use up those over ripe bananas.  They are more cake like but we don't mind cake like cookies.

I was really nervous about this recipe after a few reviews, however I'm delighted with the outcome. A few comments: my oven has a tendency to overheat (it's really old) but I still baked them at 400 degrees and it was fine, although they were done after 8 minutes. Secondly, the batter was really mushy and I thought it was going to be difficult to work with so I refrigerated it for a few minutes before putting cookie balls on the pan and that made a big difference. I flattened them slightly and they looked really mushy and weird going into the oven, but they came out beautifully. I only had 1 banana but it was really big and I think it was just under a cup, so I tossed in a bit of applesauce (probably about 1/4 of a cup or a little more). I also used margarine instead of shortening. I separated the dough in half and added raisins to one half and semi-sweet chips to the other half. Both turned out great! I also added a dash of vanilla extract just out of habit. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

Very good cookies.  I used white whole wheat flour in place of half of the a/p flour.  And, instead of 3/4 cup shortening I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also used a little more banana and a little less sugar.  And I used chocolate chips instead of nuts.

These cookies were AWESOME !  I made them today for the first time (minus the nuts since I didn't have any) and they were really good. Very soft, moist, almost bread-like. I will make these again and again!

This recipe is a wonderful recipe for anyone who is looking for a cookie that is not too sweet. I made it for Christmas this year, and it ended up being a nice balance between bland and super sweet. I didn't use nuts as my family doesn't like them, but they still turned out great.

These cookies are great! I used 2 medium ripe bananas and all whole wheat flour. I baked them for about 13 minutes and they turned out great. They are a mix between a chewy cookie and cake with a crispy edge.

My slight reduced fat variation:
Substituted 1/2c Imperial & 1/4c RF Peanut Butter for 3/4c Shortening; used 1/2 and 1/2 white and brown sugar, added 1T Vanilla Extract, 1/2t Almond Extract and an unmeasured amount of raisins.

I found baking 15 minutes was too long for my oven - a few burned.  Second batch turned down to 390 and baked for 124 minutes - much better.

These cookies were very good. They were very moist. I made them as directed, but after they cooled, I made a glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and milk to go on top of them. Delicious.  I think next time I might add some coconut to the cookie recipe.

Just got them out of the oven - SOOO GOOOD!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and substituted dark chocolate bits for the nuts.  Also added 1 Tbsp milled flax.  Don't overbake as others mentioned.  Great way to use old bananas - thanks for the recipe!  This will be a definate make again.

I enjoyed this recipe the first time I made it, as is.  However, the second time, I made the following adjustments: replace nuts with chocolate chips, add 1 tsp vanilla, and replace shortening with butter.  Delicious!

I buy a bunch of bananas every week at the grocery store, & since it's just my husband & I, I seem to end up making banana bread or banana cake every weekend to use up the uneaten ripe bananas :). So I was looking for a different way to bake with bananas. I love these cookies! I love how soft & chewy they are, and I don't mind the cake-like texture. I can't wait for my husband to get home so he can try them...I know he'll love them too!

I really liked them! They were very moist even the next day which was great. They were not my husbands favorite because they weren't sweet enough - if you're looking to satisfy a sweet tooth, maybe try something else. But for what they were (banana bread in a cookie) i thought they were good.

Wow, these are wonderful little morsels. I changed the recipe some, just to add some more whole grain fiber. First, I doubled the recipe. Then I substituted 1 cup of whole grain flour for 1 cup of the white flour. Added 1/4 cup of ground flax and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I stired in 1/2 bag of mini carob chips right before baking. I left out the nuts because my family does not care for them in cookies. I agree with another posting, 15 minutes is too long. In my gas oven I baked for 12 minutes. In my electric oven I baked for 10 minutes. Both at 400 degrees. A healthy cookie and Yum!!!

These were not as good as I was expectiong.  They are a bit on the dry side and grainy.  When I make cookies, I keep them in a plastic container right on the counter, so they usually disappear quickly!  However, these were still on the counter several days later.

These were great. My 2 year old daughter loved them! I didn't have cinnamon and don't care for nutmeg but substituted vanilla instead and used butter. For nuts I used slivered almonds and sunflower seeds toasted in the oven before adding to the batter. I added chocolate chips to only half the batch. Baked them on parchment paper. They are filling and  soft with a pleasing taste, awesome hot out of the oven with milk (I was tempted to put them into a bowl and pour milk on them and eat with a spoon).
As for them travelling well, they all held together in a ziplock bag in the diaper bag.

Very moist and very easy to make. Like other reviewers, I was sick of making banana bread, but needed a way to use up ripe bananas. I did add a cup and a half of chocolate chips. I also only baked them for 10 minutes.

Great recipe.  I was tired of making banana bread and found this recipe.  Didn't have any nuts on hand, turned out great anyway.  I did add a little cream cheese icing when still warm from the oven which melted over the cookie.  YUM.  Thanks for a great recipe

Good flavor, like banana bread.  I knew 1/2 cup nuts wouldn't be enough to make this more like a cookie than a muffin top, so I added coconut, raisins and a few more nuts.

The first batch of cookies turned too dark, at a length of 15 min. baking!  Once I adjusted the cooking time to 10 min. however, they turned out very well.  My toddler loved them, and they seem like a healthier cookie option, with the bananas and oatmeal.

Absolutely fantastic!  Yes, they do have a slight "muffin" consistancy, but it added to the greatness of this cookie.  The only change I will make the next time I make these is add a bit more banana for a more banana taste.  Besides that, they were the first to go on the cookie tray with a party of about 50 guests.  Fantastic!

These cookies baked great. I had to make 17 dozen for a cookie exchange and all I got were compliments. I replaced the nuts for chocolate chips. MMM yummy. Only took 10 mins in the oven to bake. Alot of my friends did not feel guilty giving them to thier children because it contains banana and oatmeal.

I used half sugar and half brown sugar and they turned out very well. I also used butter flavored shortening as well and didn't use nuts as some in the group I allergic. But they turned out well.

A lovely tasting cookie, however the baking time needs to be adjusted to your individual oven...400 degrees at 15 minutes in my oven would have turned these to hockey pucks. Be sure to watch for the lite brown edges, aaah perfection! I decorated mine with orange swirly frosting, for Halloween. Ty pam for a great cookie!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  I made a butter substitution instead of shortening and added 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I was out of nuts, so I just left them out.  Instead of measuring the bananas, I just threw in two and it was a perfect taste.  Thanks for the recipe!  It will definitely stick around my house.

These cookies were too "cakey" for my liking. After reading the reviews, I added 1 tsp of vanilla and a couple handfuls of chocolate chips to the mix and my cup of mashed banana was heaping. The taste is pleasant enough, but the consistency was more like a muffin.

I was really excited to try this recipe.  I thought it would be a nice change of pace from ordinary cookies and I had overripe bananas to use.  I wasn't very pleased with these cookies.  My mom really liked them, but for me they were a bit bland.  Not too much of a banana flavor.  They were alright when they first came out of the oven.  I prefer banana bars much better.

I am always trying to find new ways to use my "old" bananas-this is a great way!  I read many of the reviews and almost didn't make these, I am glad that I did.  I followed the recipe and had great results.  Some mentioned that they did not "spread" so I used the back of the teaspoon to push them down a bit.  They taste just like banana bread.  I am making them now and the first batch is almost gone.  (my toddler and I think they are a hit!)

These cookies are awesome!  I added some vanilla and some mini-chocolate chips, which made a huge difference!  I like a 'tall' cookie and this didn't disappoint me or my family!  It was a good combination of banana and oatmeal.

These were yummy!  Only change I made was 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and added butterscotch morsels.  Will be making these again.

Love this recipe! I use butter instead and cut the sugar in half (so that I can feed my kids these for snacks!). I only have to bake 9 mins. The best!!

These were amazing. I just had three with my afternoon coffee, only planned on having one.  Cannot wait for hubs to try and see his reaction. Light, fluffy, perfect balance of flavors. This is my favorite oatmeal banana cookie recipe thus far. Thank you so much for this recipe. Cheers.

I used butter instead of shortening. 175 degree for 15 minutes was perfect timing. 

I found them too sweet and will reduce the sugar to 2/3 if i try this again.

These are sooooo good!  Not gonna lie...I ate 5 before  I put them away.  ;-)   I'll be making these a lot to use up the overripe bananas.  The best part is you can go wild with variations.  Raisins, chocolate, coconut, craisins.... the list is endless!  I found that at 400 degrees, I didn't need to cook them quite 15 minutes, especially after the first batch. Thanks for a DELICIOUS cookie recipe!

these  were wonderful, the only changes I made were purely for taste preferences and what I had on had to use. I substituted brown sugar for half the sugar, omitted nutmeg, and used instant brown sugar maple oatmeal and they turned out great. I took them to work to my clients and they loved them.

I did some of the substituting TARAWVU suggested except i did not add choc chips or nuts. I took them to work and everybody raved about them! Huge hit! i will definitely make them again. I baked them at 400 degrees for about 12-15 min. Perfect! soft and chewy.

A banana cookie? Weird? Yes. Good? Excellent! I would add more spices. It simply wasn’t enough. I used 4 frozen bananas (defrosted and I threw away the extra juices the leaked out) from the freezer and it came out to be over a cup. Since the batter was super wet. I made the decision to bake at 375 and they ended up needing about 13 minutes for 2 tons of mixture. I added chocolate chips to half. Excellent!

Oh my heavens. Who knew that a healthy looking cookie could be so good. I always add 1/4 of flour to any cookie recipe that has a lot of oil or butter in it. It made these rise up so nicely. Someone mentioned 3/4 c. granulated sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I did the same and added a bit of extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I never saw a cookie recipe that didnt have vanilla extract in it. I added about 2 tablespoons. These are to die for. I love that they are not super heavy and that they don't have to have chocolate and sprinkles in them to be good. LOL This will be a baking staple in my home from years to come.  I love my Banana Bread and I believe it's the best, but I needed to make something different today. Thank you for sharing. You made my day.  Blessings everyone.

Kid-approved. The texture was a little more like bread than cookie and they spread more than I would have liked. Maybe refrigerate the dough longer (standard practice in my kitchen)? We are at high elevation, so I had it make some adjustments to the flour. The taste is definitely like that of a banana bread.  I did not use nuts bc of preference, but there was a chocolate bunny that met its end via a coarse chop for the sake of baking. ;) overall, a nice twist on banana bread, but if you want a dense cookie texture, this may not be your recipe.

This recipe turned out at high altitude!  I'm at 7300 ft and I have a hard time getting things to turn out right.  I added chocolate chips which work with banana anything.  These cookies are more like banana bread in cookie form than an oatmeal cookie.  Delicious!

Great cookie! Great solution for overripe bananas. I also put a piece of aluminum foil on the bottom rack, below the cookies. The foil seemed to prevent the bottoms of the cookies from burning. I also used agave nectar instead of sugar, and it turned out great. (I needed to add a little bit more flour + oats to make the cookie batter a little thicker.) But delicious recipe and a great way to deal with blackened bananas!

Turned out better than expected! 
Made a double recipe since I had 4 black banana's, used the convect bake setting on my oven and baked each batch - about 20 per large cookie sheet (airbake) - for 15-minutes.
The cookies came out golden brown and cooked all the way through, did not crumble, and remained moist and delicious throughout the week! 
Shared some with my co-workers who insisted on getting the recipe after tasting them!
We froze half the batch and we'll see how well they hold up in about another week.
As much as I enjoy banana bread, this is definitely a pleasant and satisfying alternative for using overripe bananas!

I was very disappointed in these cookies.  First the temperature of 400 degrees was way too hot and my parchment paper starting smoking after about 5 minutes and of course the bottom of the cookies were burnt.  I had to grate the bottoms of each cookie to get the burnt bottoms off.  They were chewy but very dry.  Even the cookie monsters in my house asked me to do something to make them edible.  This is the first time I really had a bad experience with a recipe.

Great recipe- with the additions. Reduced the servings to 12 just because it's the first time trying. 2/3 flour and 1/3 vanilla whey protein powder, 1/3 white and 1/3 brown sugar, 1 cup mashed bananas, 1 cup oats, 1 egg, remaining ingredients the same. 14 minutes @ 400 on parchment paper- delicious. 
Next time- either chocolate chips or diced apples. 
Give it a go- really good cookies.

Made these almost exactly as written, but gluten free. I also took the temp advise (15 min@350)

My teenage son hugged me and said he loved me. 

They don't spread a lot, which is something that's never mentioned in recipes. I never know how far apart to spread them on the cookie sheet!! 

Saved this one. It's definitely a recipe I'll use again.

Delightful as is, except cook time for me.  Followed the recipe exactly, except cook time, and these cookies were a delightfully spiced mixture that reminded me of banana nut bread crossed with banana nut muffins and then baked in a moist, delicious cookie.  At 400 degrees, they cooked in 8 to 10 minutes and would have been burned by the stated 15minutes in the recipe. But absolutely delicious as is, and allowing for substitutions or additions if your tastes or needs differ. But super as is!

Just made these tonight. I didn't have any nutmeg so I substituted pumpkin pie spice for that and the cinnamon. I also don't like nuts in my food so I used chocolate chips instead. It took 20 minutes in my oven. The family loves them! This will definitely be a keeper! Super soft and flavorful ????

Dry, dry, dry. First of all, I read the reviews and decided to bake at 375, not 400, for 15 minutes. Cookies were hardened and had brown bottoms by 10. So the next batch, I baked at 375 for 10 minutes. This was better but the cookies still didn't spread and stayed in dry little balls. Flavor was okay, reduced the sugar otherwise waayy to sweet. Maybe would be better if the recipes had more liquid. Also, these made wayy more than 24 cookies.

This had a good rating, I did not like it AT ALL. I like my cookies moist and dense. These were cakey and dry. Just not my thing! Would have much rather made moist, dense banana bread.

a few changes i made were: i used butter instead of shortening, I also browned my butter to give a more in depth flavor. used 1/2 brown sugar and half regular sugar. kicked up the cinnamon and nutmeg and also added vanilla. subbed nuts for mini chocolate chips. 
BAKED @ 350 FOR 10 MIN. 
they're delicious!

LOVE this recipe!!! Great base for add-ins too! I doubled it and made half as is with pecans and the other half with mini chocolate chips, YUMM!!!! Now, I found myself with only half the amount of shortening I needed to double the recipe and I was NOT going out again for the day just for one item. So I just used butter in place of the rest of the shortening I needed. Because butter tends to make bake goods spread, I used baking powder in place of baking soda and let me tell you, these little gems will be a staple in my home! My husband is not a sweets person and he LOVED these. Not too sweet. And for us sweet thooths out there, the mini chocolate chips do just the trick !

I used margarine instead of shortening, I substituted the cinnamon and nutmeg for for 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, (for my taste it would need 2 tsps). I lowered the heat to 350 and baked for 13 minutes.Other than that it would get 5 stars.

Do not grease your cookie sheet for this recipe. It  will lightly burn the bottoms. I'm going to recommend parchment paper. Also these cookies do not spread the puff.

So I had about 1 cup of oatmeal left and was looking to use up some other ingredients in my freezer.   I had frozen bananas, a handful or so of raisins, some semi-sweet chips and some pecans.  I used 1 stick plus 6 tbls of butter and 1 cup white sugar.  When I sifted the ingredients I also added about 1/4 tblsp ancho chile powder, about 1/2 tblsp chipotle chile powder and about 1/8 tsp cayenne.  My hubby loves that sweet and spicy combo and this worked well.  Nice fluffy cookies.  They turned out well and I would make these again.

I had some bananas that needed using and tried these cookies.  I liked them and will make them again.  I did not use the nuts (seems like so many people have allergies these days) because I will be taking them to a bake sale at church.  After making them and sampling them I realized there is no vanilla in the recipe and I would definitely add that next time.  I also added chocolate chips to them.  I also found that baking them at 350 degrees worked best.

I used a stick of butter and 1/4 cup of coconut oil instead of shortening. 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. I also used 3/4 c of dried cranberries instead of nuts. I made 30 cookies but could have done 36 if I paid more attention to portioning. There was some spread when they baked, but if you leave them as a sizable dollop, they will come out thick in the center. Definitely like muffin tops instead of cookies, but everybody at playdates (moms and kids) love them!

Saw this recipe last week and have made them twice already. Simply amazing cookies, I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose for healthier cookies,  also added 1/2 tea spoon of lemon rind in the second batch. Result: all polished off within an hour

I've been trying different healthy cookies recipes and this one is the BEST! I read the reviews that said it lacked flavor so put extra cinnamon, vanilla and choc ships. Also added some oat bran for more healthy-ness. It rocks!!! Also, I baked at 350 for 15 min. strict.

Excellent!  Made exactly as written. Used convection oven setting on 400. Cooked 8 minutes. Next time go light on cinnamon and try adding some chocolate chips or dried fruits.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe and made it a keeper! I couldn't bring myself to use shortening so I used 3/4 C plus 2 TBS of room temperature butter and refrigerated the dough for a few minutes before scooping/baking it. I also added 1 1/4 C of frozen blueberries. These cookies were delicious!

Mediocre. I used margarine instead of shortening and took other reviewers' advice baking at 350 for 12 minutes.  I also used half brown sugar and reduced the sugar by just under a third. I omitted the nuts and added about half a cup of chocolate chips and three quarters of a cup of raisins. They are tasty enough for a healthy cookie, but not healthy enough to justify not tasting...well... better. My kids like them, just not as much as "real cookies".

These are Divine! I made these for my denture wearing, Celiac father, so that means i omitted the nuts and replaced the flour with Gluten-Free Bisquick; came out great. We all love Bananas and Oatmeal in my house so these were gone in no time. I did add a dash ground ginger and allspice for a more seasonal treat, Love, love.

I omitted cinnamon and nutmeg and added a half cup cocoa powder to the dry ingredients.  I baked half the batter without oats or nuts in a pie pan about half full for 20 minutes.  Yummy. Added oats and nuts and baked other half in pie pan.  Also yummy.

So apparently allrecipes doesn't  fact check their recipes.  I've never had a bad experience til now.  All the negative reviews that mention cooking at 350 are correct.  I suppose I should have known that 400 was too high, but I don't really think critically when I follow these recipes, I just follow directions.  It's a nice break that way.  Thankfully I had some batter left and they turned out good.  I would like to try the drizzle, but it doesn't say if they used powdered sugar or white chocolate...I'm gonna use the chocolate.

I liked the spices in the cookie but even so they are rather bland. I added a small handful of chopped dried cranberries, that helped. Also, I just didn't know about baking at 400 so I set my oven at 350 and baked for about 12 min.

Amazing!! I changed a few things- I used 2/3 cup of sugar, and half butter half coconut oil instead of shortening. I didn't add any nuts, and instead added about half a cup of dark chocolate chips and 1/4 cup shaved coconut. I also took some reviewers advice and cooked mine at 375 for about 15 minutes. They turned out so good! They were even a bit crispy on the outside- that probably won't last overnight, but was amazing right out of the oven.

Great way to use up bananas! I doubled the recipe, used part whole wheat flour, and added chocolate chips so I could send them to school. 
I used parchment - and sprayed it first- also be careful- 12 minutes was plenty of time at 400!

I found this recipe as I had a lot of oatmeal and a lot of bananas to use up. I have made it twice and ALL in my family like it, even the picky ones. I didnt have nutmeg so left out, I used a vegetarian shortening, and I did not use nuts. I also doubled it and have made twice. The hardest part is making even cookies so they cook the same.  This is a keeper for sure - thank you!

Great breakfast cookie! For those who say their cookies burned, maybe they were too small. I made a generous-sized cookie. 15 minutes at 400 degrees was fine.

wonderful recipe!! I made this one and another banana cookie recipe side by side a few weeks ago and the other one was a bit dry. They did not all get finished. But this one went pretty fast even though I did a double batch! It was moist and soft and had really good flavor. I think this time I will not only do chopped nuts but add chocolate chips to some of the dough as well. Definitely a keeper!

These are absolutely delicious! Since I have replaced a lot of oils in my diet with organic coconut oil that is what I used. Oh my! Having a hard time not eating them because they are to go into a box of love for family members in Texas. And... the recipe made 38 cookies instead of 24. Thank you for sharing this. Am pinning and also posting on my blog

If you like banana bread you'll love these cookies.  I added vanilla next time I might try adding more cinnamon or nutmeg.   It was a little bland but all in all I gave it four stars because I love banana bread and it had a good banana flavor.

These are still coming out of the oven and I need to rate the first batch. I LOVE them. I made a few changes to the recipe:
1.) Subbed out half the white sugar for brown sugar (so a half cup of each)
2.) Added a teaspoon of vanilla
3.) Didn't actually measure how much banana went in; I just mashed up the three ripe ones I had
4.) Left out the nuts and used chocolate chips instead.

These are AMAZING. They're so soft and gooey, not cakey at all (which some of the negative reviews were saying). I highly recommend them!!

These were delicious! I used truvia sugar to cut the calories a little and no eggs but extra super ripe previously frozen bananas. I added extra baking soda as well. Plus obviously I added some cocoa powder. I love adding that to stuff to get a little chocolate fix! I did cut the temp to 375 and watched closely to prevent burning on bottom. They were super moist and fluffy! Will make again!

Had neither oatmeal nor nuts in the house so substituted equal amounts of Bran Flakes (without raisins), for both. Lowered temp to 375. Hubby's pronouncement, "Ohhhh...these are GOOD! Healthy, too!"
Will definitely make them again!

I just made these and they're really good. I love the cake-like consistency of the cookie and the fact that they are not too sweet. The only reason I did not rate this recipe 5 stars is because, for my personal taste, they seem to be a little too salty. Next time I make them I will try 1/2tsp. salt instead.
Due to other reviews about their cookies burning on 400 degrees I cooked mine on 375 degrees for 12 minutes.
Because I was out of shortening I used 3/4C real butter.

I liked them!  I agree with one review, do not bake at 400, I would back down to 375 and keep an eye on them the last 5 minutes they are in.  I also would add some chocolate chips to the recipe to add some variation or some coconut...other than that, Loved!

I followed the recepie with one substitution, using butter.  These came out perfect at 400° for 15 minutes in my oven, but I still kept watching them to be safe.  Both kids loved them, definitely a keeper, since we always have bananas at home.

These were pretty good as written.  I thought they were not sweet enough for my liking, so I made a thin, cream cheese icing and drizzled on them.  Next time, I think that I will increase the sugar and see how I like them without icing.

BAM!! All the baking I have done, comes from "AllRecipes" site. Of course there are thousands of recipes on this site, and I intend on continuing my baking experiences here. I must say, this recipe is by far the BEST, and most delicious, although all the recipes I have tried out are great, but this one; by far the greatest. The cookie is crunchy, soft, airy and perfect. Instead of Nutmeg (I didn't have any in my cupboard) I used "Ginger", it is a good substitute when you are out of Nutmeg. The ginger was great. Whoever the author is of this recipe; Both Thumbs UP!!! My family loves it as well.  Thank Goodness I made a triple batch LOL.  God Bless everyone who places their recipes here. I love the site. Thank you.

Just made these, they are so very good. Baked at 400 for 12 minutes. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup but that is just a personal preference. Awesome will be saving this recipe to use for years to come.

Tried it for the first time today and it was awesome.  I didn't have nutmeg so I added All Spice. I also substituted the sugar with Splenda to cut the calories. I will keep trying it and tweaking it to make it better.

Went looking for a new recipe to use up some old bananas and this is a keeper! Great texture and density. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so this is what I did. No nutmeg, but added a little vanilla. 1c white flour and about 3/4 c wheat flour. Only had about a cup and a third of oats, so I figured the wheat flour would make up for it. I also added about a cup and a half of mini chocolate chips. Will definitely make it again!

I don't usually write reviews, but I'm pretty proud of how these turned out. I was searching for a recipe that I could modify and make healthier and this was perfect, simply by substituting whole wheat flour and reducing the sugar to just 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar. I kept everything else the same and they turned out great! I should note though that I baked mine at 375 for 11-12 min. If you want a super yummy glaze to top these off, try this: 1 8oz reduced fat cream cheese, 2 heaping cups of powdered sugar, a generous dash of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp milk. Beat until smooth and pour into a quart size baggie. Snip off a corner of the baggie and drizzle over cookies... Perfect!

My family loved these, I did cook them for less time however. I waited until the outside of the cookie was just slightly brown. They all turned out great. I will make them again and add some chocolate chips and next time!! Great use for bananas!

These were very easy to make and very tasty!  Added mini chocolate chips to half the batch to sweeten them. Definitely will make again, but do half brown sugar and half white sugar additional vanilla.

A wonderful combination of bananas and oats. I always bake 2 test cookies. The 400 degrees made for burnt bottoms on the cookies. So, I baked the cookies on parchment paper at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  I used a cookie scoop to keep the cookies a uniform size and I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. My husband loved these cookies. I can see a lot of possibilities for these cookies such as dried cranberries or raisins.

This is a great recipe...made it the first time today with bananas my husband swore wouldn't be good in anything, but he changed his mind once these cookies were cool enough to eat! Thank you for sharing; I will be making these again. For those of you who had problems with the bottom of the cookie getting too brown, try baking them on parchment paper. My cookies were perfect!

Delicious -- a big hit with the grandkids!!   I made the recipe exactly as printed other than doubling it because I had four really ripe bananas and only baking them for 9 minutes at 400 degrees.    The double batch yielded 75 cookies using my 1 tablespoon cookie scoop.

I made these as birthday treats and they got rave reviews from my friends after a run!  In fact, I had planned to take them to work the next day, but there weren't enough left!  Also, I did add some chocolate chips and used 1/2 C peanut butter and 1/4 C butter to replace the shortening!  I didn't think the PB came through very much and would try making it with 3/4 C PB in the future if I wanted that flavor noticed.

this recipe is very similar to my mom's. I couldnt get a hold of her this evening and I needed to get a huge bag of over ripe bananas out of my freezer so I used this recipe. I doubled the recipe (I still have bananas left) but the only 2 things I did differently was left out the nuts (I like the nuts but my 5 year old doesn't in cookies for some reason) and I substituted 1 cup of shortening with 1/2 cup of applesauce (what my mom always did) and they turned out wonderful, almost as good as my mom used to make them!!! thanks all recipes!!!

these are great.  Love the oatmeal in it.  I used old-fashioned oats and it worked fine.  They are not super sweet...tempted to add chocolate chips or a drizzled glaze or chocolate.  But, first I'll see how the kids like them plain.

made these with my 4 and 2 year old sons added raisins and almonds. Delicious. So soft and yummy. Just like your own individual banana bread. Will never make regular banana bread again this is my new go to recipe! oh and I only used 2/3a cup of sugar.

OMG! Best banana cookie recipe EVER!!!!! I split the recipe into two bowls and added milk chocolate chips to one batch and peanut butter chips & milk chocolate chips to the other...A hit with the whole family (even my 7 month old). I also cut back on the butter and sugar and added a touch more cinnamon. I'll definitely be using this again and recommend this to my friends.

Tired of making banana bread or muffins with my leftover bananas and found this recipe.  Wow, super yummy and easy to make.  A few changes I made were, I used butter added less salt and more cinnamon.  My son is allergic to eggs so I used an egg replacer and they turned out wonderfully.  I emailed the recipe to all my friends and would make them again.

Moist and chewy!  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of the shortening and added apple sauce to make up the difference for the banana.  Quick and yummy!  I'll definitely be making these again.

LOVE these cookies, and occasionally let my children have one for breakfast.  I substitute 1/4 c applesauce for the egg (allergy).  For one batch I add chocolate chips, for another I add Craisins!

I made these with indian ricegrass flour, palm shortening, sea salt, and GF old rolled fashion oats. Left out the chopped nuts. They are simply melt-in-your-mouth amazing. I think next time I'll put in some little dark chocolate chips. Mmm! Note: these baked really fast. Only 6-8 minutes, even though they're a generous size.

This recipe must be pretty fool-proof...I
forgot the salt (realized it after the first batch cooked!), was 1/2 C short of oatmeal, and had my 4 year old helping me and they still turned out good.  They are more cake-like than I expected.  I added a touch of vanilla and took the advice to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I added choco chips to 1/2 the batter and raisins to the other half.

Yummy!  Little banana bread bites!  Did 1/2 and 1/2 brown and white sugar and used butter instead of shortening to "keep it real."  Baked for exactly 10 minutes.  Very moist and soft.  I'll definitely make them again!

These were apparently a hit at school with my son's kindergarten class.  The teachers requested less sugary snacks and there is a chocolate allergy (sad!), so these were great.  I doubled the recipe and used many of the recommendations in the reviews including 1/2 ww flour, more cinnamon, butter instead of shortening, etc.  I accidentally omitted an egg in the doubling process, but didn't really miss it.  I used chopped dried cherries and they tasted great!

Just like muffin tops-not really a "cookie".  I did add a bit more banana -very glad I did-otherwise would not have enough banana flavor.  These are not TOO SWEET-which is kind of nice.  Overall--A nice treat.

I made these is 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour. 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup craisins.  Delicious!  Very soft, tastes like little banana bread bites. I will probably reduced the sugar a little next time, I think they are slightly oversweet with 1 cup sugar.

This was a good base recipe.  I wanted healthier so I changed the egg to two egg whites, I used 3/4 cup apple sauce instead of shortening, I used 3/4 cup ww flour, and 3/4 cup wheat bran.  I managed to take out almost 70 calories per cookie .... lol, then I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips ;)

I needed a dairy free treat for my son.. this was great. Delicious way to use up an extra banana. I omitted the nuts and added white chocolate chips. I didn't have quick oats, just old fashioned. I measured them out and tossed them into the vita-mix until they were near flour. I thought it added great texture to the cookie.

Just okay, kind of like little bite size peices of banana bread.  Cooking temp is too high, I went with 350 instead so the outside doesn't get too hard.  Also used 1/2c butter instead of shortening.  Overall easy to make and decent.  Good if you have some extra ripe bananas lying around.

I would call these "Banana Bites" instead of "Banana Oatmeal Cookies".  Mine cooked fine in 12-13 minutes without burning.  I subbed flax for the nuts and used 1/2 cup butter + 1/4 applesauce in place of the shortening.

Tasty and a nice alternative to muffins and bread.  You can cut down on the sugar because the banana makes it plenty sweet.  I used 1/2 brown sugar.  To make them more decadent, try adding 1/3 coconut and 1/3 chocolate chips (put in less oatmeal and less nuts).

They weren't bad, but had I baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees they would have been black.  I baked at 375 for 10 minutes and that seemed to work.  (Maybe I bake small cookies compared to others!  HA!)  The taste was ok, but I haven't cooked with Crisco for so many years that I kept thinking of the shortening as I took a bite.  I gave 4 stars because the taste was good, but couldn't get past the lard.

These are great cookies. I added dried cranberries to them. I found that I had to lower the cooking time, 11 to 12 minutes was perfect.  I also have to say that I live at a high altitude and sometimes I do have to make adjustments when baking.  My kids love these and will make them again sometime!

SO GOOD!  I used a half a cup of butter in place of the shortening due to me finding out there wasn't enough to use.  I also used chocolate chips instead of the nuts, and it was delightful! Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I was surprised at just how much I liked these. I used butter instead of the shortening which is not always easy to find in the UK. I also left out the nuts due to personal preference. A really nice cakelike cookie which still tasted fresh 2 days on. Thanks for a great recipe blairbunny.

I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but I was looking for a different kind of cookie that I'd never tried before, and decided on these since it sounded interesting and I had a couple of bananas that needed using.  Since some people commented on the cookies being bland, I made a couple of changes and added a few things to prevent that, and WOW!  The resulting cookies were DELICIOUS!  I used butter instead of shortening and used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white.  I added an extra shake or two of cinnamon and an extra tiny pinch of nutmeg (as in very tiny, being as nutmeg can be overpowering).  I added in 2 teaspoons of vanilla and a tablespoon of honey.  I used regular oats since that was all I had and omitted the nuts since I don't like them in my cookie.  Absolutely delicious!!  My cookies were done a heck of a lot faster than 15 minutes; more at like 9 minutes.  4 stars for the recipe as written, 5 stars for my revised version!!

A fantastic and easy recipe.  I modified it slightly by using half whole wheat flour and half all purpose white flour.  I also added the juice from half a lemon as well as the zest from half a lemon.  This gave the cookie almost a a mini banana bread taste.  My husband enjoys chunks of banana in my baking, so I sliced an additional banana and quartered the rounds before adding them in last with about half a bag of mini chocolate chips, another crowd pleaser.  Loved the recipe, and everyone I've shared these cookies with wants the recipe!

Everyone loved them!  I used half applesauce and half canola oil.  I used brown sugar instead.  Made half the batch with nuts and half without, great both ways.  I think the are a little salty. I cute salt in half the second time, and still thought they were salty.  I do love them though.

More like a muffin in texture, but very nice and moist; a great way to use up bananas. I think next time I may add raisins or chocolate chips to the batter to give it a little umpf.

Fantastic! I make a mean banana bread, but this was a fun departure. I call them "muffin tops" because that's exactly what they taste like! I always omit the nuts and drizzled vanilla glaze on top, but will do a cream-cheese frosting next time. Otherwise I made these exactly as is. Fantastic!

Yummy...but I did make some changes.  I used whole wheat flour, 1/4 c butter & 1/2 c applesauce instead of shortening, 1/4 c each white and brown splenda and a full tsp. of cinnamon.  They baked in 10 min. at 400.  Note, they come out exactly as they went in, no change in size, so I flattened my last batch a bit and cooked for 8 min.  Next time I make these I will use more sugar because they were not sweet.  They are soft and taste like muffins!  Great change from banana bread.  Thanks for a good recipe.

These sounded soooo good, but I was a bit disappointed.  I loved the flavor, but they turned out dry in my opinion.  I added a cream cheese frosting which really helped.  I will make these again and add more banana and maybe some applesauce.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  I used GF flour mix rather than all-purpose and I used choc. chips rather than nuts.  As others have said, they really are bite size banana bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies had a great taste but were a little cakey for me.  I put some icing on the top and that made them even better.  Hubby had no complaints.

I made these today and I'm on the fence about them.  I made them exactly as written except I used butter instead of shortening and used no nuts.  They have a nice flavor and are not real sweet.  I do like the cinnamon flavor to the cookie.  Wish I would have added a tad more nutmeg, but I grind it fresh and I never know how strong the flavor will come through.  I'm taking these to a volleyball tournament in the morning and I think they will be tasty with a cup of coffee.  One last thing 15 minutes in my 400 oven was WAY to long.  The first batch almost burnt.  My oven is new and the temp is spot on.  I changed to 12 minutes and they were perfect.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! As soon as I finished making the dough, I knew it would be amazing cookies. The cinnamon scent really enhanced the taste and the oatmeal gave them a nice slightly uneven surface. Next time I'm making double the portion.

These were very easy to make. I had to play with the cooking time but I think that might be because my oven is off. Also, I added chocolate chips in the batter and it was fabulous!

These were moist and delicious.  An excellent cookie.  Like some others, I only had to bake these for 10 minutes before they started getting just-right brown, and they were done inside as well.

This recipe is definitely going to be a keeper in my home.  I personally drive my children 300kms a day to get too and from school and I always bring them a snack for the rides.  These cookies were a hit and tasted even better the next day.(stored in a closed container)  Knowing that my kids were eating something much more nutritious instead of sugar filled store bought treats made me feel good about making these.  I was very happy to see my children gobbling them up.  I will be making these on a regular basis!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Made exactly as the recipe instructed except I omitted the nuts since I'm not crazy about nuts in cookies. They came out pretty good but I think they'd be better with maybe a 1/2 cup more sugar since they weren't very sweet. (And my bananas were SUPER ripe so that wasn't the problem.)  Also, my first batch was nearly burned at 15 minutes. Second batch did much better at 10-12 minutes.

I had some very ripe bananas I needed to use up and this was a perfect way to do it!  I added some chocolate chips and drizzled some confectioners icing on top.  I thought they were even better the day after I made them.  Yum!

My son wanted banana cookies, and I had never heard of them.  So, we tried making these.  They were delicous!  The taste is just like banana bread only with the nuttiness of oatmeal... wonderful!  We topped them with the icing from the "Banana Bread Cookies" recipe.  The texture was perfect, however once placed in a gallon size ziploc bag, they became much softer (but stil good).

These were a hit for us - I love banana and these are a great way to use up my ripe bananas.  I used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c shortening, changed the cinnamon to 1 tsp (just because it's easier) and used two ripe bananas.  I don't always like nuts in my cookies, but these cookies definitely do better with them.  These were fluffy and tasty and the oats gave them just the right texture.  I will be using this recipe again.

Very tasty cookie. I baked them in my Sharp convection microwave at 400 for 15 minutes and it was too long, probably better at 10 to 12 minutes.

We enjoyed these wonderfully soft cookies. I live at a high altitude and often experience flattened cookies.  Not so with these. They were nice and plump. I agree with other reviewers that they only need to be cooked about 10 minutes.

This recipe is amazing! :)  Is it just me, or do these taste just like muffin tops?  Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I omitted the nuts and reduced the heat to 375 degrees and left them in the oven for about 10 minutes (they came out a little too brown when I left them in for 12 minutes at 400 degrees).   I didn't have any ground nutmeg, so I used cloves instead.  I also added a little more cinnamon. This recipe is awesome.  Highly recommended!

The flavour of this cookie is nice, but I think it's too cakey. I have some leftover dough in the freezer, so the next time I make a batch I will shape and flatten out the cookies on the sheet a bit before baking them. I just prefer a flatter, crispier cookie.

This is a good cookie.  I replaced the flour with Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose baking mix and 3/4 tsp Xantham gum.  I also replaced the sugar with 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 Agave Nectar.  I could have used less sweetener.  I replaced the shortening with 1/2 cup gluten free/dairy free margarine and 1/4 cup Coconut Oil.  I only added 1/2 teaspoon salt and for fun, I added half a bag of Enjoy Life Dairy/Soy/Gluten Free semi sweet chocolate chips.  I am going to increase the oats (I used GF oats by Bob's Red Mill) and decrease the flour as they are a little spongier than I like an oatmeal cookie to be, but they are yummy.  I have bad food allergies so having this kind of treat is few and far between!  Thanks!

Loved these cookies.  The only thing was my family thought they were better the next day.  I changed some things such as: 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c wht sugar, 3/4c shortening & 1/4c butter(i was short on shortening).  I also added 1/2c milk choc chips and 1/2c semi swt chips, handful of coconut plus walnuts.  They were fantastic!!  Definately a keeper!

Super moist, and such an easy to prepare.  I simply threw the brown bananas into the mixer and mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  There was no need to mash them before hand.  I opted not to add nuts, but maybe next time with the addition of chocolate chips would be good too.

SUch a FANTASTIC soft, satisfying cookie.  Bursting with banana flavor and DELICIOUS with chocolate chips in it!  I modified it with 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 splenda and they were just still so fantastic.  So delicious they could have been lightened up further and still tasted sinful.  I am going to figure out how to cut back on the shortening next time- maybe applesauce or light butter?

These cookies are easy and delicious.  When I make them they don't last very long in my house.  I only bake them for 10 minutes and they come out perfect.  Normally I substitute raisins for the chopped nuts.

These cookies are absolutely divine!  The cookies taste wonderful and my condo smells heavenly!  I cut the baking time to 10 minutes and for smaller cookies 8 minutes.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Excellent-My modifications were I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar as well as 1 tsp vanilla - used 2 ripe bananas-not sure what they measured at-3/4 cup butter shortening-400 degrees 10 minutes exact-quite a pleasant taste-will surely make again

Yum!! I didn't have any chopped nuts so made the cookies without and they turned out beautifully, although I'm sure the nuts or chocolate chips would be a great addition! Really easy recipe, too (and this is saying something as I'm a newbie in the kitchen!)

Just finished making(and eating!!)these cookies. They are GOOD! If you like banana loaf or muffins you are gonna like these. I did change it a little though. Instead of a full cup of white sugar I added a 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup of brown. I did add probably closer to 2 cups of bananas(mine had been in the freezer). And some vanilla and chocolate chips. Next time if i use the chocolate chips i will cut down on the sugar. I baked them at 400 degrees for just 10 mins and they came out nice and golden brown.

A great hearty cookie! My husband really enjoyed. I used 1/2 c margerine and 1/4 c peanut butter instead of shortening, used half brown sugar instead of all white and added raisins! Will be making again and adding nuts!!

I followed the recipe exact and still had to add another cup of oats. I also added half a bag of white chocolate chips.   I didn't bother sticking the dough in the fridge. It's going to be a hot one today and didn't want to wait to bake them. I wish I had.  The flavor of these cookies, especially with the addition of the white chips, is great. I think I might add another half cup of flour next time I make it and stick it in the fridge for a couple hours.  EDITED TO ADD: Once this has a chance to set, the moisture was soaked up by the oatmeal. I say add the extra cup of oatmeal and let it sit for about ten minutes. I think I might actually grind half the oatmeal in the blender to make a smoother cookie for next time. Like I said, this cookie has a great flavor. Especially with white chocolate chips!

Great moist flavorful cookies. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 c white. I didn't have eggs so I added 3/4 t. baking powder and they turned out great. Instead of nuts I added 1/2 c. wheat germ to give them a healthful boost.

I made a few of my own changes. I used 1/2 margarine and 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce in place of the shortening. In place of white sugar, I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (1/2 Splenda, 1/2 brown sugar). I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Because I ran out of cinnamon, I used allspice. I used no walnuts. Baking time was 13 minutes at 350 in my electric oven. I will make this variation again. The cookies were very moist and flavourful.

Delicious!  We used two packets of regular instant oatmeal, two packets of maple and brown sugar oatmeal, and one packet of banana oatmeal.  Baked for about 10 minutes instead of 15.

I think the cookie dough is a kind of soft. I added 1/4 c more flour than called for the and cookies still spread and flattened a little more than I would have liked. I left the nuts out and put chocolate chips in instead. Decent, plain cookies.

These turned out great! I am not a huge fan of "cake-like" cookies, but I think these are a great texture. Since I am a moderate health freak, I subsituted some of the white flour for wheat flour, flaxseed meal, and wheat bran, and it didn't weight them down at all! They have a certain banana bread quality, only BETTER! As others suggested, cook for slightly less than 15 minutes, depends on your oven. Huge hit! Update: Even better with chocolate chips!

So very yummy!  These cookies are cake-like, but we don't mind that.  We used butter instead of shortening and chocolate chips instead of nuts.  What a fabulous banana flavor.  I had to force myself to stop eating them!

Excellent cookies.  Yes, they were a dense cake like consistancy, but they were very good.  I used two bananas for making the cookies, but I think they may have needed one more (very subtle banana flavor).  Thanks for the recipe.

As a rule, my kids will not eat oatmeal cookies.  Two out of three of my kids loved these.  I will definitely make them again.

These cookies are terrific.  I added a splash of vanilla and omitted the nuts.  My 2yr old loves them.  Soft and chewey!  They were a little hard to scrape off the baking sheet.

The cookies were a little too moist for my personal preference.  I also thought the banana flavor was a little overwhelming.  Perhaps, my bananas were a little too ripe.  I may or may not try this recipe again.

These are good cookies, maybe a little dry.  I used mini chocolate chips instead of nuts because I didn't have any.  I wasn't sure how to rate this, because I do like them but I like anything with banana.  So I asked the fam what rating they would give the cookies and everyone said "three".

With a few minor changes this recipe yielded a moist, scrumptious and nutritious cookie.  I used organic evaporated cane juice instead of white sugar.  I used 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  I also used a HEAPING cup of bananas.  For a slightly sweeter version drizzle a thin glaze (powdered sugar, milk and almond extract) on top.  Using food coloring in your glaze for seasonal/holiday cookies.  I'm thrilled to add this recipe to my cookie collection.  THANKS!

I love this recipe!  A favorite by all!  The only thing I didn't like was the NutMeg.  Too strong for my taste.  I would cut it down to 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  Tastes just like eating Banana Bread!  =)

I didn't care for this cookie.  I gave it two stars however, because the people my husband works with said they were ok.  I added some choc. chips.

This would be good with rasins and/or coconut added to it.
