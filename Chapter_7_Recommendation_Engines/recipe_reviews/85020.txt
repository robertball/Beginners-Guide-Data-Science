I couldn't find that particular seasoning, so I went with a chipotle southwest. The first time I made it it was alright, not fantastic. The second time I added a 1/4 of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It made such a difference! It was AMAZING! I mean all caps amazing! Thank you for this recipe!

The chipotle seasoning was really good on the pork chops, but I had some problems with the cream sauce.

First of all there were the problems making the sauce.  I had no idea it would take so long.  I thought it boiled and then it was done, but that's not the case.  You have to keep stirring and stirring until it thickens.

Then after that I thought the sauce didn't have much flavor.  It was great and creamy, but I thought it would have fared better with a pasta or something else.

Everyone in my house liked the chops, but only 1 person had the sauce.

This meal was excellent. The McComick's seasoning wasn't availible at my grocery store so i substituted Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle seasoning. While I enjoyed my version I will look forward to trying it as the written here.
