This is a great basic recipe. I used pork chops rather than a loin and I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and half a chopped oninon. I sauted the onion with a little olive oil to soften them up before mixing all the ingredients together. Then I seared both sides of the chops deglazed the pan with some white wine (and also added 1/4 c. of water) and then put the rest of the ingredients on top of the chops in a covered pan and let simmer until cooked through which which was only 15-20 minutes. This was a very yummy dinner!

Excellent recipe. Quick and easy. I used 3/4c apple juice instead of an apple added 1/2 sliced onion cubed the pork in at least inch cubes & browned very dark (maybe the people who said it was dry made the meat cubes too small?) and after an hour it came out wonderful with tender pork. I'll double the recipe next time to be sure there's leftovers.

I didnt change anything. Sometimes simple is better. Try it the way it is written then if you dont think its enough change it. Great Grandma knew how to make it simple and delicious and thats good enough for me!

The family loved this. The pork was very tender and the apple gave it a bit of sweetness. Good with a dollop of sour cream too. Thank you!

This is a keeper...made mock mashed potatoes (cauliflower) and mixed it all together on the dinner plate. Great for low carb.

My brother wasn't too impressed. I myself liked the flavor the apples gave to the pork. The pork was a little dry other than that good.

Good recipe. I put white pepper on the chops before browning and omitted the oil. I also added a touch of brown sugar to cut down on the tartness of the sauerkraut. I've also made in my slow cooker.

Fixed this for dinner tonight and it was very good. It is something I would fix again. I have made something siniliaronly used boneless pork country style ribs and sauerkraut and baked them. But I really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe.

This is really an excellent basic recipe! I used 1.5 pounds of pork tenderloin slices (about 3/4 inch thick) and sauted them on both sides to brown first (did not use oil at all just non-stick spray). Then I added a 32 oz jar of sauerkraut (drained) over the top and added the peeled chopped apple and about 1/2 cup of natural unsweetened applesauce. I also added 2 Tbsp of brown sugar then put the lid on a cooked on low for about 35 min and took the lid off and cooked it for 5 minutes more. Delicious - the pork was so flavorful and tender not at all rubbery!!! I definitely recommend draining the liquid from the sauerkraut before adding otherwise there will be way too much liquid leftover in the pan (like there was the first time I made it:) Will definitely make again and again!

I started eating the sauerkraut right out of the jar! I followed the recipe (with the remaining sauerkraut) with a few revisions. Two apples instead of one was more to my taste plus a heap of fresh ground black pepper. The meat was so tender. This is a great recipe for someone ike me who lives alone and prefers less ingredients so cut costs.

This is quite tasty... the apples take the "sting" out of the kraut and the overall flavor is good.

I'd forgotten how good this dish is! To make it a 'one pan clean-up with a twist' I d browned boneless pork chops (4) in an electric skillet; add sauerkraut & 3 peeled quartered potatoes and a pinch of caraway seeds. No apple. But what brings it all together...Add a can of BEER. Cover and set dial at 350 simmer for 40 minutes or until pork is thoroughly cooked. One pan cleanup and easy.

I have been looking for a great use for the frequently on-sale diced pork I find at my local market and this is definitely one! I have often used diced pork to make a too-tough Mexican stew but this recipe yielded a deliciously tender German pork apple and sauerkraut supper! I first sauteed some onions in olive oil and then added pork that I'd tossed with some flour and white pepper. Browned the meat then took it out to deglaze with some water and white wine as another reviewer suggested. Then I threw everything back in along with the can of sauerkraut two diced apples 6 small diced Yukon gold potatoes Tbsp. brown sugar a few splashes of white wine and some water and apple juice. It all cooked together tender and wonderful in less than an hour and every bit as fabulous as (if not more so and a whole lot quicker than) many other German pork/apple/onion/kraut things I've tried in my slow cooker or Dutch oven!

Made this tonight and loved it! I did not use an apple but instead I put in a decent amount of brown sugar to sweeten up the sauerkraut. My husband is not a fan of sauerkraut but he sure did gobble this up. I'll definitely be making it again!

I make this pretty often but here are the changes I make. I use 2 lbs of country ribs salt and pepper well then sear. I use 1 onion and 2 apples diced and saute in a bit of olive oil then use 1tsp of brown sugar to mellow the acidity. I return the ribs to the pot and cover with sauerkraut. Simmer for 4-6 hours and serve with mashed potatoes. Delish!

Very good I had a 2 lb jar of sauerkraut to use so I added the whole thing. I rinsed the kraut first and then sauteed. I also added 2 cans of golden pork gravy to the simmering mix and 1 Tbs brown sugar and of course salt and pepper to taste. We enjoyed this meal.

I was disappointed....ratings were good, so I gave it a try.  Made exactly as stated in recipe.  End result was rubbery pork cubes, surrounded by yuchy colored kraut mush.  Will not make again, threw it out.  Waste of time and food.

Great basic recipe. I double it and use 1/2 sauerkraut liquid and 1/2 chicken broth for the liquid. Be sure to rinse your sauerkraut so it's not so sour. Besides the apples I add raisins and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar as well as sauteed slivered onions. The whole family enjoys this recipe.

Very good and so easy. Didn't have as much flavor as my mother's but it was close enough will make again and again due to its ease. Added some apple sausage and bratwurst to the pot.

This was the best sauerkraut I've ever eaten. Unfortunately we didn't have any fresh apples so I just added two individual cups of applesauce. It infused the sauerkraut with a delicious sweetness. I wasn't sure I would like sweet sauerkraut but I did indeed! A new favorite in my house.

This was very good. Like a previous reviewer suggested I browned onion and added some brown sugar. I then browned the pork (cut into chunks) in the onion pan. This way the pork got nice and brown. Served it with boiled potatoes. Yummy!

I used tofu instead of pork and I thought it tasted great. Hubby was a little put off by soft applesauce like apples chunks with peel in his sauerkraut dish. I like the idea of adding in some sweet to counter the sauerkraut so maybe I'll do applesauce instead of apple chunks next time.

This was a wonderful easy chilly Monday night supper. I made it just as it was used a local saurkraut from our farmers market- (that may have improve it a little) It was a hit for our whole family including the youngest (7 yr. old) boy. It's a keeper- as my husband declared add it to the rotation!

I have been making this for years and love it. I add apples and caraway seeds to the onion and sauerkraut. I also sauteed the onion after I browned the pork chops. Making it tonight
