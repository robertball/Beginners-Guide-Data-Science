We love this except we always use mushrooms in place of the green olives and we thinly slice the onion instead of chopping. YUM!

WOW! What a yummy recipe. Cut recipe in 1/4s as I made it for only one person. I did not have dry red wine, but did have some Mogen David Concord Grape wine, cooked them to reduce the wine and make a glaze.Also omited the olives as I don't care for them. They turned out fantastic. Served them with a baked potato, peas and 3 bean salad.Thanks Va , for a wonderful recipe. They will be on my regular rotation.

This dish was awesome!  I love chicken liver and have been looking for a new way to cook it.  I didn't have any olives, but I imagine they would make a good addition.  I ate it with buttery mashed potatoes and peas, and scarfed it down!

I like chicken livers, and I thought this recipe sounded appealing, but I did NOT like the result.  The olives added nothing, the quantity of wine was too much.

I thought I liked liver...but this recipe makes me think that maybe I don't! It was just too bland for me, so all I could taste was the liver.  I made it with mushrooms instead of olives, and the result was warming and filling, but kinda blah.  I'd suggest using a really nice wine--following the old advice not to cook with a wine you wouldn't enjoy drinking--and maybe it would be better.  Still, if you're a liver-lover or a person who doesn't like spicy food, this would probably hit the spot.

I love chicken livers. However, this is just an awful, gray mess. Don't bother.

I was looking for recipes that are high in iron and found this one. Made it tonight and followed the recipe with the addition of baby Bella mushrooms. Perhaps I added too much wine because the sauce was really thin. But, my husband gave it 4 stars so this will a regular on our menu. I'll try it one of these days myself.

Because of an intolerance to alliums, I thought liver with onions was "done" for me.  I made a substitution using fennel bulb and horseradish, and this produced a nice aromatic flavor and a familiar crunch with the grilled fennel slices.

Good, overall. I agree that the flavor of the olives gets lost in the mix, though. Cremini mushrooms were a nice addition. I served this on toast points alongside an asparagus and fava bean salad, and a garnish of red roasted peppers.
