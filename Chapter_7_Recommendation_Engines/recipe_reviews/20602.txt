I made this with lighter counterparts--reduced fat sour cream and Truvia. I actually used only a half cup of Truvia (12 packets) and that was plenty sweet. This is incredible, even made as a light treat. We used this to dip fresh strawberries. Everyone loved it, even my husband.

This was so good and so easy. I served it over fresh ripe strawberries. Yummy. This is also a good topping for cheesecake.

I had a Russian roomate that introduced me to this dip, but she would add strawberries to the dip and use a masher to mix it all together. Excellent!

This topping is so easy! As a diabetic, I used nonfat sour cream and subbed cup-for-cup stevia powder in place of the sugar. It was excellent paired with fresh fruit as a topping for angel food cake. YUM!

This was exactly what I hoped it would be. I increased the sugar by one tablespoon to make it a little bit sweeter.

I’ve made this for years after working at a nice Sunday brunch restaurant. I was taught to use powdered sugar and clear vanilla but at home I use sugar free substitute and sometimes almond extract.

Made this recipe exactly as written and was delighted by the sweet childhood memories it conjured!  I did mix the berries into the cream and kept them refrigerated.  My husband adored this which is the highest praise I can give a recipe.  I’ll definitely keep and make this again now that I’ve rediscovered it!  Thanks.

One of my favorites. My kids ask for it all the time but I only make it for special occasions. We pour it over fresh berries - so good!

This is really good. I did use brown sugar instead of the white sugar. It didn't really change the color of the topping any more than the vanilla did. I do suggest that you add the amount of sugar that works for you.

This was so yummy! It tasted a lot like vanilla yogurt. I was pleasantly surprised.
