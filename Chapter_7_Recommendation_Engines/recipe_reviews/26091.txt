We made these for Cinco de Mayo, and they were great!  I used Crisco instead of Lard.  I also chopped up two fresh jalapenos and blended them with the other ingredients in the green sauce to give it an extra kick.  They were truly better than any tamales I've had in a restaurant.

This recipe was one of the best tamales recipes that I have made. It had a kick but not too much of one, also is easy preparation.

Yumm...excellent! It was a blast to roll these up with my partner, and when steamed in the microwave, they only take 30 minutes! Great tasting and soo tender.

Very simple and easy recipe to follow!!!  I added chiles to give it a little kick.  I did have to double the maza to keep up with the chicken!!!  I tried one batch crisco and the other lard, both worked well.  Only if the corn husk bags came with folding instructions!!!  (Each batch gets easier to fold!)

I made three differnt tamales (pork, beef, & chicken)for Christmas Eve.  Everyone thought these were the best.  I had to make a double batch of masa to use up the abundance of chicken filling.  I also substituted shortening for lard and it worked well.
