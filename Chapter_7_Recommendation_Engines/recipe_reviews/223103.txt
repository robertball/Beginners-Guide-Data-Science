Thanks for such a wonderful recipes.  I bought the rhubarb and strawberries but forgot the frozen pie crust at the store.  Boy am I glad I did!  I put three ingredients in the search engine, strawberries, rhubarb, and sour cream.  This dish is the only one that came up.  What luck!
The only change I made was used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white in place of the all white.

I made this gluten free.  I used Greek yogurt since I didn't have sour cream. The strawberries gave the rhubarb enough natural sugar so I cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup.I also cut the sugar down to 1/4  cup in the topping. This made it a low sugar dessert and more healthy.  It turned out delicious. The almond extract gave it a really nice nutty taste. Great way to use up the rhubarb in the garden. I'm thinking of freezing some rhubarb so I can make this healthy version through out the year.

This is an excellent use of rhubarb and strawberries from garden.  It has the perfect amount of sweetness and the cake has a wonderful texture.  Next time I would add a little additional fruit though.

A very good rhubarb dessert.  The batter does get thick when mixing, but it spreads nicely over the fruit.  It bakes with a cake-like texture.  I can see where this recipe would work great with other fruits beside the strawberries.  Thanks kkelly for sharing your recipe.

This is very very good! The cake layer is so fluffy and light. I think I will add more fruit next time, maybe some blueberries. There will be a next time.  This is a keeper!

Out of this world!!!  This recipe will be repeated every rhubarb-strawberry season, and probably with blueberries, peaches, and whatever else I can find.

I was excited to try this but unfortunately, it was a little bland. The only change I made was to halve the recipe because I didn't have very  much fruit. It's more of a cobbler than a pudding and the crust just didn't have a lot of flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. *Update 11/16. Tried this again in a slightly larger dish. I added a half teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and a little more salt. This seemed to help. Definitely needs more fruit.

I have made this two times in the last week. My husband just loves it. Soooo simple to make and an easy cleanup if you butter your pan properly. the only change I made was to add more (1/2 cup) rhubarb because that was left on the chopping board. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone liked it.  I followed the recipe as written except I had about 1/2c more of each the strawberries and rhubarb, so when I added the sugar I used heaping quarter cupfuls to account for that.  I also liked that I was able to assemble this way beforehand, put it in the fridge for a while, then bake it when I was ready and it cooked up perfectly.

This pudding was a hit at a pot luck I attended recently.  I couldn't find fresh rhubarb, so I ended up using rhubarb pie filling, which did the trick.
