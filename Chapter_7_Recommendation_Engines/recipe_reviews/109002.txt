This had a really good flavor a little thin though. A frozen orange juice mix or just some crushed ice would remedy that very easily.

I had some orange sherbet in the freezer that for whatever reason just wasn t being touched. A recipe ingredient search brought this up and I m glad I found it. I didn t measure anything exactly just poured and dumped everything into the blender and let it whirl. Nor did I bother with the pineapple garnish. This was frosty creamy and flavorful tho I think I d much prefer it without the pineapple juice.

This makes a great adult drink when you add a jigger or two of Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. Four thumbs up from my husband and I.

My kids all agreed that out of all drinks we have tried on here this one is the best so far.
