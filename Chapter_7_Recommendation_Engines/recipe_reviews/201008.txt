warning: my stars don't really count, 'cause i didn't follow the recipe!  when i ran across this, i was looking for something gyros-flavored, so i changed it up a bit to use what i had on hand, and i forgot the lemon juice and the dang red peppers!! it turned out really good, but i measured nothing so sure couldn't make a "real" recipe out of it, so thought i'd share here.   to a bunch of cooked shredded chicken, i added about equal parts of yogurt, sour cream, and hummus. added dill, coriander, cumin, onion & garlic powder to taste.  black olives, diced cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes.  the store didn't have pita (!!) so we used Arnold's sandwich thins.  bagels would have been good too.  wish i'd added lettuce; it would also have been good as chicken-salad-on-salad.  thanks for the inspiration!!  i was going to make hot gyros and it was way to hot a day to cook!!

Kelly: Very scrumptious (as is).  I made this for my boyfriend (who's a great cook) with the following modifications/suggestions: -2 small breasts of chicken (cooked and shredded) -3 cloves of garlic (small), quartered and sliced -1/2 cup European cucumber, quartered and sliced -1/4 Tsp. Accent -1/4 Tsp. salt -1/4 Tsp. ground black pepper  Topped with cayenne pepper (a dash)  This is a hearty, healthy chicken salad served on sprouted dill bread with yellow tomato slices and a handful of Spring Mix. I loved the Kalamata olive flavor.  Good work Kelly!   Enjoy!

MMM, MMM, MMM. Loved this! I added diced cucumber and tiny tomatoes instead of the bell pepper, otherwise all the same.  Love the low fat, high-fat-tasting dressing. Served over spinach/arugula greens with some pita chips on the side.

Fabulous!  I just made this today for lunch and it is great!  Trying to get away from so much mayo (which I love, love, LOVE) because it is really not good for you.  Greek yoghurt is the key here.  American yogurt just won't do!

Delicious. Did mine without the onions and olives (just personal taste preference), and it was divine. Toast your bread first under the broiler for a moment to get it crispy and warm, then smother with the salad and top with Feta.

This was very, very good--really great flavor combo. I love that it calls for yogurt and hummus instead of mayo--much healthier than mayo, but still tastes great. The only thing I changed was to add more red pepper. Delicious--thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a chicken salad that substituted yogurt for mayo and stumbled across this recipe. It was very simple, guilt-free, and satisfying. The only substitution I made was that I used some leftover chicken instead of canned. I would definitely make this again!

Not bad. I really liked the Kalamata olives and feta cheese with this. I'm not sure if Greek yogurt is something specific, but I just used plain yogurt instead with garlic, artichoke hummus.

I absolutely love hummus but did not care for it in this recipe.  I feel it would have been much better without it.  I suggest before mixing in the hummus, try a bite with and without to see which way you like it best.

Even though I don't associate chicken with Greek flavors I thought that this was really delicious and creative. I left out the onion and added a little garlic powder. I also didn't really follow the measurements of the recipe and did everything by taste/look while trying to keep the proportions the same, and it turned out just fine. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

The great thing about this is not just that it doesn't use mayo, but that it has an interesting taste. It's not bland but it still goes anywhere the usual chicken salad goes. Thanks, Kelly!

this is a great chicken salad, my husband and i loved it! i did make a couple little changes - i used 3 chicken breast and diced it up because i don't buy canned chicken.. i left out the bell peppers because i hate them and added some red seedless grapes and a few capers for extra flavor.. its a matter of preference, but we loved it!

What a great way to make chicken salad!  I don't like mayonnaise, so on the rare occasions when I make it, I use plain yogurt.  It never occurred to me to use hummus to add flavor - delicious!  I didn't have any lemon juice, and left out the olives -- but put it on a sandwich with cucumber, green pepper slices and spinach.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe - I'll definitely make this again!

Ok, so this recipe was a great start for me, but I made some changes according to my tastes... And it turned out soooo good! I used chicken breast that I had cooked in chicken stock, balsamic vinegar and juice from a jar of pepperoncinis. For veggies, I used chopped black olives, water chestnuts, red onion, finely chopped canned artichokes and pepperoncinis. As the "mayo", I used roasted garlic hummus, plain Greek yogurt and sour cream. Finally, for spices I used garlic powder, Greek seasoning and a dash of salt/pepper. And don't forget the feta! Let it sit for a few hours or overnight, the favors get even bolder. I served it stuffed in pita bread with a garden salad. I was so happy to find a chicken salad recipe without mayo- this is a keeper!!

I made this last night for me and my son (7 years old, hence the shoestring fries as a side) it was awesome. I did use skinless chicken thighs just cuz I love the flavor they bring. Also cuz I didnt know chicken in a can even existed. :-)

This is a great salad by skipping the bread.    I sautéed the onions and baby peppers.   I used a fresh chicken breast vs.  the can stuff.   Very yummy and filling.    Thanks for sharing

I used a combo of shredded chicken and chickpeas and stuffed into pitas with a mint yogurt sauce.  So Yummy!

I have made this recipe several times. The only thing I do different is the chicken- I slow cook a little less than a pound, shred it and then mix with all the above. This is my all time favorite lunch. THIS is what summer tastes like- and it is spectacular.
