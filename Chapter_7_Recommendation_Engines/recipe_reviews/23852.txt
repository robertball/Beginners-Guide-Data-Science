I've made this for years, and it's always excellent. I do now make some modifications to make it more healthy. First, I sautee about 1/2 c. onion with a couple of garlic cloves in a bit of olive oil, and add a 1/2 c. each carrot and celery and sautee it for a couple of minutes until softened before adding the broth, water and chicken. I also use 2 c. skim milk, and cut the butter to 6 tablespoons, and the flour to 1/2 c. It's still thick, creamy and delicious but cuts out a considerable amount of fat and calories, and adding vegetables gives it extra flavor and body. Perfect.

To be honest, I did a number of things differently with this, so I guess this is a review of a VARIATION of this recipe. After reading through it I knew  I wanted a heartier soup with more depth of flavor. I sauteed a few strips of bacon, then added chopped celery, onion, mushrooms and a big clove of garlic. Since I used a larger package of rice I decreased the amount of flour to 1/3 c. to allow for the added thickness the extra rice would provide, and I used 1 c. cream and 1 c. milk.  I also added an extra chicken breast and, during the final simmering, a healthy splash of white wine, probably a good 1/2 cup. The result was positively outstanding!

This is an oustanding, restaurant quality soup with great flavor. You do not need to use heavy cream. I have made this with 1% milk several times with fantastic results and it is still plenty rich and thick. Make sure to add some carrots and celery, as the soup all by itself seems like its missing something.

I’d describe this soup as “comforting”.  The flavors and thickness turn a gray day into a great day.  I read others’ advice and recommend these changes: start by sautéing ½ cup each of diced onion, celery, and carrots plus 1-2 minced garlic cloves using 1 tablespoon of the ½ cup of butter.  Then add the broth (5 cups), water (3 cups), and chicken.  For the roux, cut the flour to ½ cup and use 1½ cup milk instead of heavy cream. Once it’s smooth (not thick), add it to the broth/chicken/rice and add ¼ cup white wine if desired.  A friend of mine, who is a restaurant connoisseur, declared the soup to be restaurant quality!  What a compliment!

Spectacular!  Will be making this often during the winter.  I hunted high and low for a 4.5 oz package of the quick cooking rice with seasoning.  Couldn't find it - had to use a 6.5 oz box with seasoning packet.  I cooked the rice separately (didn't add seasoning packet) - it cooked for 25 min.  While the rice was cooking I poached the chicken - both took 25 min. so they were finished together. Then I proceeded with the recipe but I left out the 2 cups of water since I was adding cooked rice.  (the uncooked rice would have absorbed the 2 cups of water if I had used it).  I used the seasoning packet as directed.  I did find that 3/4 cup of flour was too much - I was slowly adding it so I was able to stop before it was too late - I used probably about 1/2 cup.  Anyway - this was the creamiest, thickest soup I have ever tasted and the flavor was great - oh, I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and sauted some onion, carrots and celery and I am glad I did.  It was much thicker the next day so I just thinned it a little with chicken broth - milk would have done the trick too.  Thank you so much submitter.

Great recipe! My whole family could not get enough. 

I did have a few minor changes. I added 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup celery and 1/2 onion. I sauteed the vegetables in a little bit of olive oil and garlic. Like other reviewers, I also cut the cream in half and used milk as a replacement(I would recommend 1 or 2% and not skim). I would also recommend Uncle Bens wild rice. Great flavor!

Will make again!

Very good soup.  I just had wild rice I purchased from the health-food store, so I didn't have a seasoning packet.  I used the following to season the rice: 2 Tbsp finely chopped onion, ½ tsp dry parsley flakes, ¼ tsp garlic powder, ¼ tsp onion powder, 1 tsp ground turmeric, ½ tsp ground cumin, ¼ tsp ground ginger.  Will definitely make again!

WOW!!!!  This is my new favorite allrecipes recipe and my new favorite soup.  I ate the entire pot (save the one bowl my bf got) over the weekend.  So, I made another pot today.  I think it would've been fabulous with no changes made but naturally I couldn't help myself.  Changes I made...used 3 cups homemade stock and 3 cups water/ chicken base (Minor's brand).  Because I used chicken base I omitted the salt.  I chopped a small onion and clove of garlic and cooked for a minute in butter/seasoning mixture before adding flour.  I reduced flour to 1/2 cup.  Used half and half instead of cream.  For the chicken I used 1 giant chicken breast that I grilled on my foreman and used the allrecipes Cajun Chicken marinade.  So the chicken was pretty heavily seasoned.  The folks who said this is restaurant quality are totally spot on.   Tonight I'm making bread bowls and serving it in that.

Wonderful soup! This one really sticks to your ribs and it's so flavorful. Talk about comfort food at it's finest, this will cure what ails you on a cold, snowy night. I use Uncle Ben's quick cooking Long Grain and Wild rice, how easy can it get? I use a 16 oz. carton of half and half instead of heavy cream. I add chopped celery and carrots and cook them with the chicken. This is so thick and rich, absolutely delicious.

I looked for this recipe because I absolutely love the kind that Panera Bread Company makes. It was delicious. Don't scale down the recipe, because you will want leftovers!!!

Pretty good, and really easy to make! For the chicken, I bought a warm, already-roasted chicken from the deli section of the grocery store -- delicious. I substituted the heavy cream for skim evaporated, and I used Rice-a-Roni brand instant rice. My only criticism is that it tasted like a slightly better-quality canned soup: the chicken was better than you'd ever find in a can, but the flavor, though tasty, wasn't terribly unique.

thank you so much for this recipe. made it today and my husband and i love it.  i will make it again, for sure!  i did make some minor changes, however. sauteed a little carrot, celery, and onion in 1 tbsp butter first.  used leftover rotisserie chicken, and uncle ben's regular, not quick, long grain and wild rice, just cooked it like on package directions, about 25 min. used whole milk instead of cream, and made roux with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour.  even with these changes the soup is so thick, rich, and creamy.  excellent recipe!

This recipe was a great base to add nearly any vegetable to it for more depth. I cut back on the amount of flour used in the recipe for the fear of the soup having a pasty taste to it. I used 1/4 cup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 1/2 cups of 2%milk, omitting the cream entirely. The soup turned out wonderfully, yet I needed a way to add veggies to my family's diet.

One of the best recipes on this site! Not only is this soup quick and easy to make, the flavor is out of this world! I made this soup per the recipe, using fresh baked chicken breast that was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and cubed instead of shredding. The only addition I made was the addition of some cut carrots I had laying around from a previous recipe. The results were absolutely fantastic! If I could give it 6 stars, I would. This is my new favorite soup. I'll never buy canned chicken soup again.

I've made this as is and it's very good.  I've just made it with the following changes that other reviewers have used and it came out AMAZING!! BF couldn't get enough!  I sauteed onion, garlic, and bacon in olive oil.  I then added some chopped celery and carrots and cooked until softened.  I added that mixture to the broth, water, chicken mixture and cooked according to the recipe. (Note - I used Uncle Ben's Wild Rice Mix.  Very good and healthier than the other brands at the grocery store)
For the cream mixture, I decreased to 6 tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup flour.  I also used 1 cup skim and 1 cup whole milk rather than 2 cups heavy cream and it was still rich, yet healthier.  I also added about 1/2 cup white wine to the soup during the last 15 minutes of cooking.
Next time I'll use shallots rather than onion to give it more oomph but it really is delicious either as is or modified to your liking.  Hope you give it a try!!

This is truely restaraunt quality soup with a few additions. So easy too! I used a rotissire chicken.  I do think the addition of veggies gives it more depth. I added a bag of frozen celery, carrots and onions that I got at kroger. It's called "mirepoix style blend" Worked perfectly. No chopping needed :) I used half and half and only half of the flour called for & it was still plenty thick & creamy. Also added a bay leaf, a tsp of sage and garlic powder while it was cooking through.. I think it really helped with the flavors! Next time, might add a little tyme.  Served with Hawaiian Sweet Rolls.  Yum!

Exceptional!  I added celery and carrots which I cooked with cubed raw chicken in olive oil in my soup pot first.  I also used milk instead of heavy cream.  My husband went nuts over this soup!  I will make again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Are there 10 stars?  This was absolutely delicious!  My husband couldn't get enough.  I was glad I doubled the recipe.  I actually added an extra packet of the rice, as well as the sauteed onions, carrots and celery, which really flavor and enhance the soup.   I only used 2/3 cup of flour for the double batch and that was PLENTY!  I added a little garlic powder and some nature's seasoning.  I would have added a little seasoning salt, but I didn't have any.  And I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream.  Very hearty.....the new comfort food at my house!  With french baguette, real butter and a salad....ahhh!

This recipe is the best!  You must try this recipe.  I used all chicken broth for the water for more flavor.  For a short cut I used Perdue Honey roasted chicken in the blue box all ready cooked and just chopped into smaller pieces.  The 4.5 oz pkg of rice is the Mahatma brand with the brown label.  First time I made it I used regular heavy cream.  Second time I used half and half.  Both were great but the heavy cream is just that, too heavy.  Use half and half.  I double the recipe the 2nd time I made it.  This will be a regular recipe in our house.

Very good recipe that works well in a crockpot! Add the 2 frozen chicken breasts, a box of Rice-a-Roni Long Gain and Wild Rice with seasoning packet, 4 cups chicken broth (or 3 cans), 2 cups water. 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup chopped carrots in a large crockpot. Cook on high for 4 hours or 6 hours on low. Make rue like original recipe suggests (except I used 2 cups whole milk) and add to crockpot. Cook 15 min. more on low.

Tasty recipe! Like many others, I too started with browning onion, celery, carrots and garlic. Rather than make my roux later and blend, I chose to start my veggies in 6 tablespoons of butter, and after 5 minutes, added my 1/2 cup off flour before adding my 1 1/2 cup of plain wild rice and 4 cups of Better Than Boullion Chicken broth (I am not a fan of packaged seasoned rice), brought it to a boil, than simmer for ~50 minutes. At the end I added 1 cup of half-n-half and 1 cup of skim milk. Seasoned with coasher salt and pepper. It turned out creamy and delicious. Next time I might experiment with herbs like Thyme or Rosemary.

Wow YUM!! I did add onion and carrots. I cooked them slow in a skillet with raw chicken breast. When the chicken was browned and veggies softened I added a splash of sherry then continued as written. The sherry added a nutty flavor without being over powering. EXCELLENT.~*~UPDATE: when using cooked chicken in this recipe, just throw it in at the very end. The soup will warm the chicken without making it chewy. ***UPDATE AGAIN**** I added extra wild rice that I had soaked over night. Also, a little bit of swiss cheese in the cream base works good with cooking sherry. I keep re-inventing this recipe and it gets better and better!

I gave this recipe 4/5 because you must have veggies for it to be good. I recommend browning some mushrooms and then satueeing celery/ onion/ carrots and then garlic. I used 2% milk, though skim would have been fine. Cream is not needed. i cut down on butter to 6 TBS and used light. I used shredded rotisserie chicken but would also in the future use whatever was on hand. Great start to a recipe but veggies is a must! Also I added more stock at the end to make it more soup like and less stew like.

DELICIOUS and so easy!  Really only takes about 25 minutes.  I use a whole rotisserie chicken, it's faster.  Also, to avoid some of the calories I use 2% milk.  I add some chopped mushrooms to the broth and some frozen peas as well. 
It's great with a handful of oyster crackers on top.   
Everyone loves this soup when I make it, it goes so quick.  
Great recipe

Delicious!  And a hit with the kids too. Because I had just plain non-instant wild rice, I had to make some alterations, but stuck to the recipe except having to account for cooking longer with more liquid and making my own seasoning mix.  I used the same amount of rice, but doubled the water - brought to a boil, added rice, and then covered tightly and simmered for 40 minutes - then added some sliced and diced veggies (carrots, celery, sweet red pepper, onion), brought back to a boil and simmered low for another 20 minutes before adding the roux. For the seasoning mix I used a teaspoon of ground sage, 1/2 teaspoon of savory, and heaping teaspoon of dry tarragon.  Oh, and I also only had about a cup of heavy cream on hand, so I supplemented with whole milk and it was perfect - so you could probably get away with "half and half" in this recipe.

This is the best soup I have ever made!  I did give 4 stars because I always add onions, carrots, and corn (and sometimes celery and peas) - I just think it needs veggies!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Since then, I have used 1/2 & 1/2 or 1% instead of the heavy cream, heavily seasoned my chicken before adding it (paprika, s&p, lemon pepper, etc) and use 2 boxes of the rice.  

Wonderful recipe, and there are so many things you can add to make it fit to your taste perfectly.  Thank you!

I have a gluten intolerant person in the house, so I modified it a tiny bit. Basically, I eliminated the roux. I started with the 4 cups of broth, and 1 cup of water. I had raw tenderloins, so cut those up and boiled them in the broth, along with celery, carrot and onion. I then added the rice mix (gf kind) and cooked that. While that was cooking to get the rice and veggies tender, I added a can of evaporated milk and about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of cornstarch, blended together as the thickener. I also threw in a couple handfuls of frozen corn. It turned out great. I know this is not the exact recipe as written, but it's nice to know that it can be made gf and still be acceptable to a family having dinner together.

I've made this soup a few times now and it's one of our favorites.  I never use all of the flour called for (makes it too goopy and thickens fine without all of it) I also just took some of the other suggestions and sauteed a little onion and garlic before adding in the broth, water and chicken to the pot.  The first couple of times I made the soup I used the cream, but tried it tonight with 2% milk and it was just as good (it lost a little "richness" due to the swap out) never the less it was still incredibly thick and creamy. It was great, we had the pleasure without the guilt. I always shred a good cup of carrot to throw in when I add the rice and I like to chop celery for some great flavor and texture too.  My 5 year old (who's quite choosy) LOVES it and calls dibs on the leftovers every time I make it. Incredible recipe - thank you so much for sharing it! ***Update - used Specialty "Chicken Broth with White Wine and Herbs" in place of regular and it blew our minds!

Excellent! I doubled the recipe since I had about 8 c. of homemade chicken stock on hand. Using suggestions from other reviewers I sauteed 4 cloves garlic, minced along w/ 1 c. each of onion, celery and sliced carrots and added this to the simmering stock. I used 4 c. of 2% reduced fat milk instead of the cream, but didn't have to double the butter or flour for thickening. The soup thickened up great with just the single recipe amount. I served this with a warm loaf of ciabatta bread... the whole family really enjoyed it! Thanks so much Stephanie!

Lovestohost, you were SO right about this soup. I had part of a huge package of baby bellas that I had to use up so I cut them up and threw them in with the onion and garlic that I sauteed in the butter. I used all homemade chicken broth instead of part water, and I used a box of Uncle Ben's mushroom wild rice. After I combined everything in the soup pot once the rice had cooked, I found I only really needed one cup of cream as I wanted it a little thicker. I also added about a half tsp. of thyme. Very, VERY good. Quite comforting. And this really only took about a half hour, as I started two pots at once. The pot with the rice and the soup pot with the vegetables. This one's a keeper. This really made a bad day good. Thanks to the submitter and suggester. EDIT: I find this works much better with cornstarch than flour.

This soup is raved about by my finicky kids. I've also brought it to pot lucks, etc and get many compliments.  However, I substitute low fat or skim evaporated milk for the cream (big difference in fat and calories) and add a can of corn.  It is still soooo thick sometimes it needs to be watered down.  I have to be careful now not to make it too often.  I don't want to wear out its welcome.

After going to Panera's and loving their soup, we decided to go home and search for a chicken and wild rice soup recipe.  This was perfect!  My husband said it was better than Panera's!!!  Very yummy and a great fall comfort food!  Thanks for sharing!

I, too, love the Panera soup--and this recipe tastes very much like it.  Instead of the heavy cream, I used fat-free half and half, and it was still very creamy.  I added chopped carrots, too.  This recipe is so easy and quick, especially if you have the cooked chicken already.  I cook and shred chicken breasts in advance and freeze it in amounts called for in the recipe.  This soup freezes well and makes for great leftovers!

AWESOME!  This is a fabulous recipe for left over chicken or turkey.   Hubby is a big fan of rice so this was a real hit with him, as well as myself.  The changes I made were to use whole milk, homemade chicken stock, and a larger 6.2oz. pkg. of wild rice with seasoning.  (It was what I had on hand).  This is definitely going into my cookbook.  Thank you Stephanie G for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!

4 stars for how easy it was, DH loved it, I thought the seasoning packet made the soup taste too much like canned, and I don't eat canned soup, so I'm guessing here. Anyway I did use less flour and butter because I didn't want stew like soup and it was a good consistancy for us. I also added carrot, onion and celery. I will make this again minus the seasoning packet, I'll add my own seasoning :)

I absolutely loved this soup- with some variations. I add a whole cup of regular rice, carrots, onions, celery, and tons of real, fresh spices instead of a seasoning packet. Adding the equivalent of 1 tsp parsley, 1 tsp rosemary, and 1 tsp of provence style blend of spice makes it kick!

I'm going to only give this a 4 star but it is by far a 5 star recipe and here's why.   There is no reason to use 2 different pots to put this soup together.  That's my reason for 4 stars. This is what I did.  I added carrots, celery and onion  per other reviewers suggestions in a dutch oven.  I cooked my veges in 6 Tbsp of butter til all of it was soft, about 10 minutes, maybe a bit less .  I then added the cooked, shredded chicken and rice to 48 ozs.  of chicken broth in this pot .  I used a 6.5 box of Uncle Ben's quick wild rice recipe.  There is no such thing as a 4.5 size box  of it.  This is probably a mistake to whomever looks over this recipe before it's allowed to be submitted.  They do change things.  I know from personal experience.  I then mixed together 1/2 cup of half/ half, 1 1/2 c. of 1 % milk,  flour and  wild rice seasoning. I whisked together in a bowl til there were on more lumps.  I then added it to the chicken, broth, veges  and rice and let it cook for the allotted amount of time.  No lumps and it saved a step and an extra dish to clean.   The extra veges were a bonus but I'm sure this soup would have been just a yummy without it.  I just like extra flavor.

Absolutely delicious. I chopped two carrots, two celery stalks and half a red onion along with four cloves of garlic, sauteed those in olive oil, and added to the mixture right before the final simmer.  I also used fat-free half and half and didn't notice any difference in texture or flavor. This is a keeper. I had lots left over so I froze the leftovers, and they're even better a few days later. Excellent recipe!

The soup was good but personally I thought the buttery flavor was too prevalent and I only used half of what the recipe called for.  I prefer a lemony taste with my chicken...Good soup just not my cup of tea.

LOVE THIS! The only thing I did differently: I took the advice of others, and sautéed onion, garlic carrots and celery in olive oil, then added it into the soup.  Also, instead of adding in the seasoning packet from the rice/mix box, I used 1 TBSP of salt-free Mrs. Dash Herb & Garlic seasoning.  I try to avoid the MSG and preservatives and extra sodium in those seasoning packets.  Turned out just fine!!!  I'll be making this again and again!  Oh and for those who might want to know, I bought a generic brand 6.6 oz box of rice/mix.  Checked on the back of the box instructions to make sure it called for 2 cups of water to cook the rice in.  :) Enjoy!!

I used pre-cooked chicken, which I browned up with some celery and onion in a small pot, in some butter.  Then I cooked some potatoes in the chicken broth (bouillon & water, really), diced bite size, for about 10 minutes.  Made a roux with 1/3 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter.  Used homogenized milk instead of cream.  Didn't use the rice.  Added couple cloves of minced garlic.  Chopped and added some cooked bacon.  And we dunked bread in it too.  Next time I may cut back on adding the 2 cups of water, because it may have been not thick enough (with the roux amount I made).

Love this, and I make it with non-fat milk.  I can't imagine it with cream!  I toss in a handful of dehydrated carrots with the broth, as well as a handful of dehydrated onions.  Today we had celery in the fridge, so I minced two stalks and sauteed them in the butter.  YUMMY!!!  (I bought 6 boxes of the long grain/wild rice when it was on sale, just so I could make this all winter long!)

I'm going to preface this by saying I made quite a few tweaks, but I never would have anywhere to begin w/out this recipe, so I'm rating it anyway, because it's a great soup! I sauteed onions & garlic in a little EVOO and added them to the water/broth mixture.  I halved the butter (and then adjusted the flour and milk accordingly) to lighten it up a bit.  I also subbed skim milk for heavy cream to again lighten it up some.  When I added the *cream* mixture to the broth, I added a bag of frozen peas and a can of canned corn (I do NOT rec canned corn, as it did give it a little of that *canned corn* taste, but it was l had.  I will def use frozen shoepeg corn next time!) to up the nutrient level.  At first bite, I wasn't sold.  Then, I kept eating.  This is very good and very simple!  I'd cooked my chicken breast in the crock pot a couple of days before, so the soup took less than 1/2 hour to make.  At service, I added a dash of nothing special canned parm cheese to the top and I loved it!  It really added a little something.  THANKS for a great base recipe!

Its cold outside and soup always tastes SOOO good when its cold - This is a great recipe !!!! My husband even likes it and he does not usually like or eat soup at all.
This soup is awesome !!!!
I made beer butt chicken the night before so I used what was left over from that. 
I saute'd celery,onion,garlic and fresh sliced mushroom before adding the broth (extra broth). I did not have the quick cooking rice so I let it simmer for 25 minutes. I used 2 boxes of rice - uncle bens and rice a roni (both) long grain and wild rice. I used 1 packet of seasoning in the broth and the other packet in the roux. I also used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup of 1% milk. This one is a keeper !!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe

THE BEST SOUP EVER - every bit as good as Panera.  

Followed Brown Sugar Girls suggestions with the following exceptions:

Used all chicken broth (8 cups)
Used 1-1/2 cups of half & half

Made this for Christmas Eve soup & salad and everyone loved it - I DIDN'T GET ANY LEFTOVERS!

Only other addition I might make next time is to add some chopped baby bella mushrooms.  Yum, Yum, YUMMY!

Great soup, and so easy!  I made it with left over turkey and it was great.  I used the box of Uncles Ben's wild rice, and I used less water and added some white wine in the final step.  This is a keeper.

I could not find anywhere in the supermarkets over here, easy cook rice that came with a sachet of seasoning powder. What we do have are a few rice packets that come with rice already flavoured. So I decided to use easy cook long grain and wild rice that came plain and add my own seasoning. Not knowing what flavour seasoning comes with your rice over there I used black pepper, sage, celery salt and lemon peel. I also sauteed onions and mushrooms before adding all the other ingredients. Yummy, but I think I will have to tinker with the seasoning I used to get it spot on. Shame I couldn't make it as you guys do though!

You really can't mess this soup up! I thought I might- I used random proportions of most of the ingredients based on what I had on hand. I used a larger rice box because it was all I could find and added some celery, carrots, onion, and mushrooms. Even with skim milk it was thick, creamy and delicious!!

I added carrots,peas, celery sundried tomatoes and peas. We like soups that are like stews. I added on 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 cup white cooking wine. I also used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Although mine is a little different it was delicious!!!

This soup is a terrific and hearty soup and a great way to use left over chicken or turkey. I used 2% milk but i think 1% or even skim would work. I decreased the butter slightly and added sliced carrots, celery, and a diced onion. YUM!

OH. MY. WORD.  Hands down, THE BEST chicken wild rice soup I have ever had, much less made myself.  Truly is creamy, as the title suggests. I used 2 cans of chicken and shredded prior to dumping in.  Such a good recipe.  Reheats well too! I've taken it for lunch several times this week!

I made this for my family for the first time tonight. It was a hit! I used the water that I boiled the chicken in (broth), added some poultry seasoning, a bay leaf, and vegetable boullion. I also used half & half instead of heavy cream. Needless to say, there wasn't any leftovers. Next time I will double the recipe so there will be some for lunch the next day!

Excellent Recipe! Everyone loved it here. I use all low sodium chicken stock (no water) and a regular box of Uncle Bens long grain and wild rice. I cooked the rice in water (use seasoning packet as it is called for in this recipe with the butter) until done and then proceeded as written. Worked out great. We will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING QUICK COOKING LONG GRAIN RICE OR THE RICE WILL NOT BE COOKED!!!!!!!!  If you can't find the QUICK cook rice either, use the regular Long Grain and Wild rice, but  cook the rice in the broth with step 1 according to the package instructions.)Wow, great soup! I did as others recommended and  softened 1/2 an onion, some celery, carrot and garlic in a little olive oil before step 1.  I would definitely make this again, Thank you!

Thick and creamy! I easily "healthified" this recipe and it couldn't taste better! This is a list of the specific products and amounts I used: low-sodium chicken broth, around 16-20 ounces of diced chicken breasts, Uncle Ben's Quick Cooking Long Grain & Wild Rice, 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup Blue Bonnet margarine, 2 cups 1% milk, 3/4 cup of each carrots and celery, a small diced onion, and around 1/2 tsp minced garlic. I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the vegetables and garlic with a smidgen of olive oil before adding the broth, water & chicken. Only 280 calories per serving (serves 8) using my modifications. P.S. It tastes just as good heated up later. My family loves this soup!!!

This was delicious! I cooked my rice separately because I didn't want the rice to absorb all the liquid. The wild rice still needed a little more cooking so I simmered it for a little while in the soup before adding the cream. I also used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and some milk instead of the cream and it was delicious!

Always the hit of the party. I too add the fresh sauteed veggies: onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms and use regular Uncle Ben's Wild Rice. I cook all on stove and then put in crock pot to keep warm and allow rice to continue cooking. I always make double batches (one at a time and then combine) and NEVER have any left overs. Adding a little touch of sherry and/or white wine adds to the flavor and when using cream, helps to reduce thickness if desired. This is a top recipe

This was wonderful! I added some mushrooms, shredded zucchini, shredded carrot, and poultry seasoning. Next time I will add my cooked chicken near the end so it doesn't want to fall apart. A big hit with my husband. Thanks!

This came out very good, and even better the next day!  I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed 1/2 cup each of chopped onion, celery, and carrots in olive oil before adding the chicken, broth, and water.  I used a whole package of Uncle Ben's 90-minute Wild Rice with Brown Rice (there was no seasoning packet).  I also used whole milk instead of cream.  It was a little thin on the first day, but perfect consistency on day 2.  My whole family loved this.  It went quite well with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits from this site.

I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed a bit on onion and garlic before starting the soup....and I am glad I did.  The only other thing I did differently was to add some corn to it.  I doubled the recipe thinking we could have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow...but hubby apparently didn't like that idea.  He ate the rest of the leftovers so there was none left.  Thanks for the post, we will definately be making this again.

This is a really delicious soup.  I'm trying to stay a little on the health conscience side so I changed a few things.  I added an onion finely chopped, two carrots diced, and some poultry seasoning.  I also didn't have any chicken broth so I used chicken boullion with water.  I also used two cups of whole milk with a little cornstarch in place of the cream, 3 tablespoons of butter instead of a whole stick and just added enough flour to make the roux.  I didnt have the rice with the flavor packet so I used an Uncle Ben's wild and brown 90 second packet instead.  This soup is great for a cold night and is definitely a keeper.

This was an excellent soup.  Very rich and creamy with lots of flavor.  I added steamed carrots and celery - which I think is a must.  I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store deli and used pretty much the whole chicken minus skin of course.  Next time I'll also add a can of corn.  My finace isn't a big fan of soup and he really liked this recipe.  Thanks this is a keeper

Oh My Stephanie..........this is the best!!  I had a party Friday night, and this soup was the hit.  Even the MEN were coming up, saying, "Great Soup!"  My friend took it to a party Saturday night and had to use their computer to print off six copies of the recipe DURING the party.  THIS IS WONDERFUL.  COMFORT FOOD AT IT'S FINEST!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

I love this soup. It has become my signature dish for bringing to families with new babies. I add carrots and celery and use milk instead of heavy cream. It is still plenty creamy that way so I can't imagine how thick it is with heavy cream. I don't think there is enough rice in it so I usually double the recipe but use three packages of rice and add a little more liquid to compensate.

This recipe is ingenious!   So much easier and even tastier than my more complex and tedious recipe I had been using.   I have made this repeatedly to rave reviews!  The only change I make is to add more to it- carrots, celery, onion, garlic and prepared wild rice.   I'm in MN and it's a crime to not use a heap of real MN wild rice in a wild rice soup.   This is now my go-to recipe for chicken wild rice soup!  Thank you!

This is funny.  Everyone loves the recipe but no one follows it.  LOL.  Okay, I replaced heavy cream with %1 milk, added carrots, celery, onion, and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I ditched wild rice/packet for plain jasmine rice and it was still very tasty.

Funny thing is that the rice absorbed the soup within an hour.  So I had these odd 'clumps' of soup as leftovers.  Soup Softballs, if you will.  When reheating, add at least a cup of water and it's good.

I also followed other reviews and added veggies - carrots celery & onion. I used slightly less butter ans half cream, half 1% milk b/c that's what I had in the fridge. It was probably the best soup I've ever made. Good thing, because I tripled the recipe and fed 4 families that night with leftovers! Definitely will make again. My kids, 2, 5 & 6 loved it!

This soup tastes just like the Chicken Gnocci soup at the olive garden! I could eat it everyday, but then I would be really fat.

I added an extra chicken breast and a bit more chicken broth, but it realy is great as-is. More of a cold-weather meal though. I messed up and added the rice seasoning to the chicken broth, but it didn't matter.

Excellent! And after some adjustments VEGAN friendly. 4 cups of Vegetable broth replaced the chicken broth. Used 1/2 unbleached all-purpose flour. Earth balance replaced the butter. 1 cup soy milk blended with 8 oz of silken tofu replaced the heavy cream. Used Quoron Chick'n tenders in replace of chicken. Loved it! I've been vegetarian for 23 years and this is one of the best soup recipes I've tried. Thanks!

This recipe is great! As other reviewers suggested, I added about two cups of veggies to add more flavor and used half and half instead of heavy cream. To save time I use a savory rotisserie chicken from the grocery, I think the seasoned chicken really adds to the soup.

Wow! DH told me this was the best soup I ever made! I also sautéed carrots, celery, onion and garlic.  Added that to my broth mix, poached my chicken and shredded it. I used Uncle Bens original. I doubled the broth and rice. Used 2/3C of flour, cut the butter in half and used FF 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream! This was so good! Everyone said mmmmm, we will definitely make this again! Thanks so much for sharing

Amazing. Love it. Used all of Carrie's modifications, and after eating it this way, you're definitely not missing anything by getting rid of the cream, it's absolutely "creamy" without it. I also added a cup of corn nibblets. I would highly recommend adding that too!

"Yummy soup," said my son. Sums up a thumbs up. UPDATE: This has become one of our favorite soups. I add diced carrot, onion and celery and saute in olive oil.  While the veggies are softening, I heat 2 cups of water in the microwave and added 2 Knorr's chicken bouillion cubes, stirring to dissolve. Then I pour the  in the Long Grain & Wild Rice (Rice A Roni 4.3 oz.) into the broth to soak while I wait on the veggies. When the veggies are soft, I add the butter (1 stick) to them and stir all together (no sense in dirtying another pan.) Then I whisk in the seasoning packet, 1/2 c. flour (3/4 c. made it too thick for me), then the cream to the veggie mix. When the roux is done, I gradually add the broth and water, stirring to combine. Then let simmer for 25 minutes or until rice has softened. UPDATE #2: I made this full-fat for company. While it was divine right then, after storing it, I saw all the butter that separated on top. Next time I'll be using a light version for sure!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for my family, and a husband who hates soup.  He really liked it and said he wanted it again.  My MIL and SIL thought it was awesome also.  As a sidenote, I did follow the direction of some other reviews.  I added 1/2 cup each of carrots, onions, and celery (sauteed in 1 Tbsp. butter).  I subbed milk for the cream and did 5 cups of broth/3 cups water.  I used Rice-a-Roni 'Long Grain & Wild Rice'.  It comes in a 4.3 oz box.  It was perfect.  I also used leftover Rotisserie Chicken.  My search is over for a good chicken-wild rice soup.  This is the best!

This soup was AMAZING!  I love wild rice soup in restaurants and I am so glad to have found a recipe that duplicates that right at home.  Made as stated except sauteed carrots, celery and onion first and added the broth etc to that mix.   I made the full fat version with cream, but may try to sub skim milk in for some of it next time so that I don't feel quite so guilty eating it.  :)  I will make this again and again!!

This is such a great recipe.  I do doctor it up with carrots, mushroom, white wine, garlic.  I also omit the cream and use skim milk instead.  It is still very thick even using skim milk.  It makes a ton, so I freeze it in small containers and then can bring it to work for lunches.

absolutely wonderful soup!  i added about 15 baby carrots (boiled to soften), celery (3 stalks), and garlic (sauteed the garlic and celery) and i didnt have all the cream so i did 1 cup heavy whipping and 1 cup whole milk.  it was perfect!!  thanks so much!!  by the way, i think you could definitely get away with using regular milk to decrease the calories.

Just what I was looking for.   I love the cream of chicken and wild rice soup at Panera and this does the trick with some simple modifications.   Saute carrots, onion, celery and garlic in butter or olive oil first then add liquids and boil per the recipe.  Also as another reviewer suggested you can use 6tbsp butter and 1/2 cup flour with 2 cups skim milk and the soup is perfect.   Yummy, thanks for posting.

This was a huge hit!  So delicious and filling.  I had to add a bit more chicken stock when reheating it the next day to thin it out a bit - not a problem.  I will be making this again (and again)!

Wow DELICIOUS!! I followed other revieweres advice in and subsituted what I had:  I sauteed 1/2 cup finely chopped celery + 1/3 cup onion and 1/3 cup carrots in 3 TBSP butter with 1/2 cup white wine til soft then added the vegies to step one directions (added to broth and chicken).  I also didnt have cream on hand so subsituted a 12 ounce can of Carnation Evaportated milk. added maybe a 1/2 cup water to round out the measurements.       I also only had Rice A Roni Brown Rice mix in the pantry so used that (about 1/2 cup rice) used whole seasoning packet though as directed in recipe.  VERY EASY VERY HANDY recipe will use again and again!    ****QUESTION.....AM never SURE ABOUT WHAT I CAN FREEZE SAFELY??? would appreciate comments on with these subsitutions can i freeze this soup?!?!?  Great to have ready when you feel the winter crud coming on!! Thanks to all!

I never reviewed a recipe before, but this one is great!  I used homemade stock, leftover chicken, Near East Brand boxed wild rice, omitted the salt, and used half & half instead of heavy cream- still came out wonderful.

This is awesome! I have made 3 times in the last 3 weeks. Great with grilled cheese. I reduced the butter, flour, and cream to make this more WW friendly :) Highly recommend Uncle Ben's Fast Cook Wild Rice for the best flavor!

Awesome!! Just made it tonight and it's wonderful.  Made as directed, but added a little more pepper, seasoned salt garlic powder, and a bit of red pepper. You would pay big $ for a bowl of soup like this in a restaurant.
**Just made this again (for the hundredth time!) and just wanted to let you know that you don't have to use the wild rice mix - any flavor of rice mix will work just as well. Our favorite is chicken and three cheese rice!

Easy and so good.  I usually make with fat free milk, still comes out plenty thick and creamy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome soup!  I also added carrots and celery, and used half cream and half skim milk.

I loved this soup.  I did saute some celery and carrots and then added them to the mixture.  I also used 1% milk because that's all I had and it still came out rich and creamy.  Oh I also added another box of the rice because I like my soups thick.  This will be great in the winter.

With added veggies, (I sauteed a whole onion, 3 large carrots, and 4 celery stalks), it's a 5 star! I also added some Trader Joes 21 seasoning. Thick, creamy, and delish!

Not bad. If for nothing else, I appreciate the fact that this is made with natural, wholesome (albeit FATTENING!) ingredients. Having said this, I think I would have liked this MUCH less had I not made several MUCH needed changes. To start, I added 1/2 c. each of chopped onion, celery and carrot. I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic. I sauteed my garlic / onion in ~ 2 T vegetable oil and then added the rest of my veggies and sauteed until tender and *almost* cooked cooked thru. My only other changes were to add 1/2 c. of white wine (chardonnay) to my roux mixture (it seemed a tad thick otherwise) and season with a GENEROUS dose of s&p prior to serving. Even still, my hubs and I felt this could use a bit more tweaking. We both felt this was skimpy on two key ingredients - chicken and rice. NOTE: Don't sweat it if you are unable to locate the 4.3 oz. box of rice called for. The larger, standard size (6.4 oz.) one worked just fine (and we still thought we could have used more). DO be sure that you are using INSTANT rice tho! Sourdough bread bowls were a perfect way to serve our soup. A sprinkling of sharp cheddar really hit the spot. I'm glad to have given your recipe a try, but it needs a lot more tweaking to suit us. Thanks Stephanie! :-)

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I found it after moving to a town with no Panera Bread, which is the only place I've found that serves my favorite soup.  This replicates it well and might be even better! 

The only modifications I make are substituting 1 cup half and half and 1 cup skim milk for the heavy cream.  I think it turns out very creamy and healthier.  I also add carrots.  

It's also very easy to make if you cook your chicken in the slow cooker the day before (in 2 cups water, for 4 hours on high)... it makes shredding a breeze, and cuts down on time in the kitchen when making the soup. :-)

This was a very simple and easy recipe to make. I made this exactly as the recipe stated so that I could critique the soup in its original recipe form. First, some have had trouble finding 4.5ounce packages. I'll tell you that I think only Rice-o-Roni has them in packages that small for MOST stores like Publix. Next, the prep and cooking time are all wrong. A roux takes at least five minutes and thats not including if you have to cook the chicken rather than buying precooked boneless chicken. Anyway, once you get rolling with that and are able to serve up a hot bowl of this stuff it is absolutely splendid. As others have said, it's great for a cold day, heck make two pots of it for two cold days! You won't find a better recipe of this type of soup on this site.

The soup was easy to fix and tasted okay with bread. I wasn't that impressed as it wasn't as good as Panera's, which I was hoping for. My kids also wouldn't eat it so I won't be making it again, but we area all picky eaters. But again, it was very easy to fix and the roux turned out fine as well.

This was fantastic and will be making this when we are in the mood for soup!!!!  I used Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice. The rice didn't come with a seasoning packet for the roux so I used chicken bouillon granules-delicious!!! Next time I will make the full batch because it's already gone:)

VERY GOOD.  I doubled and added some carrots, onion and celery and upped the chicken broth (lowered the water) and used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 skim milk to lower the fat.  Definitely a keeper!

It is delicious soup and easy to make.  I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream which I didn't have at that time. And added onions, carrots, and cerely.  My family loved this soup, and we served with homemade bread.

Wow. Amazing. One of the best soups I have ever tasted. I prepared it exactly as written, I just added a little Tony Chacere's seasoning at the table. I cooked the chicken breasts by poaching them in Chicken broth. 

I'll definitely make this again, but I will try some of the suggested changes to get the calories and fat down to a reasonable level.

Soup was fabulous. Milk can be substituted for heavy cream and the creaminess is not compromised.

Loved this!!!  I agree that it needs more liquid, it got very thick at the end.  I did add carrots and some garlic salt but stayed true to the rest of the recipe.  Will definitely make this again!!!

Delicious and this could not be easier!  I used Costco's packaged grilled chicken strips that I cut into bite size pieces which worked great.  Rotisserie chicken would be good too.

Very good!  I had to use a non dairy creamer due to my lactose intollerance and it still rocked! I followed the recipe to a tee but did do as others suggested and sauted carrots and onions in olive oil before adding the broth/chicken mixture.  I was out of fresh garlic so I used garlic powder, it still worked! I was craving a recipe like this and it just hit the spot! Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow!!!

This recipe amazed me. I was not expecting it to be so good! I made almost as written. I used 4 chicken breast and some additional broth, replaced the cream with 1% milk, and added a few things as per other reviews - onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. I used the Lipton Sidekick Wild Rice. I will definitely make this one again!

Just as good as my husbands favorite restaurant version.  Did take others recommendations and added ½ cup each finely chopped celery, onion, carrot and mushroom (saute'd)  Also used fat free ½ & ½ and lite butter.  Couldn't tell the difference. Would be stellar with grilled or fire roasted chicken.

Tried this recipe and absolutely love it. Only variation was that I used beef broth because thats what I had. Next time I will use chix broth but honestly can't imagine it could be any better.

Great recipe!  It was good the day I made it and for leftovers.  I made some variations (milk instead of cream, package of rice pilaf instead of wild rice) because of what I had on hand.  The lesson I learned is that this recipe is a great base recipe and can be changed to fit your families tastes or what you have on hand.  Really great!

My favorite local restaurant to get soup recently closed, but I learned from a friend of a former employee (small town) that all their soup recipes were found on allrecipes.com.  After a pretty extensive search, I found this recipe and, after making it, am convinced this is the recipe for the best soup they served.  As many others say, it really is restaurant quality.  Only thing I did different to lighten it up a bit was I used a can of evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup of 1% milk.  Still very creamy and satisfying.  I love it!

I love this soup so much it has been a staple in my house in the Fall and Winter months.  Over time, I've learned the recipe by heart and although it varies over time depending on the ingredients I have available (skim milk, half and half, different veggies) it always comes out great.  To save time (and dirty dishes) I usually saute the veggies, cook the roux with them, then add the chicken, broth, rice and cream to the same pot.

We loved this soup!  It was very creamy, had a lot of flavor, and was reasonable calorie wise.  I cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot all day, used some of that meat and also the chicken broth...it was delicious!  I highly recommend this soup!

This was a wonderful recipe. I added veggies to it though. I added celery, carrots, onions and garlic. I also added some seasonings. I also used the superbowl bread bowl recipe and the end result was amazing. My husband still brags about it :)

I made this soup over the weekend. I used left over turkey meat, as that what was in my frig. I never would have thought of using boxed wild rice, but the seasoning pack is key to the flavor in this soup. I also added in veggies (onions, celery, spinach, and carrots) since I have to hide veggies into meals so that my family will eat them. I only used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 C fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to get the creamy texture without all the fat. 
My husband said that this is the "best soup I have ever eaten!"

LOVE this recipe.  It's definitely gone on my Top 5 favorite recipes (which are all easy and delicious!).  The only change I make to the recipe is use two boxes of rice since I prefer a thicker soup

I made this with cream of mushroom soup (low-sodium) instead of the heavy cream, as well as the sun-dried tomato flavored wild rice, and it was perfect for a late-winter evening. Really easy and really quick.

Wonderful soup!! My husband couldn't get enough. I used others suggestions, added carrots , onion & celery, fat free half & half & only half a cup flour & 
 6 Tbls. butter. Only complaint, I would have liked more wild rice so next time I will make some separately and add to soup.

Think it will be better next time but a great start.  It was too thick, and I didn't even use all the flour.  Next time I will cut back on flour.  I used fat free half and half and it was very creamy.

I think this soup is perfect.  It is hard to mess up too.  I did things in different order and I don't think it even mattered.  I did sub some white wine for 1/2 the water, cut back on flour slightly and cooked the rice separately as others have.  I also added celery, carrots, onion, and garlic.  A bit more salt and pepper.  However, I owe the main taste to this soup.  It is the right creaminess and makes a great base you could do lots of things with.  Spectacular comfort food.  doesn't get any better than this.

This was delicious. I couldn't find a 4.5 ounce package of wild rice so I used a 6.1 ounce package of Uncle Ben's quick cooking long grain and wild rice, butter and herb flavor. I increased the water by a cup and it turned out perfectly! Very delicious!

Yummy, hearty, thick soup, just the way I like it.  the only changes I made was to use half n half instead of cream & I substituted 1 cup of white wine for 1 of the cups of water.  Also, I cooked the chicken breasts whole in the boiling broth mix before adding the rice, then shredded them in the food processor.  Turned out great.

This is a great base to begin with.  We like the rice but would rather boil the rice separately so it doesn't get all mushy.  Also wish there were more rice, so we would boil more brown rice separately.  We added frozen peas to the soup, and it would be great with corn, celery and a tiny bit of carrots.  Otherwise, the taste is excellent.

My husband kept saying how much he loved this all night! Lots of flavor, really good :) I really didn't measure anything at all, just went by texture! So I'm sure it wasn't exactly the same. I didn't have rice with seasoning packets, I only had the Knorr's rice packets (I used Garlic & Butter), the seasoning already mixed in with the rice. So it cooked in the pot with the chicken and broth, which I think might have enhanced the flavor! I sauteed onions, and for the last few minutes I threw in minced garlic, and garlic salt. Very very good!!

Very tasty!  Kept the same concept but cooked it a bit differently.  Sauteed about a cup each of carrots, celery and onions, sprinkled them with flour for the roux.  Added the broth and rice (accidentally bought the kind that needs to simmer 20+ minutes); mixed in the chicken and a bit of S&P and when the rice was tender added in 2c of half & half instead of heavy cream.  Mmmm.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe this week!  :)

Good soup!  The only change I made was adding a little bit of frozen mixed veggies.  I thought it was tasty but not excellent.  My parents loved it & my young boys ate very little.  I'll probably save the calories from the heavy cream for something else.  Thanks though.

As written, 4 stars.  With adjustments, 5.  I sauteed 1/2-3/4 cup each diced onion (1 small), celery (1 stalk) & carrot (2 small) and 2 cloves minced garlic in the butter (used 6 tbsp) then added the flour (1/2 cup) and 2% milk (not cream) as directed.  Also, can't find "quick cooking" wild rice mix here so used regular - just cooked it in the full broth / water mixture called for in this recipe (omitted the margarine required on the box) until the rice was tender, then added in the chicken (about 1 lb) to heat through when it was cooked.  Combined the milk/broth mixtures and finished as directed.  Absolutely delicious.

I have made this soup many times, and I love it. I agree that adding carrots and celery makes it much better. One quick note: if you do use a rotisserie chicken, it will change the flavor of the entire soup dramatically. Not that it is necessarily a bad change, just different. I like the flavor of the soup so much, I probably will not use a rotisserie chicken again.

Fabulous.  Despite other reviews regarding milk to replace the heavy cream, I used skim and it was still great.  Also cut butter down to 6 tbsp.  Everyone loved it and nobody knew it was "healthified".  I have made this numerous times and have had to double the recipe lately.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Absolutely 5 stars. I cooked my frozen chicken breasts in the broth/water mixture, because I wanted the chicken water for my soup (husband is sick, wanted whatever magic that cooked chicken has to be in my soup, not poured down the drain). Shredded them in the broth. It takes about an hour using 2 completely frozen breast halves. If it doesn't shred nicely, it isn't done yet, keep boiling. You lose some fluid this way, so you'll need to adjust at the end by adding more broth, water, or milk, whatever suits you. Taste it first to see which of the three you want. I tend to like my soups a wee bit thin, so for the roux I only used 4 TB butter and 4 TB flour. I did wind up thinning mine with skim milk (overall around 2 cups, but I changed the method some, so that affected the liquid ratio). This was just overall far more wonderful than I really expected & I could not be more pleased. I wish my husband's taste buds were working properly so he could've fully appreciated it! Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again :) (BTW, if you do decide to boil your chicken in the broth, whether frozen or raw, in either case, stuff will float up to the top. Skim it off and trash it, you don't want to eat that part. It won't hurt you though if you forget. It's just jibbles of fat.)

This is FANTASTIC!  I am sitting here eating it for breakfast while I wait till noon to buy white wine to make it even BETTER!  I made it low fat with 2% milk, 4T of butter.  Still nice and thick. Also took other's advice and sauteed 2 strips bacon with onion, carrots, celery and garlic.  I cooked the chicken right in the with the broth and then diced it when it was done.   Very easy! This is a staple on our "Sunday Soup Night" menu.  I only wish I had tripled it!

This is one of those sleeper type recipes. You know,very popular seasonally, usually autumn and winter. It then slips away while we enjoy the lighter fare of spring and summer returning again as the temperature drops. With few ingredients this is a soup that is definitely not stingy on flavour. I added about 1/4 C. small diced carrot, only to enhance the colour. Not having heavy cream, I opted for a mixture of 1/2 and 1/2 and milk. The finished soup has a perfect consistency while still warm. It will later require thinning. I suppose I am at a point in my own cooking where roux is no longer a four letter word. Which, by the way, was a long time coming and made for some mighty horrid outcomes. Everything was working as it should roux-wise here, but I became worried at the thickness while the cream was being incorporated. Thick enough to get tangled up and stuck inside the whisk even! Experience told me to keep adding the liquid as directed even though the potted floury blob didn't look promising. Keep whisking, and babysit, as this easily becomes overdone, quickly browning or even burning the pot bottom. More so, if using a thin (cheap :-})pot like me. Don't give up. It will work! Overall I think this is a deliciously fine soup. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this on a cold rainy Saturday and it was delicious. I also added diced onions, carrot, celery, mushrooms and garlic. I used half and half instead of cream and added one chicken bouillon cube for each cup of water. I also doubled the recipe. Everyone loved it and the leftovers were yummy too. This is definitely a keeper; the best cream soup I've ever made and just as good (or better) than you'd get in a restaurant.

Mmmm,Mmmm Good!  My 3 children even all eat this soup.  A few changes that I made were: 1) I first sauteed 1/2 cup each of celery, onion carrots and 1-2 garlic cloves. 2) I increased the broth to 5 cups and increased the water to 3 cups. 3)Instead of 2 cups heavy cream I used to cups 2% milk. 4)Reduced the flour to 1/2 cup.  Without the increase in liquid, I felt the soup was just too pasty and thick.  Very Good!!!

As is, the recipe is delicious (the only thing I did differently was to use milk instead of cream).  I made it a second time adding about two cups worth of mirepoix, and I liked it much better that way.  So the recipe as is gets 4 stars, but with the added vegetables, it's definitely a top-ranked recipe in my house.

This is a VERY forgiving recipe... First of all I used 2 (8.8oz ea.) pkgs. of "Uncle Ben's Ready Long Grain and Wild Rice" instead of the rice with seasoning packets.  I just bought the wrong thing but used it anyway.  I had many things going on in the kitchen when I the butter/cream/flour mixture was thickening up on the stove.  It was lumpy and overcooked.  Used it anyway.  This recipe turned out great with all of the mishaps.  My entire family rated this *****!  Thank you for this soon to become family favorite!

With a few minor changes this soup is outstanding!  I was sooo impressed.  I didn't have any dry white wine on hand so I took a risk and used burgandy instead.  I was not disappointed.  Cooked the chicken in burgandy and garlic which gave it great flavor.  Also added a small can of mushrooms and just over 1/2 c shredded baby carrots.  Added a splash more burgandy to the soup once I added the rice.  Wasn't as thick as I prefer so I added a bit of corn starch and viola!  It was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm only giving this three stars because as written, I think it would make for an extremely bland soup.  I made the changes suggested by others.  Most definitely add some diced onion, carrots, and minced garlic sauteed in olive oil.  And even after only using 1/2 c. flour I still found the soup lacking some taste so I added a couple of tablespoons of white wine and some lemon juice.  If I had some on hand, I also would've added a tiny bit of chicken base just to give it a bit more depth but with the changes it really did turn into an excellent soup!!

WOW! Great soup. Don't love a creamy soup because I think it = fatty.  Perfect consistency. I used skim milk and added celery, garlic, carrot small sliced.  the wild rice and the seasoning packet is what made this recipe outstanding.  We were so pleased about this soup that we talked about it for days.  this will be a go to recipe.

I thought this soup was pretty good when I made it exactly like it says in the recipe. I did feel like something was missing and I think if I make it again, I will take some of the suggestions of adding vegetables. It was pretty bland with nothing in it but chicken and rice.

I LOVE this soup. It's so delicious. But I do make a few changes. You've got to add onions, carrots and celery. I saute the onions with some garlic and a little bit of minced ginger, adding in the carrots and celery a couple of minutes till tender. I cut the cream in half, otherwise it's just TOO thick. I use 1 c. cream, 1 c. milk. I've also made it with 1 c half n half and 1 c. milk. They seem about the same. Definate must

Loved it!!  I followed several other reviewers suggestions...adding carrot, onion, and garlic...using fat free half and half...only 1/2 cup flour...6 T butter (1 T to sautee veggies and 5 T for roux)...all canned fat free low sodium chicken broth.  I also used canned chicken breast.  It was a little salty for my tastes so next time I won't add any to the flour.  Really hit the spot on a cool spring day with hayfever kicking into overdrive!

I also used skim milk instead of heavy cream and it was very creamy and good.  My daughter, who is very picky, had seconds.  I will make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a big hit for everyone in my family.  I realize it's not the healthiest dish, but as far as taste goes, it was delicious.  I would definitely make this for company.  I didn't make any changes like other reviewers suggested because I wanted to try the recipe as is...and I thought it was great that way.

Even though I tweaked the recipe a bit, (and don't we all add our own touches to recipes?) by using all chicken broth, omitted the water, and added sauteed onions, garlic, and celery, and added some mushrooms, frozen peas and carrots to make it a complete meal. My family greatly appreciated this meal on such a cold rainy January.

this is a really nice soup. i am giving it a 4 rating because i did tweak a bit to make more flavorful. i added about 1/4 cup of white wine and used fat free half and half to cut down on calories. i like the consistency of this soup. (nice and creamy and thick).

Great recipe!  I added finely diced onions, celery & carrots that I bought in the produce aisle at the supermarket, as well as LOTS of fresh chopped rosemary.  I think the texture of the soup is absolutely perfect, all measurements can be used exactly as written with success.  But what could make this a winning gourmet soup is the addition of fresh herbs - don't forget to add fresh rosemary and some parsley, it will make all the difference!

This recipe gets the coveted HAPPY FACE sticker!!!  Yum yum! I did use 2% milk as some suggested and it tasted fine.  Also, I sauted chopped onion, carrots, celery and a clove of garlic and tossed them in with the chicken, rice & broth while the roux was being prepared. Next time I will up the garlic another clove. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!  Thanks Stephanie!

This recipe was sooo good.  I did use skim milk to replace the heavy cream and it turned very thick and creamy.  I will be making this again!

This soup is absolutely divine! My entire family loves it! I did make a few changes however: instead of heavy cream, I used a combination of half & half and whole milk. Also, instead of cooking my own chicken, I picked up a hot-and-ready whole Rotisserie chicken from the store and removed the meat to use in the soup. As everyone knows, Rotisserie chicken meat is very tender and juicy, so it was just perfect in the soup! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!!

Yummmm. Very good. I also added celery and carrots like another reviewer recommended. The soup was thick and ended up being packed with chicken, rice and veggies (I used a little extra of all of them). My mom said it was "better than Panera's" and my husband said "definitely a repeat."

I was hoping to find a recipe similar to the chicken and rice soup they serve at Panera.  Luckily I found this recipe.  So good!

I made this for a curling bonspiel. I heard only positive comments.  Instead of buying raw chicken I bought the fully cooked rotissary chicken at the store and used the stock that came with it to help flavor the broth. I did add more wild rice and a little onion powder. I will make again.

Wonderful!  I have prepared this recipe as written as well as making a low fat version.  Both versions were excellent and I could tell little difference between the two.  For the healthier version, I followed the changes suggested by other reviewers and used 6T butter, 2% milk, and 1/2 C flour.  Thank you for sharing this recipe that my whole family loves!

I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a few small changes to the recipe:  Softened 1 finely minced garlic clove and 1/4 c each finely minced onion, carrot, and celery in a small bit of olive oil before adding water, broth, and chicken; replaced cream with 1 can of full-fat evaporated milk + enough skim milk to make 2 cups of liquid; made roux with 6T butter and 1/2 c flour.  The recipe calls for a 4.5 ounce box of rice mix but I used a 6 ounce box of Near East Long Grain & Wild Rice Mix (original flavor) and it was perfect.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time), I will add 1/2 c finely minced sweet red pepper to the veggies before adding the liquids and chicken.

This is a wonderful soup!!!!!  The only changes I made were that I used 1/2 C flour instead of the 3/4; and I used milk and half & half instead of heavy cream.  For the rice I used Uncle Ben's.  You might have to thin the leftovers with a splash of water or milk the next day.  Everyone loved this!

I've made this recipe several times now and each time I've made a small change and it has always turned out delicious. I made a pot once and ate nothing but this for 3 days. I have used heavy cream and then time substituted lactose free milk or regular milk. It tastes yummy either way. I always add a bit of chopped carrots, garlic, and because I love rice have added about 3/4 extra quick cook white rice. This is one of my regularly cooked dishes. When it's rainy or cold out I crave this. It is so simple and easy. I've cubed the chicken and shredded it. Personally I do like shredding 1 1/2 organic chicken breats the best. It is delicious with freshly baked bread. I highly recommend this dish!

Yes, we had this soup last night and it us by far, THE BEST creamy chicken wild rice soup we have ever eaten. Even my husband raved about how delicious it was. Our daughter prepared this soup and like others she modified it to her liking. She added the carrots, onions, celery and she added 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic, which she sautéed this all in the butter, but only using 1/2 cup instead of 3/4/ cup. To help with less calories, she used 1% milk instead of cream which did not change the creaminess of the soup at all!! Look no further, friends. You will keep this recipe for many meals in the future. BRAVO!! Joanne

This is a very tasty recipe, but maybe a bit too rich for my taste. Per several of the reviews, I'll use milk next time (maybe even 2%). BTW: The only change I made was to add some carrots and celery. Thanks, Stephanie!

Awesome! Added carrots, onions, and celery as suggested in other reviews. Also used reduced sodium broth and 2%	milk in place of the cream to try to healthy it up a little bit. Even with those changes, this was a very thick, creamy soup with loads of flavor. It was a hit!

I made this recipe but instead of chicken I used hamburger, then I substituted something for every other ingredient, it was horrible. Then I made it as recommended and it was awesome, the kids even loved it. Seriously though  folks, if you substitute 75% of the ingredients you are no longer reviewing this recipe. You are reviewing your own :) 

Why not submit the essentially New recipe for others to try? I like to see tips on variations, but at a certain point the recipe isn't anything like the original submission . This is delicious as described.

I made this soup the other day, and my family LOVEEED it!!!! I did however make a few changes to it. 
I couldn't find the rice the recipe asked for, so I just used zatarans wild rice. And than I also sauteed garlic, carrots, celery and onions in the stock pot before adding the chicken and broth. My 5 year old LOVED this soup

I've made this a few times and the first time I added carrots, celery, onion, and garlic per other reviewers' suggestions.  However, after making it again I only added carrots and celery sauteed in a little reduced fat margarine.  I used low fat Half 'n Half but 2% milk works just as well.  It was so much better.  This recipe DOES NOT need onion and definitely doesn't need garlic.  They add flavors that do not mesh well with this recipe and I'm a huge onion and garlic fan.  However the carrots and celery do.  Keep it simple!  Because I love wild rice I usually buy a small box and precook 1/2 cup of it before adding to the broth along with the fast cooking rice.

This isn't my favorite soup recipe at this site (that honor belongs to Lindsay Perejma's minestrone), but it is in the top two or three -- really outstanding. Didn't change a thing, and don't think I need to. My wife and I have soup for lunch just about every day in winter, and we will enjoy this one often.

Really liked this- with a few changes... I sauteed carrots, celery and baby portabella mushrooms with garlic. I used 1% milk instead of cream, only 1/2 cup of flour and cut the butter to about 6 T. With these changes it was great! I think it would be too bland and too thick without the veggies and with the heavier ingredients.

This soup recipe was amazing.  My husband even said it rivaled my best soups I've ever made. I did change the recipe a little.  I used less butter and changed the milk to 1/2 skim and 1/2 the cream called for and it was very thick.  I also added carrott and celery seed, but it was so so good.  Even my 2 five year olds and 2 year old scarfed it down.  Thanks for this awesome recipe Stephanie!

Great! And I even messed up on one thing! I forgot to add the seasoning packet while making the roux so I just tossed it in the whole pot with the roux/cream mixture. Also, did this with fat-free half and half and it was really good, did add a touch of water when reheating but was great with a loaf of homemade sourdough!

Amazing soup!!! I made 12 servings because I had 3 chicken breasts. I also took someone's advice about sauteing onions and garlic to add to the soup. During this step, I also added 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies to the saute and added all of that to the chicken and stock before the "add rice" step. Oh and making 12 servings also fit very well with the Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice fast cook box that I used which was 6.2 ounce size. (I didn't see ANY version of wild rice that was 4.5 ounces). I cut back on the butter a bit using 1 stick (1/2 cup), and since it's what I had, I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream. I was happy to see that adding veggies and reducing fat didn't take away from the soup.

Just as delicious as leftovers too! I froze two quart bags of the soup so I'll update once I know if it freezes well! **UPDATE** Freezes well!!! My daughter loved the soup the first time and after defrosting one of the quart freezer bags to use for her school lunch, she asked me WHAT was that DELICIOUS soup! She forgot she'd enjoyed this amazing soup at the beginning of the school year. Don't be afraid to make a big batch to freeze some of it because it DEFINITELY holds up.

This soup is just amazing.  I've been making it for over a year now and made a few changes to suit our taste.  I saute a small diced onion in the pot with some butter, then add chicken and minced garlic and cook it seasoned with a little pepper and parsley.  Directly after that, without draining, I add 6 cups of water and 2 and 1/2 tsp of better than boullion (or boullion cubes, both work wonderfully in case anyone was wondering).  I bring it all to a boil and then add rice, turn off and cover as directed.  I make the cream-roux as directed except I use half and half (still comes out very rich and creamy).  Add it back to the pot, turn the pot back on and stir, add cayenne pepper (key in my opinion) a dash at a time to taste.  Then I add about a cup of frozen corn, cook at all on medium heat for about 10 mins (MUST cook at least ten mins or it will taste flour-y) and Oh MY!  It is awesome.

I have made this a few times now and use this recipe as my basis for my soup.  I finely chop the chicken.  To the broth I add finely diced garlic and onion as well as celery, fresh frozen peas, coarsely chopped mushrooms and thinly sliced peeled baby carrots.  I use half and half rather than heavy cream.  When "plated" it is garnished with fresh chopped parsely and a minimal amount of finely shredded cheese to show off the colors in the bowl.  A side of heated French Baugett bread is ideal for dipping in the thick, creamy soup.  I don't wait for it to get cold to have this soup.  It is one of my "go to" comfort foods - right up there with my thick and creamy homemade Mac and Cheese!

This was very delicious and would have been as written.  I made it healthier by using 2% milk and made my roux with 5 tablespoons of butter and 5 tablespoons of flour.  It worked perfectly and tasted amazing.  I also did as other reviewers and added 1/2 cup of sliced carrots, 1/2 cups sliced celery, and a clove of garlic.

Such a great recipe! I took the advice of some other reviewers and sauteed onion, carrot and celery in the pot before adding the broth, water and chicken. I also used whole milk in place of cream, and cut back on the butter a bit. It was delicious!!

Amazing! And so easy. I made this exactly as directed and we all loved it. I don't think this would be good as a crock recipe because it gets really thick. It was more like a chowder but really good flavor.

This soup is out of this world fabulous!  I did everything exactly as written, minus about 1/4 c of flour because it didn't need anymore.  Next time, I will try it with milk instead of heavy cream, as my health conscious husband didn't eat it.  Poor guy missed out on a delicious meal!

Prepared as written with the following modifications. I used a large, chopped onion, 2 carrots, chopped, 2 ribs celery, chopped, sauteed in olive oil, that added only 10 minutes. Added 2 chicken breasts, raw, diced, until cooked, then added the broth, rice, etc. Recipe calls for 4 C broth 2 C water, I used 6 C broth. Also used Uncle Bens Original Recipe Wild Rice Mix, so I added 20 minutes to cook time there.All other ingredients/instructions followed exactly.
Amazing results, and I have never even considered a creamed soup in my life! A great winter dish, for sure.

This was wonderful on a Chilly Colorado Winter's Day. My Daughter is really picky and she was hesitant to have this with the cream base...she tried a small spoonful and ended up having 3 bowls throughout the night. My Husband and Son also had 3 bowls...Thank goodness I doubled this wonderful recipe! I used whole milk instead of the cream and it came out just as thick and good.  Great reheated the next day with a little water mixed in prior to re-heating in the microwave for lunches.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Stephanie! Def a keeper.

The recipe was a great start to a hearty soup.  I added onion, fresh garlic, chopped carrots and celery. When the soup was finished I also garnished with fresh parsley. Without the additional ingredients, I think the soup would be pretty bland.

Great soup for cold winter nights!  I sauteed 4 carrots, 1/2 onion, 3 celery stalks, and 2 garlic cloves, then cooked the soup according to the directions.  I had to add more water with the additional veggies (and a few chicken boulon cubes), but it made a more hearty and filling soup.

This soup is absolutely delicious, and so easy to make! I made some of the modifications suggested by other reviews, including using three chicken breasts, increasing the chicken broth to 5 cups, and adding 1/2 cup of sauteed onions and carrots and garlic. I also substituted in almond milk for the heavy cream, and it turned out great. This recipe is definitely a keeper, and I've already emailed it to my mom and sisters.

Ok, let me first say, this is not a Low-Calorie soup.  Secondly, it is delicious! I tried to make it lower in fat, by using lowfat cream, I think I might even use fat free next time. I did add some peas and carrots to this soup. It was easy to make, and is very tasty. I will make this again.

Amazing! Usually I have to half recipes because my husband and I can't finish the leftovers, but I'm glad I cooked this whole pot because we happily ate this every night for three days in a row! It's even better reheated because it gets thicker and creamier. I used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream and I only used about 2 T butter and it was still great, but way healthier. I also used canned chicken to speed up the process. This will become a regular meal throughout the winter!

This is one of my favorite and winning recipes. It is a rich, thick and creamy soup with texture. I will try some of the variations mentioned in the reviews next time.

I followed Brown Sugar Girl's changes to add some more veggies and cut the fat (though with 6 tablespoons of butter left in, this wasn't exactly health food!).  This was very hearty and delicious.  My husband, who is not a soup person, also enjoyed it.  I used store-bought rotisserie chicken, which made the prep that much easier.

To start with this is a good outline recipe, but it really needed some modifications. I used the light and dark meat from a rotisserie chicken. I added 1 cup chopped broccoli, 1/2 cup shredded carrots and 1/3 cup diced onion. Needed a lot more depth of flavor so I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. thyme, and 1/4 tsp. celery salt. After the changes this was fantastic and I would then give 5 stars.

SO GOOD! I used 1% milk and just a dolop of heavy cream and it was delicious.  Sauteed some onion, garlic, celary and carrot and added in with the broth. I will be making this often!

Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! Added thinly sliced carrots, celery, and mushrooms (to increase the veggie count), but followed the recipe 'true' to its form otherwise. Deliberately set aside some of my turkery meat from Thanksgiving to substitute for the chicken and have again as a leftovers meal. Easy to prepare and great on a cold winter night!

This soup was outstanding. I followed the directions almost to a T. I used a rotisserie chicken to avoid having to bake the chicken and used half and half to cut down on some calories. This was so good. It is VERY thick when you reheat it, so make sure you add some water or milk to it to make it soup again! Highly recommended!!

Everyone absolutely loved this soup, including a picky 6-year-old who proclaimed, "I don't like soup!" yet proceeded to eat the entire bowl.  Really easy and tastes fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this soup tonight, and it's one of the better soups I've ever made. I did alter it though, based on taste. In my opinion, it was PERFECT. Started by dicing 1/2 cup of onions, 2 carrots and 2 celery. Sauteed them in 2 TB of butter until soft. Then added 6 cups of chicken broth (didn't use water). Added chicken, then 1 1/2 boxes of the rice (1 wasn't enough in my opinion). Made roux exactly as stated, then added 1/4 cup of white wine to the roux. It was PERFECT. 10 stars!

Like many others, I added onions, celery, and carrots.  I sauteed those for several minutes before adding the flour to make the roux.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream to save a few calories.  I also subbed some of the water with 1% milk.

For my first time making this it turned out pretty good.  I followed the suggetions of others and added carrots, celery, and garlic.  It still tasted a little bland for me ( however, I add salt to everything.)  My next time I'll add more salt and some chicken bullion to add more flavor.  Very easy to make and I'll definitely make this again!

Fantastic! I thought this was a great base recipe; I like mine with lots of veggies. Doubled the recipe and added 3 whole celery stalks, 1 c. carrots, 1 c. mushrooms, 1 onion, and 2 cloves of garlic, all finely chopped, and fried them up ahead of time and added them the last 15 minutes of cooking. Will revisit this again and again-- it was perfect!!

Oh my gosh!  This is so so good and so so easy.  I made this as written and it was to die for!  With that being said the next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will cut the butter back and use half and half or possibly milk instead of heavy cream.  I think I could actually feel my arteries hardening!

LOVED THIS!!  Only did a few things differently to adjust for my family's taste.  Started off with sautee of onion, celery and carrots, then added the broth, etc.  I used 2% milk in stead of heavy cream and cut the butter to 1/4 cup to make slightly healthier.  DELICIOUS.

This was a great hearty soup... I used leeks instead of onion, minced garlic, celery and carrots.  Also used skin milk....still creamy and delish....next time I'm going to try the version with less butter...I'd love to lose a few calories from the recipe :)

Comfort food at it's finest!  Took others suggestions & sautéed onion, celery, mushrooms, & garlic in a little butter until soft and then added the broth & water to that mixture.  Used a 6 oz package of rice as that was all I could find.  The boyfriend has declared that this is officially his 2nd favorite soup (behind the Zuppa Toscana that you can find here on AllRecipes).  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe Stephanie G!!!

Simple recipe, however I made a few modification.  Since I live in Minnesota, I bought my rice straight from the field. I know it takes a bit longer, however it is worth the wait.  I also used a rotisserie chicken from Sam's Club.  Great added flavor and quite a bit simpler.  Lastly, I used a couple of types of mushrooms (standard sliced buttons and sliced/cubed portabella mushrooms from again Sam's Club).  The longer it sits, the more the flavor is enhanced.

My family loves this recipe!  I never have heavy cream on hand so I use milk and/or light cream.  The last few times, I have cut the chicken in half.

This was excellent!  I was scared to make a soup that you have to use flour with because I had never done it before but this was easy peasy and tasted like it came from a restaurant!!

This was exceptional! I followed suggestions from others and sauteed 1/2 cup each of celery, onion & carrots plus 8oz of sliced mushrooms in 2TB of butter, adding the chicken to cook a bit before putting the broth, water & rice in. The rice had the seasonings mixed in, which didn't matter at all.

For the roux, substituting 6 TB of butter, 1/2 cup flour & 1 1/2 cups skim milk was fine.

We're having leftover soup today for lunch! Thanks so much Stephanie!

This recipe was AWESOME!!! I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice, it was perfect! I used 1/2 heavy cream 1/2 2% milk and I sauteed carrots and celery in a little olive oil and about 1 1/2 cloves of garlic and I must say it really does give it that little extra something. I was SO full after eating this and extremely happy!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Excellent recipe as is but next time I will try dressing it up a bit....garlic,carrots,celery. Followed directions to a T and never had the usual lumps in my cream soup. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I added fresh carrots, celery, garlic and onions too and used 1% milk.  Could only find 6.5 oz rice, which was plenty.  It came out wonderful.  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My 6th grader had to make a soup for her reading class (they were reading books on food, cookbooks, cultures) so we made this soup and I was blown away at how it tasted. The day we brought it to school, I actually had kids run up to my car in the parking lot to tell me how they loved the soup and that they had seconds and one pigglywiggly had thirds. I doubled the recipe and used all the meat from one rotisserie chicken to speed things up. I will try the lower fat versions several have suggested when I make it for me.

Wonderful soup! I went with the other reviewers and sauteed onion, chopped carrots, and garlic then added the broth, water, and chicken. I also some peeled and chopped some potatoes and threw those in as well. I used only 6 tbs. butter, cut the flour down to 1/2 cup, and used 1 and 1/2 cups whole milk instead of cream. It turned out perfectly. Will definitely make this again.

Thank you so much Stephanie for this recipe! This one made it into my "must make forever" file!

Notes to users who haven't tried it yet - you can do anything to this or nothing at all - I added sauteed onion/celery/carrots to the chicken/water/rice/broth mix - and since calories/fat are a concern in this house I used light butter and 1/2 and 1/2 and it still tastes very rich and creamy. Made it with buttermilk biscuits and it tasted like a chicken potpie. 

I had a bit of a time with the roux -flour/seasoning mix but I think that was because I used light butter - I just addd a little more. 

Again - a really fantastic cold day/comfort meal!!!

Very good. Unfortunately I don't remember all my changes and adjustments. Did add mushroooms, carrots, celery, 2 eggs and a bit of lemon juice. No heavy cream. Yesterday's rice and rotisserie chicken and then it tasted great.

I love love this recipe!!!  I've been searching high and low for this and found this recipe in an email.  I added carrots and celery in the end when warming everything up and let it sit on warm for a while because I have two small children (3 and 3 months) but it turned out fantastic.  I like the thickness of it when warmed up so I didn't add any milk to it to thin it out.  I also didn't do the cream-I just used 2% lactose free milk and it turned out fantastic.

This soup was so simple to make!  I followed the recipe as written except I added left over corn off the cob and steamed green beans.  I served it in the Italian bread bowls (recipe on Allrecipes.com) with a cesear salad for dinner!

My family loved it.   Very, very flavorful and hearty.

Wonderful soup but also added sauteed carrots, onion, garlic & celery.  Instead of cream, I used 2 cans of evaporated skim milk & it was rich just like cream...a tip from Oprah's ex-chef, Rosie.  I had no time nor desre to mess with chicken or go to market, so I used three cans of Costco (KIRKLAND) boneless chicken breasts & adjusted seasonings to taste.  Served with warm home baked Dill Bread & butter.It was loved by my gal pals.  THANK YOU!!!!

I did make some changes....BUT this is the BEST creamy chicken and rice soup I have EVER had!!!  First, I used the meat from a small savory rotisserie chicken.  I sauteed about a Tablespoon of freshly chopped Rosemary, a small onion (minced), a cup of shredded carrots, a Tablespoon of minced garlic, and 2 stalks of celery (minced) in about 2 Tablespoons of butter until tender, and added it to the stock with the chicken.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.....and served the soup in sourdough bread bowls....sigh, heaven!!!!!

The recipe was very simple.  The only thing I do when I thicken up beef stew, or clam chowder I use instant potatoes instead of flour.  It adds alot of flavor and thickens too.

Very nice soup. Made a few changes though : I never buy rice seasoning. Instead, I did the recipe without that part and then served it with some lemon and vervain salt. And there was no way I was going to put 2 cups of cream and say goodbye to my arteries! I barely put one and it was still very creamy in the end.
I'll keep this recipe as a base to tweak to no end :)

Followed the recipe exactly (except for using 6 cups of broth instead of adding the water and light cream and milk in place of the heavy cream)  came out perfect and everyone loved it.

This is a very good alternative to chicken noodle soup when you are feeling under the weather!!  I used 1/2 cup flour as other reviewers recommended, and it was great plenty.  Put all in crockpot, and cooked on high for about 4 hours, Perfect!!

I am so glad I decided to try making this soup today! It was 12 degrees here this morning!  I read many of the reviews and made the following changes:  I first sauteed a few strips of bacon to flavor the pot then tossed the bacon and added the water, chicken broth and chicken as stated.  I used a rotisserie chicken.  I used the Uncle Ben's Wild and Long Grain Rice, Herb Roasted Chicken flavor. I melted the butter and added onion, celery and mushrooms before adding the flour mixture.  I also added the "healthy splash" of white wine at the end.  FANTASTIC FLAVOR!!!  I agree though that without the added veggies, there is not much to the soup. I will be making this again and probably will add carrots next time along with lots more mushrooms.

I was a bit skeptical about a creamy soup with rice in it but this was wonderful!  The only thing I added was a bay leaf while cooking.  I just love what the taste of bay does to chicken in soups.  As written it is still five stars!

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to Panera's.  This far surpasses it.  Both my boyfriend and I agree that it is way better!

Reminds me of panera bread soup!! Only much better.  We all love it.  I add a little milk the next day and it tastes even better.  One of the best recipes on this site.

My first from scratch soup!  Excellent if you like a thick, creamy soup.  My husband went back for seconds and thirds.  I will make it again.  I used half-and-half instead of cream, 1/2 cup flour, white rice instead of wild and added 1/2 cup shredded carrots and 1 small can of mushrooms.  Used my own chicken stock.

I made this for my 2 girlfriends and they all liked it. One asked for the recipe. Next time I would cut the flour to 1/2 cup because it got too thick when it cooled down, and maybe add some grated carrots, or parsley, or chopped celery just for a little green.

I have made this recipe several times and my husband and son just can't get enough.  The only changes I made was I used uncle bens wild rice in the pouch and can milk in the place of the half and half.

Easy is what I like and this was it.  Taste was great and I will make it again and again.  I did add grated carrots just for a pop of color.  You have to try it.

I did not have pre-cooked chicken so I added 2 breasts straight from the freezer to the broth and water mixture. They poached in the broth and worked fine. I also didn't buy the quick cook rice so added the amount of water called for on the box of rice to the pot. Used half and half instead of heavy cream and only 1/2 cup of flour. (The flour and butter amounts should be the same when you make a roux.) Turned out great! Next time I will make with the extra changes others have suggested.

I could not find the Wild rice/ seasoning in the size package reccomended, so I just went with Rice a roni, and it turned out good, but I made the rice as directed per package and added it in the last step.  I also added carrots, celery, onion and garlic to make a little more hearty.  It was good, but I would like a lower fat/calorie version next time, so I may not use heavy cream.

Yes!  This is great. I poached chicken breasts in enough water to cover.  When done, I used this water in the recipe. I used milk instead of cream for 1 of the cups and will probably try all milk next time. I also saw someone mention curry and I could not resist the idea. It's not a matter of "if" but "when" I'll be making this again.

This recipe is awesome! My family loved it and I'll definitely be making it again. I added sauteed onions, celery and garlic along with carrots and peas. I used only 1/3 cup of flour and about 1 cup of heavy cream. At the end I added a little black pepper and dill to taste. A perfect meal for a cold winter day!

Best soup I've made in a long time! LOVED IT! Couple of things I did that I would highly recommend...add celery, carrot and garlic and add  about 1/2 c. White wine at the very end. I also used a bigger box of wild rice, the generic grocery store (Kroger) brand than what was called for... Like 6 ox I think. Also, def reduce the amount of flour to like 1/3 cup.  Delicious....and even better left over! Definite repeater at our house!!

Panera's version of this soup is my daughter's all-time favorite and she said this tasted nearly identical. I added 1 tsp dried tarragon to the cream sauce as it thickened, and 2 TBLs dry sherry to the completed soup about 5 minutes before serving.  Excellent!

Absolutely Delish!!!!! You will want to lick the bowl clean!!  This recipe did take a little over an hour because I couldn't find quick cooking long grain rice, so I cooked it in the broth and chicken. I couldn't find 4.5 ounze box either. I still went with it anyway and it turned out perfect!!! I added chopped red onion and fresh dill weed.

Wow, this was spectacular!  I also added carrots, onion, and a bit of garlic. Sprinkled a little crumbled bacon in at the end.  Everything else I followed to the letter.  Extremely creamy and filling. I will make again!

This is a fantastic soup recipe!!  I am giving it 5 stars based on how it turned out after making a few changes.  I took several suggestions from other reviewers and added the garlic, onion, celery and carrots.  I also used 6 cups of chicken broth instead of 2 c water and 4 cups broth.  I used the 6.2 oz size of the Uncle Bens fast cook rice (which I thought was a perfect size.  Just the right amount of rice and seasonings)  And last, I decreased the flour to 1/2 cup and it thickened up just fine.  Oh, I forgot ~ I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  This was a wonderful recipe!!  I have two boys (8 and 10) who are very picky and they both LOVED it!  I served this in bread bowls (recipe from this site) and it was perfect!  Definitely worth trying!!

A wonderful and divine soup. I baked an entire chicken and had half left over, so I decided to try out this soup with that. I used a box (4.3 oz) of rice-a-roni wild rice mix.  I also sauteed 1/2 c. or onion and a clove garlic in about 2 tbsp. butter, then added in 1/2 c. of both celery and carrot, thinly sliced, and continued sauteing until soft, around 5 min. or so. I then proceeded with the recipe. I used half-and-half instead of cream... no problems at all with that substitution, and less fat. The veggies add so much flavor and depth to the soup. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!!! A very picky Aspie actually ATE dinner with us instead of snacking on fish sticks.

This soup is simply AMAZING!  I think it tastes just like J. Alexander's chicken rice soup, maybe better!  I make it exactly as the recipe says, and add chopped celery and carrots. A great make-ahead soup that freezes well!  A perfect meal to take to shut-ins, new moms, and etc, along with hard rolls and a dessert.  I also like to serve the soup in bread bowls!

Quite tasty and easy. I lowered the butter to 6TB like others and used 1% milk instead of cream. I also used orzo instead of rice and cooked it in the broth before adding the roux/cream mixture. And since I didn't have the rice seasoning packet I added rosemary, parsley and basil.

You really can't go wrong with a recipe that gets over 800 solid reviews. Easy to make, pretty darned good. My husband was loving this one despite not really being a cream soup kind of guy. I thought it was a bit bland as is (although still good). I think I need to play with it to give it a nice kick but I will try it again.

This review is for the very modified version of the recipe as posted by naples31402. Changes made to the original recipe were that I didn't have a season packet with the wild rice, but rather sauteed maple turkey bacon, a big portabello mushroom, celery, garlic and onion and added it to the soup along with a little bit of dried parsley. I also wanted to add the white wine to bring out the flavors, but all I had was cheap champagne which still worked GREAT. Made this way, it was probably the BEST soup I've ever had. Awesome served with french bread. :)

This was very good. I subbed skim milk for the cream, and it was still thick and creamy. It was very hearty, not quite as soupy as I wanted. Really could almost be eaten with a fork! I had no wild rice so used minute brown rice and my own seasonings (bay leaf, some garlic, onion, parsley). Also added veggies--carrots and celery.

This was a hit with the whole family.  I sauteed carrots and onions before the broth and water were added.  Next time I will sprinkle bacon on top when served.

I made this with leftover rotisseri chicken.  The only thing I did was saute some minced onion  and garlic with the butter and used 2% milk instead of the cream, but then I did add a little cream at the end.  Other than that, followed it to the letter.  It was delicious!  Restaurant quality for sure.

This is a new favorite and tastes just like Panera Bread's version. I did adjust the recipe a little. I used 2 cups of skim milk instead of the heavy cream and also used less butter. I also added carrots, celery and onion and sauteed the veggies with garlic unti they were soft and added them after step 2 in the recipe. Delicious! Leftovers are fantastic - I add water to left overs to thin out the soup a bit.

Been making this for years...a few things that make this recipe easy peasy: saute onion, garlic and carrots in 2T of butter. Add 2 boxes of wild rice with seasoning packet. Follow liquid directions on boxes of rice using chicken broth instead of water. I don't mind using canned chicken in this recipe, so I add 2 10oz cans of chicken with the liquid. Boil it all according to rice directions (I go back and forth between quick cooking and normal rice). Once the time is up, add as much or as little half and half as you want. Don't bother thickening it if you cook it this way as you can control how thick/thin you want it. No extra cooking or mess either. I always end up adding salt and pepper just before serving. I really can't tell the difference cooking it like this. Perhaps even lots of other people figured this out...haven't read the reviews. However, the fam loves it and it's super quick and easy!

This soup was really delicious! I did make a few changes. I didn't have instant rice on hand so I cooked that separate. I didn't need the 2 cups of water since the rice was cooked by itself. I also only used one cup of heavy cream and 1% milk for the other half, only because I didn't have enough cream. It turned out really good. My husband had three bowls and that is unusual for him.

I like this recipe, but I have made a lot of changes.  When I prepared this soup strictly as it's written, it was a little bland and I found it left me wanting, so I've gradually started doctoring it.  I saute up onions, celery, mushrooms, and green peas before I add chicken broth (I use all broth, no water), chicken, and rice.  Also, instead of heavy cream, I use fat free or low-fat milk - the roux will thicken the whole thing, so there's no need to use heavy cream.  Other than that, I use garlic powder and salt/pepper to taste and serve in a sourdough bread bowl (with a dash of Tabasco for the beau)! Yum! And this freezes well if you want to break the leftovers into individual serving sizes when you're in a squeeze!

A fantastic recipe!  I added carrots, onion and garlic with the chicken.  I also added bacon and a splash of white wine when I added the roux to the broth.  Loved it!

If I could, I would give this soup 4.5 stars.  Very tasty and different from soups I usually fix.  I used a 6.2 oz. box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice.  I also decreased the flour to 1/2 cup.  It thickened up fine and was not overly thick.

This one is a bit difficult for me to rate. It is super easy and it is good. However I do think it needs some extra flavor. I really should have read the reviews before I made this but I was in a rush and went off of the star rating. Definitely could use some celery, carrots, onion and garlic. But it is super easy and quick for when you need dinner in a hurry. I will probably make this again but with some tweaks.

We thought this was GREAT! I used rotisserie chicken. I made a few changes to make it a little healthier: 1/4cup of butter and 1/2 cup of flour. Next time we are going to add two packages of rice!! Overall, a wonderful recipe for a freezing day :)

Great soup!  I did follow another reviewer's suggestions:  saute 1/2 cup each chopped onion and carrots, 2 cloves garlic in olive oil.  I added about 1/4 cup extra wild rice and extra chicken and cooked in crock pot.  Also reduced flour to 1/2 cup, butter to 6 T, and used 2 cups 2% milk instead of heavy cream - didn't lose any creaminess at all.

This soup was really good. I did make ours gluten free by eliminating the roux. I added a half onion and celery and a couple of small cloves of garlic and sauteed that in a drizzle of olive oil for about a minute or two. I also added about a tsp of bacon grease and then I added the stock, water, and shredded cooked chicken and let this all simmer together.  Meanwhile, I steamed the rice separately. When the rice was done I added it. I dissolved about 1/4c of corn starch in the milk and added that to the soup and brought it all to a boil and then turned it back down to simmer for 10 mins or so, stirring frequently. Very good! Thanks for sharing!

Took the advice of others.  I started by using 5 cans of chicken broth & 2 c of water.  I added about a 1/4 c diced celery & carrots & 1/2 tsp of Sage to the broth.  Instead of the chicken breasts I added the meat of a hot fully cooked grocery store rotisserie chicken (minus the skin...but I did add the wonderful juices from the bottom of the container).  After bringing to a boil I let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes.    I sauteed 1/2 cup of each (diced: onions, carrots, celery & mushrooms) in about a tbs of garlic butter.  I reduced thr broth to low and added the rice from a 6.2oz box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice Fast Cook and covered for about 5 minutes or so.  Once cooked I added the sauteed veggies to the pot.  I used the same sautee pan with the flavoring on the bottom to make the roux.  I reduced the melted butter to 6 tbs. and added the seasoning packet as instructed. I only used approximately 1/3 c of flour with 1/2 tsp each of salt & pepper.  I used 16oz of half & half instead of the heavy cream so it may not have been as thick as some may prefer, but it was packed with all the flavor.  This was a meal in a bowl.  My husband, who can be extremely picky ate 4...yes FOUR, 4 bowls. It was a huge hit!!!  He loved it.  I would recommend this to everyone.

this is a great, easy soup. i didn't have cream on hand, so i just used 1% milk and it was just fine. we have 3 to feed and we like leftovers and this doesn't make enough for that, so i would double the recipe if you're feeding more than 4. also, i only used about a 1/2 stick of butter and it's still so rich-tasting. i don't think it needed a full stick. i also added sliced carrots. i've made this 2-3 times now and it has a standing place in my rotating recipes. it's such a hearty, delicious soup--especially comforting  in the winter.

Absolutely AWESOME!!!!  Great on a cold evening with a loaf of french bread.  I added some canned carrot slices, sliced mushrooms, and bits of celery & onion.  A big hit in our household of 5 men (and boys).

Thanks for a GREAT soup recipe!  I have made this soup twice now.  First like the recipe and then with the following changes:  I sauted 1/2 cup each onion, carrots, and celery in a little oil until tender.  I used whole milk in place of cream and could not tell a big difference.  Saved on calories.  I used the 6.1 oz box of Uncle Ben's Long  Grain & Wild Rice Fast Cook Butter & Herb and the extra rice in soup was nice.  I also shredded a 13 oz. can of chicken breast meat in place of the chicken breat halves.  Works great.

Absolutely fabulous soup (with changes/additions that I made per several other reviewers' suggestions)!  To keep from dirtying so many pots/pans, I used one big pot to boil 3 seasoned chicken breasts in 2cups water (with 2T.EVOO) for 6-8 min.    Meanwhile, I coarsely chopped 1/2 onion, 2 ribs celery & sliced 3 carrots.  Remove chicken breasts from large pot & dice chicken when cooled (reserving cooking water/broth).    In smaller soup pan, cook 6.2oz. pkg. Uncle Ben's Wild Rice (reserving the seasoning package!) in the water you cooked the chicken breasts in (adds LOTS of flavor!).   Back in the big pot, I sauted the chopped onion, carrot & celery (& some mushrooms) in 2T. EVOO w/ 1t. minced garlic over medium-high heat, until veggies are tender.   Then stir in the seasoning pkg. from the rice until bubbly.  Add 1T. butter at a time & 1T. flour at a time until you have a nice roux, stirring into the veggies (probably only need 3-4 T. of each).  Reduce heat to medium-low & gradually add 2cups 2% Milk & a 14oz.can of chic.broth, stirring until smooth & creamy.  (Optional: add 1/3 cup white wine).  Add chopped chicken & rice to big pot. Simmer for 10 minutes until smooth & rich & heated through.  Wow!!!

Winner, winner, chicken soup dinner! Made this as directed, except I also added carrots, celery and onions, 1/2 C. of each. The whole family (even my annoyingly finnicky 3 year old) ate this up! I served it with biscuits. Definite keeper!

i have tries many chicken wild rice soup recipes and this one is by far the easiest and has the best flavor.  i always use a rotisserie chicken.  it always seen to have a better flavor to the chicken. we always use uncle bens original wild rice ,  i also use all chicken broth no water and it turns out just great.  we always top our with diced scallions and toasted almonds.  thanks for the great recipe.  its a definate keeper.

This tasted really good. I used cajun spiced chicken breasts for a little extra kick. I sauteed 1 cup carrots, 1/2 cup celery, 1/2 an onion, and 3 cloves of garlic for a few minutes, then added the rice for another few minutes before adding the chic broth. I used 1% milk instead of cream and it was still very thick.

Simple and delicious! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it is too rich for my taste if made with the specified amounts of butter & heavy cream. I used 1 tbsp. of butter and substituted 2% milk. Also used regular wild rice (not quick cooking). The soup turned out great! This is an extremely easy recipe, especially with a rotisserie chicken! Thanks for a keeper!

An instant favorite.  We used the onion, carrot, and celery recommendation and also used milk instead of heavy cream.  Everyone who tries it loves it.

This soup is fantastic! I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and it was still so rich and delicious. I did add some sliced mushrooms that I had in the fridge. My husband said "this is the best soup I've ever had"

this was a pretty good soup, given the ingredients we substituted.  we used 2% milk and we didn't have wild rice so instead i used a packet of veggie risotto that was about the same size/weight.  i followed the directions, just substituted that for the wild rice.  my husband would have preferred more rice and a thicker soup (using the heavy cream) but i was happy with the 2% milk.  next time at the store, i'll get a box of wild rice and we'll try it with that.  i'm sure it will be just as tasty.

This is the first soup my whole family liked! (And that is no small feat, there are 8 of us!) Four of us are gluten intolerant, so I found a White and Wild Rice with Seasoning Packet that is gluten free, and used about 3 Tablespoons corn starch in place of the flour and it turned out great. The Seasoning was perfect. And to make it easier I used canned chicken breast. It was a fast and yummy meal. Thanks for the recipe, we'll make it again.

A crowd pleaser for sure!  I substituted the heavy cream for fat free half and half and added a bit of chopped scallions to the broth/water.  Will make again soon!!!

Love this recipe! I cut back on the butter (about 1/4 c.) and use milk instead of cream. Also add carrots, onion and garlic. Delish!

Excellent soup recipe!  I did make some changes though (as it looks like most people did).  The thought of that much butter and cream made me look for some elastic waist pants.  :oP  I used 2 cans of chicken broth with the other ingredients (including Uncle Ben's Fast Cook Wild Rice), omitted the salt (there's enough in there already), and omitted the flour, butter and cream.  I used a can of evaporated milk (PET milk) with about 1/3 cup cornstarch along with a dash of onion powder.  Don't overstir after adding the cornstarch or it will thin out (cornstarch also doesn't freeze well, so use flour in this recipe if you plan on freezing leftovers).  Using the cornstarch and evaporated milk cut WAY down on calories and fat without sacrificing taste.  Next time I may throw some potato flakes in too for added thickness.  All of us enjoyed this recipe - it'll be going in our regular file.  :o)

Pretty good after I added additional salt and pepper.  I think some vegetables like peppers, carrots and celery would help give it more flavor too.

A bowl in comfort in very little time. You can streamline the preparation even more but skipping the roux and adding a can of cream of chicken soup instead, and then adding half and half until it's the desired consistency. Very good! Make a pot of this and put in a crockpot ... good to have on Thanksgiving to serve and hold everyone over before it's time for The Big Dinner.

AWESOME!  Made it exactly as written except for one addition.  For those of you who said this recipe was missing something: try adding about two tablespoons of a powdered chicken bouillon. For me, that gave it that really super extra delicious flavor.  Otherwise, perfect recipe!

Fantastic recipe- I followed other reviewer’s advice and added sautéed carrots, celery and onion in addition to cutting the butter and using skim milk. It's so creamy with skim milk; it really doesn't need the extra fat. I also used the olive oil I sautéed the veggies in to cut the butter down to about 4 TBS. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this soup was too creamy... considering how well it has done with the other reviewers, maybe I made it incorrectly(?), but I felt kind of like I was eating cream with some rice in it...sorry!  I will not make this again.

This was a delicious soup!  I grabbed the wild rice soup packet that was NOT quick cooking and it was fine.  I sauteed chopped onion, carrot, and garlic for a few minutes and then added the broth, water, and chicken (from a roasted chicken purchased at the supermarket).  Once it came to a boil, I added the rice mix and turned the stove to low and covered for 20 minutes.  Then I added the flour mixture.  I used 1% milk and 6 T. butter and 1/2 c. flour and it came out great.  This recipe is versatile.  I tried to use less butter but needed more to mix with the flour.  This was great and I will definately make again!

Great comfort food.  I added carrots and celery.  Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Great for leftover chicken.  Would be super in a bread bowl for company.

This 5* rating is based on the addition of celery (1/2 cup), carrots and peas (1&1/2 cups each).  Without veggies of some sort, to us, this soup was really more like chicken and rice in a LOT of gravy.  With the veggies, it was heaven!

This was a good soup but not one of my favorites.  I thought it would be more flavorful than it was, considering all of the seasonings, broth and cream.  I served it with crusty bread.  Not for those watching sodium or fat, so for me it wasn't worth the calories.  Sorry!

Excellent hearty soup.  Like others suggested, I added garlic, celery, carrots, mushrooms & onions (all chopped in a food processor).  Also used skim milk, and instead of butter/flour substituted a 1/2 of corn starch (mixed into a paste with hot water and then slowly blended in the milk).  It's a keeper!

I have made this multiple times now and each time it has been great. I do like to add chopped onions that I saute in the butter and carrots and celery cooked in the boiling water until crisp tender, then I add the chicken and rice. I have also swappped out the cream with half and half or milk if I don't have it on hand. I do like to thin this soup out a bit with more broth as it is a bit thick for my liking. Really a must try recipe.

I served this at Christmas for about 20 people.  It was very popular with adults and kids.

I started with chopped onions, carrots and celery like previous reviewers.

I also used:

- 1% milk instead of heavy cream.

- Uncle Ben's Whole Grain & Wild Rice, Mushroom Recipe.

- 100% whole wheat flour.

I added additional salt & pepper before serving.

This will definitely be something I make again and again.  It scales beautifully to feed a crowd.

Oh my goodness, this soup was delicious!  I used leftover chicken from a chicken I roasted the night before and added carrots (that I boiled for a bit before adding to the chicken, broth, water, and rice).  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was PERFECT.  Very creamy and tasty. I will be making this every time I have leftover chicken, which is every 2 weeks or so.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

WOW! I was so proud of myself after making this. It was my first time making soup; it was so simple and it turned out delicious. I used 2 cups of half and half instead of the heavy cream and only 1/2 cup of flour. I did cut up carrots, celery, and mushrooms and throw them in. I think that really 'made' the soup. The only thing I would do differently next time is to double the amount of rice,  but we really like rice. Served it with warm French bread and a tossed salad. It was a perfect meal for this snowy night!

Taste-wise, this is probably a 4-star recipe, but because I literally threw it together in 15 minutes, it gets 5. You could make it a true 5-star by using real wild rice (a process, but worth it) and tossing in some muushrooms.

Best soup I have ever made, hands down. I used a rotisserie chicken and 1 or 2% milk instead of cream, I can't remember. But it was delish!!! I only got one bowl. Even my kids liked it. It was very very good. And surprisingly  quick.

This soup is soooo good!! Make sure you dont cook it too long or it will get very very thick! (made that mistake once!)  I also add chopped celery & carrots or else it may be a little boring. So easy & so so good!

I rate this recipe "the best of the best!!!!!"  I am sure that some mushrooms, maybe some diced carrot and celery would have added to the ensemble of flavors, but as far as I'm concerned, it didn't need it.  I have wanted to make this soup for the longest time after having it so many times at Panera Bread.  I am so pleased with my result.  I did double the recipe so we could have some leftovers, but in the end, I loved what I created.  BM2

This is a nice way to use up leftovers.  I used a wild rice mixture without the flavour packet, and I didn't have heavy cream, so I used half & half and it was fine.  For more flavour I started with a mirepoix (sauted onion, carrot and celery), then made the roux.  I also added fresh garlic.  I will make this again.

This recipe is fabulous and I've made this several times.  I do make ajustments like other members have mentioned and it is just delicious.( I try to cut down on fat and calories.)
  I always add the following:
    Carrots, celery and fresh mushrooms( I cook this in the broth, then add the rice.)
I also use a little bit of skim milk instead of cream  and it is still good.  Although I made it for a family gathering and used whole milk and it was even better. I had to give this recipe to several people.
I try not to use as much butter or flour to cut down on calories.
I also use Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice. I love the seasoning.
   I really don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.  Thank you for this recipe.
  Enjoy!

This is our favorite winter soup!  I make it at least several times a month! It's easy enough for a quick weeknight meal and rich enough to serve to company.  A certain keeper!

This is an excellent recipe! I added carrots, corn and celery to give it a little more substance. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream as others have suggested. The soup was everything I hoped it would be! It tasted great, and the consistency was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great. I listened to several of the other reviews and substituted milk for cream. I added sauteed onions, carrots, fresh minced garlic, and sliced mushrooms to mine. I also used homemade chicken broth and both dark and white meat chicken. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was my first time I made cream-based soup and it turned out very well.  I added fresh mushrooms to the soup about 15 minutes before it was done.  The mushrooms were a great addition and this recipe is definitely one of my new favorites.

Really good. Too much broth and not enough rice. I added another box of rice without the seasoning packet. I would also add another chicken breast.

Really delicious!  My whole family enjoyed this.  To get some veggies into all of us, I sauteed some finely chopped celery and carrots and added them in with the broth mixture.  Also, just a few minutes before this was done, I dumped in some frozen corn- maybe 1 1/2 cups or so.  I used 1% milk since it was what I had, and it still made an incredibly thick and creamy soup.  I consider myself a pretty good cook, but this recipe made me look like a pro!

This soup is awesome!  I love the same soup at Schlotzky's, and this recipe is even better!  I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream, and it was still very creamy.  An excellent soup for a cool day!

I took this recipe to a work party and was flooded with recipe request. It was so think with just using 1/2 and 1/2, I can't imagine putting heavy cream in it. It's AWESOME and restaurant quality. A new winter favorite. I'll be taking it to the family party next week.

I've made this soup several times & everyone who tries it....loves it (even my kids!).  I've cooked the chicken while making the soup & added the chicken at the end - same great result & it saved on prep time.  I've cut calories & carbs by using light butter, half & half (instead of heavy cream), and fat free/low carb chicken broth.  Also, regular rice (not quick cook) works fine, just let it cook/simmer a little longer.  While cooking, sometimes the soup gets a little thicker than I prefer - by adding milk, water, or more broth - - still tastes wonderful!   I have passed this recipe on to several people - highly recommend!

I ran home on my lunch break and made this soup with leftover Chicken Marsala(I think the mushrooms and marsala sauce added a nice flavor)!It's DELICIOUS! I wish there was a way to cut down on the fat without sacraficing the creaminess (yah...don't we all) Absolutely the best soup I've ever eaten! For those of you who have made this soup, could you imagine it in a sourdough bread bowl?

Very good as is, but much better to add at least some chopped, softened, carrots and celery-perhaps a small amount of onion and/or garlic, parsley as well. Felt it needed more rice, so add another 1/2-1 box more. Is divine if made with homemade chicken stock!

Excellent recipe.  I've made this a couple of times already and everyone loved it.  my only suggestion is not to add the extra salt as the flavor packet is the rice mix already has enough salt.

Really good as written, but better when incorporating the changes that others have suggested - sauté and add onion, garlic, celery and carrots, eliminate the water and use 5 cups of broth, use milk instead of cream and cut flour back to 1/2 cup. Flavor was good and the soup was satisfying.

This was an excellent recipe to start with. 
As many reviewers suggested, I added carrots, onion and celery.
This was extremely easy and tasted great. 
I served it in homemade bread bowls that I made for the first time, as well.
I will be making this again.
Thanks!

Cover picture is mis-leading as the recipe does not include carrots.
Made this last night for the second time with some home canned chicken breast that we mixed in Montreal Steak Seasoning in several of the jars....and that is what I used.
I also cut up about a cup of carrot "coins" and cooked them in water until they were tender. I also added a large can of mushrooms. I reserved all of the liquid and used for my water.
I added these two ingredients just before I added the roux mixture.
Great winter soup recipe and with my changes a new favorite.
Might add.....was directed to this recipe from our Echo Dot Alexa when I asked her for a canned chicken recipe. ??

Sauted onions, garlic, carrots in a little bacon fat.  Added flour, chicken stock and chicken.  Thickened.  Added 1/2 & 1/2.  Corrected seasonings.  Added a little sherry and rice.  Added tiny peas a minute before serving. Delicious!  We call it chicken pot pie soup.

This soup was phenomenal! But I would HIGHLY recommend doing as other reviewers have suggested, which is to  sauté some onion, celery, garlic, and carrots to place in the soup, and boil a couple of fresh chicken breasts with a little S&P, onion and garlic powder. It’s super quick and easy to do this, and it will give you fresh unprocessed chicken stock for your soup with some extra to freeze for later!

Very good! I used a whole rotisserie chicken and added sautéed onion, celery and carrot to the recipe. The addition of the rice flavor packet made the soup have a nice rich flavor.

This was a really good dish. I made it on a snow day which was perfect for the occassion. I took someone else's advice on the thickness because it looked a bit thick in the  video. So I cut the flour to 1/2 cup and the butter to 6 tbs and that was just right. I substituted milk for the heavy cream and  also took someone else's suggestion and added some carrots, celery, and onion. This is a recipe I will definitely make over and over again.

I saved this recipe so long ago and I finally made it tonight.  It was incredibly good!  My very picky husband was very impressed and said I should bottle it.  I did make some changes that I read from other reviews.  I added carrots, celery, and garlic.  I also substituted skim milk and only used 6 tbls of butter and it was super thick and yummy.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and easy.  Mine was a little thick so I thinned it out with a bit of water, thought I may need to add some chicken granules but I didn't.  I did put a can of mushrooms in mine and really liked it.  Wife wants me to make it again and add peas and carrots, told her it would be like chicken pot pie filling, lol.

I made this soup for out of town guests for the 1st time last year.  It was so yummy I’ve made it multiple times since.  Only thing I change is rather than 2 coups heavy cream I sub 1 cup half and half a and 1 cup whole milk.  I also have added fresh mushroom sautéed in butter and a little Chardonnay.  I usually throw in another 1/3 cup of wine into the soup before serving.  I get rave reviews from everyone!  So good as a reheat too!

This was incredibly rich, hearty and so much better than I could have expected! I took everybody’s advice and sautéed some onion, celery, carrot and garlic and tossed that into the broth/chicken/rice mixture before setting it aside to work on the roux. Seriously, stupid easy, absurdly delicious and way quick!!

this is one of my favorite soups.  the packaged rice mix give is great flavor.  I use half and half instead of the cream and have been known to use just milk.  it's still thick and very flavorful.

This was so delicious that I sent the recipe to my son and daughter-in-law to try. I followed the recipe but may have used more chicken than called for in the recipe so I could use up a leftover.  I did add a couple grated carrots and some thinly sliced celery, mainly for color. I only used chicken broth and no water. I also added a little corn starch mixed with a little water to make it thicker but that doesn’t alter the taste. I also used Uncle Ben’s rice but in a 6oz box because that was all I could find. I also used 2cups of half and half for the heavy cream.  I will be making this again and again. After Thanksgiving I’ll try it using turkey. I bet that will be delicious too. Thanks for this keeper! I loved it!

Saute onion, garlic and carrots in olive oil and used milk instead of heavy cream.  Use rotisserie chicken.

I have been making this for a long time now and it will always remain one of my favorite recipes ever. This soup is delicious. Everyone I have given it to raves about it as well. This is a must try. Super easy make as well! I use rotisserie chicken and it's amazing.

This is an excellent base recipe for soup.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I sautéed a little garlic, onions, celery and carrots to give the soup a bit more body and flavor.  I also used a cup of heavy cream and a cup of skim milk just to lighten it a tad with a half cup of flour.  That worked out fine.  I also used a 7 ounce box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice because I could not find a 4.3 ounce box.  To get shredded chicken, I boiled two chicken breasts in 2 cups of chicken broth for about an hour.  I also added a bay leaf to the broth, and included the broth in the soup when done boiling the chicken.  The flavor was great.  I will definitely make this again.

Oh my goodness this soup is SO delicious. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added diced celery and carrots (it truly would be fine without the veggies, but they really make it a meal), sauteed over medium heat for about 5 minutes with a little butter. I did this first in the stock pot, and then added the broth and chicken on top of the sauteed veggies and let all that come to a boil, that way your broth has some depth when you add the rice, and your veggies have time to cook. I also reduced the flour but I didn't measure it out, I just added until the butter/seasoning mix was no longer taking in the flour, which was significantly less than what was called for. I also used milk instead of cream, turned out just fine! I really loved the flavor, it was satisfying without tasting too salty. The leftovers (which I ate for the next TWO days...) were outstanding, the flavor just gets better with time. Such a great soup, can't wait to make this again on cold winter nights!

I made this and really liked the taste.  I  sautéed some chopped carrots, celery and minced garlic and added it to the soup.  I used half and half  instead of heavy cream and added 1/4 cup of white cooking wine.  I served it with some crusty bread and it was delicious!

Not a fan, not enough rice. The base did not have enough flavor for how unhealthy it is. Plus no vegetables. I actually thought it was bland. I was :'-(

This is my favorite soup. EVER. I make this at least twice a month. It is also my favorite thing to bring to sick friends, friends with new babies, it is that good and yummy and I ALWAYS double the recipe. It is better than a Panera soup. SO GOOD!
I make a few modifications as other reviews have suggested. This is for the original soup measurements. 
First I poach my 2 chicken breasts in 3 cups water, 4 cups chicken broth. (I add more water due to the extra veggies) I add 1 cup diced carrots and 1 cup diced celery to the poaching liquid and I also add salt, pepper and a bay leaf. Once poached I remove the floating chicken fat and bay leaf and then add the rice. Now I have a more flavorful broth. I use Rice A Roni Long Grain and Wild Rice. When making the roux I use half and half. Really doesn't make any flavor difference with the heavy cream. NOTES: don't burn the roux and be sure to let it simmer to thicken - mistakes I have made.
This soup is actually better the next day. I add chicken broth when reheating.

Great recipe! My husband said it was the best soup I've ever made, and I make a lot of soup from scratch! I used homemade stock. The only comment I have is this soup is really thick. I added more liquid to thin it out a bit.

I too started with browning onion, celery, carrots and garlic. Rather than make my roux later and blend, I chose to start my veggies in 6 tablespoons of butter, and after 5 minutes, added my 1/2 cup off flour before adding my 1 1/2 cup of plain wild rice and 4 cups of Better Than Boullion Chicken broth (I am not a fan of packaged seasoned rice), brought it to a boil, than simmer for ~50 minutes. At the end I added 1 cup of half-n-half and 1 cup of skim milk. Seasoned with coasher salt and pepper. It turned out creamy and delicious. Next time I might experiment with herbs like Thyme or Rosemary.

Perfect for a wintery night! My fussy kids said that his recipe is better than restaurant soups. I was lucky to get any at all since they ate so much of it. I took the suggestions to add sauted onions & garlic. I used Near East Long Grain & Wild Rice mix since their spice pack sounded interesting. This recipe is definitely staying in our recipe box.

I made a "healthier" version of this recipe by taking out the salt, replacing the heavy cream with 2% milk, and halving the butter. To make up for the flavors, I added caramelized onions, peas, and sautéd mushrooms, along with dill, lemon pepper, Italian seasoning, and cayenne at the end to give it extra flair.

I sauted onions, garlic, celery, and a slice of left over bacon and then added some carrots to the mix, while the stock and water and chicken were boiling.  Used half and half (because we had it) instead of cream.  Only used 1/2C of flour and 1/4C butter like someone else suggested.  We wished it had a bit more seasoning, so we added Trader Joes' 21 Seasonings at the table in our bowls.  Next time I will add this in to the pot before serving.  My 3 YO and 4 YO loved it too!  This fast, filling dinner with now be in permanent rotation!

Wow, this soup is delicious... but one bowl each knocked my boyfriend and me out for the rest of the day, and we're by no means calorie-counters or health nuts. This is an incredibly heavy soup as written and I strongly suggest taking some low-calorie or lighter alternatives to as many of the ingredients as possible. Unfortunately I think I am now turned off of this soup for good. To finish off the leftovers, we could only eat than half a bowl at a time... Beware!

I didn't have any celery and carrots to add like other reviewers suggested so I actually steamed a bag of mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, peas, and carrots) and added it instead.  It was perfect!

Perfect on a cold night. I too add celery and carrots, but in addition use canned evaporated milk  instead of cream.  Same good taste without the calories.

Yes, super fantastic and just gets better every day.  But I had to start with Mirepoix first.  The celery, carrots and onions and a touch of garlic just make almost everything better.  Very easy.

Great flavor! Super easy! I cut my chicken in small chunks and gave a quick pan fry with cooking spray to cook it. 
Added some celery, onion and carrot to pot to cook with broth. I used whole milk instead of cream. Really great soup! Thanks!

Modified this recipe by sautéing 1 sweet onion, 1 C. chopped baby carrots, 1 C. chopped celery, and 1 small can sliced mushrooms in 2 tbs butter. Added 3-14.5 oz cans chicken broth and 4.5 oz water (to equal 6 cups liquid) and chopped rotisserie chicken. Brought to a boil, then added 1 pkg white & wild rice (NOT fast cook), reduced heat to med-low, and cooked for 20 min. Made roux per recipe, whisked into soup, and cooked an additional 10 min. Added more salt halfway through end cooking. Served with French bread. So good.

Mmmmm, mmmmm good! We just finished enjoying this delicious hardy soup. We went for a late afternoon walk in 30 degree weather and the soup warmed us right up!  Like others, we cut back on the flour, used about 1/4 cup and used half and half.  Sautéed onions, carrots and celery in butter with a dash of garlic powder before adding flour.  Also added a couple of pinches of season salt to suit our tastes.  The soup is definitely a keeper, plan to make it for family visitors during the holidays. Thanks so much for the recipe, yum!

I think this is a good base recipe, but in my opinon there's too much heavy cream and a bit too much flour.  I haven't tried to alter it, but may try some of the alterations others have made.

I made one substitution (half and half for the heavy cream) but did the rest as written.  Tasted it, found it to be too salty so I added more 1/2 & 1/2.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, next time I'll add celery and carrots, use 3/4 of the seasoning packet, and perhaps less flour in the roux since it thickened up A LOT.  And that was with the additional cream I added!  With a few tweaks it'd be even a notch higher than the good soup it is.

Took the advice of other reviewers and added celery, carrots, onion, and garlic. Cooked in a broth for about 45 min with bay leaves before adding the rice and chicken. Used half n half and skim milk to cut down on calories a little. Still good consistency and a hearty meal. Think I would have preferred cubing the chicken instead of shredding but overall a very satisfying meal. Added fresh baked bread on the side for dipping to complete the dish.

This is restaurant quality soup at home!  I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice Fast Cook - comes in 6.2 ozs. pkg. - and used all but just under a 1/4 cup of the rice.  Followed the directions exactly.  Definitely my new favorite soup!

Crazy delicious!!! We went gluten free for some company we had by changing out the flour for corn starch (about 1/4 cup) and keeping everything else the same. Wonderful!!! Flavor (I added pepper to mine at the table) was spot on. Kids loved it, adults asked for the recipe! A keeper!

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it seems to be missing something flavor-wise and I'm not sure if it's the recipe's fault or mine... I used 6.5 cups of homemade chicken stock (omitting the  water), included the veggies as suggested in the other reviews (carrots, celery, onions, garlic), and used 4 tablespoons each of brown rice flour (gluten-free) and butter and about 1.5 cups of half-and-half. I also added an extra 1/3 cup of white rice. Looking at the reviews I'm now wondering whether I picked the wrong prepackaged wild rice mix. I used Near East brand; maybe I should have used Uncle Ben's instead? Anyway, in every other way the soup is perfect: creamy and hearty.

I followed this recipe exactly. The soup is easy to make and the finished product is a thick &hearty. The spices are just right as well. The only thing I might do differently next time would be to add some carrots or celery to introduce a veggie. Otherwise, great recipe!

This is our favorite soup.  My kids love it!  I always just cut up 2 chicken breasts into bite size pieces and brown them in olive oil, S&P.  When that is done I put the chicken in foil and set aside.  I add 2-3 TBSP of butter to the pot and sauté 1 minced onion, 2 garlic cloves(minced), 2 stalks of celery (diced) and 1/3 c. of minced carrots and S&P.  Once softened, I add the flour and mix it until the veges are coated.  I add the chicken stock and about 3 cups of white rice and about 1 tsp of thyme.  Then I add the water & milk (instead of heavy cream-it still comes out thick & creamy!).  Cook until thickened about 10 minutes and then I add the chicken.  The best!

This recipe is very easy and good on a cold day. It was a little bland the first time I made it. I added a packet of onion soup mix to it the second time and that helped. I also used 6 cups of chicken broth.

I really liked this soup - I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added onions, carrots, celery potatoes and some thyme for more depth of flavor. It really is delicious recipe but mine was so thick it could hold up a fork. The family did not care for that part and being that I added so many veggies and an herb that's why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5. If I had the space in the pot I would have kept adding broth to loosen it up but I ran out of room.

This was tasty at the first cup, or just made. However, it was so rich I just could not eat one more cup or bowl, or the leftovers, which I am really dependent on. The rice packet had a lot of sodium. So, I cut the 1/2 tsp of salt to 1/4 tsp. I also mixed up some broth using broth paste to taste to reduce the saltiness further. For the heavy cream I used half and half, as I read in some of the reviews, and for the butter I used butter with olive oil to cut the cholesterol back some. The soup was still very thick with those changes. I see this soup recommended all of the time, so it appears to be popular. I think, I just may prefer soups made more with vegetable purees or a little less heavy.

With the exception of adding carrots, onions and celery, I followed the recipe as written. My 5 year old said that this soup is better than mac n cheese. Enough said.
I will add that I do agree with some reviewers - the soup is very rich. I think next time I will try using half and half instead of heavy cream. Although my husband and 5 yr old daughter absolutely loved as is.

This recipe was AMAZING! I did change a few things though. I used yellow rice instead of wild rice (my husband prefers yellow rice). I also doubled up on the rice. By far one of the easiest recipes to follow with AMAZING results!!

I'm a die hard potato soup fan and rarely try any other creamy soups, but found this recipe and figured I'd give it a shot. OH.MY.GOODNESS! It's DELICIOUS!!! Definitely worthy of making again! The only change I made to the recipe was adding 1/2tsp dill weed to the flour/salt/pepper mix as I love it, and it is perfect! Thanks for the recipe and will absolutely be making again in the future! :)

Oh my gosh!!! My new favorite soup. Plus my family loved it. I did add some carrots; did not have celery or would have added that as well. I also sautéed an onion and added it to the broth/chicken as it cooked. The only other thing I did differently was use all chicken broth and no water. Also, don't freak when you start mixing in the flour. It seemed like waaaaaaay too much but it was not. Delicious!!!  I made enough for leftovers for tomorrow night. :)

You may want to go with half and half over heavy cream.  I did and it was still exceptionally creamy.

This was super tasty!!!  The only change I made was adding 1 1/2 C of chopped New Mexico roasted green chile, and 1 t of garlic powder.  My Husband loved it, and is looking forward to when I make it again.  I did thin it out a bit with milk, since it thickened considerably by the time I put the leftovers in the fridge. This is a keeper!  Thank you  Stephanie G.

This is a perfect freezer meal. I add a 4-oz can of drained, sliced mushrooms, and I make the whole batch (8 servings) and freeze the rest for future meals with a salad and some great bread. Keeper!

The soup was really good, I tweeked a couple of things in it but all together it was yummy. The only compliant I have is when reheating the soup it clumps together and isn't a soup anymore. More like a thick rice side with chicken. Still delicious but isn't soup based anymore.

This is a great recipe.  It tastes like a soup from a deli that I used to love.  I do add whatever veggies I have around like baby carrots or a bag of frozen veggies or peas or whatever.  I usually use half and half because I always have that on hand, as a coffee addict.  It is perfection with a loaf of crusty french bread and a good book and a cat on your lap with a fire in the fireplace.  I only gets cold one day a year here, but that's the day I cook this!

A big hit with the whole family with two minor modifications: 1) used regular whipping cream instead of heavy cream and 2) used two boxes of wild rice for more bulk (which I'm not sure it needed) but it was yummy none-the-less!

Wild rice goes well with creamy chicken soup.  Based on the other reviews, I made following modification similar to the other reviewers: sautéed both 1/2 cup of carrot and celery, 1 cup of onion (make the soup a bit more sweeter), and garlic.  Changed from heavy cream to skim milk, 6 spoon of butter instead of 8, smaller amount of salt & pepper, used Minnesota wild rice.  My version is, I suppose (as I didn't make the original version), sweeter with generous amount of onion, less salty (or milder flavor).  Would go well with salmon & veggie broth, instead of chicken, perhaps.  Had this soup with home made white bread.  Yum!

I made this soup the first time as written and LOVED it!  I have made it several times since and have made a couple of changes and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it still!  The changes I made were to first, use only chicken stock (no water), I also saute about 3/4 of a cup each of onion, carrot and celery (I think those always make a soup better plus I like the color of the carrots!) while the stock and chicken are coming to a boil. Because of the addition of those three items, I did increase the chicken broth by one cup.  This soup no matter how you make it is a sure fire winner!!!

Loved it~ My kids even loved it, and they are not fond of creamy soups! I followed some advice from previous commenters. I used lowfat milk, and did add 1/2 cup of the carrots, onion, and celery which I cooked  ahead, with a little olive oil. I also added one piece of crisp bacon and about a teaspoon of rosemary.  SO GOOD!

I added a few handfuls of chopped celery, carrots and mushrooms as well as a small diced yellow onion to make the soup more hearty and to add a little crunch (add more or less of each veggie according to your preference).  My sister-in-law said it was the best she'd ever had.  I'm from Minnesota, so we know our wild rice soup - and I think I have to agree with my sister-in-law.  It's like a warm, buttery Ritz cracker in your mouth, BUT BETTER!  My brother and sister-in-law have already requested it again (many times, actually) and I plan to make it for them soon as a series of dinners I'll be bringing over to their house now that they're brand new parents!  A TOTAL KEEPER!

This recipe is worth all 5 stars!  I usually make a Cream of Wild Rice Soup with Ham but wanted to try one with chicken.  This is a keeper!!  The only changes I made was to add chopped up carrots, celery and onions and some minced garlic and I added 1% milk instead of heavy cream

Very hearty and filling. My whole family loved it. I cheated and used Rostierrie chicken from the supermarket and it came out perfect. The only change I made was adding one chicken boullion cube- will def make this again. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Maybe a little salty. Don't add salt, there is enough in chicken stock. also used canned chicken, and added a couple celery stalks and carrots.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  When I sauteed the chicken, I added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic for our family's preferences.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing, it is delicious and will be a repeat recipe at my house!

Easy and wonderful taste! I substituted one cup milk for one cup cream. Also used less butter. Still turned out delicious. Was not really a fan of chicken rice soup until I tried this recipe!

We had some delicious Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice soup on a recent visit to Michigan and Minnesota area ... this is just the recipe I was looking for!!! Lucky people who live in "Wild Rice" country! I did sub fat free half and half for the cream but it was still very rich and "creamy" and helped our goal of cutting some fat from the diet :-)

This is our go-to soup recipe.  We love it!  We use Uncle Ben's fast cooking wild rice.  I use milk instead of cream and it still turns out creamy and delicious.  I add sweet frozen corn and whatever vegetables the crowd will eat. Easily doubled. Thanks for a great recipe!!!  :)

I used this recipe trying to recreate soup I had in a restaurant. This was better.  Added the carrots, celery and onion and a little extra cooked rice I had on hand.  I used leftover turkey from another meal.  Good enough for the in-laws.

my good friend loves soup and makes it all the time. I kinda like soup and my youngest with Autism wont eat anything mixed or this consistancy. I thought I would try and make this for my friend. Well, I ended up needing to make it again for my family because we all, including my youngest, loved it!! Thank you for adding another dish our whole family can enjoy without complaining.

I am going to give this 5 stars but I do saute onions, celery and carrot to add to the soup to create a more hearty and substantial meal. I have made this soup many times, and it's at least as good as the chicken and wild rice soup at Panera, which is fabulous. The other modification consistently is using skim milk instead of heavy cream. Since you are using a thickening method anyway, it really doesn't take anything away from this fantastic soup.

My favorite soup ever and this recipe is fantastic.  So quick and easy to make.  I doubled the rice because I like it rice-y.  I added extra water and milk to compensate for the extra rice and was concerned because I only had 1/2 of the butter to make the rue.  It thickened up just fine.  Next time I might add a few carrots.

This soup is GREAT! My 3 young daughters (9, 6, 2)and husband gobbled up the entire pot. Even my picky 6-year-old asked for more, and said I could pack it for lunch in her thermos. This is the kid that has eaten only a PB & J for lunch every day at school. Anyhow, I did a few adjustments as others suggessted.....saute some onion, carrots, celery & garlic in olive oil 1st. Then proceed to follow directions. I also cut back on the butter, used only 4 Tbsp or less. Also used less flour, 1/2 cup. Last alteration was to use milk versus heavy cream. At the very end of the cooking time, I wanted a little thicker consistency so I mixed some flour with water to make a liquidy paste and added it to the soup. I added it on this end of the recipe intead of in the middle to save on adding more butter. I will definitely be making this for years to come, and givng the recipe to others.

YUM!!!  This soup is amazing!  It's very filling and leaves you feeling warm and satisfied.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and sauteed a 1/2 cup of onion, celery and carrot along with 2 cloves of garlic before adding the broth/water/chicken.  I also agree that you can substitute the 2 cups of heavy cream for milk or half&half for a healthier version that is still perfectly rich and creamy.  Now go make it!!! :)

I followed some advise from another reviewers and added celery and carrots. Great soup! The kids raved about this soup! Super easy and had everything on hand to make. I used canned chicken breast and the 2% milk because it was what I had. Takes a little longer than 25 minutes but I am okay with that. Will be adding this to the rotation because the kids asked me to!

This soup is very satisfying on a cold fall or winter evening. I follow the recipe exactly, except I use skim milk in place of the cream.

A wonderfully tasty soup and I have made it many times. A hit with my whole family. Though I make it with 2% milk and cut the butter in half to lessen the calories. I don't think it makes alot of difference in doing so. It is a perfect consistency and flavor. One of my favorite soup recipes now!

I think it was too thick. It was almost like creamed chicken that you would serve over rice instead of soup. Next time I will try to thin it out a little by adjusting the proportions of butter and flour used to make the roux. Maybe I'll even add some carrots and celery for color and taste.

I love this recipe, it is really warming on a cold night and I love semi-homemade recipes. I used a rotisserie chicken already cooked from the grocery store and just broke up the meat I wanted, white and dark meat. I saved the rest, bones and all, to make another soup or stock.

I had my first introduction to Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice soup from Subway in Iowa years ago. I found this recipe hoping it would be as delicious and it did not disappoint. This is a family favorite, even among my picky eater; he asks for it all the time. I definitely recommend this recipe. Enjoy!

This soup was amazing!! All the reviews were right -- this soup was perfect on a nice cold and gray kind of day. Like most others, I added some garlic, celery and carrots for a little flavor, and a little white wine in the chicken broth. I was worried that I didn't have enough liquid after adding all of these things, but once I added the cream mixture, it didn't matter! The soup was actually pretty good without the cream mix, but wow was it good after adding. Went to the bakery for sourdough bread bowls to serve the soup in....it was so good and comforting. Thanks for the great recipe, I will DEF be making this a lot more during the winter.

So yummy! I added the carrots, celery, and onions and used half & half instead of heavy cream as others discussed. I am not an experienced cook and I wasn't sure if my cream-mixture was thick enough and wound up cooking it for about 10 min. When I added it to the broth mixture, it was amazing looking!

I made this and in doing so was wondering where the vegetables were.  The picture shows carrots; so I chopped up some onions, celery and sliced carrots and added them to my boneless chicken breasts which I browned first and this soup was absolutely delicious!!!  I baked jalapeno cheese bread (recipe from allrecipes) and made 3 soup bowls out of part of it.  The soup was wonderful served in the soup bowls.  I love browsing your recipes and use many of them.  Thank you allrecipes.  Oh!  By the way I used 2% milk and couldn't have asked for a creamier soup.  Can't wait to make it again.  The 3 of us devoured it in one meal.

I was skeptical, but it turned out great.  Added celery, carrots, onion.  I used the stock from cooking 3 half chicken breasts, bone in and skin on. I only used 1/2 C. of flour as others had.  We served this at our RV park for Mystery Soup Night.  The only thing left was the pan.

Easy & delicious! Definitely add onions, carrots & celery! I also use the canned chicken breast from that big wholesale store - it saves so much time:)

This was really good. I took some of the other advice and added the veggies. I made the roux with 2% milk. I started with 2 cups of milk to 1/2 cup of flour, and just mixed up additional small batches of milk/flour as needed to thicken the soup. I probably used 5 cups of broth because I knew I was adding the veggies and a whole rotisserie chicken. This was great!

I made a few changes to make this soup very similiar to Paneras.  I added shredded carrots, I doubled the rice a roni to two boxes, but it turned out too salty, so I should have eliminated the salt, but I added a couple cut up potatoes and it is yummy, oh and I also used a can of chicken instead of a breast.

This is the BEST! I make every time. Super easy too! 
The only change I make is I add may more flour to rue (and add a little more butter) and don't add extra water until the end to thin it out -my hubby likes soup on the thicker side.

I didnt necessarily like what I considered to be extra steps to this recipe, so to make it as "one-pot" as possible, I changed things a bit. I almost feel guilty reviewing this recipe, since I deviated from the original steps, but since the majority of the other 1100+ reviewers also switched things up, I figured my review wouldn't be too far off. I also used the 1/2 c onions/carrots/celery combo. I also added spices to my liking: garlic & onion powders, parsley, and a good shake of Tony Chachere's. I imagine a pretty bland soup otherwise! Used Uncle Ben's Mushroom Wild Rice, which was great, however the seasoning packet turned the soup brown! No matter, as the flavor was fantastic! Used 1 c 2%  milk and 1 c half & half. Even making my own roux, I still wanted a heartier soup, so added a cornstarch slurry until it was my desired consistency. Oh, and I also used a whole package of boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I'd pre-cooked/shredded in my crockpot earlier in the day. For my needs, this was a great soup base. I can't wait to make this again!

This is delicious!! My son couldn't stop raving about it. I did not have the instant rice but used the longer cooking version instead. It was just fine.
Thanks! This is now one of our favorites!!

This soup was AMAZING!  My husband prefers creamy soups and this was a home run with him!! I didn't want all the fat and calories from the cream so I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1 1/2 cups fat free milk.  It was still thick and delicious!

Update: 01/2019 - I haven't made this in awhile and this was just as good as I remembered!  So rich & creamy.  I put it together and put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for a few hours before dinnertime.  I do 1/2 cup each of celery, onion, and carrot.  I  might do a little more next time.  I froze the leftovers for lunch soon.

Original review: OUTSTANDING!  Delicious.  I believe previous comments said this was a restaurant quality soup, and I would have to agree.  I also took advice from comments, and added a little carrot, celery and onion.  Also, I used instant wild rice soup, but not the kind w/ the seasoning packet - and it turned out fine.  Very hearty and filling soup.  Served w/ garlic breadsticks.

This soup was absolutely delicious.  It's very hearty and the perfect comfort food for a cold day.  I ended up using cans of chicken breast, but I still mixed them in with the cooked rice and followed the directions otherwise.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for a church dinner and had very little left over for lunch the next day.  I can't believe how easy and good it was.  The only think I did differently was to purchase a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

We LOVED this soup.  I used a little less heavy cream and substituted with half and half and a little bit of 2% milk.  I also sauteed an onion, a couple cloves of garlic, and some sliced mushrooms before adding the rice and chicken stock to cook because we like our soups a little chunky.  It was delicious!!  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! Used instant brown rice and worked perfectly. Used rotisserie cuz. Just had to add a little more flour at the end cuz I like it pretty thick and creamy. Added sauteed onions, garlic powder and poultry seasoning to taste since I didn't use the rice packet it asked for and used instant rice instead. Cut recipe in half, too. Delish!!

This is outstanding!  I followed the recipe exactly other than the fact that I could only find a slightly larger box of the quick cooking rice, so I did not use the entire seasoning packet.  Easy to make and delicious!

So the first time I made this I "slow cooker"-ized it. I also changed the seasonings because I didnt have a box of the rice. It was good, and I knew it would be worth making again. This time I made it EXACTLY as per the recipe, the only exception being I used whole milk instead of cream and I added a shredded carrot. Holy cow it is so much better this way! My 2 year old is gobbling it up as I am typing this. This soup is soooooo creamy, delicious, and incredibly easy to make. This will become one of our winter favorites for sure. Make this and do NOT deviate from the recipe. You will NOT be sorry. P.S. My 2 year old just said "Mommy more?" Yep...if that doesnt say winner I dont know what does.

This was absolutely wonderful and easy to make. I made a couple small changes by sauteeing garlic, and 1/2 C of each:onion, carrots and celery in a bit of Olive oil and then adding it to the broth. I also subsituted 1/2 the cream with skim milk. My family loved it and my husband enjoyed it o much, he asked me to make it again a few days later!

I added half a package of shredded carrots, about 1.5 cups of chopped celery, 2 bay leaves, and half a package of cooked bacon for added flavor. I also used 1 precooked package of wild rice and added my own seasonings - garlic, parsley, thyme...

As written it is a little thick, but still tastes delicious.  When follwing some of the suggestions (adding sauted veggies, lessening flour to 1/2 cup, and milk instead of cream) it is absolutely delicious....definitely 5 stars with the changes!  Update:  I have made this many times by now.  My husband prefers it comepletely without the cream....just chicken broth.  He begs me to make it that way and takes it for lunch all week.  This is a versatile and delicious recipe.

I really like this recipe.  I followed it almost exactly and I was pleasantly suprised.  My changes:  sauted onions, minced garlic (4 garlic cloves), celery and carrots in butter until tender.  Used whole milk instead of heavy cream.  Another note, 2 chicken breasts are definitely needed for this recipe because it makes quite a bit of soup.  Also, don't add the chicken until the very end, i.e. after the soup has cooked for 10 to 15 minutes with the cream/milk roux.  As a final touch, add 1/2-3/4 tsp of salt in addition to the amount listed in the recipe.

Delicious!! And best soup I have made in my opinion. what I did diff. after reading reviews was I sauted carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. also I chopped up raw chicken and sauted it separately (and before the veggies) and seasoned it with poultry seasoning and chachere's seasoning but not too much. and I doubled the recipe bc I was cooking for others and.used 2c heavy cream and 2 cups 2% milk. I LOVE this soup.

Love this! So easy and very delicious! I have made it several times. To reduce the fat, I use 4T butter with 4T flour and 2c skim milk.  Turns out perfect every time. I also add all the veggies I want (onions, carrots, mushrooms, celery) and saute them in 1T Olive Oil until tender before adding the chicken, broth and water. Def. a keeper thank you!

We loved it!  I accidentally purchased half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delicious.  My husband that usually doesn't like creamy soups took leftover for lunch even.

Very good, my favorite soup has always been cream of chicken and rice at the restraunts. I took the advice of the others, and added 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1/2 cup of carrots and white onion and minced garlic in 2 tbsp olive oil. I also added chicken granuals to the broth for extra flavor,And used 1/2 cup white wine, used 1 chopped up already cooked chicken breast, and used orzo instead of.rice, because we didn't have rice, but its the closest thing to it. 

For the cream I used 1/2 cup flour and 6 tbsp butter, added 1 cup fat free half and half, 1 cup skim milk and it still came out thick. 

After adding cream mix to the broth, I added some final touches of few dashes of onion powder, garlic powder and some dries basil. Let.simmer.on.low.heat for a half hour, and put it in the fridge overnight.
It was pretty thick the next day so added some skim milk when I.was.reheating it. 
Excellent!! Even my dad loved it, and he's not a big soup eater. Def will make this way again!!!

I LOVED this soup!! It was so easy! I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, I added garlic and onions and used milk instead of cream. It was delightful! Next time I make it I plan on adding carrots, mushrooms, and maybe some potatoes.

Wow!! I made this last night and my kids LOVED it. My daughter in particular, is a very finicky eater, and not only did she kept telling me over & over how good it was, she said "this is one of the best dinners you've ever made!" This recipe is definitely a keeper. I served it with garlic & herb breadsticks.

My variation was absolutely fabulous. After reading the reviews, I made several revisions to the recipe. I used 3 cans of chicken broth, 2 cups of water (saved from boiling my chicken), 2 c. 1/2 & 1/2, a 6 oz. box of Uncle Ben's Wild and Long rice in original flavor, a cup of chopped celery, 1/2 c. julienned carrots and a small onion, chopped. I also cut up into small chunks a pound of bacon, fried & drained it then used the leftover grease to fry the veggies along with some minced garlic (2 cloves). I drained the veggie mix then followed the directions for the recipe using the variations to parts as listed above. Oh yeah, I only used 1/2 c. of flour too. After I combined everything, I poured about a cup of Chardonnay wine into it. I served it with some cheese bread and even my picky grandchildren ate it. It was delicious!

I doubled the recipe, made homemade chicken stock, used boneless chicken thighs, lactose free 2% milk, and half of the amount of butter , increased the black pepper, and added white pepper, cayenne pepper, 1 onion and 2 chicken bullions. I served it with corn bread. The soup was amazing! My husband and 3 sons loved it. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

I thought this was a good recipe but found the wild rice flavoring packet to be a little overpowering.  I might opt for using only 1/2 a packet next time.

I made this for my family and it was a huge success.  I followed other recommendations and sauteed 1/2 cup of carrots, 1/2 cup celery, 1/2 cup onion before adding broth and water.  I did not use cream but chose 2% milk instead.  Great dinner for a rainy night!

Delicious!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup each carrots, celery, onion, and 2 cloves of garlic.  I also added mushrooms just for personal preference. But a MUST is to add frozen sweetlet peas to the soup right before serving ... they thaw but still stay nice and crunchy!  Adds a nice texture to the soup.  Awesome recipe ... thanks for sharing!

Based on other reviews, I'm in the minority on this one.  2 out of 5 people I served this to thought it was good and worth making again.  I did not care for the flavor nor the consistency of this soup.  I really wanted to like it but could not even finish my small bowl.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Great soup!!  I too added some sauted onions, garlic, carrots and celery.  I didn't have the rice it called for so I used some small pasta that I had on hand.
Certainly a keeper!!

So tasty! Although I did change mine up. Added 1 cup chopped carrots, one cup chopped celery, two garlic cloves minced and 1/2 cup onion,sauted that in some smart balance then added it to the soup. I used 4 cups of chicken stock and 3 cans of chicken broth..used 3/4 of a roasted chicken which I cooked in with the broth for a while before adding the veggies. Then I proceded to make the roux with 1 cup of skim milk, 1 cup of light cream..used Brummel & Brown (3 tablespoons) and the rest regular butter to reduce the fat..WOW the result with the wild rice is incredible THANKS for this very tasty soup.

This soup is awesome! Hubby made this with leftover Roasted chicken. He also pulverized the veggies from the bottom of the roasting pan and added those to the soup and used white rice . Definitely a keeper!

WOW!  Hubby said to give it even more than 5 stars!  This is an excellent recipe.  I boiled 2 chicken breasts and 1 leg quarter with some chopped onions, then about 20 minutes before that was ready, I added about 2 cups each of sliced carrots and celery.  When I removed the chicken to shred and de-bone I strained 6 cups of the liquid off into a measuring bowl and added 4 chicken boullion cubes.  I would have drained off the rest down the sink, or added water as needed but just so happens it was almost exactly 6 cups of liquid!  I poured all that back in the pot with the veggies, added the shredded chicken and rice, then proceeded with the roux.  I left out the salt since I used boullion and I added some white cooking wine (about 1/4 cup) and about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder toward the end of the cooking time.  This is one of the best things I've ever made... It kind of reminds me of the creamy soup you get at the Dixie Stampede dinner theatre!  Simply delicious!

This is the best soup EVER! I've been looking for this recipe ever since I tasted it at a favorite restaurant. Its so easy, too. I used 1 cup of chicken, and 1 cup of left over turkey from Thanksgiving and it came out great, even more flavorful with the turkey, I think.

Simple and easy. I use the long grain wild rice because i only had a package or Knorr Cajun style with red peppers instant mix rice. So i skipped the seasonings part went straight to the rouge and added the rice+seasons in step one Turned into a nice Cajun chicken and rice soup with a little spice from the red peppers. A little more pepper to up the spice, and a dash of rosemary in your personal bowl is a nice sweet touch.

Absoulty delicious, especially the second day! I doubled this recipe, used all homemade turkey stock, leftover turkey, 1 can of no-fat evaporated canned milk, 1 cup of 2% milk and no flour/water roux (it didn't need the additional thickening). This was the best, I will continue to use this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I made it with quick cook rice instead of wild rice. Used half and half instead of heavy cream and only 1/2 cup of flour. I had some left over frozen collards and added them to the mix. It turned out wonderful. Now everyone wants me to make some for our New Years Fellowship. This is one of my favorite recipes.

I made this soup with many of the revisions that others suggested, adding carrots, onion, garlic and celery.  I also used low-fat milk vs. the half and half.  It was delicious and has been added to my regular rotation!

I added celery, mushrooms, onions, garlic and carrots to this soup.  I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup 1% milk.  I used the left over turkey from Christmas dinner - the soup came out very good.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is: I don't think the 1 box of rice was enough - I could hardly tell that it had rice and the second reason - I felt that the flavor was a little bland - even though our turkey was super flavorful.  I will make this recipe again - adding a little more seasonings and a second box of rice.

I'd give it four stars because it wouldn't be as good without the adjustments. I added onion, celery, and carrots, fresh parsley, and mushrooms. I used 2% milk and only 4 table sp of butter and it still came out VERY think and creamy. My wild rice didn't come with a seasoned packet so i used a veggie bouillon. I also used the breast from a rotisserie chicken from the deli. It came out excellent.

Made as written EXCEPT used half and half instead of cream.  Used shredded rotisserie chicken breast.  Fantastic.  Rich, but not overwhelmingly so.  Maybe too rich if had used cream?  Even finicky child loved it!

I followed others instructions adding carrots, celery, onions, a little garlic, decreasing butter to 6T, flour to 1/2c, and using milk instead of heavy cream.  I altered the recipe by using turkey and adding all broth (6c), having boiled the bones of the turkey cooked for Thanksgiving. I changed up the recipe by putting it in the crockpot to cook all day (I did not saute veggies, smelled soo good), I added two cups of water half way through (would have used broth but was frozen).  I find ther seems to be some flavor lacking but cannot put my finger on what it is.

This is the most awesome soup i have ever had. I first tasted chicken and wild rice soup at my bingo hall and decided i needed to learn to make it. I did make a few adjustments. I first cut up celery, carrots , garlic and a small onion and sauteed them in some olive oil then i added the broth but only put as much water for the rice as the package directions stated i also could only find the uncle bens 6.5 oz.. i either use an already roasted chicken from the deli or i get some chicken breast and roast them in the oven. i add more chicken then it calls for and use a mixture of heavy cream and 1% milk. it turns out so thick and creamy its like heaven

I made this soup to go with beer bread and it was wonderful. I changed it just a little because I just tend to do that when I am making any food. I cooked 4 chicken breasts in 6 cups of water to make the chicken broth and then shredded the chicken. As that was boiling I added spices and 1 1/2 cups of rice and let it cook until the rice was done. By this point I had already made the creamy sauce portion and put that in a crockpot on warm while the chicken and rice was finishing. I mixed everything in the crockpot and then went to work. Also Dill is a nice addition to this soup. Very good. Will definetly make again.

Yum! Like everyone else, I added carrots, onion and garlic. I didn't have wild rice, so I used orzo instead. I seasoned with a little chicken boullion, lemon, curry powder, and dried parsley. I used 4 Tbsp. of butter and nonfat milk. I changed the recipe a lot, but it's great to play with! I suggest you try your own adaptations - this fabulous recipe can handle it!

I followed others' suggestions and sauteed some garlic, onion, celery, and carrots before adding the broth.  I didn't use quick-cooking rice, so I prepared it separately and omitted the 2 cups of water from the soup. The end result was pretty good, although next time I think I will add more garlic and just a tad less cream (or perhaps more broth). I generally love creamy recipes, but I thought this was almost too rich.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! A major hit at my house- I'm the soup-lover, the one who'll opt to eat soup on a hot summer day, but my husband who is a titch harder to please absolutely loves this soup. I did make a few changes, however. The recipe calls for 1/2 c butter and 2 c heavy cream. I cut the butter down to 1/4 and use half and half, then use fat free cream of chicken soup to get some of that creaminess back. I also add carrots, onions, and celery to get some rich veggie flavors. This recipe is to die for if you're a soup-enthusiast like me, and  filling, hearty, and comforting for those who have not yet converted. :-) I also served these in warm bread bowls... so yummy!

OMG--I needed a cigarette after this one!  I doubled the recipe the first time I made it; I'm glad I did because it's the only thing either of us wanted to eat for the next two days!  The only variation I made was to add a 1/2 c splash of white wine and a bit more pepper.  I served it with a freshly baked flax & bran loaf (a little crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle)--perfect for dipping in the soup. THIS will be a staple for years to come.

Love, love, love this recipe!  I added the carrots, celery, onion and garlic first.  I used the recommendations for 6 tbls of butter and skim milk.  It was just as creamy and yummy as ever.  Even my teenage boys love it.

Since I modified this quite a bit, this review is based on the following changes:   Used a crock pot - cooked chicken breasts with water and broth for about 3 hours on high until chicken was tender enough to shred. Prepared the cream as directed but used 1/2 cup flour and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 in place of heavy cream.   Sauteed about 1 cup of carrots, 5 stalks celery, 1/2 Spanish onion and 1 1/2 Tbsp crushed garlic in olive oil until vegetables were soft.   Added vegetables and cream mixture. Didn't seem very thick and the pepper was overwhelming so I tamed it by adding about 8oz. reduced fat cream cheese.  Cooked on high for about another hour.  What a nice flavor and SO creamy and rich!  Highly recommend trying this.  Pretty good overall.  Maybe nest time I will try as submitted and not with the crock.

Yum!  I used 1% milk and was still super creamy.  Used $.50 cent/lb hind quarters and made my own broth and used the chicken in the soup.  Thanks!

Great recipe, thick and filling. Made it as is the first time, was able to lighten it up the second time by mixing the flour with a cup of the broth instead of making a roux and adding fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream.  At the end of cooking, I added a tablespoon of whipped butter just to make it a little richer. These changes made the soup a reasonable weight watchers points+ value as calculated on etools. I added a lot of pepper. Would benefit from a little thyme. I like mushrooms, but my family doesn't so I added some to my bowl and let the heat of the soup "cook" the mushrooms. Reheats well in the microwave.

I made this recipe with a few changes due to our family's needs, but it was still VERY good.  We used rice milk instead of cream, margerine instead of butter.  It was still very creamy and yummy.  I took a hint from other comments and added chopped carrots and celery.  I thought it tasted just like Panarea's!

My husband couldn't wait to eat this, he drooled as it was cooking.  Then he made many appreciative noises while slurping it up :p  It was a tad salty, so I would use 1/2 the rice packet and low sodium broth next time.  Thank you!

This recipe never fails to impress.  I took it to a family gathering last night and everyone raved over it.  It's the only thing my 2-year-old would even eat.   I do saute carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in some olive oil.  I also used milk.  I've used both milk and cream and they both seem to taste great, so I just use whichever one I have on hand at the time, and that's usually milk.  I highly recommend this soup!

Delicious soup!  I made my own additions by sautéing minced garlic, diced onion, chopped celery and chopped baby carrots in a couple of tablespoons of butter before following the recipe as written.  The soup does get quite thick and requires milk to thin it when it's reheated.  Great with toasted French bread.  I bake a package of chicken breast tenderloins, drizzled in Italian dressing, at 375 for about 25-30 minutes instead of the 2 chicken breasts.

Absolutely delicious!! I melted the butter in a bowl and combined the mix without using another pan as well. I also toasted some sour dough bread and dipped it in the sauce. Next time I will add sliced almonds. Turned out fantastic and I will be making this again! My 2 year old son loved it too!

I couldn't find the quick-cooking kind, so I just used a 6 oz package of Uncle Ben's. I also added sliced carrots, celery and mushrooms. Very good soup. Just needs a crusty hunk of bread and a cold winter day.

My picky husband even said this is a 5-star soup.  I used fat-free half and half instead of cream. I used regular long grain and wild rice because my store does not carry the instant, so I cooked it longer.  The soup is very hearty and delicious. The third time I made this, I used an entire cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery. It was small, but perfect.

I have never tasted a soup so good!  I had made this a dozen times and can't get enough of it!  To save on calories, I use milk and it thickens just as well.  I have even made this without the chicken and put broccoli and cauliflower in instead!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I've made this recipe many times, and I just love it!  I wanted to add my healthier version though- first, I cook the rice as directed in a medium pan (I use 6 oz. Uncle Ben's).  Then, I melt 1/4 cup butter, whisk in 1/4 cup flour, 2 cups of milk (typically skim), 2 cups chicken broth, salt & pepper, and cook to thicken.  I add the cooked rice & chicken, and heat through.  This is my favorite soup!

I used leftover rice we had in the fridge, so because that meant I didn't have a packet of seasonings, I just added curry, thyme, and extra salt to the flour/spice mixture.  Also, because the rice was already cooked, I first threw in some chopped celery and frozen vegetables, let them cook a while, and then added the rice.  Milk worked just fine instead of cream, too.  I usually don't like to change a recipe so much the first time I make it, but I didn't have time to run to the store first.  It was good even with my changes!

This soup is simply the best. It is perfect the way it is. Sometimes I do use milk if I don't have any cream, and it still tastes amazing. I have been making this recipe for over a year now, and it has become a family favorite. My husband and my entire family calls it the "THE soup," as if there aren't any other kinds. What a hit! Thanks for this recipe.

WOW!!!  This was wonderful! I did follow some of the other suggestions by adding 1/2 cup each of celery, carrots, and onions, which I sautéed with garlic before adding the broth, water and chicken.  I also used only 1/2 cup of flour and 6 Tbsp of butter.  Additionally, I used 2% milk and it was still very creamy.  You know you have a hit when the kids ask for seconds.  Thank you for this recipe!  We will be having this several times in the future.

This is the BEST chicken soup I have ever cooked/tasted......EVER! And it is so simple to make.  I like to add some cauliflower just to add in a different texture.

My favorite soup!  One reason that I love it is that it is versatile.  I add carrots, corn and sometimes even zucchini to this soup.  I don't usually use the flour and butter, reduce the water a little and use milk instead of cream.  I make this so often that I needed to make it a little lighter, but it still tastes great.

MMM....DELISH! This was just what I was looking for. Added some sauteed carrots and onions as others suggested and it was perfect! I even added some mushrooms. I did the cut the amount of butter and cream, and it didn't even affect the flavor. Hubby doesn't normally like creamy soups and he loved it!

My husband and I made this soup a few nights ago and it was fantastic!  I did add a few items to spruce it up though.  I do recommend sauteing some garlic, carrots, onions, and celery.  These items made the soup a little heartier.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and we thought it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this again!

Delish!!! Very very good... I used bone-in chicken breast that I boiled then shredded. I used the water I cooked the chicken in for the broth...  We also added some carrots in.... Very thick and good!!!!!!

How about the 266 calorie/ 9 gr Fat per serving version! :) I substituted Fat Free Half and Half for the heavy cream and Smart Balance instead of butter.  You could not tell the difference it tasted the same as the real recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 cup each of celery, carrots and onion.  I also added a "healthy splash" of white wine during the final simmer :)- so yummy!!  This is such a great dish, next time I'll be adding some green chili's to change it up and see how that tastes.. great recipe and a fav now, I'll be making again and again!  Perfect for a rainy day- its rib sticking good without sticking to your ribs! :) If your skeptical about using the fat free half and half, try it! You won't be disappointed!

We really liked this.  I did follow other reviewers advise and added 1/2 cup each of diced onion, celery & carrot.  I sauted the vegies in just a bit of olive oil in the stock pot before adding the chicken stock etc.  Basically followed the recipe from there.  I did substitute white pepper for the black pepper.  That is just a preference of mine when making cream soups.  Also I did use milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2.

I really enjoyed this soup. It came out creamy and tasty. I added lots of veggies, though - carrots, onions and celery.  My fiance told me that he didn't like the creamy soup base with chicken.. but that's just him :)

Wonderful, quick, and easy. I great alternative to chicken noodle for that leftover chicken or turkey. I added onions this time and will probably add carrots, mushrooms, and a little garlic next time.  I also used 2% milk, instead of the heavy cream.

AWESOME, my son had his wisdom teeth pulled & needed something soft to eat, he is a picky eater & first we got him Panera's soup and he liked it, so instead of paying $4 for a small cup again we made this and he LOVED it so much that we made a second batch. I used whole milk instead of heavy cream and thickened it up a little with some corn starch, it came out very creamy and thick. The second time I used 2 % milk and he couldn't tell the difference so we saved calories and fat once again. This is by far superior to Panera's expensive soup and goes excellent with some fresh bread. Cheap to make and makes a good amount. Also I used canned chicken in place of chicken breasts which is nicely shredded already and has the perfect texture for this type of soup, I just strain and rinse it in a colander. I wouldn't bother with the chicken breast halves since the canned chicken works so well.

I made this soup yesterday and I must say it was very good.  I was looking for a soup that used wild rice and when I saw this recipe,  I was determined to try it.  Per other reviews I made the following changes:  Used all chicken broth, used 5 T. butter, 1/2 cup flour and used milk.  I first sauteed garlic, onion, carrots and mushrooms and added oregano and basil.  I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain Wild Rice.  YUM....

An easy, comforting soup, but it needs some lightening up, a little more flavor and veggies.  I've made this a few times, and I add additional seasonings: oregano, parsley, thyme, and poultry seasoning.  I also add onion, celery, and mushrooms.  Save yourself some calories by using just 5 T butter, 1/2 c. flour, and skim milk...it gets plenty thick.  In fact, the next day, the soup is so thick, that it needs to be thinned with milk.

I made this last night with a hand made loaf of bread. Mmmm! This soup was yummy but I did make some of the recommended changes to lighten it up. I used 2% milk instead of cream, half the butter, half the flour and I sauted 2 cloves of garlic with a whole onion and 2 large carrots chopped up.  My husband raved about it. Took the left overs to work and said he wants this again! Thanks for the recipe

YUMMY. But I did make prior suggested changes to reduce the fat: 5 Tbsp butter (not 8-next time will use 4) and 1c. milk/1c. cream (next time will use all milk) and only 1/2c. flour. Also used 6 oz box of rice, and added 1c. each celery, carrots, onions. Fantastic, everyone loved it, a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

It was just OK. Great as an "I am feeling sick" type soup. Probably won't make again, unless I come down with the flu or something. It was too dull for my husband and I.

I made this yesterday for my daughter who just had oral surgery.  It was a huge hit!  My daughter loved it and the rest of the family did too!  Next time I will double the recipe to enjoy left overs.  I will also use half and half to cut down on calories. This is a simple. comforting soup that I will make over and over.  GREAT Soup!

This recipe was absolutely amazing. I made a few minor changes to kick up the flavor a bit. Instead if the 2 cups water 4 cups chicken broth. I did 7 cups water with 4 tsp of chicken bouillon granules. I added 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 celery, a clove of garlic and cut up about 12 baby carrots being I didn't have any regular sized carrots. I then took a tsp of butter and added my veggies into that sauteeing them for about 10 minutes or until onions were translucent. I added my veggies into the broth and chicken mixture along with  1/2 tsp of crushed rosemary, 1/2 tsp ground thyme and a sprinking of white pepper. The last addition to the recipe I made was a 1/2 cup white cooking wine...YUM!! This dish was amazing and very, very flavorful. I will definitely be making this one again soon.

Holy , this was one of the best soup recipes I've ever had! I used 1/2 cup of white whine instead of one of the cups of broth.  Used half heavy cream and half 1% milk. Added celery, carrots, boiled until tender, then added the rice as directed. Lastly, a rotisserie chicken was DELICIOUS shredded in this soup! YUM!!!

Delicious!  Even the "cream" soup challenged can do this.  Ha Ha.  I did make in the crockpt with sauteed garlic, carrots, onions and celery.  I put chicken breast tenders into the base and about 3 hours on high they were ready to shred.  I then proceeded with the rest of the recipe using Uncle Bens butter and herb rice.  I used a little less flour, less butter and skim milk and it still tasted great.  My husband was skeptical at first but has already requested it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe twice.  I love the flavor of it!  The first time I made it, I let the roux brown just a little, which changed the overall color of the soup.  The second time I made it, I kept careful watch over the roux and did not let it brown.  The result was a beautiful creamy soup.  This recipe will definitely remain in my recipe box and used as a staple, especially during the winter months!

This was quick and easy to make!  I did use all chicken broth instead of the 2 c. water and I added a little more seasoning from another packet (thoroughly mixing b/4 using) that I had left over from another recipe plus a little garlic powder.  I will say that it was a little "floury" tasting so I think that I will divide the flour w/ half being cornstarch next time.  I also used only 1 c. of cream and 1 c. of milk to cut down on the richness.  It was stupendous!

I made this soup the other day, and all I can say is: "wow!" It is so creamy and full of flavor. Next time I make it, I am going to make it the night before. Letting it sit over night makes it thicker, like the consistency of clam chowder. Really great.

This was great! It reminded me a lot of clam chowder, which is one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I could not find the quick cooking rice, so made it seperately and then added it.  Thanks so much.  I will certainly be making this again, not to mention eating left overs for a couple days!

Absolutely delicious soup when following the the tips. I added sauteed onion, garlic, & finely chopped carrot. I used 2% milk, 6 tbsp. of butter & only 1/2 cup of flour. I also added rice as my husband loves rice. Served it with Jo's rosemary bread from this site. Great meal for a cold winter's night! Thanks!

Will definitely make again.  To make healthier, used 1/2 c whole wheat flour instead of white flour and used 4 T of butter.  Also used 1% milk instead of cream and the soup was still thick so added 1 more cup of water the 2nd time I made it.  To help with a little flair added cooking sherry, sauteed onions, garlic and shredded carrots.  Family of 5 loved it and it was all gone in one dinner.

I was trying to recreate a thick restaurant style soup at home.  I have always used leftover chicken.  The directions are great, even for someone who never made a roux.  Serve this with warm bread on a cold night - what fantastic comfort food.

This soup is pretty good overall. I, like other reviewers, made several modifications when making this, though: Instead of using 2 cups of heavy cream, I used only 1; I added carrots, celery, mushrooms, and a few cloves of garlic (although I'll use less garlic in the future); I added about a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese as well. After adding those ingredients, I found the soup to be a tiny bit bland (although wonderfully creamy and rich), so I put several extra grinds of salt in. Good stuff!

Delicious! To make this soup lower in fat and dairy free I made some changes. I used fat free Lactate milk instead of heavy cream and only used 1/4 cup of margarine instead of butter. I also added carrots, celery, onions and garlic. As suggested by other reviewers I reduced the amount of flour to 1/2 cup. After all these changes it was still very taste much lower in fat.

So delicious! I used the full cream version only because I had the cream on hand from xmas baking and was low on milk!  Next time I will try it with milk. I added sauted onions and garlic for flavor.  Excellent!

This soup is excellent. I made it for the first time last night, and to be quite honest, would not change anything.  My 18 month old even ate 3 bowls, and he does not eat well for us!!  This recipe is a staple at our house, for sure!

Very good! I couldn't find the exact size of the box of rice, but I used 3/4 of a box I bought. I added onion, celery, carrots and mushrooms and it made a big difference. It was creamy, tasty and rich. I used 6 Tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup flour and half & half instead of heavy cream. I served this with Harvarti on sourdough grilled cheese sandwiches and salad.

This soup is amazing!!! The only thing I added was a little bit of cajun seasoning and garlic powder to the flour mixture. It was fantastic and will definitely be repeated several times this winter.

This turned out great. I did what a lot of others suggested, though - I sauted some carrots in olive oil, with garlic and chopped onions and added them. Oh, I also opened a can of mushrooms and dumped them in.  But the soup by itself would have been fine. Extra veggies just made it a little yummier.

I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and made this soup exactly as recipe states - it was delicious!  My husband and parents asked why I didn't make a double batch so we could have more leftovers!!  This is one of the best tasting and easiest soups I've ever made.  You will not be disappointed!  This will be a staple in my family forever!

I don't know how anyone could not give this 5 stars, it's perfect and you really can't mess it up.   Didn't have quick cook rice mix so made regular rice mix as directed on package and then added to soup.  Also cut butter amount in half and used milk instead of cream and it was really thick and delicious.  I'm only going to use milk in the future as I think cream would make it way to thick.

Alright, 4 stars as is; 5 stars with everyone's suggestions. I used Uncle Ben's traditional Long  Grain & Wild Rice mix (the one that takes 25 minutes), and just cooked it separately w/out the seasoning packet. Before I combined the broth and chicken, I sauteed some onion, carrots, and garlic. Also, I used 1/2 % milk and 1 cup of Half & Half. It turned out just fine- nice and creamy. I highly recommend this

YUM!!! Man of man this is good. I am pretty picky too. Used reduced sodium chicken broth, Uncle Ben's boxed rice (was a little chewy, next time I will let it simmer a bit before I take it off the heat), addred carrots, celery, and more onions. I accidently put the seasoning packet in with the rice and not the roux. Turned out great though. Will make again and again....Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I made this relatively non-fat and it was still a hit with my picky, picky husband who doesn't like me to try anything "new".  Here's what I did.  I used Rice-a-Roni Long Grain & Wild Rice mix and cooked just the rice as directed on the package.  I mixed the seasoning packet in another pot with 2 T of 50% reduced fat margarine and then the 3/4 cup of seasoned flour.  Of course it was very, very dry but I poured in about 1 cup of chicken broth and that smoothed it out.  I then added about 3 cups of skim milk.  Made for a nice thick "roux".  I aslo used 2 of the Minute Rice Ready to Eat long grain & wild rice packs to make it a bit more ricey since this makes a TON of soup.  All those changes but followed the rest of the directions.  When I tasted it, it was sorely lacking in flavor.  I added some garlic powder, more pepper, and some cajun spice.  This made it more palatable and brought it to a 4.  I don't think my no-fat ingredients were the problem.. I just feel that it needed more umppphhhh.  That's my two cents.

I don't know what the deal is, but I've tried this recipe three times and it just doesn't come out right. There just isn't enough flavor and this time I even added carrots, celery and onion. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, but it's not a winner for my family.

It's very easy to see why this one made it into allrecipes Soup Top 20. Thanks, Stephanie. I did make a few modifications based on what I had on hand so I didn't have to make a trip to the store:  1)used instant rice, 2) used the seasoning packet from a package of Chicken Ramen Noodles, 3) used 1 cup 1% milk and 1 cup cream instead of two cups cream, 4) per another reviewer, sauteed 1/2 cup of diced sweet onion and 1/2 cup diced celery in the butter, before making the roux, and, 5) lightly salted and peppered the chicken. The soup was an amazing restaurant quality. My wife and I both loved it and will definitely make it again.

Yummy! Thank you CrdsGrl for sharing this recipe - and Carrie for her review and a few healthier alternatives.   First, to make it more healthy: sautee garlic, olive oil, 2 sliced celery ribs. Sauteed until softened... Then add sodium free broth, water, dried shitaki mushrooms, rice and chicken (I added a package that I needed to use up [1 1/2 pounds].) In the separate pan, melt 5 Tb. salt-free butter, add the salt/pepper, seasoning packet, 1/2 c. all purpose flour (my kitchen only has gluten-free), 2 cups fat free half and half.   I had 1 Tb cream cheese with minced mushroom from another dish that I needed to use up - which I added. In the future, when making this again - I would add more rice. Happy Cooking everyone!

First of all I always make recipes as given.   With that said, I'm on the fence with this one.  Love the flavor but I had some issues with the flour/milk mixing.    However, it did turn out but the next day when we went for leftovers- it looked like a big blob. I did add some milk with it and it taste great but not sure about this overall.

This recipe gets five stars because, as you can see, different cooks can take it in a variety of directions. I cook the chicken breasts in a slow cooker and use the leftover broth instead of store-bought broth. I also use a Lipton-style chicken-flavored rice packet. I will make this soup again and again.

I thought this was a great soup, easy too!  I used a rotissaire chicken to make it even simplier.  I did take other reviews into consideration and added carrots, celery, onions, garlic and white wine. Again, I thought fantastic, my husband wasnt quite as thrilled, thought just "good".  But then again, he's not a creamy soup kinda person... I will make again, but maybe not as much as a normal soup simply because of husband not being a creamy lover.

Very good!  I did add bacon and used a roasted chicken for ease.  My issue with this is that it is called 'chicken and WILD RICE soup'.  Not 'chicken, long grain, and wild rice soup'.  Point being that those boxed rice mixes have so little wild rice that it almost is silly to even mention it.  This would be a 5 if it were all wild rice.  You would think this would an easy fix however, I think that the seasoning packet from the long grain and wild rice just about made the dish so I wouldn't exactly swap the boxed stuff with wild rice.

This soup was wonderful! I made it vegetarian and substituted potatoes for the chicken. (We used 4 large Idaho potatoes.) We first cooked the wild rice (2 2/3 cups) in 4 cups of water with 2 bouillon cubes in the pot. Later, when cooking the creamy sauce we added more flour and substituted 1/2 of the cream for milk (What we had on hand.) It turned out great!!

This is just heavenly....I did change the recipe a little bit to suit our tastes, but the recipe was a great start. I sauteed garlic, onions and chopped carrots in butter, added the cooked chicken breast and used 6 cups of chicken stock with no water. I made the roux and mixed them together with the rice like the recipe says, and it was delicious. It truly tastes like it was cooked all day. Having a child with food allergies, I was so happy to be able to serve him something so good, and totally safe.   Thank you!

my whole family LOVES this soup, esp. on a cold winters night.  I use a Rotisserie chicken; 2 pkgs of the Uncle Bens Wild Rice - Ready Rice (microwavable pouches; Half & Half and just  a half a stick of butter to reduce the fat !  Be sure not to skip the step of mixing the flour/butter to make the rouxe - takes FOREVER to thicken if you don't !

I thought this was good but I did make changes so it is not an accurate review of the recipe.  I added sauteed mushrooms, onion and bacon to make it comparable to a soup I have had in a restaurant.  Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  I do think that heavy cream can be taken out and subbed with something else - half and half or even whole milk... that is a whole lotta calories when I think the same thing can be achieved with something less rich.  Next time I will do that...good overall though.

I love this recipe!  I do add so veges like carrots and celery to it.  Also I add 2 bullion cubes to the broth to give it an extra kick.  The only bummer is I cant find a rice packet with separate seasoning which is ok

I loved this soup.  I followed the recipe exactally with one exception.  I used leftover rotissery chicken from the night before and added it to the soup instead of preparing my own.  No other variations.  My family loved it.

Incredible recipe!  Rivals Panera's soup!  I added sauteed onion, garlic and carrots.  Cut down butter to 6 tbl and used only 1/4 cup flour.  Also used half and half instead of cream.  Will use less flour and regular milk next time.  Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!!

This soup is delicious!  I made it as written with the exception of adding carrots and celery.  My husband and I both loved it.  I think next time I try using FF half and half as someone suggested to lighten it up a bit.

I am not an experienced cook and this was easy to make and everyone loved it.  I added 1/2 Cup celery and 1/2 carrots, and instead of heavy whipping cream I used 2% milk and it was rich and creamy.

This soup tastes very comparable to Panera's chicken and wild rice soup.  My whole family loved it!  The only changes I made are the following: - I added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder - I added about 2 Tbsp onion - I added 1 1/2 cup of cooked carrots I will be making this again and again!

I cut the butter in half and used 2 percent milk.  Seriously, does anyone need 335 calories from fat in a bowl of soup? It was pretty good otherwise. I added carrots, celery, onion and garlic as suggested by others.  Was a little generic tasting.

This was really delicious!  Far superior then many restaurant varieties.  I used 6 cups of broth, rather than 4 broth-2 water. I also used 4 chicken breasts, that I sauteed with onion and garlic.  I also used milk in place of the cream, to save on some calories. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was amazing...I went along with what people suggested and sautéed carrots, celery and onion at the beginning. Also cut up four raw chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sautéed it with the onion mixture. The rest of the recipe I did as is. This was definitely guest quality soup.

I always look for big numbers and 5 stars.  This recipes caught my eye but all of the changes to the recipe had me bewildered.  I took a little from many of the comments and did this:  sauted carrots, onions, & garlic in olive oil.  Added 6 cups of chicken broth & therefore omitted the water.  Added the rice & chicken & simmered for 10 mins.  Made the roux with 1/4 c butter, season packet, & 1/4 c flour.  Used 2 c whole milk.  Then added it to soup and simmered for another 15 mins.  Turned out great!

Delicious, thick, and creamy! I baked my own boneless chicken breasts with plenty of pepper, basil, and thyme which added plenty good flavor. Used whole milk in lieu of the heavy cream. I didn't use the seasoning packet that came with the rice. Used only 1/2 cup flour and 6 TBSP butter. Sautéed chopped onion, celery, and garlic and added to the soup. I think peas would also be a good addition. Next time I'll need to remember to pick up a nice crusty bread at local bakery. I will certainly make this again.

Loved this soup. I pretty much stuck to the recipe; except I used garlic salt instead of plain salt, and used skimmed milk instead of cream. I will be making this again. So easy to make too. Thanks for this great recipe

A very creamy, delicious soup.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream (I will probably just use milk next time) and it turned out fine.  It probably could have used some "filler" ingredients like carrots and celery (as some have suggested), but tasted fine as it was.  Will definitely make again.

This soup was outstanding.  Perfect on a cold snowy day.  The only downfall is that it's not the healthiest with the cream, I'm going to see if I can try lighten up.  But as-is hands-down the best chicken and wild rice soup I've had.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I also substituted 1% milk for the heavy cream.  I didn’t care for the chicken but I think it had more to do with the fact that I used ice glazed frozen chicken.  That type of chicken has a processed taste and we ended up taking it out.  Next time I’ll omit the chicken all together.

Wow! I should have made this a long time ago. I used low fat milk and it was still fabulous. I can't wait to make this again.

WOW! This was great! A tip for leftover soup-I added more chicken broth to thin out the soup because it becomes real thick sitting in the fridge. It worked out well!!!!

I gave this an Average Rating, or 3 stars, because the flavor was pretty good, but overall not a very good cream of chicken soup recipe.  First, liquid should be added to the roux, never the other way around as this recipe instructs (because lumps occur).  Best would be to boil the stock/water mixture, place in a bowl and put the rice in at that time and cover.  Use the original pan to make the roux, and add the stock back in small amounts to the pan at that time.  You will have much smoother soup.  I added celery, onion and garlic as others did.  I would omit the garlic next time as cream of chicken soup doesn't normally have this.  I also added a tsp of MSG which brings the flavors together well.  UPDATE: I tried this again with the above changes, and I have to say, it was GREAT!

I loved this soup, but my fiance didn't. He thought it was too rich and thick. I agree, but I don't mind, LOL! Anyway, we added carrots, celery and mushrooms. If we make it again, I will omit the flour, or use milk instead of heavy cream.

This was delish! I did make some minor adjustments though: I roasted a turkey earlier this week so i used turkey instead of chicken. I didn't have quick cooking wild rice on hand so i used regular (which was fine but next time i'll use quick cook just to make it faster) also my seasoning packet had an additional grain in it so i just tossed it in the soup instead of making the roux with it. Once I was done my soup was WAAAY too thick so i added 2 cups of warm skim milk to thin it out. Almost forgot-- also added a cup of frozen corn.   Very very yummy recipe which I will definitely be making again but next time I will 1) Use the quick cook rice 2) make less roux, since I think it was too thick (and I like thick soups)3) add more veggies, maybe green beans?  I had a little bit of left overs and it's so thick that I will make a mini pot pie with it tonight.   Definitely a winner for a cold day!

This recipe was spectacular. I prepared this as a main meal for me and my boyfriend and he was shocked because of the restaurant-like flavor. I made some modifications. I didn't have wild quick cooking rice so I used arborio rice. First, I sautee some fresh baby portobello mushrooms then added it to the boiling water and waited some minutes (like ten) for the rice to be cooked. Then followed the recipe as it is established but because I didn't have the seasoning packet I used some basil, parsley and fresh black pepper and salt to my taste.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I had never made soup before (dry mixes don't count!) so I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out, but I needn't have worried, it was great!  I took Carrie's cues and added onion, garlic, celery and carrots to give it a little more body, then cut the butter and flour and used skim milk instead of heavy cream.  For those of you who are counting calories, this cut the recipe to about 230 cal/cup instead of over 300.  Even my husband, who is "anti-soup" loved it and took some of the leftovers for lunch today!  This is definitely going in my recipe box.  Thanks!

I started by making this soup as directed, but then tweaked it after having a tasting bowl. I added celery, carrots, and some parsley and oregano to it. I also added some milk to thin it a bit. The reviewers who say it's better the second day are right! Next time, I will make it ahead. I'm also thinking of trying to modify it for the crockpot.

I just made this soup and had a tiny bowl before dinner to "test" it. It is SO good. I made this especially for my Cream of Chicken and Rice soup-loving husband. I can't believe how good it is! I took one reviewer's tip and just boiled my two chicken breasts in 6 cups of water and used that as my broth/water. I also took the suggestion of adding carrot, celery and onion that I finely chopped in my food processor. I went with the full amount of butter the recipe calls for as well as used heavy cream (I had some leftover from Thanksgiving that I wanted to use up) I decreased the amount of flour to 1/2 cup and also used instant white rice instead of wild (personal preference). It's snowing here today and this is going to be the perfect thing to come home to tonight when we get back in from sledding! Thanks for posting!!

Fabulous!  I modified it slightly.  I sauteed a small onion in with the butter along with 1/2tsp chopped garlic before making the roux. Used 2c. 1% milk instead of cream and a splash of chardonnay and the soup was amazing!!  We scooped it up with Cuban bread...will definitely make again!

This was wonderful and very quick. This is a nice soup to whip up on a cold day. I followed others suggestions and added some carrot, celery, onion, and garlic. Just remember to stir it really well before you spoon it into your bowl because the rice sinks to the bottom. We had hardly any rice with our first couple of bowls, then all rice with our last bowls.

With a few changes it's the best chicken wild rice soup I've ever had!  I add 2 packages of wild rice, instead of the one.  I also throw in chopped celery, carrots and fresh mushrooms (which I saute in garlic and a little bit of olive oil).  This soup freezes beautifully and reheats well on the stove.  It makes a lot of soup!

Yum...That sums this soup up in one word. Did make minor changes though. I sauteed mushrooms, onions, and garlic while the water, stock, and rice were boiling. Made the roux  with half the flour and butter amounts. Added the chicken, onion mixture, and roux all at the same time. Let the mixture thicken to our liking and served in bread bowls. With just the two of us there was plenty leftover, took out enough for lunch and froze the rest so we'll get to have a quick dinner out of this wonderful soup. Thanks!

This was great, I made a few changes, but overall the base recipe is great. I boiled some carrots and added them at the end for some color. Also I just use a rotiserie chicken from the grocery store and just use the breasts and shred them( its much easier and less time consuming).

Wow!  Just made this and love it!  I followed others suggestions by adding carrot and onion.  I first minced the raw chicken breasts and browned them in olive oil, then tossed in 3 shredded carrots and 1/2 minced onion and cooked addtional 2-3 minutes.  Then I added the broth and water and stirred in a box of Uncle Ben's original long grain and wild rice (because I didn't have the quick cook).  Covered the stock pot and let cook for 25 minutes.  Meanwhile I made the roux just as the recipe stated except added 1/2 cup 1% milk in addition to the cream.  Wonderful...YUM!

This is AMAZING!  I used slow cook wild rice and since I didn't have a flavor packet I used thyme, rosemary salt and pepper.

I cooked a yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic before adding the broth and chicken.  I also added a diced large red potato. 

I'll be making this all winter!

This soup came out amazing. I chopped up some carrots, celery, onion and garlic and sauted it in a tiny bit of butter in the pot before adding everything. I used 6c water and 4 chicken boullion cubes, as I was lacking stock/broth, used a box of Rice-a-Roni's Wild Rice and it worked just fine. Next time I may use less flour, or more milk, just to thin it a bit.
Fantastic. :)

To quote my husband "This is the best soup I have ever had". I didn't make it exactly as written... microwaved 4 pieces of bacon until almost crispy, then broke into pieces and finished in the skillet with minced garlic then added the butter. Also used whole milk instead of heavy cream (what I had on hand). Other than that, no changes! Yummy! I wish there was more leftover....

This was very good.  I did make several changes.  I did not use instant rice.  I used the old fashioned boil kind.  I cooked up celery and onions and added to broth.  I also added 1/8 tsp of curry to liven in it up after I added the cream mixture.

Very good!!  My first shot at making homemade soup and it was excellent!  I followed other users reviews and only used 1/2 cup of flour.  Poached the chicken with a bay leave, poultry seasoning and cumin and s&p and used the broth from that for the water.

This is the first recipe I've ever made from this website, and it was delicious! My only tweaks were to add carrots and to use 1% milk instead of heavy cream, and it was still so think and creamy! I loved it and will definitely make it again!

A 4-star recipe that becomes 5-star when you follow some of the suggestions by previous posters: reduce the butter to 6 T., the flour to 6 T., change heavy cream to combination of 1/2 and 1/2 and milk, add a little cooking sherry or white wine to the roux, omit additional salt and pepper (i found the rice seasoning packet more than adequate) ... saute celery, carrots, etc. as desired. All-in-all, a real winter standard in our house!

I agree with the other reviews...very flavorful!!!  I had some creamed chicken leftover, so used that.  It was perfect - already had carrots ,celery, and onion in it.  However, I'm not sure those flavors added that much to the overall outcome.  At any rate, will definitely make this again!

I have never made a soup before and wanted to make chicken and wild rice for two large gatherings I had on the same weekend.  So based on all of the wonderful reviews, I decided to use this recipe and definately was not disappointed.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers such as adding carrots, celery and onion as well as cutting down the amount of flour and butter and I used half and half and 1% milk instead of cream.  In addition, I also did the unthinkable and made 40 servings-worth instead of the 8 the recipe is made for.  While that added extra time to preparation and cooking, I am thrilled to say the soup turned out simply amazing and that everyone who had it loved it and wanted the leftovers and recipe (even those who self-admittedly don't like soup that much).  Thanks for posting this recipe, it's delicious!

This soup was fantastic! I think it's my favorite recipe from here so far.  I did what others suggested and cut down flour to 1/2c.  I also used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half and half...very creamy and good.  OH...and I added a can of corn, 2 stalks celery, mushrooms, carrots, onions and sauted them in butter and garlic before adding liquid.  It was sooo good and my kids loved it.  Thanks for the recipe...I am making this often this winter!

This soup is my all-time favorite.  I use rotisserie chicken and add celery with celery leaves to the broth to give it a little more flavor. I also use 1 cup milk and 1 cup FF half and half to make a little healthier and it's perfect everytime.  I love this soup with the addition of a dash or two of cinnamon when it's complete. Thank you for this recipe!

Yummmy! I will be making this a fall/winter staple for sure!  I made some changes.  I chopped up one large carrot, one celery stalk, one onion, and one clove of garlic and sauteed w 2 tablespoons olive oil til tender.  I then added 2 diced up RAW chiken breasts and sauteed another 5 minutes.  I added the water and a half a cup of raw white rice and simmered for 30 mintues.  I added one bullion cube and only used about half the roux. The rice might have added alot of thickness cause even with just half the roux....it was thick and creamy!!! Next time I will add more carrots and celery and use 1% milk instead of the cream.  Thanks!

This took me a little longer than anticipated. I used Uncle Bens Roasted garlic and olive oil flavored rice- had to cook it first, without packet. I am so glad I did because the flavor was wonderful in this soup!  If you are looking for a healthy soup, this aint it with a stick of butter and cream- but it is sooooo worth it.  Super delicious.

This was good - but it could be better. I followed the recipe exactly. I found it just a touch salty and very thick - both of which I can modify to suit our tastes. The rice was a little chewy - also fixable. 
I think this recipe is easy and tasty, but for next time - and there will be a next time!- I'll modify it just a little.

This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of making- didn't use the preseasoned mix for the rice, but rather a really nice Wild Rice combo found in the health food aisle at the grocery store, and then just some dried spices from my spice rack. A great way to use up leftover chicken from a roasted whole chicken for sure!

This soup was wonderful!  I enjoyed it very much.  The mix of everything was perfect. It also works well using fat free half and half in place of the 2 cups of heavy cream to save some calories.

I just got done making this and it is REALLY good.  I have a recipe that I've always used but thought I would try this.  Super easy to whip up and the flavor is great.  I too added carrots, onion, and garlic.  I also added 2 boxes of rice BUT only 1 of the seasoning packets and added an additional 2 cups of water to compensate for the extra rice.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and added in a can of mushrooms and water chestnuts because that's what we're use to.  I'm really happy I ran across this and will be making it again.

what a great recipe!  I made mine with some left-over smoked chicken, cut up.  I used about 6 TBSP of butter and 1/2 cup flour for my roux.  I also just used 2% milk, no cream or half and half and it was plenty rich and thick.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauteed a little minced onion, garlic and carrot before starting the broth and chicken.  I will make this many more times, yum!

5 stars!!!!! This soup was amazing. I was afraid I hadn't cooked the rice long enough, so I cooked over medium heat for about 15 extra minutes. My whole family raved over it, and Dad said it was the best soup he's ever eaten. (score!)

Great recipe.  I, too, made the lighter version with non-fat milk, reduced the butter & flour & added the fresh vegetables .

Easy & delicious!

I expected this to taste pretty good, but I was "wowed" by this recipe!  I have never made anything like it and I absolutely LOVED it!  My little ones even ate it up.  I found that the second day it was even thicker and tastier!  I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream, cut the butter down by 2 tablespoons, added shredded carrots and to thicken it a little more I added a some cornstarch.  You must give it a try, it's a keeper!

This soup was SOOOO good!!  I followed others' suggestions to add sauteed onion, garlic, carrot and celery which really added to the texture.  I also used just 6 Tbsp of margarine and skim milk for a healthier meal, and it still had plenty of flavor and was quite creamy.  Excellent recipe!

YES, THIS IS 5 STARS AND I MADE IT  FOR THE FIRST TIME TONITE EXACTLY TO THE DIRECTIONS. I  WILL REDUCE THE BUTTER AMOUNT AND THE CREAM IN THE FUTURE AND I FEEL IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE RESULT.

I altered the instructions a bit for a one-pot soup.  I chopped and sauted the chicken with 1/2 of a chopped onion in 1 tbsp. EVOO and set it aside.  Then made the roux using 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup flour, then adding 1 cup milk and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2.  Then added the seasoning, then 6 cups chicken stock in stead of the 4 cups stock and 2 cups water.  When everything was a smooth consistencey, I added the chicken and simmered 20 minutes, b/c that's what the wild rice box stated and my rice was not cooked after the 15 min.  Very good and next time will add a 1/4 cup white wine.

This was really good soup.  I added a second box of Rice a Roni and instead of water used more chicken broth (a total of eight cups of broth if using two boxes, otherwise six cups).  
I added carrots, celery and onion with the butter and sweated them for a few minutes.  I used skim milk which thickened very well with the flour mixture.  I let the soup simmer for an hour or so to let everything marry and then dug into the greatest chicken and wild rice soup I've ever made.

This soup was amazing!! Nice and hearty and perfect for a cold Winter day. I prefer more rice, so I would recommend using two boxes of rice (one seasoning packet) but I did not know that ahead of time so I used some white rice that I had on hand it was good that way too. Hubby loved it. I took it to work to share with my co-workers the next day and rave reviews there as well. Altough, soup gets REALLY thick the next day so prepare to doctor it up before you serve.

Wow, this was amazing, I wasn't sure what the outcome was going to be considering it was simple and had simple ingredients. I also added onion, garlic, and celery as another suggested.  I also used the chicken base in water rather than chicken broth-so I omitted the salt.  I also seasoned the chicken breast with  Montreal Chicken Seasoning from McCormick-very nice! Will make again and will try using with different Wild Rice mix flavors!

We really loved this soup.  It was great the first day, and it was great a couple of days later as left overs.  We will surely be enjoying this soup again!

This soup is absolutely fantastic!  I used leftover turkey, light cream and added some steamed carrots and celery.  I haven't enjoyed a soup this much in a long time, so thanks for the recipe Stephanie!

This is the first time I am posting a review.  I have used alot of the recipes off this web site but i have to say.  This one was the BEST soup from this site hands down.  I made it for Christmas Eve and was a super hit.  Very good.
Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a neighbor and for  convenience used cream soup instead of making the roux and added about a half cup of sour cream at the end. I had a taste and gave my Mom a tiny bowl, and she declared it the best chicken soup ever--now I need to make it for us!

I can't believe how delicious this recipe is! I primarily followed the directions, but like the other reviewers suggested, I sautéed some celery, onions & carrots in the pan before adding the broth. I think this added a little bit of extra flavor to the soup. I also used half & half instead of heavy whipping cream.

This was the perfect recipe for a cold winter night. I highly recommend it to anyone no matter what your cooking ability may be. Its so easy!

My boyfriend is trying to domesticate me so I agreed to try and cook something. This soup was amazing!! My friends couldn't believe that I could make something so good! I did the garlic/onion/celery/carrot thing that other's suggested. Also used half and half instead of cream. I like my vegetables crunchy so I didn't cook them all the way through. Soup was thick so when I make it again tonight Im adding more broth and water. Also used Uncles Ben's Long Grain with Mushroom rice. This soup was incredibly easy to make and tasted like something from a restaurant! If I can make it everyone can!

Very good.  We used milk instead of cream and it was still really thick and rich.  Next time will cut down on the flour and butter also.

Quick easy and wonderful.  I thinned it down alot by adding more broth and milk.  We prefer a little thinner soup. Next time I will cut way down on the butter and flour. The seasoning packet had more than enough salt so will cut the salt out also.

If I could give this soup more than 5 stars I would. In the fall/winter I probably make this soup once or twice a month. It's perfect and so very easy to make. The leftovers are great and it freezes really well! Just add some more milk or cream or broth to make it creamy again. Mmmmmm....

This soup is the best I've had.  Like in the restaurants!  Very easy to make also.  I did change a few things.  I added 4 bouillon cubes and 6 cups of water and boiled the chicken in that.  Removed the chicken and chopped.  Then I sauted celery, onion, garlic and carrots in the butter.  Then added the flour mixture to that to make the roux then added to the rice and bouilion mixture.  Then added the chicken back in.

Yummy!  Use home-made chicken stock for the best flavor.  I also substitute evaporated milk in place of most of the heavy cream to cut the fat a little.  Amazing recipe; is one of my favorites

This soup is sooooo delicious!  It is EXTREMELY thick, so I usually thin it out a little with milk.  The first time I made it I used heavy cream, and the second time I used half-and-half to cut some of the fat, and it tasted exactly the same.  I also used 2 boxes of rice and both seasoning packets because I didn't think there was enough rice with just one box.  This is restaurant-quality soup!

Terrific, terrific soup.  I added carrots, onions, celery and garlic (as other users recommended), but it would have been delicious without those things, too.  The rice seasoning gives it a unique flavor.  One of my family's new favorites!

This soup was fabulous!  I got sourdough bread bowls from Panera and served it inside with some shredded cheddar on top.  Delicious!  :-)

This is excellent and easy to make. I used leftover turkey, half & Half mixed with 1% milk. Meant to add celery and carrots but forgot. Really great and seems like something you'd get in a fancy restaurant! Thanks for the post.

I made a double batch of this for a soup/salad lunch at church. It was the first and only soup to disappear completely. Absolutely delicious! I did use half cream and half milk as others suggested. I'm making it for dinner again tonight (2 nights later. My kids loved it too.

This was the best wild rice soup I have ever eaten!! I sauted some carrots and celery in the pot before the first step, and it added just that much more flavor! I also used two boxes of rice because it seemed to me like that wasn't enough rice, but it turned out a little too thick, so I added some extra chicken broth at the end to make it the thickness that I wanted, Thank you for the delicious recipe!!

This was so good. I threw a whole chicken in the slow cooker the night before, saved the broth, skimmed the fat and used that in the soup. This has got to be one of the best chicken soups that I have ever tasted, and it really is better the next day, although it does need to be thinned out a bit. Very tasty!

Pretty good, tasted like a chicken noodle soup with a heavier texture. But it was a tad too salty for my tastes. Next time I would either cut back on the salt or use low sodium chicken broth.

Delicious!  This recipe needs NO changes at all, although I replaced the heavy cream with half-and-half (that's what I had in the fridge)....not that dramatic.  I could not believe how thick and creamy and good this soup was.  Can't wait to make again, made it last night and it's already gone.

YUM, YUM, YUM! This soup was AWESOME! We bought a roast chicken at Costco and used it all for the soup. This makes a very hearty and delicious meal. We liked all the chicken we used, but will probably add another box of wild rice next time to make up for it. Will definitely make this one of our usuals!

This soup was SO wonderful! I used skim milk, a grocery store rotisserie chicken, and added chopped carrots and celery. Then I ate this incredibly flavorful soup with a toasted sourdough baguette. Will make again and often. The ingredients and prep are super duper easy.

This is an excellent soup, it did take a little longer to make than it said but it was worth the wait. I did use skim milk instead of the heavy cream and I don't think it made much of a difference because it was still very thick and creamy, so thank you to the one who suggested that.
I will be making this again soon.

I made this soup with skim milk and it was still very rich and creamy. So, for those watching fat and calories, skim milk is a good substitute for the heavy cream.

Great soup!  I did make a few changes.  I browned 1 large chicken breast half in a small amount of oil, then seasoned with sea salt and freshly ground pepper.  I added 1/2c chicken broth to skillet with chicken, covered pan and simmered chicken till done.  Meanwhile, I sauteed some onion, celery and carrot (all finely chopped) in 2-3T butter till almost soft and then added 1/2c chicken broth from chicken breast and simmered till real soft.  I also decreased flour (too thick) and used half and half instead of cream (milk would be fine too).

This was really good.  I sauteed onion, carrots, and celery before adding the liquid.  I also used 1% milk instead of heavy cream and thought the thickness was perfect.  I really liked the method used to make this soup.  Next time I will also add potatoes.

I have tried a few of the chicken and rice soup recipes on this site and this is by far the best as is.  It is also a very flexible recipe as well.  Want to add in celery and carrots?  Go ahead!  Don't have heavy cream?  Use milk!  It will still come out great.  Don't have the quick cooking rice and seasoning packet?  Use the rice you have, if needed cook a bit longer, and add in tons of poultry seasoning and whatever other seasoning you want.  It probably won't be as good as the original recipe (at least it wasn't for me) but it is still very good.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have an instant wild rice box mix, but a regular wild rice blend from a health food store, so I had to cook that longer.  But I wasn't sure what to use to flavor the roux... the chicken-flavored ramen seasoning worked fabulously!  I did everything else as called, and the soup was gone in 2 days.  Excellent!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe!  Total comfort food and so filling.  I think my little son and I ate half of it in one sitting.  I was surprised he at it with the rice in it.  I followed the recipe, except used one cup of milk and one cup of fat free half and half(because that's what I had).  Also, I didn't use chicken broth, just simmered the chicken breasts and used that broth with a little buillion.  Thanks Stephanie!  We will make this again!

I have made this recipe 3 times now and we love it! I use a box of traditional Uncle Ben's wild rice that simmers for 25 min and to the rice and broth mixture I add onion, celery and carrots to make it a more hearty soup. Then I use leftover chicken or I boil chicken separately and add it to the soup when I add the roux. I use regular 1 or 2% milk...the cream is too rich for us. Fast, easy and fool-proof. Will make over and over again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really rich but very tasty.  I added a tiny bit of carrot for color.  The chicken stock you use makes a huge difference in the salt level of the finished product so be sparing until after you've added the seasoning roux.  I thought this was a nice change of pace from standard chicken noodle.

Delicious! I brought 5 boneless chicken breasts to a simmer in chicken broth, and then covered the pot and turned off the heat.  I used Near East Long Grain and wild rice pilaf.  I cooked it 20 minutes in the broth/water mixture and then continued with the recipe, adding the moist, perfectly cooked chicken at the very end.  I didn't use all the roux, and I think it would have been too thick if I had.

This soup really is fantastic!  I used leftover chicken my husband had grilled & I added about 4 chopped carrots to mine at the very end & simmered the soup 'til they were cooked through.  VERY delicious.  I'm going to add fresh mushrooms at the very end next time as well, and probably another box of rice- I like my soups with more rice.

This is good stuff! We used the rotisserie chicken and Uncle Ben's rice, so it was relatively easy to make; the only time-consuming part is making the roux. To make it even better, we added a handful of fresh mushrooms and would definitely add those again - just added to the great flavor. The recipe is extremely rich though - almost like a thick stew. We'd make this one again on a chilly day.

Awesome recipe!  Very flavorful.  I used 2 cans of fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream for a lower fat version.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it for a soup buffet, and the guests could not get enough of it!  They barely touched the other soups and went straight for this one.  I did use the rotisserie chicken, which made it very easy and very tasty!  I had to make multiple copies of the recipe, and I will definitely make this one again!  THanks for the great recipe!

If you love really creamy soups, this is the one for you! Usually I am disappointed with a "creamy" soup because it's too watery.  Not this time! I couldn't find any wild rice with the seasoning packet separate, but it turned out perfect anyway!  Definitely perfect comfort food for that cold winter day!

I loved this soup!
I made it last night for dinner, and both my husband and I really liked.
It was very easy, and tasty. I will definitely be making it again, and again.
It's a perfect winter soup.
I made a wheat beer bread to go with it, which I got from this site also!!

It was ok, we ate a bowl, but the leftovers didn't get eaten, threw it out. Maybe too much rice. Would've liked it better if it were more like soup.

Absolutely delicious! As recommended by Carrie’s review....I Added sautéed celery and onions and garlic. Used 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups skim milk for a healthier version. Was plenty creamy and thick. Will make many times again.

I give this 5 stars for taste but only 1 star for looks. I made exactly written and then still had to add 2 cups extra broth and could hardly stir it due to it being SO thick. flavor was amazing though!

I made this soup using some of the  additional ingredients suggested by others:  diced carrots, celery and one shallot I had on hand (I didn't have any onions).  I also left out the additional 1/2 tsp of salt in the roux and substituted 1 cup of 1% milk for 1 cup of the heavy cream.   I used a regular (not quick-cooking) white and wild rice mix (8 oz. size) that had the seasoning in the mix, not in a separate packet.  I increased the water to 3 cups to be sure there would be enough liquid.  Next time I think I may use all chicken broth for the liquid.  My husband thought it was delicious.  I thought it was a little bland.  We had enough left over to freeze for another  meal.  All in all, I would definitely make this again.  I think I just need to tweak it a little more for my taste.

I made this in the crock pot, per one reviewer's advice. Turned out wonderful. However, we are big soup eaters, so this only made four large bowls of soup for us. I did saute onion/carrot/celery first, although the veggies were plenty soft when eaten, so probably not necessary; next time will just add them raw. Used half/half rather than cream or milk. Just what I had that needed to be used. I think milk will work just as well. Used cornstarch rather than flour to thicken, as my hubby is on keto. Also per another reviewer, threw in a bay leaf, 1 tsp of sage, and 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.

This is a delicious and hearty recipe.  The only thing I did different was that I added some minced garlic, celery, onion and carrots.  Because I didn’t want a super thick soup, I also added less flour—used 3Tbsp only.  As a first timer, this is super easy to follow and everyone raved about it.

This is very similar to the one I make. I don’t use flour and cream. Instead I melt cream cheese into it add little bits at a time until the look and taste is right.

This is a great soup so thank you for sharing.  Used bulk wild rice medley (3 cooked cups), so reduced water by 2 cups and used Penzey’s Justice seasoning (1.5 tablespoons)  instead of a seasoning packet. Also added an 8 oz package Of fresh mushrooms to the boiling broth and reduced flour by about half.

This recipe is SUPER GOOD, just needs a few moderations to make it even better. 1) I boiled 2 large chicken breasts. I didn't want to throw away the water from this and thought it would give the soup a bit more flavor than plain water called for, so I used it up in the soup  2) I sauteed onion and carrots for a bit more flavor and added to soup. 3) I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 olive oil to make the roux and to make it a bit healthier 4) I used 1/2 cup half and half milk and 1 1/2 cups 1% milk to cut back on fat. 5) the biggest change that added tons more flavor was using white pepper instead of black and adding about 1/4 teaspoon or so of celery seeds. Served with crispy french bread. Delicious!

The recipe "rocks".  I used half 'n half instead of heavy cream.  It was plenty heavy enough!  I also added chopped kale . . . just b'cause I could.  Wife loved it!!

This soup is very rich and creamy. I did reduce the butter and flour to 6 tablespoons each but otherwise followed the recipe. Oh wait sorry I added the diced meat of a whole chicken. Really awesome. Definitely going into the rotation.

I used a deli rotisserie chicken to save time and doubled the amount of chicken broth.  I also added sliced Portobello mushrooms when I added the cream mixture to the soup.  I served with warm crusty French bread.  It was so delicious!  I will definitely make this again and again!

We’re seniors so I should watch our fat intake so substituted half and half for heavy cream. It still came out hearty. Also added a celery stalk. Delicious on a winter night.

This is my favorite soup recipe.  I too sauté carrot, celery, and onion before adding the broth/chicken.  3/4 flour is too much and make the soup too thick. Try 1/2 C.  I use gf flour because my son has celiac, so maybe that is the problem? Either way you don't have to use all of the flour because it will also thicken even more the next day.

Made as directed, it’s very thick -  mounds up  in the bowl. Sort of a cross between a casserole and soup. To make it more soup like, use 4 tablespoons flour, 4 tablespoons butter for the two cups of half and half. We quite liked it thick and I will definitely make it again.

I made this soup last night, and in all honesty, this was the 1st time I attempted a creamy soup. It turned out excellent. Absolutely perfect. The only difference from the recipe was the chicken prep. I diced up 2 chicken breasts and seasoned with a Tuscan Blend, fried in a pan and followed the rest of the recipe.  I highly recommend!

Excellent soup.  I sautéed onion, carrots, celery, and mushrooms; added this to the broth.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  This is now one of my favorite soups.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I was able to follow it substituting ingredients for dietary restrictions.  And it was amazing. My son cant have wheat or dairy.  So I used pillsbury gluten free all purpose flour, Almond milk, and smart balance "butter". It was so delicious we all loved it. I did add a bag of frozen peas and carrots to the stock before I began boiling. I will definitely make this again

I had such high hopes for this recipe, but sadly, I was overwhelmed by the butter. I may try this again using less. It was rich beyond the butter, but by how much, I cannot tell. If I try this soup again, I may use half & half instead of the heavy cream. As best I can tell, the flavor was alright - just far too buttery for our tastes. I might also add some finely diced carrot next time; a little veggies might be good, and it'll certainly add to the color. I do think this is probably a good soup, other than our 'butter problem'. Actually, I probably *will* try this soup again. Thanks, Stephanie G!!

So good! It’s creamy, tasty, and easy to make. Our family loves rice so I use 3 boxes and if it comes out too thick I use chicken broth and/or whatever milk (usually 1%) is in the refrigerator.

Made this tonight and it came out great. Five stars after listening to reviews and adding onion, carrots, and celery. I will add mushrooms next time. It came out super thick and I added an extra 1/2c broth. I could only find uncle bens long grain and wild rice that had the season packet but still took 20 min to cook it. It was a 6oz box and I used it all. I never made a roux before so my husband helped and I learned something new! It makes a lot of soup so I’ll be freezing the rest to enjoy another time.

I love this soup and have been making it for years! Unfortunately they don't make the Uncle Ben's chicken and wild rice mix that has the separate seasoning packet anymore. I haven't been able to find something comparable. What is everyone else using?

Drooling thinking about this soup..  Added some veggies and garlic like other reviewers said (onion, carrot, celery), only used maybe 1/3c of the flour mixture, and kept the rest of it all the same. SOOO Good, husband said it was one of the top meals he has ever had lol

Super easy and delicious.  I only used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup milk.  Added water as needed while waiting to eat and still tasted creamy.  I will add some mushrooms the next time I make it.

This has been become a family favorite - getting three picky kids to agree is feat! I’ve made it plenty of times as is and it’s yummy. Over the years, I’ve modified a few things. I never have cooked chicken ready, so I’ve started poaching the chicken with chopped carrots, celery and onions for 10-15 min. Then shred and dump back in the “broth” (which is more than the 2 cups water listed, usually about four). This adds a bit more depth to the soup. I then add bone broth and follow directions as listed. Milk or half & half is fine if you don’t have/want cream.

This soup is really tasty. I have a husband, a 10 yr old, 8yr old & a 4 yr old, and they all loved it. I added 3/4 c of sliced carrots. I served it with cornbread. I will be making this again & again.

Very easy recipe to follow, but like many others I too added carrots, celery and onions. Also the 1/2 cup of butter, needs to be cut down to 6 tablespoons, and the flour down to 1/2 cup for the roux.  Other then that, it was a Definite keeper I’ll make this again or sure.

In a word, yum! This was delicious. In Canada, I couldn't find the rice packets mentioned.  I bought an Uncle Ben's "Fast and Fancy" rice side dish package since it has a seasoning packet with it. That worked nicely for me in this recipe. (Homestyle Chicken and Wild Rice flavour)

I made no changes to the recipe,. My soup did not come out white and creamy; more tan and broth-y. Further, all the rice fell out of suspension and burned on the bottom of the pot. I am now making a second batch of wild rice to add to the soup. Not sure I'll try this one again.

Our Publix chain of grocery stores sells in their deli a chicken and wild rice soup that I love.  I was looking for something that I could make myself thus not having to buy theirs.  Well I found it!!  This is even better!!  Here are the changes I made.  I cut the recipe in half since during summer months I usually don't eat as much soup.  I used "Uncle Bens Long grain rice quick cook".  I cooked about 1/4 cup each of chopped fine onion, celery and carrots with the melting butter and spices from Uncle Ben.  I used lowfat milk instead of heavy cream.  I used 1/2 the breast leftovers from a rotisserie chicken.  I boiled those bones to make my own broth.  So very good!!!

Like others I couldn’t find rice with a flavor packet. I use a package of Knorr Sides Creamy Chicken and dump it all into the chicken/water/broth combo. I also add another 14.5oz can of broth to thin it a bit. I can’t get enough of this.

Out of a family of 6..  this is by far 4 of our absolute favorite soups. I usually make a double batch and freeze a couple individual servings, I know the that cream soups aren't supposed to really be frozen, but, I have it down pat and it is always fine. I use all broth and no water, but that's the only change. In our house you MUST have saltine crackers for it.

Like everything I cook, I doctored this recipe up a bit.  I simmered the chicken in water until it literally fell apart.  On the side, I saute'd the onion, celery, garlic, carrots, and broccoli bits with some herbs and spices, in olive oil.  When everything was opaque I simply added it to the soup.  I used 1/2 rice.  When the chicken and water boiled down until it was reduced by half, that's when I added the wild rice.  On the side I mixed 1/4 cup of flour and 1/2 c milk.  When rice is almost done, I poured 1 cup of 2% milk into the broth mix.  I added 2 T butter.  I cooked for roughly another 10 - 15 minutes before adding the flour/milk.  I used a little at a time until the soup was where I wanted it to be. This delicious soup was served with garlic sticks.  Yummy!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe??

This recipe is a keeper. I added onion and carrots to the butter before i made the roux and it turned out great. Next time I will add  diced celery. 

I also used low-fat milk not cream and it was rich and delicious.

Best chicken wild rice soup with lots of flavor!  I didn’t even use wild rice with a packet seasoning. I cut the chicken up invite size pieces,seasoned it and cooked it on the stove top in some olive oil.  It had great flavor!

I've made this recipe several times, and my whole family just loves it.  My husband does NOT like  chicken, in any form, but he'll eat several bowls of this without complaint :)  Hardy comfort food, add some carrots/celery & onion if you want, but even as is this recipe rocks!

Very good recipe, I used Farmhouse chicken and wild rice which is very good tasting. I took other suggestions and added carrots, celery and onions chopped up and added that to the butter. I sautéed that for five minutes then added the flour and seasoning packet. Cook that for another five minutes and then added 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk, which then added that to the rice in the broth that has been cooking 15 minutes before hand with 1/2 teaspoon of thyme., cooked another 15 minutes adding in rotisserie chicken.

I gave the recipe 3 starts because for my taste buds it was bland in flavor, too thick and too fatty but was a good base soup. I did like most people on here add fried onion/carrots/mushrooms/garlic, also added peas, added my own spices and herbs that I like ( turmeric, smoked paprika, saffron, dry basil and fresh dill). I used white jasmine rice, as I love this rice, plus when its cooked, it has rich/smooth, slightly sticky texture. To make it less sticky rinse rice few times in cold water.  I also used store bought rotisserie chicken, that gave soup more nice flavor.  I didnt have time to make roux, so I used some canned cream of chicken and Alfredo sauce. I dont like very thick soups.

I’ve made this soup many times over the years and only make a couple of modifications. My family loves having it a bit more chunky so, I sauté diced carrots and celery in about a tablespoon of butter for a few minutes just to soften them a bit. I also can never find quick cooking long grain and wild rice in my area so I use regular Rice a Roni, add it to the celery and carrots, add the broth and water, bring to a boil, cover and let simmer for about 25 min. I’ll then add the roux mix and chicken once it’s done simmering. I also use rotisserie chicken from the store, shred it and add as much as I like. The rice is always cooked nicely and my family loves it!!

It’s “okay”; the taste reminds me of a chicken stew with a roux but not as good.  I will not be cooking again.

This  soup was very simple to make (at least for me nerds) the ingredients were cheap for me and didn't even dent my wallet. I made the soup perfectly, I am perfect. Yesterday I bought a Bengal tiger just to flex on ya'll nerds.

Have made this many times - tonight I used vegan Ripple half and half, better than boullion no chicken base, gluten free flour, soy free earth Balance, sautéed onion, celery, and carrots. Out of garlic. Skipped the chicken. I let it cook down a bit as it seemed a little thin at first but it did get quite thick. 

So so good. If I hadn’t made it myself I would have never guessed it was vegan. It was my first time using Ripple plant milk - usually I use canned coconut milk for creamy soups but my son doesn’t care for it and I wasn’t sure how it would work here. Next time I’ll add more vegerables and maybe some mushrooms.

I used left over frozen turkey. Did not use cream but made a roux and used milk. By using the seasoning packets that are included you really don't need to add additional seasonings.

I made this soup and thought it was delicious!!! It was even better the second day. The only negative comment I would make is it’s  way to thick, so I added more chicken stock to loosen it up to my preferred consistency. I will definitely be making this again.

This was brilliant right according to the recipe. I added some gold potatoes, carrots and onions that were left overs with the roast chicken and they were fine with it. A great way to take care of those leftovers!

Super delicious recipe. I, like others, made a few adjustments (using the recommendations of others). I used 1/2 cup flour for the roux and added wine to the water, broth mixture. I used wild rice that I bought at Costco. And instead of cream, used skim milk. Kid approved!!

Made a few changes out of the box (thank you reviewers!) to add little flavor and cut down on the calories. Used whole milk, sauteed onions, celery, carrots and a clove of garlic in olive oil prior to adding to stock. Seasoned with salt, pepper and no salt seasoning. Thickened nicely, hearty meal with a chuck of fresh baked baguette, delish.

This has been added to my permanent comfort food list.  I make it all the time in Winter.  I did change a couple things (1) only use 1/2 Cup flour; (2) I use Half-and-Half instead of heavy cream; and (3) I use white pepper instead of black pepper.  Yum!!

The changes I made: start by cooking finely chopped onions with oregano, basil, salt, pepper, a pinch of chicken bouillon, and garlic. Then, add the chicken in small pieces and cook almost completely. Then, add the water and rice  and continue with the recipe. I used a mix of vegetable and chicken stock. For the roux, I only added about half, but I think only a quarter is really necessary.

Amazing. I did mine in the instant pot. Sautéed onions, carrots, and celery with cut up raw chicken. Added the. Broth and water and used regular cooking time wild rice. Set 10 mins on HP- NR for 10 mins and then added the roux mixture just as the directions state.

Delicious. I followed one reviewers advice and reduced and substituted a bit.  I used 5 tblspoons butter, 3/4 heavy cream and 1 1/4 whole milk. I also added carrots, onions and celery. I also used boxed long grain and wild rice. I simply cooked it as the package instructed but left out the seasoning packet. I substituted the recipes salt and pepper and simple added the seasoning packet to the melted butter instead. It worked just fine. I agree that this recipe is friendly to modifications. I’ll be making it again!

I use half and half or 1% milk instead of heavy cream and it works just fine.

I doubled the batch and added onions, carrots and celery and it was still delish! I've made this before with other variations but the base recipe is excellent and quite simple for a winter weeknight.

I make this all the time! My family's fave!! I use the meat from a rotisserie chicken and Uncle Ben's Wild Rice. It gets really thick after it cools off so I add chicken broth to it the following day.

Made this a few times and I have some mods that enhance it. Cook chicken stock or broth with rice/seasoning mix. In separate pan add carrots, celery, onion, and garlic to oil & butter until mix starts to soften. Add flour to vegetables to then milk/cream to create roux. Add roux/veg mix to rice/stock mix then add cooked chicken to pot. Saute mushrooms in butter then add to pot. I add chicken "better than boullion" paste to give deeper chicken flavor.  Also try adding a little curry to the mix, it makes chicken taste more "chicken-y".  If I want thicker soup I make more butter/flour/milk roux to add. Want creamier soup? Add more cream/milk. Want thinner soup? Add more chicken broth. Probably need to add more broth on day 2 after the rice absorbs more of the liquid overnight.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this before as it's been my go to recipe for years!!! I urge everyone to make this recipe just as written as it is DIVINE!!! This recipe as never once failed.  I always make this after Thanksgiving to use up any leftover turkey and gravy, and any leftover bits of veggies such as celery and onion. I boil down the turkey bones to make the best stock ever and use this for the base with water. I throw in any leftover veggies with the stock and rice. I use leftover gravy as part of the butter /flour roux. Word of caution, if you start adding leftovers and such, be careful with the seasonings as your soup may have plenty of salt and pepper and does't need any additional seasoning. Also I, too, have made this with milk, part milk /part evaporated milk, etc. This recipe is so very forgiving. ENJOY!

Zenith  of comfort foods.  Did follow recommendation of many reviewers and added sauteed onions, garlic,  celery and carrots.  Also subbed 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup 2% milk for heavy cream and used 1/2 cup APF vice 3/4 cup (as recommended by reviewers).  Most deliciousness!  Hat's off to original contributor and reviewers!  SALUTE!

This was delicious and so easy to make. I did read other reviews and followed some of the recommendations I read. Instead of using heavy cream, I used half and half cream. I also only used 1/2 cup of flour instead of 3/4 cup. It was so tasty and perfect for this cold weather.

This recipe was very tasty, but I thought it was too rich with the heavy cream.  Next time I make it, I will use fat free half and half instead.

Added mushrooms, carrots, celery, and onions.  Cook them first to soften them, then add to the soup at the same time as the chicken.   Because of this, I used 5 cups of chicken stock.   Fantastic!

This soup is the bomb! I’ve made it many times and the recipe is always requested. I use a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time. I have used heavy cream, half and half or milk whichever I have at the time. It turns out great, no matter which I use. This is a family favorite! LOVE it served with a hot baguette to dip in it!

Absolutely perfect for anyone who wants to have something filling and satisfying on a chilly, rainy day in Autumn ??. I didn't have any cream, so I used evaporated milk and regular 2% milk with a little extra butter instead. 

What I love most about this meal is that the ingredients are usually in my pantry, no need to go out and grab anything while the weather is yucky! I'm absolutely making this soup to bring to a gathering I'm attending this weekend too!

Oh...also, I doubled the recipe to bring a home cooked meal to both of my kids (ages 20 and 23) who live on their own now. They are always trying to make ends meet, so I doubt either has had a decent meal in ages! Also, there's my own (not so distant) memories of when my husband and I were their age, living on our own... My husband and I both worked full time, however, all we usually had in our refrigerator was a bottle of ketchup and some leftover Chinese takeout, lol! We'll never forget the week when all we had to eat was Top Ramen and we were absolutely broke! Talk about creative dinners! I should have written a cookbook called, "101 different recipes using Ramen." ??

This beautiful soup is so simple and delightfully satisfying that I wish I'd found it sooner! Thank you!

Straight up perfect recipe. If you want to play with it go for it. I doubled the last batch because I used a whole Costco rotisserie chicken  and used a pack of onion soup mix as the other half of my  base.  I used milk instead of cream on the 2nd half which blended beautifully. Just a family favorite!

Wonderful! I sautéed onion garlic carrots and celery in 1T butter and then a 1/2lb fresh mushrooms. I used canned cooked wild rice so made the roux using chicken broth powder/seasoning and eventually combined the milk/roux with the veggies, rotisserie chicken and broth in the stock pot. Outstanding. I did add a splash of sherry too. I also used 1 cup 1% milk and 1 cup half n half instead of 2 cups cream.

This was a delicious soup. My husband ate almost the entire pot in less than 48 hours. Lol. I did add the sauteed carrots, celery, and onion like others suggested. It was more for texture than anything else. I will definitely make it again!

Delicious! I followed advice from other reviewers and sautéed onions, celery, and carrots and added to soup. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. It was sooo creamy and thick- we loved it. Will definitely make again!

A really yummy soup! I followed suggestion of others & added the chopped onion, celery & shredded carrots that gave some addional depth to taste.  I also used a generous pinch of dried thyme while sautéing the veggies.  This one will go in my permanent recipe file, thank you!

This soup was very hearty and filling.  My roux was thick and when I added it to the broth, it was clumpy so next time I will whisk some broth into the roux first to thin it out and then add it into the broth/rice mixture.

I made this, but I added a cup of chopped carrots and 1/2 cup of diced celery and let that simmer with the chicken breast in 4 cups chicken stock. I used light butter and 2 cups fat free half and half for the roux and it was perfect. This comes out to about 200 calories for a cup.

Reduced the amount of flour and used half lt cream  and half milk instead of heavy cream.  Added carrots,onions,mushrooms and celery and thyme and tarragon, and cayenne. Yes, you can say that it’s a different recipe but it was very thick and the veggies added so much flavor!

I made the recipe gluten free by using 1/4C+2T corn starch instead of flour and I also threw in some frozen mixed veggies. Will make again!

After reading reviews, I added 1/2 c. each of diced onion, carrot and celery, plus 2 cloves of garlic. I roasted the chicken breasts, substituted olive oil for the butter (1 T. to sauté vegetables, and 4 T. with 1/2 c. flour to make the roux. I cooked rice separately in 2 c. water. When I mixed everything together, I added about 1/4 tsp. ground white pepper, in addition to the salt and pepper, along with 1/4 c. sauvignon blanc. Will definitely be adding this in our fall/winter rotation.

It's so simple and delicious! To give the soup a little more interest, I added 1/2 cup each diced carrot, celery and onion. I sautéed veggies together in a little olive oil, then added them to the soup before adding the roux. I also substituted 1% milk for the cream (I find cream too heavy). It turned out great!

It's good, but in my opinion needs some work to be great. 

I added celery, onion, and carrot because I can't imagine this type of soup without a mirepoix. I didn't want to add the rice seasoning packet because I don't care for the artificial, chemical flavors in seasoned rice mixes (just my personal preference), but unfortunately I was unable to find a white/wild blend that had a separate seasoning packet so I gave it a go. I used Zataran's brand with onion and garlic spice mix. The flavor overwhelmed the rich, gentler flavors that I love in this type of soup. To be fair, I didn't use the correct type of rice, however, the recipe didn't specify a brand or type to use and I looked all over for a brand that had a separate seasoning packet. I feel the recipe could have been more clear in this regard. 

Mixing the cream into the roux was a bit of a pain because it resulted in a thick batter consistency which I'm sure would have caused lumps had I added it directly to the pot with the chicken broth as instructed. Instead, I added a few ladle fulls of broth to the cream mixture to thin it out more before adding it to the broth. This resulted in a silky smooth soup. Not a big deal, but could be difficult for a novice cook. 

There wasn't as much rice in the soup as I would have liked. Next time I'll buy a plain white and wild mix (if I can find one) and cook it separately so I can add as much rice as I like.

Excellent and easy! As many other reviewers I started by sautéing some onion, carrots and celery with a tablespoon of butter until they started to soften. Then I added cut up meat from a rotisserie chicken, broth, water and 2 (14 oz) cans of cooked wild rice. I made the roux as stated adding some garlic to the melted butter and some oregano and rosemary into the flour. I know some reviewers get upset by all the substitutions, but for me veggies in this soup are a must have!

We made a lot of modifications to this recipe. First, we didn't have this "seasoning packet" the recipe said to use, so we just skipped that step. Second, adding onion, sweet peppers, and celery is a good addition. Last, we used milk instead of heavy cream. It tasted amazing, but it was a little bland. Add salt before serving.

This is now the second time I have made this soup.  Followed original directions precisely the first time, and enjoyed the soup, but thought it was a little overly thick.  Made second time using Carrie's recommended changes for a healthier version below, and enjoyed it even more.  Bottom line, you can't go wrong with this recipe...But I like having the healthier/thinner option.

I have made this at least a dozen times adding different vegetables that I had available. The recipe is 5 stars just the way it is. I had to stop making it because of my husband’s dietary needs. I decided to try it again with some adjustments. I used 1/4 cup plus 2 TB spoons of olive oil in place of the butter and used half and half instead of cream. The roux came out just fine and it still had a ton of flavor. I’m glad I came back to this recipe to try it again.

Really good, but really thick. I like that it takes the guess work out of which seasoning to add because you just use packets. Mine always comes out a little too thick so I add 4 extra cups of water. It's very heavy unless I add extra water and while it still tastes amazing thick, I can feel my hips expanding with each bite lol. I added a bag of frozen peas and carrots to my soup also and it definitely needed it.

So I did made quite a few changes but we LOVED how it turned out... a bit spicier with more of a broth since both me and my guy were sick. I omitted the cream/milk and the flour. Only used 1 tbsp with some olive oil to sauté a chopped onion, 3 cloves garlic, 2 celery stalks and two carrots first. Boiled the chicken breasts in 6 cups broth (added maybe 1.5 cups water) then shredded. Made wild rice in a separate pan and set aside. Added sautéed veggies to the broth from the chicken as well as a one head of chopped bok choy stems (set aside leaves and added the last 15 min of cooking) a diced red pepper, some tobasco peppers (just took some from a jar of trappys Hot vinegar) some chopped scapes, a chopped zucchini.. and any other veggies I could find. Added the rice back in and let all simmer. Then I added about 3/4 teaspoon basil and oregano, a pinch of thyme, couple shakes of cayenne pepper, some spicy garlic salt and a few shakes of red pepper flakes as well as the recipes salt and pepper. From there it was filled with delicious flavors.. May have added a touch more cayenne just for taste. We couldn’t stop eating it. A must if you want a little kick to your chicken/veggie/rice soup!

When I am in a pinch for time, I sometimes buy a rotisserie chicken and pull the meet off the bone instead of the boneless chicken breast halves.  My entire family loves this recipe!

The rue didn't turn out how it was shown and the soup didn't thicken as much as I thought it would but I can honestly say it is one of my favorites and I will definitely be making it again. Instead of heavy cream I used whole milk and I added half a cup of celery, carrots, and onion.

Love this!  I’ve made it twice. Used Uncle Ben’s 6 oz. box so there would be a little more rice. Made it once with carrots and once without. Both great!

Made this almost exactly as directed. My only changes were adding a little extra salt and pepper, as well as a dash of garlic powder, and substituting whole milk for the heavy dream. It still came out rich, creamy and delicious.  Unlike many soups, this was an entirely filling meal all on its own. In fact, the texture was so thick that I think you could cut back to 1/2 cup of flour, if desired. Next time I may sauté some vegetables as other reviewers have suggested--the soup needs nothing else to be delicious and substantial, but the flavor could easily carry some veggies too. This recipe will be going into the regular rotation!

This soup was hearty and comforting ! As many reviewers did, I started by sautéing  some onions, garlic, celery and carrots. I added the broth and water. I let the veggies simmer till soft then added the chicken and rice. At the same time, I was making the roux on anoter burner. For that I cut the butter down to 5 Tablespoons and the flour to 1/3 cup and used 2% milk for the cream. the soupe was plenty creamy and delicious despite the modifications made.

Delicious!!! I added carrots and celery and otherwise followed the recipe as written. Husband kept saying how good it was. I added chicken broth when I reheated it the following day. I will definitely be making this again.

This soup is delicious! I did make a few changes. I sauteed 1/2 to 3/4 cup each of chopped carrots and celery with 1 whole (but small) chopped onion (about 1 cup), and two garlic cloves. After that I proceeded with the usual recipe (using rotisserie chicken instead of breasts... I was being lazy, but it worked perfectly) , but used 2% milk in place of the cream. Next time I will have to figure out how to make it without using a whole stick of butter. Yikes! It was incredibly tasty, though, and easily rivals or outshines anything you would find in a restaurant.

Excellent and just like Panera Bread’s.  I use Rice A Roni and brown the rice first with vegetables and garlic before adding broth, water, and chicken.

I made several mods - sautéed some onion and garlic to the base, switched in a small bag of barley for the wild rice, added 2 cups more stock, and added some veggies (ok it was Veg-All!) - added all to a pressure cooker and was VERY pleased.  Hearty and good flavor!

Followed the advice of the other reviewers and halfed the amount of flour and butter. Also substituted the heavy cream for half and half. The  soup still turned out really thick,  just boiled for a bit longer if you need thicker.  I also added a big clove of garlic for flavor. I used uncle bens long grain and wild rice with seasoning packet and this soup turned out amazing the exact right amount of flavor.

I've made this soup for large groups on several occasions and it is always a hit.  I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and sautéed onions, celery and carrots to add to the soup, which provides great color and wonderful  flavor.   I also cut the flour down to 1/2 cup.  Tastes better than any chicken and wild rice I've ever gotten from any restaurant .  Definitely one to put in the family recipe book!

I've made this soup twice now and it is delicious. The second time I used canned milk instead of heavy cream, which has half the calories and fat.  The result was still delicious and plenty creamy.  I added a cup of sliced carrots and 1 cup spinach also. Yum yum.

Excellent soup.  I used rotisserie chicken breast, 2 boxes (6.2 oz) of Uncle Ben’s fast cook long grain & wild rice (one just wasn’t enough), eliminated the 1/2 tsp salt the recipe called for (there’s enough between the rice seasoning and chicken broth) and added chopped carrots.

This was great just as written!  Just to cut a few calories the 2nd time I made it I used 1/2 the amount of cream and it was still wonderful.  I think next time I may reduce the amount more, or try using milk instead.

Poached two chicken breasts, sautéed onion/carrots/celery as another reviewer suggested, used chicken stock vs broth. Subbed half skim milk. Was very creamy, very filling. I thought the flavor was a little lacking, so added thyme, salt, some white wine. Still wasn't quite there (maybe a dollop of Better than Bouillon would have deepened the flavor as desired). Took about 2 hours for me to make due to the poaching, veg sauté, and my pokiness when making a recipe for the first time. :-) Definitely thickened up; suggest having an addl cup or two of broth in reserve in case it's needed or for reheating. My family didn't love it, so I'm not sure I'll make this again.

For my tastes, I added sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions, peas and carrots and an extra box of rice.  The soup as written, was very thick, like a pot pie filling.  I thinned it with broth added the extra rice and more veggies and it turned out really good and I ended up with even more soup, so I froze some for lunches.  Good base recipe to add on what you like.

WOW!!WOW!!WOW!!  Can I give it 10 stars?  This will be part of my regular soup rotation from now on!  I know it annoys some to change the recipe then rate it; but after reading multiple reviews, I felt a few changes would improve a great base recipe.  I added salt and pepper to the chicken and cooked it in my Copper XL pot  to avoid using oil.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and sauteed 1/2 cup each diced carrots, onion, and celery, mixed with 2 tsp minced garlic in the juice from the cooked chicken.  I used a 5.5oz bag of Knorr Rice Sides Chicken and Broccoli mix (since I didn't have what the recipe called for), directly to the chicken mixture rather than the roux.   I also added 2-3 dashes each of poultry seasoning,  onion powder, parsley flakes, and garlic powder and an additional 1 cup of water  to the mix so the end product wasn't too thick, but remained flavorful.  I used 1/2 cup flour and 6 Tbsp butter with 2 cups milk for the roux to reduce calories and it was plenty thick and creamy.  Very, very delicious and colorful (especially with the carrots, broccoli, and parsley)!  Thank you for this excellent recipe!

had to make a few subs, but wonderful soup for a cold windy winter day.  used leftover Christmas turkey and Jasmine rice.  would have had even better flavor with the wild rice.

Very Good!  I'm not a soup person but this is an outstanding recipe. I sautéed onion, garlic and celery, used almond milk and a rice all purpose flour as I'm not supposed to eat gluten. Added carrots and peas and I could not get enough!!  Will be making this more often!!

I really liked this.  I used 6 TBS of butter and only 1/2 a cup flour.  I also used milk and added frozen peas and carrots, onion, and garlic.

This recipe was superb!  I substituted Canoe Cooked (canned) Wild Rice.  Have always been a purist about wild rice, but I didn’t have the time to hassle with cooking it from scratch.  Will always use Canoe Wild Rice!

I made this today for dinner and it was fantastic.  I had to work with what I had on had but there is son much you can do with this. I used chicken breast, zucchini, peas, carrots, potatoes and white rice. I added a 2 tsp of curry and used whole milk. it was plenty thick with whole milk. The curry gave it a nice little kick. We had it with homemade pita bread. Definitely a very filling and hearty soup.

Excellent meal paired with corn bread. Browned chicken thighs (boneless) in skillet with truffle oil, garlic, onion, S&P.Added butter to same skillet to make my “rue” then added about 1 1/2 C corn kernels to the soup. Let cook for about 2hrs on low.

This is such a go-to recipe.  I've altered this recipe every time I've made it, and every time it comes out awesome.  I use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts since they are more moist.  The last time I made it, I added a whole package of wild rice, along with the wild rice mix, since wild rice doesn't absorb liquids like rice does and adds so much more to the soup.   

This is definitely a jump-off recipe for making all kinds of variations of this amazing soup.

This soup is such a hit!   It’s so flavorful!  This last time I made it was the best ever.   Sautéed celery and carrots with the chicken first. Perfect comfort food.

This is delicious. I used the suggestions of others and added garlic, carrots, and celery in addition to the onion. Rather than heavy cream, I used 2% milk, reduced the butter down to six tablespoons, and used 1/3 cup of flour. The store only had unsalted chicken broth which I used and no issues.

With a few small tweaks, this is a VERY delicious soup! For the rice, I used slightly more (6.2 oz box of Uncle Ben’s Fast Cook, Long Grain and Wild Rice).  Therefore, I used about 3 TBS less flour.  For the chicken, I bought a rotisserie chicken from Walmart. I put all of the meat in. (It was about 3 and 1/2 cups shredded.) Also, I added a few shakes of dried onion flakes and about a fourth teaspoon minced garlic (from a jar). Other than these changes, I followed out the rest of the recipe as originally written. When done, I topped with chunks of ripe, chilled tomato. Yum! When you’re heat it the next day, just stir in some water to get it back to the consistency of your liking. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent soup!  Made this last night with crusty bread, and will definitely make it again. The only thing I did differently was use a whole package of rice (about 6 oz) and added about a cup of cooked wild rice, too, along with some grated carrots for color. I also omitted the salt to reduce the sodium.  Because the can of broth was opened, I used more than 4 cups, and just reduced the water a little.  This is a keeper!

I made exactly as printed.  Reading the recipe, I thought it lacked spices, vegetables, etc.  But it has a great flavor!  Mild but delicious, and very satisfying.  Next time I will add some carrots, onions and a  bit of celery, just because I like them, but really, it's very good as is.

I made this with coconut creamer and Margarine to keep it dairy free. I followed advice of another reviewer and added carrots, onions, celery, garlic and celery salt. I found it quite thick and added two more cups of chicken Broth. My kids didn’t care for it, but me and my husband enjoyed.

Really good, I also reduced the amount of butter to 4 TB, and about 1/3 cup of flour. I did end up adding a TB of corn starch to thicken it a bit. I also used 2% milk. Also added about 1/2 cup of peas, celery, and carrots. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! My whole family loved it. Not healthy but very hearty. This will become our new favorite soup. I combined bone in chicken breast to the broth and then separated the chicken to add back I to the  soup.

This was delicious!   My hubby is still talking about it.  I listened to others and added onion, carrots and garlic. I also used half and half and 2 boxes of rice.   After it was all combined, I simmered for about 20 minutes, but first added mushrooms and peas.   Next time, I'll add a tad more salt.  But wowza.

Big hit!  We loved it.  If you're looking to add something to the flavor, broccoli would be a great added flavor, however, it's not needed if you don't like broccoli.

I sautéed 4 shallots, two cloves of garlic, 3/4 cup sliced baby carrots and 3/4 cup diced celery in 1 tbsp of olive oil in my Dutch oven. Then, I added the chicken, which I had grilled on the barbecue, the water and the chicken broth to the Dutch oven and followed the recipe exactly. This turned out awesome. Served it with French bread and made a dinner out of it.

I made it almost exactly as the recipe said, except I added one more package of rice/seasonings, because I couldn't taste any rice with just one package, and I also used half & half instead of heavy cream.  Next time I plan to add celery and diced carrots. My family loved it!

Made it with these changes:  used real wild rice (not instant), added about 3/4 cup diced carrots, 1/2 cup diced celery, 3 medium-sized garlic cloves & 5 medium Crimini mushrooms sliced, to the veggie mixture and sautéed lightly.  Used Half & Half instead of heavy cream. Since there was no seasoning pack in my real wild rice, I just seasoned with pink sea salt, fresh ground pepper, some Lawry's seasoning salt and a couple shakes of Penzey's Tuscan seasoning mix.  Next time I will double the amount of wild rice...4 ounces is just not enough for my taste.  Will try adding 1/2 cup good dry white wine to liquid (reducing water by same amount) or maybe a few tablespoons of sherry before serving.  It needs a little more oomph in the flavor area.

This soup is so good and comforting!  I added a large can of chopped mushrooms as well as sautéed onions, carrots and celery.  I also used 1 percent milk instead of cream and only 1/2 cup of flour to lower the caloric intake. My brother added croutons to the finished product and that kicked it up another notch! Yummy!

This is one of the best soups I have ever eaten... I did add sautéed onions and garlic, as well as some carrots to the broth.  Paired beautifully with Moroccan challah for Shabbat.

It was also the perfect teaching opportunity for my son who is learning to cook.  Simple for beginner cooks, but still wonderfully delicious to the picky palate.

It's fantastic as a base recipe. I had to add 1 large onion and a 1 lb pkg of baby carrots (needed veggies). Added a little True Lemon, Lemon Herb, summer savoury, poultry seasoning, star anise, anise seed along with the pepper (very little salt). Can't drink dairy so used 2 cups Almond Breeze. Topped it off with Italian parsley. Yummy! Will make it again.

Wow! This was amazing and incredibly easy. I made it on a rainy day and everyone loved it (well, except for one extremely picky son who said it made him gag, but he's another story). Following other reviewers' suggestions, I added 1 cup carrots, half a cup of celery, and sautéed it with butter and onion. It needed to go in the fridge for a few hours before I served it, and it got really thick, almost solid. I added more chicken broth, reheated it, and it turned out fine. If you're going to add vegetables I suggest increasing the liquid accordingly.

Very good! My only recommendation is to cook the rice with the seasoning packet separately. The seasonings will attach to the rice instead of just floating on the top of the soup when made by this recipe. Other than that, very  easy to make and very, very good!

Thanks for the recipe

I made this soup for one of my church's Lenten suppers.  I sautéed in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil:  1/2 cup chopped onion, 1/2 cup chopped celery, 1/2 cup chopped carrot, and one minced clove of garlic, and added this to the soup.  Also, I used only 1/2 cup flour and 6 tablespoons of butter for the roux.  I substituted 1 cup half and half, and 1 cup 2% milk for the 2 cups of heavy cream.  The soup was very creamy.  There were no leftovers that evening.  I received several compliments, and two people asked me for the recipe!

Very Good!!
I followed the recipe exactly - using uncle ben's fine herb and wild rice pkg.  And it was even better as left overs- it thickens a lot so I just added 1/4 c to 1/3 cup of water per bowl before reheating in microwave.  My 7 yr old and hubby loved this soup too.  This is added to my recipe box!

I used regular rice and made up my own spice packet from a wild rice cheat. Less sodium and preservatives that way. It was very filling. Id definitely make it again.

This was delicious! The flavors were spot on and I didn't need to add any additional seasonings. I used 2 additional cups of  chicken broth in place of the water and 2% milk instead of cream--I didn't miss the cream at all. I also added carrots and celery. Will be making this again!

Couldn't decide between 4 or 5 stars. Went with 5 because I didn't follow the recipe exactly and it may have been better had I. I found it a little bland. That may have been my fault because I forgot to add the salt in the flour mixture and I used low sodium chicken broth. Here's how I made this. I boiled my chicken in salted and herbed water until almost fully cooked. Then I cubed it. Sautéed onions, carrots, celery, garlic and peas till done. Then added the chicken cubes to finish cooling them. Then I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe except I used 6Tbs butter with 1/2 cup flour and I used about 1 cup half and half and 1 cup 1% milk instead of the cream. My husband loved this but my kids (ages 15 &18) didn't. But they aren't soup lovers. I don't think I'll make this again as it wasn't super quick and only my husband was a big fan.

I added essentials. Onion, celery & carrots. I also ground all my spices w fresh pepper, Himalayan salt & fresh pressed garlic (way more that recipe called for). I used 1% milk to keep it a little lighter. It exceeded my expectations & was easy to create. Even better the next day.. Highly recommend this recipe. Easy peasy & a crowd pleaser!

Loved it, kids loved it= perfect. ....well almost. Two things a lot of  whisking , hard whisking.  And two pots to clean plus prep stuff: measuring cup, measuring spoons, cuting board ( I used 1lb of chicken, chopped it up and cooked it in boiled broth). I also used water and chicken bullion because I had no chicken broth. I will make this again and add veggies next time; carrots and broccoli.

I liked this soup very much.  But because  I'm  watching my weight I substituted  a can of Healthy Cream of Mushroom Soup for the flour, butter and cream.  Excellent !

Easy and fabulous !

I made a couple changes however.  

I cooked the chicken in the broth and substituted broth for the 2 cups of water.

 Used 1/2 the seasoning packet to reduce salt.

  Added crisp bacon and fried mushrooms at the end.

This is a really, easy and hearty soup. Made the recipe exactly as is but like more rice, so added a bag of the 90 second pre-cooked wild rice. I definitely will make again.  Very tasty and filling.

I made this soup exactly as written so that I could rate it fairly.  It was super yummy!! I would recommend it to anyone.  I have a wild rice casserole recipe that includes all of the same ingredients only adds mushrooms and pimentos.  So, after making this soup as written, I added some pimentos just because I like the subtle flavor it adds - but with or without - this soup is a 5 star.  So, if you're not afraid of butter and cream - go for it!! It's amazing!! You'll feel like a 5 star restaurant chef when you serve it to your family and friends.

Not the best soup ever, but definitely is good and filling. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because I think breast meet is too dry. Not overly herby. Maybe some other seasons need to be added.

My 6 yr old cried, saying this looked disgusting. She proceeded to eat 2 bowls. It was good, but I cut down on the broth and I probably cut down too much. Also, I accidentally bought wild rice that cooks in its package in the microwave and I used cooked chicken, so the beginning steps were all changed for me. I used light sour cream and almond milk instead of cream and that didn't effect it negatively. Overall good and I'm sure it would get 5 stars if I had followed directions to a T. Next time I will add extra veggies because it seems like a waste of soup not to.

Best tasting soup I have ever made. It was a lot creamier and heavy than i thought which is a good thing sometimes.  At first I thought I was making the rue wrong because it was a greenish color that did not appear on the video but it was fine. It was a  big hit at my house!!! I can not wait to make it again.

I was a little skeptical about using a boxed rice mix for this soup, but I was pleased with the end result. I did add a half-onion, several celery stalks & three carrots cut in 1/2 inch pieces and a couple garlic cloves coarsely chopped, which I sautéed for a few minutes in olive oil prior to adding the chicken and broth. I cut the flour & butter to 3 tbsp each and used primarily milk with about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I added more broth as I like a thinner soup. I will make this again. This is a great way to use leftover roast chicken.

I used other reviewers suggestions and added carrots, garlic, onion and celery. Substituted half the cream with milk to cut down a bit of fat where I could. Used a rotisserie chicken for convenience. I couldn't find rice with  a seasoning packet so I improvised and added salt, pepper and poultry seasoning (?) which seemed ok, but maybe others would have better suggestions. The family gave it rave reviews and it was definitely restaurant quality or better.

Absolutely delicious. I nearly tripled this, and used a whole roaster that I pulled the meat from. Everything else was done exactly as directed. This will be made and eaten often in our home.

This is truly the most delicious soup I have ever made! I used a rotisserie chicken and substituted 2 cups of 2% milk for the heavy cream, a 6.2 oz box of Uncle Ben's Fast Cook Long Grain and Wild Rice,  and added sliced fresh mushrooms, and approximately 1/4 cup of cooking sherry (I didn't actually measure it). This recipe is a keeper! I know I will make it often.

I love this recipe.  It's simple and quick to make.  Our family always has seconds when we serve it. I like to add a bag of corn to the recipe.

This was an easy quick win of a recipe.  My daughter loved it and I have made it twice now.  Only change I made was to increase the amount of the chicken broth as the rice was absorbing the liquid after a day and it was more wild rice casserole vs a soup.

This soup is sooooo good. I sauteed onion, celery and carrots in olive oil, and seasoned them, adding them to the chicken mix before the roux. I also added cayenne to give it just a touch of heat. Super good, I will be making it again. After the first of the year I will make it using the 2% milk rather than cream - but it's the day after Christmas so who cares today. :)

Very, very good!  I did take another reviewers advice and saute onion, garlic, celery and carrots  in olive oil before adding the broth and chicken (used chicken thighs boiled in water with better than bouillon).  It came out very thick so added some milk to thin it out a bit.  Really good, all 3 kids & husband liked it.

This is the first time I have made this soup. It has always been one of my favorite soups and I thought I should try my hand at making my own. It was delicious. I added sauteed carrots and mushrooms with minced garlic.I will definitely make this again. It is a very rich soup. 

I tried making the soup a little lighter by using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream.

Excellent!!!  Put 1 carton (4c) Swanson vegetable broth, 2 c water, roasted turkey breast in pot. Bring to boil. Add Rice A Roni Long Grain and Wild Rice Original (box) rice only. Remove from heat. Sauté 3-4 large carrots, 3-4 stalks celery and 1/2 chopped onion in 2T butter. When soft, add 4T butter to melt. Add 1/4 - 1/2 cup flour. *consider reducing to 1/4c. Brown a bit/make roux.  Add 1 cup skim milk (Fairlife).  Bring pot with broth back to simmer. Add in creamy roux. Add in rice seasoning packet. *Soup gets VERY thick when cooking/cooling.  Seasoned with salt, pepper and celery salt.

I made this soup twice. The first time it turned out amazing. I used an obscure brand that I never heard of for the rice. The second time it totally bombed. I am suppose to bring dinner to someone tonight and now I can't. DO NOT USE RICE A RONI BRAND. They put the black rice in the seasoning packet so now I have a creamy soup with crunchy rice. I have to throw the whole thing away.

Excellent as a base.. Leaves you open to add more to cater to your preference. Like others recommended, I did sautée onions, carrots, and some garlic.. And I actually used thinly cut  chicken breast and added it into the veggies and the chicken didn't overcook. I used only 1/2 cup of flour.. I can't imagine using anymore than that.. I think the consistency would be too thick. I did use heavy cream.. But I definitely think I may use 2% milk next time...just for my own preference. But great recipe!

This recipe is a good base, and you can make it heartier by changing some things up.  
I used 2 rotisserie chicken (save time) 
I used 7 cups of chicken stock. 
2 cans of cream of chicken soup with 2 cans of water.  
Added 2 more cups of water. 

Sautéed onions and minced garlic.  Added it to the broth. Added chicken.  
Added chopped carrots and celery.
Added 5 boxes of long grain and wild rice, with their seasoning packets to the soup.  

In a pan I used 1/2 cup of butter, melt it, then added 3/4 cup of flour. 
I then added 2 cups of heavy cream, and about a tbls of pepper. Stirred until thick.  Added flour mixture to my soup, and stirred.

Let simmer, until veggies are nice and tender and rice is done.  
Served with fresh baked bread.  

**note, my method makes a huge batch of soup.  
Perfect for freezing....add milk or water when reheating to thin the soup out to your liking. **

This soup has wonderful flavor. Quite easy to make too. I made this recipe as written.  Next time I will use 2% milk instead of heavy cream and possibly cut down on the amount of butter used. The flavor is wonderful however it had a rim of fat around the edges that was too much.

I have made this a few times now for my family!! Always a huge hit!! Some us like mushrooms and others don't so I have divided it a couple times and put mushrooms in half of it. Win win for everyone! Tonight we had it with a fresh baked loaf of bread and it was amazing!! If you are looking for a cold weather hearty soup, this is the one to try!!

I made this exactly as posted and my husband loved!  Made it a second and third  time and added finely chopped onion and celery, sliced carrots and mushrooms and 1/3 cup parmesan cheese at last minute.  Dressed up it is a perfect meal for guests...took it to a friend who is undergoing chemo and he really enjoyed...even asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing this all-star recipe!

The recipe was great. The rice was a little overcooked though. Probably because I had to microwave the chicken for it to be fully cooked. Hence, the rice was overcooked.

No worries though - the flavors in the dish were delicious. I substituted the cream with water. And the butter with cooking oil. All in all, it was a success! Just wish I hadn't cooked the rice for too long. Otherwise, yum.

I got a TON of compliments on this soup. I doubled the recipe; was only able to find 6.5 ounce packages of quick cooking  long grain and wild rice - used two and it was awesome! I also added one bunch of celery and a package of carrots (diced and sauteed for a few minutes before adding the rest of the broth, water, and chicken. 
Next time I make this (and there definitely will be a next time) I plan to add diced potatoes and corn. LOVED it.

Absolutely one of the best soup I've ever made. I followed the recipe almost to a T. I used half and half instead of heavy cream because that's what I had. I didn't have packaged wild rice mix with a flavor packet , so I used 1/4 c of wild rice mix and added chicken base for flavor. I also added small diced carrots and onions.  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed others' tips and sauteed garlic, onions, celery, and mushrooms to add to my soup.  Also, I bought plain wild rice without a seasoning packet, so I used my usual cajun seasoning   for this soup. Otherwise, everything else was the same.  My family LOVED it!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I liked the final product... i misread the instructions saying you need the rice with a seasoning packet, and since i already have instant rice, i didn't but anymore.  
I added mushrooms, celery, onions, garlic and carrots. it could honestly have done just fine without the celery, as they were still so crunchy. 
I also added sage and accidentally added poultry seasoning thinking it was sage. 
it needed added salt and pepper at the end and i added siracha to my bowl.

Im not sure how this would be if i didn't alter it so much, so i gave it 4 stars because it seems like it would be very bland but my end result was really nice.

I added in mushrooms but other than that, didn't change a thing.  This soup is fantastic!  And will definitely be making it again!

I made this with BrownSugarGirl's recommendations (minus the wine). It's amazing. Probably the best soup I've ever made!

I agree with the other posters to add onion and garlic. I also added carrots. I just used plain wild rice and added chicken broth (homemade) and regular milk just to  make it a bit healthier. I think this recipe is good to use as a base and it still turned out really nice and comforting!

So easy to put together. Tasted fantastic. Used a lot less flour (I don't like real thick soup.) This will be my go to recipe for chicken soup.

I make this all the time whenever it gets cold outside, it's requested !  I dont change anything, we love it as it is.    So satisfying and delicious.
I almost always use rotisserie chicken for a quick dinner.

I thought it had really good flavor. I added carrots,  celery,  onions  and garlic.  I did think it was a bit too thick. Maybe less flour next time.  Other than that, it was delicious!

The best and easiest soup recipe ever!  I went with carrots, celery & mushrooms. I used 1% milk instead of cream and pre cooked my rice, so only used 4 cups chicken broth and omitted the water.   This will be a staple in my routine. Yum!

This is the best chicken and rice soup I have ever tasted. It's great as is but I do use milk instead of heavy cream just as my preference. I think this is one of those that tastes even better the second day.

This recipe is great! I read the reviews and added about 1/2c of carrots, celery, and onion with garlic. Then used 1% milk and 1/2c flour and added 1/2c white wine and everyone loved it!

Just got done making this for dinner tonight. I made a few changes, well better yet additions. I used bone-in chicken and added it to the broth and water. To this I also added approximately 1/2 cup of each celery, carrots, and onions chopped.  Also two cloves of garlic minced. Then I brought it to a boil and turned it down to simmer for approximately 30 minutes. I then removed the chicken and sat it aside to cool, so I could pick the meat off the bones while I was making the roux. Add the chicken back in right before I added the cream mixture. Turned out wonderful!

This is so easy and so good. The rice mix makes this tasty and super easy.  Only thing I did different was to saute some diced carrots and celery until soft and add them to the soup....

One of my favorite recipes on this site and my 17-year old son's favorite meal.  I add 1/2 C of dry white wine and carrots, sometimes celery. Served with fresh baked bread, it is declicious.

Followed other reviews suggestions of sauteeing a mirepoix first (onion, celery, carrot, plus garlic) before adding chicken (rotisserie) and broth. had a somewhat bigger box of rice, so added a little extra water. Followed instructions for making the roux, except used 2% milk and a little less than 1/2 c. of flour. Added white wine (1/2 c.) after combining the broth and roux mixture. DELICIOUS.

LOVED this!!!!!  So did my two year old.  ??. I used rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts and vegetable broth because it's what I had on hand (6 cups) and one cup water.  I also added canned peas and carrots at the end.  We need to have some vegetables with our soup!  It was delicious...saving to my favorites!!

This was great. To make it quicker/healthier we added some veggies (onion, celery and carrots).  Skipped the butter. Just cubed the chicken instead of shredding and skipped the roux (just whipped cream and flour together and stirred in while boiling at the end.)

Absolutely delicious! I've been making this for awhile, and we love it. I add chopped garlic, onions, celery, carrots, 1/2 cup of white wine and some curry. Taste gourmet! I've made it with the cream, and I've substituted milk. Either way is great. It is a tad more rich & creamy with the cream, but still great with milk. Thanks for the recipe!

This was yummy!  I substituted 2% milk for the heavy cream (only because I didn't have any heavy cream at the time).  I also added chopped carrots, celery and onion.  It was so smooth and sumptuous, even without the heavy cream - I'll definitely make it again.

Made the rice separate and cooked the celery in the chicken broth and added 3/4ths flour and it was AMAZING. I'm going to try onions next time but definitely a once a month meal

This was just the chicken and wild rice soup recipe I was looking for! It was creamy, hearty, and delicious! I added carrots, celery, and onion and just cooked that in the chicken stock and water until tender. Then I followed the recipe after that. My family gave it two thumbs up! I'll definitely be adding this recipe to my regulars.

After following the recipe the first time I thought it was very good.  However, after a few changes I yielded a bit better results and flavor.  I found the  instant rice was a little too gummy for me so now I use the regular cooking rice blend and it was much better .   I also added celery and carrots. I have made this recipe many times now and love it.

This is very good. Similar to Panera's. I used a rotisserie chicken and added carrots, celery, onion, 3 cloves of garlic, and a chicken bullion cube. Very satisfied!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I do modify it a little and use half and half instead of heavy cream and I also add some celery and carrots in there to give it a bit more substance.  We always serve it with cheesy garlic bread.  So yummy!

I have made this several times and I am never disappointed.  I also make a few modifications such as using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and add all sorts of veggies for variety.  Asparagus is absolutely delicious with this soup!

Cooked my chicken in the crock pot, then made the roux on the stove after I sautéed the onions and mushrooms I added. Then added this rich and creamy roux to the crock pot and et it simmer about 10 minutes. Wonderful! Thank you for sharing such a simple and delicious recipe!

I love this recipe with leftover turkey instead of chicken.  I also agree with other reviews to cut back on flour - the soup does get extremely thick.

This soup is wonderful and full of flavor. I had to make some adjustments as it was a little too creamy for my taste. The flour was too much, so I reduced it 1/4-1/2c stirring it in slowly. Omit the salt, sauté some  onions, celery and carrots before adding the liquids. I also use rice milk and earth balance butter as we are dairy free. Still turns out great!

I make this to take to ski lodges in a food thermos, and to cozy up with in a mug on movie nights.  The one change I suggest making is to use 2 percent milk instead of the cream. Yesss we know cream is delicious, yesss it makes this recipe insanely good, but your heart, yo.  It's already a pretty inflammatory recipe.  Also- I usually get the regular long-cooking rice version of the Uncle Ben's mix and just cook it beforehand according to the box directions then dump it in. Fan.tas.tic.

I have made this soup twice.  Once as written which I thought wasn't my favorite and once with adding the sautéed onions, carrots, and celery.  I liked it much more with the addition of the vegetables.  It was easy to make especially as I added the precooked Swanson's frozen chicken chunks.

It's 16 degrees today so I decided this would be a good hot comfort dish and I was right! Absolutely delicious and pretty easy to make.  Of course, I did make a few adjustments.  I only used 6 T butter and that was plenty. I also cut up carrots and celery and added to the chicken/broth mixture. I boiled that mixture a little longer to soften the veggies and added 1 extra cup of broth.  I also used 1-1/2 c of 2% milk and 1/2 c half and half as I thought heavy cream would be too heavy. I used a rotessiere chicken.  It makes a lot so I'm hoping I can freeze some. It's a keeper.

I make this hearty soup year round and it's always a hit with my husband! Like any home cook, I've added and subtracted as I saw fit and did what works for my family. For starters, I added veggies--celery, onion, garlic, and carrots. The extra touch adds a lot of flavor! Oftentimes, I make this as a spur of the moment dinner because it's so quick and easy. This leads me not always having fresh chicken breasts thawed and ready. In the event this happens, I add frozen diced chicken breasts (we buy it for salads) and throw it in before adding the roux. It works perfectly and makes a quick dinner even quicker.

Very good soup! Like others, I added a few extra things. sauteed    some onions, carrots, and garlic in olive oil. I also only used 1/2 a cup of flour and I used 2% milk. Use Uncle Bens rice, not quick cooking. Therefore, I didn't use any water.

Super yummy! I first sautéed half a cup each of celery and carrot and 3 cloves of garlic. I used no sodium chicken broth, 2 cups half and half and only 1/2 cup of pepper. I omitted the salt. It was very thick and creamy and so yummy!

Good flavor.  I added corn and a little bit of precooked brown rice.  It's a little thick, so I thinned it with regular milk and a little chicken stock.  Family like it a lot.  Good for cold winter days.

This was great, followed recipe fairly closely. Sautéed garlic, butter and carrots, celery and green pepper  then added to soup for cooking period. Was pretty thick, would probably use 1 cup milk 1 cup heavy cream next time

Easy, yummy !  My kids loved it!
Go light on the salt until you taste it.  The seasoning pkt from the rice adds a fair bit of salt.

This has become one of my husband's favorite soups. The original recipe would get three and a half stars, but my tweaks make it a five for us. The modifications I've made  for our tastes are:  only 2-4 Tbsp butter, melted, that I saute carrots and celery in;  I use all broth (no water), some of which is  stock I make from the bones, etc. of the rotisserie chicken; two bags of Carolina (Mahatma) long grain and wild rice with the seasonings all mixed in;  1/4 cut flour and 1 cup half-and-half. No salt or pepper into the pot, but anyone is free to add it when they scoop their bowl. Sometimes I'll saute mushrooms (white or cremini) after the carrots and celery have softened.

This recipe is great. I added 
1 cup chopped onion,  1 cup chopped celery....I sauteed tehm all in butter first until tender before continuing with the rest of the directions in the same pot.

 The rest of the recipe works great...!

I think the chicken really didn't have flavor but the rest wasn't bad. I will just do a few things next time. Still good for cold days here in Tennessee.

This is an absolute staple in the autumn and winter in my house. But I turn it into an apple chicken wild rice stew. I throw in a couple of tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, parsnips, more carrots, and sliced up apples. I also shred the chicken instead of cubing it.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I loved this soup and so did my kids! I doubled recipe and froze half . The only addition I made was to saute onion, garlic, carrots and celery before adding broth. Really added some great flavor and texture. I think I would like to add green chilies next time. This is now my go to soup, plus the kids love it!!!

Pretty good. I cooked the rice & chicken separately cause I wasn't sure the rice would cook properly. I also put in 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I don't know if it was the seasoning packet I had (rice a roni) but it kind of had a store bought flavor. Still it was pretty good!!

Wow! This is really great - I am not a wild rice fan but my husband loves wild rice soup. I have tried several recipes never really finding one worth trying twice. This is it! My husband said it was as good a most restaurants, and it freezes great too!

I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did add a cup of frozen mixed  vegetables when adding the rice.  It came out perfect. It made it more hearty.  Both of my boys loved this dish; even my husband who doesn't like veggies enjoyed it.??

I made this and the flavor was delicious!  However I used homemade chicken stock and unfortunately miscalculated and made too much stock so the soup is too thin.  Any suggestions for thickening the soup?

Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's quite yummy and quick and easy to prepare :)

Next time I will thin it out a bit by using 2% milk instead of so much heavy cream; and I'll use less butter. However, as is it's very thick and yummy and made a large amount of soup.

Followed the recipe with the suggested changes.  Sautéed the celery and shredded carrots.  Tried to halve the butter as others did, but the roux turned dough like.  Did not add all the flour and had to add more butter and some water.  Family loved.  Husband described as "restaurant quality."  Will definitely make again!

Ok... First time I made this I used milk instead of half and half and it was perfection. I just made it for the second time using half and half and I'm not nearly as big a fan as I was.

Excellent recipie.  I add sautéed carrots, celery and onions and use skim milk instead of cream.  Still turns out thick, creamy and delicious.

Nice hearty soup!  I gave 4 stars only because it could use a little extra seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  I used a rotisserie chicken and used some of the stock from the container to add a little more flavor.

This is now one of our favorite soups!  The only changes I make are whole milk instead of heavy cream (does not seem to make a difference)and I now add carrots, celery and onion to add some veggies.  This is a very easy and filling soup!

Excellent soup with a few modifications. 

Cook 1 c. each of onion, carrot, celery in oil. Add mushrooms before adding broth, water and chicken. 

Cut flour to 1/4 c. Cut butter to 1/4 c.

Great recipe, but we all thought is was really short on the rice. I'll double if not triple the rice next time. Also added 1 cup frozen carrot coins which I would highly recommend doing. I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on the fat and was very happy with the consistency. For shredded chicken, I always just throw it in the crockpot in the morning with some chicken broth. It makes this any easy week night meal. With these small tweaks, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Definitely more than 5 stars.  We followed the directions exactly, except we added sautéed onion, carrots and celery (about 1/2 c each).  The flavor and consistency was perfect and our entire family (including our picky toddler and preschooler) loved it!

I sautéed onions, carrots and celery to add at the start. I also used 2% milk instead of cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I rarely use boxed mixes, but in the interest of time and wanting to stay (sort of) true to the recipe the first time making it, I went with Uncle Ben's wild rice mix. 2 of 3 people eating this loved it and had seconds, while the 3rd person (me) thought it was good, but not "eyes rolling back in your head" good.  I intend to make this again, but will make my own seasoning mix to see if that gets my taste buds all "a tingle".  I highly recommend giving it a try...it's highly rated for a reason.

What a nice soup! I did as other reviews suggested, adding sautéed celery, onion and carrots to the soup. I made no other changes and the whole family loved it. Will be making this again.

Quick, easy and delicious! I added some sautéed onion and carrots, along with a little garlic powder and it turned out great. Only problem was I should of made a double batch! You can't go wrong with this recipe

Great recipe! My husband loves this soup!  I added mushrooms, carrots and onions.  It seemed alittle too salty for me, so maybe next time I will use no added salt butter or chicken broth.

I make a lot of soup, and this is now my favorite soup recipe with a few added changes. I add diced onion, celery, carrot and sliced mushrooms. I cut the roux by about half and it's still thick. It's also great with leftover turkey. Absolutely delicious!

I was looking for some comfort food as I was not feeling well.  This recipe seemed pretty simple so I tried it as soon as I got home.  The only changes I made was Milk instead of cream and I added an Italian Mix of frozen vegetables.  My sister-in-law and I ate two bowls and wanted more.  Highly recommend.  This was quick and easy!

Really good....with variation! I didn't have heavy cream so used 2% milk and it was plenty thick and rich (although the texture and flavor of cream I'm sure would be better). Also added a small onion, chopped celery, carrots, and fresh garlic.

My family LOVES this soup. The only thing I do differently is make the roux first and then whisk in the broth and simmer till it begins to thicken. After that I add other  ingredients  plus some shredded carrot and simmer.

Delicious and easy soup. I also added carrots and celery and based on other reviews used milk instead of heavy cream and it was still very thick and creamy.

Very good (and easy) soup.  A little salty for me - next time I won't add the salt and just allow the salt from the wild rice packet to do the salting for me.  (hubbie didn't mind the salt level, I'm just sensitive)  TOTALLY agree that some veggies would elevate this to a whole new level - I'd suggest a single veggie, maybe carrot or broccoli - to keep it simple.  Also, used 1 c half and half and 1 cup 2% milk because I didn't have cream - and it was still awesome.  Will definitely make again.

So good.   Some modifications: Added an onion, celery and carrots to the pot first before adding the broth.  Only used 1/2 cup of flour and 6 or so tablespoons of butter.  I also subbed the cream for 1% milk.  Used plain cooked wild rice in at the end as I don't like prepackaged rice mix.

Spices used were turmeric, lemon pepper, cayenne pepper and some basil.

I was really excited to try this recipe, considering all the great reviews, but it did not meet the hype. There is too much butter, so some of it just sits on top where you can taste it-disgusting. I would call this a comfort food because of the amount of fat, but it isn't something I would want to come home to after a bad day. Maybe with less butter and added vegetables this recipe would be better

I love chicken and wild rice soup. I have been searching for a good recipe for a long time and finally landed on this one...only to be disappointed. I followed it exactly and it turned out way too thick and way too flour-y. I added onions and carrots to the butter and seasoning mix because it adds more flavor. But after adding in the 3/4 cup of flour I had to put in more butter, which is probably because of the veggies. By the time I followed the recipe and it was done, I took a taste test. Holy flour and cream batman! I added another cup of stock and white wine and more salt and pepper. Still didn't taste right :( The search for the perfect wild rice soup is still on.

I took the advice of so many others and sautéed about a cup each of celery and carrots. I always use a rotisserie chicken for this recipe and used 1 cup cream and 1 cup 2% milk. I can never find the listed  size of rice so I use the slightly larger Uncle Ben's brand 6+oz. Works just fine but I do have to cut back on the flour to compensate. Comes out very thick and creamy. Everyone loves it and as a result it never lasts long!

This is a good recipe. I made some changes. I omitted the chicken broth and used chicken bouillon cubes. Six of them. Omitted the salt. Added sour cream, grated parmesan cheese, and green onions, corn, peas and carrots. With four cups of water. Also omitted the flour. If you want a thicker soup add more rice. Served it with garlic bread. Yum!

Excellent soup. Very hearty and filling. I did not use heavy cream but used half and half and  it turned out great. I can't imagine it would have turned out better had I used it. It gets thick as it sits, but adding a little bit of regular milk when reheating solved that problem. I would definitely make this again.

Not really a review, but my record for myself for what  I did so I know how to get a great pot of soup again! Kids loved it.  Cooked 1 c of long grain wild rice (not a seasoned packet) according to directions and set aside. I chopped 1/2 an onion and sauteed it with 3 stalks chopped celery in olive oil and butter. Added 2 tsp garlic to that. Had 3 long chopped carrots (about 18 baby) cooking in 4 c of chicken broth till tender. Added about 1 1/2-2 c of chopped cooked chicken that I had on hand to the broth, then added celery and onion. Made a roux by melting 1/2 c butter in skillet, stirring in seasonings: poultry seasoning, white pepper, herb chicken seasoning and chopped fresh parsley, along with about 2/3 c of flour. Then added about 2/3 c of heavy cream to that. Stir rice and roux into soup mixture. Was a hit!

I added more salt and pepper.  I also added old bay seasoning to this recipe and it really gave this soup the extra touch that was missing.  Without the old bay, I'd give the soup 3 stars because the soup had too much of a milky taste without the extra seasoning.

Made it with leftover turkey I had in the freezer. Also, added a splash of wine and since I didn't find the flavour packet I added cumin, ginger and turmeric just as another reviewer suggested.  My family loved it.  Especially since it snowed today. Comfort food!

If I was the only person in my household rating this recipe, I would also likely give it more like 4.5 to 5 stars. But The Hubbs just doesn't get that excited about any soup. As a "food group," soup is more like a beverage to him. So, when I say that he gave this one between 3-4 stars, it really means something. I made it almost "as-written." I "took some help" from a little more than half of a rotisserie chicken and I added about a 1/2 cup (maybe a little more) of peas and carrots for color. I REALLY enjoyed this one. Next time, the biggest change I would probably make is making the roux in a larger pan -- I just didn't give myself enough room. But there certainly WILL be a next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

YUM!   I had to adapt for gluten/dairy free diet restrictions but still amazing!  My picky kid loves it.    
I followed several of the reviews that suggested sauteeing onion, garlic and adding celery and carrot to the broth mixture.
I used earth balance dairy free butter,   and cashew milk to sub the dairy,   gluten free all purpose flour (similar to better batter) for the flour. Thickened up very nicely!
I couldn't find the wild rice w seasoning so I had to wing the seasonings- I used onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper,  cumin, ginger.  SO maybe it isn't a review of this recipe anymore,  but at least an excellent adaption for the gluten/dairy free!

I used a rotisserie chicken and followed the advice of others--garlic, 1/2 cup each of onion, carrots & celery.  Also, 1/2 cup flour and used 1% milk.  Since I accidentally bought 25 minute rice, I boiled it separately without the  flavor package and added it to the soup (no extra water) as suggested.  With these changes/methods, the soup is a SOLID 5!!!

Awesome!!!  My go to winter soup for 2 years. I usually add some slices of carrot (canned) for color and to get a veggie in for kids. Love to take to friends also. I am picky about leftovers but this gets eaten up days after in my house.

Delicious! Definitely needed to add veggies carrots, celery, onion before broth, water and chicken. Only needed quarter cup butter & quarter cup flour otherwise roux would be too thick. Added another half cup water and whole milk, didn't use heavy cream.
I love rice so I added a second box but only one packet of seasoning. Also added quarter cup good dry white wine last 10 minutes of cooking time. Topped with black pepper. Had enough for an army sharing it with the neighbors shoveling out the northeast snow again!

This soup is amazing! I increased the serving to 18 because the wild rice packages were 6 oz. I also added 2 lbs of fresh sauteed mushrooms. Campbell's has nothing on this creamy yummy soup!  THANK YOU FOR THIS FANTASTIC RECIPE.

This was so yummy.  I made as directed since I believe it is unfair to rate a recipe you haven't even tried in the original form. LOL!  That said, I loved it as is and know that it will also be a great base for fun experimentation.  This is a keeper. I made this on a night when we had had a lot of surprise snow. It was such a nice snowy night dinner!

This was the best soup I have ever had! The only changes my husband made were the addition of a couple diced carrots and celery. We also used half and half in place of the heavy cream and all chicken broth & stock instead of broth and water. It was so delicious. This will be a regular at our house on these cold nights. Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe.

The recipe made as original is very good, but some additions push it into 5 star & pay for it at a restaurant.  here's my changes.  I fried up 6 pieces of bacon, then sautéed 1/2 an onion, same amount of celery & carrots & 8 oz of sliced mushrooms plus garlic in the bacon grease.  My family felt that the one box of Rice a Roni wasn't enough, so I added a 2nd.  The white sauce made w/ the flour, Half & half needed a bit more seasoning, so I added a grating of nutmeg, a handful of sharp shredded cheddar and my secret ingredient, 2 shakes of ancho chile powder, which doesn't add any heat but adds a depth of flavor that you can't explain. Oh & don't forget to dice the bacon & add it in!  YUMMY!

I've made this soup 3 times now and always love it!  I used 1 cup of fat free half and half and one cup of whole milk and it was still very creamy.  Next time I'll cut the butter in half.  Love the wild rice flavor!

This is not a review, it is a question.  I won't be getting a "packet of spices that comes with the rice" so I am wondering if anyone has an idea of how to replace that with your own spices and have it come out tasting the same.  Thanks

Oh this soup is fantastic! I took reviewer Carrie's advice; sautéed onion, garlic, carrot & celery before adding chicken broth. I reduced flour to 1/2 cup & reduced butter to 6 T. I didn't have wild rice on hand so I used 1&1/3 cup minute rice & found a recipe for my own seasoning blend. I didn't have cream so I used whole milk.
If you're hesitant about this recipe, just do it. I haven't had creamy chicken & rice soup this good since childhood. This stuff will warm your bones on a cold night & make your tummy very happy! This is now one of my go to soups. Thanks so much for sharing your delicious recipe!

Needed something quick using things I had on hand. Actually used a small can of turkey & chicken. (wasn'tsure jow that would be, but it was fine).  Also sautéed onion & celery. I would have added carrots, but didn't have any... For the rice I used Uncle Ben's pre cooked long grain & wild rice (in the bag).  Used regular milk I stead of cream. REALLY enjoyed this soup!  It was a cold, damp night. This warms you from the inside out!  I cut up some sharp cheddar cheese chunks to nibble on along with the soup.

Made this last weekend and it was easy and delicious.  To make it more healthy, I used reduced sodium chicken broth, did not add salt, and used half & half and 1% milk instead of the cream.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms the last 15 minutes of cook time.

We really enjoyed this soup BUT I did add sauteed carrots, celery, onions and mushrooms. We like veggies in our soup. I also subbed one of the cups of heavy cream for skim milk to cut some fat and calories. I reduced the flour to a half cup but I should have used the recommended amount of flour because I would have liked this soup to be a bit thicker. Regardless, this soup served with some fresh warm bread is a meal that can't be beat. I'll definitely be making it again.

It is a hearty recipe. I made the changes that many others suggested by adding 1/2 cup chopped carrots, 1/2 cup chopped celery, 1/2 cup chopped onion and minced garlic to taste.  I also decreased the flour to 1/2 cup.  I chose to replace the heavy cream with 2 cups of 1% milk.  The soup was still rich and creamy.

Took a bit longer then stated to complete. Used prior recommendations added 1/2 cup each of diced onion, peppers, and carrots sautéed in olive oil. Kept everything else the same and it turned out great. A soup good enough to fix for company!

I have made this about 10 times now and it is a huge hit with guests. Definitely a winter or fall dinner though, very hearty. I add sautéed mushrooms and sweet kernel corn and serve it over honey cornbread. Sometimes I'll also add shredded carrots. Fresh ground peppercorn and sea salt on top. Super yummy. Very simple recipe and always delicious, it just takes some prep work.

This was fantastic! I added some kale, mushrooms and onions and sauteed those with olive oil and used milk instead of heavy cream and less salt.  Turned out perfect!

I am only giving 4 stars due to modifications made...but what an awesome base recipe!!  I am certain it would be great "as is", but I kind of combined this with another recipe found on site and then followed some suggestions made by others.  I used 3 chicken breasts(boiled in homemade veggie broth), homemade chicken broth, Minnesota wild rice (cooked in chicken broth/water), sautéed celery, carrots and shallots in olive oil...added fresh mushrooms. I also used whole milk as opposed to the heavy cream and added about 3/4 cup of white wine the last 15 minutes. It was super tasty!!

After reading several reviews, I decided to make the following modifications.  First, sautee about 1 c. onion (minced) with 4 garlic cloves (minced) in some olive oil.  Then add a 14.5 oz can sliced carrots (drained & cut into smaller pieces) and sautee it for a couple more minutes before adding it to the broth, water and chicken. I also use low sodium chicken broth, 8.5 oz of wild rice, 1/3 cup whole wheat flour, 5 tbsp. butter, and 2 cups 1% milk.   I also get a small cooked whole chicken from the grocery store and use the chicken from that.  I added 1/4 tsp Lawry's seasoned salt (in addition to the 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper that the recipe calls for).  The result is a thick and creamy soup that is A-MAZING!!!

This was delicious!  I added carrots, celery, onion and some a few diced garlic cloves the second time I made it.  I didn't have the instant rice so I used long grain wild rice and cooked it in chicken broth.  Also added some Thyme.  Great recipe by its self or alter it to your taste.  Thanks for sharing.

This is so good and easy. I made it in a crockpot, put uncooked chicken breasts, broth, rice, seasonings, onion, celery, and carrots.  I added extra chicken broth and onion salt.  When I was ready to serve it I made the roux.  Could add more rice. Reviews say cut back flour and use milk instead of cream.

Best recipe ever! The only thing I do different is add onions to the chicken broth and chicken and let it simmer for 10 min. My 7 year old son loves this in a bread bowl. I also made a large stock pot of this soup for my church's Christmas party. Lets just say there were no  left overs!

This was really great! I have to give it 4 stars because I altered it considerably. I only had regular wild rice, no prepackaged quick cooking. So, I cooked that ahead of time. I sauteed onions, carrots and celery in the butter. After sauteeing them until starting to get tender, I sprinkled the flour in and stirred for a minute. Then I added the chicken broth, water and 1% milk. Since I didn't have a prepackaged rice, in addition to salt and pepper, I added paprika, garlic salt (next time I'd just saute garlic with the veggies, I forgot), oregano, sage and a little turmeric for the yellow coloring. I stirred that and brought it to a boil. I stirred in the chicken, lowered the heat and let simmer for 15 minutes. I stirred in wild rice and served. It was a huge hit! My aunt in Wisconsin made us chicken and wild rice soup from a package, this was a great base that allowed us to enjoy the flavor without all the extra sodium. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this soup!! I didn't have a package of seasoned rice so I precooked some wild and basmati rice and added 3/4 cup of the rice to the soup with some spices I mixed up.  I used one cup of heavy cream and I cup of milk.  They soup was awesome, kids loved it too.

Fantastic flavor.  Mine was pretty thick. Took it for a soup cook off but didn't win - probably because it was so thick.  Had several tell me they loved this one more than all the others though.

I love this recipe. I had some leftover turkey meat from Thanksgiving so I used that instead of chicken and it still tastes yummy. This is the perfect comfort food for cold weather.

This is a great, simple recipe to make.  I took the suggestions of others and added carrot, onion, celery and garlic.  I also used half and half in one batch and the other I used 2% milk, both turned out fine with great flavor.  This is a keeper!   A  "comfort" soup worth sharing!

Delicious! And it should be with the amount of butter and cream that is in this. But it is very filling so you don't eat a lot. I made according to directions. The only criticism I would have for this recipe is that the "10-15 min until heated through" turned out to be "until rice is burned on the bottom. Make sure you stir ever couple min or turn the heat down.  Came out to 6 very heavy bowls.

I need a few modifications to this recipe: I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, I added frozen peas and I added canned mushrooms. I also put in a bit of garlic. This recipe is very tasty and very good but not the most filling. It would be good to include bread for a more filling meal.

Great recipe, my whole family loved it!!! I was looking for something easy to make and eat for my son after getting orthodontic work. I did saute chopped carrots, onions and celery with garlic before adding the broth, I used 2 boxes of the rice mix/seasoning, 2% milk instead of cream and cut the butter in 1/2.

Delicious! Second time I made this,  I doubled the rice because I wanted it thick and added some onion, carrot and celery, finely chopped. Both got rave reviews.

Modifications:
1 cup carrots
1/2 cup celery
1 onion
1 clove garlic
5 slices bacon 

I sautéed the veggies in the bacon fat until tender then added them right before the roux. Right before serving I added the bacon and fresh thyme. It was amazing!

Soup is yummy.  I added a teaspoon of poultry seasoning and a couple dashes of sage.  I also used 2% milk. We love it.

Awesome.  Loved it.  My mom said it was the best wild rice soup she ever ate and said I could make it for her anytime I wanted.  Would go perfect with homemade bread bowls.  Great cold day meal.  Leftovers tasted just as good.

The only changes I made to this soup is quadrupling the recipe, which amounts to a full stock pot, and I added carrots and celery. This is hearty, a fabulous meal on its own, and never fails to satisfy. Everyone from my picky nephew to my food-loving father-in-law raved about this soup. Love it!

Loved it!!! I added celery, carrots,mushrooms and onion.  Seasoned my flour with cilantro, thyme and tarragon.  For extra liquid and flavor, I added mushroom broth (Harris Teeter brand).  DEE-LICIOUS!!!

This is the first time I tried to make a creamy recipe so I kept to the original (cream part) with lots of butter and heavy cream.  I changed a few things with the hearty ingredients though: I used 1lb ground turkey; browned it with onion and garlic. I put in fresh spinach for color and during the simmer portion I added one more box of rice-a-roni wild rice (without the packet), 1 cup of celery and 1/4 cup of white wine like one reviewer did and this came out amazing.  My waistline has increased in size just after one sitting but it was so darn delicious!! Next time I will reduce the butter and use 2% milk. Thank you for this!

Used almost two boxes of long grain rice. Also, just used milk instead of cream and tasted great. Can use frozen carrots, but fresh taste better.

Followed the suggestions of others, added chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery, and also added a chopped red pepper, since I had one.  

I used leftover rotisserie chicken, and put the bones in the 2 cups of water and let them boil together while I made the roux.  After I took the bones out, it looked a bit lower than 2 cups, so I added some wine.

YUM!  Many thanks to all, especially the original submitter!

This turned out great! I made a few tweaks, though: I used instant rice instead of wild. For the seasoning, a mix of paprika, parsley, seasoned salt, pepper and garlic. I also sauteed mushrooms, celery and carrots and added those (just add however many you like). This is the best recipe! Definitely a new family favorite!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I loved it! Since I can't eat grain flours, I used buckwheat (scant 3/4 cup), followed the directions and served the family with a loaf of bread - this was simply perfect, even my picky husband loved it.

This is the best recipe.  Made it three times this chilly winter and it's a hit every time. It's a filling meal with fresh bread and a side salad!  

No major changes - just personal preference:
1) I do add diced carrots & celery - they add some color
2) I used Uncle Bens Classiques Long Grain & Wild Rice mix - it has the seasoning packet and a dried veggies packet.
3) the flour and butter for the roux can be reduced...both for calories sake & the thickness
4) I've used milk and half and half in place of the heavy cream and both still make a very thick soup without the added calories.
5) I don't add any salt and used Campbell's 30% reduced sodium broth - the seasoning packet in the rice offers plenty of salt.

I'll be sad winter is almost over (NOT) as this is really more a fall/winter meal! Would be great to take to an après ski party or winter potluck!  Oh, and it does continue to thicken up - add a little more chicken broth and it won't dilute the flavor!!

Great recipe to start a soup with.  Like others I added sauteed onions, carrots and celery to the soup.  I used the Uncle Ben's Wild Rice mix and I did not use all of the flour for my roux, only used a 1/2 c. I also threw in sliced mushrooms towards the end. I made this for my family and in laws and they ate the entire pot!!

This is the most absolutely delish soup I've made! Had a few changes, add ons. Put carrots, celery and a little onion and crushed garlic in. I think that really adds to it. Used 1/2 cream and 1/2 1% milk and it just worked out perfect. My husband had 4 bowls hot off the stove. Used the Uncle Bens wild rice and whole seasoning packet and wouldn't change that as it worked out really good. Also just used a rotisserie chicken from the deli, cut up. Makes no difference at all!  Make this recipe! It's sooooo good!!!!!!!!

I used canned milk, as I didn't have cream. Still tastes great! Easy, easy recipe. I took the advice of using my leftover rotisserie chicken, so the meal was super quick. Will use this recipe often!

As is, the soup turned out to thick.  I didn't read the suggestions to cut back on flour and use milk instead of cream until after I made the soup.

I used this recipe as a base for my tastes. I took 1 qt of home made chicken stock and 4 whole,skinless,chicken legs,(legs and thighs separated),put them in the crockpot on low,and let them simmer overnight. In the morning I drained the legs,reserving stock, let cool,and picked & chopped the meat. In the crockpot I threw a whole 6 oz.package of brown & wild mix,into the already hot reserved broth. In a stock pot, I sauteed in 2 TBS olive oil, 1 whole leek,tougher parts of green top removed, 1 cup each celery hearts and carrots,chopped, and 6 oz. mushrooms,diced small, until tender. I added to the stock pot 1 qt of homemade chicken broth and reserved broth/rice mixture,chicken meat, & I brought all to a boil and let simmer. I add an additional 1/2 C. wild rice mix & cook until tender. I wanted less calories so I used 6 TBS unsalted butter and 1/2 C.flour to make roux, and add 2 C. 1 percent milk. This makes 12 servings, and was a big hit at a church pot luck. (Approx. 286 calories).

I've made this recipe several times now.  Always great.   I went to make it one day and didn't have a wild rice mix so I used Trader Joe's Rice Orzo and Pilaf mix.  It was delicious.

Such a great recipe! I first made it as written and it was delicious. The second time I tweaked it just a bit. I boiled my chicken for this recipe and used 2 cups of it's water instead of plain water.  I also used regular milk instead of the heavy cream and it was just as rich and hearty.

First time writing a review. This was so good! I added a few additions: 1/2c carrots, 1/2c celery and 1/2c broccoli. Also, I used a little less than the 2c heavy cream. The soup was very thick. The next day I heated it up with a good amount of water to make it thinner. Next time I will probably add an additional 1c water when making. Boyfriend said this is a keeper!

Amazing! My only change was that since I was doubling the recipe, I added 3 small onions and 1 celery heart sliced to the melting butter. This soup is so, so good and I'm known for my soup cooking.  Amy C. Greensburg, PA

Not a bad beginning, but it needs some serious work.  I added garlic powder, herbes de provence, celery and carrots and it was STILL bland.  Also, this soup was way too thick.  When I reheated the leftovers for lunch today it was a solid casserole!  It didn't thin at all when warmed.  Not awful, but not nearly as good as the rating would lead you to believe!

Fantastic flavor and heartiness! My 8 & 9 yr old picky eaters loved it. I had regular wild rice so I just cooked it separately. I sauteed a medium diced onion and 2 Tbs minced garlic in olive oil, then added a 1/2 cup of white wine and reduced a bit. Also, cut back the butter, flour and used skim milk. I added a Traders Joe's Cream of Mushroom soup because I didn't have mushrooms on hand and I love the flavor mushrooms add to a cream soup. Served this soup with crusty bread. I will make this over and over again!

It was very good, but like other cooks, I made some changes.  I used milk instead of heavy cream and just added more flour.  I reduced the amount of butter to 1/4 cup.  I added carrots, onions, mushrooms, and celery.  Uncle Ben's quick cooking rice makes it so fast and oh so delcious!

I don't normally review/rate recipes, but this was outstanding (with a few minor changes!)  I sauteed 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup chopped onion and chopped celery in olive oil and added to chicken broth mixture.  I also added 1/2 cup pinot grigio at the end. My 13 year old is extremely picky, and loved this.  This one is a keeper!

Used 2% milk and it turned out great. Only thing I'd change is using more wild rice vs the mix. Way too much white rice in it.

Was good. Will probably make again. I made some adjustment based upon what I had...just regular wild rice instead of box w/packet so I tried to create my own seasoning mix. Will try with box of rice & packet next time to see if even better.

My husband LOVED this soup. I halved the recipe and could'nt find quick cooking long grain wild rice so I cooked uncle bens rice mix in the broth after I sauteed chopped carrots celery and onion in some butter. Added the roux and it was really thick so I thinned it out a little with some milk. I used the entire flavor packet even though I halved the recipe. I garnished with some grated sharp cheddar but I don't think it added much to the soup. Having the leftovers tomorrow and I think I'll add crumbled bacon on top instead. My husband said it's a keeper, five stars! I thought it needed more depth of flavor but it was tasty.

I loved this soup. It was a little too rich for my husband I used milk not cream. I will try and make it again cutting back on the milk and using chicken broth to replace it.

I have made this 5 times and have loved it every time. I do add carrots and other veggies I have left over since I make it with left over roasted chicken that I made a stock out of the day before instead of box broth.

LOVED this recipe! I do agree that you need to add vegetables; it just helps make it thicker and seem healthier.

Wow is a good start!  This is excellent and everyone I shared it with agreed.  Since I love wild rice, I might add some of the pre-cooked type in with the soup.  It was amazing what the seasoning packet did to the roux.

Delicious - I sometimes use canned chicken from Kirkland.  I also add carrots and celery.  I use real wild rice instead of a box so I add a little bit of boullioun for flavor.  I use whole mild instead of cream.  It's a winner with my family!

Wonderful, warm and delicious soup.  A couple things that I did could only have improved on the original recipe.  I sauteed a big carrot, two stalks of celery, an onion and two garlic cloves in EVOO before proceeding to step two.  The next time I make this, I will be doubling up on the wild rice mix as the soup is pretty thin otherwise (creamy, but thin).  I also used a mixture of half and half and skim milk for the roux and didn't notice any negative effect.  Very nice recipe to play with.

I did add carrots, celery, and onion. While I would have preferred cream, I substituted fat free half and half and it was delicious. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Will be making this again, and again, and again... Added 1 onion, 1 stalk celery and 2 carrots (all chopped) like other reviewers and added 2 more tablespoons of butter while cooking them until they were softened. Wonderful with a hearty, crusty french bread!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. My family loved this. Even though it drives me crazy when people change the recipes and then rate them; I did make only slight changes only to save on calories. I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and used half and half in place of the whipping cream. Still yummy!!!

This was awesome! I sautéed cut up chicken breasts in olive oil, added onion, carrots, celery, and garlic - then added about 6 cups water and concentrated chicken broth - added rice, let it all simmer for about 30 minutes - I didn't do the whole roux, add cream and simmer step, I just melted 1/4 cup butter and added 1/4 cup flour, stirred till smooth and added the seasoning packet from the rice - dumped it in the boiling pot, and it thickened up great! I added cream, but really only about 1/3 cup, didn't measure just dumped in what I had left in the container! Turned out great, very thick and delicious! :)

We LOVE this recipe.  Mostly because it's so basic we change it to whatever we want. I've made chicken and rice with corn and carrots that was a huge hit with my kid.  I've also made a beef, carrots, and broccoli version.  Very hard to mess up and so easy to make your own!

I "tweaked" this recipe. I roasted a chicken early in the day and used the carcass to make my own chicken stock. I used 6 cups of my homemeade stock and omitted the 2 cups of water. I don't buy pre-seasoned rice, so I just cooked my favorite rice blend then added it to the hot chicken stock. After adding the chicken, rice and cream blend, I tasted and added 3 bay leaves, some turmeric and some Italian seasonings. Served this with some hearty dinner rolls and it was a hit!

I thought it was great & so did my family after I made a few changes.  I used half the amount of flour it called for.  The first time I made it following the directions, it was way to thick & I had to keep adding chicken broth.  I also added some carrots & celery to it.

Well,  these were good but not that great.  I was glad i added bacon to these, otherwise, the soup would've been okay.  The thing I've noticed that bothered me was the roux mixture.  Yes, it was creamy even though I used regular milk but all I could taste was the flour.  I'd rather add mashed potatoes or something else rather than the floury roux.

I followed the directions and added extra veg as others suggested and this soup just didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked. Instead of the old cornstarch trick, I added a packet of country gravy mix I found in my pantry. Worked like a charm and I think added a nice flavor. Will definately make again, but probably using my traditional method for soup making. The separate roux and liquid/rice threw me off. Great recipe overall though!

I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream to reduce the fat content. Overall it was a very hearty soup. Next time I'm going to add a few more spices to give it a little more flavor, but the base is amazing. Smells great when you're cooking it as well.

This is a huge hit with my kids! I also sneak in some extra veggies and nobody seems to mind. This is the soup that my 8 year old requests  constantly. I agree it is a a little thick and the milk does help when you heat it up. I've made many times and one time even substituted milk for the heavy cream and nobody even noticed.

I absolutely loved this soup! I was afraid it would turn out more like a casserole but it didn't. After looking over some reviews I made the necessary changes. I added sauted onion and celery in the beginning and I enjoyed the flavors and texture. This is one of my favorites and I'll be making this again. My oldest daughter gave it a thumbs up. This is a dish I'd be proud to serve at a casual dinner party.

GREAT with TONS OF CHANGES.  I cannot give a recipe five stars after I have pillaged it and transformed it into something almost unrecognizable from the original recipe. This soup is bland without serious help. Here's what I did to save mine: I sautéed half a sweet onion, 2.5 celery stalks, about 3 carrots and several mushrooms with 3 strips of Neman Ranch applewood smoked bacon and about 2 tablespoons of butter until tender. I transferred veggies to a paper towel to drain the grease & discarded remaining grease from the pan. I used about 1/4 cup white wine to deglaze the pan. I then added chicken stock, water and rice (after a boil). I used about 1/2 cup flour because I have no idea what kind of box of rice this author used -- I have never seen that size from Uncle Ben's or any other brand. I used a 6oz box so I decreased the flour. I used 1.5 cups heavy cream and the rest half and half. When I combined everything, I realized there was far too little rice for my liking. So I added one 90 second microwaveable Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice pouch, cooked. I also added about three tablespoons of Better than Bouillon (chicken flavor). I needed some additional salt and pepper and two good dollops more "salted" butter before FINALLY I had a restaurant quality soup. Nevermind it could choke Paula Deen it's so fattening & full of butter. I'll work on lightening it up next time. Anyhoo -- great recipe inspiration but not a great recipe without massive overhaul.

I enjoyed this soup very much.  The only SLIGHT change I made was adding carrots and I used milk instead of cream.  I have no doubt it would have been great if prepared exactly as written. This was an excellent fine and definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Awesome Restaurant Quality!  Made minimal changes....DOUBLE THE RECIPIE...YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!  Always start with a mirepoix(carrots,celery,onion)! Used a whold bag of finely chopped carrots and a whole bag peeled and finely chopped celery. You want the celery,carrots and onions to be a little bigger in size than the rice.  Fried those in a little oil for about 5 minutes then added 1 cup finely chopped onions to that mix and sauteed' for another 5.  Also used a rotisserie chicken that I shreded, leaving off the skin.  Also down graded the flour to 1/2 cup when making the roux'(flour and butter.  Note...you MUST add the liquid to the roux' NOT the roux' to the liquid or you will get lumps.  Also used a 6.5oz package of wild rice.  Outstanding soup! My daughter ate if for 3 days straight.  After sitting overnight, the soup became way too thick, but I just added more chicken stock and it was excellent.

I love Chicken & Wild Rice Soup - always been one of my favorites. I made this and it is awesome! Now I can have this more often as I have a good base recipe. I did make minor changes. I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream and I added celery and carrots. It was delicious. I would definitely add some milk when reheating because it thickens up a lot overnight in the fridge (but still tastes great!).

Made this the other night and my family devoured it. It was delicious. Next time, I might add in some peas and carrots, and use milk instead of the heavy cream as it was very, very rich.

One of the few recipes I make again and again! I sometimes add different veggies I have on hand. Tonight I'll throw some asparagus in it.

last night was the first time making this - two changes was I added carrots and onions but otherwise did as recipe said : ) How could this not be good - stick of butter & two cups cream? My husband LOVED it - I think it's good (yes 4 stars good) but a little too Paula Dean for me. it's very rich and as it sat got very thick - did add water to thin it out but my husband loves a thick soup. Over all will make again when my husband asks for it.

My family (including my two picky daughters) really loved this soup.  A friend shared the recipe and I've made it three times now.  One thing I would recommend is cutting down on the amount of flour.  I used 1/2 cup and I believe that 1/3 cup would be plenty.  The soup was almost too thick and less flour made it a little more soup-like.  I also used 1% milk instead of cream and it was just as tasty but obviously much healthier.  And for the chicken, I used a Costco rotisserie chicken.

It was very good. My fiance and I stubbled upon this when we were trying to find something to make that was simple, quick, and not too expensive (we try not to embody the college kid diet when we can).  He loved it! He calls this a "mom meal" which means definite keeper. It's great for cold days.

As written, I thought this recipe was just ok. The butter and heavy cream is way too much. I like a creamy soup as much as the next person, but this was way too rich. Next time we would eliminate the butter entirely and probably use half and half instead of heavy cream. We added carrots, celery, and corn because when we make soup we like it to be a complete meal. Without the added veggies I think this soup would be pretty boring. With modifications I think this can be a 5 star recipe, but not as written.

Absolutely delicious. I sauteed a package of sliced mushrooms in 1/4 cup of butter with two crushed cloves of garlic and added them to the soup before making my roux.

This soup is always a winner with our family. I double it so that my hubby has leftovers for lunch.  This is one of his favorite leftover lunches, too.  Although I double the soup, I don't always double the roux.  It just depends on how thick I want the soup.  Also, I put in some extra wild rice since we like more rice in our soup and there's never enough in the boxes.

Just made this for dinner and it was delicious.  My husband loved it!  Did a few things differently after reading the other reviews.  I sautéed an onion, once celery stalk and some chopped baby carrots in butter and garlic first.  Then added the broth and water, using an extra cup of water to make up for the added veggies.  I used the whole box of rice (6 oz.).  For the roux, I used 6 tbsp. of butter and less flour (about 1/3 cup).  Definitely recommend it!

I made the recipe according to directions, using top-quality ingredients.

Simply:  this soup is very good - but definitely falls short of "excellent".  Perhaps with changes mentioned by other reviewers it might graduate to "excellent" - but as directed, it is merely very good.

Warning:  during the final stage, make sure to stir frequently to avoid burning (and/or use low heat and/or a simmer plate).

My family LOVES this soup! I always make it using a rotisserie chicken from Costco and following the review written by naples34102. Also, I use regular rice instead of quick-cooking and it works just as well.

This is my go-to meal to bring to friends who just had a baby, surgery, or just need a little pick-me-up! Comfort food at it's finest. I say it's 5 stars as-is, but I do add some veggies to it. I saute 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped stalks of celery in olive oil, chopped onion and chopped garlic and add that in with the chicken.

Amazing! Me and my family love soup so I am always looking for a new recipe to try out. This was delicious! It was the perfect main course dish on a cold winter night. I made homemade bread bowls and served the soup in the bread bowls with freshly grated cheddar cheese on top and it was definitely a crowd pleaser!! A delicious comfort food that is on my recurring menu!

5 stars with the modifications suggested by a few people! I made this as healthy as possible by sauteeing lots of carrots and onion in olive oil and garlic, using skim milk, whole wheat flour (cut down to 1/2 cup as suggested), and cut the butter way down to 6 Tbsp as suggested. I also used real wild rice, so had to cook it most of the way before starting this recipe.
If you are used to eating healthy foods, you will not notice the lack of cream by using milk- in fact, I can't imagine using cream or it would have seemed too rich to me since I'm not used to eating like that. I also can't imagine the recipe without carrots and veggies. They are essential!

This soup was just wonderful! I followed the advice of others and added 1/2c. carrots, onion, celery, and two garlic cloves. sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil, then added the carrots and celery. Add this to your chicken/water/broth mixture and you're good to go! So delicious, and with the added ingredients it makes for a heartier soup. I also made homemade breadbowls in my breadmachine and it was fabulous. Great recipe.

This is now my go-to soup recipe. Its comes together quickly, especially when I use leftover chicken. I choose 1% milk, 1/2 cup flower, 6 tablespoons of butter and do add some carrots and celery like many others. I even add some quartered small tomatoes, 5 minutes before its time to eat. They add color and don't "feel mushy". Then I like to serve it in sourdough bread bowls (or small sub rolls). Its fun to eat and gets the wow effect.

Family approved! They all loved it a little more than I did in fact. This is the second time I've made it and they are all just as thrilled as the first time. I did add shredded carrots and some bullion for a little more flavor.

This soup is one of the best soups I've made. I didn't change a single thing and don't plan on modifying it at all when I make it again!

Easy to make and very delicious! Was in a hurry and used canned chicken. Will definitely make this again. Tasted like I put a lot more time into making it than I did!

Wonderful, tasty, simple recipe. Per other reviews, I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 1% milk and it was still extremely creamy and superb! I warmed up the tiny bit of leftovers for my lunch and only wish there was more. This will be made over and over in our house!

With a few tweaks, this was a wonderful soup.  It definitely needed veggies- carrots and celery were a must.  I sauteed these for a few minutes first with some onion.  Also- as another reviewer mentioned, 1% milk was rich enough in this creamy soup.  We will make this again- thanks!

Oh. My. Gosh. It's like heaven in a bowl!

I followed the recipe as closely as I could (chicken was not cooked; wild rice mix was not quick-cooking; half-and-half had to step in for heavy cream). My improvising did not detract from the deliciousness of this soup in any way. I look forward to making this again and again!

(I served it with garlic and cheese-style biscuits, like you-know-where serves. They were perfect together.)

02/12/2014: I made it again, using the quick-cooking wild rice mix this time, and was disappointed: the boxed wild rice mix makes substantially more rice and is much better seasoned, so I will stick with my variation from now on. To make up for the lack of rice, I added a tiny bit of white rice, diced celery (two ribs), and sliced up a couple of carrots. I also added more herbs and seasonings.

This is awesome! I have used chicken and turkey. I also froze a container and that reheated well...I have also added carrots. But it is great as is.

I am another fan of this soup recipe.  I made it for our family Latke night.  I made a double batch for 14 adults and there was only 1 cup of soup leftover when dinner was done.  Everyone loved that I cut the chicken up "very small", I didn't cut it any differently than I would cut it up for any soup, but that seemed to make everyone happy.  I have made it again and still loved it.  I did not make any changes and unlike some, I was able to find the rice in the proportion the recipe called for.

Very delicious! I only used wild rice, we never eat white rice. Also, I reduced the butter and used half and half for health purposes. Still very delicious and rich!

Pretty Good. I used skim millk instead of heavy cream. Used about half hte cutter. Used only 1/2 cup of flower. Added chopped clery and carrots to the broth. Very good and very thick even with the skim milk. Yes do add extra skim milk when reheating.

I'm a college student and I'm a total comfort food freak; my roommates and I absolutely love this soup. Add a bag of baby carrots to the broth and water when you boil it. It adds a little something extra!

Oh heavens this is good.  I used rotisserie chicken and chicken stock instead of broth.   I went all out with the cream and butter but I did add sautéed onion, carrot and celery to the chicken and broth (so much healthier, NOT).  I didn't add water, forgot it.  It was amazing.  I will pour it over a baked potato tomorrow and will feel so happy... thanks for the great recipe.

I made this soup incorporating reviewers' comments (adding onions, carrots, celery, garlic) and cutting down on the flour and butter.  It was absolutely outstanding and what I would consider restaurant quality or better!

I recently made this soup for my husband and wonderful but picky two year old son and they both devoured it. I used much less chicken broth due to that fact that I was pretty much out of it, and also only about a half a cup or so of heavy cream (subbed the rest out for 1%)added sauteed onions, carrots, celery, garlic powder, thyme, rosemary, and parsley....wasn't the exact recipe but this variation came out great!!! Although my husband loved how thick and rich the soup was the next time I think I'll use less flour.

Made this for the first time today and it was delicious, my family loved it! I followed every step of the recipe and it came out great. Although, I can see where a lot of people made modifications now. As I get more comfortable cooking this dish I will learn what to add, vegetables are a must next time! :)

GREAT soup. Noted the reviews to make it a little healthier- used only 1/2 cup of Half n' Half, and made the rue from the broth with only a little butter. Also sauteed some onion/garlic in the butter to start- really ramped up the flavor. Also to keep it easy, I used Rotisserie chicken and those "heat in the bag" Wild Rice packets. Everyone (including the kids!) loves this recipe and it makes plenty.

AMAZING! I would definetly recommend using leftover rotisserie chicken. It is the perfect thickness you'd expect for the ultimate comfort soup. It's a new family favorite.

This was a hit with my house! I followed the directions exactly, except I took some advice from a few of the critical reviews and added some carrots, celery, and onion so that it wasn't just rice and chicken. It turned out to be wonderful! I added about 4 large carrots, 1/3 of a medium yellow-onion, and a full package of celery hearts. Also, because I wanted the celery and carrots to be nice and tender and I was a little slow on what I was adding to the broth with the rice and chicken I boiled them on the side and added them in. I used the full 2 1/2 cups of heavy cream and I thought this soup was just wonderful! Thanks, Allrecipes!

Delicioso!! I made some changes after reading others reviews. First, I boiled rice with chicken stock (instead of broth) from the beginning to cook wild rice thoroughly. Reserve 2 cups of chicken stock and keep cold in fridge. Then, I added a chopped medium sized onion and carrot each and a drained 4oz of canned mushroom. I cooked them in butter until soft before adding flour. Most importantly, before adding creamy roux mixture into the pot, add 2cups of cold stock to the mixture to prevent lumps. Oh, I used half&half, also. This soup tastes like chicken tetrazzine in soup form :)

Ive been searching for a recipe similar to one that I used to enjoy at a local restaurant when I was young. I have since moved away from the city where that restaurant is located (if it's even still open.) This is IT! So incredible! So delicious! Absolutely perfect. No need to change anything. All I did was double it (oh, and I added some white rice because I really like my creamy chicken soup very rice-y.) Other than that, we are talking perfection here!

I used a box of Zatarains wild rice and added a little pork sausage. It was so good and even better the next day!

YUM! I added onions and carrots and when I cooked my chicken I had seasoned it with Weber Kick'n  Chicken seasoning so I guess I did make some slight alterations but not by much. Very creamy and tasty....and very easy but nobody will know by the taste.

I made this soup yesterday and it was amazing! I used 1% Milk instead of heavy cream and it was still super creamy.  I also added carrots, onion & celery after I softened them up in a little butter on the stove.  Next time I will reduce the amount of flour to 1/2 cup.  I ended up having to add more broth & water because the soup was getting too thick.  My husband & 4 year old loved it!  I served it with buttermilk buiscuits for dipping.  I will be making this again!

Yummy soup.  I take a short cut which always turns out fine for me.  (This can be a one pot soup!)  I finely chop garlic & onion which I add to the flour & butter.  After the roux is cooked I add the broth & water (but only 1 cup of water) & after stirred until smooth I add all the other ingredients saving the cream until last to get desired thickness.  Great with a jar of pimentos and fresh grated nutmeg added towards the end for a bit more flavor & color!

I decided to make this one night when my mother was busy and I felt like cooking something new.
Like the other reviews, I added some vegetables: chopped up carrots, green onions, a little red onion, mushrooms, celery, and two cloves of garlic, which I sauteed before putting in the soup. I also followed the advice of one review and used 2% milk instead of heavy cream, 6 tablespoons of butter, and only 1/2 cup of flour.
I didn't use the seasoning packet from the rice boxes, and I'm glad I made that choice. Instead I used some basil, celery salt, lemon peel, parsley leaf, a small pinch of oregano, and possibly a little bit of dill weed, all along with the salt and black pepper the recipe calls for.
When I sauteed the chicken, I added some pepper to it just to add a little flavor to the meat itself.

Overall, this soup was a big hit with the family. Out of a giant pot of soup, only one serving was left over. I will definitely be making this again in the dead of winter.

Very good but needs more flavor for my taste so next time I may add a few more spices and instead of cream use milk as others have suggested. My husband loved it the way it was!

This was very good, I made a few changes. I used whole milk and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter...i wanted to cut back on the calories. Also. I omitted the water and used 6 cups of chicken broth. I could not find the rice suggested so i used Uncle Ben's (8oz.)microwaveable wild rice in the pouch. Thank you for posting, I will definitley make this again. My family loved it!

Oh my!!!! Worthy of a 10-star rating. I love soup, and have some really good recipes...but this is absolutely spectacular!    I was nervous to make this quantity since there are only 2 of us, but it was so good it only lasted 2 meals.  I used chicken stock and a roasted chicken.  Couldn't find a 4.5 oz pkg of the rice so used 6.5 oz and increased water to compensate.  Next time I'll add sauteed mushrooms and  less flour, try milk rather than cream.  I loved the recipe, but it's sooo good I need to lighten it up just because this will probably be on the menu every 10 days or so this winter.  YUMMY!

WoW! This is delicious. I just used a cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli instead of the 2 chicken breasts. I was unable to find the 4.5 ounce package of rice, so I bought a 6.2 ounce box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice fast cook recipe. I didn't change the liquid amounts at all. I added the celery and carrots, decreased the amount of butter and flour, and used 2% milk instead of cream, as suggested by Carrie. Thanks for a delicious recipe. I impressed my in-laws and that's hard to do;)

To make this recipe gluten free, use corn starch instead of flour. Mix the corn starch in with a little water and then add directly to the pot, don't boil it with the butter. The corn starch will clump if you try to heat it with the butter in a pan.  I removed the butter and poured everything directly into the pot and boiled it there. The corn starch thickens it up, just keep adding until it's the thickness that you want.

This was amazing! It was my first soup recipe and I can't wait to make more. It was pretty easy and is a good base soup. I did add cooked peas and carrots since I was already making them for dinner and it just seemed right. Will make again and maybe add more ingredients. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this tonight and it was delicious.  I added fresh spinach to broth mixture.  I had seen it done that way in a restaurant.

Amazing soup, I'm sure it is great as is but I took the adjustments others made as well. Added carrots, celery and onion. I always add extra herbs plus I had extra chicken so I just upped the recipe, make a ton but surely wont go to waste. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This was very easy to make. The flavor was great but w/o the vegetable it seems a little lacking. So I added about 2 cups of mushrooms, and some carrots. Makes a ton of soup so we had plenty of leftovers. Great for cold days.

To bad I can't give this 6 or more stars. I added the onion, carrot and celery like many others. I put raw chicken breasts, chicken stock and veggies in a crock pot for the day. I then pulled out the veggies and put in a food processor. Next I mixed it back in the stock.

So good even my picky eater had seconds!  My husband does not like cream soups so I only used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1 1/2 c water instead of the cream.  I used a 7 oz box of rice mix (Zantarains) and added the carrots, celery, onion, garlic that others suggested.  Will make often!!

As per other reviewers, we added some favorite veggies. Sadly, my husband was sick when I tried the recipe. He loved it, and he enjoyed the hearty taste.

very good!  my bf loved it also! :)  i boiled some chicken leg quarters and veggies to get the broth.  i used white rice and sauteed some onion, garlic and carrots to add to it.  i used milk because i didn't have heavy cream on hand.  i don't think it made a difference.  this was even good reheated the next day for lunch.  i will definitely make this again, thank you!

Turned out great! I made a few changes though. I did as some reviews suggested and added a few things... 1 cup shredded carrot, 1 cup celery and half a cup chopped onion. I sautee the mixture in 2 tablespoons oil in large pot until onion is translucent before adding the broth, water and chicken. Delicious!

Awe. Some. Soup. My family and I have made and ate it two days in a row! I just added carrots, broccoli and celery. I only had 1 1/3 of half and half and used 5 T each of flour and butter. I just had to add a little cornstarch to make it thicker. I added real bacon bits and shredded cheese and gorged myself. Freaky good soup!!!

I made it exactly as it called for.  I thought it was good, but my husband raved!  He loved it.  I think it had something to do with making it on a cool autumn day with hot rolls.  He probably wouldn't be as crazy for it in the summer months...

Yum!  I used more chicken broth and cooked my chicken on high in the crock pot for 4 hours before shredding it.  I used shredded carrots and a larger box of Uncle Ben's wild rice mix.  It was great.  Next time I might buy some regular wild rice (not the boxed stuff) and cook a little extra to throw in the soup.  I love wild rice and it could have used a little more.

This soup was wonderful on a crisp fall day. I added sauted onions, celery and carrots to the soup for more substance. Also, I've used half and half or milk for the base. I found that cream makes it too thick. Great soup!!!

Very good, but I added a carrot, stalk of celery and half an onion for depth of flavor.  With additions, it's 5 star.  Also, tasted just fine with 2 percent milk.

This is wonderful. I also add carrots, celery, onion and garlic. I cook gluten free - and subsitute 1/2 c rice flour instead of wheat flour. I use one cup skim milk and one cup half and half. I let it cook for one hour once the ingredients are combined.

My husband and I love this soup.  I substituted half and half for the heavy cream because that is what I had on hand.  I also reduced the flour to 1/2 cup.  It was still very thick.  Next time I will use milk and maybe add more broth to thin it down a little.  It is still amazingly good made right by the recipe.

Now I see why this soup has such a high rating. It makes for a hearty, creamy and filling meal! I even had to sub out two cups of broth for two cups of water, and it still tastes amazing. I hollowed out mini sourdough loaves and filled them up with it. Lots of leftovers and that's exactly what I was hoping for.   Thank you so much for this recipe- definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I made big changes to this, just because of what I had on hand- but next time I want to follow the recipe closer.  I used sausage instead of ckn and noodles instead of rice- w the alpasca mix (MK) as the seasoning.  I used milk instead of cream and less flour as others suggested.

It is delicious and I loved it.   It was chilly, rainy and I had a bad cold all of which made this soup the perfect choice. It was hard not to eat it for breakfast! I did not have a few of the ingredients so I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and Smart Balance spread instead of butter.  I was afraid the changes would effect the flavor so I added a little sauteed shredded carrots, celery and onion. My Uncle Ben's was 6 oz but the extra rice was great.  Maybe omit the salt if using the bigger box.  Even better the next day.  Look forward to making it as listed.  THANKS for a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic in-a-hurry soup.  Needed something to make for dinner during the hectic sports schedule nights and this was perfect.  I made it just as directed but the next time will be following the advise of others and adding carrots, celery and onion.  My kids really liked it.

This recipe is awesome. Even my kids liked it! I follow the recipe exactly except I added fresh mushrooms. The only thing I will change for next time is that I will add 2 boxes of the rice because I thought it could use more rice. Very good though, still deserves a 5 star!

I love this soup. I have tweaked it a bit. A day ahead I boil split chicken breast with some carrots, celery, and onions to make my broth. When that's done, I put it in the fridge and finish the next day. Then I will skim off the fat and pull my chicken off the bone while the broth is re-heating. I also use skim condensed milk instead of cream and don't add any of the butter. I add a can of cream of mushroom soup at the end. Delicious and I can't make too much with a house full of teen-age boys. Thank you.

Flavor was very good, however, I can't really call it a soup because it was soooo thick.  Still tasty but I will try to thin it out next time. Very easy and quick to make, which was a plus.

Great soup. Added some sauteed carrots, garlic, celery, onions to the broth, as one reviewer suggested. Used 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup 1% milk, only 6 Tbsp butter and 1/2 cup flour - was plenty. Added some white wine - excellent!

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. I was skeptical at first because there were so few ingredients. Don't let that fool you! It is awesome!

Superb! I had roasted a chicken last night and today wanted to make another entree for the week. I used a bit less butter and 2% milk rather than cream with homemade stock. I also added carrots, onions and celery plus a bit of leftover broccoli from the roast chicken night. It was just wonderful. We all loved it and it wasn't hard to do. Thanks for the amazingly yummy recipe!

This is only loosely a review of this recipe since I changed so much.  I basically took the concept of adding the heavy cream to a version of this I already make with veggies.  The cream added to the experience though.  Next time I have wild rice on hand I'll try it again and give a more accurate review.  Thanks, Stephanie.  :)

I adore this soup!!  It is so flavorful and creamy.  I add corn, sauteed carrots, celery and garlic to mine.   I also add half&half instead of the heavy cream and it comes out perfect.  Everyone must try this recipe!

Great base recipe! Additions I made were:  about 1/2 cup each carrots, onions, whole kernal corn, 1 stalk of celery and 2 cloves of garlic minced and sauted in olive oil. I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, cut the cream to half and used milk for the remaining cup. I also reduced the flour to 1/2 cup. My family licked their bowls clean and came back for more!!!

What a great base recipe! I used frozen chicken tenders that I roasted in the oven using this recipe: Butter Roast Chicken. I browned two slices of bacon and added diced onion, sweet potato, figs and dried ancho chiles to the pot, letting them cook while the chicken finished up. Then I added the chicken and all its roasting sauce to the pot.  I used boxed couscous instead of rice, and 2/3s 2% milk and 1/3 coconut milk instead of cream (can you tell this was a pantry clearing day?!)  I've never made a roux before, and this one turned out fabulously!! I served with cheesy chive cornbread.

I gave this 4 stars only because the amount of flour is just a bit too much vs. the amount of butter in the recipe. Other than that, it's great. Tasty and easy to make.

Thank you so much for the yummy recipe.  I changed it to 3 C. of chicken broth, and 1 C. of white wine, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and added onion and carrots. So good!

I have been making this for over a year, and it is the best soup I have ever had. I needed to add a little extra water. I wouldn't change anything with this soup. It is a simple recipe to follow. This soup is just as good left over too. Add a little milk or water and you are good to go. This has been a hit with friends and families!

I was craving for a creamy soup so I made this for dinner and it was delicious! I didn't add anything like carrots to it, but I made some veggies on the side instead! I also served with some bread. YUM! Recipe was also very quick and easy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed exactly but didn't have any heavy cream so I used Half and Half. It thickened up perfectly. I also added a tsp or so of Poultry Seasoning. For rice I used Uncle Ben's Long grain & Wild Rice Herb Roasted Chicken box ( 6oz) it was perfect! Will definately be making this again and recommending to friends/family. Happy Cooking!

I thought for a quick meal this was incredible. Creamy, luscious, and it didn't even matter that the chicken I used came straight from the freezer to the boiling pot.  I don't recommend cooking chicken that way, as it came out rather chewy, but I just chopped it up fine and threw it in anyway.  Very, VERY good...surprisingly so! EVEN with my rubber chicken! :)  I would make this again in a heartbeat!

So delicious!  I added shredded carrot and chopped onion, celery, and mushrooms.   I used skim milk as others suggested and only 6T. of butter and skim milk rather than cream.  Consistency was great.  Great, wholesome soup.

I made this soup and it was fairly easy.  One thing I had trouble with is the "roux."  It started off smooth and then it got really clumpy and the butter seperated from it... I went ahead with adding it to the broth...  It tasted good.. It is very creamy.. I think maybe I used to much butter... it had a funny after taste that sort of didn't sit with me well.  I used an off brand type of butter, maybe thats what gave it the odd taste.  Overall it was good.

Great soup for a cold winter day! Like other reviewers I used a 6oz box of rice, cut the flour down to 1/2 cup, and used 1 1/2 cups of low fat milk. Soup thikckened up perfectly.  I also sauteed onion, carrot,garlic, and celery to add more flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this soup last night.  I used a large can of chicken breast, shredded and substituted 2% milk in place of the cream.  Other than that, I made the recipe as written.  We thought it was wonderful!  Rich, thick and very comforting on a cold night.  I can't wait to have some more for lunch today!!

This was just as good as I was expecting!  Just add salt and/or pepper to taste.  I can't believe how much my entire family loved this soup!

I made this the other day and my family LOVED it! It was so hearty and filling! My sister claimed it was the best thing I had ever cooked. The only thing that I did different was I diced a whole onion, 1 stalk of celery, and 10 baby carrots and sauteed them with some minced garlic. I then added these vegetables to the broth and chicken. I also only used a 1/2 cup of flour rather than 3/4 cup and it was very thick but yummy!

Wow! I used 2% milk because I didn't have cream and kept everything else exactly the same. Very good! My picky husband loved it too.

It's ok. I'd attribute that to the heavy cream and processed rice dish.

5 stars even though I used the wrong rice blend (did not have a seasoning packet). Added onion and celery and a little garlic powder.

My husband gives this a 5 but I think it is only a 4.  I thought it was lacking in flavor.  I'm sure some of that is I got a rice pilaf packet not knowing what else to use I like garlic a lot so maybe something with garlic in it next time would be better.  I'm going to try to make this with my own seasonings to then I can make this much cheaper.

My first time making this soup. Really easy and tasty. I followed some other people and used skim milk, 1/2c flour and 6TBL butter. I also sauteed some onion, celery and carrots. I will make it again!

I love this soup.  I took some advice and added sauted onions and garlic and butter.  I boiled the chicken and added garlic powder, granulated onion, pepper, chicken soup base.  I used this stock along with one cup of chicken broth.  Added the garlic and onion and the soup was wonderful.

Great recipe. I'm not really an experienced cook so I read the reviews carefully. I added some veggies as some suggested and used milk instead of cream in order to reduce calories. I also added the flour tablespoon by tablespoon and found that I only needed 4 tablespoons and not 3/4 cup as the recipe suggested. I also needed less butter. I added mushrooms and carrots as well which made it really hearty and filling.

I made this with 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup fat free half and half (I just couldn't stomach the thought of all of that cream). I also backed off a bit on the butter, probably used 1/3 cup.  The results were very good, although EXTREMELY rich for my husband and myself.   I would cut back even more on the butter and use only the fat free half and half, or mixture of milk and heavy cream.  Rich Rich Rich, but I would make again with a few more adjustments.  Really nice and easy to make.

I made this Dec. 26 with leftover turkey stock while drinking chardonney and listening to Leroy Anderson's Christmas Sleigh Ride...just waiting to feed the boys!  I modified a bit.  Half the flour and butter and half cream and 1% milk.  I also put in 2 generous tablespoons of leftover gravy from the turkey last night. Added a generous handful or two of frozen mixed veg and the leftover steamed cauliflower, broccoli and carrot bits from dinner last night.   Added no extra salt of pepper.  My first time making a cream soup and it definately won't be my last. Thanks for the great ideas on this site!

I would give it 5 stars, but I made the following modifications:  2 chicken breasts, cubed (Browned with a few shakes of Old Bay) 1 can of chunk chicken in water (because I didn't want to open another pack of chicken for one more breast) 1/4 c. chopped celery  1/4 c. chopped baby carrots  1/2 c. chopped medium onion 1 6 oz pkg of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice, Herbed Chicken seasoning subbed 1 c. heavy cream/1 c. milk for 2 c. milk.  cut back flour from 3/4 c. to 1/3 c.  I browned all chicken in 1 T. olive oil while cooking the rice. When chicken was brown, I put it in the pot with the water/broth, boiled, then added the rice. Then in 1/3 c. butter, I sauteed the veggies until soft and tossed them in with the chicken and rice to simmer. I followed the recipe as listed from 2. onward. This is a great base recipe--we will certainly be making this soup again!

Excellent, perfect for a winter day. We happened to get snowed in with no fresh veggies and we were craving soup so I stumbled upon this recipe and it fit the bill perfectly. I did add some chopped onion and used skim milk instead of the cream. It was still really good!

This was fabulous! Rich, creamy and very warming during a snowstorm. Next time, I'll leave out the 1/2 tsp salt. ***UPDATE*** Replaced the chicken with leftover turkey. Tasted good too.

Very yummy soup. At others' suggestions, I added celery and carrots.  In hind-sight, I would cook them with the chicken for flavor, but leave them out of the soup.  I substituted a tablespoon for bacon grease 1 T of butter.  Another poster had mentioned they used Rice-A-Roni instead of Uncle Ben's.  One important thing to note (and I didn't until it was too late) is that the seasoning packet has the wild rice, which takes much longer to cook.  I had to fish it out and cook the soup longer to compensate of the lack of cooking time.  Will make it again, but will probably replace at least some of the cream b/c this recipe has got to be a KILLER in calories!

Love this soup..i add onion celery and carrots~all finely chopped.  I use the regular long grain wild rice mix not the quick cooking.. Saute the veggies in a bit of EVOO then add the stock and rice and follow the recipe the same just cooking slightly longer.

Delicious. Only change I made was to use skim milk instead of cream, and it still turned out creamy and delicious while saving me a bunch of calories.

This soup is wonderful!  I didn't change a thing.  My husband said it tastes just like the wild rice soup at his favorite sandwhich shop.

This was incredibly delicious!!  Very creamy, but I loved and so did my husband!  The only thing I would say is that it was a little too thick. But, it didn't matter to me because it was still yummy. I will definetly make this again.

Sometimes following the reviews is good, sometimes not.  I'm just finishing up the soup and I took others' advice and added shredded carrots (what I had), mushrooms (thrown in too so they didn't go to waste), and about 1/4 c. of onion.  I also reduced the amount of flour (as some recommended) since I used the uncle ben's rice (6 oz. box), and I was just looking at the soup trying to figure out why it wasn't thick like I was expecting.  It had to be because of the reduced amount of flour (only used about 1/4 c. as a reviewer suggested), and because I like my soups thick, it's not enough.  I wish I would've used the whole 3/4 c., but I'll know better next time.  The flavor is delicious, and there will definitely be a next time.  If I would've followed the directions, it would've been 5 stars, so I gave it that anyway.

I made this soup last night with some of the additions reviewers suggested.  Onions, celery, carrots, garlic, and a bit of poultry seasoning.  I also cut back the flour to 1/2 cup and just added until it became the thickness I liked. I did not use all of the roux mixture.  An excellent soup and the bf said the best chicken soup he has ever had.  A keeper for sure!!  Thank you Stephanie for such a great base recipe.

I love this soup, but I did make a few changes...I added carrots for color and flavor.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream, the soup was still plenty thick.

This was really good but next time I'll only make half the roux & cream mixture because it was too thick for me. I think I'll also add some garlic, onion, carrots, and celery just to make it a little heartier.

4 1/2 stars.  I use canola oil instead of butter when making the roux and I use 2% milk instead of cream.  It still tastes great.  I think adding a little garlic would be delicious.  Next time, I am going to cut back on the flour.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my! This was delicious!  I love creamy soups and this didn’t disappoint!  I didn’t use instant rice because I had a box of the regular rice at home, so I made that separately and omitted the water from the broth portion of the recipe (but next time I will use instant, it would be so much easier).  I also cut the butter and flour in half and used non-fat half & half to make it a bit healthier (although I bet it would be very good with the full butter and cream version too).  And as other reviewers suggested I sautéed some onion, mushrooms and carrots to throw in to make it a hardier soup.  It was amazing! I cant wait to eat the leftovers!

My family of 6 loved this soup.  I did add 1/2 cup each of sauteed diced carrots, celery and onions.  Also used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup 2% milk instead of 2 cups of heavy cream. Reheats well with the addition of a bit of milk to thin.

This was fabulous! I followed some other suggestions of scaling back on the butter and flour (6 T and 1/2 c, respectively) as well as added fresh slicked m'rooms, carrots, Italian seasoning, chicken seasoning, part skim milk/part fat-free 1/2 and 1/2, and a rotisserie chicken from Sam's. Great comfort food on a rainy day!

Amazing! We have five boys and they all loved this. The 18 month old was licking out his bowl. We did dice up mushrooms, carrots, and onions and sautee them. Served with warm rolls. Everyone asked to add this to our regular recipe book.

Very good soup especially on a very chilly and rainy night. Like some others, I felt the soup needed to be bumped up with more seasonings and to make life a bit easier, I just used my microwave to cook the rice by itself. I had carrots and celery on hand, so that also went into the mix and I think peas would be another nice addition in the future. I only used three tablespoons of butter and one tablespoon of evoo to make my roux and the soup came out to a perfect consistency. Fat free half and half replaced the heavy cream and no one was the wiser. A sprinkling of some shredded cheddar and a little paprika topped it off nicely. Delish Stephanie and thank you!

This had superb taste, and was quick to make.  I only gave it 4 stars because when it cooled, it was so thick it was more like hot dish than soup.  When re-heating, I added some milk and the texture was fine. I also did as others and added celery, carrots, and a bit of garlic.  I added some Lawry's, and this gave it great flavor. Definately will make again.

This is a family favorite, I add a splash of dry white wine towards the end of cooking, and I steam broccoli and puree it and also add it towards the end...adds a great flavor, and I usually use milk.

I've made this many times but I use skim milk instead of cream to cut out some of the fat. I also leave out the flour and butter. To add flavor I put in chopped celery, onion, fried crumbled bacon, and fresh ground pepper. You won't miss the cream with all of this added flavor!

Made my own chicken stock by sauteing chicken with onion, celery, carrots, and garlic, before boiling.  Used Uncle Ben's quick-cook long grain wild rice.  DELICIOUS.

Excellent soup! Lots of flavor, I added sauteed onions, garlic, chopped mushrooms, carrots and celery as suggested by others. It was yummy. I might try to use milk next time instead of cream. It is pretty rich. But it is a keeper!

I LOVED THIS RECIPIE!  I used a rice mixture that contained wild rice, brown rice and red rice and it was perfect.  I also added quite a bit more, I wanted it to be a main course.  To try and make it a bit healthier I used fat free half and half instead of the cream.  I also made my own chicken stock instead of using cans.  I will definately make this a winter staple in my house.  I froze half of the batch and we ate it a few weeks later and it heated up well on the stove top.

This soup is delicious and easy!  My family LOVED it. Very filling, and had great flavor. I sauteed onion in butter before adding the chick. broth and I used 1% milk instead of heavy cream, which worked wonderfully. Next time I'm adding veggies. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was fabulous, esp. on a 20 degree night - so warm and comforting. DH thought it was great, and my son, who loves all kinds of soup, declared it his favorite!  I did add sauteed carrots, onion, celery and garlic.  Delish!

This is a fantastic soup and is a big hit every time I make it.  I do a few things differently just to make it a little healthier.  Instead of 2 cups of heavy cream, I use 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of half & half.  I also use half the butter that the recipe calls for.  It honestly doesn't change the taste and is still a very rich and creamy soup.

Husband raved and raved about this soup. I know people don't like it when the recipe is changed up so much but I find the reviews helpful. Anyways, I used leftover chicken from a roast I made earlier and a 8.8oz package of Uncle Ben's 90 second rice (that's all I could find). I cut the flour to 1/4 cup but would probably use more next time. I also used 1 C of Heavy Cream and 1 C of Skim Milk (that's all I had) and omitted the salt. One last change, I sauteed an onion before the broth step, like others have suggested. My husband does not like to eat anything with bones in it so he's not a fan of my roasted chicken. BUT he said that he'd like me to roast chicken more often if only to make this soup. =) That's a definite winner in my book.

AMAZING!!!  We loved this soup!  I made my own broth the normal chicken soup way and after all the ingredients were mixed and creamy I left it in the crock pot adding about 2tsp each (that's because I doubled the recipe - only use 1 tsp if using the recipe as is) of ground thyme, poultry seasoning and salt.  I also added the leftover white rice I had in the fridge.  You can season to your liking - either way there's no going wrong with this soup.  Even my 10 year old loved it and he's not a huge soup fan.  :)

I will make this again and again. I used a store bought cooked chicken, which added some richness to the flavor. I also added some carrots and celery and cooked them before adding them in. I needed a little extra flour to get it thick enough, but it was so so so good. Reminds me of the chicken rice soup from panera.

What an intoxicating recipe!  Honestly, I never follow recipes exactly because I know what I like and dislike, so I typically use them as a base.  This recipe was a great place to start!  I poached my chicken in a whole bottle of white wine, garlic and peppercorn, added the wild rice with seasoning (Zattaran's doesn't separate the two) and another box of rice (Herb and Butter).  I sauteed my onion and more garlic in butter, added the flour and Herb and Butter rice seasoning to make the roux.  I probably used more cream than called for, but fortunately, I'm not counting calories!  Added the chicken/wine/rice mixture and an extra cup of water and voila!  Amazing, amazing, amazing!

This is a very tasty soup and so simple to make.  I made this recipe as written except that I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  My kids loved it, so that speaks volumes.  This will be a staple recipe in my house!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is an amazing soup, by far my favorite I agree with the adding of the onions and garlic and maybe some celery. Also I like to use 1c milk 1c cream as it gets a little too thick with all the heavy cream, other than that this soup is delicious and I recommend it to anyone!

I made this as a starter for Thanksgiving dinner for my very, very picky Romanian in-laws. Romanians have soup with virtually every meal and my father-in-law is quite vocal that he doesn't like ANYTHING that is not of Romanian origin. Often he will refuse to even TRY non-Romanian foods. He took seconds on this soup, which is truly the highest praise possible.

This soup has become one of my favorites!  It's easy, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious.  It tastes as if it were being served in a top-end restaurant. I use half and half and it still tastes great.

The soup was wonderful! The only thing I changed is I used 1 cup milk & 1 cup half & half (only because that is what I had on hand). Great flavor!!

This was fantastic.  I used Uncle Ben's quick cooking rice and spice it with garlic and onion, lawry's, and Basil.  It was almost the best soup I have ever had

I really liked this soup, I think next time I'll try others ideas of more low-fat options.... My 3 year old and 1 year old (who are the pickiest eaters in the world) even seemed to enjoy it... Or maybe they enjoyed the mess they made more! Who knows! :)

I made a few changes, nothing tooo major though.  First change, the box of wild rice I used was a 6.2oz Uncle Ben's. Also, I used 1% milk instead of cream because that's what I had. Then, I diced up about a 1/2 lb of bacon and cooked it in a pan. I set the bacon aside, and drained the grease from the pan (but didn't wash the pan). I sauteed an onion (about a medium sized onion) and 2 cloves of garlic in the leftover bacon greased pan, when they were almost done, I added about a 1/2 cup shredded carrots to the pan. I added this to the pot with the chicken and broth.  When making the cream, I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup, because I added an 8oz block of velveeta.   When I added everything all together in the same pot, I added about another 1/2 cup of shredded carrots to the pot. I saved the bacon bits to crumble on top of my bowl of soup.  The taste is amazing! Although some may want more broth...(in which case, if you add more broth, you may want to keep the original 3/4 cup of flour to keep it somewhat thick), I didn't mind, maybe it seemed like there was a little less broth than should have been because I used more rice.

This recipe ROCKS! I'll post pics later. I also felt that the recipe seemed to leave something to be desired, so I added a bit of minced garlic, half of an onion diced, 4 carrot sticks peeled and sliced, and 2 sliced celery stalks. I love how creamy it is. I also think that it seems like something you would get at a restaurant. I cheated though...I used two cans of cooked chicken (saves time, not money). It turned out wonderful! This will become part of our meal rotation.

The best a recipe with this title could be, very flavorful, it was real good. I usually really don't care for cream of chicken soup but this soup is just really delicious, everyone absolutely loved it. I used a whole rotissere chicken from the grocery store and measured what 2 chicken breast would be about and still wondering what to do with the rest of the leftover chicken.

Fantastic to say the least – definitely worth keeping this one!  Turned out Perfect!    Modifications –  1.	Diced 4-stalks of celery added to the rice while cooking with flavor packet. 2.	Sautéed 1-large fine chopped shallot and added it to the broth stage 3.	Used ½ & ½ instead of cream 4.	Used 6-cups of  broth – no water 5.	Onion powder, garlic powder – a touch of cayenne pepper?

This is a good base for a creamy chicken and rice soup.  I like veggies in my cream soup so I add a mirepoix that sauteed until soft as well as some fresh parsley, white wine and a little garlic.

After all those raves I was expecting more.  Maybe it's because I don't care for rice and chicken in a creamy sauce.  But my family didnt like it either.

This is good... really, really good! BETTER than Panera's creamy chicken and wild rice soup for sure. I saute onions, carrots and celery before adding the stock. Also used a combination of 1% and whole milk. Just delicious!! Thanks :o)

I, like others added sauteed onoins and shredded carrots. I didn't have any celery or i would have added some too. This is definitely a great Base recipe for chicken and rice soup, but again, i, like others felt something was missing even after i added 2 boullion cubes!! The soup has a great taste and texture, and although when milk and half & half was substituted for the heavy cream it still was thick enough. Ultimately, this recipe is definitely a keeper with minor modifications. I think next time i make this is will add a dash of poultry seasoning to the chicken when i cook it. Something is definitely missing from this recipe that i can't quite put my finger on.

This is a very good soup.  I added extra chicken because... we like lots of chicken!  I didn't read the reviews before cooking and followed the recipe exactly otherwise... and can definitely see how adding vegetables would be a nice addition... and next time I will also try cutting back on the flour and substituting milk for some of the cream as well.  But still wonderful!

Very good recipe.  Made it for a friend after she had surgery.  Like the others, I added carrots & celery, sauteed garlic & onions.  I put all but the items to make the roux in the crock pot and let them cook for about 5 hrs.  Should have added chicken boullion but was out.  Will make this again when we can enjoy it ourselves.

Great!  Half cup flour with half cup butter made it the perfect consistency for me.  Added carrots.  Didn't use quick rice but cooked it separately and omitted the water.  Will make again. Also, I used milk--you definitely don't need cream!

Wow!  Soooo good!  I took the suggestions of others and sauted 1/2 c each of onions, carrots, and celery and 2 cloves of garlic and added that in.  I also used 1/2 c flour and 1 1/2 c of milk instead of cream.  I did add extra chicken broth which i regretted because it wasn't as thick as it would have been without it.  One of my favorite soups now!

This took me by surprise! I made this almost to a T with an addition of a  cup of sauteed onions and a clove of garlic. I also didn't have two cups cream because my boyfriend had used some of it for a coffee filler. So only using 1 3/4 c. made this soup thick but still really delicious. Now that it has settle and cooled a lot of the sauce has either thickened or evaporated, so it will be thicker as left overs, but nothing that additional liquid cant handle. I used Uncle Ben's Sun Dried Tomato and Florentine wild rice which was wonderful, I was so surprised with the amount of dried herbs, however a bit on the high side of sodium so look out. This is a bit lengthy to make, especially since I baked my chicken first and then let it cool a little in order to shred it, but it was truly an astounding meal that I will definitely make again.

This is so yummy!!!!  I took reviewers suggestions and sauteed onion, and garlic in a little butter, then added thinly sliced carrots to soften, and celery seed (I do not like chunks of celery in things).  Everything went smoothly, the only thing is I used Zataran's Wild rice package, and the seasonings were not seperate, so I had to just dump it all in the chicken broth mixture.  I followed the recipe directions, but my rice had a hard time softening.  Next time I will boil my rice for a few minutes and then cover and remove from heat. Either way, SO delicious!!!!!!

Wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars.  I made a number of the modifications recommended by others (less flour, 1 c fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 c heavy cream, and a splash of white wine).  I also used a rotisserie chicken.  I also sauteed 2 shallots, some minced garlic and 4-5 baby carrots and added those.  I also added more salt and pepper as the soup was simmering (especially pepper).  I found the soup to be really good and flavorful.  My only complaint is that the rice wasn't as cooked as it needed to be.  Just slightly too "al dente."    Otherwise, delish!

I've made this several times now, each time a bit different, but this is the base I always start with. I never make the roue, just throw everything into the pot, bring to boil and then simmer for 30 minutes. I too add additional veggies, onions, carrots, peas, corn, celery, and garlic. Each time it's a bit different as it depends on what I've got in the house. Also, instead of the cream I drop a brick of fat free or low fat cream cheese in near the end. Once it melts, its just a wonderful soup. I've cut so many corners and changed so many things it's not really fair to call this the same soup, but I always reference this as the starting point.

I rated 5 stars because it TRULY IS the BEST! Creamy, rich, filling and flavorful= as long as you add celery-3 stalks chopped, 1/2 onion- grated, & carrots- grated) I threw in 1/2 tsp of minced garlic. SAUTEE all together till soft. I also cooked the rice seperately till al dente & saved the seasoning packet top add to the soup mixture later. ABSOLUTEWLY THE BEST CREAMY CHICKEN & WILD RICE SOUP I'VE EVER TASTED. It will be hard NOT to make this EVERY week! =')

I substituted 1% milk for the heavy cream, and it was delicious!  Great recipe.  I have made it twice now for my husband and he says that it's tastier than Panera's.

This was really good. I included some of the alterations recommended by others, including using milk, putting in celery and carrots. I needed to loosen it up later as it thickened quite a lot from being in the fridge, but just added chicken stock to it.   I used a box of long grain/wild rice, but found I could hardly see the wild rice, so added some more.   Both my husband and in-laws really enjoyed it. My husband said "it's a winner, that can go in your keeping it pile" Might try it without doing the white sauce mixture separately, as that seemed to be more time consuming.

Fantastic soup.   Used Uncle Ben's fast cook recipe (it was handy), 3 chicken breast shredded (we like a good amount of chicken) and plenty of pepper for a little kick.  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe but a tad on the unhealthy side. SO to make it healthier I sub FF 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream.  Cant taste the difference and a load healthier for you.

This was my first time making Chicken & Wild Rice soup and I really like this recipe.  It was very easy to make and very yummy.  I decreased the flour to 1/2 cup.  The only other thing I changed, and I wish I hadn't, was I used whole milk.  Next time I will definitely use cream or half & half as it was lacking any richness and would have been much better I think with the cream.

Absolutely delicious!!!!  I have made this several times for my family, as well as for large groups.  Super easy and every time came out perfect. I added carrots, celery and onion (I steamed in the microwave and then added) and have also substituted milk for the cream and came out just as yummy...  I have even made in my crock pot... everyone raves about it...  thanks for a great, easy recipe

This soup turned out very well. I followed some other reviewers suggestions, and satueed some bacon.  To that I added some onions, mushrooms and minced garlic.  To the broth mixture I added a cup of cooking sherry. The flavor was wonderful!  Thank you.

This was a wonderful soup that the entire family liked. I did follow the suggestions of some others and started with onions, garlic, and mushrooms. I also used about 1/2 cup of flour, half and half instead of heavy cream and included a splash or two of white wine.  It was great!

This recipe is a keeper! I put frozen chicken breasts in a pan with a little water, sprinkled with Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic and Tastefully Simple Seasoned Salt. When cooked through, tore into small pieces. Added mushrooms, chopped celery and carrots and simmered till tender in the broth before adding rest of ingredients. Also used skim milk in the place of cream, and the soup was wonderfully thick.  EVERYONE loved it! Finished all leftovers the next day!

Great idea. Eating it now, actually. The soup came out a bit too thick for me so I added two more cups of broth. Also, I only found a 6oz package of rice, but I may even double it.   Will definitely make again.

This recipe was adjusted from 8 servings to 40 servings.  Even with the increase of ingredients this recipe was very easy to make.  I will be making it again...this time for personal consumption instead of profession.  I did add onion, carrot and celery...it was not only appealing to the pallet, it was very appealing to the eye.   Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Really wonderful soup on a chilly day -- based on other reviews, I made the following additions/changes:  1/2 cup flour 2% milk (instead of heavy cream) College Inn Culinary Broth - White Wine and Herb 1/2 cup chopped carrots 1/2 cup chopped mushrooms Lemon Pepper rotisserie chicken (so easy & flavorful)  I was brave enough to try this soup for the first time with company, and everyone raved!

This is such a great soup.  I added some carrots and cremini mushrooms to the butter and let them cook for about 5 min then added the seasoning packet and the flour to make the roux.  Worked out fine.  I also used only 1/4 C heavy cream and for the remainder I used non-fat half n half - had to do something to make me feel alittle better after using 1/2C of butter! I'd better add an extra mile to my walk tomorrow....but oh so worth it.

I just made this today and it is fab!!!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added some minced carrot, onion and celery by cooking briefly in olive oil.  I did not get the fast cook wild rice so I increased the water by about 1 1/2 cups and let it simmer for 25 minutes unstead of stand off the heat.  I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of half and half.  Additionally I only needed one quarter cup of the flour mixture.  The soup came out beautifully (eye appealing) and so full of flavor.  I have my bread maching going now and can't wait to serve this delightful meal to my family.  Try this, you won't be sorry.

Wonderful soup with some of the suggested modifications (carrots, celery, onion, garlic). I used skim milk and it was totally fine. I wasn't sure about what rice to use but found a 6 oz box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice worked just fine. I don't think this rice was "instant" but if you let your soup simmer just a bit to blend the flavors the rice will cook up just fine anyway. So, so good!

This soup was really good.  I did a few things different but not much. I halved the recipe and I didn't feel like cooking up any chicken so I omitted it but didn't really miss it.  I also added some garlic to the butter and sauteed it.  I also cut the cream in half and added 1/2 cup of milk and it was plenty creamy.  I will make this again.  I was way impressed at how good it was.

I made a vegetarian version of this soup - and what a delight!  The substitutions made were three Russet potatoes for the chicken, low-sodium vegetable broth for the chicken broth, whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, and 1.5% milk for the cream.  I also halved the butter, added a package of frozen veggies (onion, celery, carrot), and ground a bunch of sea salt into the pot.  We had wild rice already cooked so I obviously used that.  I cooked everything as directed, then let it sit out for four hours before re-heating and eating.  This turned out to be QUITE the soup/stew - creamy and delicious!

Very quick and easy. I converted it to make 8 servings. It called for 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 flour, it didn't need that much roux, it was way too thick. I would use 1/4 butter and 3-4 Tbl flour. The one box of rice was not enough for 8 servings so I stirred in some instant brown rice, and Viola it was great!

Good stuff.  I've made this lots of times, and here's the way we like it:  reduced sodium broth, one cup of skim milk subbed for one of the cups of cream.  Also add half a cup of instant rice for the last five or so minutes of cooking.  Great winter soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was excellent. I also added, per reviews, onion, carrot, celery, garlic and fresh mushrooms. Substituted half and half for the cream and it was still very rich. Great for a rainy night. Makes a lot.

Great soup!  I added carrots, celery, green onions and garlic - I try to add these wherever possible.  I reduced the butter and flour mixture (calories...) and substituted half and half with skim milk instead of heavy cream(saved lots of fat this way).  The soup thickened up with these changes.  It was awesome soup!  It made it on the make it again list in our house!

excellent soup - very hearty.  tastes just like panera's.  I increased the veggie content (added mushrooms, more carrots, onions, celery) and followed the advice of other reviewers.  Have made this a couple times already this winter and my husband (a non-soup lover) keeps asking for it!!

This soup was great!  The only changes I made were: -chicken stock instead of broth, which I made from a leftover roasted chicken -I added carrots -I used half and half instead of heavy cream.

My family and I loved this recipe; the only changes we took from other readers was using milk instead of the cream and adding a celery/carrot/onion frozen veggie mix.  It worked wonderfully :)  Thank you Stephanie for sharing with us.

Absolutely delicious! When you first mix it all together it seems a little thin. Give it a minute! Once the rice cooks and the roux does its job it gets VERY thick, almost too thick. I always though roux was supposed to be a 50/50 butter to flour ratio. I used her measurements but only used about 3/4 of it. It was STILL very thick. Esp the next day. I've also added diced onions and carrots. Very very tasty!

This has got to be the best soup ever. I've been making this since college and I still make it 4 years later. I make it just about like the recipe states except for the reduction of flour to 1/2 a cup and regular milk or a mix of heavy cream and milk. Whichever you prefer. Amazing doesn't do this justice.

This is great! You can change it up if you want to make it lower in fat and calories. I make a lot of soup from scratch and this was as good and as easy as can be.

I think this recipe is great!  What makes it even better is that my kids will eat it.  I did add carrots, celery and onions.  The next time I make it, I am going to add potatoes and take out the chicken.  I used Carrie's suggestions and the soup turned out wonderful.  I especially like the soup with the vegetables because it gets my kids to eat their vegetables without complaining!

Wow! What a yummy soup! I also used 2 cups of 1% milk instead of the cream and felt the result was still very creamy.  Whoever suggested the addition of carrots.... what a perfect compliment to all the flavors! Thanks for an awesome and easy soup.

This was excellent!  I followed the tips of the milk versus heavy cream.  I also sauted carrots, celery and onions.  Being that I didn't have a seasoning packet, I added Herbs de Province, oregano, thyme and rosemary as well as several other seasonings.  Delicious!

Wow! Reminds me of my favorite soup at Panera!  I followed others suggestions and added onions, carrots, and celery.  Next time, I think I'll add some mushrooms too.  I also cut the butter down to 6 tbs. and used 1/2 cup flour along with 1% milk.  Hopefully that cut down on some of the calories...  Very tasty!  My kids loved it!

When I read the reviews and a couple of them said "Like Panera's Chicken and Wild Rice Soup" I knew I had to try it.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  I took the suggestions of many of the reviews and added onion, celery and carrots and mushrooms.  Decreased the flour and butter and used 2% milk.  It is really good.  I froze part of my batch of soup.  Hope it turns out good when I go to reheat it.  Thanks to all who wrote about this recepie.

I followed Carrie's lead and sautéed 1/2 C. each of onion, celery and carrots w/ 1 tsp minced garlic. I used the food processor instead of hand chopping. I used the leftover breast from a store bought rotisserie chicken and the juice. I also used the food processor instead of shredding the chicken. I used 2 C. fat free half and half, 6 Tbsp margarine and 1/2 C flour.  I added about 1/4 C more broth at the end because it was really thick.  

The soup was very hearty and was flavorful yet mild.  Very comforting.  A meal in itself.

awesome soup. Here's a little secret instead of 2 cups heavy creame do 1 cup heavy creame 1 cup milk depending on how thick you want it. Also make it a few hours ahead of time and put it in a crock-pot or slow-cooker and put it on the low setting until you re ready to eat it. Als throw in some mushrooms, fabulous.

This is fabulous!  Fromthe reviews, I added a carrot,celery and onion (sauted first) and used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream. Next time I will try using two boxes of the rice because I thought it could have used a bit more.  This one will stay in rotation all winter!!

Like the other reviewers I added Celery and Mushrooms. Mine turned out too think even though I used 1% milk, so I've had to add water when reheating. Still very yummy!

This was very good. I used the stock I made from boiling the turkey carcass instead of the chicken broth and water and the turkey meat I picked off the bones instead of the chicken breasts. I added some chopped onion, celery and carrot simply because I always add them to soup and sauteed them in the butter before making the roux.

This was amazing! I took the advise of some other reviewer's to make this healthier, and only used 1/3 cup butter, and used milk and half and half instead of cream. Also added celery, carrots and onion...delicious!

WOW!  What a great cold weather easy recipe.  I read many other reviews and used many of their ideas (saute veggies best idea).  I also use the larger box of wild rice.  I accidentally box the regular rice (not fast cooking).  I just cooked the rice (just short of recommended time) and didn't add the 2 cups of water.  I also use 2% milk or whole milk and not cream-still delicious.  And I did decrease the flour amount (per many, many other reviews).
I can't say enough how delicious this soup is and will part of my regular recipe rotation.

Great Recipe, I made it easier by boiling the chicken in 6 cups of water to make the broth.  It came out great, I also sauted onions, carrots, and garlic to add to the mixture before I added the rice.  To lower the fat I used milk instead of cream.  It turned out really well!!

I just made this tonight with leftover turkey meat.  My husband and daugher loved it.  I added more white rice an about 4 cups of meat since I wanted it to be a thicker soup.  Very good!

I made this yesterday for a Thanksgiving soup dinner at my church. I tripled the recipe and per previous suggestions added some veggies (carrots, potatoes, and celery) and used 2% milk (and a tiny bit of half & half I had left in the fridge) instead of the whole milk. I thought it turned out great and hd many compliments and requests for the receipe. Next time I may add some more seasoning as it tasted a little bit bland to me but overall, it was great and I will definitely make again!!!

I added shredded carrots and changed the cream to half milk and half/half to make it healthier.  I also used reduced salt chicken broth.  It was a big hit with everyone.

Very good and easy to make.  However, I found it to be a little too thin for my taste.  Next time I'll probably reduce the water (or the broth) down by a cup.

Wow, thats a thick soup.  I think it'll be REALLY thick tomorrow for leftovers lol
I think next time I might use milk instead of half and half, and might sautee some onion for it as well.  It's mighty tasty the way it is though.  I did add one stalk of celery just because it seemed like it would be missing something.....and had no veggies in it.  I'll make it again this winter for sure. Yum!!

Delicious!!! My son who is very picky...even though he is 22...said it was the best soup he has ever had! I used a pre-cooked chicken from the grocery so it was pretty simple. I will make again.

I love soup and hubby doesn't.  Was looking for one more to add to the three hubby approves of.  Hubby likes meaty soups so I used alot more chicken but didn't measure it.  I had to use three boxes of rice before you even knew there was rice in it.  Didn't measure the veggies but per the advice of other viewers (and the fact I like veggies) added the carrots, celery and peas (for presentation as well).  Didn't measure the cream, butter or broth, but whatever I used it worked.  Only gave it four stars because my daughter didn't like it. Hubby said I could make it again!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great, easy soup.  I followed the recipe except for... adding more broth (from the box) than was called for and at the end... added some frozen corn.  
Can't wait to serve it for dinner with fresh rolls!!  Thank you so much Stephanie for the recipe

I'm not much of a soup person, but I made this for my hubby; I was very pleasantly surprised! I cut the flour to 3/4 c and sauteed some onion, garlic and carrots in olive oil to add to the broth. I used the regular 6 oz box of long grain wild rice and cooked it prior to adding to the soup. I also used 2% milk instead of cream and it was still fabulous. This will definitely be a dinner to help us through the long winter!

This tasted great and was very easy! Similar to Panera's version. Couldn't find 4.5 oz quick-cook rice mix, so used box of Uncle Ben's regular wild rice mix, which was 5 or 6 oz - worked perfectly, the extra rice didn't make a difference. And since it wasn't quick-cook, simmered it about 10 min longer. For additional texture, included sauteed onions, carrots, and potatoes. Used 1% milk instead of cream. Didn't add extra salt and still had great flavor. My 2.5 yr old ate it 3 days in a row. To reheat, added milk until reached desired consistency. Makes a BIG pot. Will make it again.

This was the greatest soup I have made in years!  I have a picky teenager who refuses to eat vegetables, so I snuck in another two cups of chopped zucchini in addition to the onion, celery, garlic and carrot recommended by other cooks on this site.  I also started with the bacon from another cook.  The only substantial change I made (albeit unintentionally!) was to add the roux without the cream to the soup and then to add the cream separately.  This made the soup slightly less thick the first day but today it is perfect!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe filled with endless possibilities!

This was really good and super easy to make.  I will be making this again in the near future.  I did make one change and used turkey that we had leftover versus the chicken.  This will be a great recipe to help use up Thanksgiving leftovers.

This was good.  Since I realized that I didn't have butter, I made the roux using 1/4 cup oil and 3 heaping tablespoons of flour.  I couldn't find 4.5 oz. package of wild rice so I used 6.2 oz. package of Uncle Ben's Quick Cooking Wild Rice.  When I added the cream mixture to chicken/rice mixture, my soup didn't get as thick as I hoped after 10 minutes so I mixed another heaping tablespoon in a little water until it dissolved and then mixed it in to the soup.  I cooked it for a bit longer than specified in the directions (probably about 30 minutes total) to get it to thicken.  I added a sliced carrot when I added the cream mixture in.  I did wish that they were cooked a little longer and that there were more.

I'll definitely make this again, but for the roux use 1/3 cup oil plus 4 or 5 tablespoons of flour and add 2 sliced carrots to the chicken broth right away.

Used ten times the recommended celery, old school rice and wild rice instead of instant, and skipped the cream.  Will be making this soup again by this time next week.  Crazy for it.  Literally ate it for breakfast the next day.

I sauteed carrots and celery in 2 Tbs butter, then added broth and chicken. Used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, and less than 1/2 cup flour. Made for a small group of friends and received rave reviews - none leftover! Husband requested it be added to the regular rotation.

Just okay. I usually follow the recipe exactly and then if it's got potential I can tweak it.  Still unsure on this one.  The amount of flour was unbelievable and definitely altered the taste.

Very yummy!  I made it with leftover roast chicken and included the chicken drippings (minus the fat, which was easy to spoon off after being refrigerated).  Since we like our creamy foods rich, I kept the cream.  I used Uncle Ben's original recipe with wild rice.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very good.  I made the mistake of adding extra rice and it came out VERY thick.  As others suggested I used half and half instead of heavy cream and I added carrots to the mix.  I will make this again.

Amazing soup. I can't wait to make this in the winter. Can't think of a better meal to come home to after a long day spent in the snowy cold.

I used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and it was still very, very thick. Next time I make it, I'm going to use a little less flour.

Definitely add some veggies - it really makes the soup!

Mmm. Mmm.

Excellent recipe.  Followed as is except added some carrots, onions and celery.  Also added a little skim milk towards the end because it was a little too thick for me.  Very tasty.  My 5 yr old gave it two thumbs up.  Will make again.

So yummy!! I can't wait to try it with the Uncle Ben's rice but I used half a cup of regular, slow cooking rice and just cooked it in the broth for about 15ish minutes and it was fine.
I subbed regular milk in for the cream, also fine.
To give it a bit of colour, I chopped up some carrots and threw them in the soup broth while I was cooking the rice in there.
My kids made me promise to make this one again!! Yay!!!

All I can say is "OOOHHHH YEAHHH"!  Great soup.  I followed everyone's advice and added carrots, mushrooms and celery.  I also added a bit of tarragon.  Next time I'm going to add mushrooms and corn for a little more variety.  Can't wait for the winter to make this easy dish!!

good soup instead of the heavy cream i used a can of cream of mushroom and I used water instead of broth since the soup is salty.  I also added frozen chopped broccoli and velveeta cheese (also salty) really hearty and delicious

My whole family loved this soup!  My 2 year old asked for "soup" at every meal for 3 days straight until it was all gone!  I will definitely make this again.  I think I will add shredded carrots next time though.

This soup is so awesome!  I added chopped carrots and celery, and mushrooms to it, and used light cream instead of heavy cream.  It was still fabulous and will become one of our fall/winter dinner staples.

This was very good - I used smoked pheasant instead of chicken which was wonderful.  I also added carrots.  Good the first day - awesome the next so the flavors all melt together.  Thanks!

Excellent, thick and hearty soup! I did not have the rice the recipe called for handy so I used white rice and a pack of Goya's "sazon".  It turned out great!

Completely worthy of its 5 star rating! I used half and half instead of cream. It's pretty thick. Wonderful flavor. I will try to saute carrots and celery with it next time. Great recipe.

I would have to say that this soup has to be one of the more hearty. I added mushrooms to give it more substance but regardless is very flavorful. With the season packet I got from a Wild Rice from Uncle Bens, the soup was too salty and I had to compromise the flavor by adding water. When I make this dish again, I'd do either two things, not add salt or add 3/4 of the season packet form the wild rice. I do believe that with those change, this would be a restaurant quality soup dish.

This is a great recipe, and even though it made a monstrous pot of soup (the problem with being single and cooking), the leftovers froze well.  I added half a cup of carrots, celery, and onion, and almost a cup of mushrooms.  Also two finely minced cloves of fresh garlic.  It was wonderful- a great comfort food after finishing a 12-mile road march in the snow!

I've tried a lot of different chicken and wild rice soups, and this one is delicious! I always add a few more spices than it calls for (bay leaves, oregano, and basil to start) and if you're going to eat it right away, its really good with some cheese melted in it!

Great, Easy recipe!!  I did add onion, carrots and celery for added flavor.  I make this soup quite often in the winter.
Thanks for posting this recipe.

This soup is excellent! I did follow many of the suggestions by other reviewers i.e. sauteed carrots, onions and celery first. I also only used half of the Uncle Ben's seasoning packet as I am weary of seasoning packets but it turned out great and I would def. use the whole packet next time. I did use 7 cups of chicken broth (Swanson's organic is my fave.)as I didn't want it too thick. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This soup got mixed reviews from my family.   I did saute added onion, celery and carrots in the butter.  I may add some poultry seasoning next time.  *Update* I also made this for a soup exchange (like a cookie exchange, only soups).  The response I have received is only positive--they loved it!

I was expecting more flavor.  The seasoning with the butter smelled soo good but when it came time to serve the soup it was ok just not as flavorful as I expected.  I did have a bowl the next day and still bland to me.  I won't make it again!  Sorry!

We really enjoyed this one!  I made with half and half to at least cut down on the fat a little!  At least it made me feel better!  It was a good winter pick me up! I cooked my chicken in the crock pot all day and that way it was ready to use in the soup and had made the stock for me as well!  Very good recipe!

This is SO good.  Added some carrots to veg it up a little.  My only complaint is that it is not very good for you.  I made it with half and half and that worked well, but I am not sure how to get around the butter.  But once in a while...this is DE-LISH!

We enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of rice we used egg noddles, but I think next time I'll try Orzo.  We added a little more salt for flavoring.

Very Good.  Very thick soup.  I added an extra cup of chicken broth and it was still thick.  I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream.  Next time I will use all milk as it was almost too rich.

I'm on a diet, so I made a few changes to make it more figure friendly... soooo yummy!!!  First I sauteed onion and celery in fat free butter before adding the broth.  I used all broth and no water.  I also substituted couscous for rice since it has more protein and fiber.  I probably only used about 2 tablespoons of butter for the whole recipe.  I also used fat free half and half and only 1/4 a cup of soy flour.  It still came out really thick and delicous!  One of the best soups ever!

This recipe is amazing! I added chopped onions, chopped carrots and sliced baby portabello mushrooms to the butter and cooked till softened before adding the flour. I used half and half in place of the cream. My family loved this soup, very very yummy. I wish I could give it more stars. Thanks so much!

Great recipe. I change it a little after reading one of the posts taht stated it lacked flavor. In my soup pot I poured in 3tbs olive oil and sauteed 1/2 yellow onion, 1/2 red pepper, 1 celery stalk, and 1 6" piece of carrot all diced. I also mashed and chopped 3 garlic cloves and added 1/4 teaspoon of ground red pepper to the flour mixture. Tasted great...thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

AMAZING!!!  This soup is a real keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful.  I've also tried it with 1 small onion chopped and 1 stalk celery chopped and sauteed in the butter.  Am looking forward to trying again with skim milk.... felt a little guilty getting seconds with the heavy cream.

I LOVE this soup. I substituted fat free skim milk for heavy cream, and added mushrooms, and it turned out great.

We loved this!!! I made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous. I did take the advice of others and sauted some onions, celery, carrots and garlic first. Also, I used all chicken broth instead of using any water. This was a quick, hearty, delicious meal. Thanks.

I've made this 2 times now and I LOVE it!!  What a great, creamy, flavorful soup.  I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice mix & whole milk, rather than cream, and it was fantastic.  I was looking to recreate a soup from the restaraunt I work in and hit the nail perfectly on the head.

Wonderful soup!  Made it exactly as suggested and it was great.  I may add carrots next time just for added nutrition and reduce the amount of cream used.  This is definately a keeper!

Homerun! This soup recipe is teriffic. I tried it for the first time about a week ago and it's definitely going in the keeper box. This tastes teriffic and the entire family loved it! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of replacing the heavy cream with half and half (same amounts) and I added a little more wild rice. Other than that, don't change a thing. If you want to add veggies, boil them in 2 cups of chicken broth and then add them about half way through the cooking time for the soup. When you want to heat up the leftovers, I would add a little milk because this soup gets really thick once you stick it in the fridge. Great recipe!!!

This soup was delicious.  My husband loved it.  My 6 year old son ate every bite, and was asking for it again the next day.  We do not give 5 stars lightly.  I modified the recipe based upon some of the other reviews.  I added two cloves of garlic and used 1% milk instead of the cream.  I also sauteed onion and mushrooms and added it to the soup.  It was even more delicious the second night.  I will definately make this a part of our winter meals.

I made this for a neighborhood party and it was delicious!  I used a rotissere chicken, sauteed 1/2C each onion, celery and carrots. I also used whole milk.  The next time I make it I will try 2% milk and less flour to make it a little healthier.  My kids ate up the leftover tonight!

Great Soup!!!!

They only changes I made to the soup were to use the mushroom flavor of the wild rice, cut  up a rotisserie chicken, diced carrot,onion and garlic. I also added fresh frozen corn nibblets.

Awesome soup! Only changes I made were to add some carrots, cut down on butter (used about 1/3 cup) and flour (about 1/2 cup) and used low fat half and half.  Delicious!

This is really good.  I used a rotissary chicken and fat-free half and half...otherwise I made just as directed.  Topped with some cracked black pepper, delicious.  Even my 3-year old daughter couldn't get enough!  It is good enough to serve to guests, which is what I will be doing in a bout a week.

This was SO GOOD.  I first sauteed some onion (about 1/2 white), some celery (2 stalks) and some carrots (9 baby) before adding the water, broth and chicken (1 lb).  I also first cooked the carrots with the chicken.  I used 6 Tbs butter, about 1/2 cup of flour, 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of half and half.  I also used Uncle Ben's quick cooking wild rice.  I will definitely make again.  My husband loved it.

This was great and easy to make.  I took some of the suggestions and used half & half.  I did not need to add anything to thin it for reheating.  It was thick in the bowl but once it was heated, it thinned out.

This soup was AMAZING! I am planning on making it again soon, and doubling it. I did make a few changes recommended by the others; I added onions, cellary, carrots as well as fresh garlic. Next time I make it I will add more rice as well. GREAT RECIPE!! A MUST TRY!!!

DELICIOUS and VERY EASY TO MAKE.  A couple of things I modified for myself are: instead of the multiple steps, I combined all the ingredients in one pot; I also used half & half instead of heavy cream, and used "I can't believe it's not butter" i/o real butter.  It's so good that my 14-month old son, who has put himself on a vegeterian diet, LOVED IT!  That's success to me!

Each year we have "18 days of Christmas" in  our office.  Each person makes something from their home to feed 36 people.  Every year everyone is greeting me at the door at 8am sharp and this soup did not fail! I added the celery and carrots that others had suggested. It was a little thick, so I added more cream and  1/4 cup of slivered almonds. This soup is what I fell in love with during Christmas in Minnesota - awesome!

Excellent soup! I added carrots, celery, onions, mushrooms, parsnips and turnips for extra veggies (plus I had them in the fridge) and I also used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup skim milk instead of heavy cream.

I incorporated most of the changes suggested by Carrie, but instead of milk I used a pint of half-and-half, and also added a small can of mushroom stems and pieces.  I also used leftover turkey instead of chicken.  Wonderful good!

This recipe was awesome!  After looking at several reviews, I put them together on what would work best.  I sauteed half cup of each: onion, carrots, and celery, in butter and garlic, after they were soft, I added, the broth and water, then the chicken.  I made the roux with half and half, and added a little less than half a cup of flour slowly (plenty thick). Added rice to other pot, then slowly stirred in cream mixture.  Cook for a little while to absorb chunks, perfect.

We LOVED this soup and I will be making it often!  The only change I need to make is the amount of butter--it seemed to have a bit too much sitting on top of the leftovers after it was refrigerated.  My rice was NOT quick cooking rice, so I actually added the rice, covered, and cooked it 20 minutes before continuing.  It was fabulous!

The soup is outstanding considering the simplicity of the recipe.  I did everything Brown Sugar Girl's review stated to do but omitted the wine, as it didn't need it.  I couldn't find the instant rice box, so I just added the non-instant box of mixed rice and boiled in the broth until it was done and then removed from the heat and finished the recipe.  Don't miss serving this soup to your family and friends.

The best soup ever.  You want to eat it so slow so it last, its that good.  I did do what one of the reviews said by adding celery and carrots, it added texture to it, it was delicious. Next time I am going to put it sourdough bread bowls,ummmmm.

Wow, this is just wonderful and my kids LOVED it!!  I also could not believe how easy and quick it was to make.  I too used milk instead of heavy cream and it was FABULOUS!  Thanks so much I will be sharing this with many others!

I wish I could give this more stars! I couldn't find the quick cook rice called for so I used Mahatmas Long Grain & Wild Rice. The recipe calls for reserving the spice packet to be mixed with the roux, but since Mahatmas combines the rice with the spices I couldn't. I just cooked the rice, spices and all, and added it to the soup. I added onion, carrots, corn, a dash of garlic powder and the flavor was sooo good! Last thing: I mistakenly grabbed half/half instead of heaving cream, and still the soup was perfectly thick. And delicious! You cannot go wrong with this recipe. Try it!

This is the best creamy chicken and wild rice soup I have ever had.  Easy and very tasty!  I made a few minor alterations.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth (not quite 4 cups).  I added a little extra water and a tablespoon of chicken bouillon granules.  I also added one stalk of celery and about 10 sliced baby carrots.  I used a pint of half and half.  Next time I will add a little more liquid.  It turned out pretty thick.

Excellent soup for a cold night.  I substituted light cream for the heavy cream and used slightly less flour.  Also, I used Near East Brand Wild Rice.  Great recipe!

This is a great recipe - I followed everything to the letter and it turned out very very good.  It is Excellent for what it is.  Next time I make this (which will probably be the second of many!) I will be trying the carrot/celery variations suggested by other members.  Thanks for an easy, great recipe.

I've been looking for an easy to make wild rice soup for a long time.  This is the best.  It's kinda funny though, I picked up the wrong kind of rice.  I picked up "Uncle Ben's Chicken and Wild" instead of the long grain wild rice.  But let me tell you it tasted AWESOME!
I won't make it any other way and I recommend it to anyone. 

Also making it with milk is good too, that way it doesn't get thick the next day.  Thanks for this, it rocks.

Loved, loved, loved the soup! I used Rice-a-roni cheesy rice (not the instant) and just added it to my broth and simmered it for 20 min with carrots and celery.  Definately restaurant quality.  I will make this one again and again.

I did what some suggested and used whole milk instead of the cream. I also added carrots, celery, onion and garlic, but still thought it was kind of bland. I threw in a can of great northern beans, mushrooms, corn and a few handfuls of baby spinach and ended up with a really hearty white minestrone.

So easy to make and very good.  I also used a rotisserie chicken for ease and taste.  I did have to add some extra milk to thin it some, especially when reheating.  Might try half and half next time, but will surely make it again.

I made this soup last night and it was good....it wasn't amazing. It was very salty and too thick. I think 2% milk would have been better than heavy cream. It's thick like a chowder and I think it lacks seasoning. If I were to make this again I would add more rice, thin it out and add herbs.

I used less sodium chicken broth and added sauteed carrots and celery when the rice is added. I also used 2% milk instead of heavy cream. This recipe got rave reviews and we're already trying to decide what else to add next time I make it, we're thinking broccoli!

If I could give this ten stars, I would. I used a premade rotisserie chicken because of time contraints and also used NON-instant rice.  I cooked the rice separately and added it to the soup.  The CREAMIEST, most wonderful rice soup I've ever hand. Beats even Panera Breads! 

Not low in fat or calories but worth the splurge on cold, wintery days. TO reheat and eat later, add a little water and heat up. It will thicken overnight.

Delicious soup!  My husband & I were craving Panera's soup & when I saw this recipe, I had to try it!  Its wonderful.  We served it with warm crusty bread - YUM!  I added an extra can of chicken broth because I used a whole Rotisserie chicken.  I would not change a thing.

Excellent! Even better the second day --it was a bit thicker.  I also used skim milk instead of the heavier cream.  I also added diced carrot, celery and onion.  WONDERFUL!!

This was absolutely delicious!! I used 2% milk instead of cream and it was still very thick & hearty. I also used light butter instead of regular and it didn't seem to make any difference. I will definitely be making this again!

Very, very good!  Have to agree with the others though - I used skim milk and came out plenty thick.  This has become a staple in our house!

A wonderful, comforting, creamy soup for a cold night.  A great use for my leftover roast chicken.  I did saute some finely chopped onion, carrot, and celery prior to adding the broth.  Super rich, a small bowl or cup is satisfying.  Thanks for the submission, great recipe!

Excellent, and yes I added red peppers, carrots, and onions; it is awesome and tasty.  I did use half and half and whole milk combo and it did just fine!  I suppose I will try the 1% milk next time.

This is the first review I've written, but I simply HAD to write about this wonderful soup. Even my hard-to-please husband loved this soup. Asked me to add it to our "repetoire". It's thick enough to satisfy him but not so thick that I don't care for it (I don't like really thick soup).  The flavor is awesome and it's not even hard to make.

I have a new favorite to make with left over rotisserie chicken!

This is a very hearty, heavy soup.  Truly thick.  Thicker than you think.  Restaurant thick.  It thickens up A LOT in the fridge if there are leftovers.  Add a little milk when you reheat it. It turns out great.  This is absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

I love a thick soup, but this was far too thick and I had to add a lot of skim milk to thin it down to a reasonable soup consistency.  However, the taste was good and I would make it again with less flour and perhaps half and half instead of heavy cream.  My guests liked it and took some home with them.

The soup tastes very good!  I used two boxes of rice-a-roni and added a can of corn which gives it a nice taste.  For whatever reason, though, the rice didn't cook all the way through, so the soup is slightly crunchy (but fortunately, only slightly).  It's still really good though.

This soup was easy and tasty. I did not have already cooked chicken so I boiled the chicken in broth and then shredded it, put it back in the pot and followed the recipe from there. This is a thick soup, which I like, but it is more of a chowder consistency. I used light cream which is what I had but probably would just use milk next time so it's not quite as thick. Definately needs seasoning, I used salt and pepper, garlic powder and a little crushed red pepper. I also added a can of corn which I think went really well with it. Will definately make again.

My husband said that the soup was restaurant-quality.  I added fresh mushrooms, carrots, and celery.  I also substituted thyme for poultry seasoning, substituted wide egg noodles for the rice, omitted the salt, and added lots of fresh ground pepper.  Delish!

I used non-fat milk instead of the heavy cream, and the soup was thick enough.  Next time I will try adding mushrooms and diced carrots.  It was a delicious soup!

Absolutely wonderful, and easy to make!  I  
made this on a Sunday, because I had my son's baseball practice on Monday night.  I just reheated it, and served it with sliced french bread and salad.  Will defintely make this again and again.
***Also, I added sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms and a bit of chopped up onion.
A very nice addition.

I made this recipe exactly as it called for, but the roux seemed very thick when I added the cream already.  I let it cook a while, but it formed a really thick paste.  I thought the recipe was going to be a bust, but I continued and once the roux and broth cooked together for 10 minutes or so, it did thicken and the soup was nice and creamy.  After eating about a half a serving though, the intense flavor did get a bit overwhelming with every bite.  I did freeze half of it to have at a later date, but I don't know if I would make it again...

Simply AMAZING! I doubled the recipe useing 2 boxes of uncle bens wild rice, cooking the chicken breasts in chicken broth, cooking the rice separetly, and sauteing the veggies then using the same broth I cooked the chicken in, added the veggies and rice to it- and finally after cutting up the chicken added it then finished with the half and half I used.I took servings to several friends and all they could do was rave and ask for more! I did take some out and blend it in the blender w/some half and half - I also added a TB of cornstarch to some broth at the end - Will be making this again and again!  thanks for a super recipe

This soup is absolutely awesome.  I made it for the Super Bowl and everyone loved it.  It's VERY easy to make and delicious.  I added four chicken breasts rather than the two the recipe called for because my husband is a "meat" freak.  I will definitely keep this in my "favorites" file.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  I'm told it could use a bit more rice, and it was a bit too thick.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe.  My husband had 3 helpings!!!  I thought it needed a little something when I was making it so I added steamed broccoli and carrots and it turned out perfect.  This one is a keeper!

This is a delicious soup, although, I will have to agree that it is only a touch above the canned variety.  It will make a great base for a chicken pot pie with a homeade biscuit crust for tommorrow...just add mixed vegetables.

FANTASTIC! Never made homemade soup, but it came out great.  Very thick and very RICH.  Perfect for a cold day.  Used a rotisserie chicken, may have used more than what is called for, but enjoyed the extra chicken. Used Uncle Bens Rice.  Great comfort food.

quick and easy.  used Deans Light Cream (18% milkfat) and the richness was still there and not overwhelming.  Also used some of the left over chicken broth as the thinner for thinning the next day.  Very good, thanks!

This is by far the most fattening, yet yummiest soup I've ever tasted!  My family loved it, even my picky 14 year old, and there was so much left over (it's very rich) that I had enough to share with friends, who also had rave reviews.  Thanks Stephanie!

This is the best soup I think I have ever had!  My boyfriend & I have made this 3 or 4 times, and only found the recipe a month or so ago!  We also add carrots & celery.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!!
