My kids & I loved this cake. It was not dry & the frosting was the best. Couldn't really taste the coffee in the cake, & the chocolate flavor was mild but there was a "subtle" difference compared to most cakes. The kids asked for seconds.

This cake is wonderful and I've never been a huge fan of coffee. The coffee flavor is very subtle and it's mostly the moist chocolate cake that you taste. It's my youngest daughter's new favorite cake and I know I'll be making this for her birthday for many years to come! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Made this cake last week.  This was the: 1. First layer cake I have ever made 2. First cake I have ever made from scratch 3. First icing I have ever made from scratch  This cake could not have been easier to make.  However, it didn't taste like I anticipated it.  The cake did turn out very moist and very rich.  I would make it again for company!

It was fine nothing special though. It's kind of like red velvet cake without the red color. It looks like a spice cake and tastes... sweet but doesn't have an identifiable flavor. I should've added some vanilla. I made six cupcakes & a 9x13. The 9x13 would've been fine for the entire recipe but I wasn't sure with all those eggs how big this baby was going to get. 'Didn't make the frosting; used homemade cream cheese frosting instead. If it were as good as the batter I'd be in trouble.

The cake portion of this is fine. The frosting recipe has a major flaw! Either too much butter or not enough confectioner's sugar. I had to add more too it and ran out bc I didn't have enough. The taste was good but the consistency was horrible!!

My grandmother made this cake but I couldn't find her recipe. Glad to have it. I would suggest to everyone to check your ingredients. Only use the finest ingredients. The cocoa powder vanilla and espresso coffee should make a deeper chocolate flavor without too much added sweetness.

I made this and it turned out fine. Iâ€™d call it a mocha cake. The buttercream turned out fine, but there is not enough to frost a three layer cake. I had to go back to the store for more sugar and butter so I could halve the recipe and frost the sides. Unfortunately, halving the recipe made for an inconsistent frosting. If I make this again, I would double the buttercream recipe.
