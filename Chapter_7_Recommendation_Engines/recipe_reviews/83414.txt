This was a great recipe.  Instead of pounding the chicken flat and rolling it, I made a pocket in the chicken breast and stuffed the ham and cheese stick inside.  I cut the cheese sticks in half and rolled them up in the ham.  This kept the cheese from oozing out. I sealed the pocket closed with toothpicks and then rolled the chicken in the butter and bread crumbs. Very easy!

These were great. I made the recipe "Chicken Cordon Blue II" (also from this site) the night before and had some sauce left over, so I made this recipe for the chicken the second day and served it with that sauce to do a comparison. To me the sauce is the best part so I would probably recommend that recipe over this one. However, I think I enjoyed the chicken more with this recipe because it was so juicy. So if you make this recipe, try making the sauce from the other recipe to go along with it. You'll love it.

Good recipe simple directions to follow. My only advice is to incorporate a sauce otherwise its a little on the dry side.

Family loved this chicken dish. I did not pound out the chicken breasts. I had 4 large chicken breasts about 1/2 pound each and I was able to slice an opening down the middle of each breast to put the rolled up ham slices and cheese. I used about 3  tooth picks per chicken breast. My bread crumbs were not seasoned so I added 1 tsp Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I also went ahead and decided to add my own sauce since one review said it was a little dry alone. I mixed one can cream of chicken soup(98% fat free) with about 1/4-1/2 cup white cooking wine and poured it over the chicken before baking. I cooked it for about an hour or until the soup mixture got bubbly.

It was very easy to make, and tasted so good!!  It is hard to get the toothpicks out, so I suggest taking them out before serving the dish so that your guests don't have to go digging.  Other than that, it was excellent!

I LOVED this recipe!  I will be cooking this again to entertain.  I also fried  the chicken in butter then baked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Very tender and appealing to the eye as well.

This recipe would've been great if it had a different cheese. I made it tonight using the cheese sticks and they didn't melt and it was in the oven about 50 minutes at about 375 degrees. My husband requested chicken cordon bleu but this isn't what he expected. It isn't bad, it just isn't good. Next time I will be using either sliced cheese or shreded and I won't be pounding the chicken, it's easier to just make a pocket and stuff everything in it. A lot of effort that didn't pay off.

I really like this recipe. It's definitely messy, but its quick and very tasty.  I used 2 slices of virginia ham and 1 slice of swiss, and rolled up the chicken and secured with a bunch of toothpicks and the cheese did not run out at all. I will make this again!

Great, easy recipe.  I made it for my boyfriend and his room-mates and they loved it!  The local store was out of bread crumbs so I used cornflake crumbs and it still tasted great.

I think this recipe is great, and I made it exactly as posted the first time, but I revised it a little my second time around and ended up liking it better.  I used sharp cheddar cut off of a block instead of mozzarella because I find that you can taste it more, I dipped the chicken in olive oil after I had rolled it, instead of butter to make it a little healthier, I used whole wheat italian bread crumbs which have a great flavor to them.  I saved the best ingredient for last: after I dipped them in the olive oil, and before I breaded them, I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with Adobo seasoning.  Just that sprinkling gave it such an amazingly different flavor and I highly recommend trying it for yourself.  I hope this helps someone. Enjoy!!!

This recipe is almost exactly the same one I've been using for the past 20 years. The difference is I use three thin slices of ham and two thin slices of swiss per chicken breast. A trick that works well is to skip the toothpicks and put the rolled up chicken breasts in a loaf pan-typically a 9x5 size. About 10 minutes before the end baking time (I do bake mine at 375 for 40 minutes), melt a couple TBS of butter and pour over top of chicken.

Super easy and the kids beg me to make it again! And to think I wasted all that time making it from "scratch" without shortcuts. String cheese in the middle.... genius!

My sweetheart was out tonight so I decided to make chicken "roll ups" as the kids call them. I am glad she was gone too because she would never have let me roll the chicken in melted butter preferring milk or something less fattening. I followed your recipe to the letter and  found it quite delicious. Next time I will add a few herbs and spices just to make this recipe my own. I'm tossing my old recipe because it was more labor intensive and doesn't come out noticeably better.
Thanks for a relatively easy and yummy recipe.

simple and ellegent! I will make this again, I also used swiss and left over Christmas ham. I dipped in butter then in bread crumbs then in buttermilk and bread crumbs again, we love crunchy topping! I would suggest to put more cheese and don't cook as long if it is to dry.. thank you for this recipe

I am taking a star off just because I did change this quite a bit. It is a fantastic starting point though!  I omitted the butter/breading and instead used beaten egg and almond flour to make it gluten free. Super easy and turned out Wonderfully!   I also added a sauce as someone else recommended from the Chicken Cordon Bleu II recipe- which is really a great finishing touch and worth it.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

One of the first dinners I made for my future in-laws and they loved it.  Was moist, cheesy, and full of flavor.  Will definitely be making this again.

Very Good! I really thought it was going to be a disaster as I was preparing this (lil messy), but there were NO leftovers!  I served this with angel hair pasta in a butter/2% milk/garlic sauce so I didn't need another sauce for the chicken.  It came out very moist and tasty.  I will be making this again.

This is a great dish.  The only changes made were that I used swiss cheese instead of string, and Shake N' Bake coating for the crust and beaten egg instead of butter prior to coating.  I also baked for 30 minutes instead of 40.  The chicken was done but very juicy.  I prepared some chicken gravy, just in case (as some others have suggested), but found that with the chicken being so juicy, the gravy wasn't really needed.  Delicious!

Per other reviewers, I covered the stuffed chicken in flour first, mixed 1/4 butter with 1/2 c. chicken broth for the "dip," and covered with panko bread crumbs. Absolutely delicious!!!

Tastes great and ended up baking the chicken within 28 minutes instead of 30-35 minutes.  I dipped the rolled up chicken into butter before rolling it around in a plate of bread crumbs.  Worked out just fine.

To make this even better make the Betty Crocker Hollodaise Sauce to pour over individual servings.  The combination is to die for!

THis was an excellent recipe however i think i pounded the chicken a little too thin because it was hard to toothpick together. I used grated mozza cheese instead of cheese strings.

Excellent and so easy.. you can add whatever extra seasoning you want to the coating. I did make a kind of alfredo type sauce to spoon over the top. I made it for my aunt and she raved about it.

I tried this with regular big eye swiss cheese.  It was delicious.   I am definitely going to keep this one and use again.

ohmygosh ... this is the best recipe ... beyond yummy ... I pounded my chicken breasts ... used string cheese plus a bit of low fat cheddar ... and black forrest ham ... followed recipe as worded ... except, I didn't use all of the butter ... so I poured the rest into the over the chicken ... a bit of the cheese oozed out and into the butter ... which only made the dish all the better because I simply poured this over the top after it was done ... I served with boiled potatoes that are boiled then sauteed until golden and french green beans with arugala (sp?) salad ... omg ... what an amazing meal and I made this for a Monday evening!!  It was simply an experiment ... but this dish is definitely company appropriate!!  Definitely give it a try ...

We liked this dish.  I used cheddar because I didn't have mozzarella or Swiss.  I dipped the chicken in egg (based on a review for a similar recipe) and then assembled and rolled in crumbs.  Added melted butter, drizzled over the top about halfway thru baking.  I do think 40 minutes is a bit long...maybe I just pounded the chicken too thin or something.

I just cooked this for the first time ever.  My 15 year old picked it out of my recipe box for her birthday dinner.  I have to say it was one of the best things I ever cooked.  It was hard to stop eatting it!

Absolutely delicious and easy recipe. One version I tried was using boneless skinless chicken thighs. They had incredible flavour and were perfect size. I found sometimes the chicken breast was too large. Definitely a keeper!!!

Yummy!   I made 2 changes, but this was a delicious, easy recipe.  First change was swiss cheese, and 2nd was Panko bread crumbs.  The whole family really enjoyed.  So nice to make something different, but easy with chicken.

I really liked this as an alternative to the store bought frozen ones.  I scaled it down to just 2 servings as it was just for me and my husband.  I used wedges of Garlic and Herb Laughing Cow Cheese (next time I will try the Swiss flavor) instead of string cheese and brushed them with olive oil instead of butter before rolling them in the breadcrumbs.  Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a more healthy version than my old recipe where I browned the chicken in shortening (no wonder it was so good!).  This is a good compromise.

To keep chicken moist, put cheese inside as instructed, wrap in bacon & follow the rest of the recipe.  Same great flavor & moist.

This was so good!  I use Baby Swiss instead and Italian bread crumbs.  I also sliced a the chicken and made a pocket instead.  It turned out amazing.  Our dinner quests were very pleased and so were we.  It's going on the regular rotation for dinner time.

As others have said a sauce is needed for this. I also suggest the cordon bleu II recipe for sauce. You can do the first part without the chicken boiling down the wine and adding cheese. I like to add a little oregano to the cheese and ham for some extra flavor.  Also here is an extremely helpful tip I'm sure you'll use time and again. Instead of using toothpicks try some dried spaghetti instead. That way you can cook the chicken and leave the spaghetti in there! no fuss with toothpicks.

My family loved it. I didn't have bread crumbs. So I used garden flavored croutons & and rolled them into crumbs. I also used sliced Swiss cheese and sandwich ham. Loved how simple the recipe was.

I made this for my parents, sister, and husband tonight. I used Canadian bacon and low fat provolone, however, and instead of bread crumbs, we used French fried onions. It was a huge hit!

I made this recipe according the instructions the first time and it was a big hit with my husband and mother in-law.  The second time I made it for company and did not have ham so I sub'd bacon-WOW!  What an unbelievable transformation...I also didn't have time to make the sauce so I just used jarred chicken gravy...everyone loved it.  Will make this again.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It was very easy to put together since I followed the advice of some other reviewers and made a pocket in the breasts instead of pounding and rolling.  I also browned them in butter before baking.  I made half with mozzarella and half with swiss cheese.  Both were very tasty.  Will definitely be making these again and again.  Thanks for such an easy recipe.

I make something similar to this and we just love it, instead of string cheese I use smoked provolone, and spread the inside of the chicken with some honey dijon mustard before adding the ham and cheese.  Then I roll it up and put the toothpics in, dip it in a beaten egg, and then roll it in a mixture of Italian bread crumbs, garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  Bake in a sprayed baking pan, and turn over halfway through baking time so each side gets browned. So moist and good, no sauce needed!  And less fat since you don't use the butter.

I've been making this version for years.  I add seasonings (onion and garlic powder) and parmesan cheese to my breadcrumbs and the smell while baking is incredible. I only bake for 25 or 30 minutes since the chicken is boneless and it doesn't get dry.  mmm, mmm, mmm.

I too, like someone else said, browned the chicken on all sides in a skillet of butter and olive oil. Then I placed the chicken in a baking pan and covered with foil. I baked it for 30-35 minutes-removing the foil the last 5-10 minutes. It was very moist and delicous! The family loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

This was really tasty, although the cheese sticks didn't really melt. In the future, I will use reg mozz and also, if you can't get the chick breasts pounded thin enough (which I can't) it needs to stay in the oven 10-15 min longer.

My husband is definitely not a chef.  He really wanted to make dinner and this is what he did.  It was yummy and looked super impressive.  I only give it 4 because I'd probably want some sort of sauce for the next time I make it.  Having said that, the cheese and ham kept the chicken from drying out.  We served with mashed potatoes so the sauce wouldn't been great to smoosh all together.  If you did make a sauce, you wouldn't need much!  Thanks for helping to make my hubby feel like a pro!

I did as some others mentioned and cut a pocket in the chicken instead of pounding it because I had nothing to pound it with. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious, thanks for sharing!

Wanting to use what I had on hand, I used shredded cheese and crushed Triscuits instead of breadcrumbs. Looks like we can use whatever crackers available or maybe even cornflakes. Just put them in a plastic bag and use a rolling pin to crush them finely.In 3 of them I used broccoli instead of ham. They were so good! Better than store bought.

This was easy and tasty.  I used one slice of thick sliced sandwich ham and thought it could have used more and maybe more cheese, as it ran out when it melted.  The chicken breasts I had were quite large and perhaps I should have accommodated for this.

This was a good meal, it had good flavor.  Our string cheese stick didn't melt which upset the chef(my wife).  We will use the shredded cheese if we make it again.

This turned out great but I did add some more butter to the remaining butter from dipping chicken in it... and poured it over the chicken about 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven. Very yummy! Mary Lou

This was so good, I am making it again tomorrow night!  After reading the reviews for this and the Cordon Bleu II, I combined suggestions and prepared this way: DO NOT make the mistake I made and get "thin chicken breasts" (Purdue?)  They are not large enough for this.  Use pkg of regular or even split breasts.  Pound them down to 1/2" or so thickness and marinate them in Italian dressing for a few hours.  I rinsed, then assembled using 1/2 stick of string cheese wrapped in a Swiss cheese slice folded in half, and then wrapped in the ham.  Depending on size of breasts used, this method can be tailored.  Mine were small so I had to improvise.  I used toothpicks to secure, but will use cooking string next time.  I mixed 1 C of both panko and bread crumbs and 2 T flour along with the paprika.  Add seasonings to crumbs according to servings/taste, or you can season with Italian herbs if you don't want to marinate.  I dipped each roll in beaten egg, then in crumb mixture til well covered and pan fried on medium in 3 Tb. each EVOO and butter until browned.  I placed these in a baking dish and finished in the oven at 350 d. for 15-20 min to cook thoroughly.  I made the sauce from another recipe on the stove and poured over top after baked-- 1 C heavy cream  1/2 cup dry white wine  1 t chicken bouillon granules,  1 T cornstarch  This had too much wine taste for me, so I will cut that in half next time.

Made it with crushed jacobs cream crackers instead of breadcrumbs and it was perfect!  I will use a different cheese next time (I used mozarella) something with a stronger flavour like camembert

This recipe was certainly easier than pounding out chicken into thin cutlets and rolling the filling in.  I slit my pre-washed and trimmed chicken breasts slightly frozen for easier cutting. ( be careful not to cut in too far or leaking of filling will be a problem )   I had left over Ham from Easter...so that worked out well, but both my Hubby and  I agree that the String Cheese was to mild.  Certainly easy, but tastless.  Next time I will cut chunks of Swiss cheese to a sharper contract to the Sweet Ham slices and mild Chicken.   I Keep a mixture of crackers crumbs, Grated Parm. Cheese, minced Garlic, Fresh Parsley and salt and Pepper ready to go in a Zipper Bag in my Freezer for breading.  So that made this recipe even easier to pull together.  Baking time was increased to about 60 mins to make up for the partially frozen Chicken.  Over-all,......Very good. Easy  With a few personal tweeks,  a Keeper for sure.

Absolutely Delicious  meal.
After baking chicken CB, I poured the remaining juice from baking dish into sauce pan and added white wine and simmered, then added 1/2 & 1/2 to thicken.
I will make this one many times again. My husband loved it.

This tasted great, but I could not get this chicken to brown. Any suggestions? I increased the heat, cooked 10 minutes longer than called for and even put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes.

Very good and simple. Way too much butter, however, I ended up tossing about half of it out. Takes practice to get the chicken rolled neatly - mine definitely did not look like the picture, but they tasted good.

very good! I used a slice of black forest ham and swiss cheese instead of cheese stick. I pounded the breasts really thin and only cooked for 30 minutes and it was perfect! A real hit! Hint: Count and use the same amount of toothpicks on each breast so they are easily located and removed! I used different numbers and wasn't sure if I got them all!

Made this last night and the family really liked it but thought it could use a little more flavor.  It is a great, easy recipe to have on hand on a busy weeknight.  The only thing I did different was bake it for only 20 minutes because my chicken breasts were quite small.  I will make sure to use larger ones next time to make all the filling ingredients easier to cover.   I will defintely make this again but I will try it with Swiss cheese and try the sauce I see that others have recommended from the Chicken Cordon Bleu II receipe.  I don't think the sauce is really necessary since the chicken was very tender but would like to try it for the added flavor. Overall - a definite keeper!

this was so easy and such a great flavor.  I made a couple of changes, I ended up using mozzarella cheese since that's what I had on hand and seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and grey sea salt before wrapping.  Excellent!!! And did I say so easy with a great flavor?  Thanks for sharing

This recipe is great! I thought making chicken Cordon Bleu was much more difficult. But this was quick and easy, a little messy but worth it... maybe next time I will just stuff the chicken instead of trying to roll it.. and use either shredded mozzorela cheese or sliced.. it will melt quicker then the string cheese. but great recipe I will definatly cook this again!!

I purchased the thin chicken cutlets to save some time.  I did several things different because I felt the orginal recipe would not have enough flavor for our family.  I used honey ham and brushed one side with a light coating of honey dijon mustard.  I also used Swiss sliced cheese.  I coated the chicken in seasoned bread crumbs and added some salt, pepper, paprika, and 2 pinches of garlic powder to the breading.  We didn't think it was dry at all.  I also used the spaghetti instead of the toothpicks.  It was much easier to work with.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will be making this again.

This was very good! I actually like the string cheese (I used mozzarella) better than the traditional Swiss, and I liked dipping the chicken rolls in melted butter instead of my usual egg wash (which I end up topping each one with a pat of butter anyway).  I used preseasoned Italian bread crumbs and added some sweet paprika (mostly for color).  The only down side was I found that leftovers did not reheat well - the cheese sticks were nice and melty right out of the oven, but after refrigerating and reheating they lost that meltiness and were kind of like globs of cheese.  So, no leftovers next time! But I will make this again! Thanks Holly!

Super easy super scrumptious.  I am rating this recipe AS IS.  Using spaghetti in place of toothpics is a HUGE help .  It was a little crunchy to eat, but much easier than dealing with the toothpicks. I also used Broccoli and Cheese soup as a topper which made this recipe a 10+ star in my book.  Thanks!

I dip the rolled chicken in egg, not butter, and use shredded mozzarella instead of string cheese, because it melts better.  I serve this with a simple mustard sauce: honey + mustard + onion powder.

Awesome recipe!  I had all the ingredients on hand and used deli sliced ham and swiss.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful, pretty quick and pretty easy.  A great weeknight meal.  I did add the wine sauce from "Chicken Cordon Bleu II" and that really pushed the whole dish over the top, it was amazing.  My kids were licking the plate and they're always the toughest critics!  We'll definitely make this recipe again, I'd recommend it to anyone. It tastes like you spent WAY more time on it than you did!

Very easy and good.  I used swiss cheese instead of the string cheese, and used a thin sliced deli ham (several pieces).   It did need a sauce, so I made a white gravy and drizzled a little over each chicken breast.  I will definitely make this again, but do recommend the changes.

This was very good. I used shredded mozza cheese instead of the cheesestring. Also followed other suggestions and made the Cordon Bleu II sauce to pour over it (very good!!).

I made this with pepper jack cheese and it was awesome!  To reduce the fat content, I sprayed the chicken with olive oil and then coated them in bread crumbs.

I tried this recipe and it was great. I didn't use string cheese I used slice and it was messy and cooked all out but my family loved it and the chicken was very moist. I added extra seasoning to my bread crumbs. I will try string cheese the next time.

I stuffed the chicken breasts with additional cheese, pepperjack. Topped chicken breasts with alfredo sauce & baked an additional 10 minutes since my chicken breasts were thick. Very good! My boyfriend gobbled it up:)

Love this recipe!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added a sauce - the sauce from the Chicken Cordon Bleu II recipe from this website. I think it would have been dry without it.  Putting this together was so quick and easy!  The string cheese was a great idea.  You just unwrap it!  I didn't pound my chicken breasts because I bought the thinly cut ones from the store.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for my family and had a couple of my sons friends want to stay and eat when they saw what we were having.  I had made extra so that we would have some left over for lunch the next day.  I used turkey ham instead of ham and I didn't have string cheese sticks, so I used regular mozzarella cut into sticks.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved these.  I had 20 year old young men asking me for the recipe.  I had to laugh about that!  These were easy to do and a HUGE hit.  Needless to say, no leftovers.

didn't really change anything and it was DELICIOUS! Hubby and I both loved it. Thank you!  Oh - I did use a few pads of butter on top before putting in the oven for some extra crisp and yum factor - and fat but who's counting ;)

Simple to make, we only used one pan to prepare and cook! With kraft's parmesan bread crumbs and some honey ham from the deli, the taste was wonderful for how easy it was. Wonderful.

We loved it, we used lunch meat ham and shredded mozerella cheese.  Better ham would make it better, and it would be very easy to play with different cheeses. But it really took only 20 minutes for me to prepare.  So few recipes 'prep' time really take what they say.  Will definately make it again!  The great thing about this recipe besides being easy, is that everything that is used to make it are all things I keep on hand...no weird or special ingredients.

I thought the chicken was very moist however I agree in that it does need some sort of sauce.  We dipped ours in Ranch Dressing as that was all we had on hand.  It was fine that way.  Husband loved it!  VERY EASY!

I made this last night and hubby loved it..told me we don't have to buy the pre-made ones again!  The only thing different that I used was crushed ceaser crutons for that extra kick...and next time we will use a tomato based sause in the last 15-20min of cooking... other then that this recipe is yummy!!

Very tasty.  I followed the directions exactly, and added herbs de provence and rotisserie seasoning to the bread crumbs.  Instead of toothpicks, I used bamboo skewers to close up the rolls with.  Then I trimmed the excess by snapping the skewer close.  The flavor is very buttery.  It was hard for me to flatten the chicken breast using a rolling pin.

For those who have difficulty removing toothpicks, I suggest using the small "skewers" which come with the turkey lacing kits.  They work well for me and are easily removed. Delicious recipe.

Easy, yummy, and quick..the perfect meal for a week night! I used swiss cheese slices instead of string cheese because that is what I had.

Disappointed in this recipe.  Very bland - absolutely no flavor.  Easy to make but needs something to make it taste good.

Loved this!  Took the advice of others and added a sauce from another recipe.  I waited until half way through the baking time to add the sauce to ensure that it didn't wash the bread crumbs off the chicken. It was perfect!

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes, and he loved it! I didn't think the breadcrumbs stuck to the butter very well...but will try it again. Easy, and good.

Very very tasty. I liked that the recipe was simple. My problem is I couldn't really get the chicken wrapped around the stuff. I think my chicken breasts were too thick, but I pounded for an eternity.

As other reviews have suggested...I would add a sauce because it was a little dry and perhaps two slices of ham...Extremely easy to make!  I am adding this recipe to my box!

I used Weight watchers string cheese and sarah Lee's 45 calorie bread for the bread crumbs to make this dish even more healthy.  It was pretty danged good.  I will make it again.

The whole family loved it! I cut up an onion and added it to the mixture while it was marinating. The sauce is great and it's really easy to do. We now make this recipe often. The kids even liked it!

It was pretty good and would do just for a family night or close friend dinner.  For a nicer meal, I'd stick to a more traditional recipe.

If the cheese had stayed in the chicken, this would have been a very good recipe.  Unfortunately, it all melted outside of the chicken (even with multiple toothpicks holding them).  If I can figure a way of keeping the cheese in, this will be an excellent, easy recipe.

I just made this and the family loved it! My husband and I are on a low carb diet so the only thing I changed was the breading. I used crunched up pork rinds and it gave it a slight kick!!! Will make this again next week!!!! It's easy and great tasting!!!

I make this using thin deli ham and  cheese slices.  Usually use Swiss or muenster cheese.  Pepper jack works, too.  My kids and husband love it and there are never any leftovers!  I also use panko breadcrumbs for the extra crunch.

I pounded the chicken out flat -, I used deli thin ham ,shredded mozzarella cheese, closed with tooth picks, rolled in butter and rolled generously in Panko Italian flavored bread crumbs baked at 350 for 45 minutes..... made a white wine sauce consisting of 1/2 stick butter, 1 cup white wine, 1/2 cup milk , thicken with corn starch then blend with emulsion blender   ALL I CAN SAY IS AWESOME!!

We just had this for dinner tonight and I'll share my experiences with it.  We feel the recipe has some potential and we're going to change some things the next go around.  I'm going to use swiss instead of string cheese and more of it, cook it at a higher temp (most likely 400), and season the chicken more.  Here is my opinion of it as is.  Pros:  -Great base to work with if you haven't made Chicken Cordon Blue before. -Not difficult to make -Has potential  Cons:  -Dry -Lacks flavor in the middle -Cooking time longer than expected to reach a safe eating temperature

Turned out simply wonderful and so easy to prepare! The only thing I changed was using olive oil to coat the chicken instead of butter for a healthier spin. The mozzarella is an excellent choice, especially for those who do not like Swiss cheese!

This recipe is delicious... the only thing that I did different is used swiss cheese instead of string cheese.  It was one of few dishes that everyone ate so I didn't need to make something different for my 5 year old.  Have made twice in the last week, and is definitely my new favorite.

EXCELLENT! I didnt have bread crumbs so I used stuffing mix and it was very good. Also used swiss cheese instead of string cheese. Make sure you secure tightly with toothpicks, the center oozes out very easily!

Only thing it was missing was a sauce so I used one from another Cordon Bleu recipe. Other than that, it was very easy to make. I used shredded mozzarella cheese rather than cheese sticks and it was fine.

I took a cue from a member review here and made the sauce from the "Chicken Cordon Bleu II" recipe and served the sauce with this recipe - a real treat! Don't be afraid of using as many toothpicks as needed to keep the cheese from oozing out - I was generous with the toothpicks and the cheese stayed in place.

I followed the directions, except I used Swiss cheese. I didn't have a problem with the cheese leaking out. My husband wants to try it with bacon instead of ham next time. I will make this again for sure!

this recipe was very easy to make, but i only gave it three stars as i didn't care for the flavor. i have never had chicken cordon bleu before this, so can't say for sure if it was the recipe or the combination of the chicken, ham and cheese.

My family loved this dish. My 4 year old ate an entire chicken breast. I had never seen him eat so much!  The whole time between bites telling me I need to make this again.  Everyone else agreed.  This one is a definite keeper.  I did nothing different to the recipe, it was perfect as is.

I used swiss cheese and left over Easter ham because that's what I had. It tasted great with swiss cheese, I haven't tried it with mozzerella yet. I don't think I will though because my picky eaters loved it the way it was! They said I can make it any time!!

I have made this several times. I freeze the cheese sticks first. It prevents it from melting out of the chicken during cooking.

Replaced breadcrumbs with Panko seasoned with Cajun and Italian seasoning. Used Swiss deli slices instead of mozzarella. After 40 minutes cooking, added 1/2 slice Swiss on top and broiled until Swiss began to bubble. Very moist and tasty.

This is a  Wonderful dish!
I used Panko and ground up garlic croutons instead of breadcrumbs so it took the coating up a level.
I am not a fan of swiss so the cheese sticks were a brilliant
idea!!! I think they even made it easier to roll  the  cordon bleu and skewer them.
Thank you for sharing this!!! I will make this again and again!

It was very good.  Cooked it on the stove to brown and then baked it in the oven for about 20 minutes. Made it for New Years Eve.

I always have to make some kind of change (it's a compulsion). I used 2 flattened breasts topped with 1/4 of a thinly-sliced (~1/8" thick) ham steak and 2 slices Sargento Ultra-Thin Swiss for each. Poultry twine was substituted for toothpicks, and breadcrumbs from homemade Italian bread topped it all off. 

This was delicious! When I make this again, I'll use larger chicken breasts, since my husband wanted to know if there was more

This is a great easy recipe.  I recommend using whatever kind of cheese you want to make it your own, and the kind of ham you prefer.  The recipe was easy to follow and a complete hit. Timing even worked perfectly.

Delicious!!! I soaked the chicken in brine for 20 minutes prior to rolling it with the ham and cheese. We were out of bread crumbs  but had oat bran (I have no idea why we had oat bran, but it seemed like a good idea. Healthier anyway, right?). So, I mixed 1 cup of oat bran with 2 Tablespoons of Italian seasoning and used it as a substitute. I might actually do that from now on when a recipe calls for bread crumbs!

I used Swiss cheese as I know that string cheese is tough and doesn't melt well.  I also sautéed the Panko coated chicken/ham/cheese rolls without using an egg wash.  The pounded chicken is sticky enough to cause the bread crumbs (Panko) to stick.  After lightly browning in 3 Tbsp of oil, I placed the rolls in an oven proof dish, added the sauce and baked for 30 minutes at 350F.  Delicious and tender. Great Recipe.

Very good recipe...I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover ham and I decided on this recipe.  My husband does not like sauce so this particular recipe worked out great for us.

I followed some suggestions of others and tried some rolled and some with pockets. Both worked and were a little messy. make sure you have large enough chicken breasts. Mine were on the smaller size which made fitting everything difficult. I also made the sauce from another recipe as suggested by some others who complained about it being dry. I didn't find it to be dry at all but did enjoy the sauce. However, I didn't feel like it added that much so I probably won't make it again. Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe. I've always loved chicken cordon bleu and was really happy wth this easy take on it!

This was pretty simple and tasty.  The only drawbacks were that it took an hour in the oven to get done, and the cheese didn't melt.  If I make it again, I will use shredded cheese instead.

It was great. Very versatile. You could do different cheeses, and more meats too. Imagine this with swiss and pastrami instead of ham. MMmmm. =)

My husband loves this! It's easy and makes ordinary chicken a little more exciting. I don't bother pounding the chicken I just slice mine in half width-wise. (I'm not a chef and  don't really enjoy cooking as much as I love eating). We love eating the melty cheese that oozes out of the chicken, be sure to line your pan with tin foil.- To that point- you can half the cheese sticks,  that way, there isn't so much oozing out of the ends. Also, since it is kind of messy to make, I usually make up two batches and freeze one.  Frozen chicken cooks up quick and easy on a busy weeknight. :)

Love this recipe! I didn't have Swiss cheese on hand so I used what I had Cooper cheese! Turned out finger licking good! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I did make a sauce to pour over once the chicken was done. I mixed cornstarch and heavy whipping cream with little black pepper, onion powder and 2 slices of Cooper cheese over low heat for 2 mins

Great recipe!  I used Cajun seasoning on chicken breast before rolling with ham & havarti cheese.  I also added a few dashes of Hungarian paprika & cayenne pepper to bread crumbs. Huge hit at party with the extra kick in the seasoning.  Served with Hollandaise sauce to many rave reviews!

This was incredibly easy. I didn't have ham, so I used turkey. I also didn't have cheese sticks, so I used cheddar cheese. Instead of chicken breast I used tenders and cut everything else in half to fit. Worked out great and tasted wonderful! Everyone loved it! It will be another go to recipe.

I love how EASY this recipe is, and yet it yields a very nice "change of pace" chicken dinner that is special. I added a little grated parmesan cheese to my breadcrumbs, and used some provolone cheese slices instead of mozzarella since I had some to use up and we definitely enjoyed this meal! Served with a Caesar Salad and some garlic texas toast. Yumm!

This was quick, easy and was a hit for dinner.
I did not have bread crumbs on hand so I opened a pack of Onion soup mix and dipped the chicken in the butter and pressed just one side of the chicken  into the mix.  (The mix is strong out of the package and I felt one side coated was enough.) I sprinkled what was left of the mix between the breast  chicken and poured the rest of the butter into the bottom of the pan,  Perfect sauce on the bottom(butter and onion soup mix) and still crispy on the top,

meh... it wasn't the greatest. My boyfriend hated it, and he loves everything. It's better with honey mustard drizzle. Won't be making this again though.

My husband loved this and he's pretty picky!  He was even impressed that I wrapped it myself, which was so easy as described in this recipe.  He's not a big swiss cheese fan, though, so I used sharp cheddar instead.  Since I'm a little lazy, I just mixed the bread crumbs in with butter that was just soft, not melted, and that seemed to make it stick better to the tops of the chicken pieces.  Thanks! :)

One word: wow. I can't believe such an amazing dish can be prepared with such basic ingredients and preparation. The only complaint I have is that the cheese leaked out of the sides of each chicken breast. I fully expected it, but if you can keep the cheese inside the chicken I think it would be even more amazing.

This was surprisingly good for how simple it was.  I used plain panko crumbs and added some italian seasoning.  I also pulled the cheese strings apart a bit and they melted up great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for interesting new things to do with my existing recipe when I found this one. I would honestly have never thought to use string cheese. Thank you so much for sharing this, it makes the wrapping process so much easier and the cheese stays inside instead of melting out into the pan. Great addition! Thanks!

This recipe was very good! I did make a slight change though.  I pounded out the chicken and rolled it with the ham and swiss the night before my dinner (since it was for Valentine's Day).  Then right before I was going to bake it I rolled it in melted butter then covered it in plain bread crumbs.  I did put a little salt in the bread crumbs too.  It was a HUGE hit! I boyfriend asked if I could make this again...for the next day! Thanks!

This recipe is alright.  My husband loves cordon bleu but I had never made it before.  I never had to pound a chicken breast before so it got messy.  And the toothpicks were a mess to remove. So above all a 3 :(

It was very easy; however, the cheese melted out of the chicken.  It was still tasty.  I think it needed a bit more spice.  I'll add some Italian seasoning next time.

Messy, but easy to make. I used mozzarella instead (that's what I had in the fridge) and it still tasted quite good. Will use more cheese next time and probably pound the chicken more (it tasted quite 'thick' too me, although my boyfriend thought it tasted great).
