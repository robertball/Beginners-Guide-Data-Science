This is a really great recipe.  It was a big hit for a summer party that I had.  The guest could not get enough of these tacos!

These were a great hit with my grandkids! You combined 2 of their favorites: Fresh fruit & tacos. Very easy & fast to prepare which is a big plus for this busy Grandma.  THANK YOU!! Nancy Schmidt

This reminds me of my youth. My mom used to try all kinds of things in the kitchen and this totally reminds me of our our afternoon snacks - try them out! Such fun!
