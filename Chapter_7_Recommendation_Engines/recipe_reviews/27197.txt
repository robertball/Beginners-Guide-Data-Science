As an experienced baker, I should have known that stated cooking times are only guides! So many variables...your oven's temperature, size and thickness of cookies, etc. Baking my "bones" for 20 minutes was far too long, even though I used a 4" cookie cutter. I would recommend starting out with a baking time several minutes less than recipe states. You can always add time, but you can't undo it! Other than my own error, these were wonderful little treats. Quick and easy to mix together and roll out. I thought puppy might appreciate a little sweetness so I, too, added a bit of honey. If I can find a recipe, next time I make these I would like to try a yogurt frosting for these similar to what they use at retail stores like the Stylish Paw!

I made these this morning as gifts to go with one of my dogs who is being sent to Ontario to be bred. These dog cookies are so easy! I have an expensive healthy dog cookie book where most recipes require a long list of real ingrediants including powdered milk or corn meal.  The latter ingredients I rarely use, so I have to plan making dog cookies instead of being spontaneous. I had all 4 ingrdients in this recipe - and they are healthy!  I have Toy Manchester Terriers and as another member suggested I just rolled the dough into teeny tiny balls and pressed them with a fork as I would a peanut butter cookie.  I ended up throwing out almost half the dough because after rolling more than 150 little balls I was tired!!! So next time I will half the recipe. I baked the wee little cookies for about 7-10 minutes just until they were golden brown on the bottom. They were too cute! They look just like mini peanut butter cookies! As mentioned most of these cookies were used as doggie gift packages. I use a small brown paper bag and fold it closed near the top.  I staple it once, then make a hole with a hole punch and make a nice bow with twine.  I either use color markers to write on the bag or add a tag with the twine!   Thank you Tami for an amazing and much appreciated dog cookie recipe!!

I made these biscuits the other night for my three dogs - a collie, a black lab mix, and a shih tzu. The first batch I rolled out too thin and baked for too long so they turned out to be a little darker than what I had planned. The dogs didn't mind, they ate them anyway. I didn't have any skim milk on hand and I also didn't have any whole wheat flour so I used all-purpose flour and substituted apple sauce for the milk. I also added a tablespoon of honey for a little splash of sweetness. The dough tasted great and Dana, Midnight, and Annie love the treats!

I used the ingredients on hand and somehow spruced up this recipe quite a bit. I used whole wheat pancake mix since it already had the baking powder in it, and substituted about 1/2 of the milk with banana baby food; I thought that would be a great combo with the peanut butter. The dog loved the treats, and I thought the dough tasted pretty good myself!

I make these for my Aussie pup and always keep them on hand for training purposes.  I roll out the dough, put it on a greased cookie sheet, then roll a pizza cutter thru them and make them rather small- about 1 inch squares, then bake until crispy. This is a quick and easy way to make lots of treats. She loves them!! I use them at obedience class and all the dogs just love them.  They will do anything for these treats. Great recipe, healthy, and much cheaper than store bought treats.  If you're concerned about the ingredients in store bought treats- these are perfect.

My dog loves peanut butter so this was the perfect treat! I ran out of this treat yesterday so I give him a milkbone treat instead and he spit it out and just looked at me. I guess he likes the homemade ones better! :-) Thank you for the recipe.

Made these and found that you have to make sure the dough is very thin before cutting and cooking and also flip half way through or these come out crunchy ont the bottom and soft and squishy on the top. Also if you leave them too long with out flipping the bottom can burn. Like the fact that this was a very easy recipe and doesn't take a lot of work. Will make again.

I made these for our Golden Retriever for Christmas.  I didn't use a cookie cutter, just rolled them in balls and pressed a fork across the top (mostly so I could distinguish the her cookies from the 'human' cookies).  Very easy, very happy dog!

I made these for my 5 pound Maltese and her friends!!! They loved them!! I used the large bone shapped cookie cutters for the larger critters and cut "bite size" kibble for my wee little fur ball since her jaw is the size of my index finger (really *smile*). SEE MY PHOTO!!! I doubled the recipe and it made a massive mount. Next time, I will roll the dough thinner since these biscuits rose higher than expected.

I have been searching the site for a good recipe for dog treats. After reading a bunch of the reviews for this recipe, I looked up foods dogs should not have, and according to WebMD, both baking powder and baking soda are toxic, and dogs should not have milk either. I'm not sure if people are making these recipes up without consulting veterinarians, but be careful. I didn't want to take the chance.

GREAT!  
1 )Ok, so I made the recipe exactly as stated and they came out perfectly.  I tried them and they were very bland and floury, oh but my two dogs; Buster & Milo thought they were the best thing ever made.  They went crazy while I was making them and I couldnt believe that they wanted these more than the soft bacon/jerky treats I had.  

2) I made the 2nd batch using apple sauce instead of the milk as reviewers suggested. My dogs had no preference in the finished product and they were much more prone to burn.  I ruined a few of the cookie sheets trying to work out flipping them and things I did not have to do with the first batch.  I noticed also that reviewers who mentioned them burning also changed the recipe.  Perhaps the sugar in the applesauce made them burn? Anyhow I recomend the original recipe.  

3)I also tried another dog biscuit recipe from this site that seemed to have easy and normal ingredients but the dough was much harder to work with.  

THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!

These are such a hit with the dogs.  You can only re roll scraps so many times, so I moosh leftover scraps into a mini muffin pan and bake the same way.  You will have "pupcakes" for a change of pace.

My dogs were mad at me and didn't understand that these had to be cooled before they got one.  Once my dogs got a taste they wouldn't stop begging.  Beware dogs love these and will do anything for them.  I didn't time them when cooking... just waited til' they were golden brown.  I shaped them all Christmas theme and now a bunch are in a tin for my boyfriends family dogs!  Santa gets milk and cookies... what about the doggies? =)

I made a small change to the recipe by adding 1/4 cup of applesauce and cutting down the milk a bit, as well as adding a table spoon of ground flax seed.  It was easy and fun to cut out the little bones, but the cooking time was off for me.  I flipped them after ten minutes on my first batch, and then cooked them for the other ten, but they were all burnt.  The next ones I cooked them for 7 minutes on one side and about 7-8 on the other and they turned out much nicer.  Aside from being careful they don't burn, but are nice and cruncy, my dogs loved them!  I will try the ones adding banana, and also using blueberry puree in some next, for some new flavors.  I would also like to try some using gluten free flour for our more sensitive dogs....overall would make these again.

The dough was very easy to work with. I've been baking homemade dog treats for years now, and this is in my top 10 easiest recipes. I tested these out on my mom's dogs (picky eaters) and they gobbled them up. I melted carob (chocolate substitute safe for pups) and dipped the cookies for a beautiful presentation (and all my dogs go bonkers for it).

I have 3 dogs, one of whom is allergic to beef, and one of whom is allergic to chicken and has skin senstivity, so corn is BAD....  I have searched high and low for the perfect treat, and this one is approved by my hubby and all three of the girls:)  I DID make some changes, for their health and to make them easier for my purpose (training cookies)... 1) made 1/2 batch...  needed little cookies, so 1/2 made 500 little cookies.  2)used all-purpose flour (all I had), upped to 1 cup peanut butter, changed milk to water, added a squirt of honey, 1/4 cup oatmeal, and 1/2 cup parsley, and then... 3) kneaded it a little with my hands, grabbed a nice handful, rolled it into a big ball, then into a "snake" (long, thin cylindrical shape), then pinched off little bits, rolled them into little tiny balls (about 1/2 to 1 inch), then criss-cross forked them like little peanut butter cookies.  On a pizza pan, it was 100 little bitty peanut butter cookies per batch...hee.
Long story short, the girls figured out Mommy was making cookies for them, and they didn't leave my side the WHOLE time I was making these, and they LOOVVVVEEE them:)  Thank you SOOO much for this recipe!  You have made all of us SO happy:)

BEWARE!  If your dog has any sensitivities to food this is not the recipe for them.  My lab had a horrible allergic reaction to this recipe.  Turns out, as some raters have already suggested - milk is not good for dogs.  If you use this recipe don't use the milk!! I was also told to remove the baking powder as an extra precaution.

Just finished making these. I used crunchy peanut butter and used half a cup milk, half a cup of applesauce. These small great and are going fast. I have a big dog so I made larger cookies, about 3 inches long, and it made about 25 cookies so I would not half the recipe. I also added a touch of honey for sweetness and baked them about 12 - 15 minutes. They came out great and I will definitely make them again. They were very easy!

Oh my gosh!  Sheltie-approved!  I can see why other reviewers said they use these treats for training their dogs!  I gave one to both of my dogs and they loved them.  When I opened the pantry where I had put the bag of treats, both dogs instantly sat, staring at me, waiting for more! The dough was easy to work with.  I cut the dough into 1-inch rounds and baked in three batches.  When the last batch was done, I put all the baked treats onto the cookie sheet, turned off the oven, and put the treats back into the oven until the oven had completely cooled.  Dried out the treats a little bit and made them crunchy.  I vacuum-sealed a few small bags of the treats to give to doggie friends for Christmas.  Next time I'll just cut the dough into small squares to make them faster.  I will be making these again, thank you!

My babies love these!  I make them often and I add molasses.  Both dogs seem to like them better if I let them cool in the oven to get crunchy.  These are by far the best dog biscuits.

Just made these for my four dogs. Very easy to make! I cooked mine for only about 14 minutes, and they came out very nicely. Thanks for the quick recipe!

I made these for X-mas for all my furry friends. I made a double recipe. But, I used honey roast crunchy peanut butter(its what I had avail) and added a little extra, used 2% milk, and all purpose flour and added a little salt because the batter was really bland. However, my dogs LOVE them! I'm going to start using this recipe instead of buying treat bones from the store. Next time I think I will try it with whole wheat flour, I'm thinking it may add more flavor...

EDIT: I changed this recipe from 4* to 5* because now I HAVE to use this recipe instead of store bought bones. My dogs now refuse the other kind. :)

This is perhaps the easiest dog treat recipe Ive tried. I did follow another reviewers suggestion and turned the oven off, leaving the treats inside the oven while it cooled and for about 3 hours additional. Sent them up to a friend in PA and she said her dogs love them! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a traditional bake sale today at work . . . some people were surprised, but the "Doggie Cookies" were a big hit!  I made the recipe as written, but added 2 tablespoons of honey for some sweetness.  I packaged the cookie/bones in cellophane bags with dog footprint stickers and ribbon ties.  Ingredients were listed on a sticker on the back . . . just in case!  My two doggies, Ronan and Dugan loved them!

These keep well. I have been testing to see how long they will last (I am planning on giving them to doggie friends during the holidays), and so far they are still good at three weeks - crunchy, no signs of mold, and the dog is still eating these. I did leave them in the oven a little longer than stated in the recipe. My dog is a chewer, and I thought she might like the resistence of a harder cookie.

This is the perfect dog bone recipe. It is easy to make, the dough is a dream to roll and cut, and my dogs howled for them from the time they were baking until they cooled and could be sampled.  It helps to heat the milk and peanut butter together in the microwave, so they can be more easily incorporated before adding the dry ingredients.

Little changes, but happy pooches! Wheat gluten isn't that great for dogs, neither is dairy, but loved the idea of quick easy cheap treats! I just subbed brown rice flour and veg broth for the flour and milk. I also added some honey.  I rolled the dough out on parchment and ran thru it with a pizza cutter. Clean up is easier and my old lady doesn't care what shape her treats are!!! These are SO much easier on her GI system and my wallet!!!

My dogs loved these! I spent way too long the other day making a different, messy, complicated recipe and the dogs didn't even like them! These were so simple and the dough was really easy to work with. Next time I'll be making a double batch!

I also added a carob frosting to these and the dogs went nuts for them. I used: 12 oz softened cream cheese (you could use low fat, but that's not an issue with my dogs), 1 tablespoon honey, and 2-3 tablespoons carob powder. Mix it up, put it in a ziplock or decorator bag and ice the cookies. They will need to be refrigerated though! I put each layer (in a large tupperware) in the freezer for a few minutes to firm up the frosting then just stacked the next layer on top.

I've looked at several recipes for dog bones/cookies. This one was easy and healthy.  Per comment suggestion, I used water instead of milk (as many dogs can be allergic to milk). Also, per suggestions, I added 1 tbsp of honey and 1/2 cup of parsley (for breath), which I think was a bit too much. Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of parsley. As for the flour, we used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour.  We used cookie cutters and cut them to thickness of a sugar cookie. My dog absolutely loves these cookies.  We shared with other dogs, who loved them as well. Excellent:-)

Our Amstaff LOVED these.  He kept sniffing around for more.  My kids helped shape the dough free-hand and, even though thicker and not crunchy, it was still a hit.  I used 2 percent milk and regular peanut butter.  Everything else was followed.

These treats are fantastic!  I made them for my friend's dog, but I had to try some as I was making them, and they are delicious.  Now mind you, I followed someone else's advice and used applesauce instead of milk, so that may make a difference in flavor.  It would be a great treat for a dog's birthday party so all of the attendees can enjoy the same food.  I might make these just for myself sometime, who needs a dog?

My dog is allergic to dairy, so I substituted 2 ripe bananas and some apple sauce for liquid.  He just loves them!  I use natural smooth peanut butter, which I find easier to mix because it's quite runny at room temperature.  My cooking time was 12 minutes @ 375, but them I turn off the oven and leave them to harden for about an hour.  It's such a great, simple recipe and makes 100 cookies for my small dog.

It might be because I'm at high altitude, but the batter was dry, and the bones ended up getting cracked in the oven.  It needed more peanut butter and milk for a little moisture.

Also, the temperature of the oven was way off.  Now that I'm reading the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one with this problem.  The bottoms turned brown after about 12 minutes but before the insides and tops were done.  I had to lower the temperature and flip the bones so they could finish without burning.  The oven almost needs to be set at about 300 or 325 degrees and just let them bake a lot longer.

I have made these many times now for my friends dogs and they are the easiest and most popular recipe I've tried.  I add in some honey for sweetness and the pups seem to like that more.  I also roll my dough out on waxed paper to fit my cookie sheet, then I flip it on to the cookie sheet and cut it into pieces with a pizza cutter.  Works great and super fast.  :)

All three of my dogs loved these.  Like others, I added a little bit of honey.  I also think that I will roll them a little bit thinner next time so they are more crunchy.  Thanks Tami!

This recipe is great. Even my picky beagle loved them.  I was able to get natural peanut butter from the local grocery store by a major manufacturer and at a reasonable cost.  The cookies smell amazing!  I added 1 tbsp of honey to mine just to sweeten them up a bit.

I don't change a thing in this recipe other than the baking time, mine bakes in 10-12 minutes. Don't worry if they come out soft they harden as soon as they cool and keep well in airtight containers or zip locks for weeks- if they last of course- My dog owner friends and family always ask for these because the dogs love them and they are much healthier than the versions sold.

I made these cookies for my cousin's dog Vida.  When the box arrived in the mail, Vida went right over and started licking the box.  Instead of milk, I used a mashed apple that I cooked in the microwave and water.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped fresh cilantro.  After the initial baking time of 20 min at 375, I let them go an additional ~ 30 min at 250 to dry out more.

I made this recipe for our community Pet Health Fair.  I had several people come tell me that their dogs don't usually eat store-bought biscuits, but they really liked these. The recipe is so easy and seemed fool-proof.  I made about 5 batches and all turned out just great!

I made these up using cat and bone cookie cutters and gave as gifts to all of my family members that have dogs.  The cute shapes were a hit!  Plus, it was nice to have a simple recipe that would go over well for dogs with allergies and sensitive stomachs.  I plan to do this for the holidays every year.

I feel so bad rating this recipe so low but made them this morning and coud'nt wait to feed one to my little Otis.... now this is a dog who will eat anything.... apple core, raw carrots any scraps he can scrounge but he would not go near them.  I warmed some peanut butter with water and brushed the biscuits to see if that would tempt him.  No way!  I dont know if he is so used to store bought snacks with a strong odor or what.   I tried one and it was a bit bland for an adult taste but was certainly not horrible and you def got the flavor of peanut butter.  I will repost if he changes his mind but as of now does anyone want about 50 biscuits?  LOL

I just pulled these out of the oven, and OH MY GOD!!

These were SO easy to make. The only challenge was to mix together the PB and milk. But the dough wasn't sticky AT ALL. I didn't even need to transfer to a floured surface.

I had to cut it down to '14' servings, though, because I was low on flour, and all the measurements still turned out perfect.

These baked up in about 17 minutes in my old-as-time oven. They look pretty crunchy, but they're really quite crumbly and soft. This is perfect for small dogs, like my Shih tzu, who can't just gobble down a whole bone.

These are by far the easiest dog bones I've ever made. (I used to have a small business selling dog bones.) The dough is easy to shape (I made fun shapes after using cookies cutters, like mini-gyoza, fortune cookies, and even a big hamburger) and to roll.

They also cool off really quickly, and that's awesome because, if you're a shih tzu owner, you know how impatient they can be! :) My little pup was literally scratching at my legs as I took them out of the oven. She gobbled three right down in a row.

Long review short- THESE ARE PERFECT.

I loved this great simple dog treat recipe!!!  I used the idea that someone else did.....Where you roll into small balls and use a fork to make the print on top of cookie.   It,s  VERY quick and simple.  My dogs loved it ...EVEN  my picky dog:)   I'm going to make these for doggy gifts:)

This is a great basic recipe that you can make so many modifications to!

I substituted brown rice flour for the wheat flour based on some other suggestions.  

I also substituted plain yogurt instead of milk.  I might have to add a tiny bit more yogurt next time as it was just a little dry.  But it was still really easy to work with.

I rolled my dough into little balls and then flattened them out.

I cooked it for about 7-10 minutes.  It cooks really fast.

These are so great and easy!  I think next time I'll try it with carrots instead of peanut butter and also try it with cheese (they love their cheese).

Thanks so much for sharing, this is great!  A lot cheaper and healthier too!

My dog LOVED these treats!!!  I added a bit of honey to them and put only 1/2 cup of milk with a small container of banana baby food for the flavour as well.  Make sure you flip them over halfway through or they won't cook through as well.  Also, I used a larger dog-bone cookie cutter and smaller one for training treats for my dog.  Will use this again!

This was really easy to make! But I have to agree with others when they say its bland. My dog doesn't usually like dog biscuits but he LOVES peanut butter, so I thought I would give it a try. He ate it slow but liked it. Dog rating i would say 3 stars. I did not use milk because its bad for dogs. Instead I used 1/2 cup water 1/2 beef broth. Next time I'm going to use just beef broth. I also put in 1 table spoon of molasses. I used Adams Chunky natural peanut butter. Gave it a little extra texture.

I had to kick my dogs out of the kitchen while these were baking because they kept standing in front of the oven!  I agree with previous reviewers about making cookies thin and putting them back in the oven to dry out. Really helps lengthen shelf life.

This is so easy and simple to make! Thanks for sharing! I altered it a little though. I didn't have Whole Wheat Flour, so i grinded oats till a powdery consistency then added it to all purpose flour. It turned out to be crunchy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. My dog still loved it!

The dog I baked these for liked them, don't get me wrong. =)  I'm docking the recipe because the dough was hard to work with (gritty, crumbly and sticky), and it was hard to know when the cookies were done.  Take that with a grain of salt, because these were the first dog biscuits I've ever made.  When tapped, they seemed totally dry, but they still had moisture in the middle, so when I packed them up for gifting, they became a bit soft and didn't crunch when the dog chewed them.  Overall, the dog was satisfied, but I didn't feel like this was a successful recipe.  I might try them again only if I felt like I **needed** to make dog biscuits, but didn't want to go to the grocery store first.

This recipe is great!  Very, very easy to make, and Duke (our Boxer) LOVES them!  I couldn't keep him out of the kitchen while I was making them!  :)  I used medium-sized dog bone cookie cutters, and made a few with a big bone cutter.  I doubled the batch, and it made five big cookies, and 68 little bones.  Great X-mas gifts!!!  Next time I will probably try them with Low Sodium broth, instead of the milk.  They also freeze great!

My dog hates Milkbones. At Petsmart when they first asked if they could offer her a bone, I told them they could, but I doubt she would take it since she hates them. Well, she did take it, I laughed and said she was making a liar out of me. But then she put it down, and peed on it. She really hates most dog biscuits, but she loves these. Thank you!! I didn't think I'd ever find a biscuit type of treat that she likes.

I made minor adjustments to the recipe and my dogs loved them! I used a little fresh garlic and chicken broth, 1/3 c. milk and 2/3 c. water, and that is all I changed.  My dogs liked them more than their usual store bought brand bones!  Will make again and probably tweak the recipe more.  This really is a base recipe so you can add anything your dog likes!

I have to add another review.  After making this at least 10 times, the dogs go wild.  It ALWAYS is great, even if I have to substitute ingredients.  My dogs have allergies so they really enjoy a treat that is yummy AND healthy!

I made these as Christmas treats for my Bichon and all his puppy friends.  I added a little honey and oatmeal to the recipe and the dogs couldn't get enough!!  I continue to make these as 'reward' treats all year.

This was a wonderful recipe! Not only did my dog (a jack russel) love it, but my neighbor & friends dogs and my son's dogs. The recipe was easy to follow - although I did need to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour due to living in a high altitude area.

Update: I've made this recipe with a few modifications just to change it up a bit and my dog loves them. I've added some beef broth in place of part of the milk, shredded carrots and cheddar. 

Previous Review: You can't go wrong with these. I figured this recipe was so simple & easy I had to try it. They hardly took any time at all.

Thank's Tami! this is a nice all natural treat! :)

The kids enjoyed them as much as the dogs.

Great rolled a little thicker and spread with jam.

Basically a peanut flavoured baking powder biscuit. Yummy.

I've baked these three times.  The first time I used a larger cookie cutter and baked them far too long.  I purchased a 1 1/2" X 1 1/2" cookie cutter, added 1/4 cup honey but reduced the  peanut butter to 3/4 cup.  The natural peanut butter had enough oil, so I didn't grease the cookie sheets.  I also reduced the temperature to 350 and cooked them for 13 minutes.  No longer. The last two times I baked these, they came out perfectly!  One recipe makes about 150 cookies when using the smaller cookie cutter.  I pet sit and give them out to all my "friends" and they all love them!

These were soooo easy to make!  So easy, in fact, that I made 1200 small heart shaped ones for an event I sold them at.  I made as directed, but I had some carrot juice in the fridge so on some of them I used 3/4c milk and 1/4c carrot juice to change it up.  My dog loves them, and my house smells like peanut butter.  A real winner!

I have made this recipe for my Chocolate lab puppy named Bella for the last couple of months. She loves them so much that she knows when I am making them by the smell in the kitchen and stays right at my feet hoping I will drop some of the dough. I have read all the reviews and have used several of the suggestions. In my version I use brown rice flour instead of wheat and applesauce instead of oil. My friends are always asking me for the recipe and say that my puppy is so spoiled.

I used half the recipe & added 1/4 cup dried wild blueberries. It is a wonder treat for my four legged babies to show how much they are loved. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box.

Thanks for the great cookie recipe! I too put a little honey on top and then sprinkled with just a little brown sugar. I used 3 different "butters"- almond, peanut and sunflower. I also added garlic! Strange, maybe, but I like to sneak garlic to my dogs every chance I get. It's so good for them. My canine version of Mikey ate them immediately (he'll eat anything), but they passed the taste test when my picky princess asked for more! These are now a staple in the treat jar.

I am rating these 5 stars even though I did not taste them, but based on the reaction of the dog, they were fantastic!    My son made a batch he is going to take to the local animal shelter for the homeless pups.   Thanks again!

I made these for my dog’s 4th birthday and he loved them.  I replaced the milk with chicken broth since dairy is not good for dogs (they can have difficulty digesting lactose).  Next time, I will shred a cooked chicken breast and some carrots and add those to the mixture for added tastiness.

Based on my doggies opinion these get five stars, I gave him half of one to try them out, then grabbed the other half.  He started doing tricks without even being asked.  He got up on his hind legs and put his paws out.  Needless to say he loved them.

I didn't like this recipe at all. 20 minutes is WAY too long. I ended up putting my second pan in for 10 minutes and that was much better. Also, the dough needed A LOT more flour when I was rolling it out. When I fed it to my two dogs, they spit it out but eventually ate them. Definitely looking for a new recipe.

Thank you for such an easy and terrific recipe.  I have 3 labs and 4 Jack Russells and they are a finicky, demanding crowd who loves their dog treats.  When I make these, they are all sitting at the oven door, waiting for them to come out of the oven.  I love how easy it the recipe is and the natural ingredients.  I have made this recicpe in my kitchenaid stand mixer as well as my food processor and it comes out great every time.  If I am pressed for time, I roll the dough into balls.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Very simple recipe. This is my first attempt at making dog cookies. I thought the batter was very hard to work with, very dry and flaky. But I think it was something I did wrong and not the recipe.  I couldn't find unsalted NP at walmart so I just used Smuckers NP in creamy. They ended up turning out good. My 3 month old German Shepherd loves them. I cut some into big shapes with cookie cutters and others real small for training treats (we are in potty training phase!) I would make them again because they are so simple and Havoc loves them!

I use a recipe just like this all the time.  Try this!~ Don't use the skim milk, but instead use some broth (I even water my broth down - hey, they're dogs, they have a great sense of smell, you don't need alot! I also had an Emeril "BAM" of shredded low-fat cheese and the dogs go CRAZY for them! These rock!

I have two dogs, and they love these.  Instead of baking them in bone shapes I just roll them into little balls.  One recipe makes something like 12 dozen treats!  I like that I know exactly what my girls are eating, and the dogs love them as well.

I used a 1 1/4" dog bone cookie cutter I got off of ebay.  My pit bull puppy loves these treats when we are doing obedience training.  They smell soooo good when baking.  Toby goes nuts when he smells them!

I tried a bite, and it didn't taste like much to me, but my rat terrier loves these!  I tried to give her a milkbone today, and she threw it down because she wanted a birthday bone instead! I think she liked her "Christmas bones" after all.

Although I did not try them myself, my 2 dogs ate them right up. I did sub brown rice flour, just because I hd it on hand. They smelled great cooking and as weird as it seems my dogs seemed to be waiting for them to come out of the oven.

Followed the recipe as written except that I used regular creamy peanut butter. Cooked the bones for 20 minutes and they came out perfect.  My dog enjoyed them!

SO super easy and tasty!  I made 2 batches one with carrots and honey.  The other with a bit o' bacon grease and parsley.  The kids helped and the dogs waited and drooled!  Will be making again for sure!

These were super easy! I own a book on homemade dog biscuits but most of the recipes call for bone meal and desiccated liver, needless to say i never have those on hand. So this was a quick alternative. Try substituting low sodium chicken or beef broth instead of the milk, especially for those dogs that are sensitive to dairy.

I halved this recipe because my dog is quite small. I didn't have any bone shaped cookie cutters so I ended up pressing the balls of dough with a fork and making little cookies. My dog loved them. I gave a bag to my mother-in-law and her neighbor and their dogs loved them too. These would be great to put in a little package and give away at Christmas.

So easy, and since I have everything on hand they are great to make in a flash. Smokey enjoyed the raw dough just like I do when I make people cookies!  You could easily mix in a little more pb for a softer cookie or incorporate any sort of protein powder if you need to.

These are great. I subbed water for milk after reading that dogs are lactose intolerant. Also added a little molasses. Next time I'll be adding parsley. Cut thick, thicker than the recipe calls for and bake for 5-7 minutes. At 10 minutes mine were burning.

My Husky LOVES these bones! They are his absolute favorite. He sits under me while I make them and can hardly wait for them to finish baking. I didn't change a thing, the recipe is perfect. Thanks for such a great, healthy treat recipe! I feel so much better knowing exactly what's going into my boy's treats!

I took these as a gift for my brother's dog. She really enjoyed them but I think she would just about eat anything! It was convenient to only pull together 4 ingredients. When I rolled out the dough I found it would not stay together- lots of -cracks. I still managed to cut out about 40 small size dog bone shaped cookies but I threw some of the dough away as it was a pain to work with. Thanks for the recipe though Bailie liked them.

Use the top rack of your oven for these!!  I have a tiny oven and baked them all at once, so I had one sheet on the bottom and one on the top. The ones on the bottom burned a little, other than that it was fun to make with my three year old- and the dogs loved them!

My dogs loved these. They were pacing in the kitchen for them to come out of the oven. Just a note, the drops of dough do not spread on the cookie sheet, so you can put each drop closer than you normally would.
Great Recipe. Thanks.

I made these for a few of my neighbor's dogs and they loved them! I'm using the treats for training and I didn't want them to b really big, so I rolled the dough out to about 1/4" then used a knife to cut them into tiny squares. I baked them for about ten minutes at 350. I don't know if dogs have a sweet tooth or not, but I added about 1/8 C. of sugar to the dough. I also used chunky peanut butter, I;d suggest using creamy next time though. 
They tasted good! lol! Even the cat liked them! (But then again, that cat thinks he's a dog!)
Anyway, great recipe, thanks Tami!

I love that you know exactly what goes into dog treats when you make them yourself, and our Great Pyrenees, Merlin, loved these (as well as the raw dough!)    I'd like to replicate the big Old Mother Hubbard treats we used to be able to get around here.  They were really hard - I could not break them in half by hand - and excellent for helping to keep his teeth clean.  I tried leaving these in the oven (turned off) overnight so they'd get hard, but they're still sort of like "Milk Bone" consistency.  Still, a good treat for Merlin.  I'm going to experiment with less peanut butter, maybe less baking powder, to see if I can get the hard-as-a-rock biscuits I want.

These went over pretty well with my 4 month old puppy.  She didn't beg for more, but she did eat the one that I gave her.  Very easy to make, also.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome, my fur kids just loved them.
I didn't have whole wheat flour so I substituted all purpose flour and added an extra half cup.
Also, brushed the cookies with an egg wash before baking to give them a nice shiny and darkened appearance.

I guess it's not fair for ME to rate them, but I will tell you what my peanut-butter hound thought...he licked and licked them, but wouldn't eat them.  They were easy to make and smell fantastic, but he won't eat it!

Wonderful recipe, happy tails wagging everywhere! I used a bone cookie cutter and a cat cookie cutter, they were too cute. My Doberman Pinschers and Golden Retriever loved them, as well as my friend's Lab! Will definitely be making these again, thanks for sharing =)

Although, I don't personally own a dog, I've made these for years for dogs in the family and dogs of my friends. I originally got the recipe from a TV show in the 1990s. They are very cute and much appreciated by dogs. You can write their names on it with a little white chocolate. (don't use regular chocolate, it's poisonous to dogs) SO CUTE!

These were wonderful and easy to make. Here were my adjustments: intead of milk I used one cup of boiling water with a beef bullion cube dissolved. I added 1TBL of honey for sweetness...I also added a little bit of garlic powder. I found that it made way more than 18 cookies. I don't have animals so I tried them on my neighbors dog......she ate them up. These will be packaged up for my "niece" Sasha----cutest little pug you've ever seen.

Simple, quick and best of all, my puppers loved them!  I think I will finally be able to master some tricks that I have been unsuccessful at training her on with these babies.  I too added about a tablespoon of honey and will plan to roll them out thinner next time (my fault...).  I want to get some cookie cutters especially for this recipe and make a batch for my brother's dogs for Christmas!  Thanks for the recipe - they were LOVED!!!

I just made these for my two Puppies and they seem to like them but I am a little confused as to what it's suppose to look like when they come out. I used a gingerbreadman cookie cutter and I didn't have a rolling pin so I rolled it as flat as I could with my hands. When you mix all the ingredients is the dough suppose to be very sticky ? I used chunky peanut butter bcuz its what I had in my pantry. I also mixed in some beef and chicken baby food to the mix. It came out more bread like than biscuit/cookie texture.

We made these at my daughter's 5th birthday party (she asked from donations for the Humane Society instead of gifts so it fit!).  They were GREAT!  The kids loved helping mix them & cutting out the shapes.  Each kid took one home to their dog & the rest went to the shelter.  Big paws up from all dogs involved!

I made these 'bones' last night and my Chow was the taste tester. He gives it a big PAWS UP!. I made these treats as Christmas gifts for the canine cuties in my life. I used a candy cane shaped cookie cutter. I even made kitty sized treats so as not to leave out the feline. Thanks for the recipe!!

I used natural almond butter because I didn't have natural  peanut butter. The dogs loved them. They are crunchy bones not soft. Good for cleaning teeth

Was very easy & my dogs love them.  I made cookie & little treat size.  I pay about $7 for a 10 oz bag of organic peanut butter treats.  Making these treats is a rediculous savings!  Thank you!

Made these for my 3 dogs and they LOVED them and pawed for more! I tweaked the recipe a little bit. Instead of the 1 cup of skim milk, I used 1/2 cup of almond milk and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. And I also shredded cheese into it. Followed all the directions and they came out awesome! :)

This is probably the easiest recipe I've ever seen. I've been using it for years, my dog and even my family love it. It's human-friendly! Everytime I make these my dog would sit right next to the kitechen and watch at my movements from start to finish.

Very easy to make and my dogs love them. I usually double the batch sometimes I roll them into little balls to make a huge batch. Lately, I've been giving some away as gifts to my friend's dogs. One of my dogs actually scratches at the fridge to get at the cookies!

Wow, these are very easy to make and my dogs LOVED them! You can just put a light coat of flour on the surface that you are working on, coat your hands, then press out the dough, and cut out your shapes. Very easy and quick to make.  I cut these out in heart shapes, then baked for 12 minutes, flipped them over and baked another 6 minutes so both sides are browned and the cookies are crisp. Thanks for a great, easy dog treat recipe!

My toy poodle loved them! I added in honey and a little bit of cinnamon and she went nuts! I did flip them 1/2 way through. They aren't quite crunchy, but not super soft either. I also used 3/4 creamy and 1/4 crunchy peanut butter. This does make a LOT though! I will freeze half of them and keep 1/2 out for treats. I used an olive oil lid(about 1" in diameter) to cut them, and they didn't spread out, just poofed up a little bit. 3 or 4 minutes in I flipped them, gave them another 3 or 4 minutes and done.

So simple, and the puppies went berserk over them!  I ordered a dog bone cookie cutter online and was surprised that was only an inch long, and I made a double batch of the dough.  In the end, I literally had hundreds of little dog biscuits, which were a smashing hit for our last house party and fun party favors for our canine guests!  Its nice that they are edible for people too, if a little tasteless, for those guests who don't read the sign that says "Dog Treats"...  I should note however, that small dog biscuits need MUCH less cooking time!  I think I baked mine for only 10-12 minutes.

I used reg.unbleached flour as I had no wheat flour.
Also used organic beef broth instead of milk and added about a T.of Black Strap molasses.Also used reg. peanut butter.I did add flax seed as suggested by another.Baking powder is toxic for dogs but in Large Amounts or fed straight! So I didn't worry when another said she wouldn't use this recipe due to that ingredient.I doubled the recipe since we have 3 dogs.I also took the advice & let them stay in the oven to cool for extra crispness.

I made these for my Picky Pug Princess the other day for her birthday. She will NOT eat any kind of doggy treat bought at the store. She did eat one or two of these but since then, she refuses to eat any more. I ended up giving them away to other doggies that aren't quite as spoiled. I give it a 4 because she DID eat one and the other dogs seemed to like it. **on the other hand, my neighbor seemed to really like them. They must go great with beer**

I have made these many times since my initial baking, and have since then made cat poop shaped cookies and simple round cookies in addition to my cute cutout shapes, all of which I coated in sugar-free carob, a dog safe alternative to chocolate.  The cat poop was so realistic, the pictures got banned from Myspace - but so delicious, say the dogs!  I used a candy mold for the round cookies, to make skulls and spiderwebs on them.  I posted a picture in the photos for this recipe :)

Its hard to tell because my cocker spaniel will eat most anything but he  sure loves these...! and they smelled just like a peanut butter cookie.   Was a bit of a pain rolling out the dough and cutting out the little hydrants and bones but they sure were cute so they were worth it.   My dog didn't notice the work I went thru though. ;)  I made a double batch and gave out little doggie bags to friends with dogs that visited over the holidaysl

Made it for my brother-in-law's lab.  I rolled the dough into little balls and pressed them down with a fork.  They turned out great.

I made these for my pug today and he loved them! I used a small (2 inch) round cookie cutter and then cut that into 4 pieces. Perfect treat size for him. Will definitely make again, I love knowing that he is eating something I made, rather than a store bought treat!

My Freddie loves them. Nice to know what he's eating too.  Make sure you leave the container opened slightly to avoid the cookies going too soft.

My doggies LOVE them!!!! Thank you so much!

UPDATE: So after 3 years my doggies are still eating treats from the recipe! Although I did change it up a bit. Just regular flour/baking powder/regular peanut butter/ and milk. 

I have two pomeranians and they love it, I use little heart shaped cookie cutters to make em and it's just the perfect size for them!

Lower heat about 325 depending on your oven and watch it after 10 min...as soon as it's brown i take them out. I like it nice and thin and not so thick! Will upload the pictures soon!

Very popular with all the puppies in my family! I made these as Christmas goodies for the dogs in my life and they were a hit. Super peanut buttery. Also great because the ingredients are easy to find and usually ones I have on hand!

I have used this recipe as written with great reviews by the "crew".  Also have made it with canned pumpkin instead of the peanut butter, which my boys LOVE!  ***Note*** If using pumpkin, store baked treats in the fridge, or freeze them if making ahead for gifts. They are moist enough to get moldy if stored too long.  The ones I make for my dogs never last that long though!

This is the third year in a row that I've made these and given them as gifts to all my friends' dogs, as well as my own...EXCELLENT recipe. Simple, the results are perfect, and I swear my dog will walk a tightrope to get his teeth on these.  Good dough to work with, too.  I've evolved the recipe a bit, mixing in a few handfuls of oats, for texture, and half milk/half chicken or beef broth.

This is an awesome recipe, My dog Nutmeg loves these treats. I made them for my son's dog Minnie, as a birthday present and now have made them for Hallowe'en.  Cats, bones and Jack-O-lanterns. I used carob chips for the faces. This is such an easy treat to make.

I made these for my Bichon Frise dog. He liked them a lot, but they had mold on them by the end of week two. If you have only one dog, I would suggest cutting the recipe in half. Otherwise, Louis (my dog) found them delicious!

I make these treats for my two shelties and I also roll into little balls and squish with a fork so they look like mini cookies. My dogs LOOOOOOOVVVVVVE these treats and so do all of their doggy neighbors. Again, simple with just a few ingredients and so healthy. I have made them with regular flour when I ran out of wheat and they were gobbled up just as fast.

I add a little beef/chicken broth in with the milk (not changing the total measurement) and my dogs ADORE these!  Best of all, they work great with cookie cutters, making his a fun activity for my children (with the added benefit of getting to treat their beloved dogs).  We double the batch and freeze -- they thaw great and smell tasty.  We all love this fabulous recipe!

These are great!!  I usually make them about the size of a quarter, and one batch will make well over 200 treats.  They do best when stored in a ziploc in the freezer.  My dogs LOVE them, and even my parents' finicky dog eats them.  

Very easy to make - just the right consistency to knead with your hands without sticking.

my dog loved the treats. I also added my own twist to them. I added a table spoon of honey, some shredded apple, and some crumbled up bacon. I am 11 years old and with moms supervison they came out great. we even sampled them ourselves.

The dough was fairly dry.  While my pup loves peanut butter like a little kid loves ice cream, she wasn't too keen on these snacks.  I'm going to look for a recipe that includes more dried fruit and vegetables.

I gave my dog one of these a half hour ago and she's still sniffing the ground to see if there's any crumbs she missed! I decided to use bouillon cubes as well as milk (half milk, half cubes). This was so easy to make and will make excellent presents! I will definitely make them again.

Dog tested-dog approved.
Easy, quick dog treat recipe. I liked that it had a short ingredient list. I used regular peanut butter and didn't knead the dough for long, but the dogs didn't complain! I also don't have dog bone shaped cookie cutters, so I shaped them like shortbread, long rectangles.
 Our Sheltie and poodle mix love them. I will make them again for sure. These would be fun for kids to help make.

My dog loves these, they are great, and soooo easy!  Definitely cooks in less time than the recipe says, though, mine BARELY took ten minutes.  My oven was very preheated from baking pies, though, so that may be a factor....anyway, great recipe!

I can only rate this by how easy to make and how much my dogs seem to love these.  I've played around with this recipe and added carob or oatmeal at different times.  No matter what, my 3 dobies LOVE them!!!  I even bag them up for my friends' dogs who just can't seem to get enough.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Easy recipe. I only had regular peanut butter, so I used that. I added some wheat germ and garlic powder and substituted chicken stock for the milk. My puggle, Mindy, loved a bite of the batter and has not left the kitchen since they went in the oven! I have no doubt she'll love them. We're bringing them to our Obediance Class Graduation tomorrow night.

I have three dogs (Max, Sady, and Pinky). They are all mutts. They loved these treats. If they are in the back yard and I want them to come in all I have to do is yell "homemade cookies!" and they fly to the door. Thanks for the recipe.

The dogs loved it.  I made it for X-mas and passed them out as gifts to people who have dogs and it was awesome.  My 3 year old ate it by accident and he thought they were great too.

My dog loved these. They were simple and quick to make. He stayed in the kitchen watching them cool on the rack--I think he knew they were his. It's nice to know exactly what's in the treats I give my dog. Another plus is they smell so much better than the stinky treats he usually gets. My son came home while they were baking and thought I hade made peanut butter cookies for him.

These are a hit with my Pomeranian! I was suprised too, because she is usually a very picky eater. I only had chunky PB and 2% milk but it worked fine (they're just a little crumbly). I also just made them into balls because I didn't have cookie cutters. I ended up making more than I intended to so they wouldn't be too big for my baby. 

Overall-really great. I'll have to make them for Prissy again.:D

I followed the recipe exactly and my dog ate these up. Good treat and I know exactly what is them. Black Bean, my Chihuahua, thanks you. I will half the recipe next time. This made too many treats for a little dog to eat.

Made these for the 2nd time tonight.  The 1st time I pretty much followed the recipe, except I had to use white flour & beef bouillon (that's what I had on hand).  This time I made the bouillon a little stronger & added a little honey & garlic powder (the dough definitely was not as bland).  The dogs loved them!

Have you ever met a dog that refused a cookie? Me neither. My dogs loved these cookies! And the ingrdients are so simple and usually on hand. Who knows the  that goes into store bought dog treats. I thank you and my doggies thank you.

I don't bake too often, and these were so easy to make!  I used a bone cookie cutter and a another one that was shaped as a cat.  They were so cute!  They smelled wonderful (peanut butter aroma just filled my kitchen) and my dog Pirate loved them!  I used regular peanut butter and used 1% milk instead of skim.  And they still came out great.  I think next time I may use chicken broth in place of the milk.  I will most defintely make these again and again!

I used a smaller shape: shot glass to cut out smaller cookies. You should drop the heat to 350F if you do! Got 110 cookies from the recipe.

just made this for my two girls, Princess Growley and Cookie Dough. 
ones a German rotti, pitbull, mastiff mix (110lbs!) and the other, Cookie is a Bulloxer.

made the recipe exactly as it was stated, some darker spots, def going to make these again though. puppers ate them up!

next time I will bake for a couple mins less and add some honey, as others have tried! 

great recipe, so easy and healthy! my girls are picky butts!

I make these bones regularly for my fur babies and my families fur babies. They are always a hit. I add about 2 tablespoons flax meal and honey to sweeten it up a bit. If I want a softer bone I will take them out after cook time if I want a harder crunchier bone I will add a little more cook time ( 5 min or so) and leave them in the oven after I turn it off.I also store them in a ziplock in the refrigerator after cooled. Great recipe!

Very easy to make.  I doubled the recipe for Christmas gifts and it made 75 (after a few mess ups). Took a bit to get the time down. I actually only baked them for 12 minutes. Not sure if they'll be a hit or not but they look petty!

Made these for some of my neighbor's dogs who greet me when walking their owners. I'm told they devour them one bone at a time. I found no evidence that wheat is bad for all dogs anymore than wheat is bad for all people. Some dogs, like humans, can be allergic to certain foods. The American Kennel Club has a good and balanced evaluation on this subject.

I made the recipe as it was written and my dogs loved them.  It got to the point that every time I went into the kitchen they would wait at the door drooling hoping I was making more.  This is my go to for doggie treats.

Super easy & my dog loves them! I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter & 1/2 cup of sunflower seed butter & oat  flour instead of the whole wheat. I would suggest setting your timer for 10 mins & checking every 5 or so as I made my cookies a bit thinner & used a small glass bottle opening for cutting cookies out. 15 mins was perfect for my cookies.

I made a half batch just to try the recipe. I never make dough so I was a bit concerned this would not be for me. However, this was very easy dough to make and roll out.   1/4" is perfect for baking this recipe. I did not have a cute cookie cutter so I I just cut the dough into strips and then into pieces. I placed them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Another reviewer suggested flipping the bones half way through so they are crisp on both sides. (Not soft on one and crisp on the other)This was a good idea. I flipped at 10 minutes and then baked another 7-8 minutes.   
Recipe turned out great! My dog did like these!

 I would think any flour would work fine. I will look into other flours that are better for dogs and try them in this recipe. Today I used Bob's Red Mill whole grain white all purpose flour.

I am hoping to replace Milkbone dog treats with these as every box I have purchased in the last 6 months has had moths, larva, and/or webbing in the box! I really want to know my dog is not eating that or worse. 

Thanks for the recipe!

My Great Dane Puppy Clifford is loving these.  I had to shorten the cooking time to 15 minutes.  I bet they would still turn out at 12 minutes.  I am in the Pacific Northwest at sea level and cooked them at 375 degrees in an electric oven.

The only change I made was I used 1 cup all purpose along with 1 cup whole wheat. Because my oven is finicky I left it at 350 degrees and they turned out beautiful. I tried different thicknesses & checked before the required time and it was not a problem. None of them burned. The best part is my dogs love them!

I made this recipe gluten free and dairy free. My dog liked it okay but when I put a peanut butter frosting on it he loved it!  All I used in the frosting is a cup of peanut butter, half a cup of milk and a drizzle of honey. Then mix it in an electric mixer until it's well blended and creamy and it's ready to go.

This recipe is super easy! My little lab is going crazy for them now. I used all purpose flour (didn't have wheat) and added 1/2 a banana ( and used slightly less peanut butter). I started with a bake time of 10 minutes, then added 2-3 minutes after checking the bottoms. Thank you!

Really easy to make. A lot of people say dogs can't have milk or flour. Mostly it's okay. Especially in treats because it's such a small amount. Only would be bad if the dog were allergic to these ingredients. My three dogs love them. I had some extra parsley I added to this recipe for fresher breath (not sure if it really works, but I had extra). I give them away to friends dogs too.

Modifications I made. Omit baking powder and milk. All I put in them were 1c all purpose flour, 1c oats, 2 Large over ripe bananas ( thawed from the freezer) and 1c of peanut butter ( mixed what was left of the natural, crunchy and smooth). I rolled them into palm sized balls. The first batch I pressed a fork in for the design but the next 2 dozen I just pressed in my palms. Baked about 12-14 min and they were done. My testers were eager to try them and they LOVED them. I made enough to give little Christmas bags to neighbor's and friend's dog and will include a list of the ingredients so they know what is in them. A great little gift to go along with the human Christmas cookies I'm giving each family. Thank you Tami for such a simple recipe! Next batch, I am adding shredded carrots in there as well.

I just roll out the dough and cut it into rectangles with a pizza wheel.  My dog loves them and has no adverse reaction to the wheat flour.  I did substitute peanut butter powder and water this last time, and they turned out soft and bread-like.  If you have a dog that needs soft treats, that may be the way to go.  I'm going to stick with the crunchy version!

I just made these and my dog loves them...instead of milk I used apple juice and like others I used 2 dollops of honey...it rolled out great. Not sticky and used a Med sized bone cookie cutter. I baked for 7 min took them out and rotated the 2 trays from top to bottom and baked another 6 min..turned out perfect. Hardened as they cooled...made 33 bone cookies!  Kita my German shepheard/akita mix was Happy!

I made these the first time for our little pom, I made them fairly small so I cut the time down to 15 minutes and they were perfect!! But rather than a cookie cutter I also just used a pizza cutter. I do have tiny gingerbread men & girls I may use for him at Christmas though!! He loves them!!

My two fur kids loved these. So easy to make and very quick. I did add some honey. And there is alot of other things to add to this recipe, like the dog chocs from the shop.....chop them up and make choc chip treats for the dogs! Highly recommend and i have told my work friends about this recipe aswell.

Made these for the first time a month ago and my two dogs love them.  Made them just this morning again and used the pizza slicer to cut them, what a great idea.  I did as one reviewer suggested and baked them for less than 20 minutes.  I baked them for 17 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Puppies could smell them baking and eagerly awaited the new batch of them.  This is a great recipe, easy to make and makes you feel good that you are giving your dogs a healthy treat.  Thank you so very much for submitting this recipe.

These biscuits are a hit with my dog. The ingredients are easy and not odd. I think next time I would like to add chopped dried raisins for sweetness, since my dog love sweet things. I listened to another reviewer and placed my 1" x 4" x 1/8" dog cookies in for 12 minutes and added time. I agree: adding time is easier/you can't subtract time in the oven! They came out crunchy at 17 minutes in a regular oven on a dark cookie sheet.

I made these today for my 70lb lab mix.  She loves them!  I ran out of her normal treats and couldn't get to the pet store to buy her more, well I don't think I'll ever buy her treats now that I know how easy they are to make, and with stuff I always have on hand!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe (and thanks from Nellie), I will make these many more times!

I used plain flour as I didn't have any wheat flour, and as one review stated I used unsweetened applesauce. I couldn't wait for them to cool off to see how my dog would like them. They were a huge hit, She kept coming back wanting more. Thank you for a great recipe for my dog.

I give it 5 stars for having few ingredients and being quick and easy. I used canned pumpking in place of the peanut butter, knowing that my sister's dogs like pumpkin. I admit I didn't want to use my expensive stuff for dogs. The pumpking worked nicely, but I had to make drop cookies because the dough was very sticky from the pumpkin. I made small drop cookies and baked them for 15 minutes. They came out great!

These are so easy to make!  I've made them a dozen times now and I won't be buying store bought anymore.  I use a small shot glass to cut them in little circles. I too use water instead of milk.  I've even used regular PB but you need to add a little more flour because it's wetter then the natural.  Last time I doubled the batch and rolled them a little thicker (at least 1/4 in) and that's my favorite way now.  You do need to freeze what you can't use in a week or so, they are fresh cookies and will go bad if not used up quickly.

My picky dogs favorite! I found this recipe somewhere else a few years ago, and was glad to see it one here!!! a must try simple and a helthy treat too, I make these for a friend of the familys dog who is a very very very picky eater who was just diagnosed with diabetes, and wont eat anything! She LOVES them! A lot of dog treat recipes on here use bacon grease dont give your dog bacon grease it can cause lots of stomache problems, some people think its good for their skin, it may help it but its hurting your dog elsewhere, use fish oil capsole for the skin or ask your vet!

Just amde this recipe to sell at a bake sale where I work.  My 2 dogs went nuts---they loved them.  I made the dough into small balls and then flattened them with a fork.

Great recipe!!!

I havn't made treats for my dogs in Years the last recipe was so complicated! These are so easy and the dogs went crazy! I have 3 Chinese shar-pei that love peanut butter! I am bringing to a dog meet up and favors in bags tied with little paw ribbon. I cut them into bone shapes! Thank you!

This was a very quick & easy recipe! I had all ingredients on hand. I just added a dab of honey. I just rolled into balls and pressed with a fork. It was easy to work with this way. Both of my dogs loved these. Even my picky Chow!

Since I'm not a dog, this recipe got a 3 instead of a 1.  I followed the recipe exactly, though dividing everything in half.  The dough was too dry, so I added a small amount of olive oil (which my dog already has to have daily due to a thyroid problem).  I rolled into balls and baked it.  Before they were finished, I saw that the balls hadn't flattened out at all, so I pressed them with a fork.  When they came out, merely touching them reduced most of them to crumbs.  On the plus side, though, my dog loves them.  So I will keep looking for another recipe to use once these are gone.

On behalf of my dogs, I must say these are the most delicious dog cookies in the world.  We made them to give away to all of our dog park friends for Christmas. My dogs absolutely love them and beg for more every time they get one. They were fun to make, too, since I bought bone shaped cookie cutters in three sizes.  Wonderful.

I just finished baking a batch and my little Cocolito just loves them!!!  This recipe is so incredibly easy and I think these homemade treats make great Christmas presents for my favorite furry friends!  I also added honey as well.  I even tasted one myself - not bad, but I think next time I will add even more honey!

My dogs (all three) went crazy for these.  I made a double batch and handed them out (cut into holiday shapes) for our friends' dogs alongside the holiday cookies we made.  They were a big hit all around.  I substituted 1/2 cup of wheat germ to make them extra wholesome!  They cooked in the smaller shapes in 1/2 the time.  The only problem is that they gave all of the dogs a lot of gas!

As soon as Ranger got home he ran right over to the stove and sat waiting for a cookie, so I'd say they were pretty good!  I used this recipe as a quick Christmas gift for dog buddies and it was super easy and quick to make - I was able to get it done while my baby was napping.  Love it!

Wilson & Pepper say these are yummy. Used half milk and half chicken broth, rolled out very nicely and used my new bones and hearts doggy-treat cutters. Made these on the spur of the moment and gave some to Wilson's doggie friends at the doggie Christmas party. Will make again for my boys. They loved them.

Buddy (my 2 year old beagle) and I agree that they are just okay.  I found the dough to be really hard to work with even after adding more than 1/2 cup of flour. And then after adding 2 mashed bananas to the dough, as well as 2 tablespoons of sugar, Buddy still prefers his milkbones. He is still eating them, and he is sniffing around trying to snatch one as we speak. So they won't go to waste. But as far as a homemade dog treat recipe, I think I'll keep looking.

My 6 month old Patterdale Terrier, Chase, loved these bones! I added a cup of mashed banana because he is a big banana lover. Cut them out with various sized bone and hydrant shaped cookie cutters (from thecookiecuttershop.com). These held up better than any recipe I've ever used, thanks!!! Oh one more thing... I saw a few reviews where people said they added garlic to this... garlic is NOT GOOD FOR DOGS!!!! Please don't give them garlic!

Well, since I'm not going to be tasting them, I'm rating on how wasy it was to make.  For homeschooling, I've been having my 5 year old son pick a recipe, write it down and shop for what is needed and make it.  This one was SO easy to make, he had a BLAST doing it.  He was able to make this one with minimal help. And for an added bonues he gets to bless our extended families dogs when we go for a visit.  I'm SURE that we'll be making this again.

I can't believe how much my golden retriever LOVES these biscuits!  She goes nuts over them, more than any treat I have ever bought at the pet store.  My kids love rolling, cutting and baking them (we have cool doggy-themed cookie cutters!) you can't go wrong with these =)

Four ingredients got my attention quick.  The majority of the crew gave a paws up for the treats.  I kept coming in the house between baking and thought I was smelling peanut butter cookies -you had me sold.  I acutally used regular flour thinking that's all I had at the time.  Made a double batch so we could share with friends & family.  Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty treat for my Danes.

My Boxer pup, Rupert, LOVES these. And they're easy to make. Can't beat that. Rupert seems to know when I'm making them for him, too. He gets all excited and prances around the kitchen.

Just made these for my doggies and can't believe how much they loved them!   Didn't have the natural peanut butter in the pantry, so used Jif and that worked. Can't wait to try them with the natural stuff which will make them even better.  Weezie, Farkus & Skippy say, "Thanks Tami!"

My dogs love this.. I roll it out per instruction and cut it into small pieces and use for training treats.. Works every time.
