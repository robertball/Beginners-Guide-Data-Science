If you make this recipe, follow it to the letter.  To the letter.  I did the usual substititutions (cheddar cheese and mexican spices for the mexican cheese and plain yogurt, sugar, and lemon juice for the lemon yogurt), as per ingredient necessity, and it was good--for a laugh.  I made it for a family bake-off and won "Most Humorous Entry."  It tasted terrible.  Terrible.  But the submitter was right--it did become a "conversation piece" and "the center attention for days afterward."  Did it ever.

Call me crazy, but I don't think the "Mexican-style cheese" in this recipe refers to "cheese with Mexican spices" as a previous reviewer put it.  It's a dessert, after all. I think a better substitution might be ricotta cheese.

Delicious with a wonderful texture. Although cornbreads themselves are not meant to be sweet, to this sugar hound, it needed to be much more sweetness, the second time around I added about 2/3 cup more of sweetener (I use Splenda-tm). Good for snacking.

It could almost be a bread without sweetener, using plain yogurt and adding jalapenos. Any takers?

This was not at all the cheesecake I was expecting. I was told from a customer at an old job that "avocado cheesecake is the best kind of cheesecake you'll ever have". I suppose I should have looked at other recipes before trying this one. It is not a traditional New York-style cheesecake, but rather an avocado cheese cornbread. I baked it for a few extra minutes because it did not turn "golden brown", and even then it only cooked about a half-inch through, while remaining a gritty mush underneath. However, I believe I have learned a valuable lesson and am looking forward to making an actual avocado cheesecake.

When I shopped for ingredients, I cannot get the self-rising cornmeal, so I substitute with self-rising flours. It works out find in my case and tasty as well. One thing quite impressive - easy to make!

I made my own self rising cornmeal mix using whole wheat flour.  Then, I used the required amount of Greek yogurt when cutting the recipe in half!  This is a light, delicate bread!  It made a great breakfast treat!
