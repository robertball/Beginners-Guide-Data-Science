My husband and I love this recipe.  We have had them many many times for dinner so far and they have been great and tasty.  The second time I added Real Bacon Bits and it went very well with the recipe.  Now we don't ever have regular green beans anymore and we've gotten so use to making the recipe that we make it without measuring anything.  My husband made these for Thanksgivings and our guests also loved them.  This recipe has become a regular in our house.

I was looking for something to add to my canned green beans that didn't overpower but gave good flavor! I'll be making this recipe again!

I thought that these were okay, I drained them before serving, and they went over well with the true test, "picky girl", she liked them, a lot.  I think that I would 1/2 the soy & Worcestershire sauces next time.  Don't add any salt, as they have plenty as it is.  Thanks Denise ;)

We like green beans, fresh, frozen & canned. I have made this several times using all three types. Each time someone asks me for the recipe. This is great for a pot luck dish. A nice twist for green beans.

just plain beans that taste great! couldn't have said it better myself. I substituted chicken bouillon for beef and used frozen green beans and they turned out great.

These just have a nice different flavor.  The first time I made them I kept thinking I wish more of the flavor went through the beans.  Well, the next time I made them, I put the beans in a shallow container, poured the liquid on, sealed and let them marinate in the refrigerator for several hours.  Great flavor.  One thing I did differently.  I don't use bouillon cubes, so used a teaspoon of beef soup base instead.

I've made this several times now and I LOVE it!!!  The only change I made was using Dale's seasoning instead of Worchestershire sauce.  I've also used this on purple hull peas and it turned out great!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe it will be staple in my home for years to come!  UPDATE:  I use this recipe constantly and wanted to come back to say that if you're reading this you should definitely try it!  It's great!

Easy to make and tastes good. I used crushed garlic and pepper instead of garlic pepper and also added a pinch of salt. Thanks

This recipe is in here twice. Anyway, pretty good! A good low carb choice. Easy way to improve canned green beans. I used 1 t. beef bouillon granules.

Very tasty - green beans are not my husband's favorite but he liked this. I used fresh green beans and they worked just fine. The only problem I had with it is it doesn't look too appetizing because the green beans pick up some of the brown coloring from the sauce....so maybe not great for that gourmet meal for guests....

The Wrchr sauce was a bit much for me, but my son loved it and ate most of it.  I only had frozen french cut beans, so maybe if i had used the canned, the flavor would've been different for me.  But great in a pinch.

Great recipe...made for a dinner party and everyone thought they were fantastic.  Only thing I would do differently is add everything to the pan before adding the beans.  Stir minimally to avoid tearing up the beans as they cook.

Awesome recipe!  I was looking for something different to do with a can of green beans and I came across this recipe.  I didn't have beef buillon so I just used a cube of chicken instead.  Also, the sauce was a bit salty for me, so I added about 1 tsp of brown sugar to mellow out the salty flavor a little.  It was SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!  What a way to spruce up a can of beans!  Who woulda thunk it!

I served Denise's green beans with my Christmas dinner and everyone thought they were great.  No leftovers.  I followed her recipe to the letter with no alterations and wouldn't attempt change her recipe at all.  Nice job Denise.

Tasty! My daughter usually scarfs green beans cooked in soy sauce, but I wanted to change things up a bit to go with our spaghetti... And this was great! I omitted the butter and used a little garlic powder and pepper in place of garlic pepper... Oh, and I added about 1/2 tsp of brown sugar (to entice her, of course!) and it was a hit. The leftovers are very ugly but extra delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!

My 15 month old daughter generally eats her vegetables without problem, but these green beans made her wholly disinterested with the entire rest of the meal! Very good! Will make again!

Very easy to make.  I didn't have any worshcheshire sauce, so I used liquid smoke instead.  Ok, but really salty.  I wouldn't make all of the time, but good for a change every once in a while.

Good green beans, nice flavor. Really perked up plain old canned green beans and you'd never know they were canned. So quick and so easy. Great side dish. I didn't have garlic/pepper so I used minced garlic and white pepper instead.

These were ok. The flavor was subtle. Probably too subtle to go through the hassle of soaking the buillion and such.

Super-easy twist to canned green beans. One of of my daughters, who hates canned green beans, actually liked these and wanted seconds. It didn't knock my socks off, but for sheer simplicity, I'm sure I'll prepare beans like this again when I'm short on time and need a tastier veggie side than plain beans.

Super-simple to prepare.  I thought it was a bit heavy on the worchestershire, but that's easy to fix for next time.

A tasty and easy way to make just canned green beans seem a little more than just canned green beans..

I can't believe how much I liked these!  I love green beans anyway, but this made them a much more interesting side dish.  I disagree with some of the reviews that said they didn't have enough flavor.  I think the whole point is that the flavor is subtle so you can still taste the green beans.  In my opinion adding extra spices or turning the liquid into a thickened sauce would defeat the purpose.  Great recipe, Denise!!

We didn't really care for these. I added more seasonings, teriyaki sauce and even thickened the liquid with a bit of cornstarch but they were still flavorless. Sorry.

These green beans were okay, but were pretty much just canned green beans in beef broth. I tried to lighten the sodium by using low-sodium green beans and low-sodium soy sauce, but this recipe is definitely not one for someone watching salt in their diet. Was quick to make, anyhow, and I am sure they will get eaten.

very tasty! I mixed everything(except butter) and let beans marinate in liquid for about 2hours and then cooked with butter and garlic pepper. My kids really liked this,so i will cook again.......soon.

These were easy and tasty.  I used fresh green beans just because we like them better than canned.  I put the beans in a pot and put in water to approximate the amount that would have been in a can.  I added the other ingredients and brought to a boil, then covered the pot and "steamed" them.  Very good, a definite keeper.  Even good leftover too.  Kids loved them.

These were decent...but very salty and didn't really keep any of the good green bean flavor.  I think I'll stick to steamed fresh green beans with a dash of salt!

This recipe deserves 5 stars for being so easy and so tasty.  The flavor was delicious without being overpowering so I think it would suit all tastes.  And I love that it only too a minute to prepare.  Next week I'll be trying a variation with frozen beans.

Wow. Nice flavorful green bean dish. I'm not sure how to describe the flavor, but these were quite tasty. A great use for canned green beans! I used garlic salt and added a bit of minced garlic from the jar.  Thanks Denise for sharing this keeper.

A nice way to make beans more interesting, but flavour a little mild for my taste.  Will try again, but marinade for longer.

My husband gave these a four star rating, although I would have given them a three.  I used fresh green beans, so I had a little bit of a hard time knowing how much water to put in and how long to cook them.  If I make them again, I think I'll try them with the canned green beans.

I loved this recipe--simple and delicious way to dress up canned green beans. Also a lot less fat than the way I usually season green beans (with bacon grease) but with just as much flavor. Will make again.

Just what I was looking for!  Great flavor, and easy recipe to get on the table fast.  Next time I may add a little onion, just because I like onion in green beans, not because it needed it.

Very easy and fast. I added 3 roasted garlic cloves while dissolving beef bouillon cube.  I also added dried chopped onion.  I'm not a huge Worcestershire fan so I may cut it back a bit but not all the way to half next time.  I will also try adding bacon, it makes everything better!

I'll be honest, I was not a huge fan. I love canned greened beans, was looking for something a little different for my first time cooking family dinner on Christmas Eve. I think the problem is I'm not a huge Worcestershire fan. I did only put half in like some people recommended.

It wasn't bad by any means. I would of probably just rather had canned beans with some butter. I do wish I had of had bacon bits to add. 

My sister, on the other hand, couldn't really tell the difference, except to say she normally doesn't like canned green beans but it was just different enough that she actually liked these. My aunt couldn't really tell a big difference in taste either.

I really liked this--a great way to spice up canned green beans.  I halved the recipe to try it, which worked for me because I have beef bullion powder instead of beef bullion cubes.  I forgot the butter completely but we both liked it anyway.  I'll make it again.

This was a very special vegetable I served on Christmas day.  I used 3 cans Italian green beans (to serve 10 people) and added frozen pearl onions.  I did not drain the beans so that I could keep it warm (without drying out) in a crock pot til dinner was ready.  The liquid cooked the onions in two hours with crock pot on low.

I asked my husband to rate these and he answered, "Four and a half stars".  (I didn't eat them due to allergies.)  Since this recipe provided me with a quick and easy way to make my green beans delicious forever more, I'm tempted to give them five.

I cut the recipe in half since I only had 1 can of  french style green beans. I also used chicken bouillon in place of the beef. We really liked this since the flavor was not overpowering but added that little something extra to give it a boost. I will definitley make this again!

I'm not sure that I'd make this recipe again - fairly easy, but nothing special - you probably could achieve the same effect with a bit of garlic powder and lemon pepper, and not so many ingredients.  I don't really care for canned vegetables, so this may be an unfair review as well...try it - you may like it!

These beans are quite good! Be careful not to use too much boullion because it can make the green beans too salty. But this is definitely more interesting than boring old beans from a can!

We thought these were OK, but not quite our taste.  I am going to try again using a chicken bouillon cube instead of beef and add more garlic.

I have never mixed worcestershire or soy into green beans before! It has a bit of a twang. My husband loves green beans so I was looking for something to change it up. He loved them!

This is great!  As a vegetarian, I used a vegetable bouillon cube and it worked very well.  I also substituted garlic powder for the garlic pepper.  A great way to put some flavor into canned green beans!

I had never used a bouillion cube before, so maybe that was it, but to me it made the beans smell and taste like cat food! I may try it again without the bouiliion cube and see if I like it better.

I have a small family so I only used 1 can. I did not drain any liquid, instead I used all liquid and added 1 tbsp of soy sauce rather than 1 tsp. This was absolutely delicious.  My kids even loved it and they are picky eaters. Thanx for this recipe.

I really did like this recipe. As other reviewers have said, it was a little subtle but still very delicious. I will add some bacon fat the next time I make this.

I use this recipe when I’m low on groceries. It almost fools your buds into thinking there is either bacon somewhere, or, a little bit of smokiness. I don’t fix this often but when I do it will fit the veggie space.

No beef bullion so subbed a few slices of bacon and left our the butter. Delicious! A good solid flavor that complements the main dish without overwhelming it.

We love these green beans. I never have garlic pepper so I use some garlic powder and regular pepper. Sometimes add in minced garlic as well if I have it. Tasty and super fast/easy! Gives the green beans a great flavor. We make our green beans like this every time we have them now.

I love lots of flavor and though the smell of the cooking beans was strong and delicious, the taste was more subtle.  I may try soaking the beans in the ingredients before cooking, or removing more of the canned liquid next time.  I also added sautéed garlic and mushrooms to mine.

I'm giving this five stars because it's a great starting point.  I use the bullion cube and add just enough beef broth to cover the beans.  I add the wostershire for the unique flavor and ground pepper.  Tastes just like cafeteria beans and I love it.  Enjoy.

The other reviews made we think this was only going to turn out so-so, but I really liked it.  It's not the most spectacular recipe I've ever encountered, but then again...they're green beans.

I'm definately adding this to the rotation.  Good job, Mom!

The best thing I can say about this is that it's not the usual green bean casserole with the mushroom soup and french fired onion pieces. It beats that and it's better than plain beans, but it wasn't that impressive. It's very simple and easy. I used frozen green beans because I can't stand most canned vegetables. In the end, not bad but not a five-star.

YUMMY!!  The only thing I did different is I used garlic salt instead of garlic pepper and I put in a little more than directed because I'm a garlic lover.

I just dont like canned green beans.  It was a recipe too mild to cover up the canned flavor for me.

This was an excellent way to use canned green beans.  I served it to our neighbors and they loved it too.  I would prefer to use fresh or frozen, but had neither so anytime I need to use up some canned vegies, I'll be grabbing for this recipe.

This was very good. I would recommend less salt (minus the bouillon) and used frozen or fresh green beans. Hubby loved it.

I was looking for an easy green bean recipe for tonight's dinner.  Usually frozen green beans are a pretty tasteless side dish and I was hoping for a recipe that would rate seconds.  This was very easy and very tasty. I used frozen green beans and also used my microwave.  (16 oz. green beans and about 3/4 to one cup of water) As said before, it is a very subtle flavor.  My husband and I both liked this side dish (and had seconds!)and I will be using this recipe often I think.

What a different taste! Served this at our Easter gathering and everyone loved them. They kept going back for seconds and thirds. I used a huge can of green beans from Sams Club and just tripled the recipe.

Great way to perk up plain canned green beans!  I don't think I'll make green beans (especially canned) any other way!  I especially like them with garlic mashed potatoes for some reason!

This was great-tasting and easy to prepare.  My young daughter liked it OK, but commented that it was "kind of spicy."  However, since all of us liked it, it will definately be on the menu again!

These were very good! I like to use whole green beans instead of cut and I added a little extra butter and some garlic salt. I also added a few pearl onions for flavor. Thanks!

Can be improved by lightly sauteeing 2 ounces sliced almonds in butter to begin, then continue with the recipe.
