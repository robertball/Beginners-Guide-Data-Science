This was my first time cooking with turnips, and this turned out beautifully! My partner even asked for seconds! Great flavor, easy to make, and surprisingly filling served with rice. I didn't have green chiles but added ~1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and it was a perfect level of spice without being too overwhelming. Will definitely make again!

Honestly one of the most delicious things that I have EVER cooked.  I can't even believe how good these turnips were.  I was eating the leftovers directly out of the pan with a fork and drinking the leftover cooking liquid!

Delish! I didn't have coriander, so I'll add that next time. Had this as a side dish with steak.

This was delicious! I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of crushed tomatoes.
