So good!  We did this camping and in a Dutch Oven/on a grill and it was perfect.  I'm usually not one for too spicy food, but the more cajun spice that was added, the better it tasted!

Very good way to prepare prime rib.  The spice is not too much and it looks hard to make but it really is pretty quick other then the waiting time for it to marinate.

This is excellent!  I'm always anxious to eat it.  The entire house smokes up but its worth it.
