Mmm, mmm, mmm... I left out the miso paste and added 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. It made a huge difference in the flavor.

These were good. The recipe didn't say anything about cooking the garlic--4 raw minced cloves would have been too much for me--so I sauteed the garlic in a little bit of oil, mixed in the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer before adding the green beans.

The recipe is probably great if you follow the directions. It is very important to use low-sodium soy sauce like it states. I had regular soy sauce on hand, and the only miso paste I found in the store had added sea salt (I don't know if this is typical). The result was so salty that I couldn't finish it. It was even too much for my boyfriend, who puts salt on everything.

I am not a very good cook and I prepared this with frozen green beans and steamed until boiled dry.This was the most delicious side dish .I couldn't believe I prepared it myself.I am also serving this with the Aussie Chicken for my daughters rehearsal dinner.Follow steps and you can't go wrong.

Miso paste is sold in a little tub, in the cold section of the grocery store,  where tofu or health food is found. The miso paste gives the sauce some body and helps with coating the beans. Four cloves of garlic is way too much. I used two, and thought it was more than enough. A good recipe and a nice change for the normal green beans.

This was a last-minute decision and I didn't have fresh green beans, so I just used canned. (blush) Heated them on the stovetop.  In separate pan, toasted the sesame seeds; set aside.  Used same pan to saute garlic in a tiny bit of olive oil & an even tinier touch of sesame oil.  In separate bowl, mixed soy sauce, red pepper flakes, sauteed garlic, freshly grated ginger and poured over drained green beans.  Added toasted sesame seeds in just before serving.  It was a nice side dish for a weeknight dinner.

Delicious!  I didn't have ginger and it was just fine.  Also, I used sesame oil instead of miso (again since I didn't have it in the house) and they turned out great.  Of course, the more garlic, the better.  Thanks for posting - excellent!

Really enjoyed this simple recipe. Tasted great with a bar-b-cued tri-tip (beef). Quick, just make sauce before hand...do the beans at last minute when serving your meal.

I really like this recipe.  I agree, 4 cloves of garlic is a lot even though I like garlic a lot.  I would like to try it with cooked garlic but didn't this time.  I also added a bit of sesame oil.

Nice and easy recipe. Be sure to use the low sodium soy sauce as regular is much too strong.

This recipe was fantastic.  Instead of using a steamer, I just fried them in the sauce in the fry pan and garnished with the sesame seeds.

Fabulous beans!  I had friends over for dinner and all 3 of them said that these were the BEST BEANS they ever had in their life!  For people that aren't into the flavor of beans themselves, this is a great recipe because the spices add so much flavor, its like a party in your mouth!  This is a must use recipe!

I'm not big on fresh green beans, but if they are served like this, I'll eat them any time. These were fantastic. Just enough flavoring. I fed this to my 2 year old niece and she ate it up like candy. She even asked for seconds. I did cut back on the red pepper flakes for her sake, but I will definitely be making this again.

Miso paste can be hard to find, but I buy dry Miso Soup (Wal-Mart or most grocery stores), remove the dried tofu cubes, and combine the remaining spices with the soy sauce...works well. Everyone loves these beans!

I cheated a little with this recipe.  I threw some vegetables in  pan, stir fried them a couple of minutes, and then added the rest of the ingredients for the sauce into the pan, throwing the sesame seeds on top of everything at the end as a garnish.  The sauce cooked down into a great glaze!  It was sweet, tangy, spicy, and salty all at the same time.  It would be very good over almost vegetable, meat, or rice.  This is so simple but so good!  Thanks for sharing!

The fresh green beans didn't look very good at the grocery store so I purchased frozen whole green beans. Didn't have miso paste so I substituted sesame oil as suggested by other users. I would also use at least half the red pepper flakes as called for unless you really like spicy food.

Really good. I have to say I didn't follow exactly though. Instead I used CdIP's review idea of leaving out the miso paste and adding sesame oil, so I guess in this case it's not a true review of the recipe.
Anyway, it was really enjoyed by everyone!

These were ok, a little spicy for me with the red pepper flakes.  I used frozen green beans, so maybe that is why I didn't find them super stellar...

This was really great!  I subed 1/2 tsp wasabi powder for the red pepper flakes, and added some rice vinegar since the sauce was a bit thick.  The miso makes a big difference.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe.

Seems like all my wife ever wants is canned green beans. So one night I served this and she loved it! If you are looking for something different from the same old beans try this! Good luck trying to find the miso though. Takes great without it!

This was very good and simple.  I didn't have the miso paste, so I just left it out but plan on making it again with it. I also used ginger paste, because its what I had. I used about 1/2 teaspoon. I added a tablespoon of sesame oil to the mixture too. Very good! Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor. However next time I wont add the entire amount of red pepper flakes. The beans turned out way too hot for my family.

This was fast and easy and a good, healthy dinner. I'll make it again soon. I did use low sodium soy sauce on it and it was still a little on the salty side, but I usually don't add much salt to my cooking.

Great flavor but wow, these were spicy! I even cut the red pepper in half and glad I did. I did sautee the garlic before adding the rest. Yep, they're quick.

I loved this dish! As long as you have the miso paste on hand, it couldn't be easier.  GO easy on the pepper though, it can be a bit hot!

I loved the 'kick' of these green beans. I only had elephant garlic, so I used one clove of that. It was pretty strong, I will use regular garlic next time. I also didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger. Seemed fine to me.

Yummy!  It was too spicey for the kids but the adults like it. Next time I will not add as much red pepper so everyone can enjoy it. Unfortunately my grocery store unfortunately did not have miso paste.  Next time I will be sure to find it somewhere.  Great addition to the Grilled Salmon I from this site.

I like this a lot but my teenage son wasn't a fan.  Instead of using sesame oil to cook with, I cooked it in EVOO and added a splash of sesame oil at the end.  Very good dish. I especially like the toasted sesame seeds.

It was okay - I didn't have miso paste so I used Sesame Oil as other reviewers did.  I'm not crazy about sesame oil so this might very well deserve a 5 star rating if I had been able to duplicate this recipe.  Thanks submitter.

very nice flavor, the crisp beans were a nice crunch compared to my otherwise mushy meal of tofu stirfry and rice lol.  would have been 5 stars if the sauce were thicker to better coat the beans.  i need to mess around with this to thicken it up.  still pretty yumtastic!

I sauteed the garlic with the red pepper flakes, soy sauce, and sesame oil (all based on earlier reviews).  Nice side dish!  I paired it along with terriyaki orange ginger chicken and cocunut rice.

Great recipe! My family loved this.  Like others, I wondered about the amount of garlic in the sauce.  It would probably be better if you sauteed the garlic before adding it to the green beans, but I was running short on time so I just sprinkled a little garlic powder in the sauce.  In fact, I didn't use any miso and I didn't even bother toasting the sesame seeds before I sprinkled them on top and it still turned out great! If you like your green beans a little crunchy you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

the recipe appeared to be to concentrated for me, so I tripled the beans quantity and it still tasted a tiny bit to salty for me but very good anyway. I will redo that for sure !

This is my recipe, and I have made a change that makes it even easier, I use the steamfresh green beans that you get from the frozen food section. They cook in 5 minutes in the microwave! The store  stopped carrying the miso paste I had been using, and used another brand did not like it as much - so now I do not use any. Love it with toasted sesame oil!

Yummy!  Didn't have miso paste (don't even know what that is--guess I need to find out!) so I didn't put that in, and I didn't have time to toast the sesame seeds.  Other than my overcooking the green beans (distracted--again!) they were awesome.  Quick and yummy!

OMG!  These green beans were to die for!  Nice flavor, great taste, and beautiful to serve.  I couldn't find miso paste at my grocer, so I substituted sesame oil.  Also, I used frozen green beans, as I didn't want to clean and snap fresh.  Fantastic! We will be having this again!

We loved this recipe! I used wasabi paste instead of miso paste by accident, but the spicy twist was actually really nice! If you'd like to try it, I'd recommend that unless you enjoy a real kick, try using only about a teaspoon.

My kids & I agree that our old standby - seasoned rice vinegar & toasted sesame oil - is still our favorite Asian green bean recipe.

We used broccolini instead of green beans and they were a hit.

These are delicious! Very simple to make and I'm glad to have a new use for miso paste. I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

Wow! I was also looking for a recipe like I get at my favourite Chinese restaraunt. These were great. I tried suteeing the garlic once, but found it didn't quite pack the same punch. My dad will make dinner for us, but asks me to do the sauce for the green beans.
EXCELLENT!!

Good tip about cooking the garlic.  Nice flavor.  Didn't have miso paste and used regular soy sauce.  

Would make again.  Dresses up greenbeans.

It was almost great! My only problem with this recipe was that even using lower sodium soy sauce, it turned out far too salty for me and my husband's tastes.  We do tend to eat relatively low sodium if we can in general, so maybe we're more sensitive to saltiness, but I couldn't finish my beans as they were.  I will have to cook up some extra green beans without seasonings and  mix them into the seasoned beans to dilute the salt. But I would have loved this recipe if it hadn't seemed so salty to me. :)  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a simple dish for m my 13yr old to make for school Asian day potluck.  This was perfect.  I looked at several different recipes and I actually modified my recipe to incorporate a couple recipes into one.  First I could not find miso Paste ate the store I used sesame oil instead.  We also sautéed nonsalted butter (Land O Lakes) soy sauce  and sesame oil in our pan with my sesame seeds, ginger and garlic.  I am not a measurer, but we added more to the recipe because I wanted more coating on my beans.   While We sautéed, my green beans were steaming.  We then combined the beans in my skillet mixture and coated them very good.  I removed from heat and let them for a few minutes to "marinate".   Before serving she added a handful of shaved almonds to the top but not necessary..  the seeds made them very pretty in her bowl. 

I will  def make these again and my kitchen smelled like I was at a Hibachi grill.   The sesame oil really brought the flavors together!!

I made this recipe as written.  Although my guest seemed to like it, I gave it 3 stars because for me personally the texture of the sauce didn't really work for me.  Some parts of the green beans were very spicy so have some water nearby.

Be sure and use Lite Soy Sauce because this is salty - I also would omit salt in the water for the beans when cooking. I didn't have miso paste so I followed others' suggestion and added about 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. Also used just one large clove of garlic since it was raw.  I thought this recipe was sooo salty (and I love salt!) so I added about 2 tablespoons brown sugar to try and counter balance the salt - ended up with a great tasting sauce when served with the beans & toasted sesame seeds - will be making this again

Instead of soy sauce, ginger and garlic I simply used low sodium teriyaki sauce and achieved a wonderful flavor. I did add miso paste, pepper flakes as directed.

Quick Sesame Green Beans Haiku: "So easy to make, and the taste was super good. No miso paste here." Didn't use the optional miso paste, but did add a couple drops of sesame oil. Loved the simplicity of the recipe and the fact that it would complement just about any entree; yummers!

Very quick and good! I steamed the green beans, and sauteed the garlic, red pepper flakes, and ginger in a little bit of sesame oil and soy sauce. I didn't have miso, and the sesame oil gave it just enough sesame flavor. I spooned the soy/garlic mixture over the beans and gave them a quick stir. Delicious!

My family loved this!  I didn't have any fresh garlic or ginger so I used garlic paste and ginger paste that I had in the fridge.  The only thing I'm going to do different next time I make it is use less red pepper flakes to make it more crowd friendly, but personally I liked the level of heat!!

I really liked this recipe. I omitted the miso paste and used regular soy sauce (because I thought it was low-sodium). When I realized it and tasted it was way to salty so I used honey to even out the salt and that worked. In the future I would only use 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes, the 1/2 tsp. was too spicy for me.

Used frozen green beans, but I bet fresh ones would be much better.  Used Braggs Liquid Aminos in place of soy sauce.  Cut red pepper to 1/4 tsp, garlic to 2 cloves.  Used ground ginger and Gomascio (ground sesame seeds w/sea salt which I got at Vitacost).   Good, quick and easy!  ;)

I followed this recipe to the letter.  The fresh ingredients were delicious smelling.  The end result, in my opinion, was a little Americanized (you could make the same paste, for example, and add it to burgers or meatloaf, etc. to make something more "Asian") as in, this is what Americans think Japanese food might taste like.  

What I do is I like to have steaks, white steamed rice and whatever vegetable for dinner a few nights a week.  If I have broccoli I usually grill it or toast some sesame seeds on it.  However, green beans I always have in the freezer.  If I have nothing fresh, this sesame green beans are definitely a fun side.  It really keeps dinner neat and organized, and I keep the other ingredients including the miso paste and sesame seeds on hand as I just adore them.

MMMMmmmm...really good and really easy. This dish has a lot of character.  It really is better with fresh green beans, but canned works in the winter time here in the frozen north when there's almost nothing fresh to eat.

Wonderful flavor!  I also did not have miso paste, but took the suggestion of another reviewer to use wasabi - I used a generous 1/4 t. for half the recipe.  My husband's (unsolicited) comment (and he usually doesn't say anything unless I ask)was "wonderful flavor".  Will keep these in the rotation.

I have made this twice in a month.  The first time seemed to have a lot of excess juice, the second time it was perfect!  Both times I used sesame oil instead of the miso.  Couldn't find it at the store...

Added rice as I was low on green beans. Tasted good.

I haven't been able to find the miso paste so I just skip that, and I use ground ginger rather than fresh - but we love these green beans.  Even the kids will eat them if there isn't too much red pepper on them.

This recipe is requested at every family get together!  At the end of the meal my sister will actually grab the serving bowl and eat the rest of the green beans as dessert!

Keep making these over and over but I add a cornstarch/water mixture to make the sauce thicker!

Yum. I bought a steamer basket specifically for this recipe, since it was so good the first couple of times I stir-fried the green beans. Wouldn't change anything about the recipe; is definitely a favorite.

Really, only so-so.  I should have known that I wasn't a huge fan of ginger and eased off of that.  Also, I couldn't find miso paste at the grocery store and didn't feel like making the extra trip to the store they suggested.  I used a sauce to replace it that may have been too spicey. I don't think I'll be trying these again.

Disappointing. Used toasted sesame oil instead of miso (because I don't like it). Expected more flavor.

Couldn't find miso, so I used sesame oil. Didn't have fresh ginger, so I minced pickled sushi ginger instead. I let it sit overnight, so the 1T of red pepper flakes was WAY too hot!! And I like hot! The boyfriend liked it so much he asked me to make it for his dad's birthday.

A great alternative to plain green beans with butter! The sesame seeds were the perfect accompaniment. Also added 1 Tbsp sesame oil to the sauce. Next time I will steam them longer, since we don't like our beans quite so crisp. I used my Oster steamer for 8 minutes but will probably steam for 15 minutes next time. The red pepper adds an unexpected but delicious kick, too!

I would definitely not stray from using fresh green beans. If you are a green bean lover the sesame is a nice taste with them. My husband didnt care for it very much but I liked it.
