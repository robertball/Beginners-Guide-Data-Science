This Cole Slaw is so good. My family and I don't care for bell pepper and onions in our slaw, so I left them out and it was still scrumptious.
Here is a little tip I heard about from a chef on the cable food network. As you know all veggies have quite a bit of water so if you but the cabbage in a colander and sprinkle a little salt over it. It will remove the excess water from the cabbage. This process takes about 30 minutes to an hour but it gives you a very crisp cabbage and the slaw is not watery.

This cole slaw is soooo good, I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did differently was to put a tablespoon of lemon juice on the apples while I chopped up the rest of the ingriedients, I did this the first time I made the salad, I didn't do it the second time and the apples turned brown after 2 days. I still added the lemon juice that the recipe calls for.

This is an absolutely awesome recipe.  So simple and easy to throw together.  For a change of pace, I occasionally throw in pecans or sunflower seeds for a little something different...  This has joined a list of favorites in our household!

This recipe was fantastic.  It's probably the best slaw I've ever had.  I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and added a couple Tbl. of cider vinegar in addition to the lemon juice.  Thanks for the recipe Aunt Mamie.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I added 1 tsp. vinegar to the mayo mix and topped the slaw off with dried crandberries and sliced almonds.  My son had about 4 helpings and said be sure to keep the recipe for this one!  I thought about adding some salad shrimp or chunks of chicken next time and make it a meal!

This recipe is excellent.  I've made it several times and am ALWAYS asked to bring it to family functions.  I always buy a pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mixture to make prep easier and also change up the apples from time to time (try Fuji or Gala, you must keep the granny smith though for the tartness).  I skip the red pepper and sometimes add a little extra dressing.  This is WONDERFUL and keeps for several days.  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe, Aunt Mamie!!

Very refreshing! This recipe is so versatile, you can add many crunchy fruits and veggies to it. I added fresh pineapple slices to mine, and a little bit of green onions. I love coleslaw and find this one to have a good balance of creaminess, sweetness and tanginess. Will definately make again.

My friend brought this salad to work and it was a hit! I loved it. It is so refreshing! I made this for my boyfriend today who is a coleslaw fanatic and he loved it. I did buy a bag of pre-shredded cabbage/carrot mix to make prep easier and I added 1 tsp vinegar because he doesn't like things too sweet. I think the next time I make this for myself I will add some dried cranberries and sliced almonds as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Awesome recipe!!!  I omitted the onions (as done by a previous reviewer) and added another carrot in their place.  The whole family loved it - thanks!!

We loved this cole slaw.  It does not overdo the mayo like so many recipes.  I think the apples and the dressing are a must as is, but you could add or subtract to the rest of it to fit your taste.

Great combination of crunchy and sweet! I made this a little easier and just used a bag of coleslaw mix thus eliminating the need for the grated carrot. I also opted out of the green onion and instead used a little celery. I did add a bit of seasoned salt and some fresh cracked black pepper and cut the mayo with a bit of sour cream. This definitely needs to set for a few hours before serving.

Loved the creamy, sweet brown sugar dressing with the fresh veggies and crunch of the apples. Added a very nice & new touch for a picnic of  grilled burgers and potato salad. This is a "keeper".

I first found this recipe about a year ago and have made it since several times. It's a huge favorite with a couple of small tweaks: (1) add a couple tablespoons of lightly salted sunflower seeds (the salt-sweet combo is heavenly), and (2) increase mayo to 1/2 c. and add 1/4 c. apple cider or balsamic vinegar. I've made it this way and brought it to several gatherings, and it's always one of the first dishes to disappear. I'll be making it even more now that I've acquired a good food processor. Aunt Mamie, you're my hero!

This is the BEST! The quanities of the ingredients are perfect.  Onion will overpower and Red Pepper can overpower. Be careful.  I am asked for the recipe EVERYTIME..Let the "dressing sit abit" to allow the br sugar to dissolve before adding it to the salad.  You won't be disappointed.  Soooooo Good!

I have made this recipe twice for a family that I cook for.  They love it!  The first time I made it exactly as written.  The next time I added raisins, dried cherries & chopped pecans.  Delicious.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I loved it!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I made changes based on other reviews. I added 2 Tbsp of Cider vinegar to the dressing. I tossed granny smith and zestar apple chunks in lemon juice to keep from browning. I used a bag of classic cole slaw mix(has shredded carrots in it already), tossed in slivered almonds and some mixed blend raisins(cran, golden, cherry & blue) from Trader Joe's.
Also, I think next time I'd use a little less brown sugar.
I give my version 5 stars!  
Hope this is useful information!

Wonderful recipe!  I don't care for "common" coleslaw, so the bit of sweetness was awesome!  I took this dish to a potluck and it was a hit :)  Thanks!

WOW..best fruit cole slaw EVER. Definitely try different apples, but gotta keep in the green apple for tart. When cutting the apples..toss with a tablespoon of lemon juice per apple to keep from browning and also add the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for:) I kept all the reviewers suggestions in mind and my best suggestion would be too add everything in, but leave out the onions and bell pepper, then mix in the dressing (which is PERFECT as is) and taste...see if you like it sweeter rather than a bit more spicy? Spicy really isn't the word, but you know what I mean a bit closer to a neutral taste/tangy/tart side. I found adding the bell pepper after that was tangy enough so I omitted the onions. I also added a Tablespoon of Apple Vinegar..the mixture of tang to sweet was perfect, but make sure to cut the bell pepper into small pieces:) Oh and buy the precut cabbage bag mixed with carrots, cuts down the water build up;)

Love it. Per my personal preference, I decreased the cabbage to 2 cups and increased the apples and carrots to 3 each. The last time I made it I also added more peppers so I had orange, red and yellow ones. Very colorful and tasty. Very versatile recipe. Thank you.

This is a very tasty salad. I didn`t use so much brown sugar, just to taste. And I used 2 cups red cabbage and 1 cup a regular cabbage. Turned out wonderful, everybody wanted for more.

I have made this before and really liked it. After reading the reviews I will try salting the cabbage in a collander to get some of the moisture out. Also soaking the apples in lemon water is a great tip.

I love reading the comments because you see how different everyone's taste is! Some love onions, some don't. I would never think of putting pineapple in a cole slaw, but might try it someday.

I was pretty happy with this recipe, I'm always on a neverending hunt for the perfect coleslaw!! I salted my cabbage like a previous member suggested and it worked to keep my cabbage crispy, even till the next day!! The only thing I changed was that I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo so I also cut down on the lemon juice. Even my super picky sister was going back for seconds!!!

This recipe is wonderful.  I double the apple, and cut the apple pieces into fairly small chunks. The first time I made it the apple pieces were too big and fell off the fork.  I also shake the apple pieces in extra lemon juice before assembly so it lasts longer without browning.  Due to personal preference, I substitute bell pepper for the red pepper, and substitute some shopped celery for most of the green onion.  It would be good with nuts, too.  The dressing is delicious.  Thanks!

This slaw is addictive! Everyone I have ever served it too can't stop eating it. I doubled the recipe for a crowd about 4 hours before serving; is better if you do it the day before. I use a slotted spoon to transfer the slaw to another bowl if the sauce gets runny. I also use the lemon juice on the apples as I chop them up; no trouble with browning at all, even the next day. I added a 1/2 a medium onion chopped finely instead of the 2 green onions and a few hits of red pepper sauce for an extra zing; also salt and pepper to taste. A great picnic slaw. I took this batch to a lobster roast and not a smidgen left.

I've gotten so many compliments on this recipe and am always requested to bring it!  What I like to do is, thinly slice the apples with a mandolin before chopping them (I also slice the red pepper this way, and squeeze out all of the juice before addding to everything); I think it helps the flavors to blend more when dealing with smaller pieces as opposed to large chunks.  I also use Splenda brown sugar to cut the carbs a bit and you can't even tell the difference (on the bag, it will tell you the amount to use).  One last thing, I buy the pre-packaged angel hair cabbage, and like that best.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was ok but noone liked it as well as my oriental cole slaw recipe.  The dressing was still sweet and I only used 3/4 cups sugar.  It tasted like apples with a light dressing.  I'll not make this again.

Just a note to my original review to say that I replaced the brown sugar in this recipe with coconut palm sugar, a more healthy choice, and one that requires much less in quantitiy for the same sweetness. Still a great, popular recipe around this house!

A delicious blend of flavors and texture combine to make a nice addition to a summer barbecue. I added a bit more mayo and lemon juice when the slaw was too dry with original ingredients. I also added two tablespoons of sour cream. Vidalia or red onion will also work fine, as well as celery instead of red pepper. After several events, everyone who has tried this slaw gives compliments. Thank you.

Very sweet/tart.  Wonderful.  Left out the red pepper.   The dressing ingredients make the cabbage sweat so the volume of finished salad decreases by almost half when it's had time to chill.  Swims in a puddle of dressing.  The only change I would make is to allow time to drain it through a colandar before serving next time.

I wasn't too sure about fruit in a coleslaw never having one before, but it turned out fabulous! The only apples I had on hand were Honeycrisp, so I did cut down on the sugar in the recipe (by half) due to the sweetness of the apple and am glad I did, coleslaw should be a wee bit tart IMO! :) I did add some raisins for a garnish, overall, will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

not sure what i could've done wrong - or maybe i'm just used to a more savoury coleslaw - but this is waaaaay too sweet. essentially a dessert.  that's even with only 3 tbsp of sugar, supertart apples and xtra lemon juice. took forever to make, so am not feeling too cheery.
sorry - i really wanted to like this.

PERFECTION! The flavor is to die for. I didn't have the peppers or onions but wow, the best I have ever had. I really like the apples - they added so much. And it's best to let it sit and chill for at least an hour before serving. Yummers!! My husband said it was the best he has ever had. This recipe is a KEEPER!! I

So I guess I am going to be the bad guy here amongst all these raving reviews. First, I am a pretty darn good cook and second, I followed the recipe to the letter. I made this for a dinner held for a family after a funeral and I was a little embarrassed that everyone knew it was mine. Onion should not be in this recipe, just too much for the apples and  the brown sugar. I was terribly dissapointed. If I did something wrong I don't know what since I did not stray from what is written here. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

As far as coleslaw goes, this was good and pretty healthy too. I used low fat mayo and it tasted great! This was a crowd pleaser overall and I would make again to take to an outdoor party!

This is really excellent, easy and tastes very fresh. I've made this several times now, and I find I like it better with a bit less brown sugar and a bit more lemon. I also tend to use only one apple, but it's also lovely with two.

This recipe will be in my family for a long time.  It is, by far, my most favorite cole slaw.  Apples and cabbage together are sweet and crunchy perfection.  I have served this slaw to many different people who all agree it is a unique and delicious cole slaw. It is beautiful with color too.  A winner.

Terrific recipe.  I volunteered to bring slaw to a fried chicken dinner, and this sounded so much better than mayo and cabbage.  Everyone loved it.  This will be a permanent addition to my repertoire.

Had my doubts how this dressing would look on the salad after mixing in the brown sugar, but not to worry, it was fine.  Crunchy fresh cabbage, crisp apples, and a slightly sweet dressing resulted in a very nice salad.  Welcome change from the traditional tossed green salad that I eat most of the time.  Good way to welcome Fall, and I definitely will be making again.

Great recipe!  It's crunchy, sweet, and tangy!

Some changes/substitutions I made:
1. I used a bag of broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage, carrots, and red pepper.
2. I don't like my coleslaw mayonnaise heavy so I used a little less than 1/3 cup mayo and slightly less brown sugar.
3. Like other reviewers, I tossed the apples in lemon juice in addition to using lemon juice in the dressing.  I also added a handful of dried cranberries.
4. I used fresh lemon juice and also added so lemon zest, it made the slaw very light and refreshing!

This wasn't a favourite at our Thanksgiving table this year. My family just found it way too sweet to be coleslaw.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the apples - I used 3 small Mac's instead of what the recipe called for.  In the end, I tried to add a bit of mayo and some more lemon juice to take some of the sweetness out - but it was a lost cause.  If you're into a more 'savory' coleslaw (ie, mayo based), I'm afraid this isn't the one for you.

Definately better the second day.  I didn't use the green pepper because I don't like them, and it was still very tasty.  Even my sister who is very picky about coleslaw, loved it!!!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Some of the people loved it.  Some thought it was o.k.  You just can't please everyone all the time.  I thought it was very good.  Next time, I'll add extra dressing.

This is a great change from your standard slaw. I tried it with about a tablespoon of curry powder and that really kicked it up a notch. Try it if you like curry.

This was ok, there was something weird about the mayo and brown sugar.  I added lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.

This was very good.  The guests enjoyed it and my 5 year old daughter loved it.  I will say that it is NOT for traditionally cole slaw loving people.  As it is very sweet!  I served it to a Virginia man who was looking forward to some good slaw and he was a bit disappointed. However, I enjoyed it.

This recipe was very good and quick.  I cheated by using a bag of cole slaw mix and left out the onions and peppers. Next time I will try adding some celery also. Thanks for a great recipe.

This got good feedback on Easter Sunday.  I highly suggest reading the reviews AND choosing a flavor addition of your liking.  I made it as written and found I needed salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  Next time I will salt the coleslaw and add vinegar.

What a tasty slaw.  Nice change of pace.  Squirted lemon juice on apples after I chopped them (in addition to lemon in the dressing.)  Added salt and pepper too and a handful of chopped peanuts.  Serving tonight with burgers and brats.

I liked the mix of the cabbage and apple but the dressing is sickly sweet for veggies, it ruined the whole dish.  I may try the apple-cabbage mix with a more acid based dressing.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I skipped the red pepper and used apple cider vinegar in the dressing, only soaking the apples in actual lemon juice prior to putting everything together. If your or someone you love (i.e. my husband) don't like the heavier mayonaise-based cole slaws, this one will be a winner. We put it on top of pulled pork sandwiches, and it was just perfect!

This recipe was the hit of the party.  Paired with macaroni and cheese and crockpot honey ribs (also from allrecipes) was the perfect party menu.  I used bagged coleslay mix instead of the cabbage and carrots.  Cut the sugar in half and added a Tablespoon of redwine vinegar to the dressing.  Followed the recommendation of putting the apples in bag with lemon juice - 2 days later and no browning.  I also added dried cranberries.

This was very sweet so taste the dressing before applying!! It turned out ok with lots of adjustments tho. Made the day before, by the time we served it was looking a little dingy, apples slightly brown (I used lemon). Omitted onion & pepper, used bagged slaw mix, added crainraisins & cider vinegar. Vingegar was a good tip-thanks!

When my husband saw me making this he questioned the apples, but everyone who had this at our party enjoyed it and he has said I can make it again anytime.  I used a 16 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and carrots, left out the "additional" carrot, and followed the rest of the recipe.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't use all of the dressing.  I used maybe 20% of the dressing.  That was enough to give the salad some flavor but not oversaturate it.  The apple really compliments this.  I used extra lemon to taste.

Very good but time consuming. I will defiantly make this again for a party but it takes too much time to make for just me and my husband. 
I used fat free plain yogurt instead of mayo. Follow the advice of other reviewers and sprinkle salt on the cabbage and let sit to help "dry up" some of the extra liquid. Additionally, put lemon on the apples while cutting them to keep from turning brown. Still use the original amount of lemon for the dressing.

UPDATE: I wouldn't spend the time with adding salt to the cabbage to soak some of the water up. Just serve with a slotted spoon. Two days later, still eating it. Everything is still crisp. Very good and still looks great.

I thought this was great cole slaw.  I love the apples in it.  As a time saver, I just bought bags of cole slaw mix.  The cabbage is already shredded that way and there are already shredded carrots in it too.  I just threw out the dressing pack that comes with and followed the recipe.  I didn't use onions only because I forgot to buy them.  I didn't chop the apples till I was ready to add them to everything else.  I had no problems with them turning brown even after a couple days in the frig.

I really liked this cole slaw.  I made a couple of changes based on what I had and another review.  I subbed celery for the pepper and used a gala apple and a red delicious because that is what I had.  I omitted the green onion because I didn't have any, but next time I make this it will be included to give the salad that extra little zip.  Thanks for sharing this delcious alternative to the mayo-laden cole slaws.

This was very good! I tweaked it to fit my tastes. I omitted the onions and peppers. I added 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. I also used red cabbage. I highly recommend using the cheddar because its a nice contrast between the apples and the sweet dressing. This is a very unique and tasty cole slaw!

Great Cole Slaw - If you like it sweet and we do.  Actually, I used a crispin apple instead of the Granny Smith, so that may have added to the sweetness.  I also used miracle whip instead of mayo (my husband's preference).  The brown sugar did NOT make it look brown, I feared this but, it was all good -actually has an overall nice colorful appearance.  The only other change I made, is I added a can of crushed pineapple.  It just didn't seem like coleslaw without pineapple.  VERY GOOD recipe!

Excellent slaw.  I used red cabbage and mine looked drastically different but the taste was great.  It's a refreshing salad which cheered up a gray day in the middle of winter.  This would be a good summertime salad.  I was wary of the red pepper but it was fine in the salad.  The apple really added to the taste.  This would be great to bring to a pot luck.

Great cole slaw recipe! Different from  traditional cole slaw.  At first I wasn't sure about the dressing, but it was delicious!  No leftovers in our house. I will definitely make this again and maybe add some dried cranberries just to be different.  Thank you!

Nice for something different, but I wouldn't make it again.  It's quite good right when it's made, but the dressing seems to take over by the time it gets to the table and it's really too tired to eat the next day.

Super Yummy. Used just a little less brown sugar and a bit more lemon juice. I wouldn't imagine this would keep well, but who cares?  Give me a big bowl and a fork and I'll eat the whole dang thing - it's that good.

Interesting flavor.  Tastes of apple, cabbage and onion.  Good if you want something "different."  Only giving this a 3-star as we actually had enough leftovers to throw out and my hubby is a slaw-lover.

Fantastic!  I doubled this for a party and it was the first thing gone.  Many people asked for the recipie.  I subbed 1c of broccoli slaw for cabbage, added green and yellow peppers and more carrotts.  Very pretty and delicious!

This was too sweet for me, so I added an extra tbs of vinegar, and a couple more onions.  It definately got better as it sat, so I would recommend making it in the morning, or even the night before.  Next time I will just use less sugar, and not being a fan of apple peel, I will peel them next time.  That said, it's a definate keeper!

Scrumptious!  Everyone raved about this yummy twist on coleslaw.  Instead of the lemon juice I used 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I gave this  5 stars for the base of the sauce and how easy this I to make. I did not have all the ingredients, here's what I did different;
Used dole bagged coleslaw- already cut up and has the carrots in it.  I didn't use the green onion or red pepper. And I used cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice! Awesome!!! Will add sunflower seeds next time too!

I tried this recipe for the first time and absolutely loved it.  Because I love green onions I doubled that part of the recipe...otherwise everything was the same and this will now be my go to slaw recipe.  Such an interesting group of flavors...not the boring slaw that is often just a barely noticed part of a meal.

This recipe was just okay and a great base to start with but I would not serve this recipe without some adjustments. I left out the onion, and instead substituted toasted pecans and some raisins. The dressing is very sweet so I cut the sugar in half (adding the raisins also added sweetness). You can use mixed green and purple cabbage if you prefer, and it gives the slaw a really pretty color. The lemon juice is absolutely essential, and really brings the flavors all together.

We enjoyed this!  A little less sugar next time...a tad too sweet for us....but we enjoyed it.  It was light, refreshing and a good change from the usual old coleslaw.

I was a bit wary of the complexity of flavors, but I tried the recipe as written. Turned out delicious. I think the slaw sauce was key. I spiced it up with California Seasoning Salt (Pepper, salt, garlic, lemon zest). Using the freshest veggies also helps. The apples and mayo reminded me of Waldorf salad but so much better! I will use this recipe instead of the traditional Waldorf recipe. Oh yeah--one tip: make sure you toss apples in lemon juice before adding rest of ingredients. It'll prevent browning if your slaw is being stored for a few days. I paired this slaw with cayenne spiced tilapia.

One of the best coleslaws ever!  Didn't have any carrots and added a half teaspoon of poppy seeds.  What a wonderful recipe!  Could add pecans or walnuts or sunflower seeds, if desired.  My family loves this slaw and it doesn't require a speck of salt!  It's all good.  Thank you for a real keeper!

This was good but not great.  I found that the dressing lacked some "zip" so added about 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and just a dash of salt.  That seemed to do it.  Was a good salad for a potluck.

This was good and healthy!  Subbed 3 cups slaw mix for shredded cabbage, subbed 1/2 cup toasted almonds for carrots, and added 1 tsp. Apple Cider vinegar. Very pleasant, quick, crunchy and healthy. Kids didn't HATE it (that gives me hope) & hubs liked it (highly unusual response from him on my new creations...LOL ). I will make again, as it is nice for the hot Florida temps...give it a try...you will be happy to have a change!

This is a great change for cole slaw.  I left out the peppers and reduced the sugar but this was indeed refreshing.  For those who want it a bit tangy, add a splash of vinegar.

The guests at lunch thought this rocked, even though I cut the cabbage into hunks instead of strands.  The apple adds a surprising sweetness that the sparse dressing did not.  Try it.

We loved this recipe! I added sultanas and omitted red peppers, simply because I forgot to buy some... it was good after 2 hours and even better the day after. I used vegan mayo, which is amazing and cholesterol-friendly, enriched with ginger, and it complimented the other flavours. I may add that it looks pretty too!

I am SO surprised!  I got a head of cabbage in my CSA box and didn't know what to do with it.  I've never liked cole slaw, ever.  EVER.  But, I didn't want to waste it so I bit the bullet and picked a high-rated recipe, sure that I would end up throwing it out after tasting it.  I almost gave up when I was chopping the cabbage because it sure did smell nasty.  Anyway after I had put everything together, and tasted it, I could NOT believe it.  I actually enjoyed it!  Thank you for this recipe to help this first-time cabbage-try-er actually enjoy cabbage!  By the way, I followed some of the reviews and used lemon juice on the apples, added pecans & dried cranberries, and a little apple cider vinegar.

Made this with a group of friends, it was fun! Slaw is really refreshing and tasty! Only change I'd make is lessening the cabbage.  We only used 1 head and it was plenty (We scaled it up to serve 20)  Super easy and really good! Goes great with sloppy joes..

This makes a good slaw. I recommend adding a bit more mayo. Also, this makes a ton so only double this if you're feeding an army. I added some more jalapeno, some cilantro, tomato, and onion to the leftovers and it turned into a great pico de gallo!

Great recipe! Made it the first time to bring to a BBQ as a side dish; everyone raved about it which was surprising as the BBQ was great too. The dressing, which is so simple and doesn't sound good, nicely sets off the flavors and doesn't overpower. Definitely a winner!

Made this tonight using 2 Tbsp greek yogurt and 1 Tbsp mayo. I thought is was very refreshing and will definitely make again. I think next time I will use bagged coleslaw and add mandarin oranges.

UPDATE: MY NEIGHBOR SNEAKED A LITTLE LEFTOVER SLAW FOR HERSELF (HENCE I BROUGHT HOME AN EMPTY DISH). HER HUSBAND ENDED UP EATING HER "STASH" FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING HAHA! Yum! What a nice change of pace from the usual mayonnaise-laden coleslaw! My hubs and I were invited to a neighborhood cookout this past weekend. I took this as our "dish" to contribute and brought nothing home!!! As many others did, I too subbed a pre-packaged coleslaw mix for chopped cabbage. Because I wanted some color, I used equal parts coleslaw / shredded red cabbage. The packaged mix I purchased didn't have many carrots in it, so I added a couple generous handfuls of matchstick cut ones (found near the coleslaw in my grocers produce section). My final change was tossing my cut apples in a tiny bit of lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Although this turned out pretty well, I do regret not "sweating" my cabbage (the bulk of all vegetables are comprised mostly of water, ESPECIALLY cabbage, cucumber and eggplant). By the end of the evening, a considerable amount of liquid had collected in the bottom of my bowl and my red cabbage "bled" a bit (if that makes any sense...). NOTE: DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE BELL PEPPER OR GREEN ONION! Both add a bit of savory to this otherwise sweet dish and are FANTASTIC complements. Thanks SO much for sharing this unique, summer-appropriate recipe, Aunt Mamie! I'll be adding this to my recipe box for sure. :-)

I was skeptical about this because of the amount of brown sugar, but it was really good. I didn't use the red bell pepper. I liked it even better the next day!

I cut back on the brown sugar but only because our family never likes as much as a recipe calls for.  My husband and two year old loved it.  The four year old didn't like it at all and I thought it was good but needed pecans.  When the husband says five stars, though, I give five stars because he doesn't just hand those out to every recipe.

A good cole slaw.  Fresh, crisp. Very sweet. I used the packaged broccoli slaw. Will try adding a tsp of cider vinegar as other reviewers have done to cut the sweetness.  Great as a wrap as well as a salad.

This was DELICIOUS.  And refreshing, and crunchy, and just wonderful.  Used a little more cabbage because the dressing was sweet and went a long way, used prepackaged cabbage/carrot mix and left out the bell pepper as I am not a fan.  But other than that it was awesome, and everyone loved it.

Love this!  I was a little hesitant to make it and it turned out great.  I did use the bag slaw mix and Splenda brown sugar.  Also added craisins.  I will definitely make this again.

Very nice! I do think I would add a little cider vinegar maybe next time. I put some of the lemon juice in a bag and put my apples in that as I cut them.

The first time I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out very good. I did salt my cabbage first and let it sit but the bagged cabbage didn't lose any water. And I used part of the lemon juice to coat my apples so they wouldn't turn brown. 

When I made this the second time I used a bag of broccoli slaw and I liked the taste better. Plus I got the added benefit of more veggies. Great recipe will make this many more times. Thanks.

Yummy! I use miracle whip due to allergies, so I cut back on the sugar, increased the lemon juice a tad, and then added a sprinkle of coleman's mustard (This is my standard substitution). I had a few fresh radishes out of my garden that I also added. Thanks for a winning recipe! As it was I think I would cut the sugar just a bit more - maybe 1/3 of what's called for, but that's my personal preference.

I made this slaw for a Baby BBQ that I hosted for a close friend. It was the only dish that was empty after everyone finished eating. It was DELISH!! I have never been a cole-slaw fan, but this stuff is FINE... My husband and I have made it before and placed it on top of tiny pork loin sandwiches with sweet rolls. It's too easy not to try... I saved myself a lot of time by buying a 16 oz cole-slaw pack that was already mixed with carrots.

Very versatile.  I used red cabbage and left out the bell pepper.  I substituted two tablespoons of fat free miracle whip for the mayonnaise (barely enough to coat it), increased the lemon juice, and added salt and pepper (omitted the sugar).  The apples gave it a great flavor and extra crunch.

I basically used this recipe for the dressing because I like the broccoli slaw mixture that you can buy in the store.  The dressing was very tasty.  Sweet, creamy and tangy!  Just perfect.

Excellent! Very different from any cole slaw I've ever made. It IS sweet but just extremely tasty. As many others did, I added apple cider vinegar.

I just finished mixing this up to serve with pulled pork sands for Halloween dinner. It is really delicious! I made it exactly as instructed with two exceptions - By accident I used white sugar while mixing my dressing. I did not want to throw it out so I just added a tablespoon of molasses and walla - brown sugar! Also, I did add a tablespoon of cider vinegar to cut the sweetness a bit. I will definitely make this again. It's really a pretty coleslaw, too!

I made this with no red peppers but otherwise more or less as is.  I think I used more apple though and a tish more lemon.  Yum!  I think craisins might be good in it too but haven't played with it. Thanks for the nice and versatile recipe!

excellent recipe. I always come home with an empty bowl when I bring it to share! I did add a little apple cider vinegar to cut some of the sweetness, and used golden delicious apples. Yum!

It was very tasty! I did make one major change and that was using broccoli slaw mix (veggie only no sauce).  I continue with adding everything else.  I also made a few other minor changes adding lemon juice to apple after chopping.  Lastly I added a splash of balsamic vingar. Delish!

This I think is my new and forever favorite. I did not have any green onion so I used 1/4 cup of white. I also just grabbed 2 apples from the tree outside. I as well did what another rater did, I tossed the lemon juice over the apples first to prevent them from browning.

The secret to this slaw is fine shredded cabbage. Worth purchasing the $20 shredded from Walmart just for this! Also, I only used fuji apples instead of the combo. Very good. I made this for 250 people and served it with BBQed pulled pork sandwiches. It was a hit and people that said they did not like Cole slaw loved it. Thank you for sharing!

This coleslaw was different and quite refreshing.  I followed it exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I love the texture of the crisp apple and the sweetness that the red pepper adds.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Off the charts good! I fed 200 people this slaw recently and everyone was floored at how amazing it is - and it's really so very easy! The dressing makes it! I will say, though, that I will only dress this slaw the same day I'm serving it. I didn't care for it the day after. A+ recipe!!

I made this for an women's potluck and it passed with 5 stars!  Adult taste buds loved it!  My kids and kid-like husband could taste the green onion and didn't care for it.  I will definitely make it again for the family, but 1/2 the green onion.

YUM! Thanks to another reviewer, I added FF plain yogurt to the dressing and less mayo. I also used less brown sugar and more lemon, cider vinegar so it wasn't quite as sweet. I added cilantro to the salad. I pretty much doubled the dressing which worked out well because we liked it so much that I added more cabbage and apple to it and we had it the next day! A keeper!

This is a prime recipe!! I made a 30 serving recipe at a church retreat and it got rave reviews.  I had made it for my family earlier and they loved it also!  The only change I made was toreduce the amount of brown sugar.  Just a little too sweet with the amount listed.  i started with half and added to taste.  didn't take too much more. I will make it again!

This was a tad sweet for me, so I would probably use less sugar next time. I also like the idea of adding apple cider vinegar, although I didn't think of that because I didn't read the reviews first. I used red cabbage, one huge braeburn apple, and left out the green onions, as I didn't have any. The salad is really pretty, although the dressing turned a little pink due to the red cabbage. I would definitely make this again with a little tweaking.

This is like a cross between cole slaw and waldorf salad.  I left out the onion and bell pepper (didn't have any on hand)and substituted lime juice instead of lemon.  Really delicious.  I also added some pecans and poppy seeds.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had to adjust this recipe because I did not have all the ingredients in the house. Basically I used the cabbage, apples, onions, miracle whip and brown sugar (reduced amount due to sweetness of miracle whip). It was fantastic! This is the  only coleslaw recipe I will use in the future. Can't wait to see how it turns out when I use all the ingredients. Thank you for the recipe!

Made this for a Memorial Day BBQ to go along side w/ ribs ---an excellent switch up to the usual slaw!  I used equal amounts of green and sweet vidalia onion.  I also sprinkled apples w/ a little lemon juice to prevent browning and added about 1/2-3/4 cup of sunflower seeds.  I used 1 1/2 times amount for the mayo mixture.  Not dry or too much liquid.   I loved the crunchiness from the apples and onion and sunflower seeds.  One of the best slaws I've ever had!  Everyone loved it!

Didn't change the recipe at all and it was great.  The sweetness of the dressing and the addition of the apples was a great change from the usual.

Wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I left out the bell pepper (I don't like bell pepper), & I used light mayo. It turned out absolutely delicious! I was a little bit skeptical about leaving the peel on the apples, but after the apples were chopped up in the slaw, the peels just added a little extra crunch and color. I used a food processor to chop all the vegetables and apples, which made the pieces very finely chopped, but I think this recipe would be equally good with larger, chunkier pieces. This is a recipe that I will definitely make again!

I was skeptical of this because of the red pepper, but it was wonderful!  I made if for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it.  I have since incorporated a lot of the ingredients and modified to make my own cole slaw.

This was only good after sitting in the fridge over night.  But I'm not a big mayo fan so I think mayo and apples just dosent do it for me.

This coleslaw was very tasty. I didn't have a green apple so I just used red and it still turned out great!

Fantastic!  I'm not a big slaw fan, but had purchased the "cutest" little head of cabbage and needed to use it.  I chose this recipe simply because the ingredients matched my fridge findings.  Oh yum! With the crisp, sweet apples in the cole slaw, I am a convert.

I have some neighbors that we potluck with often.  ALL this slaw was devoured, and we usually don't finish anyone's dish (I guess we all make too much).  I didn't have cabbage so I used a bag of that broccoli slaw.  I mistakenly put in a bit too much brown sugar, but everyone liked it so I will do it that way again.

I found the combination of apple, pepper and scallion with the cabbage was quite effective and fresh tasting -- I read that some reviewers did not care for this combination, but I would encourage you to give it a try .

After reading the  other reviews, and consulting other slaw dressing recipes, I decreased the sugar to 2 tbsp and the slaw was PLENTY sweet. Given that brown sugar has its own assertive flavor on top of the sweetness, I believe the amount of sugar called for in the recipe would really overwhelm the salad to the point of ruin. I would like to rate this recipe higher: it was actually a nice side dish when made with significantly less sugar than called for. If I have reason to make it again, I'll probably go with just one tablespoon of sugar.

This is a pretty good coleslaw.  I like the addition of bell peppers and apples.  I'm thinking about adding a fresh jalapeno next time.  We'll see.  I did cut the sugar in half and this was still plenty sweet.  That is my excuse for only giving the recipe 4 stars.  Way too much sugar.
I used this with some shredded beef to make tacos today.  It was very good.  I did cut the sugar again.  I also added a few dashes of Chipotle Tabasco and a jalapeno.

just made this and we thought it was wonderful. As others did I tossed cut apples in with lemon juice then mixed into rest of cabbage mixture. Also used a bit less mayo than asked for, halved brown sugar,  and added a tablespoon  or two of cider vinegar ( to taste) . Awesome side dish!

I made this using Hellmann's Balsamic Mayonnaise and a couple teaspoons of vinegar and it was amaaaaaazing. This was a huge hit, and I think the Balsamic mayo along with the tartness of the apples made the dish. Note: It probably made more like 8 servings.

YUMMY!  After chopping the apples, mixed them with 2 TBSP lemon juice (prevents browning) and did not add any more to dressing.  May reduce brown sugar next time as we found it a little sweet

This was so quick and easy. I did add dried cranberries and celery seed to the mix as well. With the fresh picked apples of the fall this was a hit with my husband and myself. I will be sharing this recipe with my daughters!!'

I have made a similar coleslaw for many years but I always use apple cider vinegar in the dressing. I never use green peppers - they tend to overwhelm the apple taste.  And I use red onion.

This was super simple and easy to improvise.  I made it with white onions and apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice because it's what I had on hand, and it still turned out great!  Next time I think I'll do less onion, but it's a tasty recipe.

Thought this was really good... Liked the addition of brown sugar rather than white... All it needed was some salt and pepper to taste!  Was perfect with my Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwiches and cajun french fries last night!

Good and easy.  I used less green onions because it seemed like alot.  I rinsed my apples in lemon water first.  Still good enough to eat 3 days later.

I tried this recipe and my fiancé loved it.  He's not big on salads but asked me to fix this salad more often.  I did not include bell pepper or an onion.  I forgot them when I went grocery shopping.  I used vinegar instead of lemon juice and the salad was refreshing.

I made this for a Memorial Day party and it went over very well.  Like others, I added dried cranberries and sliced almonds to the top of the salad as well as seedless red grapes for color.  I also added some fresh cutup oranges and that was great too!  I did not add the onions or pepper.

Good simple recipe, I think I will try with less cabbage (1/2 as much) and more apple (1.5-2 times as much) next time. The dressing seemed perfect.

I liked this recipe alot , the only thing I changed was that I omited the green onion and red pepper,  and instead added 1/3 red onion and extra lemon  and used agave syrup instead of brown sugar. It was sweet and crunchy and savoury all at once! I tried this recipe with walnuts and it was delicious as well!

A very nice variation on the traditional cole slaws, sweet and just a tiny bit of tang offset by the onion. Delish!

Phenomenal!!!  I was looking for an alternative to regular coleslaw and this was a winner.  So crisp, sweet, fresh - everyone loved it and requested the recipe.  I have an egg-allergy son so I actually subbed egg-free mayonaise for the regular mayo but it didn't make a difference.  Will be in our summer recipe file for sure.

This turned out great, and I've used it several times already.  A nice change from the typical coleslaw.  I omitted the onion and it was still great.

Fabulous, won't make regular creamy coleslaw again unless for over hot dogs & hamburgers.  Didn't have green onion so used a little red onion & did make things even easier by using a bag of coleslaw instead of purchasing everything.  I like Kraft Coleslaw dressing & had that on hand so used it instead.  The crunch of the apples & the color of the pepper & red onion made it appealing.

Just different enough to be special--followed the directions and other advice and added lemon juice to the apples before I added them to the salad to prevent browning. Omitted green onions because we didn't have any--still fabulous. Thanks!

I have made this cole slaw more times than I can count.  I add toasted sunflower seeds and sometimes substitute blueberries for apples, both ways are delicious.  I love the mix of sweetness and crunch.  Thank you!

This is a recipe you can trust.  I made it for 22 people and everyone raved.  I didn't make any changes.  I would suggest making it a few hours ahead to help blend the flavors.  Before serving you can drain a little of the extra juices but don't drain them all because I had people who wanted it sloppy!

My husband loved it, but I ran out of brown sugar and used white sugar, plus Japanese mayo.

Awesome...Everyone at our last BBQ loved this recipe. The only big change I made was adding pomegranate infused red wine vinegar. It played nicely with the apples. Love it!

I made this recipe for our company 4th of July picnic and it was a huge hit.  i did change the recipe though, I added crushed pineapple, as many different apples as i could find and shredded carrots.  in fact I probably took three different recipes and added them all together.  That is the great thing about coleslaw, its so varying.  i didn't add any sugar, figured the apples and the pineapple covered that... but I made a huge turkey pan full and it was completely gone by the end of hte picnic...

This is a favorite at my house.  It's nice because I normally have all the ingredients, and for some reason this really seems to fit the bill for cravings that I have for something like this sometimes.  Like others have said, I coat the apples with the lemon juice to stop them from browning.  This is such a quick and easy recipe!

This recipe was not very good.  Other reviewers thought it was great, so I wonder what I did wrong.  The bell pepper and onion flavors did not seem to blend well with the sweet dressing and apple flavors.  The dressing pulled a lot of water out of the cabbage, leaving the slaw in two parts:  watery liquid and solid.  I was disappointed and a little uneasy about taking it to the neighbor's house for supper.  I was thanked, but the only comment made was, "It's refreshing." No one uttered any other descriptive word.  No one asked for the recipe.  No one wanted the leftovers, either (I usually don't have leftovers at our neighborhood gatherings).  Overall, this recipe was a disappointment.

Yikes - sweet (!);  just made and am hoping sweetness from brown sugar will dissipate a bit once the other flavors have a chance to marry ... I'm surprised the tartness of the GS apple isn't coming through more.  Will re-review once it's been fridged for a while.  UPDATE: As written, giving this a 4 - had to tone down with more cabbage and some white wine vinegar, but (as hoped), the flavors really did mellow out nicely.  Threw in a little pineapple and ended up quite pleased.  TY so much for recipe.

I mixed the chopped apple with lemon juice prior to adding it to the salad. I also skip chopping up the cabbage and carrot and just pour in a 12oz bag of broccoli cole slaw since we make this so often. The flavors and textures are very nice in this dish and it compliments a wide variety of meals. Best the second day.

I made this for Easter Dinner today and just tasted it after standing overnight. I did add some extra Savoy cabbage to it and added a little more mayo.  Let me tell you, I am not a cole slaw lover, but this is just wonderful.  I can't wait for my guests to try it.   Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

this was easy and yummy. i used celery instead of bell pepper (didnt have any) and really liked the apple/celery combo so i would recommend adding it in. i also used white vinegar instead of lemon juice and it worked fine. after i combined the cut up veggies and fruit i placed the mixture in a strainer to drain the excess water and sprinkled it with  some vinegar to prevent the apples from browning. even though i drained some of the excess liquid i should have started it earlier because it was a bit runny for my taste. this was very good with french fries, baked beans, and bbq pulled pork  sandwiches.

I don't like traditional coleslaw but this is very good!  I made this as directed except for two small changes: (1) left out the onions (don't care for them) and (2) squeezed a tablespoon of lemon juice over the apples to prevent them from browning.  I'm sure the leftovers will be even better.

This was very good.  I used bagged cole slaw mix.  Also put the chopped apples in a bowl with lemon juice as I was chopping them.  I was afraid that there was not enough dressing and added another half a batch.  After sitting, this turns out to have been a mistake.  Next time I will make just as written.

Nobody in my household likes slaw except for my husband, but something about the sweet/tart combo here makes the kids forget that they're eating cabbage.  Definitely my go-to slaw.

I made this with roast pork, I had so many compliments. To make it even easier I bought the ready made cloeslaw in the bag, and added apple cider vineger, and red onion as well.

Wow!  This is great cole slaw!  The changes I made were minor.  I used a bag of shredded cabbage/cole slaw, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular brown sugar.  Served it to company and they loved it too.  Even better after sitting for a day or two.  Thanks for this recipe.  Will make it again and again!

I've made this several times and it is delicious!  It doesn't keep, even over night, but that's usually not a problem because it gets gobbled up.  I've also substituted fat free mayo and reduced the amount of sugar but it is best with the original recipe.

I made this exactly as written (though I used pre-chopped cabbage/carrot mix), and it was delicious!! This will definitely be thrown into regular rotation.

As-is, this recipe leaves the cole slaw quite dry. I like it that way. If you like your slaw soggy, you should double the mayo and lemon juice!

This was delicious and very easy to make with coleslaw mix instead of chopping cabbage and shredding carrots. Left out the red pepper as I had red pepper in another part of the meal. Halved the sugar and added about a tbsp of buttermilk to stretch the dressing further. It was beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. Who could ask for anything more? Thanks!

This is very good and easy to put together.  The only change it really needs is added cider vinegar. Without it there's really not much flavor.  Delicious.

I made this for a party. I doubled it and I also used packaged cabbage. I also used Walla Walla sweet onions. I made the night before and it was wonderful. None left!! Mine was not watery at all. Some liquid but it was thicker than water. So yummy, will make again. Great salad!!!

This was a hit at my parents on Fathers Day.  Very refreshing and light dressing. Normally I leave out the onion and pepper but this time I didn't and the flavors blended so well that those two ingredients did not stand out so prominent. Make sure you salt the cabbage and let it drain because there will be plenty of liquid after you mix it.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled it, using a whole head of cabbage, 4 apples, 2 julienned carrots and the red bell pepper diced. I forgot to buy the onion.  Almost doubled the dressing.  After letting it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.....OMG!  My boyfriend, who is not a regular salad eater, will eat this for days and days.  Next time, I will try the lower calorie variations, i.e. yogurt for mayo, less sugar, etc.  But this is a timeless summer recipe.

What a great refreshing slaw recipe.  Instead of chopping my apples and carrot, I julienned them.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of sugar.  I also added some raisins.  I waited to dress the slaw just before serving to reduce that "watery" consistency it sometimes gets.  I served this along side Apple/Maple Turkey burgers and Sweet Potato Fries.  What a wonderful meal. I will definately make this again.

I made this to bring to Mom's for Mother's day and it was very well received. I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, used only 1 green onion and added 1TBS. of apple cider vinegar.I also added a sprinkle of poppy seeds and 1/4 c. of dried cranberries. This will be a regular staple in my menu planning.  Thank you.

This slaw was soooo good! I also left out the bell pepper since I didn't have any on hand. I didn't miss it at all. The texture and crunch were perfect. I did add a TBS of cider vinegar to counter the sweet of the brown sugar. Other then that I followed the recipe and was amazed at the results!

This was really yummy! I used two honeycrisp apples, as that is what I had on hand. I also did as another poster suggested and tossed the chopped apples in the lemon juice to keep them from browning. I will try adding a dash of cider vinegar next time to give a little tartness.

I added cranberries and toasted walnuts as suggested by others, but I tasted it before doing so.  Pretty bland before (though I liked the dressing) and better with the additions. Decent and different, but I probably won't make again.

Loved it with my BBQ Pork for Sandwiches found on this site. Hubby doesn't do onions and I didn't have the bell pepper. Still yummy! Will try slivered almonds when I have them next time.

This was delicious!  I am not normally a huge fan of cole slaw, but this was so incredibly tasty!  My husband loved it too!  I think next time I might try it with a little vinegar (although I personally like the sweetness as it is) or with a little less dressing.  I love that it doesn't use a ton of mayo like many cole slaws.

Good!!! We didn't use the red pepper. And we added 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and some chopped walnuts as others had suggested. We also did not use a regular red delicious apple, but that's a minor adjustment.

My family loves cole slaw and I enjoy trying the many different varieties of this classic salad. This is a great sweet slaw. I love the original recipe but I have also made this one adding sliced grapes and chopped walnuts. I usually leave out the green pepper for this variation. It ends up like a Waldorf salad/cole slaw... really good!

This is an interesting twist on cole slaw. It has a little extra crunch from the apples. We liked the sweetness of the brown sugar. Give this one a try for something a little drifferent.

This was the BEST! I have never made cole slaw before so I picked a few of the recipes and made scaled down versions of them for a fish fry we had and by far this was my and everyone elses favorite. This was the only one that was completely gone before the night was through. I even had a chef who attended the fry ask for the recipe so she could make it for her family. It was GREAT!!

This was very good. Sweet just how I like it.  I changed it up just a tad though because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used a 16oz bag of ready made cole slaw and added one fuji apple.  I mixed 1/3c of light mayo with 1/3c of brown sugar and a tablespoon of apple cider vinager.  It's yummy.

I made this for a football tailgate with 25 people and it was a huge hit.  I made it the night before and then the next morning drained off the excess liquid and it tasted great.  It was very easy to make and I highly recommend it!

This is _the_ best slaw I've ever had. It's nicely balanced in that sweet/tangy way, with the finish of a creamy mouth feel without being overly mayonnaise-y. The sweet crunch of the apples is a nice bonus alongside the crunchy cabbage.

I did make a couple of changes, from necessity: I used the juice of one lime and about 4 T rice vinegar, because I'm out of lemons. (I suspect apple cider vinegar would have made a fine substitute, if I'd had any.) I used about 1/4 c. finely minced Vidalia onions instead of the green onions. And, I left out the pepper because I'm out of that, too; but I will be trying it next time. I also tossed the apples in the lime juice before mixing them in, as another reviewer suggested. 

This is going to be my standard recipe from now on.

We are not fans of bell peppers, so I left them out which did not make a difference to us.  I served this with the Reuben Sandwich recipe from this site and it was really good.  Great for a quick and easy meal.

Very nice change of pace.  I used pineapple in place of the apples as I was trying to replicate a favorite slaw that is store bought.  I added some pineapple juice to the dressing mixture as well. Will make this one again, and plan to using the apples!  Thank you!

I have been looking for a recipe that tasted like the expensive coleslaw we buy from the turkey deli. Well, this one fits the bill!  My husband just loved it and told me not to misplace this recipe.

I used a bag of broccoli slaw and added the apples and the dressing. This was delicious. We had guests for dinner and we were scraping the bowl. So easy and flavorfull.

This slaw is phenomenal! I'm not typically into sweet slaws, but this one doesn't over-do it, doesn't make it taste like candy. Fresh, crunchy, and the flavors just meld perfectly. Will DEFINITELY be making again and again!

This was a completely new recipe idea for me -- I had never heard of Apple Coleslaw -- but it sounded good. I made it to take to a lunch date with a friend, and was just delighted with the blend of the various flavors, and the dressing was  a perfect fit! My friend also loved it, and I left some for her to enjoy later.  Now I have a new addition to my "take-along" recipes!!

Such an unusual coleslaw.  Perfect as is, and also easy to adjust for personal tastes.  I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar for a bit of tart. I also serve toasted almonds on the side for those who want the nut crunch. Such a good recipe. Would be awesome on a spicy pulled pork or pulled chicken sandwich!

Great change for a coleslaw recipe.  Also a great way to use up veggies and apples, I added a handful of dried cranberries and a pinch of celery seed. I omitted peppers, just because I am not fond of the taste of raw bell peppers in coleslaw.

Delicious! Had some Red apples in the fridge. I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, so I substituted some Honey. I also  cut my apples and let them sit in the lemon juice so they didn’t brown while I made the rest! Soo Yummy!

This was really a wonderful salad for our Thanksgiving table.  It was fresh and crisp and the dressing was just the right balance lending it a maple flavor.  I made sure I put lemon juice on all the apples to keep them from browning. and in the spirit of Thanksgiving I included pecans as a wonderful fall flavour.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe--- everyone absolutely loved it!

This is a favorite every time I make it.  I don't even measure anymore, but always add some salt and coarse ground pepper.  This is refreshing.  I also don't add quite as much sugar as it calls for.

This is the second time I made this coleslaw. The first time everybody raved and asked for recipe! I am making pork sliders and thought of this apple slaw. I made it according to original, using yellow bell pepper for sweetness and different color. I added 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for more acid to cut the sweetness.  Awesome!

Definitely will make it again! I put doubled the lemon juice and put it over the sliced apples before combining them with the slaw and they were still not brown 3 days later and the slaw was delicious. I used angle hair slaw and added 2 bags with other other ingredients the same. Next time I will try regular shredded cabbage mix.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well. It had a little too much bell pepper for both my husband and myself and I thought the dressing was a tad on the sweet side. Next time I will only use 1/2 of the bell pepper, cut back on the brown sugar (maybe 1/4 cup), and use salt to get some of the water out of the veggies before assembling the slaw as it did get rather watery the day after I made it. This is a good base recipe to start and I will just play with the dressing to make it more to my liking.

I changed from the red bell pepper to the smaller peppers and used one red, one orange and one yellow.  The colors popped and it was a great hit at my Mother's Day luncheon!  Delicious dish.

Delicious. Made it as is; it was crunchy and the apples added a fun sweetness. I’d accompanied a summer grill out. It also made a TON of salad so I’d cut the recipe in half next time for only 4 adults

It was a hit.  My son will now eat cole slaw.
I didn't bother with the red pepper or green onions (didn't have them in the house), but I threw in some cranberries and slivered almonds, and added some bacon pieces to the leftovers to change it up a bit for the next day.

I love this slaw!  It's even better the next day.  It's a colorful addition to a buffet and everyone seems to like it.  I did use less
sugar than called for.

Very good.  I was surprised even my picky husband ate it as well as my son.  I switched out red peppers for yellow (red gives me heartburn) and my son was a bit surprised as I rarely has tried peppers but still ate it!

The first time I made this I changed the brown sugar to maple syrup. It was awesome!
The second time I made it I was out of grannie smith apples so I used 2 fuji apples and added raisins. It was just as good! Love this recipe!

I found the dressing a little sweet for my tastes, but the rest of the ingredients were perfect.  Although I made a few of my own modifications, 1 tbsp ea. Dijon, cider vinegar then salt/pepper to taste, make this recipe as the author intended.  Everyone loved it and most important, it’s almost a 5 star recipe!

Apple coleslaw was a big hit over Memorial Day w/e!  I should have either shaved the cabbage finer or diced it ( the scallions ) added a sassy punch everyone loved  this sweet/sassy dressing!

Outstanding easy recipe! Used bagged shredded coleslaw mix, then followed recipe. Added additional cider vinegar , 1/4 tsp celery seeds, and seasoned salt to taste to the dressing. Mixed really well. Let it sit covered in refrigerator for a couple of hours. Topped with freshly toasted almond slices.... SPOT ON! Very very good!

This was “pretty good”.  I should have read the reviews first.  It is a bit too sweet and I used Splenda Brown sugar blend and only 2.5 Tablespoons.  I like red bell pepper and green onions.  When I serve this I will add salt and pepper.

Quick and easy to prep. Left out pepper and onion, added dried cranberries. Used juice from 1 lemon - 1/2 went into dressing and 1/2 on apples to prevent browning. Made 3 hrs before serving. Hubby really enjoyed it and has asked me to keep the recipe for the future

This salad was excellent. I increased the lemon in the dressing, added more apple, and topped with pomegranate and walnuts. Also tried sprinkling with cinnamon the next day and it was very nice!

Nice, cool and crisp with a creamy dressing. Served it with the Blackened Salmon Fillets from this site and it was the perfect balance to the hot and spicy fish.

Very good!  Changed the preparation steps as follows:  Made dressing first in a measuring cup for easy measuring, less cleanup, and so sugar could dissolve while preparing the rest of the salad; chopped apples and tossed in 2 Tbs. of lemon juice in large bowl; then chopped and added rest of vegetables to bowl and tossed with the dressing.   Added 1 Tbs. of apple cider vinegar to dressing in addition to the 1 Tbs. of lemon juice called for, but will use white wine vinegar next time.  Will also use granulated sugar next time.  While this was a colorful, tasty salad, I felt the brownness from the dressing gave it an unappetizing look and detracted from its beautiful color.  The white sugar and clear vinegar will solve this problem next time.  Will make again.  Prepared with coleslaw mix to make it easy.

Left out the onions.  It tasted a bit on the sweet side and not as creamy as normal coleslaw.  It was okay for something different, but not my favorite thing.

This is good, although when I added lemon juice to taste it ended up being a lot of lemon juice.  I think this needs a touch of heat, so next time I'll add a minced, seeded chili, or maybe swap in some radish for the green onions.

Crunchy, tasty and healthy, especially if you use low fat mayo in the dressing. I will make this again and share with others.

Made the salad as per directions but ended up adding some apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper to temper the sweetness otherwise too sweet in my opinion but great base to work with!

This is a good basic recipe. I did improvise a bit. I had only half a head of cabbage and so I just used half of everything else. I didn't have green onions so I used half a red onion, which was very nice. MashaAllah  I made my own mayo and I decided to add walnuts. With these few changes the recipe reminded me of my mothers back in the day. Alhamdullilah It was a big hit with my wonderful husband! MashaAllah!

One of my favorite slaw recipes!  If you don't put in the onions and the red pepper, you're missing out!  People have different preferences regarding the sweetness so add a little brown sugar at a time to the dressing and get it to your taste.  The only thing I did differently was - I sprinkled the chopped apples with "Fruit Fresh" so they were sure not to turn brown.  (This is in addition to the lemon juice).  Even better the second day!!

I love this recipe it has restaurant-quality I will make it over and over again.  I really recommend this recipe to anyone.  I added about an eighth of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper for some heat.  This is the best coleslaw  I ever had and I've never had apples in coleslaw before.

This was excellent.  I've now made it twice in the past two weeks.  I followed the recipe, only omitting the peppers because of an allergy.  I used two honeycrisp apples, because those are my favorite and always on hand.  I wanted to stick to the recipe as much as possible to judge for myself on any changes, but based on reviews and not being a fan of too sweet, I just used a light hand on the brown sugar and a heavy hand on the mayo.  I also squeezed lemon juice on the vegetables before tossing, then also added the lemon juice to the dressing the first time. I was out of lemons and low on juice the second time.  I have to say, I preferred it with the extra lemon juice.  Excellent. As a non-meat eater with lots of food allergies, this will be a keeper for me.  Thank you!

I'm not a coleslaw fan but this looked intriguing and I needed something to use up a half-head of cabbage.  I didn't have a Granny Smith apple so I just used two Gala apples. I used about twice the lemon juice called for because the dressing was too sweet for our taste. I added a dash of salt, which I think enhanced the other flavors. This makes a beautiful slaw.

I used a bag of coleslaw in place of the cabbage and carrots. Used light mayo and added raisins and craisins. Love it, will definitely make it for company and pot lucks. My 6 yr old asked for seconds, which says A LOT! 
Update: I made it for a superbowl party and it was a hit. I even increased the veggies but not the dressing.

Definitely a keeper and I've made it more than once now. I've also used it on other veggie salads, too but my first choice is for this exact recipe, made as-is.  Thanks for a terrific recipe. *Update* May 2017. I have made this numerous times and recently, started using bagged slaw sold at the market for easy prep. That takes 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, 1 T. lemon juice, 2 T. brown sugar. I leave the rest of the ingredients the same. When first mixed, it doesn't look wet enough but the cabbage, apples, etc. weep and it's fine.

I received lots of compliments when I made this for a large family gathering.  I used my food processor and it was quick.  I omitted carrots (I was roasting heirloom carrots, so I didn't want to include more), used both green and red cabbage, and added half a small cooking onion, also sliced in the food processor.  I used homemade mayo and brown sugar splenda, along with the lemon juice for the dressing. It was wonderfully sweet, and tangy.

I loved this recipe that hearken's back to my childhood. I've made this recipe with tender Napa Cabbage which is great for those that have a bit of trouble digesting regular green cabbage. It turned out beautifully. I added about a tsp. of caraway seeds and a generous tbsp. of liquid honey instead of the brown sugar mixed with the mayo. I cannot eat onions so substituted shredded fennel and the grated zest of a lime. I used the juice of 1/2 a lime instead of lemon. Making again today with green cabbage and adding 1/4 cup of raisins garnished with walnuts.

For a cole slaw, this deserves five stars.  I loved the crunchy ingredients, they blended well together taste wise.  If you're doubling the dressing, it will be sweeter than you probably want.  Measured out all the chopped ingredients and the dressing amount was just about perfect.

I was wary of the ingredients in the dressing for this recipe but I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful.  I couldn't imagine that brown sugar and mayo would be good together but there truly were.  I have to say it was better the day it was made than it was a day or two later.  I have decided the next time I make it (and there will be a next time soon) I am going to keep the cabbage, onion, and pepper separate from the apples and dressing and mix them together the morning of the day I want to have it for lunch or maybe mix it at lunch time at work just before eating it.  It's such a wonderful combination of flavors.  I doubled the dressing the first time because it seemed dry but it turned out way over dressed so I will not double it the next time because I had a lot of liquid sitting in the bottom of the bowl and it would have been better without that.

Oh yeah, this is good! My husband liked it very much. I will decrease the amount of brown sugar and I did take the advice about making the dressing first and let set it stand, so the brown sugar would desolve, while putting the slaw together. Of course I did as many others and used the prepaged slaw mix, sliced walnuts and dried cranberries. I definitely will make again!

This was not really to my taste. I did like the inclusion of apple, but I left out half of the sugar and still found it too sweet.

I am not a big personal fan of slaw but I love this recipe and have made it several times now. I did make some changes due to my personal tastes. I am kinda picky. I used the bagged tri color slaw. It works good and saves time on prep for the cabbage and carrots. I also julienned the apples to follow along with the shape of the cabbage and carrots. I omitted the bell peppers since I do not favor them and only used the green onion as a garnish. I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and garnished with dried cranberries. They add a very nice touch. I also stirred it up once an hour for the first few hours before serving. For the best flavor, let it set in the fridge at least 4 hours. Its a great side dish for bbqs and potlucks, tastes great and keeps well. I have yet to have left overs.  It has been made a permanent recipe in my files.

I needed a quick salad, so used a bag of already chopped cole slaw mix with carrots. Saved time and was very tasty. It's my "go to" for potlucks.

It tastes great!  I think the nutrition info might be off a tad.  I got 11  half cup servings instead of six, which would dramatically decrease the carbs and calories.  I even did 1/4c sugar instead of the 1/3.  It's still very sweet and I think next time I will do even less.

Fantastic! My small tweaks were 1/2 the sugar and I didn't peel the apples. It was plenty sweet. I also added sunflower seeds right before serving. Soo good.

Made it without the pepper but otherwise exactly like the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  If you like a creamier coleslaw make double the dressing but I thought it was great the way it was.

Very good, though it won't keep for more than a couple days.  I followed others' advice and added a little vinegar.  However, Balsamic was not the way to go, for while it was sweet and tasty, it quickly tainted everything a shade of brown.

SO GOOD!  However, I would have rather had more precise quantity measurements for the apples, carrots and onions.  I think I used a total of 1½ to 2 c. apples, ½ c. carrot and ¼ to ? c. green onion, though, and absolutely LOVE this recipe and so did my guests.  It's a keeper - wouldn't change a thing from here on out and will make it over and over.  Thanks so much for sharing it.

My husband is a cole slaw snob, but he loved this cole slaw recipe.  I made it as written except I took a few hints from other reviewers.  I tossed the apples in the lemon juice to prevent premature browning of the apples.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of sunflower seeds to add a bit of crunch.  And I also used some premade cole slaw from a bag and added some carrots.  I will make this again.

This is a keeper.  I doubled the dressing and added more cabbage.  It was so refreshing.  I also put 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 Splenda to cut back on calories.  It is scrumptious.

I used this recipe as a basis for a work pot luck. I simply used a bag of coleslaw, apples (golden & red delicious & granny smith) a little salt & pepper and top with strawberry salad dressing (that gave it more flavor) wish I had let it sit overnight to sort of marinate the flavors

This was delish!  I didn't measure a thing, just put ingredients in until it tasted the way I wanted it to!  I used Agave syrup instead of brown sugar, worked great.  I also mixed broccoli slaw into it, gave it more crunch.

Didn't have the green onion or pepper so substituted 2 ribs of celery and put sliced vegetables and apples in food processor with dressing ingredients processed redistributed ingredients and reprocessed again for a finely chopped easy coleslaw. Incredibly good!

Just made this!!  Came out awsome.  Used garden fresh cabbage and apples.  Amped it up on the apples for extra sweetnss.  Although if it wasnt fot the parsley I added and the pepper add it might need some extra color.

I omitted the bell pepper and green onion because my kids don't like it, and it was very good. My 4 year old ate 2 servings. :)

This is a great recipe.  Took other reviewers advice with removing some of the liquid from the cabbage so that it wasn't so watery as well as adding lemon to the apples so they didn't brown.  It came out great, even better the 2nd day when all the flavors had time to blend.  

Paired it with Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from All Recipes and it was a great combination of sweet and spicy.

Nice change from the norm! Started with a bag of cole slaw mix (had the carrot in it), used small green bell pepper, diced purple onion, added extra lemon juice and threw in a handful of roasted & salted sunflower seeds.

My husband, who doesn't care for cole slaw, actually ate this one and said he liked it!  Of course, my grandsons both loved it!  It was really tasty, a lot of fresh flavors.  I didn't like the use of so much brown sugar in the dressing, so I think the next time I will cut that down considerably.

This was excellent!  And very easy with a pre-shredded bag.  I put this together while at a cabin with limited supplies.  Next time, I'll try it with Granny Smith and might like it even better!

Just made this.  My husband was blown away.  At las,t a new cole slaw recipe that really is good. I did use 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 mayo.  I'm thinking any root vegetable or hard fruit would work.

My family loves this recipe.  I also love reading all of the comments and will defintiely try the salt on the cabbage and soaking the apples in lemon water.  The only thing I add is a generous sprinkling of celery sede to add dimension to the flavor.  

Thanks Aunt mamie for giving me a new recipe to add to the family favorites!

As far as cole slaw goes, this is a pretty traditional slaw, minus the brown sugar.  I left it out because I don't like sweet slaws.  I followed the directions, other than that.  Enjoyed the addition of apple and red bell.  Will make again.

Never liked Cole slaw until I tried this recipe. Taste fabulous. Only thing I changed was to add a little more lemon in the dressing and I had some parsnip left over that I added.

I almost always stick to the exact recipe the first time I try it. The only time I do not is if there is an ingredient I do not care for. When I decided to make this, I did not realize I was out of some key ingredients. I made it anyway making adjustments. I used a coleslaw mix and omitted the carrot. I did not have any bell peppers, green onions, granny smith apples, or mayo. So...I chopped two tablespoons of yellow onion, used a stalk of celery, and two Braeburn apples. Instead of mayo, I used Miracle Whip Light. The results were pretty good. I believe when I make this again following the actual recipe, I will be in love with it.

My family loves this recipe.  It is fantastic exactly as directed.  However I usually make it with homemade mayonnaise and raw honey instead of the brown sugar.  You can also substitute unflavored greek yogurt for the mayo and that is very good as well.  Goes perfectly with BBQ dishes like pulled pork.  Definitely a five star recipe and so easy!

Great recipe. My SIL made this for a family dinner. Used one Granny Smith apple and left out the red apple. Also added more bell pepper. Use only one green onion or else the slaw will taste like green onion.

Made this with greek yogurt instead of the mayo so it would be even lighter, and it was great.  Next time I'll use a little less sugar because the yogurt doesn't balance it as well as the mayo would.

Just made this apple cole slaw for my family and they just loved it.  It has a great tang and sweetness and crunch!  Definitely will be making this again for the summer.  Just nice side dish to cut through the bbq and meats.

This is soooo good. If you like cole slaw you'll love this recipe! I just used a package of cole slaw mix and added a sliced green apple and red like the recipe calls for and then added some dried cranberries. The sweet dressing is delicious. (I left out the onions and peppers). I'll be making this for bbq's all the time! Thanks!

This is amazing!  I hate coleslaw, but got assigned it for a potluck and thought I'd give this a whirl.  Because I don't like coleslaw I followed the ingredients list exactly - the only slight change I made was to soak the chopped apples in the lemon juice rather than just let it mix in.  Everything about this recipe is delicious.  Even if you don't like one or two of the components, you DO need them all and somehow they all work well together.

If you are looking for a different recipe for cole slaw, you have found it.  This colorful salad is almost a cross between Waldorf salad and cole slaw.  The dressing is sweet, so be sure to add enough lemon juice to balance to your tastes.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband loved it.  He has a sweet tooth, so it really appealed to him.  For ease of combination, and for incorporating the onions, next time I will mix the dressing in the food processor and throw in the onions, so they will become part of the dressing.  A pinch of salt would be nice, too.

This was delicious!  The apples make for an especially refreshing slaw!  The sugar was a bit much for me, so would likely decrease to 1/4 cup next time.  All in all, VERY good....got rave reviews....and I'll definitely make this again!  I had an Aunt Mamie, too  :)

I'm not a pepper fan..... but based on other's reviews I added it anyway and was sorry.  This would have been outstanding sans the red pepper.  As it is, however, i'm only giving it 4 stars.

Very good.  I made this exactly as written, very good but needs a tad more tart to my taste next time will add apple cider vinegar and celery for more savory.

This was very good - better the next day. I used a vidalia onion instead of green onion as that is what I had. I also lowered the brown sugar to maybe 1/4 cup and used lot's of Cider Vinegar for a nice twang!

Nice flavor - first I thought it was a bit too sweet, but the next day the flavors melded and it wasn't at all.  Good twist on traditional slaw.

This is wonderful and I'm not even a big cole slaw fan!  Will definitely make again!  Only thing I changed was I used Truvia instead of brown sugar.  I can't believe I made homemade coleslaw and it was great!

This apple slaw is simply delicious.  I added a handful of walnuts which gave it a great crunch.  I also left out the red bell pepper and thought this was wonderful.

Very good! I omited the onions because I forgot them, but I don't think it was missing anything without them. I did all of the shredding in my food proccessor to speed it along. Make sure you let it sit in the dressing for a while before serving. I might cut down on the amount of cabbage next time (just to 2-2.5 c) but that is a personal taste preference. Thanks for this different coleslaw!

This was quite a hit at a football tailgate. Nice alternative to traditional cole slaw. Used bagged shredded cabbage and it came together quickly. Will make this again!

As other reviewers have done I omitted the onion and pepper. It is a fantastic cole slaw. I think next time I make it I will add walnuts for a little variety. My whole family says it is definitely a keeper.

This was yummy! I did leave out the carrot because my husband won't eat them. I loved the combo of apples and red pepper and the dressing was great. I didn't care for the leftovers, though, so I would recommend making for a big group or reducing the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I also added 1 tsp. white vinegar to the dressing and it was good. This cole slaw is more like a cabbage SALAD.

I hate cole slaw, but kids and husband love it.  So on a whim (and a cabbage I received from my CSA), I made this and LOVED IT.

I gotta say,  I am not a big cole slaw fan.  BUT!  This is really good!  I did change a few things.  On the apples  I grated half and chopped half of each apple.  Thought it would be too chunky.  And I did not have any lemons in, so used a splash of apple cider vinegar.  This was really good!   I also used the last fresh cabbage out of garden, which does not hurt!  ;)

It was a nice change to the traditional coleslaw. I think it is best eaten fresh because the apples get a little mushy the next day.

This is my new cole slaw recipe!  It's pretty, refreshing, and not all mayonnaise-y like some of the others out there.  I do recommend following the advice of the most popular review on here to reduce the liquid though.  I didn't this time and had to use a slotted spoon for serving, but it was still fine.

I added raisins. Just wash them first, then soak in the vinegar before adding in with the other ingredients. Sometimes I use caraway seeds in my cole slaw; maybe I'll try that next time with this recipe.

I made this for a big party and had many people ask me for the recipe.  I used other suggestions of buying the bag of prechopped cabbage & carrots, and adding almonds & dried cranberries.  Great summer salad!

I gave this recipe to my sister-in-law as a suggestion for an apple-themed dinner party we were having. She made it, but boy did I eat it. So tasty. She said she took other reviewers suggestion to cut the sweetness with a little more vinegar. Very good and crisp. And pretty -- with the red apples and red pepper and a carrot in the slaw mix.

Add some dill & poppy seeds; also explore adding some buttermilk.  My guests raved. My only critique is that it was a little too much on the sweet side...it probably only needs 1/4 c. of sugar or less instead of 1/3c., but with some vinegar or buttermilk, it balanced out nicely and it was delish!

This was ok with some modifications.  I used only 1/4 cup sugar and it was still little too sweet for us.  Sorry, wanted to like it.

I made this recipe tonight and my family LOVED it!  I forgot to buy the red pepper but will definitely add next time.  It was so easy to make and the result was just wonderful - not too sweet and tangy enough.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!  Thanks, Aunt Mamie!

Made this with a bag of "broccoli slaw".  Hubby and I both liked it.  I also slightly increased the brown sugar and slightly decreased the mayo according to our tastes.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this to go with pulled pork sandwiches and my guests RAVED about the slaw.  I couldn't find red bell peppers at the store - omitted them.  Didn't miss them, either!  With a mandolin, the slicing and shredding was a snap.  It looked a little dry after I mixed it, so I tossed in a little extra mayonnaise.  I snacked on it all day before the party, it was SO GOOD.  I will use this as my standard potluck recipe for the year.  I like to have a guaranteed success recipe - good for a crowd and not too expensive.  This fits the bill.  Thanks, allrecipes!

As far as coleslaw goes, this is very good...probably the best coleslaw that I've ever had. I nearly doubled the recipe, but only needed the same amount of mayo/brown sugar, and it was still very juicy. My husband loved it too, and I don't think he normally likes cole slaw that much.

I made as the recipe but substituted half the mayo with low fat natural yoghurt, to cut the fat. Don't think it altered it much. It is a great coleslaw, thanks for the recipe!

Quite good.  The ratio of apples to slaw was a little high, will add more slaw next time.  Added toasted walnuts, craisins and raisins.  Used the lemon juice to toss the apples (julienne) added cider vinegar to the dressing.  Had to add more cider and mayo to make enough (we prefer our slaw moist).  Big hit with the kids, hubby frowned until he had a taste.

Not bad at all.  A good way to use apples that might be sitting around.  I will make again.  I used the pre-shredded cabbage in the bag, which made it even easier.

Q!uick. Easy. Delicious.   I left out the red pepper since I simply don't care for it.  I used light mayo and Splenda Brown sugar instead of the regular stuff. My guests really enjoyed it, and I've since forwarded the recipe on.  Next time, I'm thinking I'll add some walnuts.....

Very yummy! The second time I made this I did the apple last so it wouldn't turn dark before adding the dressing. I used my food processor to make even easier.

Very good, I think next time I will try and lessen the sugar amount. There was a tip from another person to drain the cabbage 1st, I think I will try that next time as well. Good salad for a work night or putting a bbq together quickly. Nice taste

I liked the dressing on this quite a bit. The balance between the sweet of the sugar (used only about 1/2 of what was called for...) and the "tang" of the lemon is very nice.  Good starting point for whatever you wanted to include in the slaw.  Simply because I didn't feel like doing all the shredding/chopping I used only one apple (gala, I think...) and skipped the carrot all together.  May well include it next time though. May also add a handful of raisins/"craisins" and/or some toasted pecans. I'll probably play around with this a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it!  The dressing was very tasty.  We used a salad shooter and the texture was more ground up than the picture looked, but still wonderful.  I think I'll keep using the shooter to grate the veggies. I omitted the red bell pepper, do not really care for it in slaw. Delish!

The flavor is delicious, but the brown sugar gave a brownish color to the salad.  That color change put off my husband and son who are my cole slaw eaters.  They said they felt like they were eating old cabbage.  Such a shame because the flavor is wonderful.

I didn't like but my husband thought it was okay.  Although I won't be making it again, my advice is to eliminate the green onions for those who do make this.

This recipe was great. I made this for a casual dinner party and everyone raved! Will definitely make again.

Nice twist on coleslaw. The apple and honey gave this dish and nice sweet flavor without overpowering this dish.

I stand in awe.
My husband normally doesn't like vegetables. When it came time for seconds, my husband was heaping more cose slaw onto his plate, and left the main dish alone! What a wonderful surprise! 

I loved the mix of flavors and textures. I did use a double portion of the sauce, I don't know if that's just because I used bigger veggies, or if I just really liked the sauce, anyway, it was great. Thanks,

This is a pretty good cole slaw recipe.  I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe and thought that the flavor was just right without it.

easy recipe to make and always comes out consistently good.  can be made with low fat mayo and also add some red cabbage for a more robust colorful cole slaw.

This was just "okay" and I usually really love sweet cole slaws. Unfortunately, this was just TOO sweet and contained WAY TOO MANY apples. I made this for a barbeque I had and it was the only thing that was leftover (and the men I know don't usually leave ANYTHING...). If you decide to make it, be aware that the red bell pepper and the abundance of apples really dominates the taste!!!
