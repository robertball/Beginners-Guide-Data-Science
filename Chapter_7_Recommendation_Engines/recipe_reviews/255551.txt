I created this recipe I have  contacted allrecipes because Yes it's a typo you are supposed to add the honey mustard first and then the breadcrumbs they still have not corrected it yet ...

We love cod, so, I thought I would give this recipe a try.  The directions say to top the fish with bread crumbs and then brush with honey mustard.  I am wondering if that might be a typo, so, I brushed the fish with the honey mustard and then topped with the panko mixture.   The fish was really tasty and I would make it again.  I am wondering if there might have been another typo in adding 1 tbsp. of garlic powder to the yogurt mixture.  It had a very strong garlic taste and a slight powdery texture from so much garlic powder.   I made a second batch with less garlic powder and added a little lemon juice to thin it out and it was very tasty.   I also added some finely chopped green onion instead of chives because that is what I had in my refrigerator.   I am typically not a fan of instant mashed potatoes, but, the addition of butter and milk to the potatoes made them creamy and had great flavor.  Thanks for recipe!

We just added a little more spices (garlic and parsley) the panko breadcrumbs and I didn't have Honey Mustard so I used Grey Poupon Mustard that has a zing to it and added honey to it to bring down the zing a little.  DEFINITELY would make again!

I noticed the typo that the author acknowledges in that the honey mustard comes BEFORE the breading. I followed suit and these came out great. I only eat fish so I am always looking for new recipes. I skipped the yogurt dressing and the potatoes to keep this recipe non-dairy and healthier overall. Flavor was top notch. Thank you!

Honey mustard and cod just didn't mesh well with the chive dipping sauce. It was ok, just an odd flavor combination for our tastebuds and I won't make it again. Given the list of ingredients I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it really went together. Idahoan potatoes were awesome!

I enjoyed this fish... flavorful and healthy. I also put the honey mustard on the fish first and then the crumbs because spreading mustard on top of loose crumbs as the recipe states will result in clumps of crumbs.  I used way less garlic powder as even half that was very strong.. The potatoes were tasty.. better flavor than my usual brand. 15 minutes at 400 was  perfect. I am having the leftover fish and sauce in tacos for lunch
