At first I was skeptical about this recipe because I wasn't sure how the PapayiannidesÂ® Tomato & Olive & Ouzo sauce would pair with the prawns but I'm glad that I gave it a try. The only thing I changed is to reduce the red onion to a third otherwise it would've overpowered the delicate flavor of the prawns and ruined the recipe. I served this with my homemade herb bread along with a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon and it was flavorful and delicious.

I made this using the substitution in the footnote; really enjoyed the hint of licorice/ fennel flavor and the kalamata olives. I cooked the onion longer to caramelize it, and reduced the sauce a good bit. Cooking on a hot night, with the grill already going for asparagus, I tucked the cast iron skillet right on the grate instead of heating the oven, and it was fab. Topped it with a delicious double cream feta; served it over pasta. Stunning dinner for three, with leftovers.

We really enjoyed this zesty prawn recipe. The sauce certainly makes it and it's easy to prepare. Sounds like a strange combo but we served over cauliflower rice and it worked great. We'll make this again. Thanks Angie

Love this recipe! The end result was absolutely delicious... I will make a form of this again and again. I lucked out finding some beautiful huge prawns, but I'm thinking any size shrimp would work. The feta had a great texture and flavour blend with the other ingredients. Reading the other reviews and sampling the Ouzo sauce ahead of time, I too found it a touch sweet and so I decided to very lightly salt the shrimp prior to cooking it...it turned out perfectly. 

I'm thinking this would also be awesome over actual saganaki cheese instead of the feta! 

Thanks for a great recipe, Angie :)

Who doesn't love prawns?!  I divided the whole recipe by a third and ate it all for myself as a main.  Lots of seafood but that's what I'm into :)

This isn't five stars for me because I felt the overall dish was a little too sweet rather than savory.  It needed some salt for sure and in retrospect, I'm surprised s&p wasn't listed, at least 'to taste'.  The feta doesn't quite cover it.

Wow! So delicious! I went all out and ordered the PAPAYIANNIDES sauce from Greece. Well worth the price tag for shipping. The ouzo gives it a slight anise seed (black licorice) flavor. Wish I had taken a photo. It came out looking so lovely.

Pretty good. I threw in some extra black olives because I had a little bit that I just wanted to use up. Delicious.
