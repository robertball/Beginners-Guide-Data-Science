As always, reviews are largely a matter of personal opinion, and in my opinion these Fargozas weren't so Fabulous.  First, I eliminated the sugar as I believe it would have competed with the savory ingredients in this muffin.  But more than that, let's just say I made and tasted these muffins a few hours ago and I still have an incredibly potent and unpleasant garlic aftertaste in my mouth.  I will warn Hubs to stay a foot away from me.  Frankly, they were also a little heavy on the rosemary too.  A subtle hint of both would have made this a much better muffin.

These were a really nice and quick muffin to make with our potato soup. The footnotes indicated other cheeses that could be used, I was out of mozzarella and opted for the cheddar. Also had some chopped jalapenos for added zing. I did cut the sugar down to 2 TBSPS and most likely will do without it altogether next time. I didn't care for the sweetness which seemed to be very prevalent right out of the oven. The next day they didn't seem as sweet though. All in all pretty good.

Excellent prepared with shredded pepperjack cheese & cooked crumbled bacon along side a cream based soup. We will be having them next with cream of green chile (poblano or anaheim) soup.  Some sugar is needed in the recipe to help with browning the muffins.

I made these last night, exactly followed the recipe, and they were fabulous. A nice savory muffin. Froze a half dozen. Could be very addicting.

A fantastic savory muffin. I made them to go with a batch of homemade turkey/veggie soup. I made a few slight modifications: used onion powder instead of fresh (about 1 tsp maybe more), garlic powder instead of fresh (1/2 tsp.), and ground rosemary (cut to 1 tsp b/c the ground stuff is so strong) For the cheese, I used a Italian shredded blend (it was mozzarella, asiago, provolone, etc). But I stayed true the recipe. This is a great recipe. Mine baked in 22 minutes directly in the tin (no liners). The result was a nice golden brown "crust" all around the muffin and tender moist interior. YUM! Kids and adults loved it. Will definitely make these again! Thanks for the wonderful muffin recipe!

I wasn't too keen on the sugar in this recipe, so I left it out as other reviewers had, with success. I also used 50/50 whole wheat and all purpose flours. This is a beautiful, savory muffin recipe. Best warm out of the oven with a drizzle of melted butter over the top!

Very good for breakfast.  The only change I made was to saute the onion with the garlic for a little milder taste. thanks

Just took my first batch out of oven. I made mini-muffins (heart shaped for Valentines) and they had a crispy crust all around with a soft middle. SO GOOD! I did decrease the Rosemary to 1 tsp instead of 1 tbl, thought it might overpower in bite-sized muffins. (it was perfect amount, in my opinion) I also, at the suggestion of another reviewer, cooked my onion and garlic a bit to soften them since my baking time would be less. I baked them 14-15 minutes and they were perfect. I'm baking them tonight and will reheat and serve tomorrow for Sunday dinner - if I don't eat them all tonight...

Very flavorful, moist and tender. I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the onion (I used a sweet onion) and garlic before mixing in. I used fontina, gruyere and parmesan cheeses. For the second batch, I substituted green chili instead of rosemary for added spice -- it was wonderful and I highly recommend! I want to add all sorts of things to these, maybe bacon since we have been eating them with scrambled eggs. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yum, yum!  Now I admit I have never had a fargoza before, so do not have anything to compare this to, but as far as I am concerned, these were fantastic.  Having had experience with a harsh garlic taste when raw garlic is just dumped into a batter, I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil until wilted, which mellowed the flavor a bit (they still had plenty of onion and garlic flavor - just not as "harsh").  I also decreased the sugar to 1 tsp (based on other reviews) and subbed olive oil for the melted butter.  Oh, and I did not add any additional salt - the salt in the cheese was plenty for our tastes.   I did not find the rosemary flavor to be too strong - in fact, next time I make these I may add a tad more (depends on my mood and what I will be serving these with).  I served these with minestrone (Jaime's, from this site, with vegan italian sausage substitute added) and green salad - a hearty and flavorful meal for a snowy, wintery day.  Thank you Judi for sharing!

REALLY yummy! I was impressed with how good they are, as was my husband. :-) (Don't use cupcake wrappers with them though; the cheese makes them really stick!)

Excellent. I only used a couple teaspoons of sugar, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I made them with mild cheddar to go with our potato soup, and they were loved by everyone. They were good reheated the next day as well. I will be making these again. Thanks for an awesome different recipe!

I submitted this recipe and I just want to say thanks for all the wonderful reviews! I love the fact that others are taking the basic recipe and changing it up, it gives me ideas I had not even thought of trying, like bacon and spinach. I'm glad you are enjoying the recipe!

Loved them!!!  I made them the night before, so all I had to do was pop them in the oven.  I sauted some onions with some bacon, and added it to the batter.  I used old cheddar instead of mozzarella, and a 1/2 T T of sweet basil instead of rosemary.  Yummy with bacon and potato soup!

Loved these...smelled so good when baking. My family is already asking for more!  With the one leftover muffin, I split in half the next morning, pan fried it in a little butter and put a poached egg on top for a VERY tasty breakfast.

I made these for dinner tonight -- exactly as written but with fresh rosemary instead of dried -- and these have to be among the BEST muffins I have ever made.  And  I have made some great ones, I am a baker with over fifty years experience!   I would be proud to serve this to anyone!  Excellent recipe, breakfast, lunch or dinner!

I found out I don't like rosemary after having these. The rosemary took over the taste,  otherwise they were good. Next time I will either make it without rosemary or use a lot less.

Delicious rolls!  I sauteed the onions because they were on the strong side and added some fresh thyme. I used only 1tbs of sugar and they were fine, probably could go without it.  They were great!

I didn't have rosemary so I used thyme and savory. I also used cheddar because that's what I had on hand. They are really easy to make, very practical and delicious! Perfect for a picnic too! everyone Loved it!

Fabulous! I made these to go with Ybor City Salad from this site and because of that, I didn't add the cheese since the salad has plenty. Due to pure laziness on my part, I used granulated onion and garlic which still worked out well and since I always have fresh rosemary, I replaced the dried with fresh. No doubt the recipe works as written but it can also take some changes and still be delicious. Gonna make these a LOT! Thanks bunches! :o)

These were very good. I substituted whole wheat flour. Some in my family thought they weren't as good the next day, but loved them fresh out of the oven.

I used whole wheat flour, 1 T honey instead of sugar, and  omitted the salt.  They taste great!  They might taste better with some Italian seasoning, but are great with only rosemary and garlic flavoring!  I'll be making these again!

These really are Fabulous! I made them with the Chunky Potato Soup from this site. And they go together very well. The strong flavor of these little muffins was perfect with the creamy soup flavor. I had a hard time finding this recipe again. Don't hesitate to add it to your recipe box! I followed the recipe and they are Wonderful!

We loved the intense rosemary flavor. These made the house smell wonderful! I substituted half whole wheat flour, cheddar instead of mozzarella, and reduced the sugar by 1Tbs. They were  plenty golden at 19 minutes when I pulled them out. I think they would have been overdone had they gone longer. I will definitely be making these again.

as really good.  I only had ground rosemary, not the dried "stemmy" rosemary, so I used 2 teaspoons instead of a tablespoon and it was still too much.  Next time I'll use one teaspoon - still very good and I will make them again!  Thanks for a new recipe.

These muffins were wonderful right out of the oven!  There were none left over, but I was curious how they might taste the next day.  I did saute the onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil first, before adding with the wet ingredients.  I also did 1/4 of the flour as whole wheat and next time might increase that to 1/2.  Not sure if they will get too dry?  I will also try again by replacing the rosemary with oregano or basil some time or try a version with green chiles, cheddar and bacon.  It's a great recipe with lots of possibilities.

These were delicious!  I made these tonight instead of buying garlic bread and I'm so glad I did.  I did halve the amount of rosemary and used garlic & onion powder.  These came out soft on the inside, a nice crust on the outside, and quite flavorful.  They would have been more flavorful with the original ingredients, but the more mild flavor made them a hit with my 15-month old.  Can't wait to make these again and experiment with different cheese and spice combinations.

Did anyone ever try making this into a loaf of bread?????  Sounds like it would be really good for sandwiches.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out really yummy.  I had ground rosemary so that's what I used instead of regular kind.  I didn't find them too garlicky either.  I did make sure the garlic was finely crushed and minced.

These are amazing, and I don't even like rosemary! I used a shallot instead of an onion, heavy cream instead of milk and for the cheese one cup mozzarella, one cup cheddar and 1/3 cup of Parmesan. These were very moist and cheesy! Great on their own, but would pair well with a creamy soup or as a twist on eggs florentine.

These were lovely and I shall certainly be making them again.  I will use less sugar next time and substitute the mazzarella for mature English cheddar next time as I like a stronger taste of cheese.  Thanks so much for the recipe :-)

You can take down the salt a touch, since the cheese is salty.  Otherwise, it's fine.

Made according to the recipe except that I grated the onion.  The grated onion was so wet that I added the onion to the liquid ingredients instead of the dry.  I had the same experience as naples34102:  way too much garlic for me.  I tried one out of the oven, I tried one after they cooled, and I tried one the next day. The garlic isn't so bad in the first couple of bites but after the muffin is finished, and expecially a few minutes after that, the garlic is overwhelming.  I've used a lot of garlic in other dishes so I'm not sure why it's so different in these muffins.  I know everyone has a different level of like or tolerance but this was kinda like eating raw garlic.

These are really, really good. I used buttermilk and they were a bit dry, so I ended up adding about 3 1/2 cups of buttermilk. The taste was really great.

These are GREAT!  I made them to go with KA187's Hobo Beef & Veggetable Soup (which also came out really good).  Since I'm diabetic I  used Splenda instead of the sugar and to cut down a bit on the carbs/sugars & it came off good.

What a great recipe! The best part is that you can make them any way you want! I had Swiss cheese on hand, also add a shake of bacon bits;  I used garlic and onion powders because  I was in a hurry. I halved the recipe and made them in an 8-cup midsize muffin tin.  Cooked for 14 minutes.. perfection! OMG. these are so yummy! Poopoo to the naysayers. These are moist and delicious. Hubby didn't love them because he is not a lover of rosemary like I am, and I also didn't make them super cheesy because I don't love cheese.  Again, that is the beauty of this recipe. I can't wait to try them again with other flavor combinations.

These were an absolute hit with my friends! I only made two little changes. After reading some other reviews I sauteed the onions and garlic paste before adding them into the mix. I also didn't have any dried rosemary, and was low on fresh, so I wound up using only about 2 tsp fresh rosemary instead of 1 tbs dried. They turned out so good! The sugar added a delicious hint of sweetness among the cheesy goodness of the bread. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for the great recipe!

3/2017: Very good! Next time, I would decrease the baking soda to 2 or 2.5 tsp and increase the salt to 3/4 tsp. I used garlic powder and no onions. Also, I only needed to bake them for 17 minutes at 400.

Like other reviewers, I ommited the sugar and decreased the amount of rosemary and garlic. (Actually, I used garlic powder instead of fresh.) I also ommited the onion, partly because I was short on time and partly because of preference. These were delicious! However, they seemed to have more of a biscuity texture, which I didn't mind. They were still pretty moist :)

I made these tonight since I needed something to go with my Spaghetti dinner and they were fantastic! I substituted Greek Oregano for the Rosemary, used Garlic Salt in place of the crushed garlic, and left out the cheese since we have some dairy allergies in our house. This made 6 over-size muffins which were the perfect size for a great accompaniment to our Italian dinner. This will definitely be a new standard addition to our spaghetti meals!

Oh my goodness these are delicious and very easy to make, my family devoured them. I followed the recipe exactly which is unusual for me and I still wouldnt change a thing. I do recommend greasing your pan very very well though and not using liners as the cheese can cause them to stick quite a bit. Thanks for the great recipe :)
