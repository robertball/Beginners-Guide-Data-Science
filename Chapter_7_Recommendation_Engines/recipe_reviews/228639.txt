This is also a great way to use up leftover chicken!

I'm not even sure how to review this, because it wasn't bad, but it wasn't Brunswick stew.  I guess it could be most likened to Pork BBQ soup tasting like BBQ pork smothered in BBQ sauce and baked beans.  The butternut squash softened up like a substitute potato to add some thickness.  The flavor the other ingredients could have provided were completely drowned out by the baked beans and BBQ sauce. It's just not a flavor you're expecting in soup.  This recipe makes a LOT.  My large crockpot was overflowing.  I'll be freezing a bunch for an emergency meal, but we won't be making this again.

I would make it again, however I would omit the brown sugar and the honey.  If you stick to the recipe, this is actually soup. 2 cups of stock would be sufficient.  And if you do use all the stock double the amount of potatoes.  So all in all the bones of the recipe are good, it just needs some tweeking! P.S. This did not fit in my crock pot. I ended up using my dutch oven in the oven on 325 for 2 hours then on stove top for 3 hours on low to reduce.

I substituted the squash with potato, it is sweet almost tastes like a mix of pulled pork and baked beans, came out more like a soup consistency. I was glad to find something to do with my leftover pork roast as I don't like it reheated. Will make this again. You should definitely have some nice crusty bread to soak up all the broth.

as others have noted, very sweet and too much liquid and over flowed my crockpot. it's an OK stew, though doubt anyone from Brunswick would call this their own.

Hearty and delicious, but overly sweet for my taste.  Recommend substituting navy or great northern beans for baked beans and reducing amount of barbecue sauce.

This recipe uses leftover pork which was perfect. I missed the lima beans, but the butternut squash was a nice change. Lots of flavor and lots of soup!

It is even better and thicker as a leftover. But it didn't last more than two meals. Yumm!
