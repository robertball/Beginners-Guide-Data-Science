I would probably give this 3.5 stars, but there was no bitterness in the leaves so I am leaning toward 4 stars. I usually make this side dish with a ham hock or neck bones. Plus I season with old bay seasoning. I thought it would lack some flavor so I used all chicken broth instead of half chicken broth and half water. It's a decent, basic recipe, ready to be spiced up a bit per your taste.

Very easy to make.  Instead of using water and chicken broth, I used chicken broth and ham broth made with ham base.  I also added some soul food seasoning that I had purchased.  They were delicious!  Even my husband and son loved them!  I definitely will make again!
