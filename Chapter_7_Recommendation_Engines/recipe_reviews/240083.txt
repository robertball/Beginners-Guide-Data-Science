This is so good, I had to change out the flours to 1 cup of Red Mills stone ground white rice flour and the rest Arrowhead Mills Gluten free all purpose baking mix.  You can not tell this is gluten free.

This bread rises, usually the gf loaves are very dense and short. This recipe rose very well. I was definitely impressed.

I had to do it twice. The first one I thought was done after 60mins but flopped. After 70 mins the second was much better!

I love this recipe! Here are the few minor changes I made: used 2/3 C of sugar instead of 3/4 C. added 1 T+ of GF flour  (since I am at high altitude), used cinnamon- apple  organic applesauce (since that's what I had). Turned out fabulous, I will be making this again... and again...

The texture really is amazing. It’s fluffy and doesn’t taste like it’s gluten free. The one thing I didn’t like was the raisins. And normally I’m a big fan of raisins. Next time I’ll probably add pecans instead of raisins. The only thing i changed was the quantity of sugar. I only used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cups. It’s still plenty sweet. Even at high altitude it was ready after 60 minutes of baking.

I made this for my daughter who was recently diagnosed with celiac disease. It was absolutely delicious and hard to believe this is gluten free.  We each ate one warm slice with a little butter and the dog jumped up on the counter and ate the rest of the loaf. I did add crushed pecans instead of raisins. Hope you enjoyed it too Jambi.

I used more pumpkin spice, but this turned out very good.  Time to make a BEEG loaf of it with some spare cans of punkin.

This was a pretty great gluten free pumpkin bread.  I made an oops and it still turned out well.  I accidentally chucked in Baking Powder (about 3/4 tsp.) - misread the recipe - I still put in about 3/4 tsp. of soda.  Bread rose beautifully, wasn't too heavy, no soapy flavor from too much raising agent  and was nice and moist.  Next time I will put in more cinnamon and ginger just for personal preference but it is good as is.

Made this and it was way more dense than pictured.  Not sure why.  Tastes OK, but not really muffin like.
