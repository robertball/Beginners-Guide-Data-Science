Yes, a southern favorite....as a dessert.  My friend makes a great version of this and taught me the recipe, except she doesn't measure!!!  So, I had to get my own measurements. These are pretty close, except I use about 3/4 cup of white sugar, or sometimes 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup light brown. Also I use evaporated milk for a creamier pudding. Flour works fine if you are out of cornstarch. Also a few flaor enhancing spices....1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Best thing about this is that it's a "dump" recipe - mix in one bowl and bake slowly. Enjoy with a cup of coffee for breakfast too!!!

This turned out well.  It was a great addition to our Easter Dinner.  I did modify this slightly though.  I cut the butter to just 1/4 cup, the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I sprinkled some nutmeg and a little cinnamon on it as well.  Baked it in a round dish instead of the 9 x 13, at 400 degrees because that was the time for the other 2 dishes that needed to go in the oven and just kept checking on it to make sure that it wasn't burning or to check when it was done.  I received various complements on it.

WE LOVE THIS DISH!!!  I've made it 3x already and everyone absolutely loves it.  It's the perfect side dish. You can prepare it ahead of time, then stick it in the oven and "fuhgetaboutit"!

It seems that this dish is often served at church functions in NC.  It is so good!  I made this for my family this week and EVERYONE loved it (even my 2 yr old grand-daughter).  The only thing was it had a bit more liquid than it should have.  I drained the corn and baked it all for 90 mins., but still watery.  I drained the casserole and baked it a bit more and it was great.  I also added a little bit of black pepper.  Very good!

This is it! I have been looking for this for a while! I lost my recipe a while back and could kick myself! It is a huge favorite of my family's and I was the only one who had it! Like another reviewer, I too use flour instead of cornstarch and like evap milk. Just a hint of nutmeg is corn puddings best friend! Thanks to Kathy! And Jacquita for posting!

I searched for a sweet corn casserole that I remember having a long time ago, and this is it!  I'd really like to give this 4 1/2 stars because it tastes delicious, but I think it would be better in a round casserole dish (like in the picture) as opposed to the 9x13 mentioned in the recipe.  The 9x13 made it too thin, although it still took the same amount of time to bake.  One other thing - it doesn't puff up like it says in the instructions.  Overall, very tasty!

Good comfort food!  I added a dash of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon, which changed the color, but made my kitchen smell like a chai tea was "brewing" in the oven!

This was entirely too sweet.  It also HAS to cook for the entire recommended time.  It was still too soupy for my liking.  I guess my search for the perfect corn casserole continues.

Nice enough. Our casserole thickened up just fine. My family thought this was nice. They liked it more than I did. They wouldn't complain one whit about having this again, and with its being corn and all, it could easily become comfort food to them. HOWEVER they are not utterly in love with any creamed corn casserole. I typically adore southern cooking, so I couldn't resist trying a southern styled corn pudding.  I guess there is still northerner left in me, as I couldn't help comparing this to my grandmother's corn casserole.  Sho' nuf, I missed my grandmother's savory corn casserole, stuffed to the gills with butter, eggs and crackers and her best seasonings.  I never cared for anyone else's corn casserole (and I'm usually pretty happy with anything related to corn).  I'm sure that's just a preference thing on my part, though.  Hmmmm, just to see what they think of Grandma's cooking, and because we still have a few extra-large sized cans of creamed corn, I think I'll finally have to break down and make that very calorie laden casserole my grandmother, then mother, made for Thanksgiving every year...., but I'll pass on having it at Thanksgiving, because I'll be saving all my extra splurge calories for turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes and dressing, and then pumpkin pie and chocolaty treats!..... ummmm, I can hardly wait!) -- I better watch out, though.  My family might start making Grandma's casserole and I'll have to stop eating it somehow! Yikes!

Very  good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor was outstanding.  The texture was a little unusual, with a watery liquid at the bottom of the casserole. DMIL loved the texture.  DH and DD were not so ethusiastic.  I will try this again, replacing the milk with evaporated milk or half and half.

The best corn pudding recipe.  I'm a southern girl, but my family never made corn pudding.  I got introduced  to it by my mother in law.  Her recipe was always missing something...the corn starch.  This is my new recipe...I use it for every holiday and there are no left overs.  In our house, it isn't served as a dessert, but right along with the other side dishes.

I gave this recipe 4 stars rather than 5 even though the flavor was exactly as I remembered my Mother's  corn pudding tasting, but because I made the following changes in the recipe. I read one reviewer state that her pudding didn't "pouf" when she cooked it. I used 4 large eggs rather than 3, and I whipped them until frothy with an electric mixer. I then VERY slowly drizzled the melted butter (NOT MARGARINE) down the side of the mixing bowl while keeping the beaters running - in fact, I used the beaters to incorporate everything in my large mixing bowl. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, and was very careful to drain my whole corn thru a strainer before adding it and the creamed corn in. The one thing I didn't do exactly right was to make certain that the corn starch was completely incorporated into the evaporated (not regular) milk, and because of this there was a slight bit of liquid in the bottom of the casserole when done. I baked it covered with foil for the first hour, then uncovered it for the last half hour, watching closely to make sure it didn't overbake.

I wanted to use the frozen corn that we have in our fridge and came across this recipe. It was a little sweet and runny. I would probably cut the butter in half (1/4 cup) and also maybe use 1/3 cup of sugar. I don't know if I will eat the rest of the pudding as it was too sweet for my taste. I will probably make this again with slight modification.

I tried it but altered it so not really same recipe. I saw another recipe and decided to merge them. I added about 3/4 cup of corn meal with teaspoon of baking soda and salt and only 3 eggs. I also used frozen corn kernels in 12 ounce bag. And heavy cream because I needed to use some up instead of milk. I cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes because oven was on and then 400 degrees for another 30 minutes to get it done. It turned out fairly firm and crusty on side in rectangle dish. Would think you could alter this recipe a lot according to what you have on hand and how much time you have. One less star because I did not cook the exact recipe but liked the result I got.

Wonderful! I made this for a bunch of Brits who were quite skeptical of it, but ended up adoring it and asking for seconds and thirds! Excellent for Thanksgiving.

Made it exactly per the recipie and it was a hit. Normally, I wouldn’t try out a new recipie on Thanksgiving but it sounded yummy and got great reviews. It’s very sweet  but complimented the rest of meal very well.

Great recipe. Use less margarine (1/4 cup) and less sugar (1/3 cup) also added nutmeg 1/4 tea and 1/2 tea cinnamon.
Was great hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

This is a potluck side dish staple where I live, and I'm always glad to see it. However, I don't care for the recipes including a box of cornbread mix and I've never had a reliable recipe, one that wasn't either too gooshy or too dry. This one seems just right in terms of texture, except that I'd reduce the sugar by about half. (I've NEVER eaten it as a dessert -- not to say that you couldn't, but my preference is for a more savory, less sweet corn pudding.)

This dish is an instant classic, I modified the recipe slightly by adding 5oz of diced pimientos. I have been asked by multiple family members to make this for every get together.

My niece asked me to make her some corn pudding for our Thanksgiving dinner but I had never made it before. I tried this recipe and it was a huge success. Everybody loved it.  Making it again for Christmas!

I followed the recipe to the "T" and made sure I drained the water from whole can corn.  Corn pudding turned out watery.

I prepared the dish, but with fresh corn, and two cans of creamed corn along with the rest of the recipe. However, the dish came out with too much liquid, but was ok. Nothing really to rave about.

I used only half the sugar and it was plenty sweet. Vanilla gave it an interesting note. I used half and half instead of milk because of other raters mentioning it being too watery. It was quite good.

This is just getting done and it tastes wonderful (and smells awesome!) but mine came out a little watery...maybe I didn't drain corn quite enough? or maybe because I used low fat milk? I don't know, but next time I'll use evaporated milk as someone suggested on here..or half and half,and drain more carefully.or use alittle flour also? It sure is a great recipe though..will try again till I get it perfect because I LOVE me some CORN!! I eat corn on cob everyday! ;)
