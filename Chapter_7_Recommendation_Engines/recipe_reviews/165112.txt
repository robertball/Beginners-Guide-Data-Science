I have made this for 30 odd years. The 1st part can all be done on the stove top in a large saucepan. Just add the butternut along with the garlic and onions. Cook 5 min.,then add the stock,cover with lid. Bring to boil, reduce heat, simmer till tender.Remove lid turn up heat and reduce liquid till just moist. (don't let it burn). Put in baking dish and add topping. Just use tasty chedder and parm., cheese. The herbs over power the expensive cheese so why waste your money.

One of the considerations I use in rating any recipe is the cost of the ingredients vs. the taste.  Some recipes are worth the expense and some aren't. This one wasn't.  My husband and I thought the flavor of this recipe was just OK.  I won't make it again because I didn't think it was worth the time it took to make it, but mainly because it is VERY expensive to make.  I live in Atlanta and Gruyere cheese is $19.00 per pound!  That's right -- an 8 oz. block of it cost me $9.50. When you add in the cost of fresh rosemary and thyme, extra sharp cheddar, and the cost of the squash, it costs about $18.00 to make this dish.  It would have to be extra super delicious for me to pay this much to make it again and it just wasn't.

Note in response to Laura: Great question! Yes, you can make it all ahead of time, just keep the the squash part and the breadcrumb mixture separate until you are ready to reheat the squash mixture and finish it.  Otherwise the breadcrumbs get soggy.

Other notes: Using coarse breadcrumbs smashed up a little bit works a little better than the fine canned breadcrumbs you get at the grocery store.  Also you can use all cheddar if gruyere or emmenthaler are too difficult or expensive... but I really like the flavor they give.

Well! I am so glad I picked today to finally make and review this dish! :)  I ended up buying an Emmentaler for the Gruyere, as I remember someone recommending it.  It was actually slightly cheaper than the regular Gruyere, not that it mattered - it was not as outrageously priced here as it is in other areas, apparently, and if it was I simply would not have made this for a typical Sunday dinner, nor would I have reviewed it.  Only changes I made were to use panko bread crumbs, vegetable stock and thyme that I had dried a few weeks ago, all substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I can't say enough about this - it was absolutely delicious!   A golden, crunchy crust over delicious sweet butternut squash - just heavenly! Kept trying to think of something to add or change, but the best I could do was to sprinkle some freshly cracked pepper before eating it.  Thanks for coming up with a new favorite!

I have been making a version of this recipe for years around the holidays and it always gets rave reviews.  For those like me that like to tinker with recipes here are a couple variations I like to do:  (1) you can roast the butternut squash halved in its skin at 425 for approx 45mins or until tender and then scoop out the squash and prepare the rest of the way as is--this gives the flavor a little more depth from the roasting  (2) I am a carmelized onion junkie, so rather than mixing some of the sauteed onions and garlic into the butternut squash, I like to carmelize 3 onions with a little bit of thyme and butter and then top the butternut squash with them (the breadcrumb-cheese mixture goes on top of the that) before baking as directed.  This creates a layered effect of the different flavors and the carmelized onion makes it even more savory.    This is a great and versatile recipe that is just a little bit away from the traditional holiday fare you see--a little labor intensive--but worth it.

We loved this!  My 7yo says the flavor reminds her of stuffing.  I brought the price down a bit by using Cheddar and Mozzarella, and used dried herbs (1 tsp each) in place of fresh.  We'll be having this again!

Okay Merritt, worthy of a 5 star rating!!!  I'm a butternut squash *newbie* and this dish was VERY GOOD! My squash came from my  garden, so I'm not sure it was 2.5 lbs (measured 9"). Since I wasn't sure of the weight, I did cut back on all the cheeses slightly.  Prep work is about 30 minutes, but the end result is worth it.  I used panko bread crumbs slightly crushed (as suggested by the submitter) and this added nice texture.  I enjoyed the combination of the three cheeses in this dish!  Since I have an abundance of this squash taking over the yard, I will be making this a few times this summer!!  THANKS for a great recipe!

I can't believe that I forgot to rate this one - not like he needs another rave review, but I loved this recipe, and will make it often. For those worried about the expense of the Gruyere cheese, you can also make it with mozzarella or cheddar or a nicely flavorful swiss. I have my own all year herb pots so I made it with fresh rosemary and thyme.

This is an amazing recipe.  Butternut squash prepared in more traditional ways makes me gag, but this dish has a savory taste that is comforting and delicious.  I used about half the cheese recommended (3/4 sharp cheddar, 1/4 shaved parmesan) and it tasted wonderful.  Can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving!

Way too much cheese - I reduced by half and it was perfect. This is a delicious recipe! 

I'm not big on rosemary so did thyme and Penzey's Fox Point, absolutely delicious. I also expedited the process by cooking the squash fully on the stovetop, mixing in half the cheese/breadcrumbs into the squash with some milk + boullion instead of broth, then put in a dish, topped with the rest of the cheese/breadcrumbs and baked til the top was crispy.

Something different than the usual sweet mapley butternut squash!  It took a little bit of time to prepare, which on weeknights I might pass up this recipe. Also, we thought there was a little too much onion, and too herby... we are pretty plain eaters.  The cheesy topping though, was AMAZING! I would have never thought to put cheddar with squash!  Yum, I will absolutely be making this again, with half of the onion & herbs next time :)

I made this for Easter I guess I somehow forgot to review it. I loved this dish! And so did my family I did have to change the recipe a little bit because I couldn't find Gruyere cheese at any of my grocery stores. So I used a smoked swiss/cheddar cheese that I found recently. I don't know if this was a close substitute but I thought it worked really well. I have only had butternut squash one way so I was excited to try it differently. I'm so glad I found this recipe. Thanks!

I made a lot of substitutions and it still came out great.  I love this recipe.  I used coconut oil instead of butter, almond meal instead of bread crumbs, amber agave syrup instead of brown sugar, mozzarella cheese instead of Gruyere cheese, my seasonings were all from a bottle, and I used a different kind of squash. I was very worried about how it would taste - it was delicious. YUM!!  :)

I made this last week for a dinner party. It was VERY good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather then 5 was because I thought the thyme overwhelmed the topping and made the rosemary disappear. The topping had more of a "poultry seasoning stuffing taste" NEXT time I will just leave it out and allow the rosemary to shine :)
I served it with ham, scalloped potatoes and a brocolli salad. Faaaaabulous!!!.

Loved it!  Made this to take to my in-law's on Thanksgiving and it got great reviews and requests for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was use sweet onion - 2 instead of 1 - carmelized both and mixed 1/2 with the squash and then put the other 1/2 on top just before adding the bread crumb mixture.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner, and it was a huge hit. I did use vegetable stock to make it vegetarian, and omitted the rosemary only because of personal preference. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks !!!

I am a huge fan of butternut squash, and this was delicious.  I substituted panko bread crumbs, and used mixed Italian cheeses.  I would note that using a shallower, bigger dish will result in a better "topping to squash" ratio.  The first time I made this, I made it in a smaller, deeper dish, and I felt that I didn't have enough topping in proportion to the squash.  But still delicious and not too difficult to make!

Love this! I love the savory squash.  Following the advise of another reviewer, I did cook this mostly on the stove then put into the oven for awhile.  The important part of stove top cooking is to make sure you get your onion caramelized. I also used asiago and mozzarella for my cheeses (it's what I had) and Italian bread crumbs. My husband loved it and he doesn't eat squash! It really didn't take that much work. I used a really good vegetable pealer to peel the squash and a sharp knife to cut it into chunks. Well worth the effort. Thanks for a great recipe!

Well worth the effort for a Thanksgiving side dish.  This was an amazing squash recipe!  I had my husband work on this while I prepped everything else and I am so glad he wanted to help.  We got many requests for the recipe.  We didn't change a thing.  I made this instead of yams/sweet potatoes and I have to say, I will make it every year from now on.  We warmed up some leftovers this morning and had with a couple of eggs!  It is still fabulous!  Thank you!

We loved this recipe. I cut out the herbs all together because I wanted to really taste the squash and cheese. I also used swiss, chedder and parm. Thought it was the perfect autumn dish. Next time I will cut out the brown sugar because I think the squash is sweet enough.

I'm new to this website and I can't find a place to ask a question about this recipe...Is this something that I can make ahead of time?  It sounds delicious, I'm concerned that if I make it ahead of time it won't reheat well?  What do you think?  Thanks!

I have made this recipe several times just using the cheeses I have in the house and it turns out wonderful every time. I have used cheddar, mozzarella, parm, and feta. No need to buy anything expensive. I have also used acorn squash on a few occasions and I like that better than the butternut. This is a favorite in my household no matter how I make it.

Great recipe! My kids (9 & 11) liked it, but requested less crumb topping next time. I agree that fresh herbs are unnecessary; there is so much flavour going on in this dish already, I'll use dried next time. The cheese is expensive, and we are certainly not wealthy, lol, but we felt this was a worthwhile expense (most "fancy" cheese is, in our household). This recipe has made it into my monthly rotation :)

This dish is outstanding.  I make it only at Christmastime (complements prime rib nicely), and this year we had a neighborhood Christmas potluck.  EVERYONE LOVED IT, and 4 people demanded the recipe.  I've tried milder cheeses, and you really do need the extra-sharp cheeses to work with the just-a-bit-of-sweetness of the squash.

Delicious! Took to a dinner party and got great reviews!  Only changes I made were, I used feta instead of gruyer (because I had it in the frig) and panko for the bread crumbs.  I turned the broiler on for a few minutes at the end to brown the topping.  It looked lovely and had a crunch.  Will make again!

I made a few alterations to this recipe, but the combination of flavors is out of this world. I cut the cheese in half, and used the pre-shredded Italian blend so that the squash takes the main stage. I also added oregano to make it a little more savory. Delicious!

Glorious! The family was very pleased. I used panko too. The only thing I might do differently is add a bigger squash or cut down on broth and cheeses. This dish is quite a bit of cheese. Also used reduced fat cheddar which did not diminish the dish! 2 of the three adult women asked for the recipe! Don't miss this one

This dish was a disappointment and embarrassment at Thanksgiving dinner. The taste was okay but the cheese mixture formed a dense helmet on top (hard to cut with a fork) and the squash was watery. An unpleasant experience.

This is verrrry good. I love the way the cheeses accompany the sweet of the squash. My only issue was with the bread crumbs...that my be my own fault...mine were "italian' style crumbs, already seasoned with italian seasoning. And, then adding in the rosemary and thyme may have over seasoned for my taste.I think the next time I will tray a Panco bread crumb so that it is more coarse and not so grainy and not so already seasoned. I will make this again.

AMAZING!  I have been searching for a good squash recipe for Thanksgiving for years now and I have finally found it!  This was a hit!  Absolutely no left-overs with this one!  I added bleu cheese to the mix (we love bleu cheese in my family) and it was superb!  I will be making this every year for now on.

I have not made this recipe, though, I know that without a doubt it would be scrumptious!!! Based on the last reviewer's critique, I am on the same page as she/he is.  Yes, of course, everything tastes GREAT with lots of cheese, fresh herbs, and even bacon - how can you go wrong with these ingredients?  I'm absolutely certain that this recipe is a veritable crowd-pleaser, but like the last reviewer, I simply can't afford to spend $20-$30 on a single recipe anymore - even for the holidays.
When I need to make a dinner that will thrill all of my friends whether they be omnivores, carnivores, vegetarians, vegans, etc., I always start with ALLRECIPES.  Most of these recipes are really quite simplistic and very good, but some can be rather pricey.
I'm suggesting, in this rather depressed economy, that we start to submit recipes that are back to the basics, that are affordable with a minimal amount of $$ spent.

I thought this was very good, I love crunchy cheese toppings on dishes.  However, I do think that the strong flavor of the Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses were too much of a contrast, it overwhelmed the delicate flavor of the squash.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will experiment with some milder cheeses.

This takes a few steps and some time, but it's really good.  It's also very easy.  I didn't use any cheese other than cheddar and parmesan, but it's still really good that way.  Thanks for the recipe--another good way to make squash.  :o)

This was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except due to oven availability issues, I followed the suggestion to do most of the cooking on the stovetop. Couldn't find any Gruyere, so I used some sharp sheep's milk cheese instead, but I really think you could use any sort of "bitey" cheese and it would be fantastic. Making it again this week for a pot-luck! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I agree with other reviewers that this dish is time consuming and the gruyere is expensive, but it is soooo worth it.  Will definitely make again, just can't have this on a regular basis.  Yum.

This was SO GOOD! I'll never make "normal" stuffing again. We're a vegetarian household so I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken broth, and had to use dried herbs (with oregano since I didn't have thyme), but it still turned out delish! I also used about two and a half cups of bread crumbs (homemade), and am glad for it... one cup doesn't seem like it would have given it enough crunch.

Tasty.  The crust had a perfect amount of crunch and had a nice flavor from the herbs.  I cut the amount of cheese in half and used dried herbs.  Will make again!

Great recipe! The topping can be made with just cheddar and parmesean crumbled with bread crumbs and a tblsp of butter. Also, I found a cup of stock was WAY too much liquid. I had to pour some off, leaving the whole thing a bit overdone. Otherwise, this was just perfect, even for the squash haters in the house!
I did have some trouble sauteing the squash, I had to do it in 2 batches. In hindsight I think everything up to browning the topping could be done in a large pan or pot as one already suggested, and browning the squash can be skipped. Still tasted great!

hummm...i honestly don't know what i did wrong. this has potential but i felt like I was serving a cheese/bread crumb crust with some squash. There was just way too much topping for the squash underneath. I am going to make again and I will review again, but am going to cut the topping in half or more. the squash was delish underneath. like I said, I felt the potential so I will m ake again.

The flavor of this dish was very yummy.  I thought that the end result of this dish would be roasted chunks of squash with browned breadcrumbs and cheese, but the squash was so soft from being baked under the foil that the consistency was more like mashed potatoes. I think that next time I will experiment with the baking temperatures and methods to get the texture I want from this dish, but otherwise I think it is great.  It wasn't enough to change the mind of my squash hating dinner-guests, though. :( Thanks Merrittorious

Amazingly good and fattening!  Thanks to you, Merritt, we now have a T-giving Day "staple" side dish.  I was just requested to pretty please make it again this year.  Because of this recipe I actually became an "official" allrecipes.com member.  Don't listen to the naysayers, this is a really good, satisfying-to-everyone dish.  If you don't like one or all of the cheese in the recipe, use the cheese you like.  Running out now to buy the Gruyere!!  : )

This has become a staple for Christmas dinner since we tried it a few years ago.  It's definitely a pricey recipe to prepare (hence, we only do it at Christmas).  But it's outstanding.

Definitely a repeat recipe in our house. Next time I am going to try mixing half of the cheese mixture with squash. Using it all on top was a little thick.

I made this a week ago and it was wonderful.  My husband and I were very surprised with how delicious this was.  We used red onions and used mozzarella and colby cheese (that's what we had available).  We will definitely make this again, and I will probably introduce this to my humongous family on Thanksgiving.  Thanks!

I made this dish for our Christmas dinner and it was a huge success. I didn't have fresh Tyme or Rosemary so what I did was added 1-l/2 tsp of Herb de Province which has Tyme & Rosemary included, plus I had my sister who is celiac, therefore, I had to use rice crackers crushed. The topping was so delicious that I would use it on other casseroles that call for a crumb topping or corn flake topping just to dress up the dish.

Like some other readers, the squash was swimming in the broth after cooking in the oven for 45 mins.  Also like some others I found the quantity of topping was about twice what you need to cover the squash.  I used a squash that was exactly 2.5 lbs per the recipe, but it was barely enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. A smaller dish would have made more sense. This recipe needs a lot of tweaking - better yet, I think I will try a different recipe next time I make butternut squash.

I followed the directions, but I felt 50 minutes under foil with extra liquid would be way too much and make it squishy, so I put it I for 20 - and it was still way too squishy and watery. Maybe should've baked uncovered?

Anyway, I think when I dumped the liquid a lot of the delicious onion and garlic and chicken broth flavor went with it, so I ended up with bland squishy squash covered with topping. I am so sad!

I picked this recipe for my church's Oktoberfest. Unfortunately I should have tested it out first to see how it would taste. I also accidentally put the broth in too early and the breadcrumbs were still powdery when they came out of the oven. It was not worth it and I will not be making this again.

Amazing!!  Made it exactly as the recipe stated the first time and it was delish....Tonight, I didn't have all the ingredients or the oven space. I made the onion/squash/sugar/garlic/stock mixture on the stove top and cooked until tender.  Then I added chopped basil instead of rosemary. Cooked until almost all the liquid was out.  When the oven freed up, I spread the mixture out on a small jelly roll pan and sprinkled with swiss cheese and italian bread crumbs and broiled for a few minutes.  We ate all the squash and had leftover chicken.  It's normally the veggie that is left over.  A definite keeper as is or as a springboard for other variations.

After I baked the butternut squash for 50 minutes and considered the huge pile of bread crumbs/cheese that I was supposed to pour on the dish for the final 15 minutes, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I used probably half of the cheese/bread crumb mixture and while I was very impressed with the flavor IDEA of the thing, it was just WAY TOO GREASY and salty. I may try what a previous reviewer said--twice the squash and half the cheese mixture.

Delicious way to serve Butternut Squash. It does make a lot so next time I make this I will take it to a family gathering versus cooking for my husband and I. Would definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe at a potluck with my fellow employees and fell in love with it! I decided to share it with my family over Christmas and they did too! My husband is not a big fan of Gruyere so I used Asiago, Jack and Sharp Cheddar and still topped it with Parmesan. I will make this again without a doubt!

I've made this a number of ties, and always get compliments on it.  I sometimes roast the squash in the oven to get a caramelized taste to it, then put in in the pan with the broth.  Both ways delicious.

This was pretty good! I didn't use the Grueyer cheese just because of the price and just used what I had on hand a combination of Sharp Cheddar and Colby Jack.  I liked it and probably will make it again, one of my daughters said she thought it tasted like a lasagna but with squash, my husband said in cube form it was too strong.  He thinks next time I make it I should mash the squash first before adding the cheese topping instead of leaving it cubed.  All in all it wasn't a bad recipe and I will make it again.  I also add some freshly ground black pepper and realized I added a tbsp of brown sugar instead of a tsp.  I think I will keep this addition.  It gave it a wonderful mix of sweet and savory.

I liked the taste, followed the directions completely. I thought the topping was too dry so I think I'll try the Panko bread crumbs next time to see if that makes a difference.  

I made this again and didn't like it at all-go figure. It has been two years and maybe my taste buds change. I used aged Swiss this time and that was the only change.  It must have been the Aged Swiss so I'd spend the money and use the Gruyere. I couldn't get past the Swiss cheese smell.

Love it!  Got everything ready, including the squash cooked on top of the stove.  Then put in baking dish and added topping mixed with Panko and also added tarragon instead of thyme!  Fresh Rosemary is the key!

I was a little sceptical of this dish before I made it.  But I wanted to make a butternut squash dish that wasn't so sweet, more savory.  Well this dish was perfect!  I don't know if it was the herbs or what, but it almost tasted like I was eatting stuffing.  It was so good!  I followed the recipe except for I used less gruyere cheese than it called for.  So good!

I made this for a dinner party last night.  It is a lot of work....of course just cutting up a butternut squash takes some time.  After reading other reviews, I didn't add quite as much of the herbs as it called for, so they weren't overwhelming.  I could have added more.  It does make a lot of topping, so next time I am going to try mixing 1/2 of the cheeese herb mixture w/o the breadcrumbs into the squash portion, then add the rest of the cheese mixture w/ the breadcrumbs (used panko!)to the top. I had to make the squash portion ahead of time, so I did it on the stove as the directions stated, then turned it down and put the cover on it. I stirred it occasionally so it wouldn't burn, then left it with the cover on while I went to a football game.  When I had to prepare it, I put it in the casserole dish, and brought it to the party.  I heated it up in the oven then added the topping.  After the cheese melted, I put it under the broiler.  It was very good, and got rave reviews.  For those that complained about the expense....well butternut squash is very inexpensive, I grow my own herbs, so its really just the cheese.  This makes a lot, so it goes a long way and its cheaper than eating out.

I made the recipe as is (i happened to have all of the ingredients on hand amazingly) except panko vs. bread crumbs. I thought it was really good and my non-veggie loving husband loved it! We like thyme and rosemary and didn't find it overpowering. I would agree with other reviews, the expensive cheese could be substituted. I will definitely make this again and have already passed on the recipe to a friend.

Love butternut squash and tried to lighten this up and not add the gruyere and cheddar.  Only used the Parmesan in the crumb topping. I used panko bread crumbs and kindo of felt they were a little too light and delicate for the heaviness of the squash.  I'd like the topping to be more like a crumble with butter/flour. I added sage because butternut is awesome with sage. Oh, and salt and pepper.

I love this dish because my daughter is an ovo lacto vegetarian and I can substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth when I make this for her....very tasty comfort food!

I made this last night for a Pre-Thanksgiving get together and everyone was raving about it!! Almost everyone asked me for the recipe. Little did they know, they were the guinea pigs.  I WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR THANKSGIVING!!! Only thing that I'll do different (and this was my mistake not the recipe) I mixed all the cheeses and bread crumbs in with the squash instead of just pouring it on top.  It still turned out wonderful but looked a little mushy. Can't wait to make this one again.  Tip: ask for the Gruyere cheese from the deli they will cut you off a piece, it ended up being $8 cheeper than buying 2 from the case which would only make one batch, buying from the case I'll actually be able to make 2 more dishes.

This was excellent! I didn't change a thing! My husband who usually won't eat stuff like this, loved it too!! Crust was perfect. Never thought of mixing bread crumbs with the cheese, and the rosemary topped it! Thanks for a great recipe, I will be keeping this one!

This recipe will definitely make it into my repertoire, but it sure takes a long time to make. Save time by peeling and chopping your butternut squash in advance. I used vegetable broth to make this a veggie recipe. It was great!

Maybe I did something wrong- There didn't seem to be enough cheese at all...the topping was good but the squash was pretty bland. I wanted it to be more flavorful.

My husband and guest loved it!  I used 3 cups thawed frozen, home grown, baked butternut squash. Sautéed onion and garlic in the butter, added thawed squash , brown sugar and heated throughout. Scraped the heated mixture into a 1 1/2 quart baking dish, topped with the cheese, bread crumbs and spices mixture. Baked until golden brown. Will definitely make again! No need to use chicken broth using baked and frozen squash

Sooooo good. We made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious.  When I checked it at the 45 minute mark, it still had quite a bit of the liquid at the bottom, so I uncovered it and put it back in for 5 minutes, then added the toppings and continued for 15 more minutes.  It was perfect.  I’ll definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews, I used a larger squash (4 lb) and less cheese (probably 3/4 of recipe given).  When I baked the squash, not all the liquid was absorbed...I just drained it as I was afraid of overcooking the squash.  All-in-all, it's a pretty labor intensive dish.  Thankfully, everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Not sure if I'd make it again.

This is a great accompaniment to poultry, pork or roast beef!    I don’t alter the spices, because it gives the dish a nice savory flavor, but I have skipped the brown sugar when I was out and varied the cheeses used sometimes based on what I have on hand. (For example, 1/4 cup of gorganzola in place of the parmesan worked nicely.) I typically only use 1 1/4 cups of combined cheese to 1 cup breadcrumbs in the topping, unless it’s for Thanksgiving - then I’m totally thankful for all the cheese!

I hesitated to make this because of the negative reviews but there were so many positives so I thought I would give it a try. Not a good choice. I try new recipes very often and love butternut squash and gruyere cheese. I love new and different recipes but this combination was not good. You are wasting your money on the gruyere because you can't even taste it. The parmesan does not go well with the combination of flavors and this dish definitely does not go well with a traditional thanksgiving meal. I love a variety of flavors and cook lots of dishes on this site but this was not even close to the high rating it received. I will not be making this again. Way too much work and money and mediocre taste at best.

This was delicious, BUT I used a round casserole dish instead of 9x13, and the cheese/breadcrumb mixture on the top ended up too thick and became kind of like a hard cracker on top of the squash. When I try this again, I will use a rectangle casserole dish in order to create a thinner layer, and I will take the advice of one of the other reviewers and mix half of the cheese/breadcrumb mixture in with the squash. I also used dried herbs instead of fresh because that's what I had, and the herbs really packed a LOT of punch. So if you're not a huge rosemary/thyme fan (or you're not sure if you are yet), I would say to reduce the amount you add, because the flavor of the herbs is quite powerful. I will definitely try this recipe again, even though it didn't come out perfectly.

I just made it for the first time and it was quite good. I accidentally forgot about the chicken broth, but the squash was totally cooked and delicious I don't think it's really necessary. My store was also out of all fresh herbs so I used a little bit of Herbs de Provence that I had in the pantry. I used my cast iron skillet for the first half as that gives everything such an amazing flavor. Overall this turned out super well and I will make it again. I think next time I'll caramelize the onions rather than just brown them, and I'll double the amount of squash. this was a huge amount of cheese on top and it kind of overwhelmed the proportions of squash. Perhaps increase the bread crumbs by another half cup as well to increase the crunch.

VERY GOOD EASY.  Not difficult ,  usual ingredients on hand,
and nice flavour. I have tried the more involved recipes for 
holiday meals , I like them , but often come back to 
basic squash and enjoy just as much.

Note that I'm a novice in the kitchen. I did sub the cheese which I researched online because the cheese was so expensive. The sub worked well. I also didn't add Rosemary and used dried minced onions and thyme from the bottle. My only confusion came when I chopped up the squash and put it in the bottom of the pan. It didn't fill up the pan in the instructions so I used a smaller square pan and for that it really only provided one "layer" of squash at the bottom of the pan.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was excellent! Requires a lot of time to cook but once it's in the oven there's very little fuss. Don't leave off the topping, it really finishes off the dish.

Great side dish for any day of the week.
My new fav 
I made a bit different by baking the butternut with olive oil first in the pan + foil for 40 min.
Then I browned it as written above and tossed with  the cheese (only used the gryère), herbs, broth and bread crumbs.
Poured all of this in the pan again, no foil this time around.
Put it to "gratin" as mention above as well.
I cut about 20 min of cooking time this way.
Thank you for sharing it.

I made this tonight and it was surprisingly good. I did (of course) make some changes. I'm just that kind of person. I cooked the squash completely stovetop, as I saw suggested, by first sautéing the onions, garlic, and squash, then adding  the broth and cooking until the liquid was absorbed/reduced. I finished it up in the oven after putting in casserole dish and topping with cheese/breadcrumbs. I used about half the cheese called for, and I used whatever I had on hand, which was a cheddar blend. It still was very tasty. Will definitely keep in rotation.

I omitted the Gruyere cheese. I didn't have it  and felt there was plenty of cheese in the recipe without it. I also substituted panko crumbs for regular bread crumbs. The result was fantastic. I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed previous reviewers suggestions: cooked the onions, garlic and butternut squash in a saucepan on the stove. Used half the cheese. Will use panko bread crumbs next time. Really good!

I used pre-cut but fresh butternut squash and then cut it up into smaller pieces.  This turned out awesome and was a big hit for New Year's dinner.  I found a cup of chicken broth to be a bit much though.  This may be due to the fact that I used smaller pieces of squash.  Certainly will make a again!

Rosemary and thyme are great flavors with butternut squash. Hubby who doesn't like squash loved this recipe. For dry bread crumbs I used garlic and butter flavor sourdough croutons, broken into crumbs (placed between two pieces of waxed paper and crushed with  rolling pin.) I didn't have any onions, but it was delicious without.

Extremely good. I had to do a combination of cheeses but was still very good.  The top was a little dry so next time I think I'll spray on some Pam to crisp it up.

This recipe was perfect for fall! I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and did most of the cooking in the pan. I sautéed the onions and garlic then added the squash and brown sugar. I didn't have chicken stock so I used a pumpkin ale. I poured 1 cup into the pan, covered, and cooked for about 15 minutes, until the liquid was absorbed. I transferred the mixture to the baking pan and topped with the cheese, herbs, and breadcrumb mixture. I used a smoked gruyere and herbed breadcrumbs. After 15 minutes in the oven, it was done. So earthy and delicious! I served it with lamb chops and grilled asparagus. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Used about half the cheese and subbed monterey jack for the gruyere, and it still came out great! I'd recommend a little less thyme.

This recipe was tasty, but I felt there was a little too much cheese/breadcrumb mixture.  I think I would prefer to use double the squash amount, or half the topping amount, to let the squash shine through more.

Extremely expensive to make. If recommend doubling on the squash mixture to get a thicker squash layer. Otherwise the breadcrumbs are overpowering.

I love butternut squash, and was totally surprised by the flavors in this dish. Very unique from any other butternut squash recipe I've made before. I forgot to add the brown sugar, but it still had the right amount of sweetness (for my taste) just from the natural sugars caramelizing. Next time I make it, I'll probably omit the brown sugar again. Bonus start because even the kids liked it!

Domestic Gruyere is quite a bit cheaper than imported and works just as well.  Either Gruyere or Emmenthaler have a unique flavor  and melt well.  I can't see substituting another cheese for either of these.  I like the idea of roasting the squash, so much less time consuming.

I thought this was great! Someone gave me a butternut squash  and I had no idea what to do with it so I tried this recipe and loved it. I did take the advise of other reviewers and went with a cheaper cheese blend of Sharp cheddar,  Romano and parmesan cheese. My 9 year old daughter is vegetarian  so  we used veggie stock instead of chicken. We all loved it!

This was very tasty. Even approved by non-squash eaters in my family. I skipped the Gruyere cheese; just used cheddar & Parmesan. Also, because of oven space, I just let the mixture simmer on the stove for 45 minutes to soften & absorb the liquid.  Then toasted the cheese on top for 15 minutes in oven. Great recipe.

Very good but it's a lot of work if using fresh butternut. Also wasn't sure about the amt of cheese to use: 8 oz by weight or volume. I went w/ weight, so about 2 cups ea, but that seemed like a lot of cheese. I'd probably go with volume next time. Other than than it's very tasty. I made it ahead of time and just kept the cheese topping separate until I was ready to bake it all together.

This recipe is soooo good! I recommend it to those who are scared to fix butternut squash and or have others taste it. I fixed it for my husband who has never had butternut squash and he loved it. It is very tasty and rich. Great for Thanksgiving or anytime during the season.

Okay, I just made this for dinner. I have never eaten or cooked butternut squash before. It definitely takes a strong peeler and sharp knife but, oh, is it worth it! The taste and texture are wonderful. I only used sharp cheddar and parmesan (what I had) but I will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight - delicious. I used sharp cheddar and asiago (I always have asiago on hand, it's my favorite cheese and it's close in flavor to Gruyere.) I also added potatos, brown russet that I sliced in thin slices dollar style. I just thought it needed something else. All in all, this was very good.

This was a great recipe.  I added some apples and a bit of sage in the topping.  It had a nice crisp.  Will definitely make this again.

Just ok, turned out bland.  If I were to bake it again I would do it without the bread crumbs

I made this for a labor day get together and it was awesome. I have never had butternut squash before but I definitely loved this recipe. It has a wonderful flavor. I used regular swiss and sharp cheddar to cut cost and it was still wonderful. will definitely make again.
