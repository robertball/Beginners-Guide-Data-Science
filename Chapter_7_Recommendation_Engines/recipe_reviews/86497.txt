This dip is Fabulous!!!  I am from a very large family so I doubled it.  Only 2 things I did different. I only added 1 tsp. of onion powder to the doubled recipe and I cooked 1 Lb. of bacon and added 1 cup of Hormel real bacon.  There was not a bite left at the end of the evening.  I used sliced baguette pieces and Fritos scoops.  One more note, if you forget the onion in this recipe, it is still just as delicious. (I forgot it the second time I made it).  This one is definitely a keeper!! YUM!!! p.s. on this recipe, I would suggest that you use bread to dip this one with, because the Fritos or crackers tend to make it way too salty.  And if you are on a low carb diet, I toast slices of low carb wheat which was just as delicious!

GREAT DIP! Guest will go CRAZY!!  I've made this several times.  I feel the best is when using only half of the mayo/miracle whip and taste before adding all of the seasoning salt.  If you make this the day before; or if it is going to sit a while, it can become too salty from the bacon. Also, seeding the tomato is very important, it becomes much more watery if you don't.

Simple but really good, especially served with cherry tomatoes.  My friends who do low carb diets love it.  And it's even good without the extra seasoned salt and onion powder.

We really loved this dip! Mom and I ran out of crackers and ended up slathering it on bread for lunch the next day.  The flavor combo is wonderful!

YUM!  This is so good!  I used 1/2 cup of Real Bacon Pieces instead of frying bacon and it worked really well for me.

Delicious! I actually had the ingredients on hand. For best taste, it is best to make this the day before serving and allow the flavors to marry overnight in the refrigerator in a covered, airtight container. I use the real bacon pieces from the pouch. Thanks!

I rated this 5 stars because the dip tastes exactly as it's supposed to, like a BLT.  I liked it, so did a few others, but it was passed over by the majority of the crowd.  Our guests seemed to think it "strange" and couldn't get past the "idea" of a BLT dip.  Go figure.......

I made this dip this past Saturday for my aunt. She was meeting with her friends and they loved this dip. I had enough to make a double portion but because of time I was unable to. They devoured this dip. It was set out with my mother in laws salsa dip and my dip was the first to go. Everyone asked for the recipe. I gave it to because it was soooooo simple. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I am a sucker for anything with bacon in it!  I think the key to making it fabulous would be to use yummy garden fresh tomatoes rather than those hard tasteless ones that you find so often at the grocery.  I served with slices of baguette bread and everyone at it up despite the mediocre tomatoes.  Will try again with good tomatoes this summer.

Very good.  I made this in a hurry, before a trip to the beach, and didn't get the tomato or bacon chopped up very fine.  It was good, but I wish the tomato and bacon pieces had been smaller.  I will make sure I remember that the next time I make it.  Also, it is quite salty.  I might decrease the amount of seasoned salt next time.

Update: Sept 23, 2009 When I get invited to a party. They tell me bring the BLT dip or don't come. So I bring because I like to party. Also great for camping, just make and bring bread and Lettuce.  Don't forget the chips. Aug 16, 2009 I made this a couple of weekends ago. Now I am asked to make it again. We loved it. If you love bacon you'll love this.

This is a very easy and different recipe. I thought it was very tasty. I served it with toasted french bread and belgian endive leaves (for the low carb crowd) and it was a hit. I'll definitely make it again.

I gave this four stars only because it was a little too salty. I served with scoops at first, then switched to wheat thins because of the salty taste. It was much better with the crackers.  Will make again, but will use low sodium bacon next time!!!!

This dip is great.  I made this the day of a party after fearing it would be too salty because of other comments.  I actually liked this dip better after it set for a day. I will surely make this again!

I was skeptical at first by the simplicity of the ingredients but it was wonderful! It was gone in the blink of an eye.
