Wow, one of my recipes got posted. Glad you all like it, but it looks like Allrecipes took the liberty to alter it a bit. I don't cook it to 145, that's in the medium + range, I only cook mine to about 122-125.  Also 5-10 minutes in the screaming hot oven is usually enough, you just want a crust on it, you don't want to overcook it. Or if you have your grill going, sear it on all sides on the grill.

145 is way too long for a med rare prime rib. Smoked to 120 IT, oven at 500 for 5 min or until crust is formed. Rested for 25 min, sliced and served.

I have never attempted to cook prime rib but decided that this was the year for me to tackle it.  We have an electric smoker so I followed these directions leaving it uncovered in the fridge during  the prep stage.  It worked perfectly!  The meat was so tender and moist no one needed  a knife.  The taste was fantastic.  Even my very picky 6-year-old grandson loved it and I thought my son-in-law was going to lick the platter.  New holiday dish is on the list!

I made two 7 pound roasts.  Trimmed the bones off and saved the ribs for smoking later. I tied the roasts so that they were more round and even for cooking.  I also poked holes into the roast and inserted whole cloves of garlic throughout.  I used an electric smoker at 200 degrees and smoked with a mix of cherry and a little hickory wood for approx. 3 hours.  Always use a good thermometer though.  I pulled off the smoker at 115 degrees, wrapped in foil and placed into a thermal cooler till the temp got to 123 degrees.  Then I reversed seared directly on a super hot gas grill for about 45 seconds on all sides to create that crispy exterior crust.  This brought the temp up to about 130 degrees and after I let them rest for another 10 minutes, it sliced to perfection. Even pink from end to end with no overcooked parts. The leftovers froze well and I reheated the "prime rib steaks" on a hot gas grill for about 1 minute per side till they were just warmed up.  They were almost better than the original prime rib.  The grilling added more smoky goodness and the grill marks added texture.

Very easy. After browning at 500 I turned the heat down to 225 with the thermometer in and let it get to 140. I am a medium fan so it worked well

This was amazing I made this for xmas and it was the best prime rib I ever ate. Easy to do and you can tweek the receipe if you like I did a little bit but not much and it turned out great smoked with hickory chips in my masterbuilt smoker for about 4 hours then brought in and did the reverse seer in the oven. I highly recommend this receipe.

I cooked a 2.5 lb roast and the flavor was perfect but next time I will reduce or eliminate the oven time as I like my meat pretty rare.  I did 10  minutes in the oven it was overcooked for me.

Excellent.....I make a few slits in the top of the rib to allow the marinade and smoking to sink deeper into the meat!

family loved it. not much talking while everyone was eating because they were too busy repeating "mmmm....keep this recipe". I only tweaked by using sea salt and then scraping off before adding the spices.

I don't ever cook a rib roast beyond 125 degrees internal temperature.  The 145 temp you say to cook it to would be akin to roasting it into a leather belt.  Unless you like your rib roast well done, please don't cook it to that high of an internal temp.

Great, cooked on the grill @225 ( indirect heat) until we hit 130. Turned the grill up to 500. And seared 45 sec. to a min. On all sides.  It’s tough to let it stand for 20-25 minutes. Everyone was like it smells so good. And it was. Christmas dinner was a hit.

I did basically the same but pulled at 120F based on multiple recipes. 145F would be so grossly overcooked it would be ruined. That would end up at 160F. Could be a typo as the roast WILL NOT be at 145F after three hours. My 8.5lb roast took 4 hours to get to 120F in my 225F smoker. Was fantastic, med-rare. It rose to about 130F while I got the oven heated up. If anything I would go a few degrees less, definitely not higher. Good recipe with incorrect temp so 2 stars as people will ruin their meat if followed completely.
