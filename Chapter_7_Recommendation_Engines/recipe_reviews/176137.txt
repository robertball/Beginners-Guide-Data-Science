I make a similar version all the time (Mexican husband!).  I omit the onion & cumin and add Adobo seasoning.  We use 2 small cans tomato sauce & 1 can petite diced tomatoes.  Lime juice and a LOT of cilantro suit our tastes.  GREAT in winter when fresh tomatoes are not the best.  If you like the strong vinegar/acid flavor of supermarket jarred salsa, fresh salsa probably is not for you.  Tweak the recipe to suit your tastes-so fun to change it up!

used 5 fresh roma (plum) tomatoes.  used about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper instead of the ancho (what I had on hand).  I did not seed the chiptole chile and added about 1/2 T of the adobe sauce from the can of peppers.  I also put in about 1/2 T chili powder.  I used a food processor. I'm sure this would have been 5 stars without the changes, but it definitely was 5 stars with the changes. Update: I made 4 different salsas and had the husband try each.  This was the winner (with the above changes) and the one I will be canning!

This was wonderful!  The smokey flavor and great texture reminded me of the fresh salsa you get at a restaurant.  Mild to medium heat but a lot of flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing and plan on making this one often.

For our tastes this recipe required more jalapenos, more chipotles, more garlic, more onion, more cilantro, and more cumin. I'm willing to concede that we may walk on the wild side a bit though :-) I was hoping this would be comparable to jarred salsa or jarred picante sauce but sadly, this recipe as written cannot replace those. The smoky flavor from the chipotles is particularly nice. Thanks for the great jumping off point!

This was my first time ever trying to make salsa.  I followed this recipe, and was very pleased; so was everyone else who tried it.

Very, very good salsa.  This is authentic Mexican salsa, not the jarred stuff with chunks of tomato in it.  Very versatile as well, increase the peppers to increase the heat.  Great with chips or as a sauce with dinner! I can't believe a review said this was not as good as jarred salsa.... what!?!? And salsa (or any other authentic Mexican dish) does not use chili powder... that's strictly an American creation.  Give this salsa a try... quite a bit like what you would get in a Mexican restaurant.

Great recipe. Very versatile.  You can make it hotter or not so hot.  Didn't have ancho chilis so used more jalapenos.  So much cheaper and yummier than the jarred stuff.

I found this rather flat and tasteless.  I had to keep adding salt and sugar to try to balance it out.  I still didn't have much luck with it.  It's not bad, just not great.  I don't think I will be making this again.

I tend to stick with Salsa verde, but this was a good change of pace. I used a bit more adobe sauce to kick it up a notch.  Family loves it, so it passes the test.

The recipe does not call for dicing the peppers and onion before combining with the tomatoes in the blender....Is it recommended that you put them in whole, or am I missing something?

I'm re-writing my review because I made this salsa again and I absolutely loved it this time.  The first time is wasn't quite spicy enough so this time I used a good 2" piece of the ancho pepper and 2 chipotle peppers, unseeded.  It was perfect!

What a wonderful salsa! I've been wondering how to make salsa like this and if I knew how easy it was I'd have made it much earlier.  I didn't have Ancho (I know, I know, it's the first word in the recipe) but I upped the chipotle and garlic.  It was delicious.  Not as spicy as I had anticipated I might even add more chipotle or the jalepeno with seeds next time.  Thanks again!

Salsa was awesome, great smoky flavor from the ancho chipotles.  I used an extra jalapeno to add extra spice and used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  I also like to use red onion and dice it up finely by hand as opposed to putting it into the food processor, I find the food processor pulverizes the onion and releases to much of th juice.

VERY GOOD! The directions were not clear on wether to drain the excess liquid from the tomatoes, so I just put it aside in case I needed it...I did not use it. I did not seed the jalapeno or the chipotle and it gave the salsa an awesome spicy kick. Also, I omitted the cilantro due to personal preference. I'm a huge fan of chipotle, and this had a wonderful smokey flavor that we loved. In case anyone is wondering, this is not a thick, chunky salsa, but more of a medium consistancy. I think this would also be great as a 'taco sauce' type condiment. We REALLY enjoyed this and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good bit of heat and smokiness.  The consistency was good, but a bit too watery.  The flavor was right and I always love cilantro. Watch out though, this stuff sticks with you.

I'd rate it 5 stars except there was way too much cilantro for my tastes.  Made it to-the-letter the first time and the flavor was overpowering.  The second time, I cut back on cilantro to about 1/2 tsp. and also doubled the chipotle peppers for a smokier taste.  With those two changes it was excellent.

I used to live in Mexico and this recipe is very similar to what my Mexican mom would make.  I couldn't find ancho chiles at the local market so I substituted 1/4 tsp. of dried ancho spice.  Word of advice - I only had tomatoes with green chilis.  I DO NOT recommend using these as it made the salsa way too spicy for some.

Yum!  SO good and easy!  I am serving this for company tonight and will definitely be making it again!  The only thing I did differently was I used diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the whole tomatoes and I didn't seed the chipotle chile, but the spiciness is just right for our tastes!

I love this recipe! We have allergies in the family and this allows me to work around that and the taste is delicious. Plus I get to kick up the heat! I use powdered onion instead of fresh (that's the allergy issue), double the garlic, and add crushed red pepper flakes in place of the last pepper option. We have friends that ask for me to save them some when I make large batches. This is the real deal. Great recipe!

This is the best salsa I've ever tasted! When I plant my jalapenos each year, all I can thinking about is picking them so I can make more salsa-- but that's not to say that I've never made it with supermarket jalapenos. It's amazing either way. Make it the day before so that the flavor from those bits of dried ancho can seep into the mix. Just writing this makes me want to make another batch. Always double it. Always. Throw in a few fresh tomatoes if you like. Or substitute fresh for the canned altogether. Either way, it is SO SO GOOD!

Using the Chipotle in Adobo brings a rich smokiness that you will miss if you do not grab a can of them to use.  Once small can has several of them in it.  I also spoon another flat tablespoon of the Adobo Sauce from the can into the salsa.  You do not need to cut the tomatoes if you use canned ones.  Fresh plum tomatoes will need pare boiling and peeling. I split the jalapeno in half lengthwise, seeded, and the sliced it crosswise before tossing it in.  I laos leave out the gringos cumin.  You can also substitute lime juice for lemon juice.  The first step should be to cut off a 1 inch piece of the Ancho and sliver it and then put it in a small sauce cup (I use those all the time to prep my spices) and add the juice and let it sit while you prep the rest and put it in the food processor or blender.  Use a blender will yield a nicer chunkier style.  Mine blender was still being washed when I made another batch.  Use a blender on Pulse.  Ancho Peppers are actually cheaper the Jalapenos unlike falsely stated.  Even at a fancy store you can get a bag of a dozen for $4 which works out to a quarter each and the Jalapeno cost me $0.79.  If you use the Adobo sauce you will never miss the cumin.  This is salsa not lentil soup or mole sauce.  PS American Lentil soup is junk!  Make it Mediterranean style with spices.

One of the best salsa recipes I've EVER tasted. Same day my husband and I made 3 other salsas (exhausting) and this is the only one we didn't have to make any changes to.

This was okay but but there seems to be a specific flavor I'm trying to get for a chipotle salsa and can't figure it out. So, that doesn't mean this isn't good, it's just not "it". I could not find whole anchos anywhere, so used ancho powder instead. I left the seeds in the chipotle and used fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned. It was missing something for me and not quite the flavor I'm trying to get to. A little to much garlic flavor for me. The heat builds but I would call it med to med-hot salsa.

Perfection. Thank you so much.
