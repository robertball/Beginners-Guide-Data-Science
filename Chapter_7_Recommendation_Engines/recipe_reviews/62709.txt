Interesting combination of flavors, the crust was excellent, the filling was ok, although I couldn't finish even eating mine.  I served to 2 guests that are cheesecake buffs and they were not overly impressed either.  Cost of saffron aside, I wont be making this again but I will be experimenting with fillings I can try the crust with!
