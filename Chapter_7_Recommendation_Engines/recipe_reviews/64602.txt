WOw...pretty tasty!  I liked the fact they are baked rather than fried.  They were also nice and crispy.  I will make again!

The flavor was great, but I, like other reviewers, could not get the crumb coating to stick to the egg/onion. I finally just dumped a pile of crumbs over the layer of onion rings and baked that way.

Great onion ring flavor without all the grease! I had a lot of coating left over (only used 1 onion for 2 people), so I let the first cornflake coating dry a bit, then dipped and coated a second layer, then baked per directions. They were extra crispy and tasty! I would spray the cookie sheet with cooking spray before putting the onion rings on it...some of mine stuck. My husband asked for them again. Thanks!

These were excellent! I did them rather quickly so they weren't exactly fully coated, but that was fine. I couldn't believe how close they tasted to their deep-fried evil counsins - fantastic! Thanks!!!!

I don't know what went wrong.  First of all there didn't seem to be enough corn flake coating for 2 onions (I followed the recipe exactly except a different brand of seasoning) My crumb coating turned into a gooey paste....enough so that I just tossed the whole thing and made frozen french fries instead. Had more coating on my fingers and under my fingernails than on an onion ring.  If anyone can tell me what could of happened I would appreciate it.  Would like to try this again because of the good reviews and I live bake vs fried.

For as nasty as these were, next time you make onion rings, fry them and do an extra workout to burn off the fat. It'll be worth it.

These weren't bad. My mum liked them a lot better than I did. I found that the crumbs didn't stick very well to the onions. Maybe I just need to practice. I would probably make them again.
