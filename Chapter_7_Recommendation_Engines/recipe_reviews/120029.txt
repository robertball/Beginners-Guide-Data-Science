Wonderful!  I made a few modifications, doubled the eggs and the cream, traded the bacon for prosciutto and a bit of nutmeg.  Added a little baking time too, in the range of about 12 minutes in a deep dish pie pan. :)

This recipe is so easy and versatile.  I have replaced asparagus and swiss with broccoli and cheddar and it comes out great as well.  I also double the egg and cream since my pie dish is deep, the quiche comes out perfect every time.

This recipe turns out every time, just as written. It also keeps well for awhile in the fridge and leftovers can be microwaved, and I like that you can use the basic egg, flour, 1/2 and 1/2,  salt, pepper and cheese amounts and add whatever else you like best for veggies and meat - I use 1/2 cup chopped coooked ham, 5 or 6 stalks of aspargus trimmed (if i have some), and I use a mixture of gruyere (if on hand) and swiss cheese- and  about 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg adds a lot to the taste.

This turns out fabulous and looks pretty.  I have used chicken in place of the bacon and that works, too.

This was a excellent quiche!  I did splurge and use Swiss Gruyere cheese which was really yummy.  When I do it again, I will saute the onions with the bacon and calm their flavor a bit.  I also added more eggs and 1/2 and 1/2 and added red peppers to the top for more veggies and garnish.  With the bacon and the cheese, I would eliminate adding any extra salt next time.

This quiche is great! I used mozzarella instead of swiss for a less potent flavor and I didn't use any bacon. Use plenty of asparagus, and let it cool before mixing with the cheese - it will melt and prohibit it from even distribution. I froze one after baking and it was great reheated a week later!

yummy! Only thing I didnt like is how long it took. I think next time ill prep the ingredients the night before and combine them into the crust to bake the next morning.  btw: instead of suggested crust, i bought a container of croissant dough and spread the triangles of dough into my pie pan, pushed it together to seal. and wah-la! pour ingrediants into pan. no pre-baking crust needed.

Add more asparagus! Chop some rather finely and mix into filling otherwise not everyone gets some. Also I saut√©ed  the asparagus with butter and added chopped onions which were delicious.

This was pretty good.  I did add an extra egg and a little extra cream, as others suggested.  I also did a homemade crust -can't stand the cardboard factory made ones.

I loved making this for my mother for Mother's Day. She loves Asparagus, and loves quiche. I made a homemade pie crust, and this recipe was so easy to follow. I will definitely be making again!

I love thid recipe. It is one of my favorites. I mix it up a lot switching out asparagas for ham/ brocoli/ you name it and it works well. The only thing I do is double the entire ting to make a thicker more hearty quiche. And when I do make one I have to make at least 2 because they go so fast!. Great camping food by the way make a couple and you have a fantastic breakfast in the woods, Very good eaten cold. YUM Can't say enough good things about this dish. Try it. I dare ya :)

This was such a huge hit at our baby shower! It looked pretty and tasted great...got a lot of ooohs and aaahs for a little effort. The flavors of the bacon and asparagus really complimented one another. I made one with a frozen shell and one with a roll out shell from the dairy section, and the latter tasted better.

This is a great base recipe. I make some tweaks in it though. I am not a big fan of Swiss cheese, so I use a mixture of cheddar and mozzerella. Also, instead of just mixing it in with the mixture, I put some on top. I also double the amount of eggs and half and half, as this recipe does not seem to have enough eggs. Just note if you increase the egg and half&half that you must increase your cooking time by 10 - 15 minutes, atleast.

The absolute best.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  Instead of boiling asparagus, I sauteed it, as well as the onions in a bit of bacon grease.  Oh yum! 
Apparently I chopped too many ingredients so I split it between two redi-made marie callendar crusts and mixed up another 3 eggs with 1/2 cup cream.  
They took 45 minutes to cook, most likely longer due to the fact I had two in the oven instead of one.
Surprisingly, my husband absolutely loved it, me too.  I planned on freezing the 2nd one, but I've been eating it for breakfast instead!  
Will make again and again!

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the eggs and half and half- actually I used milk as it was all I had.  My bacon was very thick cut so I only used 5 strips. I also doubled the shredded Swiss, onion and flour. My pie dish is a deep dish and this filled it nicely. I really didn't miss the half and half- the extra cheese added richness.

This recipe was a little high in fat for us, so I did some substitutions.  Turkey bacon, no pie crust, evaporated milk and fat free cream cheese.  I also used just 2 whole eggs and four egg whites.  I got the fat count down to less than 6 grams of fat per serving.  It was still the most amazing thing ever!!!  It was gone in 5 minutes out of the oven!

This was excellent and a great way to use up fresh asparagus.  I only used 3 slices of bacon and used cheddar rather than swiss because that was what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great way to prepare asparagus other than grilling.  I only had cheddar cheese and didn't use a crust.  Those were the only changes I made, and it came out great.  I was worried that it might not cut properly without a crust, but I had nothing to worry about since I greased my pan.  This recipe is flexible to mix-ins as you can tell from other reviewers' comments about adding broccoli, spinach, etc.

I made this using Martha Stewart's recipe for Pate Brisee.  I used a 10" pie pan so I needed to add more egg and half & half.  If I hadn't of used the extra eggs I think it wouldn't have been eggy enough.  I suggest garnishing with the same amount of asparagus spears at the number of people that you are serving.  That way an asparagus spear would be center on each serving.  My husband thought this had too much asparagus, so I can't imagine what he would have thought if he would have had it prepared without the extra eggs.

We really enjoyed this, I used bacon bits (as too lazy and time was short to thaw and cook real bacon) and you could not tell that it was not cooked bacon. It turned out great, we all enjoyed it, I didn't have half and half cream, so used a bit of milk and double cream...we really enjoyed this and will make it again.

This was a very good recipe! I didn't have bacon so I left it out, and I used whole milk instead of half and half. I also added wilted spinach and sauteed mushrooms. It was delicious!

I made this for my mother and daughters for a girls day breakfast!  They absolutely loved it!!  I did have to add 2 more eggs and 1/4 cup more cream because the recipes egg mixture came up short for completely filling the pie crust.  This is a wonderful combination of flavors and a new favorite that I expect to make over and over in the future!!

VERY good recipe.  I used what I had on hand (green onion instead of white) and I added mushrooms and used pre-cooked bacon.  My husband thought it had too much asparagus but after all it is an asparagus quiche :)  will make again but cut back on the asparagus.

Made it for Valentine's Day lunch, but made it the day before.  Used Morningstar vegetarian bacon because we're both vegetarian (and it made it much healthier).  It was delicious, and hubby LOVED it-- said it was the best quiche he's ever had!

This is an outstanding quiche and I always have request for more. The only thing that I modify is to use a deep dish 9 inch pie pan - it makes a lot, so it tends to run over the sides in a regular one. I increase the baking time by about 6 minutes. Thanks for a keeper!

Everyone in my house loved this from my 16 month old daughter to my husband.  Very flavorful and great the second day!

I used diced ham instead of bacon and it was very good.  Also, would suggest using a deep dish pie crust or 2 regular pie crusts.

Brought this to a dinner party (with family, so I got REAL honest feedback) and it got RAVE reviews! Very yummy!
You can put just about anything in it, clean out the fridge!

Thanks for a great recipe!

I did not use bacon, instead I sauteed the onion in olive oil, and then when it was already fairly soft I added the asparagus. I add a few teaspoons of water to the pan, partly covered it, and cooked for 3 minutes or so. I then added this to the egg mixture (I didn't have half and half so I used evaporated milk) and use Monterey Jack because I did not have swiss. I used Grandma's secret pie crust on this site. It was delicious. Thanks!

Very good. I made my own pie crust and used sharp cheddar instead of Swiss cheese. We don't eat bacon so I just added about 6 oz of thawed, drained frozen cut leaf spinach. The asparagus spears on top make a very attractive presentation. Will make again. 

UPDATE: I made this again for the second time in a week and this time I pre-baked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes. I switched the cheddar and used pepper jack. Also added some garlic powder to the filling. Baked the whole thing at 350 and increased the baking time by 15 minutes. This turned out really well.

My son and I put this together - almost to the T, except we had to add another egg.  It was very good but it wasn't what I'd call the "best ever."  I may try to tweak it next time - with a touch of nutmeg, vary some other cheeses in there.  We made it in a quiche dish and it was just adorable!

This was great!  Like a few others, I made a few substitutions based on what I had in the kitchen (used cheddar instead of swiss, red & orange peppers instead of asparagus, added mushrooms, and used milk instead of cream + 2x the eggs) - but it turned out great.  Having the bacon and cheese in the bottom was great and made it so much prettier with the pepper slices arranged on top, and the flour to soak up the rest of the bacon grease is brilliant.  My husband lost it over this, and as we have backyard chickens this helps with the too-many-eggs situation!

Our family loved it!  I took the easy route with a refrigerated pie crust, added chopped red pepper to the sauteed onion & steamed both 5-10 mins, and as others suggested, added more eggs and milk.

Quiche was good.  I did not have onion so I substituted garlic.  I also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  I would use less asparagus next time.

I made this for my mom on Mother's Day, and she really enjoyed it I left out the bacon since we were making meat as a side dish, but it turned out amazing anyway! It was more light and spring-like than a typical ham and cheese quiche, I will definitely be making this again.

We made this with canadian bacon, a mixture of cheddar and monterey jack cheese, and milk instead of cream.  I needed to use the asparagus before it went bad so we used what we had.  As another person noted it is a very versatile recipe! The quiche was fantastic!! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing it!!

I was asked to bring a veggie dish to a family gathering recently and wanted to incorporate asparagus-

This recipe is wonderful- the taste is amazing.  I prepared the recipe as instructed and it came out perfect.  Everyone loved it!  Good cheese taste and the bacon wasn't overwhelming.  I would like to substitute Gruyere cheese on the next trial.

This is a keeper... good all day long!

I have made this several times and it always turns out great!!  It may seem light the egg mixture is not enought but it will puff up and rise to the top... We've had it for brunch and also made it for a light dinner with a mixed greens salad on the side... delicious!

Added extra cream and an extra pinch of salt and pepper. Delicious!

I had to make this last minute - two of them... Used 2 frozen deep pie shells - thawed - pre-baked and when ready made this.  I doubled the recipe to make two quiche - my boss wanted no meat - so used only chopped red onion and beautiful asparagus deep green and thick with purple ends from whole foods - I always use heavy cream with the quiches I make so did make that sub.  I had to have these on the table immediately - so cranked up the heat and hoped upon hope - at 400 they were done only when totally puffed up in the middle - even though it looked totally done - the middle took awhile to rise and puff.  When it did I pulled them out - my boss needing them for 8 guests... While a tiny bit over brown I cut each one into 4 wedges - for 8 servings - thought the bottom was a wee bit doughy - maybe cuz I didn't cool the pre-baked frozen shells?  Anyway - they still looked great with the asparagus garnish and the thick chunky wedge - garnished with a fresh berry mint salad on the side... Long story short the Boss and company RAVED... even without bacon - said they each wished they could eat the whole pie themselves!  Even now 2 days past the event they are still raving...

This was great!  Used "Stripples" instead of bacon as I am vegetarian, but didn't change anything else.  My husband and I loved it.

Excellent recipe - didn't change a thing! I made this for Easter brunch and it was a big hit. The recipe makes a lot of filling - could have split it into 2 quiches or use a deeper pie crust. Very good!

Asparagus is my husband's favorite vegetables, and this is a real favorite at our home.  When asparagus is in season, I make this once a week.

This was really great.  I omitted the bacon and added a few extra veggies and we loved it.

I had my friends over for brunch the weekend of Christmas.  This quiche was a hit with all...even my 16 yr old Son enjoyed the leftovers!  I know I'll make it again and again and again!
