This dessert is fantastic! It really does melt in your mouth.  I would suggest using about 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs for the crust. One and a half almost didn't cover the bottom of the dish for me.

OMG! This is fabulous. I used an entire cup of chunky peanut butter to make sure you could taste it with the chocolate. I wouldn't advise using any less. This was put out for a potluck & gone in under an hour. Fans of chocolate/peanut butter will love this.

This is a delicious recipe. It makes a lot! I used a 15"x10" instead of 9"x13". I made it for July 4th and the whole pan was devoured. Also, I didn't have the graham cracker crumbs, so I used crushed pretzels instead. It worked out wonderfully!!

Great dessert, and leaves lots of room for variation. I baked the graham crackers in the oven for 10 minutes to give it some strength. Then layered sliced bananas before the peanut butter filling. I used a full cup of peanut butter as reviews suggested. I used sugar free instant pudding and light cool whip to lower the sugar. Was a total hit with the family.

I made it for a party this past weekend - DELICIOUS!!!  I followed directions EXACT and it came out great.  The only thing that I added was I did refrigerate the pan between adding layers, so that the ingredients would chill and firm up before spreading the next layer on.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

i would have taken a picture of this recipe but it was gone too quickly.  My family loved this and it was gone before lunch the next day.  The only thing i did differently was at the end i didnt have any peanuts so i used sliced and crushed almonds and i also didnt have any chocolate to shave so i used mini chocolate chips...very pretty dessert not to mention so yummy!  Will definetly make again and again.

This should be renamed the Nutty Buddy dessert.  It was easy to make - and tasted good, but not wonderful.  I loved the crust though.  I think next time I might freeze it for a more ice cream like texture. Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loves this recipe. My Aunt Ann used to make this when I was a little girl. I make it for my kids now. I don't use graham cracker crumbs though. Prefer to make the crust with the same amount of flour.

Very good!  I really wanted to do a strong chocolate/PB combo, so I used crushed oreos for the crust instead of graham cracker crumbs.  I used about 18 oreos and left out the white sugar, upped the butter by 1 Tbsp.  Next time, I will actually up the oreos and butter for more crust!  It was delish.  I also used crushed oreos for the topping instead of grated chocolate as well as crushed peanuts.  Additionally, per other's comments, I used 1 cup of PB instead of 1/3, and used crunchy.  I would even consider more PB next time ;)  I thought it turned out like a chocolate/PB version of "dirt"!

This was pretty good but somewhat like many other recipes of this type I've tried. The only thing I changed was to double the peanut butter. It is easy, makes a nice presentation and makes lots of servings, so it's perfect for potlucks, etc. I'll probably make it again, but not often.

Nice, subtle peanut butter flavor, not overpowering.  Instead of a soggy graham cracker crust, try using 1 cube softened margarine, 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or peanuts.  Mix ingredients with your hands until well mixed and press into bottom of the 9 x 13-inch pan.  Bake at 375F. for about 12 minutes until light golden brown.  Let crust cool before adding the next layer. This is truly delicious!!

Good Stuff!  This dessert was a huge hit at a recent gathering.  I used sugar free pudding mixes and light whipped topping to lighten it up a bit.

I made this for the first time for a family get together and everyone absolutely loved it!  I love chocolate and peanut butter and this dessert did not disappoint.  I did bake the crust which definitely helped. I also let It set up in the refrigerator in between layers. That made it a lot easier to spread the different layers.   I wanted to take a picture but it was gone before I knew it!  I will definitely make this again!

This was a great treat :) I made it for my dad who is not a huge peanut butter fan and I was afraid that he wouldn't like it... the p.b. taste was just subtle enough for him! He loved it :)

I would suggest anyone making this dessert to use either cooked pudding or refrigerated store-bought pudding if you're not going to eat it right away.  I made this the night before I was serving it, and the instant pudding settled a bit & became watery.  I also put m&m's on top.  It was really good, though!

This recipe is fabulous! I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/3 and it was just right. I wouldn't add more. I'll be making this again and again!

I loved this dessert - maybe a little too much as I ate most of it myself!  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Tastes like a Nutty Buddy cone!  I was a little hesitant about the ingredients - I thought it might be too sweet, but it's not.  This really is a delicious dessert - very light and fluffy, perfect for summer.  It's also very quick to assemble.

This is delicious. We're peanut butter fiends in this house, so I upped the pb to somewhere near a full cup, and we're devouring it at an alarming rate.

We didn't have cool whip so I made homemade whip cream from whipping cream (which is probably better) it was very delicious! Everyone gobbled it up. Used extra graham crackers because we love the graham cracker crust. Will defiantly make this again!
*It made a lot so we used a 9x13 instead of a pie plate and it worked just fine.*

This the the most beloved dessert in this house! Made as is...it's perfection. We think the peanut butter layer tastes like the cream in a nutter butter! I don't know how that person had trouble with it...it spreads easily and is just wonderful! I repeat this dessert at least once a month!

This really is a crowd pleaser.  It's not fancy or high brow; but, it is the kind of dish you bring to a gathering hoping some will be left to take home and you go home with a clean pan instead.  Next time I will make two.  One for home and one for the party goers.

I made this to take for dessert when we had dinner with some friends.  My friend's boyfriend is a chef who normally doesn't eat too many sweets.  He loved it and and a second helping.  I used reduced fat peanut butter and low fat cream cheese and it was delicious.  I would definitely make again.

Not bad.  I think it needed more pudding.  I'll make it again because it was so simple, different, and most of my family enjoyed it.  Thanks for something new.  I do love Jimmy Carter more than this dessert, though.  :)

This was great.  I used sugar free puddings and almond milk (trying to cut back on calories and sugar.). Definitely use 2 cups graham cracker crumbs.  Instead of peanuts for garnish I used a combination of walnuts and pecans.   I don’t like the texture of chopped peanuts.  (Sorry President Carter;-)

This is SO good!  As recommended by others, I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup.  I increased the graham cracker crumbs to 2 cups and added a little extra melted butter.  I took this to a family gathering and brought home an empty pan.  Everyone loved it.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Great for a crowd. I would use a dairy free whipped topping to reduce the dairy the next time though.

I made this for my mothers 76th birthday. It was much easier than I expected and the whole family was there and everyone LOVED it. In fact they want me to make it again when I go back next week. That says a  lot because my family does not eat much sugar at all.  I will absolutely make this again as I said before and will make it or any pot luck or picnic my family goes to.

Easy preparation produces an impressive dessert.
My one change:  instead of a graham cracker crust, I crushed peanut butter pretzel nuggets.  It was a big hit.

I took suggestion of other reviewers and added more peanut butter to peanut butter layer. I have made twice now. Both times were a major hit with company but most importantly my hubby who is not a dessert lover nor a pudding lover gobbled this up and asked for more. This last time I topped it with peanuts and chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cup then drizzled with Reese's peanut butter topping. It is a crowd pleaser...the men seem to love it!

Excellent easy dessert!  I used crushed Oreos for the crust instead of graham cracker crumbs and deleted the sugar.  I baked the crust at 350 for 8 minutes and it was a bit hard to cut through, so evidently that was too long.  The dessert went together quickly and got rave reviews from extended family.

This was so good! I didn't think it was going to turn out because as I was sampling it while making it, it just tasted like cream cheese. But this was SOOOOOO good!!! I made it a day ahead and I think it just needed to sit overnight, but I understand when people say it's bland because it tastes that way when you make it, it's probably just one of those things that gets better after a day kinda like chili is better in day two. Well worth the effort and this dish was gone!! Everyone wanted leftovers, too bad there wasn't any!

My entire family went crazy for this at our Christmas gathering.  I made it EXACTLY as instructed 24 hours in advance and it turned out perfect.  Add the chopped nuts just prior to serving. This is a fantastic dessert for those who like lighter, creamy desserts.  For those new to the kitchen, you need to mix the puddings in the milk until it thickens (2 mins) before pouring onto the peanut butter mix.

I made this for Christmas dessert and it was fantastic. I followed other reviewers suggestions and let each layer set in the frig for a few minutes before adding the next layer and it turned out perfectly. It makes a lot so is good for a crowd. Will definitely make again!

Need more butter for the crust. I would like it to have more peanut butter flavor though. Next time I will use more peanut butter.

I thought this was fantastic!  I loved the creamy peanut butter center balanced by the chocolate pudding and whip cream. I barely changed the recipe, but what I did do was only make a half-batch into a pie.  I baked the shell 12 minutes, but I think it would be fine w/o baking.  I used only 1 pkg of chocolate pudding, and omitted the vanilla.  Finally, for the topping, I crushed semi-sweet chocolate chips and pecans for a crunchy top.  Make it again?  I cannot wait!

I liked this dessert but did not love it. I melted some peanut butter and sprinkled on top with some mini chocolate chips. Made it look even more delicious. Crowd I brought this to loved it.

This was good - just nothing special.  I expected the peanut butter to give it an extra kick, but it mostly just tasted like pudding anyway.  I wouldn't serve it to guests.
