SO tangy and zesty. My kids loved it!Marinated for an hour. Then I baked it in the oven, with juice, and it made it very moist. Also, I topped with crumbled feta cheese during the last 10 minutes. Steamed broccoli to eat with it. DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe for myself last night and it was so delicious that I am making it again tonight for my husband. My grill was out of gas, so I sauteed the chicken in a pan in the marinade. It turned out crispy and yummy! Very easy to make and had all the ingredients! Will definately make this again!

Good, but wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be... Next time I'll marinate it for longer than 20 minutes.

This was the best chicken ever!  I wished we had made more and we will definitely be making it again. We only marinated for 30 minutes, it is important to remember that with an acid based marinade (lemon is an acid) going over an hour will make chicken tough!!  Google it !

Great flavors - and so easy! I was worried - because dinner plans changed, so the chicken ended up being marinated over 24 hrs (we ate it the next night), but the flavor was great! Everyone enjoyed it! Thank you!

FANTASTIC!  I only had time to marinade for 20 minutes and it was still great.  I also used some of the marinade on zucchini and grilled it.

Very good,  I pounded the chicken down a bit and I left out the red pepper.  I put everything into a zip loc bag and let it marinate all day.  The dijon definitely overpowered the lemon, but it was tangy and delicious.

This dish was excellent and so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked instead of grilled, and I also added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I let the chicken marinate for about 2 hours, turning once.  I lined my baking tray with foil (lightly greased) and covered and baked chicken for 20-25 minutes at 350.  I then removed foil cover and took the "basting mixture" and spooned mixture over the top of the chicken (making sure to have plenty of red bell pepper and garlic pieces on top of the chicken) and returned to oven to bake for approximately 10 more minutes; towards the end I set the oven to broil for just a couple minutes to brown for color and crisp up the tops.  This chicken turned out so moist and flavorful.  I read many reviews that said they did not have a red bell pepper, and therefore did not include it.  I'm sure it tastes delicious both ways, but in my opinion, using the finely chopped red bell pepper adds so much flavor!  I couldn't imagine this dish without it (maybe it's b/c I purposefully spooned on a plentiful amount when I put the extra mixture over the chicken).  Either way, this was a definite hit in my house and I will be making again!  Thanks for sharing!

It had a decent lemon flavor but the dijon mustard was so overpowering.  I gave it an extra star because it was so easy but I won't be making this again.  thanks anyway!

Very easy to make. The flavor is very good for such little time marinating, I was impressed. I will most definately be making this one again, it can be made on a whim and still taste great.

I've been making this for years except I use rosemary and not the red pepper. I double the marinade and reserve half for a dressing. Cool and cut grilled chicken, add to pasta (I use tri color rotini), sun dried tomatoes, grilled red peppers, and some grated mozarella cheese. Add reserved dressing and toss to coat. One of my family's favorites!

I only made this with 2 chicken breast and scaled down. I used more lemon juice and less mustard, reading other reviews who said the mustard over powerd the taste. I also made the marinade in the morining and let it sit all day in the frige. Came out amazing with great lemon flavor! will b making this again and again!

Been through hundreds of lemon-based chicken marinades over the past few months. This was objectively the tastiest.

I made this for my husband and I. I adjusted the recipe as I was missing some ingredients. Is used regular mustard at the same quantity and I used added some hot sauce instead of the red peppers. Marinated drumsticks with out skin for about 4 hours and it turned out great on the grill. Will be making this again.

This was very tasty!  We baked in the oven @ 385 for about 50 mins., could have been less by flattening the chicken.  Will do again

Hi gang, I was invited to a friends house last night to cook out on the grill with her, we made this chicken (used thighs instead of breasts) and it was amazing.  We followed the marinade recipe exactly and it came out moist, tender and very flavorful.  Everyone at dinner commented on how good the chicken tasted.  This will be my new grilled chicken recipe forever.  Grilled chicken usually comes out dry but this was delish!!! Thanks for the recipe.

Though it isn't my favorite, it was really really good. It definitely deserves being repeated. I did make one change, instead of throwing away the marinade, I cooked it, then used it as a sauce. I also found out the chicken tasted good with soy sauce as a dipping sauce instead.

Absolutely awesome lemon chicken!! I didn't have the bell pepper but did add red pepper flake and a pinch of rosemary.  It was too cold to grill, so I roasted  the chicken in the marinade in the oven, finishing them up under the broiler.  Moist, flavorful with just the right amount of lemon.  Loved the mustard in the background too.  I spooned the pan juices over the chicken as a delicious sauce.

Yum!! I made this following the recipe exactly, even adding the red bell peppers some others skipped. They gave a nice subtle flavor and eye appeal. This is the best, restaurant quality, chicken that I have ever tasted. It was so moist and tasty. The lemon flavor was great without being overpowering, and I wouldn't change a thing. Oh, actually, I did. Our grill is on it's last leg, and I tend to burn everything I grill anyway. Plus, it's below freezing out. So, I just simmered the chicken, with the marinade, in a skillet, for about 7 minutes on each side. (flattened breasts) I will be making this over and over again!!

When you cook out in zero degree weather, it better be good....this was.  I have never been able to make something as simple as lemon chicken taste very good.  I don't even like the brand of dijon I used and it was still very tasty and oh so easy.

This was wonderful on bone in chicken breast and chicken leg quarters.  I added 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar and 2 Tbsp minced garlic.  Pierced the chicken with a fork to allow the marinade to  seep in and allowed it to sit in the fridge 2 hours.  Dry the chicken thoroughly with paper towels before grilling to prevent flame flare ups.Fabulous on the grill.  Sear the chicken on high heat for 3 min per side, then cook over indirect heat with other burners on low for 8 min per side.  Came out excellent!  Nice roasted chicken on the grill was juicy and lemony. This will be my go to recipe for grilled bone in chicken   Thanks for a great recipe that works wonders on budget friendly chicken legs.  This one's a keeper!

My husband absolutely loved this! I had legs with skin on and marinated for an hour. Used hot pepper flakes rather than pepper. The only problem we had was flare ups on the grill so I recommend cooking with indirect heat if using skin on chicken. I am making it again tonight but doubled the recipe as there were no leftovers the first time I made it!

This had a lot of potential.  Like other reviewers, I omitted the red pepper.  I marinated it for about an hour and a half and it was very moist.  I used a cast iron grill pan instead of the grill and it turned out kind of soft.  If I'd used our gas grill, I'm sure it would have been nicely charred.  The flavor was good, although a bit heavy on the mustard.  I will try it again, though.  This leftovers will be good cut up and tossed in a salad.

Loved the flavor and how easy it was to put together!  I marinated in a baggie for about 30 minutes but will do it longer next time.  I loved the tangy mustard/lemon flavor.   I had to run my daughter to soccer practice so I baked instead of grilling and it turned out great - very tender and juicy.  Can't wait to try it grilled next time!

This was very good.  I marinated the chicken for longer than 20 minutes and cooked them on my George Foreman Grill.  Very juicy and flavorful chicken!

Delicious!  I have made this recipe for years now, and it comes out well every time.  I have never bothered to use the bell peppers nor have I ever grilled it.  I let the chicken marinate over night and bake it until golden brown.

I love this recipe. It is easy, I always have the ingredients on hand, and I NEVER throw away the marinade. Instead, I drain and cook it, then brush it over the chicken as it grills. Wonderful.

I didn't have read bell pepper on hand so I omitted that one ingredient.  It was still really great chicken and pretty easy to make as well.  I will be entering this into the dinner rotations at our house.

The marinade is excellent.   Save about half of the marinade to use as a drizzle over the grilled chicken, ie after the chicken is cooked.  Of course, do not use the marinade in which the chicken had been placed before grilling.  Or make a second batch just for post-grilling flavor.

I used all the ingredients except red pepper, marinated the chicken in them for 30 minutes then poured the marinade in a pan and sauteed the chicken in it for about 8 minutes each side on med-high heat. The pieces were pretty thick so just sautee until slightly browned and obviously not pink in the middle! I sauteed to the point where the chicken had soaked up everything just leaving the oil in the pan and the pieces were delicious! Juicy and flavorful, will definately make again!

For some reason this was not flavorful enough for us. I used the George Foreman which kept it juicy, but my husband and I both thought it was lacking. Maybe the spices needed to be doubled? Not sure. I won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe with excellent flavor and super simple to make! I followed the recipe but did add some dried thyme and some crushed red pepper to the marinade to give the chicken some punch. I will make this again for sure!

This was so easy, and so delicious.  I had everything on hand, and marinated the meat for just over half an hour. I then grilled the boneless skinless chicken breasts on the bbque, and they turned out moist, flavourful, and simply wonderful.

This is the first time I am writing a review, because this was outstanding. I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the mustard. I also only had spicy brown mustard (not technically Dijon). I used my garlic press rather than chopping the cloves, and I left out the red pepper as I did not have any. Threw it on the grill, and this was amazing. Good flavor, and just the right amount of tang! I will definitely make this again.

This was very easy, I was able to make it completely drunk, and use the cook times of 8 minutes a side on the chicken, and it came out PERFECTLY cooked, I served it with instant mashed potatoes, and cheesy broccoli rice, The grill was still going hot so I made three cheese burgers, then I mixed in the leftover mashed potatoes with some leftover pot roast, I managed to get the lefte-overs covered before passing out.

Delicious marinade!  Next time I'll make some extra marinade to use for other sides and even as extra sauce for the chicken after grilling.  I served this dish with some rice pilaf and the Grilled Garlic Parmesan Zucchini recipe from this site, and all were big hits.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Pretty good- I like dijon, so the heavy dose did not bother me.  Do NOT marinade for longer than 30 minutes or so- it will make chicken tough!  Reserve a little to pour over the hot grilled chicken.

Excellent!  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours.  I used a teaspoon or so of lemon-pepper seasoning instead of salt and black pepper.  The addition of the Dijon mustard really gave it a nice kick!

This is a great recipe!  I omitted the diced red pepper and added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes foe a bit of bite.  The chicken was tender and very "lemony"
Great!

Wow, really delicious and quite simple. This will be a standard recipe in the future.

I marinated for about 40 minutes, and then baked for 40 minutes at about 350 degrees in the marinade and it was perfect.

Great marinade with ingredients that you have right in your kitchen.  Tasted good. Marinated for several hours while we were at church.  Will make again.

I didn't get to have any because my husband and 2 teenage boys ate them all. I did have a taste as I took it off the grill and it was really tangy but the smokiness from the grill balanced it out. I hate changing the recipe but I had no red peppers- next time I will put it in.

Excellent taste. This dish was done as an oven-baked and was absolutely tasteful and golden brown. Bake for 1.5 hrs at 350degrees.

I gave it a 5 even though my kids thought it was "bitter". My dh and guest said it was good.  I served it with salad and made a dressing using the same ingredients but I added honey.  I think I will add honey to the marinade next time so everyone is happy.

This is, hands down, the best grilled chicken I have ever eaten. So moist, juicy and flavorful! I am picky and very seldom do I give five stars -- and usually I have to modify the recipe to suit myself. Not this one though. Try it, you'll like it!

This recipe is "delish"  as is!  My parents who like nothing, LOVE this.  Chicken comes out very tender on the grill or baked in the oven.  This tastes a liittle better with all fresh ingredients, but I have used store bought lemon juice and minced garlic and it was still great!  Love this one!!  Thanks!

Easy, usually have all ingredients in fridge and chicken came out very moist and tasty.  Making it for 2nd time in a week today.  Have marinated all day and it still comes out moist.  Also turned leftovers into chicken pot pie!!

I marinated the chicken for a few hours before grilling and it was just perfect.  The marinade is quite tasty and we found it perfect for the outside barbeque grill.  Will make this one again.

A good recipe but I would definetely suggest marinating the chicken longer than 20 minutes, to get more of the flavor.

This was good!  Because I had everything on hand, it was so easy to make.  I was surprised that the chicken retained the marinade flavour, despite being marinated for only 1/2 an hour.  (I actually put the marinade and chicken in a large ziploc bag and flipped it after 15 minutes).  Was awesome served with roasted asparagus and rotini pasta with butter.

This is a great marinade - very flavorful!  I like to use spicy brown mustard and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  Same flavor, just a bit more spice for my taste.  Also, I advise marinating for2-3 hours at a minimum.  The more time spent marinating the more flavorful.

Made the chicken exactly as written, except I marinated it longer - for about an hour.  I was stunned at how flavorful and tender it was.  Super easy, and something that will absolutely go into our regular rotation.

I didn't have any red bell pepper so I used a little crushed red pepper. That gave it an extra zing and we loved this recipe. I also marinated the chicken for 2 hours rather than 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper!

I forgot to put he red bell pepper in my marinade but not sure if it really mattered completely. I marinated the chicken for about an hour and then grilled it on my George Foreman. The kids really liked it and I didn't hear any complaints from the hubby ((who had to eat his as leftovers)) The lemon was pretty strong, but with the name it should be expected. We will probably keep this in our rotation. Thanks

I marinated for 10 hours and just wasn't blown away by this.  The red pepper did nothing for it.  It wasn't bad, just not a go-to recipe.

This was wonderful! So many reviews indicated that the mustard overwhelmed the lemon, so I solved that by Adding the zest from the lemon I juiced. I marinated for about 3 hours and the meat wasn't tough - though I know you need to be careful with citrus marinades. I am looking forward to the next time we have this and think it would be marvelous on a hearty white fish like rockfish. Next time I will add some fresh rosemary, basil or thyme from my garden. Thanks for a great dinner!

This was very good, and had a nice flavour even with only an hour in the marinade.  I used chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand, and baked it in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  I also added a little thyme to the marinade and left out the red peppers!  This will go into my rotation of marinades!

Great light way to make chicken. Hubby really enjoyed. I did not bother with any bowls just threw the chicken in a ziploc and added the ingredients! VOILA! Would not change a thing.

This is the easiest and the best chicken recipe out there.  I live in a condo where we are not allowed to use a grill so I just bake this dish in the oven.  So good!!!!

Very easy and great flavor.  I did not have any red bell pepper so I substituted sun-dried tomatoes.  I also used have of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and half olive oil.  I also baked the chicken in the oven with all the marinade.

Delicious marinade.  I used lime juice for 1/2 of the lemon juice called for in the recipe and it was great.  Also, I seasoned chicken with Tony Chachere's seasoning (all purpose seasoning) before adding marinade and omitted salt.  I marinated 45 minutes and it was so good.  Definitely a keeper.  I grill chicken breasts often and am always looking for new recipes.

Great!  I use variations of this marinade for all sorts of things.  This time I baked it and used a green bell pepper (because that is all I had).  Was delicious!  Served with roasted sweet potatoes.  yum.  will used the red bell pepper next time as that will certainly be nicer.

Awesome! Made this twice so far.  Second time I did what one review said to do and I left it over night, way better! The flavour went right through the chicken, and it wasn't tough, it was still really tender.  My husband cooked in on low for 25-30mins on the BBQ with the lid closed.  Such an easy, YUMMY marinade.

Moist and flavorful--easy, inexpensive --enjoyed by toddlers and adults at family gathering.  Cut chicken into kabob chunks and grilled with additional vegetable skewers--onion peppers & zucchini

I made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly.  Marinated about 5 hours and my husband grilled it... to perfection.  The trick is to remove it as soon as it's done and then cover it with foil and let it sit for 10-15 minutes, so it's nice and juicy.  Great flavor!  A keeper!

Delicious very zesty and tangy. I did make a change instead of using the Red Bell Pepper I used Red Pepper Flakes for alittle spice. I marinated for over 2 hours to inhance the flavor.

This was awesome!  Used fresh lemon juice and green pepper from my garden that had turned red.  Neither mustard nor lemon was overpowering.  Very nice blend of flavors.  Marinated chicken for approx 2 hrs and grilled for about 20 min.  Will be going into my recipe box!

the marinade was really good. i made both chicken tenders and chicken thighs in my forman grill. i let marinade for about two hours, but still found that the flavor didn't quite penetrate all the way through. i brushed w/ marinade while cooking as well, i think next time i will try to leave it in for 24hrs. i sprinkled left over marinade once served, and put it on my vegetables as well as potatoes i grilled w/ this. oh, and i omited the mustard 'cause i didn't have any and added a small amount of spicy mustard instead. sooo good!! 4 stars because i think it either needs more time to marinade and/or needs some extra sauce to serve on the side.

I wasn't enjoying dry/bland grilled chicken anymore and decided to try this.  OMG!  Flavor, beautiful, rich lemon flavor.  Absolutely wonderful.  Don't be scared of the Dijon, it blends in and you barely notice it.  I will make this recipe again and again, thank you so much!!!!! :)  It will be great for picnics this year (with a grill).

We loved this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe called. There's just two of us so I used 1/2 the amount of chicked but kept the same amount of marinade then baked it in the oven and used the extra "sauce" to top the chicken and brown rice....yummy.

I made this when my husband and I had friends over for dinner. They all raved about the chicken! We had it over rice, as suggested, and it was delicious. We could have even handled more flavor. But as is, it is very good! Flavorful, but not overpowering!

Good busy night meal. I marinaded for 1.5 hours then baked in the oven for about 45 minutes. Right before I took it out, I squeezed 1/2 a lemon over the chicken and broiled it on high for 2 minutes approx.

I made this for passover so I made about 48 chicken breast.  Everybody loved it!  I don't have a grill and wasn't about to cook it in the oven it would have taken forever so I cooked them on my electric griddle the color was beautiful and the chicken was so juicy.  I marinated them for about 4 hours.  Also I added some Italian herbs to the marinade and reserved some of the liquid and brushed the chicken as I was cooking it.  My neighbors came by while I was cooking saying they could smell it down the block and had to come by for a taste.

WONDERFUL RECIPE!!! This was delicious! My husband said it is the best chicken I have ever made and his new favorite marinade! I wanted to take a picture, but we had eaten it all before I had a chance to get my camera out! I also added a dash of lemon pepper seasoning to the mix and I marinated the chicken for about an hour and a half, instead of 20 minutes and the flavor really infused into the chicken.  I'm sure I will get lots of requests for this one! Thanks!

Just kind of "eh" for my husband and I. I'm thinking if I marinate for a few hours, that could yield a very powerful, flavorful chicken. Might be worth a try...

Very quick and easy to prepare and very tasty.  I made the recipe exactly as written, but without the peppers (didn't have any on hand).  Marinated for about 30 minutes and then grilled on the George Foreman Grill.  The result was delicious.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy and turned out great. Everyone said it was just wonderful and the chicken breasts were very moist and tender. I could have made twice as much and I think it still would have all been eaten! Definately a hit and will make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was so refreshing to find a recipe for doing chicken on the grill that did not involve using a Kraft salad dressing marinade.  We let the chicken marinade for approximately 4 hours, and it was not too strong at all.  I was a little worried that the dijon mustard would be to strong as stated in some reviews, but that was not the case.  This is definately a keeper!

This was pretty good. Will keep in the recipe box, but it wasn't outstanding or anything. Didn't add the red pepper in the marinade because I thought it pointless.

Didn't use red pepper.  I slice my chicken to make two thin pieces instead of pounding.  Good grilled chicken recipe.

I didn't have red pepper, so I used green, but other than that, I made this exactly as written. It was amazing! I wish you could have seen my 5 yr old's eyes brighten up when he put the chicken in his mouth. This recipe is a keeper, and we'll make it again and again. I made "Squash and Pepper Skillet" from this site as a side dish. Thank you!!

I added lemon zest, halved the Dijon mustard, added capers and baked in a 350 degree oven for 1/2 hour.  Very moist results!!! :).  I thickened the sauce in a saucepan with cornstarch and water. I thought it was a tad tart but hubby LOVED it.  I loved the tender chicken.  I served with mashed potatoes and cooked cabbage.  :)))))

Awesome meal!  My daughter said it was the best dinner ever and she wants it again tomorrow.  I served it with asparagus and rice, I also used the entire plastic lemon instead of just a third cup.  I chose to let it marinate for an hour in a ziploc bag which was perfect timing for the rest of prep.  I sliced 2 red peppers and basted them on the grill for 8 min.   This was my trial recipe for this website and if they are all as delicious as this I will be a member for quite a while.

easy and delicious.  I marinated it for about 2 hours; I can't imagine 20 minutes would have been enough.  Too tangy for my picky preschoolers though - next time I'll reserve some chicken to cook without the marinade for them.

This marinade is incredibly versatile.  Use it on chicken or seafood, on the grill, in the oven or in a saute pan.  Highly recommend.

This recipe is a definite keeper!!!!   I made it with Chicken Thighs, marinaded them 24 hours in a large Zip Lock Bag. I squeezed the bag several times during the 24 hours to make sure all the chicken was covered.  I cooked it on my Forman Grill for 9 mins basting it as instructed.  It turned out so moist and flavorful.  I served it with Orzo and Mixed Veggies!!!  I will be making this over and over again.  Loved it!!!!

This is a great marinade! tasty and better than I had expected.  I do marinate longer than 20 minutes.  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the red bell pepper so I omitted and it was still great.  We will definitely use this recipe again

This was a hit in my house. I have to admit, I was quite leary. Marinading with Lemon juice normally leaves chicken tough. Obviously the oil offsets that. Wonderful flavor and extremely juicy. I did marinade for 6 hours.

Very tasty.  I thought I had the dijon mustard at home but didn't so I had to use regular yellow mustard.  It was still very good but I think the dijon definitely would give it an extra kick.  Very easy to make and I would definitely make this again.

I marinated a FROZEN chicken breast overnite with very tasty results.  Didn't use the red bell pepper but will probably try it next time.

Excellent!! Followed the recipe exactly except for the red bell pepper (we didn't have any).  It only marinated for 20 minutes but the flavor was terrific.

Great sauce! I can't seem to make anything without tweaking it a little...I used boneless chicken breasts, and baked it at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes (since I don't own a grill). I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, omitted the red peppers, and added a little extra garlic and some garlic powder. Turned out fantastic! The sauce in the bottom of the glass baking dish was excellent to pour over the chicken after it was cut. Will definitely make again and will probably use for seafood and veggies! Thanks for the post!!

Everyone knows you have to work hard to get a GOOD taste in chicken. This recipe delivers that!! Made the chicken moist and favorful. I cooked skinless,boneless chicken breast on a electric indoor grill. And normally chicken comes out dry and tough on it, however this time it was moist and very tender. This is a keeper in my recipe box now. Thanks for sharing it with us!!

Yummy!  I made this recipe as written (although I doubled the marinade), and left the chicken in the marinade/refrigerator for about 3 hours.  I used meyers lemon juice from the tree in my backyard, cut each breast into 3 pieces, then pounded them down to about 1/2" thick (prior to placing the pieces in the marinade).  I love how the dijon made the marinade creamy -- ingeninous...

This was great.  My husband made it from beginning to end, following the directions exactly as stated.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  We took the advice of others and spared some of the marinade for a later gravy.   Definitely will make this again.

great.

I followed the recipe exactly. I did let the chicken marinate for an hour. It was so good.

this recipe was the reason i finally made an account on allrecipes.com.

This chicken turned out amazing! Due to a last minute change in dinner plans, I ended up marinating the chicken in the fridge for 24 hours.  It came out moist and flavorful on the grill...my husband raved after every bite!

This is nearly identical to a recipe we got nearly twenty years ago from the Joy of Cooking and has been a staple in our home ever since.

Instead of the red pepper, try a bit of thyme.  Also, I like to marinate overnight for a lot of flavor.  The mustard is a must.

This is a great recipe, we have made it for  years. I got a Sunset cookbook for beginners. A very similar recipe was in it. 
My new daughter in law tried it and it has been a family favorite. 
We marinate it for at least 1 hour. It can get 'grainy' if you use more lemon and marinate to long. Enjoy.

This is an unremarkable recipe that didn't transform ordinary chicken breasts into anything special.  I was a little mystified by the inclusion of the 2 T. of chopped red bell pepper in the marinade; I can't imagine it imparting any flavor to speak of in 20 minutes of marinating time.

I thought this was a really good basic grilling recipe, though I don't like red pepperes much so I left them out.  I liked having the leftover chicken cold for salads the next day.

SO GOOD! Not too lemony at all. I sauteed the chicken in the marinade. I really appreciated the leftovers in a sandwich the next day! My husband (usually puts BBQ sauce on everything) loved it to and has asked me add it to the recipe book! Success!

We thought this was very good just seemed to be missing something.  I made this again adding just a little soy sauce to the marinade and that seemed to be what our taste buds were missing.  Great recipe and thank you for sharing!

This is now a staple in my kitchen! In fact, I don't use any other chicken marinade now. The only change is that I omit the red bell peppers. The chicken comes out juicy and so tasty even my super picky son loves it! It's good warm or cold on salads the next day. There are three restaurants in our family, so we are very choosy about what we eat, and this recipe is a winner.

Marinaded boneless skinless chicken thighs for 6 hours then grilled. Not much flavor. I needed to squeeze a few lemons over and salt the cooked chicken after just to taste anything. The chicken was tender.

I am always trying to find new ways to cook healthy and this one is a keeper.  My husband, who is not a fan of plain old grilled chicken, even loved this dish.  Our daughter, who is a light eater, asked for 2nds!  I absolutely loved this.  I made sure I basted the chicken during cooking and it was not at all dry.  I even put a little Dijon mustard on the table for dipping!  Next time I am going to make a little extra marinade and sauté some peppers and onions with it!  This is a great dish for the whole family to enjoy!! :)

Used the marinade for my whole chicken before putting it on the grill. I didn't have mustard, so  I didn't use it. I did use 1/2 cup of beer, crushed oregano, and cumin. Let the whole chicken marinade for 2 hours and then split it down the back prior to grilling. Before grilling I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika, more cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper (we like it hot) and put it on the grill and pressed it down with large foil covered brick. Grilled for 10-15 minutes on each side. This was yum!!

This is delicious!  And very versatile.  I've done kabobs with the marinade.  That was a huge hit.  I also made a large tossed summer salad and prepared the chicken as the recipe called for.  Made extra marinade to use as a salad dressing and topped it with the chicken sliced thinly.  YUMMY.  Only thing I change on the recipe is to add more dijon as I love the punch it gives!  Thanks!

This is one of my family's favorite chicken recipes. I've made it at least four times in the past few months. Instead of bell pepper, I use dried crushed chili peppers -- we love spicy food. I also use legs and thighs with the skin on and score the skin liberally on all sides before marinating. I try to marinate in a large baggie for at least three hours. Today, it was so windy outside that I baked these in the oven for 30 minutes each side. We made soft tacos with the meat with salsa. Yummy!

A great summertime recipe or anytime at that.  I use chicken thighs and about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes instead of the red bell pepper. I didn't think the red bell pepper did anything for it but the red pepper flakes give it a little zing.

Wow! This chicken was great!  I marinated it for about 5 hours and it made the meat super tender.  I cut the Dijon mustard just a little (about 2 tsp. instead of a T) because I didn't want the mustard to overpower the lemon. Delicious!

I loved this! I can't believe people said it wasn't tangy enough! My gosh, it was surely lemony!
I marinated mine for about 6 hours. I also scored the chicken on both sides prior to marinating. 
Very refreshing with the red peppers too! 
Thanks for sharing.

I have been using this on two boneless skinless chicken breasts a week for at least a month, as soon as its gone my kids ask for more! We slice up leftovers and use on salads and in pasta recipes. Tastes great as is, no tinkering needed with this recipe. I do marinate overnight, and think fresh squeezed lemon juice is best. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Great! The marinade would be good as a salad dressing as well. Everyone even my picky eaters loved it. I will make again- For those who said the Dijon was overpowering they obviously didn't use the correct amount of lemon. You could easily cut back on the Dijon or add enough lemon. I used the juice of 2 lemons and the mustard wasn't overpowering at all-mostly just enhanced the lemon flavor

Wonderful chicken! It is quick, easy, and low calorie!! It has a wonderful flavor and is not bland at all. My husband thinks the lemon was a little to intense but I thought it was just fine. Next time I make this, I will probably use a little less lemon juice if I am marinating it for two hours or over. Great recipe! Tastes great with brown rice.

This was fantastic just as the recipe calls.  Hubby is sick of eating chicken breast and he raved about this one.  Even the cooking time is perfect.  I did add 4 extra minutes of cooking time because the breasts were a little thick.  This is a restaurant quality dish.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe exactly but left out the red bell pepper.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours (I used thinly sliced breasts, which I think helped with the more intense flavor).  We grilled on the gas grill.  My family loved this- even the picky eater kept saying "Mmmmmm" as he ate!

Delish! I only had leg quarters instead of breasts. Used 1/2 Key lime juice 1/2 lemon, doubled the garlic and a few drops of liquid smoke (I was using the overn instead of the BBQ) Put all the marinade in a gallon bag and then added the chicken. Brioled the chicken skin side down the when I turned the chicken over I basted again and set the smoke detector off...SO, I changed the oven to bake on 400 degrees and baked while basting until chicken was done (about  35 minutes more). Served with grilled eggplant and zucchini brushed with olive oil and salt and pepper.

This is delicious!  I let the chicken marinate in a sealed bag 24 hours, turning accasionally.  It was so tender, juicy, and full of flavor!  Will definitely use this marinade again.

Smelled wonderful while cooking, but it burned on my indoor grillpan. Not a very strong flavor either. I only marinated for 20 min. Next time I will increase the marinade time and try baking in the oven.

Delicious - I cut the salt in half but everything else the same.  Perfect for a summer evening.

Excellent recipe, chicken was tender and juicy and absolutely delicious, even left-over it didn't dry out or lose its flavor.  Didn't change a thing, we love this chicken and will make it again very soon!

Fantastic! Super easy and tastes amazing!  I also love that the chicken doesn't need to be in the marinade very long to get the great taste so it works as a last minute marinade.  My family loves this recipe...kids included.

I did not have a bell pepper or Dijon mustard on hand . So, I used a mixture of yellow and dry mustard instead, along with a little cayenne pepper. Marinaded for a few hours and it turned out SO delicious and MOIST! Everyone loved it! I was a little nervous to use olive oil since it has such a strong smell/taste, but I couldn't taste it in the chicken. This was perfect!

This is a great recipe.  I made one change: Instead of using 2 T finely chopped bell pepper, I substituted 2 T roasted red pepper bruschetta (jarred variety).  It gave the chicken a great flavor!!

Oh, My, Gosh. That was the best and easyest chicken I have done yet. The flavors melt in your mouth. Simple but complimentary. Didn't change anything except for marinating it for most of the day, because I had to work and preped it early. I usually don't like barbque, because it always gets dried out, but not this one. It was very moist and tender. Will take this to the river and the desert trips.

This is easy and very good.  I let it sit for about an hour and was surprised how much flavor it had.  The only thing I did different was to add a little bit of curry and I direct heat grilled over charcoal with a touch of mesquite.

Since it was too hot outdoors for me to use the BBQ, I cooked it in a grill pan on top of my stove.  It was delicious.  I made sure the pan was on a medium heat, turning after the chicken was a nice brown in color.  A definate hit with the family.  Wouldn't change anything.

I put too much mustard on it and I DID NOT like it...I would use maybe a honey mustard instead with a teaspoon of honey instead of the dijon...it was mayonaisey!

Excellent!  We grilled the chicken 6 mins. on each side -- using the INDIRECT method -- then 2 mins. on each side over direct heat.  It was moist, tender and juicy!  Wonderful flavor!  I would highly recommend.

This was so  good. I made marinade in the morning and since I don't have a grill, I put it on a George Foreman indoor grill in the afternoon. Quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again.

a great marinade for a quick last minute throw on the barbi!  i didn't even have 20 minutes, only 5 to let it sit and it still added great flavor to the chicken, and healthy to boot!

Pretty good. I let chicken marinate for several hours. The red pepper added nice flavor and color to the dish.  Chicken was very tender too.

This was pretty good. I only had time to marinade for about 45 minutes. I don't have a grill so instead baked the chicken at 400 for about 40 minutes in the marinande and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I love lemon but even for me it was too much, but I think it's because I doubled the marinade??? I then made a gravy out of the marinade, and it again, too much lemon... I may make this again, will double the marinade again but next time will not double the lemon juice.

OUTSTANDING! A WINNER! Marinated 12 half breasts midday for a grilled dinner in a large glass bowl. The scent when I opened the fridge was intoxicating. Kids and Hubby loved it. Had it two nights in a row w rice Salad & veggies! Thank goodness for those who upload great recipes like this. Helps us homeschoolers who love to, & do, cook but some nights don't have the time we'd like. Thanks so much!

Fantastic!  I doubled the marinade and marinated the chicken for about 7 hours.  It was super tender and tasty and everybody loved it.  I didn't add the red pepper and don't think it needed it.

Really easy and flavorful!!! Don't know if I'd bother with the red pepper again. I marinated all day and BBQ'd. Make sure you baste them; that added a lot of flavor. I might add a pinch of sugar next time to balance the sourness of the lemon a bit.  A big hit with our guests! Thanks for posting!!!

Deliissh!! I followed the advice and marinated it for 3 hours and it was perfect. I skipped the red peppers for lack of it, but it didn't matter, for the taste was just right... I even defrosted additional chicken breast and left marinating in the fridge, for the following day, since I had to share the first time with my sister and was longing for more!

Very good, quick and easy. I marinaded it in the fridge for about 3 hours, but I suggest marinading them longer. I made it as a quick dinner for 4 and everyone complimented the recipe. If you like your food a bit spicier, add a dash of crushed red pepper for a nice kick.

Great Flavor... Instead of making chicken breast I cut the breasts into strips before marinating the 20 minutes.It started to rain so I then baked the strips in the oven on 350 and it turned out awesome! I served the strips on white rice cooked with a little bit of lemon in the water and it turned out to be an awesome pairing

Really good recipe. Have made this twice now. Eyeballed the dijon and garlic and marinated for about 4-5 hours each time just because. Didn't use red pepper either time as didn't have any and I don't think it suffered for it. Marinade seems like it would make a pretty good dressing for greens as well- basically a vinaigrette type dressing. I'll have to try it. Served tonight with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus. Good spring dinner everyone loved!

This was an excellent and easy marinade for chicken.  I pounded my chicken thin- then had to run out the door- so my 17 year old son, put together the marinade per the directions (except for chopped red pepper- as I didn't have any), put it all in a zip-lock and back into the refrigerator. I let the chicken marinate about 3 hours,then cooked it on the grill.  It tasted amazing!  Will definately make again.

We thought this was great.  Made exactly as recipe was written but marinaded for 3 hours.  Minced red pepper makes presentation beautiful.  A keeper that came out moist, tender and delicious.

Yum, yum, yum! I made k-bobs with this recipe...putting red pepper slices between the chunks of chicken. Not only is it delicious, it is also very pretty with the little bits of red pepper stuck all over the grilled chicken! Loved it!

Wonderful recipe! I'm sure this will become a family favorite. The only thing that I did different was not add the red pepper...I didn't have any. Other than that, I made the recipe as written. I'm not sure why some reviewers said it didn't have enough flavor. I love flavorful food and I thought this was excellent. The marinade enhanced the chicken without overpowering. It was just right.

What else can I say! Light and creamy! This was so good. I used one chicken cutlet. I love lemon so I used one fresh lemon, the whole thing, and left everything else as is. I also did it in a frying pan instead of a grill. It came out just right.

This marinade is so good! The only changes I made was I added about 2 tsp. light soy sauce, and a little more lemon juice than called for. It is so delicious and would be perfect for grilling artichokes and as a dip! YUM! I used only 1/2 of the marinade for 2 chicken breasts and used the other half to flavor the water for red potatoes. They came out so good and were the perfect compliment to the chicken! YUM YUM!!

My husband put this together and it turned out pretty well.  Substituted red pepper flakes for the bell pepper which gave it a bit of a kick.  I grilled the chicken on the Foreman and boiled the extra sauce and put it on rice.

This was a very good marinade for grilled chicken.  I omitted the red bell pepper and added fresh rosemary for a different flavor and it worked very well!  Will use this recipe again and add different herbs to change the flavor.  The dijon mustard gave it a tangy flavor.  You will enjoy.

Really good.  I omitted the red pepper (because I didn't have one!), added a bit more lemon juice, and sprinkled each piece of chicken with lemon pepper.  Cooked it on my George Foreman!  No complaints from the husband!

I marinated for a full day and the meat (thinner cuts) got tough.  Very lemon-y, not a lot of dijon flavor.  Just all right.

I didn't feel like cleaning a grill so I baked this in the oven. I also dusted the chicken with kosher salt and black pepper, like the Cardamom chicken also from the site. Very good. Thanks.

Super easy and gave off a lot of flavor. Marinate for at least an hour, though. At 20 minutes, most of the flavors cook off, it really needs more time to soak into the chicken.

This recipe was simple and delicious! I only marinated the chicken for about 15 minutes. I also didn’t use mustard as I can’t have it, but used all the other ingredients, plus added Italian spices like oregano, basil, rosemary and thyme. I cut the chicken breasts in half  so that they’d be flatter to cook more evenly. I cooked them for about 5 minutes on each side on medium heat and they came out juicy and delicious. . This was one of the best recipes I’ve made from this app yet! Yum! Thanks!

I did a third of the Dijon mustard after reading some reviews. It was a pretty yummy recipe but it was missing something that I can’t put my finger on.

I usually don't write reviews.... just enjoy the great ideas and recipes.  But made this last night and my husband said this was maybe the best meal he has ever had!!  Which is a real compliment coming from someone who is served great meals daily!!!
I used spicy brown mustard. a few red pepper flakes and no red bell peppers as i didn't have any on hand.  Marinated for about an hour.  Served with corn on the cob and Caesar's salad. Yum.

We marinated the  chicken overnite. It was NOT overbearing with a Dijon mustard taste... In fact you couldn't put your finger on what the flavour was but it taste Good! The red pepper gave some nice specks of coloring to it. It did take longer to cook on the grill than what the recipe says.. But it was very flavorful, moist and Delicious. I wouldn't change or add anything to this recipe (ingredient wise)..... It's Perfect as is- The recipe is Definitely a Keeper.

Fabulous! I wish I would’ve had extra marinade to heat and dip pieces in for extra flavor. Also I would marinade longer and possible tenderize the chicken ahead of time...

Very tasty recipe where  the Dijon Mustard and Lemon juice add a nice tanginesss  to the meat.  Instead of cooking on the grill I smoked this dish on high heat on my traegger smoker for added flavor.  Overall very pleases with the dish where this marinade was a nice  change up from the other marinaded chicken dishes I have been making

This turned out quite excellent. Instead of grilling I cooked in a cast iron pan on the stove which kept it quite moist. Also, to boost the flavor I used chipotle olive oil.

I used approximately 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes instead of the red peppers since we were out.  It added a nice flare.  It worked quite well served alongside grilled eggplant.

I got this recipe from the Tyson chicken bag. It's a great way to use all the fresh lemons I had on hand! Super easy, but it needs to marinate much longer than 20 minutes to have good flavor.

Really simple and fast dish. Very juicy. Only changes I made were doing about 3/4 teaspoon mustard since there were some other concerns about the overpowering flavor. I also punctured the chicken repeatedly and let it marinade for an hour instead of 20 minutes.

Halve the Dijon & add the zest of a lemon for a nicer, more pronounced lemon  flavour. The juice alone just makes it tangy, not lemony.

This is one of the best chicken marinades I've ever tasted! The lemon and dijon mustard give it a wonderful tangy flavor. It was easy to make but very impressive for company. I served it with fresh corn on the cob and biscuits. Definitely adding this to our regular menu of dinners.

i loved this chicken! The only changes I made to the original recipe was, I left out the red peppers (didn't have them) and I reduced the Dijon mustard to 1/2 tbsp (because of other reviews said that it was overpowering). I marniated it for 6 hours then grilled it. It turned out delicious!

loved this recipe. I took some advice with other reviews.  I actually added some lemon rind in my marinate and also cooked it with the chicken.  Very tasty combination.

This was great.  We loved the flavor.  I used honey dijon mustard.  I pounded the chicken thin and marinated it for 20 mins.  I made broccoli Au Gratin rice a roni and fresh green beans.  Great meal.
Update:  I made this again, but it was too cold and snowy to grill outside, so I just cooked the chicken in the marinade in a pan on the stove stop.  It was pretty good.

This is my go to recipe for grilled chicken and I have been making it for over a year. I butterfly and pound the chicken breast, so that it will cook evenly. Then I marinate it for 3 to 4 hours before grilling. I do not change any of the ingredients, as it is perfect as written. Do not forget to baste the chicken as it cooks with the 1/4 cup of extra marinade.

I made this tonight and it was awesome...the flavors of lemon and Dijon were so distinct. Every bite I took I could taste both of them.  I will definitely make this many times this summer and the summers to come.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious way to cook chicken breasts. My 5 year old even loves them. Thanks for the recipe - it's become our go-to recipe for warm spring and summer nights. It's simple to make, doesn't take too long, healthy and tasty.

I'm not much of a meat marinader but this recipe made me a believer.  It's very, very flavorful - I wouldn't change a thing.  It's also a great one to use if you're doing the Atkins diet.

This marinade was a bit tart for my taste, so I added a tablespoon of honey, and that really brought it up a notch.  I served this chicken with a garlic/onion rice and woofed it down in record time.  Keeper!

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a big hit with the family.  I followed the recipe exactly but doubled up on the marinade.  I marinated the chicken for close to 4 hours and it was really flavorful and moist.  This is definitely a repeat!  :)

This was a very tasty marninade. I made as written, let my chicken breasts marinate for over an hour.  Then cooked in a skillet with the marinade until the chicken was done.  Most of the sauce cooked away, so by the time the chicken breasts were done, the red peppers and remaining sauce grilled perfectly to the chicken.  This was an outstanding marniade.  Will definitley make again!

Marinated for several hours. Possible that the marinade didn't penetrate enough because the chicken breasts were so large. Flavor was not strong. Even if it were a bit stronger I think I'd say good, but not great to the flavor combo. A bit more acid (lemon) maybe...

It doesn't make sense to marinate chicken because it doesn't take up any flavor. One needs a separate sauce for it.

I have to admit, I misread the recipe and I thought the chopped red pepper was crushed red pepper flakes. I thought 2 tablespoons was a lot, but then I looked over the comments and no one was saying this was too hot, so I only reduced it a bit. The result actually was very good. I did not baste, and I think the heat of the flakes may have mellowed in the marinade and from the heat of the grill. I used an indoor cast iron grill on my stovetop, medium heat, and it worked great.  About 3 min per side for tenders, 5-7 min per side for boneless chicken thiehs. Next time I try this, I'lll try the chopped red bell pepper, but I may also add some crushed red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper, or I think I'd miss the heat. Oh, I marinaded for about 2 hours. Some bites had less flavor than others, probably could have used longer marinading, or basting (as called for in recipe) would likely have helped with this. The finished chicken sat in a bowl and a good amount of juices collected in the bottom which had strong flavor (and head) and could be drizzed over pieces so it all had great flavor. Eating with spanish rice and salad.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and son loved it.  I didn't change a thing and served it with roasted baby potatoes, green beans and a green salad with tomatoes.  Yummy and healthy!

I've been making this recipe for years.  In fact, I double or triple the recipe and DH and I reheat these for breakfast (w/melted cheese in a tortilla) or lunch.  The protein keeps us fuller longer -- normally tough on a diet!

I decided to use the marinade for 2 cornish hens cut up.  I love dark meat while my hubby loves white meat.  I doubled the marinade and used about half of it to marinate the hens for 35 minutes.  I poked each part with a fork so that the marinade would penetrate.  Then I preheated the grill to high.  I placed the cut up hens on sprayed aluminum foil and put them on the grill.  I immediately lowered it to medium low.  I cooked them (covered) on one side for 10 minutes, flipped them and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Then flipped again for another 5 minutes.  They were delicious.  (I substitute cornish hens for many recipes and whatever marinade or rub, they cook for 25 minutes.)

This marinade was easy to make and produced flavorful results in the suggested 20 minutes.  Although I like dijon, the flavor was strong for my preference.  Next time I'll use less.

Great flavor. Nice and moist. Grilled it on a very small camper propane grill. Took about 15 minutes total... 7 to 8 minutes per side on high.

The chicken was moist was the only good thing about this dish. The mustard was too overpowering. That's all you could taste. We won't be making this one again.

I chopped up some onions, cilantro, and 1 green jalapeno pepper into the marinade to add more flavor. My boyfriend loves chicken and I love fish, so I marinated chicken breasts and red snapper in separate tupperware boxes. The fish ended up to be more tasty than the chicken because I grilled it with a piece of aluminum foil that I made into a small container to hold the juice as I was grilling it.

I marinaded the chicken for a good 2 hours and used more lemon juice than it called for, but the finished product lacked any lemon flavor at all. The chicken was moist but the lemon flavor was missing. Quite disappointing.

Excellent marinade! I omitted the red bell pepper because I didn't have any on hand, and did not baste because I was a little nervous about the dijon mustard (my husband and son do not typically like it), due to one of the reviews. It had a great flavor, though ~ nothing overpowered anything! Next time, I will baste the chicken, and make exactly as directed!

Good recipe (I think...it's still on the grill!), but directions a bit confusing. It says to 'discard marinade' and then baste occasionally with the 'reserved marinade'.

A really tasty chicken dish. Just be careful when you are basting the chicken when it's on the grill. It makes the flame get really big!

I used this marinade for a whole cut up chicken (skin & bones included) and let it marinate 45 mins to an hour... and grilled it on the bbq.  Not a lot of flavor.  I'm wondering if I needed to marinate it longer because the bone was still in??  I'll try this again for boneless breasts, it sure smelled good before it was cooked!

This is pretty good. Not surprisingly, my kids found it a bit sour, and my husband and I found it a tad dry, but we still enjoyed it. I left out the red pepper and grilled the chicken on a George Foreman grill.

I thought it was good...very light and healthy tasting. My husband didn't care for it, though. He thought it was too plain. I made it with a greek coucous salad, and I thought both went well together.

I wanted to love this recipe.  I really did.  I love the taste of lemon with chicken...and grilling it?  Come on!  What's not to love???  Somehow, it didn't work as well as I had hoped.  I followed the recipe ingredients (I varied on the marinade time.  I did 4 hours)...which is rare for me.  Well, I did add extra garlic.  However, this had a strange aftertaste.  I'm not sure...maybe from the red bell pepper?  My family was not wowed by it and that is how I judge not only the rating, but the remake probability.  Sadly, this one didn't make the cut.  Sorry.  Thanks for posting so we could try it!

Pretty good for a quick dinner. I only was able to marinate for about 2 hours...I think longer would have been better. I would increase the dijon mustard next time. Thanks!

I picked this for a healthy recipe and the family liked it a lot.  Be sure to marinate the chicken at least as long as it recommends.

I made this recipe last night.  I marinated it for about 20 minutes and then sauteed it in the same concoction with extra olive oil in the skillet.  I did not make it with the bell peppers.  It was pretty good--the dijon mustard gave it a kick.  I made a lemon-garlic pasta side dish to go with it. I'd make it again.

This recipe didn't wow me, but I did like how easy and quick it was. I marinated it for about an hour and broiled it in the oven. I served it with mashed potatoes for dinner and then had leftovers in my salad the next day.

This is an easy to make recipe - and like other reviewers I left the chicken in the marinade for longer than the recipe called for - 6 hours. I used extra garlic (doubled) and saved some of the reserved marinade to pour over the cooked chicken, which added extra flavour.

I made this recipe with chicken tenders and used lime juice instead of lemon. I also left out the peppers, but it still tasted great. I used a stove-top grill pan and the chicken came out so tender.  I did leave it to marinate overnight in the refrigerator, though. My roomate and I loved it so I'll be making more soon. This recipe is a keeper!

Wow, amazing recipe!!  I'm not usually a big fan of Lemon Chicken, but this was amazing!  The only thing I changed was I didn't have any red peppers so instead I used about 1TBSP of Epicure Roasted Red Pepper dip mix.  I have one very picky eater and even she asked for seconds!  This one is going in my recipe box! :)

This was great on the grill. Used a seasoned pepper instead of regular and marinated it for over an hour but otherwise followed the recipe.  We both loved the flavor and will definitely use it again.

I found this recipe just excellent.  I don't usually care for chicken breasts that much, but this time the flavor really seemed to sink in, and for a change I got the "doneness" just right.  A very nice blend of flavors - thanks for sharing!

So easy, so tasty. My husband (who is a novice at cooking)had a go at this recipe, and it was great. I got him to halve the amount of oil & it wasn't missed at all in this recipe. A definate winner with the kids too.

YUM!!! You MUST try this one. Very easy to make. I will most certainly continue making this one. I recommend serving with garlic asparagus with lime. I think next time I might add more dijon mustard. Didn't really taste it a whole lot.

Absolutely loved it.  It was a great blend of flavors.  I cooked it in my grill pan with all the marinade and then served it, juice and all, over rice.  It was great!   The only thing I would do different next time is to double or triple the amount of red peppers.

I thought this was fantastic!!! So tangy.  Rather than grilling, I pounded the chicken breast out thin and pan fried it. My husband didn't care for it but that's only because he doesn't like chicken unless it's smothered in a fattening sauce!  :(  I was hoping he would go for this one.  I'm always trying to find a good healthy chicken recipe that he'll like.  So far, no luck!

This had a great flavor.  I used roasted red pepper for the bell pepper.  I also added fresh basil.  It was pretty as it was marinating, all red and green.  All the big chunks of red and green fell through the grill grates though.  But I'm sure they added to the flavor!  The chicken was moist and tender.
