I skipped the ginger, because I'm not a fan of it, and this came out very tasty. I would use less cinnamon next time to have more pear taste.

Delicious!  I thought the amount of ginger was just right without increasing it.  I added a handful of dried cranberries to the pear mixture and that was a wonderful touch of tang and color.

The pairing of fresh pears and crystallized ginger are simply beautiful! A classic,"comfort" dessert, with enough elegance to serve for company. I had misplaced a similar recipe years ago, and I was so happy to find yours, Jayda. Thank-you! (I did increase the amount of finely chopped crystallized ginger to a full Tbsp for each tsp stated in recipe. Delicious!)

Oh my, this is soooooooooo good! I doubled the ginger and also added some chopped toasted almonds and hazlenuts to the oats mixture. I also subbed 1/3 of the pears for chopped apples and it was so delicious.. I had it with fresh cream as I didn't have any ice cream on hand, I can't wait to make it again!!

I did as others who reviewed this recipe suggested and doubled the amount of crystalized gigner in both steps.  I also added about 1/4 tsp. ground ginger and 1/4 tsp. allspice.  I also added an additional tablespoon of butter to the oatmeal/flour topping.  I think these changes really made the difference.  We enjoyed this recipe.  It's a nice change from the typical apple cobblers and crisps.

Yum! Really versatile too... I had only a 9" round cake plate and a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish... didn't have any ginger.. and I added extra cinnamon and just a little bit of ground cloves. I cut up a few extra pears and made double the crumb topping... it worked well and was VERY yummy.

I would have liked to see more "juice" with the pears. It was very dry without the vanilla ice cream. Also I doubled the ginger.

I added blueberries to mine. It was yummy, but why wouldn't fruit and oats be yummy? I wish that the crisp part on top were more solid. Mine ended up loose and much like it was when i put it in the pan.

Super yummy, everyone loved it!
I used half Bartlett, half Anjou pears - made for a nice contrast

Also, I added a little allspice and a bit extra ginger to both the pears and topping. Since some said the pears were slightly dry, I added about 2 tbsp pear butter as well - delicious! Will definitely make again! :o)

It took a while for hubby to give this a rating as he just kept shoveling more and more into his mouth.  It's November and he willingly went out to our orchard to pick me a few of the remaining pears...and told me afterwards that there was still some left.  I think that was a not so subtle hint.  Can't remember when he last ate THAT much dessert at one time before and without the ice cream, it wasn't all that bad for him!  First class recipe!!!

Very good.  One thing: I had to cook longer than recommended––more like 45 mins in an oven that usually cooks too QUICKLY.  Since I had hungry, tired guests, I decided to turn up the oven to 400 at the end.  That provided a nice, crispy topping.  Because I just used shredded ginger as opposed to crystallized, I added some extra sugar.  Delicious with ice cream!

Yum, this was definitely a tasty pear crisp... but I wasn't a huge fan of the crystallized ginger... I also found that 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon was actually to much... I found it sort of over powering the peach... and I prefer a strong peach taste. Next time I make it, I think I will go for 2/3 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and I would leave out the ginger all together.

Some friends gave me 5 Asian pears from their tree...bought 3 Bartletts and made this.  It was a great success, though I always have a problem getting the "crisp" crispy even though I added additional butter and baked longer.    Next time will crank up the heat in the end to make it crispy and brown on top.  GREAT dessert.  Would make it again and add cranberries or blueberries or something else to make it interesting.  Would like to cut the calories a bit, too.  Vikki in WA

We loved it!  Our pear trees produced so much fruit this year and we needed some ideas to make good use of it!  This one was definitely enjoyable.  We added some craisins but otherwise followed the directions.

really yummy! Had a great pear to crumble ratio. I used ginger powder instead of candied ginger, but the ginger added a nice kick! Delicious with vanilla ice cream!

We loved this recipe.  Only changes I would make is to add more crystalized ginger to both topping and fillng,although I did not try it with ground ginger as some have stated.  It is very easy and delicious!  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I made the recipe adjusted to 12 servings and added frozen blueberries and apples (granny smith and ginger gold apples).  I didn't have caramelized ginger so I added ground ginger.  It smelled so good and tasted even better! I did have to add extra margarine to the topping, but the recipe is wonderful!

This is a great way to use up over-ripe pears. Because my pears were way past their prime, the consistency of the pear mixture at the bottom was almost like a chunky applesauce, but with the chewy oat mixture baked on top and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it was still delicious and easy to eat. I did what others recommended and doubled the ginger, which did not seem to make a difference in the overall taste of the final product. This was a really simple recipe, which I LIKE, and I didn't have to throw my pears away. I would make this recipe again.

Very "oaty" topping.  I was expecting the pears to make more of their own sauce,  and the topping too to be more gooey and crispy, but I don't think there was enough sugar in the recipe for that to happen.  I think next time I'll use another recipe for an apple or pear crisp.

We really enjoyed this.  Some of my pears were riper than others - the not so ripe ones were still slightly crunchy.  Next time I'll make sure they are all ripe. I added some blueberries which complimented it well.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  The amount of ginger was just right, though I did squeeze some fresh lemon over the pears before I added the flour/sugar/ginger mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  I cooked it in a slow cooker for 2 hours as our oven was full that day.  I also substituted gluten-free flour and oats since I'm celiac, and added in extra ginger.  Tasty!

Good basic recipe.  I also added some dried cranberries which gave a nice boost of color.  I did not increase the ginger, but will do so next time.  Very yummy way to use extra pears.

After reading the other reviews, I used much more crystallized ginger (about 3 tablespoons).  Loved the taste - the ginger and pears go together very well.  However, I felt it was too dry.  I might try this with more butter and less flour combined with the pears.

Classic.... but I added extra twists...
Several reviews mentioned doubling the crystalized ginger but in total I used 2/3 cup minced crystalized ginger (ours was "definitely" ginger pear, not pear ginger, lol).  Some mentioned the cris bottom was dry - my pears were dead ripe and I added a handful of home dehydrated cranberries as well as about a cup of frozen blueberries and one jar of baby food (apple blueberry beet I believe is what I grabbed from the shelf-just enough to moisten).  Everyone in this house lives on spices so I used a tespoon of cinnamon in both the topping as well as the bottom and also tossed some Madagascar clove, nutmeg and a dash of Hatian vanilla.... fabulous!

Absolutely love crysalized ginger so I added extra.  Most delicious!  Was not sure how to slice the pear so my pieces were all irregular due to not wanting to waste one little piece.  Fabulous change up to family desert!

I made half the recipe with a few substitutions: First, I used powdered ginger from a nice spice store instead. This was a good idea and the ginger taste comes out fine this way. Second, I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted some white sugar and some buckwheat honey (which has a strong, molasses like flavor). Finally, owing to the fact that many people said it was a bit too dry, I threw in a shot of cognac with the pears. This was a great idea.

I cooked it in a square 6x6 inch Corningware baking dish, so it was a bit deeper than the suggested 9x6 pan. The result was that it took at least 45 minutes to cook and the pears were still a bit stiff. I used D'anjou pears that were still a bit hard (not rock-hard, but slightly hard). I think the result would have been better with either Bartlett or Bosc.

I had a ton of pears from our tree and wanted a crisp. I chose this recipe because the idea of crystallized ginger  intrigued me. Although the taste was good, the fruit and topping were just average. . . Kind-of dry, actually. Next time I have pears, I'll just add the ginger to my standard apple crisp recipe.

A very yummy dessert.  I was looking for a recipe that I could use several pears in that never fully ripened.  I added extra ginger and cooked 10 minutes longer (since they were under-ripe) and it was excellent.

Fool-proof, this was easy, came out delicious and was a terrific dish to take to a dinner party. My hosts took it upon themselves to keep the leftovers, a great sign!

I really liked the addition of crystallized ginger! I used about 1/4 sugar sugar in the crisp topping since I prefer foods less sweet than most people. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I have never used crystalized ginger.  It was difficult to chop up finely so I used a pair of kitchen shears and tossed the ginger in the flour mixture as I snipped away. The ginger flavor was perfect not overbearing.  I used canned pears, but kept the cooking the time the same.  As was said by another reviewer the topping was very similar coming out of the oven as it was going in "loose".  I might add more butter next time to increase the crumble. I returned the pan to the oven after I poured some of the pear juice over the crumble top which was my clueless moment (the oatmeal lost its crisp).  Yummmy!  I enjoyed this very much. Pears and ginger compliment each other wonderfully.

This was good. It was very quick and easy to make, I will probably make it again. I added ground ginger and frozen blueberries. As others said it was pretty liquid-y on the bottom. The leftovers were too soggy so I had to put it back in the oven to eat the next day, but the taste was really good.

Very good recipe. I added a couple of apples to make a total of 8 cups of fruit. The next time I think I would only use 6 cups of fruit. It was too much fruit and took about 30 minutes longer to cook than the recipe indicated. But the crust was perfect and the seasoning was just right.
