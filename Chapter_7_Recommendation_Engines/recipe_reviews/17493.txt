Hi everyone! I just wanted to say that until I found another recipe on this site for Mac & Cheese that I like better, I had been making it pretty much like this recipe for many years. To make this recipe work well, use cooked macaroni instead of uncooked, and also use velveeta in the mix, then top with sharp chedder cheese and dot with butter. About three hours on low, and you have yourself a really good mac & cheese!

I have made this several times and modified it to how we like it. We leave the eggs out entirely, so it turns out creamy, not "set up" like custard. I used only 3 cups of cheese (it was PLENTY!), used skim milk and added garlic powder and green pepper hot sauce. Everyone at work loved it!!!

Excellent, easy recipe.  I did not cook my macaroni before placing it in my slow cooker and it did great even though I had my doubts.  I dislike it when people change a recipe completely and then rate it.   I made this recipe exactly as written and I'm very happy with the results.

This recipe is getting a really bad rap!  I've done it in the oven and I've done it in the slow cooker.  Slow cooker is definitely better.  I think for this recipe to be at its best, one needs to have one of those medium sized (3 quart?) crock pots.  I have one of the 6 quart ones so I only let it cook for 2 hours.  I did not add the eggs, I cut the cheese to three cups, I did not cook the macaroni first, and I used spicy paprika.  My husband loved it, one half of my toddler twins loved it, my 4 year old woudln't eat it.  I think it is a good side dish and will definitely make again.

I think this is getting a bad rap too -- but I made a lot of modifications as a result of reading the previous reviews.  I used a 16 oz box of macaroni, one egg, maybe 2 1/2 - 3 cups of milk, 2 cups of shredded cheese and a sizeable chunk of velveeta.  I really wanted this to work .. just because it has the potential to be so easy.  I started cooking on low but realized I'd have to crank it up on high to be finished on time. You should definetly stir this while cooking ( I always stir my crock pot creations).  If it starts getting "blobby"  or burning -- turn down the heat and add more milk.  My Easter crowd enjoyed the recipe -- even the teenagers ! Tastes good the next day.  The only thing missing was the cruchy macaroni that is so tasty with the oven version !

I think many people who have made this have never had "baked" mac and cheese. No it is not "creamy", it is not supposed to be. It is a custard style mac and cheese. It is lumpy, cheesy a little greasy and deliscious.This is pretty much a standard recipe for it. My mom made this for fourty years except in the oven. I think the crock pot works better. Only change I would make is to use at least half sharp cheddar. I saw several people did not add the egg. To each their own but the eggs are esential or it becomes a totally diferent recipe.

I was surprised by this recipe.  I did change it a bit, due to the fact I didn't have any evaporated milk.  I used 2 cans cheese soup, 2 cups milk, 2 eggs 4 cups cheese, 1 tbsp flour and the uncooked macaroni.  I did stir everything half way thru, but left it alone after that.  It was very tasty.  Husband liked it better this way than the way I usually make mac and cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

I only got a forkful of this because that's all that was left when I got to it but it tasted great to me, creamy and cheesy. I doubled the recipe for a picnic.  I followed others suggestions and  used whole milk in place of the evaporated plus the regular milk it called for. I also used 4 C. cheddar cheese and 4 cups of Velveeta. I only used 1 egg because I wanted it creamy. I also used white pepper and dry mustard and didn't precook the macaroni. I used my 6 quart round crockpot and set it on high for 3 hours. Half way through I stirred it (something I never did before). We need to remember that not all slow cookers or crock pots are created equal. Typically a slow cooker heats from the bottom up and a crock pot heats around the sides. Some crock pots are hotter than others when set on low or high. I got rave reviews from everyone that got some of this. I plan to make it again this week with a meatloaf. It's just so easy!!!

i make mac and cheese from scratch alot, but i've never made it this way, and i won't do it every again!  i followed the directions to the letter, but the egg rose to the top and baked up like a custard.  the cheese wasn't at all what i'd call creamy, rather it stayed in lumpy shreds, and the outsides was definitely getting crustier when i liked.  it was also very very bland.  a little paprika or mustard would be nice!  but the basic cheese sauce just didn't work well at all.

This dish is excellent and a huge hit in my house.  Word to the wise:  if you are a fan of boxed mac and cheese, then this recipe isn't for you.  If you're from the south like myself, then you can appreciate the custard-texture of this mac and cheese.  As for the cheeses, I used a lot of sharp because it has more flavor and I added paprika.  Yummy!  I shared this with my mom!

I skipped the eggs because I didn't want a custardy mac & cheese. I added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, used white pepper instead of black and sprinkled with paprika before serving. My 9 yr old daughter and I loved it...my blue box (read: fake) mac & cheese loving 7 yo son hated it.

It was actually good. This recipe is not for everyone. This is a southern way of making macaroni and cheese. If you are used to a creamy textured mac and cheese then don't make this and please don't try to alter it by putting Velveeta Cheese in it. It is not that kind of recipe. It will be custard-like and thick. The noodles will stick together. I only used one egg and should have used two because it was drier than I wanted it to be. I will make this again for a quick meal. Thank you Shauna. UPDATE: Using 2 eggs was just what was needed. This is exactly the way my mom makes it and the way my family will only eat mac and cheese. Cooking mac and cheese in the crock pot is a quick way and easy way; however,I still like making mine in the oven.

I liked it but my mother thought it was "too custard-like" so I'll delete one egg next time.  I didn't stir it as the directions stated and that was fine.  My kids are so used to Kraft Mac & Cheese that they didn't like it.  It was too different.  Well, I liked it and it was easy.

I was so excited about the ease of this meal, but this recipe did NOT turn out as expected. We had one bite and it was not only dry, but it looked terrible when we took the cover off the crock pot and stirred it before serving... I would not recommend making it.

I brought this recipe to my company potluck and got rave reviews. I did make the following changes: I used 1 lb macaroni, boiled it aldente first, used 2 cups sharp cheddar and 2 cups mild cheddar, replaced the evaporated milk with whole and kept the whole as stated, I used only one egg and added 1/2 tbl sp dried mustard and 1/2 tble spoon paprika. I also coated my crockpot with butter because I had no pam spray. I also stirred it every 30 minutes to prevent sticking and cooked it on low for 2 hours. It was perfect, I will make this again and it is going in the potluck recipe hall of fame.

Everyone lovest this mac & cheese whenever I make it.  I do slightly cook the pasta before putting it into the crock pot.  I also half the eggs to make it a little less custard like.

Very Good just made it for the second time and got rave reviews! I did make some alterations to the recipe as many others have done and they have been good both times. I only used one egg ( still sets up custard style) added 1/2 tsp of paprika and 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and par boiled noodles for 3 minutes, but have done the both ways and has worked fine both times. It only needs to cook for 3 hrs on low-medium I stirred after first hour and no sticking or burning! Definitely will be using this as my easy mac and cheese recipe!!!!

I've been looking for a good recipe for Mac and Cheese for a long time, so I am delighted to say this one will go into the file of "Bea's Favorites" in my kitchen. It was a tiny bit "firmer" than I would have liked, but I probably over cooked it. I left out the eggs, as most of the reviews I read said they did, but next time I will try it with eggs. I made a double recipe in my 5 QT. cooker and I'm so glad I got to have the first bite (the cook should always get the first bite) because by the time I went through the potluck line there was only one last bite for me! I'll take that as a compliment. Also, all the best cooks were after me for the recipe! Love that.

I had to up the positive reviews on this poor recipe!  I made this tonight, and while it wasn't a perfect recipe, it wasn't the nightmare some reviewers portrayed.  I used whole wheat elbows and I left out the eggs because that sounded gross to me. Otherwise, I cooked as directed, but it was done - and ever so slightly burnt on the edges - at 3 hours on low. (I have a 3.5 quart slow cooker.)  Next time, I think I will try to spruce it up with some dry mustard or something spicy because it was a little bland. Also, there was a TON of cheese in this thing. It was good, but small portions are a must. I will definitely make this meal again.  Also, I have decided recently that one pot cooking means absolutely only one dish, so I actually mixed everything in the slow cooker instead of in a separate bowl. It was no problem. I guess if you add the egg, you wouldn't be able to use that idea.  Anyway, good and EXTREMELY EASY recipe.

This is our go-to recipe for a quick, easy macaroni and cheese.  It seems that the problem most people have with it is that it's not creamy, but if you are a fan of baked macaroni and cheese, this is the recipe for you.  (If you want a creamier mac and cheese, leave out the eggs and add a couple of American cheese slices.)  It sets up nice and firm.  I mix everything right in the crock pot so it's a one dish wonder.  The only changes I make to the recipe are doubling it (we are a family of 5 that loves it), and in addition to salt and pepper, adding some dried garlic, mustard powder, cumin, and chili powder for some light chili flavoring.  When I double it, I also use only about 4 cups of cheese mixed in and a little extra on top, and that seems to be plenty.  We cook on low for about 3 hours and it turns out great.  I cook it until the edges are slightly browned because some of us love those crispy bits.

I've made this recipe many times now and we really like it--sometimes adding this and that, sometimes not.  If you're looking for a mac and cheese that is NO effort, this is your recipe.  Yes, its custardy and a little dryer than one using Velveeta but it's healthier than most, too, esp. if you use whole wheat macaroni.  I use evaporated skim milk, farm fresh eggs and 2% cheddar cheese.  I also only cook it for 3 to 4 hrs. if I'm using my 7 qt. cooker--more if using my 3 qt. cooker (maybe more like 4 or 5 hrs.).  Does the recipe taste like the super high fat, high salt, low protein versions out there?  No!!  Is is really great and a kid pleaser?  ABSOLUTELY!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the BEST Mac and Cheese I've ever had with a few exceptions.  We double the recipe but use 3 cups of Cheddar, only one egg and ADD about 1/3 of a block of Velveeta.  It's done way before 5 hours, I would say 3-4.  If it gets dry I add a little milk.  AND SOOOOO EASY!!!

This was a great base recipe.  BUT, it does need tweeked! I put this in the crock pot on low and it was done in 2 hours.  I also added a tsp of ground mustard (I always use it in my mac and cheese), used more milk and more cheese.......used extra sharp and colby.  I will not use both eggs next time - maybe one?

I really like the idea of macaroni and cheese made in the slow cooker. Great idea for the hot summer months--instead of heating up an oven, I can make it this way. I used to avoid making baked mac n cheese  from June-September, but not anymore!
 *CHANGES MADE:I used two and a half cups of 2% fat milk and no condensed milk. I also used one cup of Velveeta that I shredded into the mixture (replacing one cup of the shredded cheddar). I highly recommend using at least one cup of Velveeta if you aren't an anti-Velveeta person. I used Lawry's seasoned salt, and just seasoned to taste (since we aren't on a salt restricted diet). I have a fairly new 5 quart slow cooker, so I cooked it on low for only 3 hours and the macaroni pasta was tender. It came out just as tasty as a baked macaroni and cheese dish! Next time I will buy some slow cooker liners because it was a little baked-on around the top edges.

Super-easy and straight-forward. Very tasty!  I read a bunch of the reviews right before I made this and got nervous, so I did customize it a bit and it turned out fantastic. I ended up cooking it for "only" 3 hours (I have a 3.5 quart cooker) and I did not cook the elbows ahead.  I added garlic powder (1 tsp), red pepper flakes (1 tsp) and a mustard-based bbq sauce (2 Tbs) because I was worried it was going to be bland, based on everyone's comments. But the good news is that it turned out very tasty and very flavorful! I will make this again for sure!!!

I make this recipe on occasion, only I do things a little differently with the assembly and some of the ingredients.  I use 1 box of al dente (cooked) whole-wheat pasta.  Add to the crockpot and stir in other ingredients with a few changes.  I use 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, and 2 cups of cheddar, 2 sticks of melted butter; and I leave out the milk (use only the evaporated) and eggs.  I cook everything on low, stirring every 15 or so minutes until all of the ingredients are mixed, then let it cook on low about 1 1/2 hour longer.  It's SO GOOD comfort food and easy to make.  I like this more than any oven-baked hard-to-pronounce cheese-based mac dish.

This recipe was made for a family gathering to celebrate a 60th birthday and 35th wedding anniversary...and it was a hit! Everyone loved it, however I must warn that it is not a creamy version of macaroni and cheese like kraft would be. Instead it is more like a cassarole.  It was so easy to just throw everything in the slow cooker, close the lid, and then eat! Great for a potluck, gathering or busy weeknight!

The cheese curdles when I made it this way.  I really think you need to make a roux first before you start trying to melt the cheese.

I used only one egg and whatever cheeses I had in the house: mostly cheddar, plus a little bit of swiss, american and parmesan.  It came out delicious -- this one's a keeper!

Followed instructions to a 'T' and was left with a lumpy, not creamy at all mess. Barely edible. I'm thinking the cooking time is much too long, so I will try this again in the future at half the recommended time.

So glad there's no pre-cooking of the macaroni. For flavour, I added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, 1/4 tsp turmeric, and a sprinkle of seasoning salt, and I added 1/2 cup of extra milk. When almost done, only 2.5 hours on medium high, I did sort of pull it away from the edge of the crock, with a spoon, and topped it with crumbled multigrain crackers which I patted into the cheese on top. It didn't stick to the sides at all with the oil sprayed before assembling. We both thought it was delicious! Reminded me of my mum's baked mac & cheese, and the eggs made it firm but it was still very cheesy. I will make a doubled crock of this for my next potluck, and I'm sure I'll be asked for the recipe. Comfort food doesn't get any easier than this!

I made this for a pot luck at work. It was devoured in less than 30minutes. I doubled the recipe except for half the eggs. I used half velveeta cheese and half sharp cheddar cheese. I only used 2 eggs instead of the double amount of 4. I cooked it on high for one hour stirring twice and low for 2 hours. This was due to the time we would be ready to eat. It turned out great. Everyone loved it and wants me to make it again!!! I did not put the cheese on top, just stirred everything together before cooking.

I liked that this could be made in the slow cooker, but the results were not exactly what I was hoping for.  I was looking for something that was at least a little creamy, but this was all stuck together and had to be cut with a fork to eat.  I would probably make some changes to this if I were to make it again.

It was delicious and I doubled ingredients to bring to a big cookout...next time will use less egg or something to make it less "solid".  It didn't turn out very pretty visually, but everyone ate the heck out of it and enjoyed!

Same recipe as "All day Macaroni and Cheese", except it doesn't cook the noodles first.  I cook 2 hours on high.  I stirred twice during cooking. It would have burned the outside edges and would not have mixed properly if I didn't. Needs a little seasoning like garlic, onion, dry mustard and a sprinkle of cayenne. A little gritty for me, but the kids loved it. I will probably use this again, just cause it was so easy. A good quality cheese yields better results. Generic sharp cheddar came out more greasy.

I followed this exactly as written, and it was GREAT! I grew up with oven-baked "custard" mac-n-cheese. I wish everyone liked this, but I'm one who dislikes "creamy" mac-n-cheese. If I want that, I just make something from the grocery store. THIS is homemade mac-n-cheese :)

Recipe super easy.  Previous reviews very helpful. I have slow cooker with low, high and warm.  I mixed milks, eggs, salt and pepper in my removable crock first then added elobow mac and cheese and finally cheese on top.  I made late night so cooked on low for 90 minutes and on warm over night for 5 hours.  Nice and creamy and nothing burned.  Will add to my recipe file.  Also for those who don't like the sweet taste don'e use evaporated milk use 3 cups of milk and 3 eggs.

I find the recipe just fine..  but I do cook mine with about 1/2 cup of sour cream and can of cheddar cheese soup (I can not remember where I saw this, though) I do not use evaporated milk..  just regular milk ..I had seen someone uses dry mustard; me too.. works out fine.. cook 3 hours total and spread rest of cheese on top w/in the last 30 minutes.

I really liked this because it's so easy to put together. I changed it (of course) by adding a bunch of frozen shredded brocoli. I also only used 2 C of cheese (all I had on hand) and it came out cheesy enough for us. I also didn't use as much macaroni, but it still came out very firm and quiche-like. 

Next time I think I'll add some chopped red pepper and maybe some sliced tomatoes on top. Definitely a keeper--tasty and easy.

I was shocked this recipe turned out so bad. I followed it as written and the entire 1/4 inch bottom of the mac-n-cheese was burned. The upper area was so stuck together that it wasn't in any way creamy.

Not a particularly appetizing look to the dish, however, it tasted okay.  Added garlic, dried mustard and worcestershire sauce so have no complaints about the taste.

I should have read the reviews before I made this.  It looked unappealing when it was done which I should have left out the eggs.  It wasnt creamy and left a bad aftertaste :(  If we make it again, I will change it a bit.

Followed directions with no alterations.  Cooked on low for 5 hrs.  Turned out oily and mushy.  Taste was okay, but couldn't make up for the texture.  Possibly cooking for a shorter time would help, but I'm not going to risk wasting all the ingredients on that, I will just stick with the traditional way of making mac and cheese.

If you like southern style baked macaroni and cheese this is a much cheaper and easier way to make, if you don't like baked macaroni and cheese and prefer it to be creamy you probably should try a different recipe. Me and my family LOVED this!!

I am only giving this 3 stars for two reasons:

First - as many others have pointed out, the cooking times are waaaaaaay off...  It was more than done after three hours!

And second - for having almost a pound of cheese in it, it was STILL a touch bland...

I may play around with the recipe a bit - but otherwise, I would NOT recommend this to others as is.

This recipe is SOOOOO easy! However, I should have read more of the previous reviews. As many have stated, it came out custard-like similar to a quiche. I did follow the recipe, did not stir it, and cooked it for about 4 1/2 hrs on low. I think the next time I make it I will "tweak" it by deleting the eggs, and adding some additonal spices. It was bland and my children didn't care for it.
If it turns out okay I will repost with the modifications I made.

This recipe was okay, but did end up being very dry.  I'd be willing to try it again with some modifications and see if it comes out better.  The cooking time was definitely too long and it burned onto the sides of the crockpot.  The consistency was too "custardy."  Next time I will omit the egg and cook for a shorter time.

I really though this recipe would turn out rich & creamy, but the cheese & noodles stuck together in clumps.  I know this might be partially my fault as I did not measure the noodles very precisely.  I also added about a half-cup more milk thinking that might make the recipe very creamy.  I also had problems with a few of the noodles on the top getting hard & dried out.  Don't get me wrong, this cheese mac TASTED very good, it just didn't very appetizing.  Pretty good recipe & I do plan to make it again--Thanks!

Will definitely make again! Super delicious and I'm a macaroni and cheese guru. Definitely use the cooking spray! I would have had a horrible mess to clean up if I skipped that step. Oh and the 6 hours is really maximum.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!  I didn't change any of the ingredients and doubled everything to fill my slow cooker to the top.

Timing is everything with this and at the 3 hours mark it was PERFECT....very creamy.  My biggest complaint was chasing my family out of the slow cooker with their spoons because they couldn't wait to try some of the dish.

I will definitely make this recipe again (and again and again).

I agree this recipe is getting a bad rap.  I think many of those rating it are not use to traditional baked macaroni and cheese.  I'm not arrogant enough to make tons of changes to a recipe I haven't tried yet, so I made it verbatim and found it easy and quite delightful.  My entire family loved it, and that's rare.  It reminded me of my Grandmother's recipe which is much more complicated.  Thank you for sharing!  It's a great recipe.

While the taste was okay, the texture was unappealing. Everything had congealed into one big mass.

This was a good macaroni and cheese.  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 Velveeta.  It probably needed more milk because it started to get heavy and dry out by the time we ate.  My family thought it was rich, but that said, there wasn't any left over!  I'll probably make it again, but add more milk.

I made this for a party and it just didn't turn out. I made it just as the recipe said, but I have a 6 quart slow cooker and it basically turned into a congealed lump.  I think the most important thing to note when recording a slow cooker recipe is the size of the slow cooker and adjust the time accordingly.  The flavor was alright, but it just didn't get eaten because it looked unappealing.

This is a really great recipe.  I love that you do not have to cook the noodles before hand.  However, I used the full pound of pasta.  Had I only used half, as the recipe stated, it would have been WAY, WAY, WAY too cheesy.  I actually perfer to use the entire box, so it works great for me.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made this for the first time today, with the following changes: 2 1/2 cups unflavored almond milk instead of cow's milk; 16 oz. macaroni instead of 8 oz.; 1 teaspoon ground mustard; 1 teaspoon paprika; 22 oz. Kraft shredded 3 cheddar mix (2 11 oz. packages). Followed the directions for mixing, etc. Put in our 6 qt. oval crockpot at 1 pm. Did not mix or lift the lid. Checked it at 4 pm - it was ready to go. Turned off the crockpot. My daughter got home around 5. Other than the macaroni getting a little gummy from standing for an hour before serving, it was really good. We agreed that it is a keeper, and will be making it again soon. Great way to do mac & cheese in the summer. Prep time cut down almost to nothing compared with making oven baked. The almond milk gives it a different taste. We have 2 family members with lactose problems, so do not use cow's milk except for making yogurt. Tasty and very easy. Easy cleanup, too.

I decided to try this recipe because it was similar to the stovetop recipe I use and I thought it would be great to make Mac'n Cheese in the crockpot. Perhaps it will be but not with this recipe. When my kids won't eat mac and cheese, its bad.  A very expensive mistake.  Perhaps the revisions that others have made would be helpful but I don't recommend following this recipe as is.

I did as others suggested and left out the egg as I did not want a custard style texture.  I also just added 3 cups of cheese as was recommended by others but I think I will add the 4 cups next time.  We enjoyed this overall, although mine did burn a little on the bottom and around the outside after cooking for 5 hours.  I will cook for less time and maybe add some paprika or dry mustard as others have.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is lucky to be getting one star!  I didn't cook the macaroni, and cooked it on HIGH for about 2 hours.  Big mistakes because it came out rubbery!  I'm generally a homemade stove-top mac n' cheese cook and I think I'll stick to doing it that way!

Unlike many others I really enjoyed this recipe almost as is. The only thing I did differently was use 1 egg instead of 2. I also put it on the crock pot for 90 minutes to 2 hours on high. This was great. I like a more custard-like macaroni coming from the south.I honestly think it was set up enough without a second egg. The only thing I feel like it was missing some type of seasoning. I didn't have paprika on hand, but I bet that would of made if 5 stars instead of 4! Great base recipe though very cheesy. It was winner for Christmas dinner!

I was disappointed this wasn't creamier than I what I thought it would be. I made this per instructions, too. It was fairly dry. I used a 3 qt oblong slow cooker and only cooked this for 3 hours on LOW. It was slightly starting to burn on the bottom. It tasted good but I've had better. I like a personal mac n cheese recipe I have for the slow cooker much, much better.

I use three different types of cheese in this Mac and cheese to give it good flavor. Also I never cook the noodles before or they are too mushy after the dish is done.

It was too crunchy on top soo it was hard to eat it. I think this is a recipe made for the oven, not the crock pot. I won't make this again because of the way it cooked. Unfortunately I wasn't able to eat it.

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this out, then I would have known that it does not require the 6 hours of cooking time. I got home from work last night looking forward to a yummy homemade mac and cheese and found a burnt mess. If I try it again, I will definately cook it for less time.

Never again. Next time I shall read the reviews before I try a new recipe.  It turned out like lumpy eggy custard and had burned all around the sides.  Was really looking forward to a creamy macaroni cheese when I got home from work today!

This recipe was okay.  This was my first time making slow cooker macaroni and cheese.  Next time I'm going to omit the eggs, I didn't like the "custard" consistency.  I was going to cook mine for 5 hrs but it was ready in 3.  I hope this helps.  Happy Cooking!

I really liked the ease of this recipe. It was tasty but a little muchy even after only 3 hours.  I would NOT cook this for 5 hours and next time I would probably add more milk and cook the pasta less time before putting it in the crock.

I tried to follow some of the hints from other reviewers, but I still didn't get this one to turn out.  Such a shame, it sounded like it would be great.  Mine came out very custard-like, even tho I used 1 egg as recommended.  It was also just a big blob.  Nothing creamy about it, the noodles on top were crunchy.  I guess I'll stick with the "boxes."  sorry

This recipe tasted like I put alot of effort in to it!  My husband could not believe I just threw
everything into the slow cooker and it did all of the work!  I plan on using this recipe often.

This recipe turned out great the first time. It reminded me of the macaroni & cheese my grandmother made, except hers was baked, and had crumbled buttered soda crackers on top.

Two hours into cooking I HAD to stir and about an hour and a half before it was ready I poured one more cup of milk in.

It was super easy for my five year old to make but overall the kids did not enjoy. So for me it was a big waste, half of it had to get thrown out.

This recipe was great once I modified it. I used 3 cups of cheese and about another 1/2 cup of reg. milk because it's one giant ball without more milk, although maybe one less egg would have been just as well.  I also put the cheese all in at once and stirred well.  And I DID have to stir as it cooked.  There's no way I could not, for it is one giant ball with too much skin otherwise.  Plus, even on slow cooker, it still sticks if you don't stir somewhat.  You can put the cheese of your choice in too.

Nothing like homemade Mac and cheese and I love the fact that it was so easy and I let the crockpot do it thing.  I added an extra half cup of milk and cooked mine for 3 hours. The family loved this!

This recipie is very simple and easy to make. Like a few other people, I subbed the condensed milk. I added a reasonable amount of butter. It really came out quite rich, but definitely not as heavy as using condensed milk.

I gave this recipe 4 stars but with a couple tweeks it is a 5 star recipe.  I added a between 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of dry mustard, used freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese (don't used the preshredded from the bags.  The preservative messes with the creamy melting of the cheese) and I added 4 cups of cheese but sprinkled another cup of cheese on top, plus sprinkled with paprika.  If you like your mac and cheese creamy and custardy, leave out the eggs or use one instead of two.  NOTE:  This recipe with eggs will be fairly creamy after 3 hours of cooking but the longer it cooks the more custardy and egg-y it becomes.  If you are not going to serve right away, I recommend turning to WARM or even off for a little while and then turning back up to WARM 30 minutes before serving.  I made this for the Super Bowl and at the beginning of the game it was still creamy and slighly liquid but by the end of the game it had become mostly eggy and custardy but still tasty.  It's just personal preference.  I boiled the macaroni for half the time it calls for but will try not boiling at all as several reviewers did and see how that works.

Made this exactly as written for a family Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it and said it tasted just like a baked macaroni pie, but without a "crust" on top. I did cook it on high for a few hours because I forgot to allow myself enough time, and it still turned out perfect.

I loved it! There are two kinds of mac and cheese people…. the ones who like it creamy and the ones who like it quiche-like.  This is a quiche like recipe like my Grandma used to bake and I loved it.  The only thing I added was some chopped green onion. (Like Grandma did!)

A quicker and easier way is to mix the same amount of ingredients but cook the macaroni FIRST then add to milk/cheese mixture; then turn the crockpot on low for an hour and a half and it's done! This saves me a lot of time when I need a side dish ASAP and don't have time for it to cook for 5-6 hours!

Just made this today. Was looking for a simple crock pot mac and cheese recipe. This is exactly what I was looking for.  However I did cut the cooking time down to 4 hours. It was starting to burn around the sides. My crock pot cooks really hot even on the low setting.  I also did stir this. Only because I wasn't sure all the pasta was cooking. Some pasta was sticking out of the top of the cheese.  Looks like i'll get 4 servings out of this. Next time I will double the recipe.  Also may play around and add some bacon. Mmmmmm.......... 2 thumbs up :)

After reading the reviews (and one failed attempt) I made the following changes: I only used 2 cups on cheese.  (I used colby jack, but I really wish I had used sharp cheddar.) And I cooked it on low for only 2 1/2 hours.  I was planing on doing 3 hrs, but when I checked at the 2 1/2hr mark I noticed the bottom got a little brown.  Next time I will only plan on 2 hours.  Also, I stirred it twice during cooking.  It was good, very comparable to the recipe I have that goes in the oven.

I will stick with the old fashioned way of baking mac and cheese. The outside burnt and the inside was just plain grainy. I even stirred it a few times as suggested.

I may possibley make this again if I make some significant changes. I love the idea of crock pot mac-n-cheese but this version was terrible in my opinion. It was lumpy and very "eggy" which I should have known with having to add 2 eggs. It was also very oily because of the shredded cheese. I should have read the other reviews before making this but I just made it as is. It was edible and my family did eat it, but did not rave about it at all. Next time I will omit the eggs, use a different type of cheese, add some additional spices, and not put the cheese on the top until later. Good luck anyone trying to make this. I will come back again to look for different ideas with this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I made it for my daugher's parent potluck dinner and it turned out great. I doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 tsp paprika, and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper to the mix.  Several people have asked for the recipe. This is a keeper!

My family LOVES crock pot mac and cheese.  It's super easy to make and always delicious.  I would suggest only using one egg (if any) it does make it turn out a little custard-like, and also reccomend using the bagged Kraft sharp chedder, it gives the mac and cheese a better flavor.  Whatever you do, DON'T STIR...it makes the cheese clumpy and gives it a weird texture!  Although this isn't exactly the same recipe we've perfected as a family, it's pretty darn close...and I would recommend it for Mom's everywhere!

I liked it.  I liked the "crusting" it did along the walls of the crock pot, I think it created a more homemade look to the dish.  I will make this again.

This was delicious.  I used cheddar and pepperjack cheeses, reduced the eggs to 1 and stirred it 1/2 way through cooking. The cooking time was only about 3 hours and turned out fantastic, my boyfriend can't get enough every time I make it.

This macaroni and cheese was soooo good and surprisingly easy to cook.  I have only recently started trying to cook something other then Ramen noodles, and I was pleasantly surprised on how well this turned out.  This is good for anyone who likes good southern style macaroni and cheese.

This was really a great, easy recipe.  I did, however, eliminate the eggs.  I took this to a Thanksgiving meal and most all of it was eaten.  Everyone loved it!!  It also reheats VERY well!

I made this for a work pot luck and they loved it!!! I have a standing responsiblity to bring this in for any future pot lucks we have. It is a very thick and cheesy consistency. Almost quiche like. It is quick to burn on the outside though so make sure you spray the pan well.

I agree with those who say this classic recipe got a bit of a bad rap and I also agree the recipe, and ALL recipes should be reviewed for the original recipe as is, although I certainly enjoy many of the variations  people share! NOW ABOUT THIS RECIPE: This is basically Trisha Yearwood's famous slow cooker mac n cheese recipe, except hers also calls for a 1/4 cup butter, and specifies "whole milk" for the milk. She also calls for 5, rather than 4, cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE AND GIVE IT AN ENTHUSIASTIC FIVE STARS!! I have made this twice as is now, once for a college youth group and once for a family  potluck--both to RAVE reviews! Yes, it's expensive to make, especially because I buy the cheese already shredded, which makes it take about 10 minutes to put together. But not every recipe has to be about making it cheap. Save this one for those special occasions when you're willing to put out a little more to make something really memorable. 

VARIATIONS: Last time I used Trisha Yearwood's recipe. I doubled it, using a 6  quart Crock Pot. I put in 3 beaten eggs, rather than 4; I did not double the salt and pepper; I added half a summer sausage, sliced; and when it was done I added a cup of Jack cheese on top and sprinkled it with paprika to look pretty (TY's suggestion). I cooked 3 1/2 hours on LOW. Everyone at the community potluck said it was by far the best mac n cheese they'd ever had!

This is the first time I have reviewed any recipe.

Glad I doubled  it. Made it for a party.  Followed the directions as written.  There was just a tiny bit left over.

My slow cooker took less than 5 hours, and there were some burnt parts on the edge (which some of the guests enjoyed to bits...)

I doubled the recipe to accommodate my large party and it was great! The consistency that some people have complained about is more similar to the southern-style mac n cheese I've had at some amazing southern BBQ joints in various parts of the US. To me, it's just the way it should be =)

I added a 14oz package of frozen broccoli flowerets thawed into the Mac and cheese and milk mix. Cool for 4 hrs. DO NOT STIR DURING COOKING. Crusty sides and creamy center. This is the only recipie I've tried that is perfect in the end.

I thought it was strange a  Crock Pot Recipe without water. But I went ahead and made this on a busy day when I was having people for dinner. I followed this to a tea and believe me I am a very good cook.
This burned in in 5 hours. So of course I had guests coming and a dinner emergency. I tried to salvage this but it was sticky lumpy and horrible, and that was the part that was not burned. I am going back to MY recipe which is creamy and smooth and delish.

Made this yesterday, didn't add any eggs or the evaporated milk as others had suggested.  So disappointed, it was terrible.  Bland taste, grainy tasting noodles.  I stirred it so it wouldn't burn, added more milk when needed.  Horrible!  Nothing but a big glob of mush, tried to eat what I could, threw the rest away!  Can't imagine how it would turn out if it cooked longer than a couple of hours...mine was mush after two.

Absolutely delicious, just like homemade. I add dried mustard, cayenne pepper, onion powder, and dash of garlic to "kick it up a notch". But this recipe is perfect as is as well!

I loved the idea of this recipe, but in actuality it isn't worth the ingredients. I make Macaroni and Cheese from scratch often (my boys have only had kraft maybe once when they visited their aunt) so I was expecting something resembling decently made macaroni and cheese. I followed the recipe as written, no additions or subtractions. I cooked it for five hours without opening as written, and the bottom was borderline burnt, it did turn out custard like (a very dry not tasty custard), the flavor was bland, the noodles were cooked evenly (without being precooked) which was a pleasant surprise as I was nervous about them not being cooked prior. It wasn't really cheesy (I'm not saying this because I expect veleveta)...Basically I have a house full of boys, and I cannot get anyone to eat this.

I made this last night and was really pleased with the results. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of dry mustard, 1/8 tsp of cayenne and a dash of nutmeg. I used my 6 quart crock pot so I started it on high for 30 mins and switched to low for 1 1/2 hours. I stirred it at 30 minutes and then at 1 hour. From that point I left it alone. I sprinkled the last cup of cheese on it about 20 minutes before serving. Both my Hubby and I really liked the taste and texture. It wasn't mushy at all and tasted like the macaroni and cheese we've eaten when traveling through the south. Very tasty and very easy! :)

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and it turned out great!  I love the idea of not pre-cooking the pasta first.  Would have given it 5 stars, but I added all of the extra spices mentioned by others, and I made magic happen when I generously sprinkled what I thought was ground cumin and came to realize it was ground cinnamon instead.  Extra spices, including red pepper flakes makes it quite tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed other suggestions and left out the egg and reduced the amount of cheese.  I ended up with a mass of mushy pasta.  And agree it was rather bland.  It was OK...but I won't make it again.  I would suggest using a very sharp cheddar cheese if you do try this recipe.

I've made this several times both with eggs and without. We love it both ways but my grandson is allergic to eggs so I usually only make without the eggs. Great easy recipe that can be thrown together in no time at all.

I made this for a company and they loved it. However, I left out the eggs, cut the cheese down to 3 cups and cooked it on high for 3-3 1/2 hours, and I did not cook the pasta first. I did not need to add any additional liquid. I did not stir or lift the lid during cooking.

I'm giving this one star, because if I would have cooked it as directed I would not have been able to eat it. It started to brown a lot after only 2 and a half hours on low, so after 5 to 6 it would have been completely burnt. Though it was edible after 2 hours, the noodles on top were not fully cooked, the sides were so browned and hardened I could not eat that part, and it was completely firm and clumped together. It tasted like a quiche, not like macaroni and cheese. I should have read the reviews before making it.

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with very very very dry tasteless noodles. I even added a little more milk to try to make it creamy, but it was basically mush.  It also was ready in about 2-3 hours not the 5 hours it required as per recipe.  Unfortunately I made it when I was having guests over.

I liked this recipe, it was very easy just needs a lil more seasoning but other than that i thought it was great especially since it was my first time makin mac and cheese that wasnt instant. I know what to expect next time and know how to make it perfect!!!!!

a little bland, would recommend adding some seasoning for flavor.  Followed cooking directions exactly and the bottom was burned.  Cook for less time and definitely stir it during cooking.  2 hours probably enough time.

It was really bad. It didn't even cook for an hour and it formed a hard goo ball, and when I tasted it, it didn't taste good at all. I do not recommend this to anyone.

This turned out to be a great recipe. I was a bit concerned due to some of the negative feedback but I omitted the eggs and partially cooked the pasta. When I first looked at it after the allotted cooking time, there appeared to be a lot of liquid left on top, but when I stirred it, it was perfect. This makes a custard style mac and cheese and maybe some do not like a non-creamy style of mac and cheese. All my guests raved about it and there was none left over!

this is very good.  I did not have caned milk so I added extra regular milk. I went to my local cheese shop and found pizza cheese so I thought i would give that a try. it turned out very good, the  pizza cheese added a kick to it, but it was too thick. it was good none the less. next time i think i will omit the eggs.

The taste is a little blah.  I am going to add a little dry mustard or use New York Sharp Cheese.  I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  Do not care for the texture.  The texture is strange!  perhaps if the eggs were eliminated the texture would be more creamy.  Some say the eggs are needed to prevent separation so will probably just cut out 1 egg.  It is easy to prepare.  Mine cooked fast.  It was done in 2 hours.  It was okay just not great.

I love this mac & cheese recipe, although I cook the macaroni first and cut the cheese back to 3 cups; otherwise it's just like what my Mom made when we were kids. This is REAL food, folks, and if you're used to boxed mixes and fake foods (ever looked at the ingredient list on Velveeta? scary!), then, no, you won't like it.

Super tasty!  Mine cooked in 2.5 hrs. using uncooked whole wheat macaroni in a large crockpot (my pot cooks hot, but that was still faster than I expected on low).  Used 3 c. cheese, added about 1/4 c. more milk half way through.  Sauce is quite "chunky" cause of the egg- bit like scrambled eggs... will try next time without simply because I'm not sure the picky kiddy will eat it.

This was pretty good.   I used only 1 egg and 3 cups of cheese (minus the cheese on top).   I also added a touch of hot sauce (to taste).    It was great leftover and reheated too.    I also added a cup of ham chunks to make it a roundabout meal.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone asked for the recipe despite it being overcooked at the edges! Many reviewers here said it was not creamy. I can't stand really creamy mac&cheese (Stouffer's, eg). This is more cafeteria-style (kids love it!). Be careful with cooking time--KNOW your crockpot and whether you usually need to short time or add time.  I made this the first time in a typical round pot--shouldn't have gone over 3-1/2 to 4 hours. Second time in an oval pot for 5 hours...perfect! Both times prepared using ingedients exactly as directed, but used SHARP cheddar cheese.  Next time may add 1/2 tsp mustard powder just to experiment.

I made this with the cheddar and didn't like it but I was so hung up on the idea that I replaced the cheddar with Velveeta.  I also par-cook the noodles.  This is now a potluck and holiday staple for me.  I also always add mustard and chopped onion!  There are NEVER any leftovers.   ***** with Velveeta cheese!

This is a good recipe but I don't prefer the eggs in it.  Also, mine cooked (without the eggs) in 1/2 the time so be careful.    If you want it a little creamier, leave out the eggs and add velveeta!

The flavor on this was great and I enjoyed the consistency unlike some other reviewers, but I might not cook it as long next time because it burnt to the sides of my slowcooker.

I was so excited to cook this in my  new slow cooker.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  When I arrived home from work, the edges were burnt and the whole thing is dry and unedible.  I may try it at a later date with a shorter cooking time, on a day that I will be home.

Very good recipe. I added in a can of crushed tomatoes for color and flavor. Next time I will try using multiple kinds of cheeses that are high quality to improve the dish instead of pre-shredded packaged cheese. Also, cooking time was less for my cooker - only took 4 hours and the edges started to burn so be careful of that.

Cooks in only 2 hours.  Do not cook macaroni first.  I added garlic powder with parsley and used only 1 egg.  I transfered it to an oven dish and broiled it until the top got a little crunchy (only because I needed to reheat it for dinner).  My family loved it and went back for thirds!

I made this dish only modified it by only adding one egg, and only using about 2 cups of regular milk. I also added garlic salt and ground mustard. I've made this twice so far. Once only using cheddar, and once using cheddar and about a cup of velveeta. I used less cheddar when I used the velveeta. Both ways was delish.  I precooked my pasta and 'baked' it in the crocpot on high for about two hours. It came out in nice slices and we had no leftovers.

I doubled this recipe and added 1 t. dry mustard & 1 t. garlic powder as well as half a large loaf of Velveeta.  We cooked it in our large oval crock pot for 5 hours on high.  Next time I will not use the eggs, they floated to the top and made a really icky topping that everyone scraped off, other than that all my kids loved it, totally a keeper!

i made this because i didnt feel like making real mac & cheese. i left out the eggs. (i dont like eggs in my mac &cheese) other than that i kept everything the same. USE A SLOW COOKER LINER, it makes clean up easy when you have to throw it all away.

Not great.  Edible, but not great.  The texture is not great.  The taste is... not great.  I will not do it again.

Came out alright. I apparently did not Grease the crockpot enough with cooking spray as a crunchy layer was formed around the crockpot walls, but the rest turned out really good!!

I wasn't thrilled with how it looked (curdled) but it tasted pretty good. Next time, I'll skip the eggs and the evaporated milk and see how that turns out.

Although the edges were nice and browned, the inside was  curdled.  Also, the evaporated milk gave it a slightly funny taste.  I liked the ease of the dish, I just wish the final product was better.

I took all of the sugestions about leaving out the eggs and not boiling the noodles. The recipe also states not to open the lid while cooking.  I let the crock pot sit for 3 hours and smelled something burning.  Since it was only burndt on the edges, we tasted the inside.  I also had my kids try it and we decided to throw it out.  Sorry.  It might help out to know what size crock pot one should use.

I made per instructions but scaled it up to 15 people.  I have a large crock pot and it was very very full.  It was wonderful.  I received rave reviews from my guests on Christmas Eve.  Thay all loved it.

I changed a few things and I really enjoyed it!  I used 3 cups sharp cheddar, a small block of velveeta.  I also added Emeril's 'Bayou Blast' seasoning (to taste), black pepper and Worchester Sauce and a drop of prepared horseradish.  Gave it a little kick!  My husband and daughter both loved it!

Cooked the ingredients for two hours on high, minimal burning, came out really fluffy. Added two cheeses, swiss and cheddar and a tad of extra milk. 

yummy

I read on another site that this recipe should have COOKED macaroni added at the beginning - not uncooked. It's worth a shot (though sort of takes away from the ease of slow cooking..)

I had a bad experience with this recipe. I think the cook time is way too long, or maybe mac and cheese is just not meant to be done in a slow cooker. It turned out like a big rubber brick. Maybe I did something wrong, however I followed the recipe exactly. Sorry.

Good, but not as good as my Mama's recipe. It also got pretty dried out after 5 hours, so I recommend keeping a close eye on it as it gets toward the halfway point.

The recipe sounded like it would be good, but it was not what we expected.  It was just one big clump.  the noodles were all stuck together and the flavor was bland.  My husband decribed it as "barely edible".

I took this to today's "retirement" potluck and everyone loved it.  Since I wasn't confident that a macaroni and cheese dish would turn out well in a crock I was pleasantly surprised.  My "good cook" status remains unchanged.  Thanks!

If you are wanting to throw away 4 cups of cheese, then this is your recipe...it is horrible!  I made this in my crockpot yesterday hoping for a nice dish to compliment dinner.  It was burnt around the edges (I followed the directions to the T), DRY.  and worse, it had NO TASTE whatsoever.  Thumbs down!!

I made this in a larger slow cooker so, as per the video instructions only cooked this for 3 hours which worked out well. It was pretty good and was all eaten at the potluck.

I give this recipe a 3 star for flavor but a 2 star overall.  I cooked this for 4.5 hours on LOW, having sprayed the crock with cooking spray and the bottom overcooked in many places. It was not the creamy texture I was looking for - i feel like I wasted 4 cups of cheese

Creamy and delicious. I make it every other week now. Sometimes I add a package of onion dip mix (Laura Scudders green onion dip) to give it a little oomph. So incredibly easy to make and comforting deliciousness to eat.

I've tried this recipe twice now; the first I followed the recipe exactly which tasted good but the eggs did scrambled. 
For my second attempt, I left out the eggs, used maybe 2.5 cups of cheese but kept the other ingredients and weights the same. I also added a little smoked paprika.
The second attempt came out quite thick so will add a little more milk next time.

I have a small crockpot, so halving the recipe worked perfectly. The meal tasted a little sweet, and the sauce could’ve been thickened more. But adding some hot sauce and more salt and pepper helped. Warmed up well for leftovers.

Good recipe.  Baked Mac & cheese was a weekend recipe for me but now that I can do so in slow cooker I know I’ll be making it more often.Didn’t spray my crock well enough so be sure to do so cause it stuck in a few places.  Will be fun to try some fun cheese combinations.

DELICIOUS! I made this today as a “test recipe” for an upcoming family party. It came out fantastic! I used egg beaters (did not have eggs) and gluten free elbow pasta.  Can’t wait to make this again!!

Turned out so good that my husband (who doesn't like Mac  n cheese)  loved it!  I read all the other reviews and made changes.  The idea that the recipe was intended for a 3 qt crock pot  vs 6 was spot on, (i have a lg 6 qt) so i took that reviewers advice....  I cooked everything on low for 2 hours.  I, however,  then cranked it up to high for an extra 30 min.  It was like baked mac n cheese but with more flavor!   I also used these two cans of cheese soup rather than the single can of evaporated milk and only used one egg.  Next time I'll try the original way with the can of evaporated milk just to be sure.  Oh!  I also added dry mustard and smoked paprika.  Excellent recipe!

Doubled the recipe, still came out ok, but I cooked it on high for an hour, then low for an hour (should have left it on high).  Came out soupy (wonder why LOL) so I added another cup of cooked small pasta and another cup of cheese (Provolone this time instead of the sharp cheddar I had used).  Stirred well, then put on high and cooked another half hour.  PERFECT!   Had three requests for the recipe at the picnic!  LOL  So easy and so good!!

I made this recipe tonight for the kids. I did add some dry mustard and paperika... I followed the rest of the ingrediants. I read other reviews before i made it when i should not have. I cut the cooking time too soon. It could have used the full cook time stated in tge recipe... I was scared cause so many said it was too long. The flavor was good. The kids loved it... A little toomuch soupy cheese cause i stopped cooking it after three hours.... Should have kept going. Then it would have been more like a set baked mac and cheese. Still the flavor was wonderful. The pasta was cooked... Just needed that extra drying out time.

Please note that I made 3 minor alterations: added a bit more cheese (parmesan romano, large grate), added more spices (which I do to basically every recipe ever), and I only cooked it for 4 hours, because it smelled done. But that's it!

What a winner!
I don't understand the complaints about this recipe! Really: this is the totally easiest recipe I maybe have ever made, ever - and it's delicious.
Just like most over-baked pasta dishes, there's a 'lack of creaminess' and a 'custardy-ness' to it, I suppose... but that's primarily a difference in baking over cooking, and has a lot more to do with cooking dry pasta without the typical boil-and-drain than the eggs.
I did not find the additions of the eggs to be either an issue or a detriment to texture or taste, and it adds some needed balance in the nutrition category because - let's face it - mac n cheese isn't exactly health food.
And both my nearly-40-year-old, bacon-obsessed husband and my 11 1/2-month-old gobbled this up, too!
I didn't LOVE the addition of the evaporated milk, because it's the only thing in the recipe I don't usually stock, so I'm going to try to do it with a slightly upped amount of all whole milk next time. And I'll be changing the cooking time, due to my slow cooker running a little hot, to 3.5 hours. Or shift it from 'low' to 'warm' at the three hour mark, and cook a total of four.

Seriously, I looked long and hard for the right one-pot, no boil, slow cooker mac n cheese recipe, and this is it!

Tasty enough but it turned out rather gummy.   Challenge with slow cooker recipes is that there is a wide variation between slow cookers, their temperatures and other settings.

A spectacular DISASTER for me this Thanksgiving. I'm giving it one star because it may have been a faulty crock-pot (I did set it on low for the suggested amount of time), but it came out like a crunchy cement block with just as much flavor as you would expect a cement block to have. NOTE TO SELF: Never, never, NEVER serve untried recipes on such an important Food Holiday!! That is all.

It was done a lot quicker than mentioned. It was ready before the four hour mark. It was great when I tried it. When it came close to dinner time it was drying out. Very very good though. I didn't use eggs at all. I used two cups of medium cheddar and 2 cups 3 cheese Mexican blend. Will most definitely be making it again.

I added some dry mustard, garlic and onion powder to it since I like a bit more flavour. I used almond milk since that the only kind of milk I have in the house. It all worked out great.

I tried this recipe and followed it as written.  However, it was too sticky and lacked flavor.  The next time I make it, I will follow some of the suggestions and omit the eggs, boil the macaroni , and reduce the cooking time.  Perhaps add a bit of onion and/or cayenne pepper.

I made this side dish for my family.  They loved it and after just 3 days of eating it, they were putting in requests for more.  I did this a little different from the original recipe.  First, I cooked my elbow noodles until they were al dente.  This cut my slow cooker cooking time down to 2 hours.  I used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses which gave it a little bite, but not spicy at all.  It was wonderful

I made the following changes and it came out wonderful. Omitted  the eggs and instead used 1 Tbl. of corn starch mixed in with cold lactose free milk (we're lactose intolerant), skipped the evap. milk and increased the LF milk to 3 1/2 c, added 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tsp spicy brown mustard, used Cabot LF white sharp cheddar cheese. Mixed everything right in the crock pot including uncooked elbows. Stirred every 30 minutes while cooking on hi for 2 1/2 hours. Probably could have backed the cheese down to 3 cups.

I made this exactly as directed, and it turned out awesome. It comes out just like baked mac & cheese, which is what I was looking for! I will make this again, in fact, I am making it for Thanksgiving.

I love this Mac and Cheese! My grandmother always made the most amazing, custard like, mac and cheese but she did everything by "feel" and had learned how to make it from her mother. When she passed away no one was able to recreate the magic and I was desperate to find something that wasn't the fake cheese, creamy, velveta like stuff that seems to popular. Finding this recipe was a god send, it tastes so much like my grandmothers and is so easy to make, I can't ever make enough for family events, it is gone instantly. Thank you for postings this perfect recipe!!

Love that I could use uncooked pasta.  (I used GF). I used a Australian Cheddar - yum, yum. I also had a large slow cooker so I think the shorter time would have been better, not so dry. But none the less , it was delicious. 
Tip: I didn't have condensed milk.  I looked up substitutions. One suggestion was to cook milk until volume reduced by half BUT another suggestion was to mix 1 cup of powered milk and 1 1/4 cup of water. #2 worked perfectly.

Homemade mac and cheese was a struggle for me until I found this recipe!  Very easy to make and tastes just like mac and cheese should.  I never liked the recipes where you make beshamel and add onions.  And the best part, the top isn't burned or hard from being in the oven!

Had a day dedicated to yard work and some time in the pool afterward, so I wanted a meal that could be prepared early in the day and good-to-go at dinner time (salmon patties, coleslaw, and mac & cheese).  I think the key to success on this recipe is to not overcook it.  I used 2% Kraft® sharp cheese, skim milk (plus evaporated) and followed the directions with the exception of the cooking time.  I read the reviews, and many said it was done at 3 hr instead of 5 to 6, so I checked at 2 hr 45 minutes.  At that point, it already was a little overdone, so in the future I'll turn off the heat at 2-1/2 hr.  The center of the mac cheese may be a little soupy, but if you check around the edges, they're very brown, a bit dry, but the elbow macs are cooked.  Once you give it a stir, it will be creamy (as long as you don't overcook it).  I wouldn't say that I like this better than my homemade mac & cheese made with a cheese sauce and baked in the oven.  But I will say that this was pretty darn good for basically mixing everything together (not even cooking the macaroni), pouring it into a crock pot, and letting it do its thing.  For taste, I'd give this a 5, but the timing is so off, that I'm giving it a 4-star rating.  Just start checking for doneness at about 2-1/2 hours.

This is definitely more like a baked mac than a creamy mac (unless you leave out the egg and sub milk for the evaporated milk).  I added some seasonings and less cheese than called for.  Mine was done quicker - but very tasty.  Would be lovely with some breadcrumbs on top too.  Good recipe - but not great without a little extra seasoning (dry mustard, seasoning salt and garlic powder)

Made this according to the recipe except that I only used one egg, about 3 cups of sharp cheddar and about 1 1/2 cups of velveeta (our son tends to like that flavor), a few dashes of garlic salt, and a dash of ground mustard. Turned on high and in about 1 1/2 hrs. it was already bubbly and turning brown on the bottom. Switched to the warm setting until we were ready to eat. Definitely don't pre-cook the Mac as it would be mushy for sure! Great recipe.

I love it! Who knew you could make mac and cheese in a slow cooker? I changed a few things due to stock on hand, and personal preferences. It still came out great.

I used whole wheat rotini. We don't use milk, so I substituted with almond milk, and substituted evaporated milk with powdered buttermilk (I keep in fridge for recipes), then added 1/4 cup Parmesan. Omitted salt.  Next time I will remember to add the mustard powder.

I have been making this since last year and my family loves it. I usually make one lb of macaroni and I add ham to make it a complete meal.  I have tried it with one egg and two and I find it is good both ways.  I usually have evaporated milk on hand so I have not  tried it without it yet. I do increase the milk to 2 1/2 to 3 cups to accommodate for the extra macaroni.  I use about 3 cups of cheese as well. Great basic recipe to tweak to your own taste. This is on my go to list.

I use recipes as starting points and this one is great. I used one egg and only 3 cups of shredded  cheddar. Combined that in the pre-sprayed crock with the uncooked macaroni and 1 lb. of cubed smoked ham, 1/2 cup minced onion and 1/2 cup minced green pepper and 1 T. Butter. Cooked on high for one hour then low for two hours. Perfect! I have an oval 6 quart slow cooker so times have been adjusted. Needed a main dish casserole. This shines! Very creamy and cheesy. Served with steamed fresh green beans and hoe cakes. Play with the recipe and make it yours.

Okay, so I made this today and it was delicious. I was very nervous because I put it all in the crock pot and then read the reviews. I'm going to simplify it for everyone right now: If you want SOUTHERN macaroni and cheese use this recipe. It tastes like you're at your grandmas house for Thanksgiving. I thought it turned out perfect, however, I only let it cook for four hours versus the recommended six. It is very moist and just what I wanted. Next time I might add half pepper jack cheese to spice it up a bit but overall I was very pleased with this dish.

I live full time in a small travel trailer in Texas.  Slow cooker recipes are a necessity.  I tweaked this just a little by adding some blue cheese.  Rave reviews!!  Plan on a little goat cheese as well next time to amp up the creaminess.  Excellent recipe.

This is a great, easy and delicious recipe. The only thing I would recommend is cutting the slow cooker time down to 4 hours. It says 5 - 6 hours, I did 5 and it came out a little overcooked.

Every time I make this, I get many requests for the recipe. People LOVE it, and it could not be easier. It is not a creamy mac and cheese, but holds together and has a great flavor. It's my "go to" recipe for pot lucks.

I followed the recipe to the t but I did add a half tablespoon of dry mustard along with a tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning and Siracha because I love a little fire.  I don't like the eggs in it though. I only used one egg and it still made a weird cheesy custardy type feel to it. Next time, no eggs and an extra half cup of mile like they show in the video. Egg sort of ruined it.

Cheesy!  Cooked on low for 5 hours - formed a nice crust around the sides. That is the part we liked best. Also liked the fact that it did not look like it just came out of a box. Hubby will never settle for that substitute again when this dish is so good.

This worked well for me.  I was skeptical since I have not done it without cooking the macaroni first.  I did add melted butter to the recipe, about 2 T.  I also just used whole milk, 3 C, rather than the milk and evaporated milk.  My kids gobbled it up.  I also like the eggs in the recipe, we don't mind that it is not a creamy mac and cheese.  It's more of a sticky one.  I accidentally left the crock pot on high and it cooked within 2 hours then started to burn.  It did not curdle though, luckily someone was home to turn it to 'keep warm'.  If you are used to Velveeta tasting mac n cheese you will think this recipe bland.  We love the taste of it though, it is more like homemade.  I like that this recipe does not require Velveeta or canned soup although I bet those are TASTY additions.  We like to keep it without the additional processed foods.

Rubbery noodles. If I had waited 5-6 hrs it would have been burnt up. Followed every step and ingredient.

tasted good but burned around the edges and had to throw a lot of it out, even if I didn't throw it out there is no way that it made six servings.  If I want to make a pound of  macaroni I would need to double everything, that seems excessive, I am going to try other recipes or adjust this one. Maybe you need to stir so it doesn't burn or cut down on the cooking time, I cooked it on low for five hours.

I made this for my 5 year-old son's birthday party and it was a hit among both kids and parents alike! I made a few small changes after reading some of the reviews here. My changes: I doubled the recipe; used 2 eggs total; stirred in all but a handful of cheddar cheese (which I added to the top 30 min before serving; added 2 tsp. total of dry mustard; cooked it on high for one hour, then low for three hours; stirred the ingredients about once an hour. The bottom burned a little bit but it wasn't too bad. I'd definitely make this again, and a couple parents asked me for the recipe too!

This is absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly as written, and it could not be easier.  The only thing is, I checked it after 3.5 hours, and it was done!  So, even better, it's ready much faster than the recipe says.  This is probably the BEST Mac and Cheese I've ever had, and it was so simple!  I use sharp cheese, by the way!

This macaroni and cheese was very dry and no flavor at all. The cheese clumped up and was not creamy. Just overall very bland.

I won't make this recipe again.  I should have not listened to the directions not to stir it because it is burned around the edges after about 2 and 1/2 hours on low and stuck in a solid lump shaped like the crock.  I also noticed that the ingredients list salt and pepper but in the mixing instructions they never told you when to put them in.  I put them in the milk and egg mixture.  If you are looking for a good mac and cheese recipe, keep on looking.  I gave it one star because the website wouldn't let me not give it any.

After reading other reviews of this, I modified the original recipe as well.  I didn't add eggs, but added dry mustard and paprika, and cooked it for 2 hours (in a 5 qt crock pot).  The texture was fine, but there was no flavor to it at all.  I won't make mac and cheese like this again.

I liked the recipe,  I do think that depending on type of cheese used and slow cooker used will depend on how the mac and cheese turned out. No complaints here. I did not use eggs just reading what others said, I did use evap milk and reg milk, tsp of dry mustard and I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese. If I had velveeta I would of tried that but Im all about using what I got. OH, it only took me 2 hours to cook in my slow cooker!

I've made this a few times for my family and it is a big hit.  I do add 1 tsp of dry mustard.  After reading some of the reviews, I think I will cut back on the eggs to get a more creamy sauce.  It's starred in  my recipe file as a favorite.

Flavor was not bad, but texture was not what I had planned.  Definitely was more like a baked mac & cheese.  I did add milk several more times and stirred it.  Cooked on high about 1 hour to get it going and then went to low for maybe another hour.

When I read this recipe I thought 'no slow cooker' could ever make a mac & cheese that compare to one baked in the oven. BOY was I surprised! My husband and I both LOVED it!!  It was nice to be able to enjoy a 'baked' dish without heating up the kitchen. Only thing I differently is that I cooked the macaroni for 4 min before mixing the recipe. This one is a KEEPER!!!

Made this for the family and they LOVED it!  It turned out perfectly and I made it exactly listed!  I am making it again tonight but adding mustard powder to it for a different flavor!  I also did not add enough salt and pepper the first time, but that was just my taste.  The family didn't even notice!

I followed the modifications listed on this site and it turned out pretty good. I left out the eggs so it would be creamy. I used 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 2 cans cheddar cheese soup, 2 1/2 cups milk, 1 can evaporated milk and 1/2 pound of noodles. We crushed Cheeze-Its on top. I gave it four stars only because I think next time I'll leave out the evaporated milk...It gave it kind of a funny taste. Overall though, my family loved it, especially my one year old! I'll keep making it!

Modified slightly by using more cheese and using 2-1/2 cups Colby, 2-1/2 cups Med. Cheddar and 4 slices of Velveeta cut up. Also added 1/4 t dry mustard. 5 hours in slow cooker was perfect. Found out it was the first time my wife ever had homemade mac & cheese.Not the last though.

I had some great crock pot mac & cheese at a church potluck once--I have been looking for this recipe forever.    Yes, I added the dry mustard and tweaked it out a bit, I noticed that others did too.  I believe that adding something special to make it your own is what separates those of us who can really cook vs. others that rely on just following a recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This was pretty good but could use more seasoning for me.  I added extra salt because it was bland and some cayenne as well.  I cooked the macaroni about 5 minutes and added it in with the rest of the ingredients.  I only cooked mine for 2 hours on high and it could have been cooked less.  If you want really creamy mac and cheese you will need to add more liquid since this was dry or use less eggs.  Good recipe just needs more flavor for me.

This turned out really well for me. I used a lowfat (2%) shredded sharp cheddar and fat free evaporated milk. I did add 1 teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder, a tablespoon each of Frank's Hot Sauce and dijon mustard and a cup of chopped ham. NO LEFTOVERS. I had a bite and I thought it was good, but it wasn't my favorite. I didn't like the fluffy texture but it's one of the better crockpot macaroni and cheese recipes I've made. NOTE: I have to tell you that I did cook my macaroni only about halfway through and I did cook it the remainder with the ingredients for about three hours in the crockpot. I've always had issues with my macaroni coming out raw when I cook it in the crockpot.

I have really enjoyed this recipe each time I've made it.  It is clearly for those who want a gooey, custardy mac-and-cheese (think Southern diner/cafeteria-style), not your traditional Kraft-in-a-box.  I prefer it with one egg, and I usually cook the macaroni first.

I cooked this for 5 hours on low and it came out dry and mushy. I like creamy mac n cheese and this recipe did not give me that.

I doubled the recipe but left out the eggs. It was wonderful! Made it wil 4 cups (1lb) of a preshredded mexican cheese mix. It was ready in 3 hours on low. I did add cut up hotdogs for the last 30 min. Wonderful addition to my cookbook. Perfect for the snowy day we are having!

I discovered that 6 hours is WAY too long to cook this as it turned out very rubbery.  But the flavor was good so I'm sure it would be excellent overall if cooked for a shorter time.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe; but it didn't turn out as I expected.  For some reason, this cooked in my slow cooker on low in two hours.  If I hadn't decided to give it a stir before I went out I would have come home to a burnt mess.  I did omit the eggs and added 2 Tbs. of cornstarch, because my children like the "creamy" style.  I think I'll do this again, but I'll put it together later in the day.

I loved it! I agree with other reviewers this is a true Southern macaroni and cheese. Reminds me of the one they serve in Piccadilly. Only change I made was add a bit of white pepper and dry mustard. I also agree with another reviewer that you need to stir while cooking and I found that I had to add some more milk after 3 hours. Def not a dish you can cook while at work

This is a GREAT recipe. It is just like homemade. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little dry mustard. I cooked it on low for 3 hours and my family loved it! Definitely a keeper.

Even cooking this for just 3 hours and reducing it down to 1 egg only vs. 2, it was pastey/grainy in texture and nearly overcooked.   I think this concept has promise, but this recipe needs some major refining and experimenting.  I plan to make it again without an egg, and will cook it less time -- oh, and also I stirred it twice during cooking - can't imagine the sludge I would have had if I had not done that.

I reduced the amount of cheese substantially and it was still too cheesy.  It was not appealing to the eye and was too liquidy.  Taste was not consistant.

This is the first time making mac n cheese.I had some friends over for comfort nite, this dish did not turn out for me!! I followed the directions to a "T" & it came out clumpy, not creamy! I would be better off using Velveeta cheese & following there recipe. Will never make this dish again.

The cooking time on this recipe was way too long.  I put it on keep warm after four hours, and it was already overcooked.  Plus, it came out congealed and custard like, not creamy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I used 4 cups of cheddar cheese in the actual mix and about 1 cup on top, but I put it on later while cooking. I did have to stir mine about an hour after it started cooking. It was burning on the bottom, so I stirred it a couple times. It only cooked for about 3.5hrs. Overall, it was delicious.

I liked this mac and cheese recipe, very easy. I would not cook it that many hours, I only did 3 1/2 hours
and that was plenty, and I do stir my crock pot items before they are done.
After 2 hours I stirred it. I also added a little velvetta and I used extra sharp cheese , and plenty of grated onion in it
salt and pepper too. If you like a custard texture to mac and cheese you will like this

I made this twice. Once with a store brand sharp cheddar and once with a premium brand. It does make a difference. To really not end up with a bland dish you have to use a premium brand cheese. I also added a bit of provolone. Came out great! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't reheat well the next day and all mac and cheese should be great leftovers.

The macaroni cooked perfectly and as directed, I never lifted the lid.  As other reviewers stated, I used only 1 egg and added 1/2 tsp dry mustard.  I served it in bowls and everyone left over 2/3 of the bowl.  Sorry but I'll never make this again.  Bland, puffy and just no real flavor.

This took me less than five minutes to put in the crock pot!  The ingredients were cheap and easy to find.  It was delicious fresh from the pot as well.  The only problem was that it stuck together a lot when reheating.
