This hummus recipe tastes great, thank you! A word of advice: chop up your chives very fine. You'll thank me later.

Following the recipe I found the paprika and salt too strong. I then doubled the volume of pinto beans and added a little more lemon and it worked well. I also did not have much chives (about a 1/4 tsp), but didn't think it needed any more.

This was easy and tasted great... the sunflower seeds gave a nice texture and good flavor. I think I used a little less lemon.. just personal preference
