Do not serve this right away!  Make in the morning for a dinner meal, or better yet, make it the day before.  Otherwise you taste too much vinegar.  So delicious, though, I could have eaten the entire bowl!  I doubled the recipe and used a large carrot as well as a large cucumber, so didn't measure.  Also followed another's suggestion to soften the cherries.  I cut the cherries to have smaller pieces, which worked out better with my small diced veggies.  You could make this with any dried fruit you had on hand - next time I'll try apricots. Edit/Updated:  Also, using a dark balsamic vinegar creates a brown salad, so use white balsamic or regular vinegar to keep the brightness of the couscous and veggies.  Still delicious!

What a delightful blend of flavor, texture and color!  I used whole wheat couscous and dried cranberries instead of cherries (what I had in my pantry).  I love the dressing and the combination of flavors - the pine nuts, cranberries, crunchy veggies - it's great.  I served it as a side dish to "Balsamic-Glazed Salmon Fillets" from this site.  Highly recommmend this salad!

This was better the next day after the flavors had blended. The only changes made were to use a whole carrot, a whole cucumber and added 1/2 a red bell pepper and 1/2 a green bell pepper. Will definitly make this aging.

Quick, easy and delicious!  I added some baby spinach and used quinoa instead of couscous - kept everything else the same!  I used 1 cup dry quinoa, simmered in 2 cups veggie broth for 15 min.  I think it would be delicious with couscous or even orzo pasta!  I also chopped the dried cherries up as they are pretty large.  Update :  day 2 - didnt care for the mustard taste and the cherries - I had to change my 5 star to 4 - its still good :)  I will leave out the mustard next time - the flavor was much stronger after sitting over night.

I've made this recipe numerous times and get rave reviews.  I always double recipe and use dried cranberries.  I've also made it using raspberry balsamic vinegar and honey Dijon mustard.  My family loves this salad.

This was very good! I was making 'Cold Roasted Moroccan Salmon' from this web site and wanted a side that would work well with it. This couscous fit the bill! I used dried cranberries instead of cherries, because that was what I had. The only thing I added was a drizzle of lemon juice over the top before I served it. Delicious!

My boyfriend and I have been trying to add different grains to our menu, but our first couscous attempt was a little bland - he described it as sawdust.  I tried this even though I wasn't sure about the blend of flavors.  We both thought it was great and he gladly took leftovers for lunch the next day!  I used orange-flavored Craisins because it was what I had.  I was worried they might be too sweet, but they were not.  I did pre-plump them as was suggested.  Light and tasty summer recipe.  Will definitely make again.

My husband is part Lebanese so I usually have all of these ingredients on hand.  I only added fresh lemon juice right before serving.  We don't typically eat couscous without it.  This is a very refreshing recipe.  Good for you too.  Everyone loved it so I guess this one is a keeper.

This dish is delicious! I served it to my book club group and they all liked it. To make this dish easier for entertaining I cooked couscous, chopped all the veggies and put in a bowl into the fridge a few hours before the event. I added the dressing and nuts about an hour before. This gave the cucumbers enough time to absorb dressing and almost gave them a pickled flavor.  So, I liked it so much I ate the leftovers for breakfast. After soaking in the dressing overnight the salad still had a nice flavor but all the veggies had taken on the dressing flavor. I suggest making this dish no more than two hours in advance with the dressing so that the variety of flavors from the veggies stays prevalent.

I made this with the Moroccan Spiced Salmon from this site as another reviewer did and found they went well together. I did use packaged seasoned couscous with pine nuts to save time. Would make again.

This received rave reviews from guests!  I doubled the recipe but found that I did not need to double the dressing - I only added about 3/4 of it.  Also, it is easy to make ahead, just keep the dressing separate until serving.  I put about a tsp of olive oil in the couscous mixture before refrigerating, to keep it from sticking.  Then I added the dressing right before serving.

This recipe is super easy and it's a great dish to spice up any entree.  The pine nuts gives it an interesting kick.  All of the veggies work wonderfully together.  I won't give it all 5 stars. I wish they had a 1/2 size, because I'd give it 4.5

This is my first review, but just had to say that this such a versatile recipe that you can use anything that you have on hand to add. The first time I made it as written, after that I have made it with all kinds of variations according to what I have available. No matter where I have taken it or who I have shared it with...everyone wants the recipe. You can't go wrong with it. It is even better a few days later.

My error ends up with a 3 star.  I used reconstituted mustard powder, a Tbsp was FAR too much.  Cleared my sinus' in seconds.  Have made more coucous and testing half'n half but still too strong.  I will try adding more cucumbers as well.  Thank goodness I wasn't making this for company!   But I'm sure, done properly, it will be a 5 star!

Great and easy recipe. I added sm chopped red peppers and some fresh minced parsley. Both gave great appealing colors, yet didn't affect the taste. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was very good and everyone in my family liked it, but it isn't quite a 5 star dish in my opinion. Maybe my balsamic vinegar is a little off, but the flavor was slightly off. That being said, I will make this again, but try using a different balsamic or perhaps a little less.

Delicious! I subbed Craisins for cherries and added a touch of balsamic. Made this the night before and it was just right the next day for lunch.

This is really, really good.  I didn't have dried cherries, so I used raisins, which was yummy.  I agree with other reviews, this salad is even better one or two days later.  It's great to take in a lunch, since its filling and low fat.  A definite keeper!

I added some salmon to make it a main dish and some frozen peas (they thaw quickly) and some bell peppers.  Yum!  Everyone loved it, even the picky 7 & 10 year olds.  I added the dried cherries to the broth when I added the couscous, that way they plumped up and were even more flavorful.

I didn't have onions or cranberries or cucs so I used grapes and extra carrots.  I ended up adding more couscous because the dressing was too much.  I really liked it and it would be even better w/ cucumbers and onions I bet (and less balsamic).

Very yummy and refreshing and easy to make. I used a regular onion, dried cranberries and regular mustard because that is what I had in the house and it was really good, and would have been great had I had all the actual ingredients. Something different with stuff you probably already have in your house!

flavorful and fresh tasting! it did seem heavy on the mustard though, so i added a little bit of honey to even it out. this is a great summer side dish!

My husband loved this.  I didn't care for it.  I thought the mustard taste was a wee bit overpowering and it clashed with the cherries, badly.  Since hubby loved it I will try again, but using dried sweet cherries instead of dried sour cherries.  I think they might go better with the dressing.

Very quick and easy.  Try using whole wheat couscous for a light and delicous meal or side.

I made this as the recipe is written. I ended up making a half batch more of the dressing. Big hit at the BBQ!

Very flavorful!  Did not use the green onions and substituted Craisins for the cherries.  Doubled it since we ate it as a main dish.  Does not need much extra salt to taste.  Couscous cooled quickly and recipe was quick to prepare.  Will make again, for sure.

I brought this salad to an office pot luck and got rave reviews.  It's easy and quick to make.  I made everything the night before and just mixed it together right before serving.
