I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. I didn't think I would like the lemon that much, but it was sooo good and not too strong of a lemon taste.

LOVE THIS CAKE. I USE THE LEMON CAKE AND PUDDING. I LEAVE OUT THE SUGAR IN THE PUDDING. DON'T NEED IT. PLENTY SWEET ENOUGH. IF I HAVE A LEMON I ADD A LITTLE LEMON PEAL INTO BATTER AND PUDDING.

Delicious!  I'm eating it now.  It's a very easy cake to put together.  Mine only took 40 minutes to bake, and I probably would even take about 3-5 minutes off that next time.  Follow the directions for the baking time for the box cake you use.  I prefer more lemon flavor, so next time I'll use the lemon box cake.  The lemon pudding flavor is very light when it's warm.  I didn't use the raspberries either, just cooled the cake for about 5 minutes and then served it.  I'll definitely use this recipe again and try it with different flavor cakes and puddings!

Very good and simple recipe. I will definately be making this again. I made this as directed but I also made a chocolate version with devils food cake mix and chocolate pudding. I also served them both cold, very well received!!!

Delicious!  I used a box of lemon cake mix and lemon pudding and it was given 5 stars by all at our Super Bowl Party!!  I'm anxious to taste the leftovers tomorrow.

My husband and I both found this recipe to be merely ok.  I was not bad by any means but it was lacking something that would make it taste great.

This is the same recipe from the Kraft site - minus the raspberries.  Awesome cake.

This was good.  I thought the pudding would be firmer and more cooked into the cake.  Need to cool a bit longer if you want it firmer. I'd like to experiment w/ a Rocky Road--chocolate cake & pudding, caramel bits/chips (or caramel pudding?), marshmallows, pecans.
