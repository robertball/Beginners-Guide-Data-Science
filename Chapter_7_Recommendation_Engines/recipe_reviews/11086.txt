I make no less than ten varieties of Norwegian cookies every Christmas, this is one of my very favorities. The recipe is very easy to follow, the cookies always come out perfect, and keep a long time. Thanks for sharing!
PS If you are wary of a cookie containing pepper, don't be! These are unique and delicious.

I liked these cookies. The dough was a bit crumbly after I took it out of the refrigerator, but they baked nicely. I liked the fact they aren't overly sweet. I made them over a week ago and they are still as fresh as day one.

Love this cookie! Spicy, crisp, a little sweet and perfect with coffee or hot cocoa. Do slice thinly if you want a crispy crunch.

These were a nice change from super sweet cookies; they taste like spiced shortbread. Pretty easy cookie to make.  The hardest part was making the dough log and keeping the cookies in a circle shape when cutting. I doubled the recipie but mixed both batches at the same time in my kitchenaid mixer.  I don't reccomend doing this as it doesn't all fit in the bowl! Also the cardamom was like $13! Oh well, live and learn.

A different little cookie but very good.  You experience spicyness after your last bite.  My child took this to school for Heritage day and even the kids liked them.

I really liked this cookie-- good tasting, easy to make, and a little different.  I used coriander instead of cardamom (long story!) but next year for Christmas, I would like to make them as they were originally intended.

A very good cookie.  If naming this cookie to match the taste, it would be called a cardamon cookie, as this is the taste that comes through of all the spices.  Very tasty

I had been looking for a recipe that was similar to my Grandma Judy's Norwegian Pepper Cookies recipe.  This was it!!!!  Delicious, and exactly how I remember them from when I was little.

I baked these cookies for my daughter's Girl Scout event. Had never heard of them before, but they are really good.    For someone who isn't usually a baker, the recipe could have been clearer -- I made the dough two days before baking , which was fine, but the cookies fall apart when removed from the cookie sheet.   They do taste yummy though!

These were especially good with coffee.  Cardamom spice was a little pricey.

These cookies are awsome.  I love the peppery after taste.  It takes a few minutes to get the full effect of the spices, but they are truly fabulous.

These are delicious! Even before they were baked. I forgot to add baking powder, but I doubt that affected the taste much. They're really easy to make, which is always a plus. Even my boyfriend liked them, and his tastes are radically different from mine, and he made a face at the idea of pepper cookies when I told him I was going to make some.

My family originated from Norway and I never heard of these before.  But I made them for my son as an extra credit for a report on Norway for his class.  I cut the cookie into fourths thinking everyone would at least get to try.  To my surprise they came out of the oven the same way they went in!  They did not melt like a sugar cookie.  The kids looked at them and thought they were dog biscuits!  But they tasted great!  I don't know if I did anything wrong?  I followed the recipe exactly.  BTW, my son got an A.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe, I left them in the fridge over night and baked the next day.  Everyone that has tried them just loved them.  I cut back 1/2 tsp on the cardamon, added an extra sprinkle of cinnamon and some fresh ground pepper, and they really tasted great.

Great cookies.  They are crunchy and delicious.  The next time I make them, I might roll the slices before I bake them to get them a little thinner, and crispier.  I plan to serve them alongside sorbet, and they turned out great!

I made this for a cookie exchange party.   The directions were easy to follow and the recipe came out just as I expected.  I would like it to be a little spicier but it was quite good.  Not the most attractive cookie ever so I would consider adding some sort of icing or powdered sugar coating just to pretty it up a bit.

I. Can't. Stop. Eating. Them! This makes about 150 cookies. Make the dough the day before. Form into 2 logs wrapped in parchment paper. The next day, slice them about 1/4 inch thick and bake on parchment paper. Easy! Delicious!

Fabulous taste.  It reminds of Chai Tea.  I was a little disappointed that my cookies needed more time to bake for some reason and since I don't like very crunchy cookies, it was hard to figure out when to take them out of the oven. Some became too crunchy, and the other sheet needed more crunch. I'll figure it out!

These. Are. Amazing. I love the warmth that the pepper adds. I might even add more next time. Mine took a bit longer to bake than suggested, but no complaints here; every oven is different. YUM, and thanks for a great recipe!

Everyone loved these at Thanksgiving! Both the spice lovers and even my "beige food only" family members liked them! They were all gone.I made it as directed. I wasn't sure if the soda was supposed to dissolve in the water first before adding. I didn't do that. I put in the soda and added a teaspoon of water then it dawned on me I probably skipped a step. Just made sure it was evenly distributed and the dough was very nice and easy to work with. I would recommend using the best quality spice possible since they are the highlight of the cookie. I personally might like a little more spice but I eat jalapeños for breakfast. The recipe was requested. Thank you so much for sharing.

I like it enough because it calls for unique ingredients and is easy to make. However, it does not have the WoW factor. I'm going to serve it with homemade chai latte, because both use cinnamon and cardamom. By the way, cardamon is much cheaper in an Indian store.

This cookie is a favorite of everyone who tries it and can get past the name.  Not overly sweet and the pepper intensifies the lovely cardamom flavor.  The dough is a bit crumbly to cut after it is refrigerated.  Leaving it out on the counter to warm 20 minutes or so does help.  Also, this is a very plain looking cookie.  I have brushed the tops of portions of the batch with milk and sprinkled with coarse, colored sanding sugar to make them fit a broader range of tastes.  Definitely try this recipe.  You will not be sorry.

This recipe was okay. Needs a bit more on the spice aspect - also they come out as hard cookies, if you want them soft cook them a tad less by a minute or two.

A very good cookie. I halved the amount of cardamom (it's expensive) and they came out perfect.
