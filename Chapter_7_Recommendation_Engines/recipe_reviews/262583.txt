Definitely reduce the cayenne pepper. Probably won't make again just because lamb doesn't need such aggressive seasoning, IMO. The sauce pairs excellently, however.

Followed instructions from Cook's Illustrated for meat preparation. Make sure to remove extra fat and silver skin. Sear in a skillet with olive oil until crispy (about 2 minutes a side) after applying spice rub. I roasted 5 racks in oven for 12 minutes, separated ribs, meat was very rare. I placed back in oven for 6 more minutes - it was perfect!!

I used only salt and pepper on the rack of lamb and the sauce was 1 clove of garlic, one bunch cilantro, one bunch mint, oil and vinegar to make a chimichurri sauce.
