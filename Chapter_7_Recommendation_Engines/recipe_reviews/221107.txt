I made this recipe exactly as written with exception of peppers (we don't care for them and I feel they overpower). The only thing that I think the recipe needs (that isn't written) is it needs to sit for AT LEAST a day.  I will make again - 2 days before. I will add the cranberries the day before and the sunflower seeds the day we eat it.  Flavors go great together!

I will cut the ingrediants for the dressing in half next time as it was a little too much for me, but the overall recipe is delicious!

This recipe is really good as it is, but it's also great with other favorites added to it. I added chopped walnuts and chia seeds. The amount of dressing can be cut in half. Otherwise, there is a lot of it at the bottom of the bowl.

I took advice and let it meld together for 24 hours. This is my new favorite edamame recipe. I ate it with tortilla chips and YUM!

One of the best salads I’ve ever made. Incredible flavor and love that it’s so healthy. It was a big hit and will be made many more times. Made it on Sunday to take as a lunch during the week, seemed to even get better day two and three.

Love all of the ingredients and made it 2 times now.  The first time I didn’t put the cranberries in-the second time I did. The outcome of the first try was ok but the flavors needed to sink in.  After reading other reviews, the second time I mixed everything together and let it sit in the fridge for 24 hours.  THAT is the key to this salad!!   It was absolutely phenomenal and all the veggies were still crunchy.  I mixed it around a couple of times too while it sat.  I did not use the sunflower seeds either time.   Very colorful salad with lots of flavor!  Will certainly make again!

Great way to have a protein filled salad.  I agree.. leave it overnight in the fridge.   The flavors blend well over time.  My hubby loves it!

Great edamame recipe! Everyone is right - half the dressing measurements. I preferred the simpler taste of no cranberries and no sunflower seeds.
