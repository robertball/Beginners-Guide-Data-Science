This is a fantastic recipe that doesn't require 8 hours in a slow cooker.
I eliminated the teaspoon of salt (there's already a lot of sodium in the beef broth and bouillon), but doubled the amount of oregano and pepper called for, in addition to adding 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes, as we tend to like our dishes just a little spicier.  I also added 3 chopped celery stalks and 8 oz of sliced mushrooms when it came time to add the vegetables.  Lastly, I  substituted 2 T. cornstarch in 1/3 cup hot water for the thickening agent instead of the all-purpose flour.  It turned out delicious and was even better the 2nd day!  This recipe is definitely added to my box!

I actually first saw this recipe in a Taste of Home magazine while standing in line at the store. I almost bought the $9.99 recipe book, but came on here to see if the recipe might be here and da..da! I will always double check recipes on here before buying magazines! The recipe is very good. I made one change though I added my flour to my meat before browning. I find that it is a tastier way of thicking up stew. If you add the flour at the end it has a raw flour taste in my opinion.

Ok!  This is by far! the best beef stew recipe in the world!  :)  I have made it 8 times now.  People just can not get enough of it.  Personally I use a little more stock and a little more beef and I have become partial to adding some celery but other than that this is perfect.  You can add corn, peas, etc if you wish but on it's own this is great!  We have gotten to the point where we use 3 cans of canned potatoes and 2 cans of baby carrots because it saves time.  This is by far my most favorite recipe found on the site!

This was a fantastic base recipe!  I swapped out a bunch though; I left out the Italian dressing, instead I browned the beef in a little oil after coating it with stew seasoning and flour.  Then I put it in the crock pot and I threw in one beef bullion cube and used the 'garlic and onion' flavored diced tomatoes and added the rest according to the recipe, although  I cut the onion and bell pepper down- 1/2 of each.  When it was time, I cut up the potatoes and tossed them in a Ziploc bag with some Italian seasoning, Everglades, Old Bay, black pepper and garlic powder, and used baby carrots instead of regular ones. 

I served it with hunks of fresh baked bread and everyone loved it- there wasn't a bit left!

Really Great Stew. Just what I was looking for.  I cut the recipe in half.. but left the canned broth, tomatoes and tomato sauce qty alone.  Also left out the green pprs and added canned corn and green beans instead.  Wonderful flavor. I will be keeping this recipe for future use.  Thanks! (I happened to have diced Fire roasted tomatoes on hand so that is what I used)

This was good, but not excellent.  I don't think I will do the flour/water mixture at the end if I make it again.

This turned out really well, did seem more like a very hearty soup tho than a stew. I actually made it up the day ahead of time to have ready for a dinner party and I got many compliments on it! I used a red pepper instead of the green since that's what I had on hand, added 3 stalks of celery and a small amount of corn and served it with corn bread.

This stew is very tasty!  I was a little put off by the aroma of the beef cooking in the dressing, but once it was all mixed together the flavor was delicious.

I liked this, but I wouldn't use the flour mixture in the end.  I loved it before I made the yeast mixture, and definitely would love it without it!

This IS one of the best Beef Stew recipes I have found! Although it is a tad bit away from the deep BEEFY flavor in beef stews I have tried, this explodes with flavor! I did change it a bit from reading past reviews. I added 2 crushed cloves of garlic, I took HALF the beef chunks and rolled them in flour & browned them a bit (simply because I did not want to be pulling flour dough balls out at the end, so I did NOT add the flour mixture at the end!) & then took the other HALF of the beef & browned it in the Italian dressing! It thickened wonderful & like I said the flavor was SPECTACULAR! Will make this again over & over!

Amazing stew recipe.  I actually add in a pound of peas, larger potatoes, and some corn (in my second batch).   Positively wonderful.  Great cold weather food, and I have plenty to share!  I love the green peppers in this recipe.  And I plan to add in some macaroni noodles as well.  I also have to add in some extra beef broth because my husband is not much on tomato anything...plus with my bigger potatoes and extra vegies I need a little more liquid.  I love the Italian Dressing as well!  I will continue to make this a lot!

Amazing!  First off, I did make some changes.  I omitted the Italian dressing and the flour step.  Instead I used 2 tbsp. of cornstarch at the end(smoothened in a bit of cold water).  I also doubled the oregano and added 1 tsp. each of marjoram, savory and red pepper flakes, in addition to 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary.  I like lots of veggies so I added sweet potatoe, corn and peas, and used red, yellow and orange peppers (1/3 each) instead of green.  Lastly, I used only 1/2 the tomatoe sauce that it called for and that was plenty! It was delish!  A perfect stew!

The italian dressing threw me off, but I like the tomato, onion, potato, carrot part. It needs a better base.

This was a fabulous stew! few things I changed, I added in a chili pepper finely chopped for some spice, as well as adding zucchini and celery to the medley and YUM it's good!! Also, I didn't need to use any flour as I read some of the complaints so I just let it simmer uncovered for about an hour and it thickened up just perfect.

This recipe is amazing! The only change I made was omitting the Italian salad dressing. I floured the stew meat and browned in a little olive oil. The family absolutely loved it!!

This stew is so yummy!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for except I used celery instead of green peppers and I added 1/2 cup of red wine...really great!  I think I'll try the green peppers next time though!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

Very flavorful stew. I used a slow cooker set on low for 10 hours.  For more intense flavor, I made some adjustments - in addition to oregano, I added 1 tsp italian seasoning, 3 bay leaves, and extra garlic.  Also added 1 beef bouillon cube, and 1 TBSP soy sauce.  It was a big hit - everyone asked for seconds!

This was an incredible recipe!! Only did a few things different that I saw from other reviews. I opted not to use the italian dressing...instead i coated the meat with a packet of stew mix. I too like mine a little spicy so I added crused red pepper. We dont care for green peppers so I left them out. I doubled the oregano as well. Best beef stew I have ever made. Thank you very much for sharing! I love when I find a delicious yet simple recipe to add to my rotation!

Good, heart-warming stew.  I tastes so much better after sitting in the fridge for a few days and being rewarmed.  It lets the flavors really soak into the meat and veggies.  It won second place in a stew competition.  So good stuff - not the best, but definitely makes a delicious dinner.

Good base recipe. I'm surprised it got RAVE reviews like "best stew ever".  It was a nice dinner & I would make again with some changes, but I would not say "I could not stop eating it" like others did. Give it a try with your own twist to it.

This has great flavor, don't let the Italian dressing scare you.   I also coated the beef in flour, salt & pepper before browning.   I added celery and omitted the green pepper.   I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 9 hours on low, adding the veggies midway through cooking time.   A great traditional beef stew with a secret ingredient that gives it a five star rating.

Good starter recipe. Took into account some of the reviews and made my own modifications -- and it was one of the best short-cook stews I've had.  Here's what I did:
* Took the first review and substituted the 2T cornstarch - though I added an additional 1/2T and a little more water.
* Added quartered fresh mushrooms (in the veggie time)
* Added fingerling potatoes instead of the "small quartered potatoes"
* Added 1 medium parsnip, trimmed and chopped into 1/2" cubes
* Rather than the canned tomatoes, I used Pomi Chopped Tomatoes - the full 26.46 oz box.
* Rather than the can of tomato sauce, I added 1/2 box of Pomi Strained Tomatoes.
* I added approx. 2 cups of an inexpensive Cabernet Sauv.
* 4 sprigs thyme (remove the stem, of course)
* 2 teaspoons or so of tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon or so of garlic paste
* Lastly, one whole serrano pepper - chopped small.

Because of the additional veggies, it took a little longer to cook them soft. Use your judgement - it took about an hour or 1.5 hours after adding the meat, but was really really good.

Made this last night and it was a huge hit.  I had tried many stew recipes and this one is by far the best.  Many times it's all in the sauce and this one makes a delicious gravy!  Even my kids liked it.  Made exactly as written.  Thanks Lynn!

I'm no chef at all. But you won't know by tasting this stew. It was a hit last night. I mean it was really really good. I think I'd put a little flower on the meat next time and maybe throw in a bag of mixed vegtables next time. Just for kicks. But try it this way the first time. You wont be disappointed at all. I think I'll go have a little more right now.

Thanks Lynn for a great recipe.  I cooked this in a slow cooker, pretty much followed the recipe and it was a hit.  Husband loved it and requested it be added to the regular meal planning.  Very tasty, the italian dressing add a wonderful flavor.  Will definately make again!

I liked this, but it was a little too spicey and too much tomato sauce. I was the only one in my family that liked it.  Will probably not make again, unless I try a different variation.

best stew by far! ... i browned the meat with the flour at the beginning (instead of waiting to add at the end). i also threw in some celery and a pinch of red pepper flakes. even without those personal family touches, the stew, i'm sure, would still be the best ever!

This is the best stew ever. I have been serving it for two or three years now and keep coming back to it! Everyone loves it. I make it exactly as written with the exception of the bell pepper (a personal preference).

I thought that this was very very good, better if it sat overnight to let the flavors blend a little more. It is really a soup though not a like a stew at all.

I made this last night and it was delicious! It is very simple to make and tastes incredible. The only changes I made were browning the beef in a little oil instead of Italian dressing, and then using about 3 T of cornstarch mixed with a 1/3 cup hot water as the thickening agent. The meat was tender, the sauce savory, and everyone loved it! I will definitely be making this dish again!

Followed the recipe somewhat close. Added frozen green beans & corn instead of green pepper and added cabbage the last 30 minutes or so.. Did not add the can of tomato sauce and did not add the flour&water mixture. I like some liquid in my stew for the rolls, next day it thickens up anyway.

I browned my salted/peppered and floured meat in a tad of oil, not Italian dressing.  Then I preceeded to following the recipe as written. Then instead of using green pepper, I used frozen green beans. I did not need to thicken the broth for mine came out semi thickend, gravy like! This beef stew is the best of the best!!  This recipe now replaces my old recipe handed down from my mom!  My pickey daughter  actually spooned the last drop from the pot! LOL

This stew is awesome, not to mention it makes your house smell amazing - it's SO worth the time needed to make!!!  I added just a little more water/broth, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  Goes great with a side salad and/or some garlic toast :-)

Great stew!  So simple to prepare.  I didn't have condensed beef broth so I added 2 extra bouillon cubes and extra salt.  Since I halved the recipe I just used a full can of diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce.  I also didn't have italian dressing but I did have an italian dressing packet so I sprinkled some on the beef while browning.  Left out the green pepper b/c we don't care for it.  Lastly used cornstarch/water mix to thicken at the end rather than flour.  My 2 girls ate almost a full helping which is amazing in itself!

Delicious. I couldn't find canned beef concentrate so I bought the new packets from Swanson and they worked great. I also used pork stew meat because I had some.

I floured the beef before browning them.  (Never heard of doing that in italian dressing before, good idea!)  I dumped everything in the crockpot at 10am, at 1pm I put potatoes in and at 2 before I left for work I did the flour.  My family loved it!  Even my picky son!

I skipped the Italian dressing, and the boyfriend wouldn't answer about wanting tomatoes in it, so I didn't add them.  Also, added the flour to the beef when I was browning it.  The boyfriend didn't understand my need to buy spices (he's a typical bachelor, until recently), but after this dish he understood how important all those things are.  He loved this and wants me to make it again....  Soon.

I LOVE all the vegetables used in this - the only thing I changed was the green pepper.  I substituted fresh green beans from my garden instead.  Oh, and since my daughter is gluten-free, I added 2 c. pumpkin puree instead of flour.  Wonderful!

really liked this. i skipped the salt and used low sodium beef broth. it has simple flavor that lets the veggies shine through. i added fresh green beans because i had some to use. it was a good idea to brown the meat in italian salad dressing. a keeper for me.

Was really very good.  My family likes it a little spicier  so I added some Worcestershire sauce, A1, goya (green), ground mustard and bell's seasoning.  I also tripled the broth ingredients and veggies added.  I tossed in some corn and green beans for extra variety.  We all really enjoyed it.  Thank you for sharing :)

This is a fantastic stew. The second time I used crushed garlic and instant potatoes to thicken instead of the flour. I also had some mushrooms and green beans that needed to be used. Wonderful on a cold day with fresh bread. I used the white batter bread which is also yummie.

Excellent! My husband says this is his favorite stew that I've made. The only change I made was adding a can of cream of mushroom.

This was a big hit.  Used celery instead of green pepper (personal preference) - will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious and super easy. I sprinkled the flour over the meat as it browned instead of mixing it with the water. I bought some crusty bread, topped the stew with parmesan and it was wonderful.

This stew was absolutely delicious. We all could not get enough, even the kids were begging for leftovers the next day. I ended up using balsamic vinaigrette dressing because that was all I had; I omitted the green pepper and ended up adding another cup of water and a few Tbsp of dressing. Don't add the water/flour mixture at the end. I ended up fishing out flour balls. I replaced with a water/cornstarch mixture -- the end result was wonderful. We added bisquick dumplings to top it off - YUM!

This was soooo good and even better the next day. The only thing I changed was that I used a 14.5 oz can of beef broth because that's what I had on hand and and I did not thicken it with flour at the end because it didn't need it.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!

This truly tastes great...I thought there was going to be too much tomato flavour, but there wasn't. Everything blended really well. I did leave out the Italian salad dressing though, instead I used dried Italian seasoning. Sooo good with fresh bread:)

I made a couple changes. I'm made several meals before where I made a flour mixture at the very end and they never turned out well. Besides I don't like a thick beef stew. So before I browned the meat I dredged it in a flour mixture along with some garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Then I used a little bit more Italian dressing than what was called for. I followed to rest of a 'T' but I added a touch more beef broth than what was called for, only about 4.5 oz as that is what size my beef broth came in and I figured the extra little bit couldn't hurt it! I let the simmer as said. When it came time for the vegetables to be added I left out the green pepper. I don't think green pepper is good for a beef stew. Instead I added canned corn and canned green beans. Then I added the normal potatoes, carrots, and onion. I let that simmer until finished.  My husband and I agree that it could go without the added salt. But this was by far the best beef stew I've ever had! I'll be making this time and time again! We have some deer meat to use though so I may try it with deer meat next time and see how that works with this! Great job on the recipe though!!!

The first time I made this it came out OK, just a little bland. 2nd time I made the following adjustments and it came out INCREDIBLE with lots of flavor. 
Omitted Italian dressing at beginning, and coat stew meat in flour and salt & pepper, brown them in a pan with olive oil. Added twice as much oregano, garlic and 1 tbls Italian seasoning. Before I added the vegetables, I took others advice and put the potatoes in a big ziplock with the Italian dressing, some Montreal steak seasoning, and more Italian seasoning. The result was a tender succulent stew with a fantastic flavor. Thankyou so much!!!!

I made this stew yesterday after I got off from work.  I normally make stew in a crock pot, this is a great recipe when you want it fast.  My husband and kids loved it.  My 2 yr old had seconds.  I followed recipe exactly except for the flour at the end.  Thank you so much for sharing, will definitely make this over and over ...

This is a delicious veggie beef stew. I have made this several times and just got done making it again. I follow the recipe as written. Except for this time, I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies (when adding the potatoes, carrots etc.) and a tad more Italian dressing. It really adds a wonderful flavor.

We just finished our 3rd helping!  This recipe was a hit!  Thank you Lynn. :)  I did do a couple things differently.  I used sauteed 1/4 of onion and 1 clove of garlic while the meat soaked up Worcestershire sauce and McCormicks Mesquite seasoning and a dash of sea salt.  (I dried the meat after I rinsed it.)   I followed the rest of the recipe the same.  Didn't have beef broth so I boiled up some beef bouillon cubes. (5 cubes to 5 cups of water).  Added a second clove of garlic, chopped,  1/4  onion cut into lg pieces.  Omitted bell peppers for celery w/ tops and can of sweet corn w/ potatoes and carrots. Used 2Tspoons w/ 1/3 cup of cold water..twice... for thickening.  Taste??  Amazing! :)

We love this recipe. I leave out the peppers & bay leaf because of my picky family. I've made this in my crockpot too. I cook on low 4-5 hours. I also do not use the flour at the end. In a pinch I have used beef bullion cubes instead of beef broth. When cooking in the crockpot make sure you cook the meat as directed before adding to crockpot. This is what gives it the best flavor!!!

Just made this tonight and it was absolutely wonderful!  I'm picky, picky, picky and I have only good things to say about this recipe.  The only change I made was to add some corn, peas and green beans because I like a little color in my stew, but other than that I followed all directions.  Excellent recipe.

Unfortunately, I'm one of those people who added stuff to the recipe so it's no longer the original recipe....I hate those people.  Anyway, I added everything the recipe said except for the boullion granules (too much MSG)and I didn't have any on hand.  So to make up for the flavor I added a bit of Worsteshire, garlic and onion powder and half and envelope of Lipton onion soup.  My husband loved it and wants me to make it again.  I think the onion soup helped make it less tomatoe and more beef like.
Overall its a good recipe that I will be making again with the adjustment I made the first time.

This was okay, but not as good as a  gravy-based beef stew. I added extra garlic and vegetables, as well as some additional seasoning, and it was still a bit too bland. The diced tomatos and tomato sauce together gave it a flat, tomato-ey taste that I think can be improved upon. I'm still up in the air as to whether I'll make again, or just stick with the tried-and-true.

Was very good, somewhat of a cross between soup and pasta sauce. A very good and hearty soup for someone who doesn't often enjoy it. I added corn, and took shortcuts by using canned cubed potatoes (first time I ever tried those) and baby carrots.

My husband and almost 2 year old grand daughter devoured it!   This is now in my fall/winter food line up!  The smell while it cooked was fantastic.  I LOVE the idea of browning the meat in the dressing, what a wonderful flavor this has! I hope to visit the B&B once you open it just for the meals!!!

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut back on the tomatoe sauce and diced tomatoes because I didn't want it to taste too Italian.  I only used about 3/4 of the can on the sauce and the diced tomatoes.  I didn't have any bouillon so I just used the beef broth and added some red wine.  I like the flavor of green bell pepper but don't like to eat it, so I cut into large chunks and then took out the pieces after the stew was ready.  I kept everything else the same in the recipe and it turned out very  nice. I am a pretty picky person when it comes to stews and soups so I was pleasantly surprised with this stew!  Will definitely make again.

This is an amazing base for a stew that can be changed any way you want. I personally added celery and peas. I would also recommend adding an extra cup of water maybe halfway through, at least I have to when adding extra vegetables. Anyway, this is great and everyone loves it.

Excellent stew!! I don't normally like a stew with alot of tomatoes but the beef broth really calms down the acidic flavor of the tomatoes and makes this a great dish. We did cut down the on cooking time by an hour, arriving at home at 5 doesn't really give you 2 hours to cook. So we simmered the first part for 30 mins, added the veggies cut small for another 45 and served. It was perfect!! The beef was tender, the veggies cooked without being mushy. This is definitely one of our keepers!!

OMG awesome and man-friendly. Such a good idea to cook beef in Italian dressing! I used 1/3 of meat and veggies, and left the rest intact.

This is a very good base recipe for beef stew. You can change it up to suit your taste. I used beef stock instead of bouillon and water and upped the garlic to two cloves. I swapped out the regular potatoes for sweet potatoes and the green pepper for an orange pepper just because that is what I had on hand. I used a whole large onion because I love the flavor it adds. And instead of browning the meat in Italian dressing, I used a balsamic vinaigrette. This stew has such a rich, deep flavor.  I added it to my recipe box and plan to make it again!

Needs additional water to top off the vegetables/potatoes. Nearly all of the water evaporates in the first hour and a half using the amount specified in the recipe.

This was by far one of the best beef stews I've ever had.  It turned out amazing and I will be making again.  Only changes I made were (1) I added the onions while I was browning the meat instead of later with the rest of the veggies (I like my onions to cook down to pratically nothing but flavor), and (2) I couldn't find a large can of condensed beef broth at my store.  I was only able to find little 1 ounce cups of condensed stock.  So I used 4 of those.  Which is a lot less than the recipie calls for but my stew still turned out amazing!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's one of my family favorites now :)

Delicious!!  I added about 1/4 to 1/2 c of red wine to the stew meat while simmering.

I love this recipe it is so delicious, I've cooked it a dozen times!  Bay Leaves is not something that I have in my spices, so I've never cooked it with it in it.  I just bought some and now I can't wait to try it with it!!!

Amazing!  Best stew I have ever had, looked at some reviews and made just a few changes, doubled oregano and pepper, added celery, and added 1 tsp red pepper flakes.  Best stew ever!

made this and loved it as did my husband and my kids. I made minor changes such as adding mushrooms and celery, no-salt beef broth instead of water and granules and ground (no-salt) tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce and omitted the salt  (I have a sodium reduced diet).  For making this with no salt products it was amazing and it had ton of flavour. I am making this again tomorrow for my in-laws!

Loved it.  My whole family of 4 did.  Kids are 10 and 7.  Served with corn bread.  Easy to make.  Will totally make it again.  Great as leftovers as well.

You can start this recipe right around the time the ole guy is sending out signals that he might be in the mood.  You get most of it made before he gets serious and makes the first move.  Then it can cook for a while and by the time you guys are finished, you have a wonderful , delicious meal.  Add a glass of rosé, a biscuit or french roll, and a view, and even if you're a senior, you've got a deal, baby.  It's a delicious, savory dinner.  And so very easy to make.  You can't mess it up.  Even if you've had a glass of wine.  Or two!

This recipe is full of flavor and is very easy to make. My husband always has complained that my beef stew does not have flavor but he absolutely loved this stew. Definitely a keeper.

Love this recipe. I have made it a few times with great results every time. It seems impossible to mess up! I also exchanged the diced tomatoes for stewed tomatoes. I also added squash and green beans this time. It's quick, easy and reliable Thanks for a good recipe.

I left out the green pepper but added corn in it's place.  I also neglected to add the flour & cold water at the end, but I don't think it hurt anything.  Still it was the best beef stew I've ever had.  Next time may add a bit of barley for a different texture.  Excellant!

Delicious!  This is definitely a keeper.  The recipe is wonderful as is, but because of my family's health requirements, I did not add the potatoes and instead added 1/2 c. frozen peas, 1 c. diced carrots, 1 c. chopped fresh green beans, and 1/2 large red pepper, diced.

Delicious, hearty, thick and absolutely perfect for a fall Sunday dinner.
Stew Meat was at an outrageous price so I bought some Sirloin Tip steaks that were on sale, cut them up and simmered until they were tender (just like the recipe said).  PERFECT.

This is the best stew I have ever tasted. My teenage son made it and it came out delicious! He omitted the Italian dressing, but for everything else, he followed the recipe. He said next time he may use celery instead of green pepper. I like the green pepper though!

Tonight was the first time that I made this dish, and it was really good. I substituted a glass cooking dish in the oven for the dutch oven. Cooked the meat and Italian dressing together at 455 Degrees for 15 Min, and put the 10 ingredients in a pot on the stove . once the meat was brown I transferred the meat into the pot on the stove.... it worked out great!

I usually don't like beef stews but since I had a venison steak in my freezer, I decided to make this stew.  It was very good.  I did add a zucchini and I used a red pepper since I don't like green peppers.  Oh, and I added 1/4 cup of barley.  It was delicious!

Like another reviewer I did not add the salt. The stew was plenty salty with out it. I also used a 1/4 cup of cornstarch to thicken with 1/4 cup water. I also added red, green and yellow peppers and  1/2 cup of chopped celery. Instead of putting the stew on the stove I put in the over at 300 degrees for 2.5 hours. It was delicious.

Awesome beef stew.  We added 3 cloves garlic, 2 tsp oregano, and two onions.  For the tomatoes and tomato sauce, we bought the large cans. So delicious, this is a keeper!

Great stew. I followed the advice of others and added two cans of beef broth, and I also added some celery, frozen corn and then about a half a can of peas at the very end. We thought the green pepper added some interesting flavor. I will definitely make this again!

This dish does have a great flavor and is quite hearty.  My Defensive End son and his team mates had no problem devouring it!  Like most reviewers, I left out the bell peppers and added frozen green beans and corn.  The only real change I made was that I sauteed the meat with onion and celery in just a TB of the dressing. I like the flavor browned beef brings to a dish like this.  I did add the rest of the dressing to the stew with the liquid ingredients. Again, like several reviewers, I decided at the end not to thicken the broth.  I was disappointed that the veggies had little flavor, so  I let the leftovers cook another 2 hours. What a difference! Now we are talking stew!  Nice and thick with a very rich, hearty flavor throughout.  Next time, I'll add the veggies with the liquid ingredients and let them simmer together for 2 to 3 hours.  Incredible!  This will definitely be added to our list of favorite meals.   Would love to stay with you at your B&B ... just for the food!!

Very tastey. I tried it in a crock pot but I didn't have enough time for it to cook. I dumped it into a Dutch Oven to finish it up. It has great flavor and the meat just fell apart. My first time making it and I followed the directions and juse added some celery as the other reviews said.

This was very, very tasty. I didn't use the beef bouillon granuals but 2 cans of beef broth instead. Replaced the green peppers with green beans and added an extra pound of beef that I dredged in flour, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder and browned 1/2 in the dressing, 1/2 in olive oil, therefore there was no need for the flour/water at the end as someone had mentioned would make it taste raw, and I thought so too.  Served it with warm bread and everyone LOVED it! Seemed to take a bit to prep but well worth it.  Thanks!!

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it 4 times now. It's something the whole family will eat including my 2 and 4 year old who are super picky.  I am allergic to carrots so I use 2 heads of broccoli instead.That's the only change I have made. Also if you have food issue like I do (allergic to soy which is in everything it seems) there's a great dressing I use for this recipe: Annie's Naturals Tuscany Italian.

Delish!  Instead of Italian Dressing I seasoned the flour and browned the meat in a little oil.  I added onions to the drippings and de-glazed the pan with red wine and followed the rest of the recipe. I omitted green pepper and served with egg noodles. Even my ultra-picky eater loved it.  Thanks!

This was a wonderful beef stew. It was a great hearty meal to sit and watch football on a cold sunday. Will definately make this again. Will probably add some peas.

Very, very good.  Nice meal on a cold day.  Hubby doesn't like bell pepper so replaced with celery.  I did find recipe only serves 8 if using for main meal.  Certainly will make again and again.

I had 2.5 pounds of beef stew meat that I bought on sale and desperately needed a recipe so I came here to look around.  I loved the reviews for this recipe so I decided to try it and it was BY FAR the absolute best beef stew I've ever had!  Everyone loved it and it is now a permanent recipe in my collection.  I had only 2.5 pounds instead of 3 pounds of beef, but it was totally fine.  THANK YOU!

very tasty, great flavour, easy to make.
made a few changes, switched the tomatoe sauce for soup. and did less potatoes and carrots, then added celery, corn and mushrooms. deleted peppers, don't like them. kept the onion and can of tomatoes the same. Make sure you disolve the flour in COLD WATER before adding to the stew, or you'll end up with little balls of douge

Has to be the best stew recipe I've ever had. The meet is really tender considering the recipe only takes around 3 hours total time. Plus it's very flavorful. If somebody has a better recipe, point me to it!

Excellent recipe, and I do not like to cook!  Fairly easy to prepare.  I also add lots more garlic than the recipe requires; I add about 1/2 cup of red wine; I add about 2 celery stalks chopped; and, I add corn per my husband's request.  I have made this stew for my parents, and they loved it too!  Salud!

With the bay, rosemary, oregano, diced tomatoes, and tomato sauce-it tasted like spaghetti instead of a savory beef broth.

Best stew recipe out there. I added the flour to the meat when browning instead of at the end. Everything else I did the same. I have made this twice in two weeks!

I have made this several times. The first time I made it almost as directed. The second time instead of condensed beef broth, I used the equivelant of water and Better Than Bouillon brand Beef Base (wet bouillon that comes in a jar). The stew is excellent and freezes well. I just made another batch last weekend and used chicken and Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base. I have never made a chicken stew before and it was also a keeper as far as recipes go. This is a great recipe to modify based on what you might have on hand in the fridge. You can even substitute some wine for a portion of the water for added flavor.

I made this with boneless chicken and chicken broth and bouillon. I added fresh string beans to the recipe and a touch of crushed red pepper.  I browned the chicken in the frying pan, but then made the dish in the slow cooker. Absolutely delicious!

I can only give four stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I think the tomato woulkd be a bit too overpowering if done as written.  I cut down on the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and added red wine instead.  I added lots of other veggies too.  Instead of using flour, I thickened it up at the end with a corn starch slurry.  Also, mine needed to be cooked longer after adding the veggies.  The carrots didn't soften enough in the time alotted

This is a WONDERFUL Beef Stew!  I followed the recipe with only a slight change-- I added 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar with the rest of the liquids at the begining and then, at the end, I thickened the stew with 1 tablespoon corn starch (mixed with warm water) instead of the flour.  I will be making this again!

I just used this recipe for the first time. I didn`t have all the ingredients handy so I grabbed a bag of frozen veggies (Thai mix) and used those. It was great cause it added broccoli, red pepper and spinach to the stew. Did have potatoes and onions so those went in as well. My husband and 4 boys loved it. It was first time making beef stew and it looks like I will be making it more often this winter.

This is an excellent recipe.  For some reason though there didn't seem to be enough liquid.  I may have had too many veggies in it.  I just added some more beef broth and water.  I also used chuck roast instead of stew meat and added corn and celery.  My husband and I loved it!

I thickened this stew with cornstarch instead of flour, for a gluten-free meal. And added a little red wine while simmering. Great hit for our dinner party! I served this with the Vegan Mexican Stew for our vegan guests. Both were a big hit. Salad and french bread completed the meal.

Made this for dinner last night....AMAZING!  I was really worried that the meat would be over-cooked, but it was tender and delicious.  I did reduce the cooking time, however.  Cooked meat for about 45 mins, added the veggies and did about another half hour.  Definitely making this again!

This recipe was really good. My boyfriend ate three really big bowls of it lol. The only thing different that i did was that i added a couple stalks of cut up celery, a tablespoon of parsley, and about a cup and a half of frozen corn. It tasted fantastic! Great recipe, definately will be fixing this again.

What an excellent recipe. The meat was so tender and this dish was full of flavor. I pritty much followed the recipe to a "t" except that I cut it in 1/2. I will be making this recipe frequently.

This was absolutely the best.  I followed the recipe  but coated the meat with flour at the onset.  I also added a can of green beans and split the amount of potatoes between Irish potatoes ands sweet potatoes.  I had to run an errand so I put the stew in the oven at 350.  This was definitely a  great way to cook this. Even with te flour at the beginning, it still needed to be thickened so I sprinkled  instant mash potato flakes over it and stirred it until it was the consistancy that I wanted.  I always use instant potatoes as a thickener when ever possible.

I used Rao's Italian Herb salad dressing and didn't use the condensed beef broth because I didn't have any on hand, but besides that, followed the recipe. Well, not really. I used green beans instead of green peppers and coated the beef in flour before browning. Anyway, at first the smell was a little weird and I thought, "opps..did I just ruin $12 worth of beef?" But after adding the rest of the ingredients, it began to smell really good. At the end it tasted good, but I still added a splash of good red wine to deepen the flavor.

This was sooooo yummy.  I made just a few changes I used tomatoe paste instead of sauce because it was all i had and used Mrs Dash garlic and herb seasoning and some xtra garlic.  Also i had the butcher cut up a chuck roast because i love how tender it gets and it was much cheaper to do it that way.  I will definitly make this again

This recipe is fantastic.  It takes absolutely no time at all and turns out amazing.  Like other reviewers I agree that it turns out more like a meal than a stew and I would not put the flour at the end since its already thick enough without it.  I substituted green beans instead of potatoes and didn't put in carrots, wanted to make it a little lighter.  Turned out great! Would recommend to anyone who wants a nice thick rick and steamy soup for winter.

I loved this recipe!!  I put the flour in a bag with the dry italian seasoning mix and then fried them. I added fresh green beans, carrots, zucchini, and used beef stock instead of water.  I also ommitted the pepper because I didn't have any.  We all loved it!

This was really very good! I used italian dry seasoning mix / blended w/ the flour instead of cooking it in italian dressing, and browned meat in olive oil. I really liked finding this recipe because only other way i made stews (being from south louisiana), was with a roux to start. This was much easier and just as delicious! Thanks... oh and i added a bit of cumin to the meat as well as worstershire sauce after it was browned, as well as a bit more salt and a teaspoon of dry cajun seasoning, 2 tablespoons parsley to the stew after adding the vegtables.

This was AMAZING stew!!  I made it for my family tonight and they all enjoyed it.  Even those who don't like stew said it was quite tasty.  The only thing I did different from the original recipe is substitute venison for the beef.  It was SOOOOO yummy!  I will diffidently be making this recipe again!

I tried this recipe tonight, on a whim for my family.  I had veggies to use from an organic co-op so I added celery too.  It was awesome, the meat was falling apart tender!  I don't get taste this good when I cook it all day!  Definitely adding to my favorite recipes.

I made this recipe exactly according to the directions. It was very good, however much too salty. Next time I will leave out the salt as it gets plenty of flavor from the beef stock and bouillon.

This is the best vegetable beef stew I have ever tasted. I add a few more vegetables, but it is loved by the whole family.

This is so good it's "sick"! I doubled the tomato sauce, omitted the beef broth & replaced it with 1-cup veg stock ("Better Than Bouillon" brand) and 1 cup red wine. I also let the meat/tomatoes simmer for 2-1/2 hrs before adding vegs. Added frozen corn & frozen peas 30 mins before serving. Strongly recommend mixing Cornstarch w/COLD water to thicken at the end. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious!

3.5 stars. I made this exactly as written and it is way too salty. 2 teaspoons of beef bouillon plus 1 can of condensed beef soup mixed with only 2 cups of water makes for a very salty and intense flavor stew. I added 2 more cups of water but it was still too salty. DH said it was good, but he request that I use less bouillon or no beef soup. Picky 6yo DS wouldn't touch it. I liked that this recipe has you stew the meat first and then stew the vegetables later which kept the vegetables colors. Still looking for the best beef stew recipe.

Thank you for this delicious winter stew. I used whole green beans instead of green pepper and a can of beef & veggie soup as the market had no beef broth, and the whole batch was gobbled up in double time. Will be keeping this one for sure.

I have to say it took three or four bites before I liked this stew.  I was expecting a beefier broth but once I was use to the tomatoe tasting broth I thought it was wonderful.  All three very young children loved it and did my husband - so will make again.  Thank you for sharing such a good recipe.

WOW!! DEFINITELY a keeper! This is no doubt the best beef stew I have ever tasted!  I will make this one again soon! If I had to pick one thing to complain about it would be that the smell of it cooking was so amazing it drove my husband and I crazy waiting to eat it!!

I've tried several different beef stew recipes and so far this one is the best.  I substituted sweet potatoes for white potatoes and used chicken broth and bullion instead of beef because I was out of beef stock.  It still came out wonderful.  My husband rarely eats leftovers yet with this stew he couldn't get enough.  I hope I stop by your bed and breakfast one day.  I'm sure the food will be excellent.

I'm with the others on this one for sure, it is just wonderful.  Couldn't believe the Italian dressing, but it really made the stew!  I later thought I could've added other ingredients, more veggies, etc., but why bother?  It doesn't really need it.  Thanks so much.

By far one of the best stews I've ever tasted and quite simple to make! Adding mushrooms enhances the meat flavor. I thicken the stew naturally without flour by blending some of the cooked potatoes and carrots with a small amount of broth. Delish! I won't ever use another recipe!

This is the only beef stew that I make. My change is for water and  beef bouillon granules and beef stock I use one quart of beef stock in the box and no flour to thicken. If I want it thicker I use a small amount of mashed potato flakes

Was amazing! My family absolutely loved it. Great for the cold nights and is still good warmed up the next day! Definitely make sure to use the Italian dressing when browning the meat, it holds in the moisture of the meat and basically melts in your mouth!

Gave 4 stars because I tweaked it according to my family's taste and what I had on hand. I did the following:

omitted the bell pepper, carrots and flour added corn on the cob cut into 4ths

substituted the can of broth &  granules for 1 packet of beef gravy mix and 1 beef cube (added at the beginning not at the end)

Added brown sugar and parmesan cheese to taste

Mmmm, turned out very savory.

I originally found this recipe on Taste of Home's website. I've made it three times since, following the directions exactly, and plan on making it again tomorrow. It's super yummy! Per my fiancee's request I'll be changing the Italian dressing to olive oil, using low sodium broth, and eliminating the flour step at the end.

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe (excluded the peppers) and my Husband and I loved it.   What a great idea to brown the beef in the dressing.  I've only used it with chicken.  This opens up all kinds of possibilities!

We didn't have bell peppers so I left that out. Added Celery instead. I thought it turned out delightful and took it to a big get together and everyone was raving about it! Great recipe perfect for fall weather!

This recipe is AMAZING. I ended up leaving out the flour and water mixture in the end because it didn't need it. I felt it was thick enough. Also I didn't add the extra salt. And I didn't really use the exact time frame they had. I added each ingredient in the order that's on the list but in the end, I cooked it all together for about and hour. DELICIOUS!!!

I personally would probably give this recipe 4 stars, but everyone else who ate it rated it a 5! It was a really great recipe, I just feel that it needed a little more spice or flavor, but I will definitely be making it again. My husband LOVED it! He said we should put it on a biweekly rotation! The meat was so tender and falling apart by the end of the cook time, Yum! I also added some frozen corn and green beans as I love my veggies!

The Italian salad dressing is what adds so much flavor to this soup/stew.  Great overall basic stew that you can customize easily.  My menfolk loved this as is and the only thing I did differently was to  use red bell pepper as I had it on hand. Another reviewer did this or I might not have thought of it.  It was fine and probably sweeter than the green and more appealing to my fussy men.  If I had to make this just for me, I would add green beans, lima beans, broccoli,  peas or corn to this and it would be great.  I used a good stew meat and it came out tender.  I hate tough stew meat.  We just now ate it and I couldn't wait to add my 2 cents to this easy to make, tasty beef stew.  Good job!!

I made this stew after I made horrible batch of tasteless yuk.  This stew is great!  Lots of flavor.  Only drawback was the time factor.  My mother-in-law makes great beef stew, so I was nervous for my husband's reaction (especially after the tasteless yuk..) but he LOVED it!  Only thing I changed was to add green beans instead of bell pepper.

This stew recipe was exactly what I was hoping to find! Only change was celery in place of green pepper.. oh, and I tossed in a can of green beans. Cut back a bit on the flour mixture and it was a huge hit! Will certainly be making many times this winter. Thanks for posting.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I made it thinking it would last several days for my husband and me.  We ended up eating it for dinner and work lunch & dinner the next day!    We tend to like like more liquid, so I doubled the beef broth (low sodium version).  I also dredged the meat in flour prior to browning, so the stew was a little more brown in color than the picture.  I'm sure we'll eating a lot of stew this upcoming winter!

Great recipe! I added green beans and turnips. I even used a Pike's Peak roast which is a tougher cut, and it was perfectly tender. We will definitely make again.

I am by no means "a cook" lol, I made this stew, though I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of Campbell's Tomato soup with basil & oregano, OMG everyone went crazy!!!! they loved it, of course not believing I made it lol.  I made it again a second time, again with the same results, it is amazing & easy.  Love it!!!! (one other thing, I floured the meat in a bag first then fried it.

I used this recipe as a base and made it with what I had on hand.  I thought it turned out yummy...still needs a little bit of tweaking, though.

I thought this turned out real good.  I used about 1/2 cup of italian dressing, only 1 cup of water, 1 cup of Italian beer.  I did not use beef bouillon.  The canned tomatoes included green pepper, clerey, onion.  I also passed on the tomato sauce.  I used double strength campbell's beef broth.  I skipped the bay leaf and dashed with cayenne instead.  I also passed on the onion.  This dish was a hit with my husband!

This is truly the best vegetable beef stew I have ever had (let alone made), thanks for sharing this great dish! I did vary slightly by putting in two cans of Veg-All mixed vegetables near the end of the cooking.

This is an awesome recipe. The beef come out so tender this is now my favorite stew recipe.  The only things I did different was omitted the water and used 3 10.5 oz cans of beef broth. I used Wondra instead of the flour to thicken.

Most amazing stew ever! 
It's just as amazing heated up the next day, as it doesn't get the 'cold clumpy gravy' type texture after being in the fridge.
Thank-you!!!

Great aroma!  My teenage sons love it as is, but my husband and I needed a little extra kick.  So I added a chipoltle chile to our servings, and for us it was just what the doctor ordered!

Thanks so much for this recipe, it really was delicious!!! So easy to do and made the house smell great. I did alter it a little bit, eliminating the green pepper and substituting some turnop and peas right before it was done. Also let it cook a little longer than recommended and turned out perfect. A keeper for sure!

Great recipe!  I added green beans and corn in place of the peppers and it worked perfectly.
