We didn't care for this casserole, it was very bland.  I really think the 1/2 cup of flour really took away from the dish, it seemed to nutralize the taste of the cheese.

This is a very good recipe...The only changes we made was to use evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and we added Panko bread crumbs mixed with grated paremesean cheese and a little paprika for color on top before baking..Also, make sure the flour is fully cooked - a couple of minutes before adding in the cheese.

Okay all....this recipe is a good idea but WAY to bland for my taste!! I would make the following changes
1. MORE CHEESE!! You can barely taste any cheese
2. NO THYME...or a lot less of it.  It's so strong...to me it tasted like macaroni and thyme! (I don't like thyme so I would leave it out.)
3. MORE BEEF!  You can't taste this either.
4. GARLIC!  This would add a great flavour to this dish.
5. LESS FLOUR...it wasn't saucy at all..just too thick.

All in all the idea is good it just needs to be worked on a little bit!

I liked this.  My husband liked this.  My mother-in-law liked this.  My 3 1/2 year did NOT like this. Go figure.  Maybe it was the Worchester.  My only caution is that you must use sharp cheddar - it was fairly mild-flavored using aged baby Tillamook, which surprised me.  Might try extra sharp next time.  Would definitely be too bland with anything milder than sharp.

I thought this was a tasty twist on macaroni and cheese.  I added more cheese on top and sprinkled bread crumbs over them for some crunch.  Will make again.

We really liked this recipe.  We did add an extra 1/2 cup of cheese and extended the cooking time to 40 minutes.

This recipe was pretty good. It did need a little extra kick. Definately cut the flour in half and cover the dish while in the oven.

I was in kind of a hurry tonight and did not read the reviews before I made this recipe - let's just say I learned my lesson! This recipe calls for too much flour, so I added a lot more milk to make more of a sauce. Next time, I'll add more cheese and the addition of garlic is a great idea. I'll probably also leave out the tomatoes, I just don't think they add much to the dish. It turned out really good, though. My 2-year-old loved it!

good tasting recipe, but I think way too much flour. I used 1/4 C and it still thicken up too much. Used cooked ham instead of beef, used 1/4C wine, dried thyme.  tasted like cheese fondue with pasta.  GOOD

We thought this was very bland. Not sure but maybe the flour soaked up the flavor. I followed this to the tee, this isn't a keeper and won't be making this again.  We tossed it out and went out for dinner!!!!

It is good. We like it. I suggest to cover the casserole while baking, so the top does not become crispy.

Thanks for sharing this recipe :-)

Really good recipe.  I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and cut the flour in half.  I did not have white wine and used some red - really good flavor to it.  Also, I used soy sauce instead of worcestire (again what was on hand).  I did add some garlic.  My whole family (including the picky 2 year old) loved it . . . sure to be a repeat in our family!

My family all liked this (incl. 1 picky eater!).  I did double the beef & added an extra splash of milk.  After reading other reviews, I'll probably halve the flour next time.  Will make again - thanks!

I just made this and it was awesome. I did change a few things because I go with feeling rather than just amounts. I browned the onions with mashed garlic and the beef. Added whipping cream and a little milk to make it saucy. Added paprika and a lot more worshester sauce and about half the flour. I also used a can of diced tomatoes including the juices. All the kids had seconds. We had a green salad on the side. Thanks for the idea.

I really liked this recipe.  It was very flavorful and hearty... makes great leftovers too.  I made very few changes to the original recipe (unusual for me)... I just reduced the amount of cheese by 1/2 a cup.  Next time I will double the amount of fresh thyme.  Really good though!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Loved the tangy taste from the mustard and wine! I followed the advice and used evaporated milk and an extra sharp cheese. I ended up sort of messing up the recipe and making double the sauce, but I don't think that we would have like it as much with the normal amount of cheese sauce, as we felt it was slightly dry, even after "doubling" the sauce and using the correct amount of noodles. Will try this again, this will be fun to play with!

This was a good cold weather/kid frendly casserole. I added a diced green pepper to the onion and used half velveta and half sharp chedder. Next time I will use corn starch as a thickner as I still tasted the texture of the flour even after I cooked it out. I sprinkled the top with some parmesan cheese and paprika for color.

A good weekday meal and great if you want pasta bake but have no tinned tomatoes or tomato paste. Didn't think this recipe would work - but my kids cleaned up their plates!

This was really easy to make and makes quite a bit. If you do not care for the taste of thyme, I would cut the amount it half. The thyme was very prodominate. We loved it and can't wait to have it again.

Based on other reviewers, I made the following changes:  doubled the beef & cheese, 1/2 the thyme and flour, added 1-2 cloves of finely chopped garlic.  With those changes it came out very tasty.  Thanks!

This wasn't as bad as I expected based on earlier reviews.  From the reviews I cut the flour in half and used extra sharp cheddar cheese to add more flavor.  I also added crushed red pepper flakes to my portion, as my family doesn't like too much spice.  The only thing that was missing was garlic.  The next time I make it I think I will also add some crushed Ritz crackers or cubed toasted italian bread to give it some texture.

I agree that this recipe is  on the bland side.  It could use more meat and a bit of spice, the thyme is a bit too strong for the cheddar flavor in general, but it is a good start.

We both enjoyed this a lot but had to only give it three stars as you definitely need to halve the flour and add some extra seasonings. I will make this again with these two changes.

Needed to use up some hamburg and thyme. This was easy and tasted great. I followed the advice of other reviews (1/4 flour and 1lb of meat) and was satisfied with the results. Thanks for sharing!

It was really good and simple to make, but it required just a little more herbs and spices.

This is ok. There is a lot of macaroni though. I used a full pound of beef and there was still to much. I will half the macaroni next time. I used hot sauce and dijon because it is what I had on hand. It needs more flavor though. I may add some garlic powder next time and more hot sauce.

This is an OK recipe - one for the occasions when you want to do something different with minced beef.  I agree the flavour was a bit bland, I think it needed garlic.  I served it with garlic bread which was the additional flavour and helped mop up the cheesy sauce.  Will definitely make again.  A good freezer standby.

This was very good!  I was a little timid of the flour after reading the other reviews...so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and milk.  It turned out great! Also, I had fresh basil instead of fresh thyme on hand, so I used the dried thyme and added fresh basil. I didn't have cherry tomoato, so I diced up some ripe regular tomato.  I added extra mustard, I used red wine instead of white (all ready had that open!) and also sauteeed all vegetables seperately:  garlic, onion, portobello mushroom, yellow bell pepper, celery.
Lastly, I was running out of time, I did this all in a dutch oven on the stove and it was great that way.  I never needed to bake it in the oven.  I will make this again!

My family always enjoys this...but with some changes added.  I upped the amount of beef to a pound.  I added garlic to the beef mixture while browning it.  A LOT more Worcestershire sauce and mustard.  The mustard is the white wine mustard.  Doubled the pepper and thyme...well more like tripled.  Lots more cheese and a mix of sharp cheddar and colby jack. The flour mixture is always fine with me.  We have made it both with and without tomatoes...the tomatoes give the casserole just a little bit more.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars based on the fact that the quantity of flour is wrong.  I was in a hurry and made the mistake of not reading the reviews first as well.  I realized my mistake before adding all the flour but it still ruined the dish for me.  My husband liked it.

It was rather bland, so the second time I fixed it I used our usual whole wheat pasta and a cheese blend that had sun-dried tomoatoes, basil and added roasted garlic. A nice, grown up macaroni dish.

Very good.  Like others have said, use half the flour suggested and extra sharpcheddar cheese.  You can also omit the tomatoes if you want.

Don't know what I did wrong but this just did not do anything for me. The sauce wasn't very creamy. Cheesy Yes creamy no. Could be that we are used to Velveta.

The flour was way to much, cut it down to 1/4 cup and That was even to much.  Cut the macaroni down to 1 1/2 cups cooked.  My husband and my daughter ate it because he felt bad for me.  My granddaughter could not eat it and we fixed her a sandwich.  I couldn't eat it.  I will through this recipe away as soon as I finish submitting this.

After reading the reviews, I used 1 can evaporated milk, about 1/4 cup flour, 1 can diced tomatoes, thyme & basil along with two splashes of sirracha.  I also used yellow mustard since that is what I have on hand.  Probably could have gone with one splash of sirracha as my husband and daughter thought it was a little too spicy.  I covered it for most of the oven time. And uncovered it for the last seven or so minutes.

Like some of the other people I wish I would have read the reviews first. I added at least another 1/2 cup of milk. The casserole was still very dry. I would not make this again, not following the recipe this way.

Was a hit with my husband and 12 year old daughter.  I added minced garlic with the onions, and cut down on the flour, and added extra milk.  My husband added salt, but I thought it was fine without extra salt, although I added additional salt while cooking.

My boyfriend and I thought it was pretty good. We stuck to the recipe except we added canned diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. I thought it was a little bland, but we added sour cream and picante sauce and it hit the spot.

The three star rating was really my own doing.  I think I would try this again because I do like beef and noodles together.  When I was mixing it together it did seem dry so I panicked and used cream of mushroom soup and that just made it taste like nothing but cream of mushroom soup. :(  

I think I would substitute the cherry tomatoes for sundried tomatoes and see how that goes.

Could be a good recipe but my tinkering made it hard to tell.

Really didn't like this casserole. Too dry. I would add a cream soup to it if I made it again.
