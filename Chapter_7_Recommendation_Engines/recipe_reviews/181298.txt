This was very unusual and very tasty.  I only used 2 chopped shiso leaves and 1/2 tea. wasabi paste.  I actually like it better with lemon juice (1/2 lemon squeezed).  Also, try first with 1 jalapeno, add more if desired.  For those that don't know what a shiso leaf is... It's a Japanese mint leaf.  Each leaf is about 3" big.  They usually come like 8 leaves per carton.  They are usually found in the produce section of a Japanese store.

Loved this! I couldn't find shiso leaves at my regular grocery store, so I did a little online research and subbed a bit of basil and mint for it. I used a little soy instead of salt and green onion isnstead of regular. The wasabi and ginger are great. We had this with fried wonton wrappers  - fun combination. Next time I'll go to the swank gocery for the shiso leaves - I'm curious about them now. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an interesting twist on guacamole. I was serving a thai themed meal so I decided to try it. I couldn't find Sisho leaves anywhere so I had to leave them out and substitute some thai basil. I recommend cutting the wasabi in half to start. The flavor was a bit overwhelming, you can always add more if you need it.

A great twist on guac!  I served mine with asian rice crackers.  I subbed basil and mint leaves for the shiso, per the other reviewers.  Great recipe!

Loved this!!! But 2 whole jalapeno peppers were even a bit much for a spice lover like me.  Could not find shiso leaves so I used mint leaves.  This was delicious.  Had with multi-grain pita chips as appetizer to sushi night!

Awesome recipe! Added roasted white and black sesame seeds along with chopped cilantro. This was served with BBQ Korean beef short ribs and yard picked mint leaves.
