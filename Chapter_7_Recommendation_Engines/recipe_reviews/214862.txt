This was a good recipe, but admittedly I did tweak it a bit. I think the problem was that no seasoning was suggested. Even then, it would have been good I'm sure. I cooked the sausage with onions and garlic, which I just about always add onions and garlic to everything anyway. Also I covered it and baked it 40 minutes, then uncovered and baked it an additional 15 minutes. It came out fine and not soggy. I didn't have Mexican cheese, so I used what I had which was sharp cheddar. It was really good. I think the next time I'll add some mustard to it as well. Thanks for sharing!

After making a few changes my husband and I found this recipe quite delicious. First, I pre-baked the biscuits for 15 minutes. After baking, I cut them in half and lined the bottom of the pan. After cooking the sausage (I used maple flavor) I added a small white onion and green pepper (both chopped small) to the skillet. I let them cook together for a few minutes before adding the hashbrowns. I also added a few seasonings such as Simply Organic All-Purpose Seasoning, Spike, ceyenne pepper, and black pepper. I did add a few extra eggs and baked at 375. It turned out great!

Great reviews from the office! Used hashbrowns with onion and peppers and I also increased the milk to 1/2 cup to cover the cheese. Served with salsa. I will say that step 4 says to bake for 25 mins which is incorrect. 40 minutes is sufficient.

I have this in the oven now. I added onion the the sausage and I also added a can of mushroom soup to the eggs as well as green peppers and a can of sliced mushrooms. I also used sharp chedder and I accidently put it on top of the eggs, but I am sure it will turn out great!

My husband and I were looking for something a little different to make for dinner one night and I came across this recipe.  Although it did not receive rave reviews, we tried it anyway.  We used bacon rather than sausage and added dried mustard and Tony's seasoning in the egg mixture.  We baked it for about 30 minutes and it really turned out pretty good!  We have 3 kids and they all cleaned their plates.  I might add an egg next time as it was a tad bit dry.

I have served this casserole twice.  The second time I used the hash browns with peppers and onions, and I added salt and pepper to the egg mixture before pouring it over the top.  We liked it the first time, but the second time was better!

Delicious! Used diced sandwich ham and added a bit of hot sauce between the hash brown and cheese layer.  Very easy!  Cooked it in a small casserole dish.  Used i cup hash browns, 5 eggs and crescent rolls.  Cooked for 28 minutes middle rack and then moved up to top rack for 5 minutes to brown the cheese.  It set up perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I added more seasoning and found it needed even more.. I used crescent rolls and prebaked so I didn't have the soggy problem, I used homemade chorizo in this. It did need more eggs. I think the dish has too many potatoes or needed even more eggs.. it was very dense.  Also needed a vegetable or more meat.. something..

Wanted breakfast for dinner, so tried this. Used bacon instead of sausage. Added dehydrated onions, granulated garlic and pepper to the eggs, and used medium cheddar cheese in place of mexi cheese. Cooked for 35 mins. Tasty recipe.

I absolutely loved this!!  I got mixed reviews from my family though.  My son said it looked gross but liked it when he ate it and my daughter ate it and didnt like it.  My husband said it was pretty good.

We found it a little bland. I made only half the recipe and it was too much for two people, heated up nicely next morning. Next time I would add peppers and onions and a little more spice other than just the salt and pepper I added.

This was easy to make and also easy to add additional ingredients.  I added onion and sautéed just prior to browning the sausage.  You could do the same with peppers if desired.  I also added 2 additional eggs and cooked 8 minutes longer.  Lastly, I topped it all off with additional cheese.

We make this recipe almost every month. I’ve even taken it to several new moms or potlucks. The only changes I like to make is 1. Use croissant dough or the pilsbury crescent sheet. 2. Lots of salt and pepper. 3. I use 6-7 eggs. 4. I use plain yogurt instead of milk.

I didn't make any changes this go around.  I think I'll bump the potatoes down by a cup, the eggs up by two or three and possibly serve country gravy with it.  All in all really pretty good!

This came out pretty great. My tweaks: I used shredded pepper jack & cheddar cheeses. Mmm delish! I sautéed the onions and green peppers in a little butter and drizzled sriracha sauce over that before adding them on top of the potatoes & sausage. We love spicy seasonings! Also, I love spinach in my eggs and my hunny likes jalapeños, so I put spinach on one side and jalapeños on the other before I poured the eggs & milk on top. Came out great and the biscuits were not soggy. Though the biscuits had a sweet taste going on, not sure why, but it didn't ruin the meal. I used Pillsbury Grands.

I have made this a few times now, and I generally double the recipe (except I use one package of sausage and one package of bacon) and divide it among three 8x8 disposable aluminum pans so I can take them to gatherings and not worry about my dish being returned. Also, that gives me the chance to make different varieties: I usually make one with sausage, one with bacon, and then a "supreme" casserole with bacon, sausage, diced ham, and red & green bell peppers. They are all great!

I added powdered mustard, salt, pepper and minced onions. Next time I'll add jalapeño and green pepper.  Definitely will add to my favorites. Hubs gives it a gold star :)

I made this for father's day and it was delicious.  I made a few changes to the original recipe. I did not cook he hash browns in the sausage fat, instead I fried them separately in olive oil with onions and mushrooms. Also I cooked it at 375 for 30 minutes and it wad cooked perfectly.
