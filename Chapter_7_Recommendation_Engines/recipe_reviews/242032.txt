This is such a great recipe! I added beans to the meat mixture, and instead of boiling the zukes first, I baked them raw and they were perfect! This is wonderful for summer -- we ate them on the front porch in the early evening!

This was a great recipe! However, I think it called for too much red pepper and onion. I only used one pepper and about a third of an onion, and the meat-to-pepper/onion/Ro-tel ratio was perfect! I also used ground beef instead of turkey and it turned out marvelously. 
What a delicious recipe! I will definitely make it again. I cut out the cilantro since my family doesn't care for it.

I substituted fat free Greek yogurt for sour cream. I also used lean turkey meat that was seasoned already. So good, even the husband and kids ate it

This was an excellent recipe, and fairly healthy as well. A few changes were made, most notably the sour cream sauce as the Old El Paso Zesty Sour Cream seasoning seems to have been discontinued. 

1. First, I cut back on the red pepper. I used probably half to 3/4 of a red pepper. Two whole peppers just seemed like too much for a pound of turkey.
2. I used Rotel Chipotle flavored tomatoes and green chilies, instead of regular Rotel. This added a lot of distinct flavor. If you don't like spice or a smoky flavor maybe stick with regular Rotel. But I thought this was a great use in the recipe.
3. I used a simple Mexican blend of cheese as it was what I had on hand.
4. Since the sour cream seasoning seems to be discontinued I located it's ingredients and added the following to taste:
 Sugar, Salt, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Dried Chipotle Pepper, Smoked Paprika, and Hot Sauce.

I started with about a tsp of everything and added more to taste. I thought this turned out very well. I then served with a homemade Spanish rice recipe from this site. Will definitely make again!

This was so good!! I used grass-fed beef instead of turkey and I seasoned my own sour cream. My hubs told me I had to make the sour cream again. My 13 year old told me dinner was SO good. Yay!

I did some changes. I put a layer of refried beans on the bottom of the cooked zucchini. Black beans mixed in and Topped it with Sour Cream and Salsa  after it was cooked. Everyone loved it.

added a package of ranch mix to sour cream. No taco seasoning either added my own spices to make taco flavor.

Cooked the zucchini in the oven for about 20 min before stuffing it. Made it without the sour cream.  Very tasteful and will make again.

I'm making it right now but used chorizo and potatoes since that's what I had instead of turkey. A little more fatty but I'm hopeful! I also used mozzarella and asadero cheese for a different flavor. :)
