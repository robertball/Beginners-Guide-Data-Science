The garlic, dill and Salmon made this one a hit with me. I used whole milk instead of cream.
Wonderful recipe.

This was a real time taker - to reduce the whipping cream and the wine sauce to 1/2 it's original amount.  I would do a regular white sauce and add the salmon to it.  It turned out delicious, but a regular white sauce takes no time at all and is just as good if not better.

Too time consuming and unhealthy for the outcome.
