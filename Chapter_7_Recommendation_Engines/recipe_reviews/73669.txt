While this recipe is good, The Old St. Louis South Side way is to partially grill the porksteaks then transfer to a beer and bbq sauce. Simmer till the meat comes off the bone. Porksteaks can be tought otherwise Our family has prepared porksteaks this way for 3 generations.

This is hardly authentic St. Louis BBQ.  Carolina BBQ uses vinegar--never St. Louis.  St. Louis would use beer over vinegar. It may be good, but it nees to be renamed.

I tried this the frist day I read it. It turned out good, but I did make a few changes. First, I didn't use nearly as much basting liquid as stated, only about a cup. I addition to the salt & pepper, I used a little onion and garlic powder. Also, I added a few drops of liquid smoke to the liquid, perfect! It was very moist from the low heat, and very flavorful. This recipe gave a good start to what can be a very delicious dish.

From St. Louis and I agree beer must be used. Suggestion: I grill only long enough for flavor,get cooking started and to seer the meat. Then remove steaks and submerge in bbq sauce in a pirex dish, place in oven at low temp and let them cook out very slowly, several hours. Bbq sauce will cook in and the meat will fall apart.

I'm also from St. Louis and love these!The vinegar thing is the key. We boil ours in vinegar first and they get so tender and juicy, then we throw them on the grill to finish them off. AWESOME! Lived in NC for several years and St. Louis BBQ is the real deal. That NC stuff is just shredded meat in vinegar. They don't even grill it! It's not BBQ, it's blasphemy!

O, wow... this was amazing. I did tweak the seasonings a bit, adding liquid smoke, garlic and onion powders. Only had 2 steaks, made about 1 cup marinade, basted every couple of minutes... PERFECT.

This marinade/basting liquid also works famously on chicken. Suspect the only thing it ISN'T good on is ice cream, but at 33 weeks pregnant, even I'm known to experiment!

Thanks for such a good recipe.

Oh my YUM.  I am from St. Louis and I have missed these pork steaks.  I lost my recipe for these a while back...and thank goodness someone else posted this.  You don't really need all that basting liquid unless your family likes to slather it on after it has been cooked.  Thanks for the post.  Delicious.

As a St Louisan who makes porksteaks in a totally different way, I thouht I'd try these and they were great!  Didn't quite need all the basting sauce, but I used quite a bit, as I basted numerous times in the first 15 minutes of cooking.  Thanks for a new variety of what we already love!

I marinated these for 24 hours and then, as others mentioned, I slightly grilled them and then put them in the crock-pot for about 2 hours. I don't know how St. Louis grilled steaks are supposed to taste, but these were really good.

Good enough BBQ but definitely not St. Louis.  St. Louis does not do the vinegar thing.  St. Louis BBQ is sweet, spicy with a little bit of kick and endless quantities of BBQ sauce.  Think MAULLS.

Oh, I was really hoping this was going to be a good receipe. I followed the direction as stated and all we could taste was vinegar.  Tried saving it with BBQ sauce without any luck.  Unless you love vinegar-flavored meat, pass on this recipe!

A neat change from the usual BBQ chops.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke, as recommended by another reviewer, and about 1/4 cup of scallions (green onions)for a bit of extra flavor.  I soaked the chops for about two hours in the marinade. If you like vinegar you will like these.

Loved it, loved it, loved it. Perfect on a winter night when you don't want something so heavy it will stuff you, and you are watching your calories. Grilled on my daughter's George Foreman grill, served with a side of pan-fried potatoes, and garlic-buttered greenbeans. PS--the apple cider vinegar gives that BBQ-like sensation. Use a good season salt and a quality vinegar to get the perfect blend.

I have lived in the St. Louis area my entire life. This recipe is very authentic. For those of you who keep talking about your chops...note that thesis about pork stakes, not chops. Yes it makes a big difference. Also pay attention people, the recipe calls for seasoned salt and seasoned pepper, not salt and pepper to season.  I don't use seasoned salt and pepper but that is because I reduce my salt intake. I make my own blend which is the same only less salt.

I'm from St. Louis. I've had pork steaks for sure, but not like this. I enjoyed the flavor of the apple cider vinegar. I got them started on the grill and finished in the oven with Maull's bbq sauce, of course. It was a bit different than I was used to. They came out very tender, though.

These came out good. The flavor of the vinegar was barely noticeable. I think next time I may let them sit in the vinegar and water mixture to marinate. It was a great fast and easy recipe.

I did everything the recipe said, and it still tasted like plain pork chops. Boring and disappointing. I think the vinegar may have actually dried out the chops more than if I would have left them out. Too bad :(

I loved this recipe. I used Badia Complete Seasoning and some black pepper, and sea salt instead of seasoned salt and pepper. It was absolutely amazing. My family all raved about how good it was.

Well, I don't know from St Louis or Chicago, but this recipe is fantastic.  The meat was tender and moist.  I actually added some of the "sauce" to the veggies I was sauteing.  Marcus, you turned me on to a whole new flavor/style of cooking. Love it.  Thanks

I really don't know how to rate this since I've never tasted St. Louis Chops.  All I can say is that they came out terrifically moist but had no special flavor to them. I served this with corn, applesauce (thank goodness - needed to dip the pork into it) and Betty Crocker Au Gratin potatoes.  The entire meal was prepared and cooked in under 30 min.  We like vinegar so I guess we missed the taste - if I ever make it again I think I'll serve it with french fries and sprinkle them with salt and cidar vinegar like the English do.

St. Louis born and raised.  Not a fan of vinegar at all but decided to give this a try.  Absolutely amazing in my opinion.  Super tender and very juicy pork steaks.  I know it may be blasphemous, but I didn't use a drop of BBQ sauce on my pork steak after it was done.  After eating it and thinking about that, I realized that it is like when I grill a beef steak.  It should not need sauce, the meat should speak for itself.  The only reason this gets a 4 star review is because of the wasted ingredients.  One cup of apple cider vinegar, and a commensurate amount of the accompanying ingreadients would be enough.  Keep that in mind and adjust accordingly.

I thought these were very easy to make I also added sweet baby rays bbq sauce and basted that about the last ten minutes of grilling. Mac n cheese and corn was awesome and very tasty. Have added this fj. Favorite.

BEST REVIEW EVER! :)
 Thanks to the Author for the searing tip. Absolute best.
 I believe I can answer multiple questions at once. My main charcoal grill is down in SEMO. Up near Chicago house sitting for 2 weeks, working w a propane grill.
  The "guestimate" time of 10 min is irrelevant. Like the author said, depends on the grill, heat and conditions. Be a better griller. Watch for the juices to start flowing. 6 minutes on the first side and 4 on the other was absolutely perfect for me. As far as the lid situation goes, I had to alternate between open/closed when the fat starts up in order to sear but not charcoal.  After searing, moved over to inderect heat and applied my own bbq sauce for 5 min per side.
 When you take it off the grill...wrap it in foil for 5 minutes. Trust me. At this point you should be starving, but let in cook in it's own juice.
 Thanks again to the author and I can't stress enough...use your judgement! Juices are flowing, flip it. Don't end up chewing on leather.

I grew up with Pork Steaks.  I no longer marinade my pork but use a rub.  I grill indirect for two to three hours over low heat then sauce them and wrap in aluminum foil for thirty minutes more....very tender yet hold together and very moist.  By the way, I use Maulls...still even though I now live in SC.

This recipe was a nice change from the same bbq pork steaks I usually make. I did make a couple changes - I mixed a 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar with 1/4 cup Woodchuck's Hard Apple Cider and basted the entire time it was on the grill. I LOVE vinegar, so to me, these were perfect. My husband said he couldn't taste anything and they were pretty plain. If I did this again, I would probably add some extra seasoning (other than the salt and pepper this recipe called for).
