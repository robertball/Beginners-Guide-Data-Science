I enjoyed this recipe and am making the following suggestions: use the liquid in the cans of chickpeas instead of the water, and add 1/4 cup of tahini (sesame paste). I also added one small jar of artichoke hearts and a few dashes of black pepper. Great combination of flavors!

This recipe is truly a winner, in fact, the best of the best, and I've tried probably 10 or 15 recipes for hummus in the past several months. Some were quite good, but I never could find exactly the right touch till this one. Some are too garlicky, some too sour, some too bland.  All seemed to be similar, but not quite right.  With this recipe, the curry powder is the winning secret ingredient.  The slight changes I would make is to add 1/4 c. water instead of the 1/2 (it is runnier than I prefer).  As others have said, I would lessen the curry pwd. just a mite. The next day seems to even intensify the flavors, making the curry issue even more noticeable. 
The quantity is perfect using the two cans of chickpeas.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

What a great recipe!  I thought the curry was a bit much, but everybody else liked it.  Next time I make this, I will try 3 tsp instead of 4 tsp curry powder.  I also used about 1/3 cup water, because I didn't want it too runny.  It was the perfect consistency.  I served this with grilled chicken pieces, sliced olives, tomatoes, avocados, shredded lettuce and feta cheese on pita bread.  I call them my "Greek Tacos".  Try it sometime, they are so good!

By far the best tasting hummus I have made.  The curry gives a new twist on this dish.  I had dinner guests who dislike curried dishes and hummus separately, but raved about this dish and really "dug in".

This recipe was very tasty and refreshing. I changed the servings to 8 and it made PLENTY. I also added fresh cilantro, since we love it. I served it with cut up pita wedges and cucumber slices. YUM!

I made this for my daughter who likes everything.  She didn't like it, that's why I'm giving it three stars.  I cut in half, left out the hotsauce, and it still has plenty of kick.  I like it  all right, I put it on my pita sandwich at lunch, along with lettuce, Craisins, & feta cheese.  I will probably keep looking for a recipe that both my daughter and I can enjoy.

This was just ok for me. Everyone else seemed to love it though so I'm giving it 4 stars. I usually really enjoy curry powder, but for some reason it was very overpowering to me. I even used less then called for! I would make it again, but try some slight changes.

I love hummus, and this is the best I think I've ever made. The curry makes it terrific, the texture is excellent, and the recipe is adaptable. I did add two tablespoons of sesame tahini.   One thing that I am in the habit of doing with hummus is mixing all of the ingredients *except* the garbanzo beans. This creates a dressing of sorts, and more evenly blends the flavors. Then, slowly pour this dressing into the food processor with the garbanzo beans. It really does make a difference, and prevents the hummus from having super-spicy or bland spots.

Good recipe, just made a few tweaks. I didn't bother rinsing the beans, just used the can and top to drain and reserved fluid. Didn't have curry, so used 4 tsps of cumin. Only had a little over 4 tbsps of fresh lemon juice to use, but I think 6 tbsp might have been a bit much. Only needed 1/4 cup reserved fluid from cans to make a nice consistency. Added a bit of salt, cayenne and freshly ground pepper. Delicious!!

VERY good. I did not like the hot sauce added to it, BUT I added fresh horseradish instead and it is amazing! Also a bit more curry than measured.

It was ok, VERY strong curry flavor though.  I think I like regular tahini hummus better but this was unique and a nice change of pace.

This was good, I used 3 teaspoons of curry instead of 4 given some reviews.  Flavor was great, friends who won't normally eat hummus or curry loved it!

I used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup tahini, and a lot of hot sauce.  It came out deliciously curried and lemony.

Easy peasy, and delicious. And there is plenty of room for variation. Don't start with the really cheap beans, though. Organic is best.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars but I changed it quite a bit to fit my own taste, I just don't thinks it's fair to ding a recipe that wasn't followed. My changes were meant to make a smaller batch and to match my tastes and it turned out fantastic. 1 - 16oz can "Bush" Chick Peas, 1 Tablespoons Tahini, 2 to 3 Tablespoons Olive Oil, 3 garlic cloves, 1 Teaspoon yellow curry powder, 2 Tablespoons Lemon Juice, 1/8 to 1/4 cup filtered water, dash salt, 2 dashes hot sauce. This turned out magnificent. The amount of curry was flavorful but not overwhelming. The garlic was VERY notable so if you want to reduce the garlic you can, I just love garlic and loved this so much I will make it over and over again! Update; I made this again for a party and this time I followed the recipe exactly and while I still enjoyed it, I think it was just so so for my guests. There was a lot left at the end of an eight hour party with 23 people in attendance :( my son who loves Indian food and who loves hummus thought it was just so so for him. I think this would be good in a hummus sampler type serving tray with a variety of other flavors to sample but on its own as the main hummus dip, not so much.

This is an awesome hummus recipe!  I love curry and I never thought to use it for this!  I also added tahini into mine and blended it all in my Magic Bullet and it was magnificent!  I would suggest to add less curry and garlic like 2 cloves and/ or a couple less tsp of curry powder if you find it to be a bit strong. Start with less and add more to your taste!

Quick, easy and tasty.  I left out the Curry and instead of regular Hot Sauce I used a flavoured hot sauce  -  For the pita... try using Greek Style Pita - cut into triangles place on plate with damp paper towel over top - microwave for 10 secs and then place in oven until outter crust is lightly toasted.

Daughter said, "Cold curry tastes funny!  Stick to all your hot curry dishes." I personally sort of liked it but it didn't get eaten. The Roasted Red Pepper Hummus recipe I follow, disappears quickly, though.

LOVED THIS!! I only had one tin of chick peas so I halved the recipe and it came out fabulous....my three boys loved this too with some pita bread. The only thing I did differently was rinsed the peas and took the time to remove the soft skins that just peel right off the peas. I find doing this results in a smoother hummus. All in all this was great and will surely make it again. Thanks Jean :)

Aside from the few other problems with this recipe, there's no tahini. Hummus isn't hummus without tahini, and not only is it not hummus it's also not flavourful.

So delicious. I added four garlic cloves as I'm a garlic fiend, and followed the recipe revision suggestions about using the liquid from the drained garbanzo beans.  Another reviewer suggested mixing this with water-packed tuna for a delicious and healthful lunch and I'm going to try it.  This rocks!

Nevr met a humuus I didn't like.  This is good.  Try adding a soft baked sweet potato, mashed to your hummus recipe, too.  Tasty and wonderful colour as is this Curried Hummus recipe.  Thank you!!

Excellent. I made some modifications I used 4 cups of garbanzo beans (cooked) but the lemon was too strong so I added another cup of beans (I pressure cook my own) and 3 more cloves of garlic and additional  1 1/2 teaspoons of curry powder along with about 1/2 cup of Tahini.  It is delicious.

I like Curry, but none of us liked it whatsoever.  I used the traditional tahini paste.  But nothing cut the over powering curry.  Gonna try again with maybe a pinch of curry, maybe.

I was rather anxious to try this recipe after the reviews.  I have been a hummus lover for a long long time and am always on the lookout for a way to spice it up.  The addition of curry does give it a unique flavor.  I would recommend a lesser quantity as the flavor does become more pungent overnight.  Similar to the other reviewers, less water is recommended.  The flavor does seem to tire after a few spoonfuls.  Would I make this again?  I have to say no-this recipe is not for me.  I will skip the curry and add the tahini.

I love hummus but never tried making it. This recipe is super simple, takes just a couple minutes and is very tasty indeed. You can make adjustments as your taste demands; more or less salt, garlic or lemon, but just sticking to the formula here gets a satisfying result.

This Hummus Rocked! Like other reviewers I started off with only 1/4 cup of water instead of a half. The texture wasn't quite what I wanted so I just added a little more water until it was perfect! Definitely try it, this is sooo good!

LOOKS LIKE MUSTARD  I followed the directions, but it looked like mustard.  Being from Texas, I like the Tex-Mex flavors better.  When I make this recipe again, I will substitute CUMIN for curry powder.

This is excellent and would especially be enjoyed by all of us who like curry. I, too, would cut back on the water/bean juice and only add what is needed to consistancy preferred. Great flavor!

meh?! not very good. tastes like curry seasoning with lemon. I won't be making this again.  It is doable with Saracha hot sauce mixed in...and bell peppers to eat it with...but i like a hummus that can hold it's own...this does not in my opinion.

Delicious! The combination of spices is fantastic.  I followed another reviewer's advice and added a few TBSP. sesame tahini and that made the second batch even better.  Served on toasted bread with meat and veggies for a scrumptious open-faced sandwhich.

Pretty tasty!  Will be a good spread on falafels I am making for dinner later in the week. Good recipe if you don't have tahini on hand.

I normally do not like hummus, but I loved this one. I served it at a small Indian themed dinner party, and it was GOBBLED up by all my guests. Some of my guests were lovers of hummus and commented that they liked the refreshing difference of this dish. So easy, and so good. Highly recommended!

This was okay, but not a keeper. I followed others reviews and used the chickpea juice instead of water.  But unfortunately I didn't follow the suggestions of using less liquid.  1/2 cup was definately too much and made the hummus runny. Also, there was too much lemon juice. I think I prefer hummus recipes with tahini, too. This wasn't bad, but I like other more traditional recipes.

This hummus recipe is easy to make. It is cheaper to make than using tahini. I did not add hot sauce to the recipe. I made some vegetable and curried hummus sandwiches for a party and these sandwiches got snagged right away. The curried hummus was still good a few days later and I used it with celery.

I made this differently as well. I actually used one clove of Elephant garlic, half an onion and sauteed them with the garbanzo beans. I used the juice from 1 lemon, 2 tbsp. of Tahini (homemade) and only used 3 tsp. of the curry. I also decided to use two cloves of black garlic and some Siracha instead of hot sauce. It turned out amazing.

I love the concept of this recipe and will be play around with it some more. I cut the water down to 1/4 cup and it came out the perfect consistency but next time I will cut the lemon juice down to 3 or 4 tablespoons....6 turned out to be way too much and the lemon is overpowering the curry (I used 2 1/2 teaspoons curry as it will get stronger as it sits before I bring it to a party as a dish to pass). Overall a great start though! Thanks for the recipe :)

Yummy Yummy! I've tried making hummus in the past and I don't like the fact that I have to buy tahini paste - which something I don't use much. But this recipe is awesome. Everything it called for I had in my pantry and it was easy and quick to make. I added the curry powder and lemon a bit at a time so I could make it such that it was perfect to my taste. Overall, a fabulous recipe. Ill be taking this dip to a tea party this weekend :)

Def depends on the type of curry you use.  My curry mix has about 10 ingredients but OMGGGGG, this was amazing.  I used freshly cooked dried chick peas (major corn allergy so can't do too much canned stuff) and it was fine.  No more store bought for me.  This is a keeper.  Thx Jean.

FANTASTIC!  (My tip @ end)  My family loves hummus, and this recipe is the tastiest, easiest ever!  I pressure canned garbanzo beans (chick peas) tonight, and had left-over beans, so searched AllRecipes for hummus.  Love curry, love hummus, so this was the recipe I chose to try tonight.  SO GLAD I did!  Here's my tip:  If you love pressure canning, make up this recipe and then put the heated hummus in pint or 8-oz. canning jars and pressure-can it.  Then you will have inexpensive, DELICIOUS hummus on your pantry shelves whenever you wish.  My hubby is always complaining that we have "ingredients" but no "food", but with this on the shelves, I am using my food storage and he can find something ready to eat on the pantry shelves!

I will never buy hummus again. This is so easy, and wonderful. I actually started with dried beans in the crockpot

This was my first time making hummus and I kind of winged it. I made a few changes to the recipe so this isn't quite a fair review. First, I was almost out of curry powder so I used 1t curry and 2t cumin (too much cumin even though i love it). Also i followed other user's suggestions and used 1/4c liquid from the beans which was perfect. Anymore liquid would have been too much. Really different, and good though. I'll try it again!!

I'm sorry to say I added a couple of tablespoons of tostitos nacho cheese dip - but just to appease the kids. Otherwise the curry was a nice touch when you don't have tahini in the house. I also made the water and curry changes suggested elsewhere in these reviews.

I needed a lot of water to get this to a good consistency and I added a lot more spices after tasting. But it wound up tasting great.

Really good recipe. I didn't change too much, just added a little sesame oil, not too much, about 1/2 tsp. I can hardly stay out of it, and it's for tomorrow! (Superbowl Sunday).

I love curry and thought the curry flavor was delicious, but the lemon juice was really overpowering. I will be cutting it back to 3 or 4 Tbsp next time. I totally lost the flavor of the garlic becuase of the lemon. I have it in the fridge and hope I can finish it, but I might just throw it out.

This is the best hummus I've ever had!! Of course, it doesn't taste anything like the traditional stuff...details!! I could eat this stuff all day long. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because 1/2 c. water is waaay to much. I didn't put any in to begin, then added it to the processor till it was the correct consistency. Maybe 1/4 c. Otherwise, perfect!!

I love curry, but I didn't like it with hummus as I felt the flavor overpowered the dish. I guess I'm just a traditionalist so I'll stick with my regular hummus recipe.

Wow, so great and zingy! I felt like hummus but I didn't have any bread in the house so I made it into the best salad ever. I left the chick peas whole, added some pine nuts,raisins, diced red pepper and cilantro. I would take it to a party it was so good.

This recipe was very good. I didn't use the suggestion to use less water and the hummus turned out a little runny. I'm hoping that it will thinken a little after sitting for a while.

Great tasting recipe! The curry adds an extra kick. As another reviewer suggested, I used part of the fluid from the chick pea can, and came out with a good consistency. I also left out the hot sauce. Served with puppodoms.

We like garlic, so added some garlic powder to make the garlic taste stronger without having extra chunks of garlic. Used the liquid from chickpeas as mentioned in other previews. Used less curry, just eyeballed it. Very good. We will make it again. :)

I followed the other reviews suggestions and was glad I did. A little curry goes a long way. I also didn't add any liquid until the food processor was running and then added a little at a time until it was the consistency I liked.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  Part of me thinks it's really tasty, but the other part of me thinks the flavors are just overwhelming.  I don't like it as a dip, but I did like it when I put it in a pita with cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach, and yogurt.  I guess the curry flavor is managable when mixed with other flavors?  Also, I did prefer this after I mixed it with a little bit of plain yogurt. It mellowed the flavor a bit, and also gave it some of the creaminess that you'd usually get from tahini.

Maybe I like things spicier than others- I actually plan to try it again with more curry the next time I make it. I found the recipe as is kind of bland. Although I did not add any hot sauce as it mentioned at the bottom. Maybe that it would have helped

Made as recipe stated but cut garlic in half. Had to add additional water through food processor lid to get desired consistency. Flavor improves after refrigeration and the following day. Check out my picture.

I used the liquid from the chickpeas instead of water, and 1/3 - 1/2 cup tahini.  No fresh lemon in the house, so I used fresh lime.  Added 1/2 tsp of onion salt instead of plain salt.  Toasted & sliced some flour tortillas and served.  Received great reviews!  I'll try it again with other flavors/spices.  Can't believe how simple it was!!!

I made this as written, except I reduced the water by 2 tbs.  It tastes great, just like curry hummus should.  I notice those who gave it bad ratings complained about the curry taste--it's not going to taste like regular hummus, it should taste like curry.

First time making hummus, and I really enjoyed the final product! I actually blended this recipe with the Real Hummus recipe (see bottom link). I added 2 tablespoons of tahini, and only 5 tablespoons of lemon juice and only used 1/3 cup of water. I also omitted the hot sauce since my pregnant wife has been having trouble with spicy foods.

Next time I make this I'll probably end up cutting the lemon juice down to 4 tablespoons, garlic down to 2 cloves and curry powder down to 3 teaspoons. It's delicious, but it seems like it's a just a little bit too much of everything.

I substituted lime juice for most of the lemon juice.  Like the addition of curry and hot red pepper and black pepper.  Ended up much better and cheaper than the store bought versions.

I just finished making this recipe for the first time-- it is great! I don't usually like home made hummus until it's been chilled, but with this one I licked the spoon clean! Haha. I followed the recipe exactly (abnormal for me). I used about four generous drops of hot sauce, and maybe 1/8 tsp of salt. These "to taste" instructions just kill me! Anyhow, it's great, a bit spicy, but not too much. I blended it until it was really very smooth. My new favorite hummus, I think! Thanks!

Wow - this was GREAT. I didn't have any tahini so I searched for a hummus recipe without one. I upped the garlic, lemon juice, and curry powder because we like STRONG hummus, and this was so good! I might add tahini next time as a reviewer suggested. Thanks, will make over and over!

I made this for a party (twice) and it was a hit, both times. Loved it. Loved it so much I made home made pita chips to go with it. My husband the curry-hater LOVED this. It was so GOOD. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I felt it was missing something. So I added some onion....great!

This is the first hummus I have made, and it was easy.  However, it is very lemony and garlicy.  I will halve both componants next time.

Sooo good exactly as is, although I sometimes add more curry (I'm a big fan). The only downside of this hummus is I cannot stop eating it!!!

I use about half as much curry and lemon juice as is called for and it makes the best hummus.  People always want the recipe when I bring to parties.

I made this for my pre natal class, and served it with mixed veggies and plantain chips.  Everyone loved it...especially my boyfriend!  The amount of curry was just right and goes particularly well with the plantain chips.  I will definately make this very often!

I hated the lemon taste and so did my family, a rare case of everyone agreeing. I threw it all away BUT I am going to try it again with little or no lemon because I do think the recipe should work well.

Perhaps it would be better if I cut down the lemon juice. I did scale the recipe in exactly 1/2 via the online tool so that shouldn't have messed anything up.

I'm not a fan of curry, but was pleasantly surprised by how good this was.  The consistency was just right for dipping too.  I used 3 t. spicy curry seasoning and added a dash of cayenne for some extra heat.  Hubby loved it, and it would be an easy crowd pleaser for a potluck.

I have made this twice now for my health, trying to lower my Blood Pressure. Anyway, my 2nd time I used tumeric instead of the curry for a change, and added two good size pieces of roasted red peppers. Just as good!  I haven't tried it on bagels yet, but it sure would be great on sesame bagels.

This was a nice change from traditional hummus, especially with the curry powder. I think next time I will try it with tahini. Thank you for sharing!

This is a GREAT recipe to start with. I ended up adding cilantro, chili powder, garlic salt, and ground ginger. I, too, used the juice from the can. I pretty much tweeked the amount of all the spices to taste. I can't seem to stop eating it!

This recipe was okay, at best.  It was a little too lemony and came out a little thinner than I would have liked.  If I make this again I will definitely cut the lemon juice in half, at least.  It took the advice of a previous review and cut the curry in half and, in substitution, added fresh ground pepper.  In the future, instead of 6 tbls lemon juice, I will use only 3 tbls and then 3 tbls of the canned liquid.  I will use only 1/4 cup of canned liquid instead of 1/2 cup of water.

Wonderful recipe!  I served it with carrot sticks and homemade garlic pita chips.  My family (including a 3yo & 5yo) devoured it.  No leftovers!  There is a strong curry flavor so the curry blend used is important.  I used a curry bought from an Indian grocer rather than one from someplace like Walmart.

Making this for the second time, it was a big hit, did the water by sight versus measurement the first time.  I like that it give a low fat option with healthy EVOO versus tahini which isn't the best.  I might add a little toasted sesame oil this time to change it up a little!

Very Good! I moved to a small town, and can't find the caliber hummus I'm used to. This recipe hits the spot! I used red curry, and the amount was perfect. Plenty of hot sauce really added a lot of body. I recommend just using the water as a general guide. Just add water until you get the consistency you like. I don't have a food processor or blender and I was still able to make this. Just mash up the chickpeas before you add any ingredients. It won’t be as creamy, but still oh so good! Thanks!

A nice, healthy and fresh-tasting hummus recipe. I agree with using 1/3 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. I also used 3 teaspoons curry powder instead of 4 teaspoons. Very easy to put together in a food processor.

This is the first time that I prepared and tasted hummus and/or garbanzo beans. Very tasty!

My husband loved it, but I wasn't as much a fan.  The taste was just ok and found myself adding more garlic and olive oil to make it better.  I added less water like others said and the consistency was good.

This is the perfect flavor for hummus.. it spices it up enough, but isn't overpowering.  I usually love the roasted red pepper hummus.. but this is my new favorite.

Very good recipe! I cut back the curry, as some of the other suggestions indicated and added an extra clove of garlic.  It is very good on the 2nd day, after all the flavors have thoroughly combined.

I used dried chick peas (traditionally prepared) and used the water they cooked in. I opted, also, for garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. otherwise, I followed the instructions given. the curry powder was perfect! thanks for the recipe!

I thought the curry destroyed the hummus.
I will be going back to my old hummus recipe.

I added the tahini and replaced the water with the liquid from the cans and it was still too runny. So I added some black beans and it turned out really cool - although still a little too runny. Next time I will start with very little liquid and add as necessary.

My guests were all over this hummus.  If you are a bit bored of traditional hummus the curry really adds a refreshing taste.  Can't wait to make it again.

Good alternative to plain hummus. I added Tahini, which  was just instinctual.

The texture was pretty good.  The curry was overwhelming and needed some other flavor to balance it.  Not too bad, but we will not make it again.
