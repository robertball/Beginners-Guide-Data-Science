I have been a member of this site since 2000 and have never rated a recipe before today. But I just had to add my input for this one. I have been making this every year since 12/4/2000. Every year I have to make many batches. It disappears quickly. In fact just the other night a woman I did not know, stopped me at a party before I left to ask me for the recipe. Of course I gave her this website and the name of the recipe. I would like to address some of the issues that I have read. If your candy turned out greasy the butter and brown sugar probably were not fully combined before it was poured on. You have to stir it every 30 seconds and it may need another 30 if not combined after 2 min. If the edges were burnt, check your oven temp. with an oven themometer. It may be running a little hot. I have made this in several different ovens over the years and have found this to be the case. If it comes out soupy it may not have cooked for long enough or the oven may be running not hot enough. When you put on the pecans or other nuts of choice, lightly press with your hand flat or with the bottom of a large measuring cup. Less topping will be lost.Also another variation, try with white chocolate chips and crused candy canes.I have made 6 batches of this within the past couple of days and will probably make a few more. It's a great last minute gift.

This was Excellent! One Change that my Husband thought of and made a Great Difference is using Graham Crackers instead of Saltines.  We tried both and favor the Cinnamon Graham Crackers! The first batch we burned...I think ours only took like 10-13min...So keep a Close Eye on it.

Oh My God!  This was absolutely delicious!  I found that mine burned around the edges so I'll have to play around with the baking time.  I also found that semi-sweet chips over-powered the pecans so I tried milk chocolate chips and toasted chopped almonds for the perfect match.  I sprinkled the chips and nuts at the same time, waited a couple of minutes and then spread the melted chocolate with the nuts so that the nuts wouldn't fall off.

My only change to this recipe is that I crush the crackers, then stir the cracker crumbs into the sugar/butter mixture and pour into a greased pan.  That way I don't have to worry about all the crackers getting coated enough.  This is heavenly!

I have to admit I was very skeptical about this one!  I wouldn't have tried it but the reviews were so good!  And it really was everything that everybody said it was!  I even used SALTED crackers cause thats what I had on hand, and they were so good I had to hide them in the freezer so they woudn't get eaten in one sitting.  They defrosted great too.  I recommend this one!

i made this bark just this morning with a slightly different recipe, but it was just as popular and tasty as this one evidently is.  i used saltines on a 12x17 pan and didn't need cooking spray.  i boiled 1 cup butter with 1 cup  white sugar for 2 mins., spread it on the saltines, and baked at 400 degrees for 8 mins.  i mixed 12 oz. choc chips with 10 oz. peanut butter chips and spread on top with a rubber spatula.  too delicious for words!

Very easy recipe and everyone loved it.  They were all impressed with my candy-making ability.

I did make the mistake of doubling the recipe and putting two pans in the oven at once.  The pan I put on the bottom burned.  So, if you double the recipe, put one pan in the oven at a time and don't use a lower rack.

This recipe is great! I made 3 batches at Xmas.  I've found that 17-20 mins can be too long and result in a burnt taste in spots, so I cook it for 10-13 minutes.  Also, I have mixed in a cup of milk choc. chips with a cup of semisweet for a smoother chocolate taste, which has worked well also.

This stuff was amazing! I found it was more efficient to soak a few crackers at a time in the hot butter and sugar mixture and then place them on the foil instead of pouring the mixture right onto all of the crackers.  And I only kept them in the oven for 10 minutes (I was afraid they would burn).  Great recipe!

Very good and very easy!  The second time I made this I used milk chocolate pieces in place of the semisweet and I liked it even better. I also only use about 1/3 cup pecans because any more than that seem to fall off for me when I break them.

First off, DO NOT substitute margarine for the butter!  The water content in most margarines will not work in this recipe.  Also, I had to microwave for about 3 minutes after I added the sugar to get it fully combined with the butter.  I also used 40 crackers and had plenty of topping.  (They were also salted because it's what I had.)  This candy is the bomb!  It was easy and so yummy I can't stay out of it.

Warning!:  The cookie sheet must be a jelly roll pan (the ones with the four sides).  Otherwise, as I found out by trial and error, the caramel sauce drips EVERYWHERE onto your oven.  I don't know what I was thinking, but they were tight on the sheet when they went into the oven, but all over the place when they came out!

Other than that, it was good candy, not great but good!  Thanks for the recipe!

***Caution*** Very, very addictive.   Everyone loved it!  I would recommend only cooking for about 13-15 minutes.  I think it would have burned if I cooked it more.  14 was perfect for me.  LOVE IT!

if i could give it more stars...i would!  i used graham crackers, semi and milk choc chips, and a handful of mini butterscotch chips, all in all maybe a cup and half altogether and it was plenty. i also topped with some toffee bits that i had left over from another recipe. i used parchment which made for easy removal. soooo yummy, with a rich buttery flavour.

Really good!  Using a glass dish, I nuked the sugar/butter until the combination bubbled as other reviewers mentioned.  The dish was wide enough to easily dip each cracker into the mixture (careful--it's very hot) so that it was evenly coated.  I thought that there was going to be a lot of the sugar/butter mixture left over but it was the perfect amount for the 35 crackers.  Not being a big fan of chocolate, I probably only used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  The result was very good, easy and inexpensive.

This was so simple and so good.  It's so easy to put together too!  This one is a keeper!  I didn't have to cook it for 17 minutes...i only had it in the oven for maybe 10 minutes, because it was starting to brown on the egde.  It turned out perfect without the extra cook time.  I also melted butter on stove and added brown sugar til it was completely disolved, then poured over crackers.

This certainly is an addicting, delishous, yummy recipe!!  After reading reviews, I decided try both saltines and graham crackers in the same pan.  I liked the graham crackers better...but that's a personal taste.  Also, I found it a lot easier to crumble the crackers into small size pieces and put that on the pan instead of individual crackers.  This way all the cracker pieces were covered with the sugar/butter mix.  I was very disappointed that most of the pecans fell off the crackers so on my second batch I added in the cup of pecans to the sugar/butter mix BEFORE pouring over crackers.  That worked out wonderful!!  Be sure to buy extra of all incredients because you'll definetly want to make a second batch.

Don't understand what the rave reviews are about.  It was okay, but not great.  If I make it again, it will be to include in gift baskets--it does make a huge batch.  Now get out those toothbrushes!

This is a great and easy recipe.  It is very addicting.  However, turn the oven down to 300 degrees.  Caramel should not be heated to such a high temp.  That is why there are so many complaints about burned edges.  Use wax paper to press nuts into the chocolate.  I use crushed natural almonds and club crackers.  It turns out wonderful!

WhenI first read that this recipe had saltines in it I immediately judged that it would not be good, but based on previous reviews gave it a shot.  I brought it into work for a co-workers retirement party.  It was a huge hit and had several requests for the recipe.  I used salted saltines, melted the butter and brown sugar in a pan - stirring constantly so it didnt burn.  Make sure to use a cookie sheet with sides because it will leak.  Baked at 350 for about 7-8 minutes (I used a stoneware bar pan, so if you make more than 1 batch beware that if the stone is warm for the 2nd batch cook less time!).  I used 1 bag of mini milk chocolate morsels, pecans and pressed down with a spoon (as recommended by previous reviewers).  I made 2 batches - so on the 2nd batch I used shredded coconut.  Very very good.  Next time might try different crackers and maybe some different types of toppings (marshmallow, caramel)...the possibilities are endless.  Highly recommend this recipe - would be a great addition to a Christmas cookie platter.

Ok, I pulled a typical "brooke" and made these the first time on a flat baking sheet without raised edges.  DO NOT DO THAT or you will have the caramel sauce all over the bottom of your oven.  sigh... Also, make sure to stir your heated butter/sugar mixture for a full 2 mins; it will eventually combine into the thicker caramel consistency.   I pour both semi sweet and milk choc chips on mine...delicious.  And the cooking time is way too much, 7-10 mins is more like it.  THESE ARE DELICIOUS!

My daughter found this recipe last night and called to tell me about it. She said her 3 children (my babies) took most of them to school today for their snack. I usually do a similar recipe kinda like toffee using graham crackers. I just finished these using the Saltines and set them in the fridge to cool. My house smells like a candy store from the melted butter and brown sugar; heavenly! Oven temps absolutely vary. I have a thermometer in mine and when baking something in my daughter's oven I have to remember that her oven is about 16 degrees HOTTER than mine and oh how that plays a serious role in something overbaked or even burnt! The oven thermometer is well worth having and you can find them at super stores and in most cases, your favorite grocery store.  Excellent recipe, super easy to prepare and ingredients almost always hanging out in the pantry.  Thanks for sharing!! I will absolutely do these again.

Great and easy recipe.  I used saltines and skipped the nuts.  I sprinkled red and green sprinkles on top instead to take home for christmas.  I think everyone will love this rich snack!  (That is if my husband and I don't eat the whole batch on the car ride home!)

Have been making these for years, but do a few things differently. 
 I use 40 crackers, melt the butter on the stove and add the brown sugar to the pot stirring constantly until the mixture is bubbly and thick.
 Bake for 5 minutes at 400 degrees. 
I like to add colorful sprinkles or jimmies on top of the chocolate before refrigerating.
Yum Yum!!

Wow, these were surprisingly great.  And they are so versatile.  I made some with white chocolate and almonds and put a little cinnamon in the butter sugar mixture.  The were delicious as x-mas treats

I must have looked at this recipe a dozen times before deciding to make it. So glad I did...It is so good! I found that using a wisk the last time I stirred it really combined the butter and brown sugar well. Also 15 minutes in the oven worked perfectly for me. I just kept checking it after 12 minutes.

I made these last nite and WOW sooo easy and made the house smell great! I used graham crackers because I didn't have any soda crackers and I used chopped walnuts. Hubby kept asking me when they were going to ready. He even had some for breakfast this morning! Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out perfect. My co-workers loved it. I used just one cup of mini chocolate chips and put the nuts on at the same time so when I spread the chocolate the nuts would stick. It worked great! PS: I used salted crackers.

I'm making this right now and boy! this is great and EASY! Only two things I would recommend,DON"T cook them for 17-20 minutes like suggested,the recipe said 'Should bubble,not burn' ha! Less than 10 minutes is idea and you really don't have to leave it in there the full hour. 40-45 minutes,it's good and hard. But you try whatever works for you.

First time, brittle was skimpy and did not sufficiently coat all crackers. Second time,used 1 1/2 times brittle ingredients called for, making it fool proof.

I make these all the time but I use salted saltines. Something about the salt and the sweet taste.  Also this year I used half milk chocolate chips and half mint chocolate.  It gave a light mint taste. Great for an alternate.

I made this three times before Christmas. It kept disappearing! I mixed milk chocolate with semi-sweet chocolate chips and used sliced almonds on top. Also, using salted crackers worked fine. I shared the recipe with five friends. We all thought this was easy and tasty!

This is a fun, easy and Cheap recipe to make and looks like a million. To hurry the process along, after adding the chips I did put it back in the oven for about a minute and then spread the chocolate. I'm thinking I might also top with marachino  or candied cherries next batch. There goes the diet!

REALLY sweet.  Mine turned out a bit soupy, but were definitely eaten until gone.  We just used unsalted saltine crackers, as we don't use soda crackers very often.

AWESOME!!!  Everyone loves this and it tastes like  it was made at an expensive little candy shop.  Be sure to cook it long enough so it's not gooey and nuts need to sink into chocolate to stick.

This recipe was awesome!  I was looking for a toffee recipe - and decided to try this one based on some of the other reviews.  It was so easy and fast.  I was also skeptical about using the crackers - but they gave them an extra crunch.  I put them in Holiday gift baskets  and am making another batch right now for all the people who asked me to "PLLLEEEASE! make them some more."

Addictive, sweet and crunchy, almost like a store bought bar! I had to watch the cooking process because the crackers browned up fast. Very good.

I have been making this for years. I call it chocolate crack. If you don't cook the sugar for the right amount of time it will be chewy, not crisp. I have even used less butter and it turns out fine.

Followed to the T, with the exception of cooking the butter and sugar on the stove instead of in the microwave. Otherwise, just keep an eye when it's in the oven so it doesn't burn.  Used pecans, and was a perfect treat! Also makes a big batch, so it's good to give away as gifts for the holidays.

Great receipe as is, but I prefer to use graham crackers instead of saltines.  So yummy.  Because of so many nut allergies, I now use crushed candy canes instead of nuts.  I also do not spread my chocolate chips.  I prefer how they look with whole chocolate chips. I also do not use foil- tried it once and could not get the foil off the brittle.

Delicious and easy! To ensure that the sugar and butter are fully combined before pouring over crackers, they may require a little additional time in the microwave. Also, I wish I knew the importance of using a cookie tray with raised edges/lips before baking these - I ended up with a LOT of burnt butter and sugar on the bottom of my oven, and a very smoky kitchen.  oops!

This recipe was wonderful.  I did use graham crackers as some others did just because I had them.  I cooked this on the stove top rather than the microwave since my microwave is unpredictable.  Then I only had to cook it for 10 minutes in the oven.  I left off the chocolate chips and it tasted great without them.

I heard that these were addicting so foolish me tried them.  Yup I can see why, these are sooooo good.  I used plain graham crackers instead of the soda crackers and I added the chopped pecans to almost all of the crackers and added a little bit of chopped candy cane kisses to some,  Both were very good, my husband loved it and so did the kids.  Thanks for this delicious treat, it will definitely be made again!

This is a very good recipe!  Can't keep it around for very long at our house that's for sure!  I also have a similar recipe that uses a box of graham crackers, 1 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Layer a cookie sheet with parchment paper or spray foil with cooking spray.  Place crackers onto p. paper or foil, close together but not on top of each other.  Melt butter in small pan, add sugars, bring to a boil and stir every 30 seconds for about 2 to 2.5 minutes - judge carefully as this mixture can burn quickly!  Pour butter/sugar mixture over crackers, add pecans, pressing them lightly into crackers.  Bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes.  With a box of graham crackers, I typically get 3 cookie sheets full!  Amazing with saltines too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

What an easy way to whip up a quick dessert that everyone will love! This is also the perfect recipe to use when making goodies with kids- minimal steps, fast, yummy! You can experiment with the type of chips; chocolate are great, but others are equally good (cinnamon chips, butterscotch chips, etc). I'd never omit the pecans though. The recipe calls it optional, but I strongly disagree. It adds to the overall presentation in a huge way. I use glazed pecans and crunch them up while they're still in the package. They come out in all different sizes with a little dust, all of which look great on the finished product. This is a recipe to hang onto!

im glad i found this! it was incredibly easy to make. i microwaved the butter/sugar until the two blended and the sugar crystals were dissolved completely (took about 3 minutes for me) & i baked it at the temp called for on the recipe but turned it down to 325 degrees halfway through my baking time (which was 15 minutes total) because i worried it would burn. i took it out of the oven when i could see the tops of some of my crackers that werent completely covered in the butter/sugar mix were a nice golden brown & i immediately sprinkled with chocolate chips then waited a few minutes before spreading them all over the crackers which worked great. i do, however, think the butter/sugar mix needs to be doubled to get a nice (thicker) layer of toffee & next time i make it i think i'll break the crackers up slightly, rather than leaving them whole, just to fit my own personal preferences. thanks for the recipe!

This is the first recipe I've ever rated. It is awesome. I adapted slightly based on what other reviewers said, and it turned out perfect. I wasn't sure about the microwave approach, so here's what I did: 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown. Combine with 1 c butter in saucepan. Bring to boil over medium heat; boil for 2 minutes (stirring constantly). Pour over 35 saltines, bake at 400 for 8 minutes. Sprinkle choc chips over top (1 c semi-sweet, 1 cup milk choc), let sit for a minute or two (no need to put back in oven), then spread with spatula. Sprinkle with 1/2 c chopped pecans. Refrigerate. Tips: use non-stick foil. It works great. Don't use a pan that's too big. Too much of the toffee runs off the sides rather than staying confined to where the crackers are. Push the nuts slightly into the chocolate with a spatula (or with wax paper and your hands). Put the pan in the refrigerator for an hour or two before breaking. YUM. This is amazing stuff. May try graham crackers next time. But honestly, the saltines are amazing (I used unsalted tops).

I have made these for years especially during the holidays, but with graham crackers instead.  Saltines are wonderful, but plain graham crackers add a special touch.

Chocolate covered crackers. Hmm, amazing what people think of, isn't it? I had to try this! Everybody loved it and couldn't believe it when I told them how to make it. Initially I found it too sweet, but after a day or 2 it mellowed. Will make again, thank you.

Very good, but like so many others, my first batch burnt. I would start watching them at about 9 minutes because, depending on your oven, they go from fine to burnt quickly. It's also very hard to tell when they are starting to burn. IMO, I would take them out at 10-11 minutes because I don't think you can undercook these but you can definitely overcook them and they do NOT taste good when they are even slightly burnt!

Made this today and it is very good. My husband loves this stuff !! 
 I tried another recipe for this brittle and I find that this ine is much better. I cooked it for 13 minutes and the "brittle" part came out much better than the other one I used. After adding the chocolate chips, I sprinkled the pecans on and then just spread it all together over the top. The nuts get mixed in and don't fall off. I will be making this again ! I used the salted saltines.

Everyone is so shocked when I tell them it's made with crackers. It just tastes like delicious chocolate covered toffee. I love the idea of making a toffee without a candy thermometer.

Just jolly wonderful! I would suggest that 2 cups semi-sweet is just a tat too strong. For a mild, yet just-as-yummy taste, replace 1 cup semi-sweet with 1 cup butterscotch...yum!! Good job!

This is a great recipe!  Great taste and texture, very easy to make.  My family doesn't care for toffee because it's too hard, this is the perfect answer.  I made exactly as instructed except added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the butter/sugar mix.  Will definately make for the upcoming holidays!

Had these for tea at a nearby bed and breakfast.  Don't make the mistake I made, added one pound instead of one cup of butter.  You only need two sticks.  A little bit goes a long way.

This was very good, I did alter it a little.
This is what I did, first of all make sure that when you melt the butter & sugar after each 30 second interval you stir it well & at the last 30 second ( 2 minute mark ) you stir all the butter into the sugar to make your caramel. This is time consuming but well worth it if you do not want your caramel to break. Also for the amount of caramel I was able to use 52 crackers & I probably could have made even more, but I just piled it on. I used a wooden spoon to get a nice smooth texture. For my oven they baked 6 minutes @ 350.  Instead of semi sweet chocolate, I used 2 cups of real good milk chocolate & I microwaved until it was nice & creamy, then I added 1 teaspoon of baking cocoa powder. I smoothed it on the crackers with a wooden spoon & topped it all off with crushed walnuts & cracked sea salt. Now I have to say they are 5 star. I gave them to some of my friends & they could not tell they were made with saltines. Smoothing on the layers makes a big difference. Enjoy!!!

Look at this ....I made this recipe today and it is quick and simple. Tasted good.  I did change two things.  I used Lightly salted matzo crackers.  I used 6 of them.  I broke them up first instead of at the end.  When it says to add brown sugar and the butter I did that . & I added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips  when the butter is melted with the brown sugar. Microwave every 30 seconds stir for a total 2 minutes.  After melted poured over pieces put in oven like abov until it's bubbling good.  With another 1/2 to 3/4 c more of melted chocolate chips. Pull pans out and pour over top.  Place nuts on top put back in oven for about 5 minutes. ( I used crushed cashews).  It's done !  Thank you for the idea
It looks the same as picture above.

Holy heaven, this stuff is amazing! I accidentally bought salted crackers instead of unsalted and is can't imagine it any other way! I love it. Other than using salted crackers, I made the recipe exactly as is and it turned out perfect. I'm going to have to give this stuff away so I don't eat it all!

This was delicious!  I didn't have any soda crackers in the house, but I did have oyster crackers, so I used them.  When the chocolate melted a little I couldn't quite spread it on the oyster crackers, so I just stirred it all up.  Happy days - it was great!  I brought it in to work and it was gone in a flash.  I will definitely make this again!

Tried this today and it is DELICIOUS ! I used cinnamon graham crackers, dark brown sugar and cooked it and the butter on the stove until it was blended & bubbly and poured it over the graham crackers then shook a little bit of sea salt on top of that. It took about 14 minutes in the oven for the toffee to bubble. Took it out. Let it rest for a few minutes then tossed the chocolate bits on top, let them rest there for another few minutes, spread it, used chopped walnuts on top. Cooled for an hour or so in frig. - then cut the entire cookie sheet into bite sized pieces (it is rich!).  SO GOOD!

This recipe was sooooo awesome and simple! I followed the directions to a T except I didn't have a full cup of brown sugar so I added about 1/8 cup of white sugar. I used about one entire sleeve or pkg of saltines and had a little room left in the pan so I threw about 4 graham crackers on, since others had said they like that, too. I carefully microwaved per the directions; stirring every 30 seconds because someone else said that was very important. The butter/brown sugar recipe seemed to separate after nuking. I stirred and stirred but it didn't completely come together so I was a little worried. My oven runs quite hot so I lowered my temp to 325 and only baked for 12 mins. I saw it bubbling and didn't want it to burn so I took it out then. I was having trouble spreading my choc chips so I sprayed the back of a spatula and then was able to press/spread the chocolate more easily. I then sprinkled some macadamia nuts on top and placed in the fridge. When I broke the brittle a lot of the nuts fell off so I wished I had patted them down a little before refridgerating. Next time I'll know better! This was just so yummy and I really couldn't tell the difference between the grahams and saltines. Even my mom said it was super and she's super critical of everything! I'm going to make this as gifts because it's a guarantee homerun! Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!!

Delishisly addicting. Easy & fast to make if you have 15 minutes before people come over you can have them baking. They do slide like crazy though.. use a pan with edges.

Awesome!  Very easy too!!  I dipped each cracker in the sugar mixture to assure even coating.  I used 1 cup semi sweet and 1 cup milk choc chips.  Watch closely in the oven to be sure they don't overcook.  These hold up reallly well in the fridge for a couple weeks.  I tried a second batch with graham crackers- NO WAY!  The saltines are sooooo much better.

Fantastic simple tastey receipe!   I loved it.
However, the cooking time was only 7-8 minutes and starting to burn, so watch your time carefully.
Also, my pans warped in the oven making them uneven, so I had to turn them around half way through.  
I'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks

I make this exactly as written - so tempting! I can eat the whole batch myself...though definitely not at one sitting. It is VERY rich! A little goes a long way.

I just got a recipe like this today from a friend. It's a bit different but not much. Instead of a cookie sheet it called for a cake pan so therefore the measurements were a bit smaller. Her recipe also called for club crackers. I had to use some milk chocolate chips too as I didn't have enough semi sweet. We used cashews because they are our favorite. Cooked the butter and sugar on the stove to boiling and then continue cooking and stirring for 4 minutes. The baking time was only 8 minutes. If you gently press the nuts into your chocolate they won't fall off!!  I cannot believe how easy and delicious this is. Who ever thought of it originally is a genius.

YUMMY- whole family likes it, an easy, inexpensive treat!  Haven't tried graham crackers yet, but will!  We use less chocolate and sometimes none as the rest is really good without it.

Baked 11-13 minutes at 325 degrees F, so as to not burn them. Added extra pecans. Not bad, but something is missing...

I tried it a second time and added a little Nutella to the chocolate coating for a nuttier flavor, however with this batch I used vegetable oil spread instead of butter- DON'T DO IT. If you're like me and trying to cut calories in your cooking, I understand, but this recipe really needs butter. My brittle turned out gooey and like caramel that will forever be stuck in your teeth. If you do make the same mistake I did, store the brittle in the freezer in between indulgences! :]

I didn't really like this.  It's very sweet and the crackers inside seem to have absorbed the butter and are greasy.  It was easy to make, but I wouldn't do it again.  I also think the caramel needed to cook more before pouring over the crackers, I usually do it on the stove and I think that method works a lot better than the microwave, even if it takes longer.

This recipe is so easy and flexible.  Don't be afraid to use different crackers.  I have used graham crackers and saltines.  It always turns out great!  This is a wonderful addition to my Christmas cookie tin.  Thanks!

Next time I will stick to the recommended amount of chocolate. I added in even more chocolate with the "more the merrier" reasoning. Too much! Nobody complained, and they were all quickly devoured, but I could tell that a little less would have gone a long way. Lesson learned!

Overall, this recipe was good.  My best advice would be to make sure you use as many saltines as it takes to fill the pan.  I left gaps between mine and it was too sticky without the cracker.  The parts WITH the cracker were really yummy!  I will make this next year, but I'll make sure to not have any gaps!  Also, a lot of the pecans on top fell off when I broke this apart....so, unless you incorporate them into the sugar mixture, I wouldn't even bother with them!

Wow, this is one of the easiest things I've ever made, and it's so freaking good! I used walnuts and graham crackers, cooked butter/sugar on the stove, and cooked in the oven only maybe 7 minutes. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I used regular honey graham crackers, and no nuts (my kids won't eat them). I followed advice of others and only baked it 13 minutes. This is amazing... It will become a staple in our house.

Try parchment! I wet the pan with water so the parchment would stick to it better, and folded up the sides and put the (salted) saltines on that. Worked like a charm! I'm totally bringing these to a Chocolate Party tonight! Thanks!

Excellent. this recipe was given to me years ago but is the same as yours.  The only difference is I used salted saltines-It give it a contrast-salty/sweet and quite good. I also mixed my sugar and butter on the stove-top. I baked for 8-10. seemed that was plenty.

I made this for a party last night and everyone loved it. I baked mine for about 12-13 minutes and pulled it out when the brown sugar mixture was a dark golden brown. After taking the brown sugar/butter mixture out of the microwave, it took several minutes to stir the melted butter all the way into the brown sugar. Be sure to take the time to do this--it almost looked like a paste after I got all of the butter stirred in. If you still have butter floating on top, keep stirring. Can't wake to make these again!

I love this recipe! This is a great use for leftover Matza after Passover! I've never used the micro, I cook it on the stove top. Great with dark chocolate too-and I never use nuts. This recipe is pretty forgiving-you can be creative with it!

Oh! This is AMAZING!! I used graham crackers and ritz crackers...both are great-the graham crackers give it a sweeter taste, while the ritz make it a little more buttery. This is a keeper!!

I have really good bekers in my family & they raved about these so that's a compliment! I heated in the sauce pan on low instead of dealing with the microwave. I bought the pre-chopped walnuts(alot cheaper than pecans). Will make for many occasions. Freezes very well too. I used SALTED saltines. Thank you!!!**Don't forget to flatten lightly with your hand after you add walnuts so they don't all fall off when you cut & arrange them for serving.**

These are so rich, but SO good!  I used one whole sleeve of saltine crackers (37).  After I spread the chocolate, I put sliced almonds on half and chopped pecans on the other.  Took no time at all, and I know everyone that is getting some of these in their cookie tin are just going to love them!

Very Very Addicting!  I didn't have any version of a saltine cracker; I had plain graham crackers, Ritz (generic) round crackers, and had Vanilla Wafers which I thought would be a good mix.  All turned out yummy.  I'm a huge fan of salt/sweet combo, but didn't like the softness of the Ritz, so can't wait to try the Saltines.  The Vanilla Wafers I turned upside down on the cookie sheet, so the candy would stay on top easier. The Graham Crackers were delish!  I used a 2-cup pyrex measuring jug to melt the butter and brown sugar, and (following a hint by another reviewer) made sure the butter & b.sugar was mixed really well, then poured over the crackers... without too much "miss."  Putting the crackers as close together as possible is an easy fix, and dunking each cracker seems messier and more time consuming for this lazy-at-11pm-when-I-made-these-last-night baker ;-).  Following another hint I used semi-sweet & milk chocolate chips, and finely chopped the pecans, then smushed them as best I could into the chocolate with a potato masher. I set the timer for 13 minutes; it was bubbling at 10 minutes, but I wanted the candy to cook a bit longer... so pulled it out at 13 minutes, being careful not to let it burn.  I use an airbake cookie pan, which I've found great success with!  My husband didn't seem to be a big fan, but I just say More For Me! Thank You!!

For me, I found that it was too much toffee (Butter and sugar) to my liking.  So instead of pouring the butter-sugar mix, I brush them on top of each cracker by brush instead.  Because less butter and sugar, I left in the oven for only 8-10 min.  Then I spread chocolate on top of each cracker and decorated it with whole walnuts.  I think it looks better with the whole walnuts on top. Also, I didn't use microwave too because I was afraid that it'd explode and made too much mess.  I melt butter and sugar using saucepan in medium heat and kept stirring until smooth.  I used both soda crackers and graham cookies, have to say that I like texture of cookies better.  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!! This is sooooo good and soooo easy. I want to eat it all!! I cannot believe how easy this was. I did use 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup semi sweet, just to use up a bag of chips and still so good. I also used a 2oz bag of planters nut topping and it was just the right amount. This one is not just for holidays, I will be making this year round. Thank you so much for such a delicious and easy recipe... Also, as other user suggested, I only cooked for approx. 11 minutes and it came out perfect!!

YUMMY!  I made several different types of candy (including another toffee) and this one was by far the favorite!!  Very easy to make in comparison to other toffees and very tasty.  Used Saltine's and it turned out wonderful.  Will make these every year.

This was fast, easy and fabulous!  I have passed this recipe on at least a dozen times.  I actually tried this with Milk Chocolate and I think it taste just as good if not better(it's a matter of taste).  This is too good compared to how easy it is!

This stuff is sooo good! I tried it simply because I wondered what would happen to the crackers. It's better than a Heath candy bar. Really easy, simple ingredients, and totally addictive!

Very quick dessert/snack to make.  I am not sure what I did, but mine turned out quite greasy and thus very messy for the kids to handle and eat.  They are quite rich too.  Overall they were very tasty.  I intend on making them again, but I am thinking a quarter less of the recommended butter amount would be less messy in the end product.  :)

I used to make this years ago and forgot about it.  So glad I found a recipe for it once again, it's a great party treat and is gone before you know it.  Make sure the butter and sugar are really well blended otherwise the butter will pool and leave you with a greasy mess.

It would have been great if only my chocolate chips melted by just sprinkling them on after I pulled the pan out of the oven, which they didn't. Then I tried putting the pan back in the oven to soften the chocolate but the chips turned cakey. Next time I will melt the chocolate in the microwave.

I can't believe how good this is when it's so easy.  35 crackers is one sleeve and needs a cookie sheet that's 10" x 14."  Be sure to cover the butter when you microwave it or you'll be cleaning up butter for a very long time!  I like to use a whisk to really incorporate the brown sugar.  I have found the cooking time to be too long - 13 minutes works better for me.  Just make sure to use your nose; as soon as you smell anything resembling burnt, remove the sheet from the oven.  Like others have sad, remember to push the nuts into the melted chocolate so that they don't fall off as often.

I've been making this recipe for many years and it's always a huge hit.  I prefer to cook the butter and brown sugar mixture on top of the stove and that helps to cut the baking time down to 5 mins.
There are so many variations that can be made, such as white chocolate with crushed candy canes or with dried cranberries and chopped pistachios, various nuts, peanut butter chips, etc.  I've tried making them with graham crackers instead of the saltines and we found them to be WAY too sweet! Lastly, I pop the tray into the freezer to hurry the cooling along because my sons can't wait for them to cool before "taste-testing" them for me :)

this is easy and really good!  in case it helps - for step 3 (when you're microwaving and mixing), make sure after the last 30 seconds in microwave that you REALLY mix.  it may seem like the butter and sugar don't want to mix up, but they will, just make sure to keep at it til you get an even, smooth consistency.  Also - when putting foil on your cookie tray, try to create 'walls' at the sides... my brittle bubbled over and made a bit of a mess of the oven.  I used salted soda crackers and will only make it this way - a hint of salt with all that sugar and chocolate tastes fantastic!

This brittle is the best and easy to make - my son and grandchildren keep asking for more.  I did replace the soda crackers with Cinnamon Graham Crackers and loved it.  Be careful with the time in the oven - mine was done in 10 minutes and already bubbling.  It would have burned if I didn't check it early.  Otherwise, awesome recipe!

DELICIOUS!!! I made a mess of my oven though because the buttery sugar mix bubbled over and off the cookie sheet. I will try it again and use a dish instead.

Very simple, and very very delicious! My family now enjoys this treat regularly.  I made this for Christmas gifts last year and got lots of compliments.  I made it with white sugar one time when I was out of brown sugar and it still worked out great.  (The brown sugar is better though, if you have it).

if i could i would give these 4 1/2 stars... 5 for the taste (YUM!) and 4 for appearance.  all went well (and was super easy) until i reached the chocolate chip stage... even after two minutes of sitting on top the hot brittle they wouldn't spread easily. i ended up with a grainy looking top :(  i tried to pop them back in the oven but that didn't seem to help either.  *sigh*  next time i will either melt the chocolate first OR omit it all together...

I'm so ashamed I doubted AR reviewers - I continually thought to myself (while prepping) "these aren't going to work ... I just wasted a stick of butter...", Shame shame shame on me.  I used a small square baking sheet that came with my toaster oven which only held 20 crackers.  Used 1/2 cup each of butter & brown sugar and coated each cracker with a spoon (for fear of them turning soggy). Parchment paper on sheet -  Baked @ 350 for 8", then opened oven door for remaining 2'.  Turned off heat to oven and let the chips sit on top for apx a minute, then back into the still warm oven for a final minute.  They turned out nice and crispy with no burnt edges.  TYSM for recipe.

Let me be just another person to say I never would have tried this if it weren't for all the rave reviews--and I'm so glad I did! This is fast, easy, delicious, has almost no cleanup, and is so customizable!  I usually end up adding a bit more brown sugar, and I only leave them in the oven for 12-13 minutes (until the caramel starts to bubble) or else I sometimes get burned patches (not edible!) I've made these with white chocolate and green candy melts with crushed peppermint for Christmas parties, milk chocolate and sliced almonds for anniversary parties, swirled white and dark chocolate with peanuts on top for kid's parties--you can't go wrong with these!

When I saw this recipe, it struck a chord as something one of the moms at school baked for a bake sale that FLEW off the table.  I decided to try it.  OH MY HEAVENS!  It was as good as I remembered.  THANK YOU!!!

I was worried these wouldn't go over well as gifts for the girls at work. I had never made anything like this before and I thought "Saltines? Really?" But I did it anyway cuz it was easy. They were a hit! One girl polished off her whole container before we took lunch break!

I have made this recipe for years for passover.  I use unsalted matzoh, 1 cup of promise (my future mother in law is on a low cholesterol diet and the sub works), and I melt the chocolate to dizzle over the matzoh.  It's delicious.

This is absolutely amazing, but it must be kept refrigerated until use otherwise the butter/sugar mixture starts to get gooy and melts.  I think it taste better cold.  Like others the cooking time is way way off, it will only need about 8-10 minutes, especially in the newer model ovens b/c they cook much hotter. Definately check on it every few minutes. At first I didn't know what to look for and burnt the first batch. Look for it to be a light golden color and very bubbly.  The saltyness of the saltines is wonderful with the chocolate.

Was skeptical of the saltines/toffee combo- boy was i wrong!  My husband requested 2 more batches and even ate the bits in the pan after breaking.  As long as you follow directions, this is no fail.

Can't get over how such a simple recipe makes a candy delicious enough to give as gifts!  I just made up three batches in about an hour and I have enough for about 18 presents.  I put approx. 10 pieces in a cellophane bag, tied with ribbon and attached a personalized to/from sticker with our family holiday picture on it.  I used Club crackers as someone on here recommended, baked for 12-15 minutes, and it came out amazing!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

Wonderful!  Only took about 13 minute in my oven.  Turned out perfectly.  Tried a couple variations from other reviews and my favorite was milk chocolate chips with almonds.  Only used 1/2 cup nuts and it was perfect.  Mixed them in with the chocolate chips as suggested by another reviewer and it worked great.

I would have given it 4 stars because of the MESS it made, but everyone did love the final outcome which is why I had to give it the max.  A few things - 1.) After cooking the brown sugar and butter, I let it cool and thicken.  (I didn't do this on the first batch and it was a DISASTER - ran down into the bottom of the oven!) 2.) Use a tray with a "lip" or a "jellyroll pan" ... this helped keep the crackers in place and the sugar/butter mixture contained in the oven.  3.)  Graham crackers and Club crackers are thicker than soda crackers.  This helped.  The batch I made w/ soda crackers were soggy.   I did have to make a few times before figuring it all out, but the final outcome was a HIT!

beware of the baking time!  I did 345 for 17 minutes and I had a hint of burntness in the taste.  Also my crackers started swimming in the  brown sugar/butter mixture while baking :(  Dissapointed.

To Die For!  I followed the recipe exactly, except cooked the mixture in the oven for 15 minutes, and it was perfect!  I wouldn't double the topping; the actual recipe yields thin, crispy bites of heaven.  More topping would make it too rich, IMHO. If your brown sugar and butter are not combining well in the microwave, just keep stirring; they will combine by the end of the 2 minutes.  UPDATE: I made this again, and discovered that if you don't use a pan in which the crackers fit snugly, the sugar/butter base will spread too thin and may burn.

This is a good quick dessert and better with graham crackers as others have said.  In my oven it's ready in about 9 minutes.

Made it 1st time for work - 3 people asked for recipe.  My son ate half the tin - and it made a lot.  I didn't change a thing and even used salted saltines.  So easy and good.  I'm filling the Christmas tins with these and giving as gifts this season.  Cheap and good!

Made these for a bake sale.  When my husband trid them, he wanted to know if I would save him half.  I told him "no" you can buy them at the sale.  Guess I will put aside a couple for him to enjoy.  These are really, really good and so EASy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent recipe, it tastes fantastic! The only different thing I did was coarsely break the crackers, stir them into the mixture and spread them on the baking sheet. It turned out absolutely wonderful! Thank you ShanaLee!

Great, but I left it in the oven too long.  Do not let the crackers get too brown.  They will taste burnt.

Rated a 5 based on the easy factor. So easy, and oh-so-delicious. I was skeptical, but this delicious and easy dessert deserves it's high rank! I added heath pieces to the top instead of pecans and baked for around 12 minutes. The edge pieces were almost burned, so I removed them just at the right time and then stuck in the freezer for about 12 minutes instead of the fridge. (My husband doesn't do patient.) :)

These are sinful.  We couldnt stop eating them. I cut the baking time to about 10 min. just the sugar and butter bubbled.  After spreading the chocolate and sprinkling the nuts on top I just patted the nuts a little with my hand so they would stick in the chocolate but still were seen.

Oh...my....GOODNESS!  So easy but so good - reminds me of a Heath bar, or Almond Roca.  Would be excellent with any kind of nut or even without.  So addicting, it's like crack in food form!  WARNING!  I had to take it to work and get it outta my house because my husband and I could have eaten the entire pan by ourselves.  THANK YOU for sharing the recipe - it will be a Christmas plate and special event staple for us!

This is a great recipe. I only had 2 cups of Choclate chips on hand, and I needed two batches. I use half the chip in each batch, and it worked perfect. Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't the least bit impressed by these.  I have a huge sweet tooth but for good, quality desserts.  The topping on these was good but the cracker was wrong.  It tasted like a cheap immitation of what was supposed to be a homemade crunchy bottom layer.  It tasted like...a Saltine cracker.  They were also VERY greasy, which made them all the more unimpressive.  I can't believe I'm the first person to give these a negative review.  I did microwave the butter/sugar mixture for an additional 2 minutes to get past the point of separation.  I only baked them for 14 minutes.  They were done perfectly but still didn't taste great.

WOW!! I tried this as soon as I saw the pic.  Took advice of others and dipped the crackers and baked for 11 min.  This is really a keeper.  thanks.Update..I gave this recipe to several in my SS class at church.  At our Easter picnic 3 batches of this showed up..we had a good laugh and enjoyed them even more.

This turned out great! But nearly every time I make toffee my butter separates, and cooking in the microwave was no exception.  I think the people talking about it being "oily" or "greasy" might not realize their butter has separated. As soon as you see oil beginning to separate it is possible to quickly stir it back together, like I did. I've heard stirring in 1 TBS of VERY hot water can also help.

I have used this recipe multiple times using graham crackers instead of soda crackers. Everyone loves it! It is great to make and give as a gift. Like other reviewers, I also cut the oven time down - to about 10-12 min.  Flavored or regular grahams work well, and I have also experimented with swirling white-chocolate chips on top of the melted semi-sweet. It's a great recipe!

This was an incredibly easy recipe to make.  I used saltines and they were great!  It tastes a lot like a thin skor bar.  I forgot to grease the foil and it was hard to get it off, so be sure not to skip that step!  These were FABULOUS!

Tried it exactly; Except I gave it a shot with Brown sugar Splenda and you know what? They were delicious. Very rich. Be careful if you use the brown sugar splenda- it started smoking at about 9 minutes! Good luck!

So yummy!  Word of caution..I would cut the butter up a bit before microwaving for 2 mins...my butter exploded all over the microwave after about a minute.  Used 1 c milk chocolate and 1 c semi-sweet.  Also instead of soda crackers (aka saltines) I used honey graham crackers.  Baked for 8 mins only.

I took this to a fund-raiser for my son, people i don't even know were coming up to me, and asking me to get tehm the recipe, because they loved these sooo much. Instead of putting on a cookie sheet, I put in a 9x12 pan so that the butter and sugar mixture wouldn't get all over the oven. I plan on making this one very often

This recipe was sooo easy!! And sooo good!!I had to make a few changes but only because I didn't have exactly what the recipe called for. I used round butter crackers and half white half c. brown sugar and I only baked it for about 13 minutes as other members suggested. It turned out fantastic!

Quick, easy, and very good.  I used a mix of milk and semi-sweet to use up a couple open bags of choc. chips. The edges had a slight burnt taste, so I will use a shorter baking time on the next batch.  I used nut topping (a mixture of different chopped nuts) which turned out great and was much cheaper than pecans!  Thanks for sharing!

I heard about this recipe from a friend, and instead of using only milk chocolate chips, she uses 1 cup milk chocolate chips  and 1 cup butterscotch chips ~ a yummy twist !!

These are delicious and beautiful.  I may try using semi sweet chocolate, then drizzling the milk chocolate over it.  I thought it was perfect with the semi sweet - the only thing was the pecans did not stay in place nicely.  Thanks.

WOW!!!! This is an awesome recipe....My kids thought it was yucky the thought of crackers but when I had them try it, they loved it. I had to make them stop eating it. Don't tell your guest what's in it until they try it, they will be amazed. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, we like the smoother taste, also I would try it with almonds or pecans in the butter/sugar mixture next time.

Very easy and very tasty! Only comment I can add is that different microwaves cook differently...I had to add another 30 sec to the cooking time to get the brown sugar and butter to blend completely. Still ended up with a little extra butter in spots. Overall - a very easy and fast recipe with great results!

This is a tasty treat.  I made it twice, though, and both times the edges tasted burnt?  Probably just my oven. Will make again.

Wow!!  I heard about this from my sister who praised it. I however was Very skeptical about using crackers for candy.  I used saltines since my sister said it tasted better that way, and it came out tasting just like heath bars.  Yummy!

I love this recipe! My only variation is I use white sugar instead of brown. Brown makes it more of a toffee brittle and it's kind of chewy, while the white sugar makes it more crispy and crunchy.

Love this dish, it’s easy, popular and good for tons of variety—I’ve put crushed candy canes, candy corn, dried crasins, peanuts, sea salt and orange zest on it—good every time!! I would caution that I start checking at 10 minutes for the bubbling, it burns very fast

My husband wanted me to make this dessert, as I never heard of it before but his mom always made it.  It was a huge hit, he loves it.  My coworkers and friends enjoyed it.  I can't help but wonder if using saltines or large chunks of sea salt would make this stand out more.  The brittle is delicious but I think that dichotomy of salty and sweet would give it that extra oomph!

Well, so it's hard to write a review because I actually didn't like it.  By my guests absolutely loved it and I had to force my husband to stop eating it! Haha.  So I guess it was a hit.  This was a very simple recipe.  I would make it again.

This is a great little recipe if you're short on time and and not in the mood to bake.  This makes a good amount so it's perfect for a gathering.  If you like it sweet, you'll like this recipe.

I make this every year around the holidays and it goes quickly! I've used plain old Ritz crackers to regular store brand saltines and it is delicious every time! I have used semi-sweet, milk chocolate chips (although doesn't set as nicely), and dark chocolate too. Typically my family can do without the nuts but they're a nice addition also! This stuff is so easy to make, great with the kids, and even easier to eat!!!

This is an all time fave in our family!  But instead of microwave I cook on stovetop.  I find that the sugar and butter come together much better then zapping it.  Just a preference.  I use crushed walnuts  as well.

I made this recipe for my guy, but I left out the chocolate topping and made it with white chocolate. I know that makes it a bit different, but the ratios were perfect!! Great easy recipe that my boyfriend keeps asking for!

I was skeptical cuz of using,... what I call "Soup Crackers" in a candy recipe, but I  wanted a candy for Christmas besides my usual PB  & Coconut Bon Bons.   I was stoked!  I only changed a couple of things...I added pb & butterscotch chips to the semi sweet choc chips to the  2 different batches I made.... one w/chpt pecans & other w/almonds.  Omg!  My hubby, who only likes SOFT candy, cuz of his  teeth, LOVED it!!   I plan on making...& giving.... this great candy/cookie...away in cute lil tins & gift bags,...as b'day gifts during the rest of the year... as it's just too good to save only for Christmas!  Also, I plan on making some for Valentines Day & use crushed  peppermints instead of chopt nuts  on it & maybe  sprinkle some of those cute lil candy hearts u can buy @ the store in the cake decorating section!

Heck ya!! This one's a keeper for sure.  I followed the recipe as written but without the nuts (hubby doesn't like them) plus I used milk chocolate chips. I also suggest not baking as long as the recipe calls (maybe 13 - 15 min) It was fantastic! I could definitely see changing it up with different flavoured chips and crackers.  
Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is awesome! Simple but the results are impressive. I've topped them with chopped toasted almonds, which was delicious. My last batch I ran out of chocolate chips so used up a variety of leftover chocolate, chopped up. Worked great and received rave reviews.

I made it almost as written.  The only change I made was layering rows 5 x 8 since my pan was a bit larger.  It's absolutely addicting.  You'd never know crackers made this delectable treat.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great and easy recipe to add variety to the cookie tray!   Rather than pecans I use slivered almonds.   My mother used to make a recipe like this but much harder where she pressed dough into the cookie sheet., baked and then spread chocolate chips and almonds on top.

I made this treat exactly as written, omitting pecans as we prefer these without nuts at all.  Excellent recipe; however, I have a similar recipe that calls for graham crackers  as opposed to soda crackers.  I like this recipe; however, I prefer the graham cracker crust.  Sorry.

Just a heads up!! Baking time should only be NINE minutes according to my recipe. I boil my brown sugar and butter on the stove for 3 minutes so maybe that's why this recipe calls for longer baking time. Also, I have always used milk chocolate morsels not the semi sweet chocolate and Ritz crackers (my recipe calls for saltines but have never been brave enough to try). Everyone LOVES this treat!! My sister and I make it for the holidays and call it "Christmas Crack" LOL. BTW....I always hate when people rate and review and change up others' recipes. These are just suggestions and how I have made this for years : )

As good as regular toffee. I actually think the saltines cut some of the sweetness,  and make it easier on the teeth to eat. Who dosent love adding a very inexpensive ingredient to more costly ones to stretch them.

This was absolutely amazing and super easy to make.  After I removed the tray from the oven, I placed about five milk chocolate chips on each cracker.    Then using a spatula, I smoothed it out evenly.  And as others suggested I pressed the pecan pieces on each cracker in the chocolate to hold.  Once cooled in the freezer until the chocolate set, it was delish!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!! So good, I could see myself getting into trouble if I made these too often.  I had extra room on my sheet pan, so I used a whole package of crackers (about 42).  These turned out really good, I couldn't wait for the hour in the fridge to set up before tasting.

Love this recipe. With all the variations possible I can make five batches for cookie plates and they add great color.  For two years the guys at work practically try to buy ingredients to get me to make more.

This treat is delicious! I was a little unsure about how it would taste with the soda crackers, but they actually don't taste at all like crackers once they're cooked. Tastes like toffee-- so good!

This was my first brittle and I loved it. Flop proof and easy. My friends thought it was store bought.

Surprisingly super easy and fast to make with very little mess.  I accidentally left out the foil, but this worked well anyway - just twisted the cookie pan to loosen and dumped it out as a solid sheet onto foil after cooled.  Ddin't have soda crackers and thought salt would compliment the brittle nicely, so I used salted oyster crackers and they turned out very pleasing to the eye.  Mine were a deep caramel color and looked to be on the verge of burning after only 10 min.  In the end they are too buttery for my liking, which is why I gave them only 3 stars, but my boyfriend loves them and I like the texture quite a bit - might manipulate my old brittle recipe (which is unfortunately twice as complicated and 4x as messy) to inlucde oyster crackers next time and see how they turn out!  Thank you for sharing!

As soon as I read "1 cup of butter" I knew it would be good!  This was fast and tasty.  Certainly great for a quick little treat.  Used milk chocolate chips as it is our preference.  Very rich.

It must be me but I'm not loving this.  I was hoping to love it but that's not the case, it's good but not something I would crave.  I first tried it using ghee (clarified butter) but it didn't work.  The sugar melted but the butter never mixed in no matter how much I tried.  I then used regular butter and it was fast to get the caramel color.  I'll give this recipe another try when the holiday is near and see if my opinion changes.

This was pretty good, but the amount of the sugar syrup was not enough. I did 2.5 times as much to cover the crackers.

I am also one of the many who is glad I read the positive reviews and gave this weird-looking recipe a shot. It's fantastic! I even used some old matzah on the bottom when I ran out of crackers (which were salted and worked out fine) and it just gave the brittle some additional structure and crunch. This tastes like a Skor chocolate bar. I LOVED this one. Bravo!

These were easy, quick, and good. Couldn't find "unsalted soda crackers", so I used regular club crackers. Also, I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet due to personal preference.

Turned out good but not great, I baked for only 15 mins and it was still on the verge of being overdone, has a slight burnt taste to it, Not enough to throw it away but if i had done 17-20 mins this definately would have went in the garbage. I cooked the candy in a pyrex mesuring cup which made it easy to pour.

Fabulous! I made mine on graham crackers and did have to change the topping up a bit. I didn't have chocolate chips so instead I used a mixture of white choc chips and peanut butter chips. Delicious!

Super easy and delicious!  I almost always have these ingredients around so this will be a staple now for parties and might add to my Christmas baking.  I followed directions almost exactly. Left in oven for about 11 minutes and watched carefully.  Since I had semi sweet chocolate chunks,  I put the pan back in the oven for a minute or two after sprinkling them on since they were bigger.  Never thought saltines could be a base for something so yummy!  Thanks for a new favorite recipe !

These are a huge hit as a dessert/candy nibbler, definetly can't too eat much at one time though.  Use a baking dish with sides as otherwise they will bubble over into the oven (I learned the hard way). A bit greasy which I think is from spraying the dish first with Pam....any suggestions on this?

Excellent, though I did make a few changes.  I just used regular Saltines and I used milk chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and toffee bits over the top.  My family doesn't like nuts, so I left those out.  Great basic recipe, though, I know I'll be making these a lot!

I don't put the nuts on top and it is still wonderful!  Everyone always requests this recipe.  I have also made it using Hershey Peppermint Kisses instead of chocolate chips.  This was also a big hit!

This Chocolate Birttle was very easy to prepare and so yummy! I made these last night and they came out delicous! The only thing i suggest doing is watch them very carefully when you put them in your oven.  Since all ovens heat differently they could burn if you are not careful. My oven gets very hot so i took my brittle out after only 15 minutes.Also immediately after, i put the chocolate chips on and spread the chocolate, I topped with slivered almonds. They came out delicious!

This was so easy I thought it couldn't possibly be good, but needless to say, we munched on it all week long!  A fun and easy way to satisfy a baking/sweet craving without needing a lot of ingredients or making a big mess.

Outstanding! Very simple and quick. I used butter oil spray and baked about 13 min (it was turning from butter color to a rich brown, so I figured better get it out before it burns, as it warns.) Dropped the chocolate chips on, then put back in the oven for a minute - spread easier that way -then added the crushed pecans (pressing down on them to make stay.) Very well received and addicitve!

So easy!!  No one ever can believe these are simply made with crackers so they all have to flip them over to see the bottom.  I do prefer milk chocolate so I make these with melting wafers and often mix what kind of nut I use on top.  Try it with crushed candy canes too!!

Too much butter and it came out like caramel.  Instead, I did 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar over stove on medium heat for 3-4 minutes (don't let boil), and used 24 crackers in 9x13 pan.  I used dark chocolate.  Yummy!

I think I made 5 batches of this stuff for Christmas this year. I varied it for each batch. The favorite was to melt a 10oz bag of crushed heath candies and a half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also used white chips and crushed candy cane for one batch and that turned out well also! Thanks for a very easy brittle recipe ShanaLee!

Very addictive...I melted the brown sugar and butter on the stove.  Then I used dark chocolate and mint chips, plus the nuts and white chocolate chips for a very delicious treat. Bake for 10-12 min

These are surprisingly good- but extremely sweet so you can't eat to many (or shouldn't :-). While making them you don't really expect them to come out because it's a bit of a strange recipe (salted crackers topped with sweet ingredients and baked!) but they do!!! It's fun to make and break apart and into uneven shapes. A real crowd pleaser!

I used graham crackers like other reviewers suggested. I used dark chocolate chips and almonds on top. This was yummy. I would have given it 5 stars if the recipe had included some direction on temperature the sugar/butter mixture should reach in the oven. I removed mine from the oven a little too soon and it never set up completely. Next time, I'll do it on the stove, and wait until the mixture reaches maybe 250?? degrees and then pour it over the crackers.

This was pretty good.  I added sliced almonds and chopped pecans on top for some extra flavour.  For some reason, it was more difficult to make than I thought it would be.  I did have a couple issues in the kitchen though so I'm sure that didn't help.  All in all this is a solid recipe and would make this again.

So easy.  So easy.  So easy.  So good! I used graham crackers as suggested, halved the recipe and also baked for 13 minutes which was slightly too long.  Next time I will only cook it for 11 minutes.    I can't stop eating them!

I love this recipe.  I use Saltines, or the closest thing we have to that here in China.  Also, we don't have chocolate chips here, so I used the equivalent amount of a dark chocolate candy bar.      My oven is really small, so I put half of the saltines on a small cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and then did half of the butter and sugar to pour on top.  Then, when that was finished baking, I did the rest of the butter and sugar and then baked that one.  I found that 15 minutes was about right.  I put toasted almonds on one half, and toasted coconut on the other.  Any number of toppings would be great.  Easy and delicious!

Yummy! This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly how it was written.  I found that using parchment paper instead of foil works better.

I have been using allrecipes for a few years now but this is the first time I have rated a recipe. I found this recipe just before Thanksgiving and just put two more batches in the fridge to cool. My family loves this and it is sooo quick and easy to make, it nevers fails. Thanks so much for sharing.

So easy and so good. I did not follow the recipe and went by the reviews that said more butter and sugar. I think I would like it better with less and next time I will follow the recipe as written.

Although I have tried and kept several excellent recipes from this site, this is my first time to rate one.  I couldn't believe how AWESOME this recipe is and how easy it is to make.  I will be making this often.  It's definitely added to my list of Christmas goodies I make each year.

Awesome!  When I make this, I use salted saltines being that is what I always have on hand - and I prefer the taste of milk chocolate to semisweet.  This tastes like chocolate toffee, and is addictive!

Who knew something this quick and easy to make could be so good?! I did use graham crackers for my base though and milk chocolate since it was what I had on hand. The toffee mixture cooked up perfectly in the microwave. As long as you follow the instructions, there's no way you can go wrong with this one. But I did find I had to double the toffee mixture and initially some of it did seep under my graham crackers but it did not make the crackers soggy or anything bad. Very good, very delicious. I sprinkled with Christmas sprinkles to be festive and it looked so pretty. Thanks for sharing!

Great!  I, too, used salted crackers.  I made the easy recipe easier: I melted the butter and sugar, then added the chocolate chips, stirred until smooth,  AND added the broken crackers (about 50 in all)- mixed it all together, spread it out on a foil lined tray.  Didn't bother to spray the foil - not necessary.  The pan is in the fridge now and I've been sampling.  Delicious.  Will make again.

Pretty yummy! However, the bake time is WAY too long. I cut the time to about 10 minutes and the bottom was still burnt. I'll try it again and lessen the time in the oven even more, turn the oven down to 325 too, maybe until just bubbly. Thanks for the great tasting recipe!

Holy moly! This was very tasty and very easy. I put the crackers in 6x7 rows just to fill up the pan, but left the rest of the measurements the same, except eyeballing the chocolate chips. So yummy, and I had everything on hand. Just a note, I whisked the butter and brown sugar every 30 seconds, and cooked it for only 1 min 30 seconds as it smelled like it was about to burn. Keeping an eye on the power of your microwave and oven is a good idea. My oven runs hot so I cooked this batch for less than 10 minutes on 325. Gotta watch this stuff. Thank you for such a great recipe!

These are super sweet...too sweet for me.  But, with that being said, they are tasty and have a good flavor.  I sprinkled the top with chopped peanuts and sea salt.  I let me set in the fridge overnight.  When it came time for me to break it into pieces, the foil did stick to the bottom in some places, but it peeled off easily.

My grandma gave me this recipe - she called it Christmas Bark. You would never guess that the crackers are the base of this. You do have to watch it when cooking - there is a fine line between not cooked enough and overcooked.

Everyone loved this, but I am going to try combining semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips next time. I typically do that in choc. chip cookies too, so maybe it's just my personal affinity for that balance of almost too bitter and almost too sweet. Still, great recipe and sooooo easy to make!

Absolutely awesome.  I used lowfat cinnamon graham crackers instead of the crackers that were called for - - I LOVED it!  I omitted the nuts as I am not a fan.  These taste like Heath or Toffee candy bars!

Seriously, this was very easy and very good. I sent this to my child's end of the year party. After reading reviews, here's my opinion of what went wrong for some:you may need an extra minute or so in the microwave, use a whisk and keep blending the butter and sugar together, as it should resemble melted caramel. I tried both ways reviewers suggested, dipping or breaking the crackers up. I preferred breaking them up and mixing it together even though dipping them individually made for a thinner piece. It is definetly true that you will keep eating this!!!!!

This is sooooo good!  The only thing I did different is cutting back on the amount of chocolate chips as another reviewer suggested.  A+ for taste, basic ingredients and easy to prepare!

the recipe makes quite a bit brown sugar/butter mixture so more crackers can be used.  some of mine came out chewy and i couldnt break some apart so i would suggest only using enough mixture to cover the crackers and that's it.  (i used all the mixture and that was probably too much and make them chewy - just my guess).  i didnt have enough semisweet chips so is used mostly white chocolate chips and the taste was still great.  friends really thought the brittle was excellent.  i will make it again and hopefully have better success.  thanks for the recipe!

I have to admit, I was skeptical about using saltine crackers for this. However, they taste heavenly! Didn't change a thing about the recipe. I will make this for social events for sure!

This was awesome! So easy to make. My only recommendation is to keep it refrigerated as at room temperature it did get a little sticky and the chocolate topping soft.

This recipe is fantastic!!!  It's quick, easy, and uses ingredients that I usually have in my  kitchen.  No shopping necessary!  I was skeptical about how it would taste, but it was absolutely delicious!!  I used salted saltines and topped with chopped almonds. It may use cheap ingredients, but it is definitely fancy in flavor. Everyone loves it and wants the recipe!  Keep your eye on it while baking, though. Mine was done in only 8-10 minutes.

Great and easy.  I used what I had and I think this recipe is great because you CAN improvise.  I used:  graham crackers and I didn't have enough choc. chips so I used 1/2 white and 1/2 choc. chips - it turned out looking great.  I also read reviews and kept nuking and stirring the brown sugar and butter until it bubbled and wasn't separating any more.  Mine actually tasted better after it had set in the frig for a day.

This is great-- everybody loves it.  I didn't have a microwave, so I cooked the brown sugar and butter on the stove until it was combined and slightly bubbling.  Also, I used Cinnamon Graham crackers in lieu of soda crackers.   A big hit!

GREAT.! A bit hard on my teeth, but super candy anyway. I used 1/2 C. Butter & 1/2 C. margarine.  Single layer of saltine crackers on foil in a 9" X 13" cookie sheet. Baked 17 minutes until bubbling , but not burnt. We didn't have any choc chips so i used 1 1/2 C. Melting chocolate waffers. Melted them in the microwave then poured over cracker mixture , they worked Super great. Pressed the pecans into Choc. Placed in freezer 10 minutes, cracked Very easy.  Thanks for this recipe !

Great. Cheap. Addicting. Not sure why other reviewers would take the time and effort to dip the crackers.  I cooked my batches on sil-pats- you know, the silicone mats for jelly roll pans. Poured the microwaved butter/sugar over the crackers. 11 1/2 minutes--no convection.  Pressed nuts with the measuring cup per other reviews advice.  Why bother with brownies or cookies when you can make this yummy treats?

Heaven Sent!  This was so good, and so easy.  I went with the salted crackers, and even added some course Kosher salt as well.  I had a package of of pecan chips that I sprinkled on top (I think it was about 1/2 a cup).  This is what I will be giving as Christmas gifts to all of my neighbors.  Yum!

I was amazed at how easy this was!  I used Keebler Club crackers because I thought the rectangle shape would work well.  I also only baked it for about 10 minutes and that was definitely long enough.  I topped the melted chocoalte with chopped macadamian nuts and Christmas colored sprinkles and it looked great.  It was a little messy to break up into sections, but my husband was more than happy to eat all the scraps!  This makes a large batch and comes together so quickly that it's great for a last minute gift or to serve to guests.

This was very good. I made 1/2 batch with salted crackers and 1/2 batch of graham crackers. Some people liked the graham and some the saltines better. I did have to take it out after about 10 minutes because it started to burn.  After the chocolate was spresd I topped with crushed almonds. I also used part milk chocolate chips and part semi but I think I will use only milk in the future. Keep it in the fridge.

I bake weekly for my husbands company, so when I baked these I thought it would be an easy week for me baking wise, only hoping they turned out well.  Putting them together I thought My god I have messed this up but indeed it all came together in the end and when my husband came home he said "everyone says that is the best thing you have ever made!!!" ( go figure lol )  Hats off to this one!! SUPER EASY AND TERRIFIC TASTE !!!! I am so glad I sent them with my husband because I could have ate these all day too!

I love this.  I had to stop making it for a while because I would eat the whole thing myself in a few nights.  Don't cook the sugar mixture too long (I used the stovetop - my microwave can be funky sometimes) or it gets really chewy, like caramel.  But this is AWESOME!

Ooh...very good! I used salted crackers, and only baked for about 11 minutes...was bubbling but not burned to I took it out. I also probably got carried away and used about 2 and a half cups of chocolate chips...they set up in the fridge quick and taste like a cross between a chocolate covered pretzel and toffee candy. Thanks for a quick, easy, delicious recipe!!!

I loved thisd recipe as is and have made it many times. I will probably try it with milk chocolate since my kids like that better then semi-sweet that I prefer. No one ever knows it's made from crackers.

Just made this! It was AMAZING! I subsituted soda crackers for Matzohs I had around the house. The matzoh gave it a delicious taste and crunch! :) Can't wait to make it again.

Tastes like you spent hours making these!  Actually, most people don't believe me when I say I didn't buy them from a gourmet store!  I get asked to bring these everywhere.
The only change I made was using 1 cup of chocolate chips...I feel too makes them too chocolatey and takes away from the delish toffee.  One time I made them I realized too late I didn't have chocolate chips, but I had left over Turtles so I chopped them and used them instead and that was divine!  So don't be afraid to experiment with different chocolate toppings.

So would it be bad if I ate half this recipe in one night?  This is amazing and easier than any dessert I've ever made.  I baked it for 10 minutes as many suggeted and was perfect.  nex time will try with graham crackers like many suggested, but I did love the flavor of the saltines with it.

My son loved this treat!  I layed out the entire cookie sheet with crackers so the toppings seemed a little thin.  Next time I would double the amount of butter and sugar and chocolate chips.  Might even add some chopped walnuts.  Very tasty!

YUM!  I love this recipe.  I have been making this for years.  It's fast and easy.  When you think of crackers, you would think it would taste yucky, but you can't tell.  It's so yummy!

I just made this recipe and it was awsome. It actually tasted better the next day. I followed advice by other users and only baked for 10 minutes and also used Honey Graham Crackers instead of unsalted crackers. Next time I will use a little less Chocolate topping. Though I LOVE chocolate, it took away from the sweet/salty taste of the brittle. Definayly will be making this for family christmas gifts this year!!!

This was soooo good! My boyfriend couldn't believe it was made out of soup crackers. It really reminded me of a Skor chocolate bar.

I love making crunchy chocolate desserts, so I decided to try this one.  However, I didn't know what soda crackers were, so I just used graham crackers, and they turned out great!!! My whole family loved them!  I think next time I'll make more toffee, though.

Just like everyone else, I was skeptical about the crackers. I made this VERY simple recipe and it is just ABSOLUTELY wonderful!! No changes need to made at all! This is a favorite every time I am making treats!
