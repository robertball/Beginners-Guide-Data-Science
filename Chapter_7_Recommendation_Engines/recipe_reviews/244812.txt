Super moist, not too sweet and have great aroma! They seem to be the best muffins I have ever tried in my entire life! I used my Cuisine processor to grind almonds as I did not have almond meal on hand. Double the recipe if you have a family of four because the muffins will be gone in seconds. Thank you, Chef John!

These were awesome. I made them for my parents anniversary dinner and they loved them. They were super moist and flavorful.  I didn't have a mini muffin tin, so I just used a regular muffing tin and didn't fill them all the way. I also used strawberries instead of peaches because that was what I had.

These are so good!  I didn't think they would be with the small amount of fruit involved, but it's a Chef John recipe, and I've never made anything bad from him.  I had homemade almond paste on hand (made of blanched almonds and honey syrup) that I used instead of the almond meal, and I doubled the flour to balance things out.  The flavor, texture, and aroma are amazing!  I ate the whole batch by myself, so I will have to triple the recipe next time for sharing.

I gave this recipe a 4 1/2 because it was really exciting to make. The thing  is it tastes like sweet and eggy.

Did not want to do mini muffins so made big ones. They were delicious. The muffin gets a nice sugary crisp on it which is delicious. I will put in regular muffin tin next time and not fill all the way- that way I get a broad surface of crisp. Doubled recipe- did not double butter. Great for a tea party! Thanks Chef John

Followed recipe with the exception of substituting blueberries for peaches. Added just a dash of almond extract. Absolutely delicious!

great recipe for a quick sweet craving. all though could use a bit less sugar. also a tip: if you don’t have almond meal just replace it with all purpose flower.

Used gluten free flour instead of the wheat flour, but these were still *absolutely* delicious; definitely one of the top 2 gluten-free baked goods I've ever had. 

Only thing, *oof*, did *not* realize that these were supposed to be made in a MINI muffin tin. So, when I was filling the tin at first it only made like 3.5 financiers. I ended up redistributing and got 7 good-sized financiers, but I think in the future I'll just double the recipe =]

I doubled the recipe, except for the butter, and made them in regular muffin tins. 
This is the first time I successfully browned butter. When mixing, I didn't strain the butter and I turned out really well. So tasty!

(Note to self: add less sugar)

I love it.  I made it without the peach and it was delicious.  I was so excited when my son on law gave me the small rectangular silicone molds.  Will make it again and I will double the recipe for 24.  I like to try using ground pistachio instead.

I forgot to add the butter last time :( I made them. After making them correctly they’re very good. They’re like moist, tasty muffins. I had hoped for a more nutty texture but everyone loved them. Thank you for the recipe!

This was SO good! Very moist and was the perfect sweetness. I didn't have a mini muffin tin so I used my Madeleine pan and they turned out great! I could have ate ten if could. I would definitely make these again, thank you!

Followed recipe exactly. I didn't have mini muffin tins, but I did have silicone poop emoji molds (I have a 7 year old son- enough said). The silicone mold worked just fine and it turned out so so yummy!

Thanks to Chef John. Another 10 star dessert, and it is low carb! Note, I have to double the ingredients (except keep butter same) to make 12 muffin cups.

Oh my!!! This little gems are wonderful! I used ww pastry flour  instead of flour and added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract and for the fruit I used peaches and blueberries. Also it's 115 degrees outside and the last thing I wanted to do was heat up my kitchen by turning on the oven, so I used my electric Sunbeam mimi cupcake maker, but I'm sure they would've had been 10 x better had I made them in the oven.  Can't wait to make them again! Thanks chef Jhon,  hugs and kisses to you!

I am going to have to rate this based on taste... fabulous flavor!  Browned butter makes everything better!  Mine, however, did not come out as pretty... the peach pieces sunk into the batter.  Not sure what happened, maybe I over-whipped the egg whites?  (I used the carton)  My muffin tin yielded 15 instead of 12 and I used muffin cups for some of them- those looked prettier and came out of the tin easier! Anyway I love Chef John's collection of recipes but I might need a video for this one.

I hate to rate a recipe that I made a major change to, but these were yummy, I wanted the recipe to have another positive rating so it gets more attention. I didn't have almond meal on hand, so I subbed sweet potato flour. I think the magic of this recipe is the browned butter. When I make it again with almond meal, I'll re-rate, but I'm guessing it'll be 5 star.

I made these for some unexpected guests and they loved them.
I did make them in mini-mini cupcake pans, like cookie size.
Instead of fruit I used chocolate chunks, little pop-in-your-mouth YUM!
