I absolutely love wings of all varieties and smoked wings are at the top of my list. I use the Traeger for this very often and it's simple and so very yummy.

These were excellent! I smoked two different wing recipe's last weekend and they were both good but this one was my favorite. I wouldn't change a thing. I took the leftovers to work the next day and they held up nicely. I've smoked whole chickens and cornish in the past but never would have thought to smoke wings.  Hubby has made it clear that this recipe will be used every time we bust out the smoker and I agree. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is one of the best things I’ve smoked on the Big Green Egg! The best way to cook wing that I’ve found.
