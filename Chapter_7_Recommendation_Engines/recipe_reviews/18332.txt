This was the most terrible thing I have ever made. I did it in the oven instead and it tasted like flour.

This is super similar to a dish my mom used to make when I was a kid and I loved it.  I couldn't find her recipe so I used one to help me along.

I used yellow onion and fresh garlic which I sauteed first while boiling the spinach noodles I used 12oz). For the sour cream and cottage cheese I used 16oz tubs each. I added salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce and a couple dashes of tobasco sauce. Mixed that then added the cooked noodles. Greased a 9x13 and dumped it in. I topped with parmesan cheese and put it in the oven at 375. It's currently still in the oven but I seem to remember it taking 30-45 minutes. I would not recommend using the crock pot.

This wasn't bad by any means, but with the ingredients, I thought it would have much more flavor. To aid with the aforementioned sticking to the sides of the slow cooker, I thoroughly sprayed the sides and bottom, and sprayed again after I put the pasta and sauce into the slow cooker. Then midway through, I opened the lid (a no no, I know) and sprayed the sides a bit more. This actually made the sides brown up quite nicely and it was the tastiest part of the casserole, in my opinion! It didn't stick whatsoever.

We added parmesan on top, which helped, but next time I would play with the spices I added, and perhaps some fresh garlic and onion would help as well as parmesan all added to the sauce. I did make it slightly healthier by using nonfat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and spraying the pasta with cooking spray rather than mixing with oil. I also used nonfat cottage cheese.

I may add fat free cheddar and/or jack cheese to come up with a spin on mac and cheese, or perhaps even play with the idea of adding bbq shredded pork and cheddar to the mix. This is a great base to build upon.

I did not add the flour.   I browned onion, red and yellow peppers in the olive oil and added that to the mixture.  I added more of the mild hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I took a handful of cheese - combo package of asiago, romano, parmesan [grated combo from Sam’s that I always have on hand – Bel Gioioso] and added that to the mixture to thicken so that there was no flour taste.  I finished the mixture off with a small can of black chopped olives I had on hand.  I combined the sauce mixture in a large frying pan and cooked until everything was melted and mingled.  Added the sauce directly on top of the spinach noodles.  It was delicious and brought raves by all.
