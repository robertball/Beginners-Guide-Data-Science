I skipped the white flour and only used whole wheat and just made them drop biscuits (easier).  They aren't as pretty but taste just as good.

These biscuits are Great! To make them even more health, I substituted 1/4 cup of canola oil for the butter and low-fat buttermilk for the milk.  I measured the oil into a one cup size measuring cup and then filled it with buttermilk.  I then added additional buttermilk 1 tablespoon at a time (about 3 T) until it was moist enough stirring only until it was mixed. Since I used buttermilk, I also added 1/2 teaspoon soda and also eliminated the sugar.  They were so scrumpteous - crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  Will definitely be a keeper. Thanks.

These are great biscuits.  I was a little concerned with the stickiness of the dough other reviewers mentioned, so I added the milk a little at a time.  I ended up using the entire cup and the dough had the perfect consistency.  I can't see how the dough could be too sticky to work with unless the butter was too soft to begin with.  I was very pleased with the fluffiness of these biscuits, especially since they have whole wheat flour in them.  I think the key to the maintaining the light texture is to mix the dough just enough to combine.  Mixing any more will toughen the biscuits up.  These will be my go to biscuits from now on.  They are divine when brushed with melted butter and honey.

Used all whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp garlic and 3/4 c grated cheddar.  I'm making these all the time now, even w/ whole wheat flour they were so light and fluffly.  DO IT!!!

These were really great - happy to give them a 5 star rating. To make the dough, I used my food processor. This really made the job easy. I've now got a new biscuit recipe to use which I feel is healthier than my standard white biscuit recipe.

I always try to cook with wheat , but my biscuits have always been, well, bad. However this recipe was great! I used less white flour than it called for and they were still fluffy and PERFECT!

Great flavor for a whole wheat biscuit. I forgot to add the sugar but didn't miss it since it was eaten with butter and jam. I did use all whole wheat flour and upped the BP a 1/2 tsp, I also used shortning instead of the butter as it was all I had on hand. They were nice and fluffy, I was very surprised how nicely they rose. Make sure not to overwork the dough as they will become dense. I will be makeing these again.

These were some pretty good bisquits. I used all whole wheat flour but I probably should've added more baking powder to compensate for that because they did come out fluffy but not nearly as fluffy as the pictures showed. I will definetly make these again but I will just make sure to adjust the cooking time because mine were overdone and add more salt and baking powder. All in all though these are a fantastic substitution to regular bisquits... warm them with a little sugar free jam and you can't go wrong!

These are good and they are fluffy.  I used all whole wheat flour and added a little more milk to make them really wet.  A good biscuit tip I learned to make whole wheat biscuits rise higher is to have the dough be too wet to handle and the oven be really hot (450-475).  Then the steam makes the biscuits have more loft.  Just flour your hands and toss globs of dough in a bit of flour.  Then drop them in a buttered square pan (or a pie pan).  If you want drizzle melted butter over the top.  Bake as usual.  I try to put them on a lower shelf in the oven so they don't get too brown.

If you use all Whole Wheat pastry flour, no white flour, they are even fluffier and more tender.

These biscuits were light, fluffy, and delicious, with one change, and that was using shortening instead of butter, which I always use in my biscuit recipes, since it gives them that flaky, layered texture that a great biscuit should have.  This made 8 large biscuits that my kids, hubby and myself ate happily for breakfast with butter and jam!  I will definitely make these again!

These are fabulous rolled or dropped. I've found that a skosh more than 3/4 cup of milk works best for me. I can eat several of them straight off the baking sheet, no butter or anything. They're that fluffy and tasty. My go-to biscuit recipe.

The biscuits were good, I added a fourth 1/4 cup of honey to give a little more flavor.  Other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing:)

I used Kirkland brand unsweetened rice milk in place of milk for my lactose intolerant husband and vegetable shortening (1/4 cup) in place of the butter.  Then I took two unbaked biscuits (one on top of the other) and stuffed them with some fried ham, hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, and chesse and baked them in the oven for about 16 minutes.  They were bomb!  I'm going to make a bunch and stick them in the freezer!

A wonderful biscuit recipe!!! My family loves it and so do I. Whole wheat makes it healthy, but it tastes delicious all the same! You can use all white flour if you like. This dough is very sticky and sometimes not quite stiff enough to roll out when you finish. Just let it sit for five or ten minutes and it will stiffen up. Also, I have always found it easier to only roll out half the dough at a time, and to pat it out instead of roll it out.

Definitely not my most attractive-looking biscuits, but what they lacked in appearance (at least in comparison to some of the lovely biscuit photos that accompany this recipe), they made up for in taste. While mine were a little flat, the interior was soft, and as the title suggests, fluffy. Absolutely divine warm from the oven, with a pat of butter and drizzle of honey. I followed the recipe to the letter and yeah, the dough was a little sticky to work w/, but any homemade biscuit, difficulty in preparation aside, is better than the pop-the-can kind! Born, bred, and still a Southern gal, I love my biscuits, and I'm always happy to try a new one out.

I used 100% WHITE whole wheat and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  They turned out fantastic, high rising just like the photo.  Make sure to pack them in tight to the pan so they rise up instead of out!

I'll never make biscuits with shortening again! This recipe was perfect. I usually make the Angel Biscuits II from this site, but didn't have any yeast in the house. I chose this one because it looked easy and had high ratings. I made my biscuits using all-purpose flour and combined the butter and flour mixture in the food processor. Then emptied it into a bowl to stir in the milk. That was the only change I made to the recipe. This is the perfect recipe to use when I want a good old-fashioned downhome biscuit. And even though this recipe is very similar to the Alton Brown recipe, (and I've made both) this one is far superior. Thanks Ruth Ann.

Way better than expected and received rave reviews at dinner. A better quality baking powder would probably really make a difference as well.

Excellent recipe! These easy biscuits were so much fluffier than my usual recipe, and they are a little healthier. I'll be making these from now on. I premixed all the dry ingredients the night before and so just had to add the milk and butter in the morning and roll them out.

I LOVE this recipe! I would give it 6 stars if I could! If the dough is sticky, just add a little extra flour to the dough. Instead of the all-purpose flour and whole wheat, I use white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand). I like the taste better, plus it's only one flour I have to use so it's easier! Also, instead of the butter, I use 1/4 cup canola oil. I can tell no difference between the two. I have made the original recipe a billion times, as well as a orange biscuit version. I increased the sugar to a 1/4 cup, used OJ instead of milk, added about 2 tsp. orange zest, and baked the rest as follows. For an extra special touch I mix 1/2 cup powdered sugar and a little over 2 tsp. OJ and drizzle that over the biscuits. They are delicious! Hope that helps!

My family loved this recipe. I used the whole wheat version mentioned by others and used olive oil instead of the butter and 2% instead of whole milk = 1 cup of liquid. And used 1/2 tsp. baking soda...and no sugar....VERY good...the best i've ever made..thanks

These Biscuits are GREAT! My whole family loved them! I substituted a couple things though...I used all white wheat instead of half whole wheat and half white flour. They still turned out great though! I will definitely use this recipe again! :)

Loved this biscuits!  Doubled the recipe & added a little sprinkle of cream of tartar to make them even fluffier & wow...I was impressed.  I was expecting a denselike hockey puck, due to the amount of whole what flour.  Served them with potato leek soup and a salad...Yummy!

These are the most successful bicuits I've ever baked! No Kidding. I follow the original recipe except that I use the food processor as another reviewer mentioned. I get fluffy, soft and yummy biscuits that my whole family like. No more frozen biscuits around here!

Excellent recipe. I just finished making them. My two year old had one and asked for more. I used honey to replace the sugar. Also took the advice of other raters and used extra baking powder. Also added grated cheddar cheese and 1 tbsp of minced garlic...husband said "wow, these taste great"..Finally a whole wheat recipe that tastes great and are very fluffy!! Definitely a keeper!!

This is the first time I have had success with biscuits! 
Beautiful, fluffy and delicious! Looove the whole wheat... and took someone's advice and made them drop biscuits.... I think that for me this is the key so they don't have to be handled.. Awesome recipe! I will use it many times. Thanks!

Overall, good recipe.  I followed the measurements exactly and found the dough to be extremely gooey.  However, I rolled in enough extra flour on the cutting board to make it work.  The biscuits looked perfect.  My family of five voted an average score of 3.5.  It is hard to convince my kids of the more healthy whole wheat when they are used to the traditional white flour taste.

As some other reviewers suggested, I used all whole wheat flour and added an extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I also used vegetable oil instead of butter and made drop biscuits instead of rolling out the dough and using a biscuit cutter. Served warm with cherry compote, these biscuits are delicious!

For a biscuit with whole wheat flour this was really good.  The dough looks sticky but give it a minute and let the baking powder do its thing.  Just right to pat out.  I cut them at about an inch thick, maybe more next time since whole wheat flour just doesn't rise as well as white.

Awesome recipe!   I changed it a bit.  I only bake with whole sprouted grain flour so this was what I used instead.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 5 tsp of baking powder.  I only baked for 7 minutes and they were perfect!  Very light and fluffy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The biscuits were flavorful and very healthy. Used bread flour instead of all purpose, tablespoon of organic sugar, sea salt, and organic milk. Fantastic outcome. This recipe is a family favorite now. Easy to make and clean up.

I use this recipe as my go-to for a biscuit side-dish.  I even use it for dumplings in my chicken and dumplings.  However, I have discovered they come out better as biscuits if I use more butter.

I am very impressed by these biscuits!  I did add a tad more baking powder because  I used all whole wheat flour instead of half wheat and half white.  I have made these 3 times now and I just made a triple batch to freeze for quick baking.  Thanks!!!!

Just made this! DELICIOUS. I made it with only whole wheat flour and added the extra teaspoon of baking powder. I was amazed at how light and fluffy/tasteful these were. My husband gobbled them up. Will be making these all the time now. THANKS SO MUCH!

Fluffy and wonderful.  Made no changes at all to ingredients, kneaded in-bowl to save myself a mess, and patted lightly into 2" flattened balls instead of rolling out (again to save a mess) - worked GREAT!

These turned out really good and stayed moist.  They were tall, fluffy, with a very nice texture.  I used all whole wheat flour instead of half all purpose like the recipe called for. I was worried they would be heavy, but they weren't. Good recipe! I think the flavor could have been better somehow...They had the slight baking soda taste that homemade biscuits sometimes have. I am new to making biscuits though. I'll probably keep testing out more recipes to tweak the flavor.

These were perfect.  I added some corn meal for texture and used only whole wheat flour, and used heart-shaped bowls as cutters to make them.  They were so tasty!

Never making white flour biscuits again! I try to use whole wheat most of the time, but never did with biscuits because I thought they would taste like the ones my mom made growing up, which weren't terrible... but didn't rise much. These are delicious! I doubled the sugar (always do in whole wheat recipes) and used almost all whole wheat instead of half and half.

These are yummy! So moist and flaky, But I'm not a big fan of wheat, so I used two cups of flour. I also melted the butter instead of crumbling it in, Other then I give them a perfect ten!

Rich and fluffy! I use white whole wheat flour for the flours. Don't overmix!. Your biscuits will turn out tough if you do.  Mix just enough to get rid of clumps. These biscuits are great to make pizza sandwiches or served with a hearty soup.

I made these today to go with my turkey soup. They were very good. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used white flour and I also used shortening, rather than butter/margarine. These were tasty.

Yummy biscuitty flavor!  I was hoping for a little more 'fluff', whole wheat flour is more dense, these still turned out lighter than alot of whole wheat recipes I've tried.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice and both times they turned out amazing!  One thing to mention though, is to not over-mix or twist the biscuit/cookie cutter your using because it will make it not rise!!

Very good and easy.  I used olive oil instead of butter and made drop biscuits instead of rolling them out because my kitchen was already chaotic.  I will make these often.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is great for "pigs in a blanket". We cut the dough into triangles and wrapped each triangle around a kosher hot dog, then baked just as the recipe states. Next time we're going to try this with soy hot dogs.

Wonderful recipe!! I was looking for a whole wheat topping for a turkey pot pie and this was just the ticket! Followed the recipe exactly and the dough was fantastic. Light and tender even with a whole grain. Will definitely add this one to my "favorites"!

My dough was a sticky mess. I didn'twant to over-work the dough by adding in more flour so I did to do a drop biscuits instead. Good thing I was serving these with a chicken style stew on top for chicken and biscuits because these are tasteless.

I had some chicken and gravy left over from supper last night, so I decided to make some biscuits to finish it up at lunch time. These were fast and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and baked for 12 minutes. They aren't "light and fluffy" like regular biscuits because of the whole wheat flour, but I like whole grain bread, so I'll definitely make these again. My boys asked for a plain biscuit after they ate their lunch.

These turned out PERFECT! I would highly recommend this biscuit recipe to anyone who is trying to make the switch over to more whole grain baking. I haven't made anything yet with my whole wheat flour that my children (all 5) would actually eat AND enjoy. Uhhm, yeah, THIS recipe is the answer. It was easy, no changes needed to be made, and it tasted just like fresh bread! This has officially made the breakfast rotation at our home, and my family of 7 thanks you!!

While these biscuits say "Whole Wheat" they should say "Wheat". Whole wheat is when one uses ALL whole wheat flour. I used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 a tsp more of baking powder and these turned out great!! The family gobbled them up.

very good taste but somehow they didn't rise much at all.  I think I either shouldn't have kneaded at all or should have needed more.  Will also play around with baking soda.

Wow. These are amazing! I love love love healthy eating, but my family doesn't and they liked this recipe. It's a keeper. I did make quite a few changes though. 
I used all wheat flour. I used coconut sugar instead a regular sugar. I used 1/4 teaspoon sea salt instead of regular 3/4 teaspoon salt. And I used coconut oil mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of honey instead of butter. They were yummy! Using jam and honey was great. This is going in my recipe box forever, thanks!

Made this recipe for dinner to serve with Chicken a la King by Colleen on this site.  They turned out great.  Only change I made was to use 2 cups of whole wheat flour and sour milk.  Didn't over mix them when I added the milk and they were so easy to handle.  Now I'm afraid hubby will want them Sunday mornings instead of the frozen biscuits he always fixes.  He loved them.  There are about 5 left so we will eat them for breakfast.  
Thanks for the great recipe Ruth Ann.  It is definitely a keeper.

I make a batch or two every week of these biscuits for my boyfriend, who absolutely loves them. The only difference is that I bake at 425 for 11 minutes, and the come out just they way he loves them... I will make these all the time.

An excellent alternative if shortening is not available. I skipped rolling out the dough and shaped the biscuits in my hands. They came out great. Wonderful with sausage and gravy (use Bob Evans recipe on the package).

This Alberta girl had to try a fellow Albertan's recipe. These were wonderful. I used all ww flour and brushed the top with melted margarine before baking which I now think was not necessary.  Make sure your baking powder us fresh and do not roll too thin and they will tender and fluffy. We loved them.

Great recipe.  I varied the recipe by using 1/2 cup of greek non-fat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup of low fat milk, used butter and other same ingredients.  Before adding milk, mix yogurt into milk until well blended, then pour liquid into drys.  Biscuits turned out great and they tasted amazing.

Fluffy and yummy!  I did the variation of all whole wheat flour, 1 t garlic powder and cheese.  I didn't have all cheddar so I mixed it with parmesan.  It added the right touch to a meal of reheated stew.  I did drop biscuits shaped with a large spoon to save time.

I have been making this recipe for a while now and now make it with 1.5 cups regular flour and .5 cup whole wheat flour. (personal preference)  Also I have been folding in the dry mixture with the milk only enough to moisten the dry mix and don't knead the dough at all.   I carefully place the goopy mixture onto a heavily floured surface and pat it down (no rolling pin) to 3/4" thickness with heavily floured hands. (you will need the flour because the mixture should be too wet to touch otherwise)  Also I use a knife and cut rectangular shapes instead of a cookie cutter. I do this because I have found a tougher dough from over kneading is "sealed shut" at the edges and wont allow the biscuits to rise and be as fluffy.

These were wonderful fresh out of the oven, but didn't save very well. Became very dry within just an hour or so out of the oven. Probably because of how dense the whole wheat flour is. I will definitely make these again, but will cut the recipe in half to ensure we don't have any leftover.

I did not find these fluffy or very good.  I will note that I had trouble cutting the butter in evenly, and perhaps that was part of the problem, but I am going to keep looking for a whole wheat biscuit recipe.

Dough was indeed sticky. Kneading with a lot of flour was necessary. Might try adding less milk: I did not need the entire cup, and actually should have stopped (3/4 cup) before I added all that I did (not quite the whole cup). Good flavor if you like whole wheat and very tender dough. This made 16 small biscuits (2 inch biscuit cutter). Next time might try honey instead of the sugar to go with the whole wheat. I baked in melted butter (2 T)

Very, very good.  I noticed this did not call for any baking soda and it freaked me out so I added 2 teaspoons.  After tasting them, I decided they would be super awesome w/some sauteed onion, bacon and cheese mixed in so I'll try that next time!

I used this as a basis for jumping on the bacon & maple bandwagon. I added 4 strips of crumbled bacon, sub'ed maple syrup for the sugar and 1 tbsp bacon fat for the butter. Also cut back the butter just a bit. Used 1 1/2 c. white wheat flour & 1/2 cup white flour, and skim milk. Topped with a bit of maple icing. They were great and fluffy like the name says. Will make again with other flavorings.

I had a craving for biscuits and wanted something quick but satisfying and this did the trick.  The only thing I would change next time is to add less milk.  1 cup made the dough very sticky and I had to add a lot of flour to be able to roll it out.

I made these to go with the Crustless Spinach Quiche from this website.  I halved the recipe and just made them into drop biscuits.  It made 8 good sized drop biscuits.  I made a little honey butter and served it with that.  Tasty!!!!!

Our family really likes these.  We are used to whole wheat breads, so we think they taste better than biscuits made with all-purpose flour.  I use all whole wheat flour, add one teaspoon of baking powder and omit the sugar since we don't like sweet biscuits.  Also, I usually put a bit of vinegar in the milk to make it like buttermilk, and I just pour in the milk until the consistency is right.  I don't usually use the full cup, but I live in a humid area so that may be why.  Very delicious!

This is a very delicious and light biscuit.  I did make a couple changes though.  I added 3-4 tablespoons of buttermilk powder and just enough water to bring it to the right consistency, which was just a little less than 1 cup.  I mixed everything in the food processor using the pulsing, and finished off by kneading a couple times on a floured board.  The secret is to incorporate all the ingredients until just moistened.

My family loves these!  They mix up quickly so I can make them anytime.  I roll them out into a rectangle, skip the biscuit cutter and just cut them into squares.  It's easier and I don't have to deal with biscuit dough scraps.

These were good!  I was surprised at how quickly I was able to make them.  I would have given this 5 stars, but as I ate them, I noticed a slight "tingly" sensation on my tongue; the only reason I could think of was because of the 4 teaspoons of baking powder.  I would make these again; maybe if I ate them with something (instead of just butter and jam) I wouldn't notice the tingle!  Thank you for sharing!

I'd been looking for a fluffy whole wheat biscuit recipe for awhile. I did make some changes. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour. I don't know why you'd put all purpose flour in. You don't need it. 1 cup of milk was WAY too much. The dough was super soggy! Gross! I  had to add about 1/2 a cup of flour back in when kneading the dough. I got 11 biscuits, and I made them 1 1/2 inch thick. They turned out fluffy and yummy! I brushed the biscuits with margarine as soon as I took them out of the oven. Once they cooled enough to touch, I cut them in half, spread margarine on each half and drizzled with honey. Mmm! I'll be making these for dinner when family come to visit.

These biscuits are wonderful!  My family loves biscuits, but only gets them when my mom visits, because I just can't seem to get them right...until now!  I am so happy to find this easy, fluffy, healthy biscuit recipe!  My husband isn't a big whole wheat fan, but even he loved these!!  Try them, you'll be happy you did!

Perfect biscuits, and so easy to make.  Kids ate them with blueberry jam inside.  Used all whole wheat flour, added one extra tablespoon of sugar.  Used stand mixer with kneading attachment.  All dry ingredients were stirred before I used a knife to cut off thin slices of butter directly into bowl while it mixed.  Waited for small crumbs to form (took a while), then very slowly added exactly 1C cold milk.  Very quickly the mixture became a perfect consistency.  A little sticky, solved as soon as I threw it onto a floured board to knead 8 times, then formed a cylinder.  Divided into 12 biscuits: Using a sharp knife, cut full length in half, then each half into halves, then each of these quarters into thirds.  These thirds were almost round, so re-formed them into circles by reshaping the edges.  Baked them with 1T butter 1T honey mixture brushed onto the tops.  Done after only 8.5 minutes in 415F Convection oven.  Incredibly fluffy and moist with a crust.  Fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

The taste was great and the texture soft & fluffy.  However, in spite of using cold stick margarine (butter isn't on DH's diet) and cold milk, the dough was very sticky.  I made drop biscuits using a medium scoop.  Next time I would reduce the milk to 3/4 cup.

WOW! These biscuits are really good! I can hardly taste the whole wheat in them! They always rise well(although I add a little extra baking powder), and are perfect warm with butter. Thanks!

Great, but like other reviewers stated, I haven't found a way to use the entire amount of milk and not have to add more flour.  This last time I used approx. 3/4 cup of milk and they came out great.

I have to say first that I have been making biscuits for just a short time now, but everytime I make a different recipe, they come out like rocks. Flat
rocks. I have tried them all. Tonight, I tried this one. I will never try another one ever again. These biscuits came out fluffy, soft, and tasty. I can't believe I finally did it. They are so easy too!!!
Love them.

This was the first time I had made any sort of biscuit or bread.  Baking just isn't my thing.  But these were SO easy to make and they came out great.  The key is to mix just until moistened then fold 8 times just like the directions say.  I used a tall glass to roll it out and to cut the biscuits.  But they tasted great.  And I even forgot the sugar.  Will make these again and again!

My kids wanted biscuits and I refuse to make the traditional "unhealthy" variety. These are the perfect solution. They love them and I'm happy to see them gobble them up. I followed another reviewers suggestion to use shortening (non-hydrogenated vegetable!) instead of butter to lighten them up. Works great! Will double the batch next time!

These are so delicious! Also, it was pretty easy to make and I was able to roll them out and use a glass as a biscuit cutter so they looked divine at the end. The whole wheat taste is awesome!

Thanks Much! Have made twice in a few days. Like the fact that they are so quick to make. Used all whole wheat flour and olive oil instead of butter, also a pinch more sugar and salt. Perfect biscuits that are quite healthy too.

Good recipe. I used all WW flour, and canola oil instead of butter. Made drop biscuits. Simple and tasty, and they can be modified however you like (cheese, spices, etc.).

Finally, delicious biscuits without the shortening! (And whole wheat flour to boot.) I didn't think mine would turn out as "fluffy" as those shown in the photo, but they did! We will be making these A LOT!

I was doubtful that mine would look as fluffy as those in the picture (especially after reading some of these reviews) but they turned out beautifully! I followed the recipe exactly and they were fluffy and soft.

I have never written a review before but I had to comment!  This is a great recipe! The dough was so soft and easy the dough was to work with!  I did, by mishap, use a bit more shortening and bit less milk.

My kids enjoyed them too!

Thanks for the recipe!

Great taste...the biscuits were a little crumbly, but a wonderful healthy alternative to white biscuits.  The second time I made them, I added a Tbls. of honey instead of sugar.

Have made these twice once as written and once with buttermilk both times they were great; secret is not to handle the dough too much. Brushed with melted butter when removed from the oven, never any leftovers in our family of six.

Everything you want from a recipe, yummy, easy and simple! I loved these and ended up eating them for dessert the night I made them. Sweet enough for a treat and savory enough for a main meal side. I have now used this as biscuits for strawberry biscuits as well as for breakfast biscuits.

This recipe turned out really well for me. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I think in order to get a good size, you need to keep the dough pretty thick when you roll it out. I think that half the recipe would have been perfect for about 4 biscuits. 

I followed the ingredients exactly, using unsalted butter and skim milk. 

I will definitely make these again.

These weren't bad with blackberry jam, but I really wasn't too impressed with them by themselves. I used skim milk and oil instead of the butter, so that may have had something to do with it.

I have never written a review before, however, I felt compelled to write this one.  I am sitting eating my fluffy w w biscuit with my homemade bourbon,vanilla peach jam and the biscuit is ok, but I can't believe that noone (on the first page anyway) has said anything about the milk!!!!! Yikes, 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk!!! The dough was swimming and I had to add another cup of flour, the biscuits are a little doughy still.   I  went to the Taste of Home actual recipe and the 1st review said "don't add the whole cup of milk, they also needed to add a cup more of flour.  A few other recipes I have looked at call for 3 cups of flour & 1 cup of milk. These didn't really turn out as I had hoped with all of the rave reviews.

These are really beautiful. I've made these on several occasions, with the whole wheat flour and without. You really don't much notice the whole wheat in them. They're fluffy and so wonderful with butter served with a nice stew.

These whole wheat bisquits were fantanstic, I do not care if I ever have bisquits made with just white flour again....I followed everything the way it was written, next time I am going to try more whole wheat .... I love the whole wheat taste in them.

My dough just wasn't working for me so I ended up having to do drop biscuits.  The flavor was good so I'm going to try them again, for sure.

I used only whole wheat as well, and threw in a little nutritional yeast (maybe a 1/4 c.) to give it a different flavour. Très bien.

These were very good! I halved the recipe as I was cooking only for two. I left them in the oven for 12 minutes and they were slightly burnt on the bottom but they were still super fluffy on the inside! Next time I will bake for 9-10 minutes. Thanks for this recipe Ruth!

These are great! I followed another reviewer's advice and replaced the sugar with honey and used only whole wheat flour. The texture and taste are wonderful and they're really very easy to make.

These are great!  I went on the advice of another reviewer and used all whole wheat flour, they turned out delicious for me.  This is definitely a keeper.  Try them with buttermilk for a nice change, too.

So easy and so good.  This was my first time making homemade biscuits, and while I was trying to find a recipe that didn't call for too much butter and was a little healthier than your typical biscuit, I found this one.  These rose up beautifully, and were fluffy and tender.  They were perfect for our sausage gravy this morning.

I didn't change anything other than I don't have a biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter so I used the end of a drinking glass which worked great.  The dough did come out sticky for me too, but I just used lots of flour when kneading.  I'm thinking about adding honey next time, or maybe I'll just put honey on the finished product, either way, these are perfect.

We've tried this recipe 3 times now.  The first time was as written.  The result was a biscuit that tasted like baking powder.  The second time we reduced the baking powder to 3 teaspoons (from 4) and still the biscuit was overwhelmed.  The third time, we increased all ingredients by half (so we made 1.5 recipe).  All except the baking powder, that is.  Instead we decreased the baking soda to 3 teaspoons, when it should have been 6.  Finally, the biscuit was not overwhelmed by baking soda.    Milk-The recipe, as is, calls for 1 cup of milk.  The first two times, we only added 1/2 cup of milk before it was a good consistency.  The third time, because we changed it, the recipe called for 1.5 cups milk.  We only put in 1 cup.  So, for milk, think 2/3 of what this recipe calls for!  The 3rd time, the dough was very wet and DH had to keep flouring his hands but the result was a not dry and absolutely delicious biscuit.  We don't have whole wheat flour (can't find it here!), so we just use All- purpose flour.  We used this recipe to help us make Uglies (found on allrecipes).  Making a recipe & a half, made 12 uglies and 6 smallish biscuits.

These biscuits were amazing! They didn't tas like flour, which is greatly appreciated. I only put 3/4 cups of milk because one whole cup looked like it was too much. Overall really good recipe that I will use again! Thanks!

Made them vegan by substituting Earth Balance buttery spread and rice milk.  No need for me to buy ready-made when these are so simple, easy and quick to whip up a batch!  Thanks!  :)

These were dee-licious!  I made them using 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour, which is softer and milder than regular ww flour.  I added an extra tsp of bkg powder to compensate for using all whole wheat.  I dropped the dough onto my ungreased stonewear pan and baked for 11 minutes.  They were soft and fluffy and my kids ate them all up like they were cookies!

i have a couple of cheese lovers at my hours.  i added a little less than 1/4 cup of butter and added about a cup of asiago.  i whizzed it all up in the food processor and transferred the dry ingredients into a bowl and added the milk.  in spite of me not owning a biscuit cutter, the biscuits turned out beautifully (i used a glass)!  i can't wait to try a new variation on this great recipe.

I made these with 2 c. whole wheat flour only and substituted the butter for 1/4 c. applesauce.  They turned out a little dry and pretty dense.  Although they didn't have too much more flavor than wheat bread, hubby and son loved them with a pad of butter in the middle.  I am thrilled to be able to eat a biscuit guilt-free!  I'm going to try this recipe as a bread loaf.

Thanks a bunch, fellow Canadian, Ruth Ann! These bisquits were easy to make and GOOD.  I used the food processor to cut in the butter, but make sure it is cold.  Also if the dough gets a little sticky I just flour my hands.  Mae twice:  once with garlic powder and the second with cinnamon.  Fun to add flavouring as others have suggested. I've made them twice

I've made them twice. I slowly add the milk and just knead the dough with a spoon in the bowl. Then I just drop them and shape them to biscuit size. My boyfriend loves them and devours more than he realizes. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent biscuits!  They were very light and I really liked the taste.  Not at all greasy like traditional biscuits - which made me like them even more.

Great bisciuts and easy to make. Light and fluffy, made them even healthier by substituing canola oil for the butter and they were still good so I know this recipe is a keeper.

WOW! I didn't expect to like these as much as I did. Fluffy, great texture, and a nice whole wheat taste! I made a batch of these to go with a pot of soup, and they were gone before the soup was!

Did exactly as recipe says, with the exception of subbing buttermilk for the milk. Never had a bad buttermilk biscuit until I tired these! Flavor was like a cardboard box, but they did have a nice consistency i'll give it that. They're edible with butter and honey on them, but I won't be making again unless I have a craving for bland.  What a shame, I was hoping they would be a winner.

These are pretty good. I definitely don't think they are as good as real buttermilk biscuits, but they are a good whole wheat alternative. I made them into drop biscuits because they were way too sticky to work with any other way. I suggest making some honey butter to go along with them.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used a 1 tablespoon of honey instead of sugar.  Paired this up with a bowl of corn chowder on a winter's night.  Thank you for the great recipe.

These biscuits are amazing! So buttery & moist, perfect on their own or with honey butter or gravy. Make sure not to over-knead the dough or they won't be as "fluffy."

I used two cups of all purpose for this instead of the whole wheat. They turned out perfect! They were the best biscuits I've ever had! And I don't even like biscuits. But I'd happily make these over and over they're just so good.

I followed the recipe as given and was very happy with the result. They weren't as fluffy as the picture, but I blame this on my own novice biscuit-making skills. The family loved them and the taste was amazing. I will make them again.

I messed these up the first time I attempted them but the second time, they were fantastic. Here are the modifications I made: I used all whole wheat flour, used partially diluted condensed milk (as opposed to regular milk or fully diluted condensed milk), added some garlic powder to the mix and made drop cookies, as my margarine was a little melted and the dough was soft and sticky. I was worried this would be a problem but they still turned out amazingly fluffy and delicious.

Pretty good, very easy. I agree that the dough is a too sticky if you add all the milk (I ended up just ripping off sections to bake as the dough was too sticky to roll out well). These are very quick though, and fairly light.

LOVED these biscuits!  I'd never made biscuits before, and these were delicious.  First I tried them as drop biscuits and really didn't like the consistency so I rolled out the rest and they were like a dream!  Baked at 11min gave them a firm exterior and a perfect, warm, soft interior.  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe as written, but found the dough very sticky. It took almost another cup of flour to get it to the point where it could be rolled. The resulting biscuits were good, but dense, not fluffy. Will give them another try, though, and maybe up my rating if I get better results.

These were good. I usually use canned dough because I'm not much of a bread baker, but I was able to make these with no troubles and they were tasty. I might add more butter next time though. Oh, and I didn't have wheat flour, so I used all white flour.

I have come back to this recipe again and again. I have to be honest, though. I often skip the kneading and just make these as drop biscuits. They may come out a bit less fluffy, but they're still great. Serve warm with butter and honey.

K, so I must have done something wrong because they came out very flat and hard. But I will try to make them again.

These are great.  Sometimes I make them using only whole wheat and they turn out great then too.  I make enough for leftovers; I slice them up and pop them in the toaster, then cover them with sandwich fillings (e.g., deviled ham).  They are also great split and put under the broiler with cheese and tomato.

This is the best biscuit recipe I've found so far and I've suffered through a lot of biscuit recipes. To simplify the cutting, I just rolled the dough into a 2 1/2 inch log and then just sliced the log into 12 biscuits.  I used only unbleached white flour (was out of whole wheat), mixed in some grated cheddar cheese, and baked them in an cast-iron skillet. They turned out great! I like baking with cast-iron because it provides even, consistent heat.

Very simple. I used buttermilk and brushed the tops with a little buttermilk before baking. I plan on using these as a base for my Creamed Eggs on Toast tomorrow morning.

I have never made biscuits before and I was looking for something to go with some leftover smoked turkey. I liked the idea that these were whole wheat so I gave them a shot and must say I was impressed.  I thought biscuits took so much more work than this, these were so simple!  I did as another reviewer did and added a tsp of minced garlic and 3/4 a cup of shredded cheddar and I was pleased with the taste. However next time I will use all whole wheat flour and up the baking powder as suggested, and add 1 cup of shredded cheddar and 1 tbsp of minced garlic, just for that extra shot of flavor.  Very fluffy.  I think I worked my dough too much bc I think they should have been a bit fluffier and used way too much flour on my floured surface, my biscuits were dusty!  Will make again.

My milk was off, so I used 3/4 cups of water instead, and the still biscuits came out great! I cut half of the dough with 1-inch cookie cutters, and these cooked within 4 minutes.

I give the 3* based on the fact I only made them once...I will try again, but here was my problem.  I added in the milk slowly like suggested, and then realized I did need the whole cup.  The only problem was that instead of adding more milk like I needed I forced it together by kneading it to much (I think) and so they turned out more like round disks then they did fluffy biscuits.  I will try to make them one more time and see how that goes, but this time around they didn't look pretty and only tasted good crumbled in soup.

These biscuits came out fantastic! I didn't change a single ingredient and they were delicious.   Currently, I only have a toaster oven, which can be tricky for baking.  This time I set the oven to 1000W, and preheated for 10 min.  Then, put in the biscuits and baked for 7 minutes, turned the tray, brushed on some butter and cooked for seven more. They came out golden and fluffy, just like from a regular oven!  Thanks for the recipe! October 2009 Update: Try these with 1/4 cup flaxseed oil substituted for the butter.  They don't turn golden in the same way, but the flavor is to die for and healthy too! (great way to get Omega 3's without eating fish!).

I followed another review and used all whole wheat flour, olive oil and buttermilk in replacement.  I also added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  They taste great!  Next time I roll them to 1 inch so they raise higher.

These were pretty good.  Very quick, but lacked a little in flavor, however everyone can change it to their own tastes.  I made 1 1/2 of the recipe, using 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour, and 1 1/4 bread flour.  Added in some triple cheddar shredded cheese but maybe not enough.  Also, didn't roll them out but made them drop biscuits.  Everyone loved them, but again still needed more flavor.  Will make again for sure!!  

****Made again the other night, doubled the recipe and they were awesome!!  I added more shredded cheese, chopped garlic and some italian seasoning.  They went over so much better than the first batch.  They were so light and tasty!!***

I used this biscuit dough in a chicken and dumplings recipe from this site and they held up great.  Next time I will make them as regular biscuits.  I have no doubt they will be just as delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Made a trash bag full of them to take on a camping trip.  They hold up very well for at least four days (probably longer, but they were all eaten).  Although if your going to travel with them I'd probably bake them a little shorter time to leave some more moisture in them, by the fourth day they were starting to taste a little dry.

I did as others suggested and substituted olive oil for the butter. Only four stars because for some reason the dough turned out so sticky I couldn't roll them out, but they still tasted great as dropped biscuits.

I really loved how these biscuits turned out.  I found the dough to be a little sticky so I added flour so I could knead it. They rose in the oven very nicely. They had wonderful texture and tasted great.  My whole family liked them.

These are awesome!  My husband who loves the traditional shortening/white flour biscuits even approves!  I found these when I was looking for some biscuits without shortening but the whole wheat flour is an added bonus.  I used "white" wheat flour for the whole wheat and the texture was awesome.  The only thing that was different from traditional biscuits is the light brown color.  This may have been as much a result of the butter as the whole wheat.

This is my 1st time making biscuits from scratch. The recipe was easy to follow. I made the recipe twice. Original recipe and with only whole wheat flour. I took the review of another member and added an additional 1/4tsp of baking powder. THESE ARE GREAT! I like the whole wheat better.

Great! I drizzled honey over them before cooking for subtle flavor. Yes they kind of fell apart while eating them but the texture and flavor were great. made them with BBQ and in the end I just had a bowl of sauce and biscuits and it was soooo good mixed together!

I just realized after looking at this recipe that I left out the sugar! But these were wonderful.  I added some garlic powder to the dough, and dropped them instead of rolling them out.  When they came out, I brushed on a mixture of melted butter, garlic powder, parsley and salt.  They were soooo good.  Very fluffy on the inside and much lighter than I expected with the whole wheat flour.  This made 9 large drop biscuits, and my hubby ate 3!  This will be my standby recipe for biscuits.

So, so good!  I've tried a lot of biscuit recipes and have been on the hunt for the perfect one!  These had whole wheat and no shortening and were fluffy and flavorful!  Excellent.  

My first batch turned out strange because my 8 year old was calling out the ingredients to me....he told me 3 tsp salt instead of 3/4 tsp salt! :D  And they were STILL good! lol.

these are wondeful and soft. I used the food processor to make them and they turned out too soft to roll out so I turned them into drop biscuits and they are awesome, thank you a real keeper.

Our family enjoyed these last night. I didn't actually make biscuits though. I used the dough to make pigs in a blanket but they went over well. They rose nicely. Like others I did not use the full cup of milk and it was still so sticky I had to ad a bunch more flour on the counter in order to knead the dough. At first it stuck to everything and I had to continue adding flour until I could work with the dough. The stickyness is why it got a 4 star review I think the proportions of ingredients needs adjusting.

I thought these were pretty good, but not as fluffy and delicious as the description implied.  I also added a small amount of fresh rosemary to the milk before adding it, which provided a subtle flavor that I was glad was there.

I love these biscuits. I have made them several times and they always come out fluffy. The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly. I use my Ninja blender with the paddle insert to mix. It incorporates all the ingredients without mixing too much, which could make your biscuits tough. The second time I made them, I was short on butter, so I had to substitute half the butter for oil. They still came out awesome. I'm too impatient to do the roll and cut thing, so I just make drop biscuits. I love the crispy edges. Drizzle with honey and sometimes butter. MMMMM...This is my new favorite biscuit recipe.

I used all white flour instead of the wheat.  My biscuits rose nicely but were a bit flavorless.  I'm not sure why.  I processed by hand as I do not have a food processor.  Overall pretty good.

Pretty good, but I feel like they're lacking a bit in flavor. Adding a bit of honey and butter is the way to go. I mixed all the dry ingredients, then threw into a food processor with frozen, cubed butter and pulsed until it resembled coarse meal. I drizzled the milk in while pulsing until just combined, then kneaded on a lightly floured board. They rose beautifully!

These were delicious as is. All I did was melt some butter, added some garlic powder and parsley to it and used it to baste the biscuits when they came out of the oven.
This is my son's favorite biscuit recipe. Next time I will add some shredded sharp cheddar to the batter.

These turned out almost perfect except they were way too salty and almost inedible the next morning. Note: I followed the recipe exactly. However, after stirring, I immediately scooped the mixture into balls and into the oven. No kneading.

Was pretty good. I used  1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup of malt flour. Probably does need more baking powder. Didn't rise very much. But was really good with the easy vegan gravy recipe. If they had been fluffier I would have given them 5 stars but maybe that's the best you can get with whole wheat. It is a much denser, heartier flour.

Yummy! I like to make my baking powder biscuits only using whole wheat flour, but using half all-purpose flour makes them taste much better! Try adding fresh dill weed or fresh parsley to these biscuits.

Loved this recipe! It was very easy to make, and I wouldn't change a thing. Have since made them a few times and next time I think I'll try brushing some herbed butter on the top and baking. Definitely making them again!

Very good recipe overall.  Skip the white flour and use all whole wheat for a healthier recipe that still turns out well.

AMAZING! I did drop biscuits instead of rolling them and they were fluffy and crispy on the outside.

Four thumbs up! Hubby and two daughters and I enjoyed them fresh out of the oven. Quick and so easy. I just put the dough on lightly floured parchment, sprinkled with a bit of flour, flattened it out, scored and baked. Delish!

Great recipe. So easy, even a man like me can do it!  Mine came out a little too salty because I used salted margarine. Next time I will correct the salt.

This recipe was super simple and easy to follow.  I used a pizza cutter to divide my dough into equal portions since I didn't have a biscuit cutter and a small juice glass just wouldn't have given me the flakiness that I wanted (you have to have sharply cut edges to get good flaky layers).  The next time I make these I will add just a little bit more kosher salt to keep them from tasting too bland.  Quick tip:  be sure to preheat your oven to 450 degrees BEFORE you begin mixing your dough.

I skipped the white flour and used whole wheat only. I made them as drop biscuits and while they weren't the prettiest biscuits (lol) they were quite delicious and I definitely plan on making them again. This recipe is simple and great for a novice biscuit maker such as myself. Next time I add garlic and cheddar.

Very nice, loved it!! I LOVE biscuits and gravy in the morning so this was AWESOME! I used all whole wheat flour and used canola margarine instead of butter. Very tasty! I'm gonna have to make them real soon. Great recipe;)

this is a really nice little recipe. i followed the recipe exactly and dropped the batter in lumps onto my boyfriend's chicken-mushroom-veggie-sauce mix. we baked it at 450 for fifteen minutes, and the sauce kept the biscuits moist while allowing them to cook all the way through. i could easily see adding an extra teaspoon of sugar and some dried fruit for scones; very versatile.

Great little biscuits.  I had no white flour, so used all whole wheat. Stuck the half stick of butter in the freezer for about 30 minutes before cutting it into the flour.  Made all the difference over the first batch, for which I only had softened butter.  Work the tiny chunks of cold butter into the flour by pinching it with your fingers until there are no more chunks left.  Ad milk slowly, stir sparingly, turn out and cut.  I got about 20 1 1/2" mini biscuits per batch and took them to class with ham and cheese for our break. They were GONE!

i followed the recipe exactly - with the only exception being that I made drop biscuits to save time. I used tub margarine and skim milk. And they were AWESOME! My son was shoving them in him mouth as fast as he could. I'll probably never use another recipe again. Thanks for posting!! UPDATE: I tried this recipe for Cheddar-Thyme biscuits and they were so yummy. Stir in an additional 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp dried thyme, 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1 cup shredded cheddar, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder.

Excellent recipe!  To make it healthier-I used all whole wheat flour and kefir.  So I added 1/2tsp baking soda.  I also did NOT use any sugar and they where awesome!  The softest inside and crisp of the outside biscuits I have ever made and they rose beautifully!

The biscuits are excellent.  I love the simplicity of the recipe.  They are light but don't taste "diet." They don't leave you with that heavy feeling many biscuits do.  Thanks for sharing!

even though i wish i were, i'm not a natural when it comes to baking. cooking main courses, etc is more my forte. BUT this was easy enough to follow and they came out great. the first time i did it, i didn't have whole wwheat (thought i did) so just used 2 cups regular flour. next time was whole wheat and delicious! i used more butter than it calls for, though.

Overall a really solid fluffy wheat biscuit recipe that does not require sifting, and uses less butter (for those cutting back on fat)!  It was a tad dry for me (not overcooked), which reminded more of a KFC biscuit.  I followed the recipe, except I reduced the sugar by half. I think next time for my taste buds, I would try it with buttermilk instead of milk, and increase salt to 1 teaspoon. This would probably be a good base recipe if you want to play around with different flour mixes (like oat and wheat), use skim milk or non-dairy milk, and maybe even try adding some whey powder to make a great wholesome snack on the go.  Happy baking!

These biscuits are easy to make and super yummy! I used salted butter so I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. Worked great! I also use this recipe as a base for cinnamon rolls. I roll it out flat and sprinke with cinnamon and brown sugar. Then I roll it up and slice it. Yum!

It was a bit difficult to handle the batter, as it came out very sticky for me.  Otherwise, the biscuits were absolutely divine fresh out of the oven.  I served them with butter and jam and they were delicious, and healthy too!

These were excellent, especially considering they were whole wheat based. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk but minus two tablespoons of buttermilk from the stated one cup. I also added two teaspoons of baking soda and one extra teaspoon of baking powder. I cooked them for 10 minutes.

I've made this several times, using several variations. Original is very good. Cheese is also good. Cheese and jalapeño is awesome. I just tried cheese and caraway -- didn't work so great as a breakfast biscuit, but would taste amazing with a hearty goulash as a dinner biscuit. I literally cut in cold butter from the fridge with a knife when mixing -- lumps of butter will ensure fluffy air pockets later. If you're finding it too sticky, use a little less liquid or a little more flour -- can't always account for local humidity! I plan on making this again and again.

DELICIOUS! I just made them and couldn't stop at just one or two...I had three! Good thing this was "brunch" so I can count it as two meals! I used all whole wheat flour and used 5 teaspoons baking soda like others suggested. Thank you for posting, Ruth Ann!

I just made these to go with strawberry shortcake tonight. I've made other WW buiscuits and they were heavy & dense - NOT THESE!! I put in 2 tsps of baking soda and I used fat free buttermilk in place of the milk. These are the best biscuits ever! Thank you so much for creating this delicious recipe for us to enjoy!!!

"Fluffy" and "Whole Wheat" do not always belong in the same sentence, but here they do! I live near the ocean so I had to adjust the milk down to just over 2/3 c, added by tablespoonfuls.

Very good. Light and fluffy. I used all whole wheat flour instead of the white flour. I was short on time so did not roll them out but I did the drop biscuit way and they were awesome.

This is the best whole wheat biscuit recipe I've found.  I've tried it with all whole wheat flour, and thought they were too heavy and grainy (although they were edible). I've made it several times as written, and am never disappointed.

Four stars for ease, but I wish they'd been fluffier. Could have been my fault (I used oil instead of butter and used 1/2 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup cream, not to mention that I don't have a rolling pin and ended up rolling the dough with my hands) but they were just so dense. Still, I got nothing but compliments on them so I guess all was not lost.

I make these biscuits all the time, they are super easy and so good! We have them with soup, stew or just as a snack with butter and honey -DELICIOUS. If you need them in a hurry just make drop biscuits. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'm so glad I found such a great way to make whole wheat biscuits!

I just made these for dinner tonight, and I must say, I was a little weary of them at first but they turned out really well. I made exaclty as written other than rolling and cutting. Instead I just rolled out buns with my hands and flattened slightly. They turned out really well, and because of the ease of recipe, I will definately make again.

I made these exactly as the recipe is written and my 2 kids (ages 9 and 12) and my husband and I all loved them!  This was my first attempt at making biscuits from scratch and I'm so glad I used this recipe. We haven't had biscuits in so long because of how unhealthy the store bought ones are. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful! I rolled out the first batch too thin, so they seemed flat, yet they were still unbelieveably flaky for being whole wheat. Even my mother, the whole-wheat queen, was impressed with how flaky they were, and couldn't believe they were made with whole wheat!

I made these exactly as written and although they were pretty good, they weren't as fluffly as I would have liked. I do like that they're half whole wheat so I'll probably make them again.

These are really, really good. I only use white flour and they still turn out great. I always double the recipe, and it doesn't need both cups of milk, more like 1 3/4 cups. Makes about 20 super fluffy biscuits, just like mom used to make!

Easy, fast and GOOD!  I used all white flour, and my stand mixer though I cut the butter before adding it and then crumbled a bit with my hands as well.  Dough was sticky but I turned it out on heavily floured surface and gave it a couple quick kneads before rolling.  Perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved the results.  I have not found a recipe that used whole wheat and only 1/4 butter.  So much healthier and very tasty.  I also have made them with buttermilk and it just put them over the top.  My kids absolutely loved them!!!

Thses cooked up really nice and were not difficult to do. My family and i just didn't care for the taste. If you expect a whole wheat taste, you'll be okay with it. I guess we were expecting more of a greasy biscuit taste, being southerners! It is a nice recipe  for a healthier biscuit.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and found them to be the most tender biscuits I'd ever made, and among the easiest to prepare as well.  I didn't have trouble with the dough being too sticky, so I'm not sure why others did.  The only thing I would change is that next time I'll roll the dough a bit thinner than 3/4 inch, as they were a little bit too thick and filling.  I used a star-shaped cookie cutter instead of a biscuit cutter and had good results.

I added cheddar cheese and made them into drop biscuits. I dont use wheat flour very often thats why I gave 3 stars there was nothing wrong with the amounts of ingredients. I would suggest using buttermilk. Thanks for sharing!

these were delicious. i am new to using wheat flour and i thought these were amazingly fluffy. i used my food processor for the dough and refrigerated it in a sealed tupperware. the next day i made drop biscuits out of them and they were still done in 10 mins even right out of the fridge. i will make these often when i am out of yeast or dont feel like waiting 3 hrs for my bread machine to make a loaf for me. TRY THESE!!!

Really not great. Hoping for more. Followed the recipe exactly. Might be better if used white flower. They were not fluffy. It might have been me but just didn't come out right.

These biscuits are perfect. I make them 3 or 4 times a week for different breakfast dishes. The first time I made them, I was frustrated because the dough was WAY too soft and sticky to knead, let alone roll out. But my mom showed me how to use a very well-floured surface and well-floured hands and most importantly to move very quickly to knead this dough, then it rolls out easily (again with a well-floured pin). Now I have the recipe (which I haven't altered a bit) memorized and use it often. And they taste so good fresh out of the oven!

These biscuits turned out perfect--definitely fluffy, light, and delicious. They were very easy to make as well. I used all white flour because that's what I had. And I made them as drop biscuits to save time. I will make these again.

These were ok.They did not raise like i would have liked them to.The flavor was good but they were a bit on the dry side & not very fluffy.I think i will work on this one a bit to them moister & rise alot more. I do believe it has great potential with modification's.

I used this recipe to make dumplings, and they turned out delicious! I added some dried thyme and two T spoons fresh parsley, made as directed but instead of cutting out biscuits cut into cubes and dropped into the pot with the chicken n' (not-yet)dumplings. Will make as biscuits next time, too!

I made these biscuits to go along with a pot roast I was making and what a wonderful addition to meal.  The biscuits did not last long on the table.  I felt some reviewers made to many “modifications” when the recipe is fantastic just the way it is.  Great biscuit and will definitely make again.

Really very tasty biscuits that go perfectly with gravy!  Extremely easy to make, I used the dough blade on my stand mixer. I also only used organic white flour, not whole wheat and they taste great.  Make sure you add the milk very slowly to the batter and that you roll the dough to the proper thickness since they do not rise that much.  You can use a cookie cutter if you don't have a biscuit cutter.

These were great for being wheat. I sifted the flours and baking powder.  I actually did drop biscuits and they turned out nicely.  I do have to admit they have a bit of baking powder taste but put some jam and butter on them and they taste great!

We followed the mixing recipes exactly and used this for our family's favorite tuna roll-up recipe. The roll-ups were so tender! I had extra, so also used it for a peach cobbler.

I followed this recipe exactly, but something wasn't right.  These biscuits were okay, but they didn't fluff up nearly as much as I thought they would and they tasted like the baking soda.  They weren't terrible, but I won't be making them again.

I was out of butter; olive oil & country crock was substituted (odd combo but worked well). Only had to use 3/4 cup milk. Turned out great! So simple and tasty.

I did find the dough really sticky, which is strange because I'd added 1 tbsp of ground flax seed also. Trying to make it even healther but it was still sticky. They turned our dense and flat, so I'm not sure what I did wrong. I'd even used block margarine straight from the fridge. Not sure if I'll try these again..only to see if I did something wrong the first time.

They tasted ok, but mine weren't fluffy at all. I reverted back to my original biscuit recipe and just subbed half wheat flour and a tad more baking powder with good results.

Wow, these were so simple and turned out so well! I added the milk a little at a time so that it was barely mixed in. Then I actually kneaded it a little in the bowl before turning it out and kneading it on the wax paper dusted with flour. It was a little sticky, but with flour on the surface you roll and knead it on that is quickly remedied. They were perfect in 10 minutes!

I've never made biscuits before so I'm sure it's something I did wrong. They came out completely flat...but they were still really good! They are great with pepper jelly or honey.

I was against w.w. buscuits until this recipe! I would agree that the dough was sticky, but if your surface and rolling pin are adequately floured, it shouldnt be a problem. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks!

Sorry, Dave W. I had perfect success with them. Yes the dough was sticky but the flour added with rolling them out was enough to combat that. They did turn out fluffy and my family loved them.

These were wonderful!  Whenever I get sick I love biscuits.  Normally I use my grandmother's recipe, but being away from home I couldn't remember the exact measures.  While this recipe wasn't quite the same, they were very light, fluffy and had a very pleasant buttery taste.  I would definitely recommend them for a warm breakfast or as a compliment to a nice bowl of stew.

I used 1 cup freshly milled whole wheat and one cup dead all-purpose flour.  The biscuits were fantastic! Light, fluffy and really easy to make.  I'll be making these weekly for my family.

I didn't have whole wheat flour so I just used white and they came out nice.  I was a little worried with how sticky my dough was, but with a floured surface and rolling pin they didn't stick at all.

These are very easy to make and look impressive if you are entertaining guests for breakfast. I used the recipe "as is" except I cooked them on a heated pizza stone at the temperature stated in the recipe. Important trick with the cold butter is to cut it up into small squares to easily mix it into the dough. I placed my biscuits on a wood pizza peel lightly dusted with cornmeal and slipped them onto the hot pizza stone. When cooked they are delicious and beautiful.

These rose nicely and were fluffy, they tasted bland but I think it was because my whole wheat flour was not fresh..woo hoo - imagine making freshly baked cardboard tasting biscuits!  I would try these again with fresh flour.

These are delicious! I made them using all Whole Wheat Flour, substituted olive oil for the butter and added extra baking powder. I then added cinnamon and a little more sugar. My kids and I loved them! I will definitely make these again, though next time I may try different add-ins.

These turned out great! My husband loved them, and he is not much of a whole-wheat fan. Our only problem was how addictive they were--it was hard not to eat all of them in one-sitting!

Great biscuits! I also used some fresh garlic and cheese and they were really good. In the words of my 5 yr old son..."these biscuits are awesome!" We will make these again, for sure.

Very good biscuits.  I followed advice of other reviewers and added all whole wheat flour and 1 tsp extra baking powder.  The dough is sticky but if you generously dust your board with flour it became very workable.

These were pretty good.  I ate them using the cinnamon honey butter recipe from this site.  They were fluffy and good, although I had to use bread flour instead of wheat flour.  I'll try these using shredded cheese soon.

Excellent Recipe.  I substituted 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour for the flour and used 1 cup of soy milk in place of regular milk.  Great recipe for those who are fasting for Lent.  Thank you!!

This is one "fool proof" recipe! Just what gals like me who find baking a hit or miss project need! I lost my gf's easy recipe a while ago & I think I've finally found a replacement. I didn't have WW flour so I just used all purpose & they turned out just great! I can't wait to double it & use the whole wheat next time! Awesome addition to lentil stew or chicken soup! Yummy:)

Very yummy! I used all wheat flour and only about 1/2 tsp of salt.  I also did drop biscuits because I wanted them really quick! I think I would double the recipe and make bigger biscuits next time!

I really liked these, but not everyone in my family was as enthusiastic. Maybe it was just the idea of a whole wheat biscuit. I only got 10 biscuits, not 12, but that's OK, because there are fewer for me to finish then. Thanks for the recipe!

I only used 1/2 cup of whole wheat and then the rest regular, as my family is pretty particular about their unhealthy habits. I also followed the directions below to make the garlic cheddar and YUM! They were great, so fluffy and almost as easy as Bisquick. I'll definitely make them again. I rolled out the dough to about 1/2 inch, maybe a little thinner, and cut with a glass cup. Delicious.

These kind of had that overwhelmingly bitter "wheat-y" taste from the whole wheat flour. But as long as they were covered in gravy, you couldn't notice.

This was fanastic! But as always I like like to jazz biscuits up a little. I added the following at they were a huge hit with my new boyfriend. I added 3 tlb sps of parmasan cheese, some finely chopped chives, 1 clove of garlic again chopped finely (micrwave for 1min in a small dab of butter) and a tsp of dried basil. There were light, fluffy and full of flavour.

My 4 year old loves to cook with me and he wanted to make some biscuts. So we used this recipe and they were delicious. We toasted the leftovers the next morning and put butter and honey on them. We'll be using this recipe again.

Indeed turned out kinda fluffy (& cut with a cup since no biscuit cutter). Must have rolled/kneaded too much because they're not as fluffy as photo, but certainly taste just fine.
2nd time: Used my food processor, and didnt realize my butter didn't get cut into it and pea-size. oops. Despite that, they still taste mildly sweet, and about 1/2 (out of 15) rose to about 1".

I was terribly disappointed with these biscuits.  Though I followed the recipe exactly, I didn't think the biscuits were fluffy at all.  They were actually quite dense and though the bottoms browned the tops were pale.  Last time I made the plain Whole Wheat Biscuit recipe from this site and tripled the recipe and it was so much nicer, I will be sticking to that from now on.  I think the addition of baking soda in the other recipe may be the key.

Overall I wasn't very happy with this recipe. For the whole wheat part it's nice. Not very flavorful though. By 12 servings the member must mean 12 individual biscuits. I followed the recipe exactly as it said without any mods, and it came out sub-par.

This biscuits recipe is great.  So easy and delicious. I changed the recipe a bit to make them vegan (vegan butter/shortening and soy milk). They were perfect. I have made them many times with rave reviews.  Perfect with honey.

The texture was great, and I love how this recipe uses whole wheat flour. But all I could really taste was the baking powder (and at 4 tsps, how could you not?).

I too was surprised at the fluffiness of these biscuits, they are terrific with a bit of jam and butter.  Using very cold butter and milk worked the best for me.  These will be my go to biscuits for Biscuits and Gravy...never going back to the canned chemically tasting things again!

I have made wheat biscuits in the past that turned out flat and tasteless.  This recipe is really fluffy & tasty. I was out of all purpose flour so I used bread flour instead which worked just fine. You really can't taste the salt in this recipe, next time I am going to add a little more salt.

After the rave reviews, I feel bad for being negative. I've gone over the recipe several times - I made exactly as written except for making drop biscuits instead of rolling/cutting out. They completely lacked any flavor, and in fact seemed rather sour. I think that there may be too much baking powder in these. I loved the fact that they were made with whole wheat flour mix - but the only way they tasted good was with a HUGE amount of honey & butter on them!

I followed the recipe exactly, my dough was actually a little dry, not sure if this is b/c I use stone ground whole wheat flour or not.  The biscuits turned out light and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  My only complaint is that they didn't puff up very much, maybe because there wasn't enough liquid?  
Will definitely make again, but make as drop biscuits and add milk until the dough is sticky :)

I made this recipe with the exact ingredients and amounts.... the biscuits were really moist and fluffy, but they were alittle bland. I served them with sausage gravy, they were fine for that, but I would have to put something in them if I was going to eat them plain. I made biscuits the other day off the back of the bisquik box and they were hard and not so good... theese were much better!

Very easy and deliscious Biscuits! I wanted to try baking bisquites like the ones I have had at the british tea house long time ago, and these came out just like those ones exept that they are made with whole wheat flour... Only change I made is putting less salt in, because in general, I think biucuits are too salty. Love it with Honey and whipped cream or Strawberry jam with whipped cream. yummm :9

Beautiful and delicious!  These remind me of the biscuits my mom made as I was growing up.  I would suggest shortening for a lighter biscuit, but the butter flavor is very tasty.  I omitted the sugar as I was using the biscuits as a base to slather pear preserves on and the preserves are sweet to begin with.

I used all whole wheat flour as well, and added garlic powder and shredded cheese.  They were quite yummy... if I had brushed butter on them, they would have tasted just like the Red Lobster biscuits!  Because of time, I made them as drop biscuits so they didn't look very appealing, but they tasted great with chili!

This recipe was delicious!! I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I substituted it for whole rye; I also don't own a biscuit cutter, so I used a cookie cutter - they came out amazing! Took 10 minutes to make. Goes great with French cheese.

I used all whole wheat flour and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out way to baking "powdery" and didn't have a very good flavor.  Maybe we'll try again with less baking powder and more butter! :)

Super great! I can't believe how fast & easy this recipe is, it makes me look like I've been making these forever (tonight was my 2nd time), and maybe someday my son's kids will talk about "grandma's biscuits" :-) These are amazingly light and tasty and I'm afraid to make any changes/additions for fear that they won't be the same. I won't be wasting money on refrig. rolls anymore!!

Awesome recipe!  Finally a healthier biscuit that my husband likes.  I only made 1/2 to try it out.  I substituted canola oil for the butter/margarine as suggested by another member, added garlic salt in place of salt, and mistakenly left in the 1 whole tablespoon sugar and it all worked out.  Thanks!

Very good. I made some changes to veganize them. I used soymilk and half shortening/ half earth balance margarine. I also used spelt flour in place of whole wheat. (not because whole wheat isnt vegan just cause i bought some spelt flour from the farmers market)
i also added about 1 tbl finely minced rosemary- which i strongly recommend.
These were great. Oh yeah and the knead gently part is true. The batter seems very wet but gently knead on a very floury board with floury hands and theyll be light and fluffy in the end.

These biscuits really are great! My family likes them a lot. The first time I made them I dropped them instead of rolling and cutting them. They turned out dense and doughy but they were very good. This time I rolled them out and cut them and they were much lighter. This will be my go-to now for biscuits with dinner. No more canned biscuits for us. These are much more healthy and less expensive.

Very fluffy and delicious biscuits! I think I'm going to add a tsp of honey next time to give it an extra kick in sweetness. I didnt have a biscuit cutter so I just used my ramekin, turned out great anyway!

I started making this recipe and when I went to grab the butter, I realized that all I had was SmartBalance buttery spread.  I was nervous about how they would turn out, but they were actually perfectly delicious.  I didn't roll them out, but just dropped spoonfuls onto my pizza stone.  My husband ate at least 5 of them by the end of the night!

I love this recipe! It's quick, simple and lives up to its name! However, I did make tweak it a bit, (I subed the wheat flour for another cup of white all-pupose flour) This is the best and pretty close to KFC biscuits! Congrats and Thank you! My Family LOVES it!

These are GREAT! I have tried other whole wheat biscuit recipes without much success, but I followed the recipe on these and they came out perfect. I added the milk too fast and the dough was sticky--I suspect it may vary based on flour brand and/or butter. (Mine was straight from the fridge). To solve the problem, I simply mixed in a little more flour. I also made the dough in my food processor. The key there is not to overmix. Excellent recipe! I will make again and again!

Very Good, i made it within minutes of reading this recipes because it was simple.  I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so i used all all purpose flour and it was still very good, i would lower the temp next time because they were a little overcooked at the bottom.

Delicious and easy. I rolled them too thin, so they were very short.

Good biscuits. I made these just as the recipe instructed and they were good. Not quite as tall as the ones in the photo, about half as tall. They had a nice flavor   and were great with butter and honey. Very quick, too, which was nice. Will make these again.

These were really good served with stew.  We ate the leftovers with butter and jam.  My toddler loved them. They're a little dense, but whole wheat baked goods usually are.

These were very easy to make, and they were fluffy. I just wasn't wowed by them. They were kind of dough-y tasting. I might make them again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

We are not healthy eaters in our household so to find any reciped that has whole wheat that each of us was willing to try again --- well that makes it a five star. Were I not worrying about health I think I would say 3 1/2 BUT . . . if you already eat healthy this is a 5 star ---- if you don't this is the one to help get your taste buds and eating habits to the right spot.  We did this with a bowl of soup and loved it.

I have only made drop biscuits with this recipe...with two small kids who has time to roll the dough out?  I have used all whole wheat flour and just as the recipe states and both are really good.  My husband and son could eat these all day and they taste like I spent hours on them when they only take about 5 minutes to toss together!

This recipe was wonderful.  The biscuits were light and not dense and extremely easy to prepare.  As a mom of 6 quick, easy and great tasting is a great combination.  Thanks for the recipe, I will use it time and again!!

Um....not fluffy.  And there was NO kneading because they were soooo sticky it didn't knead, just got stuck all over my hands.  Probably won't try again. Had to make drop biscuits because of the sticky factor.

They were fluffy and delicious, but I have yet to find a biscuit that doesn't over cook on the bottom.  Maybe it's just my oven, but until that magical day when I have perfect biscuits I'm limited to giving a 4 out of 5.

My family enjoyed these a lot, especially with honey!  These were flakier than a similar recipe made with oil, naturally, but the taste was much the same.  My only disappointment was that they weren't as fluffy as I wanted.  They were still pretty flat.  Maybe that was my fault.  I'll make them again, though.

I enjoyed the whole wheat taste of these biscuits but my family found them too dry and tasteless.  The dry part might be because I found the dough too sticky and added a lot more flour so next time I think I'll add some honey, reduce the milk to half a cup and add a little vanilla.  Thanks =)

Sooo good.  I substituted these biscuits for the store bought ones in the "Creamy Turkey And Biscuits" recipe.  What a treat!

The biscuits tasted pretty good, but they reminded me way too much of the homemade dog biscuits I make for my chow. Overall, they were okay, but I don't think I will be making them again.

These were good, but not rave-worthy. They were WAY to sticky to roll out, even after I added some flour, so I had to attempt to shape them by hand. Very stick, so it ended up looking like lumps. Good taste, but I've had better. Thanks for sharing!
