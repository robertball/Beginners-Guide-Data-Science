Great recipe. I had trouble rolling the dough paper-thin, but I found an easier way. If you have trouble, just roll the dough as thin as possible, cut into strips, and then roll each strip separately... and continue with the process. And be sure to dust with sugar while still warm!! :)

I made the cookies for Christmas, my family LOVED them, we have not had them since my Grandmother died, and everyone was thrilled that I found a recipe that tasted just like the one we knew from our childhood.

Turned out just like my mothers and grandmothers. You can't eat just one.

I think this recipe was excellent. I have been looking for a good Chruscki recipe for years. My mom used to make them but never had a written recipe. Thank you.

Not grandma's, but couldn't get a recipe because there was nothing written down.  However, really close and really good!  Did a test batch, and my husband ate half of them.
