This recipe is delicious. Another dressing, which I have used is: 
6 TBLs. of butter melted and pour over the beans, then sprinkle 6 TBLS. of light brown sugar over the melted butter and beans. Just an alternative. Both are very good.

I followed this recipe as stated except for the presentation - I sauteed some onions and garlic in more Italian dressing and poured the mixture over the top of the green bean bundles.  It made for an elegant presentation.  I made this and the Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes as side dishes to the Spicy Oven Fried Chicken from this site.  It was a great meal!

While my DBF loved them, I enjoy them made with Catalina French dressing better, there's just too much "twang" for me.

What a fun and stunning way to turn ordinary green beans into something wonderful! One substitution I made was using balsamic dressing instead of italian (I did not have italian at the time) but they tasted great! the bacon wrap is such an elegant presentation tip! would definitely make again and again

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner last year.  They take a little bit of time to make, but they are well worth it.  Everyone loved them and they look great as well.

I was not overly impressed with this.  I liked the green beans and bacon together but did not like the Italian Dressing with it.  However, the hubby and kids thought they were great.

It may have been how I cooked this recipe, but the green bean came out a little crunchier than I would have liked and the Italian dressing was too zesty for my liking.

My husband loves green beans so this was a nice change to the normal way I cook them. I did add some Ms Dash seasoning. I didnt microwave mine I just cooked them longer in the oven. Line your pan with foil for an easier clean up!

Easy and simple. I recommend using fresh green beans because the canned ones were a bit soggy.

I made my bacon more crispy, and instead of using italian dressing I used some leftover walnut fig balsamic vinaigrette dressing I had.  Very tasty!

This was a wonderful side dish! I prepared exactly as written. The presentation on the plate was fabulous! Everyone was impressed with my culinary expertise ... thank-you for a wonderful way to serve green beans!!! ps. I made this same recipe with asparagus (very thin ones)...it too turned out very  impressive.

Really good.  Looks great.  The Italian dressing has a little too much zip for me.  Next time i think I'll just use some olive oil, Italian spices and maybe a little lemon.  Thanks
