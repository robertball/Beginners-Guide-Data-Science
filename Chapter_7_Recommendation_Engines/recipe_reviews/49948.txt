Sooo easy, tasty, and quick.  Don't worry about making the ring - it normally doesn't hold together, and the individual ones are just as good and probably preferable (people avoid breaking things apart).  Great way to make cream puffs - and you can avoid drawing circles.  I made these twice of how quick it is.  Highly recommended.

This was awesome!  I didn't make any changes and don't know if this did a thing to help the dryness (breaking apart), but I put a pan of water in the oven while the pastry was cooking.

This is the perfect mixture of fancy and easy. It's easy enough to make on a weeknight and fancy enough for company. I have always been a bit intimidated by Pate-a-choux but this recipe proves how easy it really is. This has become a favorite of mine.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It's absolutely delicious!  And SO easy to make.  It's become a standard during the holidays for our family.  My brother-in-law, Ed, requests these every year.  Then he stands guard, and if anyone gets too close to his cream puffs, he'll growl at them.

This was a huge hit at the halloween party I took this too. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have semi-sweet morsels on hand so I substituted 3 squares of semi-sweet baking squares chopped up. My puffs did not stick together in a ring when I removed from the baking sheet, but that was okay, I just placed them back together on the serving tray. Also, I ended up just cutting the top off each puff, pulled out the "webbing" inside, filled with the cream and put the top back on. Very yummy! Thanks for sharing your recipe. I will definitely make this again!

I would really recommend the choux pastry component of this recipe; it's well-written and easy to follow, especially for someone who has never made choux pastry before!  It turned out perfectly.  I'll be using this again for eclairs & profiteroles.  Thanks!

I would rate this more than 5 stars if I could!  I followed the recipe exactly as written for the puff pastry dough.  I wanted small, individual-sized puffs, so I piped them in a swirl pattern of approx. 1 and 1/2 inch diameter by 2 inches of height onto parchment lined baking pans.  (Leave approx. 2 inches between each puff--this will make approx. 15 puffs).  I used a large piping tip (not sure the size).  The puffs with height cooked up nicely to accept more filling. 

The second time I made these, I made one other small change (based on our taste preferences); however, the recipe is awesome as written.  Because we both have a sweet tooth, I whipped the cream and set aside, made the pudding with only 3/4 cup of milk, then folded the whipped cream into the pudding and added approx. 1/4 cup of Sweetened Condensed Milk to add more sweetness.  The condensed milk will thin down the whipped cream, so I find it important to add less milk to the pudding.  

This makes a very light, easy to make puff pastry that is visually appealing and tasty!  Thank you Synchorswim!

I use the filling for the middle layer of Scottley's yellow cake recipe and a butter cream frosting.  Turns out great!

For now I am only rating the filling. I make as stated, but with only 1/2 tsp almond extract. I have used this many times to make the filling for a boston cream pie. It is sturdy enough to hold up to the extra cake layer, but still so soft and creamy. I can put the entire batch between two THIN layers of yellow cake, making it the creamiest boston cream pie I have ever tasted. I then top with a chocolate glaze. It is always a hit and gobbled up super fast.

Excellent! At first I was skeptical when the dough tasted like spaetzle, but when I baked them, they tasted like biscuits. The pudding was delicious, and together they made a wonderful combination! They were easy enough to make, but took a while--well worth it, though!

Delicious!! It was a little tricky cutting the puff in half because they all wanted to seperate from each other, but otherwise it was great.

Made this for the first time tonight for company and they thought I fussed.  Turned out great and tasted even better than it looked.  It didn't hold together in the ring but that really doesn't matter.  Next time I might pump the pastry through a tube into small shapes.  There were NO complaints with this.

I love making cream puffs, so I did that but used the almond cream for a filler!  LOVED it!  A lot of cooks are intimidated by the fact that these are almost too good to be so easy.  Try it!  It's not hard but I will say it's very important to add one egg at a time to the dough and be sure each egg is incorporated well before adding the next! Enjoy!

Delicious and easy to make. I should have put my scoops of dough a bit closer together because mine broke into separate cream puffs but it still was terrific.

Wasn't satisfied with this recipe.  Followed instructions twice and the puffs weren't puffs, they were like a heavy biscuit.  I've made these before and it wasn't anything like the ones I made with another recipe.
