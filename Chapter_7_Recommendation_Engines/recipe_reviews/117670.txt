This gets a 5 star review from the whole family including the onion hating 13 year old.  :)  I made the recipe as directed - although I will admit I did not measure the spices and I am sure I did not use 1 teaspoon of any of them.  I just gently sprinkled with pepper, sage, thyme and salt.  Browned on all sides as directed.   Do NOT cook to 160.  As of "May 24, 2011 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is updating its recommendation for safely cooking pork, steaks, roasts, and chops. USDA recommends cooking all whole cuts of meat to 145 °F as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allowing the meat to rest for before carving."  At 325 this roast will take less than an hour - depending on the size the temp of the roast plan to start checking at 45 minutes.   If you don't have apple juice concentrate - use apple juice.  I used my hand blender to puree the gravy.  By the time I was done taking a picture the family was heading back for seconds - by the time I was done they had gone back for thirds!   Hubby says I need to make apple sauce to go on the side and well as in the gravy, Next time!  There will be a next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to do quite a bit to it, to give it flavor.  I added one chicken base cube, 1/4 c white wine, a bay leaf, more pepper, more salt and also a sprinkle of poultry seasoning because I didn't have plain sage. (yuck) I also used a bit more meat, so I added one more apple (granny smith).  I subbed the concentrate juice for Simply Apple juice (which is FANTASTIC, by the way).  My guys said that it would have been any more sweet, it would have been gross.  But with the wine, chicken cube, and bay, I think it made it just savory enough.  A must with mashed potatoes.  *“I am an Allrecipes Allstar Brand Ambassador (a voluntary position) and I’m not compensated for my work with Allrecipes.com"*

Excellent.  My husband and I really enjoyed this pork recipe.  I like the sweet of the apples balanced with the savory of the herbs and onions.  I made a few modifications - I didn't have a pork roast on hand so i used 2 - 1 inch pork tenderloin cuts and cut down the cooking time significantly (about 45 mins). Also, I didn't have time to do the gravy - so i just strained the apples pieces and onions and served them on top of the pork.  i will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and added 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar (at my urging of my husband), and sliced carrots and celery.

Made this on a weeknight and it was so easy. Served it with corn and sweet potatoes. It was fantastic. This is an amazing fall recipe. I didn't change much, just didn't measure my herbs and used the whole can of apple concentrate. Mine cooked quicker than the suggested cooking time. Good thing I used a meat thermometer. Will make it again, and already shared it with my friends.

Never know how a new recipe will go over around here but this was a huge hit.  I had a granny smith apple and had to sub white wine for apple juice.  Apples and onion stuck to pan so will spray with cooking spray next time or add a little more olive oil. Served with butternut squash and mashed potatoes. Awesome comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for some folks last night.  It was really good.  I'll definitely make this again, but I think I'll pierce the roast and put some of the rub in the holes.  I really liked the flavor, but the flavor was all on the outside.  The juice helped to add flavor and moisture to the meat.

Yum. Even better when you add a TBS of Dijon mustard to the finished sauce.

OMG. This is fantastic. Made the following substitutions; I used pork tenderloin instead of pork loin roast and savory instead of sage. Added bonus - the house smells great as well.

So easy and delicious.  My kids are super fussy eaters and I can never get them to eat pork.  I've made this twice now and they went back for seconds.  It made a wonderful Christmas Eve meal.  I didn’t try the gravy the first time as I couldn’t imagine onions and apples tasting good pureed together, it tasted just like tangy applesauce.  Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! My 5.5 lb roast took 1 hr 50 mins to reach temp, but the meat was perfectly moist and tender. Thank you for sharing - it's a keeper!

The entire family loved this! I substituted the sage for rosemary because none of us are fans of sage.  It was very tender and juicy.

I made this for a church dinner for our ladies, and it was wonderful!  I did add some heavy whipping cream to the sauce and thickened it slightly with some cornstarch and water for more body.  Taste was amazing!  I served it with some sauteed apples from this site.  Thank you for a great fall recipe!

Oh dear - am so sorry, but DH & I thought this was simply horrible.  Maybe we have a thing against apples & onions - or maybe it was the spices - I don't know, but will def pass next time.

This was excellent! I accidentally used a whole onion instead of 1 cup, and it turned out just fine. I also didn't blend the gravy. I will make this again for sure!

This was delicious! I didn't have a pork loin, but I had some really nice, thick, pork chops and I had to use apple juice instead of concentrate. Also, I had to prep this before I left for work, so I did all of the first half of step 1 and then put it in a glass dish in the fridge covered. An hour before we wanted dinner ready, my husband preheated the oven, and then baked the whole mix for 45-50 min and it was PERFECT! It was moist and delicious and I will definitely make this again, especially now that I know I can prep it early. My husband insisted I definitely add this to the rotation!

This was very tasty and pretty guilt free!  Satisfied the gravy urge without adding a ton of fat (or flour) to the mix.  Only thing I did different other than to use boneless pork loin chops was to use fresh sage and added a bunch of it to the apple/juice/onion mix.  Turned out great!  Served over roast potatoes.  Very enjoyable, a great, light autumn recipe!!

This is a very healthy dinner and has a great flavor.  However, it did not get anyone excited.  It was just ok.

We all loved it and my son ate the gravy like it was soup! Yummy!

I have never braised before. What a great recipe to experiment on! Only issue was the gravy. It was a little sweet for us. It gave great flavor to the pork while cooking though!

This is a nice recipe, I wasn't thrilled with the tasted, too bland for me.  I will try it again and make some adjustments.

5 Stars - Added a little broth and flour I had on hand to make more gravy for the mashed potatoes I served -- mmmmmm ---- ate too much! This was great as is and rated 5 stars!
