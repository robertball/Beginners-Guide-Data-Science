I thought this was delicious:  to make it really fast, I used canned kidney beans and I thought it was just as good!

We used two 14.5 ounce cans of great northern beans, rinsed well. We added the beans after the other ingredients had a chance to simmer. People are right about the olive oil; it may sound like a lot but use the full amount. This soup was easy to make, and looked and smelled great while it cooked - we couldn't wait to eat it! It was delicious, and was a hit at the family post-holiday potluck. Everyone wanted to try the "vegetarian soup", and there were no leftovers to bring home. We'll be making another batch within the week so that we can have more for ourselves.

I took the other reviewers' advice and added more spices. I was out of thyme so I sub-ed sage and ground cloves, tossed in a little chopped garlic, and an extra tablespoon of tomato paste. Everybody raved. Even my toddler loved it.

I love this stuff! All my favourite veggies, olive and spices. WOW! If it was a person I could marry this! :P The parents loved it, and I saved about half an hour using canned beans. I didn't have fresh parsley, though, so I used dried. Everyone: make this soup! it's a vegetarian/vegan's dream!

Delicious the first time around...even better after sitting over night.  I used canned white kidney beans.  Didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  Other than those two changes, I made it according to the recipe.  Served it over rice.  I will definitely make it again...the same way I did this time.

This was a great recipe! I often mess up recipes and this was foolproof. Not to mention it is cheap - carrots, celery, beans and spices I already have on hand? Count me in to eat this many more times.  For the one reviewer who had to add bouillon cubes - I think if you didn't have good quality extra-virgin olive oil, this wouldn't taste as nourishing. But it is a nice, filling vegetable soup, and cooks faster than you would think.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly.  The first night I had it as a soup, which was good, but the second night I let it thicken on the stove a bit more and served it over rice, which was truly great. It makes a delicious, hearty comfort food.

This is a very good soup. I made some changes based on other reviews. I started with 3 c. of water and one bouillon cube. Then I added the onion, carrots, celery, diced tomatoes, 2 Tbs. of tomato paste, oregano, thyme, parsley and olive oil. I omitted the salt because of the bouillon. Once all the vegetables were soft, I added one can of drained and rinsed cannelloni beans (white kidney beans)  and 1/2 cup of alphabet pasta. The result was a very hearty soup. I was full after just one bowl.

A great recipe - I made this for my daughter who tends to prefer all white carbs. I increased the tomato paste and omitted the diced tomatoes only to appeal to my children's palate. I also increased the amount of herbs by about double. Everyone loved the soup.

Loved this recipe.  Used dried white kidney beans and it came out just as expected.  I did chop my veggies and put them along with the spices in the oil first.  I find that doing this opens up the flavor in the spices more and give a better finish to the soup.  Will definitely be making this again.  Oh, and it freezes well.

This is an awesome recipe, we've been making it for years now...thank you so much for posting it!!  My kids and husband love it, and it freezes well too....I usually can't find white kidney beans, but I just throw in whatever kidney beans I have...if I have to cook them from dried, that works, or canned beans work well too.  Lots of Parmesan cheese on top and it's a great meal any time of year!

This soup is very yummy. I soaked up a pot of pinto beans and didnt know what to do with them so I looked up a bean soup and came across this. I added more spices, and tomatoes (due to being more beans than 1 cup) I also added shell pasta 8 mins left of the timer.

This was unexpectedly great! It has depth of flavour and the vegetables come out PERFECT while the beans maintain their integrity. I ate this SEVERAL times during the week and not ONCE was I tempted to throw it out because I was sick of it!

Soup was excellent. I had a similar homemade soup in Greece that I've been trying to recreate. I used canned italian butterbeans since they seemed to be closest to the ones i had. It was great. I heated up some lavash and dipped it in the soup... excellent addition.

Very good ! VERY easy to make. I used canned beans (which shortened the cooking time, and didn't take away from the taste of the soup). Best part is I had everything I needed for this soup in my house already! I like to chop the carrots so they are smaller pieces - makes it seem more hearty. Served with some pita this is a very nice meal.

Another really great addition to this (although I guess it makes it less traditional) is a cinnamon stick, but try it by the recipe first.

Overall, I liked this very much. I would probably use less olive oil next time though. I'm sure it's blasphemy to say that given the taste it adds, but there was a greasy film in the bottom of the bowl due to the plentiful oil. But the bowls were emptied, so I know it was good!

I wish I could give this 4.5/5 stars! Its filling and warms you up on a cold day.  I did have to increase the spices to suit my tastes but thats just a personal preference.  Thanks for a great vegetarian soup!

I have made this twice now. It is now in my top 3 soups to make (and soups are my favorite thing to make). You definitely want to use quality olive oil...it really makes the dish. This is a comfort food, and I can't wait to make it many more times, especially this winter. I give it 5 stars because it really doesn't need any altering from the original recipe and it is VERY delicious.

This didn't come out as flavorful as I was hoping. I ended up adding more tomato paste cause it was too watery. I also added cayenne to give it some flavor. 
I didn't like the smell either.

Delicious. My daughter said this was the best soup I've made. I did have an issue with the amount of oil but went with it anyway and I will use the same amount when I make it again. Thanks.

Like another member, I was kind of freaked out on the amount of oil.  I reduced it to 1/3 cup and it was still wonderful.  It's nice to have this in my cookbook for when my vegetarian friends come to eat.  I used the Progresso white kidney beans-yum!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This soup is bland, but it is delicious by doing a very simple fix. Change "3 cups of water" to "3 cups of vegetable broth". (Or chicken broth if you like that better). Made all the difference.

Wow. I tripled it. Used red kidney because I don't have white. And flipped the fresh/dried (fresh thyme and oregano and dried parsley). Omitted tomato paste (didn't really need it). I also added some bouillon on the advice of the other reviews (this was the main change). And wow this is really good. Even my daughter who normally hates soup liked it and asked me to make it again.

Yum.  I made this in the crock pot--left it on high for about 4 hours, then turned it to low.  Instead of water, I used chicken broth and also used cooked and frozen navy beans (don't have white kidney beans).  This is a lovely veggie soup.  Hubs didn't even complain that there wasn't any meat in it.  I, too, doubled the spices and added garlic.  I don't know how much olive oil I put in--I didn't measure, as usual, and just poured in what looked right.  Thanks for the recipe!

Alright, so I've had this in my recipe box for about six years, and figured it was a good time to try it out. I used cannellini beans, dried parsley, and pre-cut carrot "chips", as it's what was on hand. I omitted the salt (as always), added two extra celery stalks (I love celery), and used ketchup instead of tomato paste. I had the paste on hand, but it was a 12 ounce can. I wasn't going to open the can for 1 tablespoon required in this recipe. Oh, and I don't have thyme, so that wasn't included in this batch.

Overall good and easy to make, a little bland.

I have loved this soup for years, although I have made my own modifications (I switched to red kidney beans and blend 3/4 of them and I use more carrots and celery), but it is delicious (and a vegan's best friend).

3 stars for me = liked it. it was good - i did add a few bouillon cubes - it's just that i was kind of put off by the olive oil. I'm just not sure if i would make it again. My guests liked it but we all agreed that we've had a lot of soups in our lifetimes and we probably would eat this again but it's just not as good as other soups... i'm trying to be nice - can't you tell ;-)
