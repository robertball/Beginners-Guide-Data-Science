As much as I've wanted to be a fan of ground turkey, I wasn't...UNTIL I had these burgers.  The only thing I did differently was omit the water, as it just didn't need it.  You get a nice little crunch from the water chestnuts and just a hint of the soy sauce.  I dressed the buns with Garlic Aioli from this site, and it was the perfect choice.  I did use a meat thermometer, so they were  perfectly cooked and plenty juicy.  Next time, I'll mix up a double batch and just freeze the patties.  This burger ranks right up there with the best I've had in a long time and will be made often.

I've been searching for a turkey burger recipe that I really liked and this is by far the best recipe I've tried. I didn't add water and cooked them on a George Foreman grill and they were great! I also used Gouda cheese and it went well with the burgers. All of the ingredients blend together wonderfully and provides a delicious flavor. I will definitely be making these again!

The fresh ginger makes a difference (I freeze mine in a bag and just cut off what I need).  These are good.  I left out the salt.  I didn't have water chestnuts but did use the green pepper.  I took the advice to use a garlic aioli spread on top- I will use just hot sauce, mustard or plain mayo next time. Whole wheat bun went well with it.  I sauteed mushrooms and put those on top (delish).  Lots of flavor in these burgers, so it was nice to add a new recipe to my ground turkey recipes (I eat a lot of ground turkey).

I've never made turkey burgers before, and never really liked the ones I've had at restaurants, but these had a lot of flavor and did not fall apart. My husband loved them. Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good. I used lean ground turkey breast and did not feel they were dry (I probably over cooked them a bit, but that's because I'm always afraid they aren't cooked enough). I rated them 4 stars because, while they are good, they aren't an outstanding 5 stars, in my opinion. 
 (I used reduced sodium soy and didn't use much salt in the burgers... but they need it), and the water really isn't needed as they are wet enough without it. Next time I make them I will use a touch more soy sauce.
I just felt like they were missing a bit of umph. I may add a bit more ginger next time as well. Additionally, perhaps a spicy aioli or some other spread would compliment these burgers. I don't eat mine on a bun, so I ate mine with Wickles spicy pickle slices and they helped add a bit of heat, and the sweetness of the pickle adds a nice touch to the turkey (which I think a bit of sweetness is what might be missing in these). 
Thanks for the recipe, and I will definitely make these again.

Delicious and I will be making these again! I skipped the water chestnuts and added a pinch of Cajun seasoning for some flare. The burgers were a little too moist so next I won't add any water.

these were really good! moist and filled with flavor. my husband even ate two burgers!! i did make a few changes - no onion (i thought i had some but was wrong) so i made up for it by adding a little extra ginger and soy. i also used a little extra water chestnuts - i used my food processor to get a more consistent texture (plus it helps take the pressure off of my hands/wrists - have rheumatoid arthritis). i opted not to include the green pepper. and instead of water, i used the liquid from the can of water chestnuts.
i made my own asian aioli to spread on top and served the burgers on fresh ciabatta rolls. 
thank you for the recipe - it's been added to my favorites!

Our family enjoyed this turkey recipe very much! My husband is not fond of ground turkey but told me he'd love this meal again! I paired it with some fried rice which I made with leftover white rice we had from last night's dinner and it was really delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, optioning to not include the green pepper because I already had it in the rice. The patties were very moist, which is often one of the problems with ground turkey. It's usually so fat free that it gets dry before it's even completely done.  Not this recipe...it was juicy and delicious! This will definitely be added to my dinner recipes and included in our monthly dinner menus.  With the fried rice and grilled pineapple rings, it was a hit!

Water definitely not needed. End result without water was still mushy.  I substituted poblano for the bell pepper....a kick up.  Although way too moist, burgers grilled up nicely.  Very tasty  Served on toasted buns with aoli garlic sauce and tomato slices.  Was yummy.  Next time I need to think about an additional spice.  Maybe a touch of garlic-chili sauce.

I left out the water and the water chestnuts, and it turned out really good.  Served it on a brioche bun with just lettuce and tomato.  No need for condiments with the flavors in the meat.  Kids are not fans of onions or ginger, so they didn't eat it.  adults still enjoyed, especially the second helping from the kids.

My whole family loves this recipe.  I leave out the bell pepper as my husband can't eat it.  I also leave out the water and salt and use low sodium soy sauce. Serve them on ciabatta rolls with Thai sweet chili sauce. I serve cole slaw to put on it or eat with it.  So yummy!

So yummy! Didn't have ginger so I used some ground ginger spice and used white pepper instead of black. I made small slider patties to eat with rice. So easy and delicious. Will make again.

This was really quite good. The next time I believe I'll cut down (or cut out) the salt; with the soy sauce, it was just too salty. Part way through our meal, my wife had the idea of putting some apricot marmalade on top of the burger. I tried a bite, and the combination of the sweet with the spicy/saltiness of the burgers was fantastic!

These burgers are delicious, and have quickly become a family favorite. I haven't yet used the green pepper or water chestnuts, but the ginger, soy sauce, and minced green onion combine to create a very tasty burger. We serve them topped with melted cheese (optional), lettuce, and tomato, topped with a combination of mayo, sriracha, and lime juice (as suggested by another reviewer) on whole wheat buns. A ramen noodle slaw is a perfect accompaniment, and sometimes roasted broccoli too. Such a tasty, easy meal, enjoyed by everyone we have shared it with. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these exactly as written except the water (don’t understand the point of the water). We loved these! Because I’m on W.W. (formerly Weight Watchers) I didn’t use a bun but rather a low point pocket bread. They were so good I’m going to make up a bunch more and freeze them. I love having something quick and ready to grab-and-go for lunches at work. It easily thaws by lunch time and I’m all set without any mess or extra time in the kitchen. Thank you for this recipe. It’s for sure a keeper!

I made these burgers exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!  I don't like the "mushiness" of ground turkey when raw, but I do love the way the flavors permeate the meat.  The combination of soy sauce, garlic and ginger (I buy a tube of ground fresh ginger found in the produce section) is delicious and the crunch of the water chestnuts really takes it over the top.  Will definitely make again and again!

Love this recipe!  I have made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe, but forgot the water. Did not need it. so moist, so flavorful. I served it on a bun with grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Tonight I tried it again, but decided to use it in stuffed peppers. Since I was going to stuff peppers, I left the green pepper out. They were fabulous! This recipe filled 4 pepper halves. Baked for about 45 minutes at 375.

Great recipe.  The green ginger really gave it alot of flavor.  The ground turkey I bought was too moist to make into patties, so I added bread crumbs until it was at the correct consistancy to make into patties.

These are a delicious alternative to a beef burger. We had them without a bun, and really liked the flavor and crunch of the water chestnuts.

I highly recommend the addition of a generous tablespoon of hoisin sauce to the mixture.  It really added the right note to the flavor.  Like others, I didn't add water.  Next time I think I'll do these in a pan because turkey burgers tend to crumble on the grill for me.

I did like this Asian turkey burger but, have made better texture and tasting ones. I omitted the onion and next time will follow the garlic clove amount. ( I added one more large clove and it was too much for my taste even though I like garlic) Also next time I will add some type of grain for that chewy texture.  This recipe will be in my file and I will make them again.  Forgot to mention I did not put it on a bun.  Asian turkey burger and a side of vegetables was the healthy way to go for me.  Thank you for the recipe.

Ground turkey is difficult to season well and be able to eat alone, but this was good. Family members who don't like ginger flavor did not like it as well. Used 1 tsp ground dry ginger. Served on dinner roll with mayo. Sautéed the onion and pepper to point of carmelized. Yum

These were good considering we had to use the broiler as it was raining out. We "grilled" pineapple slices as a garnish but it still needed some sauce. We found Duck Sauce was great on the burgers with the pineapple.

Very good recipe and burger. My kids loved it also. Since it's a healthier option of burger I used flatbread instead of the recommended burger bun. Definitely keeping this recipe handy.

Always follow the recipe as written the first time, changes after we get to taste it the first time. Found this one without a lot of flavour, will not make it again.

Very flavorful. I agree with other comments that it's a wee bit salty, and the tablespoon of water doesn't seem necessary. I need to really "mince" my onion and dice my water chestnuts very small, as large pieces make the burgers fall apart. Overall, a delicious recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

Super moist w the soy sauce as turkey can be dried (we use ground breast turkey)! Doubled the recipe and all the ingredients and still tasted yummy! Husband had with BBQ sauce and sauteed broccolini w red pepper and sea salt. Kids had with egg brioche buns and broccolini as well.

These were great! I used green onions and omitted the water as many other reviewers suggested. Didn't use the water chestnuts (husband does not like them) nor the green peppers as I didn't have any. Perfect for the grill and I topped them with grilled pineapple rings. My husband thought they were perfect! Very easy to make and we will be making these again!

Loved this! Made it with almost no changes. Had to sub in radishes for the green pepper. Very flavorful. Could not be better. Thank you! I took other reviewers' suggestions & made the quick garlic aioli from this sight to put on the toasted buns.

My hubby said he was disappointed, words he never shares. I agree that they were probably the worst turkey burgers I've ever made (which is not to say they were terrible, just that there are so many other better options.) The only change I made was omitting the salt and water (they were plenty wet and I figured the soy was enough). I don't think a 1/2tsp would have saved it. But I usually modify my meals a lot more, so it just needs more tweaking to become a repeat, I think .

The flavor of these burgers was really really good but I will leave out the water chestnuts next time.  They added a crunch that wasn't good in a burger.  My husband and I feel that it took away from the flavor.

I have made this many times and my husband and I love them.  I usually just do them in a pan over medium high heat.  Also, I've never added the water chestnuts because I don't usually have them. But, tonight, I have water chestnuts in the cupboard and will add them for some extra crunch!

Tasty! Did a mix of soy sauce and vegetarian oyster sauce. Didn't have fresh ginger on hand so used ground, but that would probably make them even tastier.

The meat is still dry and the use of uncooked onions does not help it at all.  If you must make these, at least sauté the onions before mixing with the meat.
