Its even easier if you rinse the shucked corn, leave a bit of moisture on the corn, place the ears in a baking dish (lasagna pyrex is perfect), cover with plastic wrap and microwave on high for about 2 min/ear.  For 4 ears,  try 6 minutes and test before adding more heat.

Donâ€™t need the plastic bag! Just wrap the corn like a pig in a blanket, in wet cold water paper towels, put them on  a paper plate and if you have a setting on you microwave as I do  for fresh vegetable. I just push the button and the microwave does the rest! Just be careful!  in removing the paper towels they are HOT!

Worked out great! Quite a bit faster than in the oven.
