I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this!  This is a great lighter appetizer that will become a staple in my entertaining menu.  Per personal preference, I did sub fresh parsley for cilantro and I used frozen corn instead of canned.  Served w/blue corn tortilla strips, this was a big hit w/our guests last evening.  THANK YOU for the recipe, GMW!

This was pretty good, but seasoning was needed and wasnt mentioned in the recipe. I added crushed red pepper flakes, extra lime juice, salt, and pepper. I like black beans, but I'm not sure they added much to the flavor of this dish. If I make it again, I think I'll leave the beans out and replace them with a bell pepper and cherry tomatoes. I used this recipe as a side dish to grilled jerk chicken and the following day ate it with chips. Both ways were pretty good.

Very good. I used parsley instead of cilantro for personal tastes and only 1 lime.  I think more beans would e nice.

Was really tasty, and nice and light as a side salad. Added cut up grape tomatoes and honey to lime dressing.

I thought this was a bit bland and needed something more.  It may have been because I did not have fresh cilantro and had to substitute dried.  I did, however, use grilled corn which I believe helped.  I added two green onions and salt.  Yum!

Maybe it was just not my type of flavors, but it lacked something. I think if the corn were not canned, but rather grilled or roasted, it would have added more flavor. Also it seemed like too much lime juice. The addition of pineapple or something would have given it a bit more character too. Oh, well. You live and learn. Next....

I couldn't find ripe mangos at the grocery store, so used 3 peaches instead.  I found the salsa very tart, with so much lime juice and no type of sweetener--kept thinking, did I miss something in the instructions??  As is, I thought it was just ok. "Love" the people who gave this 5 stars, but yet doctored it up with mango salsa, tomatoes, corn starch, etc...

Wonderful!! Didn't think I could make salsa but this is quick, easy & delicious!  I increased fresh cilantro to ½ cup & added ¼ cup candied jalapeños & 1 whole diced fresh jalapeño. I also heated up the juice in a can of diced tomatoes & thickened it with a teaspoon of corn starch & a tablespoon of brown sugar & the juice in the jar of candied jalapeños which gave it some sweet kick. Yum!!!
