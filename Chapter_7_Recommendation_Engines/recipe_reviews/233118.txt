The flavor of this cobbler is really good;; however, I see a couple of problems with the recipe:  1) I see no need for the foil lining.  It can shred and end up on your spoon.  Use a prepared deep casserole dish instead; 2) The cooking time says "45 - 90 minutes?"  Done times can be deceiving because you're using brown sugar, which is golden brown in color. This needs to be fine tuned and more narrowly defined.  3)  The cake mix does not get cooked through, so you end up with unbaked dry cake mix throughout.

I made this in a 9x13 baking pan.  I needed two cans of pie filling to cover the bottom of it.  I cut a 1/2 cup of butter into the cake mix along with about a 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  I then put another 1/2 cup of butter in pads on top of mixture and topped with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Baked for 45 minutes - UNCOVERED  (baked it covered once and it was soup).  It was rich and delicious.  (Hard to go wrong with sugar and butter. =)

I made 2 of these, one apple and one cherry!  Everyone loved them, and they were both gone in 2 days!!!  I skipped the aluminum foil because I use Temptations dishes which don't stick.  I baked mine in the oven and had no problems, about 1 hour cook time.  I also used more brown sugar and butter as others have suggested.  I will definitely make this again!

Made it as the directed, though I added more brown sugar(eye balled it) and I used a glass baking dish(prepared). Smells and taste amazing! Can't wait to try other fillings!

Turned out great. Quick and easy.
As was suggested in another review, I made this in a 9x13 baking pan.used two cans of pie filling to cover the bottom of it. I cut a 1/2 cup of butter into the cake mix along with about a 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I then put another 1/2 cup of butter in pads on top of mixture and topped with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Baked for 45 minutes.

Love Cherry Cobbler!  Didn't care for the cake mix idea!
Went back to Bisquick sweetened drop biscuit on top.
