It would be so nice if people would actually make the recipe as stated (or at least close to it) and then review, then make changes on your own time.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it is wonderful comfort food.  Upon first glance it was a strange combination of ingredients but together they do work harmoniously and none outshine another.  I think I would recommend serving it over egg noodles but not adding them to the recipe.  Thanks BlondeJJ for expanding my horizons!

My first thought upon seeing the ingredients was "I'm not going to like this." I had everything, so I decided to give it a shot. I was actually very pleasantly surprised & ended up eating more than I should have. I halved the recipe because I only had a 5 ounce can of tuna. I didn't use the full amount of co mushroom or sour cream, but pretty close to it. I felt the amount of onion powder was a bit much so I used a mix of onion powder, garlic powder & black pepper. I'm not a big salt eater & I thought with the canned soup it would be salty enough, but I was wishing I had mixed a bit in. I also think a dash of fresh lemon juice would be nice to set off the tang of the sour cream. These are all easy changes to suit your tastes. I am not sure I totally loved the boiled eggs in there. Next time, I might leave them out or mash them up more. I had some leftover stale garlic bread so I used that on top. Easy, peasy lunch & very filling. Thanks!

I used fresh spinach and my own recipe for cream of mushroom soup, for taste preferences.  I doubled the recipe and used 14oz of fresh baby spinach and 4 6oz cans of tuna.  I also used the full dozen eggs and it wasn't too eggy for us, and we don't even like egg salad. :)  This was gobbled up by 6 people with none left over.  I did add some fresh ground pepper and a lil salt.

If you try making it the way the recipe states its very good. Its a casserole. One dish meal. No need to add pasta or anything.

I really loved this, DH likes it and wouldn't mind having it again (he's fussy and wouldn't hesitate to say he didn't want it again if he didn't like it). It's different but so good - I made it just as it's written. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was alright, but it's not named quite right.  It should be 'Not Really Tuna Casserole'.  It was almost nothing but spinach when I made it, the single can of tuna in the recipe winding up completely lost beneath all the greens.  I love spinach and cook with it every chance I get but I wanted a tuna casserole and this wasn't very tuna-ish at all.  It also would have come out incredibly thin in a 9x13 so I did it in my favourite Corningware instead and added cooked penne.  It was still alright, while not being great.  But the strange part was that the leftovers that were in the fridge turned into a pretty good pasta salad the next day!  I'll probably keep playing with the recipe as I'm a sucker for a good spinach pasta salad and there's a winner hiding in there somewhere!

I'm always looking for meatless meals that will satisfy for Lent so I decided to give this a shot.  I halved the recipe since only 3 would be eating and I replaced the canned cream of mushroom with homemade.  We liked it and will have it again, but I'll play with the spices a bit, maybe add 1/2 tsp of cayenne or some horseradish, just to "take it from ladylike to manly" as my DS said.  Thanks, JJ

I made this almost to the "T" but I used olive oil instead of butter for the top.My 16 year old daughter loved this.I thought it was just o.k.I wasn't sure what to serve with it, so I baked potatoes and put under casserole.

well...i don't think i would have liked this recipe as it was written, so i added penne pasta and instead of using two packages of spinach and one can of tuna, i used two cans of tuna and one package of spinach. if i ever make it again i think i will leave out the egg because its such a hassle and it didn't add much to the flavor, and maybe i will add some mozzerella cheese.

As far as recipes go, this is good as a base but I think that it needs a lot of work to make it less bland.

When I cooked this, I only used one package of spinach and two cans of tuna. I also used shredded carrot along with the spinach. I skipped the eggs (I thought they were too much of a hassle for what's supposed to be an easy meal), used leftover bits of stuffing instead of bread, replaced most of the butter with olive oil and used other spices (curry powder and red pepper flakes) along with the onion powder to give it more of a kick.

If you want a different twist to tuna casserole, then this is the casserole for you.  Only thing I did different is added less spinach (husband not a big spinach fan).  Once cooked and eaten, we both commented that it needs more spice.  I like the lemon idea, but chopped rosemary would be a great addition to this along with fresh garlic and ms dash possibly.  Will make again, thanks!

I would have given thIS More but really I only used it as a base and played with it a lOT>  I used colby jack cheese, fiesta nacho cheese soup in place of one of the cream of mushrooms, several dashes of tapatio, none of the extra stuff on this recipe but spinach and mixed veggies from my freezer.  used a little milk and lemon juice in place of sour cream...  oh and cooked it on the stove top for a few minutes till it was boiling then let it set with lid on about ten moRE Min so no baking at all.  I was in a hurry..  Lol  there you have there are good ideas here but I didn't follow at all.  oh well

I made this according to the directions with only two exceptions. At first, I didn't notice the 12oz part of the can of tuna, so I mistakenly only bought one 5oz can. So back to the store for two more cans that size, a little bit more than the recipe called for. Also, the spinach at my store was in 14oz bags. I used two. I figured that balanced the extra 3oz of tuna. I will definitely make this again. Delicious casserole without the need for noodles or rice - quite filling on its own. I will be mixing the leftovers with cold spinach rotini for my lunches. There was plenty leftover. Thanks for sharing this recipe, BlondeJJ!

We were going away for sometime so I had to use up the ingredients in the fridge and freezer. I came across this recipe of which I had most of the ingredients. I made it up with the addition of 1/2 a tomato, 1/2 onion (cut down the onion powder) and 2 spring onions  and the juice of a lemon (to use up the bits and pieces in the fridge).
My DH doesn't particularly like spinach or tuna so I was prepared for a bit of resistance at the table - he LOVED it! Even going back for the remaining little bit in the casserole dish. This will be a fave and its quite healthy as well. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was a good way for me to use up all those Easter eggs and leftover rolls. I added 1 more egg than the recipe called for (I have a TON of hard boiled eggs!) and used fresh spinach that I partially cooked in the microwave. My husband and I are big mushroom fans, so I added a can of them as well. It turned out eggcellent.

Total hit for at work 4th of july party! I decreased the soup to 1 1/2 cans , added 8 large eggs, and made sure i defrosted and squeezed water from spinach because someone had commented it was too runny. I used about 1/2 loaf sara lee artesian bread on top drizzled with butter.

Very tasty dish! I made this using fresh spinach and followed the recipe as written. The only thing I would change is to use 1 can of soup mix instead of two. Two cans made the dish too runny for my taste. This would make an excellent side dish as well. As for my kids, my daughter had 3 helpings so I know it's a keeper.

I followed the recipe, except used onions instead of onion powder. They were the only thing that gave it substance. It was mushy like spinach dip, and that's how it would be best served; in a bread bowl as a dip. It is definitely not an entree. I will not make it for a meal again.
