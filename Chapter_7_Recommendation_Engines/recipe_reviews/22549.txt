This is a simple very easy to use recipe. I used a piece of sewing thread to cut my cake. Just get enough thread to go around the cake, and long enough to grab at the ends, make sure it's in the middle of the cake then cross the end strings and pull, then you have an even cut. This dessert was so tasty it was gone in 1 day.:) EXCELLENT!!!!!!

Baking is my specialty and I've made ALOT of from-scratch cakes....I followed this recipe exactly and didn't think it was that great. The cake and filling were both bland, bland, bland.  The texture of the cake was great but the taste was not nearly as good as other cake recipes I have made.

I used a piece of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan and the cake came out perfectly. The cake sliced in half beautifully as I used a piece of dental floss that another reviewer suggested. This is a wonderful recipe. The rich chocolate flavour of the cake and filling are not too sweet which is always my biggest challenge when looking for recipes. We did not find this bland in the least and have given this recipe a permanent place in our collection.

It tasted VERY good.  I followed the directions exactly.  My only complaint is that the cake cracked on top during baking.  It is chocolatey (like milk chocolate), but does not have a STRONG chocolate taste (like a semi-sweet).

Awesome cake. Didn't look the greatest as my attempt at slicing wasn't the best but a chocolate lover's dream that's for sure. Went fast.

Served this dessert to a party of six and both couples contacted me later for the recipe.  We realy enjoyed it.

NOTE: I had a sticking issue with the cake, so I improvised and called it a Boston Creme Pie Crumble cake.  The top layer was made of moist crumbled pieces, and it worked great.  The glaze soaked into the pieces, but it did not deteriorate the taste in the slightest.

Outstanding cake. I only had an 8-inch cake pan so I had to lower the temp and cook it 10 min longer. Best chocolate cake ever!

BLAH, could have used a box cake & pudding for what it tasted like. My husband said that it was nothing spectacular. I would have rated it a 2, but my husband thought it was average so should make it a 3. Won't make again.

After everyone tried this cake, I swear that I put 'MARTHA' to shame!
Just a little tricky to cut the cake in half (I used a bundt pan) and I also couldn't get the filling thick enough.  It ended up being messy, but absolutely delicious!

This cake is fantastic.  It took longer to make that I estimated, but it was worth it in the end.  For the icing, I substitued honey for the corn syrup.  For the pudding layer I substitued skim milk for the light cream which probably accounts for the problems I had making it thick.  Overall a great result!

To help contain this "cake"  I use a "store bought" chocolate crust!  I double the amount of custard and cook the cake in two 8" pans (reducing the baking time to 24 minutes).  The layering is: pie crust, half custard, cake, remaining custard, cake, then glaze.  I get rave reviews for this pie.

I agree with SHIMMERCHK - cake was nothing to write home about. I followed recipe exactly, and was not overly impressed. It tasted good, but not great. I've made better homemade cakes. I served it for Thanksgiving, and everyone liked it, but didn't ask for seconds. I don't think I'll make it again.

I found the instructions simple and easy to follow.  My husband was thrilled with the results.
He asked that I enter it into my personal recipes and to definitely make it again - and soon!

Excellent recipe! I made this (with assistance from my 10 and 5 year old boys) for my father in law's birthday. He's a Boston Cream Pie fanatic and was very impressed with this variation. Easy to make using many ingredients already in our cupboard. Just allow enough time to cool the cake and filling before assembling. Also, be sure to allow time for the cake to remain in the fridge before serving time. Kudos!

Really great recipe! The cake was so moist, the filling was perfectly creamy, and the glaze came out great, too. I used half & half instead of light cream (couldn't get it)and it was super. And not only were the taste and texture great, but it made a beautiful presentation.

Tasted good, but it made such a huge mess and took much too long to cook for what it was. I ended up having to make 3 batches of glaze just to cover the top of the cake and the filling tasted exactly like jello chocolate pudding instant mix; I could have saved myself a lot of time!

I love the flavor of this cake! It's not too sweet and you can really appreciate the 
chocolate. I had a hard time cutting the cake in half, so it wasn't the prettiest, 
but it was definitely the tastiest chocolate cake I've had.

I made this cake to celebrate my boyfriend's 32 on his ACT. I had never baked a cake from scratch before in my life, and I didn't know what was meant by "light cream". I couldn't find it, so I used whipped cream. (Yeah, I don't cook much) It was pretty runny in the middle, but the cake sopped it up making it really moist. My boyfriend loved it so much he came back after work to take the left-over pieces home!

This cake was wonderful!  Chocolate, but not overwhelmingly strong.  And sweet, too.  I had trouble with the glaze thickening, but the bottom layer soaked it up making it even moister.  The filling would be great for a chocolate pie for those that don't like a strong, bitter chocolate taste.

This cake was really disappointing. I had very high expectations. My husband loves Boston Cream Pies and I am a chocoholic. This was just… not very good at all.

I just made this and it is great!  The cake is very moist and spongy and I'll use it for other fillings and frostings.  I substituted canned milk and it came out fine.  Also, its a really nice looking dessert.

Wonderful recipe....one of the best chocolate cakes I've tried.....I did make some changes like using the filling as the frosting too and covering the whole cake with toasted crushed pecans....it gave some nice texture to the whole thing.

This cake was great, but the only problem I had was cutting it into two layers. It cracked right in two after trying to cut it in half, so I ended up making another layer. It ended up being a double layer cake.

I've made this several times now.  It's very easy, and delicious.  Follow the recipe exactly, and be patient.  Allow the cake to cool completely as well as the pudding/filling.  Not sure why other reviewers say its bland.  Every time I serve it, people are fighting over the last piece.  I sprinkled the top with fresh grated chocolate this last version.  Also looks great with a white chocolate drizzle.

Absolutely DIVINE!!  Everyone loved it! I just finished making the recipe again, but this time I divded up the batter into cupcake tins and then sliced each in half to make 24 little cream cakes-very elegant!

Fabulous recipe!  I've made it several times, including a couple for small birthday celebrations and there are never any leftovers.  It's so good, I tried to double it once for a bigger party, which created a salvageable mistake: delicious, chunky chocolate pudding in bowl.  So I recommend making the recipe exactly as written.
