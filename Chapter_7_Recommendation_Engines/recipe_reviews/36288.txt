This dish is simple and tasty. My boyfriend really enjoyed it and he doesn't like pork much. Ladies make this for your man.

Excellent!  The pork stayed tender and juicy and the flavor was wonderful.  It wasn't very spicy either.  I was able to serve it to my 21-month old.  Will definitely make this one again.

Good recipe.  I couldn't find the McCormick marinade at the grocery store, so I substituted a dry jamaican jerk marinade.  So, I assume the original recipe will be just as tasty.

Caribbean marinade is hard to find in our rural area, so I used Southwest marinade.  Very tasty.  Next time, I would grill it 20 instead of 30 minutes.

I also had a difficult time finding the McCormick® Grill Mates® Spicy Caribbean Marinade. I found with the dry gravey mixes and such.  I have seen it more often lately but recently bought a few extras just in case. The pork gets nice & crispy outside but moist and flavorful inside. Just the right spiciness. I highly reccommend it.
