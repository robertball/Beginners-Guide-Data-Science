I did change it up a little, putting the water in the pot prior to the addition of heat.

Fantastic recipe! I've never seen such a great recipe for hot boiling water. I tripled the recipe so I'd have some leftovers and took the suggestion of several other reviewers and froze the leftover hot boiling water! It worked beautifully and my family was amazed. Thank you so much for this creative idea! Never would have thought of it. :)

Excellent recipe. I covered the pot, however.

I’ve been wanting to try this recipe for years. I finally got the guts to make it tonight. I’m so glad I did! I made it exactly how the recipe recommends. The kids loved it too!
