This is my all-time favorite allrecipies recipe- I have made it 4 times in the last year- for parties and just for a quiet dinner - and it comes out fabulous every time! it always puts me in a carribbean mood! one hint - when going to light the rum (I use malibu rum instead of dark) make sure the mixture simmering over heat- or it won't light. I haven't tried it with the bananas and I always serve it over white rice

My husband loved this recipe and wanted me to make it again the very next night. I used coconut cream rather than coconut milk (not sure if there is much of a dfference) and I forgot the bananas but the recipe was still very good.

A TON of flavor in this recipe. When making this we didn't use the banana but it was fantastic. We had a lot of left over sauce and for next time we will probably double the amount of rice and chicken used to even out the flavor a bit.

It was delicious! BUT...beware when setting the chicken on fire! My boyfriend and I almost set the kitchen on fire because it BURNS very QUICKLY and the flames will RISE very HIGH!! Try doing it outside or at least make sure you have enough room for the burning chicken. I will def make this again but I'll add some more flavor to it. I'm sure a pinch of thyme and a dash of pimento will make it 5-star.

This recipe was okay-- a little too much of the same flavour though. I prefer just regular mushroom cream sauce over my chicken and rice. Also you might want to remember to drain the chicken after cooking it in the pan-- otherwise flambeing could become a little dangerous.

First I sat the fire alarm off for the first time in my life. Second the recipe didn't have any flavor.

Too much pepper. Suggest cutting pepper back to 1 tsp. Substituted pineapple for banana
