I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving and its wonderful.  I use quick oats instead of breadcrumbs in the topping and less flour.  Similar to the topping for an apple crisp.
If you like traditional apple pie, you will love this!

This was a great recipe.  I was looking for something a little different from your traditional cranberry apple pie and this definately fit the bill.  I altered the recipe a little bit, these are the things I changed:
- I used about 1/2 of the sugar called for (it was sweet enough like that) 
- I used 1/3 cup maple syrup to give it a little more maple taste
- I used pecans instead of walnuts
- I didn't use the topping, but topped it with another pie crust.
I did not have any problems with it being too much as some of the other reviews, it was just the right size.  Even my husband who doesn't like cranberries liked this pie! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing and Scrumptious!!!  This recipe made it to my all-time favorites collection.  I can't help but vary a recipe, so I added a sprinkling of cinnamon to the topping, and replaced some of the breadcrumbs with wheatgerm (for a little extra nutrition).  YUM!  By the way, though, the recipe makes enough topping for 2 pies and since I used large Granny Smith apples, there was enough filling for 2 pies as well.

I have been making this pie for quite some time now (don't know why I didn't review it before now!) and it's consistently amazing.  In fact, this is my most requested pie, and I make a variety of pies!  The balance in this recipe is just perfect - the right amount of tartness, sweetness, crunch - everything.  I don't change a thing about it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is a delicious pie.  This was the first pie I ever made and it turned out wonderfully!  I used 1 cup of fresh cranberries and one cup of Craisins and I only used approximately 3 apples (a mix of granny smith, golden delicious, and gala).  The filling was delicious and I was eating that all by itself.  I do have to say that the topping makes way too much for one pie and cutting it was difficult because the topping crumbled too much.  Next time, I would basically use the same recipe with maybe one more apple and make two pies from it.  The taste is delicious!  I never realized that pies are not that difficult and am excited to try other ones from this website.  Thanks!  :-)

Everyone at my Thanksgiving dinner loved this pie. I only made a couple of minor changes. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg in the filling to make it more similar to a regular apple pie and it was delicious. I also made a lattice-type top crust on top of the crumb topping (using strips of pre-made pie crust) brushed with egg white for shine & sprinkled with white sugar for looks.

I thought next time it may be fun to experiment with the maple syrup content and add a little bit more to see how it comes out.

I served this at Thanksgiving and EVERYONE absolutely loved it!  I created a topping of oats, flour, butter and a pinch of cinnamon.  The pie was sweet and had a wonderful crunch from the walnuts.

Excellent.  Not as tart as I feared it might be.  The maple syrup adds a nice hint of flavor.  Everyone loved it at Christmas dinner.  Topping browned up slightly crunchy to add a nice texture.  Good food!

I made this pie for Christmas Eve.  It was very easy.  I also used oats instead of bread crumbs and it was very good.  I did notice that the crumb topping was a bit loose... will add a bit more butter next time.  I used pre-made frozen pie shells and actually got two pies out of this recipe.  Anyway, it is delicious and I would definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe, which certainly deserves 5 stars, even though it turned out different from what I had expected. Thank you for sharing!  I 1-1/2-folded the recipe (except the topping, as other reviewers had already written that this is almost enough for two pies) and made two pies. I substituted quick oats for the bread crumbs in the topping. I used "Grandma Ruth's Pie Crust" from this site (1/2 the amounts in the recipe, and whole grain flour), and spiced it up with 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and a tablespoon of rum. Very yummy!  For my taste, the cranberry-apple filling is a bit too sweet, but my husband and the kids loved it. Next time, I will reduce the sugar to about 3/4  or 1 cups.  I also think that the baked pie tasted a bit like plum pie, maybe adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mixture wasn't a good idea.   Next time, I will not add the apples to the cranberries and cook them, but prepare the cranberry filling, and then add spoonfuls of apples and cranberry filling to the pie, without blending them. Maybe then I will get a taste as I expected it to be.  The topping is great with oats, I sprinkled it with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, which gave it a refreshing twist. I also forgot to add the nuts to the filling, so I put them onto the pie before the topping, so that the nuts were "roasted" while baking, which turned out to be great!  Perhaps next time, I will also add some mini chocolate morsels to the topping, I think the kids will like it.

OK, I'm starting the low carb tomorrow, I swear.  But I will never start it with this pie in the house!  My husband makes pies and his signature pie is his apple pie.  However, around the holidays we like to add a little variety and this is just the recipe we're going to use to spice up the pie business!  Thank you for the submission.

Delicious!  I love the tart flavor the cranberries add to the sweetness of the traditional apple pie.  I don't even like apple pie, but couldn't stop eating this!  It's definitely a CRANBERRY-apple pie, not apple-cranberry.  Next time I'll probably use a few less cranberries, but loved it anyway!

This pie is fantastic! I've made it twice now and we gobble it up. :) I definitely need a deep dish crust for the filling and like others subbed oats for the bread crumbs. Thanks for a delicious recipe! I'm sure it would be great with the bread crumbs; we just prefer the oats. :)

Honestly, the best pie I have ever made. Everyone was so impressed.  I also used oats instead of breadcrumbs and it came out yummy.  I will say though, that it is pretty messy to cut and serve but well worth it! Thank you!

Well I started this pie and I was little unsure if I could pull this off. I followed the recipe as stated. All I have to say is WOW! My family really never eats apple pie, but they gobbled this all up. Making 2 more tomorrow for friends that were over! Thanks!

I liked the filling of this pie, but the breadcrumbs on top was strange and there seemed too be way too much crumb topping. This was very easy to make, but I think I will just put another crust on top next time, or try the oats like other reviewers suggest. I give the filling 5 stars but as written I give the recipe a 3.

This was the first time I have cooked with whole cranberries and choosing this recipe was perfect.  The only change I made was the previously suggested oats instead of bread crumbs and that made it ideal.  I did everything else just as the recipe says and we love it!!  I will definately be making this pie again very soon.  I am on the lookout for cranberries on sale in my local gracery store.  Kimm

I just finshed making this pie for the second time and have only adjusted the sugar down to 1 cup from 1.25 cups. I am using this pie to barter for tamales for Christmas dinner.

I baked this as a fruit crumble/cobbler, and it was delicious!  To save on calories and time, I topped the fruit with oats, brown sugar, margarine, wheat germ, and a little maple syrup.
I made the filling as the recipe said, just adding a little lemon juice to the fruit.

The filling for this pie is one of the most delicious I have ever had!  It was just the perfect amount of tart mixed with sweet.  Had a little too much crumb topping, and I think when I make it again I might add more brown sugar and cinnamon to the topping.  Also, I used a mixture of mostly Granny Smith apples but red apples too.  Overall, this was a great recipe, and I will make it over and over again.

Wonderful pie!  I love serving this rather than plain apple.  My husband thought it was a little too tart, but my guests disagreed.  Depends on how much you like cranberries I guess.  I thought it was perfect just the way it is.

this was great! people loved it!--- however, i had wayyy too much of the crumb topping left, like more than half of what the recipe calls for. 

also, i used about ten apples, not five.

the results were fantastic.

WOW! This is really yummy. Not sure if I am loving the walnuts though. I think pecans may go better. Also, the filling is enough for almost 2 pies. Next time I will use one 9" "deep dish" pie crust or cut the recipe down if I use a regular 9". It is quite sweet, so I may try cutting back a bit on the sugar as well the next time I make it.

Awesome!  I made a few changes because one of my children is a picky eater, so I omitted the walnuts from the pie filling, and borrowed another recipe's streusel (The Brown Family's Pumpkin Pie, from this site)for the topping, using chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I added a couple more apples and it was plenty for two pies.  My family LOVED it!  It is a definite keeper!

This is an excellent recipe for Cheistmas. 
However the given recipe was enough to fill two 9" deep crusts. Now i have one frozen for future use.

This turned out pretty good. I made the filling as indicated, but used frozen piecrusts for the bottom and top crusts. It was slight more tart than I expected (even with all the sugar). I think next time I will replace the maple syrup with Karo syrup, as I think the maple adds a slight odd note to the pie.

This is yummy!  It's more like a twist on apple crisp than apple pie, in my opinion.  I wasn't sure I was going to like it because I scorched the sugar a bit while cooking it, which gave everything a not-so-appetizing smell.  I used 6 2-1/2" Macintosh apples and had just the right amount of filling.  I added extra sugar to the crumb topping because I used whole wheat flour and breadcrumbs, and it turned out delicious - I used up the leftovers on oatmeal.  The combination of apples, cranberries, and walnuts in this dish is great.  It was good warm with vanilla ice cream, but I preferred it cold the next night.  Will make this again!

The only thing I changed is I sprinkled the topping with cinnamon and sugar when it was done. It got great reviews from my family at our Christmas dinner.

I made this pie yesterday for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  I was looking for a pie to use some apples and frozen cranberries and this worked really well.  As far as comments about the quantity of filling and topping . . .I find sometimes the ingredients listed are a bit nebulous.  "Five apples" can vary wildly depending on their size!  So . . .

 I used three Granny Smith apples but I measured them as I sliced.  My pie used 3 cups of sliced apples and all other ingredients in quantities listed for the filling.  This made just the right amount for my pie plate which is 10" in diameter.

Additionally, I consulted another baking book about the topping.  Yes, indeed, the topping is enough for two pies.  If you're only making one, cut it in half.

Great winter fruit pie.  I'll make it again!

Very nice pie and the maple syrup gives it an interesting twist. You can taste the syrup per se, but it gives it some depth. I substituted oatmeal for the crackers and it was delicious. I also reduced the sugar in the pie a little because I don't like a super sweet pie.

Perhaps I added too many cranberries -I used the full bag minus a few odd berries...I don't like wasting berries >.>;- but this wasn't what I was expecting...a bit more like cranberry sauce on soft apples than an apple pie with cranberry accents.

I thought this was pretty good, although I would make a few changes the next time I make it.  I used 3 granny smith, 3 golden delicious and 1 gala and I thought that was a perfect amount for the filling.  I would halve the amount of topping I made, threw out a lot of it.  I would not add much sugar to the cranberry mixture, just my preference but I dont usually put sugar in my apple pies.  I would also tweak the topping a bit, make it more interesting.  Maybe use oats, not breadcrumbs, and turn it into more of a crumble topping.

I liked this pie very much, but that's because I like cranberries! My husband didn't like it much at all--thought it was too tart and should have more apple flavoring.

I love this pie! I made it for Thanksgiving this year, and it was a big hit. It's easy to make, but looks and tastes like you fussed.
