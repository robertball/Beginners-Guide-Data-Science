This was fabulous!  To the below reviewer...
OFCOURSE IT WAS LACKING IN LEMON FLAVOR WHEN YOU MADE IT!  YOU LEFT THE LEMON ZEST OUT!  A KEY INGREDIENT!
If people cannot follow a recipe they should not complain about it!  
Stick to the recipe the exact way Carol wrote it and you will not be dissapointed!  Excellent.  :)

I have changed my mind about this recipe.  I followed the suggestions like using half butter and half applesauce, I used lemon yogurt, I doubled the lemon zest and lemon juice and I iced it with lemon icing and it came out moist and a wonderful lemon flavor.  I usually don't comment after I do so many alterations, but this one turned out a real winner with the changes...moist, nice lemon flavor and the lemon icing was the "icing on the cake!"

I made this today for my 2 year old son's birthday. We wanted something a little lighter to stray away from the heavy Christmas cookies and sweets and this was just right. I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour (omitting 2 tbsp per cup as recommended by this site) and used lemon yogurt instead of plain. It has the right amount of lemon flavor and doesn't need a frosting, I just sprinkled confectioner's sugar over the top. A great cake and one to add to my recipe box for the future, thanks.

This was fabulous! Mine was in texture like a pound cake, probably because I used all-purpose flour. I used the zest of 3 lemons and would add another one or 2 next time. I also used half a cup of lemon juice. It tasted even better the next day.

Combine the lemon zest with 1/2 cup sugar in the food processor and grind to bring out even more lemon flavor.

Highly recommended!

Totally Delightful!  I specialize in doing specialty cakes from Birthdays to Weddings and I must say that I am extremely pleased with this recipe.  It is so moist and light and down right delicious.  I drizzled some thin icing/glaze over the top as well as a slight dusting of powdered sugar since the cake on its own was not as sweet as I usually like, but other than that it's perfect!  Just a tip...Don't Throw Away Your Yolks!!  I am so used to separating my eggs and discarding the yolks for making white cake and I wasn't paying attention when realized I had, by habit, thrown away the yolks instead of using them for the first part of the batter...Ughhh!

I have made this many times over the years, sometimes almost exactly as written, sometimes with many changes. It's always good: moist, light, and so lemony. Everyone loves it. These are now my tried and true tweaks to this recipe: Do the step of beating the egg whites and folding them in LAST. Make it super-lemony by using 1/4 cup lemon juice and the zest from two large-ish lemons (for a full recipe). Use only 75% of the sugar (reduce it in the egg yolks mixture of course, not the egg whites). If possible, use Greek yogurt. This cake is HUGE. Easily 16 servings, or a bit more or less depending on preference. Depending on what I had on hand, I have used all butter; margarine/oil /applesauce; margarine/oil; golden shortening. This cake needs no icing! It's delicious by itself.

I made this cake for a Big Fat Greek Party I planned with some friends.  We were supposed to watch My Big Fat Greek Wedding and we all brought some Greek dishes.  We never watched the movie and ate plenty of delicious Greek food.  This cake and the Greek Honey cake from this site were a smash.  I have no complaints and wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Very delicious and light. I used altered all purpose flour (replaced 2Tbs flour with 2Tbs corn starch for each cup). This did not end up anything as dense as a pound cake. Also, I used the zest of two lemons and it turned out perfectly lemony.  My suggestion is to make sure you whip the egg whites properly. Wash all the utensils/bowls properly so there is no residual grease on them. Don't start adding the sugar until you have achieved soft peaks. Keep whipping until stiff glossy peaks and, if you rub the foam between your fingers, you don't feel the sugar. Also, mix in about a third of the egg whites to lighten the stiff batter before trying to fold in the rest. A five star recipe. *EDIT* I've made this recipe again, substituting sour cream for the yogurt, and I think I like it that way even better! I halved the recipe and it made 12 lovely cupcakes.

After poring over the reviews, I adjusted the recipe as follows: zest of 3 good size lemons, 6 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice, about half tsp of lemon extract, and plain greek yogurt.  Baked for 40 minutes in tube pan, and "iced" with a powdered sugar and lemon juice glaze.  Mixed up some sanding sugar and lemon zest, and sprinkled it in a circle on top for presentation. Needless to say, the cake was perfect in appearance, texture, and taste. Everyone loved it!  With all the added lemon in and on the cake, it still was the right lemon flavor - not too much, not too subtle.  I will make this again and again.  It is worth every minute to make.

My wife absolutely loves lemon-based dishes so I made this for her birthday not too long ago. She (and I) loved it so much I've made it a few times now.

Two things I changed: I make sure I use freshly squeezed lemon juice instead of the concentrate from the bottle and I use Greek yogurt. It's a subtle difference but I like the extra little zip.

I enjoyed this cake--added more lemon juice and zest for additional flavor. To those so critical of the reviewer who omitted the lemon zest, please read her profile. She is, at most, 17 years old. (Joined in 2005, profile says she's 12 years old--assuming profile hasn't been updated, photo certainly doesn't appear to be more than 17.) I think she is doing a great job of experimenting and putting herself out there.

Oh my goodness, this is THE BEST cake I have eaten in a LONG time!!!  I made this cake into cupcakes for my daughter's birthday - she wanted a lemon cake, and I didn't want anything "artificial," or that started with a boxed cake mix - and I am sooo glad I used this recipe!!  Very lemony and delicious!!  I topped them with cream cheese frosting and they were fantastic!!  I will say though, if you are a novice and not familiar with making or using meringue in recipes, then this is going to be tougher to execute.  (I've had pastry chef training, and even I occasionally have flubs with meringue.)  But this is worth every bit of time and effort.  And now you know, you can use them for cupcakes too!

As others commented, this cake is a little on the labor intensive side and I used all my mixing bowls but it was well worth it - moist, lemony and delicious! I made it in two 9" cake pans, sliced the layers and used lemon cream cheese icing and blueberries in between. Unbelievable! I trimmed the layers just to have some to all to myselfe while I was icing the cake.

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the yogurt, using 1 cup of lemon yogurt and 1 cup of plain yogurt.  I also increased the lemon zest and added 1 tsp of lemon extact.  This gave it such a wonderful lemon flavor.  I also used a recipe for a raspberry filling and it was delicious with the lemon flavor of the cake! I finished the cake with a lemonade frosting and garnished it with candied lemon slices.  This was for a baby shower and it was beautiful in presentation as well as in taste!  This is a winner!!!

Wow! This will become my standard lemon cake recipe. I used three heaping, packed teaspoons of lemon zest and lemon yogurt and baked the cake in a bundt pan. It was done in exactly 50 minutes. I drizzled it with some lemon glaze and served it to my boyfriend, and avowed "pie guy." He had three servings!

This was very tasty.  Like a few other reviewers, I found it dry which was surprising, considering it had 6 egg yolks and a cup of butter.

I made this recipe using ingredients that I had on hand.  I didn't have any plain yogurt, so I used sour cream ( 1 cup) instead.  This cake turned out really well, only next time I think I will add a little more lemon zest/juice, and I may make a lemon glaze to put on top( I was going to make the glaze for this cake, but while I was letting it cool for a few minutes, it all got eaten!!)  Everyone loved it!!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe---it's definitely a keeper!!

This was a delicious cake!  But like other reviewers, I wish I would have added more lemon!  I iced the cake with a mixture of lemon juice, powdered sugar, and minced lemon zest.  I will be making this again for sure, but with more lemon next time!

Lemon cake with yogurt batter and tart lemon frosting has become a standby in my life. I make this cake when I want an easy crowd-pleaser to take to a party or to feed to friends but don't have the time or attention to spare for anything complicated. I don't think I've ever followed the recipe exactly (for one thing I tend to sub in a fine whole wheat flour for half the flour), and I don't tend to measure my ingredients, but the great thing about this cake is that the basic concept is pretty forgiving; yogurt batters in general tend to be nice and moist, and the yogurt flavour combines perfectly with the lemon. If you've made cake before and mostly know what you're doing, it's hard to screw this up. Thanks for posting this!

It was great! I ran out of cake flour, so I substituted it for 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour and 6 tablespoons of corn starch. My family loved it! Sure to save it and make it again!

I followed the dierections as exactly as I could. I forgot to seperate the whites and the yolks but managed to get about half of the yolks out. I baked for fifty minutes. I'm only 13 and I made this with my sister, who's 9, and it wasn't hard. Though it does take a little while. Everyone loved it but I thought it was a little too much like cornbread. Next time I might do more zest or lemon juice. I had it plain, no icing, and next time I was thinking of doing an icing or a glaze. Great recipie. Thanks! -Paige

Amazing results!! This is definitely an amazing recipe! I love baking and i always wanted to make a beautiful bundt cake and we just happened to end up with a TON of lemons from our tree. What better idea than to make a lemon bundt cake?? Wow, i picked this recipe since i knew the yogurt would give it a great texture. The results were PICTURE PERFECT. I wish i could submit a picture of my wonderful cake but sadly i don't have any camera on hand or any phone that would be easy to get a picture from ): OH well, the cake also tastes wonderful and is very moist, i buttered and and floured my pan and let it cool after taking it out from the oven for 10 min and it slid out like magic!! Not a single crumb stuck. I followed the recipe exactly except for making my own cake flour(and sifting it) since i only had all purpose, and adding about 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 2tsp lemon rind. It smelled very lemony but barely tasted lemony at all! This wasn't a problem though because it was AMAZING either way. If you like it more lemony then add more juice and rind or you could even omit the lemon and just add vanilla extract or imitation vanilla for a nice vanilla cake. Well, i will be making this VERY often as it is fool proof and absolutely delicious. Note: You're batter will be thick, this is perfectly normal. DON'T TRY TO THIN OUT THE BATTER. And remember to fold your beaten egg whites in at the end(:

It was a very labor intensive cake that involved a messy kitchen, but it was worth it!    I will take the suggestions of others and give it more lemon flavor, but adding more zest or by adding the lemon yogurt.    Served with real whip cream and fresh straweberries.   The birthday girl loved it!

A delicious from-scratch lemon cake!  Next time I would add even more lemon zest, and I added an icing of lemon juice and powdered sugar for an even stronger lemon-sweet taste.  I used a bundt pan and it came out just fine after 45 minutes.

I halved this recipe since I didn't want to have too much, and it made a decent-sized sheet cake. To make it healthier, I substituted 75% wheat flour and 25% all-purpose. As for the egg whites, I had to look it up - if whipping by hand, always use a large and perfectly clean, dry bowl, metal or glass; let the egg whites get to room temp; don't let even a little yolk get in the whites; and stiffen them with some salt at first and a quarter way through beating them, a few drops of lemon juice or cream of tartar. Although I couldn't get the whites to stiffen completely because I accidentally got some yolk in, it still peaked well enough after about 10 minutes. Lastly, I added the juice of 1 normal-sized lemon and the zest of 1 1/2 lemons, which is far more than the recipe calls for but gave it a strong lemon flavor. The cake came out perfectly moist and was great glazed with a lemon (juice and zest), sugar and butter mix.

I had to make mine in a 9x13 because I don't have a tube pan and it did fine. It came out super moist, partly because I added about 1/4 cup more yogurt, because I really like moist cakes.

I also just put a bit of a glaze over it rather than frost - just heated some lemon juice and sugar up and poured it over. 

Friends and coworkers all loved it.

This was a lovely cake. It had a light spongy texture and the 2 lemons I used provided a light lemon flavour to the cake. The yogurt gives it an additional tangy flavour. I experimented with 3 different pans: 1) Mini muffin pan 2) Small madeleine pan 3) 9" bundt pan When pans 1+2 came out of the oven (around 13 min. baking time), the cakes had crispy tops and very moist soft insides. After cooling, the crust lost the crispiness and became soft and sticky (like most cakes) and the cake interiors were drier). I baked the batter for 40 min. in the bundt pan as I'd already used some of it in the smaller pans. The result was the same: after cooling down, the cake had a soft sticky top and drier insides. It reminds me of a chiffon cake actually. I really love this cake and will make it again. Poppy seeds also adds another yummy dimension to this recipe. =)

I teach high school Foods classes, and had my students make this cake for a parent night that we had at school.  My students made this cake, then I made a lemon buttercream for it.  THE BEST CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  I was so proud to serve it to parents as a way of showing off what we do in my class.  Fabulous.

I doubled up this recipe and baked it as a 6" and 10" round for a wedding cake, and filled it with a raspberry filling.  It was a huge success. Very good. Durable, and yet light, and stays wonderfully moist.

This cake is very yummy. Nice, light, and fluffy. The next time make this, I will use more lemon zest to give more lemon flavor. I, also, used lemon flavored yogurt. A tip: beat the egg whites after creaming the butter so that they will keep stiff. Also, use a very large bowl when folding your egg whites to keep the fluff!

Lovely cake that worked great with a lemon buttercream icing. I added a bit of lemon extract for more lemony flavor, but it would have been fine without. This recipe goes into my "keepers" file.

Delicious! And SO moist! I made 1/3 of the recipe and got 12 cupcakes. I also used AP flour (1 c cake flour = 1 c minus 2 Tbsp AP flour for those of you who want to do the same) and added a bit more lemon juice as others suggested. Topped them with a lemon glaze, blueberries, and raspberries. Will definitely pass this recipe along to family and friends!

I followed the recipe to a tee and it was just shy of being 100% perfect, in that the lemon juice and zest, in my opinion, could have been increased. I will also add lemon extract as well as previous reviewers have done. However I still will give it 5 stars. The texture of the cake was incredible, and I received so many complements! I will definately bake this cake again.

I like this recipe.  Instructions were clear.  I took the tip of previous reviews and added more zest and juice.  I used two 9" round pans and baked for 50 minutes.  Next time I will test cake at 40 minutes because it I think will be a bit moister with less baking in these pans and I should have realised this. Maybe some lemon pudding in the mix may make it a wee bit moister as well.  My son loved it and wants it for his next birthday party!

This cake has kind of a muffin texture to it.  I doubled the lemon juice and zest, which was a very good decision!  We added butter instead of frosting while it was still warm out of the oven.  Next time, I think I'll make some sort of a lemon and butter glaze to drizzle over it.  Mmmm...

A beautiful and delicious cake!!  I only gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes, based on other reviews.  Instead of 1 cup of plain yogurt, I used two 6oz cups of lemon yogurt (I used Stoneyfield Farm, because it's not as sweet as some others, but that's just personal preference).  I also didn't measure the amount of lemon juice or zest, just used the juice/zest of three lemons.  My husband thought it was a little TOO lemon-y, but our guests loved it.  I baked in in two round 8" pans, and layered it with strawberry preserves.  DELICIOUS!  The only complaint I have is the amount of dishes I had to do afterwards because of all the mixing bowls!

I loved this cake! I did cook it for only 50 minutes as per suggestions and it turned out well. I thought it was not a very sweet cake and was perfect. I don't like super sweet cakes. I would suggest more lemon zest or a little more lemon juice if you especially like lemon as the lemon flavor was light. I topped it with a frosting of mixed whipped cream, lemon zest and powdered sugar. I did substitute buttermilk for yogurt, but that's a pretty even substitution (and it was what I had around). Great job Carol!

This was a terrific lemon cake - very light.  I made it in two round cake pans and made a thick (think lemon curd thickness) lemon sauce and a raspberry sauce that I mixed with prepared Dream Whip and layered it with these two - raspberry in between and lemon on top.  Had to keep in the fridge, but it was delicious!

WOW!  I halved this recipe and it turned out really well (and moist!).  For the halved recipe, I used the zest and juice of three lemons.  Other than that, and the cooking time, I followed the recipe.

Moist and delicious!  Takes a little time to make, but worth it!  I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to pump up the lemon flavor.  It was still a mild lemon taste, but it's yummy!  Thanks!

Great cake! I made sure to beat the egg whites very well. Maybe some other raters did not do so or maybe they did not separate their eggs! I followed the recipes to a TEE, and then added some lemon extract and it was a beautiful, light cake. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it again!

This cake is most lemony if you use lemon yogurt and add more lemon zest, like 3tsp.  Very good taste, but I think it is similar to a lemon poundcake despite whipping the egg  whites. A crowd pleaser. A nice change for a crowd pleaser cake.

Everyday ingredients; nothing exotic or hard-to-find (or expensive). Easy to assemble. I'd say this is a fairly "forgiving" recipe: I only had medium eggs on hand, rather than large - I used six, it worked fine. I had coconut yogurt already opened, so I used that in place of the plain - worked fine. The cake has a mild flavor (like some poundcakes) and is good for spooning fruit over; might try serving it with a fruit-flavored or lemon-flavored yogurt as a topping.

made this cake for easter.  Served with fresh strwberries and sherbet.  Everyone liked it lots, but me.  I knew something wasn't quite right.  I substituted all purpose flour for cake flour as per a reviewers remarks.  Well just found out I had the substitution wrong.  REMEMBER if your going to subst. flours it's 1 cup all purpose flour minus 2 T.  I only subtracted 1 T.  So I've got to try it again.  I used lemon yogurt instead of plain and still it wasn't very lemony.  So I'll add more lemon flavor next time.  But still everyone liked it.  But not better than my poppyseed cake.  So I have to try this again.

I made this cake in two square layer pans. It turned out great. However, my pans are glass so the cake had a little difficulty leaving the pans after cooling. I will adjust next time. Despite that, the cake is amazing. It has a 'sponge' like quality to it. It's 'fluffy'.  I liked the texture of the cake so much, I will try to convert the recipe from lemon to chocolate later.

Since I made it in layers, I used the frosting from the Lemon Cake with Lemon Filling and Lemon Butter Frosting recpie found here.  This cake with that Lemon Butter Frosting is a great match if you like lemon cakes with frosting and sweetness to them. However, the cake can stand on its own with a simple topping or none at all. This is most definately a keeper.

A lemony delight!  I served this topped with some whipped cream and berries and got rave reviews.  It is similar to a pound cake in texture, but lighter.  I'll keep this recipe handy.

The cake was delicious. it was a bit dense. I frosted and filled it with lemon filling, which was amazing. I also cut back a little on the sugar.

Perfect "disappear in your mouth" cake.  Fresh lemons were not overbearing.  I didn't have fresh lemons. So, I used lemon juice and 1 Tbsp of lemon extract.  I topped it off with dried poppy seed.  Oh so nice!  I do admit its a tad bit labor intensive but worth it.

Great cake! I used a bundt pan since I don't have a tube pan. I used Greek yogurt, all purpose flour less 2 tbs per cup, and 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the butter. I dusted with powdered sugar and it was terrific....even the kids liked it!

I made this as written, only subbing all-purpose and cornstarch for the cake flour. It is amazing! I've finally found my base birthday cake recipe. Thank you!!!! It's moist, fluffy and lemony today, I can't wait to see how much better it is tomorrow!!

I read all of the reviews before making as it was my boyfriends 35th bday and I wanted his cake to be awesome. THIS IS AMAZING! I am super happy with it, made some adjustsments per reviewers, I upped the lemon juice to almost half a cup, and used lemon yogurt as suggested. I also cut the sugar, just a little bit. I will keep this in my recipe box for future use. Not sure what the reviewer who said it was dry had problems with. I baked in two 9 inch cake pans, very moist.

will make again. Used the zest of 2 lemons and 1 lime and increased the quantity of lemon juice to 3 tbsp. A shot glass of Midori (melon liqueur)  rounded this off nicely!

I saw this recipe here and made it for my wife's birthday. She requested a cake with lemon. Everyone loved it, from senior citizens down to the toddlers. (An 11 year old groaned when he saw it, saying "There's no frosting". His mom said, "it's an adult cake" Said 11 year old inhaled his piece and i later caught him picking crumbs from the empty cake plate). For time reasons I had to make it Friday evening and let it stand until Sunday. l let it cool in the pan and then put plastic wrap over the top. Held up nicely. Like others, i also put in much more lemon than called for - at least tripple. Sunday morning i heated up about 1/4-1/3 cup honey with a little more lemon juice and spooned it over the top as it sat in the pan. Right before serving I did same again. That added some extra sweetness and moistness. i will make this again. As some said, it is a little extra work but it's the kind of work we like and always for a good cause. It is kind of the desert counterpart to avgolemeno soup - light yet hearty.

First off, Paige, I am proud of you for trying this recipe at your age!  You rock.  It is always a pretty good idea to stick exactly to the plan, and if you ever do this again, if you will try that, I'll bet it turns out as magnificently as mine did!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! Also, I am still incredulous that an ADULT baker left OUT the lemon zest, then complained this did not taste lemony enough!  What a hoot! This cake is outstanding!  Thanks so much for posting it!

Light and lemony and just perfect for a warm cup of coffee and a good book! I used margarine istead of butter and it came out fine. I also drizzled a simple powdered sugar/lemon juice frosting on top and the extra tanginess was just lovely. Yum! Love it!

A fair amount of work compared to some cakes on this site, but definitely worth it for taste and because it's different. I used lemon icing, from this site, to top it and it was a delicious and different birthday cake for my husband. Thanks!

We used 2 cups of lemon yogurt and added 1 tsp lemon extract as well.  The result was fully cooked at 55 minutes.  It was moist, dense, lemony, and satisfying.  But...a simpler recipe may also have yielded a nice lemon cake.

I used yellow fresh-off-the-tree limes from the backyard and added an extra lime for luck (also because I wanted the zest and didn't want to waste the lime). I was also eating dinner while baking the cake. It was burnt, but inside, it was still so moist, light, and tasty. I like baking even though I'm not good at it, but this was the first cake I've made outside of a box mix that didn't turn out so dense. Great recipe. Next time will be perfect!

I agree with a previous reviewer.  Lemon zest is definitely needed for the full lemon flavor.  Also, the use of yogurt will not make the texture of the cake "dense".

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I added more lemon rind and lemon juice just to give it a more lemony taste.  It was moist and a big hit for everyone.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Loved the texture & taste of this "not so sweet" cake.  I did half the recipe, baking it in an 8" square pan.  I was looking for a recipe to accompany lemon curd made recently. They paired up as an absolute winner!

Really good lemon cake! Not too sweet. Halved the recipe and made 12 perfect cupcakes (17 minutes to bake), but used the full amount of lemon juice and lemon zest with some meyer lemons we got. I also used vanilla yogurt and would continue to use a sweetened yogurt in this recipe. I would use more lemon zest next time and maybe more juice for a stronger lemon flavor. The batter looked dense when I was scooping into the cupcake tin but they are fluffy and delicious. Will definitely make again!

I made this cake with my nephew for his birthday. He wanted a strawberry lemonade cake so I double up on the zest and lemon juice (we incorporated the strawberry in the frosting.) The texture and flavor of the cake were exactly what we were looking for. Not heavy but not too airy either. I usually use sour cream to keep my cakes moist but used plain Greek yogurt for this and was very pleased with the result.

This was good but seemed like a lot of extra trouble for what comes out like a pound cake. I would have liked it to be lighter and fluffier. Used lemon zest and juice as directed but it needed some added lemon extract for a more lemony taste.

I tripled both zest and juice and replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce and found the cake okay. It  was too heavy and very bland. Not worth making.

It tastes good but I doubled the amount of lemon zest and added some extra lemon juice and it still isn't super lemony. You can tell it is a lemon cake but I was hoping for something more. It also tastes eggy. I think once it has lemon frosting on it it will be good.

I was very disapointed in this cake, It was dry and not very lemony. I wish I would have read more reviews, and the cook time is way off. mine was done in 40 minutes and still came out dry. This is not a keeper sorry.

Beautiful recipe. Fairly easy to make and it tastes very good. Wouldn't change a thing except maybe save beating the egg whites until the end of the recipe instead of the beginning.

I made this for a family BBQ and it wasn’t that bad, but to me and my mom it tasted a lot like cornbread. :/…overall though for my very first cake it wasn’t a complete flop. I didn’t have any plain yogurt so I had to sub with sour cream. The lemon flavor is really dull; the next time I make this I’ll try the lemon yogurt or add some more lemon juice/zest; maybe some extract too. It passed by my grandmother though, so that's a plus :D

Excellent. You'll need a large angel food pan. I followed the recipe exactly and made a full bundit for work and a smaller angel food for home.  It was the perfect light ending for a large meal.

Definitely add more lemon zest and lemon juice. I also used cream cheese frosting with lemon juice added. The cake is really delicious, but not super sweet or lemony as-is. With about a Tbsp of zest and juice of one lemon, and some richer frosting, it's great.

This has very good flavor. I ended up having to use half lemon and half lime zest as I didnt have enough lemon and I baked it in a square baking dish. It still turned out great. I add some key lime juice to my frosting which added a kick. I think this cake is great! Not sure why it didnt turn out for others......but I do know its important to follow the recipe exactly if you expect it to turn out good!

Cut the serving size in half, but left the lemon zest and lemon juice amounts as they were. Used lemon yogurt. Turned out wonderuful! Moist and lemony, not too tart! Will certainly make this again!

this cake was great, not dry at all.  i baked mine in a bundt pan.  i used lime juice and lime zest because i didn't have any lemons. i added 2T extra juice.  next time i will bake it for 5 min. less.

The lemon flavor really bursts from the cake.  Very clean tasting, light.  Very difficult to stir together after the egg whites were added.  Not sure the taste warrants all the effort involved.  Is even better if you mix 1cup of confectioners sugar with 1 1/2-2 Tablespoons lemon juice and you drizzle it over the top after it cools completely.

Cake is indeed light and delicious. Baking time took a lot longer though, I added about 20 minutes more, and the inside is still a bit wet... it is that moist. Since I wanted a stronger lemon taste, I added 1 tsp of lemon extract. Very fine textured cake. Next time, would reduce the sugar a little. Thank you for posting.

I made this cake for my aunt's birthday and it turned out very good!  It was fairly dense like a pound cake but not too dry.  I would recommend baking on the shorter side- I left mine in for 5 mins. too long.  I used a bundt pan and topped it with a simple but yummy cream cheese frosting and tons of strawberries and rasberries.  GREAT!  The creamy frosting didn't take over the lemony taste and added a sweet flavour.  Would use this recipe again!

This is a nice light and fluffy cake. I only used the rind from one lemon but it really needs 2 to give it a real lemon flavour. Took a full hour on fan bake to cook but it made a HUGE cake.

This was not even a “good”cake.  I chose it based on the reviews and it was pretty disappointing.  Heavy texture, not good lemon flavor (yes, I added the extra zest), and it was dry!  I’m an experienced baker and I did everything right and followed the recipe.  I even used a bundt pan and it was still dry!  I gave 2 stars because this recipe requires extra work and ingredients for NO reason!

This is the first time I've ever made cake from scratch!  It tasted amazing, definitely very poundcake-y. I can't find cake flour anywhere (I live in a teeny town in rural Louisiana) so I was stuck with all purpose flour. In batter form I felt the lemon was a little light, so I added about a teaspoon of lemon extract to punch it up. Gently folding the merengue in was next to impossible because the batter was super thick... like biscuit batter. So I just mixed as best I could.  The sugar carmelized and left a wonderful crusty outside.  I made mini bundts, reduced the cook time to 40minutes.  Love this!

Very tasty lemon pound cake. Light flavor with a nice dense texture. Wish I'd had "real" cake flower instead of improvised ( 1 Tbs. cornstarch replacing 1 Tbs. flour per cup of flour). I also added extra lemon zest and juice, because I was overzealous in my zesting and juicing! I made a layer cake with lemon curd filling and lemon, cream cheese frosting for my son's birthday, which everyone enjoyed.  A few of us even snuck some for breakfast the next day!  Very yummy.

I am not a baker, so this was a little tricky for me. I went slow and followed the directions and it was amazing. everyone loved it. I did use Lemmon flavored yogurt and it was very good. Next time I will try plain yogurt. As someone else said save the egg yolks, you will need them. I also put a simple glaze.on it. It's a keeper!

Yummy and light! I made no changes other than 1/2 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup light sour cream.  Gave it a five for taste but be sure not to overcook ~ was a tad dry and I checked it at 50 minutes and it was done; could be my oven but just in case next time I'll check it at 45.

This cake is not worth the work.  I bake all the time and I read all the reviews on it.  It was ok but will not be making it again.  Reminds me of a pound cake.

I made this once a couple of years ago and just thought it was ok. I decided to give it a second chance and I was still disappointed. It's kind of a lot of work for a cake that wasn't that great. The description says it's light but it's anything but. It's dry and dense and I prefer a springy, fluffy, moist cake.

I thought I reviewed this cake but I guess not.  So I made this twice.  The second time, I used more salt, and added bourbon based vanilla.  And for some reason, in my oven, when I baked at 350 it took so long for the center to get done that the outsides were darker than perhaps I would have liked but still good.  So this second time, I baked at 375 until it was done.  I don't know how long that was, sorry.  I used a fancy bundt pan so that may have contributed to the baking dilemma.  I also worked the batter a little bit with the yogurt; I added maybe a bit more until the batter was not so dry.    I bake my own bread and my reading of such things is that for old recipes the cook just kind of works batter or dough until it's right.  It has been my observation that when an old recipe is written down, some ingredients are a sort of point of departure.  How much yogurt?  Some until the batter is right and right is just a matter of practice.  But all in all the cake was delicious really delicious and the first one was gobbled up fast.   I wonder can you make a Greek Key Lime Cake?

I'm not sure where I went wrong! The batter itself, once mixed with a little extra yogurt to compensate for lack of moisture, tasted fine.  Unfortunately, the cake came out to dry.

1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar

tastes great! I would just add a little more lemon zest or juice to make it more lemony and take it out after no more than 50 minutes...I'll try at 45 minutes next time...I did mine on a  bundt cake pan...other than that...delicious! thanks for sharing! :)

Really great recipe! I added cornstarch to regular flour to make the substitute for cake flour. I decorated with some candied lemon peel that I made. It came out beautifully moist with a wonderful lemon flavor.

I used 50% more zest and juice than the recipe called for, and the lemon is still barely perceptible.  I'm going to make a lemon glaze.

The lemon flavor in this cake improves over a day or 2.  I liked the cake the first day I made it but loved it after it sat.  It is very light and moist.  A perfect cake to make in advance for a party.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought the cake was drier than I would have liked. I wouldn't make it again.

This was a great lemon cake. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used lemon yogurt instead of plain. And, instead of measuring the zest and lemon juice, I just used the zest and juice of 2 lemons. It was a great spring dessert served with fresh strawberries and blueberries! It was some effort, but well worth it and certainly not over the top hard.

This recipie is bangin'!!!
Just finished making my second one.  Made the first for Easter several days ago, and it was a hit! I thought this was enjoyable to make as well (note: I LOVE TO BAKE).  I made a few tweeks after reading reviews: doubled the lemon zest and the lemon juice. I also used sour cream bc I didn't have  Greek yogurt on hand (I prefer the tanginess of the G yogurt better). This one is a definite keeper!  YUM!

I intented to change nothing from the given recipe BUT it happenned that I missed the yoghurt ! oops ! ;-) Good news was the cake was still very good. Being a lemon lover and coming back from holidays with wonderful lemons fresh from the tree, I just put 2 of them, skin, pulp and juice into my food processor and found the resulting pulp was replacing at the best the zest and juice proportions : a wonderful tip if you have fresh organic fruits available ! I'm planning to do it again with a light white chocolate cover and candies decoration for a girlie party.

I just made this recipe this morning. It turned out great. I love the super lemon flavor! Although I did not like the rum flavor with the lemon, next time I think I will just leave that out maybe substitute with vanilla... thank you!

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using greek yogurt, it was vey good. I made it in the form of cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for my daughter's third bday party. The kids loved them, as did the adults. It was a little labor intensive but I would make it again.

Cake was OK.  I didn't care for the texture at all.  I followed instructions, replacing lemon yogurt for plain, & the cake was beautiful - but not what I was hoping for.

Even after using lemon yogurt, and doubling the amount of lemon juice and zest, this cake still didn't have the tang I look for in a lemon cake.  Maybe with a lemon glaze or syrup on top?  The texture was more of a pound cake.  It was a good cake, but I'll keep looking for a lemon cake recipe.

Labor-intensive, but a nice cake.  Mine browned up considerably, to the point that it had me worried it might burn, but it did not.  A nice texture and very nice lemon flavor.  Cooks up light but after cooking seemed more firm than originally expected.

DELICIOUS!    first of all, here are the changes I made based on what i had in the kitchen and on personal preferences:  *halved the recipe  *replaced butter with half margerine, half apple sauce  *baked in 9" springform pan    Even with these changes, cake came out delicious, light, and refreshing.  I agree with the other reviews that it could stand to be more lemon-y.  Next time I will probably add more lemon zest or maybe even lemon extract.    It doesn't need icing -- perfect with just a little bit of powdered sugar on top! YUM!!!!!!

I made this cake for my son's class toga party. Everyone loved the cake and the teacher had 3 slices. He said the cake was one of the first dishes to be eat up. I also made a cake for home. The only changes that I made was to use lemon yogurt instead of plain and to add more lemon juice. It was fantastic! This recipe  is a keeper!

I ROYALLY MESSED THIS UP!!! I did everything right except for 1 thing. After cleaning up the kitchen and making my baby a bottle, I found the cup of butter in my microwave. With this in mind, it tasted more like of a lemon bread than a cake. It still tasted good after I put some "buttery, powdered sugar, lemon oil" icing on it. I'm making this for my family's Greek theme Christmas so I'm glad I did the mistake now than later. ***UPDATE*** My husband came home and said it was a really good bundt cake.

There is no question the cake is very good by itself, but I am going to try it next time with a light icing for just a bit more sweetness.

Good cake!  Mine was also a pound cake texture - which is a good thing since it was for my husband's birthday and he loves pound cake! I used regular all purpose flour, and sifted it twice.  Next time I will add more lemon zest.  I put a creamy lemon glaze over the top and in the middle.  Next time I will try a raspberry filling with the same glaze over the top.  I overbaked mine a little.  I do not have a 10-inch tube pan so I divided into 2 9-inch round cake pans and guessed that 30 minutes would be OK.  It was just a tad dry and overcooked.  All my fault - not the recipe!
