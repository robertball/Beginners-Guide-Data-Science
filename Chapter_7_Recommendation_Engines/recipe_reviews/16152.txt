I have some suggestions I've collected to help the filling stay intact.  

Tips:
1. This is traditional Sunday dish--it's not meant to be difficult. As it was served to me, it wasn't a dish that "wowed" on the table in terms of presentation, just on your taste buds! This particular recipe describes "oozing" cheese.  Conjures almost a calzone-like explosion of filling.  I'm not sure that's what was actually intended. In my experience, that's not what you get when you slice into braciola, so relax if yours doesn't fit the description. It's ok! Still, you shouldn't be losing *all* your filling.

2. Don't overfill your rolls. Less is more.

3. Leave a 1 inch border between your filling and the edge of the meat, all the way around.  This trick makes sense because then the browning process (prior to putting the meat in the sauce) will help seal the edges. Brown well on all sides! This adds flavor!

4.  Roll tightly. 

5. Consider tucking the open edges (think burrito). I found this helpful, although I'm not sure that it's traditional.  If you leave the 1 inch border and brown well, that may be enough.

5.  I used toothpicks to secure my rolls, but most italian chefs seem to recommend using string or twine--and tying it tightly, especially the open edges. 

These are just tips I've picked up and I'm still learning myself. I'd love to hear some real braciole pros chime in with their techniques!

I can count the number of foods my kids won't eat on one hand and raisins happens to be one of them, therefore, I left them out. Even so, this recipe was delicious! I made six rolls and only one leaked. I cut the mozarella into narrow slices and placed it in the center of the meat, making sure I had about an inch of space on either side of the cheese. Working slowly, tuck the right and left sides of the meat in toward the center and roll forward. Repeat this until your roll is formed. At this point, the only escape route for the cheese should be at the end. If you tie it off well, it should be fine. Glad to see everyone's a "Raymond" fan!!

We had never heard of braciola until we watched a popular sitcom which featured this dish.  My husband seemed facinated by it so I searched all over for a recipe, which wasn't easy since I didn't know how to spell it!  Finally, I searched this web site for International Beef Recipes and there it was.  I made it for dinner and WOW!  It is soooo good!  This is March, my husband's birthday is in June and he has already requested braciola for his special dinner.  All of us LOVED it!  It definetely is a five star recipe!

Not bad, but a few modifications would improve this recipe.

1.  Cheese:  Mozzarella gets too runny and gooey when melted (think pizza), and is a little bland.  A combination of parmesan and romano gives a nice melting, and also adds much better flavor.  You can even add some swiss or some provolone for better flavor.

2.  Herbs.  The filling should have some fresh herbs.  A few tablespoons of fresh parsley or basil (or your preference) gives a fuller flavor.

3.  Sauce.  I shy away from jarred sauces because they always taste of tomato paste.  A home-made simply marinara is much better.

4.  Bread crumbs.  Some like it, some not.  A handful of bread crumbs makes a nice texture.  And you can use an egg to help bind it.

Man, do I love braciole!

Instead of cutting it up into 4 pieces I cut it in half. One piece I used tooth picks to hold it together and another I used thread. Don't use thread. It held together nicely but was a complete pain. The tooth picks weren't easy to work with because the area around the toothpick didn't brown.  It worked out in the end because it cooked in the sauce but next time I'll be prepared and buy string.

I omitted the raisins but included italian breadcrumbs. My husband RAVED about this. It wasn't perfect due to my own mistakes but it was still VERY good. I have a feeling this will be a once every two week dish.

Some comments: 1)Thin the sauce.  Mine thickened up quite a bit while it was simmering.  I had to add water to thin it out so it wasn't so chunky on the meat.  2) Turn the meat while it is simmering in the sauce.  It was hectic while I was cooking and never thought to turn it.  Big mistake.  3) Use string.  It is easier to deal with and ensures that the meat will completly brown on all sides.  I had a few toothpicks that broke off when I was turning the meat.  4) Use shredded mozarella cheese.  It makes it easier to roll tight.  5) Prepare the meat a few hours ahead.  After you have it wrapped tightly and secured, put it in the fridge.  It helps keep it together.  

This was a great start.  I think next time it will be perfect.  The flavor was excellent but the hectic kitchen caused me to make mistakes.

This was a hit at my house! I had the butcher tenderize my round steak as it tends to be a tougher cut of meat. It doesn't matter if the cheese runs out, it is supposed to all blend together for the terrific taste. Just spoon the sauce back on when you serve it. I also put mine in the crock pot after browning the rolls in a little oil. Don't leave anything out because then it isn't authentic! I serve it with mashed potatoes and tossed salad.

This was a wonderful way to prepare round steak.  I did make a few changes, I left out the raisins and used shredded 2%milk mozzarella.  It was tender and delicious.  Thanks!

This meal is good for the "low-carb" dieter if eliminating the raisins and using a low-carb sauce. I prepared the meat the day before so the process wouldn't be so time consuming. This also helped the spices to soak into the meat and gave it great flavor. I tied the meat and didn't have any problems with the cheese oozing out. I also fried up some mushrooms and added them to the sauce. The only change would be to let the meat simmer longer in the sauce to let it get even more tender. Very tasty!

I'd never even heard of this dish, but I saw all the ratings and reviews so I decided to try it. It is one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. Naturally, I keep trying to come up with a way to keep all the filling inside the meat, so if anyone else does, please share. Oh, and make sure you remove ALL of the string before serving because I left one on( by accident ofcourse!)and not that I've ever heard of anyone dying from string consumption, but my husband swears I was trying to kill him :-)

Soo Good. I also omitted the raisins because I didn't have any on hand and it was still delicious. My family makes the tradition braciola with flank steak and a bread like stuffing but I prefer this one with the round steak and cheese. Very good, thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome.  I am one of the toothpick users, since I didn't have any string, so I fully expected the loss of cheese from my rolls.  I made a sauce from 2 cans diced basil and garlic tomatoes, 1 small can tomato sauce, 1 small can tomato paste, 1 large chopped onion, 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 tsp dried basil, salt, pepper, and 2 cups of chicken stock.  I let it all simmer for 2 hours with the lid off to let some the liquid cook off.  Once I removed the rolls I added a little heavy cream to the sauce. So good!!  I think I am going to use this recipe as a basis for experimenting with other cheeses and spices.  Thanks to the submitter!

My entire family loved this recipe and they are not easy to please.  I will be making this again and again, or so I have been told ;) I did make my own sauce, I used currants in place of the raisins.

I've tried six ways to sunday to get the cheese to remain within the roll while cooking.  I have finally given up.  The flavors are good but why not just throw all the ingredients in the pot at once and save yourself the trouble of preparing the rolls?  I will pass on this recipe until they invest a better technique.  Oh, by the way, I experimented adding thinly sliced proscuitto to the rolls and I thought the flavor result excellent.

I do not have an ounce of Italian blood in me.  My husband's first wife had a Grandma who was a fantastic Italian grandma/cook. My husband says this braciola is better than his ex-wife's Noni's braciola.

I made these for Christmas w/ a wonderful red sauce recipe I got from this site, and I couldnt have been happier. Absolutly perfect. I did leave out the mozzerella after reading about it falling out while cooking, but thought the raisins were a nice touch. My sister said these were the best shes ever had, and she was married to an Italian for 15 years! I was proud to serve these. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Liked the taste, but will add additional cheese and some type of spice next time ... just needed a little 'something'.  Thanks for an easy recipe (I'll have to work on my rolling up skills)  :)

Delicious. Tender. I made them smaller portions and used fresh mozzarella - which melted a little but still worked nicely. I will add red pepper next time for more zest.

I loved this recipe! I watched Everybody Loves Raymond and my mouth watered whenever I watched the episode where Debra makes amazing braciola. I decided to try it! I am not a raisin fan but didn't omit the idea- I did replace the raisins with currants and absolutely loved the flavor it brought. I also added italian style breadcrumbs and it was perfect. A favorite in our house!

This was wonderful!! The pounding of the meat took some time. but it was worth it. Used a round steak that was cut already into 6 pieces. I didnt add the raisins (personal preference) But everything else in the recipe was done as written. including cooking time. The meat was super tender and flavorful. This will definately  be added to the monthly  menu :) thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good. My husband really liked it. I did make a few minor changes. They are easy so hopefully not to annoying. First, I browned the meat first before rolling it up. It was easier. Second, instead of string I used metal Kabob sticks with a curve at the end. Last, I put the rolled meat in a small cake pan, poured the spaghetti sauce over it and put in the oven at 400 degrees for an hour. Next, time the last 1/2 hour I might add a pkg. of pre-sliced mushrooms. On my all time favorite list. Thanks!

Ok.  Better than one posted by Candy.  I made my own sauce.  The one in the pic looks too thin.  Good flavor.  Correct spelling is Braciole.

I chose this recipe because I had no good ideas on how to prepare some round steak that I had purchased.  My family loved this recipe, the flavors were wonderful. My only problem was that I didn't prepare enough!

This I found to be absolutely delicious! The steak was sooo tender.  The only problem I had was getting the twine off the steaks.  I must have wrapped too tight after reading other reviewers complain about the cheese coming out.  I could not find the cheese inside either after wrapping them so tight.  But the raisins were absolutely the best part! Don't leave them out.  THis is a make-again recipe!

mmmmmm.....This was good. I will definitely make again. Do not leave the raisins out like others - i dont like raisins but they were very good in this recipe - added a sweetness! The guests loved it too! Great with pasta and garlic green beans.

Great recipe! I have been eating this since I was a child at Grandma's Sunday dinner. I was not smart enough to ask her to write the recipe down like I should of. But with my mom's help, we changed a few things based on our traditions. This is based on 1 1/2 lbs of steak. Instead of the raisins, we lightly dry toasted pine nuts and added that to mixture. Instead of the two cheeses listed here, we used 2/3C grated pecorino romano and 1/2 cup chopped provolone. Also, 1/2 C italian bread crumbs is good binder. 1/2 C chopped basil, 1/2 C parsley to mixture. Added 2 Tbsp butter to our sauce, instead of into each roll. Instead of cutting the meat, just pound it out and add the mixture to make very large rolls. This cuts out much of the oozing that people were referring to. After meat has browned, add 1 cup of red wine to dutch oven until boiling, to soak up browned bits, and then add your sauce. Because the pieces are larger, we cooked them for 3 hours mostly covered with the sauce. Yummy!  Sorry, I know I changed the recipe, but so many people were asking about suggestions!

thought it seemed a little long so only cooked this for 1hr 1o min and the meat was so tough it was almost inedible. as far as the filling it was the only saving grace -- used high quality mozz and it melted fine, added roasted red pepper and fresh basil (copying a butcher pre-made from Safeway :)

So, sooo good!  The raisins didn't appeal to me, but I left them in anyway and I'm glad I did.  They add a light touch of sweetness to the meat and aren't detectable as raisins.  I left this to simmer for 2 hrs. on low and it was so tender.  My family LOVED it!

I really liked this great way to use a cheap cut of meat.  Meat was very tender.  I also had a problem with the cheese leaking out.  The rolls that I browned a little more seemed to do a little better then those that I wasn't able to brown the ends as well.  It didn't do much for dh, but I took it for lunch the next day.

YUM! I used sirloin steak ( I recommend using it, round steak is yuck!) because that's what I had. I made 4 braciola's. If you only make 4, then only use 4 oz of mozzarella cheese, 1/4 C Parmesan & 1 t of butter to each. 1/8 t garlic to each & I used slightly less amount of raisins because I realized it was going to be tough to roll up if I added anything else. After browning them, I added them to my simmering homemade tomato sauce in the crockpot. I let it simmer around 6 hours. A little cheese leaked out even though I tied them tight with kitchen twine but I expected that. I served with spaghetti & sauce. I will try again. The prep time was longer than 10 mins for me. I found that this recipe wasn't hard at all, just took some time & patience. Thanks!

This is good.  Don't be intimidated--not hard to make.  Also, the raisins are surprisingly good in there as well.  My wife didn't like it.  I'd have given it 4, and she 2, but she tends not to like chewy meats, and the round steak still was, somewhat tough.  Give it a try--you might love it, and you certainly won't hate it.

Great Sunday night dinner, smells great while simmering and tasted great!  Takes a little time to prepare the rolls, but worth the effort when you have time, and use the raisins, adds a rich flavor.

Very good without raisins. Since I didn't have string, I used toothpicks. Will definately use string next time. The cheese came out all in the sauce. The sauce wasn't that bad.

Very Good!! It seemed a bit tedious at first, but the recipe turned out to be easy to make and tasted delicious. Thanks to the addition of raisins, even my two-year old "gobbled" it up!

This was wonderful. My husband was asking for it at least twice a month, but this is something I don't want to get sick of. I sprinkled the salt and pepper on the meat after pounding it. And I did not use raisin just because I wasn't go to the store, but next time they are going in.

A different way to prepare spaghetti. Overall, we enjoyed this recipe. I did have problems with the rolls staying together and by the end of cooking time, the cheese etc had all fallen out. But still, it provided more flavor to the jarred sauce I bought. Also, I left out the raisins.

This was a good recipe, but you must pound the meat thin enough and not overcook it! I did have a problem like some of the others, with losing the cheese, not sure what causes some to keep the cheese and others to lose it...any suggestions?

This is delicious. Altho i like to pound the meat with a mallet to tenderize it some. i also spread the butter on it and only some of the cheese then after rolling and securing with toothpicks instead of the string i put more cheese on top and butter. This is great served with a side of shell pasta cooked with spaghetti sauce and lots of mozzerella cheese. the raisens are very important to the flavor of the meat. i'm not crazy about raisens but they are really good in this dish. I will be making this again and again.

Very good, but very rich. I used venison instead of beef. I secured my rolls with many toothpicks. Just remember to take them out before serving.

I thought this recipe turned out well and I liked it, however the raisins were the topic of some heated debate at the dinner table. No one besides me could come to terms with them. But they picked them out and ate the meat and seemed to enjoy it anyway.

This was quite tasty but way too time consuming for me to make it again soon.  The whole cheese-in-the-middle and tying it up thing took far too long for what it was worth.  I'll bet it would taste just as well if it was just layered with those items.

This was a very good recipe, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.  It was difficult to keep the filling in the beef, but most of it stayed in and it was easy to spoon the rest on top.  The meat was a little bit tough, but that may be because I thawed it in the microwave beforehand.  But the best part of the recipe was actually the raisins.  I wasn't sure how they would taste with beef, but it definitely made the recipe special!

I was so surprised to accidentally run across this recipe, for I too, had tried to find the recipe after "Everybody Loves Raymond". I committed a culinary sin and left out the raisins. (We just don't care for them!) I thought the recipe was still delicious! I substituted a can of crushed tomatoes with italian herbs in place of the spaghetti sauce. I might try slow cooking them in my crock pot next time to see if it turns out more tender. I will make this again!

This is similar to our family recipe. I would suggest using flank steak rather than top round (that’ll make it five stars). Rather than making a bunch of small ones, butterfly your flank steak into two pieces with a good sharp knife. If you do this there’s no need to pound it. I skip the mozzarella and use a nice handful of fresh grated Parmesan and Romano cheese, minced garlic, salt pepper, fresh minced parsley, and raisins. I don’t measure anything. Just enough of each ingredient to make it nice. Roll it up as per the other suggestions. I tie mine. I don’t use toothpicks. Brown the bracciole in a couple of table spoons of olive oil and add it to your Sunday gravy. I also add in sweet sausage and boneless country style pork ribs (brown those first too). By all means, never use jarred sauce. Make your own. Bracciole isn’t an entree. It’s served as a side  with a tomato gravy pasta and like lasagna, manicotti, or ravioli.

Very good- usually simmer in tomato sauce but this time made a beef/tomato base with broth and tomato paste and let it cook slowly at 275 degrees- served with steamed green beans and salad- everyone enjoyed it!

Very tasty and tender, I omitted the raisins not a fan of them and I sprinkled some bread crumbs before rolling them up. Also, I used my own sauce and not a jarred one.

Very good. Adaptable to small changes for taste preferences. More cheese, less cheese, spices, different steak cuts, etc.

Really tasty! I followed recipe exactly, except I used a bit less Mozzarella than listed because it all wouldn't fit. Plan on a little more prep time than the recipe calls for. I will make this again for sure.

I wasn't overly impressed with this.. although I may be somewhat to blame. I omitted the raisins which I will add next time along with additional cheese. I used string to tie the bundles tight yet the cheese still disappeared.

This was ok.  I cant say that I would make it again with this exact recipe but its a good start for my own twist.  I would definately add more ingredients as far as the stuffing goes.

Oh my! This was sooo good! My brother-in-law came in from playing across the street while I was making this and said it smelled "incredible". I found this extremely easy to make when the ends are kept together with toothpicks. 
Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was okay. After much anticipation from "Everybody Loves Raymond", I finally stumbled across the recipe. However, a bit labor intensive. I have never been frustrated by a recipe and I was, by trying to roll the beef! It was actually very tough and difficult to eat. I found it a little, however, my husband really enjoyed it, therefore it will get 4 stars rather than 3. My husband does have a small say!

Very good. Kind of a pain to put together but once you get it going you can relax and let it simmer. Had a wonderful flavor. I used string and still lost my filling but I think I just need to get my technique down. Family loved it, especially the sauce.

I was disappointed in this dish. First of all, rolling the meat with all the stuff inside was hard but doable if you are very patient. Unfortunately, stuffing it ended up being a waste of time because all of the cheese oozed out into the sauce and I couldn't taste it. I also did not like the flavor the raisins gave the dish. If you want to sweeten it, add some brown sugar. I won't be using this recipe again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  Flavor was
great, meat was tender.  The whole family
love it!!!  I added fresh parsley into the
roll ups on top of the pad of butter.  I also
used toothpicks, not string.

My husband and I really enjoyed this and I have made it several times.  When I first read the recipe I was nervous about the raisins, but the raisins really make this dish so scrumptious.  Thank you for sharing with us Michele!

I didn't add the raisins because we don't care for them.  The meat turned out tough and there was nothing special about the flavor.  It just tasted like meat and spaghetti sauce.  Maybe the raisins add a little something to it?

I liked this. It was easy to make.  Didn't have any string so I used pieces of wooden skewers and when I ran out, some vermicelli - an old trick (you can use spaghetti as well).  Next time I will use cooking twine and spaghetti to hold the cheese in place.  It's too bad you have to turn it as you brown it etc. which necessitates the use of twine.  Tasted GREAT.  The meat was slightly tough but I hurried the cooking so that could be the problem.  I used crushed tomatoes seasoned with italian seasonings and sugar for the sauce.

Why is it so difficult to find cooking twine in Houston? With the help of some toothpicks to secure the rolled meat, this is a show-stopper! Just have to extract carefully after cooking... I was wary like another reviewer of the raisins but they added to it and I am NOT a raisin fan (used yellow and purple different times with same good results). I think that as long as you get the butcher to tenderize the meat really good--knowing you will also have to whack at it as well--and choose a yummy spaghetti sauce, this is a no-fail. If the cheese comes out or not, (sometimes it happened to me, sometimes it stayed with all), it all comes together deliciously. I have made it three times now for different groups and have gotten astonished, rave reviews. HEY!?  ;)

Wow!  This was wonderful.  And not nearly as hard to make as I was afraid of (from other comments).  I actually thought it was pretty easy.  And the taste!  Didn't have a problem w/filling leaking out of meat rolls.  But them I pressed the cheese, etc., down on the meat before rolling the pieces.  Didn't have string, so used wooden toothpicks to secure rolls.  Had to find them when serving, but worked okay.  Delicious!

the taste was average. the cheese totally melted out into the sauce, and the beef seemed a little tough and dry.  kind of a pain to tie each piece up.  too much work for a weeknight meal.

Excellent! This was a family favorite that my mother & grandmother had made. They have both passed on & I had never learned how they had made it. I found this recipe & tried it, & its just like theirs. (I didn't use raisins because I hate them....it didn't seem to matter). Thank you Michelle!

This is a good recipe but it is messy and takes awhile to be done.  The cheese didn't stay inside the meat, even with the string but it was still good.  I'll make it again, probably on the weekend when I have more time.

WOW!!  I totally messed up the recipe and it was still incredible!  I wrapped up the meat with just the cheese and butter inside then sprinkled everything else on top of the rolls.  Next time I'll do it right.  This has the best flavor, and the meat is so tender from simmering in the sauce for 1 1/2 hours that you can cut it with a fork.  I did wonder if I was supposed to cut the meat by length or width?  I made it for my husband for our 5th anniversary and he raved about it.  If, like me, you have to know the pronunciation, it's brah-chee-oh-lah, but for Tony Soprano, it would be bra-zhawl :)  Enjoy!

This was a little time consuming, but my husband raved about it. Felt like the wife on "Everybody Loves Raymond".

This is the best!!! I really impressed the people that I work with.  Make sure and use a good cut of meat and not to over cook it.

Tried this for something different and it got rave reviews at my house.  Imagine my surprise when I was watching Everybody Loves Raymond on television and Raymond's wife cooked it, surprising everyone because it tasted so great!  I agree...this is a wonderful dish!

I've had this dish many years ago in a restaurant. I was thrilled to see the recipe. I tried it and it was just as delicious as I remembered it to be.
