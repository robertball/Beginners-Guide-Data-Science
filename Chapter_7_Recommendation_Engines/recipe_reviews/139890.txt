I made a prime rib roast that weighed 9 pounds ( it was a 3 rib roast) As per these exact directions. I just wanted to make sure that I properly explained it. It came out great. It did not burn in the slightest. The seasoned flour that gets rubbed in seals the meat and crisps the fat on the top and bottom. I even used a rack to lift the roast off the pan, so that the under side would be roasted nicely. This procedure works like a wood fired oven . It seals the juices in while crisping up the fat . You will notice in the roasting pan after you pull it out from the oven that the only thing in there is the rendered fat that came off the top and bottom. There will be no beef juices. When You coat the roast in flour dont be afraid to really coat and press down the flour in to all of the meat as well as the fat. This coating will protect all those wonderful juices.This is how you get prime rib at all those great steak resturants.You can vary the spices in the flour mix last night I used herbs de provence. as well as salt and freshly ground white pepper. It cooked at 15 mins. a lb as instructed. and after taking it out at 120 and letting it rest it was 140 after about 30 mins of resting with a linen towel . So please give this recipe a try before you give a review. It took quite a few years and quite a few roasts to develop this  manner of cooking this exact roast. You will be pleasently surprised.

Okay I needed to cook a prime rib steak and saw the arguement here over this recipe so decided to try it and figure out who is correct. The results were wonderful and I followed the recipe exactly. The temperature of 425 degrees turned out to be perfect.  I let the meat come to room temperature, I seasoned the meat as suggested, and put it into a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes. Now this is important, I was cooking one pound of prime rib, so I used only 15 minutes to cook it perfectly. The recipe is for 12 servings so while I assume that it is correct I can only attest to the one pound for one serving experience. And the results were as good as any restuarant. Which is particularly amazing because frankly I have always wondered how they were able to get the meat fully cooked in a restaurant without drying it out. And now I know. Thanks to the reviewers who persisted in insisting that the recipe was correct and to the woman who origionally posted it.

425 deg. is way too hot to roast at 20 minutes per pound.  It  is fine for an initial 15 to 20 minutes,  but the oven temp should then be turned down to somewhere around 350 deg for the duration of the cooking time

I tried this recipe for my niece's graduation party.  I cooked a 12 lb. prime rib at 425 for 15 minutes per pound.  I planned on taking the "medium rare" roast out, cutting it in half, and  putting half of it back in the oven, in order to have a "medium well" roast and a "medium rare" roast, so my guests could have their choice.  However, when I removed the roast after 3 hours, it was "medium well."  My guests had no choice between "medium rare" or "medium well."  I was disappointed, but the roast was still a success.  The flour mixture sealed all the juices in the meat, so even though it was cooked "medium well," it was still juicy and delicious.  Today I am going to use the same recipe on an 8 lb. roast for Father's Day.  I will cook it at 425 for 15 minutes per lb. because my immediate family likes "medium well."  If anyone wants a "medium rare" roast, I have to agree with the other reviews, use a lower temperature.  But if you like "medium well,"  this is GREAT recipe!

I am online to look over recipes for the Prime Rib Roast of the meat butchered.  Barb, thank you for elaborating more on your directions.  The rest of you did nothing to mention how the meat was when you tried Barb's instructions, so I can only assume you did not.  
The butcher's instructions on my 6 + roast states:  Preheat and cook 30 min in a 400 degree oven, then 20 minutes per pound at 350 degrees.  The butcher states that medium rare is 130 degrees internal.  If the roast is over 10 lbs to cut time down to 15 min. per pound.
Perhaps different locations (humidity, arrid and altitude) makes differences on exacts?  I do not like to read argumentive reviews, I like facts of what occurred when YOU tried someones recipes - matter of fact and respectfully.  I am sure I am not alone.  I will take seriously anyone's review that sounds like they are not playing nice.

Great recipe and excellent au jus! But I would recommend adjusting the ingredients to the size of the roast. I had a 9-pound roast and followed the recipe accordingly (for a 14-pound roast) and had LOTS of ingredients left over. Another word of advice with this recipe: be sure to add at least a cup of water every hour and baste the roast every half-hour. I didn't do this at first and the drippings burned and smoked until I added water. Adding water also adds more gravy for extra flavor. A definite must recipe for prime rib lovers!

Roast should be cooked at 200-250 degrees F.  then seared at the end at 500 for 20 minutes.  meat should be removed from the oven at 125F and rested for 20 minutes.  the temp will rise about 10 degrees and you will have a lovely even red warm roast that is extremely tender and juicy.

I tried this recipe out for my mom's birthday and it turned out fantastic. I looked over a lot of different recipes before settling on this one and I'm really glad I did. I made a 12 pound rib and everyone said it was better than the restaurant. However, that could be because they didn't need to pay for it. 

Anyway, one really, really helpful item that people reading this review might want to pick up is a meat thermometer. I used an electronic one and took the roast out when it was about 125 - 130 degrees. The amount of time it spent outside the oven (uncut) cooked it the rest of the way. 

Overall I highly recommend this recipe.

I loved this recipe but I want to warn everyone about a few contradictions in it.  If you read the cook time at top is says 2 hours for a 14 pound roast, but in the body of the recipe it calls for 20 minutes a pound or 4 1/2 hours.  Then if you read the reviews everyone calls for cooking it for 15 minutes a pound instead of 20.
Follow the recipe but cook it for 15 minutes per pound and keep an eye on your thermometer.  It only took me about 2 1/2 hours to get to temperature on a 12 pound beast it should have been at least 3.  Great recipe but confusing instructions

I made this for Thanksgiving and was really praying it would work.  I had a 9lb 40z beautiful boneless Prime Rib Roast that cost me an arm and a leg so didn't want to ruin it.  I followed the recipe to the letter, roasting 15 minutes per lb at 425 degree (pre-heated oven).  I let it rest for 30 minutes.  My family was overwhelmed!  Medium Rare in the middle and a little less rare to Well on the ends.  Everyone from kids to adults had what they wanted.  It was the first year with little talk while they ate.  All I heard was "yummy" sounds.  I will make it again, when I can afford it!

I used this recipe just last night and it was the best prime rib roast that I have ever cooked! I've cooked countless prime rib roasts and never have they turned out this good!!! I'm a far cry from a professional cook, but this recipe made me a star last night! I cooked a 4lb roast at 425 degrees for 1hr & ten minutes. Removed it from the oven when the internal temp was approx 120 degrees, then let it "tent" for 45 minutes. The end result was a perfect medium rare prime rib, with the outside pieces being more "medium" Exactly what I was after, since my husband enjoys it "medium" cooked.  I was lucky to have enough drippings to make gravy, so perhaps the cut had a little more fat to it. Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!!!! I would encourage more people to try this recipe, you won't be disappointed. Thank you Barbara for sharing this fabulous recipe!

To all those who had less than desired results I can only say 1) get an oven thermometer - ovens can be off as much as 50 deg.  2) get a meat thermometer to ensure you get the right done-ness.  3) Do NOT change the temperature, that's right this roast cooks the full time at 425.  And to Barbara who originally posted this recipe - a big THANK YOU.  I have tried several different ways of making prime rib and this is the best by far.  I won't try another recipe but expect to be making this one again very soon.  AWESOME tenderness, taste and so moist YUM!!!

This is an excellent recipe!  It comes out tender and juicy every time.  I roasted mine for 13 minutes per pound before removing from the oven, tenting and letting stand for an hour to finish cooking.  The result ranged from a rare to medium rare center, to well done end caps, which is perfect.  You dip slices in the hot juice if you want to cook them a little more.  That is that way restaurants make prime rib to order. I want to share my favorite horseradish sauce recipe for serving with prime rib (especially), or any roast of beef, venison or elk. I use extra hot, PREPARED horseradish (not cream style) and mix two parts sour cream to one part hot prepared horseradish. It is that simple, and you will not believe how it brings out the flavor of red meat! It is very light and cool, but with a kick! It is called 'horseradish sherbet'. This sauce is also great to serve with grilled, fried or broiled red meats. You can make as much or as little as you need and leftover sauce stores nicely for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you like horseradish, you will love this sauce. Give it a try. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all my fellow cooks!

It was my first time making prim rib, wow was it very good!!! my family couln't stop raving about it. I cooked a 7.4 lbs. at 15mins. per pound. I took it out when the internat temp was about 115 aprox. 1 3/4 hours, my family likes it on the rare side of med-rare. Let it rest for 30mins tented with foil and the lid on, (just enough time to make yorkshire pudding). It was perfect.  A tip for those who sugest puting water in the bottom of the pan- Big NO No!  Yes your roat will smoke as the fat hits the pan but who cares? By adding water you will steam the roast and you wont get that lovely resturant style crust that everyone's after. Also this recipe will not make au jus (gravy)so find a package or take some out of the freezer from a previous roast. Trust me for the price you'll pay for quality prim rib it's worth the extra step and details you wont be sorry.

Excellant coating,great blend of spices and flour.The juices tend to stay in the meat,so au jus is not there. I added mushrooms and water to keep the pan from browning and at the end, some brandy to add an extra zing.Thank you for this recipe.

The meat was cooked perfectly....Picked up a beautiful 5.6 pound Rib Eye Roast from Sams Club and cooked it uncovered on a wire rack for 20 minutes a pound. I took it out at an internal temperature of 130, wrapped in foil for 30 minutes, and it was perfect. My only suggestion is to add a really good steak seasoning to the flour instead of all the other stuff. I made the coating exactly per the directions and although it did keep the juices inside it was light on flavor for my taste. A healthy mix of a Chicago Steak Seasoning with salt and flour in the coating makes this a first rate Prime Rib for my taste. Thank you very much for sharing...Great recipe!

Similar to another reviewer, I had a very small roast - 1.5 pounds.  I followed the directions as closely as possible but adding a little more garlic - to suit my taste.  I roasted for 30 minutes.  The meat was on the rare side but tender and delicious.  My DH loves rare beef and he loved it - enough said!  Thanks Barbara for a great recipe.  For the rest of you, don't leave negative feedback unless you have actually tried this as written.

Excellent recipe! Followed 15 minutes per pound for a 5.5 lb standing rib roast using proportioned  coating mixture.  The coating kept all the juices in the roast.  I cooked this at 425 until thermometer registered 120 degrees.  Because this roast was smaller than the original recipe, it cooled too much while sitting for 30 minutes.  Next time I will let it sit for only 20 minutes.  I have cooked many rib roasts through the years and this  was the best ever recipe.  The key is having the roast completely at room temperature!

This is a fantastic prime rib recipe.  I pretty much followed it to the letter.    I always use an instant read thermometer and a 4 rib 8 1/2 lb. roast took just under 2 hrs to reach 125 deg. F.  I carved it after letting it sit tented for about 1/2 hr and there was almost no juice left on the cutting board.  It was all in the meat!  I have tried fast cook, slow cook and traditional methods of roasting prime rib and this is by far the best result yet.  Obviously roasting times may vary.  I found it took just under 15 min/lb, but I dry age my beef for at least 48 hrs at 40 deg F and let it sit at room temp for at least 4 hrs before putting it in the oven. The extra flour naturally mixes with the pan drippings to make a tasty gravy base.  Great Recipe all around!!!

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly as written, but since my roast was only 5.5# I checked it after 15 minutes per pound.  The internal temperature was 35 C., so I allowed the entire 20 min. per pound. I should have checked it about 10 min. before the end time, as the roast was more medium than medium rare. I let it rest a full 45 min. before cutting.  As the recipe said, you will not lose any juices.  There was only fat drippings in the bottom of the pan. The roast was pink in the center, flavorful and tender.  My husband, who loves his prime rib, was in heaven.

I made this this past weekend for dinner.  It was the best Prime Rib I have ever eaten.  It really does taste just like restaurant style rib.  Only 3 of us were eating, so the one I got was about 3-4lbs.  I did have plenty of drippings to make au jus (probably because I didn't have to cook it as long due to the smaller size) I cooked it until 125 degrees then let it sit for about 20 minutes, it was a perfect medium.  I took the pan juices and scrapings, added 1/2 cup of merlot and 2 cups of beef broth. I reduced it for about 10 minutes and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Like most of the time I use allrecipes, I use a variety of techniques from several recipes.  Some parts of this recipe are crucial to making an excellent, fool proof prime rib.  First is letting the meat come to room temperature (although I personally would not let it sit for 3 horus).  Second is using the flour and spice mixture after patting it dry. Third is searing the roast in a very hot oven (I did 500 degrees for 15 minutes).  I then turned my heat down to 350 for 15-20 minutes a lb.  I did a 7 lb roast that turned out perfectly.  There was barely any juice in the pan, which means it all stayed in the roast.

A very helpful recipe, which is why I gave it 5 stars although I did not follow it to the letter.

To us Prime Rib is the king of roasts and we enjoy it a few times a year.   This method is excellent - unforunately not all agree, but it works for us.  Thank you for giving others a very good method for cooking this wonderful cut of beef.

I made this Prime Rib Roast for our entire family for Christmas Eve 2010. My son in law has not stopped talking about how great it was, and he's a beef man! He's getting it again, July, for a special treat and I'm not going to change a thing! It's the best prime rib ever, even better than Lawry's in Beverly Hills. It's a WOWOWWWWOWWWWW.

I made this last night for our New Years Eve/Anniversary dinner and it was soooooooo yummy!  I absolutely love the rub and it definitely seals in the juices!  I have made these before with the roast already seasoned at the store and yes, the roast spits and sizzles and smokes while it cooks.  It is messy!  This recipe, however, did not do that!  The flour coating locks all of the juice in so it does not end up all over the walls of your oven.  Even better than that  though is that the meat is soooooooo tender and juicy because the juice stays *inside* where it belongs.  I even doubled the salt because I like its flavor.  Fabulous recipe, thank you so much.  Everybody likes their meat done to different levels of doneness so the person cooking it needs to decide how well done they will cook it.  I like mine very rare so I cut down the cooking time.  One person can NOT predict each person's pallet, so we need to take some of the responsibility in the cooking length.  If you want to cook a prime rib that tastes as good as it looks, than you have found the perfect recipe right here.  :o)

This recipe should not be used for a trimmed prime rib roast.  I was always a bit afraid to cook a prime rib because of the cost of the meat.  After reading all the wonderful reviews for this recipe I decided to try it for the 10 people I invited over this weekend.  15 minutes per pound and it was horribly overdone - not a bit of pink.  The flour in the mixture coating the roast was black/burnt.  I was terribly embarrased.

Way too hot and way too long!
Here's my foolproof way:
Roast in a preheated 450 degree F oven for 25 minutes. 
Reduce the heat to 325 degree F and roast about 2 hours longer for medium-rare.(DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR!!!)
I use a probe thermometer with an alarm set to 115F... 
it will continue cooking to 120F during the resting period...
always perfect medium rare!!! It never fails...

decided to try a new recipe to get a tastier crunch to the roast and try for something juicier than what I've managed to do in the past.  Now I know..."low and slow is the way to go".  The temp on this is waaaaay to high!  Within an hour my kitchen and home was filled with smoke from the extreme heat which basically just dehydrated a beautiful piece of meat and it cooked way too fast and was well done in no time (I was trying for medium rare).  Never again!  Should have read ALL the comments - there were some that agreed with this and those are the ones I should have listened to.  The rub was tasty - that's about all that is good about this recipe.  Save your dinner and avoid this recipe!!!

I too was a little worried making this as my family has always roasted prime rib on a low temp for a long time. I have never made prime rib myself before and was making it for my husbands grandparents. I decided to follow the recipe exact except I didn't cut the ribs off. I just left them on and placed them down on the pan with the fat turned up. I did a cut that was just over 5 lbs and it took a little longer than 15min/lbs however I think that is because I was cooking other items in the oven at the same time. I took it out at 120 degrees because I was paranoid of over cooking it as my husband and grandpa like their beef on the rare side. It heated up to 140 degrees before we cut it and it was great. It was rare/medium rare, which was great. I will use this recipe from now on for prime rib.

This is the BEST recipe for Prime  Rib!!!!  3 years ago on  Christmas Eve I tried a Prime Rib.  It was horrible!!!  It cooked for over 6 hours and still wasn't done!!  I vowed never to do one again, too much money lost on that meal.  Then I came across this recipe.  I tried it this evening and it was absolutely PERFECT!!!!  I followed the recipe to a "T" for a 8.39 lb Prime Rib Roast (4 ribs).  The only thing that happened was the flour got on the bottom of the pan and smoked us out a bit, but I left the door open and some fans going.  Otherwise it was amazing.  It cooked in just under 2 hours.  I took it out and let it rest for almost 45 minutes.  There were well done pieces on the ends for my sister in law and myself, and medium rare in the center for my parents.  Everyone was thrilled with how delicious it actually was!!!  Thank you Barbara for this amazing recipe.  Please, stop the bickering and try this recipe.  It is so worth the little bit of effort to make.  I will DEFINATELY be making Prime Rib every Christmas Eve thanks to this recipe!!!

First let me say that I prepared my first time ever rib-in roast -11 pounds - using this recipe.  I adjusted the recipe accordingly.....
First the smoke was rediculous and this started within 30 minutes of putting it in the oven. I hade to turn off the power for my  firealarm system.
 I went by a calculation of 15 minutes per pound as per the weight of the roast and the butchers recommendation.  I took it out at 2hrs and 45 minutes - which should have rendered a relatively medium rare roast - and let it sit for 1 hour.  It was medium well when I cut cut it - however as the pp stated, tender and juicy anyway.  I do not think I would make it again - the house still smells like a roast.

Selected three stars, because I haven't tried it yet.  Can someone tell me if you are supposed to keep the oven at 425 the entire time, or turn it down at some point.  Also, if I only have about a 9 pound roast, would that change my time and temp?  Thanks!

Great way to make Prime Rib.  I cooked it just like Barbara said too, but based on other reviewers I cut the time down to 15 min a pound.  Not quite long enough.  I wanted Med/Rare, and got rare.  Next time I will go for 17/18 min. a pound.  I also didn't let it sit long enough with the foil cover, but that was my son's fault.  He had to leave so I had to move up the standing time.  Again, all my own fault.   
It was the juiciest Rib Roast ever.  Thanks for all the years coming up with this Barbara.  It's now my go to recipe.

After years of trying and failing at Prime Rib this was amazing!!! The meat was so tender, I left the bones on the roast so it took almost 2 hours to cook a 4 lb roast. After it sat for twenty minutes i could of taken it out of the over about 15 minutes earlier as i had no med rare meat. Didn't matter though.  It was awesome, I added a small amount of water to the pan when the dripping started to smoke, and I basted the roast after that about twice. I tented in tinfoil and also wrapped a tea towel over the roast. I can't wait to make again and next time I am going to load the meat with garlic cloves first. Confidence building recipe...thanks!

I used this recipe for a boneless prime rib roast and it was perfectly done. Cooked it for 20 minutes per pound at 425F and put some water in the pan and had nice juices for gravy. Delicious!

425 is way too high to cook this roast at for the entire cooking process.  My roast was done in 2 hours and it was burnt, dried out and WELL done. My family wasn't eating for another 3 hours.    I will say that the seasoning mix is very good, although I didn't have an celery seed so I substituted Rosemary and Dried Parsly and it was delicious. Cooking instructions definitely need to be tweaked.  I was very disappointed.

I made this tonight using a fairly small, 4 lb Rib Eye Roast that I got on sale, and it was delicious! I was using a meat thermometer, and it took a little longer than I expected to cook, but the temp rose really fast while I was letting it rest. As advertised, it was moist and tender when sliced, even though my hubby likes it cooked medium to well. I"ve tried slow cooking a roast before with decent results, but I think this was even more tender.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe- rib roasts are expensive cuts of meat, and now I can cook them with confidence!

Excellent.  I have never cooked Prime Rib before and prepared this for a crowd.  We wanted well-done since most of our guests prefer this.  Easy, incredible and our company raved about this.

I just finished Christmas Dinner with a 20 lb Choice Rib Roast. Added fresh chopped rosemary and Montreal Seasoning to recipe.I rubbed Olive oil on roast then flour mixture. I had lots of other dishes going and forgot to set timer. Temperature got to 140 and i pulled it out. Even though it was over cooked it was still moist and had raves about flavor. I will try again for New Years and will achieve perfection! I won't worry anymore.

came out amazing! followed almost exactly. Didn't have garlic powder so used minced. Also didn't have celery seed but it didnt affect anything. I seasoned this meat the night before the party. 
Awsome recipe. It was my first time cooking this type of pricey meat.

This was so easy to make and it was WONDERFUL!!  This was my first attempt at Prime Rib and everyone loved it!  I had 2 smaller ribs (one 3.5 lbs and one 4 lbs), so I doubled the flour and seasonings to adequately cover both- I could have used just a single recipe- I really, really coated it (which was really sealed in the juices- only fat drippings in pan).  This was so juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and did 20 mins/ lb. and baked at 425.  They didn't come all the way to room temp. before I coated and baked them (which I think added about 15 mins), and turned out very tasty.  I served with the bacon wrapped asparagus and roasted red potatos (also from this site) and my version of a spinach strawberry salad.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  My husbands taste buds were in heaven at dinner tonight :)

I cooked a 5 lb prime roast without ribs.  The roast was excellent.  I have to admit that I took it out a few minutes early fearing that it would be over cooked for our tastes... it was actually slightly redder than I wanted.  Next time I wont cheat...I will follow the recipe exactly.

WATCH the TIME! My first time with prime rib. I had a 16lb prime roast. Brought it to room temp for 3 hours. I covered it with the exact seasonings listed adding chopped garlic. Covered it and roasted 15 min at 425, then reduced heat to 325 (using oven thermom) at the 3hr mark, I checked the roast with a thermometer and it was  150 already. too done for me. I let it set out tented for almost and hour because it was done too early. Rave reviews from guests but not what i like which is med rare. next time I will check at 2.5 hrs. good flavor and very tender, just too done for me.Update: roast uncovered. This years roast 13.5 lb took 1.5 hr to get to 120 deg...with additional .5 hr on counter tented with foil...perfect

Christmas dinner 2009. Absolutely the best prime rib I've ever made. I had a roast weighing just over 9 lbs and like others, didn't remove the ribs. Roasted for about 2 1/2 hours and let it rest for 30-45 minutes. I made a horseradish cream sauce and also had au jus to serve with the meat. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, spinach salad, and dinner rolls. A simple, elegant, uncomplicated, elegant meal. Rave reviews all around. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for submitting.

I have to write this review before I go to bed, and trust me, I am exhausted from Christmas dinner!  My guests were saying they have never had prime rib this good, not even at a restaurant.  I couldn't believe I had done it.  Everyone was happy because I waited until the temp was about 140 on a 9 pound roast.  I let it sit for an hour and it was still warm, but the middle was medium rare and the outside was a perfect medium to medium well.  I made the full recipe of flour and only had a little extra.  I didn't have celery seed so I put in a little less salt and then put in 1/2 tsp of celery salt instead.  You have got to try this!

Yes. I finally found out how to bake a prime rib. Worked as described. Put it on a rack in the roasting pan and all was fine. I see also need to let sit.

Best Prime rib in a while. I took it out at 125 degrees.  Need 6 hour total for recipe for a 8 lb rib roast.  Reccomend letting it sit wrapped in foil for 1.5 hours after removal from oven.  Will finish cooking on the counter.

I was originally looking to make a plain roast beef for Thanksgiving, but all Costco had was Prime Rib Roast. I never made one before and never heard of this cut of meat.  So I turned to this site for help.  I followed this recipe pretty much except that I added no flour and added additional seasonings.  I also cut up some onions, carrots, potatoes, and celery.  I only rested the meat outside of the refrigerator for about an hr due to time constraints.  I lined the pan w/ foil, but also covered my entire pan with foil as my grandmother taught me (it prevents meat from drying out). I was cooking two 6 lb rib roasts and we like our beef med-well.  The meat was so moist and tender.  I made the mistake of cutting the layer of fat off of the top for health reasons. I read after the fact to keep it on so it can baste the meat. Despite that mistake, the meat was not dry at all.  There were plenty of juices and we made a light gravy w/ it.  All of our guests enjoyed it as well.  Thank you for allowing me to use this recipe as a guide.  In the future, I'll try it again and perhaps try out the recipe as written.

The recipe is fantastic and always gets great raves from my guests.  I always use a meat thermometer though and take it out when the internal temperature reaches 120 degree F.  The longer you tent the meat the more it will keep cooking.There is also an interesting method on food wishes.com where you roast the meat 500 degree F for 5 Min/the extact weight of the meat and then turn off the oven and let it sit undisturbed for two hours.  This works very well too, if you like your roast rare/medium rare.  However, I did not get the drippings for an au jus like I do with this recipe.  Enjoy!!!!!

I felt like a restaurant chef after cooking this roast.  It turned out delicious.  
After the roast was done, I left the roast in the oven (turned off) for approx. two hours... did not open the oven door during the two hours..  the roast was so tender and delicious

Great recipe as long as you don't want to make gravy from the drippings. The tin foil and flour coating make that difficult. But I did like that it was easy to clean up afterwards. I had a really small roast that was just over 2 lbs which was done in about 45 minutes, so I cooked my potatoes in the roast pan with the roast and they were both done at the same time.

I made my first prime rib following this recipe to the letter, and it turned out great!  I cooked it in my convection oven, which shortened the cook time by about half.  I cooked it at 20 minutes per pound, the first 30 minutes @ 425 and lowered the temp to 350 for the duration of the cook time.  I took it out with an internal temp of 125, which rose about 10 degrees during resting.  It was perfectly medium/medium rare.  Highly recommend this recipe, it's easy and the results are great.  Quite reassuring results for first-timers with an expensive roast.  Tasted great!

Just made one 13 pound and one 4 pound for a work gathering; amazing recipe - for 13 people there was only a small amount left to have a couple of sandwichs.  I modified by placing slivers of garlic clove all along the tops and added herbes de provence to the flour mixture.  I also adjusted time and temp down for the 4 pounder - using the adage, after searing them both for 15 minutes at 425 F, of 12-14 minutes per pound for rare.  They were juicy, rare and the taste was terrific.  The meat was juicy and I kept resisting the temptation to baste - excellent advice.  Between the time they were covered - in the original roasters - and driven to the party (15 minutes in 15 degree weather!) they were perfect temperature and like butter to cut.  Use a meat thermometer! The recipe can't be beat!

I was skeptical of this recipe but decided to try it because of all of the positive reviews. I love it! The meat was moist and so flavorful, from now on this is how I am making my prime rib. I didn't have 3 hours to leave it out so left it for almost two. Next time I will give it the full time. Great recipe, thanks so much Barbara!

This came out perfect 1st time with this formula.  I only had a 4.5lb roast, so scaled it back. Cooking time with my oven was about 15min per lb.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is wonderful!  I've  never put a rub on prime rib before and was a little bit nervous about doing it, but I am so happy I did.  My husband just raved about the flavor and how juicy it was.  This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe was excellent!!! I did alot of research before I decided on this one. My husband raved that it was the best he has ever had. I followed the recipe exatly and the outer crust came out awesome. As with any roast the timing and temp are crucial.(as well as the planets and stars being in alignment) I read everyone's reviews and set the oven to 425. I had a 10lb roast so at 15 min a pound it should have taken about 2-1/2 hours. I inserted a meat thermometer and the roast was 150 at 2 hours. I let it rest for a half an hour.  My only advise to others would be to get a good meat thermometer.  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!! I will make it again and again!

Flavor was perfect!!  One suggestion - don't count on the timing for doneness - instead use a thermometer to test!!

I followed the recipe but roasted with the rib bones attached.  It did exactly as described, with the fat ending up in the bottom of the roaster and the juices sealed inside.  Now, a word of caution.  The larger the roast, the less time per pound this beast needs to roast!  My 20lb roast only took about 2 to 2 1/2 hours to reach 120 degrees. I started it way too early and let it get a bit too done.  Even then, it was still slightly pink in the middle and juicy, juicy, juicy - not to mention tasty!  So I would say for anything over 15 pounds, you really don't need to adjust the time.  Just be sure to use a meat thermometer and you can't go wrong with this one!

I followed the instructions exactly for my 3 pound Prime Rib Roast. It was wonderfully tender and juicy! The flour really did hold the juices in and it wasn't a bit overdone.

I have used this recipe numerous times with various sizes of prime rib and it always come out perfect. The rub seals in the juices and the roast gets a beautiful sear on the outside. If you use a meat thermometer you will have perfect results.This is my go to recipe for rib. Thank you!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly but this was the most incredible prime rib I have ever had.  The crust and juiciness were amazing.  I used more salt (1/4 C sea salt and 1/4 C garlic salt) but everything else the same.  I roasted it at 350 for 2 - 2 1/2 hours.  It measured 120 when I took it out and went up to 130 which is right for medium rare.  We let it rest for an hour.  When we cut it the very center was just a hair on the rare side. Next time I'll try the 425 searing.  I would still do the amount of salt.  It did not come out too salty.  I even added 1 1/2 C madeira and 1/2 C water to the bottom of the pan for au jus. It was incredible.

Made several Prime ribs. Used on other roast. Great every time. Watching temp is very important. I pull at 130......by the time I slice I am in the 140's.

I wanted something special for our New Year's Day dinner so I got a prime rib roast and used this recipe. The only change I made was to add a bit of steak spice to the rub. The flavour was wonderful and the roast was SO tender and juicy. It got raves from everyone. I'll be keeping this recipe even though I probably won't use it often since this cut of meat is so expensive. Well worth the try though.

Excellent! I have tried so many prime rib recipes and this one does as it promises. It was so juicy and had a great mixture of well done to rare (for my husband). I cooked a 7 lb roast for about 1 hour and 40 minutes. I let it sit, covered, for another 30 minutes. Perfect!

I was looking for a good seasoning mix for my tenderloin steaks. I seasoned exactly as you advise for the roast, and it was fantastic. The meat was so tender. Even my husband raved. Thanks very much for posting this recipe.

Good recipe. Fat rendered on the bottom of the pan can get quite smoky. Took days to get the smell of smoking fat out of my house! Make sure you have good ventilation.  Served this for New Years and everyone loved it!

made this roast for xmas - the people who like their meat medium loved it - too bad there were more medium rare at my table.  425' way too high at 20 minutes per pound for medium rare.... need to both lower temp and shorten cooking time as others suggested - otherwise worked well and will try again at lower temp.

I made this true to the recipe.  My roast was a 5 lb rib roast with 3 ribs.  I cooked it per instructions, 20 minutes per pound and my roast was done medium.  I suggest you check your oven temperature and cook accordingly as many ovens differ.  The spice mixture was perfect and I would not change a thing.  I will make again!

I have made this recipe a few times now, and so have a couple of people I know.  For me, the recipe worked exactly as described...the only difference was I only cooked it to 125 degrees for your typical med-rare.  For those out there that think it should be cooked slower, at a lower temperature, I think that if you just follow it exact you will realize how amazing this recipe is.  Trust me on this one, don't mess with a good thing!!!  Thanks for the Recipe!!!!

Turned out excellent! I cooked 15 min. per pound. I added about 1 cup of water to bottom of pan to avoid the flour from burning. I put on a roasting rack inside the roasting pan. I will definitly use this method and recipe again!

Ruthy83 is right. There is no au jus. I used a can of campbells beef consumme or double strenght broth. I always use this method when I make this roast. There is really nothing in the bottom of the pan but very little rendered fat. No juice escapes from the roast. I have made this roast about 4 times since I read the recipe. The first time it is a leap of fate but when you see how it comes out it is worth the uncertainty. Way to go Barbara. You have developed a new way to cook a Prime rib and I will use this recipe agian and agian.

Outstanding flavor.  Cooked quicker than expected, but I like mine more towards the well done, so I was very happy!  Husband even liked this method of cooking.

I followed this recipe precisely.  I used a meat thermometer and removed the roast at 125 degrees, F. It was superb!
Ends were med/well and center was rare.
I would recommend this one time & time again.

This turned out well for us. I was nervous about cooking a $40 piece of meat. I followed the directions exactly. The only problem was that our roast got a little overcooked. I calculated it at 140 minutes, since our roast was 7 lbs, and even took it out 20 minutes early when the meat thermometer said 125. It sat for maybe 20 min before we cut it and ended up being more of a medium well - mostly brown with a pink center. Not the medium rare we were going for, but delicious nonetheless. We had it with horseradish.

This roast was the best we ever made. We followed the heat directions with temp at 425 and cooked 15 minutes per pound. Let roast rest covered for 45 minutes. Roast was a perfect medium rare in the center with the ends being on the medium side. Our roast was 6.33# so we cut the seasonings in half. Had never tried coating with flour this created a nice crust.

Worked great.  Followed some other reviews with small changes.  Added a little cayenne to the rub.  Will need more next time.  As one mentioned, I had a little left over, but not a great deal.  

Cooked a 9.5lb rib at 425F for about 20 minutes to start/crisp it up which worked great then dropped to 350F.  It appeared to be getting close to 120 within about 2hrs, so I dropped the temp to 325F to time up with the rest of the meal.  

I also added 2c of water to the pan, as the rib was sitting on a rack.  I had dry aged the rib for about 2.5 days, so was worried about juices, but cutting into the rib after 45min rest, the juices started coming out.  Gravy or jus was not needed as the meat was plenty tender and juicy.  But still managed to make some gravy from the tidbits in the bottom of the pan with some beef stock and flour.

This was delicious! I used the ingredients listed and cooked for 15 minutes per pound. Covered with foil and rested for 45 minutes and it turned out to be a perfect medium rare. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I have to admit, I used this recipe for the spices. Which on a roast isnt that overly complicated to start with. Makes a great outside coating. I get my thawed roast out of fridge about 3hours before cooking time and let it warm up. Then I poke it with a serving fork several times and coat it with olive oil. Then I rub the spices in. The 1st 30minutes are at 425 then another 45 at 350. Then I turn the oven off and let it cook on its own for 2hours or so. Then about 90minutes before chow time, I turn the oven back on and put the meat thermometer in it. I like mine to be about 145ish when I take it out. Let it sit for 20-30 minutes before slicing. Ends are usually Medium Well. From the 2nd slice on in, Perfect Medium.

A one star simply because roasting at 425 degrees the entire time is too much and will result in a dried out, over-cooked roast.  See other recipes for appropriate temperatures.

I have prepared numerous prime rib roasts through the years; this recipe was foolproof.  I had run out of celery seeds so subsituted a little celery salt.  It still came out beautifully.  I roasted annabella potatoes, parsnips and a couple of carrots around the roast.  Next time I will add some onions.
As there was little to no roast drippings I relied on some gravy stashed in the freezer and had to forgo making yorkshire pudding   Next time I will add some of the scant drippings to some  oil to produce the required fat for the yorkshires.  This roast was perfectly cooked, flavourful and will be my go to recipe for prime rib next time I serve it.

Perfect! Made this last Christmas Day for the first time. It was wonderful. I was not a huge fan of prime rib but my family loves it so they won the dinner choice.  This recipe changed my mind. I had to leave out the onion powder as I am allergic to it but it was wonderful without. 
Tomorrow I will follow this recipe for the fourth time and don't have to wonder how it will taste!

First time making prime rib. Next time I would do what the other half of the cooking population uses for the outside. Pepper and garlic.  The cooking time for this particular receipe was very confusing. The written part says to bake for like 5 hours while the top says something like 2 hours.   I noticed that after it was at the high temperature for 1 hour 30 minutes. At that time I turned it down to 225 degrees for the remaining 3 hours. I had a 10 pound chunck of meat and the timing worked out good. The meat was medium. I suggest reading the prime rib article to the left side of the page for cooking suggestions. My husband can't wait for me to try prime rib again. Thank you for sharing. I never thought I could make this at home. It was very good.

Loved it!  I cooked a much smaller roast -- 4.5 lbs. -- and just adjusted the cooking time.  I also used minced fresh garlic, instead of garlic powder, and that made it even better.  The end cuts were fabulous!

made this for xmas & it was pretty good.  i had a 6lb boneless roast..i loved the flour/herb mix on the finished roast.  i believe the heat may have been too high for my roast; it was tender and med-rare in the middle (as i wanted it), but the grain of the meat was visible and you could feel the texture as you chewed it.  every good restaurant prime rib ive ever had was almost the consistency of room-temp butter.  a great recipe but i need more trial and error w/ it.

Cooked a 15 lb roast.  While flavor-wise, it was very good and still very tender and juicy, the temperature is way too high for the doneness levels and times listed.  Four hours yielded a nearly well done roast.  Either lower the temp or cook for considerably fewer minutes per lb.  Just to be sure, I checked the temp of my oven during cooking with a stand up thermometer on the same rack as the roast.  It was accurate.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner this year.  It was the easiest and by far the BEST prime rib I have every had.  The meat was so juicy and tender; I was able to cut it with my fork.  The only change I made to the recipe was to cut slits into the rib roast and insert garlic cloves into the slits.  I removed the roast after 2 hours of baking. The internal temperature was 145 and raised to 155 after resting. The middle of the 8 lb roast was cooked to medium, with the end cut just barely at medium well to well done.

I made this for the 1st tinme on Christmas. I follow the ingredients for this roast even though mine was 8lbs. I put it in the oven at 500 degrees for 30 minutes like the butcher told me and then reduced it down to 375 for 90 minutes. It was pink in the center at 160 degrees. It was perfect. Everyone loved it like I have made it for years.

We've tried several rib recipes from this site and this was by far the best.  I put the flour mixture into an old spice container and shook the coating on.  Within a half hour the whole house smelled delicious.      This will remain my go to roast recipe.

This is the best recipe I've ever used for prime rib. I usually only do a 4-5 pound roast & reduce the ingredients accordingly. I've made it several times and cooking at the temps as per the recipe, it turns out perfect every time. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Have tried several prime rib recipes, however this seems to be the best.  We made gravy with the drippings and poured it over garlic mashed potatoes and it was excellent!

I made this recipe for Easter and everyone said it was THE BEST prime rib roast they ever tasted! The only change I made was using rosemary instead of celery seed (personal taste). I cooked a 9.5 lb roast with the ribs attached and followed Barbara's preparation instructions exactly. I elevated the roast with a small roasting grill and it was done in 1.5 hours at 140 degrees. It came out medium and as juicy as you could imagine - just like she said it would. Thank you Barbara for this fabulous rescipte.

Terrific recipe! Perfect the way it is, but if you are "blood suckers" as my husband & I are, roast for 15 minutes per pound - than it will be perfectly rare all the way thru. Paired it with an outstanding Cab from Chile that I picked up at my local market for $10 bucks - Lapostolle Casa - a great find.

WOW!  Talk about moist and juicy.  I was skeptical because it required such little time in the oven but it continues to cook under the foil until the exact doness.  What a great great find.

It was easy to make and the meat was flavorful but I did overcook a bit.  I think the temp needs to be a little lower.  Had a 10# roast and it was done in 2 1/2 hours.  I had to keep adding beef broth to the pan becaue it was smoking a little.  It sat out for about an hour and got too done while I was waiting on the side dishes.  I will try again but not exactly what I thought it would be.

This was one of the best prime ribs I've made. I had a 12 lb roast. Thankfully, I had a big one because I had a large crowd. There was a crowd surrounding the roast as it was being carved.   I used a digital thermometer in the meat as it was cooking and removed it when the temp hit 125 degrees. After it rested for at least 45 minutes it had reached 140 degrees. I would say it was more on the medium side of medium rare. I was really worried it might have over cooked but it really was perfect. There certainly wasn't much left. I served it with a mixture of sour cream and hot horseradish.   I did have some smoking but I think that was due to the oven needing cleaning then the roast cooking. Thanks Barbara for a truly wonderful recipe. I don't cook prime rib often but when i do, this will be my "go to" recipe.

I made this for my family for a pre christmas dinner.  It was a 12lb roast and we followed the directions by the letter and it was fabulous.  There was not even a piece of fat left over.  It served 25 adults and children.  I also had au jus and the meat was so tender and juicy most people didn't use the aujus.   This is a winner and I will definately make this again.  I was my first time making this roast because I was a little intimidated but I won't hesitate again.

This is a fantastic recipe and I have tried many different recipes for prime rib roast.  Since I had a much smaller roast (3lb, 2 bones) I did adjust the amount of flour and seasonings and left the bone in.  But definately don't be afraid to pack on the flour and seasonings onto the roast.  It really does seal in all the juices!  Awesome flavour! Looking forward to using this recipe again tonight for Christmas Eve dinner. Merry Christmas everyone!!

I thought this was a great way to cook prime rib. I loved the coating in this recipe as I am not a big fan of the heavy use of salt. I used my fancy talking thermometer and it was done to perfection. Thanks for posting this keeper!

According to the meat eaters of my family, this was incredible. I added beef broth to the bottom of the pan once the drippings really started to sizzle. I pulled the roast at 134 degrees and it was done perfectly for us. I separated the fat from the juice, used the fat to make yorkshire pudding and the rest of the juice made a wonderful Au Jus. Thank you Barbara!

This was my first time to make a boneless rib roast and it was amazingly delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and made it for our family Christmas dinner.  I let it sit under foil for 1 hour before carving.  The outside was medium, the inside was medium/rare.  We all loved it so I tried it again for a New Years Eve dinner party with friends and again, delicious!  I got the roast at Costco and it turned out better than any restaurant.  I will definitely make it when I want an elegant and easy dinner.

WOW!!!  This was my first time making prime rib. I followed this recipe exactly. I did a 6 lb. boneless roast. We all like our beef rare and medium rare. I did 15 minutes per lb. on 425 per the instructions. I did check my temperature at 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was at 113 degrees so I removed it and tented it well for 45 minutes and it was perfect. One of our guests was a former chef and she was impressed with how good it was. Thank you for this outstanding recipe. I will never use any other!  ***NOTE***  READ all the instructions and the very 1st review which is from the author. 15 minutes per lb at 425. It is that simple and that easy. Ignore the original recipe time for cooking as it is marked wrong for the 425 temp.

You say you are a professional cook, but I can't imagine any professional cook roasting a prime rib at 425. That's a sure way to destroy an expensive prime rib. It just isn't how it is done, period. Ask around. Professionals at the most acclaimed steak houses will tell you that the prime rib they serve up in the evening was put in the oven first thing in the morning. The idea is to cook it slowly, the more slowly, the better. Those who have tried this "fast and furious" or "singed earth" method and report back that they like the taste of charcoal should probably stick to burgers on the grill as they apparently have no appreciation for a properly cooked prime rib. Sorry folks, I have to be honest.

I used this recipe for a 8lbs roast for a xmas dinner for my in laws.
read over half of the reviews before getting started. I followed the
recipe to the letter. Wife and I have eaten in the best restaurants
her in N.C., this was the best prime rib we ever had. great crust, 
no smoked up kitchen, and wonderful flavor. All the juice stayed in
the meat after resting for 20 mins., no need for au jus. Just take
the time for the roast to get to room temp. before cooking, that is
the key. Use a meat thermometer with alarm, set it for how you like
it cooked and trust it, you want be sorry. THANK YOU for a great way
to cook prime rib.

I made a small 5.5 lb rib roast using this recipe (I halved the flour and seasonings). Roasted it on a rack, 15 minutes per pound. It was delicious. Slices ranged from med- well to med-rare. The meat was melt - in - your mouth tender. A perfect holiday meal.

Because of all of people’s issues with the meat getting overdone, we bought a digital thermometer that stays in the meat and has an alarm when either the time or temperature reached a certain point.   It was well worth the 20 dollars.  The time was shorter than we had estimated but it didn't matter because once we reached the right temp, the alarm went off and we took it out.  Was super tasty and had no jus because it was inside the meat. Felt like professionals.

I was going to give-up on making Prime Rib ,because I either overcook or undercook it, even using an themometer but decided to give it another try for Xmas dinner. This was so easy and delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly to our liking...medium. Outside was nicely browned and flavorful. This recipe really takes all the guesswork out of preparing such an expensive  cut of meat. I had a two bone, 3 pounder, and cooked it for an hour on 425...I used 20 min. per pound.
Tented it for 30. Fabulous! This will be my new go to for Prime Rib dinner. Thanks so much!

After reading the reviews, I cooked my 8.5 pounds roast at 425 for an hour and a half and 375 for another hour.  The roast was delicious (although I thought it could have used just a tad more salt) with a nice mixture of medium well for those who preferred it and medium for me.  The only changes I will make next time is to add more salt and perhaps use fresh garlic.  Nice recipe!

This roast tasted great, and I like the flour/spice rub.  HOWEVER, something was wrong with the timing.  I had 4lbs of meat, and roasted it for just over 90 minutes.  Meat thermometer said 135 degrees.  Let it rest for 30 minutes, as instructed.  Unfortunately, when we tried to slice it for Easter dinner, it was so rare it was still bleeding.  We had to finish it off in the crock pot and save it for the next day.  

According to my meat thermometer, you need to roast to an internal temp. of 160 degrees for medium.  I wish I'd known that ahead of time!

This was an excellent recipe. I changed the cooking temp as well to 325 for 3 hours for a 15 lb prime rib and then I lowered it to 250 for the last hour or so for a perfectly medium rare prime rib. Everyone is still complementing on how amazing it was and I was very impressed considering this was my first time to prepare it. Great recipe!

check the time.  rub is fabulous. my mother in law was always in charge of the roast, never a mistake, but i never watched her. she is no longer with us, so i made the roast on christmas eve, didn't check until it was to late. we checked at 3 hours and was already at 133 degrees, took out and let rest for 30 min. way to done. we like ours rare to med rare. it basically ruined my evening and cost me $165. the barn kitties are really enjoying the feast. i remember her putting the therm. in about hour and  a half into the roast and monitoring often.i have another roast in the ref.and am trying again  this week, i am going to figure this out for perfect rare roast.the rub is the best,even better than hers. it was very pretty, just very done. i am going to figure this out.

I followed the recipe  except for the oven temperature.  After 30 min. I lowered the temp to 350 for 3 hours. I took the roast out, covered with foil and had to let it sit for 1 hour waiting for the rest of the food.  The roast was delicious and perfect.  The difference for me was the flour coating.  It sealed in the juices and made the roast look great. There was a wonderful crisp coating to the edge of the meat. For an expensive cut of meat I was so nervous but it couldn't have been any better.  Served with a wonderful horseradish sauce.

Awesome recipe! I followed this exactly and it came out perfect!  We had a 4.2 lb roast, we cooked it for a little over an hour and let it set for 45 minutes or so.  We do not like it very rare and this came out perfect!    As the original poster stated, this roast loses none of it's juices so there is nothing left for au jus. I used a store-bought packet and substituted 1/2 cup of the water for port wine.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of fat from the roasting pan for added flavor.  The au jus turned out fantastic.  I will definitely be making this prime rib again!

Our prime rib turned out perfectly following this recipe.  I was leary of the 425 degrees, but after reading the reviews, decided to try it.  Our roast was almost seven pounds and we cooked it 1 hour and forty minutes, or just about 15 minutes per lb..  We did use a meat thermometer and took it out when it got to 120 degrees.  We let it rest for about 45 minutes wrapped in aluminum foil.  It was a perfect medium rare, moist, and delicious.  We have done prime rib for Christmas dinner every year with mixed results.  We've rotisseried, in tthe hot oven then turned the oven off, and started hot and then lowered the temp.  This one was wonderful and will be our preferred method of cooking from now on.

Excellent.  Prime Rib was always my favorite growing up.  My mom would make it when I would come home from college.  This beats it (shhh, don't tell her).  I have made this many, many times.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! Tastes great like a high-priced restaurant meal. I cooked a 4-lb standing rib roast using a few modifications based on reviews and the roast came out great. I cooked it at 425 for 30 mins, then 350 for 20 mins per pound. I also put a little water in the pan before placing in the oven.

This was the first time I made Prime Rib. Everyone loved it. I always feel that good meat doesn't need a whole lot of seasoning so this recipe appealed to me. My roast was only about 4 pounds. I cooked it on 350 for the first 1.5 hours and for the last hour on 425. The people I cooked for do not like medium rare. . . so I had to over cook it some. My only downfall that It was not tender enough. . which was my fault. I did not let it sit long enough before I cut it. I was in a hurry to eat!   Also, because of time restraints I had to cook it faster than I wanted to. Overall, This recipe was great. I will make this again.

We made an 8lb. roast, following this recipe. It was delicious! Not overcooked at all. I thought it was awesome that no juices escaped the meat, it was juicy and delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe, we will be using it over and over I am sure!

I had a 15 lb roast and baked it for 4.5 hours. Almost immediately after I put this prime rib roast in the oven deliciously mouthwateringly obscene smells began pouring out! My guests didn't arrive on time so my roast sat in foil for an hour longer after removing from the oven, which caused it to be a bit well done throughout. If that ever happens again I will remove the foil and place in a barely warm oven. And yes I will make this again and again!

OK I followed the directions to the letter for an 8lb Bone in Standing Rib. Pulled the roast out at 120 degrees and set it aside while I made Yorkshire pudding from the fat dripping, which were plentiful.  Started carving when digital thermometer read 140. Guess I need a new digital thermometer because the roast was medium well on the ends and medium in the middle.  I ate the ends and served all the other pieces to our guests. Everyone loved the flavor and it was very juicy. I loved the end pieces as I felt that had the best flavor but would have preferred my meat to be more medium rare rather then medium well done.  Overall I rate this as a very good recipe. What I will change is the meat thermometer and pull the roast out at 110 to 115 degrees and start carving when the temp hits 130 to 135.  Didn't have any problems with smoke and there was plenty of fat drippings in the bottom of the roast pan, over a cup and half of fat dripping. Plenty to make 12 individual yorkshire pudding cups.   I have saved this recipe and made notes for myself for the next time I make this roast. My only disappointment was how quickly this roast cooked once I got over 100 degrees and how quickly it cooked once it came out of the oven.

It was my first time cooking prime rib for the Holiday's, and this recipe caught my eye.  Not only was it simple, but it truly looks gorgeus after cooked.  I submitted a photo, since it speaks for itself.  I do want to say that I didn't cook the roast @ 425 the entire cook time and that is the reason I only rated the recipe 4 stars.  It got smokey and may have burnt the outside too much if I had.  I cooked the roast for 45 mins @ 425 and then and additional 1 hr @ 350 until the thermometer said 155, just about medium.  The roast was so juicy and we had left overs the next day for lunch and it tasted just as fresh and juicy as it did fresh out of the oven.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you!

This was the best recipe for Prime Rib that I have ever used! I followed Barbara's instructions exactly, except I didn't have onion powder so I substituted onion soup mix and I didn't have enough time to let the meat sit out the whole 3-hours before roasting. I used a 5.5 lb boneless roast, so I set the oven timer for 1.5 hr. There was no burning or smoking during roasting as I made sure there was no loose flour or liquids at the bottom of the pan prior to roasting. I did run into a problem, though. With 30 min. roasting time left, the meat thermometer read 130, so I immediately removed the roast as we like med/rare. I let it sit covered for 30 min prior to carving. The ends were beautifully done, but the center was too raw (even for us). I was able to save the roast by slicing a couple steaks off each end, pressed some of the left over seasoned flour mixture on each side of the roast, and stuck it back in the oven for 30 minutes, which was the time left from the total cooking time of the recipe. Whe the time was us, I took it out and let it stand for 30 more min. and the meat was perfectly med/rare. My advice is to be sure you have an excellent meat thermometer! Thank you Barbara for a great recipe!

This recipie is awesome.  Was very hesitant with the high temperature but it was perfect.  Roast turned out so moist and flavorful.  For those that have commented on the temperature.....don't knock it till you try it.  Thanks much for the fail proof method.  Definitely a keeper.

We thought this roast was delicious!  We only did a 4 pound roast so the recipe had to be adjusted but we thought the spices were just right, the cook time was just right, and everyone in the house ate it up.  Thanks for the recipe!  This one's a keeper.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner for the first time and it came out perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did have to cook a little longer than what it said but that could just be my roaster oven. Everyone raved, even my husband who only likes tenderloin steaks!  Thank You for a great recipe!

** updated rating **  I used this recipe on a 20 lb roast on Christmas;  the quantity of rub was sufficient, even for the large hunk of meat!  the one thing I did a little differently was to cook the roast for 15 at 475 first, then down to 325 for the remainder.  I was using a roasting oven, rather than traditional.  cooking time was about 3 hours - and the meat was perfect - everyone raved!

I come from a beef farm, so I've had lots of prime rib before, and not much success cooking it.  I cannot say it was the best Prime Rib I have ever eaten, however it is the best I have ever made. I used my digital thermometer that stays plugged in, so it did not get over cooked. The top of mine was so hard I couldn't cut through it, but perfectly moist inside. This could just mean that I really need that new oven I've been pulling for though. I will definitely try this again with a little less heat. Cutting the ribs off first and re-tieing was an awesome tip.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was one of the best rare to medium - rare prime ribs I've ever had. I read a lot of comments and people that leave it bad reviews are not using a thermometer, they are trying to cook by timing it. It is very simple, cook it until the internal temperature is about 5 degrees under what you want it to be and let it rest. If you use a thermometer it will turn out great.

Seasoning recipe spot on, but if you cooke it at 425 for 20  min a lb it will be medium to medium well. I cooked it for 30 min at 425 then turned to 300 for about 20 a lb. for mid-rare

Best recipe you'll ever use for prime rib! I've made it for 3-years for Christmas and have fantastic results and got  OMG! raves. It's that good. Only I've learned to  roast at  15-minutes per pound, works for me, and use an instant read thermometer for a perfect roast for the preferred doneness. And make sure you let the 'whole' roast  come up to room temp. Very important for desired results.

I made a 6.3 lb roast. According to the directions, I roasted at 425 for 2 hours and 10 minutes. (20 minutes per pound). At the 1:45 mark, there was no reading on the thermometer. at the 2:15 mark, the roast would have had 10 minutes to go according to the instructions. The roast was already at 160 degrees - over done & ruined. I'll agree with another reviewer that 425 degrees is too hot to roast for 20 minutes per pound. So is 20 minutes.

I chose this recipe because it  seemed the easiest for a first timer.  Turned out I was wrong.

OMG - I made a 4lb prime rib roast yesterday exactly as the recipe stated. My husband recalculated the amounts of flour and spices to suit the 4lbs. I made a packet of lower sodium brown gravy, such as McCormick's, and I added what little au jus there was to it. 

 I've been terrified of making a prime rib roast, but this turned out better than I could have imagined. The flour mixture on top of the meat roasts to a golden "crust".  All the juices stayed inside the roast as promised. Talk about restaurant quality! That's an understatement. I don't think I'll ever use another recipe for prime rib, that's how happy we were with the results. TIP: Must have a digital thermometer for this to ensure perfection.

Perfection! I like.others, was concerned about the high heat but decided to cross my fingers and give it a try. Had a 7 1/2 lb roast and it was a perfect 120 degrees after 1 hour and 45 min., let it rest for 30 min while finishing the sides and it was a perfect med rare. The coating was delicious with just the right amount of seasoning (I did add a tsp of steak seasoning). Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and technique!

NOTE:  ALWAYS USE A MEAT THERMOMETER!
I made a 15 lb prime rib roast at 425 degrees and 20 min per pound like the recipe states.  My roast was done1 hr. before it was suppose to be according to mathematical calculations.  Loved the rub.   My roast was juicy and tender.  I would make it again and for this size of roast I would expect a roasting time of approx. 3-3 1/2 hrs.  All ovens very.

Heartbroken...  my mom suffered a stroke earlier this year, but she was determined to do Christmas Eve dinner today.  Unfortunately, she had a bad spell this morning, so I jumped in to do my best to keep things on track.  My mom's a fanatic for medium rare Prime Rib, and we spent a fortune on the roast this year.  I came to All Recipes for advice, and based on the recommendations of so many - in spite of concerns about the 425f - I chose this recipe to guide me.

As soon as my mom was in the car to go to Christmas Eve service, I popped the roast in the 425f oven.  We were gone for all of 80 minutes, and should have had another twenty five to spare - even adjusting to 15 mins. per pound.  But racing in from the car to check the temp on the roast, it was already up to 160f internal temperature.  I quickly removed it from the oven to let it 'rest' - as if there were any juices left to soak in.

I went about finishing the remaining dishes, and then carved the medium well to well roast.  It was dry, and even the outside was under-seasoned.  I know I shouldn't think this way, but this is very possibly my mom's last Christmas, and as I said - she's a fanatic about her Christmas Prime Rib (she's a fanatic of my cooking, usually, too!).  She (and everyone else) are trying to convince me it was 'just fine', but it really wasn't. I definitely let mom down by taking advice from this page, and I truly am heartbroken tonight.

At least they all are raving about my cranberry pecan quinoa pi

I made this nearly exactly as listed.  I only changed up the spices.  I used a thermometer in center of roast and took it out at 125 Degrees F.  I didn't time any part of it due to using thermometer.  Perfection!

425° was NOT too hot! Don't listen to the reviewers who tell you to cook at lower temp! I made according to recipe, only omitting celery seed as I didn't have any. This was awesome. It is important to let roast come to room temp before cooking. I had a 7 pound roast. Also important to blot dry before rubbing with flour mixture. I think I got the flour a little thick in places but the roast was still amazing. My son, who's never been a huge fan of prime rib, was groaning while eating this. He said he almost choked from all the juice running down his throat! It was SO tender and juicy! Could have been cut with a fork!  I cooked it for 2 hours and it was already up to about 150° so you may want to test earlier than 20 minutes per pound for medium. I'd say 15-17 minutes per pound. I took it out and let rest for probably 1 1/2 hours (until everything else was ready) and it came up to about 165° but was still quite pink. I then put in 200° oven for probably 10-15 minutes, just to warm the outside up a bit. It was very pink but not "bloody". Will definitely make prime rib again with this recipe. Since the only liquid in the pan was the rendered fat as the author promises, I made au jus using a couple of cups of beef broth made from Better Than Boullion paste (sold by broth and bouillon cubes, in a jar) and added a couple of Tablespoons of the au jus mix that comes in a little "jug" and it was amazing.

I did not use the flour. I used a package of dry au jus mixed with dried oregano, garlic powder, onion powder,  black pepper, smoked paprika, and dry finely milled coffee grounds. I didn't measure these ingredients...I eyeballed it. Used the celery seed as suggested. Next time I'll use dry mustard. I cooked at 425 for 15 minutes per lb. I like my meat rare. I was worried it would be over cooked. Started checking the temp after 30 minutes at 425. I took it out at an hour (4lbs) and let it rest for an hour with foil over top. 

Here are some tips:  1. Easy clean up - I used a disposable tinfoil liner in side my roasting pan. 
2.  Cooked it on a rack so the delicious crustiness was on top and bottom. 3.  Cup of water in the bottom of the pan. I did have a little juice at the bottom for the bone broth I'm making today. 4. The butcher cut the bones off but tied them to the roast for me. 5. I took my roast out 2 hours out of the fridge; seasoned it and left it on the counter until ready to cook.  6. Saved the ribs for today...making bone broth. 

This was delish. I'll definitely make it again and continue to tweak it to make it my own. This recipe is a keeper.

I came back to rate and review this recipe after reading some of the negative reviews. I felt I had to come back!!

My husband requested a prime rib roast for Christmas dinner  he went to the store and purchased a 5 pound prime rib roast around $60. day before yesterday and I went searching for a recipe for my son-in-law to make on Pinterest.
This was one of the first recipes that came up and I read it and it sounded and looked good.
I will tell anyone reading my post that MY Son-in-law done our roast just as BarbaraC28, the poster suggested, he added his ingredients to a bowl the only thing different there was he added 1 teaspoon Lawry's seasoning salt to the mix and did not add the other salt, then he put the seasonings into a 3 gallon zip bag and shook it around and then added the roast and rolled it and coated it and pressed the coating in really good he took it out of the bag and put it the roast on a rack in my roaster rack with the fat cap side up, he then inserted the meat thermometer into the center of the roast put the roast in the 425 pre heated oven and did NOT turn down the heat let the thermometer rise to 125 and took roast out of oven and draped with foil for 30 minutes. He cut with my electric knife and it was the juiciest, tenderest best roast we have ever had. Thank you BarbaraC28 for posting this recipe

I have NEVER attempted a prime rib roast before, but decided turkey, ham, lamb, just wasn't in the cards for our Easter dinner.  I looked over several recipes, but decided on this one, and I am glad I did.  Although I was tempted more than once to turn down the oven (425 scared me to death!), I stuck it out.  Having an expensive, grass-fed roast only made my nerves sway more.  I cooked exactly as directed and this was PERFECTION!  Fabulous flavor, juicy, tender, crisp outside, and devoured by my family!  Thanks Barb, for this recipe!  I don't think I could have selected a better one  :)

I just made this tonight, and I have to say it was absolutely wonderful!  First of all, the negative reviews about this being dry I cannot understand, unless they had an already trimmed cut (no fat).  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference was my cook time due to my roast only being 4 lbs.  I ended up cooking mine for 1 1/2 hours at 425.    You all need to remember that everyone has different types of ovens which is going to change the cook time.  I have a large 6.2 cu gas oven which ended in me adding another 20 minutes.  This is a most wonderful recipe.  The only change I am going to make is to insert slivers of garlic for more of a kick next time.  Thank you!!

I used this recipe for a 4 bone, 9lb roast. I did not do the room temp thing. At ~2 hrs, I began checking the internal temp. When it reached 120, I turned the oven off while I finished the rest of the meal, which took another 20 minutes. I then took the roast out of the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes before slicing. The outside slices were medium well. The inner slices were medium rare--both were juicy and delicious. I will use this recipe any time I prepare prime rib.

Great recipe, but I checked the temperature after an hour and half. It was sheer perfection for medium-rare. My family loved it.

Like many, we were leary of the high temperature for the duration....and we were wrong. It was perfect. This was a smallish roast (4 lbs 130z). I left the bones on. I've cooked rib roast numerous times in the past but they always seemed more "baked" than truly roasted (I can't think of a better description.)

This method really does turn out the restaurant-quality prime rib consistency you are looking for. Use 20 min/lb at 425F then remove and let sit.

This recipe turned out beautifully!  I followed the suggestions on cooking a bit longer, and along with my trusty thermometer, I was able to put a wonderful roast out for Sunday dinner

Timing of roast seems to be very tricky.  My 4 pound roast took only 45 minutes.   Fortunately I was using a meat thermometer and the resting stage is flexible so the vegetables can 'catch up''.

I tried this recipe on Christmas Eve for my family. I bought a 10 lbs rib roast and cooked it exactly as directed.  We wanted it rare so I cooked it for 15 minutes per pound.  I used a meat thermometer and let it raise to 120 degrees.  Then took it out of the oven, tented it for about 45 minutes.  When we cut into it, it was well done.  Very disappointed.  The meat, however was tender and good tasting, and there was not alot of splattering going on in the oven.

I used this recipe to cook a 4 1/2 pound boneless prime rib and it turned out fantastic!! Everyone loved it and went back for more. I followed the directions and ingredients exactly and my roast came out juicy, flavorful and medium rare. There were no drippings and my roast had very little faT but I did add a cup of water to the pan a few times while it was baking. I did let the roast sit for 45 minutes before carving it, it was still very warm.
Reading other reviews left me worried about what temperature and how long to cook this but this method worked perfectly!! Especially since I has other things cooking in the oven at the same time.

I will keep this simple, this recipe works great as long as you remember 2 key points. Use a meat thermometer and remove the roast from the oven once the internal temp hits 120 degrees, the roast will continue to cook as it sits, once it hits 140 or so you have a nice medium rare roast ready fir the table.

I followed the recipe exactly. I cooked a 12lb roast for 3 hours on 425 degrees. When I took it out it was at 140 degrees. I covered with aluminum foil and let it stand for 3 hours. Just before I served it I put it back in the oven on 425 for 20 min to warm. It turned out perfect. It was med well on ends and med in middle. It was so tender you could cut with a fork.

The flavor and crust from this recipe were superb. The only improvement I would suggest would be to cook 15 minutes per pound form medium, I cooked an 8.9 pound roast for 3 hours (@20mins/ pound). While still very tasty, the meat was not burned, but overdone, certainly not medium or medium well. We will try this again, gladly.

The first time, I tried this recipe was on Christmas 2010 for myself and family. And the following year l prepared this for my mother and step-father and they loved it. So now, my mother wants it every Christmas.  It is the best hands down...... I plan to do this same flour crust for my New York Loin Roast for this 2014 Xmas.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year and it worked very well.  Mom is an awful cook, she will admit it.  I learned this from her years ago and have used this technique on rump roasts and whole pork loins.  Who knew she had a great trick in this!  Juicy!

Followed the directions to the tee and it came out perfectly.  Definitely resonate the point about letting the roast reach room temp.  Raising it from the bottom of the roast pan was another excellent tip.  Color was nice, just enough spice for true meat lovers.   By far the most juicy roast I've ever made.  Big hit with family.    Don't understand what the fuss was over

For the past 20+ years I have prepared prime rib almost every Christmas eve for our family. In the past I have sprinkled garlic salt on top and just roasted it at 350 degrees. This year I decided to try something new and found this recipe. I tried it and it was excellent. There was no drippings on the bottom of the pan, just fat. It was moist, fork tender, and delicious. My entire family loved it. The only problem I had was that I cooked a 14 pound roast at 425 degrees and it was at 120 degrees in 2 1/2 hours. Even though it rested more than 2 hours, it was perfect. Great recipe, thank you!

I made this recipe today n our roast turned out perfect .  We like to eat our rib roast rare.  The only thing I did different was I cooked the rib roast at the suggested temp for one hour.  After it had a nice crust I turned the temp down to. 350.  It was perfect n the flavor was awesome.

Like others, I was a bit nervous about the cooking temp.  But, again like others, I was thrilled with the outcome.  My only modification to the roast rub was replacing the celery seed with 1 tsp powdered mustard.  Just a personal preference.

I'm very appreciative of this recipe's author.  We had an awesome Christmas Eve dinner thanks to this recipe!

Back again for another year of Christmas Prime Rib. This will be year 4 of using this recipe - and everyone raves about my prime rib.  I also was skeptical about the 425 temperature - but it works like gold.  This recipe makes me look like a pro in the kitchen every year. Thank you for sharing.

Made this for 2012 Christmas Eve Dinner and everyone loves it. It was moist and tender, came out perfect! The only change I made was using Montreal Steak Spice in place of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and celery seed.

I love prime rib & this is by far THE best recipe - better than prime rib I've had at many restaurants.  Literally gets 5 star reviews from my guests who do not hesitate to request I make it agin and again.   I usually use Paula Dean's cooking method (turning off oven for a period and then turning back on) because it really is fool proof.  I do have one question though - last time I made it, the roast was tied and after cooking, removing ties caused coating to fall off. It really screwed up the fantastic flavoring. I can't recall what I had done differently in the past that did not result in this problem. Making for Xmas eve again this year and could use diagnosis of my error, if anyone knows what I did wrong, please please please post!!!!!!

This was my first prime rib. I was afraid of the hight temp for so long, being used to cooking beef low and slow, but it came out perfect! I didn't have celery seed, so used celery salt and the results were excellent. There were no left overs! I will definitely make this again.

I made this according to the recipe except I was out of celery seed and paprika. The coating was very nice and did seal it. I cooked it at 425 degrees at 15 minutes per pound since the roast had been allowed to come to room temperature and it was a boneless roast. (In the review posted by the author, she quoted 15 min/lb.) Previously, I have used the method where I have started cooking at high temperature and then lowered it. I liked this method better. It did not take as long to bake and was still tender, juicy, and flavorful. I will use this cooking method in the future and may just try different seasonings in the coating as recommended by the original author.

This was so good and tender. Thanks BarbaraC28 for this recipe!!  I think you can add any extra seasonings that you like. I did cook it at 15 min/lb.  The taste was delicious!

I don't really like prime rib but my husband does so I made this for New Year's Eve.  He loved and I thougth it was pretty darn good.  Made great sandwiches with the left overs.  The coating was perfect.  I bought a meat thermometer that I could leave in and that was the key to cooking it a beautiful medium rare.  I did turn the heat down to 350 after the first 20 min at my butcher's suggesiton and that worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My guest and family enjoyed the flavor...This was the first time ever making prime rib.  My husband felt the meat was a little tuff.  I'm not sure it was the recipe or the quality of meat I bought.

This prime rib flavor was delicious.  I would recommend cutting the cooking time down to 3 hrs tops, i cooked mine for 3:45 and it was cooked all the way through.  I also cut slits in the prime rib and put in chunks of garlic before covering with the flour mixture.  How I made the au jus, was I bought 3 cans of campbells au jus and pour over the prime rib was cooking it, half a can at a time.  Place the first can on the bottom of the pan.  Family raved about the flavor and the au jus.

As Easy As It Gets! This recipe was exceptional for flavor and ease of preparation. I purchased a 10# boneless roast and at 425 it was baked to a temperature of 120 in 2.25 hours.   I will definitely make this again, but I think this time, I will lower the temperature as the meat was not as tender as when I have prepared it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time.  The coating is outstanding - exactly like a fine restaurant.

Made this for Christmas Dinner.  Followed directions to the letter, and it came out brilliant.  Crust was not as tasty as some prime rib recipes, but the meat was so tender and juicy.  High temp and flour created a seared crust that retained moisture and flavor.  The six pound roast took longer than the estimated cooking time, but in the end, it was well worth it.  Roast ends were well, while center was hot and pink.  Relative fought to take home two leftover pieces.  I'll take that kind of compliment any day.

This was great. I had a 6 lb boneless roast. I cheated, and used a "prime rib roast seasoning" from a jar and added that to my flour. I roasted it for about 15 minutes per pound and let it set for about 20 minutes. It was a teeny bit more done than we would have liked, but it was such a great cut of meat and the flavor was so good, no one cared. Will make again when I can afford it!

Excellent recipe and directions. It was my first time making prime rib and after all the research I did, I am SO thankful I went with this recipe.  Moist, easy, delicious and the perfect choice for a memorable Christmas dinner.  The son-in-laws already requested it for the next holiday dinner.

Awesome prime rib for Christmas dinner!  The roast was 8 lb with the rib on.  Used a digital thermometer and didn't open the oven door until the temp. was 120.  Let it rest for 20 min., and then......perfection.   Something for everyone's taste, med. on the outer edges and med. rare inside.  Tender and juicy!!!  Will definitely add this to "special dinner" collection.

The meat was juicy and delicious. The instructions worked perfectly. Next time I will take it out at 115 degrees as I like my meat rare. I took it out at 120 and it was perfect medium rare after resting. My roast was 9 lbs. I cooked it for 2.5 hours. Everyone loved it.

Turned out great, didn't adjust a thing!  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did turn out a little on the rare side, next time I will cook it a bit longer.  Was VERY juicy and very tender.  The crust kept in all the juices very nicely.  Will definately make again!

Maybe the negative reviewers should read the Perfect Prime Rib instructions from this web site and try again.  This is a very good recipe.  I didn't have the bones removed and tied to the roast, but relied on a  meat thermometer to reach a perfect med rare roast at 120?.  It is not hard to carve.  Although prime beef is not really necessary, I don't think select would be very good.  Choice is just fine.

I followed the recipe exactly, and turned out great! It was my first time making prime rib roast, and after doing some research on the web, chose this recipe without having to make any modifications. I roasted a 3.5 pound rib for about 1 hour and let it sit covered for about 30 mins, It was still very pink/red inside (a little to much for me, but I like my meat medium/well) - my boyfriend loved it. My piece of meat was a little too fatty for my liking, but I'm sure it made the meat taste that much better, but that has nothing to do with the recipe... I'll make it again for sure!! Thanks for the recipe and tips!!

I made this recipe for X-mas dinner and it was EXCELLENT...however I did have to drop temp to 425 when the drippings started to smoke. By then I did have a nice crust. I had water pipes bust 2 days earlier and was snowed in and had NO eggs or other fresh fixins before X-mas dinner;I was plumb worn out trying to clean up and still make a nice but really scaled back dinner. (I was having to carry water from neighbors so it was good to just quickly season the roast, put it in the oven and cook some taters and be done in 2 hours or so. There was NO way I could have managed a turkey, dressing, etc with the disaster..but this worked on real short notice and looked lavish, though real simple.

I used this method but changed the flour mixture on a boneless 5.5 pound prime rib.  The roast was moist and tender and the middle of it was still red and medium rare.   My husband loved it just that way.   I cooked my portion a little longer and it was just right.  I will do this again, with some perfecting.    I used 1/4 cup of regular flour, 1 1/4  teaspoon of Herbs de Provence herb mix,  1 1/2  teaspoon of sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper.    The roast cooked 90 minutes to reach medium rare on the meat thermometer.   It rested under foil for about 45 minutes before we sliced it.   Take care when inserting the meat thermometer.    This cut is very marbled.   One reading shot the temperature reading up to 140, so the thermometer may have been in a fatty area.

I followed your recipe exactly cooking it to a temperature of 120 degrees on a meat thermometer. I let it rest for 45 minutes before carving. Unfortunately the roast was more medium-well than medium-rare. I think the problem was cooking it at 425 for the entire time. Next year I think I’ll brown it at 425 or 450 for 30 minutes and then reduce the heat to 350 for a more gentle roasting.

I did exactly as instructed, checked the temperature on my meat at 4 hours in (still needing another hour and a half according to the 20 minutes per lb as advised) and you cannot imagine my despair as my roast is 159 degrees ... I just ruined a $100 piece of meat with 20 people coming for dinner ... there isn't a word to describe how upset I am.  The coating and seasoning looked fine, adding the flour did add a nice crust, but if you use this recipe, do NOT leave it in the oven for as long as it claims and check the temp every 20-30 minutes because I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else.

I had a 5-lb boneless prime rib roast and followed the recipe exactly.  It took 1-hr to reach 120F.  The outside of the roast looked a pale white when I pulled it out. Not the dark brown crusted fat I normally get. And 120F is NOT medium-rare. It's RARE!. The thing is still walking around at that temperature. The flavor was on the bland side. I won't be using this recipe again. There is just nothing to commend it.

I, too, was skeptical of keeping this at 425 degrees until the desired interior temp was reached (I've always done the 450-then-reduce-to-350 technique).  My roast was much smaller, about 4 lbs. I used a temp probe and it took about an hour.  I also coated it with the seasoned flour--excellent crust.  I lined the pan with foil and didn't expect much juices, per other reviews.  But there was some, and some fond.  So after removing the roast, I added some water to the pan, heated, and gently loosened the fond with a wooden spoon, then discarded the foil.  I added a little more water and saved it for gravy another day.

So good, very easy and less guesswork than the traditional high heat then low heat method, especially if your dealing with getting ready for alot of company. Flour coating seems to seal in the juices.

Ruined a $340 17lb prime rib roast!  Cook time/temp is way off!  We had a meat thermometer in, but trusted your directions and when we got back from Christmas Eve service, the roast was at 170 degrees!  425 digress at 20 minutes per pound is flat out bad advice. For years I’ve used the 500 degrees for XXX minutes then shut the heat off, wait 2 hours method. This year I tried something different and ruined dinner.   We have a Thermador double oven and I keep a separate thermometer in there as well. I followed your instructions. So irritating!!! Thanks for the beef jerky.

This is the first prime rib roast I've done that turned out great! i followed the directions as stated, allowing for a smaller roast (3lbs) and man, it came out jist right. i never realized coating it would make such a difference. i wanted to take a picture, but everyone was so hungry we forgot lol. Next time (and there will be a next time!).

First of all, for those folks that have a 14 lb. rib roast, ya'll are in a different tax bracket than me. Ha!!  Mine are 1/2 the size, so I half the recipe, and I am telling you, this recipe is OFF the chain.   INCREDIBLE !  Delicious, moist, flavorful. I baked it a little longer, as I don't like mine too pink.  PERFECT.  This recipe is now my go-to for prime rib roast. Why mess with perfection?

I've used this recipe for my last three Easter dinners and can't wait to use it again! The size has changed from year to year and sometimes the seasonings do as well but I've always followed the cooking instructions to a tee. My family loves this prime rib and I love making it for them. I'm sure there are others who have different opinions on how to 'properly' prepare a prime rib to which I say, 'Bravo! Post a recipe like this user did and I'm happy to try that one, too. Just maybe maybe not for Easter!'

Made exactly as recipe described. It was absolutely delicious!!!! It was difficult for me to correctly estimate time as I only had 2.5 roast and new meat thermometer. Regardless, I ended up with medium and medium rare roast which is exactly what I wanted. There were enough drippings to make gravy but didn’t want anything this time. Will always do prime rib or any other “good” cut of roast this way. Highly recommend!

Since I have made this for Christmas two years ago, I have been tapped to make it this year, and likely next. While I only did a 4-1/2 to 5 lb rib, it served perfectly BOTH times. Simple recipe with seasonings and everything (other than the rib) already on hand. I like my steaks and prime rib simple. Less is better to me. A work colleague was making prime rib for her husbands birthday for the first time this week, and I suggested this recipe. She made it and said it turned out perfect, although they did use their favorite mesquite seasoning mix . Now her husband wants it all the time. She even bought a thermometer. How cool is that? To which, I will try mesquite flavoring next, but this is definitely a favorite here and amongst visitors. And two years ago, it was my first time making prime rib also, at 52 (Gee, it's weird saying that). Thank you Barbara!

I’ve been making prime ribs for years...usually in the smoker...but this recipe is the best I’ve ever made. I used my own seasoning combination and I was attempting med-rare...but I let it rest in foil for about 2 hours and it needed up well done. Made an au jus for it and it was delicious. This will be the go to recipe from now on.

First time making prime rib, and this recipe had good flavor. Would make again. Took out of the oven at 125 or so and it was over cooked for medium well. Temp rises a lot while it rests. Next time, I’ll take out sooner.

You ruined my dinner party! My prime rib was sooooooooo over done !! It was ineatable! You said to cook it 17 or 18 minutes per pound. I decided to cook it 16 minutes per pound and 10 minutes less than you recommended. It was still over cooked !!! Terrible!!

I got an excellent result from this recipe!  When I am cooking a rib roast indoor from now on, instead of twisting one up on a spit over a wood/charcoal fire, like I prefer, I will definitely be re-using this method.   My family members like beef cooked medium to medium well.  And following the recipe fairly closely, that what we got.   I went with about 20 minutes per pound at 425 degrees (convection mode on), for a 9 lb., 3 rib roast, after having let it sit at room temp for about 5 hours.  (Probably stick with 15 min./lb. for med./med-rare.)  I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup, which was more than enough to coat this size roast.  However, I kept the original seasoning amounts the same as written and further added a  heaping tablespoon of my favorite beef rub blend to the flour.  For ease of carving  when cooked, I cut the meat almost entirely off the bones and then tied the meat and ribs back together (before coating with flour).  As stated in other reviews, pretty much only fat renders off of the meat, and it does smoke mightily, so I highly recommend lining the roasting pan with foil.  Using an instant read thermometer, I pulled the roast at 140 degrees internal temp and let it rest on its serving platter lightly draped in foil for a half hour before cutting.  The meat remained juicy inside and the rendered fat made a great roux for gravy.  All were impressed with the result.

I have made SEVERAL Rib Roasts this is the one that I really liked. It came out of the oven looking like it was coming out of the kitchen at my favorite place to go out to eat it. I took it out of the oven when the internal temp reached 120, I tented it and sat my thermometer to go off when the temp reached 140, it took about 30 minutes or so. I will never understand why people rate these recipes without trying them first. There is no other way to make one as far as I'm concerned.

ive been making it for years. 18 to 20 lbs every time. as to the conflicting reviews : I cook 425 one hour then 325 for 1.5 to 2 hours. mine is rare. i set it on a rack in the pan. I hit 120 and remove it. If i missed it i leave it uncovered longer before i foil it.  It is pink from end to end. but i pack it well with the mix. In years past less mix on the ends gave me a variety if wellness. i never noticed the smoke some experience because i cook it in my garage. NOT ALL STOVES COOK THE SAME this is not a Ron Popiel set it and forget it recipe ! YOU NEED A MEAT THERMOMETER! I agree with others if you havent tried it yet your two cents isnt needed. this works for me very well ! thank you -jb

Over done roast! 17 lbs. I brought roast to room temp. Cooked at 425, 15 minute per lb which would have been 4 h and 23 mins. Meat is well, way over done. Very disappointed and I read the reviews to bring to room temp and cook for 15 mins per lb.

I wouldn't use this technique again with my standard oven. I confirmed that the oven was indeed 500 degrees when I popped in the prime rib. So after the initial 35 minutes baking, and then two hours sitting in the oven (never opening it at all), the oven was barely warm and the meat was only warm; the center was just 115 degrees. A bit too rare for us. Perhaps with a higher quality oven that is better insulated or something, this technique would work great, but now we're stuck with an underdone roast and a cold oven.

On his first bite, my son said "Oh wow!".  Excellent roast.  I only let it sit out of the fridge for an hour, so it took longer for the roast to cook - 2 hours for 5 lb roast.  Took it out at 120 degrees.  Let stand 45 minutes and it was exactly 140 when carved.  If you want more pink, take it out before 120.

Followed recipe exactly and it came out completely overcooked.  I was skeptical about the time suggested and even with cutting it 30 minutes short it was well well well done!

What a great recipe! I ended up with the perfect prime rib ever. I roast a prime rib every Christmas but I'm not usually satisfied with the final taste when slow roasted. This has fabulous flavor and was cooked perfectly. I made some very minor changes in the procedure. I had a 10lb roast and the night before I covered the whole roast with sea salt and left it uncovered in the fridge over night. I took it out of the fridge 2 hours before cooking in an attempt to bring it to room temp. I roasted it using the 15 min/lb method. It was cooked to 120 degrees Fahrenheit in just two hours. So watch your roast carefully after an hour and a half (though my oven may run hot, I don't know). 
Meet was moist and perfect. I highly recommend this method.

Just made this for Christmas dinner, followed recipe exactly, put it in a preheated oven at 425 and pulled it out an hour and a half later when meat thermometer hit 110, foil wrapped then wrapped with beach towels until company showed up an hour later, My roast was reading 128. This is the best prime rib roast I have ever made,my guest complemented how juicy it was, the flour crust did exactly what other people have said, it sealed the juices in . Whom ever said 425 was too hot, or it burnt the roast, they probably did not keep an eye on it. My  compliments to whom ever posted this recipe. I will always use this recipe, Thank you!

The best prime rib. I was nervous keeping the temperature as high as suggested, but I did. I used a tent of aluminium foil to keep roast from being to dry.  My roast was half the size of recipe, so I cut time in half. It turned out perfect!!  This is a keeper.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU....not only to the lady who posted this recipe but to all of you who did reviews.  I followed this recipe and never have I ever made a more perfect prime rib. My husband and guests could not stop complimenting me on how perfectly cooked and juicy it was. I had a 4.5 pound prime rib, and roasted it for 1 hour in a convection oven at 425. It was perfectly  rare to medium rare which we love. The best part for me though, was pulling it out of the oven and hearing this amazing sizzling sound. It was absolutely amazing hearing all the juices sizzle in the prime rib and not one drop of juice was in the pan.  Thank you everyone!!!!

Never cooked a rib roast before. Followed the recipe to a tee, according to recipe, my roast should be medium rare at 120 degrees at 425 degrees for 4 hours and 7 minutes. I cooked for 4 hours and more like 195 degrees and charred. Whoever made this recipe must have been on crack. Avoid like the plague. If it wasn't for turkey, Thanksgiving would have been ruined...thanks a lot..

4lb roast cooked to perfection with this recipe tonight. Removed from oven after 50mins when internal temp 125. temp reached 140 during 40 min resting period. The ribroast was perfect. The ends were medium and the bulk medium rare. Tender as hell and so flavorful. I cannot thank the creator of this recipe enough. You took something often intimidating to home cooks and made it easy, making us all look good.

I'm from a cattle ranch, so would like to think I know beef. This was excellent. The only thing I would change is to leave out the table salt. The other spices offer plenty of salt. It was tender, perfectly rare inside with a good crust outside.

I have been cooking for over 40 years but Prime Rib intimidated me.  Since it's my husband's favorite I decided to try it.  So glad I found this recipe!  I followed it exactly and it was a big hit with everyone.  My husband was still raving about it the next morning.

My oven temperature is properly calibrated, so it held 425 degree temp.  My roast was 15.75 lbs.   I let it stand for 3 hours out of the fridge.  I used exact ingredients for crust.  It was on center rack in my oven.  Roast should have taken 4.5 hours at  17 min./lb.  II was skeptical about cooking at a high temp for the duration of cooking time.  I wanted medium-rare.  Checked it at 4 hours.  The crust was burned and the meat temp was 160 degrees!  I hurriedly removed from oven, and let it stand for 30 min.  Entire roast was Well Done.  If I use this recipe again, I will reduced temp. after initial cooking at 425 degrees.

I’ve made this several times generally around a 8-9 pounds and it comes out very good I’ve read several reviews and some old school HOME cooks still cook in the 70s for example: never cook above 350 or only cook at 200-225 this is old teaching. As a professional Chef in the restaurant we use high temps. We brine with herbs and seasoning first 24 hours then put a Dijon mustard and well seasoned floor over the roast. This insures a great roast extremely moist even when well done.

All I can say it Wow! I used this recipe on a 7lb. Prime Rib. I followed the recipe exactly. There was about 1/2 cup of the seasoning mixture left over which I used to mix with the drippings later for gravy. Giving this the name, "Restaurant Prime Rib" is spot on, as it has that wonderful, flavor on this outside and a bit of a coating that is just delicious. The end cut was flavorful and done, and as I sliced through towards the center each piece became more towards the medium to rare. There was literally the perfect doneness for every person at my table. I received rave reviews on my dinner which I served with baked potatoes and cauliflower. I won't make it any other way again; Thank you!

I had a much smaller roast and it turned out great but too much flour, the seasoning was great, but it was dry so I added liquid beef stock. My oven is crappy so I started at 450 for 20 minutes then turned down to 350 and that worked fine.  It should be added not to leave extra mix in the pan. All said and done I will alter this next time with broth in the pan at the beginning and  add carrots, celery and onions for the gravy.

5 lb boneless roast.  Used proportionally less seasoning (1/4 c flour....and 2 Tbsp Tastefully Simple Ultimate Steak Seasoning).  I set timer for 1hr 15min (15 min per pound).  The timing was perfect, temp read 120 degrees!  I covered it with foil and laid a towel over the top for the resting period.  It was fabulous.

I followed the recipe as instructed (425 degrees for 1hour and 25 minutes for a 4.8 lb. roast) and it produce the best prime rib I've ever made at home.  Very juicy and had a nice crust.  It rivals some very good prime rib I've had at some excellent restaurants...... Thank you for sharing!!!!

Not a fan of the flour in the rub. It clumped in the pan and burnt over the cooking time. Don't need it!

Prepared and cooked my 6lb boneless prime rib, just as the recipe says and it came out perfect! I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours(15 min per pound) Don't alter the temperature, 425 worked great!

I made a boneless prime rib roast that weighed 5.10 pounds, and I followed the directions exactly.  It was my first prime rib ever, and it turned out very good.  I roasted it for 20 minutes a pound, but in the last 30 minutes I started to check the temperature every 10 minutes (I was scared it would overcook).  I took it out at 123 degrees, tented it for 20 minutes, and it went up to 143 degrees.  My tips:  I really rubbed in the flour mixture, so that there wasn't any loose flour lying on the roast to burn in the high heat.  I did have some smoking at the end as the fat rendered off into the pan, but I expected it and had my vent fan on high.  I also baked it on the rack between my center and lower racks, so that the roast was not too close to any of the heating elements.  The outer crust was perfectly brown and the inner meat just to our liking (between medium rare and medium).  There is obviously more than one way to make a good prime rib, but this one worked great for me.

Followed the directions to a T with a 5.5 pound roast.   Extremely  disappointed.   Roast was dry, not medium rare except in isolated areas and way too much “grey” around the edges.  Won’t make this again using this recipe.

This recipe is fantastic and has never let me down - follow it to the T! I shared it with my grandmother and she hasn’t made it any other way since! To all the haters talking about temps and searing - it’s strange because mine always comes out crispy on the outside and tender, pink and juicy on the inside..  I always cook it on a rack at 15 minutes/lb.. Don’t forget the horseradish cream! Thanks for sharing!

I have  made used this recipe several times and it has always turned out excellent.   Sometimes I will use fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic powder which gives it a slightly more garlicky taste.

I'm not rating the recipe. I'm rating the cooking method. I had a 2.5 lb. roast so I cooked it at 425 for 45 min. It was completely raw. Put back in oven for another 15 and it registered at 120 so I took it out and let sit for 30 min. Still raw. Microwaved for 2 min. and let sit another 15. It was edible but still on the rare side.

I love to try new takes and this one didn't make the cut. The temperature rose too quickly and the roast became overdone and dry. I'll go back to the tried and true method. I used a meat thermometer and walked away for 20 minutes. It went from 110 to 150.

It worked out great.  I followed the instructions as they were written.  Only thing was that the house did get smokey.  Believe adding some water to the pan would help with this issue.  Will be trying this recipe again soon.

This was excellent, but I did run into a little problem. I tried to follow the directions, but found that the hot oven was burning the drippings. I slid a cookie sheet under the pan to try to reduce the direct heat, but eventually had to turn the temperature down to 390, and just barely saved the drippings from turning black. The burning splattering also created some smoke, fortunately we had no guests! Loved the effect of the flour and the heat. Lots of yummy crispy trimmings!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out absolutely perfect and delicious.  We cooked a 5 1/4 pound roast with the ribs cut off but tied on, and paid very close attention to the temperature, as instructed. This will be my go-to recipe for prime rib from now on!

This was by far the best prime rib we have ever made.  My entire family loved it.  It was perfect, moist and so much flavor.  I did top it with a couple dabs of unsalted butter.....but that was my only change.  Will use this every time now!

I used the rub but lowered the temperature to 300 and then again to 300 after searing at the 500 to 475 temp.
I had a 19 lb Rib roast and it was cooking way too fast.
Other than the temperature I didn't change anything and got 
rave reviews from all 8 at the table. Great recipe

The crust was excellent, but will take out before it reaches 120 degrees internally.  Mine was a 10 pound roast, and everyone loves it.

I made a 9lb roast for my wife and friends, it came out perfect. The only difference I did was I basted the roast in cannabis infused butter. It made for quite the dinner. highly recommended !!

Was scared about the the high oven temp but just went for it and glad I did, roast turned out perfectly.  Next time I might try a dry rub the night before then flour for some extra flavor.

This was my 1st time making prime rib and it couldn't have turned out any better than it did.  I searched and searched for a recipe to use and happened upon this one. I read all the reviews  and b/c the majority of the negative reviews (from my understanding) were from people who hadn't actually made/used this recipe. They were more along the lines of disagreeing with the oven temp or how many mins per pound, etc. With that being said, I followed this recipe to a T. The prime rib turned out spectacular. 
Barbara, thank you so much for this recipe and all your helpful ideas. You made my 1st prime rib roast and my family's Christmas dinner a huge success!

I found this recipe last year when trying to decide what to make for our Christmas dinner.  I made this for the first time last year with a 5 lb rib roast and thought I got lucky because it came out perfectly.  I followed the recipe again this year with a bigger roast and again it came out delicious!!! :)  Great recipe

Very good; a meat thermometer is essential because ovens sometimes vary ; 
I agree with some of the other reviewers, cut the temp down and watch closely.

Followed the recipe but cooked it for 15 minutes per pound. 6.6 lb = 1hr39mins, tented it for 30 mins and it was perfect! 
Everyone had a piece just the way they liked it, from medium rare to medium well.  I will definitely use this recipe again and would recommend it to everyone.

I made this for my family's "November Birthday" dinner and they all loved it, even the 2 1/2 year old twins! The only complaint was from my husband who couldn't find a knife sharp enough to cut through the outer coating.

I made a 14 lb roast for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about how it was the best prime rib they ever had. The only precaution is the use of a meat thermometer as the roast was done to medium rare before the recipe time. I covered it and let it rest as the instructions said and it turned out perfect. There are 2 slices on each end that are cooked more for those who don't like pink.

I cooked this for Thanksgiving this year and it was more than wonderful!!! I had a 6# prime rib so made adjustments to the "rub" and cooking time accordingly. Everyone loved it. There was only 4 of us to eat it but there was very little left-over. Will definitely make again! Thank you for the recipe!

Followed the recipe and it was phenomenal! Better than Longhorn's because it was the quarter of the price and the crunchy seasoning was outstanding!

I used the already seasoned prime rib from Costco and added the flour, cooked at 425 til 130 degrees internal temp, came out perfect, no juices in pan, just the rendered fat. Will definitely use this method again, new family favorite!

I was very nervous making this recipe because it was my first time making prime rib. I had an expensive cut but it was only 4.14 pounds. It seemed like the outside was browning very quickly but I stuck true to medium - 20 min per pound for a total of 1 hr 20 min at 425 and let it sit for 30 min afterwards. I used a rack to cook it and it came out perfect! I didn't have celery powder or onion powder so I used a small onion. But that was the only difference. I feel confident to make prime rib in the future with this recipe.

This was my first time cooking a rib roast and I wish I could make it all the time. It was so good. However, I will say that I had a 3 bone rib roast, which was more than enough 10 adults considering I had a small ham and other sides, and I only followed the recipe for the flour mixture only.  To cook the rib roast I did Alton Brown's method of a reverse sear. I cooked it low in the beginning and once the internal temperature was about 125 to 127 I took it out and let it rest while I made 2 side dishes (each took about 20 minutes ) and cooked the ham. Then right when the ham came out the oven, I upped the oven to 450 and cooked the rib roast for about 15 minutes to get a great crust. Took it out and it was ready to serve! No need to let it rest again.  The flour mixture was just the right amount of flavor to accent my prime rib!

My 4 pound, 2 bone prime rib roast turned out great.  I roasted at 425 degrees for the first 30 minutes then reduced the oven temp to 325 for the remainder of cooking time.  Used an in oven thermometer and cooked to medium well.

I used this recipe for a 5 pound prime rib roast with 2 bones. I used the amounts of flour and seasonings listed here so I would have a nice thick crust and cooked it for 15 minutes per pound in a 425 degree oven and let it sit for about 45 minutes after cooking. It turned out perfectly medium rare!  I did line the pan with foil then placed the roast on a veggie steamer since I had no other rack to keep it off the bottom of the pan. Yes I was very creative at using the little fold up kind of steamer but it worked great.  But truly this recipe and instructions are spot on. This was my first attempt at cooking this kind of roast but it was so easy and yummy! I will use it again.

Made this for a fire department Christmas party and it was a hit. Very simplistic, but tasty.  The roast we prepared was 14 pounds and there were no leftovers. We are using this recipe for New Year's Day too.

425 is way too hot, I should have listened to the ones saying that, but there were several saying it worked right at 425...my mistake, I used a 14.3 pound Prime rib, did it right per instructions and then at 3 hours stuck a thermometer in to check it out, figuring that if the others were correct and it was too hot, I thought I'd be ok at three hours to check it...nope at 160 and the end edges were charcoal.

This was fantastic! I made a four pounder, following the comments to really press that seasoned flour in and it made a fantastic crust. Also followed the 425F for 15 min a pound and let it rest for nearly 40 min because I lost track of time. The meat was juicy, tender, and made for a delicious meal along with some horseradish sauce and a bunch of vegetables. 

Can't wait to make this again! Thank you for making this easy!

Followed to a T,  both the recipe and the cook method. Flavor wise, there really wasn't any. The meat, b/c of the high quality did stand on its own, however, the spice s here really added little to nothing to enhance it. As for the cook method, I will not do it again. It worked yes, using a digital thermometer, it did take a bit longer then the 20 minutes per lb for my 4.5 lb roast to come to 130 but it caused a huge amount of smoke.  I will try the flour coating, but use my own seasoning and a low and slow cooking method next time.

I would not recommend this recipe. The flour rub made the crust taste like flour vs spices and herbs.

I followed this recipe exactly and got raves for my Christmas dinner.  I had a 7.5 pound roast. Took it out of the oven at 120 degrees and let it sit 20 minutes. Perfect medium rare.

We found that this recipe causes the recipe to be cooked much faster than it suggests.    Many recipes turn down the heat after an initial time period, this one doesn't suggest that, but the meat came to temperature an hour less than expected at 425!

This recipe is perfect as is. I made only 4 lbs of ribs and I will have plenty of leftovers for a few days.....I think I will make it again. The meat came out juicy and with a nice crust.

I followed the recipe and it turned out spectacular! The only problem I had was I didn't get the roast to room temperature before I put it into the oven so it took a little bit longer Coating the roast with flour really does help to keep the roast juicy.
Thank you for the recipe.

I never comment on recipes but last year, I found this one and made it exactly as instructed.  It came out amazing!  I can still taste the goodness so I'm doing another for this Christmas.  I know there was a debate but I say do it exactly as it says!  Thanks for the addition to my collection!

I only had a boneless 2lb roast, so I think that threw the timing off a little, but this was the juiciest pork roast ever. I've never had it in a restaurant, so I can't compare it to that, but I can say it's better than any pork roast my mother or mother-in-law has ever made. I didn't have celery seed, but other than that I followed the recipe precisely, including the temp. I'm not sure why some people have such strong feelings about what temperature to cook a roast, but 425 for 30 minutes for my 2lb roast was perfect, and it was SUPER juicy and tender.

We tried this with a smaller portion of meat, didn't bring it to room temperature, and didn't do anything with the ribs before cooking ... but it was still delicious!

This was I think the third or fourth attempt that I have made at making a rib roast.  I let my roast sit out about 7 hours before cooking it because it was a 5 rib, about 13.4 lbs roast.  The temperature when I put it in the oven was a out 53 degrees.  I preheated the oven to 425 and planned on the 15 minute per pound.  I used a meat thermometer that I could view from outside the oven and removed it when it reached 120 degrees.  Now the difference I experienced here was that I actually had to take it out of the oven over an hour earlier than my planned time.  And the shallow pan I used was full of juice.   I do not know if I did not make the flour coating thick enough but it did not hold all the juice inside.  So, I had to spoon out the juice before I could pick up the pan.  I then covered the roast in the pan with a couple layers of foil and let it set for about an hour and 15 minutes.  I would have carved it sooner but since it finished so quick we did not have the rest of the food ready.  I was not too thrilled with the flour coating.  With all that said,  even though I had a few road bumps.  This was BY FAR THE BEST STANDING RIB ROAST I HAVE EVER MADE.  Everyone was very happy including myself.  I will experiment with a different coating for next time.  Probably a homemade flavored butter.  But I highly recommend to anyone that is cooking a rib roast, get a meat thermometer.  You cannot go wrong if you have one and pay attention to it.

This recipe is great! I followed the instructions and happy with the results. My boyfriend was in meat heaven.  I bought a 4.5 lb roast coated the meat with the flour seasoned with the spices and cooked the meat at 425 degrees for 1 hour and 30 minutes and allowed the roast to sit for about 45 minutes before serving.  Medium rare was the results.

Only thing I changed were some of the spices in the flour (I used horseradish, sea salt, paprika, and rosemary). It was awesome!!!! Mine was 4.5 lbs and I took it out once it got to 138 degrees (it took about an hour or so)  and covered it for 20 min. It was still warm and the perfect med-rare. The outside coating was delish!! I served it with horseradish sauce. I used aluminum on the bottom of my roasting pan and had no issues with smoke as others have said.  Will be trying this with leg of lamb on Easter!!

I made this with a 5 pound roast and it turned out amazing!!  I let it sit wrapped up in foil for and hour like the recipe said and it was still nice and warm when it was served.  Great recipe! I would do this again for sure!
