This is really good!  I used Bosc Pears and left the skins on and it looked so pretty pureed with little flecks of warm earthy brown pieces in the butter.  I found that the citrus was a little too intense , so I will leave out at least 1/2 the amount of the zest next time.  I have never made this before, so I am not sure how thick this should be. Is it supposed to be spreadable?  Mine came out a little like pudding in consistency.  Im very happy with it and I recommend this recipe and will make it again.  THX.

This is the first time I've ever attempted to make pear butter and I don't think it turned out how it's supposed to. It's like apple sauce consistency. The gelatin would not dissolve! Any tips for getting the gelatin to dissolve? Also can somebody tell me if I am supposed to boil the jars after I pour the butter in and seal them or how long does this stuff keep in the fridge? I gave it 3 stars because while it does taste good, it's just not a good consistency, but I'm not sure if it's the recipe or my lack of experience. Any input on how I can make it better next time would be greatly appreciated!
