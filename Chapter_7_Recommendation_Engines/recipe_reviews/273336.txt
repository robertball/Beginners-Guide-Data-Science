This was delicious (with my changes); I omitted the green peppers because I don't like them; I changed the chicken to hamburger meat (browning with the onions then draining); I used the 19 oz. can of red enchilada sauce; I cooked at 350 for 35 minutes. Longer cook time allowed the zucchini to be a little more tender (oh and spooning out the zucchini was a bear!). If you make it as the recipe calls for I think you will still like this dish.

Have made this several times we love it! I use the entire 8oz block of cream cheese and medium enchilada sauce. Delicious!
