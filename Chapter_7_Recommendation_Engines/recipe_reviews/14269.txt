I wasn't sure what I was suppose to do with the butter and graham cracker crumbs. Do I use them as I would use grease and flour for a cake pan or use it like melted butter and graham crumbs in a crust like cheesecake. I ended up just not using that part and mixed up jello and pineapple juice mixture in a bowl and it was a hit at my sons first birthday party.

I've never made a geletin salad in my life.  :)  I've made jello, but never been creative about it.  Considering this was the first one I've ever tried, (pressured into it for Thanksgiving) I consider this recipe to be tops.  It looks difficult, but even my 6 year old had fun with it.  Thanks!

I don't even like jello very much, but this stuff is good! I helped my 13 y.o. make this, and it looked like we had a science project going on! A couple of tips, if you have a springform pan, use it! Mine has a tube pan insert so it was perfect. Makes it effortless to unmold this. I noticed several reviews where people were wondering what to do with the butter and crumbs. Just butter the bottom of the pan and scatter the crumbs in, shake around and dump out the excess. Vanilla wafers worked great for us. Make sure the pineapple is in syrup, not juice, the thickness and sweetness is important. Also, I think using real whipping cream is a must, forget the coolwhip...too thick and artificial tasting. This makes such a pretty dessert, perfect for summer cook-outs!

My family enjoyed eating this.  I was a little disappointed in how it looked.  i read that it was beautiful, but mine didn't turn out that way.  After they tasted it, everyone loved it and wanted more.

I added this to my Christmas dinner buffet table and it looked great and tasted fabulous!! (I opted to omit the graham crackers) I doubled the recipe and put it in a bunt pan. Easy to make the day before!!

This was GREAT!  I made it for my daughter's birthday party and everyone loved it and there wasn't any left by the end of the party; that RARELY happens with jello.  I omitted the graham cracker topping, I thought it would ruin the look.  I actually don't have a gelatin mold; I used a bundt cake pan and it worked out perfectly.  This is a PERFECT gelatin salad for those of us who don't like fruit floating in our jello!

My step-kids wouldn't even eat this.  Was a lot of hassle to make something that was pretty, but not really edible.  It nearly all went to waste.

I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED AS RECIPE CALLS FOR LARGE BOX OF JELLO AND I USED SMALL WITH THE AMOUNT OF WATER CALLED FOR AND IT CAME OUT FINE.  I LATER FOUND ANOTHER RECIPE 'BROKEN WINDOW GLASS' WHICH IS ALMOST A DUPLICATE RECIPE - ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHICH SIZE BOX OF JELLO TO USE.  THAT IS REASON I ONLY GAVE A 4 RATING.

This is a super yummy recipe.  I remember my grandma used to serve this at the holidays.  When I was young, I wasn't so sure about the way it looked, but once you try it you'll be hooked.  She used to serve it in a clear baking dish with a thicker graham cracker crust bottom, like a cheesecake.  SOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!  We called it broken glass jello.

This didn't work for me at all.  It only fills an angel food pan half way so it just fell out in a blob.  I'd suggest using a much smaller pan or bowl.  Even though I couldn't serve it, we tasted it and didn't like it that much.  Sorry.

Linda was right.  This is an "Oh and Ah" dessert.  My husband and I both think it is beautiful.  Perfect for Christmas, but also a nice light flavor thats perfect for summertime too!  I am going to be impressing company with this wonderful recipe.  Thank You Linda!

I didn't understand if I was supposed to pour each gelatin mold on top of the other ones in the same dish...??  I did and it turned out ok.  I also didn't use the graham cracker crumbs.  Just mixed up the gelatin with Cool Whip.  The kids loved it.

Excellent!  I made for an April Fool's birthday party and served along with homemade pound cake. Everyone enjoyed this tasty recipe which   made a beautiful presentation.  I followed the  recipe exactly with the exception of adding heavy peach syrup instead of pineapple (didn't have any on hand).  I buttered and then coated  a springform pan (with removable tube) with graham crackers.  I really do not see the need for this step as when it is removed the graham cracker crumbs are almost invisible.  This is a keeper and one I will make again and again!!

Delicious and pretty.  I would try doubling the recipe next time, though.  When unmolding, it didn't sit that evenly on the platter.

This is not the recipe.  You must use 6 oz boxes of jello and follow the instructions.  This recipe using 3 oz boxes would be terrible. I have made this for many years and you must use 6'ers.  Good luck!

Very tasty and light dessert.  I totally omitted the whole graham cracker part; it didn't even appeal to me.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 since it was just for my husband and myself, and put it in an 8x8" pyrex dish.  I cut it into 9 squares, and it turned out perfectly!

As is, not that great - hence the three stars. Also I don't understand the need for the graham cracker crumbs. I made this as stated once many, many years ago. Since then I skip straight to the lemon/pineapple/whipped cream mixture, add chopped bits of pineapple and pour into the mold sans the 'chunks of glass' (and the graham crackers crumbs). Delicious!!

Very tasty and pretty. I did not mold mine but served it out of a glass bowl. Wasn't sure how thick the lemon and pineapple syrup needed to get I put it to thicken in the fridge till it stated to set. seemed ok at that point.

Sorry, I really wanted this to work but it didn't.   Taste was super but mine collapsed.  I wonder if it's the Florida humidity.  Too much work for the presentation as I've got other gelatin type recipes that have worked better for me.
