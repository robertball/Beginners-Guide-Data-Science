Excellent recipe, however it needs just a little more zip.  Don't forget to add half a minced red onion (or more to taste).  That really complements the tomato flavor.  Salt needs to be about half a teaspoon and a hint of freshly ground black pepper.  Also, if you're in a hurry or out of fresh tomatoes, the canned tomatoes actually substitute quite well.  You can buy whole canned and chop them yourself or buy them already diced.  Just make sure you buy the "no salt added" kind or you'll have to adjust the salt in the recipe.  Oh, and I think 1/4 cup of olive oil was fine since I am not too fond of oily textures.  I would just add an extra tomato or two to have enough sauce.  FABULOUS fresh recipe and I like to also use it as a dip on occasion...sort of an Italian salsa.

Simple, homey and delicious classic Italian dish. Something you can put together in minutes and turn out something sensational! I never bother with the marinating part - it's just as good skipping that step. This time, however, I took it a step further and added shrimp, cooked scampi style with a little white wine, lemon juice, fresh parsley and more garlic!

This recipe was perfect for the fresh tomatoes I picked out of my garden. I didn't have time to let the sauce 'sit' and it still tasted great. I did slightly alter the recipe. I used penne for my pasta, reduced the the garlic to 1 clove and added 1/2 lb boiled shrimp to the finished product -- which helped to make it a bit more hearty for my family.

So good! Very simple fresh ingredients produce a great dish.  I used 1/4 c. of olive oil and cherry tomatoes cut in half.  I also used more garlic, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes along with the fresh basil.  I put it in tupperware so I could toss it a few times over the course of a few hours.  It went great over angel hair pasta.

unbelievably simple, elegant, and tasty!  proportions were perfect....should let sauce sit for at least 4-6 hours to macerate and blend flavors.  I will make this again and again during the height of the tomato season.  this recipe does not tolerate substitutions....it wouldn't be the same with canned tomatoes or dried basil.

This is addictive!  I let the mixture sit on my counter the full 10 hours.  The hot pasta (I used mini penne) mellows the garlic just enough.  Very refreshing, and super simple to make (and eat!!).  Also good reheated.

I was amazed at how good this was.  Just a few simple ingredients provided a wonderfully light yet tasty dish.  I'll definitely make this again!

I left off the pasta and used this recipe for Foccacia Bread.  If you 've ever had California Pizza Kitchen Foccacia Bread Appetizer, this tastes just like the alla checca they use.

absolutely delicious!
i made this for my hubby and his little brother.  my brother in law was in charge of the maindish & i got to do the side dish.  i've made this recipe twice now, both times with bow-tie noodles.  this recipe is in PERMANENT rotation.  i love the simplicity of the recipe & complexity of flavor.  really good recipe when you are cooking for hard to impress people!!  only advice from me is to definetly plan ahead and let marinate at least 4 hours for maximum impact.  i grated the parmesan myself, a pain, but worth it.

Great recipe!. I would not use this much olive oil-it was a bit oily for our taste- maybe cut the oil in half- a little goes a long way. Otherwise loved it- will make again

According to the USDA, all raw fruits and veggies that have been cut or peeled should be refrigerated within two hours to prevent possible food-borne illnesses. Yes, tomatoes are higher in acids than other foods, but they CAN become infected with bacteria.   The best-practice for safe food handling of cut tomatoes is to refrigerate within two hours and within one hour if room temperature is 90 degrees F or higher. Since 76,000,000 people (76 million- this is not a typo) get sick with food-borne illness each year in the USA and 5,000 of those people die it is a good idea to be safe instead of taking chances.   As few as 10 bacteria can make you sick, and bacteria can double every 20 minutes at room temperature.  10 accidental bacteria sitting in your tomatoes and olive oil now can become over 5,000 bacteria in 3 hours and over 40,000 in 4 hours.  Please be safe with food. Want to check my facts?  Need more information? Go To: http://lancaster.unl.edu/food/mypyramid-food-safety_files/frame.htm

Classic example of simple, fresh, unassuming ingredients when brought together make the very best of meals.  Sometimes simple is best after all.  Thank you Star Pooley.

Very tasty, looked pretty and doesn't heat up the kitchen on a hot summer night.  Only complaint was that if you toss "sauce" with pasta in a serving bowl, its difficult to serve.  Better to make up individual plates.  (Pasta gets VERY slippery.)

Very tasty combo!  I scaled the recipe to 2.5 servings, cut the oil to 3 TBSP, & used 2 tsp. of dry basil (it's all I had).  I put this on a homemade pizza (using Jay's signature pizza crust, found on this web site) AWESOME! The 1/2 that I have left is going to be used for the original recipe, with shrimp added!  DELISH!!  Thanks Star!

My family LOVED this recipe. When the garden is bursting with tomatoes, this is the perfect go-to recipe to use them. It's extremely easy to make and very satisfying. I highly recommend this recipe just as it is. It needs no adjustments! :)

Very good.  I made for my brother and myself, so I only used 3 tomatoes, 1/4 cup olive oil, and half a clove of garlic.  It was so good I ate his bowl too!  Only 4 stars because it tasted a little plain.  Next time, I will add more salt and basil.

Really enjoyed this.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden and added a touch of onion to the sauce.  Very light and oh, so tasty!  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks.

Oh my goodness -- pure summer magic! I will be reliving this dish in the cold winter months.  I used whole wheat penne, heirloom tomatoes and added cubed fresh mozarella when the pasta is still warm. It's the way a local restaurant serves this dish.

Very nice.  I used angel hair... which I wouldn't really recommend, as there just isn't enough sauce to cover that much surface.  Perhaps some spaghetti or penne next time.  What really made this dish amazing, though, was using it for bruschetta!  I spread a little on some bread with mushrooms and topped with parmesan... it was perfect!

Great recipe.  Tastes like bruschetta on pasta instead of bread.  Perfect the way it is although I added a few red pepper flakes.

We liked this very much! Easy to make, but not as good with canned tomatoes. I crushed some fresh and diced some as well because I wanted a chunky texture. Will make over and over I'm sure.

This is perhaps one of the best pasta sauces I have ever made! I love the taste of fresh garden tomatoes and it's always seemed just a waste to spoil their taste by cooking them.

This recipe is delicious! I used farfalle pasta so it was easily tossed all together. It's even delicious as a cold pasta the next day, with a little extra parmesan.

Thank you, this is a keeper!

This is definitely for those unafraid of a lot of garlic!  Served it over whole wheat pasta, and a little goes a long way since it does have a lot of oil.  Used grated Asiago cheese in it.

I have made this same sort of thing before, but without the 8 hours sitting on the counter.  What a difference!  I used fresh everything and high quality olive oil.  Perfect as is. Used grated parmesan from the can but could be a dish for company with shaved or shredded - prettier presentation.  Thanks!

This is very easy and tasty!  Like the other reviewer, I didn't have time to let the sauce sit for very long but it was still very good.  Each summer I try to fix pasta like this and in the past I thought it was bland.  This time I used dipping oil (tomato-basil) for the olive oil.  It enhanced the flavor much more than plain olive oil.

This was so good.  I bit of prep but well worth it.  Even my hubby who isn't a big fan of garlic liked it, so that made it even better

Absolutely delish.  Instead of raw garlic, I added chopped roasted garlic.  We use fresh linguine from the deli section at the grocery, and fresh parmesan.  On the side, I offer a sauteed zucchini, crookneck squash and onion mixture that tastes wonderful mixed in.  The kids prefer it without,which is why I serve it on the side. We also usually serve a cold protein with this: leftover grilled chicken or smoked salmon.  Yum!!

Great idea. We added about a half of a small red onion, used less than half the oil, omitted the cheese (vegan), and added a tsp or two of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar. We didn't have time to let it sit at all, but it still tasted great. Had it last night and we're making it again tonight since it was freakin tasty.

This is excellent. And about the same sauce as I use to put on crisp home made toast for a bruschetta. For a little different tang, I sometimes add a 1/2 tsp fresh rubbed taragon leaves into it.   Gives it a combo os tart/tangy/sweet flavor. My compliments to the Chef.  I usually slightly heat my sauce first, but it is really fresh and good without cooking first.   A great adaption to my personal favorite sauce and bruschetta mixture.  a little sweet vidalia onion helps for those who like it. a full 5 stars plus.

This was a great way to use up my leftover tomatoes from the end of summer. I used a multi-grain corkscrew pasta which holds sauces better, and upped the garlic and also added some onion for additional flavor. The cheese melts and gives some structure to it as well.  Very easy and very good. I think this would be a nice dish in winter too, and you can use canned whole tomatoes in place of fresh.

I liked it, but it's one of those recipes that succeed or fail depending on the quality of your ingredients.  You need the very best, freshly chopped garlic and basil, homegrown sweet tomatoes, fragrant (not rancid) extra virgin olive oil, freshly grated cheese, salt and pepper, and some al dente angel hair pasta.   If you use supermarket tomatoes and jarred garlic and dried basil, it might fail miserably.  

I think it makes a ton of delicate garlicky flavored pasta as a side dish, not for people who want a hearty bowl of spaghetti marinara as a main dish.

This was an easy recipe and great to make on an evening when you get home just in the nick of time for dinner. My one mistake was using jarred garlic instead of fresh raw to save time because unlike many of the other raters ours was lacking in garlic flavor. We will be making this again and using fresh!

Delicious!  I used roma tomatoes (about 6) and minced garlic from a jar, as well as adding some lemon pepper and garlic salt to taste.  I couldn't stay out of it last night!  Brought it to work today for lunch and I can't wait to dig in!!

This was really great.  I made it before I went to work, and dinner was waiting when I got home!  I added about a quarter of a diced purple onion, and I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used 1 tbsp. dried crushed basil and it was still delicious.  I think I'll reduce the oil next time, but still a definite keeper.  Thanks!

This was so good!  I was looking for a recipe right before dinner time so it only marinated for about an hour but it was still so tasty (and I assume it only gets better with time).  We served it over cheese tortellini and oh my!  It's going to be my go to dish this summer.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This was very tasty.  I can't wait to use fresh tomatoes out of my garden for this recipe next summer.  I served this with Garlic Chicken Fried Chicken (also on allrecipes.com) which was a nice complement.

I love this recipe. No matter if it sits for several hours or just long enough to boil pasta it is still good.  The quality of your olive oil and tomatoes matters big time.  I add sauteed chicken to make it a main dish.  Served cold, room temp or hot- all very good.

Snaps for Star! This is the perfect summer dish. I picked the basil and tomatoes out of the garden. I, too reduced the oil by half and it was wonderful. This would also be great as bruschetta on a crusty bread. Very versatile, very good!!!

Yum!  So fresh and delicious!  I reduce the olive oil pretty significantly, but that is my only change (we don't like that much oil :)).  Oh, and I didn't let the mix marinate too long (didn't have time!) but it was delicious nonetheless - next time I will let it sit and I'm sure it will be even better!

This was wonderful. I made it using the first of my tomatoes and my basil. Loved the garlic flavour. I would use a little less oil and I added fresh ground black pepper. Try shaved parmesan instead of grated. It's a little more robust to go with the other flavours.

This is very fresh and full of flavor. I use half the oil and though it tastes good immediately it gets even better after letting it marinate. It is also great for bruschetta. Love it!

A really good meatless pasta sauce that even the meat eater's will like.  I used Roma plum tomatoes but this would be great with any fresh tomato.  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves(we all love garlic) and did not make any other changes to the recipe.  We found the amount of olive oil just right.  There was a little left in the bottom of our pasta bowls to dip our bread in(Italian Herb Bread II also from this site).  Now that the fresh tomatoes are done, I will also try this recipe with canned.  This will be great on work days.  Just put it in a bowl in the morning and come home to a quick, easy, excellent supper.  Thanks so much Star.

Excellent recipe. Like many others, I served it with a nice spring mix salad and a crusty french bread.  It made an excellent light summer meal.  My husband liked it even though there wasn't any meat in the sauce.  The only thing I did different was to decrease the oil to approximately 1/4 cup.  I think it would also be good with some olives added to it also.  Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! Fresh basil and home-grown tomatoes are a must! This was a nice dish to serve on such a hot, humid midwestern evening. I paired it with a crisp salad, garlic bread and a glass of Merlot. Leftovers were even good cold the next day. I will most certainly make again!

Very good!  I increased the amount of garlic, out of habit, and for once I wished I hadn't.  It was a little too powerful.  The amount listed is probably perfect.  I absolutely loved making the sauce ahead of time, and just boiling pasta at dinner, I have a lot more energy at lunchtime than i do at 6:00! :)  Great recipe!

This was a totally awesome recipe!  I made it last night and served it tonight.  I just can't say enough about this recipe.  I served it with cheese ravioli.  DH thought there was not enough "sauce".......but this is the WAY pasta SHOULD be served!!!!  Not all GOOPED up!  Thank you for a real "keeper"!!

I use this recipe as a cold salad in the summer or with a big dinner that just needs a start.  I like to use a lot more salt than the recipe calls for, but it's best to add that after the sauce sits.  I also threw in some chopped onions and cubed mozzarella cheeese to make this a great meal in itself.

Very light...perfect for a summer dish.  While I wasn't bowled over by the flavor on a pasta dish, I think this would be great on a homemade pizza or bruschetta.

Wow - very tasty!  I loved how flavorful this dish was with so little effort.  I didn't have time to let it marinate and it was still fab - can't wait to taste it next time with I prepare it in advance!  Thank so you much!

This was pretty good.  I marinated my sauce for about six hours and served over linguine.  It is really important to use quality, fresh ingredients for this sauce to come together properly and taste good.

Fabulous pasta. I used fresh garden tomatoes and marinated for a couple of hours. I've had similar dishes and I do think the marinating time is key. Added less oil and served as a side dish for bacon wrapped cream cheese chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I used less oil like others suggested and actually think I could have gotten away with even a little less.Thank you for sharing, stuff like this helps me to realize you dont really need a recipe, if you use all fresh that naturally go together you really cannot go wrong.

Excellent! Just be careful with the garlic. If you make lots of sauce and it sits in the fridge a day or two, the garlic will get stronger. Still a very, very good recipe for fresh tomatos and basil.

I love this dish.  Great for parties, because it can be served at room temperature.  Those who call it soupy said the garlic was too strong were probably using way too much sauce for the amount of pasta they cooked.  When you mix the sauce into the pasta, it should almost look like it doesn't have any sauce on it at all.

We had purchased some tomatoes at a roadside stand, and a few miles later, we had a bad car accident where we rolled our vehicle. We were okay but our tomatoes got a little beat up and I was determined to use them anyway! This was a great recipe for using up my tomatoes and so I called this Pasta Alla Wrecka. :)

We really enjoyed this. It was very easy to make and the ingredients can be altered to taste. I made this as the recipe stated and while garlicky, it was still good.

I only had time to let the sauce sit for two hours, next time we'll try for more time. I wouldn't call this a kid friendly dish, although our 10 year old ate most of her serving. We added some grated mozzarella in addition to the parmesan.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated, except I peeled the tomatoes.  It turned out horribly.  The garlic was so strong and overpowering it totally ruined it, and my husband and I love garlic.  It was also very soupy, and the oil was way to much.  When my husband saw it sitting in the bowl, he asked if I had made salsa!  And that is exactly what it looked like.  I hated it and didn't finish mine, he was being nice and ate his, saying it "wasn't too bad" but later agreed that we should never have this again.  I still have a ton of it left and I'm trying to figure out something else to make with it.

This was great! I put some cubed mozzarella cheese on the bottom of the serving dish, added the hot pasta so it would melt a litte than I added the tomatoe mix on top and tossed it all together.  Excellent!!!

Tried this recipe last night, over pasta and did not like it at all!  Pretty bland... to be fair though, I used about a quarter cup of fresh basil and about a teaspoon of dried basil.  Another reviewer said that they used all dried basil, so I thought I'd give it a try since I didn't have much of the fresh kind.  Had a lot of it leftover... and the reason that I'm giving it three stars is that I used it today for bruschetta.  Popped it in the oven over fresh artisan bread, and topped it with mozzarella.  About 6 to 7 minutes at 350. This was great!!!

Such a delicious and romantic dish!  This really is what summer fresh tomatoes were made for!  It has such a light taste, but don't over-do the garlic or you'll overpower the tomato flavor.  Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan cheese.  I used dried basil and got a great flavor.  This sauce works well with Penne pasta.

Didn't realize how good & simple pasta was to make, more of a technique.  I've made this several times.  I didn't have fresh basil, so used homemade pesto sauce from my freezer.  This recipe has so many possibilities, like adding salad shrimp.  Thanks

What a great and easy way to utilize garden tomatoes.  I also finely minced a sweet onion into the mixture and cubed up Mozzerella cheese, adding it in with the hot pasta.  My husband could not eat enough of it.

Fantastic recipe. Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect. At first I was hesitant about the amount of olive oil but it worked out okay because it had to cover 1 lb. of pasta. Delicious!

I have made this for many years. It is also good as lunch minus the pasta and cheese, served with a crusty bread to soak up the juice. The longer it sets the better.

An idea for those looking to be even healthier.... When I make checca sauce, I sometimes toss it with spaghetti squash instead of pasta and it is fantastic! I also tend to pulse all of the ingredients in a food processor so they better blend.  This recipe calls for a lot of oil and that much isn't necessary.  You just have to add enough so that the sauce comes together.

Very tasty!  Added some finely chopped green peppers and only half the olive oil as others had suggested.  Hubby gave it a thumbs up.  Will definitely make again-especially with all these wonderful summer tomatoes!

This recipe was good. I used less olive oil than the recipe called for - I added it into the bowl after I had put in the tomatoes and other ingredients, then just sort of eyeballed it. As the mixture sits, it releases a bit more liquid. I made sure to add plenty of salt to the sauce so the finished pasta would have enough flavor. It was a good way to help me use my summer bounty of tomatoes.

Just what I was looking for! I wanted something light to go with my orzo...like an orzo pasta salad. And, something simple. This is so good...needs time to macherate but I just can`t help digging my spoon it.  Used basil from my garden and can`t wait until my tomatoes are ripe. This will be my standard summer pasta. YUMM!!

Gotta love when  basic and simple ingredients add up to an easy and delicious meal. I prepped the sauce in the a.m. and couldn't keep my nose out of it all day.  I didn't have one speck of any cheese to top it with and it was still yummy.

This was pretty good. I ended up adding a lot more cheese because at first there was a strong olive oil & garlic taste that I didn't really like.

Excellent!  Very tasty!  The only thing that I did different was to add some of the Kraft Cheese Crumbles "Mediterranean" Style to the tomato mixture and marinated the cheese.  This flavor of cheese has parmesan, mozzarella, and feta cheese in it.  The pieces of cheese are bigger than grated and they slightly melted or softened when the pasta was added.  Very good.  I will make this again.  I also added less garlic but that was just my family's preference.

O my goodness---this is fabulous! Per other reviewers suggestions I only used 1/4 cup olive oil and that was perfect. Added a little salt & pepper and some chicken breasts marinated in italian dressing and grilled. Will definitely make again & again. Thanks for this super easy recipe!

I loved the adaptability of this recipe.  You can really play around with it to suit your own tastes.  I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I just skipped that part, and I still thought it was great.  I even added crab in with it and it was great for seafood & pasta.  I also was not a fan of the raw garlic, so I just picked must of it out.  Perhaps will try a minced garlic jar next time for a lighter flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Most convenient part was that the sauce could be prepared and then left alone to marinate-I went out shopping!

My mother-in-law makes this but also adds brie with the rind removed and torn into small pieces.  Then she leaves it covered at room temp. for hours.  Yummy!

This was ok, especially since it was so hot outside. But it was pretty soupy and I dont think it needed all that olive oil, you could get away with half. Also I love garlic but this was too much raw garlic for me. Might make again but needs to be tweaked.y

This is excellent.  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.  Will definitely make this again before we run out of home-grown tomatoes and basil this year.

Great!  I made this for a dinner party, and all my guests were so impressed!  One idea...use whole-wheat angel hair pasta for a healthy, nutrient-rich main dish, and serve it with homemade foccacia seasoned with ground sage, and a fresh salad with fresh mushrooms and avacado.

This was a great recipe. I cut down on the olive oil and added more pasta so that the pasta wasn't soupy, but more light and refreshing. I also added an extra clove of garlic.I used angel hair pasta and it was perfect. It was a hit and I would definitely make it again and again.

Made with tomatoes and basil freshly picked from the garden, this recipe is fantastic. I used Romano cheese and a few more tomatoes. I could eat this every day, and I will be making it often now that I'm starting to harvest my garden tomatoes.

THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT, QUICK AND SIMPLE SAUCE.  I DID NOT USE AS MUCH GARLIC AS THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND I ONLY HAD DRIED BASIL BUT IT WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH GARLIC.  I CUT UP GRILLED CHICKEN AND SERVED IT WITH THE PASTA W/SAUCE.  IT MADE A GOOD, LIGHT MEAL.  THE KIDS THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT WHICH IS HOW WE MEASURE MOST RECIPES IN OUR HOUSE.

A wonderful, light summer pasta.  I used tomatoes from my garden, so it was even more refreshing than I had anticipated.  The only thing I will do differently next time, is to sauté the garlic in the oil until just softened a little, and once cooled, add it all to the tomatoes.  The only reason I would do this, is because the raw garlic was just too sharp for my kids.  I also didn't use much more than 1/4 cup of olive oil.  Great recipe!

This is a very good recipe for the summer.  I put in way too much garlic -- about 6-7 cloves.  Totally overpowered the taste.  Next time I will use 3-4 cloves of garlic and about 1/4 cup of olive oil.

Wonderful way to use up bountiful homegrown tomatoes!  I too didn't add all of the oil, and added a few more cloves of garlic.  Didn't have the fresh basil, so substituted dried which worked fine.  I used rigatoni, cooked just al dente.  Topped the finished dish with even more coarsely grated parmesan.  With some french bread and a big green salad, this was just enough for a yummy summer supper.

This was quite a tasty little dish!

I used ALOT of salt in this (and even some garlic salt as the 4 cloves of fresh garlic wasn't enough for me!!), although I didn't measure it to give you all exact amounts.  I just kept adding till it tasted good!

I also didn't use the full 1/2 cup of Olive Oil...I started with 1/4 cup, then added a few more splashes as I saw necessary.

This is great served over farfalle pasta with some soft Italian bread on the side...although not very filling for a growing girl such as myself!!  I will DEFINITLEY make this again, but probably only as a side dish to a main course!!

We use half the oil, and add 1/4 chopped green pepper.  Salt or salt substitute is a must to bring out the flavors.

A very popular recipe in Italy during the summer months, but garlic is rarely used.  Consequently, this recipe is a bit overpowering in the garlic department.  I'd also suggest Pecorino Romano vs. parmiggiano for the cheese.

A great, simple recipe to use up leftover pasta and fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden.  The tomato mixture sat for 9 hours and was delicious in this dish.  Leftovers were very good, cold the next day for lunch.  Served this dish with 'Tomato Bruschetta' and 'Apple and Brown Sugar Corned Beef' both AR recipes.

This is wonderful! I grill chicken breast and add to the pasta and add sauteed aspargus and spinach. My family loves this meal.

Wow! I love this dish.  I have tons of ripe tomatoes and basil in my garden so this recipe was perfect.  I sprinkled  fresh parmesan and pepper before eating.  I'll definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe as stated the first time.  The second time, rather than using parmesan cheese,I added 1/2-3/4 cup crumbled feta cheese to the tomato/basic/garlic mixture just prior to adding the hot pasta.  This additional took the recipe to 10 stars!

A-ma-zing! This is so simple, but so delicious. My husband isn't a fan of raw tomatoes, but he does love bruschetta, so I figured this would be hit or miss. Well, we both loved it. We ate the whole thing! It's so light, refreshing, and simple. The only down side is having to plan ahead, which is not my forte, but it's worth it for this meal. We'll be making this many more times!

This is a very good recipe. I do not have a garden and tomatoes are not in season, so I bought a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and drained a little of the liquid in the can (there's just too much!). Other than that I followed the recipe as is, let it sit for 7 hours. It was very light and tasty, which made me eat more! I used a pound of whole wheat spaghetti noodles.

Light and tasty and a good excuse to buy a huge chunk of Pecorino Romano from Costco.  Like other reviewers, I added some fresh mozzarella right before mixing in the pasta.  I also sliced the garlic instead of mincing it which made for some spicy bites.

OH MY GOODNESS!  This was so good!  I thought I was going to have to have more for breakfast (but I didn't)!  I will be eating this until tomatoes are out of season again!  I didn't let it sit out very long, because I couldn't wait.  All I had was dried basil, but I'm sure fresh will be even better.  I will also use a little less garlic.  Thanks Star!

I tripled this recipe for a Bridal Shower and it was great-but I only used 2-lbs of pasta, and it was plenty..I used Roma Toms.  Mixture sat over night.  The only thing I would do differetn is peel the toms, and I served it in a deep bowl,(all the good stuff sank to the bottom) next time I will use a Platter, or Shallow Pasta bowl.  This is a fantastic recipe, too bad my husband doesn't to garlic. Leftovers were wonderful.  Thank-you!!!!

I was looking for a checca recipe to eat (without the pasta) on focaccia bread.  This was delicious.  I reduced the oils and added a little Splenda sweetner to sweeten the tomatoes.  It was excellent!  I plan on making this recipe often.

The garlic made this dish rather spicy. Next time I'm gonig to try cooking thegarlic first. I would also add something for flavor, perhaps calamata olives and chives.

Light and soooo tasty!  I varied it a little, adding sundried tomatoes and finely diced Muenster cheese instead of the parmesan, and tossed it with some tomato & basil Mrs. Dash.  Paired with a green salad and a little wine...VOILA!!!!

A great light recipe to make during the summer with yummy ripe tomatoes!  If you like bruschetta, you'll love this.  I used less olive oil to cut down on the fat.  Yum!

My mother-in-law had a bumper crop of tomatoes this year so we both made this recipe and both liked it very much. My husband liked it best as a chilled pasta salad. He ate all of the leftovers right out of the fridge! I'll be making this again!

This is a great recipe. My entire family loved it. The sauce requires no cooking, but is time consuming as the tomatoes have to be seeded and diced. Once that is done it is super easy and then just sits at room temperature until ready to stir into your cooked pasta. I have made this twice and will make it many more times.

Good way to use up tomatoes.  I would recommend using less oil and less garlic unless you really like it.  All and all quick and easy.

I had something similar to this in a restaurant once
and had been searching for a close recipe until now.
This is absolutely delicious and has become my
favorite use for fresh tomatoes.

I've never done measurements or let it marinate so long so this was very helpful since I hadn't made it in years. I've always made it with diced fresh mozzarella and I prefer that over using parm.  Less salty that way and adds a nice texture and counter to the garlic.

I originally decided to make this recipe because I wanted an easy vegetarian side dish.  I had high hopes but it was average at best.  Leaving it to soak over night was time consuming and didn't really add much to the flavour.  I would need to play with the spices more if I were to make this again.  Easy, but bland

This is the best pasta you can make.  It is not really a sauce - it is just fresh tomatoes and garlic.  Classic Italian flavors.

It's very unique!  I think if you add feta to it, it will make it even better.  This is definately a side dish, and not substantial for a main meal.

It's very tasty, and quite good the next day as leftovers as well!

This was a very tasty way to use tomatoes from the garden. My husband and I both loved it (even though he's not a tomato fan). I've made it twice... it was better when I only let it sit for three hours.

Truly deserving of its high rating. I added maybe a half teaspoon of kosher salt and marinated no more than an hour or so. Can’t imagine making this without fresh, organic ingredients. This is a gardener’s go to.

This recipe is, SO good. I've been making it for years and EVERYTIME I make it for someone else they insist on the recipe. My kids all cheer when I tell them its for dinner, and they dont even like tomatoes.  I use angel hair pasta with this, and if i'm feeling extra unhealthy I throw in some fresh mozzarella. This is divine, its so good I get cold sores from eating it so much in August when my tomatoes are ripe in the garden.  (all the acidity isn't good for my mouth lol)

I didn't marinate the mixture, but it was still delicious. I only had dried basil on hand and used jarred garlic. Had on angel hair pasta, and it was delicious!

Made this for a pot luck we went to last weekend.  Got rave reviews.  One comment--2 pounds of pasta (we doubled the recipe is ALOT).

Beautiful, light, refreshing! I added just a little freshly ground pepper, and made it in a tupperware container so I could shake it up every hour or so.  I let mine sit 6 hours, room temperature.  Served with caserecce pasta (slight twist - holds the sauce) and plenty of freshly grated parmesan.  I made this as a side dish to go with  Chicken Paillard, also from this site. Made for a vibrant, refreshing, summer meal. Edit - Made this twice now. We preferred it to be cooked for just 60 seconds or so with the hot pasta over medium heat.

My husband went nuts over this. It was so fast and easy he can have it anytime he wants. Fresh, delicious, and open to endless variation. Thanks for sharing this.

I have been making this for my family for years. We love it!  Be sure to use fresh, ripe tomatoes.  After combining all ingredients I like to set the (glass) bowl in a sunny window until dinner time.  The flavors really come together nicely.  Delish!

I had tomatoes and basil from the garden to use up. I made up the mixture and put on top of spaghetti squash. It was very good!

I made the recipe as written for the first time last night and it was delicious!  I didn't even add the parmesan since I am trying  to eat more vegan.  I let the tomato mix sit for about 6 hours.  It was a yummy fresh tasting dinner.  I will be adding this recipe to my box!

This is so easy and fresh tasting, you can’t go wrong.  I didn’t have quite enough basil so I added in a little dried basil and let it sit for the full ten hours.  Delicious served with garlic bread.  So easy and so good.

I have been making this for years, everyone loves it. (Except for the few who hate garlic). The best summer pasta ever!

Not bad. Needed a little bit more garlic and definitely more herbs.. I used cherry tomato rather than regular tomatoes for that sweeter taste.

This is good, but I definitely prefer Mean Woman Pasta from this site (with the addition of kalamata olives and pepperocinni)

Loved the fresh flavor, but too much garlic for us.  I sprinkled a shredded italian cheese blend with the parmesan.  I will make this again, but try less oil too.
