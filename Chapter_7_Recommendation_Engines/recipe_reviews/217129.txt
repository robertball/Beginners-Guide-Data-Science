Actually, with some changes it is a 10 and I don't feel bad for making some changes and then rating it because the cook herself in her note suggested most of them.  I used bulk sausage browned and crumbled instead of bacon, no nutmeg, canned diced tomatoes and a few squirts of tomato paste, basil and italian herbs.  I served with fresh grated parmesan, a squeeze of lemon and some garlic croutons.  Took me back to my grandmother's table on Sunday afternoon, she was from Naples, had 10 kids and over 40 grandkids and served a lot of beans and greens out of economic necessity.  To me it is a gourmet treat.

Interesting to try, and certainly not a bad soup.  I've made countless soups similar to this but the flavor of this was different, one that neither Hubs nor I were particularly fond of. Since it was the only ingredient I've never used  before in soups, and since I didn't use the optional nutmeg or red pepper flakes, my guess is that it was the fresh sage that we didn't care for, that we thought gave this an odd flavor. Omit it (and maybe even the basil too) and this would be a far better soup.

This is a delicious, hearty soup.  Next time I would cook the bacon a bit longer before adding the onion, and I would not add the chard stems, just the leaves.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic because I didn't have the sundried tomatoes.  Thanks!

I chose this recipe only because I had everything on hand and needing to be used with the exception of the Chard.  Am I glad I did1  I did alter/add a few ingredients but I'm sure it would be fine stand alone.  Increased the bacon to four slices and fried it by itself and then drained almost all the fat.  Added a bit of EVO and sauteed the onion and extra garlic......can't have too much garlic.  Increased the sun dried tomatoes to about 1/3 C.  The Parmesan rind has to be the key to this recipe.  I've seen it on TV but never tried it myself.  It gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  I think six cups broth is a little shy for soup, if you want it soupy maybe eight cups is better.  I used four cups broth but the orzo I used was already cooked and leftover  so you need to take that into account.   I also increased the basil to about a 1/4C......we like fresh basil!  We loved it and will make it again.

This was everything I hoped it would be... Followed the recipe in everyway but did not have fresh sage, so omitted.   Can't believe that would have made it any better.  It was fantastic.  I did have the Parmiggiano Reggiano Rind, amazingly.  So glad I found a place to use it.  Just experienced the taste of Swiss Chard about a year ago and we really like it.. We have a dinner club with 3 other couples and I can't wait to share it to them. Thanks for sharing, Callinectes.  I did post a picture, because this soup is worth it!  Chris from Texas

This soup was great, however I had some left over sausage and bacon and collard greens and added those to this soup recipe. It turned out fantastic. I would make this soup again and make the same additions.

A delicious soup that's healthy and easy to make.  I added carrots and celery along with the onion.  I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of the sun-dried, and substituted barley for the pasta.  I was happy to be able to use a saved parmesan rind and I think that added some great flavor.

This was fantastic. I used bullion to make the chicken broth, and Asiago instead of Parmesan, but otherwise followed the recipe.

I wanted to make this vegetarian so I skipped the bacon.   I used 3 chipotle peppers that I seeded to add the smoky flavor in lieu of the bacon.  I seeded the peppers in an attempt to lower the spiciness but I wish I had used 2 instead of 3.  It still came out kind of hot.  I also used 2 cans of beans instead of one.

This soup was so delicious! The only sub I made was to use hot italian sausage instead of bacon (about half a package of bulk), and in the future I might add more orzo because we are crazy about it.  Was just as good the next day as well!

Loved this. Very forgiving of substitutions.  Will be adding it into my regular rotation of soups. P.S. Definitely add more liquid than what is called for.

Great fall soup; easy and very flavorful. Wonderful way to feature fall garden goodies -- fresh sage, chard, fresh basil; I used slow roasted romas from the garden instead of the sun-dried tomatoes. Also went with 3 slices of bacon and no olive oil at the end. I used Acini De Pepe pasta, which I had on hand. This is a keeper!

This was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly. Even in August it was delicious. (I don't eat wheat so I crushed some GF spaghetti.) A definite keeper.

Very good base recipe - as it says in the notes, this recipe is very tweak-able - i used canned diced tomatoes, and threw in some leftover diced chicken as well, and used Trader Joe's quick cooking faro instead of pasta. Soup is so often the thing you make when you have a few odds and ends in the fridge that need to be used - so with the help of a few things in the pantry, you have a delicious and hearty meal!

Wow!!  I had my doubts but it was fantastic!  Made a couple changes that others had made.  Added 2 more cups of broth...and cut up the cheese rind so it melts and doesn't leave a big lump of delicious goo...  But WOW!!  The broth was delicious!!  We will make again!!

Kitchen sink recipe!
Meaning a great recipe to adapt (as the writer states) to use up what you have on hand.  I found it after doing an ingredient search on the site in order to get rid of some items before I head out of town for the week.  Generally followed it.
Used double the bacon, beans, and garlic.  Used 1/2 cup ditalini for dried pasta.  Used 8 cups chicken broth.  I had about 3 oz. of jarred (and seasoned) sun-dried tomatoes to use up, so I drained them and chopped.  No swiss chard, but used up some spinach.  No fresh sage, but added about a 1/2 tsp of dried ground sage with the nutmeg to cut down on the concentration.  Simmered longer to let all of this flavor come together.  Overall, really great.  Bonus for the traveller: will freeze well in portions and be an awesome meal when I get home!  Will adapt really well to personal taste and substitutions for what you have on hand.  Highly recommend you try it for yourself as close to the original ingredients as possible, and see for yourself.  Thanks.
PS- Obviously, you should serve with crusty bread!

I used chickpeas since that’s what I had on hand.  I added celery that needed to be used.  I sautéed my onion, celery, and chard stems in the bacon grease from cooking up the beacon.  Deliciousness!

Yes did make a few changes, I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of the sun dried tomatoes.  I did not use the bacon as I made this all-vegetarian dish.   I also doubled the white cannellini beans to two cans and vegetable broth to six cups, pasta I used 1/2 cup small elbow macaroni.

Great flavor in such a short amount of time!  I am not shy about salt, but I found no need to add salt after tasting. Evidently the bacon and Parmesan take care of that. Of course, I added a little black pepper to my serving; who wouldn't? I've never seen nutmeg called for in a soup recipe, but I think that must have  added significantly to the flavor. The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used basil puree in a tube in lieu of fresh leaves, and I found myself without pasta, so had to leave it out, but I'll add it in at the next reheating. I have a thing for carrots in my soup, so I'll try adding them next time and hope it doesn't throw the balance off.

The only change I did was to pan fried  a couple Boar’s Head Uncured Chicken Sausages  without using the bacon at the beginning.  Then thinly sliced the chicken sausage, dish them on the bottom of the bowl before I ladle everything else on the top of it.  Plus I added an extra can of cannelli beans in the soup.  It’s very tasty, I will definitely make it again

Loved this soup! Excellent flavors. I made a double batch and the only changes I made were increasing the garlic to 5 cloves (sliced -- not minced) , adding a little extra bacon, and omitting the sage because I didn't have any. I also used about 3/4 lbs. of dry great northern beans, cooked beforehand in a pressure cooker. This is definitely a keeper for my list of ideas to use up a leftover rotisserie chicken.

This is a delicious soup...easy to make and only gets better the day after.  I used kale instead of chard and petite diced tomatoes drained,  because that is what I had on hand. I also used dried spices.  I doubled the recipe and made extra bacon to top it off.  In the fall we love our soups and this will be a regular on the menu!

Awesome!  Plan to take this to any and all Italian potlucks in the future, maybe to some other 'comfort food' type potlucks as well!  Great make-ahead for such meals.  This is currently, officially, my husband's favorite meatless meal.- well, at least his favorite meatless legume meal.  The kids and I loved it too. (shhh, don't tell hubs how much Italian sausage might add to this soup....., it's already great on its own).  Served this with a copycat of the Olive Garden Salad, and a copycat of Macaroni Grill's bread.  Everything was so special. Hubs did, for a brief moment, challenge me about whether or not I would ever serve this with meat.  I simply told him, "sure, this could be served with meat any time."  But then he went back to how he didn't miss the meat with this meal *at all*.  (and he has asked me to cut back on the meat, so he's happy...... and so am I!!!)

This was a hit with my family. My young kids love it and ate the Swiss chard without any complaints. I did double the pasta and bacon for the kids. The sun-dried tomatoes add a great flavor. We have had this twice already and it will be a regular dish in our house.

Delicious! I made the following changes, though, for personal taste. I substituted red bell pepper for sundried tomatoes, skipped the chard, and used only basil.

I also added additional pasta to make it thicker than a soup. And put a dollop of butter on top before serving.

Excellent soup! The bacon made all the difference.  I used beans I made from scratch & subbed some of the bean water for chicken broth. Used small whole wheat elbow pasta. Eliminated the tomatoes because I didn’t have any. Mmmm!

I made this as per the recipe. I used a Parmesan cheese rind that I had in the freezer and ditalini for the pasta.  After tasting, I added a little salt and a bit more sun dried tomato and basil.  It tasted better the next day after the flavors had “blended”.  All in all, a good soup.

Soup is delicious but I did make a few changes! I used a pound of mild Italian sausage instead of bacon! I eliminated sage and nutmeg. I added one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added about 2 cups of ditalini pasta! I did use a Parmesan cheese rind which definitely added a pleasant cheese flavor to the soup! And my Swiss chard was fresh from my garden! Overall the soup was a big hit and I WILL make it again!!

This soup was excellent. The only change I made was that I used 1 cup of cooked rice instead of the pasta because I did not have any small pasta on hand. The small pasta would have been better, but I had everything else and didn't want to go out just to get that. This recipe is perfect for produce from the garden. I used Swiss Chard, sage, and basil from this year's garden and dried tomatoes from last year's garden. Next time, I will add even more dried tomatoes. I might even add an extra pinch of crushed pepper because we like things on the spicy side. I also appreciated that this was a filling but light soup, which was a great meal even for mid-summer. Very tasty!

We enjoyed this soup using swiss chard.  I didn't have fresh herbs, nor sun-dried tomatoes, and I think it would have benefited more from a parmesan rind than the parmesan I sprinkled on top, but it was a good way to get veggies and protein (beans) in a satisfying soup that lasted us for a few days.

Easy to make and a great soup to make for company as it's guaranteed to impress! I added more garlic, added a bit of orzo pasta and used European bacon as it was on hand (pancetta would be good too!).  I found I needed only half the chard, as it doesn't condense the way spinach does. Otherwise, I made it as described.  Who would've guessed you could use a parmesan rind in soup? Such an amazing flavour! Definitely pair this with a baguette or crusty bread. I'll be making this again soon!  Update: I forgot to add the bacon in yesterday's batch and didn't miss it at all.  Still sooo yummy!

Used others’ suggestions. I like a soup that’s very chunky so I did not increase the stock. I used Vegeta (Polish vegetable stock). I doubled the pasta, omitted the sage because I don’t care for it. I think the Parmesan rind is an absolute must!  If anyone else is wondering How much a bunch really is, I used 9 ounces of red chard leaves and 3 ounces of stem (sorry I forgot to weigh it before I cut everything up so I am stating the amount separately). Could use even more chard to your liking. I used 3 very large fresh Roma tomatoes, 1/2 the nutmeg, and double the beans.

Great quick soup with healthy ingredients. The change that I made was to use some smoked ham and leave off the bacon. Tasty on a cool night with a loaf of bread.

Really enjoyed this soup, easy to make & delicious.  I added bacon & about a half pound of ground Italian sausage, and used 2 quarts of stock.  Next time I may skip the bacon or swap out for prosciutto.  I will also chop the chard smaller than I did the first time as the "ribbons" can get messy on the spoon.

I loved the sun dried tomatoes! This is one of my favs now! I think 2 quarts chicken broth worked well. Could almost double up on the beans too. Added extra chard and basil.  Yummy!

Very good. The broth is very flavorful even without the addition of the nutmeg. Goes wonderful with a side of french bread.

Needed to get rid of a bunch of red chard and somehow make it edible. I only remember eating it once and as I recall, it was kinda meh. This recipe seemed perfect for the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe closely but not exactly. I used dry herbs instead of fresh. Everything else was the same and it. was. awesome! Thanks for sharing. (EDIT: I like to make modifications depending on what I have on hand. Adding ground turkey to the mix was awesome)

I might have liked it better if I didn't use the bacon or cooked the bacon first and then chopped it up for the soup. The bacon stayed really chewy and that just grossed me out. Probably won't make it again.

I did not have nutmeg,  but i crisped the bacon befor i chopped it. I also added 3 small young shallots to the onoin mix. I Carmelized the whole lot befor adding the broth and beans. only had BetterThan Bullion on hand instead of chicken broth.  Same thing really. I should have cut the chard ribbons a bit shorter. I only had dry sage, so i added it early. This is outstanding no matter the variety .

Made again with fresh sage. I think the flavor was better when i used the dry sage that i added earlier. Plus, crisping the bacon and carmelizing the onions before adding the broth is definitely   the bestter route if you have the extra time. None tge less, this is an excellent recipe.

Easy, tasty, one-dish meal!  I used cheese tortellini for the pasta, and prosciutto instead of bacon (since that was what I had on hand).  Perfecto!  Everyone had seconds.

Yum! I followed the base recipe exactly, something I rarely do, and it was delicious! I'm guilty of throwing in some turkey meatballs to make it a complete meal, but the soup was good without them. Thanks for posting the recipe, I'm always looking for chard recipes!
