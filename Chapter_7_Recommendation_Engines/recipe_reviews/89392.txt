I don't know how long this recipe has been available at this site, but I don't think I'd ever seen a recipe without rates or reviews before and I want to encourage you to try this dish.  It has a yummy, rich topping, definitely not for the person that wants a plain piece of salmon.  I recommend making half of the mayonnaise/mustard topping.  There is NO way you need as much as the recipe calls for, and that would greatly reduce the fat and calorie count.  With that one change I think you'll find this is a delicious way to enjoy your salmon.

WOW WOW WOW WOW!  The creamy dill sauce is absolutely out of this world, yummy!  Instead of all mayo, I used 1 cup lowfat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup mayo (to keep it lighter and healthier!), and I only had dijon mustard on hand - so I used that instead of regular mustard.  Didn't have thyme, so I used more fresh basil.  Also, I find it necessary to season salmon with fresh, crushed garlic and salt/pepper..rubbed in with extra virgin olive oil.  Topped each filet with the sauce and baked on olive-oil sprayed foil-lined baking sheet for 15-20 minutes.
Thank you so much for this excellent recipe!  In my binder, permanently! :-)

My Husband ACTUALLY ATE SALMON! Very excellent, Only 4 stars becasue why put all that fatty mayo on your healthy fish?  I substituted most of the mayo for plain unsweetened yogurt.  TERRIFIC.  This sauce was so good I will probably use it for any time I want sauce for fish.  I just used the dried herbs because that was all I had, no problems, fresh would be even bettr I'm sure. I have to admit I also put a tiny bit of brown sugar in the sauce-maybe a Tablespoon. I squeezed lemon on my fish and sprinkled it with salt and pepper before spreading on the sauce too.  Really Loved it!

I read the reviews and made a few changes per what people said.  Instead of mayo, I used plain lowfat yogurt and dijon mustard.  Did not have fresh basil but used dried thyme, basil, oregano and dill to make the sauce.  Sprinkled the salmon fillet with salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder and spread the dill mixture on top.  It was so good!  I am glad we had extra sauce because I made roasted red potatoes and broccoli.  My 8 year old step-son couldn't stop eating it and he loved dipping the broccoli in the extra sauce.  Since it was yogurt and no mayo I figured he could enjoy a little extra and it got lots of green vegetable into him!

The recipe is okay, except that it's a bit oily.  The dill sauce keeps the salmon from rendering it's fat pockets, so in the end it's oilier then it should be.  It's better to broil/bake the fish with a little salt and pepper, and to use the dill sauce as a dressing on the side of the fish when you plate it.  Also I changed the recipe and used 2 parts yogurt and 1 part mayo, with dijon AND brown mustard, with a little Italian herbs and dill.

The major change I made was substituting low-fat yogurt for all the mayonnaise - it was phenomenal!  The yogurt gave it a nice tangy flavor, and it wasn't greasy at all.  I also felt better knowing it was a little healthier.  The fiance loved this dish (kept going back for more sauce for dipping!), so it's a keeper!

I was just making one portion so I made the topping with about a T of lite mayonnaise, roughly the same amount of Dijon mustard, a pinch of the dried herbs, and a very small of fresh basil (Husband isn't a big fan). I followed the '20 mins per inch thickness' baking rule, and it turned out perfectly. Husband said a little less topping would have been better. But anyway, thanks!

Hubby liked much more than I did.  I am not a big mayo fan when it comes to fish.  I thought that it completely overpowered the taste of the salmon...and would much rather taste my expensive fish.  I will make again...for hubby, but reduce the amount of mayo.  Thanks for the post.

I've made this twice now.  the first time I followed the recipe very closely and it was excellent!  Moist with a beautiful combination of flavors, and easy, too.  The other night, we wanted it again, but did not have fresh thym or basil, but we did have fresh cilantro/coriander.  The coriander mayo mix was delish, but we thought is needed *something*, so a dash or two of Tabsco later, it was perfect.  Both versions get a big thumbs up.

I actually have a recipe thats so similar to this where you use about a lb of salmon fillets, 1/3 cup sour cream, 2 tsp. of dill weed, 2 tsp. of yellow mustard, 3 tbs. of mayonnaise, 2 tsp finely minced onion, 2 tbs grated parmesean cheese and 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  I lay the fillets in a greased baking dish.  Then in a separate dish, I combine the sour cream, mustard, onions, mayonnaise,  and dill weed.  Then I season it with salt and pepper.  Next, spread the mixture over the salmon and bake at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes.  When the fillets are just done, I sprinkled a little paprika over top it and added the cheeses.  I then broiled it for about a minute.  It is delicious :)

Not a big fan of this recipe. The recipe makes way too much of the sauce. I threw more than half of it out after covering my fillets. To me the mustard taste was a bit strong, I was scraping the sauce off in order to eat it. I think I will stick to lighter salmon recipes that compliment the salmon rather than overpower it.

We love salmon in all forms.   I am very partial to dill (dried or fresh) and use it a lot on fish and vegetables.    Really enjoyed your recipe but like another reviewer stated - it really does not need mayo and yoghurt actually brings out the fresh flavor much better.     Thanks for a good addition to our salmon file.

I wasn't sure I would like this because -- holy cow, that's a lot of mayo!  But I needed a quick recipe for salmon with dill, and made this to the recipe.  It was really good and my super-picky family loved it!  I will make it again!

Sorry, but I really wasn't too thrilled about this recipe. My son's and their gals liked it though, so I gave it a higher rating. However my husband and I felt like the sauce masked the taste of our salmon too much. In fact my husband said it was like eating salmon with tarter sauce smeared all over it. I also felt the sauce had too much mustard in it and also makes a lot more than you need. I had three pounds of Salmon and had a lot leftover. I am glad I didn't use an expensive wild salmon with this recipe...I think this is the kind of recipe for those that don't really like the taste of fish...since the sauce is about all you taste.

Yum. I would say there was too much sauce, but I used the excess on my rice. Next time I won't be using mayo, but the yogurt as everyone's suggestions. Not only is it fatty but I find after you're halfway through, you get a little sick of the mayo taste. I also rubbed minced garlic, salt and pepper on the fish first, and mixed 1 tsp of dill in with the sauce, and then the other tsp on top.

I used low fat yogurt instead of mayo, cut the mustard to 1/3 cup, fresh herbs, and added some salt , pepper, garlic and onion powder to the sauce. It was fabulous. The only suggestion is I don't see how the cook time can be 30-40 mins. My filets were thick and cooked perfectly in 20 mins at 375. Will def make this again!

Love, Love, Love this recipe!! I slather the sauce over the fillets and they turn out perfectly.  I usually use a little lore mustard than called for, and a little less mayo.  I also use Italian Seasoning in place of the other herbs, and it lends a wonderful flavor to the dish.  Very nice compliment to the dill.  My bf gives this rave reviews!

Mustard doesn't seem to do well as a baking accoutrement.   I took everyone's advice and cut down on the sauce tremendously, especially the mustard.  The sauce was tasty in the mixing bowl but was  way too baked-on after baking.  It was like crenallated topping...not a true sauce just some cooked-on glop.  I am sorry i wasted 2 nice fillets for this.  I will stickto baking with olive oil/spices/white wine or grilling with a honey-mustard sauce.  I hate to give negative reviews but also hate the thought of someone else wasting salmon which is not cheap.

This gets 4 stars for flavor. WOW!!! I tweaked this tasty recipe (and hopefully reduced fat and calories) by following the advice of other reviewers. I reduced the amount of sauce by 2/3.  I squeezed the juice of 1/4 lemon over a 1 lb sockeye salmon filet; then mixed 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt, 1/8 cup dijon mustard with fresh lemon thyme, oregano, and basil. Also used fresh dill and added freshly grated pepper. Baked at 375 for 18-20 min. Spooned the fish and sauce over a bed of brown rice. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

Very tasty and easy to make!  For the dill, you only need to sprinkle it on the top so there is a thin, even layer over the fillet.  I had a thinner fillet too, so it only took 30 minutes to bake.

Delicious!  We loved it!  The only change for us was cutting the recipe down for two people. Definitely will make again.

Excellent.  I halved the sauce and used all dried herbs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great when company came over for supper.

Not a bad sauce, although a bit heavy due to the mayo.  Works well on white fish too.  Wish I had some yogurt around, as some others have suggested.  Try adding a splash of dry white wine and a splash of lemon for a slightly fancier taste.

This is the best salmon recipe I have found yet.  I used frozen salmon fillets and I only used about 1/2 the mayo, however it does absorb into the fish somewhat during cooking.  My husband actually asked for more sauce so he could pour it over his veggies.4 stars instead of 5 because the sauce isn't very healthy.

We're also not huge fans of salmon in my house, but are trying to eat more of it for the health benefits... this was a really easy & delicious recipe!!

I only made 2 pieces of fish, so I made about 1/3 of the sauce.  And I broiled it instead of baking.  I had to move my rack down to the 2nd position b/c the sauce started to burn, but it worked out great.  A definate keeper!

This is a great recipe that really keeps the salmon moist during cooking.  The flavor is great.  I thought the mayo might make it too heavy but it was just right.  I agree with other users- way too much sauce- you can definitely half it.

This was a good salmon recipe.  Everyone liked it, although the recipe made WAY too much sauce (I had almost 3 pounds of salmon).  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream (you can add more/less depending on how much sauce is left) to the extra sauce to make dip - just make sure that the sauce hasn't come in contact with the fish.

I do like mustard on fish (call me crazy).  I used 1/4 c light sour cream, 1/4 lowfat plain yogurt, 1/4 mayo, and a little less than 1/4 mustard.  Then, I cut all of the herbs in half, you could reduce the thyme even a bit more.  All of this was on the advice of other reviewers.  I did still have leftover sauce.  I think I will toss some shrimp in the leftover sauce and bake, and serve over pasta.

I did change this recipe but I give it 4 stars for inspiration.  I adjusted the sauce by blending 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1 clove of garlic, 3 tbs mayo, 2 tsp mustard, and fresh herbs (all listed in recipe) with the juice of 1/2 lemon and salt to taste.  I followed the rest of the recipe as given.  The fish was cooked perfectly! The family ate every bite.

**** I made the recipe as written and it was a HUGE hit.  Since then, I've joined weight watchers, and I now make a WW friendly version, simply substituting fat free mayo for the regular mayo  JUST as delicious and no sacrificing of flavour, if you're in the mood for  really rich fish dish for company.     I served it with boiled new red potatoes and steamed julliened carrot, parsnip and red & yellow pepper strips with a little of the extra sauce.   Delightful!

While the herbs used in this recipe complement the salmon perfectly, I felt like the cream sauce absolutely RUINED a perfectly good salmon. I am from NewEngland, and we tend to be a bit picky about our seafood (if not borderline snobbish, hah!)  1st -- I followed many other reviewers in substituting plain nonfat yogurt instead of all that mayo. I think the mustard absolutely KILLS the essence that a creamy dill sauce SHOULD be going for.    But as I first stated, the combination of herbs were fantastic! I will use these herbs again to bake my salmon, but will leave out this particular cream sauce.   I have made other cream sauces which consisted of just heavy cream (or 1/2 + 1/2), butter, and herbs, cooked in a skillet and then drizzled on the salmon before plating... and think I will stick to that.

Delicious!  I followed the advice of another user and sprinkled w/salt and pepper and squeezed lemon juice on the salmon before I put the sauce over them.  I left out the brown suger though.  But this is a delicious sauce.  And I will definitely make this one again and again!

In case it hasn't been mentioned, the original amount of the Dill is scaled wrong for the amount of fish. It is enough for well over 2lbs of fish. I scaled it down to 2 servings, from 4, and used 2 lbs. of Salmon and still had a lot leftover. 
It's a fantastic sauce and I don't change a thing, but something went haywire with the sauce. 
I should have noticed it when I saw it calling for that amount of mayo for so little Salmon.

Enjoy...excellent recipe

Very tasty.  I cut the total mayo/mustard to 1 T mayo, 1 T nonfat plain yogurt, 1 T dijon mustard and 1 T spicy brown mustard based on other reviews.  It was plenty of sauce for my 3/4 lb salmon fillet

This was the worst recipe I have ever made in my life!  It was horrible!!!
My boyfriend would not even swallow the first bite and he and I both love Salmon.
Sorry, but if I make this again it will be for someone that has made me mad. :-)

This was good, I made exactly as directed.  I can see why others are using plain yogurt.  It was very, very rich and I didn't even use all of the sauce.  I can also see why so many who are "iffy" on fish might love this, it's a great recipe if you want to mask the flavor a little.  My husband said he didn't think it was subtle enough and I have to agree, it hid more than enhanced. Overall though, it was good.  Just not one of my favorites.

This is an excellent sauce for salmon- I always use half mayo and half sour cream per the other reviews.  My mom even likes this and she doesn't care for salmon.

I served this at a dinner party and it was a huge hit. A couple of tiny additions: I rubbed the salmon with olive oil, salt and pepper, then coated with the sauce and refridgerated until just before serving. Also, based on other comments, I made the sauce and divided it in half straight away. I put half in the small bowl and refridgerated until supper. The extra sauce (not heated) was passed with the salmon - and it was packed with flavor after sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours. Next time I divide it 1/3 -- 2/3, and kept the 2/3 for passing. There was not a drop of sauce left at the end of dinner.
This is a great make ahead meal. Allows you time to visit with your guests, and then pop it in the over for 12 minutes before dinner, serve it hot and fresh.

Everyone in my family loves this salmon.  I use about 1/3 cup of mayo and 1/3 cup of dijon mustard, which is plenty.  Thanks for sharing.

This was SO moist and delicious!  The only thing I did differently was exchange dijon for the regular mustard.  My boyfriend said we could've halved the mustard but it was still absolutely delicious and we ate every bite, one of the best Salmon recipies I've ever tried.  I cooked it in the oven in a hard annodized fish pan with raised ridges and the fish slid right off the skin (which came up easily on it's own for cleanup - I'd sprayed the pan with Pam) after about 30 minutes.  Excellent dish - gotta love those Alaskans!

This was absolutely wonderful!!!  Salmon has a strong taste but if you want to "mild it down", this is the recipe.  I had a nice chunk but it was only .86 ounces, about 1 1/2" tapering down to 1/16".  I scaled the whole recipe down to "one serving" to get the  quantity of ingredients right (even though the amount of salmon was just right for two).  I used dried herbs for everything but the same quantity and added pepper, the same quantity.  I added 1 t. garlic powder and then didn't measure, just sprinkled the dill over it to finish.  I did go to the 40 minutes for baking.  It was PERFECT from end to end!  It was moist and flaky.  Soooo easy yet could be part of an elegant meal.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I altered it just a bit, I mixed honey mustard and yellow mustard. My husband said "this was the best Salmon I have ever eaten". I agree that it was really tasty. My kids even liked it.

This was okay.  The mayo mixture made way too much.  If you are going to try this, cut back on the mayo and use dijon mustard.  That's what I would do if I were to make it again, which I won't.  There are too many other delicious salmon recipes out there.  This isn't one of them.

I really liked this recipe, but my husband did not. And he eats practically anything. I think it just had a little too much dill. And it made entirely too much sauce. I will try it again with less dill and sauce.

This was a great, easy way to cook salmon.  Very easy and tasty.  One thing that I will do next time though is use a little less mustard as I found that a little to much

I served this for dinner last week. I'm not always a big salmon fan, but I am now! I have to take exception to some of the reviews that said the sauce was oily or greasy. You must not substitute low or nonfat mayonaise, as they are made with chemical ingredients that were not made to be heated. Julia Child (Bless her) had it right when she said that there was no substitute for butter. This will be a regular in my house. The extra sauce was great with roasted asparagus. I did add a bit of lemon zest to the sauce and was heavy with fresh ground pepper, but a super way to enjoy salmon which is a moderately priced fish.

Very tasty!  I paired it with the toasted sesame seed asparagus recipe, as a sidedish.  My wife loved it.

I agree that there is a need to reduce the amount of sauce.

This is a very tasty dish. My husband loves it, but I can't get past all the mayo grease that's surrounding my beautiful salmon. (I uploaded a photo.) Maybe I don't know the definition of creamy sauce, but this doesn't have it. Sure it's like that before you put it in the oven, but before it's all over, you end up with a clear greasy substance. The dill saves the day as far as taste goes.

I'm giving it three stars because my husband did love it, but you're not going to get creamy, and definitely not healthy.

I also cut the mayo recipe down. Still a bit much.

I'm a 33y/o bachelor, never cooked any sort of fish before.  To be blunt, I'm a terrible cook and cooking fish is like wiring electricity in the house: it's easy, but could be dangerous if not done right.  I made this recipe as directed and aced it the first time through.  It was easy, delicious, and one that I'm cooking for the second time as I type this.  Well done.  Thank you...for not starving this carry-out king.

I used low fat greek yogurt instead of mayo.  Has good flavor. I prefer my fish to be "lighter" instead of smothered with cream sauce but nonetheless it was tasty!

I used full fat Greek yogurt, dijon mustard, and dried herbs.  Salmon stayed moist, but took longer than I'm used to cooking salmon because of the sauce insulation.  I cook to 130 degree on thermometer.

Pros: 
-fish comes out cooked very nicely (moist, flaky)
-recipe's easy

Cons: 
-recipe makes way too much topping

The results of this recipe were okay. My boyfriend thought it tasted great, but I prefer other salmon recipes to this one. Perhaps a matter of taste here.

This was great. Make sure you season your fish first. The sauce makes a TON. I was only making 3 pieces of salmon so I should have cut the sauce in half. You would have enough sauce for 10 pieces of fish. I used 6 oz of greek yogurt for part of the mayo. I didn't have any basil or oregano so I just used Italian seasoning. Will be making again and again. I love the sauce so much I had it the next day on a turkey burger...wonderful!

I got mixed reviews from my family. My hubby and daughter hated it but I liked it (not crazy for em' though but good enough). Okay, the reason why our overall rating was average is because my hubby it was way too much mayo/mustard and oozed out. He also did not care for the dill. I guess he is used to a firmer texture where the sauce stayed in placed when sliced and did not compare to the other favorite staples that consisted a white sauce base. I'm going to make some tweaks on this recipe and will update in the future.

Overall, a good base recipe.  I had a one LB fillet and used about half of what was called for and still had more than enough.  I adjusted the amounts of each ingredient to my personal taste and added garlic powder.

Wow.  My boyfriend licked his plate. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 c. plain yogurt, 1/4 c. mayo.  The only mustard that I had was hot and spicy, but it turned out great!

WAY too much sauce... too much mustard, too. I had already cut the sauce recipe back a lot for 2 large salmon fillets but it was still a big waste of sauce. I ended up putting this on a bed of white rice so the sauce had somewhere else do go. I'll make this again but I'll cut back on both the mayo and mustard.

Apparently there's no middle ground when it comes to this recipe.  Most good sandwiches contain both mayo and mustard with only a modest amount of mustard directly in contact with the meat.  A ratio of less yellow and more white improves this dish as evidence by solutions presented in other reviews.  That's what I did and it was a winner.

Very tasty.  You may find yourself adding more dill than is called for.  Like many others I used a mix of yogurt and mayo to lighten it up a bit.  Also, the longer you let the sauce sit, the stronger it becomes.  I had some leftover sauce and used it the next day in a dip and it was great.

If I were to describe this dish in one word it would be weird. Not gross but weird. I followed the directions percisely and could not bring myself to eat it untill I scraped off most of the toping. The mustard was a weird flavor with salmon and it had way to much seasoning. I am from Alaksa in the town with the best Salmon fishing in the world and have had salmon many diffrent ways but this is one way I will never eat it again.

Adjusted this according to some other people's ideas.  Used plain yogurt (i used Greek yogurt). Also rubbed salmon with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper before spreading the sauce on thick.  My fiance and I LOVED it!

To reduce calories, I used fat free mayo and only 1 cup and it still turned out really good. The sauce made a BUNCH, but it also cooked up some in the oven, so put on more sauce than you think you need. I saved the extra sauce to use on chicken.

I reduced amount of mayonnaise, preparing the mixture earlier in the day to give the herbs an opportunity to blend - also added dill directly into mayonnaise mixture.  This recipe is very easy and quick to prepare, producing a tasty version of salmon.  My fish was fully cooked within 20 minutes.

Ok this was so good, but I did change it a little but not cause I wanted to. Somehow I forgot to get mustard and thought I had some but I didnt. So I cut the mayo in half and use some plain yogurt for health, and used annie goddess dressing in place of mustard and a little lemon. I used fresh herbs and I think I used more than I was suppose to but I did it to taste. I will remake it the right way next time just to see, I hate when people make things on here and completely change everything than rate it. So maybe I will rerate it too, but it was sooo good.

The taste was good (used dijon). But it was so oily that it was hard to get past the greasy taste.  I might use the sauce as a dipping sauce next time....not cooked, so that the mayo does not break up under the heat.

Just made this as a last minute meal for myself so I scaled the recipe to 2 and it still came out to be way too much!!  I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on one side, then lightly sprayed some foil and placed the pieces seasoned side down and then topped it with the sauce and dill!  I couldn't exactly close them after so I folded the edges of the foil up and placed them on a baking sheet for 40 minutes (I like mine dry) but still came out so juicy and flaked perfectly!!  My boyfriend is an extremely picky eater and said he couldn't eat because he was going to the gym but said he'd have bite, finished the whole piece then had some of mine!  I love the flavors of this but the sauce should be used sparingly, I thought about using the extra as a dipping sauce but it would be way too much, it would be good with lightly seasoned or blackened salmon though!  Great easy recipe, I made the sauce in a measuring cup and used foil...barely any clean up!!

We really liked it.  My husband at the whole thing with sauce, even though he "doesn't like mustard".  I only made half the sauce and didnt use dill because we were out.  I think if I made it again I would use a little less mustard.  Very good though.

in general we liked it, but the prevailing opinion is that it needs some kick. we're thinking horseradish. this, btw, would be REALLY good on a salad (no dressing). i think i'd like to try it with sour cream too, instead of so much mayo.

Being an Alaskan with a freeezer full of salmon that needs to be eaten before we approach another fishing season, I'm always looking for new ways to cook salmon.  This recipe was **OK** but in no way fantastic.  I chose to use yogurt instead of mayo (why take a healthy fish and make it unhealthy???) but I found the mustard to be too strong and overwhelming.  While my family ate the fish, none were turning cartwheels over it.  I cut two fillets into normal (computer-mouse) sized portions and baked for 30 minutes with the skin on. It was fine but a little dry.  I would have removed at 25-27 minutes.  Hope this helps!

This was great.  The Salmon was very moist.  I was afraid the mustard would be overpowering, but it was not.  Used 1/2 lite mayo and 1/2 lite miracle whip.  I had a whole salmon fillet and felt like I was frosting a cake.  I still had a lot of the mix left over.  Thank you for sharing.  My family loved it!

I gotta admit I had my doubts about this recipe but I tried it anyway because of all the good reviews. I cut the recipe in half as suggested, and it made a perfect amount. When my husband (the picky eater) tried it, all he said was "OH, WOW!" over and over again. He absolutely LOVED it. I loved it, too and will most definitely keep this recipe and use it again! I did not have any of the fresh herbs, so I used dried and adjusted accordingly. I used dijon mustard. YUMMY!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I live a very low-carb life so this was great.  The only change I made was that I added about 1 tbs of fresh lemon juice to the mayo mix.  Also, I only had dry (not fresh) herbs... tasted just fine :)

Super Delicious!  You have to try this recipe!  To make it healthy, I used non-fat plain yogurt instead of mayo.  I also used dijon mustard instead of prepared.  Just a sprinkling of salt and pepper on the salmon and that sums up the changes I made!  The sauce is amazing!  I ended up only preparing half of the sauce, as other reviewers suggested.  It still makes plenty.  This is definitely being added to my rotation.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was fabulous!  I didn't alter it much except that I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried.  I also halved the mayo/mustard mixture to use on a 1 lb. filet (and it was done in 30 minutes).  This was so tasty and tender.  Thank you.

Very easy to make, but way too "mustardy".  I used dijon mustard, substituted 1/3 of the mayo for plain yogurt and added pepper.  On salmon it wasn't bad, but not on white fish which we tried with the leftover sauce (it made lots!).  I'll be looking for another idea for fish.

Apart from the hilarious overestimation of the amount of sauce to make which others have mentioned (for which i believe 1/10th of the amount would suffice), I feel like this is a recipe to mask the flavor of salmon, not enhance it...  4 of us ate this meal and comments included "it tastes like good salmon and then this mayonnaise crusty stuff loosely floating on top.."  I wanted to write this while I still have the taste in my mouth... I believe it would have been better to eat the salmon cooked bare...

This was fantastic! I seasoned the salmon with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some lemon. Followed the recipe...it does make a lot. Family raved about it, I will make again! (I used the leftover sauce on boneless chicken breasts a few nights later, yum!)

This was delicious and simply to prepare!  I cut the sauce in half and I still had leftover creamy dill sauce!  The only thing I did different than the recipe was I used 3/4 of a cup of smart beat (fake mayonnaise) and 1/4 a cup of real mayonnaise and I added extra dill because it just felt right :)  Delicious and will definitely make again.

this recipe was alright i guess..i would not serve it to company though.  the sauce was...thick and didn't smooth out over the fish well at all.  it just kind of clumped on top and then fell to the side.  way too yellow.  not pleasing to the eye at all.  next time i would put a much smaller amount on the fish.  i only used about a spoonful per fillet this time, but next time i would use even less.

My fillet was 1/2 lb so I used 1 1/2 tbl mayo and 1/2 tbl dijon mustard. Also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the mix and on top of the fish prior to spreading. Baked it for 13 mins, just until light pink. VERY GOOD.

Fantastic I could not believe how delicious this was the first time I made it. Several friends with whom I shared the recipe have also had great success.It has become Dad's Famous Salmon Recipe.
Don't change a thing just follow the simple instructions.

This was fabulous!  I used veganaise because that's all I had but I like mayo anyway.  Here's the thing for me- if you have a cheap frozen salmon filet that you won't to dress up this recipe is PERFECT for that and my salmon tasted 100% better than ever before.  If you have a lovely fresh salmon piece however, I still prefer olive oil, salt and pepper on a cedar plank on the grill because the natural salmon flavors aren't overwhelmed that way.  That said, I am SO glad to find a way to doctor up a not so appetizing piece of fish.

This was good.  I followed others' suggestions and used half the amt. of mayo/mustard for the sauce and I still had a bunch leftover.  I think I'm going to be using it to make tuna salad.

The flavor is good, and even my 4 yo & 6 yo devoured this, but I think I prefer dry seasonings on my salmon & use the sauce on the side.  It was just too rich/mayo-tasting for me.

This was very good, but I agree with the other reviews that say that it makes too much sauce.  Definitely halve the mayonnaise and mustard.  I did that, and additionally added 1/4 cup white wine, which thinned the sauce, making it easier to spread.  I didn't even use all the sauce, but it leaves enough extra that you can serve some on the side for those who like more.

I also preferred using fresh dill, it gave it a much deeper dill aroma, which goes so well with salmon.  I almost wish I had added some lemon juice as well, and may try that next time, as well as trying to substitute half of the remaining mayo with nonfat, plain yogurt to lower the fat.

My kids liked it as well.  I made one 1.5 lb fillet with this sauce and another with a simpler butter/wine sauce, and this was their favorite of the two.

I  did not like this one.  It tasted like mustard.  Maybe if there was a LOT less mustard this would be okay.  But I will not try it again.

Very good, but I made half the sauce, using low fat mayo. The suggestions from the other reviewers used yogurt, but yogurt has way too many carbs if you're on a low carb diet. We loved it the way I made it.

This is a good simple recipe.  My husband and I both really like it.  I have made it with fresh and dried herbs and both ways are good.  Also Like to add fresh parmesan cheese to kick it up a knotch....YUMMY!

OMG! This is soooo good. Really takes away from the fishy taste. This is our new regular recipe for salmon. I just added a half of a lemon (juice) in and 1/4 t of garlic powder. I used all dried herbs but used more than what it called for if it was supposed to be fresh herbs. TIP: Place fish in aluminum foil and create a pocket with enough air to circulate and it comes out wonderfully!!! COOK AT 425, FOR 15 MINUTES. TRUST ME...

I was looking for a new way to enjoy salmon and both my husband and I thought that this recipe was fantastic.  It was also very simple and quick.  It went great with asparagus and I used the leftover herbed mayo (which there was quite a bit) for sandwiches and in chicken salad.

Excellent recipe - but the sauce could definitely be halved, and next time I'll try it with yogurt as others have suggested for a little lower cal/fat option.  Great recipe, though, and I'm excited to try the spread recipe on chicken!

This was an interesting and different dish.  I halved the recipe as was suggested by other users.   Even though I halfed the recipe there was still quite a bit left over, which was great as a dip for veggies! I also used half dijon, half plain mustard.

After reading the other reviews, I used mostly yogurt but found I had way too much sauce so I only used half. I wish I had halved the recipe in the first place, instead I ended up throwing out a lot of the sauce. Other then that, this is pretty good, not fantastic but pretty good.

Yummy and easy.  I used mostly yogurt instead of mayo.  I threw in a couple of tbsp of mayo just to make it a little sweeter/creamier.  But it was good the way it was.  I also used dijon mustard.

The topping completely hid the taste of the salmon and I only used half of it on the salmon.  If I was to make this again, I wouldn't use yellow mustard (honey mustard would likely be better) and I would only make 1/4 of the amt.

My boyfriend is NOT a fish eater, but this got him to eat salmon! The first time I substituted the full fat mayo (yuck!) with lite miracle whip because people had said a sweeter type of sause. I also tried fat free mayo, which was also excellent - either works, depending on your taste preferences. The cool dill flavor goes so well with the creamy sause and the hot salmon. Excellent recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend and I, we both loved it!  I didn't use the exact measurments given, since I was only cooking for two, but it was very close.  I served it with fresh asparagus sauteed w/garlic in olive oil and lemon juice, and pasta w/a creamy pesto sauce.  The flavors complimented each other well.  Will definately use this again.

Delicious! A little greasy but a very good taste with fish. Maybe not as much mayo next time.

This is crazy good.  I also used yogurt for most of the mayo, and cut the sauce down by maybe 1/3.  It was just enough to totally cover 3 salmon steaks, and it was wonderful.  Best creamy dill I've had!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to prepare.  Even making the "prepared mustard" (which I didn't have) was easy.
I liked it so much I wanted everyone I know to try it!  I did follow the advice of previous reviews and only prepared half of the sauce and it was just right.  Enjoy!

Used a 1 lb. salmon fillet (previously frozen) and about 1/4 of the sauce spread on top. Rest of sauce was used for dipping. Salmon was moist and delicious.

This is up in the running for one of my favorite salmon recipes.  My husband could not stop talking about it.  I followed the recipe exactly except for not using all of the mixture on top of the salmon.  I used the extra to serve on the side for dipping as another had suggested.  Super easy - the prep time is only about 5 minutes.  A perfect meal!

Great recipe!  Even my two-year old, who wont eat meat - LOVED this!  Although you only need 1/3 of the mustard & mayonnaise like others have suggested. I had to throw away quite a bit.  Definately will make again!

While I think a least *some* of my distaste for this dish was brought about by having less than 100% fresh cuts of salmon, I found the dill sauce a bit overpowering as mixed per the recipe.

This is one rich dish! I made the mistake of doubling the mayonnaise mixture because I used 3lbs. of salmon fillets; the amount of mayonnaise originally called for would have been sufficient because of its richness. Next time, as per other reviewers' suggestions, I would use half the amount of the spread, and I would also mix the dill right into the spread instead of sprinkling it on top. With this recipe, a little goes a long way; it is good, but it is filling. I didn't really care for this as a leftover dish, so next time I'll also only make what is necessary for one meal. Thank you sharing this recipe, my husband and I enjoyed it, and I will be using it again.

This is a great recipe.  I made it the first time as written (with less sauce) and have made it a couple of times changing things up a little.  Today I made it with 1/2 cup mayo, 2 - 3 tbsp dijon mustard and added garlic and onions to the other herbs listed but no dill (didn't have any more).  And it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

mmmmm What a great way to prepare salmon. I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but I recognize its health value; therefore, I'm always searching for a way to prepare it so it doesn't taste like 'salmon'. This recipe definitely fits the bill!! The whole family loved it!

One of the easiest and most delicious ways to prepare salmon.  I did what others' suggested and cut the amounts of ingredients in half. It made plenty of sauce even like that. I will cut it to a third of what the recipe calls for.

I was a little sceptical of the ingredients in this recipe but thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did!  I also cut back on the sauce like most others. Very very tasty and quick! Now if that doesn't make for a perfect recipe nothing ever will!!

This was really good. I'm not a big salmon person, but all of the kids and dh love it. I halved the recipe (like everyone else recommended)and had plenty for the 2 fairly large fillets. We had it with potato pancakes and broccoli and it was a great meal. It's a keeper for us :)

This was an absolute success!   I made this dish for Christmas Eve and it was delicious.  The sauce was prepared one day ahead and it taste like I spent hours preparing it.     Highly recommend with a side dish of garlic, butter rice.   This is a keeper for sure. 

Thank you!

Delicious! My smaller fillets only required 12-15 minutes, so gauge yours accordingly. I changed up the mayo for low-fat Greek yogurt and used Dijon mustard. We will happily make this again!  So good!

Delicious and like restaurant quality. I only had two small-to-medium sized filets, and cut way back on the amount of sauce. I just started by eye-balling how much mayo looked right for the filets. I'm not used to so many spices for a salmon dish (usually just use dill), but they worked. I'd just cut back a tad on them the next time. I also started by adding some olive oil to the filets, topped with salt, pepper, garlic powder and the sauce. (I made a mistake and mixed the dill in with it, but it was still very good.) Baked for 20 min, and it was great!

Easy to make.  I cooked it on the BBQ.  It was fantastic.  I had multiple guest and I doubled the recipe.  I used both King Salmon and Sockeye Salmon.  I think the consensus was the King Salmon was better because it was meatier, however, the sockeye was a favorite of the people that didn't want to pick out bones.  Overall, fantastic.  Easy to make..

A little hard for me to rate it the way it's written.  I made the sauce using  plain greek yogurt, and only used about 1/2 cup.  Cooked the salmon and then added the sauce on top.  I would highly recommend using those changes.

This recipe was perfect for a Keto diet. Lots of Fat and low carb. It didn't seem oily to me at all. I'm not a big fan of mustard but this had just the right amount. Perfect!

It was sooooo tasty
My whole family loved it!

Definitely a winner!

I halved the sauce but otherwise followed the recipe.  Way too fatty and the prepared mustard is too sharp a taste to go with salmon.

I made this recipe as written. The flavor was good, but the mayo was too rich. The next time I make it, I will sub the mayo for yogurt, and make much less of the sauce as well.

This makes a ridiculous amount of sauce.  I made only half the amount of sauce, used 4 salmon fillets, and was still able to completely cover all the fillets in the sauce, and still have about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of sauce left over. Also, the cook time is way too much.  I only baked it for 20 minutes and it was still too much. The taste was alright.  I might or might not make this again.

Fantastic! I did what others suggested and used plain yogurt in conjunction with the mayo (2 parts yogurt, 1 part light mayo). Also, used both dijon and prepared mustard (as I had only a bit of both on hand!) and added a bit of brown sugar to the sauce. Rubbed the salmon with lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper. Amazing stuff! My two-year old LOVED it. I've never seen him eat so fast!

I didn't have fresh basil but I did use fresh dill, lots of it. I used salmon fillets and baked for 18 mins., 30 mins seems like a long time. Note that this makes a LOT of sauce! Was fine, we used the extra on our potatoes served on the side. Yummy!

My husband really loves it!  I agree with other posters, that it makes too much sauce--but we don't care, because we eat rice with the dish and that sauce tastes great on rice too!  (put the extra sauce in a casserole dish and bake it in the oven at the same time as the salmon)

My family raves about this dish. I make 1/2 - 3/4 of the recommended sauce ... the whole amount makes it feel like the salmon is swimming in sauce.

This is reqlly good. I didn't have any mayonaise, so took other reviewers advice and used 1 cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip. I mixed regular mustard and dijon as didn't have enough of either, (my frig is getting kinda bare.) Used all dry herbs and this was amazing! My husband wanted more sauce. I also microwaved this as it was too hot to use the oven. 7 mins on 60% was almost perfect, then swap the middle 1's to the outside for 2 more mins and you have it quick and easy.

Great recipe, I had leftover sauce and saved it to use on chicken later in the week. I used only 1/3 of the mayo and used plain yogurt for the other 2/3 (cause that's a lot of mayo) and it was great!

This was a nice and simple dish to create.  I agree with others that there was too much sauce to coat the fish with, so instead I coated the salmon with a thin layer and served the rest as a "dip".  I definitely will try this one again.

Way way WAY too much mayo. I used half and it was still too much. I would suggest 1/3 c of mayo and a heavy Tbs of mustard and then just brush on all sides of the fish. Definitely add garlic of some sort also, either fresh or powder.

If it is in a shell I loooove it! However fish,unless it is from Long John Slivers, Captian D's,fish sticks or breaded fillets from the store I just don't like it much. However,this is a  great recipe because I somewhat enjoyed the salmon. Anyone who loves fish will  adore this recipe!!!! I think I will try this with shrimp,crab,fish sticks and breaded fillets. The creamy dill is awesome seafood dip.

My family, who usually loves mustard and salmon, did not like the combination of this sauce.  Would not serve again.  The flavors just didn't blend.

Tried it with yogurt and little bit of mayo, but the mustard I used was too strong.  Will definitely try again.

I ranked this a 4 because the 1st time I prepared it per the recipe without modifications, we found the sauce/topping to be too heavy and mustardy.  It was a great start and I then followed other reviewers suggestions and sub'd the mayo with yogurt and cut down on the mustard to 1/3 cup.  This is definately a keeper and nice diversion from the basic salmon!

Very yummy! I used fat-free mayo, which tasted great on the fish, but even so didn't even use all of it (it made a lot for 4 filets of salmon). I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes, but it did turn out a bit dry. Next time I will either bake for less time or at a lower temp. Regardless, my 2-year-old son gobbled up an entire piece of fish, which is always this mommy's ultimate taste test! Will make again and share with my husband when he is home!

I am not a huge fish eater, but this was perfect.  The dijon sauce coated the salmon and complimented it very well.  We will definitely use again.  However, beware.  We had a lot of leftover sauce.  You might want to start by only making 1/2 the sauce recipe and then you can always make the other half if you feel you need more.

Great Recipe!  To reduce the calories & fat I used Greek yogurt in lieu of mayonnaise.  Addd 1 teaspoon of garlic powder for extra flavor.

This recipe was delicious! I substituted light mayo for regular to help lighten it some. I also used all freshherbs except the oregano, and used way more than the recipe called for because i wanted the herb taste to be strong. I served with asparagus and brown rice, and will definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend would not stop talking about this salmon!  He called all his ice fishing buddies so that they could use this recipe on the fish they caught over the weekend!  This recipe makes for a very easy way to impress your guests.  The sauce incorporates various spices and the dill sprinkled on top was like the icing on the cake!  I only needed about half of the mayo/mustard mixture for 2 pounds of fillets.

If I could take away stars and make it a minus 5 stars I would.  This recipe is nasty! This recipe totally wasted the salmon as no one in the family would eat it. We had to go out for fast food and the salmon got thrown away. I followed the recipe exactly.

I don't like mayo so I substituted plain 2% greek yogurt for all of the mayo for a low-fat, high-protein meal.  I ended up doubling the dill and adding a bit of extra mustard as well.  It came out pretty well but I didn't think it was anything amazing.  My wife loved it though.

It was a hit in my apartment!  I used a cup of yoghurt and a 1/2 cup mayo which tasted a little healthier and still worked well.  I would recommend cutting back on the mustard since it ended up being a whole lot of French's mustard for me.  BUT you could do half dijon, half yellow and be great!  I also mixed half the amount of dill into the mixture instead of putting it all on top.

It was alright taste wise, but it a little too thick and creamy for us,  would take the mayo down a notch or two next time, and maybe crunch up some crackers on top for a better texture! My 2 yr. old ate salmon though, so it's staying in my recipe box.

It was OK did not care too much for the mayo part. I do like this recipe as a last minute main dish but next time I will use yogurt or light sour cream.

I also think there is more topping than is needed for the amount of fish. It ran off the edge of the fish and burned to the pan. Great flavor. Will definitely make this one again!

Yes there is more topping than needed for the amount of fish so that needs to be cut back but the flavor is great as long as you don't slather too much on....great way to have salmon.

I would NOT recommend this recipe unless you LOVE yellow mustard as it tastes more like that than anything (and that was with using part dijon). Swapped out part of the mayo for yogurt as many suggested, put everything else as the recipe stated. After completely covering the almost 2 lbs of salmon I still had over 1/2 of the topping left, which ended up going down my sink.

My family couldn't get enough. To be honest we didn't have all the spices so I used a tablespoon of mrs dash and two teaspoons of the dill and a sprinkle of cayenne it was excellent and ready quick which is hard to beat when you work full time. It was a great way to cook that wild caught Alaskan Salmon.

I've made this the mayo way and the yogurt way, and the mayo way does taste better-- but it's definitely not as healthy.  This is a good recipe that is very fast.

I halved this recipe and it was still more than enough.  I also added in a little more dill, not just putting it on the top of the mixture, but in it as well.  I should have cooked the salmon for 12 mins instead of 15, it was a little dry on the edges. It's a definate keeper though!  I also didn't use fresh spices, I used dry and it was still pretty darn good.

Incredible sauce.  A definite keeper.  I used another reviewer's suggestion of subbing yogurt for the mayo.  Delicious.

Two small adjustments and this recipe recieved RAVE reviews by all!!!  Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. light organic sour cream.  Also only had stone ground mustard and used 2-3 TBSP.  The herbs are what REALLY made the salmon (fresh Alaskan red, by the way!) really shine!  Served with a cucumber/sour cream salad and fresh Minnesota sweet corn -- this meal was to die for!!  Thanks for yet another tasty way to enjoy our native salmon!

The salmon turned out moist and flaky. As others have said the recipe makes way too much sauce..and I'm a person who likes sauce! Did use 1/2 the mustard called for. Would make again.

I liked it and super easy for making my first Salmon ever. The only thing that I would change was adding a thinner layer of dill/mayo sauce. I just thought the fish to mayo ratio was a little off even though I made the recipe exactly. I did use FF mayo and thought it tasted fine.

I used cucumber dill mayo - mm mm mm! I agree, you can almost half the amount for the sauce and it would be much lighter and not overwhelm the salmon.

this was good but there was way too much sauce. i used light mayo and used as much mayo as mustard. even then i could have reduced the sauce by half. someone suggested leaving the sauce on the side and this is a good idea ... you can control how much you use.

Delicious! Some of the best salmon I've ever made. But the mayo really was a bit much... I like the suggestions of substituting at least some of the mayo with plain yogurt. I will definitely try that next time I make salmon.

Very good.  I made less sauce for the same portion of salmon and the coverage was good.  Served it with some lemon slices, steamed Asparagus seasoned with a little butter and lemon pepper and Basmati rice.  Husband and children ate it all and wanted more!  If the kids will eat it you know it is good!

Pretty good but next time I think I'd rather have the sauce be cool and work as a refined tarter for dipping instead of cooking it on top of the fish. Substituted fat free Greek yogurt for the mayo.

This was delicious.  Trying to make it healthier I used one cup of fat free yogurt and a half of cup of lite mayo all instead of the 1.5 cups of mayo.  I will definitely make this again.

After never being a salmon fan, this has totally changed my mind.  Like the others reviews, I cut the recipe in half and I switched the mayo to non fat plain yogourt with 1 tbls of lemon juice and 1/8th cup of dijon and leave the rest of the recipe as is and it just gives a very light flavor and it leaves the salmon moist, tender and melts in your mouth.  An excellent companion to this dish would be some potatoes, carrots and onions with a little garlic wrapped in tin foil and cooked on a bbq so that tht flavors melt together with a side salad or coleslaw.  It really is restaurant quality and would recommend everyone try this recipe!!!

A very tasty and quick recipe. This creamy dill thing on top is amazing! I only made 2 servings and had way too much mayo/mustard/etc. mix leftover, but I think maybe next time I'll just put more of it on the salmon. I don't know what to serve with this, though. Pasta, maybe? We stir-fried some vegetables with pesto, but it didn't go well together (the pesto made it sweet).

Very good flavor. It did make more than I needed, but you can scale it to your tastes. I took the advise of another user and replaced the mayo with plain, non-fat yogurt to greatly reduce the fat content. I added a squeeze of lemon to the yogurt to give it that tangy flavoring of real mayo. Other than that, I didn't change anything and it come out amazing! Great recipe, thanks!!!

I really liked this recipe. My gf and I, we both enjoy it a lot. The salmon was tender and flavorful. The spices accentuate the flavor of salmon and does not overwhelm the fish.   However, we have been making it with low fat yogurt instead of mayonnaise (as suggested by some reviewers). I whole heartedly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes salmon.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used the yogurt instead of the mayo and it turned out great. We served it wil steamed broccoli and the sauce was great on both. If you are eating low fat, the yogurt makes it better for you and you feel like you are indulging in a delicious sauce.

Easy and Great recipe. In New Zealand, Salmon is pricey. One does not want to ruin ones fish! This easy, simple sauce is perfect. My herbs were ALL fresh, so I altered accordingly. I used half the suggested amount of mustard. Also, I grilled the salmon, allowing some of the fish fat to drain. Served on a bed of cous cous, the easiest yummiest dinner this autumn! :-)

A very very good recipe. The sauce was a bit overpowering... I think if I make this again (which I will!) I think I may half the sauce. I did sprinkle the salmon with sea salt before applying the sauce. Very moist.

AWESOME! I have made salmon at home many times because my husband likes it, but I have never liked it and end up giving him my portion. I was skeptical, the sauce didn't sound very good. Proof is in the pudding, this was fantastic. There was extra sauce (and I cut it in half already), but so what.. it tasted wonderful. I did as some suggested and salted/peppered/garlic powdered the salmon filet before coating both sides.  I will be making this again!!

WAY too much mayo!!!!!  I like a little mayo on my fish, not a little fish under my mayo.  The flavor was good, and I will do it again, but I will make a whole lot less sauce.

Overall, this dish is tasty, however I wished I had heeded previous reviewers' advice and cut the sauce in half.  Even with 1/2 the sauce, there will still be plenty to dip your veggies in!  In addition, I think I will use a little less mustard.  While we are mustard fans, the mustard flavor was a little overpowering on the salmon.

I love salmon and make it at least once a week.  Per the suggestions, I used nonfat plain yogurt instead of mayo and about half of the mustard.  It was just SO much sauce.  Even after scraping it off, I still didn't like the flavor of the fish.

This salmon/sauce combo was great!  I even got my not-quite-three-year-old to take a couple bites and say, "It's yummy!" That's quite an accomplishment with the naturally strong flavor of salmon.  I would agree with those who said the original recipe is WAY too much sauce--I halved the mayo and the mustard, coated the fillets all the way around and still had a little sauce left over (which I think it will be great on a ham sandwich later in the week!).  I don't know what all the fuss is about with the mayo vs. yogurt, either; yes, yogurt is healthier, but I think in this case it's okay to splurge a little calorie-wise and go for the mayo like the recipe calls.  The final flavor makes it all the more worth it!

I have always asked my husband to cook the salmon (always great) this time I decided to be adventuris and tried it myself. I followed the recipe except had to use all dry ingredients. Next time I am going to try the recomendations for saving calories and use part yogurt and also use dijon. thanks

Very easy and tasty.  I cut back on the mayo, 1/3 cup per filet is plenty.  I also reduced cooking time by 5 minutes.  Came out great.

Easy, quick and very yummy! You definitely don't need that much mayo. I had tons left. You don't need to spread a lot of mayo on the salmon. If you want more, put it on the side. I used all dried herbs, eye-balled the amount of mustard and it turned out great. Next time, I will squeeze fresh lemon on the salmon before I top it will mayo. I just love lemon with salmon.  Thanks for sharing, this is definitely a keeper.

Good recipe. I grilled the salmon first allowing some of the oils to drain yet keeping it moist and made the sauce separately. Instead of using all that mayo, I integrated some sour cream with a little bit of mayo. I also mixed in a little bit of fat free cream cheese which gave it a creamy texture without a whole lot of calories. Added dill/thyme/garlic as usual.

I've eaten a lot of salmon in my life and this recipe was AMAZING! I left out the basil (because of an allergy) and used a spicy brown mustard and it was phenomenal. I saved the left over sauce to use on the fish (once cooked) and also some steamed broccoli. Great combination of flavors. Paired it with baked sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This was just OK. To be honest, it tasted a lot like deviled eggs - my DH agreed. WAY too much sauce - I halved it and there was still way too much. Don't think I'll be making again.

Yummy! I made this sauce for two smaller pieces of salmon and then tossed the rest with penne pasta and peas. It was delicious! I loved the flavor on my fish. The only things I did different were, I ran out of mayo so I added some creamy horseradish sauce, I used Deli-style mustard because that's all we had, and I didn't use thyme because I didn't have any. I still loved the recipe and hubby wants me to make it again :)

It was a good recipe. I thought that I had cut down on the sauce, but I still had about half of the sauce left over after all the salmon was eaten. I'm going to use the leftovers with chicken, which I am sure will be good. I substituted for the mayo a third part mayo, a third part nonfat plain yogurt, and a third part sour cream. I added some other Italian seasoning and put lemon juice on my fillets before covering with the sauce. It turned out well.

Excellent recipe.  For those of you that added honey to the recipe, try vanilla yogurt instead of the plain. It is delightful.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved it!  I added parmesan cheese and bit of lemon juice (I don't like fishyness).  I also used all fresh herbs. I lay down slices of potato before laying the fillets on top and topping off with the sauce.

I am not a fish person at all.  I loved it.
I did reduce the mayo to about  1 1/2 tablespoons and just a little less with the stoned ground mustard that I used.  No waste with the sauce and it was perfect for one large fillet.  Used all the ingredients the recipe called for and added nothing else.  Perfect!!  I am very sure that my family will enjoy this, they like fish.  ;)

Okay, I loved this but cut back on the sauce. I still used full fat mayo but didn't use as much. Also didn't need to bake as long. (for the cut of salmon I had) Enjoy.

AWESOME Taste!  Husband said we should keep it for the future.  I didn't have any fresh herbs and substituted dried.  It was still very good and I am sure it would have been better with the fresh ones!  
  I gave it 4 stars because the recipe made ALOT more sauce than needed.  I had to throw out 1/3 of the sauce mixture because it was so much.  I hate to waste.

Good recipe! The mustard flavor was really strong, but then again I used a stronger mustard that was supposedly more "gourmet." This is one recipe where the cheaper, milder stuff is probably actually better. This was my first time making any kind of fish, and it turned out great!

This was pretty good. Both me and my husband liked, except I did use some other user's suggestions and cut back on the mayo. Next time I think I might try plain yogurt instead of mayo.

Like Brittany Joy, I substituted yogurt for the mayo.  Major hit with my wife.  Loved it!

My boyfriend actually ate this!  He always tells me that he hates seafood and can't stand the smell.  When I made this, he came home and declared that whatever I was cooking smelled delicious.  He was skeptical of the fish, but ended up eating a huge portion.  Success!  The only thing I changed was using fat-free yogurt instead of mayo.

Delicious! I used low fat yoghurt  instead of mayo(I can imagine mayonnaise might be too rich).

This salmon was excellent!  Rather than use yogourt, as some have done, I used fat-free mayonnaise, and whole-grain Dijon mustard.  I also used only dried herbs, as that was all I had on hand, the result was still great!

I use this recipe every time I make salmon.  I cut the recipe in half and I tend to use dijon mustard when I make this, but regular yellow mustard is tasty as well.  Delicious!

This recipe also works well with a substitution of 1c No fat Sour Cream, and either 1/2 c of low fat plain yogourt OR 1/2 c low fat mayo.  The sour cream gives it a better tang that doesnt make it come out as sweet as using all yogourt

Excellent.  I also use plain yogurt plus 1/4 cup reduced fat mayo.  No compromise on the taste though.  Kids love it too.

I loved this recipe. I used dijon mustard that was a bit spicy and added some extra mayo to tone it down a bit. I also used extra dill, which was great. My only comment is that it is not good left over because the sauce on top congeals. The good news is that it is so delicious you can eat the whole thing! I will definitely make it again.

Really very tasty.  I adjusted the recipe to use honey mustard instead of the standard kind, and just a little bit of spicy brown.  I was very impressed with how simple this preparation was for the taste that came out on the other side.

This fish was a nice change from my normal plain salmon.  It was a little greasy.  I will try it again with the yogurt substitute another reviewer had recommended. I enjoyed the taste of the herbs.  I also agree to reduce the amount of mayo mixture.  All of that mixture was unnecessary.  My seven year old son enjoyed this dish as well.

This was so easy to make and comes out perfectly every time!  I just made it for my first dinner party and everyone loved it.

Healthy tip: I used soy "mayo" instead of real mayo and no one knew.  All plates were wiped clean!

we loved this - it's my new favorite salmon recipe - although I did quarter the sauce and still had too much and had to throw extra away.  Followed recipe as-is, cooked 20 mins - wonderful flavor that complements the fish.

The creamy dill sauce keeps the salmon lovely and moist!  It is perfection!

This was my first time making salmon.  It turned out pretty good.  I didn't need all of the mayo topping and used the reserve for dipping as others suggested.  I think mayo on fish is really good, but I will try other ways to prepare salmon.  Thanks for the easy fast recipe!

This was a great salmon recipe....moist, tasty, and good.  I made about 3/4ths the recipe and still had too much sauce!  I added a little sugar and some parmesan cheese.  I will make this one again!

Tried this recipe last night.  I usually do not like salmon but this recipe was delicious.  I did cut down on the mayo mixture and it was perfect. We have salmon in our freezer from Alaska and this recipe is a keeper.

My whole family loved it!! Kids ate it cold the next day. I made a big 3 pound fillet, and there was still left over sauce, even after using it for dipping. This was delicious!

Was much better on the thicker Salmon Fillets. Next time I'll try grilling the Salmon and putting the creamy dill on toward the end! Hard to improve on a 5 star rating!!

Unexpectedly, we had no gas for the grill, so I couldn't do the salmon the way I always do, so I found this recipe.  YUMMMMM!!  This was INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!  I 'eyeballed' the sauce because all the other reviews said it made too much.  I put 2/3s of the sauce on the fish as it cooked and saved 1/3 for a dipping sauce.  My husband loved it too and said this will be our 'winter salmon recipe'.  Thank you so much!  Delish!!

I thought this was very tasty... although it is a very rich sauce, very high in fat.  I find that salmon does not need a lot of additional fats (butter or mayo).

This was a delicious recipe.  All of my children loved it (even my 4 y.o. that has never liked fish before)  Definatly need to cut the sauce in 1/2 maybe 1/3.

Very tasty. I made a small amount of the sauce mixture because I was only cooking two fillets. Turned out great. My husband enjoyed this meal and so did I. Thank you for sharing.

Loved this.  I doubled the dill and the basil and only used 1 cup of mayo.  I also ended up with too much sauce, even after a liberal coating all around the salmon and using double the salmon.  And my sauce didn't turn to liquid as some have said, although I used a pan that could drain, not a cookie sheet....

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Will most definately make it again.  I did cut sauce recipe in half and only had a little left over, I also grated lemon peel onto the salmon before spooning sauce on the filets and I thought this was a great addition, got a little citrus taste but not over powering.

I thought it was pretty tasty for as simple as it was to make.  Unfortunately the rest of the family did not like.

Definitely made tons of sauce. I put about 2 tablespoons on each piece of fish and it was perfect.  We used the extra sauce to dip steamed vegetables in and still had tons to throw out.

Made this dish last night - very good!  I may have put a little too much on the salmon, though, it overpowered the fish. I used light mayo to lower the fat and it was great!

One of the most delicious salmon dishes I have ever made.  I stuck to the recipe and used the leftover sauce as a pasta sauce the next day for lunch.

Pretty good. It did make way too much sauce. I'll probably make it again sometime. I did like the flavors.
