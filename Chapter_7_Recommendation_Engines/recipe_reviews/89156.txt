Very good, easy to prepare. What I like about it is that you can add ings. to suit the company or family taste. I added onion and some "rooms" and sprinkled with a bit of shredded cheese at serving time. I often make this for a dinner in the evening as we like "breakfast food" anytime of the day, especially in colder months.

This is a hit in my house. I cook the potatoes first, seasoning them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and chili powder. I remove them from the pan to cook the sausage. Then I throw them back in and warm everything up together before I add the eggs. Right at the end I stirred in shredded cheddar cheese, then topped it with some shredded parmesan. The leftovers usually don't last long.

I cut this recipe in half. I did not use Bob Evans brand sausage or diced potatoes, it was whatever brand I had. (I had a random half roll of breakfast sausage in my freezer and a half empty package of frozen hash brown potatoes in my freezer tp use so this recipe was perfect). I used red pepper instead of green (we don't care for green) and I threw in some chopped sweet onion and fresh minced garlic. I did cook this in my cast iron skillet--I browned the sausage first, drained off the fat, then threw in the chopped vegetables and frozen potatoes with a big pat of butter. My husband and kids used this as a filling for breakfast burritos, topping with shredded cheese, reduced fat sour cream and homemade salsa. Very quick and hearty breakfast.

Easy and filling!  
I cubed 3 potatoes and cooked them in the skillet for 10 minutes.  I removed the cooked potatoes while I cooked the sausage and green pepper.  Once the meat was cooked I added the potatoes back to the skillet.  Then I moved the meat and veggie mixture to the side to cook the eggs.  Mix it all together once eggs are scrambled.  Top each serving with cheese.  Was great heated up the next day too!

There is nothing more that I like than having breakfast for dinner! This recipe was quick, easy, and tasty, and an added bonus was that my two year old ate it. I forgot to buy the frozen potatoes so I just chopped up two medium size potatoes and cooked them in a skillet before I added the sausage to soften them up a bit. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Make this all the time - kids love it.  Omitted the green pepper this time and added in turkey bacon.  I also try and use turkey sausage when I have it.  This is a quick, easy, delicious breakfast dish.

This was great, I used red rose potatoes with the skin on, cut them into cubes, put on a microwave plate and microwaved them to start the cooking process, I have found that this precooking helps them to cook all the way to the middle. I added the microwaved potatoes to the skillet with just a small amount of cooking oil, seasoned them and finished cooking them, I removed them and cooked some onion, green peppers and spicy sausage, pushed that to the side as one reader suggested,scrambled eggs (I only did 7 eggs and less milk) Then I added back in the potatoes and mixed it all together, added a few dashes of rooster sauce as well!
Its yummy and I made it for dinner, it makes a lot so depending on the size of your family you may have left overs like we did.

i used fresh potatoes and added onion since i didnt have the packaged ones and we like onions. i drained my sausage and potatoes a little bit before i added the eggs. i think 1/2 cup milk was a little much for me getting a hard set scrambled egg. after cooking it i added rooster sauce, salt and pepper too. its a good base recipe with some tweaking.

This turned out very good!  It was simple..few steps...and very quick to make.  I used the spicy ground sausage - and cooked with potatoes as mentioned...just need to drain grease before adding eggs. Cheese matter of taste - just fancy shredded Sharp Cheddar over here. Since the spicy seemed to dissipate during cooking, I topped with a few good dashes of Tabasco - can't add heat seasoning as my ltlman is a wimp like his dad! hahahaha 

Thank you so much for this recipe, it was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!!! We WILL be making it again!

Yummy. Did the potatoes myself and seasoned them with salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder. Removed them while I cooked the sausage and then added everything back in (no peppers). Cheddar cheese mixed in and some parm sprinkled on top. Hubby and I both smacked our lips!

Very good, could spice up to taste just a little but very easy recipe to follow, i jused hash browns instead of diced potatoes, but seemed to work just fine.

Yum! I threw a few slices of cheese on top of this and it was so good! I found some jalapeno sausage at my grocery store and that gave it additional flavor.

This was good!I read some reviews and did what they did.I made homemade potatoes-fried them first put them aside.Fried up all my peppers(red,orange,green and yellow) with onions and then a batch of breakfast sausages.Once they were done I put them aside and cooked up my scrambled eggs.Then I added them all together and it turned out really good!!I added garlic powder,seasoning salt while it cooked altogether...Another keeper!!
