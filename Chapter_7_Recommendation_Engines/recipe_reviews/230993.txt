These wings are fabulous but I recommend cutting way back on the cooking time.  I do one hour in the crock pot on high and one hour on low then put them in the oven for 30 minutes.  Friends tell me they are the best wings they have ever eaten!

This recipe is so easy and very tasty! The wings have a nice crust to them yet the meat falls off the bone.  I used drumettes instead of chicken wing pieces and baked them slightly lower at 350 degrees. I opted to omit the final coating of hot sauce and had it on the table for use instead. This was a winner - not a single wing left!

After reading most of the reviews I made the following alterations to the recipe for an amazingly easy and delicious chicken wing:
1. Ingredients: Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce, low sodium Worcestershire Sauce, unsalted butter and arrowroot
2.  Cook time in slow cooker: 1 hr on high, 1 hr on low
3. After cooking complete: use slotted spoon to remove wings from slow cooker. Drain the sauce off the wings
4.  Baking pans: lined with parchment paper (easy clean-up)
5. Cook time in oven: @400 for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Watch closely or you will burn them at this temp but worth it. The are wonderfully crispy!
6. Dipping Sauce: simmer juices from slow cooker thickened with arrowroot in sauce pan on stove

Results: Fantastic!!  This is the keeper recipe for wings. We like our wings extra crispy but juicy on the inside and this recipe delivers, with the above listed modifications. Family members said, no need to eat wings out anymore. Next time we are going to add garlic and grated parmesan to the cooking sauce.  This is so easy.

Really tasty recipe. One hour on High in the slow cooker. Then one hour on low. Baked in the oven at 350 degrees for a half hour. Delicious.

Wings were super yummy. My husband and I LOVE hot hot wings so we doubled on Franks hot buffalo sauce in crock pot and added a little red pepper. My husband was sweating while devouring these on Sunday. 

Like others said reduce crock pot cooking time because the wings fall off the bone. To keep a crisp wing I pulled them out after 3 hrs on high then broiled them for 5 minutes on both sides to get a crisp wing. Mmmmm delicious!! 

Thanks for sharing

We followed this recipe to the tee!  Even bought the Franks Red Hot Pepper Sauce.  Too salty!  The other disappointment was the meat falling off the bone in the slow cooker so by the time it got out of the oven it was... well you can imagine.

This was easy and pretty tasty.  I found they browned up nicely if you follow the instructions and bake at 400 for 30 min.  I made as directed except I did one hour on high, then one hour on low as many suggested.  I also dunked them back in the slow cooker sauce about halfway through the oven cycle.

Love the recipe. We like a little sweet taste (this is just a little sweetness).  I use 1 cup orange juice or 1 can (12 oz) Guava juice,  1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey (you my substitute maple syrup).  Just mix together and pour over the wings after they have cooked on high in the slow cooker for one hour. Then finish cooking on low for an additional 4 hours. Wings will not be crispy.  If you want crispy wing put on a cookie sheet and bake 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until desired crispness .

These wings were such a hit at The Superbowl Party! I did some modifications that may be helpful for you.... Cook time was MUCH different. 45 minutes on slow 45 minutes on high in the slow cooker, and 30 minutes in the oven at 475. I even broiled them the last few minutes. I also used much less Worcester Sauce (about 3/4 bottle), and added some cayenne pepper just to make them super spicy. In addition I used different spices. Marjoram and Oregano and that's it. I was told they were the perfect consistency! Crunchy on the outside moist on the inside.

Great recipe, but one *IMPORTANT NOTE* - thickening the sauce you apply at the end (especially if you use a salty hot sauce like Frank's Red Hot) is NOT a good idea. As other people point out, after reducing the sauce (evaporating the moisture in it) it becomes very very salty, and depending on how much you thicken it, the wings will end up inedible because the balance of flavors is wrong (Franks is not meant to be thickened). If you'd like to thicken the sauce, use a much less salty hot sauce and it will turn out better. Otherwise, thicken the sauce minimally or not at all.

This is a good base recipe. I did one hr on high, one on low, then broiled 5 min per side. Awesome. I did omit oregano and added lemon pepper (our fav). In the crock pot I put half a stick of butter and only 2 cups of sauce. My new favorite! Next time I am going to try hot terriyaki!

Like others, I reduced the cooking time - one hour on high, one hour on low, and then baked off in the oven.   Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I liked these wings; however, these never crisped up in the oven.  Also, there is not really any way for the sauce to adhere to the wings.  Next time, I might try broiling the wings at the end, to get a crispier exterior.  They certainly don't need more "cook time" at that point, and a quick broil might serve that purpose.

This recipe was by far the best of the best for buffalo wings!! When my fiance tried them before the guests came, he screamed at me asking what was in the sauce and to never make any kind of wing recipe except this one again. I am very impressed with them! So much better than any restaurant I've tried especially since they fall off the bone when eating them. Definitely using this recipe again and again, thanks!

I found the wings to be bland and falling off the bone.  They're more like baked wings instead of Buffalo wings.  I don't think I'll ever try them again.  I nor any of my friends liked them.

Made this for an appetizer on thanksgiving and they were gone in 5 minutes! My mom said they were better than any wing shop she's been to (which is a lot)! My family has been bugging me to make them for dinner every week now!

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times with the following changes: Crystal hot sauce instead of Frank's (I substituted Crystal originally and when I tried to use Frank's later it was almost inedibly salty, so I always use Crystal), crockpot cook time of 2 hours on medium.  I use a mix of chicken wings, thighs, and legs and serve it for dinner with basmati rice and roasted broccolini; everyone loves it!  My kids, husband, mom, and guests.  The chicken is crispy and the buttery sauce is delicious for dipping the chicken and for seasoning the basmati.  Thanks to the creator of this recipe for coming up with a staple menu item in our home!

The sauce was good.  It was spicy.  I cooked it in the crock pot and then in the oven.  They didn't crisp up but were still good.  There was plenty of sauce, so no need for the extra bottle of hot sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and i gree with several other reviewers.  Cut back on the cooking time. Wings were falling apart in the slow cooker. The taste was there, but they were a mess.

Delicious! After reading others' reviews, I too decided to do one hour on high and one on low in the crock pot. I then cooked it in a 350° oven for 20 mins and then broiled for 5 mins each side. I used the sauce from the crock pot and dunked the wings in at the end. My husband has been raving about them. They had only a slight crispness to them, but then the meat fell off the bone in your mouth. They were amazing!

These are the best slow cooker wings that I've found so far.  I really like a classic wing, butter, Frank's, and some spices, and so this fit the bill.  Three notes:
1) I think the cooking time is way off.  Having made wings in the slow cooker before, I ignored it and did 3.5 hours on low using fresh wings.  
2) They were way too salty.  I will use unsalted butter next time.  I questioned using salted butter but did it anyway since the recipe did not specify, and did not call for additional salt.  The saltiness really took away from them, but I only docked the recipe a star because I think this would taste fantastic with unsalted butter. 
3) I think a half hour on 400 was too long to be in the oven.  The oven portion is just to brown them.  I think next time, I'd opt for longer time in the slow cooker (probably around 4 hours on low), and then just a few minutes in the broiler to brown them up.  They were good, but I felt like I could have accomplished the same thing with less juiciness-robbing oven time.

Such a great recipe! Our friends ask us to make it all the time for football watching parties! We actually don't thaw the wings beforehand. We put them frozen right into the crockpot and then cook on high for 4 hours instead of high on 2 and low on 2.

We made these for our Super Bowl party and they were a huge hit.  I cut back on cooking time as others recommended (I did 90 min on high and 30 min on low).  The chicken was a good consistency, and to my surprise, got pretty crispy in the oven.  They weren’t as saucy as I normally like, so I added some sauce at the end.  Very easy and tasty recipe.

My youngest of 7 daughters loves, loves wings.  Although she prefers breaded, I made these using the kick butt comments to do 1hr/high - 1hr/low in slow cooker, then put on grill until skin got crispy.  Took the juices from slow cooker recipe and cooked down to an incredibly awesome sauce by adding brown sugar, starch and a bit more garlic and a tiny bit of vinegar.  Yes! Yes! Better than good. :)

The first time I made this, the cooking time was too long and the chicken fell off the bone. Not good for wings. I cooked the wings on low for about three hours, then I baked it for 30 minutes at 350. I took the wings out of the oven with 10 minutes remaining, and brushed them with the sauce from the crock pot. These modifications greatly improved the recipe, and I would recommend that everyone cut the cooking time.

I just tried this recipe this past Sunday.  I followed the advice of Kristin and cut the cook time in half.  I also changed the brush on sauce a little.  I added a little more garlic.  I also wanted this sauce thicker so it would stick to the wings.  I added a little cornstarch and cold water to thicken it up.  These wings were awesome!  Everyone loves them!

This will definitely be the way I make all my buffalo wings in the future.  I took the suggestion made by others to slow cook on high for 1 hour followed by low for 1 hour.  While baking at 400 for 30 minutes, I turned them after 15 minutes.  I also basted them with the sauce that was still in the slow cooker.  Turned out great.  Taste delicious.  Meet falls of the bone.  They crisp up nice due to the baking.

Easy to make and tasty. I did about 3 hrs in the crock pot since i used frozen, not thawed wings. I also cooked the sauce with fresh diced onions, and used a garlic Italian blend instead of all the individual spices. They came out good, but not as spicy as i wanted, so next time I'll add a few extra items to make it spicier, like maybe a diced habanero.

The best recipe I've ever made. I've eaten chicken wings at quite a few places and never dared to make it at home. My husband said it was the best chicken wings he has ever eaten. 
I did however change a few things. 
1. I browned the chicken wings on an cast iron or skillet or pan. Before I placed it in the slow cooker. 
2. I followed the advice given by others. 1 hour and 15 mins on High, and 45 minutes on low. 
3. Then I took the wings out, and placed them on a baking sheet and baked in my (preheated) oven. I have an electric fan oven with broil option on top. I turned on the fan + broil and on the recommended temp, and it turned out super crispy in 15 mins. Keep an eye on the wings while in the oven. 
4. SAUCE CHANGE: I used a half buffalo sauce and half sweet baby rays sweet & spicy sauce. It gives a different kick if you do not like pure buffalo wing sauce. 
AMAZING

I followed the recipe, but only cooked 2 hours in the crockpot like most suggested. Put them in the oven at 375 because my oven runs cool. After 20 minutes, no change, then 40 minutes. They never got crispy, but fell off the bone. The spice was too hot for most of my guests.

I made these for super bowl and they came out great. I'm seeing some complaints on here that the wings were falling apart I cooked mine frozen and that seemed to help. If you're cooking your wings thawed try reducing the cook time. These were a major hit and will make them again for sure

I made my own sauce which is a mixture of this one with added honey, brown sugar, onion, & garlic as my husband loves a sweeter sauce.  Amazing!  One of our new favorites!  We'll double the recipe next time. We also use the sauce in the crock pot rather than make a second batch.  There was more than enough.  I even froze some.  I would suggest only cutting the time down in the crock pot if the wings are small.  We did 2 hours high and 2 hours low and the meat did not fall off of the bone.  You can extend the time and cook only on slow as well.  I love how the flavors went through and through the meat.  Yummy!

These were sooo good. Do yourself a favor and don't eat all of them the first day -- they were even better straight out of the fridge the next morning (yes, so good I had them for breakfast). I used completely frozen drumsticks in the crockpot on low for 8 hours (then baked, per directions)....they did not fall apart at all, they were perfect. Thank you!!

Very simple, great flavor.  I agree with some of the other comments, I think you could cut back on the total time spent in the crock pot.  Next time I make them, I will let them go for 1 hour on high, another hour on low, and then finish them in the oven.

This recipe was good but the 4 men at my house didn't give it rave reviews nor did they desire for me to make it again. Mine didnt crisp up even after baking in the oven. While the flavor was good, the outcome was not the texture my guys like in their wings.  I liked how easy these wings were to prepare with minimal cooking mess.

Love how the meat falls right off the bone.  Easiest wings I ever ate. I felt the meat was a little dry, but I defrosted the wings quick so it may be my fault.  We'll see next time.

So delicious!!  Such a great recipe. Followed directions to the letter.   I will cut down on crockpot cooking time by one hour as they were almost falling apart when I removed them to place on the baking sheets to crisp up. I chose to serve it as a dinner meal with Jasmine rice and fresh tossed salad with homemade ranch dressing - just in case we want to “dip” the wings :-)Will def make again.

I made these exactly like the recipe and they were delicious! I like a little crunch on the tip of the wing, so it was perfect for me. otherwise, I would just say take them out of the oven sooner. I made them for a Superbowl party and they went faster than everything else! They were a little too spicy for my 7 year old, but my husband asked for me to make them AGAIN, and Superbowl was 2 days ago

I took the advice and cooked 1 hour on high and 1 hour on low and then the oven for 30 minutes. But i added a twist: i have an air fryer and put it on 400 for 5 minutes and instead of brushing the sauce on, I put sauce in bowl and tossed the wings in the sauce like the wing places do.

I took Kristin's suggestion and did these 1 hour on low 1 hour on high and then baked.  They turn out perfectly and this has been my go to wing recipe for over a year now.  We make them on all of the holidays and Super Bowl.

I don't do wings as they are too fatty. I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs and two boneless breasts. As they were frozen, I threw them in the crockpot on high with the sauce for 4 hours. I removed them and cut them into bite size pieces. Having them now with a slad. Buffalo chicken salad. Yum!

In my 35 years of cooking, I didn't believe it was possible to dry out chicken wings but this recipe has dislodged me of that belief. The cooking time on this recipe is far too long. I've read some suggestions from other members about cooking time in the slow cooker as well as in the oven. The suggestions sound quite plausible, but if you have to make that many adjustments to a recipe you're better off finding another recipe. That's what I plan to do. If you insist on making this recipe, I strongly advise you to cut the cooking time in the slow cooker by half and finish off the wings in the broiler instead of baking.

These were perfectly fine chicken wings; however, you do not achieve a nice crunch even after baking in the oven for 30 minutes.  Additionally, you can not taste any of the added spices, so you might as well just use the hot sauce and forget the spices.   My family prefers the cooking method in "Crispy Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings" (from this site), which uses baking powder to achieve a wonderful crunch. You can then flavor the wings any way you like. Oh, and I followed another reviewer who cooked the wings on low 1 hr and high 1 hr, then baked 30 minutes.  This was just the right amount of cooking, as the wings held together nicely.  Not sure whether I will try this recipe again.

This recipe was amazing!!! I enjoy my wings on the smaller side so I will need to adjust to less time in the crockpot next time because some of the wings were falling off the bone. Wonderfully tasteful alternative to fried wings.

Will make again, but cut down on cooking time in slow cooker AND in oven.   Very good taste, but too much cooking time made the meat dry.

The meat falls off the bone and gets soggy if you cook too long.  Recommend cutting back on the cook time.  Also, use Texas Pete -- it's closer to the real deal if you want more authentic Buffalo wings.

I used a mixture of Franks hot sauce and some Habanero sauce and it was tasty and made my mouth numb , too !  Unfortunately the Eagles won , but they won't win it again for another half century .  Pluse they have to pay for a tour of the White House instead of meeting the President of the United States there .

This was the best homemade wings I've ever eaten.  Yes, I did change the recipe a little .  Instead of using the hot sauce, I substituted sweet and zesty bar-b-que sauce.  It was just zesty enough for me.  I made blue cheese dressing to dip the wings in and it was great.   Yes, I am sure I will make these wings again.

Not so great.

I make chicken wings a lot.  When I came across this recipe ant it's rave reviews I had to try it.  So today, I made it for Sunday football. Of the 5 ways I've now made chicken wings I'm here to say that this is the 5th best way I know of to make chicken wings.  The wings were ok, not crispy but not soggy either - kind of chewy skin actually.  What they were not, at least for me, was worth the effort.  I thought the sauce combination was pretty good but one certainly doesn't need so much time effort to enjoy the sauce recipe.   At a minimum, this is a 3 hour project including prep and clean up.  Compare that to 15 to 20 minutes in a deep fryer, 25 to 35 minutes in an air fryer, 30 minutes on a grill or 45 minutes in an oven.  A deep fryer produces the tastiest and fastest results and mostly has close to zero additional clean up - just keep the oil 'til next time.  Save yourself 3 hours - buy a deep fryer that will hold 25 wings or so.

Tried the one hour on high, one hour on low, then in the oven. Note: don't include any sauce in the oven pan because that will just make the chicken too wet. Plus it didn't seem like any of it was staying on the food. Therefore, I didn't get the crispiness I was hoping for.

I reduced the times as per Kristin’s review and the wings were perfect, and the meat fell off the bone. Best home made wings I’ve had.

It was great my family loves them. The sauce is too hot for some so I tried Sweet Baby Rays Original sauce, but I am looking for a Thai sauce. I think a Thai sauce would be perfect a little sweet a little sticky, but very flavorful. But the recommended sauce works well for those that love their sauce hot. I am a wing lover.

Cooked for 2 hrs on high, and 1 hour  on low, and that was plenty!  While wings were in oven, I discarded about half of the cooking liquid and added 6oz of Franks to the remaining.  Added a little cornstarch slurry and cooked on high until slightly thickened.  The spice level was perfect. After about 10 min in oven, the bottoms were browned (that was the best bite!) so I dunked in the thickened sauce and baked for another 10 min.  We like spicy food, so we brushed a little extra sauce on them before eating.  Next time I will brown on all sides in oven, then submerge.

Pretty good. They came out pretty salty. I might look at a way to reduce that if I make it again. They did fall right off the bone when they were done cooking though. ...and sometimes fell apart when transferring to the cookie sheet. I may have cooked for an extra 20 mins on high though so take it with a grain of salt.

My boyfriend liked them a lot-not as spicy as you would think.  So give them a try!  :)

These were awesome tasting, but not so much as wings, ended up pulling all the meat off the bones leaving it in my crock-pot and making sliders out of them

These were ok.  I took others advice and did one hour high then one hour low in the crock pot.  The meat was tender but barely held together.  Meat fell off as I was transferring to baking sheet.  Also, if you like crispy skin make sure you bake at 400.  I did 350 based on other reviews and the skin was too soggy for my liking.

I agree with other reviewers that you definitely want to cut the cooking time in half. and finish them in the broiler.  Otherwise, they will get overcooked and fall off the bone and  you will have shredded chicken filling for chicken tacos.  I placed them in the broiler for 15 minutes then rebrushed them with hot buffalo sauce and they turned out pretty good.  I think deep fried wings would be more true to restaurant style, but these are healthier.

I made this in the crockpot and it was so delicious for faster cooking time I cooked over the stove in a pot then put in the oven. It was ready in hour and a half came out just as tasty and my kids love love these wings!

I followed the recipe to the "T".  They were awesome,  but WARNING: THEY ARE HOT!!!  Actually too hot for my family and that's why I gave them a 4 star vs a 5 star.  But it you like it hot, these are awesome.  Meat just fell away from the bone.  Excellent!

When I said I was making slow cooker wings, I got a  grimace and "they will be so dry!".  So I altered it by baking it in the sauce for an hour, then moved them to another pan, brushed them with more hot sauce and butter mixture, and broiled them until browned, and a final  flip for another 15 minutes of browning.  Simple, easy, and they were given thumbs up approval.  Next time, I think I might have to play around with some different spice combinations.  But, the recipe as is, works well on its own merits.

Only giving this one a 1 because It won't accept 0. Won't try this one again. Wings were soft and dry. Should be crispy and moist.

I made this with 5-1/2 lbs of wings. Cooked on hi for 1-3/4 hrs and then on low for 1-1/2 hrs. We only added 1/2 can of beer to pre sauce.  5 of enjoyed them and will definitely make again

This was very good recipe, but as everybody else I did make some modifications. I put in oven after done in crock pot and put the oven on broil so the wings would crisp up. Then instead of Franks again I basted the wings with sweet baby rays, then back in and they got done and Plus in gives you spicy and sweet.

I  followed the other reviewers suggestions by cooking on high for two hours because I was in a hurry,  took the sauce that was in the crockpot and thickened.  . Then I put it in the oven for 20 minutes on each side at 400° to brown up and brushed the sauce over the wings

Easy Peasy...and Delish.  I skipped the last step and thickened the sauce the wings cooked in.  Then spread that over the wings.  Were a hit.  Thank you for sharing.

These came out perfect! I did not slather on the hot sauce after the wings came out of the oven, as we wanted them crispy. These are darn good wings, and this is my new go-to recipe.

I did exactly what the recipe called for and my wings are actually very dry and chewy - so the slow cooker over-cooked them!  Maybe just the 2 hours on high would've been enough.

I just dumped the ingredients straight into the slower cooker. To lighten it up I used a generous drizzle of olive oil instead of butter. Didn't have worchestire so I skipped that too. Instead of drenching it with more butter before putting it in the oven I used a little of the extra juice in the crock pot. This is my husbands favorite! I'm sure it's even better with butter.

My husband is a Buffalo Chicken Wing nut! He loved these! The only change I made was after cooking 1 hour on high I poured out the juices and then added the buffalo sauce and cooked it 2 hours on low. I served it with this ranch. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16131/ranch-dressing-ii/?internalSource=staff%20pick&referringId=2596&referringContentType=recipe%20hub

The leftovers are great too!

I followed the 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low. A lot of people say they cut it down but I think it depends on how big the wings are. The first time I made them I had smaller wings and cut the time down a bit but the second time was perfect with the time. My husband loves these because you can suck the meat right off the bone! They're so delicious!

Loved how the meat absorbed the flavor!
I made 4 types of wings for Superbowl and being able to set it and forget it made time for the other stuff I was making.  I did not make the extra sauce to coat them in after cooking since I only had 1 bottle of hot sauce but they didn't need it because every little piece had the flavor cooked in.  In the future I will probably cut the cooking time a bit, the meat was falling off the bones and small bits of bone were mixed in the meat.

These were great. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Cut the slow cooker time in half. I reused the liquid from the slow cooker and boiled it down to pour over the wings after baking.

Love it added another spice to make it more spicy and used drumsticks instead and it only took 2 hours all together. I have a nesco witch has high temp for cooking so it didn't take long so the first hour 15 min in the nesco then the rest in oven at 350. It was really spicy but that's how I like it I added a spice called garlic sriracha seasoning by weber then some chili powder. 1 TBS each or more depending on the spiceyness you want I added like 2 each then sprinkled the sriracha on top afterwards.

Made these wings for the first time for a dinner party last night.  They turned out fantastic!  Cooking the wings in the crockpot really helped the wings become tender.
I followed the recipe as is, but next time would add more kick to it.

I am extremely picky when it comes to bone in wings. I have to say these were wonderful! I will definitely make these again :-)

I have made these over and over and my  boyfriend and friends love them!! I also greatly reduce the cooking time. I cook  them for 2 hours in the slow cooker on low and for 1/2 hour in the oven at 350.

Maybe my slow cooker is off. Wings turned to mush after four hours. I'd reduce slow cook time in half and finish on grill or skillet

The sauce is amazing but a little runny, so here is what I do, there is plenty of sauce so I get two 4 lb bags of the chicken wing drummettes make sure they are not frozen before putting them in crockpot, I use paper bowl to get any moisture off wings, cook on high for 2 hours foil and spray cookie sheet bake at 400 for 30 minutes I thicken up the sauce with a little cornstarch and water add the wings and absolutely delicious.

I cut down on the cooking time as directed in other comments. I also added more spice. The flavor was good but it was a big mess in the crock pot. None of the wings stayed together.

The kids loved these for the final step after broiler I used BBQ on half and the franks sauce on the other half.  They tasted great the only problem was only 1 crockpot full.

I was excited to try this recipe and given the reviews thought it would be great. The texture of the chicken was not right. I think it's the crockpot that does this. It makes it rubbery...

I brought frozen 3lbs bag jumbo chicken wings from Aldi store.  It was so EASY to make, very tasty tender.  The wings have a nice crust to them. Next time I will cook one hour in slow cooker and then put in the oven bake for 30 mins.. it's GONE in 5 minutes.  Next time, I'll get 2 3 lbs bags, total 6lbs.
