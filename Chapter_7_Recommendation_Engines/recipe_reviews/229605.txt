YUUMMMMMEEEEEE! I followed it exactly as written with one minor substitution. The taste and texture is wonderful, never picked up a knife because they were still tender. I did use thinner breasts, not too thick. I didn't have fresh basil so I used about a 1/2 inch squeeze of basil puree from a bottle. (usually right next to the fresh herbs in the supermarket) I spread it on the breasts right before adding the mozzarella and tomatoes. Make sure you use FRESH mozzarella people! MY 14 y.o. daughter, who doesn't like fresh tomatoes, gobbled it up and asked if there was anymore! The rest of the crowd said, "make more next time!" And it LOOKS so gourmet too. This is a keeper!

We loved this!  The addition of the Montreal chicken seasoning in the marinade was awesome!  I baked these for 30 minutes at 350 and then 7 minutes more with the cheese on top to melt.  I added the tomato at the e,d after baking, as I find cooked tomatoes to be too soggy.  Delicious!

I filleted the chicken so that it was 1/2 the thickness, and used Kraft fat free Italian dressing, and the exact spices specified.  I browned the chicken in my skillet, but instead of discarding the marinade, I poured it back in before it went in the oven.  I cooked on 500 for 15 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS!!!!  I  quartered grape tomatoes  and sauteed them super quick in a frying pan with a little bit of balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper and chopped basil and topped it with parmesan cheese.  We put it on pasta, so I'm glad I had the extra marinade, it turned into a sauce.  Then the tomato mixture - (skipped the mozzarella).  AMAZING and very low cal the way I made it!

This recipe is wonderfully flavorful, and the chicken was very tender. I skipped the chicken seasoning because I felt there would be enough flavor from the Italian dressing and seasoning. The chicken was grilled on the BBQ using wood chips which added flavor. I added the mozzarella and tomato at the end, and put the grill lid down to allow the cheese to melt which saved a dirty pan. I cut my fresh basil into a chiffonade because a whole leaf can be overwhelming as well as more difficult to eat. Since the breasts were large, I sliced them horizontally. We liked the thinner chicken, and it cooked quicker. My family raved about this recipe, asking me to "star" it so I can make it again. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

So good. I used cherry tomatoes and sauteed the tomatoes and basil before topping the chicken. The marinade was delicious! Very moist and tender chicken that wasn't bland.

I also love Insalata Caprese, but it turns out I like it cold and without chicken!  The marinated chicken was fine - tender and flavorful - typical for marinated chicken and nothing special.  I used a full 9 oz jar of Italian dressing because I didn't want 1 oz leftover.  I thought it needed extra tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.  It certainly was easy, but I found it to be boring and I didn't care for a warmed up tomato on top of my chicken.

Wow the marinade really made this chicken amazing. I thought the mozzarella and tomato were a bit of an overkill but the rest of my family loved it. I don't really like that much cheese. I've also just grilled the chicken with out the cheese and this also turned out great. All in all this is a great simple recipe and a different way to make chicken. I will defiantly be making this again. The best meal I made with this chicken is grilled chicken and asparagus in balsamic vinegar or leak salad with a vinegar.

I love everything Caprese...except this.    I followed the instructions to the letter but was disappointed.   The flavors of the dressing, italian herb seasonings and chicken seasonings were just too overpowering.  Everyone thought it was "okay" but I won't  make this again.

This is a really delicious and flavorful chicken recipe. The marinade gave it an abundance of flavors so I didn’t see the need to add balsamic vinaigrette at the end. For presentation, I added the slice of fresh mozzarella on top of the tomato. This was a nice evening meal to enjoy with angel hair pasta.

5 stars for great flavor and being a quick and easy recipe that tastes like it took a lot more effort! Made the recipe exactly as indicated, except that my husband and I love the rich flavor of goat cheese, so we added a little to our pieces and left the kids' with just the mozzarella. Fantastic! The only change I'll make next time around is to pound the chicken breasts before marinating -- not to tenderize, because the marinade already does a great job of that, but because I want more surface area for the marinade to soak into. This is one I'll definitely keep on hand for when company's coming, but I don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

I loved this recipe.  I did not use seasoning at all.  I cut the breast thin and marinated it in Ken's Lite Northern Italian w/Basil & Romano dressing overnight.  I love basil so I layered it basil, tomato, basil, cheese.  Once cooked I added more basil on top.  It was delish!!!!!  Could not believe it was with no seasoning.  Instead, I sautéed the chicken in olive oil.  I actually forgot to add the balsamic vinegar and it was awesome without it.  Can't wait to make this again.

This is a very simple, but very good recipe. I made it with boneless, skinless thighs, (my favorite cut), but otherwise stuck with the recipe. The only thing I'll change next time (and there will be a next time), is to add a sprig or two of Rosemary during the cooking process.

Loved this!   I was looking for a new recipe to use with a tomato, mozzarella and chicken breasts that I had on hand.  I did not have italian dressing, so I marinated in olive oil, italian seasoning, garlic salt, salt and basil.  I only marinated it for about 30 minutes.  I used thick chicken breasts that I butterflied to make thinner portions.  I also did not realize that I was out of balsamic vinegar, so had to substitute red wine vinegar & sugar (1T- 1/2 tsp).  It was delicious, thank you!  Rave reviews from my husband and 3 kids.

Family and I really liked this one.  However, my chicken was way too thick- needed to be much thinner.  Great recipe!

Healthy, delicious, and easy. I used 1" tomatoes cut in half, cut up the basil, and stirred together with salt and pepper. Then added it all to the skillet and covered for a few minutes, after melting the cheese.  It looked very appetizing and fresh.

A gift to the senses! Smelled enticing! Looked beautiful! Tasted delicious! Very simple to make! I followed recipe to the letter. I served more cold caprese tomatoes on the side as we couldn’t get enough of the caprese flavor with the chicken! Also served with Parmesan and Herb angel hair! It was a big, big hit!

Too much cheese for me and too much vinegar for my husband.  I just don't think this recipe is for us.  It was easy, it did present nicely, and I suspect most people would really like it though, so I'm not about to give it a low-star rating.  Since allrecipes no longer lets me make "notes" about a recipe, I must mark it in some manner so I remember not to make it again. Otherwise, I would not have reviewed it at all.

This is really good and a keeper for sure! I did what one reviewer suggested and sauteed grape tomatoes in a little balsamic vinegar and then threw them on top of the chicken at the end when melting the mozzarella. I also used pearl sized fresh mozzarella. Then added basil cut chiffonade style to serve. Delicious!

Does the marinade and 1 slice of mozz. cheese really make each chicken breast 583 calories? Very Tasty, but not quite as light as I would have suspected. Will make this again for sure, just have to include low cal sides - I did a side of Tomato soup, and dropped the fresh basil in. Very good pairing.

The chicken marinade and instructions were perfect and delicious! 500*F for 12 mins after searing was a bit much but the flavor of the marinade was amazing. I ended up just putting the caprese salad in the side because it seemed like a waste to melt buffalo mozzarella and cook the tomatoes. I removed a star for that, but the caprese salad and marinated chicken went together perfectly, do yourself a favor and try this recipe!

Good recipe.  I didn't have any fresh mozzarella so I used regular, but it still turned out good. I marinating it the key for flavor.

After a quick pan fry I placed in a 9x13 glass dish 2 tablespoons of Italian dressing and then the chicken and covered with tin foil and cooked it for 10 min.  When finished cooking I broiled the tomato and fresh mozzarella until melted. Delicious!!!

If you want a juicy, flavourful, easy to make chicken recipe, this is it.  
I love Mediterranean food, and this really works for me.  
I didn't have time to let the raw chicken rest in the marinade for as long as I would have liked,but it still turned out deliciously.  If it was allowed to sit overnight... omg yum!  
Also, save the juices from the skillet after you're done cooking, I bet it would make a great base for a salad dressing or a broth for soup/chicken stew.  
I didn't add the balsamic vinagrette at the end, and to be honest, I don't think I missed it at all.  
Both my partner and I nearly licked the plate!! So Good!!

This recipe is a keeper! I followed recipe except I used boneless skinless thigh cause there are smaller portions. Just smelling it made my mouth water. When tasting the burst of flavor was wonderful. Paired it with Zesty Zucchini And Squash also here and rice. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

The entire family loved this recipe. It is usually hard to make chicken breast juicy and tender, but it was not a problem with this recipe and cooking directions. I cooked it longer then the directions stated, since I was measuring the temp to make sure it reach 165 degrees, prior to adding cheese and tomatoes, so I likely overcooked it, but there where no negative effects that I could detect. Great recipe-thanks for sharing....

This was delicious!  Chicken is moist and flavorful.  I didn't heat the tomato on my, just my personal preference.  I also substituted the chicken for a slice of french baguette with garlic butter and herbs for my vegetarian mother in law..  also a delicious way to eat this.

Does the marinade and 1 slice of mozz. cheese really make each chicken breast 583 calories?  Very Tasty, but not quite as light as I would have suspected.  Will make this again for sure, just have to include low cal sides - I did a side of Tomato soup, and dropped the fresh basil in.  Very good pairing.

This is very much like the recipe that is in the Sonoma Diet Cookbook. The major difference is the addition of the Montreal seasoning. This recipe comes out delicious.

Instead of cherry tomatoes, I would use regular sized tomatoes. Preferably out of the garden or at least heirloom tomatoes from the grocery store. Also, add chopped fresh basil on top in addition to cooked basil for additional basil flavor (and to make it taste more like Caprese).

This meal was easy to make and tasted wonderful! I did not have fresh basil so used dry. I heated oven to 375 degrees as 500 degrees would blow out the thermostat on my oven. After browning in a skillet, I poured a little marinade over the chicken just before I put it in the oven and baked it 15 minutes to temperature of 165 degrees before adding the mozzarella and tomatoes and put it in long enough to melt the cheese. It looked fancy and had lots of good flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Really enjoyable! Made with chicken breast tenderloin. Fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese. marinade in Greek salad dressing with Montreal steak seasoning and a herb and citrus seasoning. Was all out of Montreal chicken seasoning.

Will make again for luncheon with a good girlfriend! Can't wait!

Thanks!

Great recipe. I didn't have Italian dressing so I substituted Caesar and it was great. Also, I grilled the chicken instead of using the oven. Overall this dish was fantastic!

I made this exactly as stated and it was really good!  It will probably make it's way into the rotation about once every few weeks.  I used Newman's Italian dressing and vine tomatoes and felt the flavors were great.  My only suggestion would be to use a thinner cut of mozzarella cheese.  I used the 1/2" cut and it was a little too cheesy.  I'd recommend 1/4".  Served with buttered orzo pasta and a simple side salad.  Yum!

A definite keeper.  I made it as written with chicken thighs instead of breast (family preference). There was a nice “dipping” sauce left in the pan to drizzle over the chicken on the plate. Fantastic.  I served this with zucchini pizza for a gluten-free meal for my step daughter. Thanks.

This was a total hit. Served over pasta.  Followed the recipe as written but used larger tomatoes that were too juicy (they made the pan really watery - will use cherry or grape tomatoes next time. Also forgot to add balsamic vinegar at end, but was still delicious.

Delicious!  I didn't have the Chicken Seasoning so I substituted a teaspoon of Better than Boullion Chicken base, heated up in microwave to soften so mixed well in the marinade.   I also salted the  chicken a little bit while frying in the canola oil as there was no salt in the recipe.    Turned out fantastic and will definitely make again!

This did not thrill me. I did not have fresh mozzerella so substitued shredded but pretty much followed the recipe otherwise.  When I told my husband that I probably would not make it again he said “Are you kidding me? That was delicious!” So, I promised him I would make it one more time & next time use fresh mozzarella. Update: Originally I gave this 3 stars but now give it a 5. Do not know what I did wrong last time but this time I cut pieces into sandwich size & served on toasted buns. Absolutely scrumptiously delicious.

I've made this several times.  So Good!  I diced the Roma tomotoes instead of slicing them before putting them on the chicken .   I also marinated the chicken in bottled Italian dressing.   I'm a bit confused as to the step of frying the chicken in canola oil in a cast iron skillet - I did that and it  made no difference from the result when I put the marinated chicken directly into the baking pan.  Seems like an unnecessary step to me!

Husband even liked it. The second time I used McCormicks herb, garlic and wine marinade 1/2 packet for the chicken seasoning and it was superb.

Made it last night and my husband was still talking about it this morning, so it was a winner!  Used garden fresh tomatoes and basil and good quality mozzarella.  Only had mediocre quality balsamic vinegar, but it was still good.

This recipe is very tasty and I'll certainly be making it again.  The chicken needs to be cooked longer in the oven but not by much (pre-cheese and tomato) - at least for me.  The chicken was moist but I prefer a drier chicken.  Don't skip out on the balsamic vinegar step.  It adds a favorable kick to the taste.

One thing I changed because I love basil it that I roughly chopped some basil and I sprinkled it on the chicken, then put the tomato and cheese on top. Then sprinkled a few fresh pieces on top after I drizzled the balsamic vinegar.

I used smaller chicken tenders instead of large chicken breasts so I baked them for a much shorter amount of time. I sautéed the tomatoes in olive oil  before putting them on the chicken. This came out really good! Thanks for the recipe:)

5 stars! an excellent easy quick meal to serve to family or guests. I added pepper jack cheese and provolone as well as bacon at the final step. served with egg noodles with tomato pesto and fresh roasted garlic green beans. wish I had left-overs!
