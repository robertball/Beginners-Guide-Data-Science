I also had the pleasure of trying this recipe before it became Kitchen Approved. This is my original review ~ Wow Shorecook! This recipe is sinfully delicious! I was in the mood for a melt-in-your-mouth candy for midnight snacking and Redneck Grandma directed me to this recipe. Boy am I glad she did! I toasted my walnuts in a skillet before adding it to the fudge and I used silicone cupcake liners sprayed with a bit of non-stick cooking spray to make individual servings of the fudge. I stuck them in the freezer in an airtight container for about an hour and they were set-up perfectly and ready for eating. It is very hard to stop at just one piece of this delectable fudge. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

I had made this recipe before it had become “kitchen approved”.  I’m so glad it is now published so many cooks have access to this exceptional recipe.  I usually don’t care for fudge that is made with chocolate chips and I believe that is because chocolate chips have paraffin, therefore contain less cocoa butter. However, I decided to try this recipe because the submitter is a talented cook. I am so glad I did. The fudge is fabulous. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips and added extra walnuts (personal preference). Fast, easy, and delicious –this recipe is a keeper.

Best. Fudge. Ever! Seriously, this stuff is amazing! I got the idea from another who made this recipe to use some candy cup papers and I used a small cookie scoop to measure fudge into each cup. The papers peel off easily and you have perfect looking and even tastier fudge! I added some vanilla butternut in place of maple extract. I made a large batch to package up for the bake sale at my daughter's elementary school Halloween Carnival. Huge hit and my go-to recipe!   :)

I made these last Christmas before they became famous:) They rached instant fame in my house. I added some to the give away tins and everyone loved them, will make again this year.

I had the privledge of trying this delicious fudge before it was published as 'Kitchen Approved' (CONGRATS, SHORECOOK!), and have made it MANY times since! Here was my review after my first time making it: AWESOME! I made this just now, and I literally could not wait for it to set up, lol. I was eating it out of the bowl...SO GOOD! It finally did make it into the pan and the fridge, so I'm now waiting (impatiently) for it to set up. If the warm fudge is any indication of what I'm in store for, I'd better make another batch quick! Thanks, SHORECOOK, for another super simple, incredibly DELICIOUS recipe! :)

My personal recipe review from dec 29, 2010: Yum! I didn't used to think I like maple flavor but this was really good. It was sooo easy and set up smooth and firm without being dry. It sat at room temp for 4 hrs this morning and held up well to that also. Thanks Shorecook, I think this was a great addition to my Christmas goodies.

This fudge is very good.  A few notes for the tweakers etc. First, 3 cups of white chocolate is 18 ounces of white chocolate pieces.  Second, a double boiler works fine if you prefer it over the microwave.  Third, a 9x9 pan would work fine in place of 8x8; the fudge would still be plenty thick.  Fouth,1 teaspoon Watkins brand imitation maple flavor was plenty of maple flavor.  Hope this helps.  Thanks SHORECOOK for another great recipe.

OK this is for sure served on the candy platter served in heaven! Super easy to prepare and impossible to stay away from.
Next time I'm going to try using Mexican style condensed milk. It has a caramel flavor and is great when you want to play with a recipe. Now it's out to the kitchen for another piece.

My kids and I made 3 different types of fudge over the holidays and this one was my favorite!  Just looking at this recipe makes my mouth water-they were that good! They cut nice and evenly, and the maple flavor paired well with the walnuts.  This will show up at the holidays and in between at my house for sure!  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This recipe will make you look like a professional candy maker.  I made this to accompany my cookie trays that I give to our neighbors.  They turned out perfect, were easy to make and looked beautiful.  (I did add a bit more powdered maple extract - only change made) One of my neighbors called me to ask where I bought the fudge.  "I made it" I said - they replied: "NO WAY" "-Yes"  I said, "I did too"! And so it went until I gave them the recipe!  LOL  So good I had to have proof!  Thanks SHORECOOK!

This is pretty good for being such an easy recipe - it doesn't get much simpler to make fudge.  However, it doesn't compare to the "Maple Walnut Fudge" recipe on this site, which calls for a stovetop rolling boil technique and adds marshmallows.  That's the recipe I'd probably return to~

I agreed with CherylB, the overwhelming taste is of white chocolate, not maple.

My fudge turned out too gooey and since there isn't any cooking involved I know it can't be blamed on the temperature not being right.

Very good fudge! And it couldn't be easier to make. I just melted it over low heat on the stovetop while stirring constantly. Worked great!

I liked this fudge---it is not as cloyingly sweet as I thought it would be, and is very creamy.  However, the consistency is a lot softer than I am used to and a little bit greasy (will probably use less butter or none at all next time I make it).  I did not prepare it in the microwave, but rather melted the white chips with the butter and fat-free sweetened condensed milk over low heat, stirring constantly.  Added the maple extract and toasted walnut pieces once off the heat.  Even after a few hours in the refrigerator and 1/2 hour in the freezer right before cutting, it was very soft.  I will probably also add a bit more maple extract next time.

My husband has craved maple walnut fudge for weeks but the local candy shop has not had any so far this year.  I saw this recipe and was amazed at the simplicity.  I prepared it and had it cooling in the fridge in very little time.  Of course, I sampled and made adjustments in the amount of maple flavoring to suit our personal taste before pouring the fudge mixture into a dish for refrigeration.  NOTE:  Please read the label to be sure you know whether you are using MAPLE FLAVORING or MAPLE EXTRACT because extract is stronger and will not require as much.  I only had maple flavoring so I used a tablespoon for a nice rich taste.

One teaspoon of maple extract didn't really make this as mapley as I wanted, so I added another.  That still didn't do the trick, so I squirted in some sugar free maple syrup and that did it.  I cut this into very small pieces and took it to work with some other treats.  Everyone loved it and I was asked for the recipe several times.  Thanks so much for the recipe, SHORECOOK!

This fudge turned out awesome!  Followed the directions exactly.  Melted the mixture 30 seconds at a time on 50% power.  It took about 3 minutes but did not burn and had good consistency.  The maple flavoring is just right.  I'll be making this recipe again and again.

12/13/2011; The following is my review for this absolutely fabulous fudge that I made last year prior to it becoming Kitchen Approved. Thank you Shorecook for the best tasting maple fudge I've ever had.!  "Well Merry Christmas to all of us!!! That was such a nice easy recipe and really tasty. I just love how simple and quick it went together. I also just adore that very creamy, almost melt in your mouth texture it has. No sugar to get grainy which is something that annoys me. Thanks for such a great recipe, it's going into the holiday file for a new found "must make". I'm making 2 more batches tomorrow."

We have the BEST fudge here at the Jersey Shore and this recipe equals or TOPS it.  The ONLY thing I added was an extra 1/2 cup of walnuts --- and that's only because the bag I bought contained 2 cups of nuts!  It was great!  

My friend and neighbor (who is an excellent cook and baker), was so impressed with this fudge that she, for the first time ever, asked me for the recipe!!  Also, I am a very straightforward cook --- a protein, a carb and a vegetable --- no baking or "fancy" cooking at all --- and she was astounded that I cooked a candy treat!  I'm so glad I did!  It's going to be a staple around here.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe with the rest of the world!

I made these to give out at Christmas and they were a huge hit. I had several people ask for the recipe. I left out the walnuts (I know, it's the most important part...) only because I wasn't sure about nut allergies at my office. It didn't have an overwhelming maple taste, just a hint, which was perfect. My husband ate a ton of it, and he doesn't even like fudge! Even the dogs ate it (which is another plus because since there's no chocolate, it was ok!).  My favorite part about this recipe was how incredibly simple it was. Impossible to mess up, super quick and very very easy. Took 5 minutes tops! A+++++++

Really good, but the white chocolate taste is a little too much for me. I'm going to try next "Maple Walnut Fudge" like another reviewer suggested. I like fudge with marshmallows! :)

I used a mixture of regular white chocolate chips (Nestle) and Ghirardelli's baking chips.  One of them just would not melt completely and I was afraid of scorching so I left some unmelted.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because that is all I had.  I like the additional crunch of the unmelted chips.  I really am not a fan of maple taste but this is very good.  I thought it was best when it was warm!  I was making a pig of myself.  Thanks SHORECOOK.

This just didn't have the maple flavor I was anticipating.  I used Mapleine brand maple flavoring which is the extract I use to make my pancake syrup.  Even added more.  I was a little disappointed.  It was very simple and creamy; I can see where I would use this with other flavors of chips and get a good outcome.

Absolutely amazing!!  Followed recipe exactly...turned out great.  My first time making fudge, couldn't have been any easier!  I loved it, kids loved it, will make this again for sure.  I may cut down on the maple extract a little bit next time, everyone has their own tastes, the maple was just a bit strong for me.  Thanks for the recipe.

This fudge is just fabulous!!  I LOVE maple, and thought that 1 teaspoon maple flavoring would not be sufficient for me, so I put in a full tablespoon (3 teaspoons).  I also cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons.  It turned out perfect!  Smooth, rich and creamy!

DELISH!  Great flavor, not overpowering.  This fudge is soft, not gritty, and extra smooth.  Definately, toast your walnuts before adding to the fudge.  Just use a hot, dry fry pan and toast until fragrent.  Nuts burn quickly--do not leave them in the heat.  Once you smell them they're ready for use.  I may try salted butter next time for that sweet/salty sensation.  Thank you.

I have made this fudge, using vanilla flavoring instead of maple. It's in the Sweetened Condensed Cookbooks. My husband can no longer have chocolate and loves maple so this was a hit.

I had never made fudge before, and anything maple is a favorite, so when I found this I decided to give it a go.  I followed the recipe, and everything was going well until it was time to add the maple extract.  I did the recommended 1 tsp, and tasted of nothing except white chocolate.  I decided to add some real maple syrup.  I used Grade B, which is darker in color and has a stronger maple flavor.  I just kept adding both syrup and extract until I could really taste the maple.  In all, I added 3 teaspoons of extract and 1/4 cup of maple syrup.  I think the syrup really helped to smooth out the fudge and enhanced the color.  Next time, I'll just start with 3 teaspoons of extract and the syrup, and add less walnuts.  I'm thinking 1 cup will be just fine.  Ultimately, with my additions, it tasted amazing (like maple walnut ice cream, but in fudge form);  but, using the original recipe, you're making white chocolate walnut fudge.

Meh. This fudge was super easy to make and had a decent texture but it tasted very strongly of milky white chocolate; this is despite having added 2.5 times the suggested amount of maple flavoring. Probably wont be my "go-to" maple fudge recipe. Also note that this fudge gets quite soft when stored at room temperature...I had to keep it in the fridge to keep it solid.

This recipe is so good that even non-maple lovers enjoy it!  I line my mini muffin pan with candy papers and pour the warm mixture directly into them, which makes the fudge easy to handle for serving or gift giving.  As written, the recipe always makes 48 candy papers full. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I made this recipe they way it said but left out the walnuts & increased the maple extract to 2 tsp. All I could taste was the white chocolate, no maple flavourings what so ever. The fudge never really hardened even after refrigerating for over 24hrs

Wow. And fudge is normally way down on my list of go-to sweets. 

I made this for someone as a gift and was very pleasantly surprised how good it was. The texture is very smooth and it cut up into amazing little cubes so easily! 

I added an extra 1/2 tsp of extract and toasted the walnuts. Hello delicious!

This stuff rocks!  It's so smooth and creamy.  The only thing I did differently is to add an extra small splash of the extract.  It probably would have been fine as written but I love maple flavor so I added more for my personal taste.  I also toasted the walnuts for a few minutes in the oven as another reviewer suggested.  I am now going to take this same recipe and use milk chocolate chips and vanilla extract to make chocolate fudge too!

This fudge was excellent!!!  Just like purchased fudge at specialty shops but without the cost!  The first time I made this recipe the fudge was very gooey even after being stored in the frig for a few days.  I searched the internet for how to resolve gooey fudge and found the answer was to reheat the fudge and add powdered sugar.   It would be about 1 cup powdered sugar for the entire recipe.  HOWEVER when I made this a second time, I decided to cut the sweetened condensed milk in half and that was the best answer to not having gooey fudge.  I used Watkins maple flavoring.  The first batch I used half white chocolate bark (shaved) and half Nestle's white chocolate chips.  The second batch I used Ghirardelli white chocolate chips.  Both chocolate options were good since the main flavoring is the Watkins maple flavoring.  **The key to non-gooey fudge is to cut the sweetened condensed milk amount in half.**

I enjoyed the flavor.  unlike those that complained of overwhelming white chocolate flavor,  i thought it had just the right maple taste.  HOWEVER...the consistency was wwwaaayyyyy too gooey. For that reason i will continue to look for a great maple fudge recipe. This just wasnt it

This was a really easy recipe to prepare, which I liked!!!!  I made it on the stove top instead of the microwave.  The consistancy was nice but not enough maple flavour for my liking, even after adding an additional tsp.  I think I might try and tweak it a little to get the flavour I'm looking for!

Made this for the first time (never had maple fudge before) and it was divine.  My son can't keep his hands off it.   I had to hide a few pieces so I can have some more!!  Thanks for sharing.  It will become a yearly Christmas treat (if not more often).

This fudge is wonderful, great flavor and so easy to make.  Will be making this for years to come.  I was so excited because I had tried another Maple nut fudge recipe before this and was disappointed in the results.  This is awsome stuff, worth making a trip to the store.  Thank you again. :)

Pretty yummy! Very rich and indulgent. I doubled the recipe easily and used a greased 13x9 pan, with greased aluminum foil inside (wax or parchment paper would've been easier, I think). I followed the recipe exactly, but I did use the microwave instead of the stovetop; the end result was delicious with a great soft, fudgy consistency, but I think the mixture might've been easier to work with if I would've let it get silky and smooth on the stovetop. I can see how other reviewers think the white chocolate taste is overwhelming - I used Bakers premium bars, and I think any extra maple extract might be too overpowering. It would be a very delicate balance to find beyond the called for 1 tsp. But overall, I think this could

I made this for a cookie swap, and it was the biggest hit of the night!  It was soooo easy and melt-in-your mouth delicious, but I would recommend chilling it for at least 2-3 hours before removing it from the baking dish.  The second batch I made only chilled for 1.5 hours and it was still too mushy to remove and cut.  Just an awesome and easy recipe!

This was delicious and so easy to make, BUT... I don't think I'll be making it again without some major tweaks to the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and used maple extract, as specified in the recipe (instead of maple flavouring, which according to some reviewers is different). I could not taste the maple at all. It was overwhelmingly white-chocolately flavoured. Texture was also much too soft, unless it's stored in the freezer. The walnut-to-fudge ratio is perfect, wouldn't change anything there. 
So, perhaps it needs more maple extract, and I'm not sure what would give it a firmer fudge-like texture, so I'll probably just keep looking for a more traditional recipe. 
Still, it is delicious, and I will have no problem eating this whole batch ;)

[edited to add: I just reheated the rest of the fudge and stirred in some more maple extract. The taste is perfect now but the consistency is still too soft. I would definitely recommend doubling or tripling the amount of maple until it is a nice brown colour, and store it in the freezer for a firm texture]

This was delicious and real easy to make. The recipes definitely doesn't call for enough maple extract though.  I tasted it after adding the recommended 1 teaspoon and it still tasted a lot like white chocolate. I ended up adding maybe 2-2 1/2 teaspoons instead (I didn't measure, I just gradually added more). Other than that, this recipe was wonderful.

This was super easy and tastes phenomenal. To those who think the white chocolate overpowers your maple extract, try using a tad bit more extract. My fudge turned out simply fabulous.

I made "Boardwalk Quality Maple Walnut Fudge" for my mother for her birthday, and it was a big hit! Mom said it was better than the fudge sold at the county fair (her usual favorite). Everyone else also said it was excellent. This recipe was so fast and easy to make too! Thank you SHORECOOK for sharing your recipe.

I loved the flavour.  However, I wasn't impressed with the way it set.
Followed directions with no changes, but fudge was gooey when I went to slice even tho I had let it set overnight at 0 degree C. The closer it came to room temp the more it became a sticky mess.  Does anyone know why mine should turn out this way?  Would like to make again.  Would it be better to make stove top? If so, how long does one cook/boil for? Thanks

I made this recipe last night and it turned out very tasty.  I did, however, panic a little bit when the butter did not mix in with the white chocolate and sweetened condensed milk.  Instead of using the microwave, I used a double boiler like I use for making other types of fudge, and I wonder if this is the reason, although that has never happened before.  Adding the walnuts seemed to do the trick, and everything came together.  I think that I will reduce the amount of butter by half next time because I noticed that it pooled and solidified in some places.  Also, I tried the silicone baking cups and found no need to spray them with cooking spray - the silicone peeled right off of the fudge.

I hate making fudge because I never get that smooth melt in your mouth taste, so I stopped making it for that reason. I was asked to make fudge for a tasting so I search for one high and low... I found this one, read the reviews and decided to try it. Im glad I did.. it was smooth, the only thing is I tasted more of the condensed milk that I would have liked too but that's ok. I think this fudge can be made in so many different variations that Im willing to experiment with different flavor of chips and extracts. thank you for sharing. I finally found a fudge I will continue to make.

Oh my gosh!! I have never made maple nut fudge, and I thought I'd try this new flavor for my holiday baskets this year. I always make fudge using the stovetop way, but I have to say - this was so easy, and even though it hasn't completely set, I can tell it is going to be amazing!! The thing I really like about this recipe is that it frees up my only fudge-making pot so I can make chocolate the same morning, without having to wash the pan in between batches. As another reviewer confirmed, I made this using a double boiler method, and I used Watkins brand maple extract, and a teaspoon was enough! The leftover in the bowl once I poured it into the pan that I taste tested was AWESOME!! This is definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you so much!!!

This fudge is delicious and super easy to make. I toasted the walnuts on the stove for a few minutes until slightly brown. 
I added a few extra drops of maple syrup. I also made another batch with semi-sweet chips, but I think would be better with milk chocolate.

This is fantastic! Very simple to make-very creamy! I made exactly as written and the only thing I may do different is to add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon maple extract as I thought it could use a bit more maple flavoring. But—it is still perfect as is! My mom was the queen of fudge making and I’ve yet to attempt her recipe as it requires double boiler, candy thermometer and more ingredients-so for now—this will be my go to recipe for maple walnut fudge. My husband was amazed when I said I was making fudge and about 5 minutes later I was finished! He said “I thought you were going to make fudge?!” I said “I just did-it needs an hour to cool” and a big smile came over his face! A big THANK YOU for submitting this easy yet DELICIOUS recipe!

I agree with other reviews in that the white chocolate overpowers the maple flavor, even after using triple the amount of flavor.  Texture is smooth and creamy.

I used pecans instead of Walnuts just because I already had them.  But it came together really well and fast. And tastes close enough to the pricey high end stuff some tourist areas offer.

I made this....but didn't use the butter.  I think walnuts are oily enough, it wasn't needed...and it wasn't!  Do use "real" maple flavoring (not the artificial stuff)...and like vanilla, if you "accidently spill" more into the batter than called for, it won't hurt anything!  :)    So I gave it four stars instead of five because of that omission of butter -- but otherwise it is a delicious easy fudge!

I made this for my Dad for Father's Day and he LOVED it! This year will mark the third year I've made it. It's super quick and  easy. People think you've slaved for hours  making it the old fashioned way.

I substituted peanuts but followed this recipe precisely and it  did not firm up after 3 hours in the refrigerator. This one is a disaster --do not waste your time.  The taste was OK but had to eat it with a spoon.

this is my 2nd time making this recipe.   the 1st time, the consistency was better but i tasted too much of the vanilla chips. the 2nd time i made it, i used 2 tsp of the maple extract and because i had 1/2 a cup  less of the chips than what was needed, i replaced it with marshmallow cream that i had on hand.  the flavor was great.  it was soft but the taste was too  good to care.

I made this for my family’s Christmas party, and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding a little more walnuts) and it’s good enough to be sold in a fancy fudge shop. Nice maple flavor, and a nice thick texture that you would expect from quality fudge. I’ll definitely make this again!

This fudge is hands down amazing, for ease and flavor.  I added 2 tsp of a fresh bottle of maple extract per some other reviewers recommendations, otherwise followed directions as shown.   Set up great in the fridge, but holding its shape fine when left out on counter. I will make individual candy cups as another reviewer  mentioned for next year.   This is a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly. My husband loves maple walnut fudge! To purchase it from a shop, it is very expensive so I thought I would try this recipe for the holidays. This fudge turned out perfect. It did not take hardly any time at all to make so that is a huge plus.  He loved the flavor and the walnuts. I believe I will have to make a couple more batches before Christmas gets here and company arrives.

I had tried some maple walnut fudge in Oklahoma and was determined to find a recipe.  Luckily I found this one!  I did add more maple flavoring, to enhance the maple taste more.  Love the fudge and can now make my own and do not have to travel to Oklahoma to get it!

UGH! I made this recipe once before and I followed the advice of another reviewer and doubled the amount of maple extract!! (That's a pretty significant difference!!). It turned out AMAZING! I used bacon instead of walnuts and, oh my, it was so good. But it wasn't this recipe as soon as I changed it. So I just made it again, and forgot that I added more maple... I'm so mad. It tastes terrible. It tastes like sweetened condensed milk, and that's NOT a good taste. The texture is great, and if you double the maple, it's a perfect maple fudge and I would recommend it... but if you don't.... yuck.

I love maple ANYTHING, which is why I couldn't wait to make this fudge.  I followed the directions exactly and bought a good-quality maple extract.  I found, however, that the texture of this fudge was only good after it sat overnight in the fridge - definitely way more than an hour.  The fudge smelled so good, I could hardly wait to try it.  Maybe I had too high of hopes for this recipe, but when I tasted it I was so disappointed.  The texture was ok, but the flavor wasn't nearly as strong as how it smelled.  The white chocolate definitely competed for the flavor, which is what I mainly got as an aftertaste.  My family thought it was ok as well, but after a couple little pieces, they were fine with me getting rid of the rest.  Very bummed, I really wanted to love this recipe.

Love this recipe.  My mother loves maple fudge.  I did add some pure maple syrup to make it more "maple-ly" for her but followed the recipe exactly the rest of the way.

I have to agree with many other reviewers, that this barely tasted like maple. I made it as-is, but doubled the amount of maple extract based on others recommendations. It still just tasted like melted white chocolate. My husband liked it anyway, but agreeed it wasn't maple fudge! It's a nice, easy recipe though for white choc. There is no way this recipe makes the pretty maple-colored fudge in the cover photo--mine was pure white!

Not happy with this recipe. It is way too gooey for my liking. I think fudge should be firm. This was too soft and difficult to get nice clean cuts. Too much white chocolate in this recipe. I prefer fudge that is cooked to about 235 degrees.

Couldn't wait to make this fudge since maple nut fudge is my favorite. Followed the recipe as written except I used roasted pecans because that's what I had on hand and used 2&1/2 teaspoons of Watkins maple extract because 1 teaspoon wasn't enough. Next time will use 1tablespoon. It is very cream and extremely easy to make. Will make again.

I used a double boiler instead of the microwave for more control over the outcome. I mixed in the walnuts first for flavor, then added a little extra maple extract. The temp was 165 degrees Farenhight using a standard candy thermometer. The consistency was perfect, as was the flavor. I will make this as long as I make fudge.

Made this for my father for his birthday because he is a big fan of maple fudge.  I doubled the maple flavoring which gave it just a little more hit of maple.  flavor was still subtle but delicious.  Also, I didn't add nuts...  he is not a fan. My father said it was the best fudge he has had because the maple flavor was not overpowering or "fake" tasting.

Easy to make, I loved it and will make it again.
Because I've had difficulty with melting white chocolate in the microwave, I melted the chocolate and made it using  a double boiler

Super simple, but the second time I made it, I almost doubled the amt. of maple flavoring. Make sure it's natural, not imitation.  Yummy!

Loved this and so did my co-workers that I gifted it to. I do admit to halving the butter and doubling the maple extract because after tasting with only one teaspoon of extract it still tasted of vanilla-y white chocolate. (Perhaps my choice of white chocolate chips?) Very easy, will certainly make this again next year, if not sooner. Thanks, Shorecook, you've got a winner.

Loved this!  Does anyone have suggestions on how to make it a little less sticky?  I lightly greased an 8x8 pan then put wax paper followed by the fudge.  Everything came out perfect except that I had the hardest time cutting the fudge because it stuck to everything.  Will keep trying different things - I also tried lightly greasing the pan and put the fudge right in the pan but made a huge mess getting it out

Big hit at our house!  We like to call it "Fundy" because its consistency is somewhere between fudge and a chewy candy.  We made it in the little foil candy wrappers to add to our goody trays at Christmas.  It made about 60! We have also made it several times in a 9 x 9.

This is very good fudge.  I did add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract and an extra half cup of walnuts.  It gets better after a few days.

I'm the submitter and I would like to state that White chocolate chips and white chocolate candy melts are not the same.  I would also like to add that sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk are not the same thing.  It would affect the texture.  I hope this is helpful.
