My mother made this a lot for us when we were kids. I remember her using 2 cans of pork and beans and however many hot dogs she had leftover from our lunch that day. This is very economical and provides good protein at low cost. We were poor when I was young and I remember having this a lot. Mom also would let us help by putting a strip or two of bacon on top; I thought I was a big girl helping to "cook". Thanks for the great memory.

Excellent, I followed the recipe exactly and we all loved it. The only thing I would like to say is if you don't like sweet then lessen the amount of sugar.

I made a similar dish to this when my girls were small children -- the difference was added do-dahs; barbecue sauce, Worcestershire, bacon, shredded Cheddar cheese) you get the idea.  They sometimes wanted this poured over toasted hot dog buns...

Good ol' beans and franks are a great standby for those of us on a budget and a bunch of big appetites to feed.  I used a 28-ounce can of pork and beans, half an onion, chopped, and sliced up a pound of smoked sausages.  I also doubled the brown sugar, mustard and celery salt.  It came out excellent!

I simply cannot understand how you can feed six people with one can of beans. And I cannot understand why six people need one pound (!) of hot dogs. My family hated this recipe!

i've made this numerous times and i'm giving it 4 stars because i've had to tweak the recipe for my taste.  first i use hot sausages instead of hotdogs(something like a keilbasa-just spicier).  i also add a dab each of ketchup, bbq sauce and molasses.  i also just make it on top of the stove.  it's quick and very much a comfort food for me.

I have always liked hotdogs mixed with different things. I usually make this without onions right on the stovetop in a sauce pan. Slice up some hotdogs and brown in some margarine and add to beans with seasonings. Very fast and tasty meal, especially for campers. I also like the hotdogs this way added to Kraft mac n cheese or fried potatoes with seasoning. Thanks Kerby!!

A family favorite. I didn't use as much brown sugar as this recipe called for and it was still very sweet to me. I prefer the way my husband makes it with BBQ sauce added.

I am giving this five stars because it is easy, inexpensive, and this with toast is now my husband's favourite meal. I am not a fan of "franks" cut up and put in anything, but this is not bad. My man's yummy noises as he sops up the last of his sauce with toast makes it ok by me.

Perfect recipe for the whole family...my two boys eat it up every time. I don't put onions in it instead a couple of dashes of onion powder and I add a squirt of ketchup and a couple of tablespoons of bbq sauce. I also add some shredded cheddar cheese...yum...I make this all the time!

Very tasty! Although I'm not sure how it feeds 6 it just barely was enough for my husband & I. I don't think it was too sweet like others did either. This will be a staple in our house and next time I'll add more onions and bacon.

UPDATE: Warmed up some left-overs for lunch today and was somewhat disappointed. The hot dogs were very unappealing (i.e. wrinkled / shriveled) and the bean mixture was gummy. Next time I'll warm up in the oven instead of in the microwave. Maybe this will alleviate the problem. I can remember my mom making a similar casserole when I was a child. I liked hers back then and I really like this one although a little different (I think mom's recipe called for katsup and maybe Worcestershire sauce). Mom can't find her copy and doesn't remember it verbatim (she hasn't made this in a long while) so I'm keeping this one in my "keeper" file so I have it at the ready! This is a very inexpensive kid-friendly main dish and is SUPER easy to prepare (I love that!). My only modifications were to use half of a 16 oz. pkg. of hot dogs (4 dogs) and skip slicing them (just dropped each one on top of the bean mixture). A full pkg. seemed like too much especially since the recipe only called for one can of beans. Other than that I followed this recipe to a T. Served with "hot dog bun" garlic bread (a cheap creation of mine!). Thanks for sharing.: )

I enjoyed this. I knew my kids wouldn't eat the onions so I ommited the saute step. I found 3 hot dogs to be enough.

Very flavorful but a bit soupy. I made it with 2 cans of plain pork and beans and will be sure to drain the liquid off next time! I also cut back a little on the sugar and used a medium sized onion rather than just 3 tbsp. served it in bowls with warm crusty bread. The teenagers in my house liked it!

I used 5 hot dogs and one 16 ounce of beans. Used half of the brown sugar. Added BBQ sauce. Baked 30 minutes. Delicious.
