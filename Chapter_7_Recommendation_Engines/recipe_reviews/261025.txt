Loved these! Super simple, and honestly I wasn't expecting this much flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I used Rao's marinara sauce and served these over shirataki noodles. Delicious!  This is going in my regular rotation!  The only thing I would suggest is if you are serving these over shirataki noodles, so use a bit more tomato sauce.  I will also try these over mashed cauliflower, but they'd also be tasty on their own!

The recipe was good but honestly we would have rather just had a hamburger patty, which would have been a lot less hassle. 
The taste was good but the meatballs fell apart. New to the Keto diet so that may play a part but dang regular meatballs are sooooo much better.

I made these meatballs and like everyone else they fell apart they need more of a binding item, maybe more flaxseed meal or crushed crackers or oatmeal.  taste was good.

They didn't stick together.  Recommend adding more egg.
