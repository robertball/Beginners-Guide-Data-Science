This was very good. I've had canned chili before and it left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. This dish came together quickly and I would recommend it.  My only change was to garnish with cilantro. The next time I will reduce the amount of sliced green onions to 1/4 cup.

This was overall a great recipe and perfect for a crowd or a snack on a quiet night at home. I was able to cut the recipe in half and make this as an appetizer for my husband and I to share. I recommend cutting the milk in half because the cheese, cream cheese, and milk mixture was on the soft side and a little tricky to blend with so much milk. Make sure you add a drizzle of taco or hot sauce to the top before serving for an extra punch  of flavor. I never thought to use chili in a layered taco dip but this is something to keep on hand in case I'm in a pinch and need to whip up an appetizer quickly.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

"Thanks Hormel for the product!"
Obligatory disclaimer, aside, this was a super easy dip to toss together.  I've never used canned chili before, but would use it again to make this dip in a pinch.  If I were to make this again, I'd sub sour cream for the milk in the base as the milk made it to watery for my preference.  I'd also prefer chili WITH beans, but it works without, too.  I served this with Fritos Scoops and tortilla chips and it was well received.  THANKS for the recipe, and the chili, Hormel!

It took me longer than 15 min to prep. Between chopping and slicing. I added a layer of avocado so itâ€™s an 8 layer chili dip!!! Tasted delicious!

This was a quick & easy crowd pleaser! I added cilantro and chipotle pepper powder. I brought it to a potluck and brought home an empty plate!

Made as written except I used the chili with beans and I loved everything about this. I'm not even a big fan of cream cheese but couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for breakfast today. If I had to change one thing, I would add some hot sauce to my chili when heating for an extra kick. We really enjoyed this and I will most definitely make again.

I cut the recipe in half exactly (using the chili with beans), and rather than using it as an appetizer I made it our "salad" for hamburger patties that I grilled tonight.  It worked out perfectly!  Thanks so much, Hormel!

I thought this was really easy to make.  I heated up the chili the first day.   It made it easier to spread.  However, on day two, I thought it tasted much better after sitting in the fridge all night.  This is kid friendly because it's not spicy, but I think I'll add jalapenos next time and a little garlic salt.

This recipe is very easy to put together and makes a great presentation with all the colors!  I think next time, I will microwave both the cream cheese layer and the chili layer for a more gooey type dip.  It's very mild, so if you like spice, make sure to add some cayenne powder or jalapenos to give it some kick. Goes great with corn chips!  Great recipe!
