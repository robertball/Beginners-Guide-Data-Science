A fun and tasty treat! I found the paper packets for this dish at a local mom and pop Asian market and fried half in foil packets and half in paper packets in a wok. Using either type of packet worked great. The presentation was prettier with the paper but the fun part about the foil was the mystery of not being able to see what was in the packets. One thing I would suggest, Sean, is to add one teaspoon of sesame oil to the ingredient list. Searched online for photos (my camera was out of batteries) and added a couple here so viewers know what the completed foil and paper packets look like. Next time I make these am going to try it with my Yakitori Tare marinade simply to taste the difference between them being fried versus grilled on a skewer. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Donâ€™t use chicken cubes. Use ground chicken and test one to make sure your heat is correct. 2-3 minutes each side.
