Relax Angela, not every recipe has to be gourmet or take hours to prepare to be a recipe on this site. :-) This is a simple, easy snack for kids (and adults too!) and something I would not have thought of on my own. Thanks for posting this recipe - I'm going to make them for my kids later today. And I love another posters idea of putting carrot puree into the sauce to "veg it up"!!

I made this for the kids for lunch today. They flipped for them. I added carrot puree into the tomato sauce for added veggie boost. I'd make these again. Cute change up on pizza.

What a great little snack!  I always seem to have leftover pizza sauce and pepperoni and I always have cheese!  I used Townhouse crackers instead since that is what I had but to me it resembles more of a "pizza crust" than wheat crackers anyway.  I'd like to try baking these under the broiler but they were still good out of the microwave!

Fun & easy snack idea and the kids love 'em!  They may not need 1-2 min. in your microwave, though so keep an eye on them!

This recipe was just okay. It was good, but nothing special. I don't think I'll be making it again.

This is a tasty, quick and easy snack. My daughter said it tasted like Lunchables but better.  Will make again.

This is not something I would ever choose to make again. I'm glad I only made a few because I wouldn't want to eat more than that. English muffins make for a better quick pizza.

My young Grandchildren and I made these when they visited from out-of-state. What a clever idea that I would never have thought of by myself. I would urge everyone to follow this simple recipe by sticking with using the wheat crackers only. Now that my Grandchildren are home again my Daughter says that they request these snacks constantly.

I've been waiting to see a recipe for these. I've been making these since I was old enough to use the microwave and I still love them. My mom taught me how to make them and even taught my classmates when I was in the 3rd grade. In my family we call them Bambinos. I normally add either yellow bell peppers or jalapenos on top. You can also bake them too if you are making a large amount.
