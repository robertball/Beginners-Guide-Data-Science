This was very good, my boyfriend loved it.  We baked it the other day as the grill was under a snow bank and he even thought it was better...kept more of the flavor.  It's a keeper!!

we used a 1 lb. ham steak (1/2" or so thick) & marinated it for about 3 hours. i liked scoring the ham's surface.....it gave the meat extra flavor & an interesting appearance. this recipe is spicy but the flavors all come together in the end. thanks cook's!

Flavorful.  I reduced the amount of cilantro, a little.  Will use this recipe again.

What a great recipe! Perfect to serve for the family and company! Even my 5 year old ate it. Just don't put any of the remaining jelly on afterwards for the little ones...it gets a nice kick to it!! Will use again!!

This was so easy. Such a great twist for a plain piece of ham.  Yum, it's a keeper.
