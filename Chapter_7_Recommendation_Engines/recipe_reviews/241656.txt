You know as I read over this recipe I already had doubts about the mustard. Everything else seemed to fit and work together except the mustard. But as this recipe s first reviewer I felt it was important to prepare the recipe exactly allowing future cooks to make tweaks if they so chose to based on my experience with the original recipe. For my tastes I didn t see this as a full sandwich but I liked the submitter s suggestion of tea sandwiches. Working off that I just spooned it onto crostini and sprinkled them with chopped green onion for a garnish of color. Unfortunately I regret to say that my first instinct about the mustard was correct it was a real deal breaker for me. It dominated pure and simple masking all other flavors including the beautiful shrimp I used for this recipe. (I used 16-20 count which really is much too expensive to be chopped up but it s what I had on hand). Just a suggestion if you re going to use the mustard at all (and frankly I wouldn t) start off with a much smaller amount. You can always add more but you can t take it away. It s a shame - were it not for the mustard I know I really would have liked this. Also this is rich too rich I think to eat as a full sandwich.

I made this omitting mustard as another advised and substituted onion powder for the onion. But the real kicker is being out of cream cheese I substituted 3 oz. of Mascarpone. Maybe Grandma was Italian. Served this on whole wheat (100 calorie) sandwich thins topped with slices of hard boiled eggs. Everyone absolutely loved it.

As a dip I substituted "McCutcheon's" Vidalia Onion Honey Frencn Salad Dressing for the ketchup and Old Bay to taste instead of the garlic. I like to fill the TOSTITOS Tortilla Chips "Scoops" and take them down in one big bite:)

Used Chef John's garlic shrimp recipe yesterday. Used the leftovers today and most of this recipe. Didn't have cream cheese but substituted a little left over garlic sauce. Didn't have celery either but - we'll live. Came out pretty good.

Kids loved it even my super picky 3 yr old. I did omit the mustard and used avocado mayo. Otherwise made as written. Served on wheat crackers. Very simple and tasty. Easy way to get a different protein into kids.
