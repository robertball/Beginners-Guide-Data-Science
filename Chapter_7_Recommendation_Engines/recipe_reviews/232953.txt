Soooo Gooood, my newest addiction!! Love frozen chocolate dipped bananas and love these bite sized treats even more with the addition of peanut butter and because they are bite sized. I used a bag of semisweet chocolate chips and did not add shortening once they were melted. I also sub'd the toffee chips out and used crushed peanuts instead. Peanut butter and banana chunks really need to be frozen well to make the next step of dipping in chocolate work well. I didn't measure the peanut butter either and just used my judgment when topping a banana slice. These little frozen bites of delight are rich, satisfying and delicious!

These were so good, but so rich. You're gonna need a glass of milk!
They were easy to make, but time consuming. Definitely plan on making these the day before you want to serve them. The part I found most tedious was putting the peanut butter on. I might experiment next time with melting the P.B and freezing the banana slices first, then dipping them in P.B then freezing again, then dipping in chocolate. You could use P.B chips, but it wouldn't be quite the same.
All in all this was a hit with my daughter's softball team. The girls devoured a double batch and none were left over.

Awesome, I loved it. As a crazed Nutella addict, I also made a few using just the Nutella,  bananas, chopped nuts, and even a couple using shaved coconut.  That was my favorite.

I thought it was ok taste-wise. Nothing spectacular. At first I didn't want to make them due to the prep time so I improvised. I sliced the bananas and put them in a dish, put a dollop of peanut butter on top, and added the toothpick. I melted the chocolate and drizzled it over all. They weren't completely covered as they would have been if I had dipped them, but the taste was comparable and this way was much easier to prepare.

These were ok. I love peanut butter and chocolate but the frozen banana was a weird texture. I took another reviewers suggestion and warmed the peanut butter so that it was easy to dip the (frozen) bananas in it. I melted the chocolate in the microwave.

I love these.That being said next time I will use chocolate chips (leave out the shortening) and coat with nuts. I also will melt some peanut butter to dip part of them in.

these were great my hubby n 5 year old loved them! couple tips freeze them over night or atleast a good 6 hrs on both freeze times. the chocolate made the banana mushy but they were still good. when i kept the left overs in the freezer all night they came solid n were better. on the second freeze after the chocolate coating i froze them 3 hrs and they weren't 2 bad mushy wise so if u cant do over night i would recommend at least 5 -6 hrs and test them out in the processes 2 see if they need longer every fridge is different!

I love these. Frozen bananas with peanut butter are one of my favorites. Instead of globing the peanut butter on the banana, I used a straw to poke a hole through the middle of the entire length of banana, then put the peanut butter in a plastic bag and snipped off the corner and filled the banana with peanut butter. Froze that over night and dipped it in chocolate and topped with toffee.

I giving these a 4. It's really an average of 5 for taste (they are really, really good!) and a 3 for preparation (it's a bit time consuming and messy with lots of wait time in between!). The combination of flavors is amazing, and the recipe seems to be very adaptable to whatever you might have on-hand in addition to bananas and chocolate. It's a great way to use bananas that are are getting a bit too ripe.

Yes! These are delicious. Frozen bananas taste so much like ice cream. Can't wait to make these with my little nieces.

These were so good!  I just did one banana because I didn't want to be stuck with a bunch of these if we didn't like them, but I'll definitely be making them again!  I used melted Hershey bars and skipped the toffee bits.  So yummy!

So easy my daughter could've made it alone but we did it together for her turn for snack-sharing in school. Plus, it's simply delicious. Who doesn't like banana and chocolate? 

I changed the chocolate with coating chocolate so I only needed to melt it alone in the microwave (without shortening), and nuts with colorful sprinkles.

These are good but not a crowd pleaser.  I have a freezer full of these. Good thing me and one of my boys love frozen bananas.  
I did as another suggested and used a boba straw to "carve" out the middle of a 2 in banana slice. I then piped in the peanut butter. Much lovelier taste I'd have to presume as the other way looks like way too much.

Yum! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed these. We did half the bananas with peanut butter scooped as the recipe and video indicated. We heated some peanut butter in a glass liquid measure (not molten, just enough to thin it a bit) and spooned over the rest. This was WAY faster and we could tell no difference once they were all dipped in chocolate. They were richer than expected, even the kids thought so. I would double the size of the banana chunks next time to lessen that. (We did about 1" chunks.) We each ate a peanut butter banana bite before dipping them in chocolate. I thought they were good but my husband preferred the un-chocolated after tasting both ways, which blew my mind. We topped the chocolate finished bites with chia seeds and course ground walnut meal (bc that's what we had). I thought the chia was the best bc they are so crispy. Like sprinkles but not as cute. Simple and friendly for group participation.

Yum!  Will definitely make again. The hardest part was getting the peanut butter to stick to the banana slices. Next time, I'll try slightly melting the pb first. Using toothpicks in each banana slice from the start helps!
