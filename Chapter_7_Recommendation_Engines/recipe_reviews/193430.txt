The first time I made it I thought it was good, but it took almost twice as long to cook the noodles. This Time I left the water out and cooked the noodles seperately, made a huge difference. (still added the liquid w/ the mushrooms) I also added some garlic to the chicken and onions while they were cooking. My new favorite recipe

Dry and bland. Maybe if you cooked the noodles separately and added some milk to the sauce. Not worth bothering with in my house.

This was quick easy and tasted fantastic.  Definitly will make again.  The tbs of chipoltle made it spicy, but not overdone.  Some might want to use only tsp.  The noodles were tender with no pre cooking.
