My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  I'm Keto but my husband isn't.  I made a few changes:  I used half -n-half instead of heavy cream (still Keto Friendly) and like others, I cooked the bacon ahead of time.  I also baked it about 20 minutes and then added the bacon and cheese on top, rather than inside the casserole.  I served it with traditional hamburger toppings on the side.  It was lovely and will definitely make again.

Definitely will make again! I realized halfway through that, although I made "this dish" before, I had gotten the recipe from Buns in the Oven, which called for a few additional ingredients. So I altered this recipe by adding a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbs of ketchup, 1 1/2 tbs of mustard and about 3 oz of cream cheese from BITO's recipe since my family and I enjoyed it so much. I also used the chopped garlic in a jar equivalent of the garlic cloves and sauteed diced onions in lieu of onion powder. I also cooked my bacon before adding it to avoid extra grease.  It came out delicious! I baked @ 375° for 30 minutes (the recipe doesn't list a degree for baking so I got that from the comments section here). Absolutely a favorite dish...one I'll happily make again. It's such a great meal Keto followers won't feel deprived in the least!

This is delicious! Couple of tips (don’t think the enter button is on your iPhone keyboard! It’s “done” I posted two accidental reviews!) serve it with sour cream and Tabasco on top. It’s so delicious that way and still low carb. Season up the meat the way you like it too. I used a bunch of chili powder with the rest of the spices. For first time cooks, don’t forget to COOK THE BACON first. I cook mine on a THIN cookie sheet with aluminum foil on top in the middle rack of the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. It usually comes out incredible. Do NOT use a thick baking sheet. It will burn the bacon. Do NOT put it on the bottom rack. It will burn the bacon. Middle or top rack for 20 minutes and check on it often. Careful removing it from the oven as you will have plenty of grease in the cookie sheet.

Very good with some changes based on other reviews and my preferences.  First, it's just me here so I essentially cut recipe in half.  I used 3 large cloves of minced garlic and a medium chopped onion, all cooked with the beef.  Added a bit of chili powder, ground cayenne pepper and a dash of Worcestershire.  I used 2-3 TBS bacon grease to brown beef and drained it thoroughly when done.  I also cooked chopped bacon separately until really crisp and drained thoroughly on paper towels.  Poured into casserole dish sprayed with PAM, added bacon.  Used about 1/4 of an 8 oz brick of Philly Cream Cheese, pinching off small pieces and "poking" into the beef mixture.  Used 3 large eggs with cream, added some Monterey Jack to my Cheddar cheese.  Poured over per directions, topped with cheese mixture, baked.
This is a great recipe - can be modified to suit your individual preferences.  May try with half beef/ half breakfast sausage next time.   Nothing greasy about mine but I did drain everything really well.  This will be one of my "regulars" - good, easy, cheap.  What's not to like?  :)

Looks good I used 2 and a half cups of cheddar and 1/2 pound of bacon(only because that’s all I had). Also added some Cajun seasoning to the ground beef. Turned out pretty good. I’d make it again

I took the advice on how to make this less greasy and it was still way too much.  If you’re into a very high fat, beefy, greasy casserole, this is it.  I’m a sometimes Keto-girl and I cook daily, but there are better ways.  No thanks, not a fan.

This recipe needs some serious help. ADD SEASONING.  Double the amount of garlic, or even better, triple it. Add salt, cayenne pepper, chili powder and some paprika. I also added green chilis and onion to the hamburger while cooking and it still could have used more flavor.  I fried the bacon before mixing it with the meat...nobody like limp bacon...nobody. I used Mexican cheese and sharp Cheddar. 3 out of 4 people liked this. Probably wont make again.

I cooked the bacon first as I was worried about all the grease.  It's not bad; breakfast for dinner is OK sometimes.

The flavor was good. I will make again, but will also cook the bacon ahead of time to eliminate grease.

This was easy to make, and looked phenomenal when it came out of the over, but it tasted pretty meh.  My family is doing low carb, and I know fat is not supposed to be an issue, but the saturated fat content (ground beef + bacon + cheese + heavy cream) is off the charts here and just seems unhealthy.  The whole casserole was eaten and everyone said it was "good," but it would have had to be really awesome for me to make again.

Precook the bacon before adding it to the cooked ground beef! Otherwise, your casserole will be swimming in grease. Very tasty! Will definitely make this again.

This cheeseburger casserole was delicious! I added Worcestershire sauce to the beef while sauteing. I also added cream cheese to the egg/cheese mixture and blended until the cream cheese was in small chunks. This gave an excellent burst of cream cheese in every bite once cooked. I highly recommend! It's an excellent option for breakfast and reheats really well. Overall, this was really quick and easy and I will definitely remake!

I used 8 eggs like the recipe calls for, but it was too much. It came out as scrambled eggs on top. Next time I'm only using 4 or 5 eggs.

I have to be completely honest, I have made this dish 2x already. Why. Because I forgot how bad it was. It’s so dry and no flavor whatsoever ! BUT WHEN YOU LOOK @ the ingredients, you think, yes! This could be good. That’s why I was duped the second time around. Ingredients are great, SEPARATELY. It is COMPLETELY DRY AND BLAND TOGETHER. BUT A + on ingredients. It sounds great !

I reduced the cream to only 1/2 cup because of prior experience, however the eggs mixture did not cover the whole casserole and I ended up adding 4 more eggs and 1/4 cup more of cream along with more cheese.(my bad) I also precooked the bacon. Otherwise, I feel it was bland as stated when I make it again I will use much more seasoning

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!!  The second time I cut the ingredients in half and put it in a casserole dish. For some reason it didn't turn out nearly as good.

Excellent! I made it as a main dish, layered as lasagna and added a little oregano and parsley flakes.

I made it, added green peppers and onions to the hambuger meat. Cooked 15 mins in a 375 degree oven. 
Also left out the whipping cream, to make it firmer.

I don't really have complaints - the recipe is fine. It could just use some spicing up, at least for our tastes. I added some mushrooms and onion - and glad I did. Would add more next time. Montreal steak seasoning is something else I'll mix in - just like when I grill burgers. A couple of notes about the instructions: No oven temp was listed. I did mine at 350° and that seemed about right. I might bump it to 375°.  Also - absolutely cook the bacon in advance. That's not mentioned, but this would be really greasy and I'm not sure the bacon would be done otherwise. I did mine in the oven and it softened up after baking it more in the casserole .

I added fresh chopped white onions and sliced mushrooms  before adding the egg mixture then added the remaining cheese. Ate for dinner and it was pretty good. This seems more like a breakfast dish though and is excellent reheated for breakfast as well!
