We made this for our Grey Cup Party and it was a huge hit! The spice level is very pleasing for everyone but if it was just my husband and I eating it I would definitely make it much more spicy.

Very good I choose to add the peanut butter and l/3 cup of unsalted peanuts directly into the chicken mixture. With heat on low melted the peanut butter and then removed from heat and served sprinkling the green onions and grated carrots on top.

Loved this recipe. I used romaine lettuce and green pepper instead of red but I doubt that made that much of a difference. Definitely liked the dipping sauce directly on top of the chicken mixture. Will make again!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I only gave it four stars because I used low sodium soy sauce rather than regular. I also added some extra hot sauce to the chicken because we like it spicy. The peanut sauce is delicious and the onion and cilantro really make the wraps pop. Even better the second day if you have leftovers. Thanks or the great recipe!

We (my husband and I) absolutely love this recipe. Now that i have made it a few times I have done it with ground chicken leftover cut up chicken from a whole smoked chicken we cooked on out smoker and also vegetarian because our neighbor is a vegetarian and all variations were very good. Even the vegetarian way. We like this best with the ground chicken and when making the peanut butter sauce we use Adams all natural chunky PB and add much more hot water than it calls for. I also add a little bit of sesame oil and sriracha sauce to give it a little kick. I don't use the recommended amount of soy sauce in it either - I use way less(in the pb sauce and in the meat mixture both)because alot of people said it was too salty in the reviews. I will definitely continue to make this

This was great - quick easy and let me use ingredients I had on hand. I sauted diced chicken and onion then added diced zucchini and red bell pepper. Then added soy sauce rice vinegar ground ginger chili oil (so no need for Tabasco) and chunky peanut butter. Simmered on low adding a bit of water as needed then served over a bed of lettuce. A hit with the whole family.

Got some chopped chicken meat to give this recipe a try and it was a fail for me my husband did enjoy it thro I think it should be low salt soy sauce and for the peanut sauce just leave out the soy I just added hott water and hot sauce and mixed up the chicken and peanut sauce together right before I put it in the wrap it's less messy that way. I'll try it again and play with the recipe more

Too salty. I even used the lower sodium and less than 1/2 cup but WOW.....way too salty. Be warned unless you are a salt lover you will not be able to eat these.

Wow this was delicious! I ground my own chicken because I buy chickens whole and break them down myself to save plus I like to make my own chicken stock!:) I just remove the breasts from the bone cut them into chunks and grind them in my food processor. For the peanut sauce I used creamy peanut butter because I have a 17 month old that wouldn't be able to chew peanuts. I also added about 2 T of rice vinegar to the sauce. I made some rice quinoa blend for a side although we used it in the wraps instead. I didn't think this was too salty at all but I love salt! I would recommend this for sure.

This was a decent recipe I really liked the sauce that goes on the chicken thought the peanut dipping sauce was a good complement to it. Next time I think I will throw in some bean sprouts and water chestnuts with it.

I wish I had read the other reviews about too much salt. It was WAY too salty as others have said.

My husband said that this was in the top 5 best meals I've ever made. When I make it again I'll use less soy sauce and maybe add Szechuan sauce instead.

Love this recipe. I use low sodium soy sauce and add a teaspoon of cornstarch to the liquid ingredients. It helps to thicken the sauce a bit so it isn't so drippy. Sometimes we just serve this on top of chopped romaine. We like shredded carrot and chopped peanuts with ours. Also we use Sriracha sauce if we don't have have Tabasco or other hot sauces.

I followed this recipe exactly. My husband and I loved it because it was full of flavors. Some said it is too salty but we loved the salty flavor. We will make this when we have company. It's great for talking and being together. Put all the ingredients on a Lazy Susan in the center of the table. Friends can help themselves at the table.

I didn't use green onions and for the peanut dip I only used 1/4 cup peanut butter and slightly more water and less soy sauce.

I cut the soy sauce back a bit so the sodium isn't so overwhelming. These are better than any I've had at a restaurant.

Like most people who made this recipe I found it too salty and I love salt so that says a lot! Otherwise great flavor and it was delicious. I'll definitely make them again I'll just use less soy sauce.

WAY too salty when prepared with stated amount of soy sauce. Maybe low sodium sauce would help but 1/2 cup is still too much. I would leave soy sauce out of the dip altogether and just use hot water. I think this recipe definitely has potential but it was hard to taste past the saltiness.

Too salty. Definitely use a low-sodium soy sauce. I also found the peanut sauce lacking. Although we did eat them all I would change things up next time.

I might make this again but like a lot of other reviewers I found it too salty. I used low salt soy in the meat mixture and it was fine. I used half low salt and half regular soy in the peanut butter mixture and that was way too salty.

These were delicious! I made a number of changes due to the ingredients I had on hand but the basic sauce it's cooked in is wonderful. I had some leftover cooked chicken breasts that I cubed for the meat so I made the sauce and added the chicken afterwards. I didn't have any red peppers but I did have a can of water chestnuts so I used them instead. I didn't have any peanut butter so we skipped that sauce for the end. The sauce can be made spicier with extra red pepper sauce or sprinkling red pepper flakes on it as I did. My husband devoured them. I will definitely make them again.
