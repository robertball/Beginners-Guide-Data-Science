At the risk of sounding like everyone else, this was really good.  I made very few changes based on comments by other reviewers - I used minced garlic instead of powder, basil instead of parsley, and I added a scant 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  I also sauteed the onion and garlic before adding.  Stuffing the uncooked shells eliminated my normal irritation with making manicotti (which is the fragility of the shells).  This pleased both my husband and my two kids, and pleased the most critical of us - me.  I loved loved loved that I was able to make it in the morning and just pop it in the oven at dinnertime.  It made for a very fuss-free evening, and that in itself is worth lots of stars!  Lucky for me it was yummy, too.

Loved it, exactly what I was looking for. I did not use any water, added more garlic and seasonings to give it a little taste: would have been very bland otherwise. Hubby still found it a little bland, I will triple the parmesan next time.  I filled a quart zip bag with the cheese and cut a hole in a corner to fill the noodles, made my life easier.

I thought that this was VERY tasty.  I cooked the noodles, used fresh spinach, & also used my own meat sauce, (skipping the water because I didn't want to ruin the sauce).  Because I skipped the water, I reduced the baking time as well, baking it until the cheese on top was melted.  Oh, I tripled the recipe (because I bought a 5 lb. tub of ricotta) and shared some with my neighbors and they told me that they LOVED it!  Their 5 yr. old told me, "Michele I like your food", what a great compliment! Thanks Ernie!!

I have made Spinach Manicotti similiar to this recipe before. It always turns out excellent. I have tried both ways, pre-cooking the noodles, and adding water to the uncooked version of the recipe. I prefer adding the water, the shells are so much easier to stuff when uncooked. I usually freeze half of the recipe. So easy to just pop in oven next time around. It does not change the taste, etc. of the "sauce" by adding the water. The water is absorbed during the cooking process. Add garlic/cheese bread a salad and glass of wine for a true authenic "Italian Dinner." I totally recommend this recipe~~~~ AAAA++++

AWESOME!! Great base recipe, I did make changes by what I thought would be yummy.. I have never made this before but it is something I always order when I'm out, and after the changes I made it ended up being better then any I have had at a restaurant so far. So, I first of all started with a bag of fresh baby spinach, sauteed it in my wok with a tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, and the onion. I used fresh minced garlic. After letting that saute for a few minutes I added 2 tablespoon of fresh sweet basil from my garden instead of parsley, also added dried basil, oregano,garlic powder, parsley and Italian spice all which were eye-balled amounts(Maybe about a tablespoonish of each.) Also plenty of pepper, and a few dashes of salt. I let saute for a couple more minutes then set aside to let cool so the cheese wouldn't melt when it was mixed together. When cooled I mixed it with the ricotta, parmesan, mozza and the egg. Stuffed in to uncooked manicotti noodles and made sauce like recipe called for. Baked at 375 for an hour. Amazing. Everyone who ate it gave it rave reviews and are already asking when it will be made again. Hope this helps!

i make a dish like this often. i use fresh spinach and chop it, and use real garlic. HINT: to stuff the shells easily, spoon the filling into a plastic storage bag, cut of a little bit of one corner, and pipe it into the tube. will save you alot of time. i also cook the noodles for a few minutes to save on baking time.

This is a great make ahead  party recipe. I spice it up with some cooked Italian sausage, and a pinch or two of crused red pepper. I have also sub. fresh basil for the parsley and I use  1T. of  minced garlic in the ricotta instead of the powder. I serve it with Italian bread and a tossed salad.

Very Good!!! I used the large shells instead of manicotti and precooked them that way I didn't have to water down the sauce. Also I added ground chicken to the mixture (precooked it of course!), it was Fantastic!!!!

This recipe is excellent. I cooked the manicotti first then stuffed by hand- much easier. No need to add water when cooking manicotti first.any leftovers freeze well.

If you can find the Barilla brand of no-cook lasagna sheets, you will probably never buy the tubes again.  Fill a shallow pan with really hot tap water and place the sheets in the pan to soak while you prepare the filling and sauce.  Lay them on paper towels and spread the filling on each sheet, leaving a small border on all sides.  Roll up and place seam-side down in the dish.  This is so easy it's become a staple in our house.  I have also very successfully used fresh spinach....just pulse it in the food processor till it's evenly chopped, and stir in the ricotta, egg, cheese and seasonings of your choice...we like dried basil and garlic pepper.  Using the pre-cooked sheets also allows you to make as many or few as you need...they only need to soak for about ten minutes, till they are nice and pliable, so you have plenty of time to prepare a few more if you find yourself with leftover filling.  And since I don't eat meat but hubby does, it's easy to make some with meat sauce just for him. To me, they taste like freshly-made pasta and the texture comes out perfectly every time.  I hope some of you will try this and share your results.  And thanks to Ernie for a great recipe that can put Italian on the table even on a busy weeknight.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. I will definitely make it again.  I think that next time I will cut the amount of sauce in half, omit the water, and cook the manicotti a head or time.

This recipe was pretty simple to make and the taste is good, but I have to note that the recipe does not call for you to cover the dish during cooking, and I'm wondering if I'm the only person who wound up with burnt cheese on top the first time I made it.  I thought it a bit odd that the recipe didn't say to cover the dish, since every other baked pasta recipe I use calls for you to cover, cook for the first 75% of cooking time, then uncover at the end to let the cheese melt and brown on top, but this is also the first time I've ever made a pasta dish without pre-cooking the noodles, so I thought it best to follow the recipe exactly. I will make this again, but I'll definitely cover for the first 30 minutes and uncover for the last 15.

My family really went crazy over these. Will make again, but the manicotti was a little too al dente for me, so I would boil them first next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the first time I have made a recipe without first reading the reviews, but that didn't hinder this dish from being delish!!  I made a few changes: used oregano instead of parsely, used fresh baby spinach that I chopped, and added a little more garlic powder.  Next time I would make a few changes.  1 jar of sauce with 1 cup of water would have been plenty!!  In the future I will use more garlic, probably fresh minced, sautee the onions and mushrooms before stuffing, and use fresh basil.  Excellent dish and rave reviews from my husband (who is a chef), my inlaws, and my kids!!  I will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

TEN STARS PERFECT !!!  I followed the recipe except used dried parsley instead of fresh.  It didn't say to cover the dish or not - I did use a cover thinking it would help keep in moisture and cook the noodles - it was done in 60 minutes.  Maybe next time I'll try the suggestions of cooking the onions and using minced garlic instead of garlic powder - but the recipe as written was truly a restaurant quality new addition to our rotation.  Thank you Ernie!  *** UPDATE*** I tried a few changes, sauteed the onion and added minced garlic instead of using powder and you really could not tell the difference - so I won't bother adding to the preparation time.  AND DH told me to give this recipe to our favorite chef at our favorite Italian restaurant!!!

This was pretty good, but I think it could've been a lot better with a lot of tweaking. I thought this recipe called for WAY too much spinach - half the spinach would be just fine. I figured out the hard way that when you boil the manicotti rather than adding the water to the sauce, you need a LOT more of the filling because the manicotti get a lot bigger and thus have more room inside to fill. I parboiled the manicotti and omitted the water, and they turned out fine except that it turns out that when you leave them in cool water for a while after parboiling...they continue to soften. Oops. I tried using the ziploc-with-edge-cut-off technique to fill the manicotti, but I found using my fingers to stuff the cheese mixture inside to be much easier. I also found these to be a bit bland, I'll be adding a lot more spice next time, and will go with a tomato-cream sauce instead of plain old tomato. UPDATE: I made this again, this time using the Tomato-Cream Sauce recipe rather than tomato sauce, and it was a lot more flavorful and much better.

Excellent... thank you for sharing!

Par boiled the manicotti (didn't add extra water in the sauce), only problem was my noodles all cracked when I put them in the boiling water.  Next time I will put the noodles in the pot with warm water and let it get to a boil.

Pretty good and definitely easy as far as something like this is concerned.  Next time, maybe I will make my sauce homemade, I think the sauce makes a big difference.

I made this for dinner it was delicious. I did make some changes though I sautéed onions, parsley and minced garlic in light olive oil and added half teaspoon crushed red pepper. I only put half the sauce in the bottom with water and the rest of the sauce (no water) on top of the manicotti and added the mozzarella on top the last 10 minutes. It took 60 minutes total to bake. The shells were so much easier to stuff this way.

This recipe was excellent. The idea of preparing the night before and putting in the refrigerator was priceless as was stuffing the uncooked shells. This recipe was a major time and aggravation saver. A definite keeper.

My family loved it and it was a hit at a potluck. I added some rotisserie chicken (chopped) to half of it for the people "protein-conscious". I also found it easier to put the filling into a ziplock bag and snip a small corner off. It just squirts the filling into the shells more easily.

My husband, the cook, said it needed a little more flavor/seasoning in the filling. I thought it was fine.  We fixed it exactly according to the recipe, but because of the alleged blandness, it gets a 4. Thanks!

One of the BEST dinners ever. You'd think the spinach makes it gaggy, but it doesn't. It's perfect. I've made this at least 8 times in the past year. So so so good....I don't change anything.

This is absolutely delicious!  My husband and I both could not get enough of it!  The only thing I did was I waited until the last 5 minutes to put the cheese on top of the dish.  I also turned the noodles over half way through the cooking so that they would be equally cooked and tender.  This will be made at least once a week at my house!

I also used fresh baby spinach and garlic, although no fresh  herbs. As someone else suggested, I sauteed the onion, garlic, and spinach in olive oil before combining them with the cheese. My preference is to use jumbo shells, just because they are easier to stuff and serve. I bought a 10 oz. box and had plenty left over. I partially cooked the pasta beforehand, so I omitted the water, and I was able to take the manicotti out of the oven 5-10 minutes early.

Very delicious!  I went ahead and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and about 2 tsp of italian seasoning.  I replaced parsley with basil as well.  I used 1 tsp minced garlic and used a little onion powder plus 1 Tbsp of minced onion.  Pretty much the same stuff called for in the recipe just altered a bit to our tastes.  I used the red sauce from a lasagna recipe i found on here (worlds best lasagna) instead and it was perfect!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, we all really loved it!  Oh... I did also cook my manicotti for maybe 3 minutes or so before stuffing them... it worked great on cutting down the cooking time a bit but didn't make them too difficult to stuff!!

This was wonderful!! I did saute the onions, garlic (& I added red pepper) in a little olive oil before mixing in with the cheese and spinach mixture. I also used fresh basil instead of parsley. It has wonderful flavor and I can only imagine it will taste even better tomorrow. I am also going to try freezing some to see how it does when reheated! Very yummy, thank you Ernie!

My hubby swears this is the best manicotti he has ever had! I took the advice of previous posters and sauted my onion and minced garlic before adding them to the filling.  I also browned up 1/2 lb of sausage and added that to the filling as well.  turn out SO yummy! I did have some extra filling left over but it worked great in omlets the next day for breakfast.

This was the best manicotti I have ever had. My mother and I made this for valentines day dinner and she said it also was the best she ever had. It was so creamy inside and you could taste the spinach just slightly at the end of every bite. It was very very good, i would recommend cooking this for any special occasion.

I too used fresh garlic and sautéed with onion before adding to the ricotta. To save a bowl to clean and so my 8yo DD could help, I put all the filling ingredients in a gallon freezer bag and let her mush it all together before snipping the corner to fill the shells. I also used a homemade sauce and served with meatballs and a salad. Another great recipe to prove there's no need to boil your noodles for a baked pasta dish !!!

I love this recipe and so has everyone I've made it for thus far!!! I've made it a few times now and always add more cheese (2 cups mozzarella), use fresh crushed garlic (2-3 cloves) rather than garlic powder, and use 2 cans of lasagna sauce rather than spaghetti sauce - I find it zestier. I also omit the water, because rather than stuff the manicotti shells totally uncooked I cook them partially, and baking in the sauce alone they turn out perfectly. I highly recommend this dish!!!

Really good but I should've used all of the sauce. For some reason I thought it would be too much. Our family of 4 wiped out almost the entire pan! Thank you!

Terriffic recipe. Make sure to use the water. The pasta needs it to thouroughly cook and swell. I should not have omited the water. Tomarrow I plan to add more sauce and cook a little more.

I didn't use garlic powder, I used four cloves of finely minced garlic and added it to the ricotta mixture.  I was concerned the noodles wouldn't get done because it didn't call for them to be boiled first, but they were great!  The only thing I would do different next time - saute the onions and garlic in olive oil for a few minutes before adding it to the ricotta mixture.  (We told my son that the green stuff was parsley, not spinach, and he fell for it.)  For the side I bought a loaf of italian bread, split it lengthwise and laid the loaves crust-side-down on a cookie sheet.  Then I "generously" spread softened butter on each loaf, followed by a sprinkling of garlic powder and salt.  Baked the bread at 350 for a few minutes, long enough to let the butter get melty, then turned on the broiler.  (Thanks Pioneer Woman!)

First time making it, and it was good.  Second time making it....much better!! When I made it the first time, I used only 1/4 c water, and instead of 1 1/2 c mozz cheese, I divided it and used Monterey Jack also. But no where did I see a mention of cook covered, or uncovered.  So I cooked uncovered.....noodles were kind of rubbery, and sauce dried up quite a bit.  SO the second time making it, I cooked covered (w/foil) and sooooooooo much better!!  Noodles were softer, and nice and "saucey"!! My 17 yr old daughter and her boyfriend ate almost ALL of it!!  I just can't tell her it has spinach in it....lol!! It's a great receipe and I'm thankful I found it!!  THANKS!

This turned out great  for me, I doubled the recipe, put it together the  nite before. I tweaked the recipe w/ homemade sauce and used low fat cheese.
 I can see where you could allow this to set overnite, freeze, and thaw to cook later, since it is all about the noodles soaking up extra water and replacing pre-cooking them. I will pass this one along and be sure to save it to my recipe box.

This recipe was fantastic! I made it last night for a small dinner party, and everbody loved it. Some people even went back for thirds. I made a few changes, from the suggestions that I got from others on here. I sauted the spinach, onions, and garlic, to bring out the flavor. I also used real garlic that I roasted. I mixed two sauces one a regular speggetti sauce onion and garlic flavored. The other on I used was Sundried tomato Alfredo to give more of a creamy flavor to the sauce made by Classico. Will definatly make many times again! Thanks for the recipe! Also thanks all for the seggestions!

Delicious! This recipe is a keeper! I tried the ziploc bag to pipe the filling in but I ended up ditching that idea and using another reviewers suggestion of using a baby spoon. That was a quicker, easier way to stuff the filling. One thing I will do next time is sprinkle the cheese topping about 15 mins before done. My cheese looked orange! Nevertheless, it had wonderful flavor. I will make again! 
Thanks!

Fabulous. I made a few adjustments: fresh spinach instead of frozen (wilt for 3-4 minutes in pan with just a tablespoon of water first), added double the amounts of parmesan and garlic, and added basil and oregano. I also prefer to cook the noodles to al dente beforehand. YUM!

Pretty good.  I only used 1 jar of sauce with 3/4c water and it was fine.  I did add fresh basil and fresh spinach.  Didn't sauté anything before adding, and really enjoyed the fresh flavours (all came out soft though after 45 minutes!)  Next time would add more garlic for an extra oomph and more red pepper.

My family (including 5 kids age 8 and younger) devoured this!  There was just enough for all 7 of us to have hearty helpings and seconds.  I added some minced red pepper to the spinach-cheese mixture and doubled the garlic.  Fabulous and so easy!  Everyone wants me to add this recipe to the standard rotation, and I definitely will.  Thanks, Ernie!

Excellent!  This recipe calls for a little too much sauce, especially when diluting with water.  1 jar spaghetti sauce would have been enough for me. I guess it depends on how big your baking dish is. Followed directions exactly (it's much easier to stuff uncooked shells) with exception of adding fresh basil.

This was very good and super easy. Using the ziploc bag with the cut corner makes this very easy to pipe into the manicotti shells and filling the uncooked was a breeze. After reading several reviews I opted to add the water, as the water does cook out over the 45 mins cooking time. I used fresh spinach which I cooked down adding the onions and fresh garlic instead of powder to the spinach as it was cooking; which gave the cheese blend flavor. Great easy dish! Thank you for sharing!

This is an A+++ dish.  You will not be disappointed.  I used freah spinach and did a mixture of my own vegetarian sauce along with off the shelf sauce without the water added.  This is going to become a staple for family dinner.  Kids love it.

I thought this recipe was very good. I followed the directions pretty much exactly but I only used half of the spinach and it was just the right amount for us. Any more than that would have been overpowering! Also, I did end up with quite a bit of sauce and didn't use all of it.

This is a great guide to manicotti. I used frsh minced garlic instead of powder, a little garlic salt, fresh ground pepper, 1 egg, fresh flat Italian parsley, shredded Italian cheeses (Sargento) for my cheese, one 26 oz jar of red sauce with 1 cup of water then drizzled on 15 oz jar of alfredo sauce (about 3/4 of the jar)...baked for about 50 minutes and let it rest for 10 min...it was delish!!!

I made this for girls' game night and served it with a blackberry merlot. Everyone RAVED over how good it was. I was expecting leftovers to last me at least another 2 or 3 meals, but the girls ate it all up and left me with an empty pan! Delicious!

Sooo good! I add extra herbs. Either a blend or basil, parsley and oregano. I also add much more garlic... but we LOVE garlic. I add everything put a little in a dish, microwave and taste it before filling my shells just to make sure it's how I want it. But it is honestly a great start. Many people have asked for this recipe.

Excellent recipe!!  The only things I did different was homemade marinara sauce (didn't have any jar stuff on hand), and I added some baby bella mushrooms (about 3/4c).  This recipe rocks!!

I think this recipe calls for too much water. I should have taken other users advice and just skipped the water. Besides that, it was really good. I used fresh garlic, fresh spinach and sauteed them all together with the onions first. Then added the cheese, egg etc.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and got rave reviews!  I changed it up a little, used only 3/4 of the spinich, and only 1 jar of sauce (prego basil and tomato).  It's relatively easy and tastes fantastic!

This was absolutely delicious!!  Even my finicky eaters munched it up (and while I was making it too!).  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh spinach.  I used the recipe for Very Special Spaghetti Sauce (which I found on here) as well.  Very, very good and thank you for sharing!!

This recipe is very good! I browned 1 lb ground beef and 1 link of Italian sausage together and added to the cheese mixture. I also used half package of ricotta and half package cottage cheese. I used Marinara sauce and it was delicious!! My kids complained about the spinach, but you have to sneak veggies in somehow!!!! I will make again!!  Served with buttered french bread and seasoned fine green beans.

This was excellent. Very easy once you get the hang of it; I've made it several times. Be sure you have enough sauce to cover the manicotti noodles and that your oven is hot enough (made it in two different ovens; one was not hot enough and the noodles took FOREVER to cook!) I used fresh basil instead of parsley, and canned diced tomatoes instead of prepared sauce. I also used refrigerated minced garlic instead of powder. I get rave reviews for this one whenever I make it - and everyone thinks it's such a difficult dish! Only you'll know the secret...

It came out looking wonderful, but the cheese mixture was very bland. Almost no flavor at all. The concept was good, but I would definitely add salt, real garlic instead of the powder, basil, and less spinach.

My husband, who is very picky, ate two big platefuls of this.  And my seventeen year old told me that it's better than the manicotti at her favorite Italian restaurant!  I used fresh chopped spinach and added Italian seasoning to the filling.  It was probably about 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, but I didn't measure.  I also left the cheese off the top until the last 15 minutes of baking so that it would not burn.  Served with a fresh salad and homemade bread.  I had intended to freeze the leftovers for another evening, but there weren't enough!  I will definitely make this again.

First time making manicotti, and these were great. Unfortunately, they don't look nearly as pretty coming out of the over as they do going in! 
I will probably use 3/4 of the sauce next time (boyfriend agreed way too saucy). I did not cook the pasta ahead of time and can't imagine filling those suckers after!! I also HIGHLY recommend using either a pastry bag or a ziploc bag with a hole cut in the corner to fill the noodles. Makes a HUGE difference!

Great Recipe! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I also used homemade manicotti shells (recipe from AR). It tasted like something from a resturaunt. We are actually having the leftovers tonight for dinner, and I will be making this next weekend when my family comes to visit.

This is an excellent recipe!  I follow as is but I do  add 1/2 tsp each of basil & oregano to the filling.  Also, for a variation I have used cooked lasagna noodles instead of the manicotti.  I spread the filling on the lasagna noodle, roll it up & bake with sauce on the bottom of the dish & spaghetti sauce & mozzarella cheese on top.  I don't add the water doing it this way because the noodles are already cooked.  I usually get about 8 nice sized "roll ups" doing it this way.  When I have used the manicotti, I have had to bake longer for the noodles to be tender.

I used a little more spinach stuffed inside and more cheese on the outside! It was wonderful, the whole family loved it! Stuffing the shells is an art; my husband split two before I made him stop and let me do it.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was really good - very flavorful and the manicotti was cooked perfectly!  I followed some reviewers' advice and...

* Added fresh chopped garlic
* Added fresh chopped onion
* Added fresh chopped basil
* Used only 1 jar of tomato sauce plus 1+ cups water
* Used a Ziploc bag to pipe the filling into the uncooked manicotti (so much easier!)

I used reduced fat ricotta and frozen chopped spinach.  I also used freshly grated Parmesan cheese.   

I will definitely make again!   (Even my 20-month-old and 5-year-old ate it!)

My boyfriend really loved these. I sauteed chicken in olive oil, garlic, and rosemary, then chopped into fairly small pieces. I sauteed fresh baby spinach lightly in the oil from the chicken sautee, then mixed with other ingredients from the recipe and followed the direction. Really great!

Fabulous recipe and even though a little work, lots of fun to make!  My kids loved it!  My 3 year old actually ate something I made (he's very picky!) and my 6 year old told me she now loves spinach!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe! I followed the recipe except made my own sauce (mainly b/c I am currently living out of the country and jarred pasta sauces are too pricey).

Made this recipe tonight for dinner. I wanted to create a "lower fat" version so I omitted  mozzarella cheese and halved the parmesan cheese. I used light riccotta as well. I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder and used basil instead of parsley. I shredded about 1 cup light cheddar cheese on top instead of mozza (just our preference). It was delicious! Next time I will make ground meat pasta sauce for my husband to go on top or add meatballs on the side as he felt it was "too light" to be main course.

I made this the night before taking it to my small group for our dinner.  I made it exactly as written except I subbed 3 cups of homemade marinara sauce that I had in the freezer for one of the jars of spaghetti sauce.  I also did not have chopped spinach, so used leaf instead.  I should have chopped it first. Although it did not detract from the flavor, it was a bit stringy. My bad. I shredded fresh mozzarella and grated the Parmesan myself.  My concern that the shells would not be done without pre-cooking, was unfounded. They were fine. Served with garlic bread and a tossed green salad, the manicotti was well received. Several folks went back for seconds and two requested the recipe. I served a light dessert of rainbow sherbet and cookies to round out the meal. I will definitely make this again, adding Italian spice, some basil and fresh minced garlic to make it a bit spicier.

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly and got wonderful results, however, I always hate stuffing the manicotti shells!

this recipe was great. i did add a little more garlic and used fresh spinach and fresh basil. i also doubled the recipe,stuffed uncooked manicotti,put them back in the trays and froze them to make later in the week. just put them in the fridge the night before. pour sauce over the noodles and cover tightly with foil and bake for about 45 minutes removing foil for the last 15 minutes.

Made exactly as written and found it a bit bland... If I make again I'll be cutting back on the water and adding more spices.

This was an excellent recipe!! I was skeptical about not cooking the noodles beforehand, but after about 55 minutes in the oven they were perfect! I made two pans for a crowd of 15 and everyone loved it! Two little modifications I did was to add sweet italian sausage (I browned it up and put it on top of both layers of sauce), and since I didn't have enough mozarella I topped the whole thing with extra parmesan. AWESOME! Served with homemade garlic bread and a fresh green salad, big hit!

I left out the spinach because I didn't have any, and I added ground beef.  This was a good recipe though, I will be using it from now on.

I changed quite a bit, but loved the basic concept and in the end, I produced a really tasty manicotti. I cooked my manicotti only for 6 minutes so they were easy to handle. I didn't use an egg or any water. I used a garlic flavoured shredded cheese (I believe that means garlic butter is added) and I mixed that into the ricotta mixture as well as used it for topping. I added some breadcrumbs to the topping - cooked covered for 25 mins, uncovered for 5 and a couple on broil. AMAZING.

Excellent recipe. Modifications - fresh spinach, lots of fresh chopped garlic and chopped onions - all sauteed in olive oil.  Added a mix of ground sirloin and italian sausage.

I was sorely disappointed after trying this recipe.  The filling itself is tasty enough, but my manicotti pasta did not cook properly in the sauce.  The pasta was gummy and mushy.  I was so sad!  I may use the filling again, but next time I will cook the pasta separately!  Oh well, you live, you learn!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly, except it took an additional 15 minutes in the oven.  My wife orders manicotti quite often when we are out.  She said this is the best she's ever had.  We also made alfredo sauce (from this site) to go over the manicotti on the plate.  We will make often!!!

Wow!! This was *the best* Manicotti I have ever eaten! Even my daughter who eats nothing, went back for seconds! My husband, he went back for thirds!
I sauteed fresh spinach, minced garlic, & Italian seasoning with a tablespoon of olive oil & added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese to the mix & a bit more on top too. I didn't pre-cook the shells & I didn't add the water either, I just cooked it for 5 minutes longer. It was PERFECT! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Yes, this was very good.  I precooked the manicotti, and skipped the water in the sauce.  Also sauteed the onions with crushed garlic before adding. I followed a tip from another reviewer to put the filling into a large ziploc bag, cut off a corner, and use it to squeeze the filling into the noodles.  It worked great- but only cut a bit of the corner of the bag off.  To much, and the filling just plops out!

Pretty darn good. Husband was very impressed he did not even notice it was vegetarian. I did add more cheese and cottage cheese to the filling. I also added Italian seasoning, dried basil and fresh garlic. I don't know if it made a difference but it sure wasn't bland. I will definitely make again.

This is really great!  Made exactly as written except I used fresh spinach and real garlic and it was wonderful!  I would suggest spicing it a little more, maybe a little salt.  Would be easier with the fresh spinach to use the big pasta shells than manicotti.  Next time!

Yum this was superb!  I made a few changes though.  Added 1/2lb ground italian sausage -- cooked this with onions, real minced garlic, red pepper flakes, and a dash of Mrs. Dash.  Let cool a bit and then added to the cheese/spinach mixture.  Used the ziploc bag trick which worked great!  I actually had some left over (enough for another 3 manicottis probably).  I only added 1 cup water and man there was a lot of sauce (made my own)!  Will make again.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  Definitely use a bag for piping the filling into the shells.  I, too, didn't add water to the sauce.  It would have been way too watery otherwise.  Sauce alone was perfect.  And it froze and reheated heavenly.

Great recipe.  I made mucho changes because I didn't have all the required ingredients.  Substituted Romano Cheese for the Parmesian.  Used canned spinach instead of frozen.  Added a handful of currents and a little pignoli nuts for some crunch factor.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used Ragu Alfredo Sauce.  I also cut up small and fried in olive oil some mushrooms to add into the mixture.  Lastly, I didn't have manicotti shells on hand, so I used jumbo shells instead.  All these flavors came together deliciously, thanks to the basic recipe's foundation.  This one is a keeper for sure.

This is a very good recipe - the ease of filling the uncooked shells was great. I used the smooth type of shells (no fluting or ridges) and the consistency was perfect.

I wish I could rate 4-1/2 stars because although it is good, it is a tiny bit bland. I used chopped fresh garlic, an Italian herb blend, and used additional parmesan cheese. The filling was allowed to sit in the refrigerator for a full day. Regardless of the sauce used, a little crushed red pepper would have gone nicely.

I will make this again, and would definitely make for company!

Absolutely fabulous. I've tried a lot of recipes from this site, and this is one of the best. I made a few tiny changes: used 1 tsp basil instead of parsley, 3 cloves minced garlic (kind from the jar), and baked 60 minutes. I was worried about the uncooked noodles and extra water, but it turned out great!

I love that I don't have to cook the manicotti noodles! My tips: Putting the filling in a ziploc and cutting off the corner made it easy and fun to fill the shells. Use *real* parmesan cheese not Kraft shaker cheese for authentic flavor. A dash of nutmeg enhances the ricotta mix and finally, use sauce you love since it will infuse into the uncooked noodles, I chose an Italian sausage and pepper sauce to square off all 4 food groups. Mangia!

This was turned out very good.  The secret to stuffing the shells is to use a very small spoon such as a baby spoon.  Stuffing the shells becomes fast and easy.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, 1 tsp dried basil instead of parsley, 2 cloves of garlic in place of garlic powder and reduced the water to 1 cup.  I baked covered for 80 min. and the noodles were perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

fabulous!  I made this last night for my husband and some guests, and was told by my husband (who is also a professional chef) that it was the best he'd ever had.  I didn't do manicotti, I turned them into ravioli, but the flavor is the same.  If you choose to do ravioli, make sure when you put the filling into a bag to pipe it, that the hole is large enough, as the spinach is a little difficult to get out.  Very flavorful, and will definately make again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I *loved* this recipe. My entire family did! The only changes I made to this recipe was to use garlic cloves instead of powder. I also used fresh pasta. I cooked it before baking, so I did not need extra water with the sauce. The pasta was cut into 4" squares, cooked, then I lay the filling at the edge of sheets, and rolled up. placed in pan seam side down.  I also layered it with homemade marinara sauce, and alfredo sauce. This is the best recipe I have so far found on this site, it was just amazing! Thank you!!!

I loved this recipe!  It was easy to make and everyone in my family loved it!  I added ground beef to the sauce, added mushrooms and crushed red pepper to the spinach mixture, and used twice the amount of spinach that the recipe called for.  A new family favorite!

I've been using this recipe for years, but hated how long it took to boil pasta,drain,stuff.  It is a definate time saver to stuff uncooked manicotti and add water to the sauce!  Thank you!!  Also used fresh garlic in place of garlic powder.

It was ok - definately needs some sort of spicing up.  Pretty bland - even after I added Italian sausage.

DELICIOUS. My modifications were fresh spinach, which I wilted in a little hot olive oil, fresh scallions and fresh garlic. I stuffed the shells uncooked as the recipe directed, but I reduced the water added to the dish by a 1/2-cup. It was only slightly watery when fully cooked and by left-over night, it wasn't watery at all. I was generous with the mozarella and freshly grated parmesan to our taste. I will make this again!

I made the recipe just as written but thought the onion overpowering. Perhaps is was just that onion, but thought to flag it. And no, I typically don't have any issue with either onion or garlic. next time, I think I'll used the stuffing I made for stuffed shells instead. I used a baby spoon to stuff the shells, and it was really easy that even the kids helped and no shells broke.

Overall (as it is written) this was just a meh recipe for me.  The filling seriously lacked on flavor and store bough sauce isn't notorious for it's robust flavors. None of these problems can't be remedied by some oregano, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper and a nice wine based homemade sauce.

Fortunately it's a quick cook if you boil the manicotti for 7-8 minutes first (just long enough to get your stuffing made) And it looks pretty impressive when you have company over!!

Followed recipe as written.  Very good but next time will probably either cut onion amount in half or eliminate it all together.  Used Ragu Original Sauce.  Liked that I didn't have to pre-cook the manicotti...made it much easier to fill with the mixture.  Thanks for posting!

I don't pre-cook my noodles... I add half the water, and only in the jar that is going on the base of the pan. (If i am not making homemade sauce.) I also saute onions & diced mushrooms with garlic for the stuffing. I sometimes add Italian sausage as well, depending on my mood. The flavor wasn't here though, you need a LOT more spices unless the sausage is added.But even with that, I nearly use two tablespoons of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of oregano,basil, or thyme; and of course pepper and a little bit of salt. It's a GREAT BASE recipe for sure!!!!

just like everyone else has mentioned this recipe was a hit with everyone who ate it. However I did make a few changes, one being I cut back on the amount of sauce used, I used one jar plus the water and it was perfect, I also subbed frozen kale (thawed and squeezed dry). This one is a keeper.

This dish is superb! I put crumbled sausage in the cheese mixture and this added a while different level of flavor. I have made this dish three times and each time has been a delightful treat.

I'm generally not a fan of manicotti, but LOVED this.  I omitted the water, and added roasted garlic per request of my husband.  We now enjoy this once a month!

Very good, but I have made this using nutmeg in the filling and found it much better.  Also, if you have manicotti tubes, you can boil them and then split them to fill.  Just place seem side down and no one will know!  So much quicker and easier!

It's a great comfort food dish - I used to make a similar version with ground beef but I like this version even more since it is vegetarian style.  I usually add shredded basil and mushrooms and sometimes substitute the jars of spaghetti sauce with my homemade sauce (from the freezer) or jars of chopped tomatoes. I also add minced garlic.  Greet recipe, wonderful dish good enough for company.

These were very good. Will be making these again for sure. 6-20-16: This is an update to my first rating. Still receives the 5 stars.  I made these several times, cooking the noodle first.  I was unsure about using uncooked shells, well this time I made them using uncooked shells. They came out terrific. Will be making with uncooked from now on.

My husband who always asks, "Where's the meat" actually liked this one.  I added cooked fresh mushrooms to the filling and left out the onions (since I don't like onions) and I replaced basil for the parsley.  It was very good.  Also...put the filling in a plastic bag; cut a TINY hole in the corner and pipe into the manicotti that has been cooked al dente (7 minutes in salted water).

Easy to make and delicious...My kind of recipe!  The only change I made was to use one 26oz can of spaghetti sauce (instead of two).  It was very saucy and more than enough.  Two would've been way to much.  I will definately make this again.

This was pretty good and I would make again based mainly on the fact that you don't have to boil the noodles!  This was very easy and tasty.  I am sure you could make a few at a time and freeze them for some easy weeknight meals during the cold winter months.

LOVED IT! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. I boiled my noodles for 5 minutes only. They were still plenty stiff enough for stuffing. I made the spaghetti sauce with hot italian sausage and seasoned it like I usually do - sauteed onion, minced garlic, basil, rosemary, parsley, salt and pepper. I added half a bar of cream cheese and a pinch of nutmeg to the ricotta filling. WONDERFUL RECIPE!!

Made exactly as written - very good and so easy. Only 1 dirty bowl for mixing, used this same bowl to mix water and sauce (I used 1 traditional prego and 1 traditional ragu) and 1 dish for baking. Used gallon size ziploc with corner cut off to fill shells  Love this and will make again. Kids did not even ask about the spinach. Great recipe.

Best manicotti ever! The onion really makes the difference. I had boiled the shells before I read the recipe, so I shortened the cooking time to 40 minutes, other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Very tasty. I added a pound of fried ground beef  (seasoned with basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper) and a can of mushrooms to the tomato sauce (husband refuses to eat a meal without meat, ha!). To fill the manicotti, I used a butter knife to get the filling in - worked well.

Really good! I have recently become a vegetarian and I have been really excited to try this out. I finally got to try it out tonight. I added sauteed  chopped broccoli, onions, mushrooms and minced garlic. I used the Ziploc makeshift pastry bag method to stuff the shells. Some parts of the shells seemed a bit too hard, I'm going to read through the rest of reviews the next time I make this to see if there is any way to prevent that. 

Otherwise, it was a beautiful meal. My boyfriend, who, to put it mildly, hasn't really taken to my new vegetarian diet, loved this. He went back for seconds even though he said he was full before I brought my first helping out. We can wait to try the leftovers. Thanks for posting!

My whole family LOVES this meal. My kids have asked for it to be put on the meal schedule every month, and my husband plans his schedule to be home when we have this manicotti!  The only change I made was to use basil instead of parsley, but I'm sure it is delish with the parsley, too.  Love stuffing the uncooked shells -- so much easier!

This was just okay. I will not make again. It was pretty bland tasting to me. Also, the shells were a bit tough. I like my pasta al dente, but this was a little too al dente and I left in the oven for 55 min. I agree with another reviewer who said that the recipe on the pasta box would have been tastier. :-(

WOW!  My whole family loved it.  I used Cottage cheese rather than the ricotta cheese (little local store did not carry ricotta cheese) and it turned out great.  I covered mine to bake, then reheated them the next day without the cover and they were perfect.

This turned out great.  Next time, I'll wait to add the cheese on top until about 15 minutes before it is done cooking.  That will give the sauce a chance to evaporate and prevent the cheese from getting too brown.

This was delicious!  But there was a little too much sauce.  I will definitely be making it again, but perhaps without quite as much water added to the sauce.

I give this recipe 4 stars, but with the suggestions of the reviewers, it's a 5.  I doubled the recipe, and that made 2 full pans.  One pan will make 14 manicotti tubes and will feed 4 adults and 3 kids easily (with leftovers).  I used onion powder instead of minced onion (what I had on hand), minced garlic, and added red pepper to the sauce as suggested by reviewers.  I added 1.5 tsp. for the double recipe, and it was great.  I am looking forward to taking the extra pan out of the freezer in a couple of weeks to enjoy again.  I recommend making this the night before and having only your baking to do for dinner, especially during the week.  Fantastic!

I made this for dinner last night, and it was excellent.  Per other reviews, I added more garlic, basil, and onion.  I liked the ease of stuffing the uncooked shells - after 55 min. they came out perfect!  I will definitely be making this again!

Never made stuffed manicotti before and was amazed this worked out! Based on previous reviews - a few changes I made included reducing the water to 1C, adding fresh basil and dried Italian herbs. I didn't add the parmesan (sauce is already salty) and onion (when raw it's overpowering). Next time I think adding olives and artichokes would be a nice addition.

This turned out great. The only thing I added to it was using fresh garlic, and I also chopped up some basil to go in with the spinach. I mean come on; spinach and basil are always destined to be with one another! :) I also didn't boil the noodles beforehand; I managed to stuff them without any hassle, from one end to the other.

This was easy to make and hearty, but I think it could use more flavour. Next time I will add more garlic, some basil and oregano, and a higher ratio of parmesan to mozzarella. Thanks!

precook the pasta and skip the water or add very little. Dont over-stuff the manicotti or you will run out of filling. Great tasting recipe, makes the best kind of leftovers -gone in no time!

I made this in the crockpot, although I didn't have regular spinach so I used creamed spinach, a package of slice fresh mushrooms and a TBSP of minced garlic, I also put some dried Italian herbs and I added a little bit of water. I put the crockpot on high and it took about 4 hours.  I mixed the cheeses together with the onion,mushrooms and garlic and creamed spinach and put it in a plastic bag and filled the shells. I forgot to put the egg in but I didn't think it made a difference.

Made this 2 nights ago and used the fresh homemade manicotti (from this site) and it was so delicious.  One friend was vegetarian so I left it as is, but the rest of us sprinkled hamburger over ours.  Would be excellent with sausage also.

Great dish!  It will be added to the rotation.  Like others, I left out the water.  I also didn't use any Parmesan.  The only thing I will do different next time is saute the onions a little before adding them to the mixture.  They weren't quite done to my liking.

This was a great dish! I had never made manicotti by myself before and this was easy to follow. I did take some suggestions from other reviews and didn't use the water. It was very easy to fill the tubes without precooking them first. I will be making this more often.

Very good!    I followed the recipe very closely, including mixing the sauce with water.  I prepared the night before, refridgerated, and baked as directed - uncovered.  Nice results, pasta was cooked thoroughly.  I used fresh mozzarella, fresh (wilted & squeezed) spinach, and fat-free ricotta.  Tasty results, will make again.

I first made this about a year ago since my boyfriend really likes Manicotti. However, he doesn't really eat any type of veggies. I made it still for me and the kids. He absolutely fell in love with it. He said it was the best. Better than any other Manacotti he has ever had in restaurants.   I used the no boiled lasagna noodle instead of the shell. I soaked the noodle in hot water and spreaded the cheese mixture onto the noodle and rolled it up. And used all fresh spices plus extra cheese because everyone in my family are cheese nuts. It was out of this world good. This will be a recipe thats going to be pass down to my kids for sure.

This tastes like spinach lasagna. It was very flavorful. I halved the recipe and wished I had made all of it. Next time will freeze half and cook half. I had left over filling that I used to make stuffed mushrooms.

I've made this both with cooked manicotti and without cooking the manicotti first.  Both worked out great!  I even froze half the recipe and cooked it a couple months later, which tasted just as good as the original batch.  Highly recommend.

The first time I ever made this recipe I did it by the book.  Turned out great.  Since I have made it a bunch of times always mixing things up.  Tonight I put cooked lean ground hamburger (seasoned with paprika, chili seas., celery salt, minced garlic and pepper) in with the stuffing mix.  Makes the batch of mix larger so you have to compensate the amount of noodles you use.  I LOVE the fact I don't have to precook the noodles..3 boys plus the big one and I all really enjoy this special recipe. Thank you for adding it.

This recipe is very delicious. We followed the recipe exactly except no parsley and added some seasoned ground beef on top. We cooked 1 pound of ground beef and then added it on top during the last 5 minutes of baking time. It came out delicious!

Made this for a family dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it! It came together very fast, and it was much easier stuffing the uncooked noodles. I made a few small changes after reading the comments (sauteed onions and minced garlic, used basil instead of parsley). Would definitely make again.

It was my first time making this recipe and it turned out excellent! The only midifications I made were, I boiled the pasta first, which reduced the cooking time in the oven and I used 1 can of tomato sauce instead of 2. Perfect recipe for a beginner ;)

This manicotti was really good - came just short of being great. I thought it was too heavy on the onions - I will reduce or eliminate the onions next time.   The noodles can be hard to stuff. I tried cutting a ziplock to create a makeshift pastry filler, but ultimately found it was easiest to use my hands.

4 1/2 stars actually.  Seems weird adding water to the sauce but it does bake out and doesn't ruin the sauce.  I made the stuffing of the manicotti super easy by using a Wilson cupcake decorator.  I seasoned the spinach with salt and garlic powder prior to adding to the cheese mix.  Spinach can be very bland if it is not seasoned correctly.  Needed to bake 60 minutes.  I made a double batch and froze for next time. Even the kids enjoyed.

The filling is absolutely wonderful. I only had a partial package of Manicotti so after filling those I placed shell pasta next to them topped the shells with the rest of the filling and added the sauce and cheese as directed and it turned out great. Delicious!!!

This was really good!  I did not use water, and it really doesn't need it.  That being said, it results in a thicker sauce and requires a longer cooking time, I cooked mine about an hour (half hour covered, the other half uncovered).  I used chopped garlic, added oregano and covered the top with about a cup of shredded mozzarella.  Even my 3 year old ate it!

This is absolutely delicious!  The whole family loved this dish.  I made the recipe just as it's listed - well, I "eyeballed", rather than measured some ingredients, but it was pretty close.  If you are looking for something classy and elegant to serve to guests, or just something special for a family dinner - this is the perfect pasta dish!

This was excellent and very easy to make. As per another viewers suggestion, I stuffed by piping the cheese mixture through a ziplock bag.

This recipe is great the way it is! A real pleaser. I prefer meatless dishes and my fiancee is a real meat and potatoes kind of guy. However, this meal had him saying he would be a vegetarian if everything tasted that good! It's great on a cold day. The only thing I changed was boiling the noodles for about 7 minutes just to where they were starting to become tender so I did not have to water down the sauce. For easy filling of the manicotti noodles, try cutting the corner off of a sandwich bag and piping it into the noodle. Worked great and I didn't have one noodle break!

A family favorite.   Sometimes I mince a clove of garlic instead of using the garlic powder and cut down on the amount of spaghetti sauce and water.  I make this dish whenever I take dinner to a family with a new baby.  Accompanied by garlic bread, salad, and dessert, it's a delicious meal that everyone raves about.

Had this last night, everyone liked it.  So convienient to make it the night before, cover it, then take out of the fridge 30 minutes before baking uncovered.  This easily fed 5 with half of it leftover (we also had bread & salad).  Thanks

This is a really good base recipe. I do agree with some of the others that there is just a little bit to much spinach but its still very tasty. i cut the water down to one cup. still to much sauce but its better to have too much then too little. i was kinda affraid to add water to my sauce because its my scratch but it came out perfect. love it.

We liked this recipe.  My husband had never tried manicotti, so he was pretty skeptical.  It turned out he really liked it! I liked it because of the ease!  It is sooo much more quick and easy to stuff hard shells! I also used the ziplock baggie trick to fill them, which worked fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, and added 1/3 cup of mushrooms and green peppers.  I sauteed the onions, mushrooms and with minced garlic for about 5 minutes.  I also added Mrs. dash tomato, basil and garlic seasoning.  . The next day put alfredo sauce on the left overs.  Simply Delicious!

I made this and followed the recipe exact and for some reason when I served it hot out of the oven... it was very runny. The ricotta mixture was almost too soupy like although the taste was okay I was more concerned as to why the ricotta was so runny. I thawed and dried the spinach really well before adding it to the recotta (I even used a mini strainer and really got the excess water out of it). BUT to my surprise the leftovers were amazing. It thickened up over night in the fridge and really made an awesome lunch the next day. That's why this recipe gets three stars instead of the 2 i was gonna give it. Not one of my boyfriends favorites. BUT hey you can't please everyone.

This was extremely easy and tasted great! I always use uncooked manicotti and it's so easy and faster too.

Thought is was yummy and easy -- made it in the morning and baked it in the evening.  Next time I will use a little basil and maybe even some red pepper, just for a little more flavor.  There sure was a lot of sauce ...

This was delicious - got lots of compliments.  Since I was making it for the first time for company I was scared to try the uncooked manicotti, so cooked it before stuffing it and eliminated the water.  I plan to try it with the uncooked manicotti next time because that would be way easier.  Only other change was real garlic instead of garlic powder.  The proportions were perfect, exactly enough stuffing for all shells with no waste.  It is important to use a good sauce for this - I used Barilla Basil and Tomato which was good but maybe not my favorite.  This is a great recipe - thank you Ernie for sharing!

Didn't add the water.  Prepared it all except baking it in the a.m. and put it in the fridge.  Baked it that evening and the sauce was nice and thick and the noodles were perfect al dente.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe is really amazing. I got three boys who HATE spinach to literally clean the pan and ask for more!! The only change I made was to  use alfredo sauce instead of red sauce. So so so good!!

Excellent recipe to build on.  I also subbed in basil and used fresh spinach that I cooked down with the onion and garlic.  I can't stand the taste of frozen spinach.  I use my own tomato sauce recipe for my lasgnana.  I make it thick and super seasoned so that the taste doesn't get overwhelmed by the other ingrediants.  It's really easy.  A couple of can of diced tomatoes, a couple of fresh tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic, an onion, salt and pepper to taste.  I add a some water, just depends on how the sauce is turning out.  If you add too much water, you can always just cook it down to your desired consistancy.  Excellent Manicotti!

Excellent!  Next time I will make some minor changes and I think it will be even better.  These are the changes I will make next time: Use 1/2 ricotta 1/2 cottage cheese, substitute basil for the parsley, put cheese on during last 10 minutes, real garlic instead of powder and I agree with a previous review...use a sauce you love!!  Serving garlic bread with this dish is a must!

Full flavor, wonderful. Even my meat-and potatoes boyfriend loved this meatless dish. 
Sauce looks like a lot, but it cooks down just perfect.

recipe is ok, but not not restaurant quality.  it loses texture and strength of sauce when prepared without cooking the pasta first.  would not try this one again.

I made this dish as posted and used Amato's pasta sauce in a jar. The dish turned out awesome, and I will make it again in the future. Seems that the cheese you put on in the end will thicken up the sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My husband first turned his nose up when I told him what we were having for dinner but when he saw the filling he said it didn't look to bad.  I did have to have him help me stuff the shells.  We used the zip loc bags as suggested.  I think i par boiled the shells just a tad to long because some split on us. I may try them dry next time and use a pastry bag. I used ground deer meat with lots of garlic added.  I used only one jar of spaghetti sauce and i used alfredo sauce instead of making the white sauce.  I forgot the parmesan cheese.  My husband loved these and he is not a big pasta fan at all.  My son-in-law ate four but had trouble get the fourth one down because he was so full but would not stop eating.  I always wanted to try manicotti.  thanks for the recipe!

I used fresh Basil instead of the parsley and it was AWESOME!  I didn't really measure my cheese, but you can never have too much cheese.  I did start off stuffing my shells with a spoon, but found it much more helpful to just get my hands dirty!  Can't wait to try it using chicken.

Delicious! Made it with the additions of fresh garlic and red pepper flakes  and basil instead of parsley. Also I folded carmelized onions and zucchini in with the ricotta mixture. Husband declared it the best dinner I’ve ever made!!  I’d say make half the sauce first using just one jar of tomato sauce because I ended up with too much sauce even though I filled the my lasagna pan to the absolute brim. If you had a super deep pan you were working with maybe you’d want that extra sauce? I just cooked it down to a pizza sauce and made pizza a few days later. Note - this is a fun one if you have older-ish kids. My 12 year old daughter helped me fill the uncooked shells And requested we make this again for her birthday. (Joy!)

I've made this recipe multiple times and it has always been a big hit whether it's for dinner or for a potluck. It freezes really well and is a great make-ahead dish. I have used both frozen and fresh spinach and they taste the same; i usually go for whatever is convenient for me to find. I also always end up adding in extra spices and herbs since I like it with a lot of flavor. One thing that I usually do is taste the cheese mixture before adding in the egg; if the cheese mixture is seasoned how I want it, I know that it'll taste great. I also like to boil the manicotti ahead of time to save baking time. I've also used shells before to make stuffed shells and it has equally came out amazing. Instead of just regular tomato sauce, I like to make a meat sauce instead since my family  loves meat.

Tasted amazing! Didn’t cover it with sauce on the top so the shells stayed hard. So just make sure the shell is completely covered for best taste! But overall a really great recipe!

Make this regularly, we love it. I add black olives and mushrooms. I stuff the shells precooked, and could not imagine stuffing them soft. That seems like it would be a miserable way to make this. Delicious dish!

Making this frequently, l just add a pound of sweet Italian sausage, a jar of Bartolli marinara sauce, instead of spaghetti sauce, and a 50/50 mixture of cottage cheese and ricotta cheese for my filling. (Like the meat in my manicotti and the cottage cheese bulks the filling up a little). But what l really want to share with you is... filling those darn tubes. While making one time l thought it would be great if you could put the filling in a caulking gun to fill with. Well guess what? They make a device for that.  It's called a jerky gun. It's essentially a caulk gun made for food. Picked one up for about 5 bucks as l recall. Plastic, spin off canister, fill your tube, 1/2 the time and virtually no mess at all. Can fill 5 tubes with 1 fill of the canister. Whether you cook your tubes or leave them uncooked, the 4" nozzle on the end makes it a breeze to stuff your stuff. Takes the pain out of stuffing those tubes. Hope this helps.

My husband called it "awesome!" I did add a pound of hot Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled; and I added about 5 ounces of chopped fresh baby spinach to the frying pan after draining the grease.  I LOVED that by thinning the sauce with water, I could fill and bake the pasta without cooking it first.

Husband loved it! He's from NYC, knows good food and is pretty picky, he couldn't stop raving.  I used more sauce than directed, and added fresh parsley and basil.  I recommend piping the mixture into the shells via ziplock bag. A keeper for sure.

My family loved it... Its easy and rich. I was a little worry that the noodles won't need to be boiled first, but it cooked very well.
Thanks for the recipe. definitely will make again.

I made this with fresh spinach, and I added 1lb of sweet Italian sausage, and only a small amount of water, so it did take almost an hour to cook so the pasta was soft. It was delicious!!!!

loved it.  It was my first time making manicotti and it was a huge hit at my dinner party.  The hardest part was stuffing the shells.  I used a plastic bag with a corner cut off, which helped some, but I still found myself having to use my fingers to push in the cheesy goodness.  I used uncooked pasta.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and when I took it out to bake, the noodles were already soft.   I will definitely make again for other special occasions.

I made this exactly as written and was really disappointed.  Really?  2 jars of spaghetti sauce?   Couldn't taste that the filling was bland because I could only taste the sauce, which out of a can isn't good to begin with. The pasta was undercooked.   I gave it two stars because it was easy to make.  Won't be making this again.

I used fresh mozzarella and added Italian seasoning and cut the water down to 1 Cup because of the fresh mozzarella. I also used fresh garlic and fresh spinach. It was a huge hit and so flavorful and delicious. I will use this recipe again.

I only used a cup of water but it took 60 minutes or more to cook the pasta through. I added salt to the cheese stuffing and a few other flavorings because the basic recipe seemed too bland. I also used an Italian mix instead of straight mozzarella for the same reason.

I made a beef and tomato sauce to coat this. Used fresh spinach (that I didn't cook first) and it came out okay. Do not cook the manicotti prior to stuffing. The noodles will soften fine if barely floating in a deep dish with sauce and covered with tin foil. This recipe was a great guideline for what I was hoping to create on my own. Next time I'll either use the frozen spinach or cook the fresh stuff I'm using.

My husband and kids loved this! I doubled up on the ricotta cheese mixture, but that was the only change that I made. I also added the cheese only during the last 5-10 mins of baking. I used uncooked Manicotti shells and it baked up beautifully - and it was so much easier to stuff! Will make this again!

The four stars are for the filling, which (with minor changes) was excellent.  Mindful of other reviewers who said the filling was bland, I increased the onion to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning.  I used 1/3 cup filling per shell and got 20 shells, which just filled my 9x13 pan.

For the cheese topping, which I waited to add until the manicotti was nearly heated through, I increased to 1 cup Mozzarella and 1/2 cup Parmesan.  Topped with chopped fresh basil for a restive look.

The biggest change (and the reason for subtracting one star) was not to use store bought shells; instead, I used the All Recipes Manicotti Shells recipe.  So. Much. Better.  To accommodate this change, I omitted the water.  Also, 1 1/2 cups sauce was plenty.  With these changes dinner was a great success, and I'm already planning to serve it at my next dinner party.

It was good. I forgot to add the water and part of the shells were crunchy. Oppsie. We added a pound of ground Italian Sausage. It was too much so we added more of the other ingredients. I liked that the shells were not cooked because otherwise I would have stuffed them too much.  This way you could scoop them up by the shell.   I also had to extra stuffed shells that I could not fit in the pan. I cooked them about 5 days later and they were even better.

The filling is nice and I really liked that I didn't have to boil the manicotti ahead of time. It's an easy dish to make and can make ahead of time. Plus it reheats nicely. (Besides, we all know that Italian food is always better the next day)

5 stars with these changes: lightly sauteed 10oz fresh spinach, drained and cooled before adding to cheese; sauteed onion and fresh minced garlic (2-3 cloves), cooled before adding to cheese/spinach mixture; gently heated the sauce/water and added additional seasoning (salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, etc) to desired taste; covered the manicotti with foil when baking.  Next time will saute some mushrooms with the onion/garlic.

This dish is fabulous! The only thing I changed in it is that I made some ground-up sausage and added it to the dish which made it fabulous! I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to make a different dish that stole the show!

I loved that I didn't have to cook the noodles for this recipe, made it SO quick to make. I did make it the night before however and it was too mushy, but would make it again same day - the stuffing was great.

I was so excited for Manicotti & haven't made it for years! This was an ok recipe. I substituted basil for parsley & minced garlic for the powder. It was tasty but it felt like it was missing something. I would have liked the sauce to be thicker too. The water made it taste watered down. Next time I will boil the noodles first, even though filling them precooked was super easy, it might not have been worth the taste let down

Takes time but it comes out perfect. I used fresh spinach and garlic instead of frozen. I'm a sucker for fresh so it was well worth it. You can also substitute shells for manicotti if you prefer, great recipe!

I usually make this for just the two of us, so halve the filling recipe but keep the spinach level the same. Even then, it still usually makes enough for two meals. I run an afterschool program, so I work some interesting hours (noon - 8:30pm some days). If we're having this, I can do the prep in the morning and keep the dish in the fridge. Then, my husband can preheat the oven and pop this in 45 minutes or so before I get home.

I made some of the deviations from the posts and if came out amazing! I added red pepper flakes, oregano, and ground veal. I seasoned everything a tad more than what was in the recipe. Amazing & we will be making again.

Made this today with a few modifications.  Used jumbo shells instead of manicotti shells,  fresh instead of frozen spinach, added minced garlic, chopped mushrooms, basil and a little crushed red pepper.  Delicious!  I'm a vegetarian so I use mushrooms to make the meal a little heartier.

Istead of manicotti  shells . I use the giant Sea shells.  Much, much easier to stuff.  Just pinch end to end, they open and stuff.

Made this for my daughter--she says it's great! I followed the recipe, except that I sautéed the onions and garlic first (used fresh garlic). I splurged on a more pricey sauce at the store, but it was worth it. The only slightly negative things are that it was messy and time-consuming to stuff the shells (tried putting the filling in a Baggie and piping it in--even messier!!), and that it was a little runny, but that might have been due to the sauce I used. I'd make it again, but would turn it in to a layered pasta rather than stuffed.

It was good, but not WOW!!!  I made few changes.  I included chicken, mushrooms and minced garlic instead of powder.  I used tomato basil Italian sauce, but, next time I'm going to do it the sauce by myself. (Red or White sauce)

Well I made it twice.  First time as suggested by 'Katesinthekitchen'  with the lasagna sheets as I did not have  any tube pasta. I just folded the sheets on each side and yesterday , I brought all necessary ingredients.
If you prefer 'no salt ' or less salt this is perfect don't add anything.  
The recipe is good as it is but do taste after mixing in case you want to adjust salt or want a kick.
For sauce, I used the extra oil I had sitting on my kitchen shelf from pesto. I sautéed some finely diced onion, garlic and Italian seasoning only because I have Indian pallet so I like flavours to my sauce ??.
 I wish I could take a picture but when I  went to grab garlic bread from oven,  it was so tempting that none had patience ??!
It's a great dish and since its rich watch the quantity you make. We made 200 gms for five people and still have left overs ??. 
So both times I made it with tomato sauce but next time I am thinking to  try with Alfredo sauce! 
Thank you for a wonderful, recipe!

This is a  great , easy and fast recipe - our family loves it! I pre cook my pasta, sautee onion and garlic and also do not add water as suggested in other reviews. I found it very tasty if in a separate pan i sautee a small can of cut tomatos with olive oil -once all the juice is gone -i put it in the bottom of my dish -mix with the pasta sauce ..before arranging the stuffed manicotti -it gives nice flavour and its not dry when heating up in the oven-will make it again and again :)!

We liked this recipe, but next time I make it, I'll try a couple of things differently. I followed the recipe exactly and baked it for 50 minutes. It needed about 10 minutes longer for the noodles to be soft. I think if I had boiled the noodles until they were about half cooked, I could have still gotten the ease of stuffing them that you get from using the uncooked manicotti, but the cook time in the recipe would have been right. Also, I would do what other people have said, which is using minced garlic instead of powder. We will definitely make it again.  NOTE, it makes a lot. If you only have two or three people eating, I would recommend only baking half the recipe and freezing the other half for later.

I used fresh spinach, fresh garlic, 2 eggs, omitted the water and I sautéed mushrooms and sausage to add to the sauce. Absolutely delicious. I think I would probably put the onions and garlic in with the sausage and mushrooms though instead of the ricotta mixture. Very good!

I used leftover spanikopita filling and added in more ricotta than it already had, plus the recipe's mozzarella and parm. I parboiled the pasta. Sauce got a heaping T of fresh minced garlic and about 1/4 c of the fresh herbs I had handy: basil, oregano, and thyme; there was already lots of parsley in the filling. Used my pastry bag to fill the tubes. Omitted the water. Covered for most of the cooking. Turned out OK, but will definitely use homemade sauce next time. The three-star rating averages Mr. Spikey's  4 and my 2 for the recipe AS WRITTEN.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. Here are some changes I do: Use 1/2 teaspoon or more of Italian Seasoning + the chopped parsley (just b/c it needs a little extra spice); no onion (because I don't like them) - if I do use them I only put in a little and dice them very small; Instead of manicotti noodle I sometimes use jumbo shell noodles and make it into a Stuffed Shells recipe; I also cook my noodles before I bake it so it takes time out of the cooking process; I only cook the noodles for 7 minutes (if cooked for 10 min it is too much when put in the oven too- so cook noodle just under aldente); I don't put any water in mine either, if you use 2 jars of sauce it should be enough.

Very Good.  Easy to make (my 16 year old granddaughter made it).  Would have added hamburger but granddaughter is vegetarian so we added protein crumbles.

Both my husband and I liked the recipe.  I would recommend covering the pan when in the oven to avoid getting too brown of cheese.  I did as other reviewers recommended and used about 1 tablespoon of minced garlic instead of the powdered.

I used fresh spinach which I sautéed with onions. Substituted fresh basil and used manchego cheese instead if mozzarella.  i thought there was to much watery sauce. i added some toasted pine nuts for a nice crunch. Baked covered with foil for 45 minutes and without another 15 minutes. Might naje again with less sauce and less water.

I used the Allrecipes Best Marinara Sauce ever for this and changed from frozen to fresh sautéed spinach and have added sautéed mushrooms. Once cooked, this froze very well in smaller containers

Let me just say "gut bomb" but a delicious one. I didn't do anything different. It was a little harder to make than I am used to when cooking. I have kids so I try to stick with recipes that are quick and easy. I would make this again but this is something for a special occasion at my house.

This is a good regular recipe to have for the family.. I use the recipe as noted but I do add more Parmesan cheese and a pound and a half of hamburger with a bit of red pepper flakes..sometimes I use minced garlic instead of powder and I use fresh chopped onions instead of minced onions...taste good!!

Could not find Manicotti shells or shells of any kind at the nearby stores so I had to stick with lasagna noodles. Turned out delicious, and it was easy! Of course I added a lot more garlic powder because my family are a bunch of garlic lovers. I will definitely make this again and hopefully be able to find the shells at a nearby store next time.

It was just ok.  It wasn't anything spectacular.  My boys ate it and seemed to like it but the presence of the spinach was a bit too much.  I won't be making this particular dish anymore but it was fun to try.

This recipe kills!! I tried it last night for the first time for a dinner I was going to and everyone loved it. Luckily I got leftovers for today!! Even better the second time around. Next time I make it though I think I will use a meat sauce just for more flavor and add funnel seed to give it a little more spice. All and all fabulous regardless!

Pretty tasty-followed the recipe as is and it came out pretty good. To stuff the shells, I used my icing bag and spooned the ricotta mixture in and then piped it in the shell. Thought that would be an easier method  to fill the shells. All in all I loved this recipe and will be making this instead of my usual spinach lasagna.

I made this last night....am I ever glad I did.  The only change that I made was to use fresh crushed garlic in place of the powdered garlic.  I also used home made italian pasta.  Made plenty to put in the freezer.  Will definitely make this again.

Made tonight. Everybody loved it. So much easier than stuffing the cooked manicotti shells. Added a little more seasoning to the filling but followed the recipe. Thanks for the great dish. This was my first time making home made manicotti.

This was good.  I had a lot of cheese mixture leftover for the 8 oz. of noodles.  Also, my noodles still weren't quite cooked after 55 minutes.  The cheese mixture is similar to the mixture that I use for lasagna.  I'm glad I tried this, but probably won't make this recipe again and just make lasagna.

The easiest stuffed shell dish I ever made!!I never used to like making this dish because of the cooked noodles that split so easily when I tried to stuff them. Also, I sautéed a medium onion and 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil and then added it to the spinach mixture. I used more pasta sauce then called for but kept the 1 1/2 cups of water. A big hit in our house!!

Just made this for my roommates and it was a hit! Tasty and very filling. I followed the other suggestions to sautee the onion and minced garlic before adding to the mix, and to use a plastic bag to pipe the mixture into the pasta tubes. So much easier that way! This is definitely a repeat meal.

I followed the recipe very closely except that I used fresh chopped spinach and I added a bit more seasoning oregano and a bit of parsley to the cheese mixture. I stuff the uncooked shells which is super easy.  I had my doubts about things turning out ok, but I added the extra water to the sauce exactly as the recipe said... and it was delicious. My family has already asked me to make this again. (and they don't usually want anything to do with spinach). This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I made these exactly as written. There was a lot of tomato sauce, more than I needed.  I thought the strong taste of the sauce over whelmed the delicate cheese.  It took a long time for the shells to be soft and I think that over cooked the cheese.  That said we all ate it.

We made this for our thanksgiving eve dinner, we usually have something Italian each year and gather with those of our children who can come home on Wednesday, then we have traditional thanksgiving on Thursday with those who can come. Everyone agreed this was an excellent Manicotti, my oldest son said he had one suggestion, he wants to try it with some Italian sausage added.  We plan to try that next time.  

I followed the recipe as written tweaking the amount on several ingredients, the spinach, Parmesan cheese and parsley.  I doubled the recipe and made two 9 x 13 pans. In the doubled cheese mixture I used one 16 ou. package of frozen spinach instead of two 10 ou. packages, for our taste it was the perfect amount of spinach.  I used twice as much Parmesan Cheese as the double recipe calls for, two cups of instead of one. I added one cup to the cheese mixture and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top of each 9 x 13 pan. I substituted 1 teaspoon of dried parsley flakes for the 2 teaspoons fresh parsley. I also sprinkled a very generous half cup of mozzarella cheese over the tops of each.  

We enjoyed this so much it will become our 'go to' Manicotti recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This was great! I took advice from other comments and used fresh garlic and then I sautéed the onion and garlic together. I also added a tiny bit of red pepper flakes. This recipe was easy to follow. For the whole dinner we had bread and salad with it. Everybody loved it.

Simple & Delicious. Made several alterations to the recipe: Cooked the Manicotti prior to baking them, steamed the spinach, sauteed the onion and garlic cloves in EVOO, utilized our own Family recipe when it came to the pasta sauce, and added Oregano & Basil to the ricotta mixture. Felt it was too bland without the added seasoning. An easy way to fill the Manicotti is piping the filling, but a spoon does the job too. Will definitely be in rotation.

Made this dish for my mother in laws birthday diner.  My brother in law is a chef and he took leftovers with him for lunch the next day, he has never done that! It was so easy without having to boil the noodles and they tasted great.

I just made this for the first time.  My observations. It is too bland and has too much raw onion.

I would add more of both cheeses; reduce the onion or sauté it first so that you don't crunch on onion every bite; add more flavouring; maybe some Frank's hot sauce for a little zing and I am no fan of spicy foods but this needs something more.

Delicious! It was the first time I have ever really cooked anything and it was super easy and worth it. I did read the prior reviews and make a few changes, using fresh basil instead of parsley and minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I also went a little light on the minced onion and a little heavier on the garlic. For the spaghetti sauce, I mixed two cans - one being an Italian Sausage flavored sauce and the other a Garlic/Herb sauce. It was delicious but I only used about half of it. I stuffed the non-cooked manicotti shells with a small fork and had no trouble (the picture is before I covered the manicotti in sauce and tossed it in the oven) All in all, great recipe and a great review from my friends and I who had it for dinner! Thanks!

This is a great recipe, my entire family loved it.  I did add some lean ground beef about 3/4 lb to the mixture of spinach and mozzarella and left out the ricotta.  Also shredded some cheddar cheese on top before baking.  I find stuffing the shells uncooked is way easier.  I use an appetizer spreader which fits perfectly into the shells and just stuff away!!!  Perfect meal for all the hockey moms out there looking to change up the same pasta meals before games. :-)

This was great! Didn't realize until we set to make it that we didn't have onion, so that wasn't included in the final dish. Did everything else as written, with the exception of only using about 2/3 cup of water mixed with the sauce...didn't want to water it down too much. Everybody loved it so this will definitely become part of our dinner menu rotation.

So rich, delicious, and easy this dish is an Italian staple.
Given my experiences with baking uncooked pasta in dishes like lasagne, I chose to pre-cook the Manicotti noodles pre-aldente. After these noodles are rinsed with cold water, they were placed on parchment paper; these noodles are easy to stuff by hand.
Very enjoyable, easy.

the best part about this recipe is not having to precook the pasta. For years I've put off making mannicotti because it was so frustrating when the shells broke as they were being filled.

So, I just made this for a dinner party (only 4 people) and I made it exactly as-is.  Usually I change something about recipes I find here, but I didn't change a thing (I added all the water, the 2 jars of spaghetti (Ragu traditional), and didn't cook the noodles).  It turned out perfect!  All four of us were quite full (with a salad and breadsticks too), and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for a great meal!

This is a great recipe.  My husband would give it 10 stars!  He says it's one of his new favorites :)  Only change was to cook noodles 1/2 way & omit water(worked great!) & use 1 jar of sauce(which was plenty).

This is one of those recipes that you save to make another day.  I know it's a good one because my 16 year old helped himself to some left overs, gave me a kiss and sais "mom, that was the best".  That's all I need :)

Thought this dish was tasty! Although it seemed to be missing something...Next time I will try adding some italian sausage to give it a bit more flavor.

This was awesome! I used a little less spinach (the hubby doesn't like it if he can taste it!) and added turkey sausage to the cheese mixture. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes. I'm not typically a superstar in the kitchen, but I feel like this is something failproof enough that I could make it for company!

EXCELLENT! I've only made something like this once before, with the noodles pre-cooked and trying to stuff the slimey buggers. NEVER again. But I was SO hungry for something different. Only change I did was only used ONE jar of spaghetti sauce, and next time I will reduce the water by about 1/4 cup. I'd saute the onions just a bit, because my family complains if it's left with ANY texture.

I served this recipe to friends and it was good---with a few alterations.  First I cut WAY back on the spinach.  I put about 4 oz fresh chopped spinach and more ricotta.  I also heavily seasoned the mixture.  It was a nice easy meal served with a salad, bread, and wine.

Wonderful!  I just wish I would have doubled it!!  Even the picky little boys asked for seconds!  I used fresh spinach and sauted it in olive oil, garlic and onion.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out perfectly!  I have never made manicotti before so I followed the directions exactly except for adding extra cheese. I was a little nervous about not cooking the pasta first but the noodles are cooked with no chewy spots.  I had a little extra filling at the end which was perfect in a breakfast omelet.  Great recipe!

This turned out awesome! I was looking for a good manicotti recipe because I did not care for the one I had. I made a few minor changed. I cooked the noodles so as to cut the cooking time in half and eliminated the 2nd jar of sauce and all of the water. I also added some italian sausage. I was a hit!! I will definitely be hanging on to this recipe.

I followed the directions but I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The filling seemed really dry for some reason.  The flavor overall was okay but not the best I have ever had.  It seemed a little on the bland side.

I give it a four because I changed the recipe and am unsure how it would have turned out otherwise. I did not precook the manicotti and I stuffed it as the recipe stated although I did add italian seasonings. for the sauce I used a mushroom basil pasta sauce and a vodka cream sauce. I also added a cup of heavy cream, onions, and bell peppers. I didn't add water but added about 3/4 a cup of a dry white wine. It reduced nicely and came out very flavorful. I did have it in the oven for and hour and twenty minutes though.

I have never had luck without boiling the noddles for any pasta dish, so I made this by boiling the noodles ahead of time and stuffing them with the mixture. I didn't mix the water in with the sauce-I just used lots of extra sauce in mine so it wouldn't be dry. I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before baking at 375 for about 40 minutes and it was wonderful.

Thank you!  I prepare the manicotti shells and then freeze them in an air tight bag.  They bake perfectly at 425 for 45-55 minutes.

This was very good and super easy.  I was sceptical about not cooking the pasta first but I gave it a try. It really does work!  Rinse out the spaghetti jars with water and use that water in the recipe.  Waste not want not!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I have made both manicotti and stuffed shells before but always precooked the noodles before stuffing.  It is so much easier to stuff the manicotti tube when it's uncooked!    I did make a few modifications inspired by other reviews: substituted 2 tsp. dry basil for the 2 tsp. parsley in the cheese filling, added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, and used about 8 ounces fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also omitted the onions in the filling because I used my homemade sauce which has onions in it already.  I also used less sauce - I measured 4 cups of my sauce and added 1 cup of water and thought that this amount was plenty of sauce.  But because of using less sauce, the baking time needed to be about 60 minutes in my oven to ensure the noodles cooked fully.   My 18-month-old loved this and even ate nearly as much as I did!

This was fantastic.  I borrowed a couple other posters' ideas and added a generous scoop of pesto and garlic to the cheese mixture and spooned a little alfredo on the top as I was serving.  Even my meat eating boys didn't miss the meat in this dish.  Delicious.

Yummy. The second time I made it, I didn't have mozzarella or parmesan. I used 2 cups shredded cheddar, 2 cloves garlic (minced & sauted first), and basil rather than parsley, and a dash extra pepper. It tasted great also. Alot depends on the spaghetti sauce also. If you use cheddar, try to stay away from a salty sauce. Taste the sauce before adding to see if you like it. You can always fix the sauce to suit your tastes before adding it.

I use the cheese/spinach stuffing recipe also when making the stuffed shells..basically the same use un cooked first, but I found that using not the water to the sause but substituting the water in the sause for white/red wine and using a tomato and basil spagetti sause gives it more flavor in the sause and also adding a pinch of garlic.

I used shells instead of manicotti but that shouldn't matter.  The problem I had was that I cooked it almost an hour and the noodles were still a little crunchy.  My husband thought they were supposed to be that way and liked it.  LOL  Until the next day when the dish has been refrigerated for several hours, probably soaking up the moisture, the noodles got softer and were better when reheated.  I'm not sure if I'll cook them even longer next time or precook the noodles.  Otherwise, a good recipe.  Very tasty!

I have made similar recipes in the past, but for some reason my spinach was tough in this one.  I will saute onions and spinach next time before adding to cheese mixture.  I only needed one 26 oz jar of sauce...which was plenty.

This was so easy.  I didn't have to cook the noodles and they were easier to stuff.
My husband loved it and he usually doesn't care for fancy Italian food.  I will serve it to my guests at future dinner party.

Loved this recipe. I used shells and easily stuffed them with a teaspoon. Also afraid of "ruining the sauce," I omited the water. It took just over five minutes extra to cook. My preferred sauce is Barilla'a Italian Baking Sauce. I found it a few years ago and always have a few jars on hand. Next time I will nestle italian sausages in between the shells as my husband insists on meat in his dinner. Might increase cheese as well as I had several unstuffed shells left over and would like it to stretch a little more.

ok this was delicious.  I was looking for meatless choices for a get together I was having and came across this recipe.  Only thing I added was some fresh garlic & pepper to the cheese mixture.  Everyone loved it.  No leftovers!

This turned out very good! An excellent recipe for a mid-week dinner. The whole dish took about 1,5 hours. I used light ricotta for cottage cheese, added basil and lots of parsley.

I thought this recipe was great, but it seems to lack something, so I the added cottage cheese, and additional egg and about 2 cups cooked chopped chicken breast { since I had some ],used red onion and upped the mozzarella a bit. I also cooked the manicotti for about half the time the box suggested, so about 4 to 5 minutes, omitted the water, and it was out of this world awesome good eaten. Oh I also used two boxes of manicotti since adding the chicken and cottage cheese made more filling. Good thing too it went fast !! wrote it all down and WILL be fixen thisen again.

Tasted pretty good, although I made quite a mess in the kitchen.  I precooked the noodles (which reduced the baking time to about 30 min.) and added half a pound of cooked, Italian sausage to the tomato sauce.  I substituted the parsley with basil and added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes to the ricotta cheese mixture.  I'll probably try a different manicotti recipe next time.  I didn't like this one well enough to make it again.

I like this dish, but it is a little bland. The only thing I changed was fresh garlic instead of powder. It tasted better reheated the next day.  I will try it again and see if I can get more flavor.

I made according to recipe and refigerated overnight - turned out perfectly.  I will make it again but add a little something - maybe real garlic.  I'm going to try it with Italian sausage too, but it's very good with just the spinach.  It's a great basic recipe that you could easily tweak to make your own.

Made this last night for dinner with the in-laws... Father-in-law "doesn't like italian food", but he loved this!  VERY tasty!

I only mixed 1 cup of water with the sauce before baking and it turned out fine.

This was awesome! I was so exicted to fine a manicotti recipe where you don't have to cook the noodles before hand. I used italian sausage canned sauce which added a nice flavor. It makes a lot too, it fed 5 adults and one child and we still had half of a 9x13 pan left. I bet this would freeze well too.

Superb, no changes needed. This time I used Florentine and cheese sauce from 'classico'...who says you can ever get enough spinach and cheese! Used only one jar and 1/4 cup water and forgot the garlic..dang that's a staple in this house.....oh well it was still delish.

I used fresh spinach which I cooked with the onion, fresh garlic, homeade spaghetti sauce and no water. Like someone else commented the texture of the noodles is not the same as when you preboil the noodles. However because it eases preparation I will continue to make it the way it is stated.

This was a great recipe.  My husband absolutely loved it and it was very easy to make.  It is a good way to get your kids to eat spinach.

Great dish. We thought it needed meat, but that can be added easily next time. I used the largest fitting on my dessert decorator to fill the shells and it worked wonderfully.

I used Basil instead of Parsley and used pre shredded Italian blend cheese, and it was still deliciouse! I would definately make this again.

We liked this recipe, but thought the flavor was a little mild for our tastes. We served it with sauteed Italian sausage on the side, and they were perfect complements to each other. When we make this again, I'll add some cooked Italian sausage to the filling, along with fresh garlic and fresh basil. My husband really liked this one. We'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic! I split this recipe in 2 - one for us, one for a friend who just had twins. I did decrease the water a bit and prepared it the night before. The noodles absorbed the liquid and were soft before baking time. My kids, 2 and 4 loved it too! Thanks so much!

Not bad. Too much spinach. The filling was kind of dry and tasted like to much spinach. Will try again with less spinach and no spinach for the kids. Easy to stuff if you use a butter knife. Had to cook a little longer and added cheese last 15 mins.

This was soooo good! I had never made Manicotti before, but made them for a family get-together.  Everyone thought I had ordered them from a restaurant, they were that good.  Will make again and again.

This is always a winner!  I agree that stuffing the manicotti shells is a pain but the taste is great.  I usually serve this to company, and I love the fact that I can prepare it the night before.

Great taste with a few changes!  I added one pound of italian sausage (cooked), subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta, and threw in mushrooms with the onions when mincing.  It took mine about 20 minutes longer to bake, and the manicotti pasta itself had a chewier texture - I'm guessing since it wasn't boiled first.  Great dish that I will use again!

Amazing!  I loved it and so did my boyfriend.  I would suggest sautaing the sautéing the onions with the spinach just because it gives it more flavor, but otherwise, excellent.

this was awesome, it was the first time i made this meal. i have never made it before and my friend was celebrating her bday and loves manicotti. It was easy i made it and let it sit overnight inthe fridge. i did bake one small try that night to make sure it tasted good before i served it tho! my hubby liked it oo, unfortunatly my sons did not try it one can't eat milk products anyway but they had spaghetti with us. i will definaly make this again and maybe try different filling besides spinach. thank you for an easy meal that my friend loved. it was filling adn i have plenty leftover i doubled the batch it was so easy!! and the only thing i changed was i added some mozzerella cheese to the mixture (i love cheese anyway)

This recipe was fun to make, I suggest getting the kids to help stuff the noodles. I didn't add the water to the spagetti sauce and it turned out fine.

A great recipe. Especially for those who are not veggie lovers! The only change I made was adding some ground turkey. A good addition for those who complain about not having their meat for dinner. (And they won't know it was turkey!)
