I was getting ready for a Memorial Day BBQ in honor of the fallen when I came across this recipe and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I tried this. The flavors are unbelievable. This recipe is at the top of my Memorial Day menu. Forget the chips, just eat it out of a bowl with a spoon. Thank you FrackFamily5 for an awesome recipe.

Holy Catburgrrs Sports Fans. Now this incredibly easy, tasty, and super refreshing Salsa will soon be sweeping the universe! Talk about easy to make....this dang concoction could be made by any idiot willing to make a small mess in the kitchen. I did opt for fresh cut watermelon at the market, which took a lot of time off the prep side, however it doesn't do a lot for the ole food budget
