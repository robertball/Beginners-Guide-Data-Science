Try modifying the two cups of olive oil into two tablespoons or two teaspoons.

Really enjoyed this. I ended up using only 1/2 cup of the nutritional yeast and 2 cups of marinara. Also, I roasted small potatoes with the garlic and added to the pizza. I used  about 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning as the 'herbs'. Wife approved! Thanks!

I decided to use 3tablespoons of olive oil and minced garlic. I think you could change the toppings how ever you want. I used olive salad, jalape√±os and sun dried tomatoes. Came out really tasty and fun to make!
