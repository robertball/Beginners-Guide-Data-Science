I was looking for an easy, great tasting cheese sauce and this one did the trick. Unfortunately, I don't go the healthy way. I get some hamburger meat with taco mix then I add the cheese sauce to the meat. I add some cooked macaroni to make my version of hamburger helper. The family loves it!

Made this gluten free using corn starch instead of flour. Turned out great! I halfed the recipe as I was just cooking for myself. When using corn starch instead of flour the conversion is half as much corn starch as the amount of flour that the recipe calls for. I realized after I was done that I didn't do this. Sauce was nice and thick because of this. Next time I will add a pinch of cayenne to give the sauce a little more zing.

This cheese sauce was excellent, after I made it I decided to add some of the cheddar cheese into the sauce, which meant I ended up having to add more milk. I noticed that when I got it just to the perfect thickness and added it to the cauliflower (and broccoli)  and baked it with the rest of the cheddar on top as directed.. at the end the whole thing came out more liquid than it went in... it was a bit too thin, I think if I make it again I will just put the sauce on top of the veggies and serve because it was the perfect thickness before the oven. Still it was delicious.

This turned out really good. I had intentions on making as written except that I planned to cut the cauliflower into "steaks" instead of florets. I was multi-tasking and goofed by adding the sharp cheddar to the rest of the sauce instead of putting it on top as written. It still tasted great but it did alter the look of the sauce. I had another cheese sauce going at the same time that went with a completely different recipe. It called for green onions and I liked it so much that I added them with this one too. This sauce would go really good with many different things. It would also work great on the side for dipping. Definitely a keeper!

I really like this cheese sauce.  My lil' nephew does not like cheese anything so I make the whole thing on the side and serve in a gravy boat.  Works great that way.

Sauce was bland and needed more flour than called for to thicken.  As well salt, Parmesan.  I think I will try to make it again with some changes to add to flavor.

Aahhahhh made it again! This time with broccoli, cauliflower and a box of prepared rice a roni broccoli and cheese flavor. I used paper jack cheese and feta because that's all I had. Added bread crumbs to the top delicious! Good for a throw together meal that doesn't make me feel guilty to feed to my boys 2 days before payday!
