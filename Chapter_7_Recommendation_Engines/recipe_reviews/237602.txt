I made this exactly by the recipe.   It was absolutely amazing.  My fianc√© wanted shrimp tacos for dinner and I used this slaw recipe.  He travels for work and recently was in Houston and raved about the fish tacos he had at a few restaurants there.  He said this slaw is restaurant worthy.  He mooed all during dinner.  Ate 5 tacos and had more slaw on the side.

A very different version of coleslaw with a mustard taste. Many people told me they didn't like Cole slaw but they like this.
