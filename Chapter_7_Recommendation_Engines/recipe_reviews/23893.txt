Oh, my goodness.  My girlfriend and I have been making these for over 34 years together in batches of 100-120 at a time.  They freeze great.  Just BEWARE:  Everyone wants the recipe and they will steal them if the get the chance.  Thanks, Kim, first time I've "seen" the recipe.  We made ours off scribbled notes of a German grandmother.  Easier way to do the dough is to use a bread machine recipe for dinner rolls.

Very Good.  I split the recipe in half and made half with sauerkraut and half with cabbage.  Both were good.  I recommend increasing the amount of shredded cabbage though because it wilts down a lot.  I did cut the amount of salt by half and the pepper by half.  Velveeta is hard to shred so I cubed it and it melted in nicely.  I used turkey Italian sausage and ground sirloin.  The stuffing was moist without being greasy.  It makes a lot so I froze some and I'm looking forward to eating it again soon.  For those who haven't made bread, the shortening should be melted, cooled to lukewarm, and added to the yeast and water mixture before the flour.
I will make this again.

We first tasted BIEROCKs in Kansas two years ago.  At the airport I purchased a Kansas Cookbook just to get the recipe; I haven't found it anyplace else.  The book states the recipe was brought to Kansas by the Volga Germans who emigrated from Russia.  And are we ever glad they did.  I freeze these in foil so our older sons can just grab a few and microwave and eat "on the run."  Marian E.

I have been making these for 50 years, my old Ukraine/German Grandmother used to make them. but back in the day when pennies were tight.  we only had the ground beef, cabbage, onions salt and pepper.  and bread dough.   We use an 18 qt Nesco to cook it all down until all the cabbage is wilted down and onions soft. and beef done.  drain off and cool.  Then roll out the bread dough, cut a square fold them in and bake..
Kids and grandkids called them "grubby ducks" we laugh still at the german/english kids pronounciation of it.
as most German cusine dishes,  It is excellent fare.  freeze well, and reheat in microwave.....Used to take in lunch all the time..  Brings back many memories of dearly missed Gramma and Mom....

I really like this recipe.  I didn't have dry milk on hand so I used about 1/4 cup of 1% milk, and added more flour.  I was worried about how the dough would turn out because I had to add quite a lot more flour due to stickiness, BUT ... it turned out great.  I will make this again, many times.  Angela

WOW! These were absolutely amazing! I did end up having to add nearly an extra 2 cups of flour to bring the dough together, and also added a tspoon of salt because I can't imagine a bread dough without salt, but other than that I followed the bread recipe. I did end up altering the meat mixture after tasting it to suit it to our tastes, but these were such a hit at the Oktoberfest party I attended.  

Here's what I did:  grab about a 2" ball of dough, flatten it and gently stretch it to about 4" or 5" in diamter.  If this dough has been kneaded enough, you shouldn't have to worry about it breaking open, but don't push it. I put a very large spoonful of mixture in since the reviews all said they had a ton of filling leftover. You can add more than you think because the dough stretches nicely around it and I didn't end up with any extra filling (though I did cut down the filling ingredients slightly). 

AFter adding the additional 2c of flour, I'd say I was able to make about 2 batch of 8 or 9, & because the bread expands quite a bit during cooking, they turned out to be the size of a good sized burger w/ a beautiful bread to filling ratio. 

Brush the top with an egg wash (egg white and a quick splash of water) and sprinkle with a dash of sea salt and something like dried onions or Mrs. Dash for color and texture and appearance. Can't wait to try this one with different fillings; I think I'll try an orange egg wash mixture and make pumpkins for Halloween!

I too used Rhodes rolls to save time.  This is an excellent recipe.  I have also filled them with chopped ham, smoked gouda mixed with a bit of mayo and stone ground mustard.  Yum.  For a very kid friendly bierock, mix pizza sauce with shredded mozzerella & chopped pepperoni.

I let my bread machine do the work thru the second rise. When I checked on the dough it had totally overflowed in my machine, making a sticky mess. I found that I had to add approx 3/4 cup more flour and dust my hands frequently in order to work with the dough. The filling was out of this world! I added more mustard (dijon type) and more cheese (white cheddar). Other than the sticky dough, these were fantastic! Next time I will do the dough by hand (probably for best results anyway).Even my mom and her friend who have published 8 cookbooks between the two of them (one being a bread baking book) thought these were outstanding!Thanks for sharing, Kim!

I think my first mistake was using refrigerated breakstick dough.  It was harder to work with than I imagined and almost all of my pockets didn't seal.  Second, I thought that 3tbs prepared mustard meant refrigerated French's mustard.  I used 2tbs Yellow and 1 tbs Brown, but that was all you could taste was just yellow mustard.  Third, I sliced my cabbage and it was in long thick pieces - I tried to chop it at that point...  Was I supposed to grate it?  I think by not understanding the recipe I ruined it.

These are simply great!! I used Rhodes frozen bread rolls, instead of making my own bread... While I believe home made bread is the BEST, my RA will not allow for all that kneading. I adore these made with sauerkraut and ground beef, or  cabbage, and bacon. It's different, yes, but boy are they good. The combo of cabbage with bacon... YUM!! We use them for suppers and lunches. I have never tried cheese in them, I'll have to give that a try. Rhodes frozen rolls work BEST when thawed at room temp. Cooler than that, is way to hard to use. I roll one out, cut it into, roll out again to make round, apply my meat & such, then roll up like a dinner roll, turn over and place in a slightly greased 9 x 13 pan. let raise again and then bake. You can add all sorts of stuff, as others have stated. This is just our way of eating them. I make two pans of each. My Husband always makes a big deal out of, "which one will I eat first". It doesn't matter, they both are GREAT!! And yes they do freeze wonderfully!

these were fantastic! feel free to let the dough rise a little before putting it in the oven...and I think the recipe lends itself nicely to variations--whether in cheese or meat, or even added vegetables.  The bread is a great compliment to the meat mixture--thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe although if u don't cheat, it's takes some work.  I think the prep. time should be lengthened to reflect this.

I used butter instead of shortening (no trans fats) and I too, like the other reviewers, had to deal with insanely sticky dough!  I added so much flour that I ran out.  

The key to filling the dough is to pile the filling more vertical than horizontal and to pull the stretchy dough up and over like a purse satchel.

I had to cook it in batches b/c one 9X13 inch pan only held 1/2 of the bierocks.

Turned out great!  Very much like a German empanada.

(Also, my skillet was too small for all the ingredients so I transferred the filling to a soup pot and it worked fine.)

Excellent!  I have never made bread before or used yeast, but they turned out great the first time!!  I used sauerkraut, and these were devoured.  One thing I would like to mention (and hope to see other comments regarding sometime) is:  Since I am a bit 'green' when it comes to making bread, I was hoping for a bit more instruction regarding the dough, like - how sticky is too sticky? (mine was VERY sticky!!), and how long do I need the dough the second time (ie. after it sits - another 10 minutes, or 3 "kneeds" or what?)? and how do I use all that meat? (the buns I made were HUGE, since I couldn't seem to figure out how to cut down the size and thickness of each dough piece without having it split open from the "large spoonful of meat" called for.)  Oh well, it was great!  Thanks, I'll have to try these again with the other half of the meat I had left - haha!  :o)

My hubby and I were invited to an Oktober Fest party here in our new community.  Everybody was to bring a German inspired dish and I decided to make this one.  I almost cheated and bought frozen dinner rolls instead of making my own.  Boy am I glad I made the recipe as stated!  The dough was so fun to work with… I too had to add about 1.25 – 1.5 more cups of flower as others stated.  I mixed mine in my stand mixer with the dough hook and then once together I kneaded it out on my counter. These turned out so good!  There was someone else who made these and called them Kraut Burgers made with only ground beef so I thought mine were much better.  A German lady there told me that Kraut Bierocks translate into Kraut burgers… she was surprised that I know the proper word for them.  I will for make these again (from scratch) and play around with the filling to change things up.

These are fantastic!  I used kraut instead of cabbage and Rhodes bread dough instead of making my own and they really turned out well.  The recipe makes A LOT so I ended up freezing half of the meat mixture and I still had over 5 servings.  They are very good reheated and even tasty cold!  I was also thinking that it would be fun to make "Mini Bierocks" for party appetizers.

These are amazing. For the dough, I use the bread machine, and I only use 1-1/2 cups of water. I ended up using all the flour called for. And I was out of powdered milk, so I skipped it! I used 1-1/3 pounds of ground beef instead of beef and sausage, one can of sauerkraut instead of cabbage, and all cheddar cheese (no American). Really tasty fresh, and still quite delicious at room temperature or cold. Thanks for sharing!

This was really delicious.  I will use a little more cheese next time, but the cabbage was great.  This is even better the next day!  The bread was AMAZING, and I will probably use that in other recipes.  I love making these and freezing them for quick dinners.  They reheat quite well.  This recipe also requires more flour than stated.  THANKS!

Followed recipe exactly to start with except for doubling it all.  The dough required quite a bit more flour than stated.  Without it, the dough was super sticky and impossible to work with.  I will not use the italian sausage with this recipe again.  The first batch i baked in a baking dish and I didn't like the way they turned out.  The second batch I baked on a cookie sheet and liked them a lot better. The dough tasted well, doughy...I am not sure how to fix that though, maybe more sugar since I had to add so much more flour?  Will try again with my changes...

Being from an old German family, I grew up eating these. But my mom made them differently. First, she never used sweet bread. She used a white bread recipe. I noticed some had problems cutting the cabbage. I cut the head in fourths then core each piece; lay a piece on its flat surface and with a sharp knife slice very thin slices starting at a pointed end. Also we never used mustard in these however I think it tastes good in these. Mom and now myself, will usually bake half of these and in a cast iron skillet heat about one inch oil till about 350 degrees. And put in two to three at a time. Brown one side then flip and brown the other. Healthy? probably not but it sure tastes good. Overall I think this is a pretty good recipe just not authentic like I am used to. My parents were also Volga Germans and even among them, there are very many variations. But, I am looking forward to trying this version.

Excellent! I've never made bread before and did ok (not as hard working as I imagined). I used stone ground mustard and it blended in perfect. I've never seen these round rolls before so I made them in rectangles: folded two sides in, then the other two sides (like a burrito). One suggestion: don't squeeze the rolls in the pan cause they tend to expand; let a small space between them to allow them to grow. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Tried this recipe on a Saturday when I had more time to make the dough.  I had to add about 3/4 cup more flour because it was too sticky.  They turned out great, nice and soft bread exterior.  Wonderful as leftovers.  A great weekend experiment!

Oops!  Made in error in my review dated June 21.  What I meant to say was that I divided the dough in half, divided the two pieces in half again and each of the four pieces into thirds.  Then made three rolls from each of the thirds.  Sorry...I think I have confused myself!

Hot Pockets no more! Great for hungry 12 year old son after school, and healthier than packaged convenience foods. Tip - do not skip draining the fat from the browned meat - it keeps the bread from being soggy after baking.

I made a profile just so I could rave about this recipe! The only change I made was I had no powdered milk, so I did as another user suggested and added about 1/4 cup of 1% milk (give or take to adjust dough consistency), and they came out fabulous. These are so yummy, and super easy to freeze and thaw in the microwave to eat on the go. (The last batch I made, I froze half to save them and ended up eating them all week anyhow because they are SO good. Like little mini pocket sandwiches!) I didn't make the sauerkraut version, just the cabbage and omg. Did I mention they are unbelievable????

I didn't want to deal with the dough, so I took the meat & sauerkraut mixture and put it on a pack of hawaiian sweet rolls & made sliders (baking in the over for about 15-20 min).  A nice change from our usual sliders, and a great use for leftover sauerkraut.  I would make again this way.

These are incredible.  Plenty of room for tweaking depending upon your choice of mustard and whether you use cabbage or kraut.  I can definitely see playing with the cheese as well. For my first batch, I went with a dijon mustard and also added a little swiss.  My husband devoured them.  His observation was that the filling had the consistency of a spring roll, but tasted like a hamburger/slider.  Definite keeper for party snack food.

I love bierocks!  The first time i tried them was here in Ks.  I bought a cookbook from an auction, that happened to be money raising cookbook for a close by college.  When i found this one i was very interested and decided to make it.  I have made it many many times since then.  I decided to see what i could come up with on this site tonight because i didnt want to take the time to dig out my trusty cookbook and wahlah i tried this one and was i glad i did :) so gooooood my family loved these!  I make half with cheese and half without because i like them better without the cheese.  i never have enough for leftovers! I end up giving them out to extended family members and they too are so pleased with these!  YUMMMY is all i can say!

These tasted great and reheat really well in the microwave (wrap in saran wrap and heat for 1 min).  I used German Sausage instead of Italian, and spinach instead of kraut (because I was lazy and didn't want to go to the store) good with spinach but I think I will try it with real sauerkraut next time.

Excellent.  I have used another recipe previously but I like this one much better (and so did my family).  The sausage and mustard really made a huge difference.  I goofed on the dough and used oil instead of shortening, needed to add more flour to get to a workable dough - but still a great taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

First, I absolutely LOVED the filling for this! I'm sure that I am going to make it alot - I can think of many different ways to eat it: over a half baked potato, stuffed in a pita pocket, on crispy toasted french bread... I made it with Jimmy Dean's Sage Sausage, 1/2lb ground lamb instead of beef, and I added a few tbsp lime juice. 

However... the bread recipe was trouble from the start for me.  It was hard to get the shortening mixed in well, my electric beater and hands both became a sticky, goopy mess. I started adding flour, kept adding and adding - close to 2c of extra flour so that the dough was workable. I let it sit 40 minutes, but it didn't rise much, so I let it sit a second time after kneading (still didn't rise). 

I was so proud when I saw these after 20 minutes in the oven that it all seemed worth it. I called my boyfriend over and let them cool off. But when we took big bites, the dough was waaay underdone on the bottom half. My spakin' new pan would NOT cook the bottoms, even after an extra 20 minutes. I had to cook them on my tried and true smaller pan in batches to get the bottoms done. 2 hours 45 minutes later... I did have a good time, though. =) Pat's Bierock recipe on this site looks like it has a better dough recipe.

One of my best friends is half German, and her mother made these one night when I was visiting. They sure are ugly little things, but taste delicious. This recipe was very similar to hers; we usually add extra sauerkraut as a yummy addition, or substitute green cabbage for red.

What a joy it is to find this wonderful recipe on this site so that others may also enjoy it!  Thanks, Kim!  On 6/5/03 Marian Elizabeth posted a review for this recipe in which she states that her cookbook, purchased in Kansas, indicates that this recipe came from the Volga Germans who emigrated from Russia.  I can verify this as my German grandparents did, in fact, emigrate from Russia, and my Mother made these delicious Bierocks many times as I was growing up.  Thank you, Marian Elizabeth for this interesting bit of information concerning the German heritage in America.

These were really good!  I made them with saurkraut instead of cabbage and found that it gave enough of a zing that I probably didn't need more than 2 Tblsp of mustard.  I cheated and used frozen bread roll dough.  I allowed it to rise per package instructions, then put the dough in the refrigerator for a bit, just to make it a bit easier to work with.  My family loved these -- even my 2 year old! Great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME! The entire family loved it. I accidentially omitted the powdered milk from the dough and substituted butter for the shortening, but it turned out wonderful anyway. I made big ones and little ones. I even made it into a roll, like a pinwheel roll. This is a definite keeper!

Great recipe!  After reading reviews about the need for flour.  I was on a quest to find the true amount needed.  It takes exactly 5 1/2 c flour for perfect dough.  Anyway. used my bread machine for the dough only.  The only thing I changed was the butter instead of shortening.  yummy.  Also for those who don't buy powdered milk....dry coffee creamer is a great substitute.
Thanks Kim for a great recipe!

Mmmm... this was very good. The filling was good, but seemed to be a little bit mild once it was baked into the buns... could have been my choice of mild sausage. (Next time I use this filling, I think I'll use dijon mustard.) The buns are excellent... I'm planning to use the bun portion of the recipie with a bbq'ed pork filling tonight. Thanks for the recipie!

These were outstanding!!  I used a "savory sage" flavor sausage, which gave these a wonderful smell
and flavor.  Next time I think I will add a bit more cabbage. I did cheat and use a store-bought bread dough.  It helped to make these a relatively fast meal. I only wish the leftovers had lasted more than a day!

This recipe was delicious!!!  The dough was very easy to make compared to others I have tried and the filling was hard to stop eating. although, next time we will pay attention to details....We put in 2 tablespoons of salt instead of 2 teaspoons!  OOPS!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Although, what you see took 4 1/2 hours (made a double batch), they are yummy!!  I don't think I'd make again, because they're a lot if work, and the end result are buns w hamburger. Sliders would have been much easier...but not authentic.

Really good!  But I must say I have a few qualms with the recipe...

The flour amount is not enough. I added a ton!

It could really be more specific.  I had never tried, or even seen a beirrock before.  How big of a piece of dough?  How flat?  How wide should it be?  What exactly qualifies a "spoonful"?  My result was a wonderful, albiet overly bready creation. I'll do it again!

Made this recipe, which generated about 12 nice sized buns.  My husband and I devoured them within 2 days.  I am going to keep this recipe for sure, and will also try using the dough for BBQ beef, Broccoli and cheese, Ham and cheese filled buns.  I cannot wait to try other fillings in this bread.  Like most of the other reviewers, I did have to add additional flour, and I found that another 3/4 of a cup was perfect.  In addition, I did not have the dried milk -so I used 1 and 1/2 cups of water, and 1/2 cup of half and half to fill that dairy void.  These were REALLY good. I can't wait to fill the bread with other things as well!

These are so good! I make them all summer long to take along to baseball and football games with the kids. They keep for a few days in the fridge and even frozen and reheated they are very tasty! We worked out a manufacturing line to make them and got the time down to 20 min for double the recipe. I make the dough in my breadmaching on the dough setting!

Sooo good!  I used Rhodes frozen rolls to speed things up.  I made the recipe as is, except I did reduce the salt by half.  I used 2% cheese to lighten it up a bit, and next time I will try turkey sausage.

I made a quadruple batch of these recently (for a brewfest) and they were great, but I did not follow the recipe exactly. Like other people, I was shocked when I had to add LOTS more flour than called for to the dough, and I used whole wheat for about 1/3 of the total. I added sauerkraut and chopped homemade giardineira veggies to the innards and the vinegary flavor was great against the sweetness of the dough. I also used mozzarella (I had a ton of it that needed to go away) instead of the other cheese, but would use something stronger like smoked gouda next time. People loved these even when served cold. I grew up  in central Kansas with lunch ladies that made these for us in the lunch room and they were the best ever. Not quite what most kids are getting these days in the cafeteria - they are missing out.

Awesome recipe!! My entire family just loved these! I will be making this again and again. I did make two changes. I used italian sausage links and then put them in the food processor, because I couldn't find the ground kind.  And I used the store bought cresent roll dough that some of the other members mentioned.  Worked great. Thanks!

These were fabulous!!!  I reduced the amount of mustard to 1 TBSP so my husband wouldn't flip, but followed everything else exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Isn't it annoying when you slave away over something for hours and it turns out mediocre, yet something easy and simple ends up being incredibly tasty? I couldn't believe how much Husband liked these! Apart from adding a little horseradish sauce to the meat filling, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm looking forward to seeing if they are any better tomorrow. Awesome recipe, Kim! Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious.  I make these only once a year, these are a special treat and making them only once a year keeps them special.  I wouldn't change a thing, the recipe is perfect.

I made the filling as noted, but used crescent rolls for the pastry.  Sped up the process and they were delicious.  Big hit at my party.  I had leftover meat mixture and served it over noodles - very good the second day, too.

The first time I made these it was so much work that I swore I would never make them again.  But my family went NUTS over them!  My MIL has a new respect for me now!  They're very tasty.  To make things easier, I make the filling one day and freeze it.  I only used half the filling when I made it the first time so now I freeze it in two clumps. I use half now and the other half the next time I make them.  Then the next day I make the bread and bake them.  It's alot easier if you're not trying to do it all at one time.  I use Dijon mustard. Yummy!

This makes a lot of food--enough to feed at least 10 adults!  If you give them a salad, you've got a complete meal.  They freeze and re-heat in the oven well.  I've made them more than once to happy guests!

I love this recipe, and I just made it again last night for dinner.  This makes a ton, and I always get to freeze an entire meal out of this.  When I made the dough by hand, I had to add at least 1 cup if not 2 cups of flour.  Now I use my dough hook on the kitchenaid, and I find this recipe perfect.  The bun is sooo airy and light.  My only substitution is butter instead of shortening.  Great meal for a cold winter night.

I made this recipe as written several years ago and they were wonderful, if a little mild in the meat filling.  I'm getting ready to make them again. I think I'm going to squeeze a couple of fresh brats out of the casings to add to the beef.  And I'll probably use sauerkrat.
YUM! Thanks for posting this recipe!

These turned out beautifully.....just the right proportion of dough to filling.....it made 13 large bierocks....I took some hot Italian sausages out of the casings and used more sausage than ground beef....the bread is wonderful and worth making.....I wouldn't sub anything else....I served them with homemade mango chutney and they were scrumptious!

We had a German potluck at our Lutheran School and I needed a recipie I could make ahead and freeze so my husband could warm up while I was at work.  These fit the bill perfect and they were delicious.  I will be making more for my own family to enjoy.

I had my husband help me make this and the whole time he wasn't sure if he'd like it (hates cabbage). But I made him and it tasted great. Took a lot longer than expected and I ended up with much more dough and filling than just for 10. Great as left overs, too!

These were absolutely delicious!  I did need to add quite a bit of flour when making the dough, but they turned out great.  My 10-year old (who hates cabbage and sauer kraut) went back for seconds.  I don't think I'll share the recipe with him. :)

Seriously good eats here!  I used half sweet and half hot Italian sausage, along with 3 cups of sauerkraut (drained).  The filling seemed a tiny bit dry so I added some beef broth.  I used half shredded cheddar and half shredded fontina cheeses because that's what I had.  As another review noted, the dough is very stretchy so you can use a lot of meat to get a good bread to meat ratio.  I made them in different sizes and what worked best was about the size of regular hamburger bun.  This took about a 2 inch ball of dough rolled out and then stretched to go around about a 1/3 cup of meat.  Will be making again!

I've made a lot of tasty items based on recipes from here, and have never been compelled to review any of them until now. These are incredible.  From the bread to the inclusion of sausage, everything was amazing.  Stop looking for other recipes and get on this one immediately.

This was so tedious to make. For me, it took about 3 hours to make, but I'm pretty green to the whole cooking scene. I had a really hard time getting the dough even in thickness, so some of my bierocks broke while they were in the oven. In the end though, I felt like a baller making my own dough from scratch, and being mostly German, I got to call my family and brag about the endeavor. It's difficult to where I won't make it weekly, but tastes good enough to where it still makes the "special occasion" cooking list.

I just acquired my new bread machine and Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer.Have been trying different breads from All Recipes.Com.These Kraut Bierocks are delicious.A lot of hand work but worth it.But the stand mixer make the work much easier.My son and my husband ate 3 buns each.The recipe said it will yield 10 but they are so big so the other half of the dough, I made them smaller. and also I put more filling because the dough really stretched like a rubber, so easy to handle.I am sure every teacher at my school will ask for the recipe when I bring some for sampler.Thank you for this delicious and fantastic bread recipe...Neri Kwashima, Kawasaki, Japan

Great Recipe! I just made these for dinner and they were a hit! I used someones idea about using Rhodes rolls and it made it easy and convenient. Try using velvetta cheese and sharp cheddar. I will continue to makes these as they remind me of a neighbor who made them every halloween since I was a kid.

This is fantastic! I love cabbage but the rest of my family are not so fond of it but they loved these. The first time I made these I made exactly as the recipe says too but the 2nd time I had to use what I had which was 1 pound ground beef, 1/2 pound bacon, a can of seasoned cabbage and some Swiss cheese. Still delicious!! I am going to made some more today but make the filling with ham and sharp cheddar. Anyone that is using pre-made dough is really missing out because this dough is amazingly good and these also freeze great. Bake as directed, let cool, wrap in plastic wrap and put in a freezer bag. Heat in microwave about 2 minutes for a quick lunch for the kids.

We loved this! No side dish necessary. Not even sure what goes with this but me and my husband dipped it with mustard.  I didnt shred my cabbage; I chiffonade (sp?) it widely. I think I'll add more cabbage next time. Love the dough as well, altough, I had to add way more than it called for. Halved the recipe and got at least 15 bierocks if using 2 tablespoons of filling for a 1/4-1/3 cup dough (about an ice cream scooper size). The dough wrapped around the filling so nicely. Just make sure not to roll it out too thin because it will stretch a bit while baking. Also, I did an egg wash.

This filling was very very good, I couldn't get the dough to flatten out and was probably not patient enough, but I will definately make the filling again, maybe try it over some egg noodles next time!

We absolutely LOVED these!!  Super easy to make especially since I used the bread machine to make and rise the dough.  I did make one change, I decided to use beer bratwurst (casings removed before browning with beef) instead of italian sausage and it was so yummy!  Will definitely make again and again.  I made 16 bierocks with that amount of dough and once cooked with meat in the middle they came out to be the size of a regular hamburger bun, just right for holding.  I did have a small bowl of meat mixture left over.

very good bierock recipe - I use spicy mustard and only the cheddar cheese, doubled. The bread was also very easy to make and turns out wonderfully. I like to double the recipe and freeze the birocks after I bake them. They reheat really well in the microwave, and are great snacks or meals.

I made these for my younger brothers and it was a hit.  The bread mix was soft and smooth.  Although I didn't use the exact meat mixture.  I did the basic cabbage, hamburger, onion salt, pepper and cheddar cheese.

Loved this recipe!  It reminded me of the bierocks my grandmother use to make.  The only change is I used the bread machine sweet dinner roll recipe.  Much easier!  I will make it again.  My husband and all 3 of kids said they like it too (and this never happens)!

Yum, yum....these were so good and a neat change up in the dinner line up. I added some caraway (1T) seeds and I though that really added something to it...

I didn't have any shorting so I ended up using butter and it turned out out excellent. I used my kitchen aid to kneed the bread and found that I needed very little extra flour. I also used ground pork and and season it with red pepper flakes, fennel seed, paprika and italian seasoning.  I also took the advise of other and added extra cabbage and onion.  I ended up using cheddar cheese and mozzarella cheese instead.  Everyone loved this.

I've been making a similar variety for years, try using sourdough bread. Krusteaze make a box , add 1 cup water, rise 1 hour, then roll out and use kraut filling, I can make 8 very big beirocks with one box.  never thought of using mustard before, that is an interesting twist. but good!

My family really liked these.  I made the rolls exactly as the recipe stated, using my KitchenAid to do the kneading for me.  The dough was very nice and soft.  I used a variation of the filling:  1 lb of diced Kielbasa, a bag of preshredded coleslaw mix, 1 diced onion, prepared mustard, and pepper.  They were nummy!  My husband liked his dipped in coarse-ground mustard.  Thanks!

As others have stated, you need more flour than the recipe asks. I added an additional cup, so my total flour was five cups. Other than that, I think this is a great recipe!!

Loved this, used spicy Italian sausage and thought we would like it better with sauerkraut instead of plain cabbage.

This was super good.   It was time consuming but I imagine it will become faster as I do it more.  I read a lot of reviews, there are a lot of helpful tips in them, I'm not going to retype them all here, but I suggest you read some of the other reviews before you make this recipe.  I used 4 cups cabbage and carrot shredded together, 1 cup green pepper and 1 cup sauerkraut, we like a lot of veggies.  In fact, next time I may use just 1# of sausage and more veggies.  But that's just the veggie lover in me.

The filling was to die for!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't measure out the cabbage, I just used about 1/2 a head of it and it was just enough.  I also didn't use the dough from this recipe, I used the "Sweet Dinner Rolls" for the dough (since it's easy and I don't have powdered milk).  Turned out excellent, except I had more filling than dough.  Made them all and froze them.

Followed recipe exactly and they were FABULOUS!! Geez, the filling alone can be eaten by the bowl-full, its THAT good! 
Initially, these were made for a road trip because we're kind of over fast food and restaurant food and wanted to try something besides the ham and cheese sandwiches. These did NOT disappoint, even at room temperature.  We had plenty of additional bierocks that were truly enjoyed the remainder of the week.

My family loved these!  Thank you for the recipe. I'm German and French, but born in America.  Every once in a while my body gets a craving for an authentic German meal or a French dessert.  I swear it must be a genetic craving.  These definitely hit the spot last night.  They're perfect for my husband to take to work for lunch, easy to eat in the car, and great for freezing.  I can't wait to experiment with different authentic fillings for the family (my husband is Arab and my step-kids are Arab and Puerto Rican).  I've been trying to find some meals that remind the kids of their late Mother's cooking.  She was big on stuffed foods or foods wrapped around other foods.

Bierocks are a family favorite for us. I always add a little bit of cheddar cheese to the top of the meat pile before I seal up the bread dough. However I do just use hamburger and lots of spices instead of the sausage and no mustard. So just a few differences really. After they're cooked, cover them liberally with melted butter and I've never had left overs!

These were fabulous!  I used a large can of drained and quickly rinsed kraut and added garlic, but otherwise followed the filling recipe exactly.  I used Rhodes rolls and didn't defrost enough, so I had tons of extra filling and made them again the next night.  Initially, I made 12 rolls and my boyfriend ate 9 of them for dinner!  With 1/4 cup filling they baked up about the size of a baseball.  They are perfect little bundles and they came out with a perfect filling to dough ratio for my tastes.  I'll definitely be making these again!!

These were so good. I made them yesterday I used sauerkraut(1cup drained) because that was all I had in the fridge and I just had to try them. I am going to make them again next weekend for a crowd. I am hosting Thanksgiving dinner. I know they will be a hit.
Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe :)

This dough worked great.  I've made it twice and forgot the shortening in the 2nd batch, and it still worked well.  I like this filling, but I'm also going to try the dough for empanadas, as I think it will work for them also.

These were a crowd pleaser.  The recipe is easy and turned out prettier than the picture.  I did not use as much cheese as the recipe, but the dough was great, I will probably try with my favorite empanada filling. Thanks!

OMG I cannot believe I found this - I didn't even know how to spell it but once I saw it I knew it.  Years of growing up and now found - vindicated!  It exists!  We made these a lot over years - we used frozen diner rolls that rise as they thaw (Rhodes) the texas size diner rolls work best.  Then really it's just hamburger and cabbage cooked.  You have to roll out the diner rolls of course.  Put mean in middle - pick up twist and seat on cookie sheet on it's twist.  Quick and somewhat painless.  You can do full monty and make the dough but shortcuts are best.  It just isn't right without cabbage - would go to kraut with with it.  Just really jazzed I found it.  Haven't tried this particular recipe but give it a go my way or theirs.

the flavor of bread and filling was very good--even better than mother's!  like another reviewer, i let my bread machine do the mixing and rising of bread.  however, that was the only variance i made from the recipe.  when we  placed them in the baking dish, they "ran together" and we didn't get true individual pockets.  still delicious, but i think a baking sheet might do a little better.

1st off I didn't follow the hamburger/cabbage part of the recipe as shown & I only changed the bread recipe slightly - by doing 1/2c water & 1/2c milk.   Everyone has different tastes & I just made the inside mixture to my taste.  I say, start w/ the recipe & chg it as you try it again.  (I use salt, alot of pepper, a little garlic powder & allspice & mustard & sugar, & some worcestershire.)  No matter what spices you put in yours if you put a can of 98% ff cream of mushroom soup instead of the cheese it'll cut down on fat, but keep it creamy.  It does increase the sodium though.  I would say, though, that you do want the hamburger mixture to be pretty tasteful (almost too much so when you try it by itself) because when you put it with the bread it balances out.  -- I understand that the bread part of this recipe does take a long time, but you really should try it once when you have some time.  THE BREAD IS GREAT!  It's a little bland by itself, but put it with the hamburger mixture, which is very flavorful, it balances out wonderfully.  I did roll my bread out at about 1/4 in or a little less & came out with 10 large bierocks & still had extra, but I think the bread-to-hamburger ratio was good.  I froze the extra bierocks in aluminum foil for quick pop in the oven for later.  Used the extra dough to make a small loaf of cinnamon swirl bread.  I will use the dough recipe again, with a little salt to cut out the 'blandness' (for bread only recipe).  It's a good bread recipe!

These are wonderful! My Mother is German and she made these often for us when we were children. She suffers from dementia and I was unable to get the recipe from her.  I have searched for this recipe for years. Thanks for sharing because my family gobbled them up!

Made these for an Oktoberfest party and they were a smash!  Very tasty and cheesy.  There were scooped up right away.  The only thing I would do different is split the filling recipe in half because I ran out of bread dough half way through, either that or make twice the dough.  I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat to give it a little more flavor.  I put the leftovers in the fridge for the next day and made another batch of dough and it worked out perfectly!  Awesome!

I have been eating these all my life as my mother is half German. These are so versatile and ohhhh so good. My mother has added shredded carrots and used frozen bread dough or refrigerated biscuits as substitutes for making the dough. I have never had them with cheese in/on them but I bet they are good like that too. I also like dipping them in soy sauce, which makes them taste almost like Asian dim-sum.

I grew up in Kansas and my mother made these often. After finding this recipe, I decided to share them at a friends and family gathering. They disappeared within ten minutes. Highly recommended!

My family didn't care for the flavor of the meat filling. It freezes and reheats very well, so I hope to find a filling that works better.

Delicious!They freeze well too if wrapped tightly. The dough was the softest I have ever handled and the filling was great. We all loved the combination of ground meat cabbage and mustard! I gotta make this again..they are addictive!

these are great!  since i'm not a red meat eater, i made mine with ground turkey and turkey sausage.  very good, but i think next time i'll just double the ground turkey and leave out the sausage.  i love the bun, though!  and as most posters have stated, i needed LOTS more flour, 2 extra cups i think.

I agree with previous people. I needed to use more flour than the recipe calls for.  I also added extra cabbage.

I didn't have a problem with the dough - I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut the amount in half. I also used 1.5 C wheat flour and 2.5 C white - they turned out great!!!

I have been making these since I was a little girl, with my dad. His mother taught him to make them, and her mother taught her and so on. I have never seen a recipe for these, just made them from memory. I have heard that you can get these all over the midwest, and that makes sense since my dad and his family are from Nebraska. I usually don't use sausage with the meat, don't like the flavor, but otherwise, looks like a great recipe!!!

The filling was fantabulous.  The bread tasted really good after it was cooked, but was incredibly hard to work with - I added a cup and a half of flour above the 4 cups called for, and it was still too sticky to work.  (I had run out of flour or I would have continued adding)

These turned out awesome!! I had to leave the dry milk out of the dough (didn't have any), but didn't seem to affect the dough any. They tasted just like the runza's i remember eating while i was living in Neb. Maybe even better ;). Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good. I just used frozen bread dough to save time. The use of sausage and the velveeta cheese makes the filling different from the beirocks I'm used to making. These freeze nicely.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I didn't think it was amazing like so many others.  Although I do say they were better reheated after being frozen, than right out of the oven.  If I was to make this again though I have a few tips.  I would roll the dough out fairly thin so that you don't have lots of bites with only bread.  I would make sure to use the processed cheese (I didn't have any and didn't use it and I think it would be better with it.) These do freeze well but I'm not sure if I will make them again.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I gave it 4 star instead of five...( comparing it to the fabulous recipes on this site that I have made..but I did love it!) I will definitely make it again.  I doubled the amount of cheese because it seemed to need something.  I did not think it was difficult to make..but it did take a bit longer than the recipe suggested.  It was even better the second day!  A definite keeper!

I used kraut instead of cabbage and these were wonderful.  The leftovers are even great!
