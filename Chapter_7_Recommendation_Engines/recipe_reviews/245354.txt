Normally I wouldn't review my own dish, but I see where the "notes" got cut off here some.  I would like to mention a couple things, cutting recipe in half is easy of course, preferred first time possibly.  Pretty much 1 egg per 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk.  I find using a bit more corn starch insures the desired thickness.  Some like sweeter, so  you can add a bit more coconut sugar also when cooking.  Also, if you feel to thin a pudding, add a  bit of CHIA seed to thicken.  Remember, it continues to thicken as it sets.  So very little would be needed like 1 Tablespoon or less.
