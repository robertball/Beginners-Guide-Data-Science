THIS FUDGE GET MAJOR POINTS FOR BEING  THE EASIEST AND MOST KID FRIENDLY EVER!! I WAS A BIT WORRIED READING SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS BUT I DID FIGURE A FEW THINGS OUT ALONG THE WAY AS WE MADE ABOUT 6 BATCHES, JUST TO MAKE DUE TO THE EASE AND AFFORDABILTY. FIRST SPREAD IT A LITTLE THINNER THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD AND SECOND LET IT COOL IN THE FRIDGE FOR 5-6 HOURS BEFORE YOU CUT IT OR EVEN OVERNIGHT! OHHH AND WE ADDED COCONUT TO ONE BATCH AND IT WAS AWSOME!

Fudge is easy, but the recipe should state how many cans of frosting are needed.  2.5 cups is 2 cans of store bought frosting.

Taste is decent - better than store bought but not reminiscent in the least of the old fashioned fudge where there is a hint of butter.

You mean all these years I have been struggling to make good fudge and it's this easy to make GREAT fudge?  Yes, it can be too chocolaty...I added a little milk and a few marshmallows to the melted chips...and swirled some peanut butter chips in the mix.  I also added peanut butter on the top and swirled it through before refrigerating.  Plan to mix lots of ingredients in for a great holiday EASY treat for parties and for gift tins!

I looked at many other recipes before choosing this one and this BY FAR was the easiest and the cheapest. And you don't sacrifice any taste or anything! This was TO DIE FOR! After my friend made it the way the recipe called for I went back tonight and made it with White Chocolate Chips, Cream Cheese Frosting, and Dried Cranberries. OH-MY-GOD!!! This is a very forgiving recipe and possibly the best fudge I have ever had.

My 14 year old daughter made this recipe for a pot luck that she was attending, 
but used raspberry chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate, and it was very 
delicious and VERY popular!!

Ok, after making 4 batches, I figured out the BEST way to make this fudge and have it come out as the same consistency of more time consuming fudge, and just as good!  Melt your chcolate chips in large bowl in the microwave 30 seconds at a time and stir after each 30 seconds.  Once they are completed melted, add 2 huge spoonfuls of Marshmallow Creme and mix it in.  It will instantly become thick and hard to stir.  Put in microwave for 30 more seconds, stir.  Add 2 cans of choclate fudge frosting and stir WELL.  It will take a lot of stirring because it will be thick, but go quickly because it will set FAST!  Spread into prepared pan, refrigerate for 2 hours, then cover and refrigerate for at least 3 more hours or overnight.  Cut and enjoy!  Everyone who has tried this version CANNOT tell the difference between this fudge and the fudge I have to slave over and get exactly perfect ot it won't turn out right.  Trust me...skip the extra steps and all the prep time to make fudge---this recipe is great!!  And best of all, the kids can help!  3 ingredients...who can beat that??

This is a WONDERFUL base recipe for quick and yummy fudge! I used dark chocolate frosting and peanut butter chips and swirled in a bit of marshmallow cream -- it was a huge hit for the holidays!! :-)

It was super easy to make, but like others said it really tasted more like chocolate frosting than like original fudge. But it is an easy recipe, and if you melt the chocolate in the microwave, it is a kid friendly recipe.

Great recipe! I melted my chips in the microwave- 1 minute then stir and 35 more seconds then stir. I also used peanut butter chips with chocolate "fudge" frosting. Everyone loved them!!

After reading most of the reviews I noticed that some people thought that the results tasted too much like frosting so I changed the ingredients slightly.  First I melted the chips in a double boiler to keep them from burning.  Then I only used one can of frosting and changed that to Creamy Fudge frosting.  I also added 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of condensed milk.  After mixing in the chopped walnuts I refrigerated the fudge overnight and the next day presented it to the critics (my family).  The results?  They all thought that it was extremely good fudge.  Hope this works for you too.

Great base recipe. Here's what I used: 1-29.5 oz Duncan Hines Whipped Chocolate Frosting and 1-11.5 oz bag Milk Chocolate chips. Stir together and microwave for 2 min stirring every 30 seconds (so the chocolate doesn't burn). Add walnuts and stir. Pour in a pan. Refrigerate until firm. If you "melt" the frosting, you will not have the frosting taste. UPDATE: I made this with creamy white frosting, white choc chips, peppermint oil and crushed candy canes. OMG! Awesome! Everyone is requesting this recipe!

Very good!  For some fun you can put the still warm fudge into a cookie press and press out fun shapes onto wax paper.  Refridgerate until stiff and place on a platter for a pretty display.  We do this at Christmas in the shapes of christmas trees, stars, etc.

I followed directions exactly and it turned out well. I did find leaving the fudge in the fridge overnight worked well. Also, once I cut the fudge into squares,I allowed the fudge to sit another few hours to allow the freshly cut edges to dry a bit. This eliminated the wet feeling and made for a less messy simple fudge. Various changes in ingredients such as dark chocolate chips and swirling peanut butter into the fudge also made the fudge a bit more interesting. Overall its not a bad fudge for the time invested.For those who are so hard to judge,go buy a thermometer and make "real" fudge. For those looking for a quick version. This works very well. I do recommend using a Pyrex bowl and a pot of boiling water as a double boiler substitute..It does a great job!

Mine has been in frig for about an hour and I just sliced/scored it and put back to further "set", but so far it's fairly firm. I melted chips in microwave, added frosting, stirred vigorously, heated some more, stirred, added marshmallow creme, stirred vigorously and heated a bit more and stirred. Once mixed I poured onto waxed papered cookie sheet. As a mom of 2 lil ones I loved this recipe for being cheap, fast and easy. Here are the changes I made:

1) I measured out 2 1/2 cups w measuring cup of frosting because 2 containers of frosting would be about 3+ cups and I wonder if this is why the poor reviewers said theirs never set. I used Betty Crocker Choc Buttercream.

2)Per some other reviews I added some marshmallow creme (Jet Puff), I used 2 heaping TABLESPOONs (no one stated in other reviews HOW MUCH).

3) I had a few Oreo mint cookies leftover from making a St Paddys dessert so I crushed up and added to mix before pouring onto cookie sheet.

I made these, and although they are certainly edible, and tasty as well... they really aren't fudge.  The melting point is too low, they melt all over your fingers and they are altogether a different texture than true fudge. Keep in mind, I have high expectations, my mother makes famous old fashioned fudge, and that's what I grew up on.  This recipe makes a fairly tasty candy of sorts, but if you are expecting a true, classic fudge, this isn't it.

This way way too easy and incredibly scalable!  I made one batch as listed, but also one batch subbing the chocolate chips for white chocolate, the chocolate frosting for cream cheese, and the walnuts for cranberries.   I can only imagine a plethora of possibilities . . . . dark chocolate chips and frosting with crushed peppermint candies . . . Cherry chips and cherry chip frosting with chocolate sprinkles and pecans . . . yummmm  The only note I will share is that it takes FOREVER to set up properly.  Should I have waited the alloted time listed, I would have thrown the whole deal out.  Easy, but perhaps not quick.

Very easy.  Very tasty!  We made two batches.  Milk chocolate & peanut butter cup.  For the milk chocolate, we left out the nuts (we have tree nut allergies in our house).  So it was basically just the chocolate chips and frosting.  For the other batch, I chopped up 12 mini peanut butter cups and folded them in before pouring the mix into the 8x8 pan.  I also substituted 1/2 cup peanut butter for a 1/2 cup of the frosting (added it while the mixture was still hot).  Then, once I had the mixture in the 8x8 pan, I spooned 4 or 5 globbers of peanut butter on top and swirled it into the fudge.  YUM!

Best fudge recipe ever. To make this easier, use 1 can prepared frosting to 1 bag of chocolate chips. Also, using a double boiler makes the melting a little less stressful.  I have made countless variations of this and they are all really great. My personal favorite was peppermint frosting and milk chocolate chips.  If you use german chocolate icing with milk chocolate chips and add some marachino cherries and nuts it's like rocky road fudge. Milk chocolate frosting with peanut butter chips is great too. Any combination of prepared frosting and chips will work...even butterscotch chips!

Oh MY can you get any easier??? This took me moments to make and tastes great. Not the most sophisticated, but for the ease of making and not needing condensed milk (which I can't have anyway) it was delicious!

This in Not fudge... If you want true fudge, I would recommend a different recipe.  This does have a nice taste and a very smooth texture. Cut these into bite-size pieces or you will have fingers full of melted chocolate.  Three stars for flavor and texture, but only three for calling this fudge.

This was a very easy, kid friendly recipe.  Although it did have that "canned frosting" taste, it was still good.  I followed the advice of another comment which suggested using white chocolate chips, cream cheese frosting and cranberries.  Wow!  What a great Christmas gift idea!  My neighbors loved it!

I made this with my 11 y/o "little sister" and it was perfect. We followed the recipe to the letter and it was great.

I will never use another recipe for fudege!  The only change I made was to add in the marshmellow cream that others recomended (I found that the generic brand came out better than using the Jet-Puffed one).  For Christmas, we got a container of the "labor intensive" fudge and when I compared it with this recipe, I far preferred this recipe!  With this recipe I was actually able to afford to make and give away fudge for Christmas!  And, I got lots of compliments on it!

As a traditional fudge maker I was skeptical of this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the final product.  I followed the instructions exactly with the exception of adding a splash of milk. I felt that the melted chocolate chips were too dry and needed something to make it more creamy. Make sure the chocolate chips are completely melted before you add the frosting. I too used TWO cans of the chocolate fudge frosting.   Also, you may feel that an 8x8 pan will not yield enough, but it does, as the pan is filled! Cut your pieces small due to thickness. You will not be dissatisfied with this simple, delicious treat.

#2  REVIEW  This fudge is best if it is cold from the frig. and yes, you can substitute and change ingredients, as long as you stay with the base script.

WOW! I have never ever made anything like fudge before. This is super easy! I didnt add the walnuts but sprinkled the top with coconut instead. I cant wait to share it with my family when they are here for dinner! Lets just hope I can keep my hands out of it. Great job on this one!

Love to make this fudge, except I make it in the Microwave.  I put it in for 20 seconds and stir and repeat until it is melted.  To yummy.  Someone suggest to put the fudge in one of those things you make cookies with and squirt it out to make different shapes.

Very easy to make. Used peanut butter chips with a dash of vanilla and walnuts with cream cheese frosting as the bottom layer,  Milk Chocolate chip and chocolate frosting  added dash of milk and vanilla and melted the frosting, as a previous reviewer suggested. in the pan- used a homemade double boiler.   My four year old was able to help with the project and we had a great time.  YUMMY !!!!!

Not bad for cheating and not having to cook from scratch. Can be a bit frosting tasting to some palates. I added walnuts and dried cranberries to one batch using white chips and white frosting. Simple enough for kids and easy to adapt for different flavors. Great in a pinch.

So simple to make!  I used Chocolate Fudge Icing...it brought out more of the fudgy taste, rather than just chocolate icing.  Next time I'm going to try peppermint chips instead of chocolate.

Okay this may sound obvious but this tastes very much like frosting! I do like it and it is easy but it is not as much like fudge as I was hoping. Will I make it again: Maybe, if I need something fast, I usually have the ingredients on hand.

This is the easiest fudge recipe ever! And it tastes great too! I used a bag of chocolate chips, 5 or 6 marshmallows and a container of chocolate fudge frosting. I melted it all in the microwave, refrigerated it in the pan, and presto: super easy and delicious fudge.

I used the milk chocolate frosting and semi sweet chips to keeoo it from being too sweet and "frosting" tasting.  I then added a teaspoon of vanilla , 1/8 teaspoon of salt and some cashew pieces . I dropped it onto wax paper like you would haystacks instead of pouring in a pan .my stepdad flipped over it !!! Its so simple and easy not to mention delish !

I'll give this a four for being tasty and the easiest recipe ever (will still go in my box for kids).  It reminds me of the fudge they sell in the grocery store.  That being said neither that nor this are "fudge" to me.  Too gooey.  The fudge I ate growing up was a little hard, then melted i your mouth.  Each to their own I guess, tasted like frosting so I suppose it would be good modified maybe with flavored chocolate chips and nuts to distract from the frosting overkill.

This is a great and simple recipe. After trying to make real fudge the hard way  for gifts, and ending up with five pounds of goo...I found this recipe in an attempt to fix bad fudge (which I guess is impossible).  I have used this recipe several times and like to vary it by using different frostings, and different chips such as butterscotch with cream cheese frosting and macadamia nuts. The combination possibilities are endless.  !!!Also you can melt the chips in the microwave for approximately 1 minute and as long as you stir the chips so they are melting evenly, you can prevent it from burning. Using pyrex also helps more evenly distribute the heat.

I thought it was a great recipe, but a tad too chocolatly. The walnuts really complimented the chocolate. Without them, it would be like dipping dark chocolate into frosting. I made it for my sister for a little birthday present and the whole family loved it.

I have made four batches. Easy as can be. I microwaved chips, and used the fudge icing as two reviewers suggested. I did add a little vanilla extract from Mexico, just a splash. AMAZINGLY EASY AND TASTY!

A great basic fudge. My husband loves cream cheese icing with coconut. My favorite is chocolate fudge icing with peanut butter chips. I do add a little milk to the chips while they are melting. It's extremely unhealthy (but then again what fudge isn't?) but the good thing is, it is so rich you can eat one piece and be satisfied. Leave it in the fridge until serving, other wise it loses it's firmness and turns back into an icing consistency.

This is one of the best, easy recipes I have ever tried. No one would ever guess that you didn't spend hours making this fudge. I have shared it with so many friends who agree with me. It has become the "standby" for an instant dessert or party item.

We love this recipe, and came to use it often during the holiday season.  So many creative flavor combinations!  I mix the ingredients in a batter pouring bowl and pour directly into candy (mini muffin) papers in a mini muffin tray.  There is no mess to clean up, no cutting, and I generally get exactly 48 pieces from one batch.

Good for an easy alternative for homemade fudge. First time was ok. Then I read others had heated chocolate chips before mixing and had wonderful results! I do not reccommend the white chocolate only because it did taste like melted white icing, and I even had the crushed candy canes

While I can't argue that the children ate it up, the adults, including myself, did not like it.   It was difficult to cut without squishing, even after it sat in the fridge overnight, and it stuck to our fingers when we ate it.

I was a little hesitant, because I really don't like the taste of frosting at all, but this really didn't taste like either of the ingredients. They combine to form something much, much better than I would have expected.

Wow! This is one of the easiest things I've ever made! Of course it isn't going to taste like Grandma Betty's 1906 State Fair Fudge, but the point is that it has two ingredients (without the nuts) and tastes like fudge! Wonderful.

I really liked the taste of this fudge, although visually, it didn't look much like the picture posted. : ) I added crushed pecans, walnuts, and cranberries.  My suggestion is to refrigerate for several hours before cutting.  Nice, easy, recipe especially for last-minute preparations.

My mother has always made the best fudge I've ever eaten....this was as close as anyone has ever gotten to good ol' mom's recipe!  Did I mention has easy it was? I used dark chocolate frosting as recommended by someone who rated this recipe and it was fabulous!  I will pass this on to everyone I know who loves fudge!  Thanks for sharing!

The fudge was way too soft and tasted like...like frosting and chocolate chips. Maybe I didn't like because I don't really like fudge that much or maybe it was becuase my kid brother tried to sell them to me for outrageous prices

This was 5 stars for taste and ease, however it is a little softer then traditional fudge.  If it's kept in the fridge, it's perfect.

By far the easiest fudge recipe I've made. My friends didn't believe it was just chocolate chips and chocolate frosting. The downside is that it melted and got squishy if left out of the fridge. Next time I'd add some baking wax to help it firm up. I put crushed Andes mints in part of the batch, and it was great!

This tasted great but it was pretty much just squares of frosting. I put it in the fridge to harden and when I tried it it was great until I tried cutting it into pieces and it slowly softened back into its original state of chocolate muck.

This fudge was wonderful! Very easy! My husband wants me to make it for his co-workers and was suprised that I only used three ingredients. 

I used pecans instead of walnuts and it was great! It cools in 2-3 hours. Perfect if you want to make some for a lunch party.

Delicious and almost too easy!!!!!  I was even able to make a few batches - one with 1/3 c. of peanut butter and another batch with 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepermint flavoring and then put crushed candy cane on top.  All the batches have gone over VERY well.

I change the size of the pan. For me the 8 by 8 was to small so I used casserole instead. I love this new kind of fudge it was easy to make and really smooth. It is a keeper.

Easy and Delicious! Use 1/2 teaspoon of good vanilla and use a little real butter (1-2 tablespoons) or good coconut oil to melt the chips. 1 bag of morsels & can of frosting (not the whipped). So many different combinations you can come up with.So many people think marshmellow cream is needed to make fudge when really original old time fudge never called for marshmellow cream or condensed milk.  If you in a hurry this can be made in minutes and very good.

Okay, so I super simplified this as I was in a hurry - two bags of chocolate chips (small) and two cans of ready made frosting...OMG...SOOOO GOOD...so smooth and creamy...everyone LOVES this fudge. Keep it in the fridge and it tastes just like chocolate ice cream - YUMMY!!!

Easy, yes. But it definitely tastes like frosting. It was fine in VERY small quantities, but I'll definitely go back to the marshmellow creme based one next time.

It was SUPER EASY and it tasted okay.  I added marshmallows and graham cracker to it which I liked because it gave it a better consistency than just the plain batch I made.

I just made this for the first time and it was absolutely great!!! You can definitely taste the chocolate frosting, but hey, who doesn't like the taste of chocolate frosting! It was so easy and totally delicious! Even my mom, who usually doesn't get overly excited about chocolatey foods was getting a big second piece saying, "Oh, I hope you don't mind if I have just a little bit more" and going back to "even out the edges." I would make this fudge again in a heartbeat.

I’m not a chocolate fan, but my husband, kid, and neighbors are.  I was looking to find the easiest fudge recipe and this is it!  It only took me 5 minutes to throw this together.  I used 50% milk chocolate chips and 50% peanut butter chips and melted it in the microwaved for one minute, stirred it, and microwaved it for another minute.  I mixed it with a triple chocolate frosting.  It was very good once it hardened up in the fridge.

I give this 5 stars because it's so easy!  I'd give it 4.5 stars for flavor because I do still love my own fudge better.  This is good stuff.  I made 1/2 a batch with no nuts and the other 1/2 I added cashews and craisins to.  I ate some of the no-nut fudge with natural p.b. on top and that was great!  I look forward to experimenting with different flavors!
