This is a good recipe that will turn out better the more you practice your dipping.

One change I would recommend, though, is in the method of setting the chocolate.  It's much better to let the chocolate set at room temperature because if you set chocolate in the fridge, you need to keep it refrigerated so it doesn't melt.  Chocolate that's set at room temperature will tend to hold its shape and solidity better in warmer temperatures.

I made these for a long distance family reunion and they didn't last long.  I agree you do need to practice the dipping but practice is fun!  Also with the different flavors of chocolate sandwich cookies now you can have fun with your flavors or go double stuffed...fun recipe to do with the kids, they can put the teddy graham on.

These tasted great.  However, I had a very hard dipping them - I either broke the cookies by pushing the fork down too far, or I was unable to get the cookie off the fork once it was dipped, ruining part of the liquid chocolate layer.  I ended up using 2 forks and transfer the cookie between them when dipping.  But, they got rave reviews even if they didn't look perfect.

These could have been nothing more than just chocolate covered oreos, but the addition of peanut butter chips and a teddy graham turned them into something cute, delicious and professional looking. I used double-stuff peanut butter oreos for more peanut butter, and they came out great.

These deserve 5 stars just for presentation and ease. The kids had a ball making them and they come out very professional looking.
