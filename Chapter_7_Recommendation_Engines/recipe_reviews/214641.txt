This was good. It was very sweet - so I would like it more for a snack than with dinner. I made my own chutney so only added "regular" chuntey and no "hot" chutney (my mom doesn't do spicy). I would like a little more quinoa for the amount of "mix-ins". Definitely a nice recipe though!!!

Go easy on the macadamia nuts, or chop them finer because too many makes this dish way too crunchy. The dried fruit is nice, but this recipe is better if you just use fresh fruit. The dried fruit makes it kind of gummy and difficult to chew. Otherwise it still tastes good.

Ridiculously delicious.  I had to substitute mango salsa for the chutney, but it was fantastic.  Best recipe I've tried on here yet.

Good with grilled chicken, but not as good alone. A little too sweet on its own.

Great recipe! We followed the advice of one reviewer and used fresh fruit chopped into smaller pieces.  We also cooked the quinoa, let it cool, then added remaining the ingredients (pre-chilled the fruit) and served it as a cold side dish.  Very refreshing with just the right amount of kick from the hot mango chutney. Party guests ate it all...sorry we didn't have any leftovers for ourselves.  Serving cold adds time to the recipe, but you could make the quinoa ahead of time and then put the entire dish together when ready to serve.

Used fresh fruit instead of dried (cut down on sweetness and rubbery factors) and couldn't find chutney so used mango salsa instead. Yumm!

I thought this was delicious, although a bit sweet.  We couldn't find different heats for the chutney, so we just used all medium heat.  Will definitely make again!

Only had the hot mango chutney and skipped the coconut because I don't like coconut flavors. These two ingredients may make the entire dish because I was underwhelmed. May try again with the mango salsa. It is sweet, as other reviewers say. More like a side dish or good with grilled chicken.
