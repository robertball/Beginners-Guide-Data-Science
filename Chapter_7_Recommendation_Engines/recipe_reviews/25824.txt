I used a "supreme" brownie mix with chocolate chunks already in it used dark rum and replaced the 1 C of almonds with 1/4 C chopped peanuts. These were easy to make and taste fairly good but the alcohol flavor is fairly strong. The top also looks too bubbly although the texture inside seems okay (not sure why that happened). If I make these again I would definitely use less rum or possibly light rum or both.

This morning I tried this recipe for the first time. Not having any run I substituted what I had (blackberry brandy) AND it is better than a 5 star!

I followed the suggestions of a few others and used Blackberry Brandy. The flavor was good but the brownies stuck to the bottom of the pan. I made 2 batches: one with M&Ms and one with chocolate chips. The flavor was awesome but they looked horrible.

This was a pretty good recipe. I had to cut the recipe in half because I only had a 10.25oz. brownie mix. Because of this I used half of all the ingredients used a 8x8 pan and cooked it for 19 minutes. Also all I had was cinnamon applesauce (made no difference).

Very nice! I did not have almonds and used pecans instead. I think the almonds would've been better. I used the single serving applesauce containers--one is not quite a half cup so I used part of a second container. Next time I'll use both containers of applesauce because I think the recipe could use a tad more moisture; but then I used a regular brownie mix and not one with a chocolate packet.

Not bad. I had to make a 1/2 batch based on my brownie mix. I couldn't taste the rum at all. I will say the almonds were kinda strange. Not bad just strange. Satisfied a chocolate craving.
