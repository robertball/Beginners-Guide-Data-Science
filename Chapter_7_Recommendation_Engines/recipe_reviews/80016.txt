I was impressed with the flavor in these burgers--I love curry but had never tried it on/in beef, so its use here was a pleasant surprise.  I halved the recipe and it still made three relatively large burgers.  The lime sauce was good, but the combination of sour/spicy just wasn't working for me so I added about a teaspoon and a half of sugar to the lime sauce, which I thought tasted much better with the spicy jerk seasoning.  This is a great grown-up  burger (kids probably wouldn't like it).

A keeper!  Spicy, but not killer hot.  The lime mayo was an excellent counterpoint to the zing of the burgers.  I might make it a bit more lime-y next time, but this is an easy, well-appreciated burger recipe!
