This was absolutely awful. I made it as a special treat for my daughters sleepover, and even a gaggle of hungry little girls picked at it. Soggy with little hard bits in it. I'm pretty good at making pancakes, so I think that the recipe was at fault.

I had hoped I'd end up with something like IHOP's Harvest Grain Pancakes.  I didn't, but I ended up with something pretty good.  I had to substitute a Kroger brand of banana crunch cereal, since they didn't have the Post, but these were fine.  They cooked up nice and fluffy - a sifting of powdered sugar is a nice addition.
