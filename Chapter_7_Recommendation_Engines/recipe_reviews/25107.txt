These are wonderful! I LOVE peanut butter, and with the chocolate, who can resist?  These are SOOOOOOO wonderful! I made them for a church outing and people kept coming up to me asking where I found the recipe, and if they too could have the recipe. These are a huge hit with everyone, and I now have three requests to make these for parties in the future. Even people who do not like peanut butter will love this recipe! Trust me people, you NEED to try this!!!

This is potentially an awesome cookie with just a few small changes. They definitely need more chopped peanut butter cups.  I didn't have any on hand so after the first batch I added about a cup of semisweet mini chocolate chips and it made a huge difference--the cookies went from just good to absolutely delicious. The dough was very soft and sticky so I put them in the fridge for about 15 minutes and then baked them for 13 minutes--perfect!! Will definitely make again.

I have been looking for a chocolate cookie recipe for the past 2 holidays
I thought this sounded interesting and made a batch
I have to tell you, this is one of the best cookies I have ever eaten.
The one change I would suggest, it needs a minimum of 2 cups of peanut butter cups

I was looking for a great tasting peanut butter cookie and stumbled on this one.  I figured that since the recipe called for peanut butter chips and peanut butter cups, it would be exactly what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, I didn't taste any peanut butter at all.  I tried the cookies again, but this time I only melted the chocolate chips and folded in the peanut butter chips with 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter cups.  They were perfect!

This is good. Would be better if you baked the plain batter (minus the peanut butter cups) in mini-muffin pans. Then when cooked, remove from the oven and immediately push a peanut butter cup into the center of each "muffin". Let cool for 5 mins and enjoy!

These were good, but mine turned out on the flat side.  Did anyone else have that problem?  I did chill the dough like one reviewer recommended, and it was humid outside, which perhaps affected the texture.  I had also taken the advice of a few other reviewers, added 2 c pb cups and did not melt the pb chips with the chocolate ones.  I will probably make again but mix in regular peanut butter with the melted chocolate like one reviewer recommended, and add some chocolate chips in with the pb chips.  Overall, a good recipe.

This was actually quite good. I know that the author was trying to infuse the "peanuty" flavour by melting the peanut butter chips into the dough, but what I found worked much better is melting 1/2 a cup of actual peanut butter in with the chocolate, and mixing in the peanut butter chips whole. This creates a great peanuty flavour and texture. Hope this helps.

I made these cookies for my office, and they were gone within 2 days.  I took the advice already listed and added 2 cups of peanut butter cups.  I also used milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet.

I liked the consistency of this cookie and the flavor. Very sweet but a nice change of pace from our usual chocolate chip cookies.

These cookies were great.  They made so many that one cup of chopped peanut butter cups wasn't nearly enough.  Will make again and add more cups!!!!

Eh.  I made these as part of a cookie tray for the 4th of July - alongside chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and orange-sugar.  By the end of the cookout all the other cookies were gone, and I had more than half of these left and not one request for the recipe.  

They don't have a pronounced chocolate/peanut butter flavor - if I hadn't known what was in it I wouldn't have been able to guess.  They do have good chew and texture.  They're not awful, but I wouldn't make them again.

I used tiny, chip-sized peanut butter cups, and the cookies were a huge hit with everyone who had some!

These cookies are great. I made them for Christmas and everyone loved them, they were gone with in an hour. I also agree with the previous posts to add 2 cups of the peanut butter cups.

Very good cookies.  I was silly and substituted white choc chip for semi-sweet, and they turned out a little sweeter than I like.  I think next time if I decide to try it again with white chocolate chips, I'll cut out 1/2 of the white sugar.  Still, these were some darn tasty cookies!  Yum!
