These ribs were terrific!  I made them a bit differently then the recipe said to, but they turned out great!!!!  Instead of going from parboil/fry/oven, I just threw all the ingredients together to make a marinade, and put in the fridge for a few hours...(I also didn't have any dry mustard, so I just added a squeeze or 2 of prepared mustard)  Then I put the ribs and marinade in a glass baking dish and threw them in the oven @ 325 till they were done.  VERY VERY VERY YUMMY!!!  Thanks for the great recipe HOWITZER!

I was looking for a different flavor for some country style ribs (boneless) I had on hand and thought I'd try this out.  I cut up the meat into bite sized pieces, boiled for 1/2 hour, drained and then followed the recipe being sure to brown the meat well.  It was absolutely delicious!  I used rice vinegar as it didn't specify what type and served over white rice.  Both the boyfriend and I just loved it, he would have preferred a bit thinner sauce to mix into the rice but I thought it was fine.  Best sweet & sour we've ever had.  This is going in the recipe box and will be repeated again and again!!!

UPDATE!!!  I cut some pork loin chops into bite sized cubes, shook in salted, peppered flour, browned in oil & then added the liquid with one addition, about a teaspoon of freshly grated ginger.  WOW!  That brought it to an all new level of delicious!

this recipe was really tasty and really easy but I must say I didnt follow the recipe totally.  I mixed everything in a bowl and after my meat was cleaned and seasoned I poured the mixture on top and baked slow at 300 degrees it came out outstanding will definately try this again with pineapple chunks!!!

This will be my new rib standard recipe!  The dish turned out wondefully...moist meat, and yummy flavors.  I did make the following adjustments:  less soy sauce and water, used brown sugar instead of white, and used rice vinegar.  The sauce thickened up nicely with the use of slightly less liquids.

The pork ribs were delicious!  I didn't have dried mustard, so I just left it out, they still turned out great.  Perfect over rice.

WOW AWESOME!  The whole family loved it and there was NO left overs! Wonderful. I have also made the sauce without the Ribs, and then poured the sauce over Fried Chicken Nuggets, and also Fried Popcorn shrimp! It's GOOD, and I agree that whatever you use the sauce on, it goes good with rice!

I've been looking for a sweet and sour spare rib recipe that's close to our favorite Chinese restaurant for years and this is it! I can't believe how easy this was, with ingredients I keep on hand plus taste fantastic! By the time I talked my son into letting me use this recipe instead of his store bought terriyaki sauce, he had already seared the country ribs in a skillet. All I had to do is cut them into bite size pieces and whip up this sauce. He only let me simmer it on the stove top for about 20 minutes and it was wonderful over steamed white rice. The only change I made was cut back on the salt ( we aren't use to a lot of salt in our diet) to 1/2 t. I did add 1 small can of pineapple tidbits with juice and about 1 cup of red, orange and yellow bell pepper thinly sliced. It was so good. I also used rice vinegar. I didn't know if the apple cider vinegar would be overpowering. Next time I'll try brown sugar just for curiosity and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if my son gives me time. LOL  Update: I made this again but this time I omitted the salt and just sprinkled the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder before browning. I also cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was perfect. Don't be afraid to use apple cider vinegar, it's not too strong.

These came out really good! My kids told me to definitely make this recipe again!  I browned the ribs in oil and garlic, and then whisked the rest of the ingredients together.  I used mostly white sugar but did use some brown sugar. I marinated the ribs for an hour or so, and then put the ribs and all of the marinade in the oven for approx. 1.5 hours.  The sauce came out perfectly, and the ribs looked wonderful plated.  I served the ribs with rice.

Great! Followed the recipe as written, but added juice from an 8 oz. can of pineapple chunks to the sauce. While the meat and sauce was simmering, I stir fried some onion, celery, carrot, which I added to pan along with the pineapple chunks just before serving. Yummy! Served with rice. Will definitely make again.

Really great sauce!  I followed the procedure exactly and the ribs turned out really well.  I changed the ingredients just a bit.  I doubled the garlic and also added pineapple chunks as was suggested by another reviewer.  Was great over brown rice!

Great recipe!  I used half white sugar half brown sugar and red wine vinegar because that is what I had and I prepared the sauce as the ribs boiled.  I saved the broth and used it in the sauce instead of the water.  It came out great!  The kids all loved it.  Thanks!

This was an awesome recipe!!! I had started to cook another stove top recipe that used garlic, bay leaves, parsley, rosemary and oregano and lime juice and it didn't seem to have the taste I liked, so I boiled for the 10 min. and then drained it and added this sauce. I didn't have 2 lbs of ribs, so I added half of the sauce to the pan with ribs and cooked the rest in a separate pan to use later. My husband loved it!

I subbed 1 lb. cubed pork for the ribs (it was what I had), but followed the recipe as far as boiling the meat, draining, browning in oil, and simmering in the sauce (the time was a little shorter than as written).  My 4 year old daughter (who doesn't often finish her dinner) raved about it served over white rice, and even had a second plate!  My super picky husband said it's his favorite pork dish I've made in 7 years of marriage.  This one is a definite keeper for us.  I steamed some broccoli and we loved it with the sauce.  It was similar to eating Chinese food, but better because it was homemade and much healthier!

Tried it, myself and my family think it was a wonderful dish. Needs a little less sugar, but great. We added pineapple, crushed, minus the juice and enjoyed it very much. Thank you. Easy to prepare. Marcie

I found this recipe REALLY salty.  I will make it again without the tsp of salt.  The other strike against it is it looks really unappetizing, just a brown slimy sauce. Luckily it tastes better than it looks.  It's a good sweet & sour for people who don't like pineapple (like my husband, he loved this).  Because of the reviewers who said it dried out too fast, I cooked it with the lid on for the first 1/2 hour and then uncovered after adding the garlic.  Plus I cooked it an extra 20 minutes for tenderness.  The tenderness and the sauce consistency turned out just fine that way.

Very yummy.  I will be making this again definitely.  Something is a bit off about the sauce...it might be the fact that I had to use prepared mustard (I didn't have any dry), or perhaps something would be gained by adding ginger as one review said.  And by off I don't mean bad at all!!!  The balance just seems to be a tiny bit off, and it would take a better cook to figure that out than me!  Next time I will add some ginger (didn't have any this time) and I'm super excited to try it the way one reviewer did, with cubed pork loin!  Delish!!

This is my husband's all time favorite meal!  I do the recipe exactly as it is, except I cook it in a slow cooker for 8 hours.  Served with rice is best.

Make this often and use pork button bones. Because they are leaner I added beef broth so the sweet sauce stayed right consistency and didn't burn. Need about 1/4 cup once in the 30 min simmer. Added again 1/4 cup beef broth and then garlic and simmered again.

I have made this twice now. The first time i was a little rushed and didn't think the flavors were as intense, although my husband loved them. The next time, i used my crock pot after searing them first. They were very tender(falling off the bone) and flavorful. I used regular mustard as i didn't have dry. My kids thought the crockpot version was better.

MMMMMM YUMMY!!! These ribs were so good!!! My boyfriend loves his moms sweet and sour ribs and he said these were better.  Per another reviewer I used BBQ sauce instead of soy sauce and I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The flavor was fantastic!!!!!

I followed the directions exactly except the garlic, and it wasn't pleasing at all.  The sauce isn't what I thought it would be.  In my opinion this was to much work for a not so great dinner.

I agree: the sauce is excellent with the meat and over rice. Next time, I'm going to omit the salt and use light soy sauce. This was pretty salty, and I'd rather add-to-taste.

I had bone-in country style ribs, so I made the sauce and put them in the slow cooker, then de-boned them. I could have stopped there, but I decided to put the meat under the broiler to give it a darker texture. That worked out well.

This is a nice change from the usual BBQ sauce treatment.

I've made this recipe over a dozen times now and its great! Especially since I always seem to find ridiculously good deals on country ribs! I've been making my moms sweet n sour chicken for a while and wanted to try something new. So I stumbled upon this recipe. My mom came to visit last month so I made her this and she LOVED it. Definitely a hit! I do add less water though because I like a thicker sauce. I always make fried rice packed with veggies, egg and brown rice. Oh boy is it good together.. ??

I love this recipe.  Didn't do all the things it said to do but went with one of the reviewers and just mixed everything and put it in the oven at 325 and cooked until they were done.  I used cider vinegar and would cut back on the amount called for in the recipe a little next time.  This is a great recipe if you want to do a lot of ribs for a lot of people with little or no fuss for you.  I used boneless pork ribs and will just make a couple of salads and that should about do it.  Great taste.

Fast, easy and delicious - I added a bit of garlic powder to the dry mix and then browned the ribs in garlic infused oil.  This one is a keeper.

First time I made these I followed the instructions exactly...except I cooked them in a slow cooker and they were AMAZING.  Since then I've probably made them a dozen times and have evolved the recipe to suit our tastes.  I add crushed pineapple , candied ginger pieces and some maple syrup and YUM!!!  These can't be beat!

So delicious.  These ribs are so tasty, what a nice sauce!  I browned the ribs in some olive oil and placed them in the slow cooker for 6-8 hours on low (with the sauce of course).  The meat just fell off the bones.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the sauce instead of 2 and I added it at the start.  Definitely a "keeper".

Boiled the pork for 30 mins then dumped everything in the slow cooker. Cooked on low for 8 hours took pork out and shredded with two forks. Put the pork back in with the sauce for a few minutes. Served over white rice. Next time I will cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. And although I didn't think it was too salty I think I'll cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon next time. Make sure you use low sodium soy sauce

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to omit the par boil step and only because I love the crispness of the ribs you get from baking them in their own fat.  This sauce is amazing & definatley on our Fav List!!

The sauce alone in this recipe deserves 5 stars! I've used it for ribs in the past but tonight decided to try it as a stirfry sauce since it's so yummy. I sauteed some thinly sliced pork with some celery, carrots, bell pepper, baby corn and onion. Once they were almost done I tossed in the sauce along with some drained pineapple. Delicious! I've also added grated ginger to this to give it even more zing. This recipe is a keeper!

Soooo delicious and soooo easy!  I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted worchestershire sauce for the soy sauce and vinegar and it worked.  I also saved the water from boiling the pork and threw in a handful of baby carrots which I added to the pork when the garlic went in. I will be making this one again!

Very easy to prepare. I love the fact that I had the list of ingredience in my pantry, and that some of the ingedience were substitutable with others. An example would be for the vinegar or using brown sugar instead of standard white. 
If you think i'st a bit on the sweet side, just cut back on the sugar.
My husband thought it a bit sweet so I will do this the next time around.
I also cooked mine in the oven at 325 for 50 to 55 min.

This sauce was fantastic.  I used pork cubes, did a quick stir fry with them to brown, then cooked in the sauce like the recipe said.  After about 30 min the sauce wasn't as thick as I had hoped for, so I added 1T of cornstarch to some water and stirred that in.  Instant sticky sauce.  No need to cut back on the liquid if you do this.  This sauce would be great on boneless chicken too!  Thanks for sharing this one.

This was very very delicious!! The sauce had a little trouble thickening so I added a bit more flour but it turned out great! My family loved it and I will definately put it on the regular menu.

Absolutely delicious! I used country ribs, and they turned out wonderfully. I didn't use the mustard (personal choice) and had to use garlic powder at the end. Even my 3 and 1 year olds ate it!

Very good.  I did the same thing as the previous reviewer - stir fried some onion, carrots, & celery adding pineapple chunks and the juice (at the beginning of cooking).  Next time I'll throw in a green pepper too!  Picky children weren't overly fond of it :(

Served this with roasted peppers & garlic.  Delicious.  Used apple cider vinegar and mushroom soy sauce from an Asian grocery.  Low sodium is best.  Cooked as indicated but then finished the cooking process by baking covered in a 275 oven for 60-70 minutes.  The meat was tender and flaked easily.  Served with extra sauce.  Everyone loved it.

Made this tonight, it was delicious. I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used more garlic. The ribs came out very tender, I used boneless country style.  Definitly serve over rice, it makes a great sauce.  Thanks for sharing a great famly recipe.

This recipe is so yummy! The first time I made it, wow! The next time, I added 1/4 cup of Heinz Chili Sauce, which was also tasty. It can be made smaller or bigger depending on how much meat you have.

this is good. Wife loved it, and that's where it's at.  I'll make it again.
   I used yellow rice. Skipped the boil, Simmered in big iron skillet for 45 min.
  ha ! the wife stuffed herself with it.
                            Thank You

Made this almost exactly
Boiled ribs for 10 then browned in pan on high and flipping lots for about 10 and then put in oven at 325 for 45 minutes covered with foil. Let cool a bit and served. The meat was perfect. 
I didn’t have mustard so I added ginger powder instead and was amazing the whole family ate up and no leftovers. They all said they’re best part of their day was the amazing dinner and especially the ribs :) Thank you so much. Best ribs I have ever made

Like other folks I used brown sugar instead of white.  Did some white rice and steamed broccoli. There was total silence at the dinner table, always a great indicator.

Added pineapple to cut the bite of the vinegar.  Big hit with the family.  Had lots of sauce.  Substituted brown sugar for the white sugar because I didnt have enough white sugar.

This was delicious! I followed instructions, boiled then browned edges in skillet with coconut oil. Then put in crockpot cuz I wasn’t sure what time my hubby would be home from work. Per other suggestions, I added a little fresh ginger and some onion, pepper, and celery. Served over rice with side of corn and peas. Will make again for sure!

I really enjoyed making and eating these ribs. Perfect for the sweet and sour taste that I have been craving for. I added 1/4 cup of ketchup and a green pepper cut into pieces toward the end. I would make it again for parties, for sure.

I have been making this dish for the past couple of years since my favorite Asian restaurant closed their doors. One of my favorite dishes they served was the sweet and sour ribs. This recipe is spot on and just as good as my long lost restaurant. I make it exactly as written. So easy and there are never any leftovers (darn!) The sauce also tastes good with the fried rice.

Added 1”x1” pieces of red onion, bell pepper & pineapple.  Served with Thai sticky rice.
  I will most definitely make this again.

Hi. I substitute beef short ribs for this recipe because I am severely allergic to pork. Added some honey. They turned out delicious. Thank you.

Great recipe. No need to use full amount of sugar. I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty. I might add some pineapple and peppers next time I make it.

Followed the recipe (except I used Splenda sugar substitute and reduced sodium soy sauce per dietary restrictions) and family said it was just OK. Kids said they liked the sauce just fine but prefer ribs to be more tender, either cooked low and slow in oven when I do BBQ ribs or in crock pot. Will make again, but use another cooking method for the ribs.

Excellent! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I needed to triple everything because I had 8lbs of ribs. Added some sweet onion after braising the ribs. I also slow cooked the ribs on low for 6-7 hours. They were fall off the bone. The ribs were excellent with fried rice and stir fried vegetables (we did a Chinese cooking night). Highly recommend!!

I seasoned my ribs with garlic powder/ salt lemon pepper fried them with onion till all sides were brown followed the exact measurements of ingredients but cooked them in the slow cooker with the sauce. They're not finished yet but do smell amazing can't wait to dig in after I take them out and broil/grill the in the oven!

Just made this for my family.  Very yummy, used rice vinegar instead of regular.  The sauce became VERY sticky.  Had to keep adding water during cooking.  Will make again but for a stir fry beef.  Served with fried rice and broccoli.

I made this recipe with a small change, I put the garlic in the last minute of browning since I like the smell of frying garlic so I though it would be better that way and it was.

I am thinking in summer using the same sauce for glazing in the bbq. Excellent recipe.

This is more like a 4.5 recipe. The flavor is delicious, and it's pretty simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out too thin. I will cut 1/2 to 1 cup of the water from the recipe next time I make this.

Great recipe but as one of the other comments, I didn't have dry mustard - substituted 1 tblsp. grated fresh ginger and it gave the recipe an extra zing. Also, I substituted brown sugar for the white - came out delicious. This recipe is a keeper...

Didn't change a thing.  Wonderful flavor, but I wish I would've baked them instead of cooking them on the stove.  They turned out a little tougher than I would've liked.  Other than that, loved the flavor!

Used all brown sugar and not sure if that made it too sweet, but found it a little too sweet.  Would like to add some cayenne next time as well to give it more of a kick.  But very good as is!

This was awesome. I made it with low sodium soy sauce and it turned out fantastic. Served it with Rice Noodles... I will make again. Thanks for the recipe

Delish! Served this over rice and enjoyed leftovers today for lunch. I inadvertently bought boneless pork ribs so I could have/should have cut back on cooking time. The meat was a bit overcooked but I'll know better next time.

I made this recipe for our country style ribs. I didn't have any soy sauce so instead I used BBQ sauce and it was absolutely excellent. The second time I made it I used the soy sauce. My husband and I preferred the BBQ sauce variation  over the soy sauce.

I've been looking for my Mom's sweet and sour spareribs recipe for years and this is it!  She use to make this for us and it was always one of my favorites but the recipe got lost over the years.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe...you made me feel like I was home again in my Mom's kitchen, absolutely wonderful!

Maybe it was something that I might have done wrong. But I didn't care for this. Neither did the kids or anyone else who tasted it. Good thing I made some ribs without.

This is very tasty.  I followed the recipe as instructed and it turned out very good.  Next time I would probably use pork tenderloin instead.  Very tender and the sauce came out perfect to pour over rice.

I've never had much luck with ribs before but these were delicious!  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that the smell of the meat boiling turned my pregnant stomach a little!

I'm not sure if "sweet and sour" is the right way to describe this sauce.  It was more like a thin teriyaki sauce.  We loved it, but I won't use it too often.  Soy Sauce isn't cheap and this recipe uses quite alot of it.

This dish is easy to make and has a great flavor. I have never really tried anything labeled "sweet 'n' sour", but I will definitely make this dish again.

Thanks for sharing this beauty HOWITZER.

This came out great, but I changed a couple of things. Instead of using 1/2 cup of soy sauce I used just 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce. I also subsituted mustard seed for dry mustard and seasoned salt for regular salt. I also added a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and a TINY bit of crushed red pepper. I would definately use this recipe again!

I used brown sugar instead of white and decreased the water by 1/2 cup to make a thicker sauce.  I got mant nice compliments.

I just made this and thought it was great!  My sauce was actually too thick, so I added water as it was cooking. I'll boil the ribs less next time because they were a little dry.  My husband said it was too sweet, so I'll put a little less sugar next time, also.  The sauce is delicious on rice!

I made these using boneless pork ribs.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the salt.  Next time, I won't boil the ribs first.  They were a little dry because I think they cooked too long.  I wasn't sure if I should cook them covered or not, so I did.  The sauce was very thin.  I took the cover off and reduced the sauce down.  I think I reduced it too far, because it became very sticky, like syrup.  Next time, I won't reduce as far!  Overall, these were very tasty.  The sauce was amazing!  My oldest son says this is a keeper!

Made this dish tonight using boneless pork ribs. It was tasty and even my 2 kids (11 and 3) loved it. My sauce didn't really thicken up for some reason. Maybe because I simmered for 20 mins. instead of 30-45? I added the juice from a can of pineapple chunks and used low sodium soy sauce. I followed the directions, but also put the ribs in a casserole dish, added the sauce, covered w/ alum. foil and slow baked in the oven for 1 hr at 350. Added the pineapple chunks with 15 mins. left to bake and they were god. I just added a little sauce on top of the ribs. I wanted to make sure the ribs we fully cooked. I'd defintely make it again though!

Fantastic.  I thought it was alot of soy sauce, but it gives a great flavour.  The garlic also adds a great flavour boost.  My whole family loves this and get excited when they know I'm making it.

The flavor was excellent with the addition of a can of pineapple. It did burn quite easily at the bottom of the pot even when it was turned down and stirred many times. I had to add more liquid because the sauce became quite thick.

With a Family of 8, it is sometimes difficult to please everyone.  It seems that this meal was a hit.  I cooked up 4.5lb's of Pork, so I increased all the measurements to suit, served with white rice.  I also fried up a large onion and celery prior to adding the pork.  Tasted fantastic. Everyone had a full serving, some had two.

Not exactly what I was looking for...but absolutely delicious. My husband (VERY picky eater) loves it. My father (skeptical of my cooking) doubles up. And best of all, my three boys always finish their plates when I make this dish. I left out the mustard due to personal preferences, and it turned out delectable! Five stars for sure!

We have just finished this meal and I must say-although not normally a sweet and sour fan-we really enjoyed it. I used ribs on the bone so it was a bit fiddly stripping them. I also added pineapple and because of my thing with sesame I sprinkled a dessertspoon on 5 mins from the end.(converted) Thanks.

This was so good! Added crushed pineapple last 15 minutes as suggested and served over brown rice and stir fry veggies...yum! 
Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these on a whim one night after searching for a sparerib recipe.  I had everything on hand.  They were easy to make and very tasty. I used 4 pounds of spareribs and found that there was plenty of sauce even though the recipe calls for 2 pounds.  Once change I will make next time I prepare this dish is to cut down on the amount of sugar.  The sauce was just a little too sweet for our taste.

This is the BEST recipe I've ever gotten off this website.  My whole family loves when I make this recipe for dinner and the sauce alone is to die for.  Really great - I add canned pineapple chunks and bell pepper slices for an extra kick sometimes.

I made this last night and I didn't have enough vinegar so I thought it was a little to sweet, but my husband loved it!  Better than what you get at a chinese resturant!  I served it over rice.

This was AWESOME. I didn't have any dry mustard so I used a little less than 1/2 teaspoon of ginger in it's place. The whole family LOVED it.

This isn't the traditional sweet and sour sauce, but it's fabulous!  I used pork tenderloin instead of ribs, low-salt soy sauce, and added fresh red and yellow peppers a few minutes before I served it over white rice.  Next time, I'll add more vegetables!  Absolutely delicious!

This was a delicious change from barbeque ribs.  I am actually here getting the recipe for the sauce today to use for chicken and stir fry veggies.  I know it will turn out great, just like the ribs did.  Thank you Lechner family.

The sauce deserves all 5 stars, very good!  Instead of ribs I used some leftover pork loin roast, which I sliced and browned.  This will be my sweet and sour sauce from now on because it's easy to make and doesn't require pineapple which my family doesn't care for. I can't wait to try it with ribs and chicken.

I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce is wonderful.  I followed the recipe closely, but substituted bite-sized pieces of pork chops for the pork ribs.  Pork turned out fine.  In the future, I will use chicken strips instead of pork.  But, the sauce is fantastic.  I served this over white rice and with stir fried vegetables.

This recipe (since last night when i made it) has now been labled "the best ribs ever" by my family. They were tender and moist - and the sauce was amazing. It has been suggested by my family that I cook it often.

This is the most delicious sweet'n'sour pork I have tasted being that it is home made. This reminded me of those free testers at the malls food court. I have been trying to figure out how to make those and now I know. Defenately wonderful and authentically made!

Boneless pork spareribs worked well in this sweet and sour combination.  Was this ever delicious over rice!
Thank you for another great recipe.

This recipe was wonderful!  I'm a beginner cook and this was well liked by everyone.  Sweet and sour is the only way to describe it.  I think this sauce would be wonderful with shrimp too.
