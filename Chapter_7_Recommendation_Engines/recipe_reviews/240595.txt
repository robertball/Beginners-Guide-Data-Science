This was a HUGE hit at our Family Christmas. However I made a few adjustments. 1) I boiled the squash after I had cubed it. 2) I then drained the water and added the butter, brown sugar, and used pumpkin spices as the previous review suggested. 3) Then I smashed the squash. 4) Once mixed, I placed the mixture in a crock pot to keep warm at our gathering. 

A perfect, care free, side dish for any gathering.

Was pretty disappointed in this recipe, which makes me feel bad to post, but everybody had such good reviews but then said in their comments to bake longer....if the recipe does not give an accurate cook time, why would you give it a good rating???? I went by the recipe (because I have no experience with butternut squash and would expect a recipe like this to be for newbies and experienced cooks alike) and did an hour in the oven. My husband and I had to wrestle it out of the shell and then it wouldn’t mush the way it’s supposed to when we used beaters on a high setting. BECAUSE IT NEEDED MORE TIME IN THE OVEN! The recipe needs to be modified before it has such high ratings, there’s no way anybody ever had success after only one hour of it in the oven. We still ate it, as chunky as it was, but I should also mention we don’t have apple pie seasoning (not a common house hold spice but whatever) so I just did a dash of ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. It tasted pretty good, but really I can only give the author of the recipe credit for the amount of butter and brown sugar we used.

I love squash like this, and could sit and eat the entire thing! I did use pumpkin pie spice in place of the apple pie spice. It's only 1/8 tsp, so the taste is very subtle, which I liked.

This was fantastic.  I too used pumpkin spice.  The squash was rather large and took an hour and forty minutes to cook.  After stirring in butter, brown  sugar and spice with a fork,, I found no need to whip.  Delicious.

We love fresh squash, most every variety and am always on the lookout for new recipes.  This is a great basic recipe and I only tweaked it a little.  Depending on how much squash you use, you adjust the following ingredients accordingly.  First I used a mixture of equal amounts of both Butternut and Acorn squash, which I halved, removed the seeds, then roasted in the oven at 400 degrees until fork comes out smoothly.  Next I peeled away the skin and lightly mashed, it will still be a bit lumpy.  Then I added equal parts Maple Syrup and Honey, each added according to level of sweetness desired.  Now you mix it all up, either by hand or in a food processor.  Place squash in a casserole dish and sprinkle mini marshmallows on top.  Return squash to a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes, you could either broil a bit or flambé the marshmallows, let cool a bit then enjoy!  My daughter calls this dessert, because of the sweetness!

No.  I filled the recipe exactly.  It was a vegetable foe a dinner party that I held.  It went over very well!  Sorry, I was too busy to take any pictures.

Huge fan of Butternut Squash!  Absolutely yummy recipe, and easy to make.  I make my own "pumpkin spice blend" and double the amount of spice for personal preference.  I do set my oven higher - 400 and I think that is why so many others had to cook their squash longer because I have never roasted squash at 350.

As a diabetic, with alterations, this was a great dish, especially if you want something like sweet potatoes without the starch. The roasting took much longer than the 1 hour, so I increased the  temp to 400. I used agave nectar instead of brown sugar, and substituted cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cardamom (for Christmas)  for spices. It was delicious. May eliminate the cardamom next time.

Soooooooo good. I’m making it again tomorrow. Never knew butternut squash was so delicious.  I think I’ll just eat it after I roast it. The tablespoon of butter and tablespoon of brown sugar,  flavor the squash while baking and it tastes great . It might not make it to the mashed stage.

Loved this! Had to bake the squash longer but not a problem. And used pumpkin pie spice because that is what I had. It made a huge batch for two so will freeze remainder.

This recipe was awesome.  The only thing I did different was put the pumpkin pie spice on top of the halves and baked them .  It took longer than an hour but worth the wait . Yuuummmy

I made it in the same manner I prepare sweet potato casserole....it was very tasty . I had to bake the squash a bit longer however, as it was not thoroughly baked in 1 hour
