Everyone loved these and they look very fancy. I added about 2 tsp of garlic paste and very fine rosemary to the mayo spread. I also added a tiny bit of red wine vinegar to the onions at the very end as the wine I used wasn't particularly flavorful. The horseradish flavor really came to life about 30 minutes after preparing it all.

Wow, these are amazing and super easy! I used creamed mild horseradish and placed a spinach leaf on about half of them (top of horseradish) for some added colour. Awesome - will be my go to appy, especially over the holidays :)

Great meal my only changes were a thin layer of garlic butter on the bread before it was toasted and put some shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Wife loved it and will do it again for guests !!

Loved these! They maybe could have used an herb in the sauce but I still have no complaints. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!
