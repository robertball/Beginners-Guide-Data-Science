These are easy and tasty.  I took them to a holiday party and they were gone before they hit the table!  chilled them in the fridge and they rolled up quite easily.  I will make these again.

These are so yum. Super sweet, like I had to chug a glass of milk after eating just one, but SO wonderful. My husband claimed most of the rest for himself. I think I'm in trouble. TIP: I chilled the
balls for just a bit before dipping. I used toothpicks for dipping ease.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well these turned out - in the hand they are firm, and not at all sticky, but they have a nice chewy texture. I was a little worried that they would be too hard to bite but that was not the case!  Mine never did reach the point where the mixture balled up around the spoon, but I took them off when it was sort of pulling up from the bottom of the pot and VERY hard to stir. Worked great!

These were wonderful. Remind me of a snickers bar. Very easy to make and they disappear quickly.

These were easy, but not so 'impressive' for visual appeal. I'm generally very good at making desserts and dainties look impressive but these were hard to make look overly pretty. Also, due to the peanuts, the caramel flavour was overpowered and quite a few people thought it included peanut butter. That being said, I really liked the taste and texture - very chewy and rich tasting. I used milk chocolate chips instead of candy coating (since I don't like the candy coating taste) and this worked well.

Found this recipe to use up the ingredients. I was little worried that my husband wouldn't eat these (he absolutely hates peanut butter, but loves macaroons) so I added a little bit of leftover coconut and it worked out marvelously! He couldn't stop eating them. I used a cookie dough scoop to make them evenly sized. Great recipe!
