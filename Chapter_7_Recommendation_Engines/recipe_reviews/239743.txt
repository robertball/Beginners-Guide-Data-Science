Oh, these were AWESOME!!!!! I made the dough up in the bread machine (did not need any extra flour). I filled 1/2 with the jalapeno mixture and the other 1/2 with pepperoni and cheese (for the girls). Both were a HUGE hit! These are a bit time consuming, but very easy and the results make these absolutely worth it. I actually mixed the dough and made them up the day before. Put them on a floured cookie sheet (very important so they don't stick to the pan), covered and put them in the fridge. Took them out to get to room temp the next day, then proceeded w/ the boiling and baking. This worked great! I brushed them w/ egg before baking, but did not top them w/ the salt until after I took them out of the oven and brushed each with melted butter, just to take them over the top, lol...PERFECT! I have bought the frozen filled pretzels in the past, but I will not be doing that again as these are WAYYYYYY better~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks so much for sharing. :)

I tried making these but without the jalapenos and they were good but way too salty. i would cut down on the baking soda drastically if possible and try not to put much salt on top. the filling was good and they were okay when they were hot and fresh.

Yes, wonderful.  My dough did perfect but I used pickling salt if that is the same as Kosher salt.  I need to buy some Kosher salt.  I like that the filling can vary.  I wish I had thought of the pepperoni and cheese because my husband won't eat peppers.  He is missing out this time but next time I will make some with pepperoni and no peppers.  I think I will use onion in my next time.  One problem--mine stuck to the parchment and I had to tear off.  I need to buy some silicon mats when I go for the kosher salt.

I wish I could rate this 4 1/2 stars.  The recipe was good but was a little salty and, at least in my oven, the cook time was a little long even at the lowest recommended time.

Yummy and Simple.  Decided not to put salt on top and instead of eggwash I did butter they turned out great.

These are really easy to make, although a little putsy with all the steps...But TOTALLY WORTH IT for the rave reviews you will get lol!  I will have to start making a double batch as the last time I brought them they were gone within five minutes and people were even stashing them to make sure they had a chance to have one!  I have made them 4 times, they are good without the filling too, and I also made them with a sausage, red pepper  cream cheese filling which was super good.  Awesome recipe, that you for sharing and making me look like I may be a good cook HA!

I followed the directions exactly as is but listened to the people that said to skip the salt on the top and they turned out great!!!
