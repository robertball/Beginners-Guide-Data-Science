This turned out great. Went very well with pork tenderloins off the smoker. This recipe will make it to my keep list.

This is darn good. It's got an ingredients list as long as my arm, but it's  definitely worth the time and preparation. I used it on some ground turkey meatballs. It is tangy, spicy and with a perfect touch of  sweet from the fruit. The kids enjoyed it too. Thank you for the recipe.

This is an outstanding BBQ sauce. I added more h√†banero peppers and mixed them in with the immersion blender to suit my personal preference. I also had to use jam because I couldn't find blackberry jelly. It appeared to look like an unusual combination of ingredients but something wonderful happened when they were heated and mixed together. Sweet fruity flavour followed by heat.

I did sub blueberries for the fresh blackberries, but otherwise followed the recipe.   We really enjoyed this bbq especially on the grill with chicken.  It's got great flavor and good heat.
