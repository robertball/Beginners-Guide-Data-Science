I too, adapted this recipe to my taste.  I used whatever vegetables I had left over or in the house.  I even threw in some frozen peas and corn.  I used 3 gloves a garlic and a large onion.  I used more spices than the recipe called for.  More salt, pepper, basil.  I used colby, jack and cheedar cheeses because that is what I had on hand.  My family loved it!  No one noticed it was a meatless meal.

I added this recipe to my box a while back because I thought it sounded good..  Just today  my mom made lunch and it was something very very similar to this, She said she just made it up but since it's so similar I wanted to rate this recipe and say that is came out really really yummy and you should try it!

This is a horribly bland tasteless recipe.  I ended up throwing the entire thing out. I don't know what could be changed to give it some taste except perhaps, a whole other recipe. Terrible. Would not recommend.

I made this recipe with 3 cups soymilk, fresh mushrooms, alot more seasoning and omitted the basil. I also used spinach instead of Broccoli and used carrots in place bell pepper. I sauted all the vegetables, then made sauce and added it to fusilli pasta. For the topping I mixed a quarter cup parmesan in with cracker crumbs. It was delicious A great comfort food!

I disregarded the first review and tried this.  It was great.  Like other I made several modifications.  Added more garlic and other spices that we like.  Also, i used the veggies i had on hand (fresh zuchini, carrots and sweet pepers).  I'm not a big fan of boiling my veggies so i sauteed them while i was cooking the pasta.  A quick mix of everything together and it was a lovely, quick and tasty dish.  Very colorful as well!

Don't be put off by the unkind and inaccurate review above. It's not haute cuisine, but a wholesome family dish, and easily adaptable to your preferences, or to what you have available. I usually use Cheddar cheese, and put the dish under a hot overhead grill for a few minutes instead of into the oven

I used this recipe as a base. I used egg noodles instead of penne pasta. I cooked for four people, so I did just half of a pack of noodles and all ingredients. So my ingredients were: 1 cup of broccoli, half of yellow bell pepper, 1 cup of yellow squash, half an onion, 1/2 cup of celery, 5 gloves of garlic, butter, oil, 1/8 cup of flour, 2 cups of milk, parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, spices, fresh chopped basil, bread crumbs, canoly cooking spray. I cooked noodles according to directions, set aside. Sauteed all veggies on olive oil mixed with butter, add flour and milk, salt, pepper, spices and parmesan cheese. mixed veggies with noodles, add basil. put everything in casserole dish, sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and put in preheated oven for 30 minutes. It was so good! My kids, 6 and 8, loved it! Very good recipe, just needs to be changed acording to your taste :)

I cooked it as per the directions except for adding the suggested extra spices and cheese, and it was still bland.  Also, the pasta had no texture left in it.  I guess I'll go back to the old recipe with creame of mushroom soup.

Sort of bland, but made it better by adding 3x the broccoli called for and by adding some canned turkey.

This was a nice casserole. I wanted to make this a one dish meal so I cooked up some ground turkey breast and added it in.  Next time I'll make sure to increase the milk to compensate for the extra stuff and add more seasonings... I did add lots of rainbow pepper and some pink sea salt

This is a good recipe, but very bland. My kids loved it, but I had to add some hot sauce. I might try it with a more flavorful cheese.

Not very flavorful. Recipe also called for too much milk. Reduce by at least one cup.

This was a good recipe. My husband and I often eat meatless meals and this one was well liked by both of us. I am going to make it again in the future but I will be adding more and different spices. I think it has a lot of potential, but it needs some minor adjustments.

I would agree with most of the others...BLAND! and dry. I will try it again, but with several modification to make it more creamy, and with bit more flavor.

This was so, so bland!! My husband and I tried added more salt/pepper, little more basil, etc.,  but nothing really helped. We did agree that this was a good 'base' to be added too but is not very good as is.

Needs some flavor.  I suggest adding more cheese to the sauce.

I have to admit I was worried until I took a bite. First of all, the reviews scared me a bit. Then I tought there was not enough vegetables (I added a bit more). I suggest adding red bell pepper instead of green, to give some color. I didn't boil the vegetables, but fried them in a little olive oil not retain the nutrients. And believe me, I had a pleasant surprise!

More garlic makes it nice, plus some additional spices in the sauce, but it's a good base - great to work from and create your own variations. Certainly pleased my boyfriend on his birthday!

Very filling, pretty looking recipe :) I would use a little basil powder in the sauce as well, to add some more flavour.

The recipe as it stands is pretty bland, but easy to fix. Note there is no salt inlcuded in the recipe. You are going to want to add salt and pepper to the sauce and taste as you go until it is properly seasoned. Using nonfat milk also makes it bland, so adjust to whole milk or even cream if you aren't trying for a low calorie version. I increased the garlic because 1 clove is never enough. I like a stronger garlic flavor in all of my cream sauces. To add more flavor you can also add different cheese. I've done this with smoked Guoda alongside the parmesan.

This is a great recipe. I don't understand the bad reviews. I steamed my broccoli and cooked all my veggies( I used Italian squash, onion, red bell pepper) in the skillet first. Added Garlic salt. Used Whole wheat Penne pasta. Delicious. Everyone loved it!!

A 13x9 pan is almost too small to fit everything in.  Also, the milk burned on the bottom of the pan when cooking.
