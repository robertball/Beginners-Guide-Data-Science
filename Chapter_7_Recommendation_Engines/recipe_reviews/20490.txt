Very good recipe! I added more bananas, 4...also added vanilla and a small amount of white sugar and a dash of cinnamon. When they were out of the oil, I sprinkled with powder sugar...YUM! My whole family loved them...

This recipe is workable once you figure it out.

First it cooks best in a deep fat frier that has a temperature control.  I cooked them on 300.  If you don't have that a low pan of oil on the burner would probably do.

While you are cooking them though I found that you had to poke them in the middle after they were half done to get them to cook the middles so they weren't goopy.

And they don't have much of a banana taste.  If you like them more banana I would add a banana or two.

These didn't turn out like I thought and my kids wouldn't eat them till the next day after I reheated them and said they were banana pancakes. Now they love 'em. The taste was ok but the recipe should have just said banana pancakes.

I should have read the reviews before I tried this. It was too salty and too runny. Something must be missing from this recipe. I, too, threw mine out.

I tried this, the only thing I did different was I cooked them like a pancake instead of frying them. My son liked them, and even took the left overs out for his friends.

This is the first fritter recipe we've ever made and we liked it. I agree with the caution of making them too large or the inside will be under-cooked. It helped to have two people frying/turning because they browned quickly. After the oil temp was right, we had to turn it down because they burned quickly. Our bananas were old and yet we thought they needed to be more sweet, so we dipped them in syrup! Wonder if another banana would've helped?

Great way to get rid of bananas outside of banana bread.  I made subtle changes; I used 4 bananas instead of 2 and for the 2 cups of flour I did 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup wheat flour.  They came out a bit greasy, but I wonder if I made them smaller; they'd cook faster and I wouldn't have to leave them in as long.  Something yummy to accompany them instead of powered sugar...try sugar free raspberry jam.  It was so good and cuts the sugar even more and adds a bit more fruit to it.

I just made these at work for my co-workers simply because I had some ripe bananas to use up.   Everyone absolutely loved them.  I wanted to give this recipe five stars but I did a little modifying before frying. After tasting the batter, I felt that it needed a little sweetness and spice to it.  I added about an 1/8 cup white sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a few shaked allspice. They were delicious.  I am not sure how they got so picture perfect in the photo though. Mine looked like little octopuses.

We loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was in the frying step.  I poured the batter through a funnel and fried it just like the funnel cakes that you purchase at the fair.  Very good and easy to make.

These fritters are delicious. I added to the mixture a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/2 cup of granulated sugar. Try them in the morning; my son spread peanut butter on one and when I went back for another they were gone! Love them!!!

Deep fried banana bread drops are how I'd describe these.  Tasted fine, but I think for the end result to taste pretty much like banana bread, I'll just skip the deep frying and make a banana bread loaf.  I did roll them in sugar after frying and lightly dusted with powdered sugar for effect.  Would suggest to only fry about 1 TBSP drops at the most at a time so that they cook throughout. And the suggestion to just let them turn themselves is a good one!  Not my favorite recipe, but always fun to try something new.

These were really good! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I added about 1 tsp of vanilla and 3 tbsps of sugar, so I'm not sure how the unchanged version is. The important thing is to allow the dough to turn on its own in the fryer. If you just watch them as they are cooking, you'll see that they turn on their own, and when they are a nice golden brown, just take them out. I had no problems with doughiness or being undercooked with this method, nor did they burn. I didn't have any powdered suger, so I omitted it, but they were good on their own, and sweet enough. My hubby and 2-year old loved them!

I thought it was so delicious, but if you don't keep them in long enough its still really doughy in the middle, and if you leave them in too long they burn on the outside. But they were really delicious, i loved the puffiness of them they were a perfect snack for my 1 year old.!

I add one cup cake flour sifted and one beaten egg. 3 tablespoons sugar. 1/2 cup sparkling soda. And a little more to get thin not so thick batter. Dash of salt. Baking powder as mentioned.  Not any milk. 2 tablespoon melted butter. Cut each banana into thirds. Roll in cornstarch then batter and fry. Coat after with sifted powder sugar. Delicious. Heat up oil while mixing everything

I had 7 bananas getting old in my fruit bowl so I decided to try these since my oven is broken, and banana bread was out.
These came out beautifully! I tripled the recipe (plus the one extra banana). I don’t have a thermometer so I just dropped them in with a serving spoon when the oil was sizzling. I had to get my timing right because some were still a little doughey inside but I eventually figured it out. The sugar didn’t really stick to the outside but my family enjoyed them even without sugar.
It made a lot but I know they won’t last long! Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! However I omitted the milk since I thought the dough would be too runny. My husband & I loved eating it on a rainy, dreary day!

I was looking for something quick and easy for a sweet snack. This really filled the bill. I added a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. These were great.

Made no changes. 
We will definitely make these again, as it was a huge hit with the family. They reminded me of long ago days in West Africa, where banana fritters were a favorite treat.
The boys said we should always over-buy bananas in the future (over-ripe bananas were the impetuous for making these this time).

I have fond memories of my grandmother's banana fritters for dessert after dinner and these are pretty close. I wondered how they'd come out in my Fry Baby (175° frying temp) but they came out pretty well. My only problem is the recipe makes a whole lot if you're only frying for one person as I do.

I love this recipe. I added a little vanilla and cinnamon and when they were done, i topped them with maple syrup instead of confectioners powder. Perfect breakfast or snack.

These are so fun to make .  The recipe is perfect.  I used coconut oil to fry them in.  Use a two spoon method and be careful not to make them to big.  I love that there is no sugar in the batter .  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't typicly like banana recipes but this one was  ok although I didn't put the sugar on top because I made a honey glaze which is mostly sugar.

Family loved them so much had me make a second batch. first batch looked over cooked and was not done in middle  so made them smaller and turned heat down. First batch used a tablespoon to spoon the batter into the oil, second batch used a teaspoon.

I mashed the banana with the flour mixture and added 1/2 tsp banana flavoring to the egg blend.  Very tender little fritters!  The recipe halves well.  I may try it with a banana flavored glaze next time!

It was doughy on the inside. And with more heat it would burn on the outside and be undercooked on the inside.

Added pinch of cinnamon and vanilla.   Deep fried mine. Like a little banana Ana bread donut. Good recipe.

So delicious. I used butter instead of margarine, coconut butter instead of vegetable oil and used almond milk and cream instead of cows milk. All of these were just because that is what I had on hand not because I thought it would be better. It was super amazing!

Great recipe. Easy to make and so quick too! The family loved it. I have a suggestion: try drizzling some honey on the fritters...it's pretty darn good and keeps the kids licking their fingers!

my kids are picky. but they turned out great if you make em really small otherwise they will be uncooked in the middle. my mom loved them. I used self rising flour, and coca nut oil instead of butter, and greek yogurt instead of milk. very very good.

These turned out very tasty with good texture and a nice flavor.  They just weren't what I was looking for.  The end result was more like deep fried banana pancakes or banana funnel cake but not like the fritters I was expecting.  Thanks for the good recipe but I'll keep searching.  I may use it for pancakes next time!

Just great.  i love the simple recipe.  I used 3 bananas instead of the suggested 2 and i added a 1/3 cup of sugar. They were just beautiful.  My oil's heat was perfect for a soft center and a brown finish. Highly suggested.
