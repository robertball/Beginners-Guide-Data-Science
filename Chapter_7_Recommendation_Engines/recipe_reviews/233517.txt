this is the one!! made it last night and it was perfect. the can of sweetened condensed milk was 300 ml, so we doubled the batch by adding a full teaspoon of garlic powder and then gradually whisking in 1/2 cup of vinegar. Big thanks Mathieu for sharing this recipe!

This is the recipe I have used for years...the last time we went to PEI we had "real" donair sauce and realized the stuff I make at home is better--because there is no sugar needed by using sweetened condensed milk,it's not gritty like the other kind.  This goes great with garlic fingers (pixza dough, brushed with garlic butter, add shredded mozerella, bake and slather with garlic butter again...omg i need garlic fingers and donair sauce soon!

Not ever having anything like this to compare the sauce with, we loved it.  I made 'Donair' from AR and used this sauce to top the meat/veggie/pita combination.  The sauce was made in the morning, and it was a nice thickness in the evening at dinner.  Liking the taste of the sauce, I'm going to use the leftovers as a coleslaw dressing.  Thanks, MATHIEUDAIGLE for sharing your recipe.

Used an entire can of milk and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  Very good.  I think i will try fresh garlic rather than garlic powder to see if it adds a bit better zing.

This is a perfect recipe! I use a very heaping 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder just because I love garlic.

So easy to make and So YUMMY!
I have wanted to make donair sauce for a long time and I am not sure why I haven't before now.  I always bought premade.  Well this was an awesome first time recipe to choose.  It is the best, by far, donair sauce I have ever tasted :)

Around home (PEI!) most home cooks would normally substitute the sweetened condensed milk for cool whip! It's the same ratio and  the only difference is it is fluffier, but cheaper! (sweetened condensed milk is sooooo expensive here!)  this is a very good recipe though that I have had at some friends houses/many restaurants! :D
