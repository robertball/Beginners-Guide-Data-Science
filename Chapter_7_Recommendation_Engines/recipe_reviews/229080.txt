okay. haven't had a chance to actually taste it yet but i just finished glazing the bread. a few little annoyances i had with the recipe were: i could not get the butter and brown sugar to actually turn into a glaze as written so I added another tsp of butter; still no glaze action. then I added a small amount of water the pow! we have glaze. I stirred vigorously for about a minute until it started to caramelize, then poured it over the bread and added the pecan to the top. thought it would make it more visually attractive and it did.

I made muffins instead of bread and it was amazing they lasted two days. I also added just a dash of ginger, put walnuts and brown sugar(not melted) on top instead of the inside.

This is a beautiful recipe! I didn't have Canola oil so I used vegetable oil and it came out great! My family life it so much they have me making a double batch today. I didn't use the glaze in the recipe it's not our thing so the nuts was added in the batter and I made one other change I added half a banana to the recipe it worked out great! This is a keeper!

OK so I made this but made muffins rather than a loaf.
I made a few changes, I only used 1 cup of white sugar (we don't like things too sweet in our house)and it was plenty sweet enough but think I'll use half a cup of white and half a cup of brown sugar next time.
I also didn't add any pecans or make the topping.

I reduced the cooking time slightly, the muffins took about 20 mins at 375.

I made 24 muffins but they were pretty small so next time I think I'll probably do 16 - 18 larger muffins.

Everyone in my family loved them (especially the kids - even the picky one).

I only gave it 4 stars as I found cooking the potato a little time consuming - I will peel and boil next time as this only takes about 20mins as opposed to 1 hour in the oven and then having to wait for it to cool enough to peel.

I WILL be making this again.
My kids loved this!!!!

I have tried this recipe and it turned out very good.  I made it into muffins (about 12-14 per recipe)that I baked 20 mins.  Also since I can't eat the nuts, I substituted 1/3 cup of pumpkin seeds whole.  The only issue I had was that there is 1/3 cup of water listed in recipe and not in instructions.  So I omitted the water and found it worked fine. Oh, also I cut the sugar to 1 cup which also worked. I did not make the topping as I was looking for a simple "make it and bake it" recipe, but I'm sure it would be delicious. To add a final touch I sprinkled some pumpkin seeds on top once the batter was loaded into liners.  I made two batches and I think 25 mins is a better cooking time as the first batch was a bit "pale."  The cinnamon and nutmeg blended well with sweet potato and pumpkin seeds for an early fall treat!  Give this one a try---but I would pull back the sugar because even at 1 cup I thought they were plenty sweet.

This recipe came out wonderful. Imperfect foods brought me 6 sweet potatoes instead of one, so I had to figure out what to do with them, so I made this.  I substituted hazelnuts instead of pecans (I didn't have any on hand) and it tasted great. The bread came out a bit dense, almost like a brownie.

This bread is very good and easy to make. My 8 year old made it. We did use half brown sugar and half white sugar and left off the glaze. It's still delicious.

Turned out very tasty, used only one cup sugar and didn’t bother with the glaze, other than followed exactly.

Delicious! I had some cranberries on hand so I threw them in the batter and folded them in the batter.  Completely forgot to make the glaze, but it was yummy still.  Makes a great breakfast bread.

This was really good. I didn't do the glaze and pecan topping. I bet that would be great though.
