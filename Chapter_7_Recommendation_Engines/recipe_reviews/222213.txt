Great alternative to all the macaroni/mayo salads!  I made it as written with the exception of a little less sugar, and got many compliments at a party this summer.  My kids liked it, too.  Will make this regularly - thank you for sharing this recipe!

I recently made this when we had friends over and everyone loved it! I am making it again for a camping trip this weekend! Thanks for a different macaroni salad!

Different taste and simple, but a bit too sweet for me.  The dressing tastes like Catalina salad dressing.

I followed the recipe exactly with just one added ingredient; celery salt.  It was delicious.  
Thank you for a wonderful summer salad.
