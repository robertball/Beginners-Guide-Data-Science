I made this punch for a Hawaiian Luau party and it was an absolute hit!  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I made it the night before (minus the soda) in gallon jugs to save on pre-party hassles and I think it made it even better since the strawberries had time to soak up all the flavors.  This is a definite keeper!

This was a great punch for my beach party.  The recipe called for two 2 liter bottles of soda.  Only one would fit into my punch bowl with all of the other ingredients.  Although I was concerned that it would be to strong,it wasn't at all.The next time I would plan on just one 2 liter bottle per recipe.  I mixed everything but the rum, water, and soda the night before.  The punch came together quickly at the party and I had to refill the bowl often!

I made this punch for a shower, and was BOMBARDED with requests for the recipe.  Everybody loved it!!  It was fruity, without being overwhelming.  I did cut the sugar in half, and it was still very good.  I would definately reccomend this recipe.

This is a wonderful punch. I can't stop making it for just get togethers because everyone loves it. I add extra rum, I also took out the sugar and put all the juices, strawberries and tea together the night before.(If I don't, it seems like the strawberries will never thaw). I will make this over and over.

I made this for my bf's 30th birthday party and people went nuts for it. I threw in triple sec, and pommegranate vodka just because I had it. I used no sugar and only one bottle of soda. I added the water to taste. I think the basic recipe would be fine with no sugar as well. Very good and fun!

What a great tasting punch. Just added more Rum for a kick, and used only one bottle of soda. The girls at my party loved it and so did my Husband!

This was great! Everyone at our party loved it. I forgot the frozen strawberries on accident, and my punch bowl would only hold one of the 2-liters of 7UP, but it was still great! I also added more rum.....

I did not use the black tea. Everything was great, but I added fresh peaches, pineapple and raspberries to the recipe. Marinate the fruit overnight. I used Bacardi Peach Rum too.  Delicious!!

I made this ahead and froze it. Then the day of the pool party I let it soften up a bit, then chopped it up and served as a frozed drink. It was a huge hit with all! I don't like my drinks strong but like many of the other reviewers, I found the original recipe was not strong enough so I used only 1 2L of soda and added more rum.

Wonderful! I made it just as directed, however, I could have eliminated the sugar and it would have been just as good.

A great party hit!  Everyone kept asking me what in the world was in it!  Prep before really is helpful for brewing the tea and letting the strawberries thaw a bit.  I would recommend to otheres.

This was a wonderful party drink. We skipped the sugar and added just a bit more Caption Morgan. But other than that we stuck to the recipe. I had planned on trying this as a new drink for all the ladies at the party, but even the guys were drinking it, instead of there beer. There’s no alcohol after task so be careful and enjoy… I give it a 10

I used Banana Malibu Rum to add a little more of a tropical taste....I bought whole frozen strawberries and blended them with the water, sugar, and some of the ice cubes.  It was very easy to make and very good too!

I recently served this at a party and it was a big hit.  Everyone loved it, even my sister-in-law that doesn't like punch because it's generally too sweet.

I've made this from everything from New Years Eve to Baby Showers and every time people ask for the recipe! This year I think I'll put a QR code with the URL for this site on the punch sign so people can save the recipe! Dont worry if you cant fit the last bottle of soda in your punch bowl, you'll be fine without it!

Very good.  For non-alcoholic, I substitute Sparkling Apple cider for the rum and reduce water to 5 cups.  People always drink it and request recipe.

Awesome punch!!! My bowl only fit 1 bottle of 7UP and 5 cups of water, and also I didn't add any sugar.. It turned out great! I had to refill it twice!! At a baby shower!! Maybe next time I'll add more tea. Flavours were great!!

I liked this drink and it was pretty fun but I love citrus drinks.  Only one other person drank it as well out of a party of fourteen.  I would have loved this when I was tweenty one when everyone was just trying to get wasted but couldn't handle the taste of alchol.  Just would have had to triple the liqour.  Try this fun drink.
