Wow, what a refreshing springtime treat this recipe was. I don't have store bought BBQ sauce on hand, always make my own. I found a recipe on this site that pairs very well with this one, Korean BBQ Sauce by holmes416. Toss in some sesame seeds for extra flavor. The fruit/veggie combo was fantastic, no peaches at the market, so I used an orange bell along with the red bell, mango and pineapple. There was nothing but sweet Mmmm's as we all savored this nice meal, served with rice. Thanks Tara, we'll be grilling this one all summer long.
