I don't usually keep Bisquick around, so I used a basic homemade buttermilk pancake recipe. This is nice occasionally for special occasions, I wouldn't serve it all the time because of the sugar quantity. Both my boys were
overjoyed to see this for breakfast and my oldest called me "The Best and Most Beautiful Mommy in the World", which was worth the time making it. Cute idea, but keep in mind, it's VERY sweet. I think if I would have used a baking mix, it would have been too sweet.
