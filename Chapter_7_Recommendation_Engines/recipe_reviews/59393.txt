We loved the flavor of this. The texture was not so great. I think if I do this again, I would grill less ripe mangos rather than ripened ones - the ripe ones wanted to fall apart - or just use the mango raw. I added a little cilantro, too. Served with a (bottled) mango-chipotle marinated pork loin. Thanks for the recipe!

Great, simple recipe! Didn't have any red onion at the time, but sweet onion filled in fine.

For those of you who like quick and easy, you might try Italian Rose, Mango Salsa as a sub for some of the items in this recipe.  I bought mine at Sam's
