I admit that I really changed the recipe to suit our needs and the cooking items we had on hand. Instead of using beer as a marinade, I used a peach/raspberry wine cooler, 1 tsp. oregano, 2 tsp. of parsley. I then, in a set aside conatiner, cut up onions, green peppers, and celery, marninating those in a mix of olive oil, minced garlic, and oregano. I stir fried the chicken and veggies and then mixed it with whole wheat spaghetti, 1 cup of grated mozzarella/parm cheese, and added parsley to taste. Not exactly the same recipe as listed but still very good.

Surprisingly good!  I didn't have mushrooms, so I sauteed some onion and garlic before adding the chicken, and also added salt, pepper, and a blend of Italian seasonings.  Done this way, the beer really makes a surprisingly dark, flavorful sauce (and I used Coors!).

DH didn't like all the mushrooms. BUt thought it was an interesting taste. This recipe will DEFINITELY come out very differently based on the type of beer you use. We used Shiner Bock and din't have any bitter aftertaste. Probably won't make often, but was definitely good for a change of pace.

I think the key to this recipe is you have to use good, flavorful beer that isn't too bitter. I used a brown ale from a local microbrewery. 
This recipe leaves a good amount of room for embellishment. I added 2 green onions and a clove of garlic to the mushrooms, and seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper prior to cooking. At the end, the sauce could use a bit of flour or cornstarch for thickening, but otherwise the flavor was surprisingly good.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe.  I used a jar of  mushrooms because I don't like fresh ones and it was great.  It made my kitchen stink like a keg party for a while, but was definetely worth it.  I'll make this again and again.

This was a quick easy recipe, I served it with buttered noodles, a veggie and a salad.  Everyone loved it!  The beer gave the chicken a unique flavor and the meal was a good match for our favorite beverage!

I made a few changes for this recipe, and did my best to not add a bunch of calories and fat! 
I used 2 tsp. of chopped garlic and 1 medium chopped onion.  I also put a sprinkle of smokey paprika and some pepper on the onions, mushrooms and galic as I sauted them. I also had to use canned shrooms and used the juice form those as well to simmer the breasts in.  This was WONDERFUL!  The chicken was moist and fork tender.  This is going to become a regular in this house! Thanks for sharing.  :) Happy Cooking.

Very tasty!  Chicken stays juicy in the sauce.  I added more mushrooms, but it does't really need it.

Well, my husband and I did like the recipe, but it was a bit bland.  I hate the taste of beer, but I thought it would be good since I've had beer battered fish, and sausage marinated in beer, but for this recipe, the beer taste was a bit too strong for me.  I will try adding other flavors to counteract it the next time I make it.  It was a bland flavor and salt and cheese was about the only thing that could salvage it.  But it was very easy to make, and it should be easy to improvise in the future.  I seriously doubt you should serve this to children, lest you want them to get used to the taste of beer at an early age.  I hope not...

This was a great recipe, my husband loved it. I added salt and pepper to spice it up a bit. I think this recipe would also be good with black olives in place of mushrooms.

I saw other reviews saying this was bland and doctored it up a bit. I sauteed the mushrooms with garlic and onions, added salt and pepper, dusted the chicken breasts with garlic powder and then when it was simmering I added a chicken boullion cube. It was still a little bland. I also used pecorino/romano cheese instead of parmesan. That flavored it a little more. It was just okay.

Really liked the mushrooms with this, but the beer didn't add a lot to the flavor.  Maybe it's just me because my taste bud senses have become so dulled to beer.  Next time I'll try cooking it in the hard stuff :-)

Great dinner, very easy to prepare and to eat :).  I used a Corrona and thought the flavor was a little too light, so I'll try it again in a few weeks with a different beer.

My family really liked it. I followed the suggestion of putting parsley and oregano in the marinade and cooked onion rings with the mushrooms but otherwise did exactly as the recipe said. The beer was not overpowering (Miller Lite 64) but the kitchen did smell like a brewery :) Good recipe Thanks

I used a local beer from here in Chicago (312). It tasted good and was moist, but next time I'll use a stronger flavored beer.

This really great recipe.  I did listen to the comments and make the following changes: Added fresh garlic and onion to the mushrooms as well as some Italian seasoning. We only had bud light so that is what I used.  Rather than sauteeing the chicken until cooked through, I sauted it  just until it was light browned but not cooked. It finished cooking in the beer. I also cooked some spaghetti, drained it, and then tossed it with some butter, salt, pepper, parsley and a little garlic powder. I served the chicken over top of the speghetti. My very very pickey son loved it. He just asked me to cut the chicken up into pieces the next time. Great basic recipe.

I used a nice dark beer (Smithwicks) and added onions and yellow peppers. Also had melted shredded cheese on top instead of parm. Very tasty!

I thought this was pretty good.  It was a little bland, but that didn't spoil the meal any.  My fiance loved this dish - he added some pepper to his.  Make enough for leftovers the next day - they tasted just as good, if not better than the fresh meal!

This was ok. I thought it was bland. I am going to play around with it. Maybe some Cajun seasoning when marinating the chicken. Added onion and garlic to the mushrooms and will add more mushrooms next time.

I am very picky about what I eat, and usually don't like to try anything new.  This dish was delicious!!!  It was very easy and quick to prepare, and needed only basic ingredients.  I did thou seasoned each peace of chicken with some salt and pepper on each side before putting it on the skillet.  My husband loved it!

I used a barley beer that was left behind from a friend.  I also added lots of garlic (frozen cubes - about 4 total), and some onion, salt and pepper and a dash or two of Worcestershire. 
The chicken turned out very tender and very flavorful!

Well..this was OK, but not the best recipe I ever tried from this site. It needed major adjustments in order to give it an extra flavour apart from the beer.I followed other reviewers advice and added garlic,onion and green and yellow peppers to the mushroom.I also had to put some extra salt and pepper to everything,since after the chicken was done the sauce flavour was still bitter from the beer.It turned out pretty good at the end, but I had to improvise way too much.

It's all right, but kinda bland if you don't serve it over something like wild rice.

This recipe is wonderful.  I didn't find it bland at all.  I generously added course sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper whilst cooking the mushrooms.  It was delicious considering how fast and easy it is to prepare.

This is WONDERFUL!  I can't make it enough times!  I'm finding that it's better for me to use a darker beer (like a lager or stout), and keep it soaking for a little while longer.  What a great taste!  Should be the original "two great tastes that taste great together!"

First off I should say I don’t like beer, but in this recipe it was delicious. I sautés the mushrooms with minced fresh garlic, and I put salt and pepper on the chicken, plus cheese and jalapeño spice. Absolutely delicious. I made a gravy with the juices from the chicken and beer. Yummy

I made this the first time and it was good. Since then I have changed it up a bit and it gets requested regularly. I too marinate the chicken for two hours turning them over in the beer halfway through. My husband is a home brewer and I use a Saison he brewed. I added a large garlic clove minced and a finely diced shallot to the mushroom saute. I seasoned it with some fresh thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Using Tinkerbell926's review I added cheddar cheese along with parmesan cheese. This chicken is so juicy and so flavorful. Thank you for sharing.

This dish needs more flavor. I used a dark beer and added onions but otherwise followed the recipe.  It could use at least some poultry seasoning and probably some garlic as well. Will use leftovers to make a stew adding spices until it has some flavor.

Cooking in Japan is hard when you're not used to grocery shopping! Or cooking at all, for that matter... With help from some other foreign students, I made this and it was delicious. Very moist. Added onions and sliced up string cheese (hard to find "normal" cheese). Put it atop some mixed brown rice, and added frozen mixed vegetables and some spices. Yum! And not too difficult.

This definitely has potential, the chicken stayed quite moist. Next time I'm going to marinate the chicken over-night, I would definitely suggest using a flavorful beer that you like.  We ate it with pasta and used some of the sauce it was cooked in on the pasta as well

Looooved this recipe. I used corona light beer and added lime juice to it, both when I marinated it and when I cooked the chicken and mushrooms. The lime was a GREAT accent to the already amazing flavors. I'm a big fan of mushrooms and my mushrooms really soaked up the beer, lime, butter, onion flavor. I couldn't get enough of this amazing taste! We;ll definitely be eating this again and again

I'd agree with the reviewers who say that this is a little bland.  I added onions and garlic, but it still seemed like it needed more flavor.  To be fair, I didn't have any cheese, but it just seemed like this would be more flavorful.

** A later amendment to my previous review: for some reason, this tasted much better as a leftover.  It may be because I didn't pile the sauce on top this time . . . because of the beer, it's just a little bitter.

Sorry to put a damper on this recipe, but both my husband and myself did not like this at all.  I used a Pale Ale, and cut chicken tenders into large pieces, so perhaps that may contribute to the boring, tastless dish.  It was very easy to prepare, but I will not make it again.

It was a very tasty recipe.  I had never thought of using beer to cook.  It added an interesting flavor to the chicken without over powering the rest of the taste.  It is even good reheated.
