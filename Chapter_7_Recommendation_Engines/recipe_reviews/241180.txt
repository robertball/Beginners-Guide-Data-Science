Boy this sure came in handy when my teenage boys wanted something different, I didn't feel like cooking and needed something super, super easy.  A few suggestions - I have a non-stick waffle iron and next time I will omit the cooking spray.  Also, be sure to flatten the dough a bit. Finally, I couldn't find the corn syrup in my cabinet so I omitted it, added a bit of hot water and mixed well then heated for 20 secs in micro.  Served with sides of bacon and breakfast sausage. YUM!

my son loves waffles, I hate making them!  this was the answer!  I used Grands Apple Cinnamon Cinnabon variety!  they were perfect for this.  I flattened them out and they rose to perfection!  watch the third batch, the more you make the hotter the waffle maker gets.  now I know what I'm gonna do the next time I want a fast cinnamon roll!  my son loved them so much he woke me up early the next morning asking for more unfortunately I bought the last two pkgs.  hopefully they restock soon!  I just thinned the frosting with milk so it was a glaze.  so good!  Served with cheesy scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, breakfast sausage, and fruit.  awesome breakfast for dinner!  my three sons' favorite dinner,

I let my 4 year old grandson be the "chef" and make these. He had fun patting them in his hands to make them thinner, before cooking. I just used the frosting as is. Didn't mess with the other ingredients. Kids enjoyed them!

Eh. Great-sounding idea, but not so good in practice. The dough didn't really cook through properly.

oil the iron no matter what and turn down the heat for those heavy duty iron's to about 3. Thin out the icing with cream and vanilla. Yes and do have with Bacon, everything is better with Bacon!!! Thanks.

These were good for a change of pace but not sure they were worth the effort to clean the waffle iron afterwards.  I will try them again with the waffle iron set to a lower temp than I normally use for waffles.  I have a Waring Double Belgian Waffle Iron and I normally use 3 ½ or 4 for waffles.  I will try 2 ½ or 3.  I hope that this will lead to a better result.  They were to dry and the tops where the layer of cinnamon was, according to my six year old, "A little to crispy."  He helped make them and neither of us "burn food" so they were crispy not burnt he explained.  Also, they didn't go far enough with a single recipe to feed my family of 5 to the same level of fullness that they say normal cinnamon rolls would have left them feeling.   Again, I will try again with using the "grand"er size rolls instead of the normal rolls.  I will  update review then.

My grandkids loved this recipe! I added a little maple syrup and milk to the icing and warmed it in the microwave. The waffle iron needed spraying every time to prevent sticking.

I made these for my family and they loved them.  I like that I didn't need to heat the oven so they were great in the summer.

We used a non-stick waffle iron so I omitted the PAM cooking spray. Also, flatten the dough a bit before placing in the waffle iron.  Finally, I Thinned out the frosting with a little milk, mixed well, then heated for 20 seconds in the microwave @ 80% power.  Served with bacon & sausage links.

My husband did not care for this.  It was dry and had no taste, he said.    They are very easy to make.  Too bad they did not work out for us.  Thanks for the recipe.

This not a good idea. I completely ruined a waffle baker with this recipe.  The canned cinnamon roll dough stuck to the inside of the baker so that I had to take it apart to get it cleaned. The "non-stick" finish was  no longer non-stick after that. Don't try this unless you're prepared to buy a new waffle baker.

Yum.  Loved the crispy edges.  Simple, easy and delic.  Hubby loved it too, but he loves sweets, so this was a no-brainer for him.  Thank you for sharing.
