I loved this recipe, however I did make a couple of minor modifications.  First, I used 4T of butter, and 3.5c of cheese.  Second, I warmed/melted cheese into the milk/egg mixture on medium heat while cooking the macaroni.  Third, I put a layer of Italian Bread Crumbs on top of dish and covered for 15 minutes while baking.  Uncovered it for the last 15 minutes then stirred in the bread crumbs before serving.

I have used this recipe forever and a day. My mom taught me this when I first started to cook as a kid. The only difference is We layer it... macaroni, season lightly,cheese, then repeating steps until macaroni is finished and end by topping with cheese. Then we pour milk and egg mixture over the macaroni and cheese. Sometimes I use a few other cheeses besides just cheddar.

I made this recipe exactly as written for a party. I was kinda embarrassed about it. There wasn't enough cheese in it, it came out really dry and hard on top, and exactly how much salt and pepper should I put in it? I didn't know how much I should put in, I put in a little bit - and it was bland. I was scared I would put in too much if I kept adding more. The cheese mixture wasn't creamy, but more curdy like others had mentioned. It's a good base recipe, but next time I will add more cheese, re-guesstimate how much salt to add, and cover it while baking to help prevent that rock-hard layer of pasta on top, then maybe brown it under the broiler quickly. Leaving the oven on bake to brown dried it out, I think.

I was a little wary of trying this recipe, after reading all the other reviews. But I tried it anyway cause my fiance and I love mac and cheese, this recipe turned out great it wasn't at all clumpy , to dry or anything else that I read on here. The only changes I made were I added 4 cups of mozzarella and cheddar (2cups of each) and baked it for 50 minutes (covered the first  20) I also stirred it a couple times.  Thank you so much for this recipe I will definitely be making this again..

This is really good old-school macaroni, the type that basically keeps its shape when you serve it - exactly what I was looking for.  I only added a few things: I stirred 1/4 tsp. creole seasoning and about 1/8 tsp. cayenne along with the salt & pepper in the milk mixture. I used a little more colby-jack cheese  than noted, and reserved a little handful to top the macaroni before going into the oven.  After baking for 30 minutes, I topped the macaroni with buttered Italian-style bread crumbs (almost a cup of crumbs and 2 Tbsp. melted butter) and baked the last 10 minutes.  Zippier than average macaroni, but still recognizable and very comforting.  Perfect!

Excellent recipe! This one is very similar to the one I had lost. I added more cheese (LOTS of cheese - mozzerella and cheddar and colby), and topped with breadcrumbs (something I used to do). I advise to use the large elbow noodles, as they "hold" the cheese better than the small ones.

I whipped together two eggs, added about a 1/3 cup seaoned breadcrumbs to the egg mixture, and then poured it atop the pasta.  Then i added the cheeses (variety) to 1 can of evaporated milk that i let simmer.  Add seasonings to the cheese mixture and when bubbly pour over pasta.  To make it a complete meal, i steamed some broccoli florets, carrots, and cauliflower and added it to the pasta before pouring the cheese mixture in. Sprinkle the top with some more breadcrumbs and bake.  It was DELISH!

Don't pour the melted butter into the egg mixture without letting it cool slightly first.  Pouring any hot liquid into egg or egg mixture should always be done carefully, by letting it cool slightly first and then by mixing it in vigourously to avoid letting any of the egg set.  This macaroni definitely tastes even better leftover and reheated.

My father makes a Mac n Cheese similar to this but I could never make it come out right. After reading this I made my own little twists to it and it comes out PERFECTLY cheesy throughout and full of flavor. After I boil the noodles I add butter, salt and pepper them to taste. Then I layer them like I do a lasagna. Noodles, cheese, noodles, cheese finishing with cheese on top. Then I follow the direction with the 1 egg and milk BUT I add melted butter to the mix of milk and egg then I pour over the layers just until it comes to the top layer and bake in oven at 350 until its starting to brown on top. The top comes out a little crunchy and everything else is CHEESY!!

I was a little leary of this recipe based on the other reviews. However, I needed a simple mac and cheese recipes.  I took all  the reviews into account and made some adjustments when I made this mac and cheese. Here are my changes: I used 22 oz of macaroni, 1/2 stick of butter, 2 cups of mozzerella cheese and 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese. I added salt and pepper to the milk, butter, and egg mixture. I did not mix the cheese with the mixture, but layered the cheese, alternating with the macaroni. Then I poured the liquid mixture on top and laid a final layer of cheese. I covered it with aluminum foil and baked for 30 minutes. Then I removed the foil and baked for another 20 minutes. The dish turned out great!

I used whole wheat pasta and it was really good that way. This needs to be covered for 1st part of baking otherwise noodles get crunchy on top.

Cook the macaroni noodles as directed. Heat milk, add cheese and mix til melted. Then cool about 1/2 cup mixture and add to eggs. This prevents curdling. Return egg mixture to milk/cheese and mix well with macaroni, then place in prepared dish to bake.

Great basic recipe to personalize. The first time I made it, I followed the exact recipe, but added Italian breadcrumbs on top towards the end. It was okay that way, but better as leftovers reheated. The last time I made it, the only changes I made were 1 cup of milk instead of 2, and A LOT more cheese. I just added more until I thought it looked right, probably 3 times as much cheese as the recipe calls for. I used Cheddar but also added Colby Jack and Mozzarella. After about 25 minutes in the oven, I stirred, then sprinkled the Italian breadcrumbs on top and cooked about 5 more minutes. So much better this way! The husband loves it, and so do I!

This is just like my grandmother use to make when I was young and I am 64yrs old. She would layer the macroni and sliced cheddar cheese, ending with cheese and then pour the milk and egg that had been whisked together over the top. I think she covered it for the most part while it was baking.  Years ago they didn't eat really seasoned food like we do today, certainly not spicey food. This is an "old fashion" mac and cheese, and I just loved it., thanks so much for posting this recipe.

This is a great base recipe. However, like a lot of other reviewers I changed it up a little. I've made it on several occasion and it has never been dry or too crispy.

I use about 4 c cheese and usually mix sharp cheddar with asiago. I also chop half an onion and saute it before adding it to the mac and cheese mixture.  Top with bread or cracker crumbs and this is absolutely amazing. Sometimes I add a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder.

At my house a dish can never have too much cheese, onion, or garlic! ^_^

This is a very easy recipes and everyone in my family - even the picky eaters loved it. I did make one change though. I layered the macaroni and cheese so the cheese would be evenly distributed throughout. Also a trick that my grandmother showed me - I added a pinch of baking soda to the milk mixture so the milk would not curdle while baking.

This is a great recipe, but you need to use 2 eggs.  I have been using one similiar to this.  I used 2 cups of uncooked macaroni and slightly less than 2 cups of milk, but you need 2 eggs to keep it from being too watery.

Also added extra spices-paprika and garlic powder--soooo good! Other than that I made it exactly as written.

For those looking for super cheesy creamy Mac N cheese - this is not it.  This is the down home baked Mac N cheese with a crunchy top and is SO GOOD.  I've been trying to imitate a passed relatives Mac N cheese for years - and this is it!  I also did layers and the pour the milk mixture over the entire thing.  Covered with foil for 30 min.  I quadrupled the batch for Thanksgiving and there was nothing left!  Best comfort Mac N Cheese recipe yet!

GREAT RECIPE! After looking at all of the mac & cheese recipes on here, I decided this was the one I wanted to try because of the few ingredients.  I also read the reviews and used some of the tips.  I did use 2 eggs (good idea), 4 tbs butter (too much for me) and bread crumbs (not measured...just eyeballed).  I also used shredded sharp cheddar and colby jack/cheddar mix.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was great!! So glad someone posted it.  OH! I also sprinkled cheese on top with 15 minutes left in the time.  So easy to make...and I will be making it again and again!!

This was my first time making baked mac n' cheese and this receipe was great. I did add the butter to the milk and eggs and layered in the cheese with the mixture on top as some other people recommended. I also topped with the bread crumbs and it came out delicious.

I found this to be very bland and had to add more cheese after I removed it from the oven. The top and sides also ended up a bit too crunchy.

Made this for Thanksgiving. I followed directions but I think next time I make it I will mix the hot macaroni with the cheese before adding the liquid mixed because the cheese all clumped and was not even throughout the dish. Also the top of the dish was hard so I think it needs to be covered while cooking. It also needed alot more cheese than the recipe asked for. In all with the modficiations I suggested I think it is a great dish.

Very good. It was creamy with a crunchy top. I baked it for thirty minutes with foil on top, then 20 minutes without. I also kept the cheese out of the milk mixture. I made layers: macaroni, salt and pepper, cheese. After three layers, I poured the milk and egg mixture overall.

Followed recipe exactly. My kids (who eat anything) picked at it and wouldn't finish half a plate.

Wonderful and just what I was looking for. I followed directions except I mixed everything in a bowl before pouring in the casserole. I also added, for personal preference, some dry mustard and grated nutmeg. My new favorite and so easy. No more white sauce recipes for me!!

Used 3 cups of HelluvaGood Yellow Cheddar Cheese. It turned out clumpy not creamy. Best advise heat milk and cheese together to create a sauce- maybe it would come out better.

A very good homestyle mac and cheese recipe.  I added some extra cheeses (shredded monteray jack, parmesan) and it was great.  I also sprinkled some plain bread crumbs on top before cooking. Very yummy.  I'd make it again.  Also good if you have a bunch of different cheeses laying around that you want to use up.

I really enjoyed this recipe & so did my family.  Before I made this I read some of the reviews that said this needs to be stirred halfway through so I did that & I also noticed that some of you said that it ends up tasting a little bland so instead of bread crumbs I grated up some garlic texas toast & sprinkled that on top.  It was REALLY good.  I also used 1/2 cheddar & 1/2 colby jack cheese.  My picky husband liked it so I know it's good =)

This recipe was a hit at my house.  To adapt a little, I use two cups of macaroni, and then for the cheese I use a combination of sharp cheddar (1 c), monterrey jack (1 c) and asiago (1/2c).  The asiago gives it a little kick.  It could use some a little spicing up, but overall a very good recipe.  Thanks Meredith!

Great base recipe to edit to your own tastes.  I altered the recipe a bit to work with the ingredients I had on hand.  I used 12 oz whole wheat Pasta Penne cooked 5 mins (don't cook it all the way).   I used 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk plus 4 oz 2% milk.  To the milk/egg mix I added 2 TBSP of flour and 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.   I used a mixture of yellow and white shredded cheese that totaled about 3 cups.  I mixed half of this in with the milk/egg mix as well.  I then folded my cooked pasta to the egg/milk/cheese mix and poured that into greased baking dish.  I sprinkled remaining shredded cheese over the top of this and baked.   Came out VERY cheesy and good.  My alterations not for the faint of cheese!  It was not watery at all either.

Curdled?  No.......it is the eggs that brings and binds this recipe together.  I have been searching for a quick recipe that does not involve making a roux with flour and came across this one.  It is EXACTLY what I've been looking for.  I added about 1/4 cup minced onion and about 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  Loved it!!

This macaroni is just like what my grandmother used to make.  It is NOT supposed to be creamy so if you're looking for creamy this is NOT the recipe you want.    Make sure you season with salt and pepper.    I always use ziti because that's what my grandmother used.  Good memories!

I did as the recipe stated, except I covered the dish for the first 20 minutes (other reviews said it would get hard on top).  I stirred while it was baking too!  BUT, no one cared for it, very bland. I even used more cheese than was called for.  Sorry.....

This recipe has become my favorite version of homemade mac n' cheese.  I do, however, cook the noodles until they're al dente, and use less milk.  I also stir a few times while it's baking to distribute everything evenly.

I followed the directions exactly and for some reason the macaroni on the top and edges of the recipe turned out hard and impossible to chew. I'm sure I followed the preparation of the pasta correctly before it was placed in the oven so I can't see how it went wrong. The center of the recipe turned out flavorful enough but I wasn't happy with the consistency of it. I can't tell if I just screwed the recipe up somehow or if it just wasn't a good recipe. I will try again.

I really like this recipe and I've been fixing it for about 55 years. It's better than some of the recipes that have a flour base. This recipe does not set up like concrete the next day.  I follow the directions as printed but always add a pitch of red pepper flakes, not enough to make it too spicy but just a "nip" also a small pinch of nutmeg.  If I have some chips in the pantry, usually do cause no one finishes of the crumbs in the bottom of the bag, I use these for a topping.  Also, I almost alway vary my cheeses, matter of fact I usually make this dish when I have several cheeses in the refrigerator, not enough of one to really make anything so I just shred them up and use them. I think my favorite one time was Fontina, Cheddar and a bit of Gorgonzola.
I also add a lot of pepper to my Mac & Cheese.

This was my 1st Mac & Cheese from scratch and it was delicious. Two things stood out about the recipe that you have to be conscious of: salt and pepper ( to little and it could turn out bland), and cooking time ( took about 50-55 mins for the top to brown). I did change one thing from the original recipes, I used a  three cheese combination instead of sharp.

IMPORTANT!! This needs two eggs, not one!! Otherwise it will be watery or crumbly like cottage cheese. I added extra cheese because I love cheese and I also added mushrooms (for vitamin D) and chicken (for protein). I ended up talking to a homeless man. Come to find out he's a disabled veteran. I made this because it's filling and my husband and I had dinner with him. We all loved it. My husband said "it's like eating gold!" and he scraped the dish clean. I was looking for a filling, delicious dish and this really hit the spot.

Boil macaroni only 5 minutes, it's going in the oven. Add to macaroni: milk, eggs, seasoning salt, and a whole lotta cheese! Please do not hold back on the cheese!!! Velveeta at the top- brown that top in the oven.

I used the option to calculate for 6 servings...there were WAY too many noodles. I discarded nearly half, and then it barely fit into 9x13 pan. I opted to use a tad bit more butter and increased the cheese by 2 cups so the texture was nice and it was cheesy enough. Good taste...not watery at all like I thought it might be. I'd use this recipe again.

This was good but turned out like little melted cheese curds that did not stick to the macaroni at all. So the texture was not that great. I had added extra butter and cheese like reviews said but if I make it again I will not do extra butter (it was a little too greasy and maybe that made the cheese slide around), will use large macaroni noodles, and melt the cheese with the milk mixture before adding to the mac.

Bland yes. Didn't receive rave reviews like I do when I don't use a recipe (memory and eye-balling ingredients). But I like it, just add some salt and more sharp cheddar and it's great. When baking macaroni and cheese I suggest always using sharp cheddar.

This recipe is wonderful!  I have been looking for a good baked mac & cheese recipe for a while and I have finally found it.  The only thing I would like to add, and only because I have read all the other reviews on this recipe, is this...If you are looking for a creamy mac & cheese, you do not want to go with a baked recipe.  Creamy mac & cheese is much better if you do it on the stovetop.  Baking it doesn't make it creamy.  Excellent recipe!

I make this recipe just about weekly.  I'm in college, so this is a perfect recipe for me--Cheap ingredients and it's quick and easy.  Also, it reheats so so so well.  I make it monday and finish the leftovers Thursday lots of times, and it's still just as good.  My family loved it too!  My all time favorite!

I thought this was a great base recipe. I used a pepper jack /cheddar/Mozz combo. I had a few open bags of cheese on hand. We tend to like our mac 'n cheese spicy. I always do a buttered italian bread crumb topping.

This is a great way to get young kids turned on to cooking... very easy, and no sauce to mess with. I do agree with some of the other reivews though.  Add A LOT more cheese. (personal preference)  Also, stir it half way through to keep the noodles moist.  And finally, add shredded cheese to the top about half way through and then broil for the last few minutes just to brown the top.  I considered adding my personal favorite bread crumbs, but I'll save that for next time when my daughter makes this.

This is a very easy recipe, but nothing fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. It needs more cheese and more flavor. My husband and I both had to salt ours because there wasn't a lot of flavor. I might try it next time with different cheeses as well. The noodles on top get really hard. I didn't mind, but my son hated that. I might sprinkle some cheese on the top before putting it in the oven to help prevent that. This is a good basic recipe that can work with modifications.

very good basic mac & cheese recipe, although it feeds way more than three people. i halved the recipe and that fed about five as a side dish. i do recommend using more cheese, though. i used about 2.5c and that's making half of the recipe. i also added seasoned salt instead of regular salt with the pepper. it turned out pretty well. thanks for sharing.

This recipe flopped in my family.  I had to add more cheese after I took it out of the oven.  It wasnt cheesy enough by far and too dry from the start.  It was very bland and anyone trying it should spice it up.  I wasn't able to salvage this recipe.

This was quite tasty, however it wasn't the rich creamy macaroni and cheese that I was looking for.  A much dryer version.

If you grate the cheese finely the mixture will go inside the noodles! I used old cheddar.  Yummy!!

I made this one but added a little extra cheese on top and put some sausage inside. Cooked it for about 25 minutes and used garlic salt instead of regular salt but still put in some pepper. Turned out delicious!

The appearance is not appetite appeasing...  It turned out lumpy and curdly.  The taste was not too bad.  I did add more cheese though...

I'm sorry, I hate to give anyone a bad review. But I made this exactly as directed. As others said: The pasta on top cooked to a dry hard layer, no nice browning. The cheese was not near enough. I did not care for this mac and cheese recipe.

Layer, layer, layer...oh, and melt the cheese in the milk mixture. Put a layer of macaroni in your dish, pour the milk mixture over that, season (if desired), then sprinkle some shreaded cheese on top of that....repeat. This will give you a milkier, cheesier outcome, with more flavor. As one other reviewer mentioned however, this is not the super creamy cheesy macaroni recipe. It is the old school comfort version....and it is yummy!!

I added ground beef, onion and bacon, and used extra old cheese, so it would have more flavour.  I enjoyed it though, as did my family.  I also spiced it up with some chilli powder, cayenne, hot sauce, and lots of black pepper, but we like our meals SPICY

I will definately make this again

I loved this recipe!  It was exactly what I was looking for - good old fashioned Mac and Cheese.  

I used skim milk.  My husband did not care for the crunchy top, but I liked it.

Hmmm.. This didn't come out good at all. Clumpy and the consistency wasn't what I was looking for. Mine didn't turn out like the picture at all and I followed the recipe to a T. There are better mac and cheese recipes out there. I think maybe the extra steps/ingredients in other recipes is worth it. Thanks anyway, it was worth a try.

My daughter made this for her younger siblings who are usually mac and cheese lovers.  They didn't finish their helpings, and I would agree that this was a little bland and not very creamy.

Finally I found the basic macaroni and cheese recipe like my mother made - baked! It was great - but like others posted, next time I'm using WAY more cheese.

Reading the reviews helped to make this a 4 star recipe for me. I added red pepper flakes like I experienced with the Bahamian version of this recipe, garlic powder and plenty of salt and pepper. To combat clumps, I cooked 5 minutes, stirred, cooked 5 more minutes and stirred again, then covered it and cooked for 30 minutes, taking off the foil for the last 10 minutes. It looked perfect and my guests ate every last bit.

By making a few adjustments to this recipe it turned out to be a hit with my family.  First, I added more cheese (about 1 cup more), milk ,s&p, then I added the cheese mixture to the hot pasta to avoid any clumps.  The result: a cheesy, creamy dish that we absolutely loved!!

This was very good.  It is much better the next day.  I added an extra cup of cheese, used whole milk, and baked covered and removed cover the last five minutes.  It was very creamy. I made this as a side dish at Thanksgiving for the grandkids and the whole family loved it!

For those who might be alarmed by the comments about clumpy cheese, don't be.  I experienced clumpyness, but that sorted itself out in the over.  I made some minor adjustments - a pinch of rosemary and basil, replaced 1-cup of milk with 1-cup of light cream and omitted the butter - as I wanted to make the recipe my own. I served the macaroni and cheese along side a simple rocket salad and my Dutch husband had nothing but praise.  I will definitely make this again.

This macaroni and cheese is delicious!  I used 3 1/2 cups of cheese instead of 2 1/2.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used whole milk and baked for 40 minutes.  It turned out perfect!!  My kids loved it and asked for seconds.  Highly recommended.

This recipe is fast and easy, yet it needs some adjustments: more cheese, 1-1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, and, if you have a spicy palate, hot pepper sauce, cayenne and/or paprika. Also, may top it with parmesan cheese before baking. A last piece of advice: to make it a full meal, stir browned ground beef, franks or bacon bits in the mac and cheese mixture before it goes in the oven.

I covered the dish with aluminum foil for the first thirty minutes of cooking, and I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added a pinch of cayenne pepper and a dash of cajun seasoning to the cheese mixture. I was kind of scared because when I poured the cheese mixture in with the pasta, it didn't seem to be mixing quite right, but the end result was wonderful. I think it might have been too dry if I didn't cover it, but it turned out great, and the spices gave it just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the dish. I would definitely make this again.

I made this recipe twice, and both times it came out with a curd-like substance between the noodles. Others complained about `bits of egg' and clumpiness and I agree. Both times I gradually warmed the egg mixture with warm milk as I went. The curds developed in the baking process. Very odd. Otherwise, it's a pretty good recipe, very simple. Definitely better the next day. I'll try without egg next time.

Great recipe!!!  I made a few changes though, simplifying the recipe.  I used uncooked macaroni and increased the milk to 2&1/2 cups.  I also added breadcrumbs to the top, stirred half way through, and added more breadcrumbs to the top.  Turned out beautifully!  My husband even had thirds!!!

Like noodles with cheese melted on them--feel like I could have just nuked some cheese on em & saved the time I spent baking them.  My 17 yr old son actually chose this recipe.  Will keep looking for a good mac n cheese recipe.

I made this one afternoon with a friend. We followed the recipe exactly and everything looked fine until we tasted it. Maybe there should of been more cheese and less milk or maybe it should have been a different kind of cheese because it came out very milky. The noodles were just filled with a milky butter liquid because the cheese wasn't creamy enough to mix with it. All in all, I would suggest finding a different recipe for baked mac and cheese

Meredith this is the original recipe from the first Betty Crocker Cook Book. I have always made it and never changed a thing except instead of melting the cheese I cut it up in chunks and mix it in with the macaroni before pouring the milk & egg mixture over it. Either way it is 5 stars.

This was an easy recipe from others I have seen online. It was really good and I will be adding it to the list of dishes we have for upcoming family gathering. The only things I did differently was add some fresh bacon and onion bits (similar to bacon bits) to the top of the macaroni with the final layer of cheese. This gave the mac & cheese great flavor and that extra crunch was outstanding! Also like I had read from other posts, I added the egg and milk mixture to the macaroni after it had been layered. I covered the mac & cheese for 30 min and removed cover for another 20.
Thank you for sharing this, it was a big help, and a great starter to help me create my own mac & cheese!!

I found this recipe while looking for a way to take my modified kraft mac n cheese recipes and make something delicious and decadent out of it. I found this recipe and after a few modifications the following is the result.
I scaled the recipe up for a 3 quart pan and 4-5 servings/people (as an entire meal). 3 6oz packages of Annies Cheddar Shells mac n cheese, 2 eggs, 3 cups of milk, ~3-4 cups of shredded mexican four cheese blend cheese, and 3 tablespoons of butter, 4 (1lb.) of Rosie's gluten free smoked chicken apple sausage, bacon bits, spices, and a large orange bellpepper. The actual prep of the recipe is pretty much the same save for the different ingredients. You half-cook the sausage and bellpepper in oil in a frying pan with some cajun spice and crushed rainbow pepper. The sauce is made the same, but add the powdered cheese from annies as well and mix well, adding some sea salt, garlic powder, cajun spice (four dashes), and a crushed rainbow pepper. Pour and mix the pasta, sausage and bellpepper, and modified sauce in the pan. Finally, add a layer of the shredded cheese on top along with some crushed rainbow pepper and a tiny bit of sea salt on top for flavor. optionally some crushed red pepper if you want to add a little more kick. Thank you so so much for this recipe, as itw as the perfect basis for me to make this modification, and I share this modified recipe for any who want it.

I've tried several different mac and cheese recipes over the last 20 or so years and have never been satisfied. This is it! This recipe is creamy, cheesy, and when I made it for my Thanksgiving diner, everyone loved it! This is true southern style mac and cheese!

I should have read all of the reviews first. There were a tonne of adjustments people have made to give it the rating they did. I ended up making my usual stove top cheese sauce as there was none in the baked version and my kids wouldn't eat it.

This is a pretty good mac & cheese.  It's not as creamy as I prefer, but my 6 year old son adores it so this is the recipe I most frequently use.  In order to retain some of the moisture, I bake it covered for about 20 minutes and then uncovered for another 20.

Just made this and it was awesome! It looked a bit watery before I put it in the oven so I added bread crumbs and more cheese on the top. I will definitely be making this again!

Mostly the top is hard and chewy and the bottom is egg and noodle. IF you do try to do this one. Experiment and doctor it to the max. This is a prototype to a beautiful recipe. Good luck!

Very traditional! To me...This IS mac and cheese. In my family, we make this for holidays or just on regular night where a good sturdy comfort food dish is needed. It's not "creamy, béchamel-based,or velveta-ie.It is custard-ie and warm. Although I did use 3 cups of cheese instead of two and a 1/2. Thank you Meredith !

This is the first time I have made baked mac and cheese.  After reading the other ratings, I decided to use 4 cups of cheese and then add 1/4 cup of bread crumbs on the top of the mixture.  It was GREAT - I know this will become a family favorite.

This was very easy and everyone loved it. After reading the reviews I did cover with aluminum foil and baked for 30 mins to avoid it drying out too much.

Scrumptious. I did make a few changes. I added a can of Cr. of Mushroom soup and used only 1 1/2 C of Cheese and one can of Milk and used the 2nd cup of milk with the soup. I also topped it with Buttered Bread Crumbs. It baked at 350 for 35 mins.

I was looking for a comfort recipe...and this was perfect!  Since our family is ham lovers, I added chunks of cubed ham, and mixed it in before cooking.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

I ended up using both elbows and shells... I had a little of each.  I also dabbed a little extra butter on the top.  Instead of cheddar cheese, I used a taco blend and added some muenster.  I did forget to season the recipe and a little seasoning would have made it even better, but the different cheeses helped.  All in all it was pretty much what I was looking for :)

Great recipe and so easy to make. I topped mine with Saltines.  My husband prefers Ritz but I loved it with the extra salty top.  We will make this again!  We served with a salad to make a well rounded meal.

This is exactly what I was looking for! I used low fat cheddar and skim milk so the consistency was a little more stuck together than if I used the full fat versions but it was yummy.  I did double the recipe and added an additional cup of cheese.  I think it would be best to try to mix this up before pouring it in the casserole dish for even distribution.  Also, i found it needs to sit for 5-10 minutes before you serve because I had a little liquid at the bottom of the pan but it was absorbed once it sat for a few minutes. Very yummy, will make again!

This is the macaroni and cheese dish of your family reunions, it will not be creamy, and you don't want it that way. 

I did a few alterations. I did add extra cheese, but I don't think I needed to. I sprinkled some on top. I also covered the dish for the first 30 minutes of cooking and took it off for the last 10. It came out great, not chewy. 

This is much better the next day when the cheese and macaroni have gotten comfortable together and it's not so gooey and stringy. (unless you like that, then definitely eat it soon after cooking!)

My family loved this version of mac and cheese. I followed the recipe as written except that I used a 4-cheese mexican cheese blend.  The only thing I would change is to make a double batch next time.  Everyone wanted seconds!!

I LOVED this recipe because it was quick and easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I added a lot of salt and pepper to help with "blandness" that others mentioned, and I stirred it half way through cooking time to help make it creamier (maybe try stirring even more often if you don't like "chunks").  If you are looking for a recipe to match that which comes out of the "blue box," this isn't it.  But what a wonderful homemade alternative!!  A great comfort food!  THANKS!!  
:-)

Very close to the way my mother taught me some 50+ years ago.  However, I have just launched myself into the future and bought an Instant Pot (Duo60Plus) which I have only had a couple days.  Does anyone have any ideas how this recipe might be converted to the IP.

Follow Gwen's advice!  This is a great dish.  Add extra 2 tbsp butter and extra 1-1.5 cups of sharp cheddar cheese.  Do warm in milk/egg.  Top with those Italian breadcrumbs and bake.  I baked foil on 15 min at 350, then 400 F uncovered 25 min more.  Yummy as a side with Balsamic Glazed pork chops!

This recipe was BLAND and DRY, even after I added extra cheese and butter, and put buttered crumbs on top. I did those things because I read the reviews and hoped this would fix it. I won't make it again.

It turned out good but 2.5 cups of cheese isn't enough.... Next time I will use about 3.5- 4 cups. Also I used 3 different cheeses... Mozzarella, mild cheddar, and American.

I've made this recepie twice now. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it will never live up to how good my dad's baked Mac and cheese is. When I make this I make a few modifications 1st I use three cups of cheese in the actual dish, and 1/2 a cup of cheese for the top. 2nd I layer noodles, salt, pepper, cheese, noodles, salt, pepper, cheese etc. And then poor the egg/milk mixture over the top of everything. 3rd I take it out of the oven after 15 minuets, mix it all up again, then top it with the 1/2 of cheese and some homemade bread crumbs. I then put it back in the oven and cook for another 15 minuets. If the 15 minuets are over and the top isn't as crispy as I'd like, I turn on the broiler for about 2-3 minuets or until desired toastyness. :)))) delish.

Very classic Mac and cheese dish. Loved it! Although I adjusted the serving size I still cut back a little on the milk, but otherwise made it just like the recipe. Turned out great.

I've used this recipe three times and it's amazing! I recommend using different types of shredded cheese just to mix things up. Other than that, the recipe is absolutely perfect!

This hit the spot on a cold Maine winter night. What I did differently: added 1 tsp mustard powder, 1/2 tsp salt and several dashes paprika to the liquid mixture, in addition to the cheddar cheese, I added about a 1/2 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese. I also heated up the milk, cheese, egg, butter mixture whisking it constantly until it all melted and poured it on the lightly cooked pasta and finished it off with some seasoned bread crumbs. Yum!

This is very close to a recipe I used in a restaurant, except we didn't add any margarine or butter. We just cooked the pasta and immediately rinsed in cold water, poured it in a large casserole type dish and mixed in enormous amounts of cheese, then salt and pepper to taste(sea salt and fresh ground pepper is best) and mixed it all very well.(the cooling of the pasta kept the cheese from melting before we were finished with...)Then poured in a mixture of milk and eggs and slid the pan back and forth to spread it all out evenly, filling as many gaps in the pasta as is possible, and where the egg/milk mixture was just ever so slightly below the top of the pasta, then topped it with more cheese and bread crumbs :):) I'm glad to see someone else use milk and eggs in their mac and cheese because it DOES make a HUGE difference! Of course you can always "cheat" and add things on top like sun dried tomatoes, fresh mushroon slices or like I'm doing right now, adding pre-fried and drained bacon and adding only the meat part in crumbles. I figure there's already enough fat in the pan the way it is lol I've honestly not tried Meredith's recipe YET, but as a former cook for a living and just do it now for myself(boring but I get to experiment a lot!)for group events or just for my neighbor, it sounds DELICIOUS! Anyone who cooks a lot gets that "sense" of how something would taste, so you know what I mean. I promise to cook Meredith's version because it sounds like a DEFINITE WINNER!

I made this for me and my husband and we both loved it. The top does get a little more crunchy but I still really like the top part as well and I feel like the underneath part stay nice and moist. If you cook it in a larger sized pan then in the directions it will probably be more dry and crunchy. I also used a mixture of cheeses instead of just cheddar which was very tasty. Definetly on our make again list. My husband says he thinks it's almost better than the Mac and cheese from noodles and company.

This was my first time baking mac n cheese and this recipe gave me a quick and easy guide. I did make one tweak which was to make it spicy and shredded cheese on top. Could use other tweaks to enhance taste and consistency

I just use basic Velveeta (the more expensive 2% milk variety) +  a little extra milk to a pot of macaroni. I season it with a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper. Tip: Don't ever let the kids see you adding pepper. You have to sneak it in. Cayenne disappears into the cheese sauce. If you don't add the pepper, it will be bland.

Add a little bit of cheddar or gruyere for flavor, but otherwise just leave it alone and don't mess with it, or try to out do it like Bobby Flay. If you use too much egg, cheese, and butter it tends to separate. You don't need butter, eggs, onions, fancy cheeses or breadcrumbs. Kids won't like it that way. With the Velveeta trick, you can eat it right out of the pot. 

Tip: I would refrigerate before I baked to set the dish. Otherwise it will turn to soup.

This is a great base recipe. I made a few tweeks and it came out amazing!!  I used 3/4 box of cavatappi pasta cooked for 5 minutes then placed into a greased glass baking pan. I sprinkled a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp paprika, and an ounce of cubed gruyere cheese over this.  For the cheese mix I heated 2 cups milk, 1 egg, 3 tbl butter, 2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 4 oz cubed gruyere cheese, 2 oz extra sharp cheese cubed,  and then all extra shredded cheese I had in my fridge (it ended up being about 1 1/2 cups of various mozzarella, pizza and Mexican blends). Once melted and bubbly that was poured over the pasta. Cooked that uncovered for 10 minutes then added 5 slices of almost cooked bacon and covered with a mixture of buttered and browned Italian bread crumbs, ritz crackers and Panko bread crumbs. Covered and cooked for 15 minutes. Then uncovered sprinkled with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese and baked for 5 more minutes. AMAZING.

I did this a couple of years ago, and it wasn't a popular hit around the house.  Probably user error.  This time around, everyone loved it including my semi-finicky 5-year old.  Personally, I love it.  I think the sweetness of the crackers can be a little much, but that would be more only (very minor) criticism.  Aside from that, perfect.

This is the recipe my mom went by for as long as I can remember. My husband fell in love with it at a family dinner and I've been making it myself ever since. I love to try different types of cheese in it as well as add some freshly fried bacon into the mixture. Delicious!

This is an excellent base recipe, though I did slightly modify it based on other reviewers' comments; in all, I would recommend to add more milk and more cheese, so that you have an adequate amount of sauce prior to baking. I upped the milk to about 3 cups, whisked the egg with the milk in a saucepan, simmered it on low heat on the stove, and then added the butter and shredded cheese, until the cheese started to melt within the milk mixture. I quickly realized it would not be "cheesy" enough, so added more until I thought it was adequate; probably in excess of 3 cups of cheese. Then poured the cheesy mixture over the macaroni noodles and baked for about 20 minutes. In the end, it turned out GREAT, and my husband said it tasted like a Southern-restaurant quality dish.

I really love this recipe! It is easy to understand and follow. The first time I made the macaroni as is and the second time I added a couple of changes. I found that if you add finely diced white onion to the macaroni and cheese before you bake it it adds a kick and more crunch to the dish. I also added a crispy bacon topping and did not use any additional salt and pepper. My family and friends really enjoyed the dish and I bet you will too!! Happy Cooking!

The egg/butter/milk/cheese mixture separated when I poured it over the pasta, turning the top into a cheesy crust and the inside into a curdy egg mixture. 

I recommend you heavily tweak it.

Great base recipe, but the cheese sauce DEFINITELY needs to be melted before adding to noodles.  There were a lot of milky chunks in it.  I still ate it though!  Also, maybe more cheese.

We loved this dish! So easy too! Didn't have macaroni so we used Penne. Used 3 cups of cheese and 1/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs. Mixed it all in a large bowl before putting in the pan to cook. Baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for last 10. My 15 year old picky vegetarian loved it! Will definitely make again.

Growing up in the south I have eaten a bunch of mac n cheese. I typically make a roux and have never tried the egg method was I was intrigued  by this recipe. I read other reviews and was concerned about possible texture issues. I knew to temper my eggs to keep from curdling but the mac and cheese ended up with white curds. How disappointing :( I did not care for  this at all, I could taste the eggs. My older 2 boys ate it and thought it was ok. Upon further questioning I got stares of what did you sneak into my food. It is important to read the other reviews and follow suggestions such as adding extra cheese (I increased to 3 cups) and covering while baking .I think this is possibly a good base but it needs a bunch of tweaks to get the recipe just right and curd free.

So I was never much of a creative cooker and therefore turned to websites for my recipes. I found this recipe about a year ago and have enjoyed making it ever since. I do add extra cheese (about 4 cups total) and I use a variety (mostly sharp cheddar, with some jalapeño jack). I also add minimal salt and pepper because the cheese gives it the spice it needs and the cheese I feel that too much salt is no bueno but you can always add more if there isn't enough. All in all, we really enjoy this recipe and it's so quick and simple that you don't have to slave in the kitchen for hours just to have a good meal.

Excellent recipe.  I have made this several times and it is always a big hit.  I modified it for my husband who has wheat, gluten, egg yolk and dairy allergies.  I used egg whites, rice macaroni noodles, no butter, and rice cheese. My husband LOVED it.

Great basic recipe!  I added more cheese to the top prior to baking and then added bread crumbs and broiled it until golden brown on top.  I used cheddar and Monterrey jack cheeses. Everyone is right, this dish is delicious next day!!

I also edited this recipe for the ingredients I had on hand.I used rainbow whole wheat rotini, and scalded my milk before incorporating three cups of cheese, one of cheddar and two of sharp white cheddar. I also added a half cup of white bread crumbs, as the mixture looked a bit watery, and a half teaspoon of mustard powder, then tempered in the egg and poured the whole mixture evenly over the pasta.     I had no problems with 'curdy' texture, and certainly no bits of cooked egg. I do wish that I had covered the dish for the first twenty minutes, however.

I followed this recipe and found that it was watery and I did think that it was ok but watery, I think that next time I will cook for longer and add more cheese.

I read some of the reviews and did 4TBSP of butter and 3.5 cups of cheese.  I added bread crumbs too.  My 3 & 5 year olds cleaned their plates...so did my husband :)

I would say that there are other mac and cheese recipes that I prefer.  This one has eggs in it which I had never tried before and I can't see the advantage.      I didn't like the fact that the recipe didn't call for the sauce to be prepared separately and so I did that because I felt it would be much better.  I had to add more cheese and I also added flour because it was far too thin.

I made this once and neglected to add it to my recipe box.  What a mistake!  I spent the better part of this last week trying to hunt it down again.  I made some of the modifications other reviewers recommended - almost double the amount of cheese and add some Italian seasoned breadcrumbs on top - yum!  This recipe is now safe and sound in my recipe box so that I can refer to it again and again and again...

For those who had curdling- your oven was too hot. That's what happens to cheese when it is overcooked. I've been looking for the perfect mac and cheese recipe, and this is a decent technique. Makes a slightly drier mac and cheese than the bechamel type. I like my food with a little kick, so I used Comte cheese instead of cheddar, a clove of crushed garlic, and added about a teaspoon of ground mustard to the milk mixture. Also topped it with panko flakes. Haha! I think I made a whole new recipe!

It all depends on taste. I think the egg gives this mac and cheese a quiche texture, which I prefer. That is what some are describing as curdled.

You know, my grandmother has a recipe that I used to love...until I made this one myself! I see these reviews of it not turning out right for certain people- just cut back on the butter a little and add more cheese and spices to taste, as any good cook would, it's plain common sense. It's all trial and error, but it is very good if you try the things I did (and if you like spice, try a little bit of cyan pepper, to your taste.) My husband and family LOVED it!

Thank you for this recipe!  I just moved into my own home and cooking is brand new to me.  I was craving some good ole mac and cheese and this recipe was perfect!  I followed everything except I used evaporated milk, two eggs and Mrs. Dash as seasoning (not keen on salt).  I mixed it up while it was baking because all of the mixture had settled to the bottom. I also kept it covered.  It tasted so good!  Next time I would add more cheese.

I used this recipe the first time I made macaroni and cheese.  It is awesome.  I made for a staff potluck and there was nothing left.  It reminds so much of the macaroni my grandmother always made just for me at holiday's.

My first time making baked macaroni and chesse. It was great. I improvised on the recipe by melting the egg, milk, cheese, and butter. Next time I make it I will try the layering technique that other memebers have tried. other than that I loved making it. It was quick and easy.

As a rule, when I rate a recipe poorly it is my own failure with the dish that I expose. This one is no different. It didn't work on any level. I mixed the milk (skim) w/ egg, but not having a lg. enough bowl, I placed the cheese in with the noodles, added the milk,eggs and butter mixture and tossed it like a salad! The resulting dish emerged from the oven looking like a champ but both my kids turned it away. I have to admit that I did, as well. My wife had two bowls. Go figure.

i did not like this recipe.  i have a recipe i use for mac and cheese on a regular basis but i wanted to try something different and liked the idea of not having to melt any type of cheese mixture prior to baking.  it didn't turn out well for me.

This was pretty good. I'm not sure how it will reheat though. Also, I think stirring it about 3/4 of the way through baking was key for me because if not it would have been really milky.

i was pleasantly surprised! my kids didn't like it (no shocker there!), but they only like the blue box garbage. i was a little pressed for time when i made it so it wasn't in the oven long enough (only about 25 min), but it was awesome! i was in a rut with taking cheesy potatoes to every picnic, but not anymore! this tasty mac & cheese is my new favorite! use any extras you like (bacon, ham, chicken even!), i'm sure it will work out. thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was pretty good, definitely comfort food. My hubby loved it Thought it probably could have used a little more flavouring though

It is a great fast and easy recipe, however I only gave it 4 stars because I feel like the recipe calls for just a bit more cheese. The next time I make this I am going to use an extra 1/2 a cup of cheese.

I liked it - way more than 3 servings, though.  I used 3 cups of sharp cheddar, and sprinkled parmesan on the top.  Really easy to make for a baked mac n cheese.

This is great. I've made this several times and always like it. I left out the butter last time and I couldn't tell the difference. I also use non-fat dry milk mixed up. I always reheat it in the oven on 350, covered. A forgiving recipe on the cooking time. I've forgotten about it for 15-20 minutes after I was supposed to get it out and have never thrown any out. Great recipe. Thanks.

Excellent recipe, tasty and very easy to prepare!  If you only have 10 minutes to prepare a meal, this is the one for you. Leftover Macaroni Cheese can be heated in the microwave, just sprinkle cheese on top to avoid drying out.

I was actually LOOKING for a mac and cheese recipe that wasn't very creamy.  This was absolutely delicious!!!  I mixed it halfway through and added breadcrumbs.  The texture was perfect for me:  crispy in some areas, and cheesy and a little creamy in others.  Much better than any boxed mac and cheese.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you!

I tried this last night. I thought it was OK. I froze one portion to see how well it would freeze. I can't say that the frozen version was any good but the refrigerated version was great for lunch today. I added some shredded parmesan on top. It is certainly easy to make and a good last-minute thing for dinner.

I tried this recipie tonight since everything on hand.  I took someone elses suggestion and used the packette of creamy velvetta in the Kraft Macaroni box.  It came out very watery, Maybe I didnt use enough shredded cheddar to make up for the velevetta.  Other than that it tasted pretty good.  Will try again with a few alterations.

This macaroni & cheese TASTED wonderful, but I have to admit, it was pretty dry.  I dislike the highly processed velveeta cheeses, so perhaps next time I would use a little more milk and a bit of colby cheese mixed with the cheddar, since it is a bit softer.  I would think that a condensed cheese soup could be a good alternative...  Also, I used a bit more cheese than the recipe called for and topped the whole thing off with bread crumbs (crushed potato chips would be darn good, too).  This is a good recipe to "start" from!

Quite bland. Will try again with a stronger cheddar, and maybe a fattier milk. 
I think maybe melting the cheese in a pot with the ingredients might work out better. 
I'll give this recipe one more try.

I thought it neede more cheese from reading the directions so I put in 3 1/2 - 4 cups of shredded cheese plus I added some velveeta and mixed that in. I also think that it was meant for a 3 quart caserole dish not a 2 quart. It turned out really good, very cheesy but I added a lot of cheese, I don't think it would have been near as good if I hadn't. I also thought it made quite a bit I may half the recipe next time.

We liked it enough that I will try it again using more of the creamy cheese like velveeta. Maybe it needs a bit of dijon mustard or something to give it some extra flavor.

Very easy and tasty. I had a 1 lb bag of elbow mac. so I used the whole bag. If you do this use a 2.5 or 3 qt. baking dish. I also only had 2 cups of shredded cheddar so I used 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesean. Sprinkled breadcrumbs on the top. It was very good. At first my 3 1/2 year old was complaining about it being "dirty" (breadcrumbs!) but once I reminded him that his options were to sit at the table and eat or wait in his room until bedtime he tried it, and said..."I really like this Mama, I'm sorry I didn't like it before". So it was an all around hit in our house. Thanks.

This recipe is great when you don't really feel like doing a lot of cooking, 
and the dish is even better when you use the creamy 
cheddar (like in the velvetta boxes) along with the shredded cheddar.

This is great mac & cheese -- I added a little more cheese (white cheddar in this case) since I'm crazy for cheddar.  My husband and I made this recipe as stated, and got two meals and two snacks each out of it.  If it's serious about 3-4 servings, those are HUGE servings!

I made this recipe twice- one time with cubed baked ham in it and another time with broccoli. They were both good, but I felt that without the ham, the recipe was a little too bland. I added Dijon mustard, which helped a bit, but I think I'd add more spices or something.

I used medium cheddar, which turned out to be much too strong.  The cheese also didn't melt enough in the amount of time given.  I was a little disappointed.

This is a great dish to let the kids make with a little supervision.  My 8 yr old had a great time making this lunch.

This was relatively simple which is why I chose to try it. I ended up going about 35 minutes. I also added enough shredded cheese to cover the top. The top still ended up dry, but once stirred was fine. I forgot to add salt, but it still tasted good. I did have sort of a wet bottom. But once stirred wasn't an issue. Maybe I'll try some of the other tips people mentioned. Will definitely make again.

I boiled the pasta just a little longer because it doesn’t cook fully in the oven. Other than that it was delicious.

I am a horrible cook. I just cook to live. This recipe was just up my alley . I like bake  Mac and cheese  so when I found this recipe i figured I would give it a try. T he only thing different that I did was right  before  I placed it in the oven I sprinkled  Panko crumbs on top to coat.I like a nice  crust on the mac and cheese. It turned out scrumptious . Very easy to make

I made this as written. My husband like it.  I thought it was just ok. I was looking for something that I could put in the oven with my meatloaf so this looked like it would work. Think I have to experiment a little more to get it to 5 stars.

After reading some of the reviews, I added more milk than recipe called for, and some extra cheese.  It STILL came out dry and shells on top were hard and crunchy.

Used GF pasta, 2 1/2 C sharp cheddar, 1/2 c mozzarella and an extra bit of Mexican blend, about another 1/2 c. Lots of black pepper and added cayenne as well. Next time, I’ll try hatch chili’s in the mix. Cooked 45-50 minutes before I got the edge/browning I wanted. Wonderful!

Made as written, I definitely ended up with a spotty cheese mix and little bits of scrambled egg in my macaroni. The only thing I did that wasn't written was I stirred it half-way through cooking to make sure the noodles didn't get hard on the top. Tasted okay, but I will not be making this particular recipe again.

My mom made a similar version.  She layered the macaroni and the cheese(lots of cheese) and sprinkled a little flour over the cheese. Seasoned with onion powder and added little  pats of butter.  Two layers each of macaroni and cheese. Pour milk over the top, just barely covering. Cover with foil and cook 20 minutes. Uncover, top with crushed bbq chips (adds sooo much pizazz!), and continue cooking until bubbly and browning.

I found the amount of milk written in the recipe was way to much for the amount of macaroni noodles in one box. I would recommend 1 cup of milk :)

The cheese that wasn't on the very top, sunk to the very bottom, and got over-cooked. So it ended up being crunchy on top, crunchy on the bottom, and just buttery pasta in the middle. If it was served to me like this at a restaurant, I defo would have sent it back. Flavor was ok, but texture failed miserably.

I made it exactly as stated except I did cover it during cooking and stirred it half-way through cooking. Then I read the reviews; so when it turned out horrible I tried tweaking it and I still couldn't save it. Don't waste your time with this recipe.

Made another version with apple wood smoked bacon and drippings (in place of butter) and added some chopped brocoli (slightly steamed).

A great recipe and one that you can add your own twist to. I had heavy cream I needed to use. I used 1 cup and 2 % milk . Sprinkle some Parmesan,Romano and Asiago blend in. I read one review that the macaroni got crusty and hard on top.  I stirred it while cooking to avoid it drying out.  Add bread crumbs on top if desired.

I just finished making this and it was not what i expected.  Im teaching myself how to cook using simplex recipes but this one was a bad one. The noodles at the top crusted over and i had to add a lot more cheese to it. I seasoned it correctly for what its worth... its helped my cooking abilities because at least i know now how to fix/save my dishes.  I recommend covering when you put it in the oven and add maybe another cup or two of cheese, i used a whole brick.

Comes out great! It was a hit with my party guests both times I've made it. I like making it with shell pasta. I did make a few modifications to make it not quite as dry, more cheesy, and flavorful. I use milk and half and half and use more of it than the recipe calls for to keep it form being dry and make it more creamy. I also add an egg or two. I use Velveeta original cheese and 1 extra bag of it than the recipe calls for. I add a little sugar and Tony Chachere's spice for a Creole flair. Enjoy!!

This tastes very much like the regular dinner mac and cheese my mother made as I was growing up. (Not to be confused with the Sunday Church Supper Mac & Cheese, which begins with a roux for the cheese sauce) I like that this one is a drier dish. I added 4 Tbsp butter and extra cheese, mainly because the family loves butter and cheese. This recipe is most definitely a keeper!

I made some changes as another reviewer suggested. Added 4 Tbl butter, 3 cups cheese (I had a block of American, also added some Colby and cheddar). I also added a pinch of nutmeg which I add whenever I bake mac and cheese or make homemade mashed potatoes. I learned this when I trained in a restaurant years ago. It adds just the extra touch. I also covered with foil and removed the last ten minutes. It was delicious!

I did not care for this recipe. The recipe as-is does not account for anywhere near enough cheese.  I increased it by a cup and it still wasn't enough.  

There were also so many strange decisions in the way the directions for this recipe were written.  Why put the macaroni in the dish, then the cheese mixture, and THEN mix it all together?  That was extremely difficult to do since this completely fills a 2 qt baking dish, and it made a mess.  Would've made much more sense to simply mix the ingredients in a large enough bowl to accommodate mixing.  In addition, the decision to leave the top uncovered without a layer of breading, cheese, or even foil made for a layer of dried out, hard pasta which was unappetizing.

I did not care for this recipe. 
the recipe looked pretty easy, and i really wanted something simple to make for dinner, so i went "why not try this?" 
i started to cook this exactly the way the instructions were given, and after the first 30 minutes, i drained some of the liquid out, as it was way too drippy, and tasted it to see if it would need anything. 
it was so bland that i had to add more and more cheese with less-than-advised amounts of salt and pepper. 
that didn't help much, so i tried adding some fresh parsley, which only contributed a touch of flavor. the green color of the parsley is really the only thing that was actually noticeable. 
i added more and more cheese every 5-10 minutes until eventually, after over an hour of cooking, i finally took it out and ate it. 
it was edible, and had more flavor than it would have had if i just left it for the first half hour. adding garlic salt helped, although i do regret not putting fresh garlic in the mixture.

Too bland for my family's taste.  Needs something sharper - maybe mustard or Worcestershire sauce.

I followed Gwen Swasnson's tweaks in her comment and I added a can of drained petite cut tomatoes just like my grandmother used to make and it tasted JUST like hers. We thought we lost the recipe but with this recipe, the extra cheese and melting it ahead of time, and the tomatoes it was amazing. This was also my first time cooking something from scratch, I usually bake from time to time, and it was a wonderful experience. ^_^

This was a hit with the whole family!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used 3.5 cups of cheese, and an extra 2 tablespoons of butter.  That may not have been necessary -- it ended up VERY cheesy, and a bit greasier than I would have liked.  As other reviewers mentioned, this is a bit more gloppy/curdy than creamy, but since this doesn't involve a sauce, it's to be expected.  This would be very quick and easy if I had used pre-shredded cheese, but I had an assortment of cheeses to use up, so that's what I used, and it was great.  Very versatile!  Definitely cook it covered for the first 15-20 minutes, then top with breadcrumbs and leave uncovered for the remaining time!  So good!

As far as Baked Mac and Cheese goes, this was not a winner for me. I added a bit more cheese, lessened the milk  and covered it for the first half of baking. None of that seemed to improve the recipe beyond mediocre and bland. Wouldn't try making again.

This is exactly what I was looking for. The egg gives it that extra umph. I would recommend when you are mixing all your ingredients, leave the egg for last so that you can taste if you have enough salt. "salt to taste" can be difficult for beginners. I used garlic salt and it was the best Mac and cheese I've made, like on a grandma type level good.

Tips:  Stir half way through to keep the macaroni moist (I did not cover with aluminum foil).  I added about a tablespoon of garlic powder and about a teaspoon of ground white pepper.  I also used the "healthier" Dreamfields macaroni noodles.  It was delish!  We all went back for seconds!  Very easy!  Will make again!

I made this for a BBQ everyone loved it. I used Colby Jack instead of cheddar, baked it for 30 mins and then sprinkled more cheese on top and put it back in the oven for another 2-3 mins just to melt the cheese on top. I had none left to bring home! It was simply delicious!

We loved it! I used rigatoni noodles and did half cheddar cheese and half mozzarella cheese. I multiplied the whole recipe by 4 and it fit perfectly into 5 8x8 pans. We ate one tonight and are freezing the rest! Definitely a win with the hubby and 2yr old!

What a great recipe! This was amazingly yummy! I did follow a reviewer's suggestion about adding more cheese and butter. In addition I also followed her advice with regard to the bread crumb only I used Panko bread crumb. I broiled this Mac and cheese dish for 5 minutes before I removed it from the oven. My family loved this and it was pretty delish! I can see myself making this again and again! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was a great side idea for my meal, I would suggest covering it tho, my top layer of noodles became hard but after i mixed it around and let i cook for a few more minutes it was all fine, i did also cover the top for the last 10 minutes with extra cheese as my father loves cheese and he was very satisfied, thank you for the recipe, it was delicious .

I decided on this recipe over others because it had a lot of room for changes. I first heated the butter separate from the milk and egg mix. I also added grated Mexican mix cheese over plain mild cheddar. I used a fork to fold the cheese into the noodles and egg mixture. Then added grated Parmesan cheese on top, then folded that into too. Then I folded in a teaspoon of salt and pepper and garlic powder. Topped off with more cheese and a pinch of salt, it came out perfectly. The recipe is great to be able to do what you want and make as many changes as you want!

My go-to recipe for Mac n cheese. Super easy. I like to substitute different cheeses. I've used beer cheese and pepper jacks, for example, as well as different types of cheddars. All great every time. I like a lot of cheese, so I use about 3 cups. It turns out, the key factor is to remember the salt and pepper. whenever I forget, I always regret it and wind up reminding people to add it to their serving.

Delicious! I added diced ham to it and used a 16 oz. serving of Penne Rigate noodles instead of Elbows and it came out great! My husband and 3 sons liked it as well.  We will definitely be having this again.

First time I made it, I just put the milk over the macaroni and then the cheese and it was excellent. But the second time I made it exactly as written and it was rubbery.

I wanted something cheesy to serve with ham steak tonight, and this recipe suited very well.  I halved the recipe for just the two of us, except kept the whole egg, and more than half of the cheese, and added 3/4  cup frozen broccoli (defrosted).  I also followed the suggestion of covering for the first 20 min, then uncovered to finish.  We liked the crunch on top.  Thanks for posting.

I boiled the noodles a tad more ( like 10 minutes). I then mixed the eggs with the milk cold and put it in the fridge while I did the rest. I put 2 cups 'I can't believe it's not butter' in the microwave long enough for the yellow and clear to separate (pouring the yellow part and only like half of the clear part) and put a thin layer of warm noodles in the bottom and proceeded with the cheese ( I measured out aprox. 3 1/2 c. of cheese, because the more the better!) I put a hefty layer of chedar topped with a bit of ricotta smooched apart with my fingers into little blobs evenly spread. Continuing with the cheese I crumbled feta very finely evenly across, all topped with probably like a 1/4 c. of pizza blend shredded cheese evenly. I repeated the process of noodles and cheese again and added the rest of the pasta and the remaining cheddar. Into the oven for about 50 mins. After i took it out I had to paper towel the hell out of it to soak up at the grease, but I let it sit for like 10 minutes after that and put it in the broiler for about one minute. And it's perfect! Cheesey and creamy and delicious! The added cheese eliminated the need for salt and pepper.

Made this for super bowl party and it came out good! I followed some changes others suggested in their comments, which made it better. One thing is it didn't feel cheesy enough. Mainly just tasted the noodles and not so much the cheese. Was told to try using Velveeta next time so maybe I will!

I used 1/3 of a generic velvetta block if you know what I mean. I melted it over stove in the wet mixture and added it to macaroni. Additional salt not necessary before baking, it is a little wet, I would say it is creamy but firmed up as it cooled. I liked it, hubby said it's ok. I baked it in an 8x8 square pan

It wasn't creamy at all- the cheese looked congealed. I think maybe adding an egg was the culprit, but will not make this again.

I made this, with a few changes: I added some leftover fully cooked cubed ham and some frozen broccoli. I used extra cheese and the powdered cheese from a box of Kraft mac & cheese. I layered the pasta, ham, broccoli and egg/milk/cheese mixture. Baked for 30 min covered, stirred it and baked for 10 more min uncovered.

I made this except I made some modifications. I used shells instead of elbow I also added extra cheese I used sharp mild, and coldby cheese topped it with bread crumbs. My family loved it.

This is a really good recipe! The only changes I made were that I   beat the egg separately,  poured the milk in the saucepan FIRST, then added the butter, cheese and the egg. Poured the mixture in the pot with the macaroni and mixed it up then poured it all in the pan and sprinkled more cheese on top. I forgot to grease the pan first though, so I had to take it out the pan, grease it, throw it back in and put more cheese on top. It still came out good though!

While this was my first time making Mac & Cheese,  it was a hit with my son. I warmed up the milk, melted the butter, & I  used  3 cups Colby shredded cheese instead.

I made this to take to Christmas potluck and it was so bad I didn't take it with me. It was bland and not nearly enough cheese (and I put in 3 cups). It also didn't warm all the way through but I'll say that was my oven. My mom even tried it and said not to take it. I'm really glad I made sweet corn cake along with this or I would have had to take something bought at the store.

I did modify this recipe. I added two more tbsp of butter. I added accent flavor enhancer, lawry's seasoned salt, and pepper. I used two cups of cheese with the milk, butter, and egg mixture (added the seasonings in this mixture).  I put the cooked macaroni in a large bowl, then poured the mixture into the bowl. I mixed everything together, then poured the macaroni into the baking dish. I then sprinkled more cheese on top. I covered it for 20 minutes with aluminum foil. For the last 20 minutes, I uncovered it.It was done in 40 minutes and It came out delicious!

I did not grow up eating mac 'n cheese, so I guess that's why I never made it for my 3 children. However, after having some at my daughter's house I craved it! This recipe was the best! Easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  I used half and half and milk to make 2 cups. (It was left over from T'Day.)  I also added butter to prepared Italian crumbs and put them on top. My husband said he could have eaten the entire casserole!  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Super quick and easy!  I added a half cup of Franks Red Hot and topped it with panko crumbs. I usually make a roux but this skips all of that and its quick and easy.

I'd make this again with just a few changes: Adding two more tablespoons butter,  and I drained the noodles and put all the ingredients with 2 tablespoons of flour on top the stove to warm up and mix  before putting in the casserole in the oven.  Would cover foray least  40 minutes then put under broiler to brown. Liked the crunchy crust I got on the bottom and sides and the custardy middle.

In the end, the top layer of pasta never fully cooked in the baking process, leaving a crunchy cover over the rest of it. Under that, the cheese didn't come out creamy or particularly cheesy.

I liked it, but I would use less butter next time.  My husband calls it "a good mac-and-cheese."  Our 3-year-old did not like any of the macaroni that were crunchy, though, only the soft pieces from the bottom.  I thought the flavor was good, but I did use two different types of cheese, and I did not hold back on adding salt.  It's not the prettiest mac-and-cheese, so I would not make it to serve guests.  It was finished @ 30 minutes.

My boys love this and it is super duper easy.  I melt the ingredients on the stove top, then mix the pasta in, then bake.  It is a good one to prepare the day before and then just pop in the oven for the bake time.

After reading all reviews, this is what I did! 12 oz pasta( I used 1 gall water to 3/4 cup salt. This is your only chance!! Cook halfway. You have to pay attention and give some love and time!! I put in saucepan 3/4 cream  1 1/4 whole milk and 2 cups cheddar 1/4 parm  1/4 gruyere and 4 tbl butter. Also salt and pepper and a  touch nutmeg. ( you will season again)!! Everybody in the pot!! Pour into 9/13 buttered vessel. Bake at 350 for 30 mins. I stirred and tasted at 15 mins. Bland!! Seasoned and stirred and put back in the oven .After the 15 min took out, stirred, tasted. Bland!!! Seasoned again and added mozzarella about 1/4 cup stirred again. Evened,added a good 1/3 cup of bread crumbs and grated parm. Turned oven to broil and took about 10 mins. It should've been sorta bubbling and sticky before the broil process.Turned out really good. Suggestions taste every step . Needs more salt and 1/4 more cup of milk and follow these instructions and will turn out really well! Watch it, work with it. Add whatever you like. Oops, forgot , cover until broil process!!

We added more cheese and should of taken it out 5 mins earlier because the noodles on the top became hard. Overall though it was a delicious meal.

I use rotini and layer the pasta and cheese like you would for a lasagna. The egg mix I whisk in some dijon mustard add basil, oregano, and fresh garlic (that I lightly heat in olive oil). Pour the mix over the top of the pasta and cheese and then sprinkle smoked paprika on top and into the oven it goes..

If you're looking for a straightforward, fast recipe, you've found it!  I was preparing lunch for a play date and didn't want to do a two-step recipe with a cooked cheese sauce AND cooked noodles AND then the baking step, and this one went in the oven in about 15 minutes flat.  The only thing I would say is that the portions listed are WAY GENEROUS.  Because the original recipe says it makes 3-4 servings I doubled it for my group.  I ended up with a 13x9 pan AND a square pan filled to the brim!  I've now been eating leftover mac and cheese for 4 days... good thing it's tasty!

I used the recipe as a starting point. I doubled the macaroni and used three cups of shredded cheddar and two cups of a mozzarella/parmesan mix. That adds a lot more flavor to it. I also did it like other suggested and went layer by layer but also did the cheese separate from the egg/milk/butter mix.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was yummy!  I did add an extra half a cup of cheese and I also added 2 tbsp of Epicure Nacho Cheese Dip seasoning and topped with Presidents Choice garlic butter croutons.  Very good and I will make again with the additions I put in.  Even my VERY picky 11 year old ate it.

I've tried this recipe a few times and put my own spin on it.  I've added lobster (meat from two lobsters) and sour cream (a dollop) to this recipe; and I used garlic butter, as opposed to, plain butter and it turned out absolutely delicious.

Wow  , great recipe , my family loved it. But i substituted the milk with heavy whipping cream , and i used velvita cheese and cheddar shredded cheese , i melted the velveta chesse on the stove with little milk and i didn't melt the shredded ,i stirred it occasionally in the oven and it cooked for 50 minutes it was delicious , creamy and very cheesy . Love it

This is a very good and basis recipe. Only thing I do different is add a crunchy topping of crunched up French's fried onions and crackers mixed with melted butter!

It was ok. My kids loved it but hubby and I thought that it could have used lots more cheese and I already used more than what it called for. I did use skim milk and whole wheat pasta if that makes a diff. My husband doesn't really care for mac and cheese anyway though, it was the first time in over a year since we had any.

Not the best. I think it would have been better with less milk and some sour cream. Followed ingredients and directions.

When I read the reviews before I made it I noticed the "curdled cheese" comments and thought that was a fluke. I can't describe it any other way except that the cheese seemed curdled. I'm sure that's not the right word for it and I don't know how it happened. Some of us had a curdled cheese thing happening when it came out of the oven. That's obviously not the case with everyone though.

The recipe was yummy and very easy to make! The only thing I would change next time is to put foil over the top while it's baking. The macaroni's on the top layer were hard.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Never made mac&cheese before. Not at all creamy. The cheese was curdled and it had a watery goo on the bottom of the pan. Yuck.

This was a good recipe, although it was a bit chunky.  I also did not add the cheese to the milk mixture and layered the macaroni and the cheese in my pan and poured the milk mixture over.  I also used half colby jack and half taco blend cheese and minced garlic to give it some zip.  I'll probably make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time for a gathering of friends. I was dissapointed in the way it turned out. The cheese didn't melt completely;was curdy. Very dry on top. Next time I will use a processed cheese & cover it while baking.

I follwed the other reviews of adding a package of soup mix and even added 6 cups of cheese and this came out not really cheesy.  I would make again but would try adding perhaps cheddar cheese soup in the mix.

Just what the doctor ordered.  I was looking for a simple and yet delicious recipe, and found just what I wanted.  Will make many times over.  Made enough for a couple of days.  Yummmmy!  More cheese can be added if desired, also put some cayenne pepper for good Southern kick.  Love it.

All I did different was add cheese to the top as well as added some crushed garlic croutons to the top about 5 minutes before it was done. 

When it was done, it was still liquidy on the inside and I was not pleased with that. I cooked it for a bit longer and got a better result.

This came out extremely clumpy for it. It didn't have a bad flavor, but I wasn't impressed. I probably won't make this again, I was definitely looking for something much creamier in texture.

This was very easy to make, however it needs flavor/spices. On the top I lightly sprinkled bread crumbs, pepper, salt, paprika,  onion powder and garlic powder. It tasted good, but next time I would add more along with cayenne pepper. Also, note the inside will be very bland so that will need some spicing as well. For that fix, I just added salt and it was acceptable.

I had intended to make this with cheddar cheese, but I was out, so instead I made it with mozzarella, provolone and parmesan.  I also stirred in a couple of sliced veggie hotdogs before I put it in the oven.  It came out really well.

Really good. Had to add close to a cup more cheese and this took closer to 50 minutes to cook all the way through. Love the simplcity of this. I thought is was little bland,but I would try this again adding a few more seasonings.

Easy recipe.  I added Parmesan and Romano on top as well as seasoned salt and covered the dish with foil to keep the pasta from drying out.  Very yummy.  I might try using heavy cream instead of milk next time.  But great, nonetheless.

I made this for a special dinner for my grandparents. It was a really good throw-together dish that tasted wonderful. I also added a good amount more cheese.

I made mines with low fat milk and that's more than likely the reason that it didn't come out creamy, but I don't know how much it would have helped if you use anything less than whole milk?

I loved this recipe and so did my 10 month old son.  My husband isnt too into mac & cheese but still ate it.  The only change I made was i added more sharp cheddar cheese on top and some garlic salt also.  Great recipe!

This is a good starter recipe.  Unlike some other reviewers, my fiance and I thought it was very creamy.  Of course, this is probaly because I ran out of milk and had to replace it with half cream, half water.  Next time, I'll add breadcrumbs and some seasonings to spice it up, but we thought this was a good basic recipe.

Well, this was a simple recipe but lacked flavor, as was mentioned in earlier reviews. I even used Mexican cheese blend, added a packet of Alfredo sauce and a little extra milk and cheese, but to no avail. My kids thought it was ok and ate it just fine but I probably won't try it again unless I had some sharp cheddar. It was worth the try though because of how easy it was.

I too expected a creamier cheese sauce instead of a clumpy one.  I used a white cheddar and only 2 cups of it so I do not know if that it what made the difference.  Also, it took much longer to cook b/c the milk was still watery.  At first I thought that I misread the recipe and that I had inadvertantly added too much.  All in all, a good stepping stone but I will try a different recipe next time.

I used old cheddar for this and found it lacking cheesiness. Also, I was expecting it to be a lot creamier. Really liked it the second day!

This recipe is o.k.. I was quite disappointed because it didn't turn out like I had hoped. I have been searching for a mac and cheese recipe that is creamy and that has ALOT of cheese flavor. I still have yet to find that recipe. This mac and cheese turned out quite dry and the cheese didn't melt properly , it was sort of clumpy.

Very yummy!  If you have to grate the cheese yourself though, this recipe can take a little more time.  Next time I think I'll buy the cheese already grated!  Otherwise this recipe is awesome!  Very tasty and simple!

This recipe was quick and easy, but way too 
much cheddar to it, family didn't like so
much the taste of the cheddar.  For something
quick and easy though, this is a good recipe.

This was good but a little too liquidy.  Pretty easy to make as long as the cheese is already shredded.
