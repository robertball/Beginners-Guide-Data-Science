It is delicious, but when I used the above measures it was a bit soupy. I think if you baked it with MUCH less water, and decrease the sour cream to 1/2 cup it may work out better. Going to reheat it tomorrow for Thanksgiving so hopefully it will firm up a bit. Thanks!

The sour cream really works with this recipe.  I steamed my squash instead, skipped the cinnamon and instead added small amounts of thyme, curry powder and ginger.  I also doubled the brown sugar.  Divine.

The baking time was too long by the time I decided to cook this for dinner so I placed the seeded halves face down in a microwave safe baking dish and cooked it on high for 10 minutes, then transferred the dish to the preheated oven for 30 minutes.  I mashed the squash only with a fork and then drained the excess liquid.  To that I added the sour cream, cinnamon, butter, S&P and mixed.  This eliminated the problem others have mentioned.  I did omit the brown sugar because I wanted a savory dish, not sweet.  I have to admit I was skeptical about adding the sour cream but it does work.

I had already steamed my squash yesterday and had about half left over. I used plain Yogurt instead of sour cream, which I cut down the amount on slightly...added til I was satisfied like another reviewer recommended.  Also it doesnt need there sugar if you don't want it. Delicious without. Oh and I also cut down the amount of butter I used. Just to make it healthier overall. Good recipe - thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a hit with my family even the ones that are not a fan of butternut squash the only thing I did different is I added 1/4 cup sour cream instead of the 3/4 cups and roughly added 1/4 cup heavy cream other than that  this was amazing perfect amount of sugar and cinnamon thank you for a recipe that will be made more times than just Thanksgiving and christmas

Start real slow with the sour cream - I ruined mine right off the bat.  Soupy and white.

It was good, but I think it would be better without the cinnamon...probably nix that the next time and may experiment with some rosemary and thyme.

I used greek yogurt instead of sour crea, and I can't believe it's not butter  instead of real butter and trivia brown sugar instead of real brown sugar. And  did not cook it with water in it so all the vitamins would not cook out.

I used one Butternut and one Buttercup squash. I didn't use any water and but did increase the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I baked in the oven in a covered casserole dish for 1 hour before serving. It was a side at our Christmas dinner.
It was a big hit.

I altered recipe. I  did not use listed ingredients. Instead I added chopped onions browned in butter and a couple of shakes of nutmeg to the mashed squash. People loved it.
