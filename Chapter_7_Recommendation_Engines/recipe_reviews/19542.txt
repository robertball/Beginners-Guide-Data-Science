This recipe has become a staple of my Thanksgiving menu since finding it a couple of years ago. Something that might help with the "runny" issue that some have commented on is making sure that your squash is well drained. I cut my squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and then slice into chunks. Those pieces are then cooked according to the directions and drained in a colander with a plate or bowl on top to press out excess moisture. The core of the squash tends to hold a lot of water and, in my opinion, the seeds have a bitter taste. Also, adding a beaten egg to the sour cream/soup mixture helps the whole dish to set up. Instead of putting melted butter into the dish, I save it for drizzling over the Italian dressing seasoning (that I mix with about a half cup of Italian breadcrumbs). This combo makes a nicely browned, crusty topping that is a nice contrast to the creaminess of the rest of the dish. I've also been known to use sauteed bell peppers (any color) if I'm out of pimentoes.

The problem with it being too runny as some of the reviewers stated, is because it was boiled, which also takes away some of the flavor. Even when I fix squash, I put it and chopped onions in a little butter that I've melted in the skillet, put a lid on it and let it steam until almost done, I then remove the lid and let it cook until the water evaporates. You never should add water to squash, because as it steams, it makes it's own water.Also to add water, makes it mushy and takes away from the flavor. Vegetarians can add cr of mushroom, celery, or a cream soup of their choice. I also try to avoid packaged mixes with MSG, or preservatives and add my own spices. Hope this helps.          Paula P.

A healthy variant of this recipe has become a Thanksgiving tradition in my family. I usually substitute low fat sour cream, Health Request cream of chicken, low fat butter, and half fat cheddar cheese (I use Cabot brand from Sam's Club). Great taste without the coronary! 

I also buy matchstick carrots to save some time and often throw in other veggies or ingredients on hand. In the past, I've added mushrooms, red bell pepper (instead of pimento), fresh basil, and even blue cheese (leaving out some of the cheddar). As for the problems people mention with it being too runny, I've never had that problem. I always cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe states (I live at 4500 ft.) so maybe that's why it sets up better. Otherwise, I suggest adding a bit more sour cream or cheese. I suppose you could also add more cream of chicken but I don't love condensed soup mixes. Enjoy!

The flavor was pretty good but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very runny even after letting it have time to set.

Great recipe! I substituted half of the yellow squash with zuchinni and topped with mozzarella. My dad (huge food critic) loved it.

Sounds delish, much like my mother's recipe that I have used for years.  For those of you saying that is too runny, you might try "pepperidge farm" herb flavored stuffing.  Mix about 2 cups with some melted butter and spread on the bottom of dish followed by a final layer of the same on top of the squash mixture and a layer of your favorite shredded cheese on top of all before baking.  Almost a complete meal  by itself!  I usually have this as a side for pork chops.  YUM  Ms'  Porky Pig

I made this for a dinner for a crowd and we all loved it.  I left off the salad dressing mix because I didn't have any, so I sprinkled about 10 crumbled whole wheat crackers on top instead.   I also sauteed the squash and onions in the butter instead of boiling it.  I had no idea what was meant by a "medium baking dish", but I used a 9 X 12, and it worked out fine.  Awesome recipe!

This casserole was delicious!!!   I will definately make it again.  My whole family loved it and wanted to know how to make it. 
Maybe it could be make thicker by boiling the squash for a shorter period of time.

this was a great recipe until the italian seasoning on top! it was just too much. otherwise the flavor was great. i did cut my squash lengthwise and scoop out seeds prior to cooking, increased the cheese, and mixed the italian seasoning with panko for a crunchy topping. next time i will omit the salt. i think another part of my problem was the dish i used. the recipe doesn't specify what size dish and judging by the amount of casserole i had, i used a 8x8. i think a 9x13 would've been better and maybe the topping wouldn't have seemed so strong. but i will be trying it again!

squash has enough water in it, no need to add more. Adding water makes squash soupy.

Tasty recipe!  I substituted green chiles for the pimento peppers and added a bit of garlic powder to the mix.  I also used about half the amount sour cream.  Did not use the italian seasoning because we didn't have any on hand.  Turned out pretty good!

Tasty! I am testing out Thanksgiving side dishes and I can see using this for sure. It's VERY filling, by the way, so you only need a small serving. I only found a butternut squash that was 3lbs but I thought that amount worked well. I took the advice of other reviewers and steamed the squash with the onion and I didn't find it to be too runny at all. I used half the sour cream and butter - tasted great!

This squash casserole was wonderful!  I did alter it a little bit though.  Instead of bread stuffing, I used a box of corn bread stuffing mix.  I also used 1/4cup butter and 8oz sour cream, omitting the water.  Since I am the only one that will eat this, I shared half of it with my next door neighbors.  They loved it too!

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any sour cream.  It was fabulous and there were no leftovers!

The second time I made the recipe I used sour cream and the dish was just okay, the leftovers went to waste.

I recommend leaving out the sour cream, carrots, pimentos, and the italian style salad dressing mix.  You can also use zucchini in the recipe and it turns out just as good.

Two things:
1 - as others hve mentioned get rid of some of the liquid.
2 - Add Uncle Ben's cornbread stuffing on top of it - it absorbs of of he juiciness and adds a wonderful flavor to it.

Deserves five stars but I did alter recipe.  I didn't use Cream of Chicken soup because I don't like it.  I used Cream of Celery soup in lieu of the chicken.  It was excellent.  If I were forced to make a negative comment it would be that it had a lot of liquid.  But the taste more than made up for it.  Going to make it again today but will squeeze the squash after it's cooked.

it is much more like a yummy soup but it was also a little too sweet for me and I added black olives to cut it a little and added more black pepper.

We loved it!  My sister is on a very healthy diet. With that being said there was so much additional creaminess to this dish the next time I prepare it for her I am going to add her frig full of lovely veggies such as maybe half a red, and yellow pepper, zucchini and yellow squash,a little spinach, and whatever else I need to use.  I do not want to alter the recipe to a great extent, because, it was terrific as is.

Taste is good, but texture is not great. Too soupy and mushy. Could have used some more crunch and density.

We went for a low-carb Thanksgiving this last year.  This was one of several dishes used to replace the traditional stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc.  The family was absolutely amazed at how satisfying this wonderfully savory (and healthy) dish was.  I blinked at it was gone.  Have made it several times since, with the same results.

I would add a lot more squash next time.  If slice squash thinly only need to boil it for a few minutes.
