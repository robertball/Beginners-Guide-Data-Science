I'm not usually one for using marinades; but this one sounded interesting, so I tried it tonight.  It was amazing! I didn't have any flank steak on hand, so I substituted skirt steaks, which are usually a fairly chewy cut.  After marinating for just 2 hours you could practically cut them with a fork. I served them to company, and everyone raved.  The blend of flavors was excellent, with just a hint of sweet, and a little tang of lemon to offset it. One word of caution: this makes ALOT of marinade.  I served four, and could have cut the recipe in half.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe sounded like it was going to be amazing, but when I tried it, it was only okay. I think that this marinade would be paired better with pork. It had a tangy flavor but it wasn't strong enough for this type of meat. Someone above mentioned that there wasn't enough depth of flavor and too much acid and I completely agree.

I love Port wine and Flank steaks so i thought i found the perfect match. Unfortunetly the recipe was just ok. I did find it odd that no salt or pepper was listed in the ingredients but tried it anyway. It was tangy but just didnt do it for me. Perhaps the issue was too much acids and not enough depth of flavor.

I loved this marinade with flank steak.  The flavor of the port wine really came through which is a good thing for me.  I have other recipes using port wine with beef that I really love.  The citrus juices tenderized the meat nicely which is important for this cut.  You can easily scale in half since it makes way more than you'll need.  For a very decadent treat, try topping it with a blue cheese/butter/chive mixture after it comes off the grill.  Very nice!

The marinade sounded interesting enough.  However, my husband found it to be too sweet for flank steak.  It was okay but not something I would likely make again.
