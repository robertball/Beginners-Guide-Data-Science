I don't understand why there are so many people giving this recipe a bad rating. True, the batter mix was wet, but what really matters is the end product, and my gosh, it was good! I discovered this recipe a few months ago, when I decided to venture into the world of baking. This was literally the third recipe I tried, and so I thought I'd follow it to the letter. I've since tried this at least half a dozen times, and only stopped cause blueberries are no longer in season here! I plop spoon sized clumps of these onto a baking sheet, and when they cook, it turns into this really soft and delicious. I happen to like my breads/pastries not too sweet, and with these, I actually taste the blueberries, not the sugar in the dough. Very highly recommended. As with other reviewers, I've successfully tried this recipe with other ingredients - choc chip, cheese bits, corn, raisins... but blueberry still rules!

Excellent recipe! I did substitute 1/2 c. plain yogurt for the 3/4 cream to lower fat and make the dough more managable. Tip: USE FROZEN BLUEBERRIES! When kneading, it will make it much easier and they aren't as prone to pop as fresh. Instead of shaping it into a round, I shaped it into a 16L x 4W x 3/4H rectangle, squared up the edges, cut it into 4 squares, and cut each square diagonally to get a more traditional scone shape. I sprinkled coarse sugar on top before putting them in the oven. They're best eaten within 24 hours of baking. I made them one night to take into the office the following morning. Rave reviews!

These scones are very delicious. The only problem with the recipe is that the amount of flour should be increased until the dough is comfortable to work with, but not dry. The dough does not really need to be kneaded, just mixed well with the rubber spatula then shaped and cut.

These were easy to make and so delicious!  I made the following changes based on other reviews:  added an extra 1/4 cup flour and also rolled the blueberries in flour.  Added 1/4 c white sugar , 1 tsp vanilla, and sprinkled sugar on top of the scones.  I also used cream instead of half & half.  I shaped them into 4" squares and cut diagonally for triangles.  I baked some right away and froze half to bake later (thawed for only a few minutes, then baked as per recipe).  Delicious both ways!!  This recipe is a keeper.

I have not made this recipe, but it is somewhat similar to a Blueberry Scone recipe I already make.  Some reviewers have complained about the dough being too soft.  I think the problem is the amount of liquid, the recipe I have and most others usually call for 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup liquid with similar amount of dry ingredients.  It is never a good idea to tinker with the amount of flour as that messes up the ratio of flour to baking powder (leavening ingredient), so it is better to cut back on the amount of liquid.  I also add a dash or two of cream of tartar to the dry ingredients and about 3/4 tsp. vanilla extract to the egg mixture.  Also, it is easier to scoop out half of the dough on a floured surface and knead it, then do the other half of the dough.  Then you can blend both doughs together.  I usually pat the dough to about 1-1/4 inch thickness.  Before baking scones I brush some cream or milk on top and then lightly sprinkle with some white sugar.  Scones are a Scottish/English biscuit.  It is a cross between a muffin and a biscuit in texture, moist but crumbly.  It is unfortunate that a couple of the reviews the reviewers came across as mean spirited, I've found over the years, that the people that complain about recipes are usually the ones that are not very good cooks to begin with.  :-)

Yippee Yahooie!  Loved this recipe - goes together quickly, and produces great results.  I added a little lemon zest, and sprinkled them with sugar before baking, came out great.  Scones are by nature a goopy batter, if you look at the ratio of dry ingredients to wet.  Instead of dividing onto 2 balls (impossible) and then cutting into wedges (as most scone recipes call for) I always make "drop-scones", like drop biscuits, and plop heaping spoonfulls onto a greased & floured regular cookie sheet.  They bake in the same amount of time, you don't have to worry about the centers of the bog rounds still being raw while the edges overcook, and you don't have to get your hands into the goopy batter.  This recipe worked great even at 6000' altitude here in New Mexico.  I intend to try this recipe with other fillings, too - cinnamon walnut(ooh, with a streusel topping maybe!), cranberry lemon, rosemary parmesan, and whatever other berries i can get my hands on.  Highly recommended recipe!

These are not scones in any sense of the word. Obviously those who gave it positive reviews have never seen nor tasted a scone before. First off as another reviewer pointed out you cannot cut the dough for it's too mushy and sloppy to cut. I even added a cup more of flour and still it was un-cuttable! I needed to add a half cup more sugar to taste any sweetness at all and I don't even have a sweet tooth! Because of the sloppy, mushy dough all I could do was plop the batter in splumks on the baking sheet which needs to be greasewd by the way contrary to what the recipe submitter states. They came out looking like extremely puffed cookies and tasted below ok. This is a recipe for bread, not scones. Very poor recipe indeed!

I did not care for this. The dough (I use that term lightly) was a sticky, mess with little to no flavor. I had to add almost twice the flour in order to form an actual dough. I added sugar, too, to make up for the lack of flavor. This recipe is great if you enjoy making messes, but if you enjoy cooking (or scones) I'd look for a different recipe.

Linda, this is an awesome recipe.  Clearly, many of the reviewers don't know what a proper scone should taste like.  The texture is absolutely perfect and the flavor wonderful.

A great recipe for my first time making scones.  The blueberry was delicious but the real charm about this one is it allows you to experiment with all differnt types of ingedients using the same basic recipe.  A+

Super yummy!  My daughter (20 months) absolutely loves this.  I used milk instead of half and half, frozen blueberries (will try fresh when they are in season), as well as brushed the tops with milk and sprinkled with a bit of granulated sugar; and they came out great!  I like the idea of using brown sugar.  It gives it a whole new depth.  This one's a keeper.

these scones were way to mushy and sticky. I could not knead these at all and just plopped them on the cookie sheet. I thought I did something wrong with the recipe but I did not. would not probably make these again

So good! I accidentally forgot the berries till late in the mixing process so they got a bit crushed thus the entire dough was blue... I can't begin to count the number of people who asked me for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time, I substituted 1.5 apples and1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon for the blueberries.  I added the apple/cinnamon mixture just before shaping the dough.  The apple scones are the best, while the blueberry scones are tart.  I would recommend making this recipe with apples. I make these almost every weekend.

I was lucky to find such a easy and scrumptious recipe for the first time making scones!  I also replaced half & half with skim milk and even cut the butter in half.  Nevertheless, the scones still turned out delicious and friends were craving for more!  A big hit!

Excellent scones! The batter was a little on the sticky side, so I dropped them in mounds onto the cookie sheet.  I used fat free half-and-half and a little more sugar than called for - it turned out fantastic!

Great recipe!  I made a "coco-almond" variation by omitting the blueberries, adding a little shredded coconut and sliced almonds, and substituing coconut cream (+ a dash of half and half and a 1/2 tsp vanilla) for the half and half...then I brushed the tops with beaten eggs and sprinkled with brown sugar, coconut and almonds...  =)  Tender and tasty!

I made this recipe, I do this stuff all the time, but this did not work for me. I tried to dress them up, butter, honey, etc, but they were unedable. The mess they made was a lot, too, sticky. I cannot believe I did something wrong, I bake almost everyday. I could not knead them, too sticky, but that wasn't it.

This recipe is great, especially if you use fresh blueberries! But caution: don't leve the scones out in the summer heat (blueberry seaon peak is in the middle of summer).

I used skim milk instead of half and half as well as white sugar instead of brown sugar.  I would also add a bit more sugar next time.  This recipe was easy to use and the scones tasted great even with the changes.

I love scones, only made a few recipes for it over the years. SO not much in the way of an expert. Having said that, most people if they've never made or tasted a scone, it's an English verison of a biscuit and can be dense. I love love scones, they are very versatile like this recipe, and this recipe is really really good. I made these 3x already in a week. The 1st two times I made them I used frozen blueberries because my store didn't have fresh. And they were delish. However, they were very purple because no matter how much you rinse or don't rinse, the blueberries dye everything in it's path. The last batch I used the fresh, and they looked soo gorgeous, but the fresh berries were extremely tart and wowziers did that give us pucker power ;-) You totally need a glaze to cut out the bitter of fresh blueberries. But this recipe is very easy to do and very quick to put together. I highly recommend this recipe, especially to those that love scones ;-)

These definitely need more sugar unless you are going to add preserves. The dough is super sticky, but it bakes up just fine. I would suggest using frozen blueberries.

Great texture and taste.  This is a wonderful recipe as written.  We did add a few drops of lemon oil flavoring as we like that with anything with blueberries.

I followed others' advice and added more sugar and a little vanila.  I also had to use evaporated milk instead of the half-and-half cream and frozen instead of fresh blueberries.  The dough was very sticky and I ended up making 10 "mounds" that looked like drop-biscuits.  The end result, however was very tasty.

While these tasted alright they were a gooey mess to make.  I added almost a cup more flour and still had to just plop them onto a cookie sheet.  Maybe it was not using the cream that did it-I had to use 2% milk.  I wouldn't buy cream just for scones so I probably will look for a different recipe that I can shape and cut

Wonderfully light with great flavor and texture.  I topped them off with a little granulated sugar before baking.

I made these yesterday and they came out great. I have been looking for a recipe as close to a blueberry scone as I possibly could find, and this is pretty darn close. Right before I found this recipe, I did see a video about baking techniques for scones, which I think made all the difference. So I believe that it's all in the technique. First, I used a whisk to mix up the dry ingredients well. When I added my fresh blueberries, I used my hands, because you don't want the blueberries to burst or get squished while your mixing. Then, when I added my wet mixture to my dry mixture/blueberries, I used my hands again (I didn't have a rubber spatula).  Just a slight folding motion until everything was wet. This way, I wasn't over-working it. The batter came out STICKY, but manageable with some flour-covered hands. I made the two small loaves and cut them into triangles. Baked them as so....they were super. I did think, however, that there wasn't enough sugar, because they are not at all sweet, but I think authentic scones aren't supposed to be super sweet. In future attempts I will think about adding maybe 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract to make the blueberry flavor pop more for my blueberry tastes.

I too, added 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 teaspoon on vanilla.  I didn't have any trouble with the dough being too sticky -- I actually had to add a bit more cream.  Then again, I made certain that the flour was closer to 2 1/4 cups.  I brushed the tops with egg whites and sprinkled on vanilla sugar --absolutely divine!

A winner!  Need to add lots of extra flour tho.  I use whole wheat pastry flour.  Brush tops w/frothy egg whites, then sprinkle w/granulated sugar and rolled oats.  Tips:  To prevent blue batter, roll the berries in flour before adding.  To easily slice into wedges, first spray knife w/cooking spray.  Also spray baking sheet to ensure easy removal.

my scones were rather like muffins, though taste-wise, they were still good.  my amendments to half the recipe: whole wheat flour, raisins instead of blueberries,tsp of vanilla, plain yogurt instead of milk, extra tbsp sugar, 1 egg white instead of 1/2 egg.  no kneading required, just mixing everything up together to get a dough-like mound.  plopped it onto a baking sheet on parchment paper. it's not possible to separate into wedges so i "cut" them to get the incisions, bake until about 5 mins til done, take them out, and cut them up for good and bake it for remaining time left and more cuz i think they are still too moist.  next time, i shall flatten out the dough a little more so i don't have to bake extra time.  a keeper recipe for basic scones.  good for adding whatever you have handy in your pantry.  am thinking of chocolate chips the next time :)

Yes it was sticky and so I did not shape and cut as per the instructions but made drop scones as another reviewer suggested. Used frozen blueberries and added 1/4 tsp vanilla ... liked the fact that it was not too sweet, but rather light and going well with butter. Both girls liked it alot also.

These were so simple and easy to make and they are delicious!  My dough was too sticky to handle so I just dropped large spoonfuls of dough onto the cookie sheet and they turned out fabulous.  All I did differently was added a bit more blueberries.

These scones were delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I didn't have fresh blueberries, I used frozen.  I used french vanilla coffee creamer, instead of the half and half, added about 1/3 cup more flour and a little lemon zest. I also dusted the tops with white sugar and pressed it in with my finger.  I had to bake them about 3-4 mins. longer than the recipe said, but the outcome was fantastic.  Can't tell you how good they are...just try them!

The "dough" was very sticky and gooey but the scones turned out a little dry. I will probably put more butter in next time. These tasted fantastic and I will definitely make them again.

This is really great.  I lightened it up a bit by using 3 Tablespoons of butter and substituting buttermilk for the half-and half.  When using buttermilk, I had to add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and reduce the baking powder to 1 teaspoon. I also added 1/4 cup flour.  Frozen blueberries should not be defrosted, if using. When mixing, I made a well in the center of the dry ingredients, poured in the liquid and gently stirred together from the edges of the bowl.

These were delicious! I added a little extra brown sugar because I like a sweet scone. The dough was wet, so you can't really shape them, just dollup them on the baking sheet...but YUM!

GREAT - but you can easily double the sugar, and you might want to, if you like your scones a little sweet (particularly if your blueberries are not very sweet). And in fact, I would recommend using more sugar if you are used to "coffee shop" scones. Very good, though, and easy to make. Also, I used someone's recommendation of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt   instead of the half and half/cream. It worked great!

Very good. When mixing this, it was obvious that this was way too sticky to roll, so I just dropped them on the cookie sheet, like others. When making these, use your common sense. If it seems way too sticky, don't add more flour and try to roll out, the dough will become tough (learned this the hard way:)). The scones are not sweet at all, you can really taste the blueberries. I served with clotted cream, and was told that these are better than those served in a bakery. Will make again, thank you.

As many have observed, this does yield a sticky batter, but if you coat the surface you are turning the batter onto with flour and then coat your hands with flour before you begin to knead, then it is quite workable.  I added 1/4 cup graulated sugar as others have suggested and reduced the amount of baking powder to 1 tsp. (because I do not like the taste of baking powder) and added 1/4 tsp. baking soda.  I topped the rounds with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar before I popped them in the oven. The scones turned out light and delicious.  An instant breakfast favorite.

I followed most of the advice in the other comments and they came out really good. I would suggest lining your baking sheet with parchment paper as the dough is really sticky. I also had success putting the dough rounds in the freezer for a few minutes before baking. Much easier to work with that way.

These are delicious! I followed the suggestions and added 1/4 flour,1/4 white sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and sprinkled the top with vanilla sugar before baking. Excellent and easy. I will definitely make these again!

I took others' advice and used almost 2 1/4 c. flour, 1/4 c. white sugar in addition to the brown sugar, and 1 to 1 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I thought I'd made a mistake when the dough would barely stick together, but it stuck together enough and the end result was fantastic.  My British neighbor asked for the recipe.  Very yummy!

Wow!!! 5 stars for these just isn't enough!!! I LOVED them. More importantly though, my mom loved them. It's tradition that I make her Scones for Mother's Day breakfast. I wasn't happy with the recipe I used last year, so I decided to try this one. SOOO glad I did! It's great! The only thing I changed is that I added a couple tsps of real mexican vanilla, which I would highly reccomend. GREAT recipe! :)

I just made these this morning with the last of our fresh blueberries! ,followed the recipe.  As for complaints about lack of sweetness/taste....I found these very authentic tasting based on lots of time spent, and scones eaten in England and Scotland.  The "scones" served at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts are the imposters...THESE are the real deal :) Yes, the dough was sticky....but that doesn't really matter because you don't need to handle the dough very much.   I divided it and placed each lump on a moderately floured board and pressed it lightly into a circle (put flour on my hands so it didn't stick) and cut with a floured knife.  very simple!  I brushed the tops with cream, as noted in other recipes I have made.  When cooled, I drizzled with a lemon glaze (confectioners sugar and fresh lemon juice)

I love this recipe, the only thing I did differently, was substitute buttermilk instead of cream for a bit of a tang.  I also just dropped them on a greased cookie sheet and get rave reviews.  Why bother making them into triangles, they are to die for and so easy to put together.  Won't use another recipe and as far as not sweet enough, check out other recipes that call for much less sugar, obviously scones aren't supposed to be too sweet, but these are perfect sweetness.  I highly recommend this and am sticking with this recipe from now on!  They are crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside!  I have varied this recipe using rasberries and bananas together and my next try is with cinnamon chips for an autumn flair!

This recipe is quick and easy and very delicious.  Scones are not a super-sweet pastry and these are every bit as good as those from Starbucks.  I did use white sugar rather than brown and used 1/3 cup rather than 1/4 cup.  I was able to get mine shaped and cut into wedges despite their "wetness" but would probably drop by spoonfuls next time, as another reviewer mentioned.  As soon as they came out of the oven, I topped them with a powdered sugar glaze into which I grated some lemon zest (about 1/4 tsp).  Superb!

I made these tonight, but with dried blueberries from Costco -- I liked that they stayed intact, but fresh berries would definitely be a bit sweeter.  I added more flour, some white sugar and topped with an egg wash and turbino sugar per some of the reviews -- the texture turned out perfect.  I'd been trying to find a recipe similar to Starbuck's blueberry scones and this is about as good as it gets!

These were really yummy.  The blueberries make it sweet without tasting so sugary.  I doubled the recipe.  The batter is slightly "wet" but it's not a problem.  I just made the scone in a "drop biscuit" form and it worked great.  Next time I make these I think I might sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top before baking.

I was quite pleased with how this turned out! This was my first attempt at scones. I had a carton of blueberries I needed to use, so I found this recipe and gave it a go. I found it easy to carry out, and the result was a dozen blueberry scones that were moist, fluffy, and not too sweet. I followed the recipe to the letter.   Some tips:  * The dough will be very wet and sticky. It will look more like a thick batter than dough.  * After I mixed the wet ingredients into the dry,I tipped it out onto a floured work surface, and floured my hands well to handle it.  * I didn't really knead it per se, I just patted it into a ball and then pinched that ball into 2 smaller ones. Then I patted both small balls into thick disks and cut them into 6 wedges.  * Some dough did end up sticking to my hands, but I worked quickly and lightly, and it wasn't a big deal.  * I placed each wedge by hand onto a piece of parchment paper on the cookie sheet.  Et voila! 20 minutes later, I have warm, lovely scones!  Side note: I have looked around online at other scone recipes, and I saw a highly rated one from a certain blonde, bespectacled Food Network chef that is very similar to this recipe. The differences are that his uses a combination of butter and shortening instead of only butter as this one does, and he uses slightly less sugar, and a touch more baking powder.

Wonderful!  I don't know why everyone was complaining that the batter was wet -- scone batter is supposed to be very wet, that's what makes the scone light and fluffy.  If you're having trouble handling the dough, flour your hands and pat it into a circle on your surface covered very liberally with flour.  We like to brush the top of our scones with a little milk and sprinkle with sugar.

I added maybe an 1/8 of a cup of white sugar besides the 1/4 cup of brown. They were very soft & flaky right after baking. I mixed the dry ingredients & butter in the food processor, which was easier than cutting it in. I used frozen blueberries tossed with a little flour, but anything could be added to this recipe.
I used 8-wedge scone pan and there was a little extra - it still took about 20 minutes to bake.

Wow!  I just made these scones and they came out perfect.  The dough was definetly sticky, but I took another reviewers' attitude and ignored the stickiness.  It came out great. I did use white sugar instead of brown sugar and added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar.  I subsituted 1 of 2 cups of flour with Whole Wheat flour just to make it a little healthier and the still came out light. This is a keeper.

I used heavy cream - actually INCRESED to 1c plus a splash of milk for a sticky dough so I could just drop 6 scones on the cookie sheet.  EASY!  Less mess.  Baked almost twice the time in the recipe - until golden all over.  Very light and fluffy!  Drizzled with a mixture of lemon juice, milk and powdered sugar as they needed just a touch more sweetness.  Can easily be made into 8-12 scones as these were very large.

I still like Grandma Johnsons scones the best. Anyway, just made these. The dough was a bit wet, as others have said, but I floured my hands for each scone which made it workable. I also used frozen blueberries, some broke, most were intact. The result was alright, but not sweet or buttery enough for me. I think I would top them with a sugar glaze, but that's preference. It just seems like there is something missing. Some like it more plain, others more sweet. The scones are nice and soft with a crunchy edge. I gave this a four, but prob. won't make it again unless my friends and family like them. Thank you.

I don't know why people said the batter was to wet.  My family thought they were the best.  The only changes that I made was I used french vanilla half and half, I didn't kneed the dough and I just spoon dropped on a cookie sheet.

I thought these were great.  Not only did they taste good, but they are super easy to make.  I did have to make a few minor changes though: 1) I didn't have half and half so I used light sour cream and a little skim milk to equal 3/4 c., 2) I didn't bother to cut the wedges, I just dropped spoonfuls of batter, 3) I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 c. because I like sweet scones, 4) I sprinkled white sugar on the scones before putting them in the oven.  Another reviewer mentioned rinsing the frozen blueberries first which I did and my scones did not turn out blue, so I would recommend it.  A few people mentioned that the dough was too wet, but I didn't find that at all. This seems like a great basic scone recipe that you could easily vary to suit your tastes. I will make these often.  Thanks!

This was a simple, fast and easy recipe to make. I get tired of making sugary cookies I snack on at night.  With these I can have a couple with my AM coffee and let go of the guilt.  I made one batch blueberry and one plain with sugar and cinnamon.

Absolutely wonderful,I took the advice of the previous reviews and added the 1/4c sugar and 1/4c flour. I used whole wheat white flour and substituted sauted apples with cinnamon instead of the blueberry's. I sold them at a bake sale and they were a great hit!!!!

Easy to make but, it needed a little more sugar.

They are a bit sticky, so adding some flour is a good idea, but be careful not to add too much.  Just enough to make the dough manageable.  If you're careful while mixing, you will not have too much trouble with the berries bursting.  Small, wild berries don't burst as easily as the large, unnatural ones you get at the store. I use brown sugar and white sugar, too. The taste of these scones was very nice. My husband loved them.

Quite good!  I went against both the recipe and common sense and used heavy cream instead of half-and-half (that's how my mother taught me scones should be made, after all), and because my berries were very tart, I used an extra 1/3 cup of sugar.  These were rich and delicious.

This recipe is so easy to put together and makes such good scones! To change it up a bit try adding raspberries :)

i too thought that these were more like muffins than scones.  they tasted good and everyone enjoyed them on mother's day.  but they're really not scones.  i did use some lemon yogurt and soy milk as a substitution.  the dough was sticky and impossible to cut prior to baking.  i cut them about halfway through the cooking time.  the egg white and sprinkled sugar on top is a must and definitely makes these muffin/scones look more professional.

Good basic recipe. Made the following changes from necessity and for preference.  Didn't have any cream. Used half and half mix of sour cream and skim milk for that liquid, plus a couple TBS of buttermilk powder.   Added a cup of dried blueberries along with cup of fresh called for. Added 1/8 C brown sugar to the 1/4 called for. Brushed tops with milk and sprinkled with Demerara sugar before baking. 

They turned out great.  Yes we like our scones a little sweeter.  Not sure why the complaints re texture, they were great.  Crunchy outside moist inside.

I followed this recipe to the letter and they came out perfect.  Dough was not too wet or too dry so I don't know why there have been other complaints.  Just tried one fresh from the oven and it was perfect, just sweet enough.  Enjoyed with my English breakfast tea!

The first time I made these I added the blueberries to the flour mixture as the recipe states. Then when I kneaded, of course, all the blueberries burst and I had blue scones. Still good, but not very attractive. This time I added after I had added milk / eggs and kneaded VERY gently a couple of times then I added fresh blueberries and VERY gently incorporated them into the dough. They turned out so pretty and not blue! The whole family loved these. So easy and fast. I will make again. I also made a thin glaze with powdered sugar, a little milk and melted butter. :-)

I wanted a more savory blueberry treat than muffins, and decided to try this. This is a great scones recipe!  Reading the reviews, I decided to cut the liquid and add 1/2 cup yogurt and 1 egg instead. But the batter was too dry, so I ended up adding 1/4 cup of milk after all, bringing the liquid up to what the recipe called for. Like our southern biscuits, scone batter should be very sticky, and barely hold together. I floured my hands and worked the dough gently into scone shapes rather than trying to cut it. Came out really well!

This was the first time I've ever made scones and chose this recipe because of the simplicity.  I absolutely loved the scones!  Not too sweet and with fresh blueberries the flavor was amazing!  I will definitely save this recipe to my favorites!

This is a fantastic recipe, easy to customize if you stick with the "rules" that some of the other experienced bakers have mentioned.  I believe the reason that the recipe calls for adding the cream/egg mixture slowly is to be certain only the amount necessary is added.  
Anyway, I used this recipe as my base for making: blueberry/lemon (added the zest of 1 large lemon), cinnamon/raisin, cherry/chocolate and the crowd favorite pear/ginger.  I also added vanilla and freshly grated nutmeg to the c/r and p/g scones...WOW!!!!  A big hit.

I received nearly a dozen requests for the recipe.  Another trick I use to be certain that the butter isn't too soft by the time it goes into the oven, I freeze a stick and grate it into the recipe when it is called for.  Fresh blueberries (or any fruit) must be blotted after washing.

This is a crowd-pleaser recipe and on a chilly morning, with coffee or tea, its a perfect little side of warmth.  Off I go to bake a batch right now.

This was my first try making scones before, even though I've eaten them in the past. I wanted to learn how to make them myself, but as I'm an amateur cook, I wanted a basic recipe that even someone like me could follow without too much confusion. The scones turned out great! Sure, the preparation process is very messy. The dough is very wet to handle, but if you coat your hands in some flour this remedies the problem. Also, the blueberries tended to break as I mixed the dough together. It ended up not being a big deal, but in the future I may try using frozen blueberries. The dough isn't all that sweet either, which is fine, but I also sprinkled some sugar on top before baking to give them a little something. I put my scones on parchment paper just in case they stuck to the pan, and they came off like a charm. Anyway, high praise for this recipe!

Wonderful basic scones.  I needed to bake them a little longer than requested in the recipe but that may be because I used frozen blueberries.  This recipe is not sweet, so I used a light drizzle of icing to dress them up.  We liked them very much.

Followed this recipe with only one change.  I subbed the brown sugar with Splenda's brown sugar.  They turned out great, even my picky husband loves them.  This is a keeper!

The end result was delicious.  But I could not knead my dough; it was too wet and sticky.  For me, it was more like baking a cake or bread.  I put the wet, sticky mess onto a baking sheet, and baked from there...

This is a tasty recipe, but the dough was very difficult to manage.  I increased the flour a little and really fluffed up the half and half with the egg.  They taste great warm, straight out of the oven.

The first time I made these I thought they were good. I did not have half and half so I used liquid coffe creamer(even though I liked it I would not recommend it, I had to add extra flour)The second time I made these I still did not have half and half but I had cream, all I can say is AWESOME. It made a world of difference and was delicious! I will definately make these again. Someday I will try with half and half.

The dough was very sticky and wet as the others have said, but that was an easy fix with just a bit more flour. I didn't really knead it more than one or two times. If you're looking for a bigger scone (like what you see in the bakeries) you don't have to split the dough in half.. just make one large circle of dough, then slice into triangles. I also dusted it with a bit of granulated sugar prior to baking. I think when I make this recipe again I'm going to put a bit of lemon zest into the mix to emphasize the taste of the blueberries even more. I really liked this recipe!

Great recipe, dough was perfectly workable and not gooey at all.  Not sure what other reviewers did to their mix to but I followed the recipe exactly (though I added a bit over a cup of blueberries) and it came out great.  Result was as expected for a scone, though my wife likes 'em a bit sweeter so I'll probably at least add sugar to the top next time.

OMG... I'm eating one of these as I type and they're so yummy!  I made a few alterations according to the reviews.  I added aprox. 1 more T butter.  I also used a flavored creamer in place of the half and half; added a pinch of dried lemon peel.  I was very carful to not overmix so they stayed tender and moist inside.  Great recipe! :)

My dh loves blueberries but to me they are just good. I really enjoyed them in this recipe and will make it again! I used frozen berries and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. You can grate the cold butter which makes it easier to cut into the flour. Yes the dough was sticky so next time I won't use all of the cream unless needed. I put half the dough on a floured counter, sprinkled flour on top and on  my hands (tried to use only one hand). Tried to knead it but it was difficult. The other 1/2 I put on a floured cookie sheet and that was easier. Made 6" circles, didn't cut, spread a spoonful of milk on top then sprinkled on sugar. DH said they were not sweet and I said they are not supposed to be. They were just right. Soft, tender, light, tastey...  If you need more sweet you can drizzle a glaze on them.

this recipe was perfect as was.  I think the secret to this dough is not to add all the liquid at once, and to mix only until it all starts to stick together.  Don't overmix!  The result is light and slightly crumbly but absolutely delicious with a cup of fresh coffee.  I did out of personal preference add wild dried blueberries instead of fresh and incl a dollop of vanilla.

Blueberry Scones- nice, I like that it's not sweet (scones shouldn't be sweet) but it is slightly bland. I'll try some buttermilk and/or vanilla and cinamoon next time.

I made a batch of these this morning, they are good! I also added 1/2 sugar, a little vanilla and extra flour, used whipping cream instead of half-and-half. I did not find them runny at all and they turned out like scones should look. I also brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled a little cane sugar on the tops. :)

I made these using a gluten free flour mixture for the all-purpose (1/2 c each of chickpea, tapioca, asian white and millet flour, plus 2 t xatham gum) and they turned out very tasty! (I did sprinkle a bit of cinnamon sugar on top, but otherwise followed everything up to the kneading part.) They aren't the prettiest scones I've seen, but everyone really likes them! I'll definitely make these again.

Good recipe depending on what you are looking for. These are very moist and good, but I was looking for scones that aren't so moist, like the ones at GlenLaurel Inn in Hocking Hills. There is no way these can be rolled out, I dropped them them on the cookie sheet like drop biscuits and then shaped them. They were a hit with my family, just not exactly what I was looking for.

I thought these scones were delicious.  My dough was wet though - but that didn't bother me.  These came out quite traditional as I was expecting.  Our family ate these with some homemade blueberry jam...simply outstanding!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  We went blueberry picking today and I was delighted to find that I already had everything else I needed to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly and, I don't want to jinx myself, but I didn't have an issue with mushy dough like some people did.  I was able to divide the dough and cut it into nice little triangles without adding any extra flour.  I did need to bake them about 25 minutes (instead of 20) but that may have just been my oven.  They came out just like the picture.  They were not super sweet (like a cookie) but according to my English friend scones aren't supposed to be really sweet.  My whole family LOVED them!

Yummy!  I made a healthier version and it still tasted  great!  Here's what I did: 1) Mix 3/4 cup of whole wheat flower and 1 1/4cups of white flour.  2) Replace the cream with either plain yogurt or blueberry sugar free yogurt.  3) replace the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar blend.  4) replace chilled butter with heart healthy margarine, chilled in the freezer for a few minutes.  4) used frozen blueberries as suggested.  ENJOY!!!

i had a hard time cutting this, so I made them drop style like others have suggested.  For me this made 10 good sized scones, not 12. I also made this in my Kitchenaid mixer, which really made it a snap.  keeper for me!

super-easy, super-tasty!  very light and fluffy~ I followed the recipe most of the way, but did change a few things: added an extra 1/8 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, substituted blueberries with dried cherries, added 1 1/2 tsp almond extract, and just dropped them on a parchment-covered baking sheet instead of forming a round/cutting.

These are good! Yes they have a wet dough but that keeps it moist, which is nice because most scones are dry. I used 2% milk and 1/3 cup more blueberries (just cause I had more) shaped it (round) but didnt score it or cut it until it was fully cooked thru. I like that they are not very sweet so you can add your jam or honey without being overly sweetened. I will make these again. YUM!

I made these with gluten-free all purpose flour and they had no taste. I made a lemon glaze to put on top and it improved a bit. I suspect that they would have been better had I not made them gluten-free. They were very easy though.

As with all scone recipes, adding just enough of the liquid to make a nice dough is the key to not ending up with a gloppy, hard-to-work-with mess.  I added 1/4 C flour and used regular whipping cream - starting with 1/2 C and adding more to work the dough.  I've been making scones for over 10 years - this is a wonderful, easy recipe!

This was my first scone recipe.  I've been making it for years, since discovering it on Allrecipes.  If the dough ends up too sticky, the butter probably melted.  Ensure the butter comes straight out of the fridge, and don't work it for too long.  Done correctly, the dough is not at all too sticky to cut into wedges.

These were DELICIOUS! I used frozen blueberries so I added 2/3 cup flour to make up for the extra moisture. I also poured some Sugar in the Raw on top before putting them in the oven, which turned out awesome!

I didn't have a problem with the wet texture, though it wasn't conducive to cutting (perhaps it would be with some of the recommended changes by other reviewers). I just dropped and plopped mine, which is how I wanted to make them anyways. The down side for me was the very bland flavor (and I'm not even a sweet tooth) and the consistency of the final product, which was more cake-like than most scones I've known and loved. Like others said, it's perhaps a "good" base, but I'm not looking for a starting point, I'm looking for a good scone recipe.

This recipe was absolutely awesome.  I'm not a big scone fan but my husband likes them and we have tons of blueberries so I thought I would give this a try.  And, not only did my husband and son love it, I did as well. I'm going to make a double batch and give some to my sister and her family.

Asbolutely fantastic recipe!!!!

I use it as a base recipe for all my scones. I substitute blueberries with raspberries, chopped fresh cranberries, or any other small fruit. Also, I use whole wheat flour (Robin Hood brand) to increase the fiber content. If I don't have half/half cream I use half 35% cream and halk milk

Very good scone recipe.  I made a few changes the second time I made them.  Add 1/2 Cup more flour, and mix in the blueberries after you add the wet ingredients.  This makes it much easier to handle.

I made these for my husband who loves scones and these were a hit with him. I used heavy whipping cream as others had suggested and used 1/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown sugar too. I made these as drop scones. Thanks for the recipe!

very easy to make and subbed dried cranberries for the blueberries...if you want a sweeter scone definitely add the extra 1/4 cup sugar.  Also very sticky batter ( i didn't add extra 1/4 c flour) so made an easy drop scone instead.  Watch the baking time as to not overbake

this batter is sticky.  I took a short cut and just dropped the dough by spoonfuls to the cookie sheet.  These weren't very sweet.  I wish I had read more reviews before I baked these,  I would have added the sugar and vanilla as one person did.
The good thing about these is you  can make them for a party or tea.  I made some small so my kids could eat them, instead of muffins.

not sure if I would make them again,  I would like to find a better recipe.

I also added the extra sugar and they turned out sweet enough for me. However, I was looking for a more traditional scone texture. This one just wasn't as hard or dense as I wanted. They did get a little harder when I toasted them.

I read the reviews before making these and added 1/4 c of regular sugar into the batter before baking.  I also rolled the dough out on a floured board and had to add extra flour to keep it from sticking to everything it touched.

The result was bland, tasteless scones.  They were still hardly sweet at all, even with the extra sugar, and the extra flour necessary to work with the dough also took away from the taste of the scones.

I changed the cream to 2% milk, and added 1/4 ts. almond extract to the egg/milk mixture. Also added 1/4 ts. cinnamon to the dry mixture. A little extra flour was needed when forming the dough, not much though. I brushed the scones with beaten egg whites and sprinkled with sugar in the raw for a perfect finish. These are very good and easy to make. Be sure to give them enough space on the baking sheet as they enlarge quite a bit due to the baking powder.

Was really delicious. I did add a little extra flour because I skimmed through the ratings before I baked them. They came out perfect.  I RECOMMEND sprinkling granulated sugar on top to sweeten them up before or after baking like the woman who makes them at my local bakery. Mine were just as good as her and hers are good.

130 people have just had these BLUEBERRY SCONES,remarks; nice and moist not dried out, great flavor, very professial looking, not like the ones you get in the store. I added 1 teaspoon vanilla and knead 3/4 cup of flour carefully into dough, no problem cutting before baking.  Sprinkled 1/4 cup of sugar on top before baking. GREAT RECIPE!

I just have to say that if you are looking for a tasty recipe for blueberry scones that you can dress up or use as is this is it! I have a tip for those of you who have had difficulty with a sticky dough. First, cube the butter and put it in the freezer while you work on the other aspects of the dough. Second and this is very important, when adding the liquids to the dry ingredients go slow and only add enough to moisten the dough you may not need the full amount. To help with this try adding the egg to the milk in a measuring cup (not a separate bowl) this allows for better control. Happy baking!

I knew there had to be a reason so many had bad results, and then I read the one about cutting back on the liquid instead of increasing the flour if the dough is sticky. I used just 1/2 a cup of milk kefir instead of the half n half. The results were spectacular! These are the first scones I've made and I'm not a great baker, but these couldn't have turned out better. I used organic blueberries and baked the scones on parchment paper. I'll be making these again, soon!

Best scones! I read some of the not so great reviews and I thoroughly disagree. I followed the instructions exactly and my dough was sticky (like scone dough should be)  and turned out Great! These are true scones, not the overly hard and overly sugary things chain cafés like to sell. I think this may be the reason people are adding sugar?!? But if you know what a real scone should taste like (not from a mass produced preservative laden mix or sold with an overpriced coffee) then you will love these! They are  not sweet nor are they supposed to be... And if you mix the dough just enough but not too much the butter will distribute itself perfectly for a crispy outside and soft inside with little buttery pockets. I used fresh and firm blueberries.

I REALLY liked how these turned out. ONE CHANGE THOUGH: the recipe says 1/4 brown sugar. I would alter that to a half cup, so they are less like biscuits OR add a bit of drizzle on top. Also, add 1/4 cup more flour.....Update: I liked these so much, I'm going to try them today with cranberries instead of blueberries. My family is loving this recipe

These were awesome! Yes, the dough is sticky, but most scone dough is sticky. Just flour the board and your hands and it is easily worked. I will definitely make this again, but I will try adding some lemon zest and cinnamon to enhance the blueberry flavor.

These were delicious!  I followed the recipe and while the dough was a little sticky, it was manageable.  After mixing it I put it in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes which helped the scones keep their shape and rise beautifully.  I brushed the tops with cream and sprinkled with sugar before baking to add a nice finish.  Quick, easy recipe with delicious results.

I made these only I used white sugar, 1/3 cup of heavy cream and 2 eggs, because that is what I had on hand - the dough is sticky, but that is ok you add a little extra flour to pat the ball of dough into a circle or square about 1 inch thick then cut into triangles, brush some cream on top and sprinkle with extra white sugar before baking. Scones are not meant to be super sweet, they are good with butter and jam, or lemon curd.

Fantastic! I didn't have any half-and-half handy, so I used a combination of 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt and a 1/2 cup low-fat milk, which worked just fine.

Yum!! After reading the reviews, and since this was my first time ever to make scones.  I only added a 1/2 cup of the half and half.  Since a lot of people said that it was too wet.  So only using 1/2 cup was perfect.  I will make these again.  They were very yummy.

This recipe is awesome exactly as written. For those having trouble here are my thoughts...
Stir the dough literally JUST enough to combine dry ingredients...barely. For the kneeding part...I didn't...just smushed it against the side of the bowl GENTLY twice or three times until it made a ball. The warmth in your hands melts your chilled butter! You need chunks in there for an excellent product!
Hockey pucks do not make good eats...even with coffee! And coffee can save anything! Seriously, though, dont bake them rock hard. Mine were just brown on the bottom and bottom edge. When I picked them up off the cookie sheet...which I did spray with Baker's Joy...they felt like they might crumble apart if I manhandled them.
Just grab shaggy handfuls of dough...resist the urge to shape. Put the "lumps" on the cookie sheet and bake.
I used the seeds of 1 1/2 real vanilla beans in mine...yummy! Next time I will increase a little. The vanilla adds a hint of natural sweetness which is lovely.

Made these last night...quick, easy, and yummy!  I was a little hesitant to make these after reading that the dough was too wet...but the recipe looked too easy NOT to try :) I followed the directions exactly, yes, the dough was a little sticky but really not difficult to work with.  Sweetness was just right, you don't want them too sugary, and I could taste the blueberry flavor.  I did make a vanilla glaze to drizzle over top after they were done just in case my husband wanted more sweetness....but I prefer them plain, and he liked them both ways.  I'll be making these again, and probably try them with raspberries, too.

We read the reviews that said it was easier to use the drop method, as the dough was sticky.  We tried both the drop method and rolling it out/cutting it, with a little extra flour.  Both were good.  We liked the drop ones slightly better, as it gave them an appealing texture on the  top.    Next time, I'd try 1.5 cups of blueberries!

I made this recipe three times today and each time I adjusted to my taste.  Those who stated dough was too sticky could add more flour or could use dried blueberries that release less liquid.  It is a solid basic recipe that is quick and homemade from scratch!  What's not to love about that?  And FYI, scones are not supposed to be super sweet.  The amount of sugar was just right.

(quote from my 3 y/0) "Mommy, these are even better than the cookies!"

That being said, I would agree with other posters who suggest cutting a little of the liquid (just a little) to make the dough easier to work with.  I will also sprinkle the tops with raw sugar before baking next time.  Using frozen berries makes the preparation a dream!  I will make this often--wonderful for a brunch!

These are really good scones, however, I cut back on the liquid as well.  I probably used just less than 2/3 c. half and half.  I also added lemon zest.  This is probably not a good recipe for someone who has never made scones unless they read the reviews first.

I love blueberry scones, but every time I try to make them, the dough is either too wet, or so bread-like that the blueberries get crushed in the kneading. While this dough was a little too sticky to knead (I ended up adding about 1/3 cup flour during kneading), it turned out great. The scones are so delicious, moister than most I can get in stores. I did also add a little vanilla extract. But honestly, this is going to be my basic scone recipe from now on. Excellent.

These are literally the best scones I've ever had! I had to be a little careful, because my oven cooks faster than most, so I had to take it out 5 minutes early, but each scone came out golden and delicious! The batter was a little drier than I thought it would be so I had some "batter crumbs" left behind, but honestly, the end product was SO worth it. I'm a college student, and new to baking, and b/c of my limited income, some recipes have ingredients that are too expensive, but this one actually wasn't, and now I don't have to pay ridiculous prices at the local bakery for a good scone!

This was my first attempt at making scones and I thought this was a wonderful recipe!  Easy to put together and tasted delicious.  Yes, the batter was really moist and cutting it wasn't so easy but the end product was perfect so I don't really mind what the shape is.  My son and husband both loved them!  Definitely a keeper.  Can't wait to try with raspberries and white chocolate.

I LOVE this recipe... I do add more flour to it because it is a wetter consistency but I like to stick the dough in muffin tins to make a nice round shape. Regardless, they taste amazing and you can do several variations on it... I like using strawberries :)

I thought these were excellent and easy if you are not worried about shaping.  I ended up cooking them in mounds and they turned out great.  They looked nice as well. I used milk instead of cream only because that is what I had on hand.  I sprinkled sugar on top as suggested by others.  These are the perfect breakfast scone...not too sweet.  I look forward to making them with raspberries and white chocolate...my favourite scone at my local bakery!

It is a very good and simple recipe.  I made it for the first time a couple of days ago.  We love them.  The only change I made was using self rising flour instead of plain with baking powder.  Again we love them.  I also froze 6 of the 12 as a test since it's just the 2 of us it would be nice to have them later.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent recipe! Some reveiws say the dough was soggy. It wasn't for me! I did double the brown sugar, and it wasn't too sweet. It could also use more salt a perhaps a touch of cinnamon. But the bluberries were nice and juicy! I tried out "drop-scones" as another reveiws teaches. Like drop-biscuits you spoon out the batter onto a greased cook sheet. It turned out wonderful! I'm surely going to make this again!

Great recipe;  I don't like my pastries too sweet and this was a perfect mixture. I substituted 1/2 c. of low-fat yogurt for the cream, and just added a little skim milk as I was mixing the dough until it came together. I also tried a batch substituting 1 c. of whole wheat flour--delicious!

These were wonderful! I used some suggestions for others, and they came out delightful! I substituted 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt for the cream, and added the juice and zest of 1 lemon and a sprinkle of granulated sugar on top. All the rest of the ingredients were unchanged. I agree that the pan needed parchment paper if for no other reason than to keep the blueberry goodness off the pan and speeding clean-up. I cut the dough into 8 large scones, though I wish I had cut them into 12. As a result of the larger size I needed to bake them an extra 5 or so minutes. After resting for 5 minutes, they had great texture, enough sweetness (the vanilla yogurt helped that), and fantastic lemon-blueberry flavor. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I'm going to try orange-cranberry, peach, apricot and whatever fresh fruits come along. Should be a delightful summer with this recipe!

My entire family loved these.  3 generations - my mother, husband and young adult daughter.  I used frozen blueberries (we had frozen after picking from a farm a week ago) and a mixture of all purpose and whole wheat flours.  Cut butter into small chunks before cutting into flour.  Also, mixed wet into dry ingredients all at once, but did not stir more than necessary to get the dry ingredients wet.  Will likely make them again.

Great. I used half a cup of strawberry fat free yogurt in place of the three fourths of a cup of half and half. I also didn't have an egg so I used a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of water. The blueberries I used were frozen. They turned out tasting like a low fat product. Mainly the consistency wasn't there. Using a real egg would have been better. Also the half and half. I am used to scones being very buttery and high in calories and fat. Great breakfast food. And I put lemon icing over one batch. My boyfriend loved it.

These were delicious! I made them on a whim for a girlfriend I was having over. Our 13 month olds loved them too! I, like others, added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon which added just a little more flavor. Next time, I think I'll add a little lemon zest too! Great recipe! Moist and delicious!

I saved some of the egg/milk mixture to brush on top, like in the "How to Make Scones" video I saw on AllRecipes.com. Dough was sticky, but not unmanageable. Finished product is delicious!

I used thawed frozen blueberries, and in place of the cream I used 3/4 c. (6 oz. container) of Dannon's (could be any brand though) blueberry yogurt.  The blueberry yogurt (stirred before adding) gave it a bit of a blueberry tinge and added a bit more sweetness and less fat.   I'd add some coarse sugar to the tops before baking the next time, but not necessary.  For those who commented on the dough being so sticky - well, it is.  But flour the board before turning it out to shape it, and flour your hands before you start shaping it or before kneading it.  I found mine really didn't need much kneading.  Shaping it can do most of that job.  It will not be like a bread dough.  So although you think you have a sticky mass of nothing, it's really something!  Yummy!

This recipe was not sweet at all, and was VERY bland. I managed to save them from being too boring by making an icing for them. They were a lot better after that. I wouldn't recommend this recipe unless you are willing to play around with it and fix it.

The problem with this recipe is its name. Its not a scone its a drop batter for...something like a muffin. scones turn into a dough, this does not and it has too much baking powder in it. Its not a good recipe if it has to have major changes ( double flour, less b.p., more sugar) to meet its name. Sorry. I also did not think it tasted good. Congrads to all who like the flavor.

Great recipe. Super easy. My boyfriend and I had these for days with our morning breakfast shakes.

06/24/12 update: I have tried these in the last couple of months with different fruits; once with apricots and once with rasberries, always turned out great. The only thing is that depending on the moisture of the fruit, I had to add more flour when working the dough to cut it.

Excellent recipe.  I added the rind of one lemon to the recipe because I like the combination with blueberries.  When kneading the dough, add some flour above and below the mixture otherwise, it is very sticky.  Doesn't require much kneading, just press the dough in to the circles referenced in the recipe.  Scones are not dry, and are wonderful with a cup of tea.

These scones are easy to make.  Yes, the dough is wet you can add flour as needed.  I thought they have good texture but flavor was slightly bland, not a sweet scone at all.  I will try this again but I will add lemon zest for some dimension in flavor.

simple, quick and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly (cold butter which may help it not be messy?) it was neither messy nor impossible to cut.  Shaped and cut easily.  I'm confused by those who were unsuccessful.  I'll use this over and over again...great and I imagine able to adapt to other flavors instead of blueberries.

Read thru the reviews and I added a little more flour and a touch of vanilla. Even with the little extra flour, they were still very sticky. I just dropped spoonfuls of the mixture on a parchment covered baking sheet. They were delicious tho!

These are delicious. I just made them tonight and my whole place smells like a bakery.
I did like someone else suggested and used 1/2cup of plain non-fat yogurt instead of cream because I had it on hand. They turned out great. I used fresh blueberries and it's like a blueberry scone explosion!

These were GREAT!   As another reviewer mentioned, I don't understand why others are giving this recipe a bad rating either!!!  I loved it!   I shaped in the two circles and cut the slices and it was delicious.  I made a powdered sugar glaze to go over the top.  Some mentioned that they couldn't shape the dough, but it worked fine for me.  It was a little sticky, but I just sprinkled some flour on it to help with that.  Will definitely make again!  My husband loved them too!

These scones were good.  Obviously those who gave it a bad review do not understand that scones...are not meant to be overly sweet.  If that is what you are going for bake something else.  I used heavy cream, added tsp of vanilla, topped with brushed cream before baking and little sugar.  The dough was not too mushy....just like it should be and it is cutable....

These were absolutely delicious! I didn't pre-sift the flour beforehand, so that extra little bit was enough to give the correct texture. I used old fashioned brown sugar and dusted them with white sugar prior to baking. This is my new favorite blueberry scone recipe!

These scones are very delicious. The dough was perfect for me.  I wonder if people had trouble with the dough being too soft or wet live in warmer and more humid climates or didn't keep the dough chilled. The amount of the sugar is probably OK for store-bought blueberries.  If you are used to very sweet baked goods, you need extra sugar.  I used wild blueberries and they were too sour, so I added sugar glaze.

I doubled the blueberries, and didn't use any butter (the directions didn't say when to add it, so I didn't), yet still amazing since we ate them right out of the oven. They are not very sweet at all, which I liked. Also, I made them as drop cookies, the dough is too sticky to use any other way.

These were delicious! Scones aren't suppose to be sweet, therefore the raters who gave it poor scores for lack of sweetness don't understand how a scone is suppose to taste. These tasted just like the scones I use to eat in London. Yes, they were a bit sticky when I spooned them on to the baking sheet, but it wasn't a mess as some described.  I did use non fat greek yogurt in place of the half and half since I had the yogurt and not half and half. I did not use salt. I also cut the recipe in half using a small size egg.

This tasted great. Next time I'm going to dust them with large-grain sugar, and grease or flour the cookie sheet becuase they stuck to the bottom pretty bad.  My only hesitation to recommend this is that the dough was so sticky I made a bit of a mess getting them shaped and onto the cookie sheet.

This is a good recipe. It is not very sweet, so I made a glaze on the top. I didn't have any cream, so I used skim milk and a tablespoon of butter. The texture was great.  I would definitedly recommend using this recipe.

First read all the other commements and ratings. Now I have a bunch of bland scone-like things to eat. I think this recipe is low on flavor, sweetness, and doesn't make a good "batter". Could be adjusted to taste much better. Bonus is there is room to improve.

I loved, loved, loved these!  I made them with frozen blueberries, otherwise followed the recipe.  The batter was a tad watery and I was kind of worried but when they came out, they looked fantastic and smelled delicious.  They were devoured in an instant.  Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

No flavor!  Also, you can't knead the "dough"... Its much to mushy. In order for me to handle the dough I have to double the flour... which in return gave it no flavor. I'm dissapointed with this recipe.

I agree with other reviewers--these do not have a traditional scone texture.  However, they were really good.  I did as other reviewers did and dropped these on the cookie sheet instead of shaping into wedges.  Also substitued 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream + 1/4 cup skim milk for the half and half.

These are fabulous.  I used white sugar because I was out of brown and just dropped them on a greased cooking sheet using a quarter cup.  I took them out a few minutes before they were done and brushed the tops with additional half and half and sprinkled sugar.  I am embarrassed to say how many I have eaten in two days!

I did not care for these!  They were nearly not sweet enough, for one.  For another, the dough is far too sticky, you won't be able to cut it.  I ended up putting little gloops of it on the sheet as though they were cookies.

If you do make these, I suggest upping the sugar content, and greasing the cookie sheets, as well as using something more durable than a rubber scraper, as mine split in half, the dough was so tough.

I liked this as a base recipe. 1/2 c. of brown sugar as they weren't sweet enough for my husband's taste. I also substituted 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt and 1/2 c. milk for the liquid because I had no half and half.  After dropping by tablespoonful on a cookie sheet I baked them at 350 convection setting for 15 minutes and they were perfect. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe!!  It's easy to throw together and easy to tweak!  I have made these 5 times in the last 2 weeks!  I use a whole-wheat / wheat germ mix for the the flour and I cut the cream to a 1/4 cup and add a 6oz yogurt.  The blueberries are yummie but our favorite is craisens & chopped white chocolate chips with vanillia yogurt...  ummm ummm good!  I usually scoop with a spoon onto the cookie sheet.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have NO idea where I went wrong with this recipe. They tasted ok but when they say blueberry they mean BLUE berry. My scones turned out blue! I used frozen blueberries as suggested by another user so that that wouldn't happen. My boyfriend still ate them, actually they didn't even last 2 days, but willing to give these another go in the near future as I am living with a scone freak.

Elaine K. These are very very good. Could use a touch more sugar though, I didn't have half and half but used fat free milk and they were very tasty. I made a double batch to take on vacation. Hope our friends will like them.

So, I followed this recipe exactly..and the batter did end up being a bit wet and lump. I feel like the baking powder that they ask for is wayyy too much. It makes them taste salt, but not unbearable. This is my first time cooking it, so I'll try out some new things next time (ie more flour and less baking powder)

I've made these several times, and loved them every time...perfect flavor!  The batter is a bit sticky so I just shape them a little by hand after spooning them onto the tray to get that "scone" shape.  Maybe I'll try the extra bit of flour others have suggested.  Great recipe!

I followed all of the instructions the other reviewers left, but my dough was far to dry. Of course when I added more cream they were  far to wet, and so one... I'm not the best cook!

Even though I completely overmixed them (The batter was grey from the smashed blueberries, and I was sure they would look like the "moonrocks" described) they came out perfectly!! They were moist, airy and delicious. This is definally a forgiving recipe.

I followed the suggestions of adding extra sugar and flour and there was still no way to "handle" the dough, let alone "overhandle" the dough.  Sorry, keep looking for another recipe, this one isn't worth it.

These turned out really good and I can't believe something like that was produced in my own kitchen! They looked like store bought scones and tasted just as good. I took the advice of other reviewers and used the extra 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 white sugar. Instead of blueberries, I used cherry flavored Craisins and I dropped them on to the cookie sheet instead of kneading, flouring and cutting. That was much easier since the dough was so sticky that I don't know how anyone would be able to do all that without getting frustrated! My husband thought they were great.

This was an amazing recipe. After making it once I absolutely loved it!

I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and 1 cup of all purpose flour. As well I substituted the blueberries for frozen cranberries. It was absolutely awesome!

Enjoy these!

I always follow instruction to the t but i feel that this recipe is no good. The dough is too wet, not enough sugar, too much baking powder (turns  out too bitter because of that), After I was done baking the scones i couldn't eat them.

These are very nice, and we really enjoyed them for breakfast this morning.  I altered the recipe slightly, based on what I had on hand; I used frozen blueberries and added a bit of lemon zest, did not cut the scones into the traditional triangles (I just dropped dough from a spoon), and sprinkled with a little additional sugar.  The frozen blueberries colored the dough a ghastly blue color (too late I realized I should've rinsed and drained them first on paper towels because when cooked they looked like moon rocks, oh well....), but the flavor was delightful, so next time I will definitely use fresh berries!  I will make this recipe again.

These, so far, are pretty much just what I was craving. I failed to read the reviews before I made them, but I looked at the measurements and knew that I wanted something a little sweeter, so I shook a little extra brown suger into the mixture, and a little raw sugar over the top. They actually came out a little sweeter and lighter than I prefer my scones, but they had a wonderful flavor. (They JUST came out of the oven, so they'll probably get a little more dense as they cool - I hope.) Overall, I would certainly make them again. Oh, also, I didn't have 1/2 and 1/2 on hand, so I used about 1/2 cup whole milk and a huge spoonful of fat free french vanilla yogurt.

The dough was very wet and they baked up dry. The texture was nothing like a scone--it was lighter and fluffier vs. dense. They kinda tasted like bland blueberry pancakes.

This recipe is great with the suggested changes of adding 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour and 1 tsp vanilla.  Instead of blueberries, I used frozen raspberries to try to mimic a wonderful recipe at a wonderful tea room.  The raspberries did make the dough a little more sticky.  Instead of adding more flour, I just drooped the dough with a 1/4 cup cookie scoop.  I also put a light glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and milk on the cooled scones and served them with devonshire sauce and red raspberry preserves.  Rich, but outstanding.

These were delicious! They aren't covered in icing like other scones and they are surprisingly not that bad for you (fat and calorie wise, compared to other scones). I am definitely making these again!

We found this to be a perfect breakfast scone.  It's not as rich or sweet as a muffin.  It has a light inside texture and perfect outer crust that improves with the day.  I substituted Smart Balance for the butter very successfully.

I am giving this 4 stars because it had a great blueberry flavor which we loved.  I do agree with other reviewers this recipe did not turn out like a traditional scone.  It was more like a dense muffin.  But we liked it!  If you are looking for a traditional scone - look elsewhere.  The dough was very wet and impossible to divide into wedges as the recipe states.  Instead, scoop large dropfulls onto a cookie sheet it will work just as well.

These turned out really well, but the blueberries turned the batter blue!  I had to make these for a big group and everyone loved them.  I susbsituted cranberries and a little orange juice for one batch and those were a big hit.

Very good!  Used these at a babyshower/tea and they were a big hit!  I added 1/4 c. white sugar to the dough to make them a little bit sweeter.  I did not knead the dough and just 'dropped' them by Tbsp.'s onto the cookie sheet...turned out great!!

This dough was pretty sticky- but when I shaped the rounds on the floured board, I just made sure to turn the round over to get flour on the entire surface. That made it easier to handle, and they turned out great! Next time I might add a dash of vanilla, and sprinkle white sugar on top, but really they were very good. Great with a big glass of milk or a cup of coffee!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have never made scones before and this one looked very easy and didn't require a cookie cutter (too much work) =).  I followed some else's advice to add vanilla and to hand roll out the scones- good ideas!  I also added a bit of lemon peel to the mixtue and cinnamon on top before baking.  My friend who adores scones thought these were excellent.  More light and fluffy and tasty - not hard or crunchy exterior (like some store bought scones).  I noticed other people's reaction of "very sticky" or "gooey" with the dough.  If you hand roll and powder your hands very well, this isn't an issue at all.  Will definately be making these again (perhaps with a few more mods - less butter, less sugar, add applesauce?...  i dunno)...  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I didn't find this dough too sticky or hard to work with at all, like others said.  I substituted non-fat milk instead of cream, used unsalted butter, and added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries.  Perhaps that did the trick.  The outcome?  Very good, and tastes great with Cool-Whip!

These really had a good blueberry flavor and were very easy to make.  Yes, the dough was sticky, but after mixing I rolled the ball in a small amount flour, patted it down and cut it with my chef's knife.  Another tip is I used my rubber spatula to mix and handle the dough and really didn't touch it with my hands except to pat it down.

The only subsitution I made was using 1% milk instead of the half and half.  I will be making  these again the next time we have leftover blueberries ... thanks!

Too much liquid in this recipe.  I had to add almost 3/4 of a cup more flour to get a dough texture.

My family begs for these scones!  I found it was more like a batter than a dough, so I skip the kneading and just drop into 2 large rounds or 12 smaller rounds.  I have also used raspberries and blackberries.

It was very good. I did tweek a few items  which I do on most any thing I make. I also didn't notice to add the blueberries with the dry ingredients. so I made the dough a bit loose in order to add the blueberries when the dough was mixed. I will add them sooner the next time. The dough was a loose but still came out good.
I probably added    1/3 cup flour , 1/4  cup sugar [ some brown and some reg sugar ]  Used combination of  Light cream and milk  plus a little extra .  I added another half beaten egg . Then coated the top before and after baking with a custom mix of melted  butter, Lemon juice and sugar.  
These were baked at 375 for approx  25 mins.
They came out GREAT  . I will be making them again soon  !!!

It was super sticky like commented before but that made them soft when eating and not all dry and crumbly.  I mixed in fresh blueberries at the end and only mixed with a wooden spool about twice so they didn't get smooshed.

I used buttermilk just because I had that on hand. But think it makes them more moist. I didn’t end up needing to knead the dough. Delicious! Would make again

I substituted the heavy cream with an extra 1/4 cup of butter and the same amount of 2% milk. Also, when kneading I added about an extra cup of flour since dough was too wet. And then I baked the scones for an extra 15 minutes to get them nice and dry and golden brown.  

It turned out awesome! I would totally make it again.

Great recipe! Very easy! I see people are having issues with the wet batter. I took a scone class and she had us put the whole batter on the cookie sheet, bake it, then cut it into pieces when it’s cooled.

This was the first time I made scones and they came out perfect. Dough was sticky but that was fine, I just hand scooped and shaped on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. 
I added vanilla extract, used whole milk instead of half n half, brushed with milk and generously sprinkled with turbinado sugar before baking.  Perfect amount of sweetness.  I  posted a picture because not only did they come out tasting great, they look beautiful!

Turns out this is the Perfect scone recipe once I did some research.  Here’s the three tricks: I reduce the half/half by 1 tablespoon - maybe the eggs I buy are too large for this recipe. Freeze the butter and grate it adding it as the last dough ingredient (right before the fruit).  Finally, mix the dough by hand just enough to make it a bit crumbly. It should not mixed smooth like a cake mix. This gives you that “rough” scone texture.   I also brush the tops with half/half and sprinkle sugar for presentation purposes.  This recipe is actually very versatile and you can add your own flavors.  I used 1/2 c fresh cherries and 1/2 c mini semi-sweet for a “chocolate covered cherries” scone.

recipe needed help, too wet.. I added another 1/2 cup of flour and then 1 cup of oatmeal, still was not able to form patties, so I made mounds... end result is blueberry cookies (my daughter-in-love's term).  I will keep making these for her.

An interesting scone. A bit dry, not sweet at all and not very “blueberry,” but my husband loves it for breakfast. 
Because it’s so wet, just drop onto the pan in the you want and watch the cook time. 

If I make again I’d increase the amount of blueberry by 1/2.

I do not understand how some people got an actual dough out of this recipe. I followed it exactly and it turned out to be more like cake batter consistency.  I had to add more ingredients and even after adding 1/2 c extra flour and 1/4 extra sugar I ended up pouring it into muffin cups and crossing my fingers.  Still in the oven and hoping I did not waste $6 worth of blueberries.  No matter how they turn out I cant recommend this recipe as the measurements are extremely off.

Like others, I had to add almost a cup of flour to even get it out of the bowl. when I divided the dough in half, I left the first round as listed in the recipe (except for the extra flour). It was not particularly sweet, just mostly doughy in flavor.  I added chopped salted almonds and almond extract to the second half along with a sprinkle of sugar on top.  It was better but still not a very good scone.  I rate it two stars because my daughter doesn't like sweeter scones and I thought these fresh organic blueberries were not particularly flavorful, but she doesn't like sweetened blueberries like pie fillings.

I used dried blueberries (what I had on hand) which worked well. I like a little bit of a "drier" scone so the texture for me was perfect.

Very good and easy.  Made it with apple and blueberries combo.  Couldnt make triangles.  The dough was too sticky and soft.  Made drop scones instead. Looked a bit funny but tasted great. Will make them again.

I read the reviews and added an additional 1/4 c flour, 1/4 c sugar and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  The reviewers are correct, the mixture is very wet. Due to the texture,  I placed the scones on the cookie sheet round (no way I could make a triangle).  Ultimately, they came out delicious.  I will make them again.  This was the first time I have ever made scones, so I will experiment with another recipe.  Thank you Linda

Recipe was easy to make. I didn’t find the dough to be too wet at all. It made 8 scones. They weren’t sweet at all, so I put a little butter on top with a sprinkle of white sugar. They came out fine, but don’t think I’d make them again

First time making scones and these came out perfect.  I didn't have any trouble with the batter  being too wet like other reviews. I cut my 6 inch rounds into 8 peices and baked about 14 minutes.  I was also able to refrigerate half the dough and use it the next day.

I unfortunately changed the recipe per the. Comments. I will remake per the stated recipe. The additional flour was too much.

Do try this recipe.  It is wonderful and the end product turned out so tender and flavorful.  The only things I did differently (and only because of preference)was to zest a lemon and add that to the dry ingredients and I made a glaze of the juice of the zested lemon with powdered sugar to drizzle on the baked and  cooled scones.  The tip I read about freezing the blueberries first was helpful. Otherwise, when working the dough they tend to smash up easily.  I may try using plain yogurt next time as a substitute for the half and half.  This dough is sticky and, as with any biscuit, you want to be careful not to work it too much.  Then just  dump it out on a floured surface and pat it out to cut into desired shapes.  Using a bench knife for this step makes things so much more manageable.  Now get back in the kitchen and try this one again!

This was just ok. It was a gloppy and wet mixture which made it challenging. I added 1 tsp almond extract and cinnamon but the taste was just average.

This is the third time I made these scones. I tried both fresh and frozen blueberries and they turned out beautifully. I read some of the suggestions from the other reviews such as adding vanilla and brushing them with half and half before sprinkling sugar.  Great suggestions.  Best of all I’ve received compliments on them. This is a recipe I’ll be using. Thank you.

I found and made this recipe this morning.  I loved it!  I did take a reviewers advice and used yogurt instead of the liquid.  I DID NOT have a sticky gooey mess as others have said they experienced.  But if using the recipe as is, I would suggest using the liquid a little at a time to avoid possible gooeyness.  The lack of sweetness is perfect for adding fruit or even spreading with jam or honey when done.  I think some people have a very sweet tooth even if they don't think so to have to add more sugar to this recipe.  Topping with turbinado sugar before baking is a nice touch.  All in all I would not hesitate to try this recipe and take the extreme negative reviews with a grain of salt.

Yes I used frozen blueberries, added orange zest and didn't have the cream so used Danone vanilla yogurt.  Instead of patting into circles I rolled it into a fat log and cut into 12.

I had to add almost another cup of flour to get the dough to the right consistency and baked them a little longer so they
could get a little crusty.... but they were good and I would attempt it again.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some fresh blueberries, and I love scones. But this "dough" was a sticky mess, even with floured surface and floured hands. Sorry, but I won't make this recipe again.

Over all yummy and easy. I used cream of tartar and bakeing soda instead of bakeing power.  I just think it gives a better rise. I also sifted the flour for a  smooth texture.   Brushed with a little butter and a sprinkle of brown sugar.

It turned out great. I used blueberries that were very sweet, but even so I could see how some reviewers thought it wasn't sweet enough. If it was making it for a party I'd maybe add a light glaze, but this is perfect for my own breakfasts.

I've made scones. I've eaten scones. This was a blueberry hot mess! Dough never firmed up. Needed to add more flour, and even then it reminded me of a science experiment gone wrong. Had to scoop it drop-batter style onto the cookie sheet. Don't recommend using this recipe and won't be using it again!

Loved it.  I did make some changes because I needed to make them Vegan. So I substituted a Banana for the egg. Coconut Oil for the butter and Almond Milk for the cream.  Got lots of compliments.

I added 1 t. each cinnamon and vanilla.  I used frozen blueberries.  I didn't have half and half, so I used 1/2 c. plain greek yogurt and 1/4 c. buttermilk.   I grated the butter into the flour mixture instead of cutting it in.  I sprinkled sugar on top before baking.   With my changes I would give it a 5 star rating.

This was great.  There were some people who said it wasn't sweet enough but I don't think it's supposed to be sweet like a dessert.  I used frozen blueberries because they were cheaper.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as printed.

WOW so tasteful better than muffins for sure...used frozen blueberries from last summer picking, can’t imagine grocery store berries having such a great blueberry taste.

I've made these too many times to count now. Everyone loves them from my toddler to my in-laws. They're easy to make, and quick enough to make a decent snack or breakfast even with very demanding little ones around. My toddler even likes to help make them! I do glaze them as soon as I pull them out of the oven.

I substituted huckleberries and used Crisco for half the butter. 
the crispy texture was perfect with coffee.

When the scones were done and still warm I did a milk wash on top and sprinkled with granulated sugar.  These were the best scones I have ever made.  Very happy with the result.  They were light and lots of blueberries.  I lined the pan with parchment paper.

Easy and delicious! I would have liked them just a little sweeter but they were great! I also cut them into 8 wedges instead of 6. Perfect size! I'll definitely make these again, ingredients I always have on hand.

I've actually made this recipe many times now and it's a favorite in my house.  My kid has begged me many times to make it.  We all like that the scones are not too dry and I just dropping on the baking sheet by spoonfuls.

Very tasty and simple. One of my children does not like sweets (!) and generally does not like this type of food (cakes, breads, muffins, etc.) but she was willing to give this a try and actually really enjoyed them. They are very flavorful without a lot of sugar- a "plus" in my book. I will return to this recipe again and again. I did not add all of the liquid at once, so as to not end up with dough that was too sticky, and they came out just fine when I stopped an ounce or so short of the amount called for.

I was nervous about trying this recipe cause of some of the negative comments i read here but i still decided to go ahead with it anyway. I am SOO glad i did! These scones are not about looking pretty...it's about them being soo fluffy and delicious! Such simple instructions to follow. I didn't use all my half and half cream (equal portion single cream/whole milk) because it would have come out too messy. But that's the test of a seasoned cook i think...add little by little until the mixture is at your desired consistency. So those who were saying it came out too sticky & messy and couldn't be cut...guys...you didn't do it right! If they aren't scones...well i don't care what the name is...what i am eating is deliciousness! :) Anyways...thanks for the recipe and looking forward to making much more!

I'm Irish and watched my mother make bread and scones many times.  I followed recipe, but added a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg/cream  mixture and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour and then mix with spatula and rolled out quickly in one piece and cut into 8 triangles.  Brushed top with leftover egg mixture from bowl.  Agree that frozen blueberries would work better than fresh.
Dough is wet, however you do not need to add more flour, just work with it quickly and use spatula to place on cookie sheet. Yummpy

These have good traditional scone flavor, being not overly sweet.  I made the recipe using frozen wild blueberries. As others mention, the dough is extremely sticky but once you add the frozen berries, it stiffens up. I baked them in an 8 wedge scone pan and because of the frozen berries, they took about 25 minutes to bake.  Very good but to me the blueberry flavor was not strong enough.

I make the exact recipe with cranberries and it is always excellent! The blue berries breaking did cause the batter to be too wet and a little extra flour was needed. Folding the berries into the batter will help.  My scones still tasted good but if you haven't made scones before you may end up over handling them - never good for a scone.

The scones turned out perfect! I always thought scones were hard to make but this recipe was so simple and quick. I used to work at a high end bakery, and the mixture was always wet. It wasn't even hard to work with. I was able to cut it as well. I followed the recipe step-by-step with no modifications. I would DEFINITELY make this again :D

I didn't follow the recipe to the letter... I didn't separate. I put it all in one baking pan. So it turn out a lot more "moist " then traditional scones. But I loved it. Will be making this again.

the one reason I gave it four stars is because they were wet and sticky. I would say add frozen blueberry's instead of fresh and sprinkle white sugar at the top of the dough before you put them in the oven then they will turn out great.I doubled the recipe and it only served five little kids and two adults so if you have a big family double it. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

The sticky mixture didn't bother me much because I was still able to put two "mounds" on a greased baking sheet. It came out with a slightly crusty top and doughy bread. The texture was fine, but this was incredibly bland. Will not use this recipe again.

I loved this recipe, but made changes after reading the reviews.  I used sour cream instead of half and half, added a touch of vanilla and divided it on parchment paper.  I then put it in the freezer for half an hour, allowing it to rise while the oven heated.  I then baked it for a tad longer than 18 minutes, watching it closely after the 18 minute mark.  The result was a  delicious and freezable product that I can pop in the oven for guests or me when I need an accompaniment to tea.

These were my first homemade scones!  They were very good.  I used chocolate chunks instead of blueberries.  Delicious!
The dough was very, very sticky, however.  But the finished project was great.

Great. Pretty easy and tasty. Not sweet so would be excellent with a little drizzle of icing. I had to sub heavy cream for half and half and they are rich and crumbly!

Mine came out great! Cooked exactly per recipe. I popped a little more Brown sugar in there and used frozen blueberries. They are fluffy but dense enough. I should have put the blueberries into the dry mixture instead of at the end. I think that's what dyed the scone. Next time!

Something must have gone seriously wrong with my scones... The dough turned into a mud pie consistency even with extra flour. Forget shaping them, impossible.

First time I have ever made scones. Husband raved that they were fabulous. Followed the recipe, but added a little vanilla. While they were wet, still easy to work with.

My first time making scones..So easy and delicious!! I will definitely use this recipe again and again, only thing I changed was I didn't have half and half, but had whole milk and light cream so I used equal amounts. I can't wait to use this recipe for different flavors. MMM chocolate chip banana, or apple!!

The dough is very wet as others have stated. I added a little extra flour and shaped them on the baking sheet instead of cutting into wedges because the mixture was far too wet. All in all it tastes pretty good especially topped with a blueberry syrup or sauce.

I agree that the dough felt too wet.  However, I stuck with the recipe and had delicious, soft and moist scones with golden crust as the result.  I made them as circular scones, but we'll try shaping the dough into a rectangle as suggested by others next time.

Easy to make and the finished product looked like the picture!   Took the advice of one of the reviewers to decrease the cream to a little over 1/2 cup and add vanilla and cream of tarter.  Maybe not the classic Irish scone but had scones like these in Ireland recently.  Enjoy some variety.

Made these for Christmas morning breakfast. I used almond milk and butter substitute because my son has a milk allergy. They turned out great! I typically like my scones a little more dry than these but they are still really good. I also used frozen wild blueberries. I did read the directions wrong and only made one round cut into sixths but they still baked up great with only 5 extra minutes. Next time I'll make the correct size and amount and maybe they will be more the consistency I prefer.

All u need to do is add lil bit of flour to this recipe to make it more pliable & flour ur hands when handling it.  Also, I did add 1/2 tsp of Almond Extract which gave it a subtle, yet tasty flavor & aroma!  They go great w/hot coffee in the morning...or a cup of milk, warm or cold!! Yum!   I always put a pat of butter on mine & sometimes a tsp of jam, blueberry tastes great on these scones!!!

These turned out AMAZING. I've had mixed luck with scones in the past, either dry or dense or bland, but these were perfect. I did use heavy cream in place of half&half (it's what I had on hand) and I was just shy of a cup of blueberries, but otherwise followed the recipe and the results were absolutely delectable! Light and flaky and buttery and moist. They were even good a few days later, cold! No need for extra butter or jam on these babies, they were just perfect!

Wonderful! I took others' advice and used only ½ cup of half and half. The dough was sticky but easy enough to shape on a floured surface. I will make this again and again using different berry combinations.

Just made them, yummy! I made a lemon glaze that was just perfect with the fruit of the blueberries!  

One change I might make next time is to watch the dry - liquid ratio a little more, it seems the dough was really sticky making shaping it impossible, so they didn't look like traditional scones.

As other reviewers said, the dough is sticky, but that did not begin to describe how wet the dough is! I literally could not handle it (because it was dripping through my fingers) and had to add at least 1/4-1/2 cup more flour just to get it from "wet blob" to "sticky."  As others also found, it had little to no flavor even though I did add 1 tsp vanilla (as others recommended).  I would not make these again.

So good, I cannot stop eating them. I used half cup of sour cream because that's what I had, splashed a little skim to incorporate all the flour. My blueberries were so huge I ended up cutting through them but obviously did not have an impact on end result.

Great recipe! I took the advice from another post and substitued the cream with vanilla yogurt and also added some vanilla extract to give it some extra flavour without too much sweetness. This was a big hit with my family and will definitely make these again.

It was the night before Mother's Day and I wanted to bake something nice for my mom for her day. Now, I know one thing for certain about my mom. She LOVES scones. I don't know anything about how to make scones, so I turn to my handy smartphone and search for blueberry scones. That's her favourite kind. This popped up with great reviews so I drove down to the store and grabbed some ingredients. I was so surprised at how easy this was to make. When I went to get the blueberries from my fridge, though, I discovered I didn't have any. Because I had already made the dough, though, I formed the scones and threw them into the oven anyways. I was scared at the end results without the blueberries. When i tested one, though, it was delicious. It truly is a tasty recipe even without the blueberries. Next time I have a friend over, I will definitely be making these.

Great recipe, first time making scones and these came out great. The dough is a little sticky, just rub a little flour on your hands. You barley need to kneed it anyway. I did need to add a few TBS of extra cream, but otherwise yummmmmm.

I've made lots of scones in my years, but this one just didn't do it for me. There isn't much flavor and the texture is not that of a scone. A blueberry breakfast cake might be a better title for it.

I did not care for this recipe. It is gooy, tasteless mess. Not enough sugar to even tell there is any in it.  Not enough flour to make a decent dough.  A major disappointment on all level that you would expect from a scone.

Used 100% whole wheat flour.  Tender, light and not-too-sweet!  Next time, will substitute 1/2 cup plain yogurt for cream, as suggested below.

Love this recipie.  Mine turned out a little hard to work with but the taste made up for it.  I wasn't making them for anyone other than my family so to look like a scone, wasn't a must.

I am really pleased with the way these scones turned out!  Based on other reviews, I made these changes:
2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (I like Bob's Red Mill brand)
1/2 c. loosely packed brown sugar (usu. I cut sugar down, but I wanted a bit more sweet to balance out the lemon)
3 handfuls of frozen blueberries (frozen fruit always works in baking and doesn't smoosh as easily when mixing)
1/2 c. of Chobani non-fat lemon yogurt
1/4 c. lowfat (1%) milk

I made them drop scones on a Pam-sprayed cookie sheet and they took 18 min.  Otherwise, I stuck to the directions.  

I lived in the UK for 5 years and while these were a bit more crumbly (due to the whole wheat flour, I think) and a teensy bit sweeter than those I was accustomed to across the pond, I think they were a very good *health food* alternative.  Tangy, a bit sweet, moist tasting and delicious with tea.  What more could you want from a scone!  Also lovely served with Polaner All-Fruit Apricot spread.

my first go-round with scones and i'm pretty pleased. what i like is that the texture is buttery and light - not doughy & dense like most bakery scones. i added a dash of white sugar to the mix and also used fresh blueberries. i also used the 'drop' method - worked out great. no dough handling and mess. just a scoop with a spoon and voila. and, one last thing, i made mine small - nicer than the giant pucks!

agree with the other reviewers that this is a great base recipe that you can customize to your heart's delight!

This recipe is amazing and quickly became a family favourite.  I personally love blueberries so I added 1 1/2 cups of it.  Then I whisked together some lemon icing ( 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1 cup of icing sugar).

This recipe tasted good, but the dough was very sticky & difficult to work with. I followed the recipe exactly as directed, but I was unable to knead. After cleaning off my hands, I followed previous reviewer's advise to just mix with spatula & just drop on pan...much easier. 
I will try it again, but add more flour & a little white sugar & not knead.

This is a great recipe. The dough was a little sticky but definitely worth it. I recommend not to knead the dough hard because the blueberries will smush.

When I added more flour, it was too dry, so I added some vanilla and a little water. I put in a little white sugar and covered them in vanilla sugar. I made the scones a little too big, but they were still delicious.

It's all right. It did need more flour, but with more flower came more of a cakey taste and it overpowered the taste of the berries. So I was left with no choice but to add a glaze that I made up from the top of my head.   There too wet and don't have enough sweetness to them. Definitely use frozen berries, brush the tops with some melted butter and some sugar in the raw for a second attempt.   It's a good starting point recipe but needs tweaking.

These worried me because it was so sticky but I went through with baking and they were quite good. They did need a little sweetening so I dusted with powered sugar.....yum

These scones were a big hit. I did not have the problem of the dough being too moist. It was quite dry actually and came together perfectly. I followed the recipe very closely!! I also did not grease my baking sheet and they came off perfectly!! Easy to cut and after about 25 mins of baking they were done just right! :)

Very good, easy.The only thing I added was to sprinkle sugar on the dough before baking. The scones were not sweet so the added sugar did the trick. Great recipe!

LOVE this recipe! I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/4, a little bit of vanilla extract and the scones were delicious! They did not last the evening between my household of 4 :)

I liked this. The dough was too sticky to knead, but otherwise seemed fine. I made this with blueberries AND a half a bag of white chocolate chips. It solved the lack of sweetness issue perfectly! My husband loved them!

Great recipe. I also added about 1/2 cup more flour and the texture was gooey but turned out perfectly. I also substituted half the flour with whole wheat and added about 1/4 cup shredded coconut.

As scones, these did not work out, but it made good blueberry muffins! the "dough" came out more like a batter it just got worse the more flour i added. so if you like blueberry muffins then this is the recipe for you!!

I found this to be an amazingly easy and tasty sconce that my whole family loved.  I served them warm with blueberry jam and butter.  I did improvise and change the the recipe a bit using half and half instead of the cream and frozen blueberries that were heavily rinsed and drained. Also I lightly sprinkled the tops before baking with raw sugar granules.  I found yes, the mixture was a tad sticky but that is the beauty of it for the sconces were light not heavy like many sconce recipes.   To combat this stickiness just dust the dough and your hands with flour.... and like any sconce or biscuit recipe handle lightly for best results, just a quick blending and form your dough and voila !  This recipe produces a more traditional sconce that has just the right amount of sweetness ...not too much like many do. Remember this is a compliment to tea and is served with jam and butter. Maybe next time I will use a little lemon zest to comliment the blueberries but otherwise this is a great recipe and thanks for sharing.

This is really good I have been trying to make blueberry muffins that taste better than the boxed mix but haven't had much luck.But these are just what I wanted. I made them with half fresh ground whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. I added too much liquid so I had to knead in more flour and I used half frozen and half dried blueberries.  Over all YUM! and I hope next time I will get the liquid right so the texture will be better.

This recipe is better suited for a dinner scone, not a breakfast scone.  The recipe is not sweet, and lacks the flavors needed to compliment the blueberries.  It would be better as a cheese scone or other type of dinner scone.  For a blueberry scone, this recipe is bad.  Unless you do not have a sweet-tooth at all.

Now...I didn't necessarily follow the recipe. I have a tendency to do that. I supplemented some of the flour for flax seed and rolled oats. I also substituted the cream for no fat plain yogurt. Soo... that's that. But I do think it need some citrus flavor to counteract the blueberry.  Something just a little too plain about these.

This was my first attempt at making scones and I have to say this was a great recipe.  I was searching for a recipe with raspberries and this one was the closest.  It worked well with frozen berries and I had no trouble with the batter.  I will be trying this with other fruits in the future!

Although I like the bland taste of a scone, I wished this one had been just a little sweeter. To fix this I made a glaze of powdered sugar and milk to drizzle over them.  They were excellent!  I made them in the wedges, had no problem with the dough and they looked perfect!!

The end product tasted good enough, but this recipe definitely does not create true "scones."  They're more like muffin tops.  I took everyone's advice and made the suggested changes, but unlike all other recipes I have made (which always turn out fabulously), these still did not turn out to be all that great.

Made these with wild cranberries and strawberry yogurt (instead of the cream) and they were great.  Didn't bother shaping them - just dropped them in lumps on the baking sheet.  Will definitely make again!

LOVE this recipe! So easy to make and they taste soo good. I bought a lot of fresh blueberries while they were in season and froze them in 1 cup portions so that they are easy to use. The dough folds together nicer when the berries are frozen...less get mashed up.

As stated earlier, this recipe is on the wet side so I simply spooned them into twelve on two sheets.  They turned out perfect and tasted very good.  My family really enjoyed them and I will definitely bake them again!  I did not think these were too sweet, which is a good thing since my hubby doesn't like stuff that's real sweet.

Delicious!  I did have to add a little flour to shape the dough.  I also used 2% milk.  I added some lemon juice to the milk for flavor then realized I had made buttermilk.  oh well.  they turned out excellent.  Had them with some scrambled eggs and a cup of coffee!  Excellent breakfast!

I could not shape these like other reviewers, so I spooned them onto the baking sheet.  They do not look like traditional scones, but they taste great.  I used 2% milk instead of cream.

I can't understand why anyone wouldn't love these scones?  I recently brought these to a bridal shower and they got RAVE reviews - and they're so easy to make!  They're real scones instead of the sugary ones you'll find at coffee shops and the blueberries add just enough sweetness.  I didn't bother with dividing and cutting the dough into triangles.  Instead, I just spooned them out into mounds as it seemed much easier and a lot less messy.  I will definitely be making these again and again!

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of putting them in a scone pane. And got a very yummy end result. I decided to top mine with some lemon glaze I had left over in the fridge. Don't let the mixed reviews fool you these are good stuff.

The reviewers who rated it highly probably have not had real scones, or have their own personal sorcerer on staff to make this recipe remotely workable or edible. The "dough" isn't dough--it's practically batter. It is also tasteless. I had to try to doctor this recipe numerous times, after trying test batches at every stage.

I would recommend only adding 1/4 C more flour. I added Vanilla in with my milk. And I used frozen blueberries so they wouldn't squash so much. And heaped my brown sugar. Very yummy.

For this recipe, my only problem was the mushy dough. Reduce the amount of milk to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. You should be fine.

First off - this batter is NOT too sticky!  I heeded warnings of sticky dough and made sure I handled it as little as possible.  I tossed the blueberries (fresh) in gently and used cream instead of half and half.  My dough didn't turn out discolored at all and it was easy to split the dough in half and form the discs.  I used only ~1/8c of flour extra to flour the cutting board and my hands.  I also brushed them with additional cream and sprinkled them with raw sugar after baking for 10 minutes.  I typically don't make scones and thought this was a very easy and successful recipe!  Not too sweet like the scones at the coffee shops that might as well be doughnuts.  The scones did turn out a little cake like - not as dense as I prefer.  Other than that - YUM!!!

The dough was REALLY sticky. I left the first batch to go into the oven basically as is in the recipe, which left them spread out and tasted more life muffin. Which wasn't bad, but not what I was going for. When I added more flour, it maintained a shape but tasted bitter. I would recommend you tweak this recipe if you want it proper scones.

These were pretty good.  I did make a few changes though.  I used 1/3 white sugar in place of the brown sugar.  Instead of the half 'n half, I used 2% milk; I used frozen blueberries (they were easier to work with).  Kneading this dough is impossible because of the consistency of the dough, so I dropped the batter onto a sheet pan.  When they were baking, the batter did spread out like cookies.  I would still make this recipe again, however I may follow the ingredients just as they say.

This recipe was great, although I had to add a bit more flour to get an acutal dough. I also brushed the top with some cream and sprinkled sugar on top before baking them. Thanks for a great, simple recipe!

These were just ok, unfortunately.  They were hard to mix and turned out good right out of the oven but the next morning were kind of spongy.  Overall, a bit more biscuit-y than scone-y.

These are not scones...More like cake consistancy.  These were very bland.  I added more sugar...still not enough.  More salt maybe??  They were more moist than the orange cranberry scones I made yesterday with sour cream (at least those looked like scones).  I went ahead and did not add more flour and went ahead and plopped them onto a GREASED cookie sheet, about an inch apart and they spread right into each other like cinnamon rolls.  I will keep searching for a scone recipe to my liking.

This is not a bad recipe but I would recommend improving the ingredient ratios so it is easier to handle.  It is not a dry scone so, if you are looking for that variety...look elsewhere.

No offense, but these turned out really bad for me.  My sister && I made them just a while ago.  Easy to make, but didn't taste good.  BUT, it could be because we only had frozen blueberries && not enough baking poweder.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe. I think I would add a little more sugar and perhaps not even use brown sugar at all. It is a good basic recipe though and I think that I will use it again and switch things more to my liking.

I had difficulty with these. I used heavy cream instead of half and half (what I had on hand), but I did use frozen blueberries. The batter wasn't terribly wet, but I did have a horrible time getting everything well mixed. I couldn't figure out what was going wrong (never had this problem before) and I ended up kneading so much just to get a decent mix that the blueberries still burst and my hands froze. In the end the taste was good, but it's not something I would make for consumption outside the house, on account of the very messy appearance. In making again I think I will have to rely on my mixer.

Quick and easy, even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Used milk instead of cream, and divided the batter - did 1/2 with frozen raspberries and the other with fresh OJ and rind. Both were nice, not too sweet. Added a splash of vanilla. Roomies loved them.

These scones were really good right out of the oven but got that stale taste and texture by the end of the day which is why I give them only three stars. They were also very fluffy and light which is not what I want a scone to be. Think of these more as blue berry biscuits.

These are very easy to make and soft and yummy.  I used heavy whipping cream and doubled the brown sugar.  I used fresh blueberries and they didn't break up.  This recipe is for drop scones, but that's easier anyway.

Well, I made this as exactly the recipe followed; the only difference was that I replaced flour with whole wheat. The scones are bit bland, but I definitely taste the blueberries....perhaps next time I won't use whole wheat flour.

I don't know what I did differently than everyone else who reviewed this, but my scones didn't turn out too moist to shape and cut into wedges. Somehow, mine went the opposite direction and the dough was so dry I had problems getting it all to stay together. It kept falling apart into a crumbly mess. The finished product was tasty enough, but very dry, even for scones. I'd need to tweak this recipe a bit before I make it again.

This recipe produced great scones, but only after making some changes to it (after reading other people's reviews). That's why I only gave it four stars.
As suggested, I added another 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of sugar. Also, the batter is better as a dropped batter -- I just made six large free-form scones. No flour or kneading or cutting necessary.
Next time I think I will also add more blueberries.
Overall, the scones came out great and were a big hit at breakfast today! Will definitely make these again.

I made this last night and it turned out awesome. Thanks so much for posting the recipe. My local store sells blueberry scones that are to die for and they have some sort of icing on top. It would make these a 15 out of ten if i could find a recipe for that icing. But very tasty w/o icing.

My family really liked these scones. I used 3/4 cp of heavy whipping cream and 1/4 cp 2% Milk. I want to add a bit more sugar also. They won't be too healthy but they'll be delicious.

I made these according to other reviewers' suggestions, and added 1/4 c sugar, tsp vanilla, and 1/4 more flour.  They were WONDERFUL.  I think they could be made without the extra flour, but I like my scones moist.  The batter is sticky, and makes a better drop scone.  If you like flavor and texture this is your scone.  If you like 100 year old dry biscuits with your tea, try another scone recipe.  This recipe is EASY to make, but hard to keep around because every hand in the house is rushing to grab another before they are all gone.  Thank you for submitting, I was looking for a very moist scone recipe, and this one is it.  It is similar to my favorite scone at a local tea house where I grew up. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!

I made these exactly as written and they turned out great.  They were moist and yummy, although the dough was very sticky, as others have said.  Next time I will probably try adding the extra 1/4 cups of flour and sugar just to see how it works out!

I found these to be quite tasteless and dry. Not enough brown sugar was used and it was hard to shape the scones without squishing the blueberries.

Great recipe!!  Made some changes. Used just about one cup of DRIED blueberries from the bulk section of our natural foods store. Added just under 1/4 cup of white sugar (in addition to the brown) and about 1 tsp of vanilla to the cream/egg mixture.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly.  I had no problem at all with the dough being too sticky?!?  Not sure what the other reviewers’ problems have been.  Maybe the extra sugar helped, or the dried berries soaked up some moisture.  I also brushed the tops with beaten egg white and sprinkled with raw sugar.  Everybody loved them.

I think these were pretty good scones.  The dough was really sticky though, but I didn't think to add more flour.  However, when they came out of the oven, they were nice and tasted really good with scone texture.  And it wasn't too sweet, which was good for me.

great breakfast treat if you have extra blueberries.  The dough was very sticky.  So when I divided the dough in half I baked one round as the instructions said and other round I added ~1/4 cup flour and knead until the dough just became non sticky.  The family taste test concluded the round with addtional flour added was the best.

This was my first time making scones.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries. THe dough was VERY sticky--I added more flour. Also, the scones were not as sweet as I like them--rather bland actually. I added a suger glaze after they came out of the oven which made them pretty good. Next time I will add more suger to the dough.  End result was good!

I found this dough very sticky as well and also just spooned it onto the pan. I found they stuck to my ungreased cookie sheet and they werer not sweet enough for my liking so I sifted icing sugar on them when they were cool.

It couldn't have been easier!! I was a bit apprehensive while making the dough, it was very doughy and sticky but came out delicious!! Definately will make again.
