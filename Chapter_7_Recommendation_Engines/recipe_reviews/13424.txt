I omitted the cabbage, used the carrots, celery and onion without cooking first; omitted sage and used the spice packet from beans. I made a double batch as the bean bag was 16 oz. and adjusted ingred. accordingly. I tossed everything in from the beginning except the ham steaks, which I cut up and added the last half hour. I cooked on low for about 12 hours - Perfect! I did end up blending about 4 c. of the soup to add some substance, it was fantastic this way. A keeper.

I used this recipe as a base for my "normal" stovetop 15 bean soup. I used the leftover ham bone from Christmas supper (with LOTS of meat left on it), and some extra cooked ham - added near the end. The meat literally fell off the bone!! I omitted all the spices and used the "ham flavor" seasoning pkg that came with the beans, two bay leaves, two teaspoons of minced garlic, and black pepper (to taste). For the veggies - I used carrots, onions, and celery. This was my first attempt with a slow cooker (the 7 qt. one was a Christmas gift!!), and it turned out better than my stovetop recipe!

Very easy to make and good, but not great.  I will make it again but I'm going to add some more spice.

This recipe definitely makes alot.  I had to use 2 crock pots.  I found it to be just okay and I wouldn't make it again.  With the onions, cabbage, 15 kinds of beans it is definitely one to give you gas.

This is a good recipe for experimenting with a bag of 15 bean soup. Instead of ham hocks and bacon, I use a pre-cooked ham steak. I cube it and add it in the last half hour of cooking. Also, I add the juice of a half a lemon at that point.

Very hearty with a distinctive taste.  
In the process of preparation and after 
it was served there were numerous 
request for the recipe.
A "must try" for busy bean lovers.

No one in my family liked this soup particularly.  It was too "tomato-y" and the chili powder was a bit overwhelming.  This recipe makes A LOT.  It was, however, much better several days later.  The tastes seem to blend well and weren't so overpowering.  I would recommend making a day in advance, at least, and you've got a 4 or 5 star soup.

We loved it ...

Instead of water, I used chicken broth and 
I used two lbs of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage...

then topped it off with cheese and sour cream...

My first time cooking with a ham hock and making a second attempt with dried beans. It was a success...I blended about 4 cups of the soup to thicken it up a bit...very good soup!

Good recipe.  I used 1 and 1/2 bags of beans and after about 3.5 hours, I took 4 cups of the beans and veggies and put them in the blender to make the soup a little less brothy and a little thicker like I like my bean soups.  Make sure to adjust the chili powder to your liking.  I served this with home made french bread from the bread machine and a small salad.  It was a great autumn comfort food dinner!!  Thank You~~

I followed recipe exactly, but added some diced ham for the last 2 hours of cooking.  Used a bag of cole slaw instead of small head of cabbage, it was just a lot easier.  I liked this soup a lot.  Takes a good 10 hours to get the beans right, but worth it.  Made it on a lousy cold rainy day which made it even better.  Will make it again.

I made this recipe according to the directions.  The chili powder was overpowering, so I would recommend cutting the amount down and adjusting to taste.  The cabbage tasted like an odd combination with the other flavors, and I would have preferred the soup not to have the cabbage included and would've added celery, potatoes, and more carrots.  The directions should say to cook the vegetables in a large pot until the cabbage is cooked down because the addition of the cabbage can't fit into a normal sized skillet and can't be cooked down properly.  The amount of ingredients can cause your slow cooker to boil over.   This makes a large amount of soup and would most likely feed a larger crowd than six.

I am giving it two stars just because it has healthy inexpensive ingredients....honestly, it broke my heart. I have never thrown out food that wasn't spoiled, but this was terrible. I love every ingredient in it, but together it was a mushy tomato-y tragedy.  I followed the recipe to a T.  It I thought it was my error, I would attempt it again, but it just wasn't worth it.

The taste is wonderful, but the smell of cabbage cooking in your crock pot is not to my liking.  It still tastes great, but I think I'll skip the cabbage next time.

This is outstanding!  My 2-year-old ate 3 bowls.  The only complaint I heard was my 9- and 6-year olds ... "Where's the meat?"  Leftovers got bacon pieces, next time I'll add some smoked sausage or kielbasa.

Not bad but not memorable either.  All that chili powder dominates the flavor!!  Can no longer taste the flavor of the ham & the beans.  Easy & cheap to make so I will use it as a foundation but tinker w/ the flavors next time(s).

I skipped the ham hock, cabbage and chili powder and most of the spices.  Instead I added mild Italian sausage that I browned first.  That added plenty of seasoning.  My whole family liked this the first day, but no one wanted to eat the leftovers. I liked it, but won't make it again for awhile.

Use a ham hock, not a ham steak so you get the flavor from the bones.  It will really add a depth of flavor.  This recipe is similar to the one on the bag of 15 bean soup, but with carrots and cabbage added.  It's Exactly like I always make mine and everyone loves it.  If you use the flavor packet that comes with the soup, don't add extra salt or you will be overwhelmed.  I don't use the packet, the flavor is better without it.  Top it with fresh diced onions and eat it with cornbread and you won't be disappointed.

Not sure how to rate this....with so much other stuff especially cabbage, tomatoes and chili powder, it hardly resembles bean soup.  I use the 15 bean mix, the flavor pack that comes with, ham bone, cumin, sage, minced garlic, and salt & pepper and about a half cup of sherry at the end.  I use an immersion blender and it gets thick, smooth and delicious.  I score lovely ham bones from my local Honey Baked Ham store.
