Delicious! Only changes I had were: didn't have any onion, so added some green onion w/ plain yogurt on top of finished meal as garnish; and didn't have Thai chili peppers, so used 2 serrano peppers instead (WARNING: seed them!) So yummy.

Very tasty, the salt amount is perfect.  My kebab meatballs did not hold together at all even though I added an egg to the mix.  Adjustments:nd 
1/2 a large sweet onion.
2 teaspons ground coriander instead of 2 T seeds.  This just seemed like a typo to me
Didn't have yogurt, wanted to use up

As I was not prepared to make this dish and just happened to spontaneously try it, I did not have many ingredients. 
I used grounded pork instead of lamb
Had not plain yogurt, so I used vanilla favored.
No coriander seeds, so I used celery seeds
Also I had no turmeric, so I used worcester sauce instead.

I have to say that it did turn out really well. very tasty! I can't wait to try it with the actual ingredients.

Fabulous! I follwed the ingredients exactly, except after reading the reviews I added 1/2 of bread crumbs and one egg  because the meatballs felt a little loose on the skewers. Great dish. I paired it with cinnamon basmati rice.
Delish!!

Loved this recipe, followed it to the tee. Meatballs don't hold together well but as I am avoiding wheat decided to just go with it. They did ok.  I added green peppers, mushrooms and sweet potato to the skewers and tossed them with a little olive oil and the same spices as the meatballs turned out delicious. Full meal without the rice.

this came out very flavorful and bold.. i had to modify the recipe based on what we had on hand.. subbing ground turkey (20 oz package) for the 1lb lamb.. 1 1/2 jalapenos.. leaving the seeds/vein in the 1/2 jalapeno.. i only had 1/4 of an onion so i added 1/2 tsp of onion powder.. i began crushing 1 tbsp of coriander seeds and it just looked like too much so followed cookingpanub's lead of just using 2 tsp of it ground.. i didn't have any yogurt but think it might have given that bit of sour flavor i was looking for that the lemon didn't really provide.. i added 1/4 tsp of salt to accomodate for the extra 4 oz of meat, but i felt like it still needed more salt at the end.. these were good as burgers with some mayo, lettuce, tomato and a sprinkle of salt.. ty for the recipe

I used ground beef because lamb is just too expensive. I like the flavours but the meatballs just did not stay together. As soon as I put the skewers under the broiler, some of the meatballs started to fall off the skewers. When that happened, I took them out and cooked them on stove top instead. That was a little disappointing...
