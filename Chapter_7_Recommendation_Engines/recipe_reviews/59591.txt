I have made several recipes like this. Here's a few things to note. #1. When it cools, it gets hard. Like chewy caramels. Reheat it. #2. The longer you boil it, the THICKER and, later, CHEWIER it will get. You'll know when it has reached the point where it is no longer just a bunch of stuff in a pot and has become a sauce, because the color changes and the entire texture of the mixture changes abruptly. #3. This mixture grows in volume to about 6 times or more what you originally put in there. Use a HUGE pot and don't walk away from it. If it's getting too high, remove from heat, stir it down, reduce heat, and put it back. #4. The baking soda doesn't make a "bitter" taste. Burning the vanilla does. Remove from heat, and stir it until it doesn't bubble anymore, then stir in the vanilla. That "bitter" flavor is what happens when you burn vanilla, in ANY recipe. I hope these tips help someone; this is a fabulous syrup/sauce/caramel ice cream topping/cheesecake topping/whatever you want. Thanks for the recipe & the excuse to make another version of this totally sinful sauce!

After sampling a buttermilk syrup at a local farmer's market, I thought I'd try and track down a recipe I could make at home. I am soooo happy I found this recipe. It's very similar and doesn't cost nearly as much to make as they were charging at the market ($7 for a little tub!) I am going to make & bottle this up for my neighbor's for Christmas present, along with pancake mix. Thank you so much for the fabulous recipe!!!----2nd Review: K, I made this a 2nd time & purposely omitted the baking soda. It's sooo much better. It doesn't have a bitter, baking soda taste like the first batch & it's a pretty, white color. It does have to cook a little longer & thickens up upon sitting on a heating pad off the stove. I like it even better the 2nd way.

This syrup is heavenly!  I never thought buttermilk could make such a yummy caramel sauce, but every time we make this syrup, it's a huge hit.  Just beware of how it doubles or triples in bulk as it boils and use a large enough pan.

I make pancakes almost every morning and had buttermilk on hand, so i decided to try this homemade syrup (instead of the usuall store-bought kind). This syrup is heavenly. It's so much better than store-bought syrup and it's easy to make.  I always save leftovers in the fridge and heat it up when i want to use it again.
FYI: Lately Ive brought the sugar down to just 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups and it still tastes very sweet

So YUMMY! I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 2 1/2 t of lemon juice to 3/4 cup -2 1/2 t milk and let it sit until thickened.  I wasn't sure if this would work but it did and hey less calories! Thanks!

Ridiculously good. I started a small kitchen fire because I forgot to cook it in a big pot, so remember to do that.  But really, if my house had burned down and all I managed to save was the syrup, it possibly would have been worth it... it's excellent!

Simply amazing! I didn't have corn syrup so I used 2t corn starch and 1T flour to thicken it and after it cooled it thickened. This syrup is wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone.

This makes a beautiful caramel sauce. To avoid accidents, I made this in a large enameled cast-iron bean pot, and was thankful I did. When this foams up during cooking it seems to triple in size! I let this cool to warm room temperature and served it with vanilla ice cream, blueberries, and a sprinkle of freshly ground sea salt. This might sound strange, but the salt with the caramel was fantastic and turned out to be one of our favorite desserts ever. Thank you!

I had a little extra buttermilk from making buttermilk pancakes II (yummy!) so found this to try.  I made it on a day when I had too many pots on the stove so I cooked it on very low.  The phone rang, people came to the door ... in general I was *very* distracted the entire time.  I kept the burner on low until the butter melted, stirring occasionally, then bumped it up to 2, then 3.  It foamed but I didn't realize that was probably "boil".  I actually turned it off when the interruptions got too much.  When I came back, I thought for sure it would be ruined but it was perfect!  So if you are worried about it boiling over or burning or not being able to stir it as often, try cooking it on very low.  A little more time needed but it turns out great without as much babysitting!

I'd like to give this only 4 stars because it was really, really, really sweet if it were not for the fact that it was really good. I would definitely not add as much sugar.  Possible even just 1/2 a cup.

This is just an ok version of a Buttermilk Syrup recipe.  By tweaking a few things, the results yield a fluffier, cream-colored syrup which is far superior in my opinion.  Try this: combine 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup butter in sauce pan.  Boil for 3 minutes, remove from heat and add 3/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Stir until blended and voila, awesome syrup!  Adding the baking soda AFTER boiling really does the trick.

I grew up calling this "Caramel Syrup".  My mom made it every time we had Danish Aebleskivers, and now I make it all the time for my family.  It is our FAVORITE!!  We don't just use it for Aebleskivers, we use it on pancakes, waffles, french toast...you name it!  It is incredibly sweet but incredibly delicious.  It's hard to have store bought syrup when you can make this!  If you've never tried this syrup, be prepared for your tastebuds to do a little happy dance!  BTW...if you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can make a substitute of "sour milk" by pouring about a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice in the bottom of the measuring cup before adding regular milk - let it sit for about 5 minutes, and presto...you will have curdled milk that works just as well as true buttermilk.  I rarely buy buttermilk and always use this method.  I actually do it using canned milk.  Works like a charm!  I do this for every recipe that calls for buttermilk and it has yet to fail me.

Very good. Better than store-bought syrup. I read most of the reviews. Most said it was too sweet even at 1 cup So, I reduced it to 1/2 cup of sugar. If you are unsure, add 1/4 cup at a time to reach desired sweetness. But, for me 1/2 cup of sugar was perfect!  The second time I made this, I reduced the boiling time just so that all ingredients were dissolved. There was a less caramel taste and more of a buttery taste. Boil for 7 minutes if you want that caramel taste, or boil until just combined for a more buttery taste.

Great caramel-like flavor!  Make sure to use a larger saucepan than you think you'll need, because it boils and foams up quite a bit.  Doesn't seem like it would be good with the buttermilk, but it is soooo yummy!  We used the leftovers on vanilla ice cream!

Turned out great in spite of the fact that I had to substitute milk + vinegar for the buttermilk (1Tbsp vinegar per cup of milk) and maple syrup + a splash of rum for the vanilla extract since I was out of both! Made only 1/2 the recipe...ended up adding a bit of milk at the end to thin it a bit so it was pourable, but better that than the other way around! :) Made it to go over Blonde Brownies I on this site as recommended by another user to recreate the Applebees Blondie sundae!

Great recipe. For everyone who wanted to omit the baking soda, DONT! You add the baking soda to this for the same reason you add it to dulce de leche; to prevent the milk proteins from curling up on them selves. With out the baking soda your syrup will be grainy. I would also suggest to add a few heavy pinches of salt to round off the sweetness and bring out the vanilla.

Once you've had this syrup it is hard to go back to anything else. I think it is best on waffles, but it is also great on pancakes or french toast.   The secret is to turn the heat on high until it starts to boil, but then gradually reduce the heat to low to get a nice, slow boil. This will keep your syrup as smooth as possible because if the heat is too high for too long the sugar burns and adds a grainy texture to the syrup.

Wow! Amazing! The first time I made this I cooked it at a boil for 7 minutes. This resulted in a candied carmel dip. The next time I tried it I brought it to a boil then simmered for 5 minutes. It turned out perfectly!!

I made this as written - but I clearly didn't read the cooking instructions correctly.  After I brought it to a boil, I continued to boil for 7 minutes rather than cook for 7 minutes.  It got very very thick, as in caramel consistency.  It had amazing taste, but not what I wanted for syrup.  I asked for help from the "AR Buzz" and someone told me to heat on low until it softened and add some more buttermilk.  That did the trick.  This picture was taken before I thinned it down.  The flavor of this is out of this world.  We really liked it on ice cream with peanuts and bananas last night.  That is probably how the rest of it will be eaten.  I will make another batch of this and cook rather than boil for the 7 minutes.  Thanks Alissasmom for sharing your recipe.

Whomever said that she would save only this syrup if her house burned down was not kidding!  I made this with only one exception:  I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp. maple extract as I wanted something a little more  maple-y for our pancakes.  I don't think it mattered all that much, though, because the carmel flavor still stood out.  My kids LOVED the syrup; my 11 year old daughter stood at the stove with a spoon eating it right out of the pot!  Next time I will double the recipe because I always make extra pancakes to heat up for the kids' breakfasts on school mornings.

I decided to do a 1/2 recipe of this to try it out. I got what tasted more like a "caramel sauce," than a syrup, in taste and texture unless that is what buttermilk syrup really is. I really liked the taste of it before it boiled the full 7 minutes and got too thick. However, a part of me feels like it is probably because I cut the recipe in half, so I don't suggest doing that. I would also use the largest saucepan, because this more than doubles in size when boiling. I may try again with the full recipe and maybe not boil it the full 7 minutes or at a lower temperature to see if I can get more of a syrup then a caramel if that is not the case. As a caramel like sauce it tasted good although when I follow directions for syrup, I expect to get something similar to what I know as syrup.

This recipe was super easy and delicious!  I was wondering if homemade syrup would make a difference on my pancakes, and it definitely did.  I didn't use any baking soda (as another reviewer had suggested).  I served this with chocolate chip pancakes.  Yummy!!!

Awesome. I like to make homemade syrups and different kinds of pancakes.  I don't normally like to use corn syrup but there wasn't a whole lot in this recipe sooooooo  I tried it.  Very foamy when cooking it.  After trying the recipe several times I used brown sugar instead of white and used milk from our bulk tank.  Turned out caramelly and sweet Just as good.  Love this recipe. Thanks

I have had this saved for some time but never made it before now. I followed the recipe exactly and I must say this is wonderful. It reminds me of pralines and will be excellent on my pancakes tomorrow. I had read that it was better if it sat for overnight so I made it today. I did not taste any bitterness nor is there an aftertaste. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Made this one morning when we were out of the store-bought syrup and I had some buttermilk left in the fridge (this is rare, I don't often use buttermilk).  My 8 year old said it was "the best syrup he's ever tasted" and we won't be buying anything from the store again!   
My assessment was- a little less vanilla (made it too caramely) and if you dissolve the baking soda in water before adding it to the other ingredients it's easier to work with. 
All in all...I will definitely be making this syrup again and again!  Thanks for the easy, delicious and far less "chemical" syrup that my kids (and I) both loved!

after reading other reviews it had to be my own fault so I feel bad giving such a poor review but this was just bad. it was first of all white not even brown, there was a weird film over the top like it wanted to be brown but couldnt quite make it, it was super thin, it was WAY too sweet and actually upset our stomachs after eating ... I am not quite sure what I did wrong but after looking at pictures there was something.... I guess just be warned of sweetness( and we are a sweets loving family...)

I use a recipe that is very similar to this one (minus the corn syrup and half white sugar and half brown sugar for a deeper flavor) and we love it!!!  We eat it on french toast casserole, bread pudding, ice cream, tires.  ;o)  It is simply decadent and wonderful!  Definitely a keeper and something a little out of the ordinary to serve when you have guests.

Had no buttermilk but needed to make syrup as the pancakes were done and the children were waiting when I saw we had not bought more at the store. I made this with regular whole milk and the children had seconds (they are picky too) so I am really grateful this turned out as well as it did.. 6 stars from this house! Definitely use a very big pot. Yum! This recipe is phenomenal.. I've used it over and over. I store it in a mason jar when not using... and definitely use your biggest pot or it will boil over.

Heaven...seriously.  So so good.  Made exactly as written.  I had a huge jug of buttermilk left over after making my cousin's b-day cake and no idea what to do with it.  Came across this recipe and really wasn't expecting too much because who ever thought of making a syrup out of buttermilk!?! (yes, I'm sheltered)..but this was creamy, caramel-y, deliciousness.  I put this over buttermilk pancakes and it was fabulous, but I also make a delicious baked french toast from this site that I think this would be perfect on as well. YUM and THANK YOU!

I ran out of maple syrup and needed something quick and easy that I could make while my french toast was cooking.This was great. I only needed enough for 2 people so I scaled the recipe back to 2 servings and it worked just fine. I just didn't have to cook it as long. I made my own buttermilk with whole milk and cider vinegar (because I thought the cider flavor would add something) and it tasted great. My husband said he was impressed. I think I'm just going to make this from now on!

I haven't made this yet, but I was served it over hot, fresh blueberry pancakes at the home of my cousin.  It was so absolutely delicious, I haven't stopped thinking about it since that morning.  Now, I'm going to make it for my own family.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe :)

I never knew it could be so easy to make syrup at home!  I used sour milk (vinegar and milk) since I didnt have buttermilk...it turned out fabulous! Dont' think I'll ever buy syrup again!  Used it for pancakes this time, next time, I think it'll be a great topping for ice cream!    keep in mind...it does bubble up quite a bit!  Use a large pot to accomodate.  yum.. thanks!

This tastes like a warm caramel! It went perfectly with my caramel apple pancakes this morning! I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  And yes, PLEASE use a large pot to make this! Even after reading the reviews, my pot, which I thought would be plenty big, just barely held it during the foaming stage. It starts off a little thin, but thickens as it sits. I made it before I started the pancakes and it was perfect when they were done. By the time it cools it is the consistency of caramel ice cream topping. YUMMY!! Thanks for this treasure!

I love this stuff... can't get enough!  Not just for breakfast either, try it over ice cream, apples, other desserts...  I'll even put a splish in my coffee sometimes!  I do typically cut back on the butter and sugar a bit, and if you're looking to make it taste uber gourmet add 1 ts cinnamon and 1 tb hazelnut syrup (like the kind you put in lattes) and it takes it to a whole other level!!!  Keeps well in the frige for a week or more and reheats easily in micro (apx 30 secs) so make the full amount, you won't regret it!  And to make it slightly healthier, try using powdered buttermilk or low-fat buttermilk.  And DON'T skip the corn syrup... that's what gives it the sheen you want and corn syrup we buy in the store is NOT the same thing as HFCS (common misnomer).  Also, I think it takes longer than 7 mins to get the proper "syrup" consistency but it does also thicken upon cooling.  TIP:  Use a MUCH larger pan than you think you need (remember that old elementary school science experiment with baking soda added to vinegar?  Buttermilk is acidic and you have similar results here but not as dramatic).

I love this recipe and make it any time I need syrup. I made it again this morning and did not have any butter,I used organic whole milk in place of buttermilk, and I use honey in place of corn syrup all of the time..It still turned out WONDERFUL!

DH loved the syrup so I'm rating a 5 as he suggested.  It tastes very much like caramel.  Thicker than I anticipated.  Good flavor on pancakes, and I imagine it would also work on french toast.  We both think it would be great on ice cream.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.

Well it sounded good anyway. I had to remove this from the heat with still 2 minutes on the timer. I used med heat instead of med-hi and this was looking dark and smelling toasty and I was afraid of burning it. Well, what turned out was candy not syrup. It hardened and we were unable to eat it. I had to soak the pot and the spoon in hot soapy water to "melt" the candy off. I should have just added some roasted peanuts and called it "messed up peanut brittle". Nothing was salvagable on this.

Very fun to make-- I wasn't expecting the syrup to foam so much! I added the vanilla before the boiling by accident, but it still survived. It made exactly 2 cups! My only complaint is that it's a bit too sweet, and would taste better with crepes than pancakes. Thanks for the recipe! ~Bae

We loved this syrup!  I was looking for something to jazz up my zucchini bake and this was perfect.  Blended nicely with the flavors of the roasted red pepper and the sausage.  Another great recipe to add to my arsenal.

This stuff is fantastic! Definitly make sure you use a very large sauce pan since this syrup boils up pretty high.

This is incredible! I did not have corn syrup so I just omitted it. I also used powdered buttermilk instead of regular buttermilk. Even with these changes it was fine!

I've made this recipe several times, and it's always wonderful.  It also makes a GREAT caramel popcorn if you pour it over popcorn (and I like to throw in some almonds) and bake it in the oven, stirring intermittently, until it's just the right stickiness.  Really, it's the best caramel corn I or my husband have ever eaten.  Give it a try!

OMG ... this stuff is GOOD!  So buttery, caramel-ly, and delicious!  Almost more of a caramel sauce than a syrup.  I have to warn those of you out there "without" a sweet tooth - that this stuff is very sweet.  I see that other reviewers have cut back on the sugar - but I followed the recipe exactly, and loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Halfed recipe. Substituted buttermilk with 1/4 c. plus 2 tbsp. milk with 1 tsp. lemon juice, let stand 5 minutes and substituted honey for the corn syrup. I am sure glad I ran out of store bought syrup today and tried this recipe.

5 stars for ease of making. 3 stars for consistency. I like my syrup to be like "REAL" maple syrup (Grade A is thin & like water) and this was more like a sauce so I added 1/2 cup more buttermilk. I give it 6 stars for its rich, caramel-like flavor. If you don't like real sweet, you won't like this. Although a maple syrup "lover" and purest, I now prefer this. Absolutely delicious!

oh my gosh... ooey gooey caramely goodness! use a large pot because it bubbles several times it's size and you don't want to waste a drop! (or make a horrible mess) Excellent on pancakes, ice cream, or eaten straight out of the pot with a spoon. Oh wait, did I say that? :)

I make this syrup ALL the time. I didn't get the recipe from here originally, but I lost my old hand written copy, so I use this one now. Today, I used powdered buttermilk instead of regular buttermilk, and it was still just as delicious.

This is heavenly!  My husband, who wants everything simple and the same every single day, groaned when I told him I was making homemade pancake syrup.  I really did it out of necessity since we were so low on our store-bought syrup.  Needless to say he love it and won't eat store-bought anymore.  Plus he raves on and on to everyone about how great it is and that it's the best he's ever had.  Thank you, so delicious!!

I just tasted it 5 minutes after cooking so this is an early review.  However, it is delicious.  While it is still a tad warm my daughter dipped cut apples in it and agrees it is fantastic.
I will update my review if tomorrow I try it and edit my 5 stars but if it is good as it is 5 minutes out that won't happen. LOL

I've made this recipe a few times and I absolutely LOVE it!  So easy to make.  I always use homemade buttermilk.  (there's no point for store-bought buttermilk..it's expensive and I end up not using an entire box)  For homemade buttermilk, place 3/4 TBSP vinegar in a measuring cup.  Fill it up with milk (I use 2%) up to the 3/4 cup mark.  Let it sit for 5 minutes.

Holy carp...was this ever good.  This is definitely a five star recipe.  Who knew?  Apparently 260 other reviewers.  This rave review is comingfrom a CANADIAN who loves her some real maple syrup.  This stuff is super tasty!  Buttery sweet ambrosia on my pancakes!  As other reviewers pointed out use a large pot to contain the foamyness, the buttermilk will curdle but it comes out fine and it gets much thicker as it cools.

Perfect syrup!!! I LOVE it.  As others have said use a BIG pot.  It expands as it is cooking, then retracts when it is away from the heat.  PERFECT!

I never want to eat syrup from a bottle again. I can't believe this has been missing my whole life! I've yet to find a person who doesn't love this recipe. I think it goes best with waffles but it really tastes good on anything. Try it on warm sopapillas!

Utter perfection. One of the best recipes on this site. I have also used a vanilla bean instead of the extract. The vanilla seeds are visable and the wonderful vanilla flavor sends this great recipe over the top!

Absolutely delicious light caramelly tasting syrup.  Easy to make, delicious on our Blueberry Pancakes, but I am thinking it would be stellar on Pecan Pancakes.  We refrigerated the left overs and used it cold as an apple dip...yum!

This recipe is really good! Be sure to stir constantly as directed and cook for a smaller amount of time if you are decreasing the serving amount. Keep in mind while deciding when to take off the heat that it WILL thicken after cooling down a bit. I added a little almond extract and ground cinnamon to mine because I love those flavors on my pancakes. SO GOOD and EASY! You could also add a little maple extract if you wanted to for a bit of a maple flavor. Or for a twist, Orange extract! Possibilities are limitless!

This was soooo good! it reminded me of a taffy my mom made when I was a kid. It was so easy to make! I kinda freaked when it bubbled up, but it never went over the edge of the pot. :) I added 1/8 tsp. of almond extract with the vanilla. WAY GOOD!!! :) I'll be making this again!

I dont know what happened my syrup didnt turn out well. The taste was great but it was too thick. I let it boil for the 7 minutes. I was  still able to use it on the blueberry oat pancakes I made. But it just wasnt syrup consistency.

Ohmygoodness. This is divine. I used half white sugar and half no-calorie brown sugar. It was still really sweet so after it had cooled a bit and I saw how thick it was going to be, I added about 2 TB of butter and stirred it in as it cooled the rest of the way. It was perfect!

I had some buttermilk leftover from another recipe and decided to give this a shot. WOW! I've never had syrup this good (I'm not a maple lover) my family just loved having hot homemade syrup with our weekend pancakes. I had about half of it left over so I put it in a jar and kept it in the fridge and 4 days later it was still just as good. Just pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds and you're good to go.

Really good. I don't write many reviews, but this was so quick and tasty - nothing to it. I followed instructions except using brown sugar, which I will do next time Also it is very sweet, so less sugar next time as well. I tossed in a partial handfull of chopped pecans which really added good flavor and a crunch. In this case the sweet was a wonderful foil to raspberry pancakes.

Fantastic taste! I actually ran out of vanilla after 1 tsp. so I used maple extract for the other one and I'm glad I did. The only complaint is that it needs to say a LARGE saucepan in the recipe. I used a medium one and it boiled over while I was making my waffles. There was plenty left so I saved it to use again this week.

I was out of maple sryup and happened to have buttermilk on hand.  I was looking for ways to use up the buttermilk and decided to make this recipes along w/ buttermilk pancakes.  It was delicious!!  My kids raved about it, my daughter suggested to dip popcorn and pretzels in the sryup, I'm sure that would be good too.  I made the recipes as written.  Definately recommend you try this!!

Mmmmmmmmm!! This is OUTSTANDING! I had some buttermilk to use up so I went searching on this site for things I could make. I found this syrup and buttermilk banana bread. This syrup is heavenly! Even before I added the vanilla I kept taste testing and it was so good just the way it was. Sort of tasted like sweetended condensed milk. YUM. But after I added the vanilla, it was even better! Almost like a buttery caramel candy. I planned on serving it on ice cream but let me tell you, it was excellent on top of the banana bread!

Really delicious.  I live in China and buttermilk is not available so I used buttermilk powder.  Worked great!  The first time I made this, I cooked for too long perhaps.  It was thick (like molasses) so I reheated in microwave with 1/4 cup of water.  Turned out just fine.

I made this after I read from another user that he/she would eat this til they went into a diabetic coma because it was that good....and it IS that good! lol ?
I made a few changes after reading the reviews.  I wanted a more caramel flavor, so being in France I substituted and decreased sugar amount to 1 cup La Perruche Cassonade Pure Canne sugar instead of white sugar.  I didn't have buttermilk so used 1 tbsp vinegar w/1 cup Viva brand milk and it sat for about 10 minutes before I got to it.  I don't know if they have corn syrup here, so I used 2 tbsp honey instead.  I didn't boil it the full 7 minutes once the sauce thickened into a beautiful caramel color, which took me only 5 minutes since I think my electric stovetop was on the med-high side.  I stirred it often while it was cooking making sure nothing was stuck burning at the bottom of the pot (use a big pot because this will bubble up while cooking, but the bubbles will dissappear when it cools and you stir it).  
It is devine.  Not too sweet for me, but my husband's palate is more sensitive so he thought it was still too sweet.  My son gobbled it down w/his pancakes and cinnamon apples.
It has been sitting now for about a little over an hour and the sauce has thickened even more.  
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! I won't be buying store bought w/all the preservatives anymore!  My family and I appreciate it!

Great tasting homemade syrup with natural ingredients. I omitted 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, corn syrup and baking soda. Tasted just great, I just didn't need the excess ingredients.

WOW! Where has this been all my life!? Of course everyone loves this, and we would call it caramel sauce rather than syrup, but whatever you call it is is fabulous! We made it last weekend out of necessity as we were out of conventional syrup. The only down side, is that it is so easy to make that you will want to make it all the time and put it on everything. As the day goes on, if you have any left, it really thickens and softens and reminds me of the caramel on an apple, or the caramel sauce that Starbucks puts on your macchiato. I just had it with some sliced apples, and I bet it is divine on ice cream. YUM!

I kept tasting this as it cooked, and it was yummy. The next day I made pancakes, and while the syrup was good, it seemed to me it would be better as a topping for something else like cake or ice cream. The flavour is very caramel, and I prefer maple on my pancakes. 
I must stress, it is a wonderful flavour; just not the best thing for pancakes in my opinion.
........A few days later.......This syrup keeps well in the fridge, and I decided to give it another try. It does seperate, and must be heated and stirred before using. I made french toast, and liked this syrup a whole bunch more than the first time. So it's either growing on me, or it's better on french toast than pancakes. Also, I tried sprinkling it lightly on salted, buttered popcorn, and that was good.

Made a half recipe, but in the end I thinned it a bit with a little more buttermilk.  Stored the leftovers in the fridge.  I think this would be great on  ice cream or apple pie ala mode, but I served it with the German pancake recipe.  If nobody is watches when you eat the leftover syrup the calories won't count- just a theory.

this turns out more like a caramel sauce because of the long cooking time, I also left the baking soda out until the very end, otherwise it makes it too frothy in the begining and leaves a skin on the top. What I did was mix the first 4 ingredients bring it to a boil, add baking soda and vanilla and cooked 10 seconds. Oh yeah and don't use margarine, it does not turn out!

I followed the recommendations and made this with 1 1/4 cups of sugar, which was ample. This is the finest syrup I've ever tasted; I cannot recommend it enough to all you folks out there in Internetland. Just make sure you have a fairly large pan when you make it - it does foam up!

I used this recipe when my kids were little and then somehow forgot about it.  We recently rediscovered it and we don't use regular syrup any more.  I use powdered Saco buttermilk for the fresh buttermilk since I never have fresh on hand.  Delicious!

Oh, this is good stuff!! Intructions are straight forward and easy to follow. All the warnings about the expansion of the syrup as it cooks absolutely needs to be heeded.   If "buttermilk" in the name is confusing you, forget it, just think Wonderful Carmel Sauce and you have exactly what this is. Thank you Alissasmom!

This is so good warm over waffles.  After it's been in the fridge for a day it thickens up to a wonderfully thick caramel sauce to serve over ice cream.

AMAZING. It caramelizes if you cook it the full length of time. Yum. :) If you're looking for that sweet and foamy buttermilk "syrup" (the only kind I'd ever had), just don't cook it as long.

What syrup-y goodness this is.  One suggestion, if you are giving this as gifts.  Let it cool after cooking and skim the top layer off.  What's left is darker and clearer syrup.  If you leave it it taste the same but doesn't have the same clarity or color.

The only thing that I did different was put honey in place of the sugar. After trying a couple of different syrups...this is BY FAR our favorite! Even the picky eaters like it. I will not be buying syrup at the store anymore. Would be EXCELLENT for an ice cream topping. It was wonderful on waffles too! Thank you for sharing.. (definatly use a LARGE pot....the bubbles get BIG)

Super! My mother always made homemade syrup and I've never found any at the supermarket that compare...even "real" maple. But I have to say, this is even better than hers! My hubby and I loved it; although it will have to be an occasional treat because he is diabetic. We had it with the Eggnog French Toast from this site and it was memorable.

Make it with brown sugar for a caramel-y taste that's to die for.  I love this syrup and we hardly ever use "regular" syrup anymore, this is even better.

This tasted good but nothing like a "syrup" to me.  I have made many of the other "syrup" recipes from this site and many are very good and easy to make.  I followed this recipe as stated except for cutting to 8 servings.  This was easy to make and didn't taste bad.  This was very thick and caramel-like in texture and taste.  Would but much better for an ice cream topping.

So easy, rich and delicious, I will NEVER buy syrup again!  Don't be apprehensive about using the buttermilk, the finished product tastes nothing like it.  I have used 2% milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice added, and that worked just as well.  I've also made it with brown sugar instead of white, and the results are a more pronounced "caramely" flavor and a bit more of a grainy texture, but it was still equally well received.

So good!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  We tried it on "Banana Pancakes l", very yummy.  But it really really shined on "Wheat germ, whole wheat pancakes".  This is a little bit of breakfast heaven!!  Sooo Yummy.

Wonderful. I cut back on the sugar a little bit, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. Easy to cut in half too if you don't want to make a lot. My personal preference is to use this syrup as a dessert topping, say for ice cream or a pound cake. I kept it in the fridge for a couple of weeks, and it kept fine. The only thing is it hardens up in the fridge, and then you have to heat it up to soften it--not a big deal, though, since it tastes better heated anyway. It also seems to get a grainy texture after a while in the fridge--but it still tastes great.

This is wonderful!  I didn't have any corn syrup so I used 1tbsp of corn starch.  We try to eat low fat so I only had skim milk on hand. I added a little lemon juice to the milk and it worked great in place of the buttermilk. Also I didn't have the butter, I used 1tbsp of  Smart Balance light spread and added butter flavoring at the end to make sure it had that buttery taste, although, I don't think you really need it it's rich enough.  One more subsitute, I used 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  I think I'll cut down on the white sugar next time, really sweet for me but my kids loved it.  The extra sweetness, thickness and carmel flavor worked GREAT with whole wheat pancakes, however, which can and extra kick sometimes. I would like to try cooking it a little longer, to thicken it a bit more, and pour over popcorn and pretzels and bake for a few mins.
I don't see me ever buying store bought syrup ever again.  I'll use this one over and over!

The BEST syrup--this has become my family's favorite!  Love it on whole wheat pancakes, Belgian waffles, French toast, or anything you would put maple syrup on.  I made it for a church breakfast and received many requests for the recipe!

Loved this recipe...if you cook the full seven minutes on full boil then you will end up with caramel, just turn the boil to a light boil for seven minutes, or better yet use a candy thermometer and cook to 220 degrees and you will not have a problem with it turning to caramel. Only ONE BIG PROBLEM if you cook this syrup you will never go back..or pancakes will always be lacking if you ever try to have them without this syrup"! I speak from experience.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe! Honestly, the best syrup I've ever had. I'm not even gonna buy store bought anymore. However, we only used a cup of sugar (and I STILL think it could have used less--it's VERY sweet) and we added an 1/8 tsp cinnamon. It was very thick, so I think it could use some water in there, too, but not much. We put it on french toast and it was just PERFECT. Thanks!

USE A BIG POT> when you add the baking soda it froths a ton and if you're using a smaller pot it might overboil.  Also I use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of any white and it's great!!!

I didn't want to add corn syrup so I just left it out. I don't think it's necessary as long as you cook it long enough. Very nice flavor and pretty caramel color. I might get some maple abstract to give it a more traditional maple flavor, but overall we really liked this. It's nice to make something with simple ingredients to replace the store-bought syrup full of "stuff"

I made this recipe yesterday, followed directions exactly, did not change a thing and it was perfect. Actually it was fantastic!. Refrigerated it overnight and heated up some to go on pancakes made from scratch this morning and it was out of this world. This is a wonderful recipe and definitely a keeper. My sister in Tucson will be making some today. I told her that she will not be disappointed. By the way, for those who said it was sweet well the fact that it is a syrup should have given you a clue. I can't wait to serve it this Saturday when I make Lemon-Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes (from scratch.
I plan to double the recipe next time so I can give some to my daughter. ALISSASMOM thank you for this delicious, perfect and wonderful recipe.

I have made this recipe a LOT, long before I found it posted here, and have even made it in the last few years with Whey Low Sugar Substitute (don't try it with other sugar substitutes though, like Splenda or Nutrasweet -- it will NOT work!).  There are two keys to it -- don't cook it ANY longer than absolutely necessary, just watch for the color and texture to change and remove it from heat IMMEDIATELY, then stir in the vanilla (not before or it will be bitter)and use a BIG pot or it will boil over and you will have a real mess on your hands.  It should be light colored like caramel, not dark brown.  And yes it does get hard when it is cold but you can warm it up in the microwave and it will remelt -- just keep an eye on it.  Stores well for months in the refrigerator but portion it up in small jars as repeated heating will thicken it.  Great stuff!  Try it as a glaze for a cake or stir in pecans and use as a sauce for ice cream -- yummy!

Really good!  If you don't have corn syrup on hand, substitute honey, molasses or both.  Changes the taste slightly, but it's still wonderful.  We had this with Baked Pumpkin French Toast for Thanksgiving breakfast.  They are perfect together!

My husband loved this, but I gave it 4 stars because I had to make some changes. I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and it was still on the sweet side. Also, I pulled it off the stove after 5 minutes of boiling (not 7) and I'm glad I did. It was just the right consistency when cooled. Any longer on the stove and it would've been too thick. Overall, I will definitely be making it again.

OMG. I will never buy store syrup again! As others have mentioned, it does puff up when you're cooking it. The recipe didn't mention whether or not it needed to be stirred while boiling. I know if you're making candy you don't have to, but I wasn't sure about syrup. So I stirred it once and awhile. Every time I stirred it it seemed to turn more brown. 

This was wonderful and I will definitely make it again because it's so easy.

have only made fruit syrups on my own, never a regular syrup. this was incredible! i used vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla ext, it gave the syrup a beautiful vanilla bean-flecked creaminess, and also added a few tsp. cornstarch to thicken it up a little. Perfect, and keeps well in the fridge. My boys loved it!

Great for french toast. The butter solidifies in the fridge, so it needs to be re-heated.

This syrup is a welcome change from the grocery store sticky goo to we usually buy! I did use a LARGE pot to make this in because it will boil up! I don't even think I let it boil the full 7 minutes, when it was the color and consistency I wanted, I took it off the heat. Keep in mind it does continue to thicken once off the heat! Will make again!

Have had this recipe in the past, but lost it. SOOOO glad to see it here! In the past, I had run out of vanilla, so I used almond extract instead...WONDERFUL substitution, and gives it a slightly "toffee" like flavor. Well worth a try.

I misplaced my regular buttermilk syrup recipe, so I decided to try this one. It did make a great caramel sauce, but it wasn't a great buttermilk syrup. Too thick for french toast. I tried to reuse it on ice-cream, but it just hardened. :)  If you are looking for a thick caramel sauce, then this is a good find - a good buttermilk syrup, it is not.

I am certainly no chef, but I am a bit of a foodie, and this is one of my favorite recipes ever.  I have made this SO many times, it is considered a standard item in my fridge.  It gets raves across the board. The first time I made it, it was for a Christmas brunch, served over the fluffiest waffles.  YUM!  After that I figured we should have it instead of storebought syrup, as storebought syrup just doesn't compare.  I have made it several times using a 50/50 Stevia/sugar mix and there is no notable difference.  It's amazing over an oven pancake (another Christmas recipe turned throughout-the-year treat.)  Also, I always make it with buttermilk powder instead of liquid buttermilk, and it's always amazing.  Keeps in the fridge for weeks, just reheat to liquify.  Do use a BIG pot as it foams quite a bit.

Should be called "Caramel Sauce" as that's what it tastes like - yummy goodness.  I used 1 C sugar and served it with pumpkin pecan pancakes and the whole thing tasted like pecan pie.  Delicious treat.

I made this to pour over my pancakes, but after the first taste, I realized that this is too good for pancakes, it deserves to be poured over homemade vanilla ice cream or even homemade chocolate ice cream.  People have raved about the flavor whenever I serve it.

This sauce was good but I definately wouldn't use it on pancakes. It's really thick, very sweet, and more like a caramel sauce then a syrup.  I would use it on ice cream or drizzled on apple crumb cake.

Wow! I originally saw this recipe in conjunction with another recipe. It sounded quite interesting and I made it. Is it wonderful! And I can think of about 100 uses for it. We used it as a caramel sauce over a very plain cake and have used it to dip apple slices into. Unusual, and wonderful! Thank you.

Absolutely excellent!!! I made the recipe as is, and it was great! It is extra sweet, so I also might reduce the sugar a bit next time, but I think I won't buy expensive syrup again! I always bought the all natural syrup, and it is great, but expensive! Thank you for sharing!!! :)

We made this to go along with french toast.. this made an incredibly decadent breakfast! Not sure if I'm willing to put myself through the sugar coma and weight gain that's linked to it, but it would be a nice treat to have on very rare, very special occasions.

I should have read the reviews about using a large pot - I had to switch pots twice!  But it was definitely worth the extra dishes and will make a great sauce for my banana splits.  Yummy!

This is so yummy! Didn't know it was going to foam up so much, but I managed not to boil over! I had it on pancakes, might use it on ice cream later, it is sooo sweet!

I've made homemade syrup for years, but every time I do my husband's stomach gets really bothered.  So I tried this recipe that has less sugar (I only used 1 cup), used the milk/lemon juice trick for the buttermilk and my kids and him all loved it.  He didn't get sick like he usually does and he was surprised.  This might be my new go to syrup recipe.  THANKS!!

Made recipe this morning.  Used reduced fat buttermilk, light corn syrup and 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  It has a great carmel flavor that I bet would taste great over ice cream!  Linda Farrell, St. Louis, Missouri

I made this syrup for a camping trip last summer and it was a hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe and we usually have a bottle of it in the refrigerator.  Every so often I will use honey instead of corn syrup and it works out just fine.

This stuff is fantastic.  Huge hit with the family.  Hubby hates syrup, but had 2 helpings of this.  I used evaporated milk, as it was all I had.  I also added 1 tsp.cinnamon.  Definitely a keeper!

At first, I was only going to give this 4 stars because it is very, very sweet.  But, when you add this to your buttermilk pancakes, the taste in the syrup compliments the taste of the pancakes perfectly.  This will get 5 stars in my book!  Also, when you make this, use a large sauce pan.  I used my medium size one, and I was over flowing so I had to dump all the ingredients into my large sauce pan.  This will be great to serve to my guests!

I just finished making this syrup and tried it on top of a blondie with vanilla ice cream, applebees style. It was delicious! I'm going to try the rest of it on some buttermilk pancakes tomorrow. I used half white sugar and half brown. It gave the syrup a nicer color. It is on the sweet side, but that's what I expected with syrup. I'll probably cut back to about 1 cup of sugar next time, but it is fantastic the way it is.

5 stars just aren't enough for this Yummy sauce.  Be warned this super rich sauce is extreemly addictive.  Easy to make and better than any syrup I have ever tasted and as a native of Quebec, I have tasted quite a few! I use it for pancakes, waffles, french toast, pound cake and any other excuse I can think of to use this decadent sauce!

OH...MY...GOODNESS!  I finally tried this recipe after my mom kept raving about it.  I didn't have buttermilk but used milk with vinegar.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  I don't see how this recipe could have any less than a 5 star rating.

I had 10 kids overnight for my daughers 11th birthday and breakfast was homemade waffles.  They were NOT getting my real maple syrup to spill, so I started the hunt for a syrup to make.  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with the most amazing results that were better than using maple syrup at all!  The kids loved that I served it up hot and that it was homemade.  I also made another one from this site, but the buttermilk syrup was the favourite.  I did screw up and put the maple flavour in this one instead of the other one though, but WOW this was good.  I made it again to have in the fridge and used 2% milk and 35% whipping cream instead since I didn't have butter milk and to be honest, I didn't notice much of a difference in taste.  Thanks so much!!!

Made ½ recipe on March 3, 2008, wished I had made the whole one.  So good.  Sliced a banana and swirled a little sauce on it and topped it with some Redi Whip Cream.
So simple, good and versatile.

My husband and I had this tonight for our pancake supper. My husband hates buttermilk and anything made with it. So I used 2% milk and soured it with lemon juice. Hubby raved about it and wants it to be the only syrup we use. After he said that I told him about the sour milk but he still liked it. Also I cut the recipe to 6 servings. I will be making this again.

This is always a request from my children for any special holiday meal involving pancakes. Use a large pan because it does double in size while boiling , great over french toast fingers (a recipes i got off of here ) and vanilla ice cream

This syrup is WONDERFUL!  It can make anything taste great.  It's rich so would definitely compliment pancakes, french toast, etc. 

I wish I could give this recipe more than five stars!

This syrup was really good.
But, I did change it alot.
I don't eat sugar, so I substitued the sugar for 1/2 a tsp. of Stevia.
I changed the corn syrup
(YUCK) to molasses and that's it!
It was really good-but WOW does it expand when you throw that baking soda in there-I wonder what that is for????

Thanks!

All I can say is wow! I am glad I was brave enough to try this recipe with my leftover buttermilk. My husband and kids LOVED this. I am asked to make it all the time now. Make sure to use a LARGE pot! This will boil over otherwise and be careful not to over cook it. Thanks for sharing this!

I don't know how the original recipe would have come out but i am giving it a 5 cause the way i did it came out great anyway :) .First of all i didn't have any buttermilk, i live in Italy and i just couldn't find it, so i used fresh cream instead.Second i couldn't find any corn syrup either so i just put 3 teaspoons of cornstarch and a bit of honey.Let me tell it it tastes divine and the consistency is perfect.Never gonna buy syrup again!

This syrup was very good.  I omitted the corn syrup because I didn't have any & I boiled it for 9 minutes instead of 7 for a darker colour.  I also added just a tiny drop of maple syrup instead of the vanilla.  The consistency and flavour was wonderful.  The whole family enjoyed!!

Absolutely the best syrup. Does not taste like buttermilk. Very easy to make and is pretty. Come out a rich caramel color and has a light caramel flavor and is creamy. Not to sweet. I used a 3 quart saucepan and kept wisking to control some of the foam. I did have to turn heat down a bit. Everyone loved this. I probably will not buy syrup again.

Wonderful!! My husband is not a "breakfast eater"- he doesn't usually eat pancakes, waffles, etc.  But when I made this syrup he ate waffles every morning for a whole week!!  Just be sure to watch it as it cooks so it doesn't boil over.

This is the best syrup I've ever made.  I've made it 3 times already.  It's a bit pricey with the butter, but it is soooo heavenly.

Thanks so much for a wonderful addition to the breakfast menu! Easy to prepare and tastes very delicious! 

At another reviewer's suggestion, I used a larger saucepan than I thought I needed ... and I'm glad I did.

This is sweet and carmely and very good! Make sure to use at least a 2 1/2 qt. saucepan to avoid having the syrup boil over. And if you stir it occassionally while it's cooling, it won't get a skin on top. This is also great as an apple dip.

This recipe is amazing. My roommates and I had a French Toast breakfast and made this recipe. Everyone present raved about the syrup and wanted the recipe. I've also found that this tastes amazing on ice cream too.

This is great!  I had this syrup with Pecan Pancakes. I used powdered buttermilk and a bit more corn syrup and it was wonderful! Really rich and carmely!  I bet it would taste great on ice-cream.

This recipe is soooo yummy--I've made it several times and it's a big hit around here.  I actually made it yesterday and cooked it about ninety seconds too long because someone came to the door.  I thought I'd ruined it, but it turned out even more delicious--more of that heavenly caramel flavor.

Great alternative to maple syrup! A little on the sweet side though... I may decrease the sugar next time, but it was still a hit in my house.  Make sure you keep stirring the syrup as it cooks or it will catch and burn (not a pleasant smell).  Also, let it cool slightly and thicken some before you pour it over your pancakes... it will give the flavors a chance to really combine.

This is the best syrup I've ever had!!  It makes ANY pancake or waffle FABULOUS.  I made extra and put it in an empty syrup bottle.  We keep it in the fridge, and heat the bottle in boiling water before using it.  Lasts forever!  SOOO good!

This amazingly delicious, but I wish it were a little more runny so you could pour it.  It kind of tore up our pancakes we were trying to spread it on.  And when it cooled it turned a bit grainy, which was really frustrating. I have a coconut syrup recipe that also has baking soda in it and it to gets  grainy when it cools.  I think I'll try this again and just omit the baking soda and see what happens.

Absolutely delicious!  I like to cook it until it's a medium caramel color which took longer than the suggested 7 minutes.  
This is similar to the syrup found at a popular bakery, and it's so simple to throw together, just make sure you use a much larger pot than you think you'll need, between the boiling sugar and the foaming from the baking soda, this gets pretty big.

Use a large pot because it foams up to more than twice the size.

I messed up the recipe and it was *still* delicious. I accidentally left out the butter. I discovered that fact when I was cleaning up; this was after receiving rave reviews of my own. I used powdered buttermilk and it still achieved the right tang. I served with crepe-y pancakes and chopped pears. Next time I might add a shot of whisky to the finished product.

I love this syrup. So easy to make. I just stored it on the fridge until ready to use. Just a note: if you cook it too long, it will go to candy stage and become hard and chewy. It's great on popcorn too.

Excellent. Corn syrup, however, is getting substituted for sugar into every kind of food, it seems. Not that it was the case here though. I cannot use any corn products and was shocked how corn syrup and corn starch are in so much of our foods--even vitamins, for Pete's sake. My point is you can just add a little extra sugar--I did not do so, however--and it will still become this delicious syrup if the directions for cooking are followed. I might try and swap a little brown sugar in next time just for the heck of it but this already is the best caramel or butterscotch type syrup I have ever made or ingested. Thank you for this recipe!

I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to try it.  After reading the reviews and hints from others, I used large cast iron pot, reduced heat after came to boil and whisked A LOT!  I did add the baking soda during the cooking process and the vanilla after removing from heat.  I continued to whisk for a few minutes....it really helped the color to darken.  Wow!!! This syrup is addicting!!!!  Will definitely make again.....and again!

This was excellent. Wife and kids all loved it. I was a little disappointed because I was looking for something different, but this is just a very good caramel sauce. But if your looking for a good caramel sauce this is the one.

Excellent flavor! I wouldn't change a thing. The only tip I can give is be sure you use an extra large pot because when this mixture boils it will expand and easily boil over.

I added the vanilla and the baking soda after it boiled. Next time I'll double the recipe. We are a family of 5 and needed more syrup. This recipe made a little over 2 cups of syrup. I used a large pan and still had plenty of room.

Did everything per the recipe except I only cook it for about 1 minute once it starts to boil. This keeps it from turing brown and over caramelizing.

Absolutely love the syrup, and yes, it does taste like caramel (it's supposed to!). The soda, however, is a problem. We tried adding it after the syrup had cooked. It still bubbled up, but not as significantly. We couldn't detect any difference in the flavor. If your batch is too thick, cook it a little less long next time. Adding a little milk after it's cooked can also help thin it to syrupy consistency if overcooked.

A delicious syrup that's a nice break from store-bought kinds. Be sure to make it in a tall pan as it does increase in size as it cooks.

Delicious! I started with a medium saucepan that seemed plenty big enough for the ingredients, but had to transfer to my large pot midway because this stuff just kept getting bigger and bigger the longer it cooked.

This is great! It was  the first time I've ever made  homemade syrup. Happened to have all the ingredients. What I did different compared to the recipe was; first I melted the butter in the pan when it was melted, I added the sugar and stirred it up at the same time.  I let it melt with the fire medium to low. (I used real butter) While the sugar was melting, I put in the corn syrup and blended it in. I let it come to a boil and simmer stirring occasionally. Once it came to a boil, I mixed in the buttermilk a little at a time. I let that come to a boil stirring occasionally... after about 5 minutes I mixed the baking soda. Be careful because the baking soda will make everything foam and rise, so its important to keep mixing it at the same time, take it off the heat and pour in the vanilla. Doing it this way will keep it from getting hard. My image was taken after it had cooled down :)

If you are looking for traditional maple pancake syrup this is not it. However, if you are looking for a wonderful alternative to buying syrup at the store that is full of words you can't pronounce, this is for you! I was looking for an alternative to store bought processed syrup and my family loved it. LOVED IT!  Like they won't even entertain the idea of buying syrup ever again. Major tip here is to cook it in a large pot. Do not underestimate how much it foams up to the top of the pan. Also, I exactly double the recipe and it turns out great every time. I have never had any trouble with it thickening too much.

This is so delicious  !! Came out perfect. I used margarine  instead of butter and added a pinch of salt. We put it on pancakes. I think it would be good on vanilla ice cream. Turned out perfect. Be sure to use a large pot. I used a Dutch oven and watch your cooking time. If you boil it longer it will become to thick. YES I will make this again.

I halved the recipe since it's just my husband and I. He really loved it. I used buttermilk powder and water for the buttermilk. And I was SURE before I started this that I had corn syrup. I couldn't find that bottle anywhere. So I used real maple syrup. It got really thick, but that was probably because I used a lot of buttermilk powder. It tasted good with it, but made it too thick.  When it first came off the stove it was the perfect thickness. Then as it cooled, I could have made little square caramels. In fact, While I was waiting for my pancakes, I kept eating it like candy. And it tasted magical on pumpkin pancakes. 
UPDATE: With the extra sauce (which is thick as peanut butter) I heated in microwave and spread on graham crackers. Very very good!

Very easy and good.  If you don't have buttermilk, you can substitute milk + vinegar.  But, it's a bit better with buttermilk.  Use a large pan because it will foam up a bit.

Our family loves this syrup on all things mentioned! This Syrup is also AMAZING on what we, in the west, call scones AKA frybread. Try buttermilk Syrup on these! Mix:1 C. warmed milk, 1c. warm water, 1Tbs yeast, 3Tbs sugar and let rest/proof 3-5 minutes. Add: 1/4c. melted, cooled, butter, 1T Salt and 5-6 cups flour. Roll the dough to a thin 1/2 inch thickness on a floured surface, and allow to rise a few minutes while heating a pan of oil to 325* (never leave oil unattended!) cut dough from edges into crescents/pieces with the edge of a small 4-5 inch bowl. fry in oil on both sides until golden. Serve with Buttermilk Syrup. YUM!

Tasted like caramel! Served with Old-Fashioned Pancakes from AR. I had a lot of leftover syrup so I put it in a spare glass maple syrup jar and will freeze. Not sure if it will get hard or just tacky so I'll update later.

Delicious! I didn't use any corn syrup, and it thickened perfectly- so much so I actually ended up adding about 1/4c water to thin it out. Added a little bit of brown sugar as well.

Great for breakfast when you're in a pinch! Not overly flavorful, but a lot better than nothing :)

We were out of regular syrup so my daughter decided to try this recipe and it is very good. Followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I was wondering about was whether you could store this and how long it would be good for?

Glad to see this recipe for this great syrup. I gave this recipe to my friend who ran the B&B in South Dakota and received the recipe myself from another friend about 35 years ago. Still making it today for special occasions as it is very rich. Leftovers keep for a long time in the fridge.

I used only 1c of sugar. Also took advice from others and stored in small batches. When reheating I plopped it in the microwave for 10 secs, stirred then another 10 seconds did the trick.  Made the mistake of heating it for 1 minute and it got sticky and hard. With less heat it was warm but stick in liquid form to pour over.  A keeper.

This syrup was fantastic.  Tastes like heaven, and so easy to make!  My husband kept asking what the ingredients were, like he couldn't believe how simple and sweet it was.

DO NOT BOIL THIS TOO LONG!!!  Or you will have caramels or hard candy!  Also, be aware that if you have leftovers and warm this up in the microwave oven, it will get thicker and darker each time.  (It was the thickness of ice cream carmel topping by the time we finished it all off).  FANTASTIC TASTE!!  (oh, I should say that I used curdled half and half to make a bunch of "buttermilk" recipes on this site!  I just blended it really well before starting any of the recipes so it wouldn't have clumps).  SO EASY TO MAKE!  OH, Also...don't use a small pan...this will DOUBLE or MORE in size while boiling, so pick a LARGE saucepan unless you like cleaning your stove from boil-overs.

My family loved this syrup!  I probably won't buy syrup ever again!  I think when making it, you have to be careful not to over boil it, as that is when it will turn into a candy as some other reviews had commented!  Definitely a keeper :-)

The recipe I use doesn't call for corn syrup.  It has a little more sugar and buttermilk.  This syrup is absolutely amazing!  In my recipe you add the vanilla and baking soda after you take it off the heat so there is no bitterness.

OMG This is the best ever! After reading all the reviews, I made a few adjustments and it was fabulous! Reduced sugar to 1 cup, reduced baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon and added a few shakes of cinnamon. YUM!

You can make this healthier and still be delicious. This stuff is amazing as is - and dangerous, I could eat it with a spoon - but I've started making a healthier version that my family still loves. I cut back on the sugar a bit (like 1 to 1 1/4 c. instead of 1 1/2 c.) and after I make the syrup, I mix it with applesauce. It is still very delicious, but healthier. You can play with the ratio you like, I generally do about half syrup/half applesauce. We use it on pancakes and waffles, as a dipping sauce for apple slices, and as an ice cream topping. Sometimes I mix the applesauce in the pan, right after I've made it, and sometimes later, just popping some of the buttermilk syrup and applesauce in a bowl and microwaving it. (It is so good warm.) Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My family LOVED this syrup over Fluffy Pancakes from this site!  It is a keeper and since finding this recipe I will never settle for store bought syrup and for that matter I (hopefully!!!) will NEVER EAT PANCAKES AND SYRUP AT A RESTAURANT AGAIN!

My question is can the syrup be stored at room temp. or must it be kept in fridge?  It is so wonderful I want to give batches of it away to friends and family.

It's pretty amazing. Make sure you use a large pot when cooking and don't add the vanilla until it has cooled a little.

What a delicious syrup recipe!  It's wonderful on pancakes, waffles, AND ice cream.  Be sure to use a large enough pan and the ingredients rise pretty high in the pan and you don't want it to boil over on your stove.

Ihave never rated a recipe, but I made this today, and all I have to say is,"Boy oh Boy, this is some gooooood stuff!"  Caramel is my favorite flavor, and this is better than any I have ever had.  I will never buy any at a store again!  Thanks for a recipe for something so good, few ingredients, and so easy to make!

A very nice change from the norm - Good caramel-like flavor - very sweet, but good. If you like caramel, you'll love this! Thank You!

Tasty stuff!  Great on pancakes and more!  I used about 3/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet with a great caramel/butterscotch flavor.

DO NOT USE MARGARINE!  I love this syrup, I had it at a family reunion breakfast so of course 5 stars :) but I looked in my fridge only to find margarine and not butter...after it melts it resolidifies...yeah it was pretty gross looking, and it doesn't remelt leaving hard bits in the syrup.  Go figure!

OMG!  I will never buy store bought syrup again!  This is so easy and better than you can even imagine.  Be sure to use a big pot because it foams up as it boils and you don't want it to boil over.  I doubled the batch because I wanted a lot.  Some other ideas to do with it. Refridgerate it when your done with it as syrup and it will be fabulous over ice cream.  Or use it as a great caramel candy recipe. Just keep boiling it until it reaches soft ball stage.  235 to 245 degrees on a candy thermometer and then pour out into a buttered cookie sheet and let it cool.  Cut into pieces and wrap in waxed paper.  Fabulous candy!

This is also great poured over a plain cake in a 9 x 13 dish.  Let it sit for a bit and serve with coffee.  For extra special goodness, serve with a dollop of cool whip!  Delicious!

This recipe was easy to make and I followed it exactly BUT the texture was gritty and when cooled was so thick it was inedible. I poured mine in a mason jar and within minutes it was hard as a rock. The taste was fabulous but this is not a syrup, more like a candy. I will not make this again but I'm moving on to a 'real' pancake syrup recipe.

This is so good, we especially like it on whole wheat pancakes. I do omit the soda, though, I have made it both ways and definitely prefer w/o soda. I also use less sugar (I use heaping 1 c. and it was still sweet enough!!)

ummmm.....very disappointed.  I wanted to make a "blondie" dessert like the one from Applebee's for my boyfriend.  First, I used a large saucepan but this still expanded so much and so quickly that it made a huge mess.  After I transferred it, it did cook nicely and turned into a nice drizzly syrup that smelled good.  But it hardened into unchewable hard pieces almost as soon as we started drizzling.  And it didn't taste that carmely like others said anyway.  Ended up not using it and can't imagine putting this on pancakes.  grrrrrrrrr

This is a delicious syrup although I think the name should be changed to Caramel Buttermilk Syrup. Despite its scrumptiousness, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Being the sugar junkie that I am, this was a good thing. My husband doesn't have the sweet tooth that I do and deemed it "alright". The 3 year old liked it mixed with maple syrup. I will be making this again.

I must admit that this syrup is very, very delicious, but it definitley cannot be good for anyone because it is sooooo rich!! For that reason, i give it 4 stars, if there is a lighter version to this, it would be a 5 star recipe.

RECIPE TRIPLES IN VOLUME when baking soda is used, so use a bigger pan than you think you'll need.  We barely avoided catastrophe, but the recipe turned out great!  It is very sweet, so we're thinking of cutting down on the sugar and substituting honey for corn syrup next time.  We poured the syrup over pancakes topped with sliced bananas, and it was sooo delicious.  We may not ever buy syrup from the store again.

The syrup tastes great but definitely does not need all that sugar.  Also make sure you use a large enough pot as it tends to try and boil over.

This is a wonderfully, buttery, sinfully good syrup!  The first time I made it I cooked it a bit too long and over too high of heat.  But each time since I have had nothing but delicious syrup.  It is so very simple!  It goes wonderful with buttermilk pancakes.  No need to butter your pancakes before pouring this syrup!

SOOOOOO GOOOD!!! This syrup goes perfect with the "Banana Pancakes l" recipe on this site.  I made sure to use a medium to large pot as this does boil up (if you are boiling this on med-high heat, I would make sure to be constantly stirring with a whisk so it doesn't boil over the pot) I cooked it on low for a longer time and it turned out perfect.

This recipe was very easy to make. It was thick and caramely. However, I'm not sure if I messed up and put too much baking soda, but I could really taste it in the syrup. I couldn't eat much of it because of that.

This is a good "caramel sauce" but it was too sweet for pancakes. If I was making caramel, I'd give this 5 stars but this was just way too sweet and sappy for pancakes.

I thought everyone was nuts making syrup with buttermilk.  I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  My family and friends are asking for more.  My coworkers still don't believe I made this with buttermilk!

Wow!
Make a double recipe, and be sure to use an EXTRA large pot, as it tends to boil over.
I may never eat maple syrup again!

OMG Good! Very rich, very easy to make, we had it on waffles but I would like it better on vanilla ice cream. I thought it taste a lot like the dulce de leche.

I just finished making and devouring this for Sunday morning pancakes.  It was delicious.  I can't supermarket syrup and I was a little skeptical when I saw this, it too easy and straightforward, but that was also so good about this. I will experiment with this in the future adding flavoring such as maple extract,orange juice, etc. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I made this syrup to go on top of waffles and it is the best syrup I have ever tasted.  It was so good that I used the leftovers on top of brownies with strawberries.  It got rave reviews as a dessert sauce as well.  Give this recipe a try you wont be dissapointed.
