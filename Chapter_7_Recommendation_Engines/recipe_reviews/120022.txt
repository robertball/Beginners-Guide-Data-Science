This is a wonderful salad to have on hand--flexible as a side dish or dress up (chicken or tuna) as a main.

I served this on lettuce and loved the medley of flavor that this salad offered. Its crunch makes it perfect as a main meal because it gives the satisfying feeling of biting on something. I will definitely make this often.

I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of this salad.  I made it with a low fat mayo.  The salt was a little much for me, but that's just personal taste.  I would recommend starting with a little salt until you are satisfied with the results.  I doubled the recipe...it's gone a short time later.

Very good salad. I used a little red onion instead of chives just because I needed to use it. I will definitely be making this again and often! Also, it was surprisingly nice to see this recipe was submitted by someone from my home town. Thanks for sharing this, Gusty.
