Delicious! I loved all the Tex-Mex flavors! The CAULIPOWER crust was crispy and held up well to all the toppings.  The meat mixture was full of flavor and put this pizza over the top!

yum yum.  I made this with Beyond Beef and it was wonderful.  I left off the pepper because I am a wimp and made my own tortilla strips in the air fryer.   Lots of toppings.. might cut back on  the beef mixture a bit next time, but the flavors are spot on.  This is a delicious-tasting crust and I will make again

Made this with Turkey instead of beef and mixed in refried beens in the meat mix instead of black beans. We added some  cut up onion and bell pepper to the meat mix just to make sure we had veggies.   We also changed the sour cream out for hummus and loved the results!!  The caulipower was awesome and with the rest of the ingredients, it tasted so much better than I thought it would.  Even my kids enjoyed it so we will keep this and make it again.

This pizza is fantastic! The recipe really nails the taste of half taco, half pizza. We will definitely make this again. The pizza does have a huge amount of toppings which slows the cooking of the crust underneath as well as making it hard to eat. I will try same amount of toppings split between two pizzas next time. I’m serious, this pizza is really, really good!! CAULIPOWER pizza is fantastic and has great flavor! Knowing it is gluten-free, better-for-you, and delicious-tasting makes me feel like I found a genie to grant my wish for pizza to be diet friendly.

This was really yummy!  The CAULIPOWER crust was crispy and not chewy. I couldn't tell it was made of cauliflower. I love that it's a healthier dinner option with lots of flavor.  I felt like I was splurging on dinner but I was still keeping it healthy.

We had this for dinner 9/17/19, and I followed the recipe, except for using Fritos, instead of tortilla strips.  The CAULIPOWER pizza crust was nice and crispy around the edges, with good texture in the middle.  The cauliflower taste was present, occasionally, but not in an overpowering way.  This was a kind of mash-up of a pizza and a tostada, and I liked the veggie content of the dish.  I have to say, though, it did not become my favorite way to prepare a pizza OR a tostada.  The word "pizza" conjures up a certain flavor profile for me, and it's not Tex-Mex.  I would like to try the CAULIPOWER pizza again, augmenting with more traditional pizza elements.

The Taco Salad pizza was a delicious and cheesy delight!  It was surprising that it was better for you than a traditional pizza - I wouldn’t have necessarily known it was healthier and gluten-free --if I hadn’t known beforehand that I used a CAULIPOWER pizza as the base, as it tasted like a guilty pleasure! It made this unique recipe quite enjoyable, filling, and tasty! I made it exactly as the recipe was written, although I did not include the jalapeno pepper.

I made this recipe as written with the only change of using corn tortilla chips that I broke up (couldn't locate the tortilla strips at the store).  Everyone loved it!  Word of caution to those who don't like a lot of heat-  go mild on everything if you don't like spicy, and skip the jalapenos.

This recipe was outstanding!  I loved the Caulipower pizza crust, it turned out crispy and delicious!  I also added some sliced black olives and used Sriracha sauce mixed with sour cream.
