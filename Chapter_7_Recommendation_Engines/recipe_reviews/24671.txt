This is WORTH the 'trouble'!!! I am on a low sugar diet by choice (which we all should be) and I made this ice cream with Splenda* brand alternative sweetener. It goes thru your system, and does not get absorbed into the blood stream, because your body mistakes it for something unabsorbable, like dietary fiber. It's fabulous. And, like the jingles claim, it does taste just like sugar. Anyhow, you've got to be really careful not to let the custard boil. If you use medium heat all through the recipie, it'll boil at some point. After seeing the first few 'boils' in the cream mix, take it off the heat and immediately turn the stove down to medium-low. Half way to medium. Then, watch it carefully, and stir OFTEN. I found that it is thick enough to 'coat the back of a spoon' in it's plain cream mix form, but when the final custard  has been cooking for 3 or 5 minutes, and it does seem nice and thick to you, it's done. If you have a newer 'ice-less' ice cream mixer, and you are going to be using online recipes, you should definately find out what the capacity of your freezer bowl is. I have the Cuisinart ICE-20, and any recipe with a total of roughly 2 1/2 to 3 cups of dairy products in it is definately going to fill it up. Don't forget how ice cream seems to double in volume when it is freezing up. If the recipe seems too big, take advantage of allrecipe's fabulous scaling option at the bottom of the main recipe page. Just tweak it until the cuppage is correct for your mixer. Also

This vanilla ice cream was great but I had changed a few things.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream, whole milk, and only 5 egg yolks.  It came out very creamy and smooth.  Absolutely delicious!

This ice cream was really good. We liked it much better than the highly rated Vanilla Ice Cream IV.  I didn't have a vanilla bean so I just doubled the vanilla extract and it came out wonderful. This is defiantly the best vanilla homemade ice cream that I have tried from this site. Thanks Melissa!

Great texture and taste!

After a bad experience with another ice cream recipe I heeded a previous reviewers warning and cut the eggs. We used 3 eggs in place of 5 the recipe called for. Also substituted 2 tsp of vanilla extract for the vanilla bean. 

We cooled the mixture in the fridge overnight. After churning in our ice cream mixer it was absolutely the best vanilla ice cream I have ever tasted. I am not a vanilla fan, but this was delicious and not a drop was left after our BBQ.

This is a smooth, very rich, and creamy frozen custard, the kind we in Wisconsin love and are famous for. For those who find the "egginess" not to their liking, the egg yolks can be reduced without a problem. Since I like my custard extra rich, I used half and half in exchange for the milk, which also contributes to the smooth mouth feel. This is also a wonderful base for other flavors and additions.

This was so rich, we could barely eat a scoop apiece!  It was tasty enough, but I'd cut waaaaay back on the eggs next time.  I made it for my daughter's eighth birthday party and some of her friends didn't even finish theirs.  Mixed with chocolate, malt, and nonfat milk, it makes terrific shakes, though, which is how we used the leftovers.

To make your ice cream more creamy let the ice cream base sit overnight in the fridge.  The next day it will be vanilla sauce/pudding like.  This is a great, creamy ice cream recipe.

Just the best vanilla ice cream out there!  I even forgot to add the vanilla extract, but I did use a vanilla bean. Will definately make again.

This ice cream is good, but I think it is more like a custard. We enjoyed making it as a family and we hope to make it again!

This is truly a 5-star recipe, if you use 5 yolks instead of 10. I have David Lebovitz' ice cream cookbook, "The Perfect Scoop," and and this is very similar to his vanilla recipe except his only makes 1 quart. This recipe makes the perfect amount for any 2qt ice cream maker.  For my very best results, I make the custard the evening before I want to enjoy and chill in the fridge overnight. I churn it in the morning and return to the freezer. By the time I'm ready to enjoy in the evening, the ice cream is perfectly set. Unlike "Philadelphia" style ice creams, this may be too soft right out of the churner to enjoy straight away, but always maintains a perfect texture in the freezer, just like (or better!) than store bought.

This is yummy! When i try a new recipes I like to follow them to a "T" the first time, then make any tweeking the next time.  With this recipe I had to make it in two batches.  The first batch I chilled it for 2 hours, mixing it every now and then and it came out really good!! A bit "egg-y" but still really good.  Then the 2nd batch chilled for 2 1/2 days (kids distract you you know) and I added some strawberry jam.  The results were incredible! My husband said that he couldn't believe that I had made the frozen custard from Leon's (Milwaukee, WI)!!  It was creamier and not as egg-y.  I don't know if the jam  or the more chilling time that had anything to do with it changing but OMG!!!!  Now, he wants me to make this enough times to always have a stock of it on hand.  That's enough compliment for me.  thanks for posting this recipe!!

I had to half this recipe as my ice cream machine is only small. I think there are way too many eggs. Just two would have been sufficent as the taste was overwelming. Might try again and play around with the amounts as it has the potential to be a great ice cream.

Cut the eggs a bit, as suggested.  Delicious and decadent!  1/2 recipe of this fits nicely into the Kitchen Aid stand mixer ice cream attachment.

This was an easy recipe to prepare & the tastiest vanilla I've ever had! I hate vanilla, finding it bland & flavorless, but this was just scrumptious & *really* thick, just like a frozen custard should be. The only problem I had was my Cook's Essentials ice cream maker had trouble handling it because of how thick it froze up, I even split it into 2 batches. I'll need to buy a better maker just so I can keep making this! lol

Great ice cream! After reading lots of the reviews, I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and cream, reduced sugar to one cup, and reduced egg yolks to 4. I have tried several other ice cream recipes this week and this one is the winner, great flavor, consistency, and perfect sweetness and vanilla. I highly recommend this recipe!

Made a batch for 4th of July.  We had a contest between five different ice creams and this one won!!  I used 1 pt heavy cream, 1 pt half & half instead of a qt. of heavy cream.  Also only used 6 egg yolks.  After it was done, I stirred in 1 cup of boysenberry jam, then let sit for a couple hrs.  YUMMERS....

Best Icecream ever... with a few modifications.  2 qts heavy cream 2 cups whole milk 2 cups sugar 10 egg yolks 2 Tbs vanilla extract  This recipe is best if hardened for a few hours or overnight.  My kids added cookie dough and it worked out well.  You can add anything to this base and it will work.

Very good, but I'm glad I read the other reviews and lessened the eggs.  I doubled the recipe, but I only used 1 quart of cream, and all the rest of the liquid I used half and half.  I used 13 egg yolks total.  Still creamy and tasty.. will definitely make again!

This is excellent homemade ice cream.  I prefer the cooked kind just because of the scare of uncooked eggs.  I did splurge on the vanilla beans and think it was worth it.  Will make again and again.

I love this recipe! The changes I made were that I scalded the milk/cream mixture, then when I added some to my eggs, I didn't have to worry so much. After I added the eggs to everything else, I inserted a candy thermometer and cooked it till it reached 180 degrees. No worries about boiling!

I love this recipe. I went to a  french pastry school and we would make ice cream base called creme anglaise. This was closest to it. I noticed if you use heavy cream the ice cream is very rich and tastes a little buttery. The instructors at the school would say that as well and would suggest using half and half. I also cut back on my eggs too. I like to use 5 eggs because it is cheaper and makes the ice cream fluffier, I think 10 eggs is too much. I would also use at least 2-3 vanilla beans for more flavor.

This ice cream is the way all ice cream should be! Delicious and smooth and so flaverful. I didn't have a vanilla bean so I omitted it but WOW what a great recipe. The thing that surprised me the most about this recipe was the flavor, it almost tastes like a hint of mint is in the actual ice cream, very weird but not overpowering. I did have problems with straining the custard, the process that worked best for me was i got a splatter shield and put it over a large bowl, i pour the custrd on top of that as much as I could without it overflowing and then moved it around with a whisk til the liquid had soak through. Wonderful recipe, I'd give it more stars if I could!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I had to halve it for my machine, and I used a full tablespoon of vanilla bean paste instead of the actual bean and the extract.  The flavour is great.  And it's so rich (it's really an old fashioned frozen custard, rather than what we think of anymore as ice cream).  I gave it 4 instead of 5 simply because I did find it a bit too sweet.  I'll cut back on the sugar the next time.  I bet it would be wonderful with about 2/3C of orange juice concentrate stirred in.  Or a teaspoon of pure orange oil.

Truly delicious ice cream. I made it exactly as written. The ice cream is rich, silky smooth, has lovely vanilla flavor and also makes a great base for add-ins.

Fabulous. Dropped the egg yolks to 5 and upped the vanilla beans to 3. Delicious. Stays creamy and almost marshmallow consistency when left out a frig for a few minutes to serve. There is no point to try ANY other recipe...this is the bomb. Was not "custard" like when I dropped the yolks. But may try some time with more. But ice cream perfection !!!!

This was my first experience making a custard based vanilla ice cream recipe and I must say I was very pleased with the results. I took a hint from comments on the 'eggy-ness' though, and only used 3 egg yolks. I could absolutely taste them, so can only imagine what it would be like with all 10, lol. It seems to me the amount of yolks has more to do with the taste than anything else as it turned out great, texture-wise, despite only using 3. Rich, smooth and "very vanilla" even without the extract, which I forgot to add in. I would just add a good pinch of salt next time, or perhaps reduce the sugar to 1 cup. I did not strain the mixture as it didn't seem to need it, plus it looks appealing with the vanilla seeds in there. I also swirled in a 1/4 cup of raspberry puree when finished. Absolutely amazing!

Husband made this start to finish then ate it while I was out, so I didn't get to try.  He said it was too yolky, so I guess we're trying another recipe next time, or cutting down on the egg yolks.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect recipe, and I liked this one better than the other vanilla ice cream recipes because the instructions called for tempering the eggs. I found another vanilla custard ice cream recipe on here that just called for cooking eggs over direct heat and that spells tragedy if you look away from the stove for a minute. Tempering is the way to go. For Thanksgiving, I added Vietnamese cinnamon to the recipe and made cinnamon-vanilla ice cream to go with the pumpkin pie.

A bit on the eggy side, but this is quite tasty. I don't know if it's because mine boiled in the 10 seconds that I left it unattended, but it was not as creamy as I would have liked - the crystals were a bit large. I will make it again and change my review if it improves without boiling.

I gave this a 4 because I think I like the uncooked icecream better, it has the grainy/icy texture I remember as a kid and relate with "homeade".  This was really good...tasted very creamy.  I did cut the eggs to 7.  My family loved it! This is probably the best cooked recipe if you like that kind.

I planned to make this for my mother's 81st birthday, so I did a trial run.  She said it was excellent!  Very creamy and delicious.  I will make a double batch to fill the ice cream canister.  It did not increase in volume much at all.

Rather on the sweet side.  If I made this again, would probably only use 3/4 cup sugar.

We have been making this recipe every July 4th for the last 12 years.  We only made 2 changes in the original recipe.  We cut back the number of yolks to 8 and we make a double recipe (but make one batch at a time and then combine in the ice cream  canister)  and chill overnight.  Family and friends love it and look forward to having it on the 4th!!

I have been trying different ice cream recipes, and this is the best one!   I made it exactly as written and it was perfect.   I wonder if some people who were saying it was to "eggy" didn't whisk the eggs until they were light and fluffy.

Very disappointed, not sure what went wrong, felt it was very grainy.  Will not make again.  Have made various custard ice creams and this was by far the least successful

This recipe came out really good.  I had so many rav's at my daughters Birthday Party about the homemade ice cream.  I changed a little about the recipe.  I saved some of the milk and put it in the eggs and put the heavy cream and the vanilla beans in the pot to almost boil.  Instead of milk I used half and half so it was a little bit creamier.

very good. I replaced the milk with goat milk and used half the quantity of cream (replaced with goat milk). There was also a small quantity of xanthan gum that I mixed into the yolks. All said, pretty stinking good ice cream!

Good base recipe to add pumpkin pie spice. For richer custard, substitute cream for milk, add to other cream. Add 1 Tablespoon Pumpkin Pie Spice while cooking. Follow rest of instructions as written

This was really good the first time I made it, but the second time didn't work out so well. I don't understand the "coat the back of the spoon" reference. As soon as I mixed the egg yokes and cream/milk I stuck a metal spoon in it and it coated the back and left a trail when I ran my finger through it. So I just cooked it for 20 minutes, repeating the spoon test a few times with the same result. As it got close to the 20 minute point, yellow globules started forming in the liquid (I didn't know if this was good or bad) After 20 minutes I strained, cooled and then froze the liquid in the ice cream maker. The results were pretty awful. The globules grouped together and formed butter-like clumps that even the kids wouldn't eat.

There are a lot of eggs in this recipe and so it becomes very thick, like pudding before you freeze it in the ice cream machine.  My boyfriend (who eats a lot of ice cream) told me it was too rich, but what I think he tastes is all the egg.

I am in the minority here but I didn't care for this ice cream at all. I did use the vanilla bean and followed the recipe exactly but it just has a funny "twang" to me I don't care for. It was thick and creamy tho.
