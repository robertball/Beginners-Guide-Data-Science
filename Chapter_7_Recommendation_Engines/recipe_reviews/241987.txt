Awesome recipe! I tweeked mine to fit my family's taste buds. I used brown sugar, fresh peaches, doubled the vanilla, and added a dash of salt. Over vanilla ice cream it was so yummy! I'll never go back to peach cobbler! It was that good!

Loved it. Used fresh peaches, real brown sugar, a little extra vanilla, ground cinnamon, and walnuts. Went surprisingly well with butter pecan ice cream.

Wow, did this one surprise me.  How can something so easy, taste so good, and you can enjoy it with no guilt.  The recipe doesn't say to defrost the peaches, but I had some concerns about frozen peaches releasing water in the baking dish, so I defrosted them. The recipe author says "if you prefer to use brown sugar, use the same amount as the replacement." I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and you use half the amount of brown sugar, so just a word of caution if you don't use the substitute.  This had just the right amount of sweetness for us, takes no time to make, and you can enjoy this dessert without guilt.  Thanks, libton, for a yummy, quick and easy dessert.

I had not-so-good, rather mealy, fresh peaches on hand and thought I’d try this recipe. I didn’t have pecans so I used walnuts. Also it took about 35-40 minutes to get a syrupy consistency. Delicious over vanilla ice cream.

An easy summer dessert to have prepped and in the fridge, awaiting a brief stint in the oven or bbq after the main meal is cooked. As per other reviewers, I used fresh (Ontario) peaches, regular brown sugar, and doubled the vanilla.  I'm guessing the better the peaches (and ripeness), the better the flavour.  We did serve this in individual heatproof greased crocks (for quicker baking and serving), with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream and a side of cinnamon walnut coffee cake.  I also made two other individual servings using artificial sweetener (used different small crocks to differentiate);  I should have dissolved in melted butter first as the powder didn't dissolve during the baking process, although the two guests that had those enjoyed them after stirring it up a bit.

I used fresh peaches, gf flour, doubled the vanilla, and added a tad of butter. It wasn't very flavorful. I don't think that had to do with my changes as I didn't decrease the sugar. Although maybe bagged peaches have more sugar?

Pretty easy to make. Didn't have enough flavor. Added a smidge bit of cinnamon, a little more brown sugar, and a little butter. Had it with ice cream. Will make again.

Easy and delicious! I used real brown sugar and omitted the pecans, as I didn't have any. Used it as topping on homemade vanilla ice cream. So good!
