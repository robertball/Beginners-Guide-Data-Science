Amazingly good! Reading the other reviews, blandness seemed to be a problem, so instead of just adding the onion and zucchini raw ,I sauteed it with garlic. I also added 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the egg mixture. This tasted perfect. Not bland at all! I will definitely be making this quite often.

This was a great recipe! I made it my own... using spinach and squash as well. I steamed the zucchini, squash, and onions for a few minutes before adding it to the mix so that I could cut down on the cooking time. I also used applesauce instead of oil (to make it healthier) and baked it an a 9x9 dish to make it thicker. It was excellent. You just need to spice it up the way you like it- make it your own- but thank you for the recipe! It was a great dish and not very difficult!

This recipe is great but I wouldn't make it without adding tomatoes!  I put in 2 fresh, chopped.  I also pumped up the salt and pepper a touch, and added 1/2 t each of garlic powder and curry powder.  For those who found the recipe bland, those additions really make a big difference.

Loved this! I only made half the recipe and baked it in an 8 inch square dish for about 45 minutes. Even DH liked it, and he rarely eats veggies. The secret for me was to dice the zucchini very small. I think grating would work well for the zucchini, also. I found I was out of onions so I subbed a shallot.

Absolutely delicious.  Very wholesome and a great dinner idea that can be made in minutes and then left in the oven while you do other things.  Thank you so much!

I've made this a lot; it's awesome. Like the other reviewers said, it could be bland, so make sure to salt it properly. 
I have also seen this recipe with a grated carrot as well. When I am not lazy, I throw that in- adds nice color a bit of flavor. 

Otherwise, it's one of those foods I don't tire of.

I read the other reviews and didn't want to add more fat and cals to combat blandness.  I added a heaping dose of Old Bay and substituted the oil for apples sauce.  It was great!

This is super - super easy and super tasty.  Everyone loves it.  For variations - try adding some oregano to the mix and/or mixing the chopped parsley into the batter.

OMGosh! This is AWESOME!!!! A friend gave me a giant zucchini from her garden, and this is one of the things that I made with it. I took advice from other reviewers and added seasoning, and I added about a cup of shredded Monterey cheese. I also grated the zucchini. It was sooo yummy! I also noticed that after it cools a bit, it starts to set up a little better, and the flavors are better, as well. I will make this again and again. I like that it is easily customizable!

Pretty good way to use up some extra zucchini! The recipe seems easy to accept modifications as well (for example I didn't have enough zucchini and used some orange bell pepper that I needed to get rid of... worked just fine!). Recommended!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it is very bland.  This one leaves a lot to be desired.  I probably won't make this one again.

Delicious and easy. I grated the zucchini and onion. I also added rosemary in with the zucchini and onion and omitted the parsley. I'll definitely be making it again.

I've made quite a few changes, but it turned out very tasty! Added two cloves of garlic, one tomato, extra seasoning, and curry powder. Next time, I think I will try it with fewer eggs, and may substitute oil with apple sauce, as others suggested.

Yes, it wasn't spicy or zingy, but I added  some garlic salt, and it was good. It was great for my 16 month old who has a milk allergy. The only other change I made was using only 1 pound of zucchini which was about 4 cups diced. Maybe my zucchini weighed more because it was bigger? Anyway, this is a good basic recipe that anyone can make and spice up the way they want to.

This was surprisingly good!  I had my doubts while preparing it, but we were very happy with the results.  Next time, I may add some shredded cheese, but it is very good as is.

This was good, but I added more onion, garlic, a green pepper, a banana pepper, 1/2 a jalapeno, a handful of cherry tomatoes & basil and fried them in a pan until tender.  Then I added the  zucchini for a few minutes before mixing it with the flour and egg mixture.  In the future I would add more tomatoes and some mushrooms.

This recipe was OK.  I liked the texture and I felt I should have put it in a deeper smaller pan as it was very thin.  I was worried it would be a little bland so I too added tomato and sprinkled feta on top which got a little crispy in the over and made for a nice topping.  Overall I probably would not make this again, but it was good once.

I made this because I had all the ingredients and needed to use up squash and zucchini.  I though it was just ok.  My husband loved it.  It was not too eggy and cooked up nicely.  Would probably jazz it up with spices or tomatoes if I made it again.

This was pretty yummy! I tried to add more salt, pepper, and paprika since the other reviews said it was a tad bland and I could have added more. This recipe is so customizable, I wish I had more veggies to put in it!

Yummy.  I normally do not like souffle type recipes. However, this one was delicous.  I made a few substitutions for this was a last minute lookup recipe for zucchini on hand that needed to be cooked.    I did not have an onion, so I used a shallt as one reviewer suggested, I shredded the zucchini and I added 1-2 oz of shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicous and east to make, my youngest daughter went back for seconds.  Thanks.

So light and fluffy!  I did add cheese but other than that, the recipe was followed and it had great flavor!  I'm a cheese-aholic, though, and extra protein is never bad!  Added about a cup of a cheddar, monterey, jack blend.

This recipe was a wonderful surprise because I didn't expect something so easy to be so good. My husband and I got up the next morning and had the leftovers for breakfast.

What a waste of zucchini! I feel terrible wasting the ingredients, especially since I only eat organic. I guess I'm going to try to maybe mix it with a ton of cheese and put it in a crust to make a pie? Just terribly bland.

This is one of those recipes that you are so happy to run into -- and yes, I tweeked it by adding minced garlic, green pepper, shredded cheddar, and cayenne pepper because I wanted something a little bolder than the original. Its the little recipe 'that could' (support so many possibilities). My daughter is RAVING about it right now . Next time I'll make it exactly the same but with the addition of kielbasa.

I made this exactly to the recipe, except that I grated the zucchini rather than dicing it, and left the peel on. 
This recipe was quite good, but I just can't not think how much better it would be with some added grated cheese!!
I have to say it was a good way to get my zucchini-hating seven year old to eat zucchini without even realising (with it grated).

Surprisingly good!  I did make a few additions to the seasonings to suit our tastes, but this is an excellent base recipe as well as a great way to use zucchini when it's abundant in the garden.
I used 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp granulated garlic and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  The cayenne gave it zing and really brought out the sweetness of the zucchini.  I also used "Egg Beaters" in place of the eggs and decreased the oil slightly.
Will definitely be adding this to our go-to recipe file!

Loved this!  I sauteed the onions and zucchini, added garlic.  Also, topped it with shredded cheese.  Baked for only 30 min.

great! used 3 eggs (b/c that's all I had), 2 cups shredded zucchini, 2 cups chopped spinach, 1/2 onion chopped, 1/3 green pepper chopped, 1/2 cup diced tomatoes with green chilis, added a sprinkle of garlic salt and 2/3 cup cheese. Also substituted applesauce for oil. Great side dish!

I was disappointed because this really isn't a souffle, it doesn't puff and turns out more like a quiche.   Also I had to cook much longer than 1 hour.  It was very watery and I had to cook for about 1hr 30-45min.

As a cooking-challenged person who is married to a could-be-sous-chef, this was great-- AND I got the thumbs-up to make it again!  Works great for breakfast, too, as a quiche without the crust!

This is very simple and good!  I didn't have paprika OR parsley so I used lots of pepper and salt and when it was done I sprinkled parmessan cheese on it and covered with foil.....yum!!  It was a little bland but probably because I didn't have the correct seasonings so make sure you have them or season it a different way.

This was a wonderful dish. My first souffle. My husband and son loved it. I used zucchini from my garden, and added some fresh tomatoes from the garden also. I added some Italian seasoning and a little chili powder as mentioned in other reviews. It was a very easy recipe and took little effort. This will be a recipe we use often. Thanks!!

I really enjoyed this dish. As per other reviewers I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp curry powder and threw some parsley into the mix. This combination of spices gave a good flavor as a great side dish. Thanks! UPDATE: I've been making this for quite a few years and never quite loved the consistency... This time I grated the zucchini and it made a HUGE difference! I also omitted the curry and instead did a tsp of chicken consomme powder; red onion finely diced and parsley mixed in - my guests and kids loved it. Grating and draining excess liquid is a bit extra work but very well worth it. UPDATE: I made them as muffins (I love food in muffin form) and they were great!

Bake time = 45 min.  After reading through other reviews, we tried to increase the flavor with garlic, onion and up the seasonings...  But it was still very bland.  I don't know how many T. of seasonings you'd need, but we won't be trying this again.  Thanks though...

I thought this was okay, it was too bland for my fiance though, but I am just starting to experiment with zucchini, so maybe we're still getting used to it.  Easy to make. Come to think of it as a side with a spicy beef roast, it would be a good accessory.

Great recipe! I kept all amounts the same despite using a very large 3lb zucchini and it all worked out great. I also used other suggestions: oregano, tomatoes, shredded cheddar, and first sauted onions, zucchini, garlic and oregano which cut down oven time to a total of about 35-45 min.

Good....I did sautee the onion and added some crushed garlic to that. I think that gave the recipe more flavor. I also grated my zucchini and added some shredded cheddar cheese. I cut the oil down to 1/4c and used evoo. Tasty....good way to use up zucchini, and very easy to make. Thanks!

I did not care for this. I made it for a family dinner, hoping it would turn out like one of our favorite restaraunts and it didnt. It had little to no flavor and mostly tasted of eggs. I followed this recipe exactly as it's stated here...this is definately something we wont be making again!

You must understand, I live with vegetarians who are picky about their vegetables and the person cooking each type of meal. I get a better response when they offer opinions, so this was a huge leap out of the normal. I must say, it was a success.

I grated the zucchini, as opposed to chopping it. Also, I served it with shredded cheddar on the side. I think this would be amazing with gruyere or swiss baked in. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. All in all, this was a great first time effort. Not happy that I had no starting measurement for salt and pepper, but I get it. 

I will do this again... and soon!

I just made this recipe for lunch and it was a disaster. It felt strange to use 1 cup of flour with only 4 eggs if you want to make a soufflé but I followed it with precision only to find out that I was right. It was some sort of porridge!

A great way to use up that extra garden zucchini. Made this with whole wheat flour, melted butter and additional seasoning, specifically chopped garlic. I also topped it with shredded mozzarella cheese during the last minutes of baking.  Loved the taste!  The texture right out of the oven was a bit 'wet'.  Not sure if it should have been baked a bit longer.  I will definitely make this again, hopefully this week as I have lots of garden zucchini.  I think I add other vegetables...mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, just to make it interesting!

Great "base" recipe with the flour, eggs and soda.  Like the look of the green zucchini so didn't peel, added cheese, garlic salt.  Kids couldn't get enough of it!

OMG this is so good.  I didn't know zucchinis could taste this good.  We who ate it didn't have any trouble with blandness we all loved it.  Which in our house it's pretty amazing that we all agreed.

My husband didn't even want to try this because he "hates eggs". I added crisp bacon and cheddar to the second one I just took out of the oven (at HIS request!). I think his initial comment was, "AWESOME".

Very tasty! Like other reviews suggested, I added about 2 cloves of garlic. I added about half a cup of bread crumbs instead of flour. And topped with fried onions.

I tried to make this more nutritious by using white whole wheat flour and a little flax meal.  Very heavy and dry.  Next time I will follow the recipe.

Smells great while cooking, and turns out yummy and light. Not substantial enough to be a main dish for dinner, but would make a nice brunch or side dish.

Very good! I included some mozzarella and asiago cheese in the mixture - only about 4oz total. I sautéed the zucchini and 2 onions to cut on the cooking time. I poured the mixture in a 9x13in pan and sprinkled with bread crumbs and some of the cheese. It made a nice crust. My boyfriend loved it.

I LOVE zucchini... here's some ideas if you have an excess of this veggie.  I felt creative and began to improvise on a few things.  My husband felt the following changes, additions, and presentation made this recipe truly gourmet!  I don't recall the exact measurements because I was seasoning the souffle mix to taste.      First, make some chicken broth and have more zuccini ready.  With a peeler, you can make pasta-like ribbons till you get to the seedy center.  These "noodles" will go with the broth in the end.  Grate the remainder of the zucchini and add it as directed.  First, for a true souffle, separate the egg whites and beat adding a couple pinches of cream of tartar towards the end.  Note---for more poof, add 2 more egg whites.   Mix the yolks with the flour, baking powder and oil mixture.  Mine seemed a bit too stiff so I added chicken broth till I got the desired consistency.  Then mix the meringue and flour mixture together and adding the zuccini.  I placed this in a heavily buttered, round casserole dish.     As the souffle was baking, I sauteed the "ribbons" in butter and garlic.  Before removing the souffle from the oven, serve the soup with the pretty zuccini ribbons.  You can also add some parmesean cheese.  This will be your first 'WOW' since your guests will ask, "are these noodles????"  Then you take the souffle out of the oven and serve them in each soup dish.  Double WOW!  The fluffyness just soaks up the soup and you are in a savory heaven.

Thanks for the recipe!  Even the kids liked it - it wasn't heavy like a quiche and the flour was really light so you could definitely taste the zucchini.  It was a really great combination.

For me personally...i like simple food not overly seasoned, so i really liked the lightness of this. I did add a little cayenne for a little kick.  I loved it...something I would make again & again.

I don't know if my oven is at fault, or perhaps even my very old baking powder.  But this turned out badly.   I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  Not an hour.  The top and bottom were over-done.  The middle was gooey and almost watery. I don't know what should be done differently, but it failed.

Delicious,  I added chopped garlic and cilantro.  I also used half olive oil. I tossed the spices, garlic, onion, oil and Zuchini together and let it sit for awhile before I put it together with the batter.

Good starter recipe.  It's not really a souffle, the end result is more like a frittata.  A little on the bland side but I think it would be easy to adapt to one's taste.  Next time, I'm going to try to add chopped artichoke hearts and some parmesan.

No changes. It reminds me of how my mother used to make it in the summer using Summer Squash which was the only season it was available.  I and everyone I shared this dish with loved it and wanted to repeat it at home for their families.

I tried this recipe with the addition of some spices, cheese and tomato--but the taste of oil was so overpowering we ended up throwing most of it out.  I did want a healthy zucchini recipe though, and this was a good start, so I did a little internet search and made some healthy substitutions:  
Replaced the oil with same amount navy or other white beans, mashed--apparently beans are a good substitute for oil--who knew?!  (I would have used applesauce, but had none on hand--so glad I learned about bean substitute though--something to experiment with!)
Replace all or part of the eggs with chia seeds--1 T chia seed soaked in 3 T water for each egg you are substituting. If you know chia, you know they soon take on an egg-like consistency when soaked.  I used 2 eggs and 2 T chia seeds/water.  I did add a little more water to make the consistency a smoother after adding the flour. 
I only had yellow squash from the garden, so I used these instead of the zucchini and added fresh, chopped tomatoes from the garden as well. 
I have been topping all my veggie dishes lately with slices of havarti cheese--it has a mild, creamy texture  and browns up so nicely.  Costco sells it in bulk--score!
What a difference these changes made!  My husband has gone from, "All I taste is oil" to "Dang, that's good!"

Great recipe!  I took the suggestion of sauteing garlic and onions then added the zucchini and cooked a little more.  I drained the mixture (it gets watery) before adding it to the flour mixture.  Added the cheddar cheese, sea salt, pepper and smoked paprika.  The entire dish went in one sitting!  Definitely a keeper!

After reading this recipe, I thought to myself this is going to need something.  I had not read the reviews.  So I made it just as described but at the last 20 min. of baking, I added a little cheddar cheese and crushed crackers (garlic flavored).  OMG...this was delicious.  i think it would have been declicious even without the cheese and crackers.  It just added a little crunch to the dish.  I will DEFINITELY make this again. I typically make zucchini bread with all the summer zucchini I get but NOW I have this wonderful recipe.

It was great! Even for to the not so "zucchini lover". I did mnot peel the zucchini and use both yellow and green variety. I took the advise and saute the zucchini and onion in olive oil and garlic first and I added fresh thyme. Will do it again!

Very good, came out a little crispier than I expected and required a bit of extra spice, but a very good base!
