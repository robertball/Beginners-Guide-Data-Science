My family and I loved it! The flavors in this dish are scrumptious. My teenaged daughter helped to make dinner. Because the directions were well written, she was able to do a great job in making this dish! To make it was very easy and fast!

I made it as a main dish to Asian Coconut Rice ( http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/AZ/sinCcntRic.asp ) The two flavors go extremely well together. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It's great!  I used a bit of onion and a lot of brocolli instead of the veggies recommended -and everything still worked out brilliantly.

note: use a  nonstick pan.  first attempt to braise tofu in an non- non-stick was less successful.

Couldn't wait to try this dish, it sounded just delicious, but after making it, I found that it was a bit too bland for my liking (and I even added extra oyster sauce - double).  I kept it, however, and the next day it tasted much, much better.  I think I might make this again, but I would definitely add more vegetables and add more sauce or wait a couple of hours before eating it.  But overall, not bad.

I used this recipe as a starting point for my stir fry of the night. I liked braising it as suggested though I used a nonstick pan and very little oil. For my veggies, all I had were mushrooms and carrots. I also sauteed garlic with them. For the sauce, I didn't use as much water, added a little soy sauce, and added crushed red pepper flakes that soaked while I did other things. When I added the sauce, I also added a handful of cooked rice noodles and heated everything up together. Turned out great but hardly I followed the recipe!

I like the sauce in this.  I do think it is better when previously frozen tofu is used.  Gives it that chewy texture.  I'll make this again.

I've made so many mistakes cooking tofu in the past. It's usually just ended up a bland ugly mess. For this recipe, I marinated cubed extra-firm tofu overnight in a mixture of hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, Thai chili and garlic paste, sesame oil, and minced garlic. I then pretty much followed the recipe, although I ended up adding a bit more oyster sauce to the mix. I served it over angel hair pasta, with a sprinkle of sliced green onions. Good stuff. Thanks, Melissa!

Not too bad.  I fried tofu a bit longer for some extra texture.  I added bok choy instead of mushrooms, and the bok choy was my favorite part!  :o)  I didn't think it tasted very good when I ate it for lunch, but it tasted much better for dinner.  I think it needed some time to marinate or something?  I had it two days in a row (I'm the only one who will eat vegetarian in the house) so it had to have been pretty good.  :o)

Wow, some overly harsh reviews for this recipe! I agree it is on the bland side, and am not really down with using sesame oil if for pan frying if you are trying to make it healthier.  Here were the adjustments I made:

1. A heaping teaspoon of oyster sauce instead of 1/2 tsp.

2. 1 tsp. soy sauce

3. 1.5tsp granulated sugar

4. 1/4tsp. hot chili oil

5. reduce water to 1/2 cup

6. at the end, lower heat to medium-low and add .5tsp of cornstarch pre-mixed with .tsp of cold water to thicken.

7. Use canola oil instead of sesame. You more than make up for flavor with the amped up seasoning above.

This yields a more flavorful sauce (I think) with enough viscosity to coat all the ingredients.

It didn't turn out that great. I don't know if it's because I used frozen peas instead of snow peas, since I can't find any at Safeway. It was too watery and the tofu just taste like any regular tofu.

Very bland.  Needs more flavors.  After tasting it I added chopped scallions, which helped some and sprinkled on soy sauce which helped more but it was still pretty tasteless.  I think garlic and maybe  some rice wine vinegar and a touch of mirin and would be worthwhile additions.

for about 4 pieces of tofu, I sliced it up and fried it with olive oil, set it aside and fried up a very small amount of ground pork and sliced onions then mixed it together with 1 tblsp of oyster sauce with about 2 tblsp of water.  It was very tasty.

I was hesitant to make this with all the reviews saying how bland it was.  If you make it as the recipe states it is on the bland side.  Add chopped green onions and some Braggs and it adds a lot more flavor.  If you like the taste of shiitake mushrooms and aren't big on sauces, this is a great recipe.  With my additions I would give a 3 stars.

My family found this recipe way too bland. Maybe with some broccoli and more spices it would be okay, but then it would be a whole new recipe.

This was delicious and I will definetely make it again.  I coated the tofu first in flour and deep fried them to make them crispy.  I did not add the mushrooms or water chestnuts but added more oyster sauce to the snow peas, topped the dish with the fried tofu and my family loved it!

Way to plain, felt like eating cardboard. My family didn't mind it though. I accidently used edame beans (instead of sugar snap peas) and i didn't know the outsides weren't edible, so i had to go through every pod and take out the beans!!! Ugh this recipe only shouold be used on extremaly-plain pallets!!

Good idea, but bland. I didn't use sesame oil (didn't have it in the house...)  but the recipe lacks flavor of any kind. I added garlic and red pepper to give it some taste. I also put in a lot more vegetables- I put in not only snow peas and water chestnuts, but also sliced carrots and broccoli to make a true stir fry. I'll probably make it again, but with lots more flavorings and vegetables. I ate it with coconut rice, and it was a really filling meal.

I was disappointed with this recipe - to me the flavor was rather flat.  Also, I chose to slice the mushrooms.

It DOES look radically different from the others. I had to use what I have on hand which is the plain mushrooms and red pepper. The shitaki mushrooms adds more umami. The dish still is lacking in spices despite an aggressive use of the oyster sauce and a splash of tamari. I also coated the pressed tofu in corn starch to provide some crispness and keep the cubes,cubes when frying.   Added some homemade orange ginger sauce after tasting.

i made this and it came out pretty tasty.  i did not add the water chestnuts but i did use double the oyster sauce and instead of water, i used the water from the reconstituted shitake mushrooms for a bit more flavor.

Fantastic recipe.  My mistake was using too small of a pan...maybe it's time to invest in a wok.  This was wonderful at a Chinese-themed party served with jasmine rice.

This was excellent.  I used garlic olive oil in place of sesame oil.
