I made this last night! It fed seven grown men, 4 little girls and one woman. Had to make a second batch of the crust to use up all the filling. We made 8 individual pot pies and one large one. I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using mixed veggies-Carrots, Corn, Green Beans and Peas. I did everything else according to the directions. The crust was a tad bit on the dry side, I think it could of used just a little more water. All in all it was a huge hit at my house. I fed all those men unexpectedly, and I am glad this recipe provided such a large amount. Thanks for posting it!

I only used the crust and made my own filling. The crust was a bit hard and tasteless. I love the idea of a cheddar crust, but will be looking elsewhere for a recipe for it.

Five stars for the crust!  Used it for my French Canadian Tourtiere and it complimented it nicely.  I will do the Chicken Pot Pie recipe some day, but had to say thank you for the crust recipe!

After all the time and energy that goes into preparing this dish, it was quite tasty.  This is definitely a rainy day recipe when one has nothing else to do but play in the kitchen.  Peas would also have been a nice addition to the broth.

I had leftover turkey and veggies and needed a nice crust recipe.  I found this and thought it looked pretty good.  It was pretty easy to make the crust and we all enjoyed it!  I didn't have any butter in the house so I used some I can't believe it's not butter in the plastic tub and it still seemed to turn out fine.  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe and worth the prep time.  I did not have any cream so I substituted with 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also added some peas.  The cheddar crust is flaky and crisp.  My family ate the entire pie.  I split the veggies and chicken in half to feed 4.

This recipe has has so many options! I basicly followed the recipe but toss in extra veggies and used a can of turky I had and veggie broth. Came home from work had it in the oven within an hour. Great lunch to take to work for winter, yes it makes a good amout for two! This is one of those recipes you could clean out your frig to make!

This recipe was really yummy and made a huge amount!  
However, it did take almost an hour of labor to do.  
I made a few revisions that made it a little easier.  I used my turkey leftovers instead of simmering the chicken.  Then when it called for the broth I used 2c water + 2t bullion.  I boiled all the veggies together: putting the potatoes and carrots in first, then about 8-10 minutes later I added the celery, onion and some other veggies I had in the fridge, and boiled it for another 3-5 minutes.  I skipped step 3 entirely.  
I added garlic powder and seasoned salt to the sauce for extra flavor.
I also had to add extra ice water to the crust to make it stick together.

I don't even have enough pots to put this recipe together! My own recipe is much simpler. Thanks anyway.

This recipe is okay, but when I put this much time into a meal I want it to be much more remarkable. As written, this recipe is very bland, even after I added poultry seasoning to the sauce. Will not make this recipe again.

Great Pie crust recipe. I actually used my own recipe for the filling but I really liked the pie crust. Thanks! :-)

I give this recipe 2 stars...I can't rate it completely fair though, because I only used the cheddar crust.  I hate to give negative reviews, but this crust was dry, tasteless, and very hard. I felt like it needed a lot more butter and more water to hold it together, and also a tsp of salt should've been stirred in with the flour.  Sorry, I think the idea of a cheddar crust is a good one, but it needs to be more of a crust and not a hard, stale, giant cracker.

I used a different filling, but made the crust this recipe calls for. It was a great idea at first. It was flavorless, and rubbery.  I made it according to recipe, rolled ( it was very hard to roll out) and cooked. Ended up having to cook and extra ten minutes and could have went another 5.

To be honest I just used the crust with my own pot pie filling. It turned out wonderful. Saved it for future use. :)

Based on the reviews that said this recipe was bland, I swapped out the original spices and used instead the spices from Tender Pan-Fried Chicken Breasts recipe from this site.  I've never made a crust before, and didn't measure the water - simply added it until the dough started staying together - but it turned out very well, although not as cheesy as I was hoping. I also boiled all the vegetables in homemade chicken broth and pan-fried chicken breasts, which cut out some of the prep time.  It still took a good hour of prep though - definitely a weekend meal.

I cut the recipe in half and even after my bf and I had seconds, there is still plenty left over.  Will definitely make again.
