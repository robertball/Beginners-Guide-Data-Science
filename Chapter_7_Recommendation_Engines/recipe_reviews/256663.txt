We really liked it but for my taste I would use less BBQ sauce (I used a whole bottle) add some water and reduce the cooking time. The jack fruit wasn't as meaty as I thought it would be. All in all very good and I'll be definitely making it again.

Five gold stars! Cooking jackfruit like this really makes you forget it’s not meat. It tastes like lean pork. The only thing missing is the fat! Like the other reviewers, I suggest adding a bit of water especially if your sauce is thick. And, an excellent sauce is crucial. Thank you for the recipe.

Jackfruit is very versatile and this recipe is awesome.  Your bbq sauce will make or break the recipe, so use a good one!  Served with cole slaw this makes a vegetarian dream sandwich and meat eaters will love it too!!

I made this with another recipe on here for bourbon barbecue sauce, my grandma and I both loved it and the rest of my family said it tasted great but they had some issues with the texture. Overall though I give it five stars and they all would give it 3-4 stars. Great recipe and a very creative use of jackfruit thank you for posting!

I made this and my carnivore of a husband even enjoyed it! Could only find canned jackfruit in brine. Reduced cooking time to 3 hours as it seemed finished. Probably depends on your slow cooker; mine tends to run a bit hot. Used a home made raspberry BBQ sauce that was also found on Allrecipes. Ate on a bun with old chedder and pickles. Delish!  Will definitely make again.

It was good, but you’re not fooling anyone. Really didn’t taste like pork. More like barbecued pineapples.

Very good recipe. My meat-eating friend really liked it as did I. Easy and flavorful. I bought a can of Jackfruit at Trader Joes and it was enough for two people, so I cut this recipe down to match that. I never had Jackfruit ever before. I will be making this again soon. Thank you!
