This cake is from my childhood.  I don't think that I can ever think of chocolate layer cake without thinking of this recipe.
****Instead of making this a two layer cake I used the same recipe but made it into a three layer cake instead.  The layers are very thick otherwise.  Also remember to make a little more frosting to cover all three layers.
Handle the layers with care because the cake is very tender.  Be sure to take the time to cream your shortening (butter) and sugar until fluffy --it is time consuming.
Enjoy!

VERY delicious! Buttery and rich! Use Buttermilk and follow the directions, also use REAL BUTTER for the shortening in the cake and Real Butter in the frosting for best results. I make it in a 9x13 pan, but bake it a little longer (maybe 5 minutes) and test with a toothpick.

When I was young my mother got this recipe in a leaflet at Hershey PA.  It has been my favorite ever since.  The only chocolate cake I make.  Everyone raves over it and always want the recipe.  Definitely give this one a try.

found and made this cake tonight for my MIL's birthday! was a hit with the chocoholics (her, my son & me) and the 'boys' (my DH & FIL) who 'don't like chocolate cake because it's too sweet!' very moist. might be considered time-consuming for someone who's never made a scratch-cake, but for me, who makes them for every occassion, it was quite standard and simple (no sifting! yah!). already has a home in my recipe box! would DEFINITELY use again!

I just made the icing, not the cake.  This is awesome!  It's smooth like pudding and tastes great!  I couldn't have asked for anything better, I don't even like chocolate and I love this.

This was the worst chocolate cake I have ever made. 1. You need slightly more than 1/2 cup of boiling water, otherwise, when the chocolate mixes with it, it just becomes crumbly. I ended up having to add more chocolate to the creamed mixture. 2. One of the layers fell apart when I went to take it out of the pan. 3. The icing recipe is not enough to cover the cake.

Although this cake was relatively moist, compared to other recipes from scratch I've done, it still does not have the tastiness of the mixes in my opinion. One big problem was it stuck to the pan terribly, I even took extra precautions so that it didn't, but it still did so be careful! Didn't make the frosting however, I used store-bought. Not as light and fluffy of a cake as I would have hoped but not bad in terms of homemade.
