Excellent main dish! Filling, tasty, easy to prepare. Was a hit with the family. I had only used a 14.5 oz. can of Italian stewed tomatoes, will use the 28 oz can as directed next time for more sauce. Still, a keeper!

definitely needed some seasoning, so i added salt, freshly ground black pepper, and about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and it tasted fine.  and unless you're tiny eaters, this does definitely not make enough for 8 people - it's just barely enough for 4.  :)

Tried this last nite for a change regular pasta & sauce, and was surprised at how good it really is! I did leave out the mushrooms, and added a can of tomato sauce to make it go further. I also added an extra clove of garlic (YUM) and everyone really liked it!

A bit too bland and watery. Maybe next time I'll add a half pint of heavy whipping cream to thicken it.

Unexciting, though not bad.  Basically,                                    you're making your own spaghetti
sauce (with chicken).  It's nice that the tomatoes are in somewhat discrete chunks, as    
are the mushrooms and onion, but really there is no special flavor to this
dish other than traditional unexciting spaghetti sauce.

I was surprised at good this was considering how easy it was to make. I altered the ingredients slightly (I like my sauces on the spicy side). I thought that the recipe called for too much onion but I used a whole one anyway. Glad that I did as I think thats what made the recipe. Between the onion and not using any paste, this is the perfect summer sauce. I'm looking fwd to making this again, but with hot sausage instead of chicken.

This was decent although it was a bit bland as others mentioned. I did add a green pepper and some crushed red pepper for some kick. Nice simple supper. I would certainly make it again with a bit more seasoning.

Quick and easy. The sauce was light and is a good base for adding other ingredients, as well as being good on its own.  I almost always have the ingredients for this sitting around, so it's a great go-to method when I don't know what else to make.

We had this tonight for dinner.  I agree with the other posters that it was watery and lacking in the spice department.  I think that by thickening the sauce and adding some fresh veggies and herbs, it will be really good.

NICE RECIPE!but a bit bland. I added 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese and seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper before frying.

I was craving chicken with pasta for weeks, so I was thrilled when I found this recipe.  We didn't even have to go buy any groceries first!  It was much tastier than the plain old pasta and sauce we usually have.  We only used half the onion, and I think next time I will use more seasoning... but it was definitely a hit.  I'll make it again for sure.

I thought it was good, not great.  My husband loved it and the kiddos thought it was just OK.  Will probably make again with some modifications.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
