Very good! I was planning on making my own Japanese seven spice (even printed out a recipe for it), but after looking in the cupboard, I realized that I actually had a brand new bottle on hand (YAY! Not sure why I bought it, but I was glad I did!). The flavor were great and the guys loved it...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I haven’t made this yet but how come it’s called a tuna roll when there is no tuna in it ?
