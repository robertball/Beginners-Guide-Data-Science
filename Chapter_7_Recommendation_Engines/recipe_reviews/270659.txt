Excellent recipe. Eggs and avocado came out creamy and flavorful.   Good for an elegant lunch or as a light main course for supper. Serve it with a green salad.   Especially good for me as a diabetic because its carbohydrate count is low. It is now on my meal plan rotation.   I would recommend using a large avocado so your egg can fit comfortably in the cavity.  Also seated my avocado halves in a sprayed muffin tin to stabilize them. I did not lose any egg due to spillage.  BTW, the avocado skin is edible much like the skin of a baked potato.

This tasted very good, but there was quite a bit of waste with the egg whites since they all spilled over onto the cookie sheet.
