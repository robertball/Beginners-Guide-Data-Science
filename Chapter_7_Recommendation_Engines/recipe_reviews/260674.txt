Did not work in my Instant Pot. Triggered the "burn" message. Added more liquid to the batter but it failed three times and I had to give up. This is why you have to test recipes before throwing them out on the internet...

Like the other review said it didn't work...or so I thought. I followed all the directions and was very disappointed that it was the consistency of pudding to the touch when it was "finished". Figuring it was ruined I decided to try using the manual setting for 10 minutes. What could I loose right? Imagine my surprise when it still felt like pudding. I decided to go for broke and try one more time for 15 minutes. It was still like pudding. So I figure I'll throw it out when I clean up the kitchen after dinner. About an hour later I go to throw it out and notice that the sides have pulled away from the pot a bit. I'm not gonna lie I got a little excited. I pulled a knife out and when around the edges and flipped it onto a plate just like the directions said fully expecting to here a plop of pudding consistency lies. Instead I got an almost perfect cake. I say almost perfect because the bottom was scorched from being heated so much but the rest of the cake is perfect. It reminds me of a reine de saba with consistency and flavor. Next time I fully intend to let it sit in the pot before heating more.

The only changes I made was using 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder instead of baking soda because I didn't have any baking powder. And I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter. I saw a previous reviewer saying it was runny like pudding. Mine wasn't runny at all. Once I added the flour it stiffened up immediately.

This recipe is unmakable. The BURN message comes up after about one minute. ALso how can you possibly expect to cook with any kind of pressure with the vent open as called for in the directions? This was a total waste of time effort and ingredients.
