I am not a very good cook (I admit it) and tried this recipe.  While it was slightly time consuming (browning the meats) this is by far the best sauce I have ever had (and I grew up in an Italian family!).  It is worth the work and everyone that tastes this sauce absolutely loves it.  I put in more garlic because I am a garlic lover and used pork chops (because I don't even know what Pork Neck Bones are and couldn't find them!).  The meat added the most incredible flavor to the sauce and the pork literally fell off of the bone because it cooked so nicely in the sauce.  I highly reccomend this recipe and it is the only recipe for sauce that I use now.

YUM!  I whirled the tomatoes (Italian style) through the blender, but only because my clan doesn't like chunks, and I added some shredded Italian blend cheese, about 1/4 cup, to the meatballs.  Oh yeah, I forgot to add the wine, but I did add pinches of oregano & basil here & there.  This turned out delicious.  Hubby AND son told me that it was really good (and hubby is not fond of change..especially when it comes to his favorite, which is spaghetti sauce).  A keeper in my book, thanks Flocco!!  Next time I'll add the wine.

I was looking for a new pasta sauce recipe and this one caught my eye because of all the meat in it.  My kids, who are picky eaters, loved the sauce and the meatballs!  This one's a keeper for me!

This recipe is for people who have the time to spend in the kitchen.  Although it was stated that the prep time would be 45 minutes, I spent an hour and a half with this recipe.  It could be because I made twice the number of meatballs. The browning of the meats is very time consuming. I chose not to use the wine and substitued chicken stock instead.  The flavor was OK, I think that I would only make this recipe when I'm in the mood to cook most of the afternoon.

My Aunt made a sauce like this a few years ago and we all loved it. I used country ribs (they're meatier than the regular ribs) rather than neck bones and I also sauteed some mushrooms with the onions and garlic. I've been trying to get my husband to eat more veggies so I sauteed some celery, bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini, and blended them before sneaking them into the sauce.

Classic Recipe.  I cannot use alcohol so chicken or beef broth is what I use.  I omit any additional salt.  I love the neck bones but have also used country spare ribs and oxtail in the sauce.  Now I'm hungry for it.  Good thing I have some stached in the freezer.

Other than cutting the recipe in half, I followed it to a "T", neck bones and all. Everyone loved it, including my Italian hubby!
