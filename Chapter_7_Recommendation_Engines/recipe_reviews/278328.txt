No changes and this was very good.  I used these chaffles when I was craving a BLT.

This is a great recipe that can be changed up depending on what you're using them for.  I added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon for our morning waffles!  I added garlic and onion powder for my tuna melt.  For the grilled cheese, I added a little bacon and onion seasoning.  The possibilities are endless!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Cheddar cheese and taco seasonings for a taco burger... see... get creative!

This is a fluffy Chaffel. I added cinnamon and pure vanilla. You cant even taste the cheese or egg. Great substitute for waffels without spiking your sugar

I bought a mini waffle maker yesterday. I have been on the Keto diet for over 3 months and so, of course, I have been jonseing for bread and English muffins for that long. This recipe is my first attempt at any chaffle. I fried up some burgers and "sandwiched" them with these chaffles. It was heavenly! I am going to try other chaffle recipes, but this is a winner! We are going to do sloppy Joes tonight on these chaffles, open faced probably. Yum!

This is great! Didn't have mozzarella, so I used Monterey Jack. The only problem I had was making the first one - using half the mixture overflowed my mini waffle maker. I can't wait to try this with other cheeses.

I made these Chaffles according to the recipe and they turned out great! A great Keto alternative for breakfast or a treat. They were definitely worth the 2 grams of carbs each!! I will make them again!!

These were so easy to make, and taste, look and smell just like traditional waffles. I did add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. With butter and sugar free syrup, these were wonderful!
