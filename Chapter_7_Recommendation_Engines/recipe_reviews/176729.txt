I live in Japan and subscribe to a grocery service that invariably sends me a daikon each week. These are not US daikon, my daikon are HUGE. My biggest shocker was the 5 kilo daikon. It was like a cricket bat! Needless to say, I struggle to use up all that daikon weekly and I frequently give it away to Japanese friends. 

Not anymore. This recipe is fabulous. EVERYONE, including the picky 6 year old, LOVED this recipe. I have made it twice now, served as a side dish, but I can see making it on a large scale for party nibbles. 

The only change I was forced to make was the sriracha - the only thing I had on hand was Thai chili sauce, which worked very well and added a nice tang. I was generous with it - probably more like a tablespoon, as it was sweet chili sauce. I also fried the cakes in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan - not near as much as the recipe called for.

Seriously, if you have daikon in the house, make this. This recipe will change your opinion of daikon - it has changed mine - I now look forward to the daikon rather than dread them.

Very good. I found it a bit too salty, so you can reduce the salt and when draining the daikon, press out some extra water. If you find that the patties are not holding, add an extra egg. I used garlic chili sauce and homemade corg (Caramelized Onion and Roasted Garlic) jelly as sauces. Excellent.

I made this a lot healthier by baking the cakes on a cookie sheet lightly sprayed with a cooking spray.  10 - 12 minutes per side, in a pre-heated 425 degree oven resulted in crispy, nicely browned cakes.  I also used Egg  Beaters, instead of eggs to further reduce calories.  My 4 star rating is based on the seasonings... I think they could be improved.  Next time, I plan to try Old Bay seasoning, with plain bread crumbs (Panko), instead of the Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Overall, I really enjoyed these and will definitely try them again.  Perhaps, I'll someday try adding diced Chinese sausage, as with the more traditional recipes.

Yummy!  I skipped direction #1 and instead grated my daikon the night prior [tip from the previous reviewer] and squeeze the liquid out before use.  Added 1 tsp of Sriracha because I like the tang.  I didn't have Italian bread crumb; so, I added 1/2 tsp of Italian dressing powder mix.  Delicious & easy to cook.  [Must have taste buds for daikon radish.]  This recipe is a keeper, thank you!

Instead of using only daikon, I mixed sweet potatoe and daikon radish.

Alright, so I made a big mistake because I used turnips instead of radishes (grated, soaked in salt, etc.), BUT this recipe was so versatile and delicious that it turned out just fine. The only change I made other than that was added some crunched up crackers in addition to the bread crumbs because my mixture was too wet and I wanted it to have a little extra crunch to it. This was delicious! I made a very similar recipe for zucchini patties a few months ago, but honestly I liked this one better. I might try to make this with radishes next, but just in case anyone is curious, it does work great with turnips.

Like the other reviewers, I found this weird radish thing in my CSA basket and was all like, "Huh?"  So Allrecipes to the rescue and I decided to make these radish patties!  THEY WERE GREAT.  I let my radishes stand on a kitchen towel for the better part of an afternoon (I had plenty of time) so I could cut down on salt content.  I added some green onions so I could use them before they went bad and left out the hot sauce (didn't have any.)  Other than that, I followed the recipe and was pleasantly surprised.  Thanks for giving me something to do besides host fake sword fights with the gigantic radishes I got with my CSA!

Very tasty and pretty easy to make! I used much less oil - enough to cover the bottom of the pan (maybe 1/4 inch worth) and green onions instead of red. They turned out great. Also, I skipped the step of salting and draining the daikon because I had grated mine the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.

We received three large daikon in our CSA delivery and I had no idea what to do with them before I found this recipe.  These are wonderful!

This was surprisingly good!  I had a feeling nobody would eat it - after all, who eats fried radishes? - but I had to use them up.  These were DEVOURED and everyone wanted more!  They were pretty easy to make, although they didn't hold together as well as I would have liked.  I think next time I'll add a little more of the Sriracha sauce, they didn't have much bite as is.

What a delicious thing to do with daikon!  Even made with vegan and gluten free with a flax "egg" (1 tbsp ground flax mixed with 3 tbsp water) and ground oats with a 1/4 tsp italian seasoning.  It works to oil some parchment paper and bake for 9 minutes at 400 degrees and flip and bake for another 9 minutes.  Squeezed out the water from the shredded daikon too as suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor is close to a spring roll, and the texture is like a crab cake.  

Here were mistakes I made that you should avoid:
I did not drain the daikon well enough, so the mixture was too wet and did not hold together.
I did not chop the red onions small enough, and the larger pieces fell off of the patty.
I used the full amount of recommended oil, and the first batch of patties fell apart and floated in the pool of oil. I drained my pan and used a thin layer of oil for better results with the second batch.

Other changes:
I did not have paprika so I used cayenne (1/4 teaspoon).  They were spicy!
I did not have Sriracha so I used a Thai chili garlic sauce.
I did not have bread crumbs, so I made some out of pulverized wheat toast. Still warm, so the steam might have kept the patty from holding together.

Even though we ate the pieces with a fork like it was a side of rice, it was very tasty!

LOVE IT! I didn't use the salt to dry out the daikon since I never really use salt - just shredded and used paper towels to remove moisture.  OH, and I coated the patties in Panko (Japanese style bread crumbs) so that they had an added crunch on the outside!


This was totally an awesome way to use daikon, and I will be using this recipe in my regular rotation for sure! Thank you for sharing!

Made these with the crazy abundance of Shunkyo radish we got from our first few CSA boxes of the season and fresh chives in place of the red onion. Very solid meat-free burger option, but was more a score for me as it allowed me to clear out all those radishes. Won't wonder what to do with them next year.

Also, the greens on the Shunkyo radish are delightfully tender. Go right into salad without blanching. Excellent.

This recipe was a good way to use up the daikon radishes we got in our CSA box last week. I didn't have garlic so I skipped it, and I used green onions instead of red onions, chili powder instead of paprika, skipped the Sriracha, and added some dried dill. My husband liked it and so did I. I don't know if I would go out of my way to get the daikon radishes to make this again, but it was easy and tasty. We liked them with homemade yogurt on top!

These were so good! A wonderful answer to the weekly question of "How the heck do I cook THIS??" that my CSA prompts me to ask myself weekly.  I came up just shy of the full 1-1/2 c of daikon, but didn't reduce the amounts of other ingredients.  I subbed the red onions for green onion/scallions, and used WAY less oil (about 1/3 c).  Served with sweet chili sauce.  VERY tasty!!

Just made this recipe. It's really, really, really good. Wow! Daikon cake is my favorite dim sum, hands down. Now I can make it, or at least this version of it, at home. A friend brought me the daikon from a trip to the Japanese neighborhood in Torrence, California.

Good Recipe. I was a little worried because I have never used diakon. I added shitake mushrooms and chili peppers. I also made a persimmon sauce that went excellent with the cakes!

I must not have drained my radishes enough because my mixture ended up being too wet to form into patties. I added a little more breadcrumbs and then pressed the mix into small rectangular dishes and stuck them in the freezer for an hour before trying to fry. These turned out very good. I think I will try adding diced shrimp next time for added flavor but good as written too.

This was the tastiest way to enjoy one of these huge radishes. I would stress draining them thoroughly, as they can fall apart during frying. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! My husband claims he doesn't like radish's, so i didn't tell him daikon is in the radish family and very similar... the whole family loved them!! I changed the serving size to 8 and used dried onion flakes instead of red onion. Also i added a touch of curry and cayenne, we like spice and yellow curry flavor. Totally making these again!!

Delicious!  I bought a daikon on accident (thought it was a parsnip) and had to figure out what to do with it.  I tried this recipe because I had all the ingredients home.  These are so tasty!  They are a bit too salty even though I added less and tried to rinse the daikon before draining.  I ate it with steamed rice and it balanced out the salt nicely.  One thing I should have done was dice the onions smaller so they blended into the patty better.  Our first time preparing daikon, but we will be making these again!

This is a great use of a daikon radish, but the picture is deceiving. The taste was fine, a bit bland. I would up the Sriracha or put in something that gives it more taste. Do salt the daikon beforehand - I even strained and squeezed it out with paper towel. Very watery. My "cakes" came out wetter than wished before frying and therefore the middle wasn't so done, but still was good. This is a very creative use for these cakes and I would say play around with this recipe and figure out what works for you!

So good! I used more Sriacha (a really good squirt) but followed everything else (pan frying, not the large amount of oil). Used a spicy sauce to cover, such as Dillapeno, Garlic Aioli Mustard Sauce

Delicious - the perfect use for the random daikon I had in the fridge. Didn't change anything, though I sweated the daikon on paper towel, and then squeezed out all the water I could before making the batter. Fried in a wok on high, 3 patties at a time for 90 seconds each side. They turned out crispy & full of flavour. Making some more tomorrow.

Very good recipe.  I had told my husband that I was going to try a new vegetable and I chose a daikon radish!! This recipe was a great introduction to a new veggie and we both enjoyed it and I would make it again. I mixed some sarachi and mayo for some dipping sauce along with teriyaki pork loin. It made for a great dinner.

Great recipe for an item we don't usually find in our kitchen. They even reheated well, and I was able to get my teenager to eat some!

Very simple to make, though I did have to add an extra egg to keep it all together when I fried it.  Maybe I didn't squeeze out enough water from the radish?  I also used only half the salt it called for, and a touch more garlic-siracha (yum).  I ate these with sour cream, and my husband garnished his with more siracha.  Next time I will grate the onion instead of mincing it.  You could easily add in zucchini or grated potato too.  I could see making these as vegetable pancakes.

I'll give the recipe a five star rating.  I made it with daikon radish as written.  The only adjustment I had to make was to use plain bread crumbs and Italian seasoning.  I thought overall it was a little bland, but that's what condiments are for.  A drop of sriracha chili sauce on top of the cakes was a perfect touch.  I'm going to use this recipe again later this summer when the zucchini starts to set on.  Really, when you consider all the other ingredients, the radish is just a bulk agent, so zucchini or any other mild vegetable will work as a great substitute.

This was awesome!! I got Daikon in a co-op basket and looked up this recipe.  I didn't have the chili sauce, so I added some Louisiana hot sauce, which I will add more of the next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

I found that little changes to the recipe don't really matter much- I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so used Panko and threw in some Penzyes "Pizza Seasoning"- also used "Italian" seasoning as an extra. Didn't have red onion once, so I've used green onion, and also shallots in the past- I've dressed them with mayo mixed with dill, lemon, and garlic. I fry them in ghee mixed with grape seed oil- but I think any oil or butter would be great. They're a big hit every time I make them- they are delicious! One tip- not only do I salt and let rest over night to remove water, I then throw the grated radish into a towel and squeeze to remove more. The drier the radish is, the easier is stays together once you throw in the rest of the ingredients. Thanks so much for the recipe- this is a keeper!!

It didn't hold together as well as I would have liked when I was frying it.  Otherwise, it was very tasty.  Maybe I needed to grate the daikon a bit finer and use flour instead of breadcrumbs.

I had an abundance of about 4 other types of radish & decided to try this with them. It was awesome! I eyeballed all ingredients & used green onion & garlic chive instead of red onion. Instead of Italian flavored breadcrumbs, I had some leftover homemade breadcrumbs & sprinkled in some Herbes de Provence for flavor.  I served with a Sriracha mayo mix like several of the others. My kid was turning her nose at the idea of a radish cake until she tasted it. This is definitely a repeat!

This was AMAZING!!! I didn't have purple onions on hand, so I substituted with shallots. It was loaded with flavor, and for a dipping sauce I made a garlic chili aioli. Will def. make this again!

I made this because I had some daikon I didn't know how to use.  It was too salty but still really, really good - my husband called them "addictive".

This recipe is fantastic.  My boyfriend can't believe these are made with a radish!  I use sage instead of paprika which gives them a taste similar to traditional thanksgiving stuffing.  Also, like others, I use only enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan and fry the cakes in that.  Great recipe!

Pretty good.  I wish I had not only squeezed the shredded radish but had also run fresh water over it.  It was too salty.  I will make again.

When they say salt and let stand for 1/2 hour do it! If you are worried about saltiness, rinse and squeeze out the juices. The salt gets rid of overly strong flavor. I used green onion tops instead of red onions and it was great! Pan fried in a nonstick pan with 1 cup of oil. No leftovers!

I used white onion instead of red onion because I don't like the acidity, and my mix was a little too dry, so I added another egg, but otherwise followed exactly and this was a HUGE hit.  Very tasty!

Huge hit! It can be difficult to cook in a multi-generational household when everyone has a different diet. (Vegan, pescatarian, dairy-free, diabetic, and more) When I find a recipe everyone likes, I wish I could give it a special bonus rating. This would get the bonus rating. I made this recipe twice, once with an egg, per the recipe, and a second time, vegan, with an avocado and flax seeds in place of the egg. Both ways are fantastic.

This was a nice recipe to use up all the radishes my neighbor gave me! They weren't daikon but we still liked it. It tasted good but turned into more of a hashbrown than a patty.

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned into a wonderful and delightful surprise treat.  They were so good that I had them for dinner without any meat; this coming from a true carnivore.
I will make this again, definitely!

I made some changes. I used a combination of green, & purple daikons then added some grated carrots. I made it vegan & gluten free by using flax eggs & a mixture of ground walnuts & gluten free oats. I baked them at 400 in a parchment lined baking sheet; I didn't oil it. I also doubled the recipe the second time. My husband is a pretty picky eater & he loved them both times I made it!

Vegetarian crab cakes!!! Delicious. 
I grated the radish n let it sit for 2 hours . I use light salt as my palate prefers less salt. Added cilantro n less onion. I used white onion. 
Coated the outside with extra bread crumb to absorb moisture n gain crispy texture. Fried in old fried chicken oil. 
Will serve with a roumalade   definitely make again. Seems great for parties

Oh so yummy. I followed the recipe to the T and they turned out very nice...a little bit of crisp and slightly chewy inside. I ate mine plain, but my family tried Sriracha and Hoisin Sauce.

I randomly purchased Daikon at the store (trying more veggies). I found this recipe and LOVED IT!  Thanks.

Had never used daikon before but wanted to.  Liked this recipe a lot.

Found the daikon to be surprisingly juicy. Had to compensate by adding bread crumbs. Next time, I would probably squeeze out some of that extra liquid with a kitchen towel.

Served with a sriracha sauce, this tasted exactly like a stuffed quahog, if you've ever had one of those. I'm from Rhode Island, where we love our stuffies, so that's high praise!

be careful that the bread crumbs you use don't already have spices, especially salt. Ours were a wee bit salty because we did not consider this, but otherwise excellent. 

Am thinking about modifying a bit by dipping in egg and panko. Had some like that in China and they were delicious.

Yummy!  These were even good cold. I doubled the eggs just to be sure they stuck together because the radishes were still pretty wet. Served them as a side to Greek chicken patty. Perfect dinner!

Just made this and I liked it a lot.  Kind of tastes like an eggroll crab cake..without the crab.  We got the large radish in our CSA and so I was happy to be able to find something tasty to do with it. I'm actually excited we didn't use it all up.  All I did different was use leeks instead of red onion, because that's what I had and I tried to make some kind of chili garlic sauce with hot sauce and soyaki(trader joes marinade)  Anyways, pretty much did the recipe, was good!

Very tasty recipe. I was surprised by the complex flavors of the dish. You can use less salt and less oil than called for. They were great cold for breakfast too.

i'm gna blame the fact that i used regular radishes.. i used 1/4 of a white onion.. and a little less than 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs.. it just didn't have much of a flavor other than onions and radishes.. i dipped them in sweet chili sauce and it was "okay"

Wow! Who would have thought that a "radish" would taste this good! The whole family loved this dish. I've been told I can fix this anytime. I served it with chili sauce/mayo mix that was good on it.

Great use of Daikon Radishes.  I got a bunch from the CSA I am in and was at a loss as to what to use them with since I do not like the tang of a radish.  This was a great use and was delicious.  I used a little garlic aioli as a dip for them and it worked wonderfully.

WAY too salty, but will try again with salt to taste because I can imagine it would be good if the salt was less.

Good recipe. The daikon radish cakes were enjoyed also by a friend of mine who would never touch a radish.  I did, however, take some other comments advice to cut back on the salt and the oil. It worked out fine. One of my farmer friends gave me more daikon radishes and I am bringing the cakes to a family dinner.
