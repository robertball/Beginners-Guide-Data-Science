One of my favorite things to grill.  The meat you choose is just as important as the marinade.  I like to go to this little mexican carnecería, which is a butcher.  They sell the meat that really gives that authentic fajitas taste and look, you can get them it long slaps or you can ask them to cut them up in strips (if you can speak spanish, or they understand english), I'll tell you now, its easier to cook when they're in long slabs. I usually order about 5 lbs. if its just me, my fiance and group of friends.  My marinade is simple.  I get a bottle of lime juice and this Fajita seasoning called Fiesta Brand extra fancy fajita seasong...which i got at wal-mart..it is in my opinion the best seasoning to use..and i've tried all the pre-made fajita seasoning and i tried combining a bunch of seasoning to make my own...nothing compares.  But anyway with 5 lbs of meat i use atleast 3-4 cups of lime juice and enough fajita seasoning to cover the layers of meat i spread out in a very large tubberwear and refridgerate for a few hours.

Great recipe! I used olive oil vs. veg oil and fresh lim juice instead of lemon juice (2 Tbsp. of each) I left out the lemon peel and added 2 Tbsp. of soy sauce and 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke. This was more than enough marinade for 2 lbs. of flank steak. I put everything into a ziploc bag into and let it marinade for the full 8 hours turning it a couple of times during marinating. I grilled this vs. frying in a skillet. I did however fry some green peppers and onions. This was excellent with warm tortillas and all the fixen's: salsa, guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese!

I used sirlion steak sliced thin, that is what we had, anyway I just used all the marinade on the meat let it marinade for about 6 hours, put the steaks on the grill after they were finished grilling I used my kitchen scissors to slice up the beef, after I grilled the steak I put tortillas on the grill 3 at a time, shut the lid and let them warm for about 30 seconds served this with all the traditional fajita sides, the steak was so tender and my whole family loved this super easy dish, using the grill instead of a frying pan makes clean up super easy

Good recipe. I was looking for a replacement to the store bought fajita seasoning packets all the msg and chemicals yuck. I used lime juice instead of the lemon and was pleased with the results. Thanks, for sharing!

What a gorgeous combination!  I sliced the beef and put it in an airtight container to marinate overnight.  The flavors really permeated the meat.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Didn't care much for this. Was looking for a fajita like in a restaurant and got a saucy funny tasting beef dish instead.

These were really good! A little too lemony for my taste so next time I think I will leave the zest out, but other than that they were fantastic!

Really good, I followed someone elses suggestion and left the steak whole and grilled it.  I used the other half of the marinade on the peppers and onions.  It was all very tasty!

Super Easy -- Toss it all together in the morning and dinner's ready in a flash that evening.  I baked my tortillas once they were filled with the beef, cheese, sour cream, refried beans, etc. to make them crispy on the edges.  Delicious!

Not too great, sorry, I can't imagine what I did wrong.  After reading all of the other reviews, I thought this was going to be delish... I'll pass next time.

The lemon flavor was really nice; I didn't find it to be too much at all. 

I broke this recipe up in two parts which made it even easier. The night before I cut the meat in strips, mixed up the marinade/sauce and put it in the bag to marinate. Taking these steps the night before made the after-work dinner rush even easier.

My changes: 

I added a 1/2 t of cumin to the marinade/sauce because I like that flavor a lot, as well.
 
Like some others, I added red pepper strips and big onion slices because we could use the veggies around here.
 
I also took another reviewer's advice: I reserved the liquid after draining the meat/veggies, added 1 t of cornstarch to the liquid and simmered that for a little while. It made a lovely lemony sauce (and was thick enough so that it didn't drip out of your tortilla). 

A really great AND EASY recipe that takes hardly any time at all. I'll definitely be going back to this one again.

I had some left over roast that I wanted to use for fajitas, so I mixed up the marinade, cut the roast into strips, and let it soak in the marinade for about 10 minutes.  Then I sauted an onion, poured the meat and marinade into the skillet, added a tomato and let it heat up. It was fabulous!

It turned out to lemony so added more garlic, red pepper & cumin.  It helped a little bit.

Didn't have enough lemon juice, so used lime juice and lime peel too.  Still didn't have the full amount, but it tasted great.  Only marinated for 2 hours.  Wrapped it with guacamole, lettuce, salsa and cheddar cheese.  Will make again.

My husband raved about this recipe.  I sauted the traditional peppers and onions with the extra marinade and put them in the tortillas with the meat. I could taste the lemon, so I think next time I will cut down on the lemon just a bit. Thanks!

I added 1 tablespoon sugar as well, it was still a bit lemony. Will use less lemon juice next time. But it came out good and my husband loved it.

This was not good.  It may have been because there was too much lemon juice. Sorry, but I just can't justify EVER using this recipe again.

I had doubled the recipe and didn't have enough lemon juice so I added lime juice, I also increased the chili powder and added cumin. Next time I fix it I will add some red pepper flakes for more spice. It was really good.

Made this for my family for dinner.  Substituted the lemom juice/zest for lime juice/zest.  Would love to have marinated this overnight, but didn't have time.  Only marinated for about 20 minutes and it came out very flavorful.  Definate do over.

I substituted the lemon juice with fresh lime juice and added a pinch of sugar and cumin. After cooking the meat, I cooked some thinly sliced onion and bellpeppers along with the green onions. Nice.

These were good. I used Lime juice, instead of lemon, because i dont like lemon, and didnt use the lemon zest. it just needed a little bit more flavor. they were good though. thanks for sharing:)

Next time add 1tsp. to marinade. Cut the meat into strips before marinating. When cooking, sweat onions and peppers, turn heat up full bore to evap. liquid. Throw meat in and get some char on meat and peppers. Whisk in a little corn starch. Before serving add liberally cumin, salt to taste and ground coriander, lime juice, tapatio hot sauce.

This was pretty good and easy to make. It could have had a little more zing, though. Served with sauteed peppers and onions, salsa, avocado slices, grated cheese and sour cream. Thanks!

Super recipe!  My kids and husband loved it. I was afraid they were going to think it was too spicy, but they didn't. They even liked the bell peppers and onions, which all of them usually don't like.

I made these this week for my family. Everyone thought the lemon taste was overwhelming. I ended up trying to cover up the lemon and added cumin, chilli powder, and cayenne pepper. Didn't really work.

Overall good recipe. Didn't quite have the kick I was looking for though. It had too much of an overpowering lemon taste. And it lacked the boldness that I enjoy with a fajita recipe.

I used left over steak, added some green chili sauce with the veggies and served with fresh avocado. Definitely the best fajitas we have had at home.
