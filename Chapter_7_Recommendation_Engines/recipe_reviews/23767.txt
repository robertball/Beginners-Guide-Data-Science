Superb!  I've been giving neighbors and friends a bag of pears from my tree along with the recipe and everyone just loves it!  It certainly satisfies a sweet tooth.  The almond although complimentary to the pears, was a bit too strong, so I put 1/2 tsp. almond, along with 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I also sprinkle some brown sugar on top.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe Nancy.  Everyone I've shared it with loves it, but I'm running out of pears!!!  Fran

My family really liked this pie.  I did as others and replaced the white sugar with brown and used half almond flavoring and vanilla.  Good way to use pears that are getting too ripe.

This recipe was good. However, I followed one of the reviewer's recipe. I used 6 pears, 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup sugar. Next time, I think I would use cinnamin in the custard. I did sprinkle cinnamin and sugar on the top of the pie once it came out of the oven. It gave it a little more flavor.  My husband LOVED it!

It was my first time making a custard pie and it turned out very delicious! My mother can't have too much sugar so i used half a cup this time and it tasted great - it made room for the flavor of the pears. I would take out the pie when the custard is just starting to firm, as i overcooked mine a bit. But it all depends on what your preference is for the custard - i like mine tender.

I have made this several times now, with different ready-bought crusts, and it always comes out yummy!! The only thing I change is I use half the sugar, but that's a personal preference. One time I really wanted pie but all I had around was canned pineapple, so I used that instead of pears... works great! So fast and easy! =)

I'm sorry, we didn't like this pie. I made in a 10 in. deep pie dish. I doubled the custard part and added more pears and increased baking time according to the size of my pie until center was set. The custard came out really firm and not custardy at all and I could barely taste the pears. I used bartlet and they were nice and ripe. I am an experienced baker and was very disappointed with this. I'm sorry, I guess we all have different tastes.

Yummy!  We are trying to watch our sugar, so I used 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda.  We only had 2 large Asian pears, so they are still a little crunchy.  Next time I will use bartletts.  I also added a handful of raisins (that I plumped in hot water) and they added some another layer of flavor and texture.  I thought the almond extract was just perfect.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for a great recipe--one more thing, we ate it right out of the oven and it was great, can't wait to taste it tomorrow when it is cold as recipe called for.

This was very pretty, but not as tasty as it looked. I found it bland and there was not enough pear flavor. The almond was good, and I added vanilla, but it needed something more - perhaps cinnamon? It also needs a higher filling to crust ratio. I'd recommend Pear Pie III on this site if you want something similar, but better.

It was a very easy pie to make with the frozen pie crust, and the almond flavour was a nice change of taste.  Very delicious!

This was really yummy. Both the crust & the custard were great but the custard was a little too sweet for my taste so I will reduce the amount of sugar next time. Also, I will make my pear slices bigger next time as my small ones sunk very quickly into the custard.

Delicious.  Followed the suggestions of others re using brown sugar and half vabilla half almond essence.  Did not bake in a pie crust - did not want the extra calories, and although did not serve up quite as attractivly as a result, was still very tasty indeed.  I might next time add some cinnamon as well??  Definately a keeper!

A wonderful way to use all of the pears from our trees!  I have made it 2 ways, once with almond extract and once with vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon- the vanilla version definitley got more votes in my household!  I also sprinkled a bit of cinnamon sugar on top for color- it was wonderful!

My son said, "I like pie" as he was eating this. My hubby said it reminded him of the rhubarb custard pie his mom made when he was growing up. I thought the pie was really flavorful. I sprinkled the top of the pie with cinnamon and sugar for a little extra color and flavor.  The pie was pretty sweet, so next time I think I'll cut the sugar to 3/4 c. The custard was a bit firmer than most custard pies. I might add a 1/4 c. cream next time; although my husband liked it just as it was. I defintely will make this again!

Absolutely delicious - followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I'm sure there are adjustments that could be made, but start with the original and go from there.  I'm going to add ground almonds to the crust next time.  The consistency was perfect and the almond flavoring really enhanced the pears.  This will be a staple!

This is fabulous!!!  I have made it a dozen times now and it always turns out!  I always put the pears in first and the filling over the top so it's easier to work with.  Don't forget the Almond Extract, this is what really makes it great!

This was pretty good.  I sliced and boiled two over-ripe pears and then drained them so the pie wouldn't be too watery.  I then added a drained can of pears to supplement the number of pears.  I substituted vanilla extract for almond extract and added a Tbsp. of cinnamon.  I mixed all the filling ingredients together and baked at 375 for 36 min and it was cooked perfectly.  The texture is nice, firm, and easy to cut.  The pie doesn't have a strong enough "pear" taste to suit me, but overall, it was good and easy.

My son and I share alot of the cooking duties at our house and today we made this together. I made the pastry shell, and he did the rest. He is a novice cook, but this pie was easy and might i add, Delish, the flavor is very subtle, delicate on the pallet. A very nice change from over the top, packed full of flavor desserts.

This pie was alright...it takes a while to get used to that eggy flavour, but it was really between three and four stars. My hubby didn't like it at first, but the next day he finished the whole thing himself!

This was delicious.  I followed a few reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1/2 Cup, added a little cinnamon and vanilla and sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  I'm looking forward to trying with other fruits such as mangos, and strawberries which will need more sugar.

Great! very quick and easy to make.  I only had 2 eggs and the custard texture was perfect.  Will try with less sugar next time as found a tad too sweet but then did sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on during cooking!

This was so quick and easy to whip up...will be good when guest drop by.  First time have ever made a fresh pear pie and this is delicious way to eat your pears.

I read that it was supposed to have a custard texture but when i made it it was bread-ish in texture.  I have no idea if i may have done something wrong, maybe baked too long.  The Man-Thing thought the flavor was okay  but the texture was just not what one would expect when biting into a pie.  If i ever get more pears that i need to do something with i will try it again simply because it bugs me that something, although i dont know what, had to have been done wrong.  If/when  i do try again hopefully i can revise and give it 5 stars and figure out what NOT to do :)

This pie was delicious. Used 3 pears like the recipe says and it had a wonderful pear taste. Also used the combination of almond and vanilla flavorings. Will make this again. Guests also loved it!

although it tasted good, mine came out very runny- i only baked it for 25 minutes. i used 2/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white. next time i would do 1/2 c. brown only since it came out too sweet. i also did 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract which was nice.  this pie has potential and looks beautiful before and after baking- i hope i find a way to make this un-runny!

Awesome! I used 5 or 6 pears just because I was trying to use them up.  Now I wish I had made 2 pies instead of one.  Will definitely make again.

This pie turned out amazing. I also changed the 1 teaspoon of almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon almond and half vanilla extract. Will definitely make this many times.

I wasn't a huge fan of this pie.  The almond extract flavour was too overpowering and I couldn't taste the pear flavour at all.  If I were to make this pie again I would cut the almond extract way down and add more pears.

Great way to use up almost-gone pears.  I did use more than the recipe called for-- 5 instead of 3-- simply because that is what I had laying around and they were smallish.  It worked beautifully.  Used vanilla instead of almond, and it still came out superb.  I was nervous about a custard filling being fiddly, but it was a breeze-- great recipe!

This was awesome!!  Brought it into work, a co-worker said this was probably the best thing I'd ever brought in.  My only tip would be, definitely use a homemade crust, not one of those store bought frozen ones.

We made it per the instructions and the center wasn't set. We left it in longer to firm up the center. The center never firmed up. Eventually we had to give up as the crust was turning too dark.

This pear pie tasted fine, but it is kind of boring.  I think a non custard recipe, something more like an apple pie, would be better.

This is a delicious pie!  I never thought of combining pears with a custard pie, but it is perfect.  I think it's a great dessert for holidays.
