This is delicious.  I used chicken legs.  I brushed each with a small amount of oil and then rolled in the spices.  So easy and what a kick!

I cooked this for a sunday dinner because it was easy and you just pop it in the oven while your dressing for church.  My family really liked it and my husband don't care too much for baked chicken.  The only thing I feel it needs different is too cut back on the paprika.  It's a little too strong.  overall it was very good.  I fixed new potatoes with mine in the same pan.

Delish! My youngest, pickiest eater said "this is how you make chicken, mom". It was easy, juicy, economical & delish. My husband can't have sugar or salt, so I just used a very small sprinkle of brown sugar & replaced the salt with garlic & onion powder. I also turned the chicken to coat on both sides. Great recipe, thanks Denise!!

This was tasty and different.  Next time I will half the amounts because it made a lot of spice mixture.  Sweet and savory and made a very moist chicken.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! This is a keeper - everyone in the family loved it.  My key changes:   1. Increased brown sugar to 3 1/2 tsp  2. Reduced salt to 1 1/2 tsp (will try a bit less next time as well)  3. Made GRAVY from the juices.   I sprinkled 40% of the rub on the bottom of 12 chicken thighs, the rest on the rest on the skin side. After baking I removed the fat from the juices, and made a quick gray (just added some flour to thicken).   We ate it with green beans and rice.  The gravy was heavenly, and made the dish perfect.

This was just okay for me.  The paprika was too strong, and it was a little oversweetened I think.  Next time, I'm going to cut the sugar in half and add some other spices - rosemary, basil, and a dash of Oregano for sure.

Amazing mix of flavors.  I cut the salt in half and doubled the brown sugar.  Perfect!  So many flavors.  It makes my mouth water thinking about it :)

This is an easy and delicious way to cook bone in chicken. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. It turned out so moist and flavorful! My family loved it.

I just made this for dinner!  I used boneless skinless breasts and cooked them about 30 minutes.  My husband and I absolutely loved it!  So did our 8 month old son.  Whoever thinks this isn't spicy must have a high spice tolerance.  (I didn't give the spiced side to my son either. ) Only thing I changed was sprinkled on garlic salt on top, but very little.  Thank you!  This was AMAZING!

"Mildly spiced" is right.  Mild to the point of forgettable.  It tasted like plain chicken.  Not unseasoned necessarily, but no defined taste either.  Yes, I did reduce the paprika.  I mixed spices as listed all I could smell is paprika.  I'll be using leftovers for something else.  Sorry I heated up the house for this one.

Very good recipe made easily with ingredients on hand. I had more chicken than called for so increased the recipe with no problem. A big hit with the whole family that I'll make again!

I absolutely loved it!! I used it on tilapia as well! The only thing that I did different was marinating the meat before hand. We love flavor throughout the chicken/fish. Will definitely use over and over again. Thanks

I made this exactly as stated. Can't say it was bad as everyone at the table ate it, but it certainly didn't receive any rave reviews. It was very quick and simple to make with ingredients I always have on hand. Probably wouldn't make it again.

My husband liked this, but I didn't really care for it. I wasn't fond of the flavors. The strong paprika flavor was a little much and overpowered everything else. It did come out very moist.

We all liked this a lot. I did leave the salt out and used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular, but other than that kept the spices the same. Served this with steamed rice and veggies; made an easy, healthy meal.

Very good! My boyfriend usually hates baked chicken but loved this recipe! I used a 1/2 tablespoon of paprika instead.  It was just the right amount of spice! I am definitely adding this recipe to my favorites.

I rate this 4.5 but it wont let me give 1/2 star. I love that both my husband and my son ate all their chicken and they are both very picky! and it was super moist!  I dislike that it took longer to cook even in my gas oven which is abnormal and the flaver stopped pretty much st the skin. It wasn't "spiced" or spicy at all but was definatly sweet so we enjoyed it. it goes into our rotation we will make it again!

I would give 4.5 stars, definitely not spicy, but the flavour of the chicken is nice and it turned out exactly like the picture.  Served with homemade macaroni and cheese.

This recipe was great! I always add my own seasoning to most recipes because "as is" is usually too bland for my taste.  I seasoned my chicken with my usual seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic salt after brushing with oil.  Then, i followed the recipe exactly (only reducing the paprika to 1/2 tbsp as suggested by others).  Added a little chicken broth to bottom of pan and covered with foil....awesome!

I was not a fan of this at all.  The brown sugar made the spice taste weird and it just had way too much spice in general for me.  We won't be making this again.

AMAZING! Came out perfect. Didn't change a thing. I used dark bone in chicken for optimum flavor. Lots of juices for gravy. I doubled this easily since tomorrow was to be busy. If paprika is the main ingrediant buy the best you can find. Pentzy is very easily found, or your local hunky market.  Left the salt alone and not too salty for us. If you want spice use tony chechere's salt. For a roated flavor use lowerys. Although I think this is perfect as is!

I did this one with two boneless, skinless breasts and it was quite good.  A little mild on all counts; will be amping up the sugar and the mustard powder next time.

I love all the spices, but the chicken just turned out very bland.  Perhaps adding some garlic and/or onion powder may help?  Sorry, but I won't try this one again.

My family LOVED it! The only changes I made were that I used all chicken breasts and just drizzed a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil. There was a lot of the rub left so I rolled some new potatoes into it and baked them along side the chicken. This will probably become a weekly staple. Thanks for the super simple and DELICIOUS recipe!

This was really good.  I made a few changes based on reviews.  I wanted it to be spicy so I only used 2 tsp. of smoked paprika and 1 tsp. of chili powder.  Also added some garlic powder just because I use it in everything.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs which cooked really fast.  It was really a nice combination of flavors.

This was excellent!!!! I tried to stay true to the recipe but I had no mustard and I did add a tad bit more brown sugar and honestly I'm not sure if I have mild paprika but I loved it and so did everyone else!!! Thank you for a simple easy and delicious recipe I'll make this again!!!

This recipe is tasty although different from any spice mixture I have ever used.  I cut back on the paprika and increased the brown sugar.  This provided a subtle sweetness but next time I will prepare as the recipe suggests.

After reading a few of the comments, I did not use as much paprika and I used chicken breast but I was terribly disappointed. 

This recipe was not mildly spiced or slightly sweet. Instead there was barely any flavor. This recipe had to be the most bland chicken I have ever tasted. Ended up using bar-b-que sauce on leftovers to add some kind of flavor.

I loved this chicken.  Thought the flavor of the rub was yummy.  I probably ended up with a bit more brown sugar...but followed the recipe almost exact.  My husband insists that it goes into the dinner rotation.  It's a baked chicken with a rub...but the rub is yummy.  Don't expect a "casserole" or different style chicken...but it was delicious!

It was okay.  I added a little garlic but I still thought the paprika, too, was a little overpowering.

I used olive oil and only 2 tsp. of paprika.  Turned out moist and tasty!  I recommend a meat thermometer to keep from overcooking.  Served with a mixture of different brown rices.  Will for sure make this again!

This was very good!  Easy too.  It's always nice to have another baked chicken recipe to add to my recipe file!  I didn't cut up a whole chicken, but used 2 of each boneless frozen breasts and leg quarters instead (I divided the leg quarters into thighs and drum sticks and removed the skin)  Served with strawberry spinach salad and a baked potato and dinner was very tasty and simple tonight!  Thanks, Denise for the recipe!

I made this last night and it was great! I also used chicken breasts and evoo like another reader did. I sauteed some mushrooms and onions in white wine and served it on top of the chicken with some shredded mozzarella and green onions. Good recipe for when I dont want to grill! Will make again!

Excellent meal.  I mixed the spices together, brushed my chicken thighs with oil and rolled them in the spices.  Even though I removed the skin, the meat was moist and very tasty.  I served them with scalloped potatoes and Italian mixed veggies.  Will definitley make again.

A good basic chicken. Paprika isn't a spicy flavor for me so I added some chili powder. I also cut way back on the sugar and didn't miss it.

Easy an great tasting.  I did not think they tasted like "Shake 'n' Bake" at all.  I prepared them just as the recipe indicated however, I used chicken drumsticks only as that it what we like.  They were awesome.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Mmmmm, so good!  Made using hot paprika but that was the only "change".  Grilled up nicely and stayed juicy.  Served on my beer rolls with homemade Russian dressing, lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon.  Thanks for the recipe Denise, we will be making this often. :)

The flavor of the seasonings was good it didn't penetrate the chicken very well, and the chicken seemed kinda dried out.

This was a great recipe!  I took some advise from the other reviews.  Instead of salt, I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and onion powder.  I also cooked a 5lb chicken instead of 3 1/2lb, and I cooked it whole in the slow cooker with potatoes.  It was very tasty and tender!  The potatoes turned out great too! Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.

Very good! Made it with thigh meat and drumstick. I inserted some butter under the skin of each piece and turned them every 10 minutes for 40 minutes on a broiler pan. Very moist and flavorful!

This chicken was delicious! I also made with chicken legs (that is what I had). Very juicy and flavorful. I like spice so the paprika didn't bother me, I might actually add some cayenne pepper the next time I make it. This is my new favorite was to make chicken!

This is an easy and excellent recipe. It has become a favorite in our house--a regular in our dinner "rotation." It's easy because it uses ingredients I always have on hand, it's quick to assemble, and my daughter who likes to help in the kitchen can help by "painting" the oil on the chicken and sprinkling the spices on top. The only change I've made is to reduce the amount of paprika because we thought it was a little too spicy. Otherwise, a real winner!  Thanks!

Got a new convection/air fryer/toaster oven and decided to use it for this recipe. Had two thick boneless skinless chicken breasts so I sliced them in half to have 4 thinner cutlets, sprayed with olive oil on both sides and rubbed with combined spices (doubled brown sugar and only used 1/2 of the salt) on both sides. Placed on foil sprayed with olive oil, in oven and cooked on air bake (convection) for 10 minutes. Perfect! They came out juicy and delicious. Yes, they're a little on the spicy side, but I think the extra brown sugar helped make them less so. Served with southwestern rice w/vegetables from bird's eye that I microwaved. Total prep and cooking time, 15 minutes!!! Gotta love that! Thanks for the recipe!

After reading very mixed reviews, I decided to do this recipe exactly as it is written and judge for myself.  Being a LA and TX influenced person, I like seasoned food and a bit of spice is nice.  I baked some chicken legs without skin and broiled some with skin on - just because I had so much chicken I filled two pans, anyway, so thought I'd try it both ways.  The skin on chicken (as the recipe was intended, I think) was very good.  I don't think it would've been as good baked (like recipe says), though, as part of what helped was that some of the spice sizzled right off the skin under the hot broiler.  This made it just the right amount of spice when done and it was tasty, although not necessarily anything to write home about.  The baked, skinless legs were WAY too potent with paprika -- as in, almost gag because it was too strong.  So, I had mixed results with this recipe.  Probably not one I will go out of my way to make again -- just not great to me.

Baked Spice Chicken Haiku: "I used chicken breast. Needs more than just a 'sprinkle', flavor's too subtle." I made the entire recipe, and rubbed it all on two chicken breasts but still found that they tasted a little on the bland side. Served over a salad, sure, it's a nice piece o' poultry, but as a stand-alone entree, it just didn't Wow us.

This was good. I added ten minutes to get the chicken to temperature, cooked it in cast iron, and added a little catsup to make it more bbq-y, which necessitated that i rub it on as a paste. My family would prefer it on boneless meat.

This was good. I doubled the spices but didn't need that much so I'll save it for next time. I made half of the chicken like the recipe only I halved the paprika, the other half I added red curry powder to. Both versions were good but we all preferred the curry version a little more. I think making a white sauce with a little of the seasoning mix in it would be delicious and served over rice or noodles.

when you need a simple recipe for the chicken in your fridge, this is the one to use.  Next time I might reduce the black pepper by just a smidgen, but it is so flavorful!

Thank you so much for this simple yet delicious quick recipe!!  My two picky kids and husband all enjoyed the chicken.  I used chicken legs and sprayed them with canola cooking oil and coated each drumstick one-by-one.  So yummy!

Really delicious, super easy, and different! I made this recipe exactly as written and resisted temptation to change anything. The only thing I did was put some cubed up some potatoes in the baking dish but focused the seasoning on the chicken as per the recipe (I didn't roll it in the seasoning as some reviewers did).

My chicken only took 40 minutes (thighs and legs), and it was a hit with the whole family. Depending on your tastes, you might back off the brown sugar or paprika but the crust on the chicken skin was terrific and it was moist and tender. Took literally 5 minutes to prep. A keeper!

I'm hosting a dinner party in a few weeks and I tried this recipe and I definitely think it will make the cut.. it was delicious! Pair it with some white wine and it makes for a nice dinner. Not to mention it was very easy to follow the recipe.

This was delicious! A little spicier than I thought it would be, but in a good way! And the brown sugar was a perfect touch. The boyfriend approved and I will definitely cook it again.

I used two packages (a total of twelve) boneless skinless chicken thighs with as much fat removed as possible.  For that amount of chicken I multiplied all the other ingredients by 1 1/2 except the salt which I actually reduced to 1 teaspoon and the oil and pepper which I left as is.  I combined all the spice ingredients except the parsely and put them into a wire strainer which I could shake all over the chicken to coat it very evenly.  Then I sprinkled the parsley on top. Cooks in 20 minutes. VERY sucessful!
