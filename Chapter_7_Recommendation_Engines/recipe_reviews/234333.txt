What's not to love about this?  My watermelon isn't very sweet, so it really needs just a touch of sugar.  This is a nice summer drink.  Thanks, Genevieve!

Very Good!  I muddled some mint leaves in with the watermelon for an added flavor dimension.  It was fresh and tasty!

This is a good simple recipe. I was in the supermarket today and they had Tropicana Watermelon juice on sale so I used that with a home made simple syrup (to taste). That addition would make it 5 stars.

We thought the vodka overpowered the watermelon so you really couldnâ€™t taste it.   Maybe if the watermelon had been sweeter, it would have been better.
