Made it for New Years Eve. I used roasted red peppers just because I had them. It was delicious and got lots of raves.

Tastes very good, but it is a little too runny.  Trying to figure out what to do to firm it up a bit.

I made this recipe for the first time last night for a housewarming party.  It was a hit!  Everyone loved it, including myself.  Definitely a keeper!

Dip was very bland and I give it 2 stars as is. I added a little Tabasco sauce to give it a small kick, onion salt and celery seed. Even with the changes it only brought it up to an average 3 star recipe. Sorry, I won't be making this again, but I enjoyed trying a new recipe.

This is a good recipe.  We added 12oz of the crab, but other than that it was great!  Very easy
