BEST DESSERT EVER!! Huge family hit! A new favorite for the holidays!!!
Here's a tip: We only had 1 package of cream cheese, so we used 1/2 a can of Reddi Whip instead and it was awesome!! Made it very creamy but not too thick!!

I was so glad to find this recipe; it was perfect for our 4th of July picnic!  I got some really great local fresh grown strawberries, blue berries, and I also used some fresh raspberries at a local farmers stand along one of our back roads in Lancaster, PA.  I liked that this was a completely made from scratch recipe, instead of using ‘boxed’ sugar cookies.  My only change was that I used 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of ½ cup shortening and ½ cup butter.   It turned out perfect, and it looks so impressive, but was really quite easy!

This was a huge hit after our church's patriotic music program!  I added the grated peel of one lemon to the cookie dough, and used 1 C. butter in place of the shortening and margarine, as another reviewer suggested.  I didn't arrange the blueberries in rows, just outlined the rectangle and filled it in however they fell.  Beautiful to look at and scrumptious to eat!  I plan on making it again for another 4th of July event.

This is so good!  My only regret is not putting more fruit on the top!  The sugar cookie crust is the best part, though!  I didn't use margarine or shortening, but all real butter instead of the two of those and it turned out wonderfully.  It is more than halfway gone not even a day later with our family of five.

My 5 yr old and 3 yr old loved helping me make this patriotic fruit pizza.  It turned out great, LOVE that the cookie is from scratch, not a boxed mix!

This was a big hit with my family and coworkers. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used all butter. I also reduced the sugar In the cream cheese topping to 3/4C and drizzled apricot preserves over the top.

The crust on this fruit pizza is MUCH better than the traditional way of using pre-made sugar cookie crust. Our family of 5 had it gone in 2 days! I definitely recommend this recipe. Absolutely delicious and great for the 4th of July! We made it exactly as written.

This pizza was big hit @ the family picnic!  I must admit, I was in a hurry so cheated & used store purchased frig cookie dough or the crust but, after reading thru the reviews, I'll definitely try the "scratch' version next time.  I also believe that the cream cheese could be cut in half as it seems to over-power the wonderful flavors of the fruit.  
Experimentation!  That's how we learn & discover!!  
Enjoy your version!  ~

Everyone in my family, as well as my neighbor, loved it! I might try raspberries instead of strawberries next time.

This was very tasty. I did make a graham cracker crust instead of the sugar cookie crust. Very tasty and will make it again

made recipe a little simpler instead of making sugar cookie from scratch bought a sugar cookie roll it worked wonderfully I would also prick cookie with fork several places so it comes out nice and fluffy. I also coated blueberries in powder sugar dust to represent the stars my family loved the surprise dessert perfect for 4th of July!

MY family LOVED this cookie cake. My son birthday is on the 4th of July, and my kids love cookie cakes. What a prefect match and they loved the cookie cake so much that I made it again for the weekend party with relatives. And they loved it, I added some mini chocolate chips to the mix and that was a delicious addition. It's a keeper, it's also super easy to make. Thanks

This got RAVE REVIEWS with my family at our Independence Day dinner last night. The ONLY thing that I would change for the future is adding only 3/4 cup sugar to the cream cheese spread, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I'd give 4.5 stars if possible.

I have made this twice in the past week and it was a big hit both times. The second time, I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 12' round pizza pan. I didn't use bananas, just  strawberries and blueberries in a random pattern.

I did not care for this recipe.  I have made many fruit pizzas recipes over the years and I thought I would give this one a shot. everything was ok and perfect except I did not care for the vegetable shortening!!
