Excellent flavor - tastes the way mulled cider should.  We like our cider spicy so I used one sachet for a 1/2 gallon of cider and simmered longer - about an hour.  We made up a bunch of sachets and gave them as gifts - definitely include instructions so friends friends don't make the same mistake as a previous reviewer by removing the spices from the sachet.

This was very, very good.  I suggest keeping the mulling spices bound in the cheese cloth, or you'll be straining them out of your punch.  This happened to me :)

I gave these out to all of my future in-laws for christmas with wine and cider (depending on taste) and a little gift basket, they all loved it, even the four year old boy Sean loved his "spicy juice" :)
