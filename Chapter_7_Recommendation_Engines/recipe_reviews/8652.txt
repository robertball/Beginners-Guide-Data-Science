I've made this 8 times now. The first 7 times, I skipped the Parmesan, thinking it would not make that much of a difference. Boy, was I wrong! Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don't skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.

Applauds to Carol.The BEST chicken breast ever. I am not a enthusiastic chicken lover and I find it difficult to find a good moist chicken breast recipe with flavor. The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect. This is not fried/baked chicken. This is a Exquisite dish and the aroma is Heavenly. IF there are left over,place on a salad for a nice lunch.  Encore

We've made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil.  Just as tasty and a LOT less fat.  No real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan, seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you'd like.  To me, this was just much too greasy.

All I can say about this chicken is OH-MY-GAWD! It is so delicious and so easy! Don't make any changes to this recipe, it's perfect as it is.  I followed the alfredo sauce recipe on this site and made fettucine alfredo to go with this chicken.  My husband took one bite of the chicken and said "why do we ever eat out!?" You must try this recipe! It's a keeper! The absolute best thing is how easy it is to make such a tasty dish!

This recipe was super easy.  The chicken has a very nice garlic smell while cooking.  The taste is mild and not over powering.  If you are looking for a strong garlic taste this is not it.  However, since I was cooking for a one year old and a picky husband the taste was perfect.  
The recipe is super fast, taking only a few minutes to warm the oil and roll the chicken in the coating.  
The only thing I did wrong was using chicken breast tenders rather than chicken breasts.  I don't recommend this.  You have to decrease the cooking time to prevent the chicken from drying out and the coating does not get crispy.  The chicken was just starting to get crispy when I had to remove it from the oven.  I think it would have been even better if I had been able to cook it at least another 15 minutes.  
I will make it again using whole chicken breasts in the future.

Pretty yummy! Very easy. The chicken was tender and had a nice flavor. I asked my husband if it was a keeper and he said "Oh yeah!" The only thing is I bought the real parmesan cheese still in shredded form and couldn't figure how the cheese and bread crumbs were going to stick to the chicken! My husband said,"I think you're supposed to use the powdered stuff in the green can." Oopps. That makes sense. Make sure you start off with the stuff in the green can. You know that stuff you put on spaghetti!

WOW! Delicious with little effort!  I changed this: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are RELIABLY more moist then breasts (always trim off any extra fat with kitchen sheers). I ran the garlic and olive oil through my mini-blender so it was like a smooth garlic emulsion oil (I did warm the oil in the microwave as suggested).  I tossed 1/2 the chicken into a ziplock, poured in the garlic oil....tossed in the other half of the chicken and closed the bag.  I hand squished the garlic oil all throughout the chicken by kneading the bag. That saves the messy step of hand dipping each piece into the oil and then into the crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs with the grated cheese and coated the pieces as suggested.  It was excellent!!.  It really was very easy, tasty and light!! Baked 400Â° for 23 minutes.

For those who prefer a stronger garlic flavour instead of olive oil substitute garlic oil or make your own by adding 2 Tbs chopped garlic to 1 cup olive or canola oil,let stand for 24 hrs in fridge and use within a week.  Add GRANULATED garlic powder to the crumb mixture, use Romano cheese instead of Parmesan for a more distinct flavour.

pounded the chicken breasts so they would be more tender, also added lots more garlic, used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and needed almost two times the amount of crumbs anc cheese asked for. overall, very delicious.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I had been making something similar but cooking the chicken in a covered skillet.  The oven-method is much cleaner!  I used Italian bread crumbs and sprinkled fresh parmesan on the top of the breasts.  In the future I'll add the parmesan at the end as the cheese got a little crunchy.

I first made this recipe several months ago when I was scrambling last minute to find something to make for dinner.  I always have garlic, bread crumbs, olive oil, and parmesan cheese on hand, so this recipe was perfect, and was absolutely delicious!   After perusing all the reviews, I followed some tips and upped the crumbs & cheese.  Since we loooove garlic, I used more of that too (3 large cloves worth).   I also used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and like others have mentioned, the cooking time was more like 25-30 minutes, not 30-35.... I've since made it several more times, and now I regularly use even more garlic (about 4 cloves), 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup bread crumbs (half Panko crumbs and half Italian), and 1/2 cup parmesan.   I made it at a dinner party for 12 and it was a huge hit.   It's so moist and flavorful, even my hard-to-please father-in-law who doesn't usually like chicken breasts (he prefers dark meat chicken) raved about it!

Taking advice of others, b/c we love garlic, I used 5 cloves of garlic and the seasoned bread crumbs. I also added 1/4 stick of butter to baking dish. When chicken was cooked, I poured juices into small saute pan and added 1 TBL of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water. Then added some Half and Half and heated, stirring until thickened. Once thickened, I added some parmesan cheese. This made a wonderful creamy sauce to pour over chicken. I served with garlic mashed potatoes. YUM!!!

Definitely add the parmesan cheese during the last five minutes of cooking. I also added salt, pepper, parsley, and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. Pretty good overall.

*Note....I made this recipe again, and I used the parmesan in the can instead of fresh (which should have been specified)....it was much better with the cheese in the can mixed with the breadcrumb coating and the fresh parmesan added the last five minutes of baking...This was wonderful this way! I also added extra garlic the second time around.

Wow, this was so good!!  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs with a little black pepper added in.  I only made 2 chicken pieces (not 4) but i did not cut the recipe in half.  There still seemed to be just the right amount of oil/garlic and crumbs.  I also used 5 large garlic cloves, so I used way more garlic than was called for.  Any remaining oil/garlic was drizzled over chicken right before baking.  I would definitely recommend 5 cloves per 2 chicken breasts, it turned out very flavorful but not overpowering.  Absolutely wonderful chicken!

This recipe is so simple yet full of flavor and delicious.  I didn't know chicken breasts could be so moist.  I let the chicken marinate in the olive oil and garlic a couple hours before baking.  The only added salt, pepper and pepper flakes.  My husband was happily surprised and said it was the best chicken he had ever tasted.  Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe is for a good home-made shake and bake type chicken.  Don't skimp on the olive oil/garlic/bread crumbs/parmesan cheese.  I also seasoned the chicken before dipping with garlic & onion powders & black pepper.  My picky husband & toddler both enjoy this recipe as well.

Fantastic! One of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried. Great flavor and the chicken was juicy and tasted amazing! I whipped up some garlic/parmesan/cheesy mashed potatoes and steamed broccolli to go with it. With the help of a glass of sweet red wine, it was as good or better than many restaurant meals I've had!!

This recipe was AMAZING as is! The easiest chicken I have ever made, super moist, lots of flavor and done in half an hour! The only change I made was to use butter instead of olive oil, as another user suggested, and it really brought out the wonderful garlic flavor. I didn't use any measurements for this recipe...I took all of the ingredients and kind of threw them in at my own discretion...worked out perfectly!

The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and didn't find it to be anything special. The second time, I added some fresh rosemary to the garlic mixture, some ground pepper and about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs, pounded the chicken breasts a little thinner and turned the breasts once halfway through baking. When I did that, it was perfect. 25 minutes baking time was plenty, if I'd kept it in any longer it would have overbrowned. This dish is also very versatile. I have served this with cheese sauce, spaghetti sauce, rice, stuffing, mashed potatoes, pasta--just about anything goes well with it. This is also one of the easiest recipes I have ever made, and I always have the ingredients on hand. I don't think I will ever make breaded chicken any other way again. Thanks, Carol, for this super-easy recipe!

I've always made this with butter, but can't wait to try it with garlic-infused oil. However, I think 425 is way too hot. I've always baked the chicken for 35-45 minutes at 350 and it comes out evenly cooked and juicy.

I've also used herb-seasoned stuffing mix instead of the breadcrumbs. You just have to crush it in a food processor first.

We call this oven fried chicken and just love it. This is a great dish to play around with. Try Panko bread crumbs, or crushed corn flakes for something different. (Use your imagination here, some folks even use crushed pretzels and love it!) You can also sub mayo or melted butter for the olive oil, but you'll get more health benefits from olive oil. You can also vary the herbs in your breading. this is just a fun, delicious, juicy and tender dish, no matter how you go!

YUM!!!!  Soooooooooo good!  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had to make a couple modifications.  The recipe as written is 4 stars, but it is 5 stars if you do this:  double the garlic (at least!).  You can't even taste the garlic unless you use at least 2x the amount.  Also, if you pound the breasts thin and then broil them instead of bake them, they will be crispy and golden on both sides, and moist and juicy inside.  This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for breaded chicken.

This was VERY good!! For the bread crumbs I just had stuffing mix on hand so I put that in the food processor to crush and used it to coat the chicken. I also was short on time so I cut the chicken into strips so they would cook faster. They were in the oven for 20 minutes and turned out great! It was really good! My husband loved it and so did my in-laws. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for this easy yet delicious recipe!

This was very good.  I did add more garlic (we love the stuff).  Didn't have the problem of the chicken drying out and it was a very easy dish to prepare.  Thank you.

I used panko crumbs which gave a much more crunchy finish.  In addition, instead of all olive oil, I used half olive oil and half butter, which gave a richer flavor.  You could also use this recipe as a base for chicken parmesan, and just add tomato/pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese on top of each chicken breast

I have used this recipe many times.  I added crushed red pepper to the oil also.  After the oil cools i place chicken into oil and let sit for 1/2 hour or so.  I use panko crubs in with my parm bread crumbs.  I also season the breast meat with salt and pepper first.  And i always use more garlic than called for.  I like to use this recipe for chicken sandwiches.

Very good!  I upped the cheese and breadcrumbs to 1/3 cups each.  I also used 4 crushed garlic cloves and added some pepper & onion powder.  It was a little on the dry side.  I do plan on making this again.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have been making for years with just a few changes - try it, you'll love it!!  Instead of the oil use one cube butter or margarine, soften the garlic in the butter to infuse the flavor, remove the crushed garlic clove.  Then combine 5 tsp dijon mustard with the butter, coat the chicken, roll in breadcrumb/parmesan mixture and continue as directed!!

I could give a "5" but the fact that I needed to add some seasoning, brings it down to a "4". The basic recipe works well, (made it first the way the recipe was written) second time I added 1 tsp. celery salt,
1/2 tsp. red pepper and  course ground pepper. 
The result was finger licking good, it was so juicy! Thanks for the recipe!

After reading all of the reviews of this recipe I couldn't wait to try it! I made it last night and WOW!! It was really very very easy to make and the chicken was so moist! The only thing I would do differently is to turn the chicken over once during baking in case you wanted the bottom to be browner. Otherwise, if you just put it on the plate, no one notices! It was very tasty with the potato cassarole from this site (with the hash browned potatoes, cream of chicken soup, sour cream and cheese) and a green salad!

Prepared EXACTLY as written.  Very quick, very easy, very bland.  It needs something, but my goal is to prepare allrecipe's recipes exactly as written and give my opinion on the original recipe, not to tweak it into a different recipe all together.  Next.

I make a similar dish. For those who had trouble with the cheese adhering, try using panko and fresh grated parmesan, from a chunk of aged parmesan. The pre shredded cheese does not have the correct texture. Forget the green can stuff. That is not even cheese!
You can also dip the chicken in beaten egg before breading instead of coating it with oil. The egg helps the crumbs stick. Then drizzle the oil/garlic mixture over it before baking. Panko makes a very light crispy crust that is delightful when combined with parmesan cheese. It is my go to breading choice, no matter what I am cooking.

Family loved this recipe!  Had a couple over for dinner and wife said she wouldn't normally have chosen a garlic chicken, but that she was pleasantly surprised at how good this was!  Used jar minced garlic with olive oil, refrig powder parm and Italian breadcrumbs.  Will definitely use this recipe again!!!!

We served this at our wedding 17 years ago and have been making it ever since!!  The only differences are we use melted butter simmered with crushed garlic and we use shredded parmesan. ALWAYS get rave reviews!!

Followed instructions exactly and it turned out PERFECT!! It was so delicious, but it could use just a bit of salt. I suggest using Panko (sp?) bread crumbs since they're bigger and don't get soggy at all.

2011-01-24  I marinated the chicken breasts in Kraft Light House Italian dressing overnight for more flavor.  Even though the chicken was coated and baked right after removing from the refrigerator, it cooked very quickly and was somewhat dry after only 30 minutes.  The flavor was good - my daughter said they tasted like chicken nuggets.)

This was awesome! First time ever that baked, breded chicken has come out crispy! I took regular breasts and sliced them in half horizontally, to make 2 thin breasts out of each. Came out juice, crispy, and flavorful! This will be a regular staple in our house, can't wait to play around with the seasonings!

I wanted a simple, no-frills recipe with loads of taste - and this was just right! I used five cloves of garlic, and added in some garlic powder, onion salt, and pepper into the bread crumb mixture because it's extremely easy to customize this one. I recommend sprinkling on some extra parmesan cheese about five minutes before you remove it from the oven for some extra flavor and crunch. It leaves all sorts of wonderful crunchy bits on the bottom of the pan that you'll want to scrape and pile onto the chicken. The chicken stayed very moist and flavorful, and I imagine it would serve very well for leftovers. If you want a basic garlic chicken recipe, this one is excellent!

simple and quick. i doubled the garlic, added salt and pepper to the bread crumbs and turned the oven to 450 and cooked for 30 minutes. came out with some crisp to the coating. also poured the remaining olive oil and garlic mixture into my casserole with the chicken, and added enough olive oil to come up on the chicken about 1/4 inch. the resulting garlic oil was tasty for dipping french bread in.

We loved it!  You have to try it.  It couldn't be easier or faster to put together.  I used about 6 large cloves of garlic and increased the Olive Oil to 1/3 cup.  Heated in the microwave for about 1-1 1/2 minutes.  I doubled the amount of bread crumbs and Parmesan due to using 6 chicken breasts.  The only thing I will be doing different next time is to add salt and maybe more seasoning if m using plain bread crumbs again but at some point I'll try Italian bread crumbs.  The house smelled amazing.  Great with Pasta or a mix Rice/Orzo.

This was delicious!  My whole family gobbled it up and wanted more.  The directions weren't clear on making the garlic infused oil so I looked somewhere else and found a recipe to bring the oil to medium heat and add garlic for 3 - 5 minutes.  Take the oil off the heat and let it sit until cool. Then cover for an hour to infuse before using. WE will make this recipe over and over again.

Excellent! Husband loved it; made it twice in a week and a half!   Second time was better than the first. 1) instead of warm the oil/garlic in the pan, I put the oil, minced garlic, and a tiny bit of garlic powder in a ziplock bag and let it sit for about 10 minutes with the chicken breasts in it. ("massage" around to make sure its evenly spread)  2) Used the directed amount of (italian) bread crumbs and parmesan cheese (fresh grated 1/4 cup from a large block)...but in addition added some more garlic powder (eye balled) to the mix. Put in large baggie and shook well.  3) Placed the chicken breasts into the dry mix bag, shake and rub to make sure all is covered. Place in pan, pour rest of mix evenly on top of chicken  Came out FANTASTIC! The extra garlic powder and fresh parmesan REALLY brought out the flavor! I'll definitely keep this recipe around and make it again soon.

This was amazing! I left my chicken to soak overnight in the oil/garlic mixture..... i'll have to try it again just dipped to see if it made a difference but darn this was good. Hah, i'll even try breadcrumbs next time (I was out of those so I crushed up some pita puff chips- and hoped for the best). Other reviewers were right about the parmesan, tastes great- don't skip it!  I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This was delicious and looked great, too! The only change I made was adding some Cheddar cheese on top of the chicken for the last 10 minutes of baking. TO THE PERSON WHO DIDN'T WARM THE OIL AND GARLIC TOGETHER...YES, OF COURSE IT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE FLAVOR! You MUST warm the garlic in the oil, that's how the garlic infuses its flavor into the oil.

This dish was wonderful.  Anytime you can bake chicken breasts in the oven and have them come out moist - it's a winner!  Super crunchy and flavorful.  I will for sure make this again, using this basic recipe for many dishes ie. chicken parmesan etc.

I'm 15, and I live with my dad and my brother. My dad works nights and his break is at 6, so I usually make dinner for everyone. I've never made chicken before, so when I looked up recipes and thought I would give this one a try. It was SO easy. My dad and brother loved it and said it was better than anything my italian mother had ever made. I don't even like chicken, but I love this and will definitely make it again.

Delicious and easy.  Be careful not to overcook.  The chicken can be done as early as 20 minutes depending on the size.

This was good and easy to prepare, and my very picky husband said he would eat it again.  However, next time I'll definitely add more garlic (probably doubled), and maybe some herbs as well.  For us, the basic recipe was bland, but a great start!  Will be added to regular rotation.

considering the simplicity of it, 5 stars!  Only thing I did differently is I added a dash of crushed red pepper in the olive oil.  Easy and yummy!

4 stars as is 5 with modifications.  I followed this recipe to a tee the first time and thought the results were pretty good, but not exceptional.  My hubby and I like our food with more complex flavors so I added the following to the breadcrumbs: (approx) 1/2 C honey crunch wheat germ, 1 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika).  Wheat germ adds folic acid, vitamin E, and fiber without affecting the taste.  After dipping the chicken in the garlic oil, I coated it with the crumbs, dipped in egg, and coated it with some more crumbs.  Before putting it in the oven, I drizzed virgin coconut oil on top (butter or olive oil would work too). The hubby liked this dish before I made these changes, but after the changes, he was very enthusiastic about dinner and leftovers and declared that this needed to go in the regular rotation.

I used chicken tenders and added more garlic. I soaked the chicken in the oil in for a  while and added some dried basil to the crumbs and cheese.  I tried a tip I saw on here about refrigerating the breaded chicken for about 15 minutes before cooking  It really does help the breading stay on. I almost forgot to say that I oooked this for the first time for some dinner guests and we all loved it!! Delicious and moist. Linda

This recipe is good and easy.  Marinating the chicken for about 35 minutes really helped the garlic flavor come out better and moistened the chicken.  Highly recommend.  Hubbie even liked it!

Very nice flavor but a bit too greasy with all the oil. Next time I will try dipping it in an egg wash with the garlic instead.

I let the chicken marinate in the olive oil and garlic a couple of hours before coating and cooking it. I used minced garlic because I did not have any other. I used some garlic salt on the breasts before coating them.
I also added some seasoned salt to the coating mixture just to spice it up a little. My husband said "this is one of the better ones. It really appealed to my taste." I think I will try Italian bread crumbs next time. The chicken was very moist and tender enough to cut with a fork. I turned the oven to broil for the last 5 minutes just to make them crispier. I will definitely make this again and again.

You wouldnt believe how one little accident can change how you cook . Company was on thier way. dinner was almost ready. getting ready to bread the chicken. when I dropped a whole can of bread crumbs on the floor. Not having any bread in the house(only the rolls for dinner) I popped three or four English muffine in the blender and then mixed it with the cheese,and proceeded to bread the chicken as called for in the recipe.
 What a wonderful discovery. I will never go back to regular dry bread crumbs again.

This was tasty and very easy. I do think it needed some more seasoning.. perhaps some crushed red pepper or some italian seasoning mixed in with the crumbs. I marinated this overnite in the garlic and oil and then left out the oil when baking

This is such an easy recipe.  I cooked this when we had company and everyone loved it.  I usually add a little salt, red pepper, and black pepper to the bread crumbs and cheese just to give it a little more flavor.  This is a great weeknight meal because it's fast and I usually have the ingredients on hand.

This is my first review ever but this is the first time I was compelled to leave my thoughts. This recipe was easy and just fantastic with flavor! I am not a big fan of garlic but the flavor with the crispy coating was fantastic! The recipe calls for 2 tsp of garlic, I used 1 tbsp as my family LOVES garlic. Go by tsp not cloves. I used Italian bread crumbs and grated parmesan not shredded parmesan. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Someone recommended after heating oil and garlic to put in plastic bag and add chicken. TERRIFIC IDEA, much less mess. I let the chicken sit for about 30 min in oil/garlic mixture. Then coated and cooked as recipe states. YUMMMMM! I had no left overs. Thank you for a great recipe! Definitely passing on to all my friends!

The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect.

Yummy and easy.  I butterflied my chicken breasts and they were tender yet crispy, and it cut the cooking time down by 10 minutes.  I added in some fresh grated parmesan, about 1/4 cup, since it adds a rich flavor and goes so well with the garlic.  Thanks for the nice recipe I plan to make often.

I took off a star because the recipe needs just a little flair - some salt, pepper, and maybe an herb or two. Parsley at least. 
Then the cooking time was off for me...half hour at 425 would have burnt them. The evoo cooking off the chicken started to burn and smoke after about 15 minutes so I turned the oven down to 325 to finish. They were done even with the decrease in temp at about 20 min.

Absolutely delicious! I made fresh breadcrumbs in my food processor and pulsed in the parmesan. The only change I made was adding some Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper to jazz up the breadcrumbs. I baked two lean breasts at 400 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. The breading was so delicious and perfectly golden. The chicken, despite being very lean, turned out extremely tender and juicy. It didn't taste greasy at all. This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper! Thanks Carol!

Excellent! I made everything as is, but didn't quite have enough parmesean cheese, so I added a little Romano Cheese and added it just above the required amount. It was quite lovely!

Very good recipe! Simple and quick but tasted like it took hours to make. I didn't change a thing, except I used fresh chopped garlic and a lot of it. Served it with tricolor pasta tossed with olive oil and garlic and sauteed broccoli. I think I would like to try this as a base for my chicken parm next. Thanks Carol!

Delicious flavor, moist & tender chicken, crispy golden breading crust!  All of these things together in one simple & quick recipe.  The Hubster loves breaded chicken but it usually is egg & flour dipped, so this is such a wonderful alternative.  I usually don't care for baked boneless skinless chicken breasts, but this was out of this world!  For 2 chicken breasts, I used 1/8 cup of oil but left everything else the same, and it was the perfect amount.  I minced the garlic and warmed the oil in a medium skillet.  Just warm!  Don't sizzle your garlic!  When I dipped the chicken in the garlic oil, I pressed a little to make sure that a lot of garlic pieces stuck to it on both sides before dipping in bread crumb mixture.  It was not very difficult at all!  You don't have to use the Parmesan in the green can:  I used fresh but used a zester to finely grate it & it mixed into the bread crumbs just fine.  I used a little over 1/4 cup.  I always prefer fresh Parmesan to the other stuff, & it's well worth it.  We love this dish.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Alrighty, this is now in our 'Favorites' binder - it is DELICIOUS, oh yeah - and super EASY!! To heat the oil/garlic - I just mixed the oil with the garlic & microwaved it for 20 seconds.

Used lots more garlic ~ 1/2 oil 1/2 butter. Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and it came out perfect =D I would reccomend using thin breast. I used thin breast and only cooked for about 30 min. at 375. Turned out so moist and flavorful. Everyone wanted seconds..some thirds =) Served with Baked Ziti I (without the beef) from this site. Resturant quality meal!!

A HUGE hit with my husband!  He raved about this chicken for days and asked when I would make it again.  I added italian seasoning mix to the bread crumb/parm. cheese mix and added way more garlic to the oil/garlic mix.  Also I baked on a dark, non-stick cookie sheet and this helped to "crisp" the other side of the chicken.  I will definitely make again--thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe and thank you for sharing it.  Many times I have made Chicken Parmesan with this recipe, just by adding my own Italian sauce to the bottome of a baking dish and  placing the completed Garlic Chicken on top of it; add a little more sauce on top of chicken and sprinkle with shredded mozzerella cheese and bake. It delicious!

I wish I could give more stars! This recipe is wonderful and healthy! Other garlic chicken recipes often include lots of butter. I especially liked this recipe because didn't include any. The only change I made was to season the chicken breasts with a bit of salt and pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice before coating them in the garlic oil. I have tried several other Garlic Chicken recipes, but this one is the BEST. Super, super easy and very tasty! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe & it will go in my "family favorite" folder!  I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I used fine cracker crumbs instead - I'm sure that this kept the breading from being "loose", as one person described it.  It was nicely crispy & I will probably always substitute the cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs.

Thank you Carol for this great garlicky treat!
I've made this recipe a dozen or so times now, as written, and my whole family loves it.  Best features are that it's fast, easy, and very versatile.  I've cut the breasts diagonally into strips and served them over a large garden salad with rolls, placed them over parmesan angel hair pasta, and served them over fettuccini alfredo.  Each way is delicious!

Ohh this was tasty.  My son prefers bone in chix, so I used legs for him (which I put in the oven 25 minutes before) and tenders (20 min) for the spawn and myself.  I cheated and used jarred minced garlic which I mixed in with the bread crumb/parm cheese mixture and added salt, pepper, paprika & onion powder to it as well.  The chicken was soooooo tender and juicy.  Thanks for the easy & tasty recipe Carol!

Quick, easy, and delicious, my favorite cooking terms!My own personal preference forced me to add 2t garlic powder, since we like anything garlicky. I pounded the breasts to 1/4 in thick to break down the connective tissue so it would absorb more of the flavors. Perfect! We loved it. Thanks Carol.

This was very easy and good!  I love Garlic so I would add more garlic next time or marinade it all day if I were just making the chicken. However I made up for it by complimenting it with the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site, which was awesome with this and served it over the chicken, and Garlic and Herb flavored Fettucine.  I also served cresent rolls and green beans.  A definate crowd pleaser!

Simple, quick, and good.  Chicken was very tender and moist!   I ended up adding more bread crumbs + parmesan but had plenty of oil.

This is now one of my favorite recipes. I just found it the other night. I used strips of chicken tenders though since I had no chicken breasts. Very garlicy..I used minced garlic - not sure how different that is from crushed garlic- but it works. I served it with rice and it was absolutely delicious. I can't say enough about it, it's extremely easy..very quick to make.. only a few ingredients..not a lot of dishes to clean up after dinner and husband loved it too.

This was absolutely amazing.  My boyfriend and I couldn't believe how good this tasted with such a small amount of effort.  It was crispy on the outside while moist on the inside. The flavor of the garlic was perfect.  The only thing in the recipe I changed was adding some garlic salt to the bread crumb mixture. I'll definitely been doing this again, especially when I don't really feel like cooking.

So easy to make and terrific!  I added a few things to the bread crubs like Italian Seasoning and red pepper to spice it up.  I also cooked it on a broiling pan.  Thnaks so much!!

Very fast, very easy. Use a good quality parmaesan or pamesan/reggiano mix. It is worth it, adding that extra zing some may have missed.

This was quite good!  I made it with butter instead of oil, and I used Italian breadcrumbs.  For recipes like this I always just coat one side of the chicken and bake crumb side up.  That way there's no chance of soggy breadcrumbs on the bottom.  I baked mine at 400 degrees for about 20-22 minutes.  Then I popped them under the broiler just long enough to give them a little more color.  Next time I think Iâd like to try panko instead of the breadcrumbs.  This would also be good with the addition of provolone or mozzarella cheese and spaghetti sauce for chicken parmesan.  UPDATE 4/25/16:  I made this again using panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, and I used oil as directed, instead of the butter I used last time.  Perhaps because I dipped both sides of the chicken in the oil, but only coated one side with the crumbs, the oil splattered in the oven.  Next time I'll use the butter again on one side only, to hopefully prevent the splattering I got this time.

Ok, money is tight because payday is Friday and the holidays are fast approaching.  I needed a recipe that used what I had on hand and came across this one.  After a VERY LONG DAY, arrived home and the beau & I got to work.

YUMMY!  Our fresh garlic went bad so we sauted with a dry garlic - the house SMELLED wonderful!  Can't wait to try this with the good stuff!  We baked it out in a toaster oven (cut one large breast into 4 pieces).  The top started to burn a little so we flipped it halfway.  

It looked as good as it smelled.  We paired it with steamed broccoli and garlic bread.  I'm SO EXCITED I have leftovers for tonight!  Will try it with fresh garlic next time, but I wouldn't change a thing. So flavorful.

Great recipe! I had large thick chicken breasts so I needed more bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese then the recipe called for. Next time I'll either filet the breast or get some that are not quite as thick so you can taste the breading from each side per bite. Because of their size it took approx 40 minutes in the oven. Also, next time I will use a rack as the chicken got a bit soggy at the bottom. I paired this with the recipe for oven roasted asparagus (which also calls for Parmesan cheese) from this website and it was a big hit for my family! Will cook again and again. Easy and delicious!

This is a long review - brace yourself! I give the original recipe 5 stars. I give MY version of this recipe 7 stars! 1) I used more garlic and let it simmer with the olive oil for about 10 minutes. 2) I added a teaspoon of basil, oregano, and half a teaspoon of parsley to the bread crumb mixture. 3) I topped the chicken in the pan with tomato sauce, more basil, sea salt, and pepper. 4) I topped the whole thing with more cheese and croutons. (Yes, croutons. That's a trick I learned from watching Chef John. It makes a nice golden looking topping and is just an amazing crunchiness to contrast with the soft chicken.) There are lots of recipes just like this recipe for Garlic Chicken, but my version is more like Chicken Parmesan. So it just depends on what you like. This is one of those recipes that just gets better the more you modify it. :)

i made this recipe to a tee, except for making my own bread crumbs and i cut the chicken into nugget size pieces to get more flavor on each, and still it was NOT enough flavor. i know for a fact that if i had left the chicken breast the size it was originally and breaded it according to this recipe, me and my bf wouldve both hated it. it would have been even MORE bland than mine that was cut into small pieces that each have crust on the outside in order for them to at least have a flavor at ALL?? no. will not be making this again. but plan to find a much better crust for a garlic-ey chicken. but def not this one. i had to make my own honey mustard dipping sauce to make it edible.

This is my 1st review I've written.  I had to.  I wish it was because it's a great recipe like so many others I've used on this site. Unfortunately, it was very plain, boring and very dissapointing.  My husband Loves any kind of chicken... but not this kind. Like me, he could not believe this recipe received all the great reviews.  I even marinated it over night for extra flavor and used many suggestions. Do not make this unless you like bland chicken or you have time you'd like to waste.

This was very tasty, I loved the garlic.  Next time I am going to use buttermilk instead of the garlic oil.  This will be healthier and I think the breading would be a little crunchier.

Wanted a twist on my usual breaded chicken recipe, but it didnt taste much different. I still prefer dipping the chicken in egg or dijon mustard than in the garlic oil. thanks for sharing though

Outstanding!  We loved this.  I will make this frequently.  I served it over rice with Rosemary carrots; we thought this was a good combo. I mixed the breadcrumbs using a 50/50 mixture of regular breadcrumbs and panko  breadcrumbs.  After baking, I broiled this for about 2 minutes and the chicken browned nicely.  I used a nice, nutty freshly grated Parmesan; I think at made a huge difference.

This is a five star recipe just for the simplicity, but for taste it deserves more than five stars. I had two large boneless breast and instead of olive oil I marinated them in a zip-lock most the day in Italian dressing and the garlic. I used Italian bread crumbs and fresh finely grated Parmesan cheese for the coating, I did also put a bit of pepper and fresh oregano for added flavor. A 1/4 cup of each the bread crumbs and cheese coated my two breast perfectly with none leftover. I baked the breast on my stoneware baking sheet coated in olive oil. They baked 40 minutes to a beautiful golden brown crust, and perfectly tender and juicy on the inside. My husband said we never need to fry chicken again.  This paired perfectly with the Sesame Parmesan Zucchini on Allrecipes. I just placed the zucchini slices on the stoneware along with the chicken half way through the bake cycle. I was surprised at how well the coating stayed on my chicken, unlike many egg or milk coated meats I've made where the coating falls off. I'll certainly make this chicken again and again.

To bland and dry for us. If I made it again I would increase the garlic and decrease the cooking time.

This is a very good chicken dish. Bake on a rack to avoid most those pesky chicken juices when cooking..yuk! Can flip chick and low broil last 5-7 min to crisp up a bit. Very tender and savory.

Delicious!  I used Panko bread crumbs and a little Italian seasoning, and served with Basamati rice and piles of steamed broccoli.

There was not enough seasonings to really taste anything but chicken.  I don't think that adding more of 'these' ingredients would change the taste any.  I'm used to more flavorful dish's.  This was very bland.  Kids loved it simply because they love 'plain' chicken.

Crazy good.  I heated the oil and garlic in the microwave for 25 seconds and it worked fine.   I used 1/4 cup of the oil and the breading & parm, but only 2 chicken breasts.  Don't think there would be enough for 4 so I would double it if making 4 breasts.  This recipe is so easy and really is delish.

This is my favorite chicken recipe.  I always make lots and freeze it in portions in a vacuum bag to use at another time.  When I do this, I slightly undercook the chicken so it is not dry when reheated.

Carol, thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

So simple!  I used a pastry brush to coat the chicken, hoping to cut down on the amount of oil in the dish, then used the residual oil and garlic to saute the asparagus we had on the side.  The house smelled awesome while cooking!  Great go-to recipe.

This was pretty good, but I the chicken really should have gotten a little bit of seasoning before being breaded.  Also, it didn't really get nicely browned and crispy, so next time I think I'll use panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  I needed a little extra olive oil mixture and breading mixture, but that was probably because I had large pieces of chicken.

I made this recipe and although it wasn't terrible...it wasn't the greatest either. I felt the seasoning/breadcrumb mix was bland. The chicken came out nice and crispy though. Next time I would add more seasoning and maybe paprika.

425 is a bit high for baking chicken. i've always baked it at 350 to 375. even at 425 it was still somewhat moist just not mouthwatering moist. the bottom breadcrumbs kind of washed away and the ones that were left kind of burned. i followed the recipe pretty close except used butter instead of olive oil and added a bit extra garlic and also used parmesan seasoned bread crumbs (it's all i had). the breadcrumbs overtook the flavor of the garlic so you couldnt really taste the garlic as you would expect to. not too fond of the texture of bread crumbs anyhow. i would have to say this is a great recipe for someone who doesnt know how to cook worth a . just not for me. needs some serious tweaking.

I doubled this recipe last evening.  I had heated the oil and added crushed garlic and let the chicken breasts "sit" in this for a couple of hours.  I used Ritz crackers and Panko crumbs with the Parmesan cheese.  My guests went back for seconds as they'd never tasted such succulant and moist chicken.  A keeper!

We modified this recipe a little by omitting the parmesan cheese & substituting crushed saltine crackers (approx 18) mixed w/ black pepper, garlic & onion powder instead of the bread crumbs.  As previous reviews suggest, we marinated the chicken for several hours prior to baking.  Wow times 5!!!!!

I have made this before and it it is scrumptious.  Hubby and son loved it and ask for it often.  It is tender and juicy and the breadcrumb mixture with the garlic and oil is heavenly.  Great with fettucine alfredo as a side.  Excellent recipe, thanks!

This recipe is extremely simple to make.  It's juicy and full of flavor. Plus chicken is a great main dish and can be served with many varities of side dishes.  I've also made this same recipe and used pork chops as a substitute, however with the pork chops I only baked them for about 20 minutes.

The recipe as written was not exceptional, but I had to give credit to Carol for the idea itself.  With a little tweaking, I came up with a new family favorite.  I increased the olive oil to about 3/4 c. and the garlic to about 6-8 cloves minced and added a shake or two of hot pepper flakes to the mixture/marinade before heating it.  I also pounded the chicken a bit and allowed it to marinate in the olive oil mixture for about 2 hours before breading it.  I then used 2 cups FRESH bread crumbs (which my husband thinks makes all the difference in the world) and a little black pepper with the freshly grated Parmesan cheese and presto!  A hit for adults and kids alike!  Works very nicely with tenderloins too.

Quick and easy.  Kids liked it.  Next time I will cover the chicken with foil until the last 10 minutes to keep moist.  I will make this again.

So easy and so delicious!  This recipe has been a staple in our kitchen for the past year.  We found that using Italian breadcrumbs work best and adds the most flavor.  That being said, the flavor then depends on the quality of breadcrumbs and we've occasionally had to add oregano and salt.  Also, I put the olive oil and garlic in the baking dish first, the put all the chicken in that dish, flip them to make sure they're covered in the oil, then dip in breadcrumbs/parmesan, then back in the dish.  Saves a step, and you waste none of the olive oil.  Any remaining breadcrumbs/parmesan gets sprinkled atop the chicken before it goes into the oven.  Baking time is usually around 20 minutes, or until the crust is browned.  The best recipe for no-fail moist, delicious chicken!

The first time I made this, no one could get enough, and there were no leftovers.  It was a crispy outside, YUMM! Next time, I should have drained the olive oil off a little more, b/c it wasn't as crunchy.  Something I'll def keep in my recipe box though! MMM

I used crushed crackers because thats all I had.  I put garlic powder on the breast beforehand.  I thought it was awesome.  The chicken was very moist and tender. Thanks!

This recipe was very good and so easy to make!!  I did make some changes though and will continue to tweak the recipe a bit.  I added italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, seasoned salt and crushed black pepper to the bread crumb mixture.  We like things a bit spicy and adding the crushed red pepper didn't add enough spice, so we ended up drizzling hot sauce over the baked chicken.  I served this with my spicy broccoli/cheese/onion casserole and roasted onion potatos.  It was excellent!!

I made this for the second time last night. The first time, the bottom got soggy, but last night I put a baker's rack on top of my pan and flipped the chicken half way through cooking. The chicken was crispy on both sides, and the taste was great!

Delightful.. I used Japanese Panko and the chicken came out looking golden and crispy. As suggested by the other reviewers, I used 7 cloves of garlic, minced, and heated them with the butter in a microwave for 30 seconds. Then I marinaded the chicken ( lightly pounded ) a few hours before baking. I used powdered parmesan with the panko, but I added grated fresh parmesan cheese to the chicken during the last 5 minutes of baking. Wonderful recipe.

This chicken has excellent flavor!  I minced fresh garlic and added it to the oil.  I than microwaved the mixture for 40 seconds.  I than dipped in oil than in bread crumb mixture. I added 1/2 TBSP Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mix.  I took someone elses advice and covered the chicken for the first 40 minutes and than uncovered the last 10.  There were pros and cons to that...PRO: My husband said it was the best chicken I ever made!  CON: It didn't get that crispy crust I wanted.  The breading was mushy.  Like I said excellent flavor next time I will bake uncovered.  Hopefully my husband will still think it is the best!:)

I made this without any modifications the first time and it was really good.  The next time I made it, I used 4 cloves of garlic, and added about two tablespoons of chopped fresh basil to the olive oil and let it sit as I prepared my side dishes.  This is a good recipe for a quick meal during the week.  For a change of pace, I used Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of regular bread crumbs and sauteed the chicken in a nonstick skillet with a little olive to brown them and then finished them in the oven.  The Panko gives the chicken a nice crunchy crust.

Over the last three years I have made this recipe at least two dozen times.  It's easy, smells incredible while its cooking, and looks gourmet when it is done.  First of all, I LUB garlic.  I use at least 5-10 cloves for this recipe. I always double or triple the amount of bread crumb mixture as it goes fast with oil soaked chicken, but it is so simple that you can easily make some on the fly if you run out.  I use chicken breasts from the butcher which include the tender, so my cooking time is about 40 min. at 400. Having the tender attached allows you to stuff some garlic between the tender and the main breast. One more personal recommendation.  I like dipping sauces in general, my wife not so much.  She finds the breasts excellent the way I make them, without some sort of sauce.  I prefer a little sauce because butcher store breasts can be so huge.  The best compliment is Mississippi brand honey-mustard mayonnaise.  Usually found in the deli section at the grocery store.  It's made from egg yolks, and doesn't even have the nutritional information on the jar, so you know it's bad for you.  If you're going to be sinful that's my suggestion.  My mouth is already watering.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  A definite staple for my recipe box!  I took others suggestions by letting the chicken sit in the garlic/oil for a while (in the fridge, I used freshly shredded parmesan and Italian breadcrumbs.  I then added a little more parm on top to bake.  SO MOIST!  It was great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I took other reviewers advice and made this recipe and I'm so glad I did. It was easy and delicious. I made a couple of little changes. First off, I used butter instead of the olive oil (naughty me). Also, I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. I was disappointed that there wasn't more garlic flavor since I used 5 cloves. Next time I'll use garlic powder, it will make the recipe even easier and will probably stick to the chicken better. This was very good, the crust was crunchy and the meat stayed so moist. This one becomes a permanent part of my recipe file.

Not bad, but rather bland.  I had to add lemon pepper blend make it more appetizing.  That really spiced it up nicely.  I will make it again, but not without modifying the recipe.

Garlic lovers will thoroughly enjoy this recipe!  I followed some other reviewers' advice and also increased the amount of crushed garlic.  Can't have too much!  The chicken was so flavorful and moist (400 degrees for 30 minutes).  Not to mention how good the house smelled!  Delicious!

This recipe is wonderful.  I used minced garlic and added extra to the oil and I also sprayed the chicken with garlic flavored PAM.  I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs and added a dash of red pepper to the crumb mixture.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this for my son's birthday along with an Alfredo sauce recipe that's also on this site.  The chicken was excellent. The pieces I used were huge, so I had to double the amount of bread crumbs and cheese in order to fully coat the chicken.

Easiest and flavorful "oven fried" chicken I ever made, especially since I didn't have to fry it first.  
I even tried coating the chicken in the oil and garlic mixture, then placed in the fridge 
in a covered bowl for several hours.  When ready to use, just coated and baked!   A keeper.

Very tasty.  I cooked at a higher temp. for a short period of time to crisp up the coating.
I also cut into strips to cook more quickly.
I also added more garlic than called for.
Overall, a keeper.

An instant favorite. I am not a good cook so am always searching for easy recipes. I used the leftovers for sandwiches and cut up in a salad. Next time I will add more garlic. As a single person with no kids, this is a recipe I can use in a variety of ways. Yum!

Very good chicken recipe. I may add more garlic next time, but the amount given in the recipe provides a nice, subtle taste, not overpowering at all. The whole family liked it.

Excellent recipe, very easy and quick.
You can add as little or as much garlic as you like. Highly recommended.

So good and so easy. Perfect for a person who doesn't like complicated recipes and spending lots of time in the kitchen. I was impressed because the chicken was so moist and tender. 
A keeper for sure. 
Thanks

I really like this recipe, I just thought I would throw out there that the chicken will turn out even and crispy all around if you elevate it with a cookie cooling rack. Take a cookie sheet, line it with foil set the cooling rack on top and turn the edges of the foil up. The chicken will turn out awesome and the clean up is super easy.

This was very easy and tasty! We followed Sammarti's suggestion and used butter instead of oil as we prefer the rich taste butter gives food. We are always looking for recipes that don't take a lot of work to produce a great flavor and this one really fits the bill. We eat a LOT of chicken and love garlic so thank you Carol!

In this ongoing financial depression we eat A LOT of chicken at our house.  Thanks, Carol, for a really flavorful, easy recipe for the ubiquitous chicken breast!  We are thankful, indeed!  Made the recipe as written and added a little dried basil to the bread crumbs/cheese.  I sliced two plump breasts into four pieces about 3/8ths thick and gave them a light pounding (so they would cook faster).  Doing this also creates more chicken surface for the yummy crumb coating.  At 425 it takes 20 mins for done yet moist chicken and a nicely-browned, just crisp enough coating.  I also made a quick white sauce, adding 1/2 chicken bullion cube and shredded parma.  Could easily dress this up with fancy sides for guests.

Made it and even my pickiest critic liked it.  Definitely will make again but will try with panko bread crumbs to make it a bit more crispy.

I didn't make this exactly, but used it as a guide.  I had chicken thighs and Romano instead of parm, and I didn't want to use that much oil or mince up some fresh garlic, so I sprayed each thigh on all sides with cooking spray, and dredged in a mixture of Romano, bread crumbs, and garlic powder.  It was really tasty and husband really enjoyed it.

This recipe did make very moist, flavorful chicken!
I read a lot of the reviews and combined them to make these changes...
I used 6 chicken breasts, a whole head of garlic, doubled the bread crumbs and "green canister" Parmesan cheese, and a dash of fresh black pepper. I put the oil/garlic mixture that had cooled off into a resealable bag, added the chicken breasts and squished the oil and garlic around each piece to coat (worked great!). Dipped each piece in the crumb mixture than cooked for 30 minutes at 425 degrees. Added fresh grated Parmesan on each piece of chicken at the table. Served with fresh bread and broccoli.

I use a bit more of the ingredients that called for...just makes it easier. I warm the garlic in the oil and add fresh basil from my garden. I also poke some holes to infuse the garlic and oil into the chicken. The temp and timing works great! YUM...very much a favorite at my house.

I thought this was very good- the chicken came out super moist and delicious! The only problem I had was that I couldn't taste the garlic as much as I would have liked, but that is easily remedied by adding more garlic next time! My family all enjoyed this :)

Awesome recipe.  I use this to make chicken parmasan.  Follow this recipe, then add tomato sauce and cheese and put back in the oven for another 5 minutes for the cheese to melt.  Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe and if doubled can serve as the lead in for an evening of leftovers made into chicken parmesan!! Because the chicken stays juicy and tender, I keep marinara on hand...I reheated the leftovers in a small skillet with about a 1/2-3/4 c of water, cover-for about 15min), crack the lid to vent for another 10 min until water evaporates. Heat marinara, pour over top and top with parmesan...This was my favorite chicken parmesan of ALL TIME! Not to mention they were FABULOUS the first night done exactly as written by this talented cook!;))

I love this chicken! I am a points+ weight watcher and lighten it up by substituting the olive oil and crushed garlic infusion for 1/4 cup egg beaters mixed with 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic powder. The rest is the same. This switch saves 1 point per serving. Excellent!

The chicken turned out very moist. I didn't taste much garlic after cooking, but I only used 3 small cloves. I also roasted a few red potatoes in the same pan which I mixed with the garlic/olive oil mixture. The parmesan cheese got nice and crunchy after baking...mmm.

I have just made this for myself, husband, son and two granddaughter age 2 and 3, and it was an all-round hit.  I used thinly sliced chicken breast otherwise followed the recipe.  I baked french fries adding them to the oven for the last 20 mins.  This was the quickest meal I have ever made for them which I didn't prep before they arrived.  Broccoli and carrots added vitamins and color. A win win win.

Made this exactly as stated in the recipe - making sure I used 2 tsp of crushed garlic. (It took quite a few cloves to get to that amount.)

It was great.  The flavor was not overpowering - chicken was flavorful and moist.

This is a good starting point, but it was kind of bland when I used just the recipe. My 6-yr-old son tasted it and suggested sprinkling it with lemon juice. That did the trick! It was delicious.

Very good...  I cut the breasts in strips... i baked them a bit long so it was a bit dry, but the flavor was great! No oil... I diped the chicken in italian dressing and then dredged them in bread crumb/parm mix.  Yummy!

This was very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the amount of garlic. I also let the chicken breasts soak in the olive oil and garlic mixture for about an hour. That makes a huge difference in flavor and texture. I added black pepper for some extra kick. I'll definitely make this again!

The garlic-infused oil is the key.  I've made similar recipes before, but the warmed oil and garlic - yum!  A big hit with our family.  We used 5 cloves, pressed instead of crushed, as it was easier for the kids, who were helping us with dinner.

As another reviewer suggested, I served this alongside the light fettuccini alfredo, fantastic combo!  I think I cooked the chicken a bit too long as it was a little dry.  I think next time I will saute the chicken in some of the garlic oil  before baking to get a crisper crust and cut down on the cooking time.  Over all, a good chicken recipe.

This is a great recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. What makes it even better that it is such a simple recipe packed with flavor. I was wanting to cook last night but was not wanting to go to the store for anything and the added bonus with this is most people probably have all the ingredients on hand! This will become a regular in my house for a fast, easy, and packed full of flavor meal!

AMAZING! It turned out so moist and delicate! I recommend using good quality bread crumbs (I get mine at a bakery) I didn't measure any of the ingredients, I just eye balled it because this recipe is so simple. I used more garlic because I love garlic, and I added thyme, salt and pepper to the olive oil. I also added some salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. I served it with this salad, which everyone should learn to make because it so simple and fresh: spinach or chopped lettuce, a little bit of finely minced garlic, a splash of rice vinegar, a splash of olive oil (1:1 ratio olive oil and vinegar), some salt and pepper to taste and a squeeze of lime or lemon (if you have it around). The salt is important, its something i'd never think of putting in salad but so good. Happy cooking!

This is coming from someone who isn't big on chicken. - Super easy Easy & very tasty!   Ate this with plain quinoa & steamed veggie so I never felt this was greasy as other reviews stated.  Used a thermometer so I didn't over bake and it came out a little earlier than 30 min.  Will make again!

I've made this twice so far & the whole family loves it! My 3 yr old daughter is super picky & she asked for seconds! I used to make a similar recipe using butter instead of olive oil...but this recipe is healthier & much tastier! We'll be eating this once a week for sure! Thanks!

I love that this is easy, but it is a so very average dish.  There are tons of better ways to make baked/breaded chicken breasts on this site.

This was good except for the fact that I didn't taste any garlic in the chicken... I let the oil and garlic sit for about 5 hours and I even warmed a pan with the mixture before dipping the chicken in...

This is one of those recipes that is ridiculously easy and tastes, well, professional!  I love that I can prep the oil/garlic and the dry coating early in the day and then pull it out when it's time to make dinner! Hint: crushing up some french fried onions and adding them to the dry coating is a great addition. Thank you so much for posting - this is a keeper!

Delicious, moist and very easy.  I used a combo of butter and olive oil and also added more garlic.  I did find I had to use more bread crumbs and parmesan.  I drizzled the leftover butter/olive oil mixture over the top to add more flavor and crunch.  So easy as I always have these ingredients on hand.

I altered a few things on the recipe, just because I know how we like things, and it came out awesome. I doubled the sauce and the breading, because I used thin-sliced chicken breast. Also, I used half butter and half oil, and about 6 cloves of garlic, and I used plain Panko. I added salt and pepper to the panko. Then I baked them at 425 for 15 minutes and 450 for 3 minutes to brown them up. They were SO delicious! Thank you for this great idea! :)  6/30 - I made them again for my mom and stepfather's welcome home party and everyone lost their minds. We had some leftovers and they weren't as good the next day, so don't hesitate to eat it all that night!

I have made this several times and found the perfect combinatio,  though as written it's ok.  
I marinate breasts in either italian or ranch dressing overnight or for at least 30 minutes, then pound them flat.  The breading I use is 1/2 parm and 1/2 garlic croutons pulsed in a food processor until fine crumbs.  To this I add a little pepper and garlic salt...  Turns out perfect every time and the croutons make it extra crispy.  My kids love it!

Cooked this in the middle of my rice dish and let it rest while I broiled my other side. The chicken was very moist and the garlic infused olive oil was amazing. Deffinately need to have bread crumbs shake and bake was my replacement.

I have no idea what I did wrong.  I followed this to the 't' and it ame out soggy.  What we were able scrap off was yummy.  But the chicken itself was soggy with the breading not really on there.  I was quite disappointed.  Who knows?  Maybe I did something really wrong.  We will try it again since the flavor was there and were are hoping it was a fluke.  But given dinner last time...I can only give it a three.  Sorry!  We had such high hopes.

Excellent and easy. Used frozen garlic cubes and needed a bit more bread crumbs. Also only had chicken thighs. Made it before with breasts and will try with haddock or other white fish too.

My 3-yr-old asked for seconds, and my husband said, "Next time you go grocery shopping, buy all and enough ingredients to make this seven days a week."  Def a hit with my family.  I used garlic and herb bread crumbs and followed the recipe exactly.  My daughter and husband dipped their chicken in ranch dressing, so next time I will make this using chicken tenders.

Ummy, yummy, yummy...everyone cleaned their plate at dinner. Tender is an understatement. This melts in your mouth. Good past experiences led me to bake it in our toaster oven, and I think that took this recipe from great to amazing. I highly recommend this recipe...and the toaster oven:)

I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I crushed up some corn flakes to use instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and the chicken came out flavorful and moist! Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe. The flavour was great (I did double the garlic as suggested by other reviewers). I found that the parmesan/crumb mixture wasn't sticking to the chicken completely so I think next time I'll bread it using an egg wash instead.

super tender chicken. used 5-6 cloves of garlic, 2 (large chicken breasts), served with asparagus (parmesean garlic from this site) and home made mashed potatoes. would be nice to have an alfrado sauce for dipping on the side next time. Overall very yummy and little prep time; super fast!

My husband and I made this for dinner last night. He is working late all this week, so I wanted something that was no fuss. We used chicken tenders because that's what I had on hand. Also we didn't heat the oil..just dipped the chicken in the oil then into the breadcrumb mix that I had added the garlic to. They were finished baking at 25 minutes. The chicken came out moist and very tasty! Thanks for sharing this recipe..we will be making this again for sure!

This was wonderful- crunchy outside and moist inside. Mine was perfect after 25 minutes. The only change was to warm the garlic and olive oil on the stovetop w/ a little crushed red pepper. I turned the heat off once it was fragrant. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder and added a little oregano to the bread crumbs. My bf said it was the best chicken I ever made.

almost perfect! double the garlic, and you'll probably need more olive oil than what the recipe originally calls for.

Amazing recipe!  My family wasn't crazy about it, unfortunately, but I loved it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I made it with seitan instead of chicken, and I also substituted matzo meal for the breadcrumbs because that was what I had on hand.  My seitan comes prepackaged in smaller pieces, so I had to double the oil and breading, but this was really an incredibly simple recipe, and it tasted great.  I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was greasy.  Perhaps I'll make it with Italian dressing next time instead of olive oil.  Also thought it didn't have much "flavor."

This is a wonderful chicken recipe.It is easy and fast.I made the garlic infused oil earlier in the day,with more garlic than called for(my preference).Panko crumbs are my choice of bread crumbs and fresh grated peccorina parm. cheese.Very tasty.I served "Farewell to Basil Fettucine"(from this site)with a jarred alfredo sauce.This recipe will definitly be used often,both for the two of us or for company.

Use a shallow baking dish!  

I followed the recipe to the letter (...with the exception of additional garlic).  While good, I did not get the moist results other reviewers have mentioned.  This may have been my fault - I used a VERY shallow cookie sheet - not a shallow baking dish.  This may have been the issue.  I will make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time.  The olive oil makes the chicken very moist no matter how long you cook it.  I always over cook by about 10 min. just to be sure.  My husband loves this dish with a baked  potato & peas :)

This is one of the best, most easiest recipes for chicken EVER. The only think I did different was add salt, pepper, seasoning salt and a pinch of red pepper to the bread crumb mixture.  IT was fantastic!

Wonderful!  I was concerned that it would not be spicy enough for our family so, I added Old Bay Seasoning and some red pepper flakes.  Great!  Additionally, I left this "simmering" on very low heat while I dripped the chicken (bone-in breasts and bone-in thighs).  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs because it was what I had on hand.

I made this a few times, and I finally got it perfect.  I took a little from different raters on this site to match our tastes.  To 1/4 cup olive oil, I added 2 tsp. fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, 1/4 tsp. sea salt (My husband doesn't like too much salt.), and a sprinkle of pepper.  I warmed on low.  The bread crumb mixture was 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 whole wheat bread crumbs, and Italian seasoning.  I also rubbed 1 tsp of fresh basil and 1 tsp. of fresh oregano on the chicken breasts before coating with bread crumbs and oil. I baked at 400 degress for 25 minutes.  They were thin chicken breasts.  It came out so amazing.  My husband LOVED it.  Be sure that you don't overcook it.

YUM! This is perfect for an easy weeknight meal, but could easily be dressed up a bit and served to company. The chicken stayed juicy and was very flavorful. I don't usually buy packaged  dried bread crumbs, so  I made fresh bread crumbs by putting a couple slices of whole wheat bread into the food processor, chopping them into crumbs, and then toasting them in the toaster oven at 200Â° until they were dry. The texture was perfect!

This garlic chicken was awesome.  I LOVE that it was breaded but didn't call for flour or eggs.  I added 7 cloves of garlic plus garlic powder, some kosher salt, and pepper.  I will be keeping this recipe in my rotation.  Wonderful! Thank you!

My husband gave 4 3/4 * so I rounded up. These were great and easy. I used a lot of garlic & the end result was still pretty subtle. I used chicken tenders instead of breasts so they were like chicken strips. We will have them a lot I an sure as our 2 1/2 year old gobbled them up!

This chicken is just amazing! It is moist and tender on the inside, crisp and flavorful on the outside, and somewhere in between the garlic is there. The garlic taste isn't too extremely overpowering which is nice. I use crushed up Ritz crackers for the coating, leaving some big chunks for a crunchier texture. The crackers also brought a nice buttery kind of flavor to the blend. My family now constantly asks for this chicken dinner almost every week they loved it so much. It is just a very very good recipe. (tastes good as a meal with seasoned wild rice cooked in chicken broth and some green beens or blend of vegetables.)

I have made this chicken many many times and it's fantastic. The chicken stays very moist and the garlic, bread crumbs, and cheese make it very flavorful. I've also used this recipe to make chicken Parmesan. Just follow this recipe and then add some sauce and mozzerella cheese and bake for a few more minutes.  You get a healthier, more flavorful chicken Parmesan.

Great base recipe. I added Italian seasoning to both the olive oil and the bread crumbs, and placed the chicken over a bed of sliced onions. I also poured the excess olive oil around the chicken to help keep it moist and prevent sticking. My husband loved it and requested I add it to our recipe collection.

I've made this several times and waited to review it because I had a lot of problems with the recipe.  NOTE: use the canned parmesan cheese, I was using fresh and it burned every time.  This is a good chicken meal, especially when you're in a rush.  I still use fresh parmesan, but I just sprinkle it on during the last five minutes.  Also, I follow another reviewers advice and marinade the chicken in olive oil and garlic for about 12 hours as well.

I gave it 5*s because everyone in my family REALLY liked it. For me, however, I'd prefer more flavor so I'll season the chicken before hand next time.  The scrumptious smell didn't equal the final taste for me.  Loved the crunchy + tender/moist combo!  I'll definitely make it again.

We just had this for dinner tonight. Very good dish and easy, too! I doubled the plain bread crumbs and cheese and added the following to the mixture (approximates as I don't measure): 1 1/2 TBS oregano; 2tsp basil; 2 tsp red pepper; 2 tsp onion powder and 2 tps garlic powder. A little salt and pepper. I also increased the amount of garlic with the olive oil. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The family loved it. This is a keeper!

I doesn't get any easier than this, people!  This chicken turns out delicious, full of flavor and tender each and every time I make it.  For awhile, it was on the weekly rotation...and for anyone interested in a quick and easy weeknight meal that appeals to many, look no further.  Personally, I am addicted to garlic and opt to use more and have at times used butter in place of the oil.  Two thumbs up - thanks!

This was so very easy and good! I used the minced garlic from a jar but think it needs something a bit stronger. I will experiment but that is the ONLY thing I would change. I greased tin foil and put it on a baking sheet to cook the chicken so didn't even have to clean the pan. I cooked it for 28 minutes and it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. JUST WONDERFUL!!

Another 5 star review.  This was a very tasty way to make chicken.  Just the right amount of garlic flavor.  I will definately be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe for a pleasant dinner.  It's not difficult to prepare, so it's perfect for the end to a long day at work.  Baked dishes are always something to keep close - a fresh alternative to unhealthy fried concoctions.  If you're a fan of garlic, this is a great recipe. I prepared this for my family tonight and was pleased with the results.  I used organic garlic, so the flavor seemed just perfect for me.  Also, I tweaked the recipe by adding pepper, a little salt, and onion powder to the dry mixture, and simply drudged the meat through the nice mix. It helped balace out the strong smell, and in the end, I think it aided the overall flavor.The sides we had were mashed potatoes from our garden, and green beans stirred with pepper and bacon for flavor.  Warm apples topped with cinnamon finished off the dessert portion of the meal.  But the chicken was a great staple.  Don't expect a gourmet type of delicacy, as far as the chicken goes.  Be ready for a simple and easy (flavorful) serving of chicken.  Oh, and if you use a convection setting for the bake, make sure to watch the chicken closely, as the cook time will be shorter.

I pounded the chicken breasts out so they would cook quick & even. At first I was worried that they would turn out too oily...but they were fine.  I cooked uncovered to keep breading crispy. It turned out excellent.

Although this was very good, it was a little bland for our taste.  I will make this again, but I will add a few spices to the crumb mixture.  It was very easy to make, so I will continue to tweak it so that we like it a little better.

This recipe was fabulous and so easy to make. It took me a total of five minutes to prepare. Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed up Ritz crackers and in addition to the parmesan cheese, I added Romano and asiago cheese. After putting the chicken in the pan I drizzled about a 1/2c. white wine over it. Turned out amazing!!! I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was very easy and quite nice. I'd never baked chicken before and it turned out perfectly. Be careful to adjust the cooking time to the heat of your particular oven. Mine was done almost 10 minutes early and would have dried out if I didn't check on it. Also, it is a simple flavor, so if you like more complicated flavor combinations, it might not be for you. Thanks!

This was so easy and flavorful! My husband said 4 stars but I say 5. I did use other reviewers tips, I used 5 cloves if pressed garlic and a little salt & pepper. Also, after warming the garlic and oil I placed it in a ziplock bag with the chicken for about 20 minutes. I used the 4 person recipe but only had 3 breasts which worked out well because it only made enough of the bread crumb mixture for 3 breasts.

I made this tonight for the 4th time in a period of 3 or 4 months.  I try not to make duplications very often, but find that this is such a well received meal by my husband and extremely picky kids!  Having no complaints during dinner is such a NICE experience!!!!  I usually use chicken tenders and cook about 25 minutes tops.  This way there is more flavor -- it permeates the chicken a little more.

Scrumptious! It was like delicious fried chicken without all the nasty grease & guilt, but the garlic & parmesan added a delicious flavor! I used extra garlic, and crushed it up in the blender with the olive oil to make kind of a puree so the garlic would flavor the chicken more. I also always cut my chicken into smaller pieces. I can't believe the fat & calories are so low in regards to the taste. My husband said the chicken was awesome, and my 7 year old loved it too. It was an all around hit! I will be adding this one into my rotation of meals for sure!

Made this tonight using center cut pork chops and the recipe was delicious w/the pork. I used about 6 cloves of garlic pressed into about 1/2 cup olive oil & gently cooked (don't let the garlic brown) for a few minutes, then dipped the 8 big chops in the garlicky oil,then in the bread crumb mixture. Very easy! Wasn't sure of the time, so went about 55 minutes -- a bit too long, but the crunchy bits on the chops were delicious! Next time will cook for only 45-50 mins for moister chops, but had a great flavor, and went well w/warmed cinnamon applesauce. Tip: line your pan w/non-stick Reynolds foil, and clean-up is a breeze.

A simple, good recipe. Very easy to make, but I think I'll use chicken tenders next time for more crunch per bite. Smells great cooking, I used fresh crushed garlic.

I fixed this tonight for dinner and my husband loved it!  Heâs not a picky eater but he is use to a fairly high caliber of dishes and this was a hit, and with so little prep time involved I loved it.  Next time I think Iâll make my breadcrumbs a bit coarser, and not grate the cheese as fine.  Canât wait to try variations of this dish, panko and sesame seed oil with ginger or even minus the Parmesan and then crumble blue cheese on the top.  I can see this is going to be a base dish for some of our favorites.

I'm not a big fan of garlic, but everyone else who ate it thought it was great.

I always soak the chicken for 30-45 minutes in lemon juice and salt (after it's been cleaned and before it's been cooked), which seemed to compliment the garlic very nicely.  I also sprinkled some lemon juice on the chicken before it went in the oven.

I made this twice now.  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs, just what I had hand.  A little tip, first time I cooked in a roasting pan, didn't crisp all that well so I broiled it at the end.  Next time used "shallow" pan, which recipe suggested, viola, big difference.  Nice and crispy.  I also pounded the chicken and only cooked for 20 minutes.

I have easily made this a dozen times it is so wonderful! Should have rated it sooner. I agree with using the extra garlic and using italian bread crumbs and keep an eye on the cooking time. Twenty five minutes or so is plenty.  I pound the chicken then let it marinate in the infusion for an hour.  Always so moist and flavourful! Also for a litlle change, this is also excellent if you add marinara and mozzarella for a chicken parmegiana style twist!  Serve over a bed of pasta.  Yummy!

Great recipe! Turned out so much more moist than I expected. I used seven cloves of garlic, minced, and it was just garlicky enough. Next time I'm going to use more cheese in the mixture. I made this last night and my family loved it - they're already begging me to make it again! Thanks a lot for this simple but great recipe!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I have done minor variations in the cheese - only because I used whatever was in my cheese drawer at the time.  I also added much more garlic (as other reviewers mention) but I minced mine so that some of it stuck to the chicken.  My family loves this (kids have it with Ranch dip) and I love having leftovers that don't get thrown out!  It's great chopped up with a green salad and a honey mustard dressing.  Thanks for a new staple to my recipe box!

It was really moist and garlicky...Yum!  However, I added a lot more garlic...about 9 cloves or so and crushed them myself for added flavor.  Otherwise, it might be bland.  It wasn't overpowering at all.  One thing I would do next time is to add more bread crumb mix.  I used the Garlic & Herb bread crumb mix and added more garlic salt to the mix.  I salt & peppered my chicken individually before mixing, and let it sit in the marinade overnight in the fridge.  I'm already craving this garlic chicken!  Oh, I used boneless, skinless thighs and were perfect...cheaper too! (frozen)

This chicken was unbelievably delicious -- the flavour was wonderful! I followed some of the advice of others: I used six cloves of garlic, minced and lightly warmed with the olive oil. I also mixed in some garlic seasoning with the bread crumbs and parmesan. I added melted margerine (instead of butter) to the bottom of the baking pan as suggested by some people, however I would recommend keeping an eye on the chicken if you do so as it burned, and burned the bottom of some of the smaller pieces of chicken. (I think I'll use cooking spray next time.) A wonderful recipe that was fairly simple. I will definitely make this again!

Not that anyone needs my approval, but I loved this chicken.  I have tried different versions of garlic chicken, and this was the best.  I took everyone's advice and doubled the garlic and I put butter in the bottom of the dish prior to baking.  I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts--because of that, I had to double the amount of oil and breadcrumbs.  However, it turned out juicy and delicious!

Wow!! The whole family loved this!  Definately a keeper.  I added a bit of garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture as suggested by others. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This is a great way to do chicken breasts if you're looking for something quick. It literally took me just minutes to throw these ingredients together and then dip the chicken in them. I used every else's ideas and added Italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture. Defiantly a Keeper !! Thanks

Very good. Family liked it and the chicken was moist. I took another post's advice and covered tightly with tinfoil. Make sure you turn the chicken pieces over about 1/2 way through - mine were nicely browned on the bottom and had to be turned.  Quite delicious!

This makes chicken so delicious and moist.  I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  Our younger son (the picky one!) loved it....and even asked if there was any left the next day because he wanted more.

This chicken was outstanding! I followed the recipe perfectly and it turned out so tender and flavorful. My children said they couldn't taste the garlic (for them, that's a good thing, LOL) but my husband and I could. Fantastic! Thanks, Carol! :o)

I made this today and we all loved it.  I used four thick chicken breast halves, no pounding, and increased all the other ingredients.  I could have gotten by with 1/3 of each instead of 1/2.  I used 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.  425 degrees for 30-35 minutes is perfect!  Outside was crunchy and golden, inside was juicy.  I will use this quick and easy recipe again and again.  Thanks.

Yum! We used a lot more garlic than the recipie called for, and it made the house smell so good! I also used chicken fingers instead of breasts because that's what I had, and I put them on a wire rack above the pan so that they would not get soggy on the bottom. Very good! We had them with mashed potatoes and gravy. A comfort meal!

I doubled this recipe (for other doubling ideas, check my other reviews).  A 3 star means it was ok, but I won't make it again unless I do something different.  I doubled the bread crumbs and it still wasn't enough.  I would probably triple the bread crumbs.  I used italian crumbs and 6-8 cloves of garlic.  I flipped them half way through which made the coating less dry and I would next time pour any of the extra butter/garlic mixture in the baking pan.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could. It was very easy and the finished product exceeded the prep time. It took me longer than the listed cooking time to get my breasts done, but they were pretty big. Total time in the oven was 40 minutes. My husband LOVED this and my mother in law commented on how wonderful the house smelled when she stopped over. I did add some basil, oregano, onion salt and black pepper to the bread crumb mixture and I used Romano cheese instead of parmesan because that is all that I had. ********** -- 10 stars!

I always add more garlic than a recipe calls for, and this was no exception.Doubled the garlic in the oil and it worked really well. Only had bone-in skin-on chicken breasts, so I just went for it. Doubled the recipe per other reviewer's suggestions, and added Mrs Dash(Garlic and Herb) and a big dash of pepper. Also, a pinch of paprika. It turned out great, hubbie liked it alot. I did find the breadcrumbs got a little too wet, next time I would probably add 2 TBSP of margarine to bread crumb mixture before coating to see if it would help. Or, maybe reserve some of infused olive oil and do same...hmmm. Anyway, thank you and this was a great way of appeasing a husband who rarely gets red meat.

Definately cover the chicken for most of the baking time.  I also minced the garlic and browned it, used a little extra Parm and Italian flavored breadcrumbs.  Also I coated the chicken in egg, then flour, then oil and then the breadcrumbs.  It helps everything stick together a little bit better.  It was very good!

It was so delicious!  And very quick.  I did like someones: doubled the garlic and put the chicken very thin.
I recommended to mix salt with the bread crumbs.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Considering all the rave reviews, this recipe didn't "do it" for me.  It was pretty much as bland as the ingredients (bread crumbs and parmesan??? not very exciting).  Anyway, you definitely need to pound the chicken and at least double the amount of garlic.  I'd maybe have given it 4 stars if I had doubled the garlic and if it would've given it more flavor.  Thank goodness I added salt and pepper to those bread crumbs.

Oh my ....... this was the best recipe ever.  I doubled the garlic like everyone said and it turned out great.  I took the leftover olive/oil garlic mix and sauted it with pasta for a side dish and it was fantastic.  GREAT DINNER and easy to make

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  We just love garlic and this is a wonderful recipe for something different.  I left out the breadcrumbs and doubled the parmesan cheese in this recipe since I am watching my carbs.  Wonderful with a large plate of freshly steamed green veggies.  Wonderful flavor and very easy to make.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is easy and delicious. I brined the chicken first, and it came out so moist and tender. I would definitely make it again. It goes with any side dish, but I served it with spoonbread and corn on the cob.  The garlic makes it smell so good while it's cooking!

Followed recipe as written but did add a little extra garlic.  Great chicken.  Always looking for different recipes for chicken.  Definitely added to my recipes box.

I always come back to this recipe. Easy, delicious and adaptable. Works with fillets, pieces or smaller chunks (like nuggets of real chicken)
Just as delicious cold the next day. Great for picnics.
Update 2016: still a favourite. I like to add something green to the crumbs (dried Italian herb mix or parsley, chopped fresh chives) Makes it look pretty (can't buy seasoned breadcrumbs here)
I also try to heat the olive oil and garlic in advance if I can. Letting it infuse for an hour or two enhances the flavour even more. 2018 - have now been making this recipe for  twelve years. Itâs great. Itâs reliable. Itâs always impressive. Try it!

Made this recipe a few times and I love it. If you are making it in bulk the coating are good for 6 servings too. That way you don't have those useless leftovers.

I don't really follow recipes, I just kind of modify them. I heated the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of garlic salt on the stovetop. I boiled the chicken part way so the outside was cooked and the inside was still uncooked. I then put the chicken and olive oil mixture into a large Tupperware container and shook it. I let that sit for about 5 minutes and then drain the oil. Instead of regular bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, I used Italian bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese and put it in the Tupperware and shook it as well. Made sure the cheese and bread was covered on the chicken and baked covered on 400 for 40 minutes

This is tasty and VERY easy to cook up. I always reduce the oven temp to 400 however and check the meat at 25 minutes. Most of the time it is cooked through if I have pounded the meat a little. This is certainly in our rotation!

very easy and very delicious. We really enjoyed! I think next time I'll try a low fat version as suggested by another reviewer (low fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil)

I LOVE this chicken, and everything about it! I prefer to use panko instead of traditional bread crumbs though. I advise you cut slits in the chicken so it cooks on the inside faster. And go ahead and try popping 4 or 5 cloves of garlic instead of 2. Creates a more intense garlicky flavour. I also like adding some salt, black pepper, and paprika to the breadcrumb mixture. Try it, and you'll for it too!

I just made this today and it was super easy and very yummy. For a baked dish, this comes out quite juicy. The only thing I did differently was add a parmesan cheese mix with red peppers to give it an extra kick.

This recipe was great!!  My husband said it was the best chicken I've ever made.  I added a little butter to the olive oil and garlic pan, and used about twice as much garlic as recipe calls for.  My family asked if I would use even more garlic next time.

Made this last night but substituted shredded cheddar since my two men (My son and husband) do not like Paremesan:) I liked it a lot but next time will add more garlic because it wasn't garlicky enough for me. :)

I had to double the recipe for my family but otherwise followed as instructed. WE LOVED IT!!!  Every member of the family gave this a "must make again" stamp of approval.  The flavor was delicious, chicken very moist. I even found myself scooping some of the drippings out of the pan and eating that when I was cleaning up. haha I do have a few leftovers and I cant wait to eat that for lunch.

Thank you for sharing this easy delicious chicken recipe.

Very simple, quick, and tasty.  My husband and teenage stepson ate every last bite (which gave me no leftovers for lunch - bummer!).  I did use more garlic than called for (3-4 tsp) because we love garlic.  I also added about a tsp of Sriracha to the oil/garlic mix, because we love spicy, too - next time (and there WILL be one) I will use even more.  The "shake-and-bake" method did work the best for coating the chicken.  I had shredded parm, so it didn't really stick to the chicken, but I sprinkled it on top and it made a delicious crust.  I used Italian bread crumbs and added paprika.  Baked at 400 for 20-25 minutes and it was crispy outside and tender inside.  I paired this with fresh roasted green beans sprinked with lemon juice and sea salt, and whole wheat pasta dressed with a little butter and sun-dried tomato pesto.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing a delicious, easy main dish!

We really really liked this, it is definitely a keeper . I marinated the chicken in zesty Italian dressing instead of the olive oil and garlic to add a bit more flavor and it was very good.

This is a great way to make easy and moist chicken. I used panko breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese, I had to press almost a whole head of garlic, but it was worth it. I heated the garlic and olive oil in the micro wave   for about 20 seconds; that was enough. I also topped it off  with fresh ground black pepper before cooking. The result was tender, juicy and delicious.

I've made this several times and my family loves it! Last time I added a bit more oil, couple Tbsp, increased the breadcrumbs to half cup using half seasoned and half panko. Delicious!

I used minced garlic instead of crushed and I didn't have grated parm so I used an italian blend shredded cheese. This recipe turned out great and it's so simple for weeknight cooking.

This recipe was excellent.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I substituted crushed, seasoned croutons and it was soooooo good and added a little crunchiness to the top of the chicken.  My kids loved the chicken, too.  Served it with roasted potatoes, peas, and rolls.  Yum.  Thank you!

Delicioso! Perfectly moist and flavorful. Please do not use italian dressing in place of the olive oil/garlic mixture. Not the same recipe! Besides, I'd rather have all the good fats from the olive oil, than the sodium, sugars and preservatives from the bottled dressing. Thanks for a not-so-boring chicken dinner!

I really wanted to give this more than 3 stars... but it REALLY LACKS IN FLAVOR! (And the bake temp is TOO HIGH!!) As is, it is pretty dry & bland.
I even took the advice of another review & coated the chicken in Italian dressing instead of olive oil. The dressing idea worked well- I'm sure it turned out better than what it would have been using the oil. But I REALLY wish I would have added some additional seasonings to this dish. More garlic (in powder form), some onion powder, SALT, pepper, etc... is IDEAL to mix in w/ the bread crumbs to coat the chicken. 
I also liked the suggestion of other reviews to use the very finely grated, nearly powder parmesan (like the Kraft green bottle). I left the fresh grated to sprinkle on top just before baking. I also mixed half regular bread crumbs & half panko... the coating result w/ those adjustments was AMAZING! (If only the dish had more flavor & less of a bake temp...) 
So when it comes to baking temp- 425 is TOO HIGH! Yes, the dish may cook a bit faster, but it was EXTREMELY dry. Not moist & tender. Next time will try 350-375. Dryness + lack of flavor left us resorting to ranch & honey mustard for a dipping sauce. 
Will make again, but w/ some major adjustments & less of a bake temp. Definitely read some of the more critical reviews & follow advice if making this! A good base- but needs a LOT more flavor & a few adjustments.

This chicken is delicious.  The only thing I did different was to use italian seasoned bread crumbs.  This was an easy and FAST recipe for during the week.  Try it you will like it.

Yummy! I honestly did not expect much of this even though the reviews seem to rave about it. I was proven absolutely wrong! The flavors meld together really well. Made this with strips of boneless chicken thigh and had it with a salad. I liked it so much I made it again the next day, this time increasing the garlic and reducing the olive oil. Prefer it with more garlic and less oil. I heated the minced the garlic and olive oil in the micro on low for two minutes, stirring every thirty seconds. Also added some chili flakes because I like the heat. Added the chicken to the garlic/oil mixture and mixed to coat, and then added the parm/bread crumbs to the same bowl. Less clean up! Gave the parm/bread crumbs mixture a few whirs in the blender so that the chicken would look just like fried chicken, and not have the little parm flakes sticking out after baking. I definitely see myself making this over and over again. So easy, and tastes amazing.

Fast, easy, delicious. My husband loves it. I've been using olive oil that's already infused with garlic to either save a step or make it extra garlic-y.

This was easy to make and enjoyed by everyone in the family (including a three-year-old). I made the recipe as indicated, but had smaller chicken breasts, so I only baked it for 20 minutes.

I also made this for a family from church and they LOVED it.

Five stars aren't nearly enough!  I put the chicken, olive oil and a tablespoon of garlic paste in a baggie, squished it all around and let sit for a few minutes, then followed the recipe to a T.  Delicious with the "roasted garlic lemon broccoli" recipe on this site!

Very easy, quick to prepare and yummy.  I doubled the garlic, and for my family I need to quadruple it next time to get a deeper flavor!!
The acid test: YES the kids are taking the leftovers for their school lunch tomorrow :)

I made this yesterday for the fam and it was very very well liked! It was so easy to make and fast, super tasty. In lieu of bread crumbs I crushed croutons used in turkey stuffing. Additionally, I made a gravy with chicken bouillon, heavy cream, and water (see sage pork), which when added to these chicken breasts definitely completed them. Served with plain veggies and rice. Will be making this one again. So yummy!

This was sooooo easy AND delicious! Had it with sauteed broccoli and spinach salad with an olive oil/basalmic dressing. AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! This one is going into the regular rotation!!!   I used an infused olive oil and not plain olive oil and we used 3 cloves of garlic.  Our chicken breasts were large so we needed triple the parmesan and breadcrumbs.  I think some of the negative reviews are because of a few possibilities:

People didn't dry their chicken before dredging in the oil.
They skipped the step of warming the oil with the garlic or needed more garlic.
They used an unflavored olive oil that wasn't "pure" olive oil; hence- no flavor. (The bottle will only list "olive oil" in the ingredients if it is pure.)
They used butter instead of olive oil and butter WILL burn faster than olive oil and make it soggy.
Using low-fat Italian dressing? No comparison to the pure olive oil & its health benefits!

Made this last night, except used what I had: drumsticks & thighs.  Also did add extra seasoning (parsley, onion powder, a little salt) to the breadcrumb mixture.  Used 6 cloves of fresh garlic. Turned them halfway through and did turn it down to 400 degrees after about 15 minutes.  They came out delicious and crispy and tasted yummy! Thanks.

Really easy to make & really good. The chicken came out really moist. I added salt & pepper to the bread crumbs & cheese. I added extra garlic. There was still garlic left in the oil so I spooned it out & put it on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly and the way it turned out it made an amatuer like me look like I knew what I was doing. I served with parmesan potato wedges and fresh green beans. Probably the best meal I've ever cooked. Thanks for the recipe! I would only suggest adding a bit more bread crumbs and cheese if you're using larger breasts. I did and the 35 minutes cooking time was just right so adjust if your's are smaller.

I made this last night, and have to say it was fabulous!  The only thing I did differently is to "double-dip" the chicken breasts in the olive oil/garlic mixture and the breadcrumb/cheese mixture....and I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular..gave it a nice crunch, and incredibly moist!

After seeing this in the email, I decided to try it because it uses ingredients I always have on hand. I was easy and fast to make, both kids ate it and we figured we'd probably make it again...then, today, I didn't feel like shopping still so we had pancakes for dinner. My 9-yr-old, who usually loves pancakes for dinner, asked if there was any chicken leftover to eat instead! I was floored. He is soooo picky. Now, we will DEFINITELY be making this again and I had to give it five stars.

This is a great...and very easy...recipe for any piece of chicken. All I had were chicken legs and they were so good! My husband said "This is definitely a keeper!" I didn't even warm the garlic and Olive Oil, so I can only imagine how much better it will be. The best part? 4 ingredients that everyone has on hand!

This was a great recipe. There were no left overs. The only thing I did a little different was season the chicken with sazon over night and cook it the next day with the parmesan and I used Italian croutons instead of bread crumbs. Great I will definitely make it again.

I made this last night with chicken thighs and it was a hit with the 14 year old picky eater and the 70 year old "fancy" eater. I used italian bread crumbs, fresh grated cheese and a little italian seasoning. SO EASY and what a hit. ONly thing was it took a lot longer to cook the chicken as the bones were in.

For a TV/Football snack or appetizer, I used this same recepe for years, but for snacks, I use drumsticks and wings.  Just adjust the cooking time (less), and cook under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end to get the crust a little more cruchy.  Manga!  Don't go too heavy on the breadcrumbs, but add more garlic!  Olive oil is a must and regular is better than EVOH, less smoking.

I cooked this recipe in my roaster so I had to add a little water, which mixed with the juices.  I than added a can of cream of chicken soup after taking the chicken out and making a gravy.  My husband couldn't stop saying how good it was!

I've made this many times, it's always a hit with my son and husband. But have to make sure I flatten chicken breast first and cut smaller if they are too big. Want to make sure meat covered thorougly with breadcrumb parmeasan mix. ALWAYS A HIT, I serve with fettucini alfredo pasta and garlic bread.

Good but needed more seasoning. W/o the seasoning, it was somewhat bland. I added garlic salt, to add to the already "garliccy" taste, after the dish was finished and it made a BIG difference.Next time i will make sure to add the garlic salt to the chicken before dipping it in the olive oil & garlic mix.

This was so simple, quick and yummy.  I had to make a few variations because I was out of a few things.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and just garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, but it still turned out great.  Thanks for the simple yet delicious suggestions for this dish.  :)

This is simply delicious!!!  Made it today and used 5 cloves of garlic for more flavor.  I also used Panko bread crumbs w/ my grated Parmesan cheese (in the can) mixture.  I used a little more olive oil than required which left me w/ a nice garlicky sauce that I couldn't waste.  So, I made some angel hair pasta.  I took 1/2 cup of my salted pasta water and threw it in w/ my garilc/oil sauce and then added 1/2 cup diced red bell peppers.  I brought this sauce to a simmer and poured it over my hot pasta .  I mixed in a little seasoning salt and I ended up w/ a perfect garlic pasta dish to go w/ my garlic chicken.  Chicken was moist and delicious but the garlic pasta? Out of this world!!!

Amazing!! I used Stove Top chicken flavored dressing mix instead of dry bread crumbs and this worked great.  I also used some extra garlic as my husband and I love garlic on pretty much everything.  The hubby said "it's really good!"  Definitely on the quick, easy and delish list! :-)

THIS IS AMAZING--however I made a few changes. As I got home I realized that I didnt have any bread crumbs--but I had Garlic Butter Croutons. So I crushed them up and used them instead.  This was the best chicken I have ever had.  Im not much on eating chicken either.  Very impressed.

Holy Moly!!! This chicken is fantastic! The only thing I added was salt and pepper to the chicken breasts before dipping them in the garlic infused olive oil. They came out perfectly browned, but oh so moist! I will be making this often. Thanks Carol!

Made this last night and the whole family loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 melted clarified butter (ghee).

I'll probably try garlic salt in place of the crushed garlic next time, but only because the crushed garlic was tough to evenly distribute throughout each piece.  I adore the simplicity of this recipe, though.  Definitely saved to the recipe box.

SO GOOD!  I added more garlic (because I'm obsessed with it), minced it with a grater into the EVOO so that the garlic would coat the chicken, which it did perfectly.  Sprayed a very light layer of olive oil onto the baking dish because I didn't want the crumbs to stick to it, then lined a light layer of bread crumbs over that.  Baked for a total of 35 minutes @ 375.  It turned out crunchy and moist.  So easy to prepare!

Very delicious! I made it for my husband who doesn't like garlic and even he loved it. My oven runs hot so I set it at 400 and the chicken was super moist and perfectly cooked with a crunchy coating; I think the 425 would be fine for normal ovens and going lower wouldn't make the crust so crispy. Simple and quick, flavorful while still pleasing to all the picky eaters. Thanks for sharing!

The taste deserves 5 stars but the cooking time and temp should be 2 stars.  425 is way too high for chicken breasts.  It dried mine out.  As recommended, I used butter instead of olive oil.  The flavor is delicious but I recommend baking at 350 instead.

Don't know why this ever got less than 5 stars. Absolutely great! Only thing I did was to use 1/2 cup each of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Also made sure the chicken picked up some of the garlic pieces before dredging in the bread crumb mixture. Best chicken breast I have ever had, restaurant or at home.

Simple and delicious! Didn't even have to tweak this one. Well, barely. Just to let you guys know, garlic powder will definitely do in a pinch, just use a quarter teaspoon less to avoid an overwhelming garlic taste. Love this recipe! Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this is the BEST chicken I've ever had!!!  I used Panko bread crumbs since that's all I had and it was wonderful!  Chicken is very flavorful without any added salt and I love that there is a crunchy crust.  I will definately make this on a regular basis!

Me, my husband and my one year old LOVED this recipe!! Only changes I made were using Italian style bread crumbs because that's all I had on hand and I also used 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, so much easier than peeling and cutting actual garlic cloves. Highly reccomend this recipe ! :)

I wanted to serve chicken over a mixed green salad so I used just one chicken breast and cut it into medallions; baking it at 425Âº for 20 minutes.  The chicken was moist, flavorful but not overpowering, and perfect for a salad.  Iâll be making this again.

I loved this recipe. I recommend NOT using an air-bake pan, and lightly coating the pan with olive oil before baking so that the bottom side of the chicken becomes crispy. This is a keeper!

We all loved it!  Next time, I'll let the garlic sit in the olive oil for a while before I dip the chicken.  It smelled wonderful, but it was hard for us to taste the garlic.

Just made this tonight and I loved it!  I made it as written and used fresh garlic that I crushed in the olive oil.  I used Panko bread crumbs as well.  I had no problems with it being soggy.  My chicken cooked for about 25 mins and was nice and brown and crisp but still juicy and tender inside.  It had a nice mild garlic taste to it.  We enjoyed it very much.  It was a nice change of pace from frying regular chicken cutlets.  I will be making this again.

This is a great recipe and you can do it so many ways, I usually add a little garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture and after placing in the baking dish sprinkle with extra bread crumbs and parmesan I have also served it with chicken gravy and last night I was craving something spicy so I added some creole seasoning to the bread crumb mixture cut the breasts into strips before breading and served with buffalo sauce and ranch for dipping. My family loves this recipe and it's so easy to make.

BRAVO!!! A million-billion stars!
This tastes wonderful with pretty much any side (pasta, rice, salad, etc.) 
It's everything I've ever wanted: simple, amazingly delicious, and quick but not fatty and processed! My whole family fell in love with it at the first bite. THANK YOU!!! :D

I like this idea a lot. It's very quick and easy and turns out a tender chicken. However, I let my garlic steep in the oil for a long time, and just didn't really get a garlicky flavor. Next time I'll double or triple the garlic.

This was good, not the most amazing chicken I've ever had, but good.  I used a tablespoon of garlic, about a cup or so of crushed croutons and a fair bit of Parmesan.  I baked it for about 35 minutes in a stone baker.  It turned out flavorful and moist.  It's a great start to a recipe and would be good for an accompaniment.  The breading wasn't very crisp, in fact part of it came off.

This chicken had great flavor. The breading got nice and crispy. However, I did make adjustments (some intentionally, others unintentionally) :). I forgot to put in the parmesan cheese but it still tasted great anyway. The chicken breast that I got were fairly thick so I pounded them out a little so that all the pieces would cook evenly. I would recommend putting some kind of seasoning  directly onto the chicken because I think it would bring out the garlic flavor better. i altered the cooking temperature to 375. 425 is too high for chicken breast. I will continue to play with this recipe until I get it just right for my family's taste.

This was excellent.  I tripled the garlic and after dredging chicken in half panko half parmesan, drizzled some of the garlic infused oil over it.  Yummo!

This was so easy to make and so good to eat. The chicken came out moist and crispy. Great flavor. Instead of heating the oil and garlic together, I marinated the garlic, and fresh rosemary sprigs from my garden, in the olive oil. Let that infusion sit overnight to blend flavors. I also used half panko and half roasted-garlic potato flakes. Served the chicken with roasted fingerling sweet potatoes and broccoli. Delicious!

I was so excited about the reviews this recipe got, that I didn't really look further than the first 10 reviews.  The only changes I made were to double the amount of garlic (we love it) and added additional bread crumbs and cheese because 1/4 cup just wasn't enough to coat 4 breasts.  Two problems came up: 1) 425 is way too high to cook this chicken; mine began burning about 15 minutes in so I decreased to 375. 2) it was bland, bland bland.  I thought the garlic would give it a garlicky taste  - we couldn't taste anything.  It was like I breaded some chicken in plain bread crumbs and baked.  I would have been better off using Shake N' Bake.  I can't understand the almost 5 star review unless people are just changing the recipe or haven't had flavorful chicken.  I like the idea of the olive oil so that is why I gave it a 2 star rating.

I usually don't review if I've made changes, but this chicken was so good, and the changes were small.  Per another review I used butter instead of olive oil; I used 4 cheese Italian, (provolone, asiago, parm & romano) because that's what I had on hand, and used panko bread crumbs.  I baked it on a rack placed on a cookie sheet so it got crispy on the bottom also.  This chicken was so moist and tender, no knife was needed.  Will definitely keep this as a go to chicken recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful and a HUGE hit with my family! I followed it quite nearly to the T and just doubled everything since I have a large family. It was so great! And leftovers for days afterwards were wonderful as well. So all-in-all, I will def add this to my recipes to use!!!

I used some thinly sliced boneless/skinless breasts and I only needed to bake them about 10 minutes.  I used panko crumbs.  I also increased the olive oil mixture and added some crushed red pepper.  After I had dipped and breaded the chicken, I put the oil back on the stove to simmer.  

I boiled some whole wheat pasta and tossed that with the oil mixture.  

When the breasts were done I put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes to get them a little more brown and crisp.  Very nice dish.

This had ZERO flavor. The only way we could eat it was:  1. Top with more parm; 2. Add "Nature's Seasoning"; 3. Sprinkle chopped raw onions and eat every bite with some onion.  Seriously, this recipe is missing flavor!

I followed the recipe exactly. In a word...YUMMY! I served it with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli with cheese and Mad Hatter Salad (also on this website). Dinner was a real hit. The hubby and kiddos liked it too.

This recipe, as written, is SUPER EASY and SUPER BLAND.  The chicken was moist, but flavorless.  Will make it again, but not as written.  Will follow other reviewer's advice and marinate the chicken in Italian dressing and garlic, then roll in seasoned breadcrumbs and parmesan.   I used 7 large breasts and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  35 - 40 minutes at 425 degrees was perfect. I will DEFINITELY line my pan with foil for easier cleanup next time too!! What a big greasy mess all the oil and breadcrumbs made!!

This was an average chicken dish for me.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought there was barely any garlic flavor (yes, I read the ingredients list correctly and added the correct amount).  I even made bread crumbs using garlic flavored croutons but still thought it wasn't as garlicky as it should be.  If I make this recipe again, I'm adding a LOT more garlic.

No need to rum salt in the chicken before you bake it. The grated Parmesan cheese is salty enough. No bread crumbs on hand? no problem, just stick 2 slices of bread in the toaster oven for 8 min, flip over, then another 8 min and you'll have dry bread.

Very flavorful and simple.  I used Pepperidge Farms Italian stuffing mix, which didn't coat the chicken as well, but we're trying to cut carbs, anyway!  It got really crispy. Definitely a keeper!

Very good. I used corn flakes instead of bread crumbs and added seasoning salt, pepper and oregano to the crumb mixture. I also put pepper and garlic salt on the chicken before coating in the garlic oil. Next time I will add more garlic. Overall, a very good dish, defineatly needs more garlic.

The chicken breast I get are big and thick. I slice then through the middle to make them smaller. I add salt pepper and mrs. dash. I don't like parmesaen so I used italian-style panko bread crumbs. The smaller thinner pieces make to have more flavor and the panko breading is perfect. use less heat, try 400 degrees for thinner pieces instead. Thick cuts of meat to season properly needs to be seasoned and set overnight in a container to get in the flvor and get juicy.

I don't think I've ever commented before this...but I just can't help myself on this one.  I followed the recipe (i used 5 or 6 large cloves of garlic), except for the parmsan (since I'm allergic) and it was incredible! My whole family loved it! My husband said in our 10 years of marriage that this is the best chicken i've ever made--it was crunchy on the outside and perfectly done and moist on the inside.  I'm making it again tonight. THanks so much for this recipe!

Delicious--I used Panko bread crumbs as they add a little more crunch. I also pounded the chicken in a plastic bag to tenderize and  flatten a bit to ensure uniform cooking--  Simple but impressive--I served with Fettucini with Sweet Pepper-Cayenne Sauce from this site.

I don't know how this got to be 41/2 star rating when most people altered the recipe.  I made this following the recipe exactly as written and found it to be tasteless since no salt or pepper were included in the recipe.  I sprinkled some salt on the rest of the breasts after tasting one and hopefully hubby can eat it for supper.

I cooked it exactly as the directions said and this turned out great. I only gave 4 stars since there was def not enough crumbs/parm to cover all the chickens entirely in the end (which is what I was hoping for) and I had to add some extra garlic. Great with potatos!

This was really quick dish which is why I gave it 4 stars. It was a little bland for my taste, will season the chicken before breading next time. Husband loved it.

I was skeptical about this before making it. Seemed too easy- it's ingredients I always had and I didn't think it would stay as moist as everyone had said.  It was delicious!! I used butter instead of oil as someone suggested.  It was moist, and very flavorful (nice and garlicky like I love it!)  Plus took no time to prepare!!  THANK YOU!

Not only was this very simple to make, but it tastes amazing.  I did use Panko crumbs as i like the extra crunch.  My husband asked me to make again soon.

This is such a simple and great recipe!!  As an expat living in Korea, I have to improvise (a lot!).  I substituted saltine crumbs for breadcrumbs because they aren't sold here, and I didn't want to make them from scratch.  The chicken was still awesome- so moist and flavorful!  Will definitely make again- thanks!

This dish was so simple I thought the flavor would be simple also but it was delicious! I added fresh ground salt and pepper to the chicken just before baking.

For the time it took to make these they were great. I made some chicken for my boyfriend and used the same coating for some tofu (as I'm vegetarian) and it tasted quite good.

I  have made this twice now. The first time I did it I followed the recipe exactly. It gets 4 stars for these reasons...1. You need to double the breading in my opinion and 2. I think it could use a little bit more flavor. Therefore the second time I made it I doubled the breading mixture and skipped the oil and garlic mixture all together... instead I marinated my chicken in italian dressing then coated it in the mixture. Turn out AMAZING! The original recipe is good but just too average.

Excellent.  Amazingly moist and flavorful with minimal work.  I doubled the garlic and added crushed red pepper and garlic powder to the breading mixture.  Will definitely make again.

Great cooking method! I marinated the chicken in the olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, & Italian seasoning for a few hours before dipping it in the bread crumbs/cheese and baking it. I think without the extra spices there would have been a lack of flavor. But overall a very good, juicy, flavorful way to cook chicken!

I love this recipe! It is amazing with a mushroom white whine and cream sauce, but since I don't always have the time to do that another thing I do is soak the chicken in a lemon & pepper marinade (don't use the olive oil and garlic if you do this) for 5 hours or so and then bread it with bread crumbs and parmesan. It is sooo good with the little hint of lemon. Yum.

This recipe is so delicious, I've made it many times since saving the recipe in 2007.  Chicken breast is tender, full of flavor and SO quick from kitchen to table!  A win-win all around (unless you're a chicken). If I have a lemon lying around, I squeeze some juice in with the olive oil, but is great as written.

For something so easy as this, it's just wonderful and saves so much time. I thought cutting it into large strips (chicken tender style) worked out better for us. Didn't really taste the garlic so Im going to go by another reviewers idea and add garlic powder. I aslo used panko breadcrumbs.

Made this last night and thought it was good.  My biggest concern was the chicken turning out too dry but they ended up very moist and tender.  I thought they needed a little more seasoning, salt in particular.  I used 2 tsp garlic powder with the olive oil; next time I will use 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp garlic salt.  Overall, very good and easy, will make again.

Very solid recipe. The chicken turned out nice and moist. This is a good weeknight dish but wasn't something I would serve to company.

This is delicious and my 2 year old even ate it without feeding *too much* to the dog LOL My Fiance is SUPER picky as well and he said that its AWESOME! However, the ONE change I made (except for seasoning to my liking)- is I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and 2 pieces went VERY far and it doesn't need nearly as much time in the oven either. I served it with some fettuccine with garlic and parm cheese. overall, was very good combo :)

This dish was amazing. I am not an experienced cook at all and it was easy enough for me to do, make it taste good, and use ingredients that I had at home. I used chicken tenderloins instead of the breasts, which also reduced my cooking time to about 20 mins or so. I also used the grated parmesan in a bag instead of the 'green can' and used a lot more fresh garlic than suggested. The chicken came out crispy, crunchy, and so delicious! Don't make too much if you're on a diet because you will eat it all!

For 1 Chicken Breast, I used 1tbsp oil and 2cloves of garlic, 1.5tbsp breadcrumb and 1.5tbsp of Chesse, bake it at 220degree C for 30min before broiling for 30s. The cheese will slowly melt and coat the chicken. Yum!

Good and easy. I used cutlets so i cooked them on 350 for 10 min and broiled on each side for 5 min. I add a lot more seasoning when making these to add flavor. I use Italian bc's and add more Italian seasoning and garlic pepper to the mix. I also season the chicken with Italian seasoning and pepper before dipping them. Side with pasta and garlic bread. very good!

I thought it was a little bland, even a bit dry.  I liked the crunch of the bread crumbs/parm chz though.

So easy yet very delicious.  I made as directed only I did not measure the ingredients.  the chicken was very moist.  I took the remainder oil and drizzled it over the breaded chicken and then dumped the remainder of the bread crumbs over the top.  yummy

I love this recipe!  I've made it twice now and everyone has loved it. I am gluten intolerant, so I used corn meal rather than bread crumbs, and I used chopped garlic instead of crushed. I also cut the chicken into chicken finger size to make them easier to bread and easier for my toddler to eat.  So easy- and delicious! I'll definitely be making this one again!

My husband gave this an A+ -- really excellent. The only alteration I made was that I sprinkled the chicken breasts with parmesan cheese after about 25 minutes. At 30 minutes, the chicken was perfectly cooked. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the easiest chicken I've ever made, and it turned out fantastic.  I used 5 large cloves of fresh garlic, smashed them with the flat side of a knife, and simmered them in the olive oil for about 5 minutes.  When I read the recipe, it was unclear whether or not to strain out the garlic before dipping the chicken into it.  I ended up leaving the smashed garlic cloves in the oil, and some of the smashed garlic stuck to the chicken.  This was a good thing, and the flavor was absolutely fantastic.  Enjoy!

Our family's favorite chicken. Prep time is less than 10 minutes for me. I have a 1 year old, 3 year old and a very picky 10 year old and they all scarf this down every single time. I always double the recipe because it's perfect for leftovers the next night. I also use chicken tenders since it's easier for the kids to handle. I've also used this chicken as a base for my Chicken Parmesan at a large dinner party and everyone loved it. I serve with brown rice and steamed broccoli.

This was delicious!  I made it for my husband, 3 ear old and 11 month old and they scarfed it down.  I did  make a few changes...Cut the chicken into strips so there was more flavor in each piece.  I added a little seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture.  Then with about 10 minutes left of baking, I squeezed half of a lemon on the chicken.  It really brought out a lot of the garlic and parmesan flavors.  I will be making this a lot!

This is a great and super easy chicken recipe! I had to triple the recipe for my large family; I also used a mixture of boneless-skinless breasts, bone-in thighs, and drumsticks. The chicken came out extremely tender, with a delicious garlic flavor. My family enjoyed it! I used breadcrumbs from some homemade bread that had gotten way too dry to eat...this worked just fine. The leftover chicken was wonderful the next day on top of a lettuce salad! Thanks for sharing the recipe...I would definitely make this again!

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  So many different things you can do with it.  I like to mince my garlic and put the olive oil in a microwable dish and heat for about 20 - 30 seconds to get more garlic flavor in the oil.  Make a great oven-baked chicken parmigiana.  Thank you for this recipe!

Good, but I'm not going to yell about it from the rooftops. I will make it again though, since it was easy and my husband likes whole pieces of meat. I made as indicated and I thought it didn't need quite so much of the oil mixture. We used zesty breadcrumbs because that's what I had.

Very easy and delicious recipe!  I grated fresh Parmesan cheese, substituted melted butter for the oil, used 4 cloves of garlic, and used Italian bread crumbs as that was what I had.  I would strongly recommend lining the baking pan with foil so that you have an easier job of cleaning up.

Flavorful and SO easy! I will make again. I try to use a little less oil though - 1 teaspoon or so per chicken breast to keep the calories and fat down. Then just spread the garlic over that and then you won't waste any. I had 6 oz chicken breasts and only needed to bake 25 min.

This is by far our favorite chicken recipe. I've made it at least 20 times and have loved it every time! (And I am very picky about chicken!) It is so easy to make with ingredients that we almost always have on hand. We prefer the think sliced chicken, with cooking time shortened to about 15 minutes. Yum!

Very good and easy!  I used Italian bread crumbs and upped the garlic.  I baked this at 400 instead of 425 because I was making the Roasted Lemon Garlic Broccoli on this site and wanted to do them at the same time.  It didn't affect the quality of the meal.

I don't usually like chicken breasts as they are usually dry and tasteless.  This recipe is very good, not dry at all with a lot of garlic flavor. (love garlic).  If you don't like chicken breast, try this recipe, you won't be sorry!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but I was short on time so I streamlined it a bit.  After I warmed the oil and garlic, (I made extra so I could saute fresh spinach), I poured the whole bit in the bottom of a 9x13 pan.  I rotated the breasts in the oil, and then I sprinkled the breadcrumbs on top of the chicken.  Finally I topped w/ shredded parm. cheese.  I served this w/ angel hair pasta, marinara sauce, and sauteed spinach.  It was really good,and if you ladled a bit of the marinara over the chicken it tasted like chicken parm.  Will make again!

If you pound your chicken breasts, bake only 25 minutes. I added a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil, and 1/2 tsp of kosher salt to the breading, for more flavor.

I don't know what went wrong, but I made this EXACTLY as written and it was bland, I mean completely flavorless. Thank God for the outstanding risotto I made from this site, or the Valentine's day meal could've been a disaster. I wish I had something better to say..Sorry.

Warming the olive oil and garlice really brought out the flavors.  Yum!  I used Panko bread crumbs for more crunch and baked the chicken on a rack in a baking pan to help crisp the bottom.  This is delicious!

I love this recipe. Everyone else does too. It is really simple to make and comes out perfectly every time. I started adding spices to the mix such as oregano, some pepper and basil.

Yummy, yummy!  Easy, tasty, and fast.  Just the kind of recipe that need to feed this group on a busy weeknight.  I did use unsalted butter instead of olive oil, but I'm sure it would be delish either way.  Next time, I'll bake on a rack to crisp the underside of the chicken too.

I found this recipe on All Recipes a long time ago and loved it!  I'm glad I found it again.  It's so simple and delicious.  The only addition I do is drizzle the remaining oil over the chicken while it bakes to make the crusty coating a little crunchier.

This is good and super easy.  I always like recipes that can be made quickly with ingredients I keep on hand.  We did think the chicken was a little bland, so will season it a bit next time.

I absolutely love this recipe for the ease of preparation to the incredible taste!! How nice to have a recipe with so few ingredients (and most you have on hand).  I dipped the chicken into the bread crumb/cheese mix to get a light coating and then put the chicken in the baking dish.  I then pushed the remaining mix on top of the chicken to coat it completely and get all the cheese on top.  And NO! Don't use green can parm!  Real parm is the best!! :)

YUMMY!  It got rave reviews by young and old alike.  Love that it only requires a few ingredients and ones that I always have on hand.  Chicken was juicy and smelled great.  They all came runnig when dinner was served.  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.

I make this A LOT!  It is so easy and very, very good.  I use this recipe anytime I need breaded chicken, like in parmesian chicken.  I also make it for a quick dinner.  The crust is crispy and the chicken is always juicy!  This is one of the best!

Awesome!  This chicken is so easy and so juicy and tender every time!  The bottom of the chicken is quite soggy so I now sprinkle some of the bread crumb/cheese mixture on the bottom of the pan to prevent this and it works.  I also nuke the olive oil and the garlic enough to warm it and fuse the garlic flavor into the oil.  This is a staple in our home now.  Thanks for the recipe.

This Recipe was wonderful!!! My Husband even said it was his new favorite Chicken dish.  The only thing different I did was drizzle some of the garlic olive oil over the chicken before baking and at the very end of cooking it I added some fresh parm. cheese.

I've really been into using the oven lately because I like to forget about things while they cook.  This was very simple and tasted like it wasn't.  I used Italian breadcrumbs, and romano cheese, and the chicken didn't even need salt.  I warmed up 3 large crushed cloves in oil, and it was plenty.  I used 3 large chicken breasts and halved them.  I added more cheese, but that's my preference.  It came out great.  VERY SIMPLE.  Worth giving a try!  Would be great as chicken parm, or in a sandwich or on a salad.

I did as some others suggested and used 2T butter instead of olive oil and added 5T dejion mustard to the warmed garlic and butter sauce.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs instead of plain.  This made a very flavorful chicken dish.  I will be making this again.

I make this probably at least once a month and in large batches. Sometimes twice. This recipe is so simple yet SO tasty! I usually use drumsticks and sometimes add cumin and cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs as well. Anyone who's ever tried this dish absolutely loves it!

I made the dish exactly as directed. It tasted good, but was a bit bland. I think that in the future I'll add a pinch of salt and perhaps a little bit of Italian seasoning.

These turned out extremely moist and flavorful. For some reason I needed twice the breadcrumb & cheese mix, but the breasts were rather large. I added fresh ground pepper to the mix as well as 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano. Five minutes before they were done, I covered with shredded mozzarella cheese and continued to bake until well melted. This was served over a bed of spaghetti and topped with a garlic-marinara sauce. I have found that lightly greasing or using cooking spray on the baking dish ensures that clean up is a snap!

My son loved it, thank you so much. I did take the olive oil, garlic, and chicken and put in a ziplock bag for about 2 hours in the fridge. I made 2 breasts, so I used 2tbs olive oil and 2 minced cloves. I mixed 2tbs bread crumbs and 2tbs parm.. just the right amount for 2 breasts.

This is one of my very favorite not-a-lot-of time/energy to cook weeknight meals.  I make it even speedier by cutting the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces while I'm nuking the oilive oli/garlic (about 1 min).  I like it in pieces because it's quicker and it gets a little crispier!  I spray the bites w/PAM before I put them in the oven.  I usually spread frozen green beans on a cookie sheet, drizzle w/EVOO, sea salt, bread crumbs, and parm and bake beside the chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

1,686 people can't be wrong.  This was surprisingly good for something so simple.  I added 1/2 tsp.sea salt to the olive oil and let the chicken marinate in it for a few hours and then breaded and baked it.  I also tossed some potato wedges in the oil and coated them with the leftover breading (I only had 2 breasts) and baked them with the chicken.

I just made this tonight and it turned out FABULOUS! I made it as directed but did add a few spices to the crumbs since I prefer using plain crumbs and then seasoning them as I like. Just a few shakes of Italian seasonings, some celery seed and a little salt and pepper. I remember reading a review where someone said it wasn't garlicky enough and they had skipped the warming process. I really think that's an important process and brings out the flavor. It was moist, flavorful and perfect! This is absolutely a repeater.

Per reading hints from others, I added to the marinade (of garlic and olive oil) 1 tsp. celery salt, 1/2 tsp. red pepper, some garlic powder and course ground pepper.  Marinate in plastic bag, if time.  Cover with foil first 15 minutes. Added a little extra shredded cheese the last 5 minutes.  Will definitely make again for garlic urges!

This recipe is simple and perfect for a mid-week meal.  I baked the chicken for 30 minutes, it was moist, not dry.  It is hard to find an exceptional recipe for boneless chicken breasts without a sauce.  Though I cannot say this was exceptionally flavored, it is a huge plus that the chicken was not dry and the recipe is "exceptionally" easy for mid-week.  Plus, I had all ingredients on hand to boot.  This is a keeper.

I'm not usually a fan of baked chicken - it always seems to come out too dry.  Not this recipe!  Only changes I made was to substitute butter for the olive oil (I just didn't have any) and I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with seasoned salt prior to dipping the chicken in the garlic butter/crumbs.  Even my 5 year old loved it.  The end result was a flavorful, tender and jucy chicken breast.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this a few times and it was very good with a few changes. I did add some Italian spice into the breadcrumbs and as others suggested, I used butter/olive oil combination with the garlic (did use garlic powder   once and it still tasted good). It's a great recipe.

I changed this up a bit to make it a little healthier. Instead of the bread crumbs, I used cornflakes mixed with Italian seasoning. Then, I substituted spray butter for all but 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. We are on Weight Watchers and this version really brought down the calories and fat. Very flavorful â will definitely make it again.

Great recipe - I've substituted both crushed potato chips and corn chips for the bread crumbs and it was even tastier.  Good way to use up those last few chips...

Lately I have felt that chicken is so boring, well not this recipe!  It was amazing, great flavor!  Also I used my own mixture of bread crumbs, seasonings, and sesame seeds...the sesame tasted great!  And I served this chicken with the "to die for fettucini alfredo" recipe, which truly was the perfect compliment.  Needless to say we had no leftovers =)!!!

I thought this recipe was awesome. It was so simply and extremely tasty.  The chicken turned out so nice and moist. I think the key was letting it sit for 5 to 10 minutes after cooking.

This recipe was wonderful!!!!! The slight changes that I made were to add a lot more parmasean cheese and fresh crushed garlic to the bread crumb mix and a lot more garlic to the olive oil. As suggested by one review, I did not follow the measurements for the dried ingredients because I did not want to waste any bread crumbs or cheese and it worked out great! I ate with a side of spinach sauteed with garlic  and whole grain spaghetti topped with more parmasean cheese.

Very good! I added some seasonings to the bread crumb mixture to add flavor. I found that using crushed Ritz crackers stick more to the chicken when used. When I use Ritz crackers I like to not crush them completely but leave a little bit of chunks for a crunchy chicken coating. I also added more garlic to the garlic and olive oil mixture because I thought the recipes amount just wasn't enough for a garlic flavor to even come out.

This was delicious.  Thinking ahead ( unusual for me lol), I allowed the garlic and olive oil to blend overnight.  I also added a two pinches of basil and one of ginger. Like all chicken dishes, I didn't overcook it, and it was really nice.

This was a very quick fix, and done in only 30 minutes too! Pretty good. Chicken came out very juicy and tender. I will make this one again. So easy, even a caveman can do it.

Made this as an alternative to the ham at my Easter Potluck for those who avoid pork. GREAT, moist, tasty, EASY recipe. I used "garlic seasoned breadcrumbs." Instead of infusing the garlic in the oil by heating it, I marinated the meat in a ziplock bag with the olive oil and garlic for  24 hours. Good leftover and added to a salad.

The first few times it was OK. . . Then I made them for a crowd and it was the hit of the night.  It was perfect for a party.  I cut and pounded the chicken into smaller sizes.  My family had them as "finger" food, others made small sandwhiches, while others put a little tomato sauce over them.  I made the garlic oil early in the day and let the flavor mix in with the chicken for a couple hours in the refrigerator.  If you can find fresh bread crumbs from a baker, it is even better.  But don't leave out the cheese, it really is what makes it taste great. (also a little hot pepper in the oil also kicks it up just a little)

Really liked this recipe!  I was afraid my husband would complain that there was too much garlic, but he LOVED it!  Very subtle garlic taste.  I used panko bread crumbs because they stay so crispy.  Very good ... thanks for this one!

Very good, not at all difficult to make. I hesitated about making this because my husband isn't fond of garlic, but the taste is very subtle. Definitely needs some salt and pepper, maybe some herbs. Be careful about overcooking--I should have taken it out of the oven sooner instead of cooking for the whole time as it was a bit dry (but still good).

I was a little nervous this chicken would be bland, but it wasn't at all! This is a quick and easy recipe made with ingredients you probably have on hand. Both my husband and I loved it. We made two chicken breasts but forgot to cut the recipe in half, we steamed green beans and sauteed them in the leftover garlic and parmesan, they were wonderful. Will definitely make this again!

This was alright, the chicken came out very juicy, but even after adding granulated garlic to the breadcrumbs it was still very bland.

I have tried breading things before, and it always seemed like something was missing.  I was skeptical at first, but this really turned out fantastic!  I added some dried basil and a little garlic powder to the breading, and 5 minutes before it was done I put some mozzarella on top.  Smelled so yummy while cooking, and my fiancee couldnt get enough!  We will definitely be making this one again...SOON!!!

This was very good!  And so easy and quick to make!  I pounded my chicken breasts so they would cook evenly, and eliminated the bread crumbs, since I'm on the no carb diet.  Once the chicken was done, I used the leftover oil and garlic to sautee mushrooms in .  Yum!!

Was really easy and really good. I think I need to make sure more of the oil is off before I dip in breadcrumbs and parm. I made this with the alfredo sauce (w/cream cheese), egg noodles  and steamed brocoli. Dinner was ready in 30 minutes to rave reviews! I love this site. Thanks

I was skeptical and for no good reason.  This is an awesome dish.  Used additional fresh garlic (cause I love it) & added cayanne & Tony's Season to the bread crumb/cheese mixture.  Also, before I dipped the chicken, I dipped some fresh mushroom slices in the olive oil mixture and baked them with the chicken. Served with salad and garlic bread.  Thanks!!!  Me, my husband & roommate LOVED it!

This is such a quick and easy recipe, and the chicken turns out beautifully every time; tender and moist and with great flavor.  I have been making this recipe for years after discovering it here on Allrecipes.com, and I highly recommend it.  For a slight variation, use Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, I have substituted crushed cracker crumbs when I have been out of bread crumbs.  I also like to pound/flatten the chicken breasts before coating them so that they are thin and bake more quickly.

This is really good and SUPER easy to make.  I can't give it 5 stars because it's not one of my all time favorite dishes, but it comes in handy when you want a low maintenance meal.

Great taste!  I didn't have any parmesan cheese on hand so I just added some more garlic.  I also used italian breadcrumbs for extra flavor.  Chicken turned out so moist, it was perfect.  I'll definitely keep this one in my recipe box.  Thanks!

After reading a lot of reviews good and bad ones I decided to make this recipe. I pounded the chicken and put pepper and garlic powder on both sides before placing in garlic mixture. I also used unsalted butter instead of olive oil. I baked for 20 min at 425 degrees. It was excillent. I served with mashed potatoes and a big green salad. My two year old even ate it. Thanks for a good recipe and a lot of tips on everybody's comments.

This stuff is great!  Kids/wife loved it, served with herb and butter rice.  Chicken was nice and tender, and the bread crumbs and parm worked very well with it.  Will definately be making this again.

Delicious, the chicken was so moist and tasty.  I loved this recipe it was so easy and quick with a great taste at the end. The outside (bread crumbs)was nice and crispy while the inside was soft and moist. Excellent, it was a hit.

Really good and easy.  Husband loved it and wanted to know how to make it and i showed him with another batch how easy it was - he took that batch with him the next day to work.  I will make it this weekend when our boys come down, except make them chicken fingers with some sauce to make it fun for them :)

I make this all the time.  It's the easiest, quickest, tastiest dinner that everyone loves.  (Even my hard to please 17 year old daughter).  I use the jar garlic and chicken tenderloins.  For those that gave it less than 4 stars, well they have to not be following the directions or maybe somethings wrong with their tastebuds.

With a little revising this recipe was awesome, I marinated the chicken all day in fresh pressed garlic and garlic oil(trader joes) and then used cracker crumbes. To top it off put a little mozzerela cheese and a few pieces of diced tomatoes!!

This was fantastic!  We love garlic and we followed the suggestion of another reviewer and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt & pepper and then poured the remaining olive oil w/ garlic and bread crumb mixture over the chicken in dish; husband thinks I'm a great cook all of a sudden!

Very good weeknight dinner.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the bread crumb mixture to add a little spice.  Will definitely make again when I need to use up chicken on weeknights.  I also make bread crumbs from 1-2 day old bread and freeze.  It's great so it's on-hand when needed.

For such a simple little recipe, this made a very tasty dinner. I used fairly thick chicken breast so I did have to bake a little longer. The thing I noticed most about this chicken recipe was that it turned our very moist. Instead of baking at 425 for 30 minutes, I covered the dish and  baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes then removed the cover and baked for another 10 minutes. I think this may have been the reason it was so moist.

I loved the idea of using olive oil instead of butter/egg.  Mixed in oregano, salt, pepper, onion powder w/the bread crumb/parm and marinated chicken for 2 hours in pepper, garlic, and pinch of chili powder.  The chicken came out perfectly for me at 400 degrees for 25 min.  Served with tomato rice and asparagus for a lovely meal

A staple in our home!  I marinate the chicken breasts for at least 2 hours in fat free Italian dressing first.  FRESH garlic is key.  It makes all the difference.

The taste of this chicken is great. Definitely recommend if you like garlic!The only complaint I have is that when you get to the end of the bread crumb mixture, it gets kind of soggy from the olive oil, so those last couple pieces of chicken aren't as crispy. Next time I may use more bread crumbs to try to avoid this.

Very tasty, moist chicken recipe.  I did add more galic and let the chicken sit in the oil/garlic mix for about 30 minutes before continuing the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.  Even my 4 year old and 2 year old enjoyed it.

DELICIOUS..I think any chicken needs to sit in marinade for hours before cooking for the ultimate moistness- so I always sit mine in buttermilk(if none on hand mix 1cup milk with 1TBS white vinegar or lemon juice) for a few hours.  Then I heated the olive oil and 6 or 7 cloves of garlic crushed up and cut up and let it simmer in a frying pan for like 20min on low to draw out the great garlic flavor. I transfered that to a bowl and let cool for a minute then patted off the chicken sitting in buttermilk and added to oil/garlic mixture.  I let that sit for a few more hours and then breaded(needed a little more bread crumb mixture then what it called for and salt and pepper) and baked uncovered in 13x9 inch glass pan for 30 minutes.  Probably was ready in 25min.  Very moist and very delicious.  Not an extreme garlic taste either-just right.
If no time for all the marinating I would def recommend  at least letting it sit in oil/garlic mixture for awhile.
Thanks-will make again real soon!

Unbelievable!!  This was by far the best chicken I've had in a long time.  Just a word of caution, when you warm the olive oil, don't heat it too high or you'll burn the garlic (learned this the hard way).  Also found that using a meat thermometer helped a lot during baking.

This was just as great as the other reviewers suggested!!  It was very easy and fast.  I did double the parm cheese & crumb mixture, and sprinkled the leftover crumbs on top of the chicken before baking.  I usually use fresh grated parm cheese, but used the stuff in the green can for this recipe, which worked great. Make sure you really warm up the garlic in the oil so the flavor comes through!  Thanks for a great dinner!

This chicken is excellent. I cooked it for only 20 minutes at 425, then moved it to the broiler for the remaining 10 minutes, and the bread crumbs were crispy and the chicken was still juicy.

This is not my favorite. We didn't like how the garlic became crunchy during the baking process. I usually love garilc on anything but this had way too much garlic flavor. Thanks for the post though!

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have olive oil, so I used butter, but it was still wonderful.  And SO easy!!!  My boyfriend loved it and so did I.  I added a touch of basil to the garlic mixture.  VERY flavorful!

This was delicious.  I used chicken tenderloins and let them sit in the garlic and oil for an hour or so.  I also had to use Italian Breadcrumbs because that was all I had.  This recipe came out really well, I enjoyed that it was crispy like fried chicken without being fried.

Great recipe! However, I have one suggestion: don't use real parmesan. The 3 times I have made this recipe I have used freshly grated paremsan. When visiting my mother I suggested she make this easy recipe, she did not have real parmesan on hand, so she used the dried parmesan you buy in the green can. I thought it would come out tasting bad, but it actually came out better. This may just be a personal preference, so when you make this the second time (and I know you will) you should switch up the type of parmesan you are using to figure out which you like best.

This has the potential to be a really good recipe.  I found that the time and temperature stated in the recipe were too long and the chicken became somewhat dry.  Since I typically cook frozen chicken breasts at 375* for 40-45 minutes, I will definitely reduce the temperature and baking time.  But I will make it again.

If you do not have real garlic on hand don't bother making this recipe.  I used about 6 cloves of garlic and flipped the chicken half way through.  Very simple recipe for a very simple taste!  Good stuff, thanks Carol.

This was awesome. So easy to make. The changes I made are: let the garlic sit in the olive oil all day, used chicken tenders instead of breasts. Even my 16 month old ate it!

We like this a lot. It is very quick and easy. I usually bake at 350 for one hour though. Sometimes I also sprinkle italian seasoning in the bread crumbs and/or use italian bread crumbs.

This dish was very easy to make and if you line your pan with tin foil you won't have much to clean up.  My very hard to please husband was thrilled with this dish.  He asked me to please make this again.  I followed the advice of another person and used butter in place of garlic.  I also used the minced garlic in a jar and doubled the amount I used.  I served this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil by Dodie Pajer from this website and brocoli spears.  Thank you Carol!

Easy to prepare as most will have these ingredients on hand.  Added some red pepper to  breadcrumb mixture, but would add more next time.  Good, satisfying dinner - added mashed potatoes and tossed salad.  Thank you!

This chicken was GREAT!  Per other reviews I added quite a bit of extra garlic, and I don't think I will next time... it was pretty strong for us and I think it would have been perfect in the proportions the recipe calls for.  The chicken was moist and very flavorful-- I was surprised at that since it doesn't require any marinating.  Oh, and I especially appreciated how few ingredients are needed -- perfect!  I'll be making this again very soon!

This recipe couldn't get any easier! I used about two fresh garlic cloves. I thought the taste was GREAT as well. This is a keeper and I will be making it again soon.

I was very suprised at how easy this receipe was. The only thing I thought was missing was a sauce. The chicken itself was moist but without some sort of sauce, it somehow made it seem dry. So we tried Ranch dressing to dip it in which was all right but I made some honey mustard which turned out to be a better dip for it. While cooking it, I couldn't take my eyes off of the oven because the smell was just wonderful! I will make this again with more garlic and seasoning and use this chicken for other receipes.

We cut our chicken into strips before cooking since we were in a rush. EXCELLENT!!! We all loved these. (husband, teen daughter and 1st grader) We also used croutons instead of breadcrumbs, just ground them up in a chopper. Very good. Give this one a try!

Delicious...I added more garlic and didn't have any grated parmesean but used shredded and worked well.  I would also add a bit of salt and pepper but otherwise a great recipe.

This chicken was AMAZING!! I absolutley loved this! Before supper was over, hubby was already asking me when I was going to make again! I made a little sauce to go over the top of the chicken, 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, black pepper to taste, 1 tbsp. margarine, and 1/3 cup parmasean cheese. Spoon a little over the top when serving, it was amazing! I also served with alfredo noodles on the side. I will definately be making this again!! Thank you so much for this!

This was really good! I pounded 2 boneless skinless chicken breast frist and added a lot more garlic (about a tablespoon of the crushed garlic I keep in the fridge). I cooked it with some potatoes that i let heat up first in the oven. So when I put the chicken in, the melted butter/garlic mix from the potatoes created a really nice golden crust. And it made the house smell soo yummy! The chicken also stayed really moist. I will make this again for sure!

This was delicious! I came home from a long day at work, wondering what to cook, happened to have the chicken in the fridge and other ingredients and presto, a wonderful supper for the family. Cooking and prep time took me a total of 35min.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 c Parmesan cheese, 1/3 c bread crumbs, and 4 minced garlic cloves.  GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is very good. My family are all garlic-holics, so I used a lot more garlic. I had 9 breasts, and used about 1/4 cup of the store bought pre-chopped garlic from the jar. I added salt and pepper to the oil mixture and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for an hour. I also added garlic powder to the seasoned bread crumb mixture. Several other reviewers said that they had trouble with burning, so I turned the heat to 375. I checked them after 30 minutes and they weren't browning much, so I flipped them and raised the temp to 400. I think they should cook at a higher heat, if you want them brown and crispy. The family all gave a thumbs up, so I will add this to our family's menu. Next time I'll try cooking at the temp it calls for. I'd give this 5 stars for ease of preparation, and a solid 4 for taste. Thanks for a keeper!

I doubled the garlic and used extra-virgin olive oil, and this was fantastic! I have also made this with boneless center cut pork chops with a similarly fantastic result.

To add to the many reviews, this is an excellent recipe. I added a 3 cloves of garlic and just a sprinkle of season salt on top. I cooked it a bit slower @ 350 for about 1 hour. Very moist and very flavorful!!! Great Recipe!! Will definitely be added to my rotation.

I've tried this recipe twice now.  The first time I baked it in the oven and the results were soggy.  This DEFINITELY benefits from being pan-fried rather than baked; although it's a bit more labor-intensive that way, the results are definitely worth the effort.  Kids love it, nice and crispy, and I just sauteed it in the garlic (used extra) and oil that I had marinated it in (which I also recommend, by the way).  Just a few minor revisions made a huge difference!

VERY GOOD! This chicken got compliments all around the table.  Because I have a wheat allergy, I toasted some ENER-G tapioca bread and used that for the dry bread crumbs (my family never knew!). I also followed another reviewers advice and marinated the chicken in the olive oil & garlic for about 30 minutes and then rolled the breasts in the bread crumbs and parmesan. I used 1/4 cup melted butter in the dish and as it cooked, it made wonderful crunchy bits from the overflow breading, which everyone fought over! Just excellent.  Will try with pork chops next time!

This is the first "breaded" chicken that I've liked so far. Delicious flavor, next time I'll probably marinate the chicken in the garlic mixture for a few hours before cooking. I made my own bread crumbs from whole wheat bread heels (tastes better AND eliminates any trans fats), and used like 5 cloves of garlic (even though I cut the recipe in half). I will be making this again and again.

Very tastey, but the chicken turned out a little dry.  I'll have to cook it less next time.  I used 6 big cloves of garlic, and the garlic taste was perfect.  The leftovers made great chicken sandwiches.  I just heated and put between sourdough bread slices with some green leaf lettuce and mayo.  Very good.

Doubled the garlic but forgot to add the parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mixture. Still really good. Next time I'll add garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper. Very easy recipe and delicious.

I would not make this recipe again.  The chicken was juicy but the parmesan cheese burnt before the chicken was cooked through.  Maybe putting tin foil over the top of the dish would help keep the cheese from burning...

It was just one of those nights that I decided to throw caution to the wind, so instead of dipping the chicken into olive oil, I used butter. I made eight breasts and added a head of chopped garlic to about two cups of "fresh" bread crumbs. I poured the rest of the butter over the chicken. So darn good! Thanks Carol!

Easy, quick, and very tasty.  I use romano cheese and add some italian seasonings to the breading mix.  We love it.

This was delicious!   I maybe added a little more garlic than what the recipe called for.  Next time, I'll stick to the recipe.  Very easy and will definitely make again.  Thanks.

This was so easy and so good! I used crushed pork rinds instead of bread crumbs to make it low carb. I also used a mixture of grated parmesan and shredded parmesan. Excellent!

This has become a staple in our home.  I add a simple diced tomato sauce and spaghetti on the side and the whole family is happy.  I've also made Chicken fingers using this recipe. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, was this chicken great!  It was so tender and juicy not to mention tasty.  I added a tsp of Romano cheese to the mix and some Red Pepper flakes.  I only had three breasts and I barely had enough coating so next time I will double the recipe.  My hubby loved this too!  Oh...and my total baking time was only 25 minutes!  PERFECT!

We really loved this..only a few changes.  I flatten my chicken and seasoned my bread crumbs(garlic powder, cayenne, cracked peppercorns).  Immediately after taking it out of the oven I squeezed a few fresh lemon slices over it and sprinkled some grated Cracker Barrel Vermont Style Chedder(a delicious white cheese, great for snacking) over the top.  My husband was unsure about the cheese at first but loved it..next time I will use MORE cheese!!

Nothing spectacular here.  I actually thought chicken breast with bone in and skin on would've helped.  I followed the recipe to the letter and tried adding more "oomph" with pepper flakes, but it was just average at best.  I seared the chicken with skin on in the garlic oil, then dredged the breading on the chicken (which wouldn't stick, so I drizzled the rest of the oil onto the chicken, that made the breading stay).  Served this with fettucine alfredo (which was excellent).  Nice meal, but this chicken wasn't worth it (and it was easy to say the least).

YUM! This was my first time baking chicken and it turned out great. I took someone else's advice and added some salt to the oil and garlic...but I could've added more cuz I like my food nice and tasty. Oh, and another thing I did was add the extra oil/garlic to the bottom of the pan (I used more oil and garlic then called for). Okay, one more thing: you can cheat a bit and make it more garlicky by using garlic infused olive oil!

This was a nice, quick and easy dinner to make.  I added some mozzarella cheese on top of the chicken about 5 minutes before it was fuly cooked.  It was quite good.

I used roasted garlic bread crumbs the first time but decided to try a lower fat method this time.  I marinated the chicken in low fat italian dressing (adding minced garlic to it) and then dipped the breasts in crushed cornflakes with garlic powder added.

Easy and Delicious, I doubled the garlic as well, also let the garlic sit in the warm olive oil for about an hour before using it to get the most flavor! I will make this again and again!!!
Thanks Carol!!

In the words of a better cook than I am, "Oh, yeah, Babe!!"  I read the other reviews and used plenty of garlic.  I put some Italian seasoning in the bread crumbs.  I also pounded the chicken just a bit to soften the tissues.  Loved it.  Will fix it again.  And again.  And again.

Great flavor!!  Came out a little tough but could be due to the fact my chicken was a tiny bit frozen still.  I loved how fast it was to prepare though!!   I did add some salt , pepper, parsley and garlic powder to the bread crumb mix.  It tasted wonderful!!

This dish was very good and very easy.  I served it to a group of ten and they all enjoyed it (even the ones who usually dont like garlic).  I used garlic bread crumbs and it still did not have an overpowering garlic flavor.

This was a definite hit in my house! I didn't have bread crumbs,so I substituted crushed up oyster crackers! I also used fresh chopped garlic and added garlic salt with parsley to add color.I'll be making this one of my top five!

it was definitely easy to make, but not garlicky enough, and somewhat dry.  i should have read the other reviews prior to making this.  next time i would put leftover garlic oil in the pan to add flavor and add some spices to it as well.

Quick, easy, good, and I normally have everything to make it.  I prefer to use garlic bread crumbs, however, I am a huge fan of garlic.  I subscribe to Emeril's theory of there is never enough:)

Very good recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Not as garlic-y as I'd hope it would be.  Maybe will marinate with garlic overnight prior to preparing chicken.

I liked this recipe.  I did use about 3 cloves of garlic minced because I like garlic.  
I will definitely use this again.

This recipe was okay. My family actually thought it tasted a bit bland. However this can be fixed by cranking up the seasonings so we will definitely try again...it was very juicy and quite easy to make!

Wow, this is a simply great recipe for chicken!  I put the chicken on a small rack over a rectangular pan so the bread crumbs wouldn't get soggy.  Also, I would use Italian bread crumbs for added flavor.  Really, really worth keeping in your recipe collection.

The chicken has a wonderful taste and stays nice and moist. Although it's a good idea to double the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I also baked it in a 350* oven for aprox. 45 minutes.
It is Excellent....yummy....

This was great! So easy, too. I added Italian seasonings to the bread crumbs for added flavor. I also had some mushrooms on hand, so I sautÃ©ed those in garlic and butter. When serving the chicken, I topped it with the sautÃ©ed mushrooms. I will certainly be making this one again.

This by far one of the easiest chicken recipes I have ever made.  It has a fabulous flavor and is even nice enough to serve to guests, just make sure they are garlic fans.  I think I printed this recipe off this site 3 years ago and have made it lots, just had forgotten to review it!  Love this recipe.

This was very easy and quick to make!  My husband really liked it.  I have made this for several people and they always ask me for the recipe.  I do add a little more garlic than the recipe states simply because I love garlic.  I also drizzle the remaining oil over the chicken. to help make it crispier.

This turns out really juicy.  My chicken breast were huge,  so I cut them in half for the recipe.  Added Tony Chacheres seasoning but made as is besides that.  Yum!  My husband don't even care for chicken but had 3 helpings in one night.

This chicken went to the top of my list.  Absolutely loved it.  It was flavorful and moist enough to cut with a fork. 
Followed the recipe with these minor modifications suggested by previous reviewers:
- used half olive oil half butter
- seasoned chicken with onion powder and black pepper
Next time for my normal portion of 2 chicken breast halves, I will :
- use 1/3 c each seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan as well as slightly reducing the amounts of olive oil and butter
- reduce baking time to  20 minutes then add the grated parmesan on top and bake another 5 minutes.  
-  increase cloves of garlic to 5  
BTW, I buy shredded parmesan then use a mini processor to grate.  Perfect and much better than the "green can".
Thanks to Carol for this tasty recipe and  to reviewers for their  suggestions.

I loved this chicken recipe. Made it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I decided to use more of the bread crumb mix as my chicken breasts were bigger than the average so it warranted more. Other than that it was perfect. 
Just don't dry out the breasts and you can't go wrong.

Some suggested changes. Use a iron skillet,  put it in the oven when you preheat. Add some black pepper or cayenne pepper to the infusion.

Great tasting dish and easy to make.  I used the unused garlic oil and parmesan/breading mix to bread and roast some asparagus.  Putting in the roasted vegetables with about 10 minutes left gave them a crusty shell but soft inside.  It only added one additional dish to clean up but no extra time.  I cooked the chicken for 30 minutes and the asparagus for 10.

We love this! Make it all the time. I use both Panko and Italian Breadcrumbs, and it always turns out great. 

I tenderize the breasts, soak in the garlic/olive oil infusion for about 30 mins - an hour, then in a ziploc I shake the chicken up with the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture and bake it. Serve with rice and steamed veggies. AMAZING. Never any leftovers.

I have made this twice and it was awesome. I put 5 smashed garlic cloves in glass measuring cup with 1/2 cup extra virgin oil and heated it up to hot. Removed it from microwave and let it cool down for a couple hours so the oil would fuse with garlic. Dipped chicken in garlic oil then in equal parts of Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese with about a heaping tablespoon of dried parsley. Lined a 9x13 Pyrex dish with Reynolds non stick foil. Took some of the remaining oil and drizzled a thin stripe down each breast. Put it on the bottom rack in the oven and baked them for 35 min. Fantastic.  The breasts were good sized out of the fresh meat counter at my supermarket. I rinsed them in warm water dried them first. Never use ice cold chicken.

This recipe tastes like fried chicken. I doubled the breading and used shaved parmesan. I baked for a full 35 minutes and my chicken was baked through.

Iâve made this 10+ times now and it is fantastic! Wonderful flavor! I follow the recipe provided just adding more garlic to it because we really like the flavor. Very easy to make with just a few steps to follow. Definitely give it a try!

Unless something is easy to make I don't cook. This recipe is definitely going into my recipe repertoire! I accidentally added too much garlic, but it ended up being a delicious mistake!  I ate cinnamon sweet potatoes and peppered brussel sprouts on the side! Very good combination that complemented the chicken.

I love this simple and delicious recipe.  Impressive every time.  Tonight I streamlined the recipe by using roasted garlic infused olive oil in lieu of using pan heated crushed garlic in olive oil.

I used thin chicken breasts and followed the recipe as written. My sonâs girlfriend was dining with us, so I wanted a nice meal. This was s perfect choice. Easy and delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe. This will be a frequent choice!

My boyfriend loved this recipe. My version was not far from the original. I didnât have olive oil so I used vegetable oil. I didnât have seasoned bread crumbs,  so I added Italian seasoning and S&P, and the chicken was great. But as a side I had a zucchini that I sliced up thin dredged in the same mixture. I laid them out on a cookie sheet sprayed with dry fry. Baked them for 15-20 I min at the same temp as the chicken. I wish we would have had ranch dressing to dip the chips it, maybe next time.

I have made this recipe twice in the past two weeks at my husbandâs request (which doesnât happen often). Great taste and super easy to make for a quick dinner! Make sure you use good quality Parmesan and shred it yourself. The only thing I did change was the âbreading,â which needed to be doubled to actually coat my chicken breasts in it. Just make sure your chicken breasts are COMPLETELY covered in the breading and it will turn out great!

This is so good!  I baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet, thinking there would be enough oil so it wouldn't stick...nope.  Next time I'll definitely use a glass 13 by 9, lightly greased.  This is a keeper!  :)

I made this for dinner tonight. Before placing it in the oven I made sure to thin out the chicken breasts and I also broiled at medium heat for an additional 5 minutes! It was a hit-will make again!

A new family favorite! I made this even easier by changing one small step: put the olive oil and garlic directly into a shallow bowl, and microwave for 30 seconds. This may vary depending upon your microwave, but you can smell the garlic permeating the olive oil & know that it is ready. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Yum!

I used 4 cloves of garlic in the oil instead of 2 because mine looked smallish.  I made this with Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs and fresh parmesan (not the kraft stuff) and it was great.  I did have to increase the breadcrumbs and parmesan mixture to 1/3 cup each but my chicken breasts were huge.  I had no breading left over.  In the future, I think I'll make this with chicken tenders or thinly sliced chicken breasts.   Super easy dish and it tasted amazing.

I would add "spray ban with olive oil to avoid chicken sticking" to the directions. Any tips to avoid drying the chicken?

I quite liked this because itâs a different take on an easy chicken dish. I already had all the ingredients. 

I used aluminum foil on the pan and it did stick, making it so that most the breading came off of the bottom. I will try making it again to see if this happens with just the baking sheet.

This turned out pretty well. I followed othersâ suggestion and did add a little garlic powder to the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture. The flavor was great, but it got a little dry. I would recommend cooking it about five minutes less. Overall, it was pretty easy to put together, I would definitely make it again and just lessen the cook time.

Another way to make this is to slice the whole chicken breasts in half lengthwise so they're thinner. Use half melted butter and half oil and yes, use about 5 crushed garlic cloves. Then cover a baking sheet with foil, put a grate on top of it and then spray the grate with Pam right on top of the foiled sheet. Then double the bread crumbs and the Parmesan (even better with Romano) and add some crushed dried oregano into the breadcrumb mix, along with some red pepper flakes and some freshly ground black pepper.  Preheat the oven to 350 and then cook the chicken for about 20 to 25 minutes, depending on how thin your breasts were.  This will work, too, even if you use the boneless chicken breasts whole -- just use your thermometer to check the temperature prior to removing from oven. I still think keeping the oven at 350 is a better temp than the hotter oven. It keeps the chicken breasts crispier on both sides. I often make a mustard sauce made with heavy cream to put over the chicken if you're looking to jazz up this recipe a bit.  Delicious.

My family loves this recipe!!! I've made it a few times before but this time my daughter was not eating with us so I added Cajun spice & seasoning salt to the breadcrumb mixture and it added an extra kick that both my husband and I loved!!!! Since my family are picky eaters this will always be in my rotation of meals!!!!!

My son is the pickiest eater in the house, and he loved the entire meal. I paired it with the semi-indulgent brown rice recipe I found here and broccoli and it was absolutely amazing. Everyone in the house said it was definitely something to do again!

Great easy recipe! Just a few changes that took this recipe from great to extraordinary....
Double garlic, add 1/2 tsp. crushed black pepper,and 1/2 tablespoon oregano. Heat on very low heat for ten minutes, then allow to cool. (If you can, make the infused olive oil in the morning,and let sit all day.) To the breading mixture of Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, add some finely crushed French's fried onions. Outstanding! This recipe/combo also works well to make chicken parmesan, just use thinner cuts of chicken and top with your own sauce and provolone or parmesan cheese after baking chicken, then put on low under broiler for a couple minutes!

I do not understand why people consistently comment negatively on a recipe based on it's fat content.  It is a good recipe and considering this is not a Weight Watchers  site, it makes no sense that is it negatively rated based on that fact. Maybe they should look into alternate sites to fit their needs.

I have now made this recipe twice.  The first time, I did it per the directions and it was wonderful.  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe as written is that it didn't have much garlic taste.  I also thought the coating could be a little more crunchy. 

I made it again last night and made a couple of changes.  I used Progresso Panko crumbs (Italian flavored) and instead of crushing the garlic, I pressed it.  The other thing I did, on accident, was to heat the garlic in the oil until the garlic was sizzling.  The garlic flavor was absolutely wonderful and I loved the crunch of the panko crumbs. 

This is definitely a recipe that will go into my recipe rotation.

The chicken was very moist and tender, and the breading toasted nicely.  I think next I will add a little lemon to make the cheese/garlic pop.

Had it for the first time tonight. I did a few adjustments (more cheese and bread crumbs and cooked at 415 for 30 min) that seemed to work well for me.
Even the picky eaters in the family liked it. 
As a new cook this was great to get my feet wet with!

I made this when I had some impromptu dinner guests.  I didn't want to do something boring but didn't have the time to do something really intensive because it was a Thursday and I was apparently hosting dinner for 4 men!  I really like it and it turned out great.  It was easy and quick and tasted great!  This is similar to another recipe I've used for smaller pieces of chicken where you mix the oil and bread crumbs together, I might try that next time.  Also I always just add extra herbs and spices but overall everyone loved it!  I'll definitely keep this in my back pocket!

This was very tasty and moist, just be sure not to over cook.  I found this easy to throw together at the last minute.

Simplicity is the key when making dinner on week nights. This recipe takes minimal ingredients and I had most of them on hand. The amount of time to bake is quick, to! If you want more flavor, I suggest adding spices that you enjoy and goes well with ingredients listed. The chicken was moist and not too dry! Kid Friendly!!!

So easy and so good.  I love the garlic infused oil.  Also, many recipes waste breading, but there was the perfect amount of oil and breading for three 6-7ounce chicken breasts.

This was INCREDIBLE!!! I had to use GLUTEN FREE breadcrumbs (homemade... 1/2 cup blended rice chex, 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt. keep in sealed container in fridge) I used 1/4 of that, I also used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and I'm glad I did because the garlic wasn't overpowering at all. This tasted Amazing and hubby couldn't stop saying how good this tasted. THANK YOU!!!

Such an easy dish. I keep the olive oil and garlic on the heat and lightly brown the chicken before coating in the breadcrumb mixture, then bake. So good!! I make this at least once a month.

I made this recipe for myself to enjoy when my husband works nights since he dose not like chicken. I made him try it one night he had off work, and he loved it!! He now askes for me to make it at least three times a week!  I find If you bring the olive oil and garlic to a boil/light simmer for about two minutes  then dip the chicken into it, it has more flavor.  Also try this dish with a nice side Caesar Saled.  I would not change a thing about this dish!!! My husband and I love it!!!!

This came out very, very well for us. Not sure if it was the different brand of chicken I used, or if was this recipe, but in either event my chicken temped out at 185 and was still moist and juicy inside. I used crushed salad croutons and garlic-infused olive oil but I'm sure any number of combinations would be great here. P.S. The cooking time was perfect for the big 8-oz boneless skinless chicken breasts.

Delicious!!  I used butter instead of olive oil and the flavor was amazing!  I also used about 6 cloves of crushed garlic and Cajun Shore Lunch instead of bread crumbs (Shore lunch works just as well for chicken or pork as it does for fish!).  The chicken turned out juicy and so flavorful!  My husband and I will most definitely be making this again - super easy for a weeknight meal - and so tasty - thank you!

I had some high expectations with this chicken but it wasn't all that. Personally I probably won't consider making it again , but that's just me. Try it maybe  you'll like it.

This recipe went into our "favorite recipe rotation".  I was surprised at the difference it made in the flavors just by  warming the oil & garlic (a step that should not be skipped).  So simple & flavorful.

Delicious and SUPER easy - who could ask for more?  :)  I tend to be a bit paranoid about chicken, so I left mine for the full 30 minutes & it was just a bit dry - 25 minutes would have been perfect in my oven.  I'll keep that in mind next time, but it certainly wasn't the fault of the recipe - this one's a keeper, folks!

This is SO easy, inexpensive, and a huge crowd pleaser. I've made it several times and the chicken always comes out tender and juicy with great flavor. I follow the recipe exactly except I just make more of it and top the chicken with the leftover crumb mixture for an extra crunch. I've gotten tons of compliments and this takes so little effort for an impressive result!

I made this following the recipe, but using butter instead of olive oil. 

The positives: it was super easy and quick. The chicken was juicy and tender. My kids loved it.

The negative: it was soggy on the bottom (and not very crispy on the top either!), and a little too bland for the adults. Maybe it just needs a bit more seasoning, but I think the sogginess would still be off-putting for me.

Overall: there are better baked chicken recipes out there!!

I used twice the garlic called for (4 tsps. instead of 2) and let the chicken marinate in the oil & garlic mixture for 3 hours in the fridge first. Both the hubs and I really liked it.

So so so delicious! If you prep as instructed-delicious. If you are ok to alter it a bit then use butter instead of Olive oil. Also I added 1/4 butter slices around the chicken before baking and poured the garlic infused butter in the pan as well. I baked at a lower heat for a little bit longer. Then (at the advice of another review) I took all the extra juice (plus parmesan/bread crumbs) and put in a small pan. Added 1 tbls cornstarch, 1/4 water, some half and half (or evaporated milk). Made a nice rich gravy to put on chicken served over a bread of brown rice.

This recipe is fantastic! I have an idea to get rid of that soggy bottom. Try preheating the (greased) chicken dish in the oven, then when it's up to temp, and the chicken is ready to go, place the chicken on the hot baking dish. That'll give it a nice sear. Might even cut back on the cooking time and give you a nice crust.

Used Italian breadcrumbs infused with cheese.  Baked on convection setting in oven for 25 min.  Turned out well!

I made a few adjustments to the recipe but it was a very good method of cooking the chicken it was not complicated. I used grated and powder Parmesan cheese and I used sliced bread to make bread crumbs out of toast.

This was so simple, easy, and yet very delicious!  I used a different cheese because I didn't have any parmesan on hand, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Highly recommend!

I'm 19 years old and I love to cook and I'm trying to find new recipes because my momma always told me a woman should always have a recipe that makes their guests feel honored and if I'm being honest, I want to have a few of those. Well, this is one of those recipes. I seasoned the meat with some salt and pepper and a bit of Spanish seasoning and I suggest you don't put too much salt because then it gets too salty but this is really really good. I impressed my mom and that makes me happy. Thank you! Xoxo

I just moved into my own place, so I'm basically just learning how to cook.  This was amazing.  It was simple enough to for me to accomplish and it tasted like I ordered it from a restaurant.  Loved it!!!!!!  I'm definitely going to make this again.

Easy and flavorful. Slightly flatten chicken for even cooking. More crumbs, more garlic is better.

This is now a favorite around here. I up the amount of Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs so its a bit more coated and sometimes a tiny bit more garlic and I always mice it instead of just crushing it.

Really good and really easy! I did not have Parmesan but I had Romano. I would lower the time for cooking. I cook ours for 30-35 as instructed. I will cook it 20-25 minutes next time. Will definitely make it again!!

I made this for my husband and made a ziti pasta to go along with it. My husband would not stop raving about it. The chicken breast was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. He loved it as well as my picky 5 year old daughter! I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and decided to stick with the recipe given.. My personal issue with it was the outside was not crispy enough for me but I feel if I were to have made it how I wanted it, it wouldn't have been so juicy tender. Overall I loved it, it will be made again. I will personally add maybe a pinch of cheyenne pepper to add some spice and not to over power it. ^.^ Excellent

Made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it. My family loves garlic, so I added a lot more to the olive oil.  This is a dish you could easily have once a week...also good when you don't have much in the house.

I have a very particular food critic to cook for and he loved this recipe which is saying A Lot. I used butter instead of olive oil though I prefer olive oil tge butter gave the breading a better flavor. I also added tsp garlic salt but that may be to salty for some people. I also added tsp mixed italian style herbs. This was an excellent change of chicken for me for I cant eat read meat and so we eat a lot of chicken

I have been making this same recipe for years but never thought to use Olive oil. I usually use butter and then sautÃ© garlic in butter then dip the chicken in that and then again in a mix of Parmesan cheese and Italian bread crumbs. I top with mozzarella for chicken Parmesan. This time I did not want an Italian meal so I followed this recipe only thing I changed was using Italian bread crumbs and topped with cheddar cheese. It was yummy.

Good and easy.  I used focaccia bread crumbs with a little dried basil and garlic powder.  I forgot to mix the parmesan with the bread crumbs so I sprinkled some on top before putting it in the oven.  Then I flipped the chicken halfway through the cooking time and sprinkled a little more on the other side.  Mine was cooked through after 25 minutes at 375, but the chicken pieces were exactly 4 oz each.  Will make again.

A little on the bland side.  If you coat both sides of the chicken and put in a baking dish you end up with one side just being a soggy mess.  You need to bake on some sort of wire rack to allow both sides to end up with the nice crispy coating.  Otherwise you might as well only coat one side and save the calories.

I felt compelled to write this review.  I am basing it on following the directions with no change.  First of all even after adding more garlic, I could not taste it.  The chicken turned out very dry even without baking it the whole time.  It also had very little flavor.  I would definitely not make this again without changing it up quite a bit.

Yummy-delicious and so easy.  I pounded the breasts out so they would be more uniform in thickness (and larger).  I doubled the breading mixture but didn't use quite all of it.  Think I used about 5 large cloves of garlic, which I might cut back on next time so we don't all reek the next day.  Used seasoned panko bread crumbs which worked very well.  Hubby and kid and I loved this equally!

I made this dish last night using two large BSC breasts. Even though I only cooked two breasts, I made the EVOO/garlic mix and the bread crumbs (as someone suggested, I used Italian bread crumbs) and parmesan cheese mix as directed for four chicken breasts. I had a little garlic oil left (btw, I heated the oil and garlic together in a small skillet on low for probably 30-40 min.), but the parmesan bread crumbs worked just right. Since I was only cooking for two, I bought large chicken breasts so that we could split one for last night's dinner and eat the remaining one, probably, tomorrow night. As soon as I cut one in half for my wife and I to share, I was pretty sure we had a winner. I've cut refrigerated stick margarine that was more difficult to cut than these chicken breasts. No, no tenderizer and no pounding, just two fresh BSC breasts. Because of their thickness, I baked them for more like 45 min. and nothing burned or browned excessively. If you haven't tried this recipe already, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

Yup. Super delicious. Really easy too. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I cut it in half since it was just my boyfriend and I eating. The chicken was so tender it basically just fell apart as you cut it. I also used Italian Bread Crumbs, just added a little more flavor then plain ones would. Paired it with some green beans, made a nice dinner.

It's great that something this simple and quick can taste this good.  I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan (more flavor) and used garlic paste instead of crushed garlic.  The chicken breasts I had were pretty thick even after pounding, so I cooked them more like 38 minutes at the temperature stated in the recipe - 425.  They were perfectly done, and juicy.

This recipe is good with variations. First off, I added my own blend of Italian spices to the bread crumbs... don't forget to add the salt and pepper that this recipe forgot should have included. And I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs... it gives it an extra crunch. You could probably do half bread crumbs and half panko. I served it with roasted potatoes. Next time I'll make sure to serve it with some gravy too.

This is a great recipe .. 
Super easy to make ..
I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed some crackers ..
I also added some red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to the dry mix for an added spicy touch ...
It was delicious!!
I'll likely make this recipe again and again

Used Panko bread crumbs for crunch and Italian Seasoning for flavor. Wow! I love food like this! The chicken cooked to perfection and the flavor was outstanding. Very, very easy and very, very good! I'll make it again. On a Sunday, or ANY day I'm craving that "crunch" and flavor of fried chicken... without the mess, the calories or the hassle.

I read the recipe kinda in a hurry and when I saw cheese I immediately went for grated cheese instead of parmesan. My husband did not complain.. he loved it that way. Next time I will definitely make the recipe the correct way.

I made this exactly as the recipe is except for sprinkle of salt and pepper.  I always have these ingredients.   Chicken moist and very flavorful with a crunchy topping.  Definitely a keeper!

After reading the reviews and adding my own touches to it I ended up with a flavorful juicy new chicken dish being added to my family meals. Recipes tweeked as followed: *Preheat oven to 375 (for easier cleanup I recommend lining pan with foil) *I used chicken tenders instead of whole breast. * I seasoned my meat as if I was going to bake it. *I microwaved a little less than 1/4 cup of olive oil and minced garlic(unmeasured) on high for 1min then put chicken in ziplock bag and poured evoo and garlic mix over the meat and mixed it around and let marinate in the fridge for two hrs. *Whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs 1/4 cup *Kraft grated parmesan/romano mixed cheese (green container) 1/2 cup * mix cheese and bread crumbs together and I added seasoning to the dry mix as well. *coated chicken with dry mix and covered pan with foil and baked for 18 mins. I then removed foil flipped chicken then broiled until desired crispiness aprox. 10 mins I flipped chicken after 5 mins. Tasty, juicy garlic parmesan chicken with garlic red mashed potatoes and mixed veggies and a happy family enjoying a new meal. Sn: base your dry mix off of how much cicken your cooking and how much more of one taste you would like over another. You only need enough evoo to coat your chicken not saturate it.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 EVOO & increased the minced garlic quite a bit.  Heat that in the micro to meld develop flavor.  Butterfly chicken and let it marinade for 2-24 hours. Then bread in 1/2 panko, 1/2 Italian bread crumbs with an equal amount of grated Parmesan. Amazing!!!

Very good!  Kids and hubby ate it up, and hubby said to save it as a keeper.  Served with a spinach, avocado, apple, pecan and cranberry salad with honey Dijon vinaigrette.  Fantastic.  Doubled it all up as I made 6 chicken breast halves.  Will make again for company!

The first time I made it as written except with chicken tenders.  I thought it was a bit greasy.  Second time was with Zesty Italian Dressing and chicken breasts.  I added a little garlic pepper to the crumb/parmesan mixture.  I liked the second time better, but I really think it's because of the tenders the first time and not enough cooking time to get a nice crispness on the coating.  Definitely easy and will make again soon!

WOW when I first looked at this recipe I didn't think it would be that good, but with all the good reviews I thought I would try it. This is amazing !!! It was so moist and the breading super crunchy. It is absolutely pivotal to heat up the oil and garlic don't skip that step. The only thing I did different was cut up pepper jack and put it in the breading mix cause I didn't have Parmesan . My husband loved it I loved it. This is a keeper. Thank you !

There might be more sophisticated garlic chicken recipes out there, but I give this recipe 5 stars because in addition to being delicious, it takes only a few recipes and is a snap to make! I didn't change a thing from the recipe. Was great with a quinoa side dish and glazed carrots. Yum!

This recipe was fantastic!! The chicken was tender and very juicy. The flavor of the Parmesan cheese was not over powering and added a great touch. I used the kind that comes in the tube. For the breading I used Panko seasoned crumbs. My brothers, dad, and boyfriend loved it!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had shredded parmesan, so I gave it a whirl in the blender to crumb it.  I also let the chicken sit in the fridge in a baggie with the garlic oil for about a 1/2 hour.  Fabulous flavour!

Three stars for ease of preparation and readily accessible ingredients.  Two stars for taste. The coating was good, but the chicken needed a sprinkling of salt.  425 was too high for my oven, 375 would have been plenty - the chicken was almost burnt.  I was so glad I lined the pan with heavy duty aluminum foil.  Otherwise I would have had to throw the baking sheet away!  Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews for this recipe...

Great recipe....whole family enjoyed.  To get up to 2 tsp crushed garlic, I had to crush 7 cloves.  Totally worth the effort though. Love the tip of heating up the olive oil/garlic mixture in the microwave!  Did not add extra bread crumbs as other reviewers mentioned....I think it would deter from the nice garlic balance.  Used thawed chicken tenders and reduced bake time down to 18 mins, then broiled on high for 2 mins to crisp them up.  Adding this to our weekly menu....and pinning it!!

Very easy.  I microwaved the olive oil and garlic for 30 seconds or so and followed the recipe exactly.  Tasty and very moist.  Don't skip any of the ingredients.

I like the garlic being warmed in the oil; I just think it's more oil than what I want to use, especially when I'm trying to eat healthier. I was afraid the dry bread crumbs with no other seasonings would be bland, so I used Italian bread crumbs. I still would prefer to add more spices next time, like basil and rosemary and thyme.

I followed the recipe and found that only the coating of the chicken had much flavor.  I may try it again but marinate it in the olive oil/garlic mixture beforehand to see if I can get more flavor to come through.

Melted 1/4c sweet cream butter with about 2 tablespoons minced garlic, held off on the parmesan because I was already making garlic parmesan potatoes. Cooked 4 chicken breasts on 400 degrees for 23 minutes. Came out moist and quite delicious.

It was good, but I should have used a different cut of chicken than I did, the outside didn't crisp before the inside cooked because I used tenders. I will try this again with breasts or thighs, the taste was good and it was very easy to prepare. I used panko bread crumbs.

This is one of the absolute best recipes I have found on this website.  This tastes like something you would have at an expensive restaurant.  I can see where pairing this with some fettuccine Alfredo would be delightful.  I cannot express how much I recommend this recipe!

This chicken was really yummy. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used light Italian dressing instead of the olive oil to make it a little lighter and give it extra flavor. Not that it needed it with the 6 cloves of garlic I used. The mistake I made was using chicken tenders instead of breasts and cooked them a tad too long so they were slightly dry. I only baked them for 25 min but I should have only done 20. I will definitely make this again!

Its a keeper! So easy and quick. I used half seasoned bread crumbs and half panko. And to skip another dirty pan I just microwaved the oil and garlic for a minute. Sad, huh? Didn't make a difference though. Hubby wants it again.

My dad says this is now his new favorite! So easy to make, too. I used minced garlic from a jar instead, but about 6-8 Tbs. Then I decided to add more oil in case the ratio was way off. In other words, the recipe is flexible to suit your own taste. After letting the heated oil/garlic cool down a bit, I placed this in a plastic bag with the chicken to marinate overnight. Yummy and simple! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made this tonight for dinner and these are my findings and additions.  Definitely add 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. I found that it needed salt and a bit of pepper. I will add those next time. Great recipe!! I also pounded the chicken a little. Served it with rice and veggies.

Fantastically good!  I used boneless, skinless thighs because I hate white meat.  Baked about 20 minutes, since they are thinner than breasts.  I needed a little more bread crumbs, I used less than one slice of bread, though.  It was super, so tender and juicy, and very flavorful.  Easy, too.

I thought it was great, however, I did follow the suggestions of a few other reviewers. I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for about an hour and coated it with Italian panko breadcrumbs. It was delicious. So glad I had leftovers because I was craving it the next day!!

This recipe was really easy and very tasty. I made this tonight and my whole family LOVED it! It was the best chicken breast I've ever had. My wife was amazed at how tender, moist, and delicious they were. My two girls, aged 6 and 10, absolutely devoured it. You don't need to change this recipe at all! You won't regret trying this one!

I will definitely be making this again. Had a garlic flavor of 5 out of 10. (10 being very garlicy) I used 3 minced garlic cloves. So I suppose one could adjust the amount based on their preference for garlic. I guess I just really love the flavor. Great job Carol. It was great!

The picture of this looks much better than the recipe.  I added extra garlic since everyone said too add it.  I made this as called other than that. It was not crispy.  More of a wet/dry texture.   It did have a good taste but not as good as expected

This recipe was incredibly flavorful and delicious... I ended up using Italian bread crumbs because that is all I had on hand.... and it tasted great... these also stayed very moist baking them for 30 minutes... these definitely aren't the healthiest way to prepare chicken breasts though... dipping in them in oil and then rolling in cheese... but they are definitely good....

This chicken turns out awesome.  My daughter refuses to eat chicken but will only eat this if I make it.  The only thing is I end up doubling the recipe as there isn't enough for the chicken. Perhaps the pieces are too large but definitely easy and tasty!!!!

Fabulous! First time making it, I followed suggestions and used butter instead of olive oil. My daughter got up from the table when she was half way done with her chicken, hugged me, and went back to finish it. Haha, it's so good!

This was a nice, easy recipe that my boyfriend LOVED. We will definitely be making this one again! It's not quite healthy, but for a once-in-a-while treat, wrap the chicken in slices of bacon or turkey bacon before breading. The chicken will absorb some of the fat and it adds the right saltiness to make this dish even more delicious. Served this with rosemary garlic mashed potatoes and lemon pepper green beans.

Delicious and incredibly easy to make. I did pound my chicken out and then let it marinate for a few hours in the garlic oil prior to baking. I also seasoned the bread crumb mixture (I used Panko) with salt, pepper, and cayenne prior to coating the chicken. It was so moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this again

Very tasty!!! Most chicken I've baked tastes pretty bland to even when I have added spices and such. Very easy to make! I used 7 cloves garlic and I definitely tasted it, in a good way. Will be making this again!!

I followed the directions, but the chicken was soggy on bottom.  Chicken should be turned half way through the baking to insure crispness. My kitchen did smell great.

I'm gluten sensitive so I used crushed Rice Chex in place of the bread crumbs and no Parm because I was out.  I also used bone-in breasts because they were on sale.  No matter...the chicken was wonderfully simple, quick and delicious.

Boy I love me some garlic.  Unfortunately this just doesn't do it for me.  I had more than doubled the garlic in this recipe, salt and peppered my pounded chicken breasts and I still had to dunk my chicken in homemade ranch dressing.  It was moist though.

Made this for dinner this evening - only change I made was seasoned breadcrumbs (what I had on hand).  This was AWESOME and the kitchen smelled heavenly while it was cooking.  Highly recommended and this will definitely be a staple recipe for me.  It uses alot of ingredients that are already on hand, which is a huge bonus.  Thanks!

I used pork because it was what I had on hand. I substituted the olive oil for light Italian dressing with garlic. Kept everything else the same. It was very good. My picky husband liked it as did I (and I am generally not a big fan of the pork chop). 
Very good, easy, and yummy!

This is a keeper.  The chicken was so tender and moist it melted in your mouth. My husband and I both loved it. Will use this recipe over and over.

This was delicious.  I did add a lot more than two tsps of garlic though, I used minced garlic and it was probably like 2 or 3 tbsps.  It wasn't too garlicky at all.  It was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a quick easy recipe - and while it was both quick and easy and the chicken was very moist the flavors were dull (I doubled the garlic and used a strong, fresh parm) and the crust wasn't crunchy enough (I even put it under the broiler at the end) The chicken was a bit greasy to me.... If I made it again, I would skip the oil.

I am not a cook but, this was so easy and so very good !! I used 2 boneless chicken breast instead of 4 and it still came out good with no ingredients left over. Do not change anything about this recipe.

hmmm, I thought this would be better.  It was ok, but actually pretty bland. I used 2 Tbsp of garlic, not 2 tsp, but it just wasn't that garlicky.  I'll try again adding more seasonings to the coatings.

This is my go to chicken recipe! I make it with a few changes : I add 2 tablespoons of minced garlic to the oil and heat that on low for 5 to 10 minutes.  I then whisk one egg and dip the chicken before dipping it in the garlic olive oil. I also use Italian bread crumbs ( more flavor)

What a wonderful recipe. The only change I made was I doubled the breadcrumb and parmesan cheese.   There wasn't enough for my four huge pieces of chicken breast.  Delicious and the chicken was so juicy.  My husband thought it was so tasty.  Will definitely make it again.

Quick and easy.  More garlic!  Also I used Romano instead of parmesean and panko instead of traditional breadcrumbs because that's what was in the cabinet.  It came out delicious.

Lacked flavor. If you make this, you may want to season the chicken with salt and pepper before you put it inti the bread crumb mixture.

This was delicious!!!  I followed the instructions almost completely.  The only thing I did differently was I used Chicken Tenderloins instead of breasts and I also salt and peppered the chicken before I dredged it in the olive oil mixture.  This recipe is going into my actual recipe book for future dinners!

I followed recipe exactly except added more seasoning and onion powder and garlic whole cloves in the oil. My boyfriends response was "this is better than a restaraunt" I would say that deserves 5 stars. I made with box of pasta roni the tomato parmesan and it was delicious I also added marinara and mozerella to make it more of a chicken parm - amazing and easy- make it you wont be disapponted!

I made this tonight and bf and I loved it. I had two thick chicken breasts (1.3 lbs total) that I sliced in half for 4 thinner pieces. I kept all the other measurements the same. I only keep plain panko crumbs (nice crunch!) but I seasoned them with Italian seasoning. 
Also I left the garlic in oil +1 tbl butter over low for about 30 mins. 
After baking for the 35 mins, they were cooked but not brown on top. Turned on broiler for 3 mins and it was perfectly golden brown. 
Easy to make and tasty.
Thanks for the recipe :)

Very easy, but I would cook at a lower temperature than listed.

I made it with the given ingredients, temperature, and time, but I cooked it on a cooking rack placed on a cookie sheet because I was afraid all the oil would make it soggy.  The kitchen smelled great, and the chicken looked nice, but it was a bit bland and really soggy on the bottom, even though I used the cooking rack.  It might be helped with extra seasoning, but it would still be too soggy on the bottom.

Awesome, easy, versatile recipe! I used it with chicken, tilapia, and pork chops and they all came out awesome. I also used real butter and the flavor wasneven better,

I have to give this a 5 because my 6 year old cleared her plate! She's not exactly picky but kind of hard to impress. My 8 month old loved it too! I followed the recipe to a t and served it with pasta. FANTASTIC! Thank you so much sharing.

The chicken was tender, but the breading was a little soggy.  I'm going to try it again and maybe try cooking it a bit longer and flipping the chicken halfway through the cooking process to make sure both sides get a nice even cook to them.

Not very exciting, but good enough for the kids to eat.  I used chicken tenderloins (that was what we had on hand) and the cooking time worked perfectly.

This was as good as eating out, maybe even better!  I did marinade the chicken for a couple of hours in balsamic vinaigrette dressing before preparing it.  I also added garlic powder and dried oregano to the breading mix.  It was very moist and flavorful!  I served it with pasta and marinara sauce on the side!  I will definitely make this one again!

I baked this chicken for dinner the other night and it was a HUGE hit, not a single bit left after dinner!  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and substituted butter for oil.  It was crunchy on the outside and perfectly moist on the inside.  The flavor was amazing for such a simple recipe.  Will definitely be making it again soon!

This was excellent!  I used organic crushed garlic so it was very flavorful.  I also added a pepper sauce from Peru as a side dipping sauce and it totally set the meal off.  Everyone loved it.

This is delicious, simple, affordable and easy to combine with a variety of sides depending on your mood and the dinner guests- love, love, love it. Best of all, in a pinch I'll almost ALWAYS have these ingredients on hand- this is a fabulous "emergency" dinner recipe since it's made with the staples most cooks would have in their pantry. Bravo!

Great and easy chicken recipe! I ended up using Garlic and Herb Breadcrumbs instead of using fresh garlic (didn't have any on hand). It turned out wonderfully! Thanks for the recipe.. Great for weeknight dinners.

This is super easy and tastey! I followed the advise of others and heated the butter and the olive oil with the garlic. I used slightly less panko and more grated parm...I am trying to stay low carb.

One of the best recipes! I made it as a trial dinner with some guests. They loved it! I am making it tonight! Add a little onion powder for a little extra. But amazing!

Flavor was excellent! Bottom crust was soggy so I may try something different next time. Maybe flip it 1/2 way in?? Definitely worth making again.

Absolutely delicious. Being italian we are big on garlic and robust flavors, this chicken was both. I also made a diced tomato chutney to lay over the top, but its great with or without it. I changed the heating instructions from 425 to 375 for 30-45minutes depending on thickness...cannot not say enough good things about this chicken!

Awesome! I made this just the way it is in the recipe. Wow so easy, quick and actually tasted good. As other reviewers mentioned, take note the garlic is measured by teaspoon not by clove. I am definitely making this again,maybe with wings and legs next time. Thanks Carol!

Switched grated parm for shredded and it was fabulous.  Also used half olive oil, half butter. Everyone loved it.  My 4 year old wants me to make it again tomorrow.

Loved it!  I did, however, make some changes. I used a whole head of garlic and added salt and pepper to the olive oil /garlic mixture. Was a huge hit!  Will definitely make again. So easy. So quick. So good yet so simple.

My husband & kids really liked this chicken, BUT I thought it was a little bland.  I was also a little disappointed that the chicken didn't get very cripsy. That said, it was very easy to prepare and the family enjoyed it.

Wow, this was awesome!  Tasted like it was from a restaraunt!  I pounded my chicken thin and cooked it for about 25 minutes.  Very tender and juicy.  Also, I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs for a little more flavor.  I love garlic!!!

I thought this was pretty good, for a simple breaded and baked chicken. I have eaten similar recipes with the bread crumbs and parmesan, but the added garlic oil did give it a strong garlic flavor. I only had 6 chicken tenderloins, so I just cut all of the ingredients in half. It ended up being the right amount. I would bake them on parchment, they did stick a tad on foil.

A good recipe to have in your arsenal, but be prepared to play around with it a bit. I upped the garlic and parmesan, and also added some herbs to the breadcrumbs based on some reviews here, but it still didn't give it quite the kick I wanted. Next time I think I'll use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and fiddle around with that a bit more. I also think it would really benefit from having some kind of sauce served with it. This would probably be really great with a fettucini alfredo or a chicken parm recipe.

I am giving it a 3 because i used butter instead of oil like another reviewer suggested and I wasnt all that impressed. It was very bland. I even added extra garlic since I LOVE garlic. Maybe I am just not a huge fan of chicken... but I felt like this recipe needed some work.

Not a lover of chicken, but decided to try it with some of the suggested modifications from other viewers.  I think I probably should have stuck with the original recipe.  I used panko bread crumbs, and used ziplock bags to coat the chicken with oil and the breadcrumb mixture.  The resulting coating was not that great...it just didn't cover much of the chicken and didn't get very brown and crispy.  It wasn't that flavorful even though I also added pepper and Italian seasoning.  However, my picky husband liked it and had seconds, which is often more telling of how good a recipe is.  So take my review with a grain of salt, I don't really like chicken to begin with and didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I will make it again to see if I like it better with the original recipe.

I made this the other night and it was really good! My fiance loved it too :) I did take another reviewers advice and used fat-free Italian dressing instead of the olive oil... however i thought it made it too salty so next time i will use the olive oil.

Absolutely one of the easiest and best chicken recipes ever!  I use very thin cut filets, with the best olive oil I can afford and fresh garlic to flavor the oil.  Wow!  Prep time is 10 minutes at worst!

I wanted a quick and easy recipe to cook some chicken for salad, and this is perfect. It is good enough to eat as is, too. I used butter instead of olive oil and loved the smell of the butter-garlic-parmesan chicken baking in the oven. Great recipe for something quick!

Wow -this is way better than you would think! I heated the oil and garlic in the oven for a bit while the oven preheated, and it all turned out perfect.  and pretty!  smells great too  - easy enough for a weeknight, pretty enough for company - a real keeper!

used butter instead of olive oil and chicken tenders instead of breasts. true, you have to cut the cooking time WAY down (i think i only cooked them for like 10 minutes) and the crust doesnt brown as much, but the flavor and moistness were great. next time i think ill add a little more garlic (or add garlic powder to the butter poach) and definitely try to use chicken breasts to get the crust crispy.

This was super easy and tasty! I was afraid that it was going to be too much cheese and that my husband wouldn't like it but it actually was the perfect amount. Again, like other recipes, I made some modifications. I did 1/2 cup of bread crumbs instead of a 1/4 cup, I also added Italian Seasoning to the bread crumb mix. It was a great hit since my husband ate every bite and asked for seconds. If my picky husband approves, it was a success.

This is fantastic as is or with Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. Since it's just me and my husband, we use the leftovers for a super easy and tasty Chicken Parmesan. Just put a little marinara on the bottom of a baking pan and top with chicken breasts. Then, top those with more marinara and a pile of Italian blend cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, asiago... whatever) and put in the oven at about 350. Once the cheese is melted, crank up the broiler to get tasty brown bubbly bits on top. Serve with spaghetti and enjoy!

This chicken is simply great! It is good to pair with sides, or even add to a salad. I actually use panko instead of breadcrumbs, and it's still yummy.

It was good, reminded me a bit of shake and bake but it was quicker 2 cook. I used a generous amount of garlic (2+tablespoons) and I softened it up on a pan in o.o. But the garlic flavor wasn't very present, I'm not sure what else I can do 2 enhance the garlic flavor. It was the fastest baked chicken dish Ive made and because I always have the ingredients in stock, it will be a frequent dish in my home. ( also I did put sea salt & crushed pepper for added flavor, before putting it into the cheese/crumbs mixture and it was a good addition).

I made this last night. It was excellent. I followed the recipe; well I needed more breadcrumbs; I baked four breasts, we had two warm last night and tonight we'll have the rest with a mixed salad.  I am always afraid of under-cooking chicken so it often is a bit on the dry side;  this way it was perfect. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

If I could give this 4 1/2 stars, I'd do it for sure. This was very good, but in the future it will need some adjustments. I followed it to the letter (except that I used Italian bread crumbs because that's all I had) and had a few problems. First off, the oil was too much. I'll decrease that by half next time. Also, the garlic doesn't really stick well to the chicken, so next time (even though I much prefer fresh garlic), I'll add garlic powder to the crumb mixture instead OR I'll try it one more time with the decreased oil and see if that works better. Next time I'll stick with the Italian bread crumbs, but instead of 1/4 c. I will combine 1/3 c. of each the Parmesan and the crumbs. I'll put them in a shaker and then sprinkle it evenly over each in the baking dish, then turn them over and sprinkle them again. All in all this was a great fast dish and I'll definitely make it again, it just had too much of one thing and not enough of the other.

This is my husband's favorite chicken dish. Very quick, juicy, tasty, and cheap. I have not found a person who doesn't like it - even the pickiest of my picky eater friends. Three cheers, five stars.

This recipe turned out really well! Here's what I did differently: I also used butter with the olive oil & garlic...& since i could not find crushed garlic anywhere (where do you find it??) I used minced garlic instead...mixed those 3 ingredients & microwaved them until the butter was melted & it was warm.  I also did not measure anything--I just went by what looked right. Dipped the chicken in that mixture, then dipped it in a mixture of parmesean cheese, Italian style bread crumbs, & garlic powder.  Baked for almost 30 min...came out great. I'll definitely make this again as long as the man approves. :)

Very simple recipe. I used thin chicken breasts so cooking time was only 20 minutes, even better.

This didn't have as much flavor as I'd hoped, so my husband and I had to grab some dipping sauces from the fridge (light ranch for me, hot sauce for him).  But the chicken itself was very moist, which is definitely a plus.

Easy to make and tastes great.  I definitely recommend throwing some fresh garlic cloves in there if you got them.

Since you're baking the chicken, only the bottom gets crispy, and the top stays a little gooey. However, this was a hit with my boys.

Excellent. It took me a lot longer to cook and I had to almost triple the recipe for my 4 chicken breast halves but they were very large breasts. I will make this again

Simple and tasty chicken dish.  I used butter instead of oil, and seasoned panko crumbs (in place of bread crumbs).  Didn't measure out the garlic, but used about 6 small cloves.  Also, I found that I had to double the crumb/cheese mixture to cover all four of the chicken breasts.
Thank you for an easy midweek dinner!

AMAZING!!! EASY, smelled AWESOME cooking!!! The only thing I did different was I maranated the chicken with olive oil/garlic mixture for about an hour!! Make sure you use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. Overcooked=DRY CHICKEN! I had a wireless meat probe and it showed the temprature as it was cooking and beeped at 175 degrees to signal doneness; PERFECT!!!!

So simple and yummy! All but my pickiest child (who barely eats anything... sigh) gobbles this up. I've made this many times now and the only thing I add is extra garlic (either another clove or garlic salt). I usually serve it with broccoli or either noodles or rice. A great, fast, busy weeknight meal. :)

The chicken was pretty bland, and the olive oil gave it a strange texture... And I couldn't taste the garlic AT ALL. It's not a BAD recipe- it tasted okay, but with so many other GOOD chicken recipes I won't make this one again. It would be easy to jazz this recipe up with added spices and with butter instead of oil, but then it would be a different recipe!!  I won't make this one again.

Pretty good; maybe my expectations were too high after reading the stellar reviews. It was bland; next time I'll add Italian seasoning. I used real Parmesan (not that grated Kraft junk), and that was good; and I had only 2 breasts, both 8 oz., and the cooking time was spot-on. I used the amount of garlic called for, but it got lost; I'll add more next time. I served it along side steamed broccoli and angel hair pasta with some Kraft garlic cooking sauce I'd gotten for free and had to finish up.

five starts, for sure!!! It was so easy, and so good! Everyone in my family, even my brother, who doesn't normally prefer chicken OR garlic, had seconds! 

I did modify it a bit though. I cut the chicken into strips, used about double the bread crumbs and Parmesan, and used 1/4 c. olive oil + 1/4 c. melted butter for dipping.

This was great!! Tender, moist chicken and my husband LOVED it. I will certainly make it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I had to double the bread crumb/parm mix to get plenty of coverage. WONDERFUL!! Thanks for sharing.

I make this using Panko italian seasoned bread crumbs. The Panko bread crumbs stay crispy. I then poor some of the garlic-oil in the bottom of the pan before cooking. This is the best chicken recipe and I make it frequently.

I was looking for a new way to cook chicken and I found it!!! This was awesome!!! I actually used tenderloins (baked at 375 for 35mins) sprinkled with a little sea salt and pepper, because of previous reviews stating it was a little bland. I like a lot of seasoning so I added the salt & pepper. I normally eat 1 tenderloin, but I actually ate 2 an half of my daughters. WONDERFUL, EASY and FAST!!

Really tasty.  I smash my garlic so that I can remove it after it has flavored my oil.  I dip my chicken in flour that has salt and peper before I dip the chicken in my garlic oil.  I also add a pinch of cayanne to the bread crumbs.

Great flavors but the bottom got a bit soggy. Easily fixed theough; next time we will bake it on a rack rather than leaving it to sit in the bottom of the pan. Will definitely make again.

very good. my husband thought they had too much parmesan, but every one else loved them and came back for seconds. i was out of bread crumbs, but i mashed up some saltine crackers instead (very fine) and it worked very well. loved the way they browned. reminds me of my mom's fried chicken, but healthier and the cleanup was 10x quicker.

This was simply delicious!  I used Italian bread crumbs.  Only one thing could enhance it - brining the chicken breasts to ensure juiciness, especially if they are thick.  Here's the brining method I used:

Whisk together 6 c. warm water, 1/2 c. salt, 1/4 sugar, then add one lemon quartered and juiced.  Place up to 6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves in the brine and refrigerate (covered) for one hour.  Rinse and pat dry.

Very simple dish with little prep time. I served steamed vegetables from bag and steamed long grain rice in the microwave. Can be easily made in under an hour. VERY TASTY. Now on the regular family menu. I also used fresh garlic via garlic press, which enhanced the flavor.

Easy & tasty! I had this while my bf was having steak. He took a bite & exclaimed how much he loved the chicken! I let mine sit in the garlic/olive oil for about 45 mins before I breaded it in panko mixed with a little Italian seasoning. I always butterfly & pound my chicken.

Wow, great recipe and super fast.  A few modifications:  I used 2 tsp. bottled minced garlic mixed with 1/4 c of olive oil (I did not warm it as the garlic was already quite potent) and plain bread crumbs with a pinch of Italian seasoning.  This took minutes to put together and was crunchy and delicious.  My husband is VERY picky and loved this.  Will definitely make again!

Moist and flavorful. A big hit with the family. I did double the garlic and bread crumb/Parmesan to adequately cover the chicken breasts.

Loved this one! So simple and quick and best of all, this doesn't involve a trip to the store for extra ingredients! The only thing I did different was to add more garlic to suit my Indian palate. Next time, I plan to add some salt, pepper and herbs to the breadcrumb-cheese mix.

Delicious and easy!  This recipe is so easy to make.  My prep time was more like 7 minutes rather than 20. The breadcrumbs were surprisingly crispy and the chicken moist.  Everyone loved it.

I loved how easy this dish was, which is one of the main things I look for in recipes. I halved the recipe since there were only two of us eating but I followed it as close as I could and it was great. I've never made such moist chicken before! I think that I need to find a way for my bread crumbs to stick better though because even with the oil I didn't get my chicken as breaded as I usually like. My husband LOVED this though so I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks you so much!

It was easy and tasted ok, but the "crust" to me gave it a rather dry texture. If I try this again I will use much more garlic and lower the temperature.

I made this using SEVEN cloves of garlic, and it still needed more (my husband and I love garlic).  Good, simple recipe.  I liked baking instead of frying, and the parmesan gave it a good flavor too.  Will add more garlic next time (10 cloves?  eek...pass the mints please!)

very good. made exactly as stated (used panko) and it was moist and good.  next time i'll use 1/2 butter for a richer taste and perhaps a little salt but honestly, as is, it's still wonderful!

I have tons of chicken recipes and this will be a new one to add on. Very quick and easy. I also salted the chicken, and doubled the breadcrumbs (I used Panko) and parmesan cheese. I also used 2 large garlic cloves and heated it a bit in the oil. No other changes. The bake time was good. Not dry at all. The only problem I had, which wasn't really a problem, was that they didn't brown as much as I would have liked. Perhaps my pyrex wasn't shallow enough. I just quickly turned on the broiler to brown them.  Just to edit. I made this a second time and didn't like it as much. I doubled the bread crumbs and cheese, which was a mistake. I would double the breadcrumbs but not the Parmesan. It tasted too cheesy and was mushy underneath. I also think I went overboard on the garlic.

I'm only giving this four stars as for me, it wasn't that flavorful.  I think I may have to heat the olive oil and garlic a little longer.  And I think the next time I try it I will add some salt.  It was pretty moist so I am happy with that.

This is a great simple and flavorful recipe. Plenty of garlic to go around because i LOVE garlic.  My husband said several times how good it was.  I did however add salt to the chicken beforehand and let it sit in fridge for a while.  I think it really brought out all the wonderful flavors.  Great recipe!

This recipe was delicious! Per other suggestions, I used more garlic than what the recipe calls for (about 5 cloves). The amount of breadcrumb/parmesan mixture the recipe calls for seems low, and I barely had enough to cover the last chicken breast, but every breast came out great. I will gladly make this again.

Fantastic. The only change I made was to double the bread crumb/cheese mixture, what the recipe called for was insufficent to adequately cover the chicken.   But other than that minor detail, this is definetly deserving five stars.

Amazing!! So simple yet the best tasting way to eat chicken ever! I did roast garlic and put it in Italian dressing instead of olive oil and also made homemade Italian bread crumbs which was super easy since I didn't have any Panko bread crumbs. I love garlic so I did place some roasted garlic directly into the chicken before putting on the breading. I can't stop thinking about how amazing this dish is. I also snuck some white cheddar cheez-it's into the breading and it added some extra crunch!! Thanks Carol for the amazing dish; I will be bringing this amazing chicken to our Christmas get togethers :)

This is a recipe that will surprise you!  The chicken was tender inside, and had a nice crisp on the outside.  Try it & see what you think!

I know I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't impressed with this.  With all the great reviews I thought it would be spectacular.  I had to double the breadcrumbs, and I even added garlic powder and salt, but it lacked flavor. My breadcrumbs also wouldn't stick, so I ended up making an egg mixture along with it.  Luckily I used panko breadcrumbs - at least it was pretty crispy.  Maybe it would be better fried?  I probably will not be making again.

Super easy and quick to make with a great flavor. I used grated Parmesan instead of shredded; and Italian bread crumbs instead of regular.  Will definitely be making again.

Good base recipe but a bit bland.  Needs some extra spices.  Next time I will try a little rosemary and maybe a bit of lemon juice.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs and that gave it a nice crispiness.

I know it's better to rate the recipe when made as directed, but.... I made it with butter and romano cheese rather than olive oil and parmesan. It was really, really good. Great for getting dinner on the table quick!

First off I have made chicken in bread crumbs many times for my family but... This was AMAZING! I Used butter instead of Olive oil. I did split the breasts to make them thinner and this was great to reduce cooking time. I did up a whole family pack of boneless breasts. What I did not need for Dinner I placed on Parchment lined pan and froze them. After they were Frozen I wrapped them tightly in foil an places in a zip top bag. They were almost better 2 weeks later when I took them out for a quick dinner. This will definitely become a stable in my dinner rotation!  THANKS!

This is a fantastic recipe for moist, tasty chicken breast! My husband loved it the first time I made it. What makes this recipe five stars is that its so easy to play with different flavors! I've used it as a base but have tried different cheeses such as Asiago, and have added other herbs ranging from chili powder to basil, to simple cracked black pepper. Each time it's been fantastic!

I'm giving this 5 stars because of how easy it is to make - and it is delicious. I did not have any fresh garlic on hand, so I used 1 tsp of garlic powder to the oil when I warmed it; the garlic was a faint taste, but that's what most of the other reviews seem to agree on, so it was probably about the right amount. I also used panko bread crumbs - delicious!

this is VERY good!  turns out super juicy and tender, and I like that there are no processed ingredients, and it's ingredients that I have on hand.  I didn't have any dried bread crumbs, so I made some fresh ones with some Italian bread I had.  I used a mixture of half butter, half olive oil.  I added about 4 garlic cloves that I had smashed, and let this slowly heat up and cool before I dipped the chicken. I think 30 min is definitely long enough for this to bake.

Great, great recipe!  Simple, yields great results, and doesn't take too much time.  I would suggest lightly seasoning the chicken breasts before coating them with the garlic and bread crumb mixtures.  This may appeal only to those who like their food seasoned well!

This was one of the first recipes Ive ever made. Embarrassed to say I'm a single male that doesn't cook much.. The only problem i had was the breading didn't get "brown enough".. I like my chicken a little more crispy.. After 35 minutes I took it out of the oven so the chicken wouldn't over cook and be dry.. There must be a way of getting the breading/Parmesan mixture more dark? The Chicken was still delicious and very moist..

I am speechless.  I have made so many baked chicken recipes that promised crispy coatings and failed to deliver, that I didn't expect crisp from this.  It was fantastic.  Easy, crispy, tasty ... I made it exactly as stated, and will make it many times more.

This is a simple and good way to season chicken.  I made it with very thick chicken breasts, so the cooking time was more like 37-40 minutes.  Didn't have grated parm, so I subbed shredded.  Also added some light italian dressing in place of some of the olive oil and used seasoned bread crumbs.  The flavor was great, but not as garlicky as I expected.  Might get 5 stars if I remade it with pounded chicken breasts, more garlic, and grated parmesan - try again soon!

A lot of people have mentioned the garlic flavour wasn't coming through when they made this.  Try pureeing the garlic and olive oil together, so that the garlic coats the chicken completely.  I pureed my garlic and olive oil together and added a splash of lemon juice - garlic flavour came through perfectly!

I used garlic and herb bread crumbs and shredded parmesan cheese.  Definitely needed double the amount the recipe calls for.  The dish was Excellent.  Served with a side of garlic rosemary potaoes.  Husband loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

followed recipe exactly.  The breading came out mushy and bland.  The chicken was nice and moist though.  Would adjust and try to get less mush next time

Very delicious and easy to make! The only thing that I did different was add lots more garlic (I ADORE garlic) and used seasoned panko bread crumbs. Had to use more dry mix than was called for. Overall, a very yummy dish... I served this with a caesar salad. Yum!

Incredibly simple, and so flavorful!! I used seasoned bread crumbs and added an additional teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. After placing the breasts in the dish, I sprinkled them with garlic powder and baked for about 35 minutes. They are so moist and delicious! That said, I did not taste much of a garlic flavor. I used 5 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 teaspoons of garlic for five breasts, but I will increase the garlic next time. Nevertheless, the flavor was amazing as is. Wonderful paired with brown rice, corn, and a side salad. I'm keeping this one around for company!!

Yum! This was very good - I added more garlic and used crispy panko bread crumbs. Dipping the chicken in the warm garlic oil really made it flavorful.  Easy and quick meal - thanks for the recipe.

This dish was very easy to make and had a nice flavor. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and let it marinade in the garlic/olive oil mixture for about an hour. The chicken was very moist and the breading was crisp. I did not really get any of the garlic flavor at all (although I added a bit more garlic than called for) so I may add even more garlic next time.

quite good ... substituted butter for oil ... lightly sauteed garlic in butter early in day so flavors would integrate and soaked chicken in garlic  butter about an hour before baking for maximum taste

Excellent chicken recipe! Came out moist, light and incredibly tasty. My boyfriend raved about it (a rariety). Only change was using more garlic because we're big garlic lovers. Grated the Parmesan fresh, which I think can make a big difference. Definitely making again.

I really didn't care for this at all. It took a lot longer to cook, then we had to broil it to make it brown, the garlic aroma over took the house, my husband whined the rest of the night.  The flavor was so-so. I have had better. I won't be trying this again, but thanks for the recipe.

Easy and so delicious. Don't overcomplicate things, just use fresh ingredients and you will not be disappointed! I did add a little salt and pepper, but depending on the parmesan used, you may not need it.

Nice change for chicken.  I did increase the amount of garlic.  But, I still think the recipe was lacking enough flavor.  I gave it 4 stars becasue my family enjoyed it, even though Iwas not impressed.

All I can say is YUM!  I used a lot more garlic than 2 tsps (but then hubby and I are garlic fanatics), cut the breasts into 2 inch strips, cooked for 15 mins and the chicken came out moist and delicious

While I was preparing the chicken I let the garlic sit in the oil and make friends.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My children LOVED it and my husband said he'd like for me to make it again.  Good job!

we made this yesterday and it was exactly what i was hoping for. only thing i changed was we cut the chicken into smaller pieces (mostly for the kids) and added more garlic than it called for and i salted the chicken before dipping. i was afraid the chicken was going to be dry but it wasnt at all. the flavor was very good and the breading was perfect. thanks for a great recipe, i see why so many other reviewers say its a staple entree now

Wonderfully simple and delish!   Have made it twice in one week.  I make my own bread crumbs by drying out wheat bread in the oven (350), and crushing-mix in a little s&p and thyme (or any spice).  Double the garlic and brine the chicken--as Julia Child said "it's foolproof!"  Easy and some good comfort food with mashed potatoes and gravy on a winter's night.  Many thanks.

I love this chicken. I make it about twice a month, and everyone who has tried it has raved about it. I use extra garlic, but beyond that make it just like it's printed. Great recipe, and definately a staple in our house! Thanks.

Reeeally good and juicy! Only changes: I used light margarine instead of oil, minced garlic instead of crushed, and added some extra garlic powder. In the future I will try using garlic oil (now that I know we have it), adding a little bit extra parmesan, and serving it on some whole-grain pasta!

Absolutely the BEST chicken breast recipe I ever made.  We devoured them and hubby said, "A real keeper!!".  He also topped his with Romano cheese and the heat from the chicken melted it.  This was amazing!  I used chopped garlic and smothered the chicken before breading and the taste was perfect! Five stars +++

This is so good. I have made this twice in a week and a half. The chicken comes out so tender. This chicken would also be good chopped up on a salad, or in a wrap. Thanks~!

Wow, this was great!  I was kind of skeptical since its so simple, but I loved it!  It is also good to use butter instead of olive oil and then italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I also like pounding the chicken really thin, you get more of the breading per bite of chicken then.

My family, including 2 toddlers, loved this chicken!  It was unbelievably moist.  I added more garlic and some Italian dressing.  Next time I think I'll add some dry mustard as someone else suggested to give it even more flavor.

Wonderful! Have made this several times now, and it's a winner every time. I prefer half olive oil and half butter. Have tried warming the oil on the stove and in the microwave. Slowly on the stovetop gives the garlic a little more time to infuse. If preferred, season the bread crumbs with pepper and a little salt.

This was a VERY good dinner! I had all the ingredients at home, which was EXACTLY what i was looking for since I dont have much right now...Technically, I didn't have the bread crumbs but I made my own for the first time and succeeded very well. The only changes to the recipe that i made were adding my usual spices (onion adn garlic powder, red pepper flakes, celery salt, italian seasoning, salt, pepper...). I processed it all up and it was delicious. Oh, and i also used fresh parsley. The only problem that I had with the recipe was that the breading started to burn after about 10 minutes, i came back 10 minutes later and it was VERY close to being a lost meal.  had to turn off the oven so that I could still eat. I dont know if this was due to the fact that my breadcrumbs were homemade or may too wet, but still...Otherwise, this was an excellent meal! My dad loved it and rated it as his top 5 all-time meal. and if I do say so myself, thats pretty good!

This was too yummy.  I actually cut the chicken down to big nugget sized and used a bit more parm and bread crumbs to coat.  Its was crunch and so tasty.  This is the best one I have tried yet!

I thought it was .... OK nothing special. I wouldn't say I would never make again but not a definite that I would either. I think it would probably be really good for chicken parmesan as that would add the needed spice that in my opinion it is lacking.

5 stars for taste and simplicity.  I was looking for a simple recipe that didn't require me to go grocery shopping by using things that I already had on hand.  This recipe is tasty and very quick and easy.  My kids loved this and when they ask for 2nd's, it's an automatic winner.  I didn't make any alterations to this recipe.  It is great just the way it is.  (Note: I made sure I cut the chicken breast in equal proportions so that they were cooked equally.  I didn't want some juicy breasts and some dry)

This was delicious!  The chicken was moist with a great flavor.  My husband asked that I keep this recipe.  I used panko bread crumbs and I had to double the bread crumbs and cheese to coat the chicken well,it could be that my chicken breasts were larger as I did have to cook an additional 7 minutes. I added salt, pepper and season mix to the bread crumbs and cheese mixture, but other than that I followed the original recipe.  We had it with pasta and pesto. Thank you Carol for a great recipe.

This is a terrific recipe.  I added 2 T. melted margarine to the olive oil mixture per another review. I think this made it too greasy so I won't do that next time.  I pound my chicken breasts so they are the same thickness throughout and will cook at the same rate because I do not like it when the thin ends are dried out.  Therefore, I cooked mine 30 minutes at 375Â°, not 425Â°.  Perfectly juice and soooo tasty.  The family says definitely a keeper.

This was good but a little bland.  I used plain breadcrumbs, but will use seasoned breadcrumbs or add salt next time.  I'm sure that the added seasoning will give it 5-star flavor.

This was fantastic chicken.  I pounded the chicken thin, used Italian dressing, seasoned the breadcrumbs with granulated garlic and a bit of onion salt.  I baked 25 minutes at 400.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I put the leftover crumbs on the bottom of the baking dish to help avoid 'soggy bottoms'.  It didn't work but the crumbs were yummy.  I served with Knorr's Creamy Chicken flavored pasta.

For how simple and easy this recipe is it sure is good! It is very basic but I think the key is dipping the chicken in the garlic and olive oil first then breading it! This chicken is SO JUICY and that has to be why. I have basically been making the same exact thing for years but I always would dip the chicken in egg and milk then bread it. Anyways it is so good and even my VERY picky 2 1/2 year old son loves this chicken! We always top it with a lemon garlic butter sauce and make it once a week!

Very good.  Very easy.  I used 2 tsp. minced garlic (from a jar) and butter.  The garlic smelled very strong while cooking, but it tasted mild.  I used Parmigiano Reggiano, good grief that is expensive cheese....I've never bought it before.  Anyway, I digress.  I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious and so easy! I served this for my boyfriend's parents when they came over to visit. I followed a few of the suggestions made and they came out so moist and flavorful. I doubled the recipe, but it only made 6 chicken breasts 1) Baked at 375 for 30 min 2) Pounded chicken breasts  3) Used 1/4 c olive oil & 1/4 c melted butter w/ crushed garlic. 4) Heated the oil, butter,and garlic in the microwave 5) Marinated the chicken in the oil, butter, garlic mixture for an hour 6) Used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and Italian flavored bread crumbs  The dinner received rave reviews! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

This was really good and easy.  I put it over multigrain noodles with spagehtti sauce and added some mazzarella cheeseon top. Yum!  My 1 1/2 year old even liked it.

I made this almost exactly as written, just used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead.  It was superb!  So easy, definitely a keeper :)

A favorite here and a regular item for dinner. My picky 12 year old son asks for this for dinner! I have to turn down to temp a bit so the chicken doesn't get too brown before cooked all the way through and I always double the breading to coat the chicken enough for us. I also drizzle a bit of the garlic infused oil over the chicken after breading and before placing in the oven. This is a great chicken recipe!!

My husband makes this at least once a month, only we call it Chicken Parmesan. We always have leftovers because it's just the 2 of us and the leftovers nuke up suprisingly well. The salad idea is a good idea too. We usually melt shredded mozzarella on top (only on the breasts to be eaten that night) during the last 5 minutes of baking and serve with marinara sauce. Yum!

My husband and 5 year old loved this!  I made it without the bread crumbs and used less oil.  I served it with rice pilaf on the side. My little one never asks for seconds but got them tonight.  Yeah!  Definately a recipe I'll use again.

WOW!!! Such a great fast and quick recipe and the items required are sure to already be in your pantry. I did make some minor revisions. I salted the chicken first. I added a teaspoon for butter to the garlic/olive oil mix and popped it in the microwave rather than use the stove top.   Everything turned out so so yummy and the chicken is super duper flavorful.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

This was pretty good for such a simple recipe.  I followed the recipe very closely, except I used thin-sliced chicken breast filets, which cut cooking time down to about 25 minutes (plus a couple more minutes on broil for a golden-crisp finish).  I also used Progresso Garlic Herb breadcrumbs instead of plain breadcrumbs, which really enhanced the flavor.  I loved how quick and easy this was to make and the cooking aroma was lovely.

This gets five stars because easy does not always mean good. This is one of those cases where you can have the best of both worlds. It was easy to make. The taste was great. My husband said we should make it again next week and we never do that =).

This is an Awesome recipe! I do pound the chicken out and cut the breasts into smaller pieces. I used the seasoned bread crumbs. I also tried making this recipe low carb friendly by replacing 2/3 bread crumbs with more cheese, wheat bran and nutrtional yeast flakes. YUM. It tasted almost identical!

Subbing italian dressing for the oil made this WONDERFUL!  I used Newman's Own lowfat italian, and just mixed the garlic in with the crumb mixture.  I also used thin cut breasts and reduced the cook time to about 20 minutes.  Came out moist and very tasty.  Great on its own or cut up on a salad.

My 12 year old twins gobbled this up!  Actually, everyone told me to rate them the highest.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used cornbread crumbs...and it still came out excellent!  Not only excellent flavor, but quick and easy too.
Thanks for sharing.

Very very good. Very moist and tender chicken. I added just a few things to give it a little more flavor. I added some Rosemarie, Oregano, Onion and Garlic powder to the bread crumbs. It was soooo good. Me and my fiancee' both love garlic and this was fantastic.

As a college lady cooking for her picky boyfriend, this recipe is GREAT!  It fits my three rules: easily available ingredients, easy to remember recipe, and leftovers can be used to make a new dish (great addition to a caesar salad).  I usually have chicken tenders on hand and they cook in 8-12 minutes, perfect.  If I don't have garlic, I use garlic salt, but recipe is perfect as is.

Recipe simplicity gets 5+ stars.  It is by far the easiest meal I've ever had to prepare.  The moist chicken on the inside was super tasty and not too garlick-y.  I normally 'bread' chicken breasts in typical flour or cornbread and egg batter.  This was a healthier change and still satisfied my crunch.

I am not a meat eater but even *I* was craving a bite of this extremely savory, garlicky-butter-smelling, cuts-like-butter breast. This is a delicious, easy and FAST weeknight favorite at our house - if it's not in the rotation, I'll hear about it until it's added!

OMG....this is so flavorful and easy to make.  Leftovers are great also.  I used boneless/skinless thighs as that is what I had in the freezer and they were superb.  Thanks for a great keeper!

I just made this for dinner, and it came out perfectly! I often cook just for myself, and it's often hard to find recipes that are well-suited for single portion cooking.  This was quick and easy, and the chicken was very moist.  I love cooking, but am pretty inexperienced, so I'll definately make this again, and also use the base recipe process to try new variations of my own as get more comfortable in the kitchen!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Added double the garlic (no vampires here!!) and tried parmesan/romano mix with the seasoned breadcrumbs for an extra tasty treat.  Thanks for a quick, easy chicken recipe!

New favorite way to make "parmesan chicken".  Have tried many other baked recipes that are not this good. I think the garlic-infused oil is a lot of the key.  Also highly recommend pounding the chicken out.  I also use real parmesan - the kind in the block that has to be grated.  Much much better than the kinds you can buy already shredded in the can.

I thought this was just okay...it was just kinda bland to me, but maybe it was something I did.  Next time I think I will pound the chicken first and maybe add more garlic.

Absolutely awesome!  The only thing I altered was adding 3 tablespoons melted butter to my olive oil and about 3/4 teaspoon garlic powder to the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I used about 7 cloves of garlic.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent.  I chose this recipe when I needed a last-minute dinner idea.  I used chicken strips and baked them for 22 minutes at 400 degrees.  Turned out perfectly.  I dredged the chicken through twice (don't recommend--a bit too oily) and added a bit of seasoned salt to the bread crumb mixture.  It was tasty and juicy.  Next time, I will marinate the chicken in the oil mixture for awhile, and toss in some more seasoning.  This recipe is delicious as-is, and is also ideal for a little personal tinkering.  I give it 4 stars for taste, but add a star because it is so easy and a real crowd pleaser.  With less than an hour from start to table, this recipe will definitely go into rotation.  Thank you!

Sooooooo good! Since my husband and I work a lot, I am always looking for quick, easy and tasty dinner ideas. This is perfect! I had really large chicken breasts, so I only had to use one (there is only two of us). I pounded it thin and cut into two smaller breast shapes. I had italian breadcrumbs on hand and already minced garlic in the jar. I used about three tsp. of garlic (since we love it) and warmed it with butter as suggested by other viewers. I didn't have any parm but I had shredded romano so I used that instead. Since it was so thin it only needed to cook for 10 minutes on each side. Served with pasta, spaghetti sauce and garlic bread. Prep and cook time was only 30 minutes! This is def going to be on my rotation.

Good and easy.  Kind of on the dry side.  I think I may have overcooked mine, though.  It's a very good base recipe.  You can really add whichever spices you wish to the breading.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and cumin to min.  I would make again.

Effortless and very tasty. Instead of olive oil I used 2 tablespoons of butter as another reviewer suggested. This was not greasy at all..read some complaints in reviews. We made this with alfredo sauce and pasta but I REALLY think it would be much better with a tomato based sauce. This chicken would be fabulous for a chicken parmesan dish (or chicken spaghetti)...just top with grated mozzerella/parmesan. We will definitley make this again but with a tomato sauce.It was so easy and allowed plenty of time for clean up while it was baking. I love that!!!!=)Thanx

This was so good!  I was wondering if it would be a little bland so I added some Basil, Oregano & pepper to my Parmesan Cheese & Plain Bread Crumb mixture. I served with the Garlic Dill New Potatoes from this website and green beans and it was a perfect meal! This one's a keeper for sure!

Great for Chicken Parmesan, added some Italian Seasoning to bread crumbs.  Used Garlic Olive Oil.  Baked in toaster oven for 30 minutes, flipped over at 15 minutes - perfect. Next time, salt & pepper chicken first.

I've made this two times now and loved it both times. I followed other users suggestion with the baking temp (400) and it turned out perfect. Use REAL Parmesan cheese and lots of it! :) 

The second time around I sauteed some mushrooms and onions and (yes) more garlic! I added it on top of the chicken in the oven for the last few minutes to make sure it would be warm when served. Delicious!

I'm very surprised at all the good ratings.  This was edible, but not really good.  It was fast and easy, but probably not something I will make again and definitely not something I would ever serve to company.

Was very tasty.  I may have to work on getting the meat just a little more crispy buy this recipe was flavorful and enjoyed by all.  I tripled the garlic though because we just LOVE GARLIC!

Pretty good- It wasn't really garlicky enough for us so I added 2 tbs of garlic powder and 1 tbs of onion powder to the breadcrumb mixture.  I was skeptical about cooking the chicken at such a high tempurature, and while the coating did burn a little, the chicken came out alright.

I enjoyed this meal, but it wasn't quite as garlicy as I was hoping for.  (I LOVE garlic!!!!!!!!)  It is quick, and I usually have the ingredients in the house so I am sure I will make this again and again.  Next time I will try using butter instead of olive oil, as another reviewer suggested.

I made this recipe for dinner for my family and my husband's best friend amidst some home renovations.  It was quick, easy, and very very good.We used at least double the garlic because we're huge fans of garlic but other than that did everything the same. I will definitely use this recipe over and over.

I've made this numerous, numerous times since May.  At times I've cooked it 10-15" longer than needed but it's never been dry:  The thick chicken breasts are always moist with a light, crisp coating (have never had a burnt crust).  I especially like that it goes well with rice, pasta, and potatoes.  (I don't think my husband notices how often I prepare Garlic Chicken because the starch & veggie side dishes are always changing!)  It's a terrific throw-together dish:  No muss no fuss.  I no longer soak/warm the olive oil & garlic.  I add extra chopped garlic, and only a little parmesian a top the breadcrumb coated breasts prior to placing in oven.  Then I add a lot more parmesian 15 minutes before removing from oven.

I loved this recipe. I have always had trouble with my crust staying on my chicken, and with this recipe, it stayed on very well. I did have to modify the recipe a bit though. First, I used crumbled up club butter crackers for the bread crumbs, garlic powder instead of cloves, and grated parmesan cheese. It was so flavorable. Thank you for sharing this recipe

I knew over 1700 people couldn't be wrong. And they weren't! I'm a complete fitness/workout aholic and stick strictly to a "clean eating" diet/lifestyle. Breadcrumbs and cheese are not allowed..However.. I can have one cheat meal a week and this week I happened upon Carol's Garlic Chicken. t's got everything going for it. Easy to prepare, easy and quick to cook, will not ruin your diet and it's absolutely delish. I sliced the chicken breasts in half, to reduce the thickness.. Used slightly more garlic than the recipe calls for,added oregano to the plain breadcrumbs I was using. Warmed the garlic and oil, then marinated the chicken in it until I was ready to start cooking. Perhaps an hour or so.. Into the breadcrumb/cheese mix, into the baking dish and into the oven. It came out perfectly... moist,subtle garlic taste absolutely delish...I eat fish 5 evenings a week and I'm always looking for chicken recipes to enjoy on my chicken evenings.This one has shot straight to the top of my list...Thanks, Carol : )

I love this recipe!  It's easy and good. I make it once a week and even my 2 year old likes it. I make it to the letter with one small exception. I crush one large clove of garlic with the broad side of a large knife using the palm of my hand instead of measuring out two teaspoons. The skin of the garlic peels away easily -- very easy and effective. Tonight I will try it with half butter/half olive oil based on a recent review I read. I'll post the results.

I discovered this recipe a couple years ago and have prepared it countless times since. The chicken gets nice and crispy and the garlic flavor is just right. Don't skip the parmesan, it makes the dish.

FANTASTIC!!! This dish was a hit and I will be making it again. Infusing the olive oil with preminced garlic was a breeze and I used extra virgin oil olive. This recipe was very easy to multiply on the first try. I'm very impressed - thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I used Italian Seasoned Panko Crumbs which made the chicken really crispy. My family really loved this. I will make it often.

This was pretty good. I definitely didn't need the recommended cooking time.. more like 20 minutes but my chicken breasts were pretty small. They came out a little bland.. I think next time I'll add salt to the breasts before the olive oil and maybe put some salt & pepper in the parmesan/garlic mixture. Thanks for a great base recipe!

I have made this over and over and it is a hit every time!! No modifications and it comes out great.  Sometimes I do rub the chicken breasts first in chopped basil then dip in the olive oil for a italian flare.

This was very good. The garlic wasnt over powering, it was really just right. I used PANKO instead of bread crumbs, and i seasoned my panko with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

Good! I sprinkled some shreaded parmesan cheese on the chicken after it came out of the oven. I am only giving it 4 stars because I am a garlic-lover and I think the recipe should call for a little more.

My hubby absolutely loved this! I used the suggestion of butter instead of olive oil and it turned out great. I think next time I'll use a little more butter. The chicken came out moist and I only had to cook it for a little over 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful flavor!  I did not have chicken breasts, and substituted bone-in chicken thighs.  Because of the change in size, I browned the thighs before baking.  It worked well.  I would advise not placing any of the minced garlic in the baking dish, as it will burn.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow! So far this is my favorite chicken recipe on this site! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I seasoned each tender with a little sea salt and pepper prior to dipping in the olive oil/garlic mixture. I baked it for 25 minutes and it was very juicy and had tons of flavor! There was just a hint of the garlic flavor, maybe because I used roasted garlic? It was still awesome though and my son has requested it again for this weekend!

This recipe makes the most moist and flavorful chicken! And it was so easy. I wanted to make a nice meal for myself tonight after a busy day but I didn't have much on hand. The ingredients for this recipe are always on hand, which is great! I will be making this at least once a week from now on! I didn't change much either. I subbed romano cheese for parmasan (I always use romano instead), and I also added salt, pepper, and some dried basil to the breadcrumbs. Even without the changes, I know it would have been fantastic. Thank you for this! :)

I have a lot of trouble with new recipes because my kids are really picky, but this one was a hit! My kids were coming back for seconds before I got my first plate made! I fixed some spicy roasted potatoes on the side - Great!!

Pretty good, lacked a little flavor, as someone else stated.  Next time I will add other spices to the bread crumb mixture.

Added extra garlic and some italian seasoning and still came out a little bland.  Will continue my search for a great baked chicken dish.

I love chicken, garlic, and Parmesan so this was the perfect recipe for me!  I think next time I'll use a little more Parmesan and breadcrumbs though.

Really easy to make and tasted great.  I used boneless chicken breasts and cut them into strips.  They did smoke a little in the oven because of the oil but we just cracked a window.  Very good, will make again.

This is the MOST requested chicken dish from my kids!! I have tried MANY other chicken recipes (with corn flakes, etc.), but this by far is one of the BEST!!  Not only is it QUICK & EASY, but it is SO flavorful and we have even used leftovers to make chicken parmigiania with spaghetti or subs, and even in salads. VERY VERSATILE recipe and always YUMMY!! Thank you for this recipe!!

Amazing! Convenient ingredients and delicious flavor.  This has become a Sunday night favorite along with baked fries. For something different I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and serve with various sauces like honey mustard, BBQ, and ranch.

This is so easy and very good. It goes well with pasta -topped with Tomato Cream Sauce for Pasta- from this website, and a green salad. On its own it's good, although seems like it's missing something to enhance the garlic flavor. My husband and both boys ate it, so it gets at least 4 stars!

This was ok. The chicken came out very moist, but I found the flavour a little on the bland side. Next time I'd try seasoned crumbs, and maybe some pepper.

The chicken was very tender and I love garlic, but I think more flavor would have made it better.  It is worth trying, just not our favorite!

This was the very first recipe I tried on this website. I almost never cook but it was so easy and the chicken came out great! I would suggest a more detailed instruction ( Is it garlic powder or cloves?) just because I'm sure there are people who, like me, have never cooked and wouldn't know. Overall though I would do it again with some tweaks to the recipe =)

This was so easy and very tasty. I roasted garlic and mixed that with the olive oil. I let the chicken sit in that mixture for about 3 hours before adding the bread crumb mixture and baking.  The roasted garlic gave a really nice flavor. The chicken was also very tender and moist.

This is FANTASTIC!  The only thing it needed was a pinch of salt, but then again, I'm a saltaholic anyway.  :)  Perfect as is--I didn't substitute anything.  Even my 3 year old ate it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  (It's really easy, too!)

Excellent! Destined to become part of our dinner rotation! The only thing I had to change were the bread crumbs. I didn't have any on hand so I just put a few scoops of Earth Grains Shredded Herb stuffing in a ziploc baggy and ran over it a few times with the rolling pin smashing the dried stuffing and viola! bread crumbs! I think this made the dish a little saltier than it would have normally been, but that was my doing, and besides it didn't change the flavor that much. I also only did three pieces of chicken and ended up using 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of P.cheese and had no breading left over. It was a huge hit served with pasta smothered in alfredo sauce and a salad of mixed greens. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

I made this last night-it's fast, simple and scrummy! It started to brown early when I 1st put it in the oven which made me a little nervous, but it didn't burn-yay! Also the cooking time is SPOT ON; my chicken was perfectly cooked and so tender. Thanks guys!

This could not be easier and is even somewhat healthy. I actually let the chicken breasts sit in the infused oil for about five hours before making and it still was not overpoweringly garlicy. It's a really good recipe that I think just about anyone would enjoy.

I read the recipe wrong and didn't warm the garlic and the olive oil. Instead I put the olive oil and garlic in a zip lock bag and let the chicken marinate in the mixture in the refrigerator until I was ready to use it. Preparation couldn't have been easier. I wasn't sure my 9 year old son would like it so I cut one of the breasts up to share with him and he ate it all up before I could have any.

This was a good chicken recipe.  Very easy.  I had some Garlic & Herb Parmesan on hand and used that.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe box.  Next time I think I'm going to use the Italian bread crumbs as well.  My husband even liked this chicken and he's very hard to please.

This was incredible! I added pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and a little extra cheese. I brushed the oil on and coated it with the breadcrumb mixture, then popped it into the oven for 30 minutes. Turned out great!

This recipe was easy to make and the chicken had a great texture. My breadcrumbs didn't get quite crunchy, so maybe I would turn down the oven next time. The garlic flavor isn't strong, so add some garlic powder to the crumb mixture for more flavor.

SOOO good and SOOO easy!! The second time making it, I did use a little extra  garlic, turned the chicken 1/2 way through cooking and after removing chicken from baking dish, I poured about 1/2 c. chicken broth (with a tsp. olive oil and some parsley added) into pan to loosen up and get the flavor from the breadcrumbs left and then poured slightly over chicken. All six of us preferred the chicken with that little added moistness.

This recipe was very good!!  very easy to prepare. I added a TBL spoon of flour to the dry mixure.  I found it browned up better and the breading stuck to the chicken better.

this is a real treat and so so easy.  I've made this with butter instead of oil and Cheddar instead of Parm...but this worked great for me on chicken strips for a really fast meal.  A little bbq sauce and my boy ate it right up!

This is very easy and delicious!  Perfect for busy weeknight dinner!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again, however I would change the original recipe a little bit next time to taste more garlic.  The recipe is still good just as is though.

Easy and crispy from the oven!  I used legs instead of breasts and marinated them all day in the olive oil and garlic. Cooked on 400 instead of 425 because I had something else in the oven as well. They  were done in 40 minutes and I turned them after 30. I also sprayed the pan because I didn't want them to stick.

This recipe was quite bland. The garlic was barely noticable. I rarely add salt to my cooking, but I would have added it here, for some flavor.

Since there's 1456 reviews of this recipe I guess I'll just add my 2 cents worth.  It came out moist and delicious.  Crispy on the outside but I only had a bone in chicken breast with skin and so I'm cooking it for 45 minutes.  Still tasted great.

I really liked this recipe a lot! I just made it last week. Instead of crushed garlic I used this garlic in a jar that is packed in olive oil. I think this may have slightly reduced the flavor, though. But I really like it and will definitely make it again, maybe this week!

I'm not really sure what I was expecting with this recipe...certainly not the flavor I got!  Wow!!  I think heating the oil with the garlic is key.  I used dried shaved garlic and heated the mix in the microwave.  This was fantastic chicken, very easy, and so flavorful.  I loved it.  Thank you for a brand new staple in our house!

This was average. No outstanding flavours or very moist chicken. My breasts were dry and I didn't eat all mine because of it. The crumb held together fine, but the taste was average -- what you'd expect from garlic crumbed chicken baked in an oven.

When I first made these I made enough to freeze for another time.  They too were just as good as the first time around.  Again, Thanks.

This was AWESOME!! I didn't have Olive oil, but I followed some other suggestion for using Italian Salad Dressing and let the chicken marinate for a few hours. I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs with the parmasan cheese. As an after thought I served this over Lipton's Pasta Sides Parmasan Noodles. Together this was the best chicken dish I have had in awhile. I'm going to search for a better side...but I don't think that we went wrong. The chicken had so much savory flavor!! BUT it was still light and tasty that that the pasta wasn't too much. Thanks for this, it's a true keeper!!

DELICIOUS!!  My 4 kids are ages 7-13 and they all LOVED it and wanted seconds ~ even my VERY picky 9 year old son! My hubby and I enjoyed it as well.  Very tender!  If you're a family who loves garlic, add more, otherwise, use what it calls for.  I printed this one and will use it over and over!! THANKS!!

I got this in my inbox yesterday and I made it last night!  Super easy - I felt like we were having a really special dinner that took just minutes to prepare.  I always use seasoned bread crumbs and I did add some garlic powder to the bread mixture.  This will be my go-to recipe for breading chicken nuggets, etc. for kids too.

This is way better than "Shake and Bake", yet so easy!  I used skinless chicken drumsticks and baked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  It smells way more like garlic than it tastes, but it is great.

I thought this would be bland, but it was so tasty. I served this with ultra garlicky mashed potatoes, so the mild garlic taste was great in comparison. Mine was ready in 30 minutes, and I also flattened the breasts out first and used Italian bread crumbs. I will make this again and again!

This was easy and very tasty. I made it with Italian bread crumbs and shredded parmesan instead of grated. I also pounded the chicken a bit and pan fried it before baking so it was sure to cook all the way through - everyone was wild for it!

I really wanted to like this recipe, because it IS easy, but it's just nothing special. And I even doubled the garlic, per previous reviews, and also added garlic salt, oregano, and extra parmesan to the bread crumb mix.  It is indeed moist, but despite all my efforts, it just tasted like bland, baked chicken.  I honestly can't believe it got such high reviews!  BEWARE:  If a recipe seems too easy to be true, it probably is!  : )

Chicken was good - better than I expected.  I added some seasonings to the bread crumbs.  Flavor could still use some tweaking - will adjust next time.  My husband rated it an 8 out of 10.

Very good and very easy.  I always have the ingredients on-hand, so its a quick meal to prepare when nothing else has been planned.  I always have the individually frozen chicken breasts from the local "warehouse store" in the freezer, so I can throw it all together when I get home from work.  The only change I make is more garlic and a healthy dose of ground pepper.  We will definitely make this again.

Really good and easy. Used butter instead of olive oil and chicken tenders instead of breasts. Added a little oregano and basil. Next time will serve over angel hair and top with pasta sauce. YUM

Relative to the amount of work involved, this is an awesome recipe. My prep time was maybe 20 minutes - for the chicken, the steamed brocolli I served with it, and all the veggies I cut up for a salad. I used half a head of garlic (put it thru the food processor), marinated the chicken for about an hour, and seasoned them on both sides with salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning. I used real fresh parmesan and it was fine. It wasn't the most exciting recipe, but it was good and so easy.

I didn't like the olive oil. So I used 1/4 cup of butter, and two heaping spoonfuls of Garlic. I melted the butter and the garlic on the stove, and then dip the chicken in the butter mixture, and then the bread crumbs. Then bake it.

This was pretty good...I'm not a big fan of garlic but thought I'd give it a try...I used real garlic that I pressed and olive oil...seasoned bread crumbs and I forgot the parmesan cheese...I don't think it would nake a difference, but when I make this again I'll try it with the cheese!  All in all this was good, boyfriend liked it and I would make again.

This was simple and quick.  It was moist, tender and absolutely delicious!  It smells so good while it is cooking.  My boyfriend was skeptical at first because I was using him as a guinea pig since I had never made this before.  He loved it and went back for seconds.  I used the Italian seasoned bread crumbs which I think made the difference.  Crispy outside and juicy and tender inside.  The trick is not to let the chicken overcook or it could beceome dry.  Thanks for the recipe...I will use again and again for the simplicity.

Great Recipe!  We make this every few weeks now and follow the recipe exactly.  It's actually fairly healthy for a "fried" chicken kind of feeling.  We Love this Recipe...Super easy!!!  Thanks!  Definitely a 30 minute meal!

This recipe is fantastic! It has a nice light flavor though I soaked my garlic in the olive oil for about 3hrs before I used it. Best of all it is easy to make and takes about 45min from the time you start your prep to the time it ends up on your dining room table.

I made this again last night for the second time this month. This time I used it for a chicken parmesan dish. I made the Garlic Chicken as advised, and then in the last 5 minutes I added mozzarella on top. Itâs such a great recipe, it even taste  great in other dishes!

This was good and so easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand.  I've made a similar dish before in which you dip the chicken breasts in a canola oil/garlic mixture and then cracker crumbs/finely shredded cheddar mixture...both versions are great and will stay in my "chicken rotation."

My friend loved this recipe! I preheated the oven to 400 degrees, put tin foil for the first 15 minutes and baked it for 28 minutes! The chicken came out juicy, moist and incredibly tender. Yumyum! Also, I added garlic salt and some pepper to the garlic and oil mixture.

This was very good and easy too!  We couldn't taste the garlic (I used the minced garlic in the little glass jar from the store) but we loved the chicken anyway.  I'm a garlic fan and use that garlic all the time with good results, maybe it's because it was the bottom of the jar.  Who knows, next time I'll either use fresh garlic or I'll crush it a little with a fork to release the flavor.  Maybe I just didn't heat the mixture long enough.  Loved the recipe anyway and will definetly be making it again...garlic flavor will only add a star to an already awesome recipe!  Thanks Carol! BTW--I was going to give it 4 stars due to the garlic thing, but my VERY finicky 22 yo ate with us and said, "Hey Momma, I forgot you could cook so good." That was the 5th star for me!!  If I get it right next time and taste the garlic--It will be a 6 star recipe at my house.

The chicken was very flavorful and juicy! I had thicker cuts so it took longer to fry but it was worth the wait! No complaints from the kids. (That alone deserves five stars!) Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was absolutely delicious!  We only made one change to the dish; using pre-diced garlic from a jar instead of fresh.  My husband and I will definitely make this again!!

Wow!!! This was wonderful! The chicken came out so golden brown, it tasted great and my whole house smelled soooo good while this was baking. My husband loved it too. I will definitely make this again and again. The only thing I did a bit differently is that I used garlic flavored olive oil. You can find it in the supermarket. It just cut out the one step of infusing the chopped garlic into the olive oil. You must all try this recipe!

Very good-even my picky husband enjoyed it! Was not dry at all but I also lowered the heat to 400 and cooked for 30 minutes.  I covered the chicken for the first 15 minutes of cooking time. Good weeknight meal.

This just wasn't for me.  I found it very bland.  I should have tried some seasonings but I wanted to try it as it was written first.  I may try again using seasonings to perk it up a bit.

Delicious and very easy to make. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added just a little more garlic.  I heated up the garlic and oil in the microwave and poured it into a ziplock bag which I used to marinate the chicken in.  The only reason why I chose to marinate it overnight was so I wouldn't have to do any preparation the following day.

I used 6 chicken thighs (its what I had on hand) and it was so... good.  There was just enough bread crumbs/parmesan to cover all 6.

Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was wonderful!  My husband (who is incredibly picky) said that he thought we should add this to our weekly menus.  He also said "Wow! This tastes better than Shake n Bake!"  Trust me, that is a rave review.  He loves Shake n Bake!!  I followed recipe exactly except for cooking time/temp.  I cooked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect!!

Awesome Recipe! The only changes i made was to add cayenne to the bread crumbs (we like it spicy) and salt and pepper the chicken first. Next time I might flip it half way through.

Very good.  I followed others' advice and cut the chicken into strips.  It baked very well.  Even though I didn't do it this time, I think mixing the breading with panko breadcrumbs would be a good idea.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe!  Easy to make and smells wonderful!  I also used italian breadcrumbs and increased the amount of garlic.  We make them into strips or tenders instead so that the breadcrumbs will get crunchy.  We serve it with a side of dijon mustard with honey mixed in, it is superb! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Very easy to make with so few ingredients.  I used chicken legs instead of breast halves.  I would suggest adding some spices for added flavor such as Johnny's Seasoning Salt.  My picky husband wasn't crazy about it, but I thought it was pretty good.

We like this recipe but with a few changes.  We add some spices (like Tony Chacere's) and pan fry the chicken in a little oil.  Of course, it adds a little fat but baking it made it kind of blah for us.  Serve with pasta and the Marinara Sauce I from this site.  Great dinner!

This is a delicious and super moist way of making chicken.  I put it on top of asian noodles and it was fantastic.

Husband thought it was very good, son didn't like it.  It was easy to do on a weeknight.  That is important in my kitchen!  Will do again when the boy is not home!

Love this recipe!  Great alternative to dipping in egg then breadcrumbs.  I use italian seasoned breadcrumbs and it turns out very moist and tasty.  I make this often.

Quick, easy and delicious. I did add just a sprinkle of cayenne pepper for kick and it was perfect. I'll definitely be making this one again.

So easy, moist and not greasy at all.  I used Japenese bread crumbs, more garlic, seasonings that we prefer and baked it on a rack in the pan for the excess oil to run off. Served with Pasta Con Broccoli from this site and there was none left over! Thanks 8-)

EXCELLENT! This is so easy and so tasty, it's perfect for a week night meal. I was a little concernd with dipping chicken in olive oil (health-wise that it), but it turns out to be a really small amount that's on the chicken. The crusty get crispy and the chicken's tender, it's ALL GOOD! This will be a standard chicken recipe for our house.

This smelled really good while cooking but it was not the best chicken I've ever tasted.  I think the chicken was a little dull tasting and needed more spices to zest it up... maybe some salt, pepper, and paprika?
Thanks for sharing though!!!

Absolutely amazing!
notes: I also chose to marinate the chicken in Sundried Tomato salad dressing. Another nice addition is adding clumps of browned (sauteed) minced garlic on top.  These clumps will turn dark brown/black after broiling and add excellent garlic flavor to each bite.

I just made this for dinner tonight. My husband and I liked it, my kids didn't (but they are extremely picky so I didn't expect them to).  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it worked out really nice and smelled wonderful while cooking!  The only thing I would change about it would be to add some seasonings in with the breadcrumbs to kick it up a little as it was just a tiny bit bland.  Other than that, we thought it was great.  We had some potatoes and a caesar salad with it.  Will be making this again.

Okay, I had to try this since everyone was giving it 5 stars!  It was good, but I have to admit- it wasn't to DIE for.  My kids liked it, I guess I am just a little disappointed because I thought with all of the RAVE reviews I would love it.  I still give it 4 stars because it was quick and good- just not GREAT.

This was a good meal, although next time I'll add some more garlic.  It was really good thought.  I made it with oven roasted red baby potatoes (tossed with EVOO, rosemary, oregano, salt, pepper and garlic powder), whole wheat rolls and sugar snap snow peas.  Good meal!!

I am giving this 5 stars for how cheap and easy this is!  It's tasty enough that everybody liked it too.  I subbed seasoned bread crumbs and I think next time I'll try adding a little garlic powder to them also.

great chicken dish.  I used a little less olive oil and added ranch powder to the mix.  It turned out great.  Even the kids ate it.  Made with fried corn and green beans. Very nice.

Very easy to make!  I love recipes with minimal ingredients that I usually always have on hand.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I toasted 2 pieces of bread and cut/crumbled them up.  Whip up some noodles and a veggie & you are good to go.  I will make this again very soon!

A much healthier alternative to fried chicken.  I used panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs and ate the chicken with tonkatsu sauce and white rice, yum!

Excellent!  This recipe was so simple to make and I was really surprised at how flavorful the chicken was.  I've been frying my cutlets for a hundred years, but no more frying for me!  I did however bake a little too long and will only bake for about 20-25 minutes next time.  Maybe the chicken was too thin for the required baking time given in the recipe.

My husband (pickiest eater ever) loved it! It was great. Very crispy.
I used butter instead of olive oil, and it added great flavor.
Definetly added to our regular dinners.

This has got to be the best chicken I made in a long time! I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese, seasoned bread crumbs and the garlic that comes in a jar already chopped (rather than fresh).  I pounded the chicken to flatten it out and after I made it up, I put it in the fridge for about an hour.  I bet that let the garlic flavor get into the chicken a little bit more than if I had just made it up and cooked it.  This is a "must try" if you haven't already!

I absolutly love this recipe.  I can whip this up in no time after a long day at work. And while it is cooking in the oven I can make rice and a salad to go with it. My daughter (who can be very picky) loves the taste of the chicken and also likes to dip it in Ranch dressing for extra zip

I pounded the chicken with a mallet to thin it a bit. This dish is perfect. A hit with four picky kids as well as mom and dad.

I baked my chicken for 35 minutes and that was a bit too long as the chicken was on the dry side.  The flavor is good, but my family prefers more--sauce, etc.  I still plan to make again in a time crunch as it was incredibly fast & easy and it would be better if not overcooked.  It also uses ingredients I have on hand at all times.

Was in a jam to cook dinner last night.  Wanted something new but it had to be easy & quick -- Here it is!!  This was great, fast all ingredients were on hand & best of all, we all loved it!  So glad I made extra so we have for leftovers today for lunch!  We love garlic so I added extra cloves & also added garlic powder to breadcrumb mixture.  So much flavor & love the crunch in the texture of the coating.  Thanks for sharing!

Best chicken ever! My husband and I gobbled it all up. This was fast and easy. I added basil to the garlic/oil mixture and added garlic powder in the parmesan/breadcrumb mix. I served it with the garlic mashed potatoes secret recipe and it was wonderful! Thanks.

While the chicken was moist, it was rather bland tasting.  Perhaps the chicken should be marinated the night before to infuse more flavor.  Also, the bread crumb/parmesan mixture came out a little clumpy(soggy).  Average, middle of the road chicken that is just a bit above shake and bake.

This was delicious!  I did use extra garlic and actually made the mistake of buying shaved parmesan cheese. Will use more bread crumbs next time, too.  Nevertheless, this dish came out wonderful! I did cook the chicken at 425 degrees for 25 minutes and it came out so moist!

Wonderful chicken dish!! I did increase the garlic by about one teaspoon. Flavor went all the way thru the chicken--yummy. I had to turn oven down and bake at 350 as it started to get quite brown right away. I also loosly layed a piece of foil on top. Came out lovely. Will make again for sure.

This chicken was really good.  It was enjoyed by all.  I did pound the breasts as suggested by another review, and added rosemary to the dry mix. It came out really crispy and juicy. I will make this again!

I made this for my boyfriend this weekend, and we loved it!!  I upped the garlic to 5 cloves, and did not press the garlic, because both of us like to retain the bolder flavor of unpressed garlic, and we loved the slices of garlic ended up sticking to the chicken baked into the breading!  We will be eating this again!

This recipe was great.  My whole family loved it.  My three year old who barely eats even asked for more.  What I liked best about this recipe was that it was so easy.  I used 5 garlic cloves and added a little bit of salt to the seasoned bread crumbs.  I plan to make this a lot during the work week.

Just another rave to add!  This was so easy and really tasty.  It is a great meal to make on a busy night.  We ate it with angel hair pasta that I poured some of the oil on and added some parmesan.  It was divine!

I made this last night and it was very good.  The chicken was moist and juicy.  We like garlic, so I added about 6 cloves to the oil.  Even with all that garlic, you really couldn't taste it all that much.  It was still delicious and I will definitely make it again soon.  I did however add extra parmesean and broiled for the last couple of minutes so the breading would be crispier.  Overall, it was a delicious, quick and easy meal.

Fabulous.  So simple, so delicious.  I breaded my chicken with the bread crumbs and parmesean cheese and then sauted the chicken in the olive oil and garlic.  Once the chicken had a good crust on each side, I popped the pan into the oven to finish cooking.

This was a very good recipe, I will definately replace my other chicken recipes for this.  One suggestion that I'm going to try next time is the make your chicken into thinner pieces by either using a mallet or buying them that way.  Mine were real thick and I think they would be even better in thin pieces!!  You must try this recipe!

Very easy and fast to make. my husband liked it, but I would prefer a bit more flavor. I used  boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts. First   of all, i will definately put  some salt/pepper  on the meat next time. Also i will use extra garlic, bread crumbs and parm. next time.  I also sprinkled some fresh grated parm on top and broiled for the last few minutes.

LOVE it! This recipe's a keeper for sure. The chicken came out tender and tasty. Agreed with other user's though, not as much garlic flavor as the name implies so I just doubled the garlic and it was just to my family's liking. Thanks for such a wonderful and easy recipe!

Very easy, basic recipe and is the kind of dish that would please most.  I doubled the garlic because to me, there is no such thing as too much garlic.  I agree that infusing the olive oil with garlic is what makes this recipe differ from others.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil.  I also used Italian flavored breadcrumbs rather than plain.  I think that this recipe (as written) would be very bland as it was close to being so even with my additions, but it's an easy enough recipe to doctor up to your own liking.  I served mine with marinara and it tasted like chicken parmesan.

This chicken is tender but I felt it was very bland. I even marinated it in garlic/olive oil mixture before and wasn't too impressed. Like I said, the texture is great, but the chicken needs spices.

What a wonderful tasting, easy to prepare chicken recipe. The secret is warming the garlic/oil mixture. I'd tried a similar recipe that didn't have that step and it just didn't have the great garlic taste that this one has. Thanks so much Carol for a recipe that I'll use over and over.

This recipe was VERY easy and tastes great, I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain ones and poured the excess garlic and oil over the top. I will be making this again for sure, thanks for the awesome recipe!!

My husband is lactose intolerant, so I skipped out on the cheese and it was still fabulous.  I used Italian bread crumbs with lots of added basil and rosemary.  I used a HUGE spoonfull of minced garlic wiht the olive oil and let it sit in the fridge all day.  This was wonderful!!  Will definitly make again!!  Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME!!!  Is there a 10 star rating?  This was fabulous.  I went under the meal ideas section to pair this up with Mashed red potatos and the mini cheesecakes.  Everything was perfect.  This is the best tasting chickn dish I've ever made.  My fiancee loved it and so did our friend who came an hour later.  Nice and crunchy and very flavorful.  Only change I mmade was instead of chicken breasts, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  But other than that, this recipe is darn near perfect!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Chicken just doesn't get any better than this! I baked it on wire racks which made the outside crunchy and the inside very tender. If you do this, reduce the cooking time by about 10 minutes! Great recipe!!

Yummy!  I did add 4tsp of garlic and since I didn't have bread crumbs handy I used seasoned crutons that my 2-year-old daughter loved turning into crumbs.  QUICK EASY YUMMY

This was delicious -- I made the olive oil/garlic combo first and let it sit for about 15 min to infuse well.  I  also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and romano cheese since we were out of the parmesan.  My husband and I both loved it -- will definately be making again.

These chicken breasts came out well: still moist inside, with a nice, crispy crust.  I doubled the garlic, used seasoned bread crumbs, and added a little cayenne to the coating.  This recipe also gets points for how incredibly quick and easy it was to prepare.  It's ready in no time at all.

I don't usually like baked chicken breast but this came out moist, with a bit of crunch from the bread crumbs.  I put the garlic and olive oil in a Pyrex baking dish to dip the chicken, then tossed sliced summer squash in the leftover oil and baked, covered, with the chicken.

Wow - this was a big hit, even with the hard to please kids.  I took alot of ideas from previous reviews...namely, pounding the chicken breasts so they are thinner, marinating them in the olive oil & garlic for about an hour, adding seasonings (black pepper, italian seasoning & some Mrs. Dash), plus flipping them halfway through the cooking time.  I also crushed up some croutons that I had in the cupboard & used those for some of the breadcrumbs, just to add some more flavour.  I ran out of the bread crumb mixture, but the breasts were big that I used.  This is a keeper!  Thanks, Carol

After reading the reviews, I was very surprised to find that this recipe was good, but nothing special.  I added extra garlic and extra cheese, along with some other spices to give it more flavor...and it was still very bland.  Not worth the effort.

Soooo easy. It was after 4pm and didn't know what to do with my defrosted chicken. I went online and found this. I did cook it a bit longer than it called for and I didn't have crushed garlic so I used minced garlic in the jar. Next time I would like to use fresh garlic, and a little salt and pepper. I enjoyed it, thank you Carol!!!

This is the first thing I have EVER made, and my fiance and I just loved it! It was so easy and so good! My breadcrumbs were really fine, and didn't harden up very well, so the crust was slippery and would slide off if the fork touched it, but the flavor was amazing! Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe!

I made this last week for dinner for my husband and I.  We both agree that we would actually like to give this recipe 3.5 stars.  This was a very good, not great, chicken dish.  It was real easy to make, which I certainly appreciated.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic, rather than the crushed garlic, and I drizzled the leftover oil and bread crumb mixtures over the chicken after I'd placed it in the pan, as some others have suggested to do.  Smelled great while it was cooking, and tasted good, too.  I will be making this again sometime.

omg, is this an easy & delicious way to eat chicken! during dinner, my boyfriend mentioned 3 times how good this was. i followed the recipe as directed with the exceptions of using 1 T. garlic & nearly doubling the parmesan/bread crumb amount (as recommended by other reviewers). bake in a foil lined shallow pan & enjoy! many thanks carol!

This was delicious! I had jarred garlic,I used 2 heaping tsp. for 3 chicken breasts! I used the leftover oil to drizzle on and around the chicken before baking. It was moist and tender. We had it with buttered boiled potatoes and mixed green salad. THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS!!!!!

Made this tonight with chicken breast pounded down.  Ended up marinading it for about an hour in the Olive oil Garlic mix. ( I added fresh groung pepper as well.)  Put it in a pam sprayed baking dish and baked it @ 350 with kraft parmisan and it turned out Wonderful!  meat was tender and flavorful!  Will definately use this recipe again!  I served it over Rice a Roni parmisan sauce and rice and it was a big hit with my picky 4 and 5 yr old eaters!  Thanks for the recipe Carol!

I agree with everyone!  It was excellent...I will also add more garlic because we love it and although we could smell it cooking, wasn't very strong tasting.  I would also add something to the breading next time as it was slightly bland for us, though we tend to like things "zippy"...Can't wait to have again..Thanks!

I'm practically drooling as I recall how awesome this chicken was!  The chicken came out so moist and tender.  Easy and didn't take long, even for 65 servings.  There was a lot of "breading" left over, I just sprinkled it on top and it was great!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!!! It is a very light tasting breaded chicken breast. My fiance and i absolutley love it. We always add some seasonings to the bread crumb mixture too, like some rosemary, pepper, he even added some red pepper to give it a little kick. You can't go wrong with this one!

This was a quick and easy chicken dish and has excellent favor. I had it with stuffing and little gravy. I have a infant daughter and this was something I did while she was napping. That is the kind of cooking I like!!!

I made this for my husband and step-daughter and they loved it.  I tested the chicken before removing it from the oven...it didn't require the full 30 minutes.  The chicken was moist and full of flavor.  I served it with pasta in a pseudo alfredo sauce (using fat free hal and half instead of cream) and steamed green beans.  My step-daughter enjoyed it so much that she put top dibs on it for our weekly "Leftover Night"!

Delicious!  I don't know if the olive oil was even necessary though.  Maybe next time, I'll mix the garlic in with the breading and ditch the oil altogether.

This recipe turned out SO YUMMY! And it couldn't be easier. Even my picky eater ate it up! The chicken was moist and very flavorful. We don't use the "stuff in the green can" parmesean, so I made this with shredded parmesean. I patted extra on the chicken and it worked fine. We had 1/2 chicken breast left, and the flavors were even better the next day! Will make again!

This recipe is really great it has become one of my favorites. The flavor is just right not to strong on the garlic and not little it's just right. It's also easy and quick to make. I am sure if you try you will love it too.

I couldn't believe how good this was for how simple it was!  I too subbed in 1 tsp. minced garlic and used the "thin sliced" chicken breasts based on some of the other reviews.  I'm using the leftovers to make chicken parm!

I made this last week and it was amazing!  I did as some others suggested, and sliced my chicken breasts in half (making them filets) and they were incredibly moist.  I ran out of chopped garlic, so I used garlic powder (or salt, can't remember), either way turned out great!  I cooked it with roasted potatoes, wouldn't do that again, the bottoms of the chicken never got crispy, next time I will cook them on a baking sheet by themselves.

This was really delicious and incredibly easy to make. I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I just used the minced garlic outta the jar...and it worked fine...only used about 1 tsp.

Tastes wonderful and a snap to make.  I've made this recipe several times and my only suggestion would be to make sure that the breasts are pounded somewhat thin - that way the chicken is somewhat crisp on the outside and still remains moist and tender on the inside.

Turned out great! However, next time I will add more garlic and consider marinating the chicken in the olive oil/garlic mixture. I used Italian bread crumbs and may also season the breasts with salt and pepper nexdt time.

I used chicken thigh instead of chicken breast and baked for 5 minutes less.  Before warming up the olive oil, I soaked the garlic in it for a good hour or so to make sure the flavors blend.  

Husband, who's a garlic hater, commented on the strong garlic smell in the kitchen before dinner with a grimace on his face but did not complain at all when he tasted it.

One thing I didn't like about it was how greasy it looked when I took it out of the baking dish.  I had to let the oil drip off a bit before putting it on a plate (see photo).

This was good! I like it especially with chicken tenders because you get even more cheese & breadcrumbs :) I think it's a perfect easy-but-good meat to put with a really good side dish.

This is a great recipe to make on an "off night".  I made this with what I happen to have in the kitchen, which was salmon instead of chicken, and it was really good. Very quick and easy and gave the salmon a little different taste.  I am really pleased with this recipe. I want to try it with chicken too.

This is for sure the best breaded chicken recipe I have tried. I used this to make my Chicken Parmesan and it was fabulous! Everyone loved it! The chicken stays very moist and has so much more flavour than the usual breaded chicken breast recipe of dipping in egg or milk first. This is now my standard breaded/coated chicken breast recipe! Thanks!

I used chicken thighs, italian bread crumbs, and fresh Parmesan cheese. After reading the reviews, I decided to season the chicken with some salt and pepper before dipping into the olive oil/garlic blend. I followed the rest of the directions. It turned out very tender and full of flavor. My family loved it.

I thought this was pretty fantastic, I added alot more garlic (like 4-5 fresh cloves) and also used the parmesan cheese in the can b/c I wasn't sure which the recipe called for and thought the canned might adhere better. It did stick pretty well. I also seasoned my bread crumbs with Italian seasoning and drizzled a bit of oil onto the top before popping it in the oven. Next time I would make a bit more of the olive oil  mixture because I barely had enough. Was DEE LISH & EASY!

EASY AND WONDERFUL.  You can't beat that.  All the ingredients you have on hand, so you can alway make.  So simple.  My kids, who hate everything I make for dinner and I don't cook gourmet, Love this.  For the first time other than nuggets, they ate without complaining.  What  a joy.

This is such a wonderful and simple recipe.  A great way to eat more garlic.  I use a lot more than 2 tsp garlic when I make this.  I also mix the dry bread crumbs with ground flaxseed for nutritional benefit.

Awesome! The only things I did different were I pounded the chicken breasts thin and added more garlic.  Also used canned parmesan cheese.  I would double the crumb mixture.

Ooooh yeah - that's what I'm talkin' about!  Great basic recipe!  I used the frozen chicken breasts so I went by the package directions of 375 oven for around 45 mins or so.  Perfect!

Awesome.  My whole family loved it, even my son's friend that hates everything. They call them "Better than Chicken McNuggets, McNuggets".  I chopped up chicken tenders, then baked them for about 20 min at 375.  Tender, tasty and totally easy...my favorite kind.

I am a true garlic lover and was so looking forward to this recipe. However, even for me, this was TOO much garlic. It smelled up my house for two days and my husband thought it was just too strong. I might try this again using only 1/2 the garlic. Overall, was dissapointed with this recipe.

This was an easy and excellent recipe. I used boneless skinless thighs instead and my husband, who doesn't like dark meat, said this was the best chicken he's ever tasted.The leftovers were great over a salad with Italian dressing.

This turned out perfect. Tender and flavorful. My husband loved this. I think the key thing is I sauted the garlic and oil first in a pan for a minute or two and then set aside for dipping. I also did use extra garlic and used italian bread crumbs and I also seasoned the chicken breast with a little salt and pepper first for a little seasoning and the flavors were wonderful. :)

I use seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. Gives it a little more zip. Don't forget the salt and pepper. Serve over a bed of angel hair pasta.

This recipe was great....and SO easy!  I think the name was a little misleading, because it is actually more like a chicken parmesan.  It was so good!  I made this on Monday, and by Friday my husband was asking me to make it again!   I did add a little bit more garlic, as many of the reviews suggested, and I also poured some spaghetti sauce over it and melted some shredded mozzerella for the last few minutes.  Served over a bed of pasta, I think that it came out perfect!

Great taste and tender chicken, but I probably should have followed the others' advice and melt butter on the dish before placing the chicken inside. Also, I think I would be more sparing when it comes to dipping the chicken in the parmesan/bread crumb mixture.

My fiance loves garlic, so I thought this would be perfect. The chicken was very tender, but the breadcrumbs overtook the garlic flavor. I added extra garlic, but it still was not enough zest. I probably will not make this again.

quick and easy like everyone else is saying.  I cooked it on a baking sheet instead of a glass baking dish, but the chicken browned a little, making it kinda crunchy in places, but overall still was very very good.

The best chicken dish I've ever made!  I've finally found a breaded chicken recipe that tastes absolutely wonderful and is so easy to make.  I added pepper and garlic powder/salt to the bread crumb mixture for extra zing, and melted butter in the bottom of the dish before placing chicken breasts.  This one's a keeper!

This gets 5 stars because it was soo tender.  I put in too much garlic, us crazy Italians, oh well.  It would be fun to try onions in the oil, or other stuff.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and the chicken was so tender & moist. I used two cloves of fresh garlic and needed a bit more of both bread crumbs & parmesan. I lowered the temperature to 200c as I thought 220c would burn the top. It was perfect. Thanks Carol for the recipe.

This was a good recipe but we didn't find that it had a real "garlic" flavor - if I made it again I might add some garlic powder to the bread crumb/cheese mixture to perk it up a bit.

very moist and flavorful - if you add pepper, garlic powder and a pinch of salt to the breadcrumb mix.  It's very versatile and can be served with pasta, rice or mashed potatoes!  Thanks for sharing!

This chicken was great!!!! I hate cooking chicken at home because it always turns out dry and flavorless, but this chicken was so moist and so tasty! I doubled up on the bread crumbs and used four garlic cloves! It was fantastic! thank you for this awesome recipe!

Really good! I cut these up into bite size pieces, brushed with oil, and put the other ingredients into a baggie, shook them up so they were evenly coated and served with rotini in a rose sauce.

Based on all the reviews, I was excited to make this.  But after following the recipe as written, the chicken was juicy, but had no flavor.  It looked great, but none of the garlic/cheese taste cooked through the chicken.

Easy and quick and sure to impress! If you like garlic, you will love this recipe. I recommend making more bread crumbs and garlic though...it seemed by the 4th breast I was running out.

I prepared recipe as written. Chicken was tender, but oily.  It tasted mostly like olive oil chicken. It smelled and looked wonderful - garlicky and golden brown - but the taste didn't reflect any of that.

This is a great recipe.  Not many ingredients, easy to prepare and great flavor and aroma.  It doesn't get any better than that.  The only change I will make next time is to pound the chicken breast flat.  I find the chicken is more tender that way and it cooks more evenly since you don't have one end thicker than the other.

A nice, easy dinner! I took another's advice and added some S&P, dried parsley, garlic & onion powder to the breadcrumb/parmesan mix before coating the chicken.  The garlic was a little too subtle for me so next time, I would add more.  Thank you much Carol!

This recipe is soooo simple.  My husband and 2 yr old both gave it the thumbs up.  The only thing is that it was a little bit bland.  I'm not sure if it was the bread crumbs that I used.  I used Italian bread crumbs.  I think that next time I will add a little salt to the bread crumb/chesse mixture.  Thanks, this is definately a keeper for my family.

This was not too bad at all.  For sure the chicken needs a little seasoning or use seasoned breadcrumbs.  I can imagine how bland this is w/o that.

My family did not like this.  I guess if you are a cheese lover, it would be great.  It could have used more seasoning, kind of bland.  The seasoning I did put on it came off when I dipped the chicken in the bread crumb batter.

Followed the concept, but didn't really follow the measurements. Like other reviewers, we also used Italian breadcrumbs, and instead of olive oil we used butter. It was really great! Olive oil may be good as well and we'll try that next time. Even our 13 year old loved it!

Super-easy and very good. I wouldn't necessarily make this as a company dish, but for a quick evening meal, you can't beat this dish.

Here are my changes and recommendations:
1) I doubled the Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.
2) In the topping I also added a lot of spices - cayenne pepper, chili pepper, basil, etc. Just play around and add whatever suits your fancy. Have fun w/ spices.
3) The next time I make I will marinate the breasts in a light Italian dressing to make them even juicier.

This is a great recipe for an easy weekday night dinner. I served w/ broccoli rice, bagged Caesar salad and rolls.

This was such a great easy recipe with wonderful smells and flavor if you are a garlic lover, if you're not that fond of garlic it's probably not for you.  I even made a honey-mustard sauce to dip them and they were fantastic!  THANKS

I followed others and doubled the recipe, used chicken tenders, italian bread crumbs, and marinated for 2 hrs. I also used chopped garlic in a jar. My party of 3 liked it. My boyfriend gives it a 4. I thought it was too salty. But then, I usually think many things are too salty. So, I guess majority rules! Putting my bland taste buds aside, I baked it for 30 minutes at 425 degrees and it didnt make it dry.

I only tried this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I was suprised how good it was. The garlic really adds something.  I added a little extra spices to the breadcrumbs.  I'll make this again

This recipe is awesome!  So juicy and lots of flavor and quite easy to prepare.  Great next to mashed potatoes.  I gave this recipe to my sister and her entire family loved it too!

Excellant! A nice change from the normal eggs and bread crumbs breading method. This was quick and easy to do as well. The olive oil and garlic seem to make the parmesean and bread crumbs soft, even after a half an hour of baking. No more crunchy baked chicken for me. I'm sticking with this tender recipe.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this was. I used boneless, skinless chicken tenders because I like how much faster they cook. These came out like restaurant style fried chicken fingers. I must have made more than 10, but the family gobbled them up and wanted more. My husband LOVED them and he is just a picky as my 2 year old who also ate every last piece I gave him. I did what some others reccomended - (double the garlic and add parsley and salt.) And the house smelled so good while they were cooking that I had to keep swallowing to keep the drool from coming out of my mouth!! ;) --- I'm making these again for lunch today - When my husband is at work, so there's more for me! ;) Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

I made this last week and it was sooooooooo yummy.  I left the printed recipe on the kitchen counter next to the stove. The next morning I found the recipe next to my coffee maker. My husband wrote "Two thumbs up!" on the bottom of the page.  I'm making it again tonight with Garlic Sauteed Artichokes - another 5 star family favorite. Thank you for this recipe :-)

Out of all the recipes I have tried on this site this is probaly the best one and easiest! I took others advice~ 1. doubled the garlic (i used minced instead of crushed) 2. pounded the breasts (also poked holes w/ a fork)3. seasoned bread crumb mixture w/ salt & pepper, lemon pepper and a pinch of fresh parsley.  So good.  Also made a pasta side dish w/ the leftover garlic mixture.  Hubby and kids loved it, even scraped the pan!

Not bad. I think I needed more garlic and more bread crumbs/parmesan cheese. Next time I will add more of those things and I think I will like it more.

This was good and simple to make. Thanks to others reviews, I pounded the chicken and it was so tender! Also doubled the amount of garlic. Also needed some salt. But, in terms of simplicity and taste, this is a keeper!

Very easy and very tasty! My husband and I loved this one. Next time we try it, though, I'm going to pound the chicken a little so it's more breaded and we're going to try putting spaghetti sauce and melted mozzarella cheese on top. Five stars all the way!

This wasn't bad.  I added more garlic to the oil (althought I didn't actually measure anything) and garlic powder, a little cayenne pepper and some black pepper to the cheese and breadcrumbs.  It was good, but the chicken was kind of mushy on the bottom.  I'd try it again though.  I might try flipping it halfway through cooking.

This is a tasty entree. I do suggest, however, that the baking time is far too 
conservative. Unless my new oven was way off, more than 60 minutes seems
a better cooking time.

I've baked chicken in paper bags since college and never found 35 minutes long
enough to cook chicken. (I don't live in the montains where altitude could be a 
factor.)

Recommended by a chicken lover...or one who loves chicken.

Although the chicken was tender and juicy, the coating didn't crispen up like I'd hoped.  I should have added a little garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  Maybe if I added more Parmesan cheese to the mixture...

This was so delicious! Incredibly quick and easy, it was prepared within a matter of minutes. As we were cooking pot roast simultaneously, we cooked it longer at a temperature of 375. The results were heavenly! Tender, flavourful chicken. I'll be making this again.

I had planned on following this recipe to a tee, but I don't care for olive oil, and oops- forgot the parmesan! No matter- I used melted butter in place of the oil, and added an extra clove of garlic. There was plenty of garlic butter left to pour over my breaded chicken breasts before baking, which made for extrememly tender and flavorful chicken! Maximum Yum!!

Wonderful flavor and very tender!  I added some fresh chopped parsley to the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture to give it some color.  I made this a few weeks ago, and tonight my husband asked for it by name!  This will definitely be a dinner staple in our household - thanks!

As suggested, I started off doubling the garlic. The results were delicious, but then I'm a garlic nut. Yummy even with fat-free parm. I didn't think my ck. breasts were that large, but I still had to mix another 50% of the bread crumb/cheese mixture to cover them. I also added basil and used Italian breadcrumbs as suggested in the reviews. Rare results to be so fast & easy!

Very easy and tasty!!  The chicken ends up being lightly breaded and juicy inside.  This recipe is so nice because it uses ingredients you have around the house.

I would rate the recipe as is a 3. Kinda boring. If you add all the stuff they say to in the other reviews it's pretty good. Made with spices it is about a 4.

I made this once before and gave it a 3 star rating. Even though my company liked it I told all of you that I felt I had overbreaded it, lacked garlic flavor and was dry.  I tried it again today and now give it 5 stars. - I followed the recipe exactly last time - this time I made changes.  Like others, for 4 chicken breasts I ended up doubling EVERYTHING! After preparing the oil and garlic, I poured it in a baggie along with the chicken and marinated in the frige for 2 hours (less or more time will improve the taste).  So as not to overbread the chicken, I used the shake and bake method and put the seasoned breadcrumbs and cheese in another bag and shook the chicken a piece at a time, shaking off the excess.  I also cooked it less, 425 degrees for 25 min.  It was outrageous!!!! The chicken was moist, infused with garlic flavor, you could taste the moistness of the parmesean cheese and the house smelled scrumptious!  I served it with Fettucine Alfredo, cranberry sauce and a salad with Italian dressing.  I plan to make it again next week and serve it with spaghetti w/red sauce,a salad and Italian bread.  A definite keeper - glad I tried it again.

This was super good! I made this and To Die For Fettucini for my boyfriend on V-day and he ate everything! At first I was afraid that he wouldn't like it b/c he's a big red meat eater, but he was upset when I only made two breasts! The chicken was really juicy and I didn't have to cook as long as instructed. I also let it marinate in the butter and garlic all day. I used Italian bread crumbs like recommended. It was fantastic! I will definately make this again!!!

I was ridiculed at the firehouse for making this recipe. The chicken was moist and tender but the flavor was not 5 star quality. It tasted alot better the next day cold.

I got this exact recipe from a cookbook years ago, the only difference being melted butter instead of olive oil.  Both are equally good.  (Olive oil may be healthier.) This is dish smells fabulous while baking, and tastes fabulous for garlic lovers.

Good recipe......its easy and quick.  I wish it was just a little more flavorful though, I didn't taste much garlic.

This is the 5th chicken recipe i ever tried as a beginning cook, instead of using 4 peices of chicken i used 2, but kept same ingredients...cooked only 25 minutes and the result was perfect and quick to prepare, there was a hint of garlic to the chicken yet still crispy and juicy, this will be a regular for me since in was simple

Yummy! Very easy to make, chicken came out tender and very moist. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and also mixed some garlic into the breading mixture. Even my picky kids loved it. Thanks Carol I will make this often.

I thought this recipe was very yummy! The chicken was so tender. I used butter instead of olive oil and I just used garlic powder instead of crushed garlic. It came out very good! I recommend this one to others! Great! :)

This is the most AWESOME chicken recipe I have ever tried! I just found this today(in a fit of panic as I wondered what to fix for dinner).  It is delicious and so moist and tender!  I did add a little  garlic powder to the crumb coating mixture and a little more crushed(about another half tsp.)garlic to the oil, and it doesn't taste overpowering at all.  I can't wait til my husband gets home to taste this, he's gonna love it!

Super easy and very, very good. The chicken was so tender, you could cut it with a fork (of course, I pounded it before I coated it). Even my husband ate it, even though I had made him a steak because I thought he wouldn't touch it. He loved it!

I loved this chicken.  I also served it with garlic Rice a Roni.  My husband prefers sauces, so it was a bit dry for him.  For garlic lovers, however, it's very good!  I will certainly keep this one and make it again!

Excellent!  Tasty & crispy yet moist.  Picky husband loved it, as well as my daughter.  It was so fast and easy to make - can't wait to make again!  Should have made more for the three of us - no one got enough because it was so good.  Will be making it again and again.  Thank you!

This was really easy and quick, but not that great. It was not garlicky enough for us, and I had to use more breadcrumbs than suggested. It still came out sort of bland.

This came out great! I used italian bread crumbs with romano cheese, and added durkee onions to the bread crumbs, and thin chicken cutlets.. served with angelhair tossed with red sauce on the side. We think it was practically identical to Chicken Romano from the Cheesecake Factory.

Very tasty and tender and easy too. I have made this twice. It is a keeper!  During the 2nd cooking, about 10 minutes before it was done I topped it with spaghetti sauce and italian cheeses for an easy chicken parmesan.  Super!

This is a really good recipe that needed a little kick, so I added 1/8 cup of garlic powder      
( depends on your preference for garlic ) to the bread crumb and parmesan mixture and 1 tablespoon each of fresh parsley and basil.  My roomies loved it!!!  Thanks for the recipe Carol!!  :o)

Overall this recipe was simple and delicious. Picky eaters would love this dish because it doesn't have a strong taste, but enough to make the chicken tasty. I couldn't find anything negative to say about this recipe. I give it an A.

One of the best baked chicken recipes!!!  I like this recipe better with the following changes:  substitute 1/2 the oil with butter.  Add a heaping tablespoon of dijon mustard to the butter/garlic mixture before dipping in the bread crumbs/cheese.  Bake on a rack in a pan to keep it crispier.

My family loves garlic, so we actually added a few cloves, and we use Italian bread crumbs instead of regular.  I've made this for guests too, and have had nothing but praises.  It's just SO easy!

My family wanted this again only two nights after I made it!  That NEVER happens!  It was SO juicy and garlicky! I used homemade bread crumbs from homemade bread-coarsly ground-which gave the breading a nice texture. I also added some parsley and garlic salt to the bread crumbs. Awesome flavor and so easy.

I've made this three times and I think to get the most from it you need to take the advice of some of the other reviewers. Double crumbs, cheese and garlic. Use Italian flavored crumbs - too bland with plain crumbs. Add a few grinds of pepper to the oil. My contribution: chop the garlic and also add some chopped onion to the oil. Then strain before dipping chicken. Also 425 degrees is a bit excessive. 350 works fine for me.

Great recipe.  I used italian bread crumbs and added a little salt, black pepper, paprika and onion powder. I also doubled the bread crumbs and added extra garlic. My husband and kids loved it! They kids cut the chicken into squares and dipped them in dijon mustard to make "chicken nuggets"!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

YUM YUM YUM! The few ingrediants are deceiving, as this is the best baked chicken I have ever made!  I will definately put this on the top of list!  I absolutely loved it!  The chicken was so tender that I didn't even need a knife.  Thanks for the great recipe, Carol.

This was a good meal, but I expected 
something a bit more fantastic judging
by all the raves it's received.  Still,
a nice dish.  Next time, I'd use a bit
less garlic, however

My husband really does not like to cook. I just got out of the hospital and asked him to cook this chicken dish. All I can say, he was so proud of himself! Gave the recipe to my sister and her family loved it as well.
Thank you for a wonderful recipe! NancyCarole

I MADE THIS CHICKEN FOR MY CARD CLUB AND EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT IT.THEY ALSO ASKED FOR THE RECIPE.  IT WAS SO EASY AND FAST.  MY FAMILY LOVES IT ALSO.  I DO USE 3 TEASPOONS OF GARLIC AND MAKE A DOUBLE BATCH.  IT IS ALSO GREAT SERVED AS A SANDWICH ON FRENCH BREAD. THIS IS A KEEPER.

This recipe couldn't have been easier, and the chicken was delicious.  However, the dish is even better if you double the bread crumbs and cheese.

It was extremely easy and quick to make.  I also modified it so that you can marinate the chicken breast with a nice sun dried tomato salad dressing and some crushed peppers instead of the garlic and olive oil. It was delicious!!!

Great recipe! I cut my chicken into cubes, which turned out delicious. I used minced garlic from a jar and Pepperidge Farm dress with Italian seasoning mixed in since this is what I had on hand. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this for my family of 5 with a package of chicken tenderloins. I probably doubled the garlic and used double the butter instead of oil. I also added garlic salt, pepper and parsley to Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I drizzled the leftover butter/garlic mix over the chicken and added another thin layer of shredded Parmesan. I baked for 15 minutes at 425 degrees and then 5 more minutes at 475 to get a little more crisp. Next time Iâll try 500 degrees. Came out juicy and delicious.

Came out great! However, I used crushed up Ritz crackers and garlic croutons mixed with Italian seasonings instead of bread crumbs since I was out of crumbs. Gave it a good flavor and texture. Dish was simple but tasted very good.

I made this recipe on behalf of a recommendation from google. I told myself if this recipe was decent then Iâd be completely impressed. Itâs the first time I told google to find me a recipe for chicken and she gave me this. This chicken is so good you could sell it. Not joking. Far different than anything Iâve made in a while. Pair it with steamed broccoli and a salad or just toss up some butter garlic noodles like I did and BAM... absolute perfection.

Easy, fast, flavorful!  Plan on making again.  We did like another reviewer.  I doubled the bread crumb and parmesan amounts, crushed about 6-7 medium to large cloves of garlic and doubled the amount of oil.   This was all used with 6 decent sized chicken breasts.  The chicken makes a difference in texture.  I had 2 breasts which had been frozen for a couple of months and I purchased 3 organics fresh breasts.  The fresh breasts were excellent.  Clean biting, juicy, etc.  The frozen breasts were also good, but more stringy and less juicy.

Excellent! Used 4 chicken breasts.  Used about 3/4 cups italian bread crumbs and  approx 3/8 cup cheese.  Used roasted garlic infused olive oil to save time.  Put the bread crumb/cheese mix in a large zip bag and added some pepper and italian herb mix.  Dipped the chicken breast in the olive oil and then put in the bag w/bread crumb mix and tossed.  Lightly coated pan w/plain olive oil before putting in oven.  Done in 25 minutes.  Was very tender.

Very easy and Very good.  I used Lite Italian dressing instead of olive oil and garlic as one other reviewer mentioned.  

I steamed some broccoli to go with it.  Very low Carb and tasty meal.

This will definitely be one of our regulars.

Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe so many times I've lost count. It turns out perfect every time! Heating the garlic and the oil in the microwave makes the whole kitchen smell yummy! Following these directions, the chicken bakes perfectly. I follow the recipe exactly, except for maybe adding an extra clove of garlic. you can never have too much garlic. Thanks so much for an awesome and easy recipe.

I made the recipe as stated. It was very good. I might lower the oven temperature next time & bake a little longer & use more garlic because I love garlic, but other than that I will not make any changes. It is great as written & I will definitely make again. Easy, healthy & good.

I followed the recipe just as it was written. I am a big fan of garlic and was hoping this had a strong garlic taste. Overall, the chicken had a good flavor, but lacked the strong garlic kick that I wanted.

I made this tonight and was really impressed.  Simple yet flavorful.  I used 1/4 c of traditional breadcrumbs and added 1t of italian seasoning as a substitute for italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  It was perfect.

So I read some reviews and ended up using the butter instead of the olive oil. And OMG it was amazing! So so good. I donât know what the difference would be if you used olive oil, but if you decide to use butter, itâs GREAT!

This was so good! These are the best chicken breasts I've had. I did marinate first for about 4ish hours. Since marinade should have a bit of acid, I added rice wine vinegar because it's mild. (For the record, had doubled the recipe for 6 pieces of chicken, all the same with 1/4C rice wine vinegar to 1/2C olive oil & the garlic for marinade). Also, used real Parmesan. Didn't have an issue, maybe because of having a full pan of chicken? Came out perfectly, thanks for the recipe

I have made this few times and my family my boyfriend his daughter all love it. And my boyfriend's daughter is a very very picky rather. I always add more garlic than it ask for and bread crumbs and cheese. If you don't have Italian bread crumbs just take plan bread crumbs and Italian season mix it together then there go. Also you dont have to use virgin olive oil you can also use vegetable oil or canola oil which works just as well.

we didn't have bread crumbs so i tossed a bunch of croÃ»tons with seasoning and parmesan into a gallon-sized ziploc bag and crushed it up with a rolling pin for a reusable breading mix. Worked nicely.

I prepared this dish and it turned out great! I substituted the parmesan with shredded chedder and the olive oil with grapeseed oil. It was yummilicious! The meat was moist. Next time I'll add some pepper(s) to spice it up.

I use boneless breasts cut in half crosswise.  I soak them in low fat buttermilk for 1/2 hour then dredge them in the parmesan and breadcrumb mixture..it sticks very well.  I melt the butter and oil with the finely minced garlic and pour it into the baking dish and dip the top of the coated breasts in the mixture and turn it garlic-oil side up..  Cover with foil for 20 minutes, remove foil and let it crisp.  Fantastic.. the buttermilk tenderizes the chicken and the coating clings well.  The flavor is excellent whatever method you use..the flavors go together so well.

Very flavorful but make sure youâre seasoning the chicken in addition to the bread crumbs and Parmesan crust. I didnât have crushed garlic so I used minced. I also cooked it cover with foil at 375 instead of 450 because another review said it was too hot. Took a lil longer but came out flavorful and tender. I flipped them over so the other side could brown and added

Another meal DEVOURED before I could get a picture of it.  SO good. Used split breasts, lots of garlic, Italian breadcrumbs and freshly grated parmesan. So good. (I'm repeating myself)

Very simple chicken dish.  Made it with mashed potatoes.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  The chicken came out moist and delicious.  Great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

It was okay but I really couldnât taste the garlic. That was disappointing. Perhaps it was because I used  garlic in a jar  instead of fresh. It was tender though. I didnât keep the recipe.

I have made this twice. The second time I used more of everything (oil, garlic, cheese, breadcrumbs) the first time I ran out of the dredge... second time with more ingredients was much better. Also I greased the baking dishes the second time which was very helpful....Bottom line: I loved it.. will become a family staple... simple, VERY flavorfull.. makes great leftovers.

This chicken was delicious! After dipping in oil and then crumb/cheese mixture, I let the chicken sit for 10 minutes (advice from Chef John) and then dipped in crumb/cheese mixture again resulting in a perfect crust. The garlic flavor was subtle and the parmesan flavor was wonderful. Next time I will add about 1/2 tsp of black pepper to the bread crumbs. This chicken would go great with potatoes, on salads, with pasta and many other things.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the breading fell off.  Flavor  was really delicious, very tender and juicy.  But it didn't brown and  didn't look at all like the picture.

The garlic flavor was good but similar recipes turn out just as good without dipping in oil. If Iâm going to use that much oil I may as well fry the chicken. But overall, this was very good.

4.5 The flavor was garlicky, which we love. I justcwishedcthe crust was just a little more crunchy.. It was moist and so good. Maybe if I broiled it for a few seconds it would of been more crunchy

My only change was adding a couple of pats of butter to the olive oil.   I will definitely make this again. It was very moist and had great flavor.

I made it exactly as described, except for using more garlic (personal taste) and I had a bit less chicken.  One quite large piece, and one normal-sized. I cooked them for 33 min. and they both turned out juicy, and very good.

I did not have chicken breasts so I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I also used cracker crumbs and part of a jar of purÃ©ed garlic in canola oil.  We really enjoyed this dish - it was easy and delicious.

Fragrant, juicy, delicious and sooo easy.  My husband is not a chicken lover, but this one was a winner.  Could not be easier to make, either.  We do love garlic.  I didnât add anything, and I though it was great.

Perfect as is, but if you are low on olive oil, feel free to use Italian dressing or even balsamic and oil dressing.

No changes needed and that is a rarity for me to say. I took a picture before it went in the oven and really planned on taking another one once cooked. However, it was too good and disappeared so fast that I never got a chance to take a pic. Awesome recipe and the moistest chicken breast I have ever had. They are hard to get very juicy but this recipe did it. Perfect cook time for 6 pieces for 32 minutes in convection oven. Thank you very much for sharing!
ps: to other cooks - please use freshly grated parmesan cheese, not the bottled, dry stuff!

Made as directed very tasty chicken and moist, will
definitely make again. Might try as other suggested
butter instead of oil.

Easy to make and delicious. Chicken was moist and tender which is difficult with boneless, skinless breasts.  I'll make it again and probably put under the broiler for a few minutes to make it a little crispier.

This was fabulous and we loved it, but two adaptations made it even better; (1) We used simple panko bread crumbs, added oregano, onion, and pepper (2) after using the olive oil/garlic (we used 2x as much) combination, we put it back on the stove and added organic tomato sauce. That made a delicious topping for the chicken! Perfection!

A 5 for ease and taste.
I do not transfer oil/garlic from frying pan, just have to be on low so does not start cooking chicken breasts. Sometimes will use fork to puncture holes in breasts prior to doing anything else. 
Always add additional seasonings in with bread crumbs and parmesan (shredded better than grated). Normally some pepper and Italian seasoning .
Have heard, but not tried, is add a package of instant mashed potato flakes with bread crumbs to make even crisper.
The other nice thing about this dish, it's things already have in pantry/fridge
Don't use chicken tenders, cook to fast.

This is a great recipe but I didn't cook it in the oven.  I made it in my air fryer.  I only used half of the oil the recipe called for.  I preheated my air fryer to 425 degrees and then  baked it for 10 minutes on one side; flipped it over and baked it 5 minutes on the other side.  It was so very juicy and moist and my kitchen didn't get hot at all.

Have been making this recipe for years, but without the garlic. I think I will try that. I also like to pound the chicken for more reliable cook time and it tenderizes the breasts nicely.

Doubled the sauce as recommended and added garlic and ginger to both the sauce and the chicken. So good! We were both craving that flavor so we're having it again tonight!

I also did a white wine reduction with cream of chicken and onions to cover the chicken breasts. Good pairing.

I followed the recipe exactly. It came out pretty bland. The crunch was nice and the meat was moist but every one in my house  had to dip it in barbecue sauce. I guess everybody's taste are different. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this it was so tasty, especially for how quick it is to prep! I added about a teaspoon of truffle oil to the olive oil for an extra little flavor boost. I also poured the remaining oil mixture over the breasts once they were in the pan and sprinkled a bit more of the breading mixture over top to keep from wasting any ingredients.

Our family loved it.  Instead of bread crumbs I substituted ground pork rinds since we are on a Keto diet and added oregano and basil seasoning.  Very tasty.

Everyone thought it was tasty, including myself. I wish the breading was a little more crunchy though. I'll have to figure out a way to make that happen. ????

I am a dark meat lover. So I used drumsticks.  I followed the recipe and added onion and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. Having done all that and I didn't think it had enough garlic taste. Plus, it could use salt.

Was easy and with great flavor. I will be adding some of the garlic oil to coat the baking tray next time, and will turn the chicken about halfway through.

We had to make so many changes based on the reviews, and it still wasn't as great as I was expecting. We doubled the garlic, and the garlic flavor still wasn't evident when eating the chicken. We added salt and pepper into the breadcrumb mixture to give it flavor, and doubled the amount of breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese because there was no possible way for all the breadcrumbs to cover the chicken before.

Delicious! I don't follow directions very well, so I used butter instead of olive oil, and a heaping tablespoon of minced, jarred garlic. More garlic is always better. Also added salt and pepper to that mixture and unthawed my chicken in salt water to brine it a bit. Also used legs & wings. Absolutely wonderful!

It was really good but the recipe didn't call for enough breading so I had to make more.

Very good! Basically like big chicken nuggets. I used more garlic and way more breadcrumbs and Parm. I didnât really measure breadcrumbs and parm, just kept dumping more into the bowl as needed. Picky 4 year old ate this (yes, with honey), but still - success!

Added some flavor god Italian zest seasoning and salt/pepper. Cooked on stove top to get a crispy coating. A hint of lemon zest would be good for next time

I just made this chicken and it was amazing! I love how light it taste! I made it with rice pilaf and a salad, but next time Iâll probably make it with some pasta and a light olive oil sauce!

We will definitely be making this again.  My husband who typically complains about the blandness of chicken  even had great things to say about it.  We didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so we just added Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs we had.

This was a hit. The aroma was incredible and the baked chicken turners out moist and tender. It will be fun to try this recipe with herbs included in the bread crumb mix

It is probably just as good or better as written, but only had sage and onion stuffing mix on hand. I put the croutons in my food processor and made crumbs. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

The flavor was great but I thought there was too much oil and not enough breading. Next time I will use less oil and more bread crumbs.

What I did do differently was to poke some whole in the breast and stuff with more garlic. Also, I did the garlic infused oil and added a teaspoon of onion and garlic powder. It was very easy to make and was delicious with a good garlic taste. No vampires gonna get me tonight.

I loved this recipe, I use it all the time although I did make one change and it made a huge difference. I paneed the chicken so that it would be more flavorful and it helped a lot. I also used 6 pieces of chicken breasts and I still had enough breading to make more, even when the chicken was paneed. One other tip would be to pair this dish with mashed potatoes. They pair each other  very well. To summarize, this is an amazing dish on its own, but it is a lot better with a few minor tweaks.

We made this tonight.  It was very tasty and the chicken was juicy.  We decided to bake in an iron skillet to make the chicken crispy.  Also added a little more garlic.  Other than that, this is an EXTREMELY easy recipe with an excellent taste!

Delicious and super easy ! I served it over some leftover red sauce and spaghetti noodles ! Boom ! Instant chicken Parm !  Quick fix & the house smells amazing  ! Sometimes I add crunchy onions chopped fine and mix with the breadcrumbs. My husband loves it over and over and he's tired of chicken but no complaints with this one !!

This method makes the chicken almost taste as if it was "fried" (in a good way) because it remains flavorful and tender. Only downside is it does NOT taste good left over so you will only want to make as much as you believe will get eaten that night!

I followed the instructions except I substituted butter for olive oil and seasoned chicken with black pepper seasoning salt and poultry seasoning. My boyfriend went back for seconds which he never usually does. Simple and delicious. This one is a keeper.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed up seasoned croutons. Beating the chicken helped tenderness. My 18 yr old (who only likes fried) kept coming back for more

Sooooo easy to make & oh so yummy. The next time I will use chicken that's a little bit thicker, so it will be juicer. I made chicken parm sandwiches with the leftovers & it was delicious!

Forgot to mention, add parmesan cheese to pot at last possible moment or add to serving bowl.  Adding too soon causes cheese to melt and fall to bottom of pot where it sticks.

This is a great, easy recipe with simple ingredients that packs a lot of flavor into less than an hour prep time. Even my 4 year old loves this chicken, and she's fairly anti-meat at the moment. I've made the recipe twice now, once with panko bread crumbs and once with regular, and I recommend the regular. The texture comes out better. Next time, I'd like to add some balsamic vinegar to the oil and garlic for a little tang. Thanks for sharing this!

Delicious and easy meal! I didn't use parmesan because the hubby doesn't like cheese and i added a little red pepper to the bread crumbs; gave it a good kick! Will be defiantly making again, but instead of one coating of the olive oil/garlic mix and bread crumbs, I will be doing 2 coats so it's a little crisper. This is seriously a tasty and simple meal. Chicken wasn't dry one bit! I used 6 cloves of garlic instead because we love garlic and it wasn't overpowering. Would even add more next time.

Great recipe. Easy prep from start to finish. The chicken had a subtle garlicky flavor and the texture was perfect due to baking. The best part was that my Husband and daughter who have extreme opposite food preferences both liked it.  Thank you.

One of our favorite chicken recipes. First time I made it I used shredded parm and it didn't stick so well. Now I use the grated parm and it's so good!

I doubled the amount of bread crumbs and cheese that it called for and since I didn't have Italian bread crumbs available I added separately some oregano and basil to the mix. Really simple, tasted great, definitely will be making this again.

Delicious!! I had 6 chicken breasts, so I used 1/3 cup olive oil, 7 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup each of Panko flakes and Parmesan cheese, and 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning. The chicken was done after 25 minutes. This will be added to my repertoire!

So delicious! I used the olive oil and garlic as the recipe says and also did a batch with Italian dressing instead and both were delish! Add extra bread crumbs and parm mixture over the top for extra crunch! Can't wait to make again!

Very moist and tasty. I suggest next time slicing the chicken breast in half horizontally because the chicken was a little thick and difficult for the breading to stay on.

I used Xtra Virgin Olive oil, about 1/4 cup - with  2tsps of minced garlic ...  patted the breasts dry, spooned on  the oil garlic mix, then put in the  Italian crumbs with  1/2 as much Parmesan Ch eese ...

Delicious.  thx to 'who commented about not putting the cheese in the first 7 x's then added and WOW... delicious!!

Thanks again Allrecipes...

I made this following the directions to T. I recommend turning the chicken over at the half way mark of your cooking  time. I used 4 ounce; average thickness boneless chicken breasts. They were cooked to perfection in 40 minutes. They were moist and tender. I will definitely make this chicken dish again.

Very tasty!  After reading some reviews I made some minor changes to the recipe.  After making garlic oil I let it sit for 30min prior to mixing it in a bag with the tenderized chicken breasts.  I marinated the chicken for 4 hours in the garlic oil.  I mixed 1/2 panko and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs and add onion powder, pepper, and seasoned salt.  I also made the gravy one of the reviewers listed by adding about 3 Tbsp butter to the pan prior to baking.  I collected the pan drippings and added 1 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/4 c water, and 1/4 cup milk then cooked it till thickened and added Parmesan cheese.  The gravy was plain and needs some spices.  Maybe next time I'll add some rosemary and pepper to the gravy.

Yum!!!! This is the best chicken I've ever made! I used salt, pepper and Montreal chicken seasoning on the chicken before coating it and for the garlic I used 2 teaspoons of minced garlic from the jar and it was PERFECT ??

I made this recipe as written and it turned out really well. It was a pretty simple and fast weeknight recipe to make. You just need to pair it with a couple tasty sides so that the overall meal doesn't seem bland. Also, it tastes better fresh out of the oven than it did the next day as leftovers.

This is my "go to" chicken dinner, especially when entertaining.  It is very easy to make and since I love garlic can adjust the amount to my liking.  Nothing bad to say about this dish.

Delicious. Will definitely make again.

My tweaks: I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts (I eat full-fat dishes, and my cholesterol is outstanding). With almost 2 lbs of chicken, however, I had to make two batches of the coating. The recipe provided plenty of the olive oil/garlic mixture for that amount of meat. With the small amount of leftover oil, I drizzled on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. I also used Kroger's Private Selection Parmesan & Herb Panko Bread Crumbs. I was a little worried about too much Parmesan, but it was excellent. I guess you can't have too much Parmesan. :-)

I made this according to the recipe and found the breading to be soggy.  Very disappointed.  I was hoping for a quick, go-to recipe for chicken breasts.

Sedona forget to sea on chicken before everything.  For me it was dry and flavorless.  I checked recipe and did it right.  I may try the recipe one more time and watch oven time.  Also add basil to the dry mix

I made it with gluten free bread crumbs and put extra garlic on top of the chicken before putting it in the oven. The chicken did not dry at all in the ovenâ which I usually find is an issue when cooking in the oven versus stovetop. Overall, this was a great meal and I will be cooking it again.

I don't rate many recipes since I usually only use them as a base, but other than adding a LOT more fresh garlic, I made this mostly as written and it was a quick and easy flavorful dinner! I added onion powder, parsley, black pepper and garlic salt to the coating since I only had plain crumbs. I pounded the chicken out so the breasts would cook more evenly, and they hit 165 at 20 minutes. They didn't brown as much as I would have hoped, but the meat was VERY moist, which was a pleasant surprise! I'll save this one for sure!

Made as directed. Good, but not great. Quick, easy, and all ingredients are in the pantry, so the four stars. Probably will make again, but add more garlic!

I made it last weekend and it came out really good. Unfortunately, I didn't have Parmesan cheese, instead I used shredded sharp cheese. It still came out good.  My youngest son had 2 chicken breast and he's a picky eater.  So I'll be making it again, that's for sure

I'm used to making traditional German/Polish schnitzel and this was a nice lighter change.  Very flavorful.  Everyone in the house gave thumbs up so overall it was a success:)

Super easy. I prepared the chicken in the morning and put it uncooked in the fridge. When my husband came home after work he put the chicken in the oven to bake, along with a side of mashed cauliflower. So yummy.

I didn't have Parmesan, so I substituted shredded Cheddar cheese. My husband said it was the best thing I've made in a while.

I made this according to the recipe. The chicken was tender but not crispy and very salty. I added no salt so the salty taste must have come from the Parmesan cheese. I will not be making this again

Excellent recipe! Added 5 spice in lieu of the Parmasan. Superb! After seeing other review (SAMMARTI) I'll certainly give The O. a go. Thank you for the easy to follow recipe.

I only had minced garlic and finely shredded parmesan, but this still turned out amazing!!!  I pressed the garlic flat so it wouldn't be too chunky, added onion flakes, then cooked at 450 for 20 mins. I served the chicken with seasoned asparagus and brown rice.

Went over very well with the familiy - said it was "just right".  I'm notoriously bad about actually measuring things, but I think it was pretty close to the recipe.  The ingredients and the process followed it anyway.  Another good one for the recipe file. Thanks!

I made as stated, using big garlic cloves.The chicken came out moist, but it was little bit bland for my taste. Next time  I make this, I would season the chicken with some salt and black or cayenne pepper, and add some  herbs to the breading.

super easy to make! I have even made a simpler way to make it. 

note: you're going to use more bread crumbs, olive oil, parmesan, and garlic than the recipe gives.

i always pound the chicken to nake it nore tender. Next I get a microwave bowl put the olive oil in it and instead of fresh garlic I just powdered garlic and I put it in the microwave for a 30 seconds. the rest of the recipe is the same. 

My way if cheating this recipe has never proved wrong. my family didn't even notice the difference and neither did I.

Used 12 chicken strips instead of breasts. Doubled recipe.  Used 1/2 cup olive oil and 4 garlic cloves,  1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Locatelli Parmesan.  Awesome!  Family raved!

This was quick, easy and really good. I had three good sized breasts and was close on breading. If I had four I would have been making more breading.

I made this exactly as written and thought it had zero flavor. Luckily I had made some Alfredo sauce to poor on it to try to save it. I felt like it needed some kind of additional seasoning...salt, pepper, garlic powder. It just needed something. Or maybe next time I would try it with butter or (as another reviewer suggested) Italian dressing instead of the olive oil. I also couldn't taste the garlic at all and I had put in extra. If a recipe needs certain seasonings that should be listed as part of the ingredients as I always try to make a recipe as written so I can give an honest review. Also I think the cooking time is too long as my chicken came out a little dry.

Absolutely amazing.  It smelled so good that once it was done baking it was immediately served and eaten immediately - I totally forgot to take a photo.  This will definitely become one of my go to chicken recipes.  So good and super easy.  Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe.

Very yummy! I did what another reviewer did, and I dipped my chicken in a beaten egg, then into the bread crumb/freshly grated parmesan mixture; placed into 9X13 baking dish, and poured the olive oil/garlic on top of the chicken. Made with mashed potatoes and a strawberry and spinach salad. 5 thumbs up! Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and Excellent. I did increase the garlic and used butter instead of olive oil and  corn flake crumbs in place of bread crumbs. Against the advice of another I used chicken tenderloins (that's all I had). However, I did reduce cooking time to 20 mins and reduced temp to 350. Only problem I had was the breading came off the bottom. Just scraped it out of the baking dish and put back on top.  Not sure how to correct that. Definitely will make again.

Loved this dish! just made it for the family and it was a hit. Only thing I did different was adding extra seasoning and I melted some mozzarella on top. Delicious.

This was delicious. I did use chicken  thighs instead just because they are so tender. Very good recipe. Everybody's  tummy was very happy.

We used a little less garlic than what's called for, but it turned out really well. It was easy to make and as someone who doesn't cook often I have to say I didn't know how it would turn it. However, my parents and I loved it and we'll definitely make it again.

This was a bit bland.  I think adding some basic Italian seasoning  or some no-fat italian dressing like another reviewer suggested would help.  Also, I think pan cooking the breaded chicken before baking would help to make the chicken crispier.

Super quick and easy to make. So glad I found this recipe. I used coconut oil and butter and let the chicken sit in the pan for a while to marinate. I eye-balled the  equal parts parm and bread crumbs.  Once in my baking dish, I stuck it in the fridge for a few hours. Everyone loved it.

I had plain bread crumbs, so that's what I used. To make up for it, I added Italian seasoning to the breading mix. I used 4 large cloves of garlic, rather than 2. I used a gallon sized ziplock and shook it to get the breading coating on.  My two year old was my "shaker." It was really good! I paired it with a cheesy rice and steamed green beans. I would definitely make it again!

Great recipe! By itself it is great, and I also added a bit of lemon juice to the oil and garlic mixture which was awesome. I also used butter instead of olive oil, which I thought gave it some more flavor. If you want to make it how the recipe goes, it is still a 5 star recipe.

A step up from Shake-n-Bake, similar but better tasting. Only change I make is to prepare  garlic/oil as far in advance as I can so  the oil is more flavorful. Other than that, nice step up from basic chicken night...something everyone will like.

Simple and delicious! Used GF rice crackers with the parm as the breading, and will certainly make this again! Only change perhaps: a little less olive oil.

This is one to save. Amazing flavor. I added a tbl sp of butter to the oil mixture and a couple pinches of sea salt to the breading. I cooked for 40 min. So amazing!

I have made this too many times to count now. I do sprinkle some shredded 3 cheese blend on top right before baking and wow does the flavor get another punch of yummy. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

I liked it but my husband thought it was fabulous, so based on that I'll give it five stars.  Even though I followed the recipe exactly, I thought it was a little on the bland side. Maybe next time I will follow another reviewers recommendation and sprinkle some chicken rub on the breasts first before dipping in oil/garlic and breading.  Overall though, an easy recipe that turned out pretty good.  Served with rice and sauteed yellow and zucchini squash,   would be great with pasta too.

Overall a great dish that was quick and easy to make! I took everyone's advice and went for the seasoned bread crumbs which were a great flavor addition. I wish that the bread crumbs were more binded to the chicken though.

Added a tablespoon of mayonnaise to the oil/garlic oil to make it a little more moist. Also used italian flavored breadcrumbs to mix with the Parmesan cheese. Boyfriend loved it! Definitely making it again!

This was quick, easy, and delicious. I might cut back on the olive oil a bit the next time, and I did increase the garlic (because my husband loves garlic). Other than that I followed the recipe. I had made it before using panko, but that didn't work as well. And Imdid use shredded Parmesan, not the stuff in the green box.

I made this last night for dinner......it was delicious!!!  Didn't make any changes, and will definitely make this again, but next time I'll slice the breasts in half and reduce the baking time. One half breast was a lot of chicken for a serving for me.

This is fantastic!!!!  The garlic and olive oil infused is just right!  The chicken dipped in this with the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese is the icing on the cake!!!  Don't change a thing!!!  I prepared this as written, and paired it with wholegrain angel hair pasta, a little olive oil, and red pepper flakes infused!!  Add steamed broccoli and you have a wonderful meal!!!  Definitely 5 stars!!!!!!!

This was amazing. I went a little differently with it. I used garlic and cheese croutons in place of bread crumbs along with the added cheese. I also fried them instead of baked due to shortage of time. and it turned out so good. definitely making this again.

This was really tasty, especially considering how extremely easy it was. I had to cook mine a little longer but maybe my breasts were just big :p

I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used plain and added some spices from the pantry. Otherwise I made it exactly as written. This will be put in my "super easy no fuss" recipe pile.

Easy and tasty.  This recipe saved the day when I hadn't anything planned except the chicken breasts waiting in the fridge.  All the family really enjoyed it.   (Thank you Carol!) The big appeal is that the ingredients are pretty much always on hand and so it is a great solution to those days when you need something in a hurry.  Next time I will certainly try the suggestion in Auntnett's review, i.e. to use italien dressing instead of the olive oil.

Dipped the chicken in egg, and then sprinkled the garlic on top of the bread crumbs, cooked about 40 minutes, very tasty.

I've been making this dish for many years now, before I saw the recipe here.

I use low fat/ non-fat italian dressing in place of the oil.  I add some red chilli flakes, garlic powder, and crushed black pepper to the breading mix, but I like things a little spicy.  Also, let the coated/breaded chicken rest in the fridge for 30 minutes, I feel like it helps the breading 'stick' better....but that just might be in my head.

I top the finished baked chicken with italian cheese blend and marinara sauce and bake for another ten minutes...kinda like chicken parm.  I love mushrooms, so I throw some sauteed mushrooms and onions on top before serving.  Never have leftovers.

Sorry that this isn't really a review of the recipe, hope I didn't offend the recipe author,  just thought I'd share.

I don't get why people are raving about this recipe. It's alright, but mine was pretty dry and didn't have a strong flavor. It's not bad, it just wasn't that great.

Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best, and this one is simply delicious. Don't leave out the Parmesan, I think that's what makes this so heavenly !!

After reading the reviews, I added these changes.  I had 5 pieces of chicken drump sticks so used 1/3 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 c. parmesan cheese, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, since I didn't have Italian bread crumbs.  I used 4 cloves garlic, and let the oil and garlic sit awhile in a bag with the chicken.
My husband loved it.  I baked it on 350 for 55 min.  I should of had the heat higher maybe 375 as that's what I usually set my temp on for making chicken, but had a new oven so still trying to figure it out.  I for sure would make this again.

I heated a saucepan and threw in a little butter to pan fry the chicken before moving it to the oven. Turned out amazing! I ran it as a special at my restaurant and was told it was the best chicken ever made! This recipe got me a job offer

Very good! I added marinara sauce at the very end. Once the chicken was almost fully cooked, I covered them with marinara sauce and let it bake for 5 more minutes. Came out wonderful!

I followed someone else's recommendation of substituting italian dressing for the olive oil & garlic.  It made this recipe so much easier because there wasn't any prep cooking, just dip in the dressing, then into the breadcrumb mixture, then cook it.  My supermarket sells very large and thick chicken breasts in packs of 5, so I wound up butterflying the breasts & splitting them between me & hubby.  This recipe turned into 10 servings when served with 2 sides.

I thought this recipe was very tasty! I cut my chicken breasts in half and ended up using twice the amount of the Parmesan (from a green Kraft container)/seasoned Panko breadcrumb mixture. I ended up cooking the breasts for maybe 15-20 minutes over the recommended amount (so around 50-55 minutes total) because the breasts were fairly thick, and I am always concerned about underdone chicken. They were flavorful but not overwhelmingly so and had a nice texture.

Made per recipe. My wife really liked it but I didn't find it so special after reading the rave reviews on the site. It seems like an awful lot of fat in the recipe.  The flavor wasn't that special but the chicken was very moist. It was done at 167 at 23 minutes.

This is delicious!! Will be making again, but with the minor tweak of baking 23-26 min instead of 30. The oil, bread crumbs & cheese come together to make a wonderful tasty coating.

Wow, this was so easy to make, and the ingredients are all probably in the pantry.  It turned out extremely moist, and the garlic taste was mild, I will probably add a little garlic powder to the breading next time.

This recipe was incredibly easy and very tasty! I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs so I looked up a conversion for making plain into Italian,  which was quite simple. I also used a garlic press and  three cloves of garlic, rathering than mincing two cloves. Other than that, I pretty much stuck to the recipe and everyone really enjoyed the dish. I would highly recommend giving it a try.

Instead of just dunking the chicken in the garlic and oil, breaking it, and then cook the chicken I decided to pour the oil and garlic all of the chicken after it was breaded and placed in the baking dish. I also added about maybe another 1/2 of Parmesan over the chicken breasts and added salt and pepper. The garlic bits cooked very nicely, turning crispy and provided a great crunch element to the buttery chicken. Overall a great recipe, my family loved it!

Followed the recipe exact and the chicken came out relatively flavorless. I think butter should be substituted for the oil and it might taste better.

I don't understand the awesome reviews. I was so looking forward to this dinner as well as my husband. we made it exactly as written. Nothing special at all. Bummer..We won't be making this again, sorry. Not trying to sound rude, just wanted to make sure I gave my review on it. I rarely have negative reviews, but this is simply just plain Jane chicken.

The bread crumbs did not crisp up like they do when you fry chicken on the stove but I appreciated the healthier alternative to my usual breaded chicken recipe. My family of six enjoyed it!

This was absolutely  great! It was quick and easy, and not to mention my entire family (even the picky eaters) loved it. I did add 1/4 cup more of the olive oil (as I had seen in a previous review) and I used the minced garlic (the kind from the jar) and added 1/2 teaspoon more, but that's just because I love garlic! Can't wait to make this again!

This was so easy and delicious! I made mushroom couscous and a mushroom shallot chicken gravy to go on top and oh my yummy! My husband and father in law LOVED it. The left over chicken was even good the next day.

Absolutely delicious.   Brine the breasts for 15-30 minutes first with some salt and aromatics. Be sure to rinse!  Skipped that step last time and was met with disastrously salty results!

Brining will make them taste so very juicy, regardless of the fact this is white meat.

I am not sure about this recipe.  As with all new recipes I followed it to the letter, because I think that it is better to try it out before tweaking it.  However, I am not sure if I will make this again.  The chicken I used turned out quite dry and chewy and the flavour of the parmesan cheese seemed to overpower the taste of the chicken.   Even so, I liked the idea of coating it in garlic oil and then seasoned breadcrumbs, so if I do it again I will omit the cheese and then bake it for slightly less time to prevent it from being dry.

It was great. Substituted panko bread crumbs, my own Italian herbs and did the 3-step standard breading.

I used basting oil from wegmans as the oil and added a heaping teaspoon of pre-chopped garlic. Delishous flavor, but I used MASSIVE chicken breasts so it definitely took the whole cooking time. Next time, smaller chicken breasts for sure.

great tasting recipe! I don't really like chicken but this was a good balance of light and savory. I increased most of the ingredient amounts but that was just personal preference. You can never really have too much garlic/parmesean/bread crumbs.

I made this recipe last night and we both liked it. I baked it at 375Â°F. I was expecting a little more garlic flavor, when I make it again I'll crush more cloves of garlic. I will make it again. I used Panko Italian bread crumbs.

So glad to find this simple yet delicious recipe. Perfect for those days when you've defrosted boneless, skinless chicken breasts yet have nothing else to jazz them up with.  As other reviewers said, double up on the garlic and breadcrumb, cheese mixture for a company worthy dish!

It was good, but a bit meh.  Would do again if i needed something in a pinch.  Note I did not use oil with garlic cloves i used crisco flavored garlic oil to marinade the chicken in before cooking.

My entire family loved this recipe!  Ages 4,8, 38, and a secret I won't tell lol. I told the kids it would be like a home made chicken nugget haha. This is absolutely delicious and very easy. I can make it after work in no time at all and we are all eating at a reasonable time. Best part is my husband thinks I worked hard making dinner. It makes me feel like those ads for rice krispie squares! This works well with regular bread crumbs as well and fresh or garlic in a jar.  Never skip the parm!

My husband loves this recipe.  I crush butter and garlic croutons for the breading.  I also sprinkle extra granulated garlic and parmesan cheese on once I have the chicken in the pan.

Loved it and it was super easy! I used more Italian bread crumbs and used more garlic, so just a light tweak for our personal tastes.

Very tasty.  I did not use the cheese and I only slightly breaded the chicken in an attempt to make it a little healthier.  This coupled with some sauteed veggies makes for a quick and delicious meal.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out very bland. It's very garlicky, but the cheese and bread crumbs did nothing for the dish. Im looking for low carb meals for my weight loss and this was a huge disappointment.

I'm easily bored by chicken so i'm always trying to find new recipes and this was good. I cooked it for 30 min and it was fine for the thicker breasts but some were a bit thinner and they were slighty more done than it should be ( overcooked chicken is really bad in my opinion). It did need more garlic and a bit more seasoning for my taste but overall a good and easy recipe

For being so simple, this turned out great! I added some salt and Italian seasoning to breadcrumbs forward added flavor. Also, used bottled minced garlic. My husband is not a big fan of chicken, but told me to keep this recipe!

Made this for dinner last nite. I agree, don't omit the parmesan cheese. I loved the idea of the garlic and olive oil before bread crumb mixture. I will be making this a lot! :-)

I didn't like the greasy taste from the olive oil. Someone suggested low fat Italian dressing and I think I'll try that next time.

This was pretty good. It didn't blow my mind away but I don't really have any solid complaints either. I didn't have to cook it as long as the instructions said to do and the breading quantities were perfect. I will be making it again, mostly because it was so easy and it does taste good, just not phenomenal enough to get a five.

easy to make, and we all loved it.  I did have to double the bread crumb/cheese mixture to cover all my chicken breast pieces.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and he loved it. I used 1 1/2 TBS of minced garlic and I had to add a little bit more bread crumbs to the mixture once i got to my last 2 halves. But overall it is easy and yummy!

Very good!  I used Panko bread crumbs for a delicious crunch.  I may try serving this with a creamy sauce next time.  Seemed to be missing a little something.

The chicken was very moist and tender and tasted great with some additional seasonings. I added red pepper flakes and rosemary to the garlic/oil. I marinated the chicken in a plastic bag with the oil for about an hour. I added Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper to the crumbs/parm. I only made 2 breasts, but needed more than 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup parm cheese. The temp seemed too high, so I baked them at 375 for 20-25 min (I used thin breasts) and put under the broiler for 5 min to brown the crumbs.

I can't, for the life of me, figure out why the ratings are so high for this chicken.  Yes, it was very easy to make, but there is nothing special about this recipe (I followed the recipe exactly), and I probably won't make it again.  I guess it's not that it tasted bad... it was just boring.  The leftovers were soggy and not very good, so if you make this, make what you need and don't make extra.

This chicken came out so moist, my boyfriend and I loved it! I added a little salt to the bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture and about 4 cloves of garlic to the olive oil. I paired it with roasted broccoli and called it a night! I will definitely be making this again.

I added a tablespoon of white wine to the oil/garlic mix, superb. Also I used a 3rd cup rather than a 4th for the oil, breadcrumbs and parmesan. These changes add more of an exotic flavor to the chicken!

I make the same recipe except I dip my chicken breasts in creamy italiam dressing (omitting the oil) and I make sure to use the package shredded parmesan cheese (dairy/cheese isle) instead of the grated kind in the dry isle of the grocery store.

Super Easy to make!!  Smelled delicious, tasted great too.  I added a little garlic and onion powder to the bread crumb cheese mix, and seasoned the Chicken breast w/ a little sea salt, pepper, and paprika, before putting in the oil w/ garlic.  Unfortunately there were No leftovers...i was looking forward to bringing some in for lunch tomorrow.

Simple and quick, definitely making this again.  Instead of bread crumbs I used corn meal (GF) which still resulted in a tasty dish.  Fresh parmesan highly recommended--I bought a jar instead of grating it, for convenience.

I really love this recipe, it's simple, quick, uses stuff I have on hand, and is really tasty. I recommend pounding out the thickest part of the chicken breast to start out so it's an even thickness (it bakes more evenly). I did this this the first time exactly as written, and the second time used pork chops instead of chicken, and added a sprinkle of sage and some black pepper.  Either way, it's a definite keeper.

I was honestly surprised at how tasty this was! Everyone loved it. The only thing I didn't like was that we smelled garlic for two days in our house. Probably should prepare during a season in which we can open windows. ha!

WOW! This was terrific and so easy to make! I made just as stated. I had 3 chicken breasts, if you are going to have 4, may want to make little extra seasoning. My kids are really picky eaters and they LOVED it too! Cooked for 30 minutes, it was perfect. LOVED IT! Thank you Carol for this recipe!

I served my 12 year old picky eater her plate first and by the time I made my husband and myself a plate and sat down at the table I had to ask what happened to her piece of chicken?? Completely gone!! She devoured it!! Extremely moist and flavorful!! Made exactly as directed!! One of the BEST pieces of chicken I've ever tasted!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!! :-)

Aaamazing and so easy!I seasoned the chicken with a little paprika, salt, and pepper, and used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. This is a great week day meal.

Sooo good and very easy to prepare! It didn't take me 20 minutes to get everything ready and in the oven. I added a sprinkle of chicken seasoning and a little lemon pepper over the breasts before baking them. It's great for those trying to watch their carbs but still miss that breading every now and again.

Sweet baby Jesus, one of the best tasting, easiest chicken recipe's I've ever tasted.  I used large flat chicken tenderloins and cooked it a few minutes less than required. My wife thought it was the best chicken she'd ever tasted.  Had purple, red and yellow baby potato's for side. Boiled the potato's for 10 minutes, mixed a little olive oil and lipton onion dry soup mix. Nice, healthy, filling meal.

This is a great simple recipe! However, I also added extra garlic and had to make the Parmesan and bread crumb mixture three times to cover my chicken breasts. (I used two big breasts cut into more manageable pieces) Family loved the taste!

I have made this several times. I just love the garlicky goodness and it's moist and flavorful . A satisfying and easy to make dinner entree. Tweak it to your own taste. A keeper.  ( I add a little salt and fresh ground pepper just before I pop it in the oven.)

Very easy and delicious. I followed a suggestion and used butter instead of oil. I'm not sure if this changed the flavor much, but this recipe is a keeper! My family is not a huge chicken-eating family. Usually when I cook chicken, it's in the crock pot so that it doesn't dry out. We were pleasantly surprised that this recipe is juicy and full of flavor. It was approved by everyone... including 3 little kids. My husband (who grew up completely on beef) was quite surprised at how much he liked this recipe. Thank you for the simply, delicious recipe!

I truly had high hopes for this.  Things I liked about it were that my 9 year old granddaughter was able to help me make it, and that was lovely. She was able to squeeze the limes and combine all the spices which was a fabulous, natural lesson in fractions.   I also liked it that our granddaughter who likes just plain meat really enjoyed this.  On the other hand, I thought the recipe was just short of tasteless.  We made the recipe nearly as stated except we used fresh thyme instead of dried and we cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces in the hope that the flavoring permeated the meat better.  We served it over brown rice and spooned the sauce from the pan over it.  That, for me, was the good part as the sauce was very tasty.

This has become my  " breaded chicken" recipe....for years I made a recipe from BonApetit magazine, this is just as good with less steps.  Plus, dipping the chicken breasts in warm olive oil with garlic is the  way to go!

Wow so good!!! Loved it, after cooking for 25 minutes, I poured homemade tomato sauce over the chicken and added Mozzarella cheese to cook for the last 10 minutes.  Cooked spaghetti and had a great meal!!!! will be making this again.

This was great! I never follow recipes, I just read the recipe and all the reviews and then eyeball it. I used minced garlic from the jar and added romano cheese in with the parmesan along with salt & pepper & garlic powder. I also pounded the chicken, because the breasts I used were very thick. The chicken was moist and juicy.

This recipe was so easy, quick, and tasted amazing! I added a little bit more Parmesan to the bread crumbs...it was great.  My six year old loved it too (which can be a hard task).

I have made this dish so many times I'm actually sick of it. The reason I keep making it, is BC my husband can't get enough of it. By far his favourite. And you can cook it alongside anything. Pasta, grilled veggies, etc.

This was delicious!  First I made the chicken as is and then I made some marinaded in low fat Italian dressing. They both tasted great however the Italian dressing one has a lot less fat.  I also recommend using a pan with a raised rack because the breading gets soggy and sticks to the pan from the chicken juices.

Absolutely excellent. We eat a lot of chicken and rarely find a recipe that we love. The only thing we changed is that we pounded out the breasts thinner, added a little italian seasoning to the breading and put a little fresh grated parmesan on top, just because we happened to have some. Cooked it for exactly 20 mins @ 425 degrees. Perfect!!!

Easy to make...Tasty... Healthy.  What's there not to like? :)  My kids loved it as well. 8 year old son said it was delicious.  Served steamed broccoli and knorrs noodle side with dish.

We love this recipe.  I do use Italian bread crumbs and let the garlic sit in the oil for about an hour before I use it.

I used Canola Oil instead of olive oil and thought it tasted great! I had spaghetti and marinara sauce leftover from the other night and decided to pour the sauce over the chicken and eat it with the spaghetti. It made for some delicious chicken parm. It by no means NEEDS this sauce, I had a piece on its own and it was great! Next time though, I will use olive oil and see if it affects my rating.

First review. I was looking for a quick and easy way to cook some chicken without leaving the house. At first glance I thought this recipe was weak, but after seeing all the reviews, I figured what the heck. No dice. Soggy bottom crums, marginally moist chicken and a grumpy wife. 

The proper way to cook this dish would be to add salt and pepper to the chicken, dredge in flour, dip in egg wash, dip in bread crumb and cheese mixture, pan fry each side to brown and stick in the oven to finish.

It was so good! :D I made this for myself :) I used 3 cloves of garlic but would prefer more. Used panko bread crumbs with some spices like paprika and salt! Baked it for 30 minutes, awesome recipe!

I wanted to love this because of all the great reviews but it had no taste . Maybe next time I'll season the chicken with some salt and not cook as long. I didn't like it.

This chicken is surprisingly moist and flavorful. I did make a few changes from the suggestions of other reviewers to the recipe mainly I added more garlic (more than 2 tablespoons for two thick pieces of chicken) and I let the chicken marinate in the olive oil garlic mixture for about 30 minutes. I also added some fresh grated parmesan cheese to the top of the chicken for the last 5 minutes and flipped it half way through the cooking. I would reccomend keeping an eye on the chicken because 30-35 minutes may be too much time (I cooked my chicken for 35 minutes but the breasts were very thick).

Nice recipe! I used 6 regular sized cloves for two chicken breasts. I will probably add more next time cause we love garlic, but it was an easy recipe and definitely worth making again!

First time making this and followed the recipe.  The chicken presents well and is tender however, lacks flavor.  I would add seasoning to the chicken before breading and add seasoning to the breading as well. Next time, I will add salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika to the chicken and Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.

Quick, easy & delicious! I did add a handful of panko bread crumbs to the seasoned bread crumbs for extra crunch & a tablespoon of butter to the olive oil mixture to make the sauce a little richer. The fresh grated Parmesan was great in this dish! Paired this dinner with a salad & simple roasted broccoli! My husband loved it!

Easy recipe! Next time I will hammer out the breasts a bit to cool more evenly because the breasts I got were quite large. Everyone loved it! It paired nicely with red potatoes with dill.

This is the best baked/fried chicken recipe I have ever found! I am a Lo-carb dieter so I made my bread crumbs fresh from Lo-carb white bread (6 carbs per slice).  I mixed the Parmesan in the bread crumb along with a dash of sea salt & ground pepper. I used Tyson frozen (& thawed) boneless breast tenders rather than the boneless breast. I dipped them in the olive oil & crushed garlic then into the bread crumbs & parmesan.  I placed the breaded tenders onto a cookie sheet that I had brushed with olive oil. I then turned them half way through the baking process in order to get them nice and crunchy baked on both sides. I can eat this dish without the guilt since I made the bread crumbs fresh with lo-carb bread slices. And the good thing is...my family loved them and didn't even realize that they were eating healthy fried chicken!

This was DELICIOUS!! So simple to make and a crowd pleaser to boot! The chicken was so tender and juicy, which blew my mind as I always tend to dry out chicken breasts when I bake them. The only (and I mean ONLY) changes I made to this (I just couldn't help myself- I always make changes) was to add a little bit of Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the bread crumb/cheese mixture. I would've used Italian bread crumbs but I didn't have any on hand... I served these with garlic mashed potatoes, and while we all had garlic breath for the rest of the night, man was it worth it.

Hub and I loved it.  Needed more bread crumb/parm for all of the chicken (2 lbs - 8 cutlets).  Added S&P, basil and oregano to the plain bread crumbs.  Also added crushed red pepper to the garlic oil.  Only needed 15 minutes at 375 (for thin cutlets).  Will use this for chicken parm and a number of other things as the "base" recipe.  This is a keeper!

I made this for the first time and I loved as well as my husband! Except I pan fried the chicken with olive oil and white wine just browning it alittle bit and to give it the chicken alittle bit more flavor, I also used minst garlic and sliced and saudted onions and added it with the chicken and lastly I used the remaining sauce to cover the bottom of the pan to keep more moisture for the chicken.  It was delicious!  Made it with asparagus an garlic mashed potatoes! I will definitely be doing this again

This was AWESOME!!!!  My husband hates when I try new recipes because you're never sure how they will turn out but this was a winner!  I did use Italian breadcrumbs but followed the recipe otherwise.  I was a bit disappointed that there were NO leftovers though!!!

Very simple to make and tastes amazing! There is no reason why you should never know what's for dinner because you probably have these simple ingredients on hand. If you don't like parmesan try it with Romano.

Turned out pretty darn tasty. I do recommend adding salt to the chicken breasts before you coat them with the olive oil and Parmesan.  Additionally, I filleted the breasts before coating them. Quick and easy! Make sure you heat up the olive oil and garlic, makes a big difference in taste. I also used Panko bread crumbs.

Super easy setup.  I set the chicken out to marinade in some italian dressing with minced garlic, and used roasted garlic breadcrumbs.  So tasty!  Super moist and delicious.

I tried the recipe as soon as I read it because I had most of the ingredients and I had exhausted all the ways I knew to prepare chicken. Did not have bread crumbs so I toasted a slice of whole wheat and grater-ed it into the cheese.  I topped it with Parmigiano Reggiano because I thought the cheese would not provide enough salt,  so which turned out a bit too salty - so next time I'll follow the recipe exactly.
I plan on making it again for Sunday dinner.

This was definitely easy, but it was mediocre compared to the rock star reviews. I thought the garlic-olive oil coating was gona knock my my socks off but it was just average. maybe next time I'll use 2 cloves instead of just one.  i precoated the chicken in flour and also added onion powder, season salt & pepper to the italian breadcrumb mixture. We will most likely try this again for an easy dish, but will tweak it for a just a liiiittle bit more garlic flavor! I'm going to research the reviews & get some helpful hints.

Very easy recipe and tastes good, but make sure not to overcook it or it will be dry. I served it with pasta sauce, without something to dip it in it's dry anyways. I've used this recipe twice so far!

I tend to add a little more garlic than the recipe calls for, but the recipe is great. Combine with some steamed veggies and a reasonable serving of rice, this makes a pretty delicious, low cal dinner.

Such a good recipe the way it is. I made these as a coating for chicken wings instead of on chicken breast. SO good. The coating forms nice crunchy outside so you don't have to deep fry the wings.

I have updated my rating from liked it to loved it. My whole family liked this recipe. It was so moist I could even give chunks to my 1 year old. I used 2 half breasts for the bread crumbs and parmesan because that is what I had thawed. The recipe is simple enough I did not make any changes. This recipe is really easy and has such a wonderful flavor.

This is my new "go-to" recipe.  I am a Frat House cook.  I made it last week for 30 students and they raved about it.  I can't wait to have company and show off this recipe.  It was easy and impressive.

Absolutely amazinggggggg! I've tried a lot of chiken recipes because I get tired of making the same things all the time. But I don't think I will ever get tired of this one. The chicken is moist and flavorful but crunchy on the outside. It is extremely easy to make. I found minced garlic soaked in Olive oil so I use a lot less oil. I'm going to try it with crushed Gaelic next time!  I give this 10 stars!

This recipe is great!!!  The first time I made it my husband said it was the best chicken ever!!  We use Italian Seasoned bread crumbs and Kraft Parmesan Cheese.  I cut my chicken breast in half long ways and it only takes 15 minutes in the oven.  Definitely a family favorite!!!

Just made this recipe tonight for
the first time- and my family and I loved it! I used thin
chicken breasts. I followed the recipe exactly just seasoned the chicken before after dipping in the olive oil/garlic mixture w/black pepper and onion powder then proceeded to press the chicken into Italian planko crumbs
and parmesan/Romano grated cheese mixture.  It
was light & delicious!  Next time I'll blend the olive oil and garlic together and then let the chicken sit in it for 30 mins to see if it tastes moister and even better. Delicious!!

This recipe was absolutely delicious, and very easy to make! It was a hit in my house. I doubled the recipe (I had five large breasts which I cut in half) and it worked out just fine. I did add salt and pepper to the breasts before I coated them and I used italian style bread crumbs. This one is a winner.

It was yummy! The only differences I did was that I pounded the breasts first and then after it was done roasting, I broiled the top so it can have a crustier finish.

Very good and tasty! I used thin chicken cutlet so next time I won't cook it so long. Will definitely use this on a regular basis! Also I used pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan, it has a better flavor.

This chicken was juicy, tender and delicious! Because I'm lazy, I poured the warmed olive oil and garlic into a baggie with the chicken breasts and just mooshed it around, then used a second baggie for shaking the pieces in the dry mixture.

I used seasoned bread crumbs, parm and granulated garlic. Because we had 5 large chicken breasts, I ended up needing more coating mixture. Just sprinkled extra of each on top of the pieces and then drizzled with a bit of olive oil. Took 35 minutes for those 5 large breasts to be cooked perfectly.

I've made similar dishes with butter and bread crumbs/crackers, but I'd never tried it with olive oil. I'm sure it would work well for pork chops, too. Very easy and very yummy!

Who knew?! We've been doing this to wild Alaskan halibut (just bake it about 10-12 min./ till it flakes with fork) for years with exceptional results. One BIG CHANGE (for chicken and fish): substitute finely crushed goldfish crackers for breadcrumbs--little kids love "helping" crush them and they impart a little extra cheesiness :-). To reduce time in the oven for chicken, either precook 5-10 min. in microwave or pan cook over medium heat about 10 min. before breading. You can't lose with this easily adaptable, delicious recipe! (If using fish, have malt vinegar on hand.)

I let the chicken marinade in the garlic mixture overnight - it made it so tender and juicy!

love love love this recipe! the flavor of the garlic soaks all the way through the chicken. if using larger breasts, you may want to cook them a little longer...almost 45 minutes.

This was delicious and flavorful!  The oil and breading helped hold the moisture in.  Beware however, that 30 minutes may not be enough time if the chicken breasts are large.  Next time, I will either pound them or cut them in smaller pieces so they will bake faster.

This recipe is really good! I cut the chicken up into strips, so I used a little more breading than the recipe calls for. But it has a great taste and a yummy crunch!

This recipe is terrific!  It's delicious and incredibly easy, and uses ingredients we always have on hand.  I thought the garlic would be overwhelming, but it mellowed as it roasted.  We did have to use twice the amount of parmesan and breadcrumbs than the recipe stated.

I loved it. It was really good. I love garlic but am not a huge fan of parmasan so I was a bit nervous. I had a couple of very little pieces done way before others and when I tried them, I was so thrilled.
I used butter like some reviews suggested here and I put lots and lots of garlic. I also used panko bread crumbs cause that's all I had. I personally like panko better than other bread crumbs anyway.
This is definitely a keeper. Oh, the only thing that I wasn't too crazy about is the time. I had to cook mine way too long. I don't know if it's our oven or the breast size or what but after 30 minutes, my chicken was not done at all. I think I left them in for at least 45 to 50 mins which dried out a couple of smaller pieces. I think next time, I would use tenderloins rather than breasts and cut down the cooking time.

Easy to make and a nice change from our regular chicken recipes.  I took the advice of one of the other members and used Italian salad dressing and extra garlic instead of olive oil.

This is seriously my new favorite chicken recipe.  It is delicious and quick enough for a weeknight dinner.  Definitely make extra as you will definitely want leftovers.  Excellent on a salad of mixed greens with whatever veggies you have on hand (I used cucumbers, heirloom tomatoes, olives and red onion) with balsamic vinaigrette.  This recipe is five stars all the way.

All I can say about this recipe is the chicken was moist and tasted like garlic.  Otherwise, very bland.  Needs salt or some other seasoning.  Will not be making this again.

I made this dish following the directions exactly (cooked 30 minutes) and it was really good. Except with the measurements listed, it was only enough for 2 large chicken breasts. I will definitely make this again.

Oh this was so easy and yummy, I opted for melted butter instead of olive oil and just put the chopped garlic ( I cheated and used bottled pre-minced garlic) and butter in the microwave to heat and bring out the garlic flavor then dipped the chicken in that then the bread crumb ( I used italian flavoured) and parm cheese mix - oh so good

Absolutely awesome!  Made the recipe nearly as is, but added Italian breadcrumbs.  Probably not much of a difference, but the chicken was juicy and so delicious.  We had a party of six and they all raved!

I am not sure why this has such good reviews.  I followed the recipe to the T the breading was flavorless and the chicken was dry as well. I would probably not make this again unless I made some big changes to the seasoning.

I've made this for company. Very, tender and moist. You can prepare it a couple of hours in advance so there's no last minute mess in the kitchen

I used a garlic flavored olive oil- which was convenient, but next I will sautÃ© the garlic in the oil next time. The chicken came out moist and the crust was nice and crunchy. Good, but not great.

This was probably one of the easiest dinners ever. The only change I made was to add more Parmesan. My husband could hardly wait, since our house smelled so good. Over the years I have learned that chicken gets overcooked easily, so I only cooked it for 25 minutes. As a side dish I made the Grilled vegetables with Balsamic Vinegar, which I added to the oven for the last 15 minutes. Everything turned out perfect.

This recipe, as is,was nothing special. It was a stretch for me to dredge chicken in butter and definitely not worth it. Other than changing butter for oil, I made this as is. Oh, yes- I may have added Italian spices also.

I thought this recipe was average. The garlic fried in oil as a base for dipping the chicken for the breadcrumbs to adhere to caught my eye- but unfortunately my chicken stuck to the tray! Not sure if using baking parchment paper would have remedied this.  What made this good was the garlic- the breadcrumbs and cheese were average.  Has inspired me to add garlic to other breaded chicken recipes though!

Used garlic infused olive oil and this was simply amazing!! My family absolutely loves garlic and we are never with out fresh garlic cloves, so mincing fresh garlic is always the best! (I always use extra ;) )

This was great but when I do it again I will definitely slice my chicken breasts in half horizontally, it doesn't work well with thick chick breast.

I made this recipe exactly the way it was described and it was wonderful.  I usually over cook chicken to make sure it is completely cooked through.  I had faith in this recipe and tested it after 30 minutes and it was finished beautifully.  Tender and moist.  I will add this to my recipe book. Thanks!

P.S. I also baked the "Roast Potatoes" recipe from AllRecipes.com simultaneously with the chicken and what a great meal!

My hubby gave this 5 stars, which is high praise from him!  My kids and I gave it 4+.  I followed the recipe exactly using grated Parmesan cheese from the refrigerator section of the grocery store as opposed to the powdered stuff. I only wish I had made more so we could eat the leftovers!

This recipe is highly over rated and I'll never make it again. I followed it to the T.  Really bland flavors; a lot more needs to go into it to pass as anything close to something that anyone should highly recommend.  I'm irritated I wasted money on high quality, organic chicken breasts for this- It was a waste.

Use crushed or minced garlic to ensure the oil is thoroughly infused with garlic.  I thought it was pretty plain, but hubby liked it.  I wouldn't use it if we were were entertaining for dinner.

Chicken was very moist and tender, not extrememly flavorful though, would make again but may need to add more seasonings to cheese breadcrumb mixture.

Well, the chicken is most and there's lots of garlic flavor.  All plusses!  We just thought a bit of salt would have been a nice touch.  Will definitely make again and try that as well.  I agree with another review - don't skimp the parmesan.  That adds a great dimension to the flavor.

Thanks for posting-this was really good!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the bread crumb mixture.  I had plain bread crumbs but I thought it would be a little bland with just that and Parmesan so I added in a few sprinkles of onion powder, oregano, basil, paprika and red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I baked it for 30 minutes and let it rest for the remaining 5 minutes.  The chicken came out moist and it smelled AWESOME while cooking.  Served it with mashed potatoes and some mixed veggies.  Yep - I will definitely be making this one again!

Kidlets and DH LOVED it! To be honest, I did use more garlic than listed...I used 2 T. minced garlic that I blended with the olive oil (but my family LOVES Garlic). The smell was fantastic and the taste was phenomenal! It is definitely a keeper!

I love garlic, so I used probably double or triple the amount called for.   I let sit in olive oil on stove for a few minutes.... mixed shredded cheddar with italian breadcrumbs...   topped with more cheese once coated... came out great

Very good recipe. Only difference in mine is that I used half a cup of parmesan to 1 cup of bread crumbs. Had to end up making more parmesan crumb mixture, though.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the advice of some of the reviews and used butter instead of olive oil. I also dusted some garlic powder in the parmesan and bread crumb mixture. As per reviews, I covered the baking dish with aluminum foil to keep the chicken from drying out. Everyone loved it!

My family and I loved this recipe. It was so easy! I made a couple of changes because of what I had on hand. I used chicken thighs and Panko bread crumbs. I think I will always use Panko bread crumbs because the crunch is insane! It made the house smell so good with the aroma of garlic. Great recipe! Take my advice, you will want to double or triple this recipe.

Really good...really juicy. I used some of the pre-packaged breadcrumb & cheese w/bacon mix for coating as i had it in fridge & needed to use. Baked in my little dome oven about 20 min flipping once. Coating got nicely crunchy & adhered to chicken well. Used a little more o/o & garlic than called for with 3 pieces. Also added some tony's creole seasoning. All i can say is yum! Will definitely be making again a lot! Quick & delicious! Thanks Carol!

For a quick, easy recipe, this one is right up there on top.  Made it last night, and we loved it.  You could add garnish to spice it up, I put on Tony Chachere's, the southern spice we put on everything...

I really liked this! We've made something similar to this with egg, flour and breadcrumbs, but with the olive oil and garlic as the base then the breadcrumbs and Parmesan,this was awesome! The olive oil keeps the chicken tender and even with as much garlic as I actually added (more then recommended for 2 breasts of chicken) the garlic wasn't overpowering. I let the breadcrumbs get crispy in the oven (2 thin breasts of chicken, 30 min and the breadcrumbs crisped right up). It gave it that extra crunch. I saw that the recipe picture was served with veggies, which is probably a better idea. I served it with some linguine (just olive oil and parm mixed in, no sauce) and it was really good! My husband's Italian so I had to do the pasta! I'd definitely recommend this. Try it. It's so quick and easy.

Loved it! I only did 2 chicken breasts, but did not cut down on the amounts; found it to be just right. Added some oregano, garlic and onion powder, and black pepper to the plain bread crumbs, too. I did pound my chicken a litttle, to make it easier to cook evenly, and I actually marinated the chicken breasts in the olive oil/garlic cloves for a couple of hours. Really tasty, and super-easy!

My family loved this and they are a picky bunch! Used olive oil will try butter next time.  The smell of garlic lured them form the woodwork and I didn't have enough.  This is a do over for us.

We used Panko bread crumbs and it was really crunchy! I like to crumble a little dried parsley in just for the added color, and we salt and pepper the chicken a little before coating. Thanks for this recipe.

A great way to excite your plain old chicken dinner.  The flavor and moisture of the chicken is surprising!

This was delicious. I substituted the bread crumbs for crushed up club crackers and crushed up doritos. I also used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated. It was so amazing. I can't wait to make this again.

This is the best chicken ever! I have made this recipe so many times now and my whole family always looks forward to it. The chicken is very moist and flavored. You won't be disappointed

How could I not try this with all the positive reviews? As it turns out, my family loved it and asked for it again. Simple and delicious. My favourite type of recipe.

I followed the recipe, but this was not a hit for our family. I used the breast filets instead of full breast and it was dry and lacked flavor. I may try it again with full breasts to see if it as good as everyone says....I'll update the review then.

Loved it! I added some fresh squeezed lemon jusice to the olive oil/garlic mixture and it turned out great. I also had really thick chicken breasts to I seared both sides of the chicken before sticking it in the oven.

For gluten-free folks: finely crushed potato chips make a good substitute for the bread crumbs--nice and crunchy with a good flavor.  Maybe it's just me, but any recipe that calls for dredging something in crumbs really underestimates the amount needed.  Same with this one--I ended up making more of the crumb+parmesan mixture so that there would be enough.  I also mixed the garlic and oil in a zipper bag and then let the chicken marinate in that for several hours.  Very tasty!

This chicken was so moist! On some of the breasts, I omitted the garlic as we have a "garlic hater" in the family, and they were still great with only olive oil and breadcrumbs. Thanks for a very simple and tasy recipe.

The chicken was crispy and moist. Will be making this again!

Very easy, fairly healthy and useful for when you're rushed. In keeping with my family's taste, I used more garlic, a mix of parmesan and romano and two types of bread crumbs -- seasoned Italian and homemade from a French loaf; the addition of the latter to make it crunchier. I've been keeping my eye out for simple recipes for my daughter who just graduated college and who claims she can't cook, and this is a good one for her.

I made this last night for my husband and myself and loved it.  I gave this 5 stars because of the flavor and ease of making this dish.  I used panko bread crumbs, boneless, skinless chicken thighs and after baking, put them under the broiler for a minute to brown them a bit more (they were in a metal baking pan).  Will definitely make again!

It was OK. Didn't have much flavor but I used real parmesan and Panko so maybe it would be better with flavored bread crumbs and the kraft shake-on parmesan? I may try again doing that.

This tastes so good and is surprisingly moist for chicken breast - not to mention, it's so easy to make! My hubby, very picky 5 1/2 year old, 2 1/2 year and even 15 month old love it!

I liked it BUT it lacks seasoning as is. Needs added salt, pepper, basil, or whichever spices you enjoy. And I cooked it for 30 minutes and would have to say it was a tad dry. I would recommend checking it after 25 minutes. I do love the garlic/olive oil warming mixture.

Made this for dinner the other night. It was good and my boyfriend and I enjoyed it but it was kind of bland. I did take the suggestions of others and add a little bit more garlic but it just didn't give it a ton of extra flavor. Overall the chicken was good.

I don't get why this is called 'Garlic Chicken', I didn't taste any garlic in this. It was still good, but I was expecting a garlic taste.

This is a great recipe because it is so quick and easy and tastes great.  My only advice is that it might be better with a marinara sauce on top, so that is what I will be trying next time.  And there definitely will be a next time. Yummy!

Great! Quick and easy week-night dinner (just whip up a pasta side and some veggies). My boyfriend and I both loved this, the olive oil gave it a nice crunch. It's key to warm the olive oil with the garlic! I just put mine in the microwave for 30 seconds or so. For a slightly healthier alternative, whip up two eggs with a few tablespoons of milk and dip chicken in that before coating in the bread crumbs.

Very good and easy.  I usually don't use all the parmesan/bread crumb mixture in a recipe like this.  In this case, I did.  We all liked it very much.

This was great for a last-minute, what's-in-the fridge meal. I actually only used half the bread crumbs and cheese, and it still came out delicious.

This recipe was good. I didn't have any Parmesan cheese on hand so I omitted it. Nonetheless a good recipe. Next time I'll add Parmesan and try the suggestion of warming the garlic in butter.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was easy and I will definitely make it again but I will only rate is as average. I only give 5 stars to knock my socks off flavor. Next time I will add a little salt and butter and saute it in a skillet on the cooktop instead of baking it in the oven.

This had a great garlic flavor but did not crisp up at all, even after putting it under the broiler during the last few minutes. It was more of a wet, soggy breading. I probably will not try this again.

I was looking for a healthier (and easier to clean up) alternative to frying breaded chicken cutlets. This is a great alternative. Shockingly, my picky husband and 4 year old also loved them. I've also added some panko breadcrumbs in addition to the regular breadcrumbs for a little added crunch and pecorino Romano cheese instead. All ways are equally good.

My husband said it was amazing, his new favorite chicken recipe! I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used dried minced garlic. Also substituted Italianbflavored bread crumbs. Yummy!! Thank you for sharing.

I'm new to cooking and now that I've made a few dishes, I decided to cook something that required ingredients that I already had and this was perfect! The chicken was so juicy and tender. I followed it exactly as the recipe states and wouldn't change anything. Next time I may look at some suggestions, but this was great!!

Not a bad recipe, but better as chicken fingers rather than a whole breast.  Rather bland and needs some dipping sauce.

Really easy. I love garlic so I used half garlic bread crumbs I had, and half panko bread crumbs with added Italian seasoning. Also, you don't need a 1/4 cup of oil. Just a few Tbls is enough. The chicken came out perfect! I will make this again for sure.

FABULOUS! Super easy and quick to make. I had unexpected guests, so I sliced the chicken breasts long-ways. Also, I allowed for the chicken to sit inside the zip lock bag for about 20 minutes before dipping it into the dry mixture. The olive oil gave it a great flavor after it baked.

The family loved it!  I used garlic extra virgin olive oil with a couple of teaspoons of chopped garlic, garlic and herb bread crumbs.  Took about 45 minutes at 425 in my gas oven. Fast and easy meal on a cold night. Thank You Carol!

We eat this at least twice a week!  A great great recipe.  I will throw in dried onion or chives in with the oil as well as the garlic.  Just whatever I have in the cabinet.  My husband and I just love this recipe!!

Great recipe! Simple and easy to do. I had some infused garlic oil, so I just used that instead of making my own for this recipe. The bottom of the chicken gets a little soggy, but the top is nice and crispy. I did spray the top of the chicken with an olive oil cooking spray to help it get a bit more brown and crispy. Chicken stays moist if you don't overbake. I had cut a few breasts in half for the kids (to make strips), and they were a tad drier than the whole breasts.

Made this the other day for dinnner and my husband and I loved it! Was hoping it tasted more garlic-y, but my husband thought it was perfect. I also added some melted mozzerella cheese on top of the chicken and made it even better! Thanx for recipe! Will defenately cook this again.

Made this last night and I thought it tasted great. I did read the reviews and did half salted butter half olive oil for the garlic to roast in.I also added salt to my bread crumb mixture. I also cooked it at 350 for about 30 min. One review said that cooking at 425 would be too hot and dry it out so I listened. Mine turned out SO MOIST! Almost too moist, I would rather my chicken have a crisp to the coating, I did turn temp up to 425 and cook for an addition 5 min. I would really recommend this, but you need to add salt. I will def make this again and hopefully can get the temp and time down so it will crisp up nicer next time.

This recipe was sooo good!!! This is the first time I made it, and im in love already... I drizzled garlic butter on top right befoe i cooked it and added more of the bread mix on top. And instead of cooking at 425, I cooked at 400. (425 semed a little hot for chicken.)Lastly, 10 minutes before it was done, I coated it with parmesan cheese. I'll definately be making this again!

I modified this recipe a bit, as I'm dieting.  I minced up 7 or 8 cloves of garlic, threw it in about a cup of Ken's Steakhouse light Northern Italian Dressing and marinaded in that.  Breaded it in a mix of Italian breadcrumbs, rosemary, oregano, freshly crushed black peppercorn and salt.  OH MY WORD...The smell alone while it was cooking was mouth-watering.  I paired it with a fresh ceasar salad and it was sooo tasty! Will be making this often.  My boyfriend said it's in his top 3 favorite meals! Note: I cooked this for 35 mins on 350.  I thought the temp might be too hot, but my breading probably would have browned up and crunched up nicer in the higher temp.

This was fantastic!  My husband loved it!  He said I could make this anytime I wanted.  And, that it is his new favorite chicken dish!
I passed this on to several people at work and they came back with the same rave reviews!  
Second best to the taste was the simplicity of preparing it!

This is SO GOOD. I followed the recipe except I used Italian bread crumbs in lieu of plain and I also added a half teaspoon of garlic powder to the bread crumb/parm mix. It added the right amount of kick for my garlic loving family.

In one word - DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe as close as I could (I only had 3 chicken breasts).  I sprinkled more breadcrumbs and cheese on top when they were in the pan.  30 minutes later, they were perfect and juicy.  Very easy to follow and even delicious the next day.  I'm going to share this recipe with everyone I know!!!!!  Thank you Carol!!

Every time I make this I use it on top of angel hair with marinara and Parmesan over the top.  It makes a very moist chicken with great flavor.

I made this for family and friends and they loved it! I did modify it slightly after reading some of the reviews. I used butter instead of olive oil as previously suggested, and I used minced garlic instead of crushed. I also marinated the chicken in a garlic marinade for several hours before cooking. everyone loved the flavor and tenderness of the chicken, and they wished I had made more. I will definitely be making this again!

This is so simple, and that's what makes it amazing!

Just a few notes for myself, and others if they are in a situation similar to myself.

1) I adjusted the servings for 2 since I only had 2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.  However, I did butterfly the chicken breast halves and found that the suggested measurements for the cheese and bread crumbs did not cover all the chicken, so if you are in a similar situation it may help to stick with the same amount of bread/cheese as measured by the original recipe.

2) I used garlic powder instead of cloves, simply because this was last minute and I did not have cloves! Still tasted awesome!

3) I cooked it at 350 for ~30 minutes instead of 425 because I thought that would be too hot, however I now realize the chicken would have been more crispy at 425.  Next time I will test it and bake at the recommended 425 mark.

Thanks Carol!

My family loved this recipe! I used extra breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese when coating the chicken and then served it with spaghetti.

Delish!  I've made this a few times now and it is awesome every time.  If you pair it with pasta and sauce, it reminds me of a light chicken parmesan.  Easy and Sooo tasty!

Unlike some of the reviewers I used freshly grated Parmesan (was I not supposed to?) and it was DELICIOUS! I made chicken for my family and used sliced eggplant for my own (salted and drained) and that was perfect. Baked exactly as long as the chicken! Served with fries and salad. Perfect quick dinner.

I really enjoyed this.  I did lower my oven temp to 375 and used bone-in chicken breasts.  They were perfectly moist and juicy.   I also used tons of garlic.  About 8 cloves, which was probably about 4 teaspoons.  I can't even describe the aroma in the house while the chicken baked.  Soooo Good!!

made it as specified. it was very easy and very good, but a little overcooked at 30 mins which is why I gave this 4 stars. I suggest checking the internal temp around 20 mins. thank you for sharing.

Tried this tonight and it was a nice alternative to the usual plain, breaded cutlets.  Only downsides were that I used a bit too much garlic, and it did taste salty due to the locatelli cheese i added to the breadcrumbs.  Overall, a 4.  I'd use less garlic and parmesan in the future. Give it a try!

I have been making a version of this for 30 years. 
Always use Italian crumbs , I use butter instead of oil. It can be made in the crock pot, when I get home from work, add 1/2-1 cup white wine, let it cook while making rice....delicious & moist...

I don't really care for chicken in general but this chicken was delicious. My family also agrees. I followed as written and it was really good. Since then I have tweaked it more to my taste. I use half butter, half olive oil, more garlic and I sometimes replace the plain bread crumbs with Italian seasoned. Definitely give this one a try!

I made this recipe recently. However, after beginning, I realized I had no breadcrumbs. So I just used flour, and mixed with the Parmesean cheese. Turned out great.I will have to try it again with the breadcrumbs. I'm sure it'll be even better!!

Delicious flavour, love the parmesan crumb. However, I found by dipping it in olive oil it came out of the pan quite greasy. Next time I will use egg to help the bread crumbs to stick. Really yummy!

This was a double thumbs up by both my kids!!  I think next time I may lightly season the chicken breasts prior to the start of the recipe for a little added flavor- overall, a really great and healthy dish!!  Thanks!!

Kids loved it.    My husband wasn't too sure, but he doesn't count because he eats Franks hot sauce on everything and the garlic cheese didn't really go with hot sauce.  It was good and really easy.  I will make this again!.  Only difference I cut my breasts into tenders and cooked for 20 minutes turned out perfect.

This dish was okay but it didn't blow me away. However, for the work and time involved it's worth the quick prep time and simplicity.

This dish was absolutely amazing! I didn't have regular bread crumbs in my cabinet so I substituted it for original chicken shake and bake. I was a little nervous how it would turn out but to my suprise, it was delicious!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it yesterday... My husband and I ate the whole thing! I used Panko instead of bread crumbs. The crunchier, the better! I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I just used a big spoonfull of minced garlic. You don't really have to follow the recipe. It's pretty self-explanatory. I can't wait to make this again!

Big hit; everyone loved it! My chicken breasts were a little thick, so I baked them for about 40min and they were still super moist and flavorful.

I made this almost exactly as stated.  I just added a little fresh pepper to the breadcrumb mixture.  It was wonderful and very easy.  My husband said it is a recipe he'll be asking for in the future!  2 Thumbs up!

I made this dish, and was extremely pleased!!!  My husband and children loved this very much!!!  Because of the garlic and butter (I replaced the olive oil with the butter), I did not have to season the chicken at all.  the fresh parmesean cheese was the "icing on the cake"!  I HAD to give this recipe to my sister!!!!!

I made this for dinner and everyone seemed to like it.  I had to add more crumbs and cheese though.  It did take longer to get the breading cooked to my liking, which in turn overcooked the chicken.

The flavor was good, but the chicken came out of the oven a bit "soggy".  May try sauteing it on the stove next time.

This is a great, easy recipe. I make it often. The oil keeps the chicken moist and tender. If you don't like garlic, you can leave it out and it's still delicious. I sometimes cut the chicken in strips and do it the same way--it bakes faster. I also sometimes top with pasta sauce from a jar and mozzarella toward the end of baking time for easy chicken parmesan.

Used half melted butter and half light olive oil. I then added powdered garlic(did not have fresh), Italian seasoning, and pepper then microwaved for 15 sec. I made the rest as instructed. I also used chicken tenders since that is what I had. I turned a few times while baking. It turned out lovely!

My husband walked in and said, "What are you cooking? It smells amazing and is wafting outside.  There are cats out here trying to get in.  I had to fight my way in."  (LOL)  Of course he was kidding about the cats, but not kidding about how good this dish smells -- and subsequently tasted.  Very tasty.

This recipe was great!  The chicken did end up a tiny bit dry so I may not cook as long next time.  Will make a sauce or gravy to pour over the chicken next time.

Fast, easy, yummy, and perfect EVERY time. I cook it exactly like the directions say to and even my 5 year old who hates meat will eat this. Delicious and no guilt because there's no frying.

WOW.  I make breaded chicken frequently, but this was fantastic.  I followed the recipe as written, and did as another reviewer recommended and heated the oil & garlic first.  I also pounded the chicken, I think this makes it bake more evenly and also tenderizes.  Simple recipe with just a few ingredients.

It wasn't horrible, but I don't know where the flavor is that everyone is talking about. Perhaps my tastebuds are spoiled from the holidays. I'll try it again just to make sure.

We liked it very much and will make again.  Easy and quick.  My suggestion is to place the chicken on a rack in a rimmed baking sheet (which I didn't do, but will do next time).  That way, the chicken should be crisp on the bottom as well as the top and won't bake in its own fat.  I used panko bread crumbs which really added crunch.  I also added some chopped fresh rosemary in the garlic-olive oil infusion and the bread crumb-parmesean coating.

Holy heck (edited)!  This is great!  I added a little salt and pepper to the breading, and then put a little more salt on the top right before I put the dish in the oven.  My picky 6 year old loved it.

This was delicious! My glass cassarole dish was a bit small, so I had to flip the chicken half-way through or the underside would be mushy. Didnt need so much oil.

Good recipe. I changed it a little. I did the recipe exactly, except I split my breasts and put shredded cheddar and fresh broccoli inside and rolled them up and  used toothpicks to hold them together before I dipped and rolled them. I cooked them covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered them until nicely browned. My husband liked them and I did too. I did season the insides of the breast with sale and pepper and poultry seasoning.

I am eating this right now as I review the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Very easy to prepare. It tastes better than it smells while cooking and comes out VERY moist. Not the 'best ever', but better than most chicken breast recipes I have tried. Next time, I will try using butter in place of the olive oil.

I fixed this chicken when our pastor came for dinner and we all liked it really well.  I used fresh grated parmesan cheese (not the kind in the can) and added a little salt and pepper to the bread crumbs and it was really tasty.  Will definitely fix this again.

I am one of those who hesitate w/chicken dishes. I don't like to bake it and barely like to cook it. But Wow, both my 4.5 and 1 year old loved this recipe! I took it easy on the garlic just in case & filleted the breasts to be sure they cooked through, but it was very delicious and so easy to prepare. Thank you!

I liked this recipe very much - tweaked it just a bit - added a little italian seasoning and some cayenne pepper - the chicken breasts i used were pretty thick, so i did cook for awhile longer - but the chicken was SO juicy and tasty!

My 9 year old daughter found this recipe and has made it a few times. We made two changes; using panko bread crumbs and instead of baking in shallow dish, we use a wire baking rack on top of a baking pan. It helps to make the bottom of the chicken crispy instead of soggy.

This is a fantastic base recipe.  However after reading previous comments I decided to make a few adjustments.  I used 8 cloves of crushed garlic, put them into about 1/3 of a cup of olive oil.  Took that to a boil and took it off the heat to cool down.  I put salt, pepper and powdered garlic on both sides of the chicken and then placed into the olive oil mixture.  The only adjustments I made to the bread crumb mixture was to season the bread crumbs with pepper and powdered garlic and I used extra parm cheese.  Also I cook my chicken breasts at 375 for 30 minutes they are always juicy yet cooked through.  My kids and husband loved it!!!

Very moist, but rather bland recipe. Could not consider this 'garlic' chicken as even after nearly doubling the amount, we still could hardly taste it! I will add much more garlic and cheese next time. Was good, just needs a little something to spice it up.

Loved it. I used extra garlic because in our house "too much garlic is not enough garlic". And I used a mixture of italian bread crumbs and panko. No other changes. Simple and I will definetly make again.

This was absolutely delicious.  My entire family gave it thumbs up.  I will definitely make this a staple. I did double the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese as my family likes extra coating.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Simple, delicious, and quick! This chicken was very moist, and the garlic flavor was great. I used minced garlic, rather than the "crushed" it calls for, and just used about 2.5 cloves. We always keep a jar of minced garlic on hand, so this recipe was incredibly quick and easy. We're adding this to the meal rotation!

I was astonished at how tasty and juicy these chicken breasts turned out! This recipe is super easy and super tasty. I was concerned over some of the lower ratings on taste, but I followed the recipe as is for flavor and it really pulled through. I did reduce the oven temperature to 400 instead of 425 based on some reviews, so these were perfect. I served them to my husband who doesn't really care too much for chicken breasts (he prefers dark meat) and even he was amazed. I served this with mashed potatoes one time and the second time with rosemary & garlic roasted potatoes & broccolini, which went very well together.

Tasty! I used chicken thighs.  Based on others' comments, I did a blend of butter & oil & added extra spices (italian seasoning, paprika, cayenne, parsley & chicken seasoning).  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used instant mashed potato flakes.  I didn't have canned parmesan cheese so I grated fresh.  It turned out tasty, although it wasn't crisp.  I put foil over the dish until the last 5 minutes of baking.  Next time I will try it without foil, and use bread crumbs & canned parmesan cheese.

this dish was super easy to make, although if you desire a strong garlic taste you need to add enough for your liking.  only complaint i had was i had to add an extra step of putting the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes to get the crunchy taste i was going for....p.s. the kids LOVED it!!!! really worth making!!

This is an incredibly simple, tasty recipe that has become an almost weekly addition to our meal rotation.  I have three young kids who are somewhat finicky about their food, and they all love it.  The only thing I do differently is up the amount of garlic by...well, I don't really know.  Probably triple.  I love garlic :).  Other people have commented on the lovely smell while baking, and I agree wholeheartedly.  Warming the garlic in the olive oil is a very important step that starts the aroma-producing effect.

I've also used the same exact recipe to prepare tilapia filets.  The recipe, at least to me, is even better with fish.  Just follow the same exact steps as with the chicken, and use a probe thermometer to monitor the temperature of the fish to avoid over-cooking.  Bake the tilapia to 140 degrees, and enjoy.

My husband loved this chicken!  I liked it but the parmesan cheese flavour was a little too strong for my liking.  Next time I make it I will reduce the amount of parmesan.  Otherwise, a very nice tasting, easy dish to make.

This is super yummy!!! My family (toddler included) loves it!!! The only changes I made were, I used butter instead of olive oil and crunched up butter round crackers instead of bread crumbs. I only made these changes because I didn't have the other items on hand.

This was really good and super easy. I did however have to really season the (I used panko) and cheese blend with cayenne, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Really good though, chicken came out very tender. Also, more than doubled the garlic. Will make again!

My family loves this.  The only thing I do different is add crushed garlic powder to the bread crumbs instead of the oil.  Also I add a couple of TBSP melted butter to the oil.  I make extra crumbs to cover the tops since my kids love the 'crust'.  I drizzle extra olive oil on top.  WOW!...So good...better than fried chicken!

This was very delicious. I felt like I was eating a fried chicken but wasn't. Soo much better for you this way anyway!! Soo good. I did however add spices to the bread crumb mixture: kick'n chicken, oregano and black pepper. Sided it with garlic noodles! YUM!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and my husband, who is not a big fan on chicken, raved about it.  The chicken was flavorful and moist.  It definitely deserves five stars!!  I did use a little butter in addition to the olive oil which gave the chicken a rich and delicious flavor.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it, Carol!

Super Yum! I have been burnt out on my mom's old Parmesan chicken recipe and have been wanting something different. This fills in the blank! I substituted the bread crumbs for Italian Panko bread crumbs because I love a good crunch to my food. Definitely needed to make an extra batch of the crumb/cheese mixture but with the ingredients on hand I whipped it out in a jiff! Great recipe. Even my 3 year old devoured it like a hungry lion!

My husband and I both love this, its even good on pork chops.  I like to use the minced up garlic that comes in the jar, and then i brown that in butter or olive oil and coat the chicken/pork chops before breading it.  Its a lazy way, but its still really good.

Simple and very tasty chicken dish. I used panko crumbs (in place of bread crumbs), and doubled the crumb/cheese mixture to cover all four of the chicken breasts. A 4.5 that I will make again.

Did it the first time with chicken but the breading didn't stay. It's a shame cause the flavors were good. The second time I did it with tofu and it was fantastic!  I added some more garlic cloves though because the bread crumbs were a bit overpowering. Don't forget parmesan guys! Or any kind of cheese

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!! I make it at least once a week. It is so quick and easy and makes and awesome meal! I used butter instead of olive oil and I used almost a cup of corn flakes and 1/2 a cup of parmesan cheese. I cut the chicken breasts into strips. Serve with rice/quinoa and LOTS of broccoli! YUM!!!

Ty Ty Ty for this easy tasty recipe. I used butter rather than olive oil & added oregano paprika & basil to bread crumbs.  I loved it!

This was so easy! I did change it up a bit per previous reviews.  I used melted butter instead of oil and used the same quantities even though I only had 2 chicken breasts instead of 4. I also added some parsley, oregano, paprika, salt and pepper to the breadcrumb mixture, and used freshly shredded parmesan cheese. I baked it for the recommended time and the chicken was perfectly cooked, with such a tasty breadcrumb/parmesan crust, and so moist!!!

This is going to become one of our weeknight staples, I'm sure.

Turned our really good! Very moist. Nice flavor. Easy to make, and calls for ingredients that I already had on hand. I did let the chicken sit in the garlic and olive oil for a while before breading it, since I had some extra time.

Great recipe!  I used a peach vinigrette, instead of just olive oil, with the garlic.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so I crushed some seasoned crutons.  I didn't follow the measurements exactly may have gotten a bit carried away with the garlic.  I also added the remaining dressing/garlic mixture to the pan and sprinked the remaining bread crumbs over the chicken before adding the parmesean (I couldn't bring myself to toss the remaining mixture).  While it wasn't as crunchy as it could have been, it was still quite delish.  The peach vinigrette added a subtle fruity touch.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was soooo good! My husband is very picky and he raved about it!!! I cooked some spaghetti noodles and separately simmered some milk, cream, and parmesan cheese, onion powder, and garlic powder, to create a thin sauce to combine with the noodles. made the noodles and sauce a bed for the chicken and Wahlah!! I will def do this many more times!

I made this tonight and thought it was delicious.  I used a generous amount of garlic and let the chicken marinate in the olive oil/garlic in the fridge for about an hour.  I used an equal amount of Italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup of each).  This chicken was moist and very flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!   I think it is "company worthy" as long as you know your guests love garlic!

Made this for dinner tonight. I had 3 chicken breast that I defatted, split & pounded. Doubled the garlic & oil and marinated for an hour. I tripled the breading and used a combo of panko & bread crumbs. Added pepper and Italian seasonings to the bread crumbs. Glad that I made a lot of bread crumbs since it was the perfect amount. Baking time was 15-20 mins. When the chicken was done, I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese and put it back in the warm oven to melt. The chicken was nice, crunchy & not dried out. Ate it with rice. Would be great with spaghetti. Thanks!

Oh my god soo good!!! You have to try this recipe. It's really easy and super delicious. Made this on a weeknight when trying to make dinner with little effort. My husband absolutely loved it. I'm definately going to make this one of our regular meals. We had it with a side of brown rice that I had sauteed with mushrooms (my jazzed up version of plain brown rice). Very delicious meal. Thanks! :)

For the simplicity of this recipe and how good it tastes, I'm giving it 5 stars.  I've made many breaded chicken recipes with parmesan cheese before, but this one is fantastic.  I think because there's equal cheese/bread crumbs-- the parm taste is very noticeable.  I made with turkey cutlets because that's all I had- I didn't change anything else.  I thought it would need more seasonings, but it didn't.

So good! Tasted like it was fried chicken cutlets, but they are baked.  I followed the recipe.  Just added adobo seasoning to my already italian seasoned bread crumbs.

I seasoned the chicken first with Adobo (season all will work too) and coated it with mustard before dipping it into the garlic mix.  Chicken was juicy and had flavor.

I made this recipe as is.  The chicken was moist (I thought it was going to be dry). I had some leftover breadcrumb/cheese mixture, so I put it on top of the chicken.  It gave me time to pop some potatoes in the microwave, steam some brocoli and clean up the kitchen a little. Great Recipe!!! My husband really liked it.  Perfect recipe for a busy week.

I made this last night for dinner and it turned out great.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes for added spice and it gave it a little kick!  I also used italian breadcrumbs.  Great!  I cooked the chicken a bit longer, and it came out with a crucnhy texture outside and juicy inside.  This will be a keeper for us!

Delicious!! I used Italian breadcrumbs and butterflied the chicken breasts.  Also, important to season with salt and pepper before breading.  Lastly, I sprinkled the leftover dry ingredients over the dish and drizzled the remaining olive oil mixture over before putting in the oven.  It was fantastic!! Will definitely make again!!

I was very doubtful of this recipe even with all the rave reviews. I couldn't believe that something so simple could really taste so delicious but I was wrong. The chicken was juicy and tender and so delicious. I made it and took it to a pot luck with friends and they all enjoyed it. I will definitely be making it again.

Delicious!  and so easy.  I took another reviewers suggestion and added salt and let it stand in the refrigerator for a while.  I might add a couple more spices next time.  So easy and nice to find a recipe to make a chicken breast exciting.  The aroma in the house is wonderful.

Hubby loved this. I used only two pieces of chicken with the same amount of garlic, oil, bread crumbs, and Parmesan cheese.  Chicken was so moist. This is one of our new fav chicken recipes.

This was soo good!  I only had 3 chicken breasts which I cut into thirds for my little family.  I used 1/3 c of the bread crumbs and cheese and barely had enough.  This is going to my new chicken recipe!

My boyfriend requests this regularly .We love garlic and with the parm and panko it hits all the right notes. I regularly make adjustments to recipes but not this one.  It is the best chicken breast recipe I've ever made.  Thank you!!

Great and versatile! I like it with pasta and a spinach florentine red sauce. I usually butterfly the chicken breasts and double the dry ingredients.

DELICIOUS!  My family eats a lot of chicken and my 10yr old son is not its biggest fan.  Last night, he looked at his plate with the typical kid 'I don't want to try new food' snarl.  Nevertheless, he tried it and proceeded to devour the chicken before finishing his rice.  From my son, that is the highest food compliment possible.  Kudos!

I make this recipe often but it needs seasoning so I add Penzey's seasoning salt, oregano, onion powder, parsley. I make it with panko bread crumbs and sometimes make it as chicken tenders. I think I like it better that way!

Easy to whip up and tastes fantastic.  We paired it with brown rice and garlic green beans!  Can never have too much garlic!!!

This was the first dish I have EVER made and it was AWESOME! So easy and so delicious. Baked for 30mins and it came out a little too dark on the bottom, but other than that it was perfect! (also, very moist)

Not impressed with the taste.  I won't make again because there are too many other recipes to try that will probably taste better.

This dish is so simple and amazing! I had to put in overtime tonight, and got home at 4AM absolutely STARVING with no food except a frozen chicken breast. As I defrosted it in the microwave, I went looking for a fast, easy recipe and found this one!  Even though I only had one chicken breast, I kept the oil and garlic amounts the same, poured half into a dish for "dredging" the chicken, and then used the rest for my sides - added some to the water for couscous, and sauteed some broccoli and bok choy in some of the oil with red chili flakes. I also used panko bread crumbs for the chicken, and made sure to really pack it on! 32 minutes in the oven, and the chicken came out PERFECT - very moist and juicy, with a very crunchy outer layer, and wonderfully tasty! This will likely become my go-to recipe when I don't know what to cook!  I like to bento for my lunches and such when I can - maybe I'll try this recipe on some chicken tenders for that and see how it goes!

Crispy & moist!  I pounded the breasts nice & flat for even cooking/browning.  I also upped the garlic.  My only regret is not using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  This recipe is so simple!

So good, I didn't even have time to do it all the way it said. I ended up heating the olive oil and garlic in the pan and cooked the breaded chicken in the pan to save time. Still so great. I added extra garlic also.

Made this tonight and it was a hit!  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  I did not use as much oil as was called for and it turned out great!  Very easy to make; will definitely be making this again!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe as it didn't seem very flavorful to me. I followed the recipe exactly, even using flavored Panko crumbs. I don't think I will make it again as my husband didn't care for it either. I usually use skin on chicken breasts with bones in all my chicken recipe. To me they have a lot more flavor.

I am not crazy about chicken, but made this for my husband....He loved it. I am learning to like chicken. This is the best I have made, so juicy & tender, and easy to fix.  Wonderful recipe.

AMAZING!  The whole dinner my hubbie kept asking me what I put in the chicken.  I used chicken that was marinated in a chipotle pepper packet because that was the only chicken I had defrosted.  I did cover my chicken pan with foil and it came out super moist! WILL MAKE AGAIN!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!  Somehow I accidentally put 2 TABLESPOONS of garlic in instead of 2 tsp!!  I realized my mistake before I dipped the chicken in so I strained the garlic out and then proceeded!  DELISH.  I will make it exactly the same next time - which will be VERY soon.  The whole family raved.  My 2 year old ate almost 2 whole breasts and said " I LOVE chicken!!"

Good recipe.  Chicken was very moist.  I added more garlic to pump up the flavor.  I also turned the broiler on to crispen the chicken for the last 7-8 minutes.  My husband loved it.

WOW this was great! I had some shredded Romano cheese that I added to the cheese and bread crumb mixture along with some Italian seasoning and garlic. The chicken was tender and juicy and the outside was crispy and full of flavor. I WILL make this again!

Added my own spices (italian blend, garlic salt & garlic powder...I LOVE garlic in case you can't tell) and this was absolutely delicious!!  Paired it with sauteed mushrooms and angel hair pasta tossed with garlic, olive oil, butter & red wine.

This was great! It's a new favorite of my husband's! I added a few more garlic cloves though, because I love garlic. I've made this twice. The second time I made it, I heated up some Ragu garlic, onion, and herb spaghetti sauce for dipping: DELICIOUS!! :)

Great recipe!!! Still needs a bit more flavor for me, but very good starter. I will be sure to add more flavor the next time I cook this recipe.

I make this chicken atleast once a week and my husband and I love it! I've shared this recipe with friends and family members, and they love it too..  THE KEY TO TENDER CHICKEN IS TO TENDERIZE IT- very important, that totally makes a difference for me... but this recipe is amazing!!! It also makes great left overs, I just throw it over some spaghetti and add some pasta sauce for some awesome chicken parmesan!

Wonderfully simple but very tasty dish! I use crushed Cornflakes instead of bread crumbs, and use half olive oil and half butter. I either serve this with pasta and a thick tomato sauce or with potatoes and veggies. SO good, and everyone loves it.

Wow, what a simple, fantastic recipe! I had a package of only three chicken breasts, and yet I had barely enough olive oil and had to use an extra couple of tablespoons of breadcrumbs and cheese to get the last one coated. That aside, I used a LOT of garlic, about 6 cloves, and it's so delicious infused into the oil! The chicken stayed fantastically moist and tender. I served this with a Pasta and  Asparagus recipe from this site.

Great recipe.  Inspired me to do faster version.  I dip chicken in Italian bread crumbs, put on parchment paper, and drizzle with a few drops of oil.  Bake in the oven and enjoy.

This recipe is amazing.  It is now my go-to chicken recipe.  I have shared it with friends and family and they all feel the same way.  It comes out much more moist with the olive oil and the parmesean cheese gives it a great twist.  I have found that I prefer to cook it on a baking sheet rather than a glass dish because the bottom gets a little soggy in a dish.

I usually do not eat chicken unless it has some sort of creamy gravy on it, but I made this the other night for my family and everyone loved it. I used crushed butter crackers instead of the bread crumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delish! I served it with cheesy scalloped potatoes and broccoli. This will definitely be a staple at our house.

When I read the recipe, i couldn't understand where the flavor came from, but since it was rated so highly, I decided to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used panko crumbs.   I was pretty disappointed.  Not a horrible dish, but there are much better ways to jazz up chicken breasts.  My husband and daughter didn't want seconds.

This recipe is awesome.  I ended up marinating the chicken in a light caesar vinaigrette for about two hours, in an effort to lower the fat content, and I used italian bread crumbs.  My family, including my two year old, loved it.

This was alright; it just tasted like your typical breaded chicken. I can think of plenty of breaded chicken recipes and since this one didn't knock my socks off like the others, I won't be making it again.

Of all the recipes I have tried on this site, this is the one that my family requests night after night for going on 2 years now. I have to tell them no sometimes because I want a challenge and it is too easy to make! In my house, I serve the garlic chicken over pasta and marinara sauce made at a local pizzeria. Broccoli on the side. DIVINE.

Absolutely delicious! So easy to make and the best is that there aren't tons of ingredients! Already had everything on hand. Had to use more Parmesan and bread crumbs to coat the chicken though. It had such a great flavor. I served it with mashed potatoes and corn. Will definitely be making this again!

Simple to put together, and very good.  Freezes well, stays moist! I did not have bread crumbs on hand and so I crushed some Ritz crackers, and loved that, as a substitute.  (I put the Olive oil in a cup with the crushed garlic and microwaved for about 15 seconds. Works well.)

We've had this twice so far and love it! It's so quick and easy, yet so full of flavor. The only change that we do is add Mrs. Dash and garlic powder to chicken breast before dipping into oil and garlic mix.

Excellent! I was worried about not putting any seasoning in with the dry ingredients. But after trying it, I see why the recipe does not call for any. I agree with everyone else, no changes are needed for this recipe. My fiance even liked it, and he is one picky eater. Thanks for sharing this with us!

I've made this several times now and we love this. First we season the chicken breast with Morton's Nature's Seasoning.  Then we used plain bread crumbs and added black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and lots of parmesan cheese. Baked at 375 for about 40-50 minutes.  The chicken breast came out juicy and tender.  This is our go to comfort food...complete with a side of veggies and mac and cheese.

This was very easy to make & it was extremely delicious.  My husband raved about it & my son, who is a picky eater, cleaned his plate!  I will be adding this to my regular menu choices.  I also plan on using it as a base for my chicken parm recipe in the future.

Fast and easy to prepare and very flavorful!  Cooked it a little longer at 40 minutes to get it a little more crispy.  Yum!  Hope you don't mind Carol, but I'm passing this on to my family!

Easy and soooo good. The only alteration I made was to cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and pierced the chicken a couple of times with a knife. The chicken came out perfect.

This takes boneless skinless chicken breast from a bland, healthy protein to a delicious treat.  I paired it with the Golden Mushroom Risotto from this site and felt that I was in heaven.   A definite keeper.

Excellent. Very moist chicken recipe which is great. Cook for a husband who generally isn't big on chicken and a very picky 3 year old and they both had seconds and raved about it. And the best part, which I know all moms can agree on, it's quick, simple, and the ingredients are usually on hand!

This tasted awesome  - I used italian bread crumbs, extra garlic and Romano and Parmesan cheese - Fresh is best.  The cheese wasn't coating very well, so I blended it all with my hand blender and it was perfect.

I LOVE this recipe!!  I've made it at least 4 times in the past 2 months.  It's pretty easy and it tastes amazing!!  While on the low-carb diet, this is a great option for the higher carb weeks, or as a delicious and moderate "cheat." Thank you!

So good. To speed up cooking time and make them easier to eat for my kids, I pound out the chicken breasts to about 1/3". Serve with pasta, red sauce and broccolli. Home run!

This chicken was great!  I brined it for moist chicken, and even using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic I thought it was very yummy.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this so so much! It is now one of my favorite dishes that I make all the time :) Thank you for sharing. I am trying to teach myself how to cook and start making recipes that are simple. This was very quick and easy to do!   I also used the leftover chicken the next night for a chicken parm recipe which was so good!  My husband can't eat chicken and he thought it looked and smelled so good that he had me make it using pork chops instead and he can't get enough of it!

This is a 5 star keeper.  I am a dark meat person and cringe when I have to made breasts/white meat, but its what we had - I'm so glad I found this! Moist and yummy, even for those that prefer dark meat.  Other reviews said to make sure to use the green can parmesan .... but I prefer to shred my own - it stuck just fine and worked beautifully.  I used 2 big breasts, each cut in half, and didn't have quite enough dry mixture for all - so next time I'll increase freshly grated  parm/crumb mix to 1/3 cup each.  Other than that, just perfect.  Thanks for posting!!

Followed recipe exactly. Lacking lots of flavor. Bonus was how moist it was even the next day after reheating in the microwave for lunch. Will make again but would make some changes for more flavor.

perfect fora quick weeknight meal. The only thing I think is missing is to grease the pan because at those high temps I lost the bottom half of my breading which was very sad.

I already had chicken marinated in lemon, garlic, and olive oil when I found this recipe, and so I skipped the olive oil step. I dipped the marinated chicken in Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I added salt, lemon pepper and some additional Italian herbs to the breadcrumb mixture, too. At the recommendation of another reviewer, I added some cheese to the top of the chicken part way through cooking. My fiance gave it "two thumbs up" so I'll make this again.

I love this recipe!  I like to add lemon juice (as one review suggest) at the last 15 min. of cooking.  It keeps it moist and really brings out the flavor.  I also use more garlic. My husband is Italian so we tend to use more but it really taste much better when you do.

This chicken was delicious! It was a little on the dry side, but otherwise very good. The garlic flavor did not come through at all however. I even used 3 times the amount of garlic the recipe called for. Otherwise this recipe was awesome!

This chicken turned out delicious! I did crush more garlic than it called for to make sure that the oil that the chicken was dipped in had really absorbed the flavor. Then I cooked it for 30 minutes. This recipe was quick, easy, and flavorful and I will definitely be making it again!

This recipe is so excellent!! I hate chicken breast, but they were deeelicious with this coating!! So moist and flavorful.  My husband constantly asks me when we can have it for dinner again! I like it more on thighs and dark meat, but this way I can also have the healthier white meat.  You must make this, especially if you like garlic.  Be sure to use fresh garlic and use 2 teaspoons, which will be several (5-7) of garlic as another person said. YUMMMMMMMMMY!

We loved this.  I did end up with more chicken than oil/breadcrumbs, even though I started with 3 chicken breast halves.

This was really easy and came out really delicious! I used some garlic salt in the bread crumb mix and the flavor was awesome! I'll definitely make this again. I also just did one chicken breast and still have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

It was good but I'd like more flavour.  I even use the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I  will definitely add more Parmesan up to a cup  next time.   Warm the garlic & olive oil in the microwave for 1 minute or until you can smell the garlic.  It infuses its flavour to the oil.  I flattened the chicken breast  to 3/4 of an inch and baked it for 22 minutes.  The chicken came out really moist.  I'll update next time  with upped parmesan.

Made this the first time following exactly with regular bread crumbs and it was delicious.  Made it the 2nd time in London using bread crumbs from there, which are not like are fine bread crumbs, they were almost panko and was way better than the first time.  About to try it a third time in the states with Panko and I think it will be wonderful.

The chicken turned out good but not great. The tastes all went well, but it seemed a bit bland. Next time I will add more garlic. Overall the chicken was a hit.

This chicken wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite either.  It was a little bit bland and I thought the temperature was a bit high.  I might add some garlic salt or something and cook it at 375 next time so it doesn't lose so much moisture.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this the other night at the last minute.  I had 4 large partially frozen chicken breasts that I cut in half.  I prepared just as the recipe said except that I needed just a little more parmesan and bread crumbs. It turned out great--lots of flavor and very moist. I had left-overs for the next day.  It would have been enough for entertaining.

Awesome.  Followed everything to a T except I replaced olive oil with butter as some had suggested.  I'm a horrible cook and it was so easy to do even I couldn't ruin it. Even my very picky boyfriend loved it.

I use this recipe with extra virgin olive oil, and I also use dark meat chicken and breases, and Italian style bread crumbs. I leave in the oven for an extra 20-30 mins to ensure the dark meat is cooked through. It comes out with a slight crunch and is so tender that the legs often fall apart.  this recipe is one that my entire picky family enjoys.

Huge hit in my home. We are garlic lovers so I used extra, extra garlic. Excellent and very easy recipe. Five stars!

Very tasty! The chicken comes out moist and tender. I had salad, bread, and mashed red potatoes as sides to this dish. I love the garlicky goodness! :)

This dish is great - super-easy and super-delicious. My SO said, "This is like something I'd get in a restaurant!"  I used almond meal instead of bread crumbs since we have to be careful with carbs, but that was the only modification. It was flavorful and moist with a crispy outside. Highly recommended!

I tried this as written and it's very good, but I've also changed it up since it's so simple and versatile. So far my favourite is to marinate it in a garlic and herbs marinade and then dip it in bread crumbs (when I do it this way I leave out the parmesan) and bake it as written - so good. Thanks for a great base recipe!

I've made this several times, I've added different things to spice things up with the coating. I've used ranch dip powder, italian seasonings, chili powder, etc. (Not all at the same time).

This recipes is EASY and FANTASTIC! I would not change a single thing! I used shredded parm, not the powdered kind and it still came out wonderfully. I will definitely be making this again soon, my husband and children all enjoyed it. Thank you!

Perfect, simple and delicious!!! My whole family LOVED it!! I used Italian breadcrumbs like other people. The chicken came out so moist and the garlic was perfect for any garlic lover. I actually realized afterwards that I used too much but it was still perfect. I was able to cut mine with a fork. Now that's good!

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe! I have to make this at least once a month for my family. The only thing I did differently was added more garlic to the olive oil. We really LOVE garlic. We actually use about 15 cloves!

Was a nice meal but nothing particularly fancy.  Very easy to make though and a great go-to recipe when you don't have much time or ingredients.

I made this last night and LOVED it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had to cook it a little longer than 35 minutes to get the internal temperature to 180 degrees, but it was well worth the wait!  Next time I will pound the chicken breasts a little thinner to help cooking time.

Love it! Top with provolone or mozzarella and marinara for great chicken parm or use a white wine sauce and capers for chicken piccata.

I loved it...very crispy.  BUT I am a garlic fanatic so I tripled the amount as well as added garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  No one wanted to kiss me that night lol.

I really liked this recipe.....the only thing I did differently because I didn't have any bread crumbs, was I used Zataran's fish fry.  I would only use this though if you like a spicy chicken.

Excellent tasty chicken!  I followed the instructions and the chicken turned out fantastic.  I added one teaspoon of granulated garlic to make it more 'garlicky'!  As a side dish, I made garlic rice along with stir-fried red peppers and red onions in a black bean and garlic sauce!  Wow!  Great dish!

I made this with garlic mashed potatoes and a steamed broccoli and squash dish that also used garlic, so I expected to be overwhelmed, or for this to get lost -  but the chicken was outstanding, moist, flavorful, and did my kitchen smell great!

I made this pretty close to the recipe, except I added more garlic because you can't have too much garlic lol, other than that it's a great recipe. My chicken turned out very moist, and I also cut the breast into small pieces so it would cook faster and so my daughter would eat it.

I read reviews before making, and I'm glad I did! I made the "garlic oil" as recommened, and I think it helps a lot. I used about 8-10 garlic cloves to a cup of EVOO,I let it sit overnight. I used garlic parm bread crumbs, which I think made a big difference too. We liked this, and I rated a 3 due to the fact I had to change alot. I will make again with the revisions.....nice starter idea.

Very good.  Chicken was flavorful and moist, but I think the coating could use some spices.  I served it over Caesar salad and we really liked it, as the Caesar dressing compensated for the lack of spices.

Superb-this is restaurant quality! Make this when you want to impress your guests. I did make a few changes to taste. To save calories I used Italian dressing instead of olive oil and I used minced garlic in the jar (about 1/8 tsp.). It came out great. This will go in my Favorite recipe file.

This was delicious!  My husband raved about this and he is not a big fan of chicken.  I took the advice of another member's review and used butter instead of olive oil.  Very simple and full of flavor!  Great recipe!

I warmed my oil & garlic in an iron skillet. Then dipped the chicken thru the oil & bread crumb mixture and put it back in the iron skillet where the left over oil & garlic was... loved it!

Our family loved this chicken recipe.  It was quick & easy and even my super picky 6 year old said it was awesome!  Will definately be making this recipe over and over.  I used Panko bread crumbs which made the chicken extra crispy.

This had more flavor than I anticipated. I did use Italian bread crumbs and salted and peppered the chicken. I think next time, I will prepare the garlic/oil in a cast iron skillet and then bake the chicken in the same skillet so it gets crispier on the bottom.

Very, very good chicken recipe!  I was nervous when I read one of the reviews that said to use the powdery parmesan in a can because all I had was the grated type in a bag but it worked out perfectly and had no trouble with it sticking to the chicken.  We're going to cut up the leftovers and put them in pasta with sauce.

This is really good when you need a quick, easy meal. If you prefer butter flavor, you can use melted butter instead of olive oil. I drizzle the remaining butter/olive oil over the top of the chicken breasts.

I've made this dozens of times since first finding the recipe here  -I use panko with a little chopped parsley for color.   My family usually turns their noses up at chicken breasts but they love these.  What they don't know is how easy it is!

This recipe was just OK. It was quick and easy, but pretty bland. There are so many other chicken breast recipes that are just better. I probably won't make this again.

I didn't think it had a strong garlic flavor like the description suggested, but it was good nonetheless.  I was also surprised that I couldn't taste much of the parmesan.  I knew it was there, but it didn't do much.  Overall, it was easy and good tasting, so I'm sure I will make it again sometime.

This recipe was really tasty for its simplicity.  I used Parmesan/Romana blend and Italian bread crumbs because that is what I had a hand.  I will definitely be making this again enough though I had garlic coming from my pores the next day.  ( seriously :( )

I, personally, am not a big fan of chicken, but I loved this recipe. I love garlic, and it gave the chicken a great flavor. I served it with fettucini alfredo, and sweet peas. The hubby loved it!

I LOVE this recipe! It's a great substitute for chicken parmesean and easier to make especially if I don't have eggs in the house since this doesn't call for them. My husband loves it too! We are garlic lovers!

This was a very good recipe.  In my opinion, it was not bland at all.  First, I used both chicken breasts and thighs to give options between white/dark meat. Then, I seasoned all the chicken with adobo, fresh ground pepper, and a little bit of Webber's garlic seasoning.  Instead of oil I used butter and upped the garlic to about 3 teaspoons for every 4 chicken breasts.  I began cooking at 400 degrees however, the breadcrumbs on the bottom of the pan started burning so I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked for about 35 minutes.  So delicious - use seasoned breadcrumbs!

If you love garlic like we love garlic, then you will ADORE this dish. It's quite simple and quick to prepare, smells fantastic while it's in the oven, and tastes heavenly when it hits your mouth! A definite keeper and easy enough to fix on a busy week night.

Very easy and delicious! Followed the recipe to a T. UPDATE: I made this chicken again and used panko bread crumbs instead of regular. Wow! The panko really added a nice crunch to the chicken. There were some leftover panko mix and I just patted it onto the chicken by hand after setting them on the baking dish. The extra panko stayed on during cooking. Very yummy!

Easy and sooooo good! Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts (NOT cutlets) and followed the recipe exactly.  They came out so unbelievably juicy and flavorful.  Thank you Carol!!!

I had garlic olive oil, so I used that. I also crushed some crackers I had on hand instead of the bread crumbs as it was quicker (don't have packaged bread crumbs). As well as cheese and crumbs, I also added poultry seasoning and sage to add more flavor.  This turned out very well, except it was a little soggy on the bottom. I guess maybe I'll put it on a rack next time. A tasty recipe that got gobbled up and I will make again. :)

This is my "go to" recipe for so many things. By itself or topped with marinara or lemon caper sauce - it is always perfect with it's garlic infused flavor and remains tender and moist because of the olive oil coating. My first recipe ever used from this site several years ago and remains my favorite overall for taste and simplicity. Thank you so much for submitting.

Excellent. Everybody liked it. And in my house that's saying alot. 30 minutes is a good bake time otherwise it dries out the chicken.

Fantastic... tweaked, of course.  A friend recommended this recipe and frankly I'm a little tired of breaded and baked chicken .  However, this was perfect without the breading.  I use about twice the amount of garlic (chopped, not pressed), dip the chicken in the oil/garlic mix and coat it in pecorino romano.  Towards the very end of baking, I cover the chicken in roughly chopped marinated artichoke hearts.  I serve it on homemade fettucini and there is never any left at the end of the meal.

The chicken turned out very yummy.  I would only make one adjustment to make this a 5-star recipe.  I would either pound the chicken before cooking it in order to make it more tender or slice each chicken breast half into two thinner pieces (but then you would need to adjust cooking time).  The problem I encountered with using just a chicken breast half is that it was way too thick and the flavor didn't get all the way through to the center.

This is one terrific recipe!  Super easy and everybody loved it.  I made it just as written except that I minced two cloves of garlic instead of crushing 2 tsps.  I was very pleased with the accuracy of the amounts- no waste.  Thank you Carol!!

The best tasting and easiest baked chicken breast I have ever made.  I added a little salt to the bread crumb mixture.

This was very good and we will make again. It was great for a quick meal. Unfortunately we were out of bread crumbs (how does that happen!), so I got out the Cuisinart and crushed saltine crackers in its place. That worked just fine. Will need to try the original recipe sometime. Served with buttered parmesan noodles and fresh green beans.

I've made this 4-5 times now. Including once for a Christmas party for a few of our friends and their families. After one bite, my friend's 8 year old son asked "Who made the chicken?" When told it was me, he ran and hugged me and said "THANK YOU!" So, it's child-approved.

I've served this with a baked potato and veggies as well as with spaghetti and marinara sauce. Both ways are excellent.

My husband does not care for chicken and my daughter rarely eats chicken. I made this dish hoping that he would like it.  Well I followed the recipe to the T and he loved it and my daughter did too.  I can not make this once a week and they both eat it.  This is a definite keeper.  Thank you so much for such an easy and tasty recipe.  This recipe is so easy that on days when I am working late my husband will even make it.  That way when I get home, dinner is ready and we can sit as a family for dinner.

Excellent!  Very easy, even for beginner cooks.  I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 melted butter along with 1/4 cup olive oil.  I also pounded the chicken breast to about 1/2 inch thickness for more even cooking.  Fantastic!  Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.

This is the easiest, tastiest (assuming you like garlic) chicken that you can make in under 40 minutes.  My husband is very iffy on anything that I cook, and he loves this!  Personally, the more parmesan cheese, the better.  Same goes for the garlic.

I thought this was okay, but since my husband and two year old liked it, I am giving it a 4 instead of a 3.  The chicken came out moist and tender, so that was a big plus.

This recipe was very good!!! I was only making 2 chicken breasts, but still used the same amount of ingredients - I just poured the extra on top and really covered them thick with the bread crumb mixture. The chicken was so juicy and incredibly tender. I also added just a little more than 1/4 cup of Parmesan since I really like cheese. Next time I will probably try using Italian dry bread crumbs. Can't wait to make again!

This was so EASY and YUMMY! I served it with Knorr's Creamy Pesto sauce with pasta. The nice thing about the seasoning is you can spice it up any way you wish and it turns out awesome!

Very good and simple. Like other users I used butter instead of olive oil, a great change in my opinion. The butter taste just totally enhances this dish-though not the healthiest ;-). I cooked with 3 chicken breasts, and used a little more bread crumbs/parm. cheese. I think next time I might play up some spices in the breading just to add more kick...but other than that, great easy recipe. Thanks!

I made this a few nights ago for my grandson who had just returned home for Spring Break. His favorite meal is chicken! It turned out great.  I used olive oil and lots of garlic I know I used more garlic  than the recipe called for but we like garlic. 'Eyed' the amount of panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese - just made sure each breast had plenty of oil, garlic and coating. Severd with a simple salad and baked baby red and pacific gold potatoes.  Finish the leftovers last night.  Heated up in the microwave just enough to take the chill off the breast. Looking forward to making this again and again etc!

I substituted butter for the oil.  I got rave reviews from my family and a friend that joined us for dinner.  Next time I'll need to double the recipe because it was so good that it was all gone before my daughter and I got home for dinner!  They said it was a "keeper" recipe.

Absolutely amazing. To make it easier, I used garlic powder and for bread crumbs, I crushed 1/4c of garlic cheese croutons.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and was very happy with the result. Will make again.

Exceptionally easy and yummy.  I don't like chicken, but this was easy to make, and it felt lighter than most of the dishes I make!

This chicken was SO GOOD!  My husband said it was amazing and the best chicken he ever had (along with my butter chicken).  I followed it almost to a tee, except I used 1/2 cup Parmesan and 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, I had big chicken breasts.  The oil and garlic I kept the same.  WOW!  You must try it!

I got this recipe off of this website 4-5 years ago and make it 1-2 times a month. It's even a big hit with my kids. I serve it with mashed red potatoes, steamed broccoli and some type of bread/rolls.

This was really good - moist and tasty.  I did add some seasonings to the bread crumbs (I used panko), but I'm not sure it was necessary.  The chicken breasts didn't brown evenly, but the taste was not affected.  I'll definitely make it again.

This has become my go-to recipe for a quick chicken parmesan dinner. No, it isn't fancy, but it's quick and very tasty. To speed it up even more, use garlic olive oil or simply use garlic powder instead of fresh- no heating required. Prepare pasta and sauce while the chicken bakes, and you're set.

It was ok. Think I should have cooked it for only 25min. But my oven is a little wacky.   Turned out fine, just don't know what all the fuss is about.  Allison

Excellent! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I think it needs more garlic than 2 cloves. Otherwise, it is just breaded chicken with a hint of garlic. I crushed 4-5 cloves, which was not too much and not to little. Loved it! Serve it with fettucine alfredo or pasta w/ marinara.

This recipe was wonderfully simple and easy! However, I added some things of my own to give it a little kick. Along with the listed ingredients, I added about a teaspoon each of paprika, chili powder, crushed red pepper, and half a teaspoon each of thyme and black pepper. These additions gave it a really nice, spicy kick! It was delicious!

I LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time. I increase the garlic a little bit because I love garlic and I serve it with brown rice cooked in chicken stock. I also use crushed up Ritz crackers for the coating and leave them a little chunky for more crunch. I just LOVE this chicken!!!

This came out really moist. I only had enough crumbs to cover 2 large chicken breast. I suggest adding a little herbs to the crumbs. Other than that really good and really easy.

Kudos to Carol!!! Everyone loved this dish.  Even my 17 year old son, who is picky, said it was moist not dry.  It was so easy to make.  I also used cloves of garlic.  The parmesan makes the breading!!!  Perfect recipe for when you don't feel like standing over a stove and cooking.

This was good, but didn't have a lot of flavor (I even added extra garlic).  However, I will definitely try it again and add either some salt or garlic salt as well as some pepper.  Also, I recommend doubling both the olive oil and crumb mixtures as I ran out between my 3rd and 4th piece of chicken.

It is what it is. I mean looking at the ingrediants I was not expecting anything overwhelming and that is what I got. It had good taste and was easy to prep. I would make this recipe again just due to the fact it is easy to make and during the week I don't have as much time to make crazy things.

this makes a very moist and tasty chicken.  I don't heat the garlic with the oil and it still is plenty garlicky.  Very good!

OMG! I have passed over this recipe many times and finally made it for dinner tonight. How can something so easy be so good? So moist and you could cut them with your fork! My very picky 10 year old son said "mom we need to have this every night". I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! Thanks!

This was a pretty simple but flavorful way to make baked chicken.  I liked it and will make it again.

I have made chicken every way imaginable over the years I believe, and on a whim, I tried this one.  We couldn't stop eating it, it was that good!  I followed the recipe exactly as was recorded. I esp like the idea of using the olive oil, rather than egg or butter, and it's a whole lot healthier because of the oil.  I tried this a couple of days later with fish and oh my, it was super!  I also tried the Panko as someone had suggested. It was ok... but I prefer the bread crumbs.  Thanks for a super site and for all who share.  I can't share yet, as I am slowly becoming a better cook!  = )

This was very good. I used panko bread crumbs, and it baked up nice and crunchy on the outside; moist and flavorful on the inside.

Can I give six stars?!  This recipe is out of this world fantastic.  I made a dinner tonight for a bunch of guys, and this was by far the table favorite.  Such great flavor!  If you love garlic, then this is the recipe for you.  I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of breasts.  I just like them better, but it doesn't matter which kind you use, the taste will be the same!  I would say that this is the best chicken recipe I've ever had and I will cook it plenty of times to come!

Unbelievably good for how easy!  Added a small pad of butter with the oil, and poured the remaining sauce over breaded breasts.  Very good flavor & very moist!

I love this chicken! My changes were using a cornflake crumb coating (due to gluten issues)and reducing heat to 385 halfway through. Maybe 425 was too high for only 2 chicken breasts? Anyhow, delicious and beautiful.

We absolutely loved this recipe!!  My boyfriend and I wanted to make a quick and easy dinner with ingredients already on hand.  We cut the chicken into chunks instead of just using 2 whole chicken breasts.  We cut down on the olive oil a little bit and mixed it with melted margarine.  We warmed some minced garlic in the metled margarine/olive oil then dipped the chicken chunks into the mixture.  After coating the chicken well we dipped it into the breadcrumb/cheese/spices mixture.  We baked covered for 30 mins, then uncovered for 10 mins.  The chicken came out moist and juicy and the coating got a little crisp.  It was absolutely wonderful!!!  I will definitely be making this again

Simple, tasty and fairly basic breaded chicken recipe. My sons (3 and 1) ate it, as well as my husband. Gotta love a recipe the whole family will eat! Made it exactly as suggested. Would make it again when we're in the mood for breaded chicken.

I'm not quite sure what the big deal was.  I prefer "Garlic Cheddar Chicken" because there's more flavor.  These were ok, but nothing out of this world.  And I did use fancy parm cheese (not green bottle), garlic&herb crumbs, and about 7 cloves of garlic. I may use again when I'm out of other options.

This chicken is awesome! I use butter instead of olive oil, and double the recipe for the breadcrumb mix (i never have enough). I also use 1/2 grated parmesean (the kind in the green can), and 1/2 of the good pricey parmesean which I grate at home. This recipe is awesome with these few changes.

This was really good for being SO simple.  I even made the little side spaghetti like in the picture.

I love this recipe. It's quick, easy, inexpensive, and so delicious! 

The only think I change is to add double or triple the garlic; I'm a big garlic lover, however. If you want a more subtle garlic flavor, make the recipe as directed. I've also used garlic-seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain, and that worked well also.

Excellent chicken recipe!I made it exactly as posted and wouldn't change a thing. Simple to make and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. I agree with another reviewer who noted that any leftovers would be delicious over a cold salad the next day. My husband remarked that the garlic smell from the kitchen was "intense" but since we both love garlic we were pleased with the results.

I used some low fat italian salad dressing (still infusing the extra garlic), just to cut down on the fat.  Really Really Good and Easy Recipe.  Thanks.

I made this exactly like the recipe is, and I used fresh grated parmesan.  I had to bake the chicken about 10 minutes longer, but this was a hit.  I will be making it again.

I don't eat meat and rely on feedback from my kids and dh.  He said "it's chicken"

My kids ate it up and it was so simple so it gets four stars.

I tried this recipie with serious doubts because all three of my kids are picky eaters. Everyone in my house LOVED it! I had to substitute Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs, but it still tasted delicious! I will definitely make again!

Good, but not five star good. I used italian bread crumbs, and pounded the chicken. It was good but needed something else. I put it on top if spaghetti to create chicken Parmesan.  I will make the chicken again, but next time i will experiment with different herbs.

I was a little skeptical of how great this could really be because the ingredients didn't seem like anything special, but it turned out so moist and delicious! I asked by boyfriend to make this for me along with Bella's Rosemary Potatoes for dinner while I was at school.  He used two pieces of chicken but didn't scale anything else down.  He then placed them into a 5x9 Pyrex loaf pan and threw the potatoes right on top and placed it in the oven. Even though the bread crumbs didn't crisp up like it looks like everyone else's did, it turned out great.  It was such a great meal.

I have to give this a 5 because my husband loved this chicken, he said to rate it a "5 plus another 5". It was very flavorful. Instead of crushing the garlic, I grated it, I love grated garlic. I also added about a tsp of garlic salt to the bread crumbs, as well as a bit of pepper. I wasn't to sure about the way it would taste, but the first bite made me smile. I will definitely make this again, especially because it was very fast and easy to prepare.

I made this last night instead of another recipe I had planned (and could not find).  This was awesome!! the only changes I made were I used Italian style bread crumbs and and upped the garlic to about 5 cloves.  I will definitely be making this again!

Everybody ate it, everybody liked it.  I will marinate the chicken in the oil with garlic next time before breading and baking, to increase the garlic flavor.

A friend made this for me and I loved it. I made it, missing the step of dipping the chicken in the oil to coat with the coating. It was different, but still sonderful. I baked it in a cast iron skillet in the oven and it made it wonderfully crispy!

I made this dish tonight for dinner.  I used boneless skinless chicken tenders and it came out great.  Will definitely make again.

If you're a working wife and mother, then this recipe is a fast week day meal that you'll love for it's versatility.  It's so simple, I warmed the oil and garlic in the microwave, ran the shredded parm cheese that I had thru the food processor so that it had more of a crumb like texture which made it mix w/ the breadcrumbs beautifully.  I dipped and coated the chicken as instructed in the recipe and baked on a parchment lined cookie sheet for about 20 minutes for 5 small boneless skinless breasts and dinner was done.  I served with sauted shallots and peas which I prepared while the chicken was baking.  I can't wait to try this again, but I'm going to turn this quick and easy meal into parmesan chicken.  I'm also going to try pounding the chicken breasts thin and then when done serve to the kiddos as chicken strips. This is going into our regular menu rotation. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was very well received by my family. The prep was simple and the flavor was very good. I liked that the coating did get a bit crunchy.

Amazing!  This was one of the simplest recipes.  I used Garlic&Herb croutons instead of the bread crumbs and added a few other herbs but wow.... My husband said two things when he first took a bite- that I show up his mother with this meal and that I have to make it again.  And that's coming from a very picky eater.

A very good easy simple recipe. I always brine my chicken in refrigerator 6 to 8 hr. before cooking. Keeps chicken from drying out. The chicken was moist and tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I did use more parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. The parmesan cheese is a must. The crust really put this recipe over the top. Be great with spaghetti sauce for an Italian meal or made for sandwiches. Thank you Carol for a great recipe.

A good base recipe...the only thing I changed was to put the parmesan on last, because I forgot to mix it with the bread crumbs.  It got kinda too crispy, so I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you want to add it at very end of cooking.

I thought this was an excellent, easy dish. It's delicious...I doubled the called for olive oil and garlic because the chicken breasts I had on hand were very large. It was a good thing I did! The end result was wonderful.

Great recipe.  I used panko and butter with some dried minced garlic.  It worked very well and was such a quick recipe.  I didn't add the cheese because I didn't have it, but I will try it again when I do have it.  This is a really easy recipe to switch up with different oils and herbs.

This was easy and tasted okay.  I dont think that it deserves all of the grand reviews it received. I would never serve this to company, but my 6 year old liked it.  It definitely needs some herbs or something added.

I minced fresh garlic and considering the time it took to make this it was not worth the result. It was kind of bland and a bit soggy on top of and underneath the chicken. Tasted like your standard breaded oven-baked chicken. It was very moist, though. A great side dish to throw in the oven at the same time: the "Roasted New Red Potatoes" from this site.

Extremely moist and full of flavor. The only I changed was I added freshly roasted garlic to the olive oil, which gave it great flavor. I served it with the Easy Alredo sauce from this website and it was a hit! I will definitely be making this again!

Was not excited.  I did not have regular garlic on hand so I used minced instead.  Chicken was lacking flavor.  Next time I might add some season all.

OMG!! I was looking for recipes for my bachelor brother and this was the bomb. It's something he can make for himself and a definite keeper in my recipe box. So easy to vary different spices in the bread crumbs.

I have to admit this chicken turned out very moist, but it was rather bland. I would probably try this again, but I would definitely not use plain bread crumbs as I did, I would rather use flavored bread crumbs instead, and I would add much more garlic.

I was looking for something quick with the ingredients I had on hand and this was perfect! I altered it a bit to fit what I had in the pantry. I used zesty italian croutons crushed up instead of bread crumbs, grated parmesan and garlic powder instead. Minor changes, but it turned out to be really delicious in no time at all!

I make this every week, because it is just so good and not over the top with flavor. I love not needing to use milk, egg, and flour to coat my chicken.

This was a very easy recipe.  Tasty too.  I do recommend patting your chicken dry first.  I used frozen chicken and marinated it with the garlic oil mixture while it defrosted.  So the bottom of the chicken came out kind of soggy on the bottom.  Still it smelled great and tasted good.  I served it with Roasted Vegetables and Egg Noodles tossed with butter, parsley, and parmesan.

I am a vegetarian, so I didn't actually taste this.  However, all the meat-eaters made comments like "very flavorful", "moist", "so yummy".  This was very easy to make.  I ran out of olive oil so used a melted stick of butter instead and used italian bread crumbs.  Im going to guess that the parmesan cheese really added to the depth of flavor.  Cooked in exactly 30 minutes.

This chicken was good!  I ate mine with bbq sauce because it was a bit plain without sauce.  I added italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture but even that didn't add much flavor.  It was juicy chicken though!

I'm a nanny and always on the lookout for easy recipes. Man was this a cinch and it made me look like a gourmet cook. The baking temp seemed too hot so I consulted the back of the Tyson box and reduced the heat to 350 degrees but kept the baking time the same. After placing the chicken in the pan I sprinkled some Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to give it some more added flavor. Served with pasta and sauce and a vegetable such as broccoli, you have an instant easy weeknight meal.

I agree with the minority of people who found this relatively tasteless. If you have a little creativity, you can turn this into a 3 or 4. Just because it is easy and looks good out of the oven, doesn't mean it tastes all that great...

Like other reviewers mentioned, the garlic taste is very faint though I must've tripled the amount of garlic ( used fresh garlic and powder).  I also took the advice of previous reviewers and marinated the chicken in the garlic oil for more than 2 hours.  That didn't seem to help, for the garlic taste was still very light.  I used Italian bread crumbs, because that was what I had.  The chicken came out tender and I do like the bread crumb and cheese mixture, but overall this recipe is pretty bland.

I had my husband prepared this as I wasn't home to get it done in time for dinner.  He followed the recipe to a T (amazing how husbands can follow directions at times).  This was way too oily for both of us and I needed a good Schnaps afterwards - didn't mind that.  The garlic taste was good so I will do it again with just using a few sprays of PAM instead.  Still a 5 despite the overload of oil.

Quick and easy . . . . no mess. I have made it in the past with instant potato flakes calling it "oven fried chicken". You can add a bit of garlic powder/salt to the dry mix. It also works good just dipping chicken into melted butter before coating. This is one of the more lasting recipes in our family. Always easy and great when in a hurry.

This recipe was just okay for me. The chicken baked nice and juicy but the flavor was lacking. I ended up adding bbq sauce half way through eating the chicken bc it was bland. I followed the recipe to a T.

Yummy!  The chicken came out incredibly moist.  In addition to the chicken I thinly sliced potatoes and dipped them in the warm oil and garlic mixture then in the bread crumbs  before I did the chicken) then sprinkled with a little salt.  I cooked both in the same pan.  The potatoes were a nice addition, my family enjoyed both.

This recipe is awsome.  Everyone loved it, even the picky eaters ion my family, everyone wanted seconds.  I followed some advise from reviews and let the garlic and oil sit over night in the fridge and served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  Yum!  Will make this over & over!

Awesome recipe. Extremely easy... but don't tell my husband. He thinks I slaved over this one! He loved it and so did my three little girls. I love it because it was quick and easy. Definitely a keeper.

im shocked i never thought of dipping chicken in olive oil before. ive done everything fromw apple sauce to ranch dressing to even yogurt, but never olive oil. i was impressed with the garlic flavor that this chicken had. i was a little leary on wether it would be garlicky enough or not. we are  huge garlic fans so i did add extra garlic. half way through the cooking time i did drizzle the chicken with more of the left over oil. this was very good and very easy.

I bought chicken breasts and was at a loss about what to do, and this reciep saved me!  I had all the ingredients in the house already.  I preheated the oven and 30 minutes was definitely enough time! came out perfect, make sure you spray the baking dish with a little cooking spray.  Came out great, my husband was totally impressed :) thanks.

Great taste, and extremely easy to make. The only reason it wasn't given 5 stars is that the coating stuck to the pan on the bottom, and was hard to remove. I'd recommend spraying the pan, and maybe even the chicken after breading. The chicken was moist and flavorful though. Will make again!

So easy! Great taste and the smell is amazing. I made it with pork instead of chicken, just as great!

Easy, quick, and tasty.  I did salt and pepper the chicken and added a little salt to the breadcrumb mixture.  Served it w/SautÃ©ed spinach w/garlic and lemon. The chicken was really moist.  Everyone loved it. I will definately make this many times.

This recipe was so easy and so yummy!  The chicken ends up with a slightly crunchy exterior and a very moist interior.  I added some Italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture and sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper before breading it, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My family loves this recipe and wants me to make it more often!

I felt like I followed the recipe to a tee, but somehow I got too much oil on the chicken breasts.  I cut the breasts in half because they were pretty big, and I still used up the 1/4c of oil and the parmasean/bread crumb mixture with two breasts.  They turned out pretty greasy.  I'll try it again, but I think I'll brush the oil on instead.

This was a great recipe that was very easy to make and a hit with everyone.  The only thing that I did differently was that the second time I made it I used garlic-infused olive oil instead of making my own with the plain olive oil and garlic.  It allowed me save a little time, and I feel it ended up with a better taste.

Delicious!  I did half italian style and half panko bread crumbs.  B/c the panko is unseasoned I added a lil italian seasoning to the mix. I gave the breasts a light dusting of salt and pepper before dipping.  The chicken breasts I had were rather large so 30 minutes at 425 worked beautifully.  Will make this again and again.

Made chicken nuggets out of this for lunch.  It was good, but didn't think the flavor was anything special.  I did forget to heat the oil and garlic, but I don't think that would have helped much with the flavor.

This was a good recipe.  But it did not have enough flavor for me. I added some garlic salt after it was done.  guess im used to that flavor more than the fresh garlic. It was very juicy though!

Very nice chicken, I did not measure the garlic or the oil, I just threw some in the pan.  I probably used a lot more garlic then called for, but I love garlic. This had a nice light flavor.  Every easy to make

I have made this recipe twice now - in two weeks!  I made the coating for the chicken with 1/3 bread crumbs, 1/3 parmesan, and 1/3 ground flax seed for an extra hit of health.  Everyone thinks it's delicious!  My 7 year old son who won't eat any other type of chicken, will eat an entire breast of it cooked this way.

I cut up chicken breasts into strips as I was using this recipe for a party.  Very good.  I used butter instead of olive oil, and cooked the strips for 20 minutes.

This wasn't the type of meal you make to impress others at dinner parties, but it was pretty tasty for an easy and simple recipe. What I liked most was how quick it is to make, and its pretty healthy, making it a realistic meal for those who lack time during the week, and who try to eat relatively healthy. I served this with some rosemary potatoes and sauteed veggies, which all went nicely together. The chicken was extremely moist, and I will definitely make this again because it is perfect for those days when I am short on time/energy.

This wasn't fantastic but it's a keeper. I doubled the breading for 4 ckn. breasts. Used 1/4 c of plain and 1/4 c of italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 1 tsp. of curry and used butter and oil as suggested. What I liked about this recipe was that it was SIMPLE and easy, great for weekdays.

This was easy and fantastic, but I think next time I will make a couple of changes.  I'll use a little more garlic (I used 2 cloves for 6 chicken legs).

What a great dinner when you have little time, yet delicious enough and such a great appearance to it - that its special enough for guests. I made this for my husband for his birthday dinner, along with the Garlic Green Beans from this website and big helping of rice. It looked so great on the plate - the perfect golden crusted chicken- and was so moist too. Like I said before though, the ease of this recipe was the best - I made my husband's entire bday dinner with my 4 week old competing for my attention. Thanks for making ANY bday celebration possible for us!! :)

VERY easy and very tasty! Just made this last night for my husband and I, and I listened to the other ladies and put a layer of bread crumbs on the bottom of the dish--and used butter instead of just olive oil. My husband loved it! No muss, no fuss. Definitely make sure you broil it for the last 5 minutes--the crispy crust is delicious!

Very good and simple. I made a bit extra oil and saved (before putting in raw chicken of course) and used it to drizzle before serving.

Very easy, & delicious! I served it with rice pilaf and steamed veggies on the plate, with a glass of chilled piesporter, and my wife LOVED it. During prep, the last chicken breast didn't get quite enough of oil or coating, so next time I'll adjust the amounts up a little bit.

Very easy and tasty! My first time cooking and it wasn't hard to make at all, AND all the ingridients are usually on hand. I just had it with a simple hearts of romaine salad with creamy ranch dressing to keep it lite and corn. My first time cooking ever and my wife loved it, says i cook like a pro! HAH!

Wonderful and so easy to make! I only used a bit of olive oil and added butter for a richer flavor. It was perfect! You could cut the chicken with a fork it was so tender. Will make again.

Very easy and yummy. It is now one of my kids top ten.  I forgot the cheese and it was still good but I think it would be much better had I remembered.  I put herb stuffing mix in my blender to make the bread crumbs. A definite. Thanks. I served it with grilled onion, garlic, bell peppers and steamed broccoli.

Good, easy recipe, with a mild flavor.  Not outstanding, IMHO, but very good.  Easy to pair with a lot of sides.

Excellent!!! I used this as the breading for my Chicken Cutlet Parmesan, and it turned out perfect. Very delicious, and just like restaurant Chicken Parmesan. This breading gave my Chicken Parmesan the  taste I was looking for.

Good flavor, but a bit dry. Maybe next time I'll cook larger pieces, or reduce the cook time.

I may bake my chicken this way next time I'm making Chicken Parm!  My husband always hates the way the house smells of oil when making cutlet!  The chicken tasted great and even my two year old said "mmm good!"

Great recipe!  So easy and a huge hit with the family. Used chicken tenders instead of breasts, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Loved it! Will make again and again.

I loved this chicken!!! This is a very simple way to make the perfect chicken. It's a low maintenance recipe which means that I can spend some time making the perfect side dishes. I prepared this with "Onion Rice" and some baby vegetables. It was a nice contrast. Thank you!!

Whole family loved this.  Used chicken tenders for "upscale chicken fingers"!  You can dress this up or down.  It's so much healthier than fried - but you get the same mouth feel.  Thanks!

Quick, easy & my boyfriend really liked it. I love lemon with my chicken dishes so the little bit of lemon-butter that crept over from my asparagus (on my dinner plate) was an interesting twist.

I did this recipe just as it said and it tasted great and so easy! I did sprinkle a bit more of the dry coating on top to add more crunch. Recipe was even good reheated for leftovers. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe! I tried the other Garlic Chicken recipe on this site (the one using butter), this one has way more flavor.  Next day leftovers are great for chicken sandwiches.

So simple, so yummy. The first time I made this I had run out of Parm. cheese and used some mozz that I threw in the food processor. That was delish, too!

SO EASY and tasted perfect. Chicken was perfectly moist. I pounded chicken first to thin out/even out each breast and followed direction exactly (except doubled it to make 8 breasts) SOO GOOD!

I have made this recipe several times for my family, and it has been a hit every time. I know something is good when my super-picky three year-old eats his dinner, and he eats this. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really easy and fast.  But next time I'll use twice as much garlic because it wasn't as strong was I wanted it.  But it was still delicious!

Very good basic recipe.  Since I was out of olive oil, I used Italian dressing to dip the chicken in.  I think this added even more flavor.  Great quick recipe.

It may be because I am pregnant, but I had to add a lot more salt & pepper to make it taste even better!

This was pretty tasty. Like others, I added more bread crumbs and cheese.  I also used Italian bread crumbs. I marinated my chicken in the olive oil/garlic mixture for several hours before fixing the dish. It seems like it would have been pretty bland without marinating it.  Pretty good for something different, but not a favorite. I'd give it 4.5 stars.

This was soooooo good. Quick and simple and so delicious. I did use about 5 garlic cloves and also some fresh parsley in the olive oil. Make sure you don't burn the garlic! Heat the mixture for about 3min on low.I also got the butcher to pound the chicken thin, this makes it easier to cook through. I also used VIGO brand breadcrums, I'm not too sure if you can get this brand at any supermarket but I live in Miami so its always on hand. By far the best breadcrumbs, it has a bunch of spices in it that makes it extra tasty! My husband loved it, this is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty! Eat it very soon after it comes out of the oven, we had to wait about 30 minutes and I really think it would have had a better texture right away.  Still, even my 3 year old loved it!

Soooo good.  Very easy and tasty.  I first seasoned my chicken with a bit of garlic salt and black pepper.  I forgot to get bread crumbs from the store so I used saltine crackers, finely ground, instead.  I was a bit worried but it worked out wonderfully.  I also added more garlic to oil and just a bit more cheese.  Also, if possible turn the chicken when the top is browned so that the bottom won't be soggy. I tried this with both chicken breasts and chicken breast tenders.  Both were great.  This is a definite must-try.

I made this for the first time the other night and it turned out amazing!!  I used Italian bread crumbs and cooked it in a cooking bag with some of the oil and garlic poured beside it and it turned out so moist.  I have used the bag on both the brest and the chicken breast tenders.

I thought this was fine. I didn't have a lot of garlic flavor, and I don't know if I had marinated it a little bit in the olive oil/garlic mixture if that would have made a difference.  I did flip them once during cooking so that one side was not soggy. I will admit, the chicken was very juicy and tender. I served it with a side of spaghetti with marinara sauce. It was almost like a chicken parmigana! I would make again, but I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't as garlicky as I expected.

Not a lot of flavor but the chicken was moist. I will try marinating the chicken in the oil and garlic next time and maybe add a little garlic powder to the dry mix too.

I made this recipe for my husband and five kids. they really loved it. i added little extra garlic and and a tablespoon of adobo. and I toasted bread crums in oven before coating chicken to prevent sogging.

This was great! The only thing I did different was add a little garlic powder b/c I love garlic and I added a little italian seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture. I didn't have breadcrumbs but crushed ritz crackers were a great substitute. I served this with thin spaghetti and a bottled ragu sauce for a quick and easy parmesean chicken.

This is a delicious base recipe.  I made it with Chicken tenderloin, doubled the amount of garlic, added fresh parsley,and cut the temp to 375 for 25 minutes.  Served over Linguine topped with alfredo sauce.  A big hit!

I love, love, love this recipe. I make it as it reads, but the more garlic, the better, in my opinion. My husband begs me to make this. I use it as the chicken for chicken parmesan.

This was fantastic!  I used extra garlic because we love it in our house, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  Chicken was so moist and tender.  This is a keeper.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but I wanted to say that I followed the recipe exactly, for the most part, and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently is double the oil mixture and bread crumb mixture. This is not too garlicy, it was just right!! Thanks for the recipe!! This is a keeper for sure.

This recipe was easy, however, not as favorful as I would have liked.  If I make it again, I will add a zesty side dish (like spagetti with marinara to spice it up abit).

Great recipe!  The chicken stayed very moist - even after a fews days and heating in the microwave.  I doubled the garlic as well as the parmesan.  Added some black pepper as well as crushed red pepper for a little kick.  Used half breasts and half boneless/skinless thighs.  Thighs were even juicier.  Husband loved it.

This was a great recipe, but I added a few changes. I was cooking dinner for a friend of mine who's husband is vegetarian, and this is my take on the recipe. I marinaded the chicken in the late morning for evening dinner. I also marinaded Quorn chicken style pieces but with some Tamari soy sauce, and added (to both lots) half a chopped green chili (we don't like things too hot) and freshly ground black pepper, also added freshly ground black pepper to the crumb/cheese mixture. The result was liked by all, and both my friend and hubby would eat it again. Thanks for posting.

This doesn't need another review but my husband and I enjoied this for dinner. I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. My husband put his chicken breast on a roll with cheese, he said it made a great sandwich.

AWESOME!  The whole family loved it.  In an hour I had garlic chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy.  So easy and tasty.  I could make this every week.  My 14-year old had three servings.  Thanks.

This was juicy and full of flavor.  Super easy too.  I may try marinating the chicken in the olive oil/garlic mix for a few hours as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe--I love the garlic infused oil. I let the chicken tenders marinate in some Italian seasoning & a dash of garlic powder before I dipped it in oil. Chicken was tender and flavorful--we loved it!

My boyfriend took one bite of this chicken and rated it five stars :-)  The only change we made was to brown the chicken in butter and oil in a skillet for a few minutes rather than wait 30 minutes for it to bake.  We served it with the Lemon-Garlic Green Beans from this site.  We couldn't stop talking about how good it was (not exactly low-fat though)!

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I (a new cook) covered this dish with tin foil (as I do when I normally bake chicken) and it caused the breading to be a little too wet. It still tasted wonderful...I just won't cover it next time. Also, you might not want to make this if you are having a date as you will have bad breath  for a long time after.

I wanted to see if something this simple really could be delicious, but I was disappointed. In the end it just tasted like boring baked chicken to me. I couldn't even really taste the garlic. It was very moist, though, so perhaps I could use this recipe to make chicken for sandwich wraps or something.

My 8 year old daughter and I loved this. I thought it had the perfct texture and was it was very moist. My husband on the other hand did not like. He couldn't even finish it. Whats his problem? Well anyway we will eat it when hes not around. I think it deserves 5 stars but the rule is if someone in the family does not like it losses a star.

I thought this was amazing!  I flattened the chicken and broiled it like another user suggested - it was very crispy and delicious!  I didn't change the recipe much at all - only added 1 tsp extra garlic and some oregano to the bread crumb mixture.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This was easy.  I doubled the topping... I liked the extra garlic and topping, although I think the olive oil probably didn't need to be doubled.  But yummy and very quick!

This is a good recipe, I felt it lacked something.  First, I roasted the garlic and put it in the blender with the oil second I added a lot more pepper.  This gave it more zing!

I thought this recipe was just ok, but my family loved it! I thought the breading was a little too loose, but obviously my family didn't care! Although I have to say it had great flavor.

This was an easy recipe to make.  I did add extra garlic, but the garlic taste was not very strong.  We still used sauce to eat it with (bbq sauce and ranch) but it would have been good without it.  I think this is a good base recipe for other recipes.  I would use this for chicken parmesan like others have done.

I couldn't believe how juicy this was.  It was comparable to brining chicken but without the added salty taste.

We all loved this recipe, even the kids.  The chicken was moist, the crust was delicious and prep and cooking were both very quick.  I followed the recipe except that I used finely chopped fresh garlic instead of crushed.  This will definitely be something we have regularly - thanks for sharing!

I couldn't believe that something so simple to prepare could taste this wonderful!  I made this for company last night and served it with a combo of steamed brocolli and cauliflower and maple dilled carrots from Allrecipes.  You would have thought from the way everything tasted that I had slaved all night (my little secret!).  Thanks for a great recipe!

I think this is a good, quick and easy chicken to make for dinner. Sometimes I pound the chicken to make it a little thinner and more tender before dipping it in the oil. I only gave this recipe 4 stars because several times the chicken has come out a little dry, and I think it needs some kind of sauce with it. My husband and 2 year old seem to like it quite well, especially dipped in a homemade ranch dressing. I think I will try it next with a marinara sauce, or maybe on a salad. It is good on its own - don't get me wrong - I just think it could somehow be better. It's still a keeper in my recipe collection!

Used Panko bread crumbs, instead of regular bread crumbs. Served sliced into cubes over linguini covered in marinara sauce, topped with additional parmesean cheese.

Our family loves this recipe! Even my 4 boys, who can be very picky eaters, loved this chicken and asked for it again. The only thing I did differently was to use fresh chopped garlic instead of crushed garlic. 

Wonderful recipe!

This made a really nice dinner but it didn't really taste like I thought it would.   I used pounded boneless skinless breasts and thigh, panko which is always better than regular bread crumbs, a lot more garlic than called for, and generous extra seasonings.  Very good, but missing something...I'll make it again, thanks.

Yummy! Very simple and tasty. I used more garlic than it called for because we LOVE garlic (it was still subtle) and made more bread crumb mixture because it wasn't enough as is, probably because I pounded out the chicken so it would cook faster. I used both grated and shredded parmesan cheese in the mixture; just for more texture and crunch. I liked someone's idea of using panko crumbs so I think I'll try that next time and try perfecting crisping up the chicken on both sides. Thanks for a good recipe. Good stuff!

Very easy - made it a little simpler and more flavored by using crushed Stove Top stuffing mix with some Italian seasoning and powdered garlic added. Tried it with the garlic infusion but the flavor was not strong enough for us. Great to use for strips / fingers. Thanks for the recipe!

Quadrupled this recipe for a service project lunch... and the chicken turned out great. Moist and very yummy. I even had a guy ask for the recipe! :) I used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of regular. Great flavor.

Turned out pretty good. And I didn't have fresh garlic on hand so I used powder, I'm sure it would be better with  real garlic.

This is sooo good.  I took chicken breasts and cut them into strips.  Then I did the olive/garlic dip - coated them and baked.  They were GREAT.  My 11 year old ate so many.  We love garlic in my house.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

SO good, very flavorful. I cooked for 30 mins, and I probably could have done it for a little less. Great with Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil couscous! Easy to make too, perfect for the middle of the week.

I will definitely make this again. It's delicious and easy to make. I used store bought minced garlic instead of fresh. Still turned out wonderful without an overpowering garlic taste.

A good, basic recipe.  You can add more spices if you like - turned out very moist and tender, slightly crisp on the outside. Everyone enjoyed it.

I used a whole, cut-up chicken, 1/2 C. oil, 2TBS. minced garlic.  It was really quite good, and everyone liked it.  Put on a slice of Mozarella cheese in the last 5 min. and Mom told me not to do THAT again.  Maybe will try grated cheddar next time.  But WILL make again.

This chicken recipe is one of my absolute favorites. I love the garlic taste, and the breading with parmesan makes it perfectly crunchy on the outside. I looked this recipe up long ago and have made it many times since then. I had to come back and rate it!

halved the recipe...but i think the oven got too hot and kinda burnt my chicken..next time ill try to reduce the temperature a litle bit. flatten the meat just to make it even, but i need to double the coating recipe. Bake it for 30 mins. My boyfriend went crazy and clear up the plate in 5 mins literally hahaha ty for your wonderful recipe.

Very EASY weeknight entree. I did marinate the chicken overnight in a plastic bag with the oil and garlic just because I knew I had a busy day. I also covered it and took the cover off for the last 12 minutes or so in order to let the tops brown. The chicken was moist and delicious.  Thank you Carol for posting this great recipe!

Good.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and pounded flat slightly to an even thickness.  I ended up having to nearly double the bread crumb mixture.  This was tasty, but not too garlic-y.  I'd probably mix some garlic powder into the bread crumb mixture in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good! It could have used some more spices or something besides just garlic. I will definately make again though as it was fast, easy and I had all the ingrediants on hand. I hope you like garlic as much as I do!

Great recipe, I used the foil suggestion and covered the chicken with foil for the first 15 minutes of baking.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is slice the chicken breast in half so they are not so thick.  Thanks!

Made this for dinner last night. Husband & daughter loved it. Great, easy recipe. I used three large frozen chicken breasts. Therefore, baked about 15-20 minutes longer than suggested.

I cut the chicken into thin strips first, used a lot more garlic and let the chicken marinate in the oil/garlic for about a half hour first.  Very nibbly and yummy.  Good garlic flavour!

This was ok, nothing special.  My chicken turned out very dry.  After two attempts, and the same results I probably won't make this again.  Sorry.

We always use at least double the amount of garlic suggested for this recipe.  My 9 year old son just LOVES this chicken and gets so excited to hear that that is what's for dinner!  He sings my praises when I make this for the family.  It's the little things....

I butterflied the chicken breast and baked for 25 min. Still came out dry but could see how good this could be if it were juicier. The infused olive oil and garlic really makes the difference.

The taste was good, however I had a little problem w/ mine.  At 35 minutes, the breadcrumbs looked very dry.  I quickly melted butter and pour over the chicken, which helped the dryness of the crumbs.  I let it back an additional 8 minutes.  BUT the chicken was too dry.  I will make this again because of the ease of it.  Although next time I will shake off as much as I can of the breadcrumbs.

I love this! I've made it a couple time and it always comes out so moist. I usually add a little more garlic, and I added a little lemon juice to the olive oil and garlic for a little twist. Delicous!

This was a very good recipe, and it took minimal time to prepare!!!  For added spice, I threw in a tbsp. of garlic pepper, and placed a slice of provolone cheese on top of each breast.  I served this w/almond green beans, french bread, and a bottle of pinot noir. Everyone loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  I split the chicken breasts so they would cook faster.  35 min. was perfect for them.  I added a little cayenne pepper to the plain bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture and topped the chicken with shredded mozzarella the last 5 minutes they were cooking.
I'll definitely make this again.

Easy! Fast! Inexpensive! Presents beautifully! Chicken breasts that aren't dry! The only change I made was that I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before placing in the olive oil/garlic marinade.  Also, I allowed the chicken to sit in the marinade for about an hour before cooking.

This recipe is the best!  I'm not really a chicken breast fan so I used thigh's and it still turned out perfect.

i liked the idea of making strips to dip.  My husband thought it needed more garlic.  He said he could not taste it til I told him it was there.

Sooo Good!!  I can't understand how there can be any bad reviews.  This was so easy and tasty!  The only thing I did different was to use butter in place of the olive oil.  It was so tender and juicy and smelled wonderful!

Delicious and very easy! It only needed to bake for 25 minutes in my oven. Also, once chicken was in the pan, I topped it with the minced garlic (not the extra oil), and then sprinkled a bit more parmesan/crumb mixture on top to make it extra crunchy and tasty.

I used butter because i ran out of olive oil and didn't add the parm cheese. I used itilian bread crumbs and it was sooo good!  Quick and easy and great alternative to fried chicken, a lot more flavor and a lot less mess.  Thank you!

I think I expected too much from this dish, considering how highly it's rated.  There wasn't nearly enough garlic flavor, even though I used more than called for and made sure to spread the remaining garlic and oil over the breasts after breading them.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  I could rate it 4 stars simply for ease of preparation.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe.  I pounded the chicken to about a 1/2 inch and reduced cooking time by 5 minutes.  Very juicy.  Will make often.

This was excellent!  My husband even liked it and he hates chicken.  I did put garlic powder, kosher salt and pepper on the chicken breasts before putting them in the oil.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs and added cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs.

Loved this recipe!  Was quick and easy and the chicken was crisp on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. I did double the quantity of the parmesean/breadcrumb mixture to give the chicken a thicker coating.  Even my picky husband liked it

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  It turned out nice and golden brown yet retained moistness of the meat. The recipe is very easy to make and there is very little mess to clean up.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight, and my fiance and I absolutely loved it!!!  The chicken came out wonderful, and it was tremendously moist.  First, I put a little touch of my own seasoning.  I put Italian seasoning on both sides of the chicken before I dredged it in the mixture, and I used Italian bread crumbs.  Everything else was great... parmesan gave it a wonderful flavor.  I put the roasted garlic on top of the chicken while it was baking for 30 minutes.  So easy to make... yet so delicious!  Can't beat this one... thanks for the recipe!

So delicious!! I actually added 1 tsp of salt & 1 tsp of adobo. Next time I'll only do either or because (I forgot) the paremesan adds saltiness. Nonetheless this recipe came out so good I can't wait to make it again!! Oh and amounts were changed accordingly to accomodate 3 chicken breasts as opposed to four.

This five star recipe did not disappoint. The only change I would make would be to bake it on a grill pan, hoping for a little crispness on the bottom side of the chicken.

I made this recipe for my husband and a friend, and we agreed to rate it as a 4.5 star recipe.  I took others' suggestions of using cracker crumbs and crushed up onion and garlic croutons instead of bread crumbs.  I also topped the chicken with shredded mozzarella cheese.

Great flavor  and chicken was very moist! Nice crispy coating on the outside too! The only change I made was to add a little bit of garlic powder to the olive oil/smashed garlic mixture. Will make again...especially on a night that I don't have a lot of time to cook.

We loved this chicken.  My husband is hard to please, usually puts some sort of condiment on anything I make but ate this with nothing.  It was so easy too.

Followed the recipe as is and it turned out "okay." Definately not a show stopper. It was quick and easy and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  Just not the flavor we were hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll add chunks of garlic or some garlic salt.  Thanks for sharing.  =)

Chicken had a nice flavor.  My guest thought it would have been great to have had cheese sauce served over the chicken.  The crust was a little dry.

This was a really good,and easy receipe. I used ranch dressing instead of the oil.I think that probably added a bit more flavor and pizzaz than the oil.

This is a great dish! The chicken was very moist.  I added more minced up garlic and left whatever was on the chicken when I put it in the parmeasan/bread crumb mix.  Instead of breadcrumbs, try using seasoned croutons.  It gives it a great taste.

This was great! I pounded the chicken breasts as some reviewers suggested and added extra garlic. I did overcook a little, next time will watch more closely.

Husband tested and highly approved! I took some suggestions from other reviews, upped the garlic to 1 tbsp, added garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture and put the leftover olive oil and breadcrumbs over the top. Popped in oven for 30 minutes and wow, great, simple, easy dinner. I served with sweet potato and a salad. Great weekday meal the whole family loved.

Great Recipe!!  Kids and adults love this and it takes no time at all to make. I do add more garlic about 1 tblsp instead of 2 teaspoons. I love the garlic flavor.  When I put the chicken breast in the baking dish i pour the remainder of the olive oil/garlic mix over the breasts and spoon some more of the bread crumb/parmesan mixture over it just for that little extra coating.

It was nice and crunchy but not very garlicky.  I might add garlic salt/powder to the breading mix next time.  Otherwise good.

OMG! This was outstanding and SOOO simple! I served this with angel hair pasta and pesto sauce with toasted pine nuts and some broccoli. This is such a flavorful dish, but no so much so that it doesn't work well with just about any side dish.

This recipe was soooo easy and really very good.  I think I'd use a little more garlic and maybe some Tony Chachere's to spice it up a little more. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs but it could have used a little more flavor. The coating was nice and crisp without having to fry it in a pan of oil. I'll definitely make this again.

I thought the chicken was pretty good.  Like another one of the reviewers said, I will pound the chicken next time since the chicken was way too thick.  I think I may add some minced garlic or garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  I served it with pasta and marinara sauce.  I'll be making this again, and this will be a fun recipe to work with.

Great garlic flavour, but the coating wasn't the best. Maybe less parmesan, plus added seasonings like oregano or basil?

good flavor, but I didn't like the garlic pieces in the chicken.  the texture was too weird for me.  next time will try with garlic powder or paste.

My boys really liked this chicken.  I don't know what it was but it just didn't get a 5 from me.  I look forward to trying it again however and trying to tweak it slightly to find that perfect taste.

I loved this recipe. it was just the right amount of moisture, at first, though, the bread crumbs didn't stay on, but in the end they do. i think next time i will sprinkle some spicy, garlicy seasoning on the top, because this recipe comes out sort of blan, but still good.!

Good, easy starter recipe!  After reading reviews, I increased the garlic to a heaping tablespoon but it still wasn't enough.  Excellent texture, moist and juicy.  I will play with the spices to suit my tastes but definitely worth keeping.  Thanks!!!

This was okay, it came out a bit dry.  Next time I will cook for less time and add more parmesan cheese as well as 1/2 tsp of salt.
Either than that it was quite tasty

I have been making this this since 2006. I end up scooping minced garlic from the jar (quite a bit of it) and I don't measure the oil anymore;  I make the recipe bigger often for a family pack because we love leftovers. This is a very forgiving recipe that you can flavor up to suit the mood, tonight I added Italian herbs and some pepper to the breading. Don't be shy and use that parmesan, it makes the difference. I serve it with green veggies and either brown rice or leftover pasta. Any Italian style pasta will do. I also use a thermometer probe to ensure proper cook time without over cooking the meat.

Snaps for Carol! This is an amazing recipe. It's so simple I can't believe how delicious it turned out. I did add more garlic and seasoned the bread crumbs with salt, pepper and onion powder after reading other comments. It was crispy and not dry at all. For the first time there was not one piece of chicken leftover and I always try to make extra for the next day. A definite keeper!!!

This was very good, simple and tasty. The breading was a litle too loose (came apart too easily) but other than that, it was straight forward and delicious.

Thought this was delicious.  I used lots of extra garlic and extra of everything else to make sure I had enough to coat my large chicken breasts.  So easy to make and so good as well!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and was juicy.  I served with the honey roasted red potatoes and the balsamic butter asparagus from this site and fresh french bread and had a perfect meal in no time.  By the way, all those other dishes are a must if you haven't tried them yet.

This was a great recipe!  Loved it and I don't even really care for chicken. Even My husband commented that this was good and he NEVER comments on how good anything is.  I made only a couple of changes:  I used more garlic as mentioned in other reviews and instead of bread crumbs which I was out of, I used ground up Ritz Crackers which was very good.  I also added some chili powder and seasoning salt to the bread crumb/cracker mixture.  I will definately make this again and again!

Delicious, and simple. Great for an  easy weeknight dinner.  My chicken came out a bit dry because I overbaked, next I'll bake for less time or lower the temp.

The more I make this, the better I like this.  It's so simple to make, and so versatile.  Keep it casual with oven baked sweet potato fries and ketchp or make it more elegant with your favorite company side-dishes.  I do recommend that you double the amount of oil, garlic, bread crumbs, and parmesan to have enough to coat your chicken nicely.

This was fantastic! My 9 year old and 2 year old asked for more chicken. Even my very picky husband liked this. In fact, they requested it again the next night! I had very thin cutlets in the fridge, so I just reduced the cooking time to about 20 minutes. This is a keeper. Thanks!

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, oregano, and a little dried basil on the chicken breasts before I pounded them out. The chicken came out very moist and tender. Next time I will use more garlic, as it didn't have quite as much garlic flavor as I was expecting.

Way too oily for us!  I couldn't even taste the garlic, which is why I even tried this recipe at all.  Next time I will try with butter instead.

My whole family loved this! We used thighs for a change, but it still turned out great. I added more garlic (6 cloves) to the olive oil, along with some garlic salt, season salt, and pepper. I also added a little seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

Got raves from the rest of the table, but it was a blah for my tastes. But then again, I'm not a fan of breaded chicken. I've already got a request for it again by four of the five eating, so for that I'll give it a four of five.

Very easy to prepare and suprisingly moist!  My husband is not a garlic lover like me, but I made it anyways and he ate it!  I'll be passing this recipe on to friends and family.

Deelish! I added some ingredients other people suggested (basil, thyme, black pepper, etc) and used more garlic cloves. It turned out to be very tasty. This was also a really easy and quick meal to fix. Thanks!

I made this tonight for dinner and I have to say "YUM"!  My extremely picky 6 year old even said it was good!  Per reviews, I used more parmesan cheese, garlic and bread crumbs.  I also added a little basil and thyme to my olive oil/garlic mixture.  I highly recommend!

I just made this and it was awesome! I read over other people's suggestions and the chicken came out really well. I used A LOT of garlic cloves and it was really good. I sprinkled some garlic powder and black pepper on the chicken before dipping it into the hot oil/garlic mix. I also added a little garlic and onion powder along with Cajun seasoning into the bread crumb (Italian seasoning)/parmesan mix. I put the chicken in for 20 mins @ 425 degrees and then sprinkled a little parm. on and broiled it for about 5 mins. Served with rice pilaf and green beans! Excellent!

An excellent chicken recipe that was a pleasant surprise for the tastebuds!  I added thyme and basil to my olive oil garlic infusion and allowed this to simmer for about 5 minutes before cooling.  I also used italian breadcrumbs and fresh parmesan cheese.  This was excellent and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

My two teenage sons who complain that we "always have chicken" actually ask for this recipe!  It is by far one of our top favorites and is used regularly.  I prepare it just as written. The chicken bakes up moist, tender and delicious.

I didn't do this the right way the first time.  Silly me, I started adding ingredients before I read the whole recipe all the way through and realized that I should've warmed the oil and garlic first but I just mixed everything together!  Anyway long story short it still came out pretty good and tonight I'm trying it this way (the right way) for chicken fingers!

This is an awesome, easy recipe just like it is.  We like lots of spice!  I scaled the recipe to 2 and added 1 1/2 tsp chopped parsley, 1 1/2 tsp chopped basil, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, and 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the dry ingredients. The coating was very crispy, the chicken very moist and extremely tasty.

WOW! this recipe was fantastic.  I had my boyfriend's friend over for dinner and they cleaned their plates.  I did add a bit more shaved parmesan cheese, and also added a dash of red pepper flakes.  This recipe is most certainly a favorite!

I needed an easy baked chicken dish to go with roasted butternut squash. This turned out great--tasty, moist, and easy. I doubled the bread crumb mixture (I had some big chicken breasts) and used seasoned bread crumbs. I will definitely be making this again.

Very easy to make and very tasty!  Almost tasted like Chicken Kiev (well, to me it did) without the buttery filling! This will definitely be made more often.

instead of using breasts i used chicken strips. when i was making it the fresh garlic and olive oil was overpowering and i thought that it would come out tasting to much of garlic. but the end result was good not to garlicy, a little dry but i think that is because i used strips. over all a good recipe, and my husband liked it to. thanks

An easy and very good recipe. I added salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.
I will double the recipe so there are leftovers for the next day.

Very moist and EXTREMELY easy.  I used minced garlic and canola oil.  Also, I had 2 large chicken breasts and I had the perfect amount of bread crumb mixture--so if you're making 4 chicken breasts, I would definitely recommend doubling the bread crumb mixture.

Super simple. Wonderful aroma while it's cooking. I chose a small side of spaggetti
with marinara, and a $8 pino noir , and it felt like we were dining out somewhere fancy!

Thank you for this simple recipe.  I'm always looking for quick, but good dinners to make!  The chicken was so moist and it had lots of flavor.  The only change I made was I used italian style bread crumbs because that is what I had.  Served it with some penne noodles with a garlic butter sauce and broccoli.  Fast and easy!

This recipe is so simple and my boyfriend really loved it!  I essentially doubled the garlic (but by reducing the olive oil by half - I only had 4 small chicken breasts so I didn't need a 1/2 cup of oil) and let it marinate for about 45 minutes or so...and it came out great...moist on the inside, crispy on the outside.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks!

I have just begun cooking more and using recipes rather than just the "meal in a box" methods and my husband said this is the best chicken he ever had. That surprised me to say the least. I served it like chicken parmesan over noodles and sauce and added some mushrooms and onions sauteed in garlic and olive oil. The chicken is made very similarly to chicken parmesan so it worked well. Very fast and very tasty meal!

This recipe is great for a simple mid-week dinner. I used Italian style bread crumbs and added salt & pepper and used 4 teaspoons of chopped garlic. I also let the garlic cook in the oil in med-low until it was golden, to give it more flavor. Thanks!

Excellent. Very easy to make and seemed to add alot of flavour to the chicken. A couple things I would do differently - make alot more parmesan and bread crumb mixture and try to find smaller chicken breasts. I also think marinating the breasts for a while would really kick it up. Made this chicken on a bed of garlic pesto pasta. Delish.

I flattened the chicken, made tenders and baked for 25 minutes.  I'm a garlic lover but I went way overboard on the garlic.  Two cloves minced + half teaspoon garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture for one chicken breast is way overboard.  Ha.  No matter; it was wonderful the next day in a toasted kaiser with mayonnaise, a leaf of romaine and a slice of tomato.  I also used shredded parmesan for texture and added some cracked pepper to the breading.

This recipe is fantastic!  I doubled the garlic, and I love garlic, so I think I might triple it next time.  I feel like I've eaten at a fancy restaurant whenever I make this.  Thanks Carol!

I wonder if I did something wrong because I thought this was just "okay."  As suggested by a previous review, I served with w/ spaghetti noodles and marinara as "chicken parmesan."   I had the leftovers for lunch today and it was almost better the second day.  I'm going to keep this recipe and try again...UPDATE ONE MONTH LATER...The more I make this the more I like it.  My husband is regularily requesting this for dinner.  Four stars.

We thought this was just okay.  We'll probably do it again occasionally, but not very often.  It just seemed like it was missing something, and didn't look that pretty.  We served it on top of pasta and marinara sauce, like chicken parmesan.

I loved this recipe!!!  It took a little longer than I expected, but I chopped up twice the amount of garlic, added about 2 tablespoons of fresh basil, and sprinkled light garlic salt and pepper into the olive oil mixture.  I had read from other reviews that this recipe was slightly bland, and after I was done, it was tasty and utterly delicious--definitely not bland

Pretty good and it definitely gets points for being easy.  Lost some points for being rather bland.  Let the chicken marinate in the oil and garlic for a couple hours before baking and it had a good garlic flavor, but next time I'll throw in some herbs.

This is so easy, and it tastes fantastic. I took what was left of the garlic and olive oil mixture and poured it over the chicken before baking, so the chicken stayed very moist, but not soggy. Will definitely make this one a favorite!

I was thrilled at the responses I saw online to this recipe and picked it out for a very important and large dinner party.  Thank goodness I did a test-run in advance.  

I cooked it tonight - it was fair.  We LOVE garlic, and we like chicken, so I figured it'd be a home run.  It was not bad, but not one that I'd rave about and honestly not one that I'll cook again.  It did look just like the picture, which was nice.  My husband described the problem as "something missing".  I feel like it would benefit from possibly some additional spices to complement the garlic.

This recipe was very easy & very good!  I didn't have parmesan so I used pecorino romano & it was delicious.  Will definitely make this again!

This chicken recipe came out great. My whole family loved it. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of the breast to save money, but it didn't take away from a great tasting meal.

This is so simple, good, and pretty good for you.  Also works well with skinless chicken thighs, just cook a little longer ( 5 - 10 min. )

My husband is not a fan of chicken but he loves this one.  So easy to prepare and just the right touch of garlic.  The chicken stays juicy and tender.  Will make again and again.  Even college daughter would find this one easy and fast to make.

It tasted good overall, but the bottom didn't get crispy...it got a little soggy, and it stuck to the bottom, so it didn't look all that great. I should try flipping it over half way into it.

Wonderful!  I used bottled minced garlic and crushed cesar salad crutons (because I had them).  This is a great recipe because you can make it for one or as many people as you want.

Great chicken.  I didnt have crushed garlic, so I used about 4 large cloves and minced them.  I used Panko Japanese Breadbrumbs and pounded and lighted seasoned my chicken breasts with a little salt & pepper.

Great recipe!  Really easy to make and is just as good for leftovers.  Everyone loves it.  I sprinkle the leftover crumb/cheese mixture over the chicken before I bake it.

Made this last night, and thought it turned out pretty good. My family really liked it (even the picky 12 year old). I love garlic, but this didn't have enough garlic flavor for me. I used minced garlic. Next time I will try garlic powder in addition to the minced, and maybe pour the remaining olive oil juice on top as suggested by others. This is a great simple, quick recipe. I think the prep time was a lot less than 20 min!

This dish was pretty good, the chicken was very juicy and tender but I think I prefer the texture of panko(Japanese breadcrumbs). I'm sure I'll make it again with just a couple variations. Thanks!

I've made this dozens of time. VERY easy, and tastes great. Always turns out fantastically. I love a fool proof recipe! I'd give it five stars, but i do find the dish a tad-bit bland.

Pretty good! Deceptively simple! I didn't think that it would live up to all of the reviews, but the chicken turned out very tender & tasty even though there isn't much to this recipe. My one change was to cook the chicken in foil packets rather than a baking dish.  A keeper!

I spread a little mayonnaise before adding the cheese/breadcrumb/mixture.  I also pounded my chicken out and cooked for about 20 minutes, let rest for 5 minutes.

This recipe was SO yummy and SO easy!  The only change I made was using crunched up stove-top stuffing because I was out of bread crumbs.  Also, since I had thighs instead of breasts, I cooked them for about 5 minutes longer.  Thanks for a great recipe, Chris!

Yummy!  Dh and I give it 4.5 stars.  Very easy to prepare too.  Before putting into the oven, I drizzled the leftover oil/garlic mixture over the chicken breasts.

After all the rave reviews, my boyfriend and I were quite excited to try this.  I followed the recipe to the tee, and boy were we disappointed.  The chicken had no flavor!  Very, very bland.  Will not be making this again.

Very good. My husband especially liked it. I used seasoned bread crumbs & also added a pinch of cayenne. As another reviewer suggested, I turned them over half way through cooking. Make sure you let the garlic bits stick to the chicken! I baked them on a cookie sheet.

This recipe was wonderful.  My kids and my husband that is was great!  I added more garlic to give it a little more flavor and I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs.  I will definitely make this one again!!

This was easy & excellent! I love garlic but I despise too much.  I was afraid the garlic would be too overpowering because little chunks were sticking to the chicken, but it turned out with just the right amount of garlic/cheese flavor.  I cut the cheese in half tho, to try and save on some calories. Also, as others suggested, I pounded the meat thin (so only needed need 2 breast halves) and cut the cooking time to 20 minutes.   Perfect!  This was plenty for 2 with leftovers for lunch.

This was a GREAT recipe! I have had SO many compliments on it! I served this chicken pounded out and cut into small pieces over fettucini alfredo (Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce by Dawn Carter) on this site makes an AMAZING combo with this recipe! Served with some fresh parsley for garnish and warm italian bread! MMMMM! Enjoy!

Very easy, and very yummy. This is the only way I make breaded chicken now.  I substitute a little garlic powder for the garlic and it's just great.

"MMMMMMMM mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm sorry I can't talk - too busy eating"  That was a direct quote from my satisfied husband after making this surprisingly easy and DELICIOUS chicken.
For years, I have been doing the flour, egg, bread crumb chicken that is fried in oil.

This is a MILLION times better.  I pounded out the chicken and found that since you then get a larger surface area, we needed more bread crumbs and parmesan (freshly grated as always).  Also, because it's thinner when it's tenderized, it only took 20 minutes.

PHENOMENAL!

This is so good and so easy !!  My kids take turns cooking weekly and my 17 year old daughter loves this one.  It is a real pleaser to a picky bunch of boys and goes great with fettucini alfredo.

Easy to make and very tasty.  The family ate it up!  I added a few red pepper flakes to the garlic and olive oil.

Very good and very easy. My son loved it and my husband really liked it too but I think I served it with the wrong side dishes (mashed pot & corn). We all thought it tasted like a really good parmesan chicken and I think next time I will make a good marinara and some spaghetti to go with it. Thanks!

This was pretty easy to make. I would recommend using more garlic. This dish is good with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.

Great Chicken. It was very tender and juicy, my 4 kids loved it which is the true test. Next time I will cut the chicken into strips. I also agree that this chicken would be great with a chicken parm sauce. Loved it a definite keeper.

I made this since it was simple and sounded good. It exceeded my expectations!! The smell of it when it cooks is wonderful. I would suggest increasing the amount of bread crumbs and parmesan and use more garlic in the oil if you really like it garlicky like I do. Let the garlic stick to the meat before breading it to give it flavor. The chicken comes out moist and brown and very flavorful. I actually crave this one now! Try it!

SIMPLE RECIPE, TRY IT!! I made 3 variations to the recipe: 1) I used drumsticks with skin, 2) a ridiculous amount of garlic which i crushed in a mortor and soaked in the olive oil for a few hours, and 3) I had "italian style" bread crumbs on hand (has romano cheese in it already) which i substituted for the parmesan and bread crumbs.  It tasted crispy and as if it was fried.  Next time i will try adding chili powder to the olive oil to make it spicy.

I had one very large bs breast -- not enough for a meal for 4, but a nice add-in to another dish.  So, I cut it into good-sized chunks, dipped them in oil and crumbs/cheese, pan-fried them in more garlic oil, then added them to the Cavatelli and Broccoli recipe.  A great combination!

The chicken was pretty good; however, as a meal this really lacked something.  Rice maybe?  I froze one of the chicken breasts to use with a chicken Caesar salad -- I think the chicken will be perfect for that.

Absolutly great chicken recipe.  My wife and I thought it was a great dinner.  I would make sure that the chicken breasts are thinner than a full breast.  Otherwise, delicious

I was really in a rut with my chicken recipes.  This recipe was a godsend for a mother working long hours with limited time to prepare a weeknight meal.  I used chicken breast fillets and they were perfect. Moist inside crunchy coating outside.  The whole family loved it!  Thanks again.

I am going to give this a four only because my husband who doesn't care for chicken said he loved it. I felt the coating didn't get cristy enough. I would rate it closer to a 3 or 2.5 My husband thought maybe this should be deep fried instead of baked. Anyway, I felt this was "one step above" the typical overrated canned soup recipes that I come across from this site. I think it was fine but it was not extraordinary. It certainly would be good for something like parmesan chicken etc. Served it with the "rich pasta from a poor kitchen" from this site and the flavors matched very well. I also think Italian bread crumbs should be used instead of plain. Went great with Cakebread Cellars Pinot Noir.

My family loved this recipe. (I butterflied the chicken to ensure thorough cooking since it is cooked at a high temp) The chicken was moist and you can really taste the parmesan cheese and garlic. A definite "have again"

Good and easy. Pounded the chicken breasts and simmered the left over browned bits with lemon juice and white wine to make a sauce for the chicken.

I made this into a chicken strip version.  They were excellent-- crisp on the outside with lots of flavor.  The only change I made was adding a bit of pepper and using italian spiced bread crumbs.

This was delicious! The garlic flavor was great and the chicken was moist. I just did bread crumbs and crumbled corn flakes, no parmesan. Also added salt & pepper.

Fast and easy recipe. I used 5 CLOVES of garlic for 6 breasts. I also used Italian flavored shake and bake for breadcrumbs. I sliced each breast diagonally in half to make a filet .

one of my all time favorites!!! i like to add a little dash of cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs and parmesan mix. kick it up a little! i like to cut the chicken into small pieces after baking and add to a pasta then mix it all up.

Yummy! I think I will add a little more garlic next time, but overall, this was a keeper!  The chicken was very moist, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This one's definitly a keeper!  It was so easy and very tasty.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to pound the chicken to make them a little thinner and I used Italian flavored bread crumbs.  Turned out perfect!

Very good flavour, very simply made, but the chicken was a bit dry. I pounded the breasts to fairly thin, maybe that's why they were a little dry.  These tasted so good though and the kids and hubby enjoyed it so much that this dish will definately be made again. Thanks Carol.

This was a quick and tasty recipe!  I used a lot more garlic than called for, probably about 5 Tbsp.  I also doubled the amount of breadcrumbs and parmesan, plus added italian spices to the mix.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

My husband loved this recipe. Also great because it has common ingredients that we always have in the house. I used minced garlic and that worked well. Will make this again, and maybe try the chicken nugget variation.

VERY nice flavor.  I used fresh bread crumbs and freshly grated cheese.  I used whole breasts...but I imagine that chicken tenders would be fantastic.

An easy, yet fantastic comfort food.  I threw some Italian seasoning into the cheese/breadcrumb mixture.  Otherwise I prepared it exactly as instructed.   I made it with some dijon roasted potatoes and sauteed string beans.   The whole meal was a hit!  And quite simple.

This was great...tried it tonight for the first time.  I did add a little more bread crumbs as previously suggested. I had served this with some frozen stir-fried veggies and bread...this made a tasty quick meal.  This will become a staple in my menu for me!

My family just LOVED this dish! We added a bit more garlic. My 15 year old son was eager to help as he watches many cooking shows. The recipe is simple and he has made it for the family several times now. I say HOORAY! to any recipe that has my kids making dinner for ME!!!

Very good!  Cooking time was only 25 minutes. I took Jenny P's advice and did the following " and now I regularly use even more garlic (about 4 cloves), 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup bread crumbs (half Panko crumbs and half Italian), and 1/2 cup parmesan. "  I think we'll use even more garlic next time.

This chicken was great. I actually gave the recipe to my hubby (his night to cook). We decreased the garlic just a little to make it kid friendly, and he marinated it in the oil for about 30 minutes before baking. It tasted excellent, and wasn't dry at all. My husband thinks he is a gourmet cook now! (I usually get hot dogs on his nights!)

Excellent chicken recipe.  Simple to prepare and very moist.  I used extra garlic and added some rosemary and red pepper to the breadcrumbs.  A splash of hot chili oil in the olive oil gave the chicken an extra kick.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe...I prefer to bake chicken breasts rather than fry as uit is healthier and these came out moist and flavorful.

Absolutely incredible!!  This rivals my favorite chicken dish at our favorite Italian restaurant.  It was so tender and juicy.  I took the leftovers in my lunch the next day and everyone's mouth was watering.  This will definately be a staple at our dinner table.

I would double the bread mixture as I did not have enough, due to the size of the breasts.  I'd rather throw out unused then not have enough.

I actually started out to make a more lengthy recipe for basically the same taste. I am so glad that I was missing one ingredient for the other recipe which led me to this one. I used pre-frozen chicken breast tenderloins and it worked great. I also took another reviewers advice and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. This could not be easier and quick. I had the chicken in the oven in less than 15 minutes. The chicken turned out to be moist and delicious. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks for sharing, Carol.

I pounded the chicken very thin, doubled the minced garlic, used italian bread crumbs, baked it in a ceramic baking dish (keeps my chicken much more moist in any recipe  than a baking pan) and baked it for just 20 minutes - PERFECT!

I listened to others and used italian bread crumbs, extra minced garlic, and marinated chix for 30 mins, but it still seemed to be lacking something.  It was okay and definitely moist, but not something I'd make again.

I used this recipe in chicken parmesan.  It was excellent, especially for those that don't like chicken with a lot of breading.  The only changes I made were to marinate the chicken in the oil mixture for a while, and add a few favorite seasonings to the crumb mixture.  I did fry the chicken in the leftover oil mixture for a few minutes on each side since I was making chicken parmesan and would be baking it in sauce.

Just excellent! I used about 10 cloves of garlic to get 2 teaspoons...that's a lot of garlic. I also used garlic infused olive oil...just for that extra touch of garlic. No vampires in my house *smile*. I used 2 tablespoons of cheese; a blend of fresh ramano/parm cheese. I was concerned about the cheese because I have two children who HATE cheese, but they did not complain. It would probably be better with the full amount of cheese, but I'll take what I can get! I think I cooked it for about 25 minutes; the chicken breasts I used must have been on the smaller side. This will DEFINATELY become a staple! Thanks Carol!

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very dry and a little burnt on the bottom any suggestions on reducing the temperature and how long to cook for, other than that I thought the flavor was very good.

I was disappointed; turned out rather dry (and I turned it down to 375 cause it looked like it was cooking to fast!)Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly; needed more garlic, also salt/pepper as others mentioned.

This was so delicious and easy. I used fresh garlic and added extra. I also used bread crumbs that were already seasoned and romano cheese instead of parmesan because that is what I had on hand.  The chicken was crispy and moist at the same time. I served it with garlicky green beans and rice. Thanks for a great recipe...Will be making it often.:)

Very tasty!  I used butter instead of olive oil and used Italian style bread crumbs since that was all I had.  It turned out great and everyone loved it.

Chicken turned out very tender and moist.  Will make again, but will most likely add some additional seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture.

I chose to pan fry this rather than baking, mostly because I am always in a hurry.  Super easy to make... the parmesean in the breading is a different twist that I will use in other recipes that use a coating.  I used the garlic infused oil to cook it in also, as others suggested.  The ingredients are basic enough that I didn't have to run to the store, which is always an added bonus.  My husband took two servings.

The chicken was moist, but did not offer the flavor that I expected.  I will try again...I think I may have been a little too sparing with the garlic.

This is a great and super easy recipe. I also pounded the chicken breast a bit to make sure it's a bit thinner and easier to cook through in the oven.

I didnt have any olive oil so i used canola, I used minced garlic, and chicken thighs. It turned out pretty good. My oven burns everything, I cooked it at just below 300 degrees and the top was almost black. But thats my ovens fault. I think they would have been great had my oven worked right. I will most definately make again- Thanks!!

This is wonderful easy recipe! I would add even more garlic next time! I was thinking you could make delicious homemade chicken strips or get rolls and make great sandwhiches from this recipes. They turn nice and juicy but don't over cook. I will positively make it again , NO COMPLAINTS FROM ALL MY PICKY DAUGHTER YOU BET I WILL! Plus it is healthy but don't tell them.

For some reason, this garlic chicken wasn't very garlicky.  I will definitely add some garlic powder into the oil; fresh garlic mixture and I think the chicken needs to marinate for at least an hour to grab all of the flavor.  My family also told me that it needs a gravy accompaniment, which means it was dry.  I think Iâll cook the chicken at 350 degrees for an hour and see it that helps.  If these things donât work, this recipe wonât be made again.

A great and simple recipe to make chicken.  Not very garlic-y, but I'd imagine you could find a better way to get the garlic on the chicken to make it that way.

Excellent - I left chunks of garlic on the chicken breast under the breading and they definitely added to the flavor. I will make this again and again and again.

Was good, but didn't taste the extra garlic flavor I expected by using the "infusion."  Probably will cook it again because it's easy!

I had a whole chicken so I cut it up, marinated it in the garlic oil for a few hours and shook it in a bag with the bread crumbs and fresh parmesan.  It made a great meal for company and we almost ate the entire chicken, just the 5 of us (two are small children).  I found my son scraping the baking pan with the spatula and eating the burned bits off the bottom of the pan.  Great recipe, Thanks!

This was just okay, not great.  It was easy to make, but I won't be making it again.  I'll stick to my regular chicken cutlet recipe, dip in egg, then bread crumbs mixed with parm cheese and  tarragon, top with butter pats and bake.

Very tasty!!  Our family has a variation...try melting a stick of butter with the garlic(5 cloves), and olive oil...dip the chicken pieces into the oil mixture, then roll in crushed potato chips, mixed with some garlic powder, some seasoned salt, and some fresh ground pepper, and the parmesean cheese....the potato chips add a great texture and flavor!!!  If you like dark meat, cooking time increases 5-10 minutes.

My family thought this recipe was ok, but not as great as we expected. I used seasoned (Italian) bread crumbs and added extra garlic and salt and even red pepper flakes. It was definetly edible, but not super. Maybe I did something wrong.

I thought this was pretty good but I thought it would have had much more flavoring to it.  I think if I would make this again, I would use seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and add a little more garlic.

This was fantastic! I made this tonight and have already forwarded the recipe to my sister who loves garlic! It was really good as leftovers too. I cut up the chicken the next day and put it in a green salad, it was very tasty!

I made this recipe for dinner guests the other night with a nice bottle of Merlot and it was wonderful. I took the advice of the others and added a little more seasoning and it tasted nice and light. I didnt feel heavy after eating this dish. I will make this recipe again. Thanks Carol.

Delicious! So easy to make, it has easily become a new favorite in our house. Kids and husband loved it. As another reviewer said, I pound the breasts even to about 1/2 inch and watch the time as they can cook faster if they are thinner. I just love the taste of this chicken.

We enjoyed this, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I forgot to put the parmesan in with the breadcrumbs, so I sprinkled some on while baking.  I added a dash of cayanne pepper to the breadcrumbs along with some parsley and garlic powder to give it some more flavor.

Loved this dish!  I, at the recommendation of others, used italian bread crumbs, added more garlic and spiced it up with crushed red pepper.  I will definitely be making it again in the near future.  Thanks for sharing! :)

This recipe is soo darn good! The chicken was so tender and everything about it was just GOOD! It was easy to make and I was able to make a nice salad while it cooked. I will make this again soon.

Made this tonight for dinner and my family loved it!  I had to double the parmesan and bread crumb mixture.  Super easy to make and tasted great! Made the house smell good too.

This is an easy recipe that yielded very juicy chicken.  I seasoned the bread crumbs and covered for most of the cooking time.  Hubby was late, and the chicken wasn't dry at all.

What can I say?  This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious!  I followed advice from others and doubled the garlic as well as adding more seasoning to the bread crumb mixture.  No left overs on this one!

I forgot what other reviewers said and didn't double the garlic. The chicken was still tasty, but not as garlicky as I like. I will do it right next time! This recipe is simple and takes very little time to prepare.

Excellent, everyone loved this.  My only problem was
the garlic.  I used the my garlic press and it took 
too long.  However, this is a definite keeper.

Very easy to make, make sure not to overcook.  I cooked for an additional 10 mins because I never saw the juices running out but the chicken turned out very dry and tough.  If you like garlic, you may want to double the amount called for.

I took some of the suggestions and also added my own twist. To the breadcrumbs and Parmesan I include red and black pepper, basil, garlic powder, and paprika. I haven't been able to make anything else in a week!

The flavor was great. I added more garlic than the recipe called for.  The bread crumb coating could didn't firm up quite enough. The chicken cooked well and was very tender, additional cooking may have helped the coating but more than likely would have dried out the chicken. Overall, a good dish and very easy and quick to prepare.

This was delicious!  I added more garlic, and even burned the garlic a little by accident. I baked the chicken in my toaster oven, and it turned out wonderful--moist, juicy, and tender!  Thank you!  Will make this again soon.

Here is yet another glowing review.  This chicken is an absolute staple in our home.  I usually always have the ingredients on hand.  We love it served with Rice a Roni chicken and garlic flavored rice.  A really attractive and terribly tasty meal.

I would have liked it more if it had less olive oil - it was a bit too oily for me.

Delicious.  But as other reviewers have noted cooking it on a rack keeps it crispy.  You can substitute chicken legs and thighs but increase cooking time.

This is now my favorite way to make chicken.  I have made it MANY times since I first tried it a few months ago.  It is great by itself, with a side of green beans or with a full dinner such as spaghetti or even an alfredo sauce dish.  Excellent recipe...I have recommended it many times to friends and family.  Thanks!

I love this!  I cook one piece of chicken for myself in my toaster oven, and my neighbor came by the other day and couldn't believe how good it smelled.  He didn't know I could cook!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

This was pretty good, but I was hoping to love it more, based on previous reviews. The garlic flavor didn't really come through in mine. May try again.

I've tried a few recipes from this site, and this has been one of the best yet!  Instead of olive oil, I used light margarine and garlic powder (I'll add more next time!)  Great recipe! Thanks!

This has become a favorite. I've made it several times & it has come out perfectly each time. I did double up on the bread crumbs as the first time I made it, the crumbs didn't quite seem like enough.

This was VERY good.  My son had a friend spending the night, and we had this for supper.  He told his mother I was a good cook and she asked for the receipe, she said he kept telling her how good it was. I will be making this again and again.

Pretty good but I didn't taste much garlic....  i'd say maybe marinate it or add garlic salt to give it a lil more garlicy flavor.
I'd give it about a 7 on a scale of 1-10.
Thanks for the recipe :)

easy & delicious--I serve it with a fresh steamed vegetable like asparagus or broccoli or a green salad.  The children of course prefer it with the always popular corn and mashed potatoes. No green things!!

it may be  a good idea to season the chicken with a little salt first before breading.  Also, double the garlic.

Very quick and easy.  The chicken was tender and flavorful. This is a good recipe for when you want to put lots of cooking effort into something besides the main dish.  It's not 'out of this world!!' excellent.  It's a good dish that's easy to make.

This is delicous!!!  Next time, I will add a little more garlic.  Possibly sprinkle the chicken breasts with some granulated garlic prior to placing them in the oil/garlic mixture.  I also added chopped pearl onion to the oil/garlic mixture, and it was really good!  This is a winner!  Very good breading and crust.  My kids loved it too!

I don't eat red meat so chicken is the main staple of my diet. This recipe is by far the best chicken I have ever had...home-cooked or in a restaurant.  I make it almost once a week and everyone I've made it for has asked for the recipe.

The chicken tasted great!  I was a little worried when I saw all that garlic, but it turned out very well.  My family loved it, especially my two year old who doesn't like to eat meat.

great chicken recipe, moist and easy.  I cooked at 350 degree convection oven, 1/4 cup crumbs and parmesan are enough for two breasts.  Easy company dish, I will make again.

This has become one of my favorite chicken recipes. I suggest that the last 8 to 9 minutes of baking, if you have a spray such as Pam or simular to spray the top of the chicken, makes it a little more crispy. Love it, Thank you Carol

We loved this recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp worcheshire sauce and 1/4 tsp dry mustard
to the oil mixture.  Also added 1 tsp dried 
parsley to the crumb mixture.  I doubled the 
bread crumbs, but left the parmesan amount as
suggested.  Everyone gobbled up their dinners in
no time! Thanks!

This is a terrific tasting recipe and really smells DELICIOUS while cooking.  My two year old even likes the homemade "chicken nuggets" that mommy makes!

Loved this one.  It's easy and has a great flavor. It gets really crispy in the oven. A tasty dish that I will definitely make again.

I was searching for a quick easy recipe to use some chicken breasts I'd thawed out and came upon this one.  YUM!  My husband gave this one rave reviews and has been asking for it again ever since.  Definitely a keeper!

This is very yummy, but instead of the regular breadcrumbs, I used Italian.  The bake time seems to long, so instead of 30-35 minutes, I baked it 25-30 minutes.  I serve it with pasta and tomato sauce and everyone loves it!

This had an interesting flavor. I doubled the breading ingredients and added seasonings as recommended and it turned out crunchy and flavorful. I also used tenderloins instead of breast halves. I will make it again.

Great chicken, very tender and moist. I only had 3 breasts and ran out of breadcrumb mixture, will double next time.  Served it with creamed spinach, what a wonderful combination, my husband was very impressed.

yummy and so easy.  Just don't add any additonal salt to it.  I did and it was a little too much.  Added lots of extra garlic and used a pepper and garlic infused olive oil.  Mmmm good!

I've been making this for several months now - it is GREAT!! Quick,easy and DEElicious.. I use bonless/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I pound them a bit, use purchased Italian bread crumbs, fresh grated Romano cheese and lots of extra garlic.. Thank you Carol for posting!

Delicious and quick and easy to make for a spur of the moment dinner guests.  Also a good recipe for we single folks to make. Easy cut the recipe for only one or two chicken breasts.  Left over chicken tastes great on top of a salad the next day!

I really enjoyed this recipe. It didn't have much of a garlic taste though. I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. I will make it with fresh garlic next time for a stronger flavor. I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese instead of canned. It makes a big difference in flavor. I made the dish Chicken Parmesan style. At the end of the baking time, I topped the breasts with marinara sauce and mozzeralla cheese. It turned out wonderfully. I served it with spaghetti and garlic bread.

Excellent method, but do double the amount of garlic AND crumbs/Parmesan.  The result is also better if you use a really good, fruity extra virgin olive oil with the garlic.  Also, a few grinds of fresh pepper really lifts the dish.  Great cold, too.

Very good recipe. I substituted crushed chow mein noodles for the bread crumbs once and it tasted even better.

This could not have been more easy to make. The best part is that you can find all these ingredients in your kitchen - no special planning is needed. Plus, it was a big hit with my picky husband!

A great, quick recipe for the whole family.  The best part
was the fact that my kids loved it!  This is the only
way my older daughter will eat chicken!

Excellent easy chicken.  Add marinara and mozzarella for chicken parm.
