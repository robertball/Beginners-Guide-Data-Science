This is almost the exact same recipe as my Mom's.  But here's a tip to make this easier . . . Instead of preparing the mashed potatoes in advance, sauté the onions and celery in a large saucepan, then when they begin to soften, add the milk and water etc. according to the instructions on the mashed potatoes (I use chicken broth, not plain water) Bring to a boil, and stir in the potato flakes. Then you can stir in the rest of the ingredients right into that same big pot. It saves you a step, and extra dirty pots/pans. (I also add poultry seasoning to mine)

This is a GREAT recipe but you must use real mashed potatoes!  I added some marjoram because I remembered that my grandmother's recipe called for it.  I have lost her recipe, but this is the closest I've found to hers.  Thanks for submitting this.

My husband and I dont like the old dryed stuffing however I made this with no hopes of liking it and I must say I ate half of it and my husband ate the other half. This is so good and moist I will make this for life!

I don't really like stuffing, but I tried this recipe because it's potato based and I loved it! It still tastes like stuffing, just different. I had to tweek the recipe because I stuffed a chicken with it instead of a huge turkey. Yummy!

This is a wonderful recipe, but you must use real mashed potatoes, not flakes. A bit of chicken stock with this, is also good.

I was trying to find a new stuffing recipe for thanksgiving and this sounded interesting. I never have potato flakes so I used real mashed potatoes and Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing because I had just bought a bag to try. I’m sure it would be good as written but my husband and I absolutely loved it with these changes. When I make it on thanksgiving I plan to add a little poultry seasoning, chopped boiled eggs and some turkey because that will make it a little closer to what I grew up eating only better.

This stuffing was great (and even better the next day). I used butter herb mashed potatoes which made it very flavourful.

This is good. Definitely comfort food but a nice change from mashed potatoes.

3.15.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/56480/dutch-potato-stuffing/ ... I'm a bit undecided on how to rate this.  It was good.  I used 3.5c homemade mashed potatoes & added a t of poultry seasoning.  I decreased other ingredients as the prepared instant potato amount was more than I had.  This was kinda like mashed potatoes & bread dressing  in the same bite.  Duh, right?  I like 'em better separately though.
