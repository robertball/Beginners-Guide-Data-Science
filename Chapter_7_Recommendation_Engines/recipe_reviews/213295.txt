This dish was delicious! My family really enjoyed it. I mixed the sauce together, poured it over the chicken, then baked it. 400 degrees for 45 mins.

This was surprisingly good, my girlfriend and I will definitely make this again! I used a little extra honey (extra 1/2 tablespoon) and whole grain Dijon mustard, i used Trader Joe's mustard but would of used grey poupon if I had it. The meat was very moist and the sauce was delicious, this was very easy to cook and still filled us up! I posted the picture of the two chicken breasts in the pan, the sauce was more of almost a glaze but without the overpowering sweetness. I suggest trying it!

Pretty good! Next time I will double the honey mustard sauce and cube the chicken.  This recipe was quick and easy. It will definitely go into rotation at our house.

This was really good. I have made mustard chicken with a bunch of different recipes and I liked this one alot because it didn't seems as acidy as the others. I made exactly as stated except I added maybe a Tablespoon more of mayo, most because I didn't want to put that little bit back in the fridge. I also didn't cover when I added the sauce, I cook in cast iron pots and most don'thave lids.

Great Recipe!!! I absolutely loved it. The chicken was very moist and the sauce was extremely good. Also, it was very easy to make. :) Will do it again.

Easy and quick.  The kids asked for seconds and asked when was I cooking it again.  I may try it with fryer pieces next time.

Instead of using spicy brown mustard, I just used regular yelow mustard.  Just taking the basic recepie, I would double the sauce mixture, and even maybe extra honey.   Was quite good!
