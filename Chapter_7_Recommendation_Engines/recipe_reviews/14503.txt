Instead of boiling the ribs, I would suggest baking them at 250 degrees for about 3 hours (if you have the time...) this keeps in all the natural flavors- the marinade is great!  I added a little bit of sweet BBQ sauce!

Excellent recipe, my best ribs ever.

I boiled the ribs for 10 minutes, baked them in this sauce for about 2 hours at 300F, then grilled them for about 15 minutes using indirect heat on the BBQ.  As they were grilling I was brushing on more of the sauce, making a beautiful caramelized coating.

Easily restaurant quality.

I use this recipe time and time again, and I always get rave reviews.  I usually double the sauce so there's extra for people who like to dip.

This is great. I simply put the ribs [I used spare ribs] in my slow cooker- mixed the remaining ingredients, and cooked for about 5 hours. Then transferred to the bbq for a few minutes each side. Boiled the sauce from the crock pot w/ a little corn starch to thicken-it was wonderful!

OOooh, this is so tasty. My kids and I have a sweet tooth but my husband is a savoury man.  Well, when I made these the other night there (baked in casserole dish for 3hrs lid off for final 1/2 hr) he could not stop raving about it and has been nagging me to make more ever since.  It's a really easy recipe with pretty much store cupboard stuff and I'm looking forward to using it on different cuts of meat to see what it's like. Thank you this one's a keeper!

These were FANTASTIC! I used Bullseye BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup for some bite and DH and I couldn't stop eating them. So sweet and delicious we're getting more ribs this weekend to try it again. I also marinated them overnight. Try this!

Sauce is really good.  Sweet and slightly tangy, not the standard red BBQ sauce flavor at all.  Instead of boiling, I tented the ribs in foil and placed in the oven at about 335 F for about 2.5 hours, until the meat was tender.  Then I basted with the sauce, BBQ'd the ribs quickly to crisp them up, then basted one more time.  My dinner guests loved the ribs, especially the kids!

Karen, this recipe was so easy and delicious!  I'd never cooked ribs before, but followed your directions to the letter and the ribs turned out beautifully -- so succulent, tender and flavorful.  I loved the maple glaze as opposed to a heavier BBQ sauce.  This one is a keeper for our family (two weekends in a row so far).  Thanks SO much :-)

The marinade was not easy to work with and I don't think it made a big difference in flavor.  I think I could have just boiled the ribs and got the same result.

We had this fabulous recipe the other night and it was great! I even had country style ribs and they were tender and very flavorful. I was hesitant with all the sweetness, but once I grilled, the smokey and the sweet was hard to beat. Thanks

Excellent. You definitely want to double sauce. I was about to add BBQ sauce to original recipe, read more reviews and decided to try it as written....it is sweet and has a very nice tang.

This was delicious!  I did not have time for monkeying around as well so used boneless pork ribs, cooked the sauce a bit and then put all in a slow cooker.  Followed the sauce recipe exactly and it is so much better than most purchased BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used "country style" ribs which have lots more meat and less bone than baby backs.  I marinated for four hours vs. the two recommended.  I have never seen my kids (ages 13,11,8) attack ANY dish like they did these ribs.  Must be because the sauce is relatively sweet.  They even begged for the leftovers.  A HUGE hit at my house.  We'll do again on the 4th of July.

very delicious. Different and savory. My family loved it. I put some dry rub onto the ribs and then marinate it with the sauce and bake it in oven before taking it over the grill and basting it while it cook. Very delicious and the ribs came out very tender. My family loved it. They don't really like bbq ribs since my mom using doesn't add anything to it so I decided to be daring and found this recipe. Very tasting. I did use hickory smoke bbq sauce instead of ketchup. will used this recipe again

I dusted these my favorite rub and put them in the oven @ 350 degrees for 3 hours. I basted with the maple syrup mixture every 30 minutes. These were good.

Whole family loved this. First time I made it, I used pancake syrup instead of maple syrup. It was fabulous and doesn't taste any different when I use the pricier maple syrup. I have also substituted dijon or table mustard for mustard powder and it didn't affect the taste. I have also added a shot of brandy. Yum!

I use beef ribs: cover a cookie sheet with foil and then nonstick spray, put ribs on, spray another sheet of foil and cover ribs tightly. Bake low (225, 250) for 1.5 hrs or until done. Take out, baste with this awesome recipe, let sit in fridge covered, then bbq them for flavor. Fabulous!

This recipe was okay, but I did add some regular bottled bbq sauce to it because when I tasted themaple glaze it was too sweet for my taste.  I added about 1/3 of a cup of the bottled bbq sauce to the recipe and it turned out very yummy!!

I made this last night, and it was really good! I made just a couple of changes (b/c I didn't have certain ingredients)... I used beef short ribs. That was what was in the freezer. :) I simply put the ribs down in a metal baking pan, and then covered in the sauce. (I didn't have any worchestershire, so I used an extra 1/2 TBS of vinegar, b/c I didn't want it to come out too sweet). Then I covered it with foil, and baked at 325 for about 3-4 hrs (Turned once halfway through). Delicious!

These ribs were absolutely delicious! The meat was so soft and had so much flavor! The only thing different I did was left them marinating for 24 hours. But it made a HUGE difference. They were so good I had to make them again. However, the second time I only left them marinating for the time the recipe says and they didn't have the same flavor as the first time. I will undoubtedly make these again, but definitely leave them marinating at least over night. GREAT RECIPE thank you so much!

These were the bomb!  A little sweet, but really good.  I took others advice and baked them for 3 hours at 250 deg.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  Yummy!

The flavor of this dish is absolutely amazing. Instead of this mehtod, though, I browned the ribs in the over and then  thrwe them along with the other ingredients into a slow cooker for 8 hours. Fell off the bone and tasted wonderful all the while.

This was very tasty.  I didn't marinade the pork due to lack of time so I think next time I will make over the weekend.  I will also pressure cook my Ribs to speed up the tenderizing.

Delicious!! Only thing I changed was cooking method. After marinating, I threw them in the oven at 350 for 1 hour covered, then 15 - 20 minutes uncovered. They came out perfect!! I doubled this recipe to feed 3 children, ages 10, 9 and 6 and 2 adults and there was not one left!! This is a time consuming recipe but definitely worth it if you have the time!

I used this recipe with grilled chicken for a Canada Day Barbecue. I precooked the chicken, boiling it for 15 minutes, before barbecueing. Everyone really liked it. Very versatile sauce.

Excellent!  By far the best ribs I have made.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I marinated the ribs overnight.  My DH LOVED them.

These were awesome!  I made ahead for a camping trip and marinated them for a couple days.  By the time we grilled them, they were incredible!  I wouldn't change a thing.

We really liked this recipe. Refreshing change from bbq sauce. The ribs smelled so good while grilling! We served this with sweet potatoes and a salad. Tastes like fall! Yum :)

This was excellent! Very easy! I put the ribs in the crock pot, poured all the remaining ingredients on top and slow cooked it on low for about 8 hours. The meat literally fell off the bone. I didn't have maple syrup, so I just used plain old pancake syrup. My whole family loved it!!! Will definately make again and again.

Great recipe! If I could, I'd give it 10 stars! I used country style ribs instead and substituted the cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar. Steamed the pork to preserve the flavor, but meat was not as tender. I think I'll try boiling it next time. My boyfriend couldn't stop telling me how great it was. Definitely in our top 10 list.

We loved these!  The only change I made is that I added about 1/2 tsp of crushed garlic to the marinade.  I did double the sauce because I love a lot of sauce, but what I had left after marinading never got used because the ribs were perfect with just the glaze.  Oh, and I only had 1 hour to marinade because I started too late, but I don't think it made a difference.

Very good.  Extremely sweet.  I used syrup made with splenda to reduce the sugar. Like the reviewer before me I like a little heat with my sweet.  I added a few hot pepper flakes. I only added a pinch but I should have added more.  Will try again.

Very nice flavor.  I usually prefer more heat in my ribs but I did enjoy this.  Next time I'm going to try adding some heat to them because I think the maple would be nice with hot spice.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for Father's Day and foudn that the sauce was good but a bit sweet.  I added some store bought BBQ sauce to make it a bit more tangy.  Good overall.

So in all honesty I did not use this glase, but used all the preparation techniquest to prepare a honey-mustard glaze.  It made all the difference.  Previous reviews on the honey-mustard glaze said the flavor was good but did not marinate into the ribs, so I found it very helpful to use these instructions with that recipe.  Thanks!

Very yummy and easy. Used spare ribs instead. Could have been a little more tender but that could of been the cut of meat I used. Very sweet but good.

Absolutely the most delicous ribs ever!  So easy to make and the meat just fell off of the bone!!  Didn't use baby back ribs, used country ribs.  Simmered for one hour, marinated for two hours, baked at 350 for one hour! The flavor is wonderful!  I made this for "food night" at work and everyone raved and raved about these ribs! I will make these again and again! Thanks!!

I followed the recipe to the "T" I even used REAL Maple syrup, except I used pork country ribs. My family did not care for these. They taste like maple syrup on ribs, and they were really dry. I will not make this again-I would rather use bottled Hunts Original BBQ Sauce. Sorry.

These were very yummy and tender.  I was running late and only marinated them for about an hour and they still were fantastic.  It was my first time making baby back ribs and I'm glad I chose this recipe.

Tender and yummy!  I made this last weekend and it was the talk of the town.  Everyone loved them and asked me about the ingredients.  Wished the sauce was a little thicker.  Will try adding cornstarch the next time to thicken it.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for sharing an easy and delicious recipe.

Awesome Awesome recipe!  We made this for ourselves and loved it! Since then we have served this to guests, and have always received rave reviews. It wasn't difficult at all.  It is a little time consuming, but we have shortened the marinating time and still had excellent results.  I don't have kids, so I have no idea if kids even like ribs or not.  But as for adults...if you love BBQ, you have to try this recipe!

Very good recipe!! We used it on ribs and quite tasty BUT we also tried them on free range/farm chicken wings and they were AMAZING!! I found that if you make the recipe the day before it thickens up nicely in the fridge. We used real maple syrup and I think it is pretty mandatory - with the store bought "maple syrup" it is all sugar with maple flavouring, no real maple taste at all. If you are making the wings, bake them in the oven (if you have a pizza stone definatley use!!!) at about 400deg F for about 10-15min on each side (season with pepper only). Depending on the size of your wings you may need to bake shorter/longer. Turn wings again and bake at same temperature and time.  When the wings have a nice light golden colour thats the time to baste them with the sauce. Again 10min on each side bake and baste both sides (repeat as needed) until they are cooked completley. Save a bit of the sauce and brush on at the end to boost their flavour.  Give this one a try, you won't be sorry!!

This is a really tasty way to fix ribs.  We've had them twice and will certainly have them again.  And unusually, I wouldn't change any of the ingredients!

Not my favorite!  I made the recipe as stated and it was not good.  Because I had based dinner around having ribs and  I decided to doctor it up as best as I could. (added so much stuff I can't even remember) Then I cooked the ribs and they were ok. My husband liked them as they were but I had to eat mine with some plain old BBQ sauce from the pantry. Gave three stars because at least my husband and pup dog like it.

We made these twice on the BBQ over the last summer and really enjoyed them.  Good flavor and the meat did actually fall off the bones.  I see in the reviews that someone did them in the crockpot and I will definitely be trying them that way.  Both my husband and I love the sauce - we add thyme, garlic and pepper.  Yummy!

This was very tasty and it was a nice change from a basic BBQ recipe.  I didn't have ribs so I used pork chops instead and I marinated them for only 1 hour.  They still came out very flavorful and really juicy.  We will be using this recipe again!  Thanks!

This is def being added to the regular recipe list in our house. I used the ingredients, and threw the whole mess in the crock pot, and cooked on high for 4-5 hours. Then I had my boyfriend taste, and he wanted me to add some BBQ sauce, so I did, and cooked on low for anther half hour or so. They meat was fall off the bone tender, and apparantly, in my house anyway, this recipe serves ONE hungry man. Leftovers? What leftovers?

I thought these were good but I would have preferred a BBQ sauce.  My husband loved them though which surprised me because of the sweetness, but it wasn't overpowering sweet.  Maybe it depends on the amount of glaze you put on while grilling.  To answer a recent poster's question, I believe baby back ribs are the best and most tender ribs you can buy.  But I'm always wary of meats on sale which often seem to be less than good.

WOW....my husband gave it a "ten"...and that is rare.  Ribs came out tender, but not overly tender, which was good...boiling first is key, but some people boil them too long, then they are just a mess.  One hour is perfect, and the glaze was awesome.  Will make again for company..Thanks!

Excellent!  Rather than cook the ribs in water then marinate, I put them in the slow cooker with the sauce for 2-3 hours on low, then grill for 15-20 minutes with extra sauce.  These are incredible - I love the flavor!

These ribs were tender and tasty, but very sweet.  I added bbq spice mix to the pot before simmering the ribs, and I added bbq sauce and a few splashes of hot sauce to the marinating sauce.  The kids loved them, but they were a tad too sweet for the adults.  I would make them again, but spice them up a bit.

I only marinated my ribs for the 2 hours, but next time I'll keep them in it longer.  Very tasty and sweet...I'll be using this marinade for pork chops in the future.

I usually prepare a lot of this marinade at one time and keep it stored in the fridge.  We grill often, even in the winter months and I use this marinade with a lot of different meats.  I would even let my mother in law taste this one.

I don't eat ribs, but I just made this for my boy friend. It was a huge hit! I cooked them in the oven in the same dish that I marinated them in. I cooked them at 350, and I flipped them during the 20 minute cooking time. I reheated some for a friend and she thought they were just like the ribs she had eaten in a favorite Chinese restaurant a few years ago. All together a huge hit!!! Thank you Karen!

Yummy :) The only thing I changed was that I marinated overnight and after marinating, I baked uncovered instead of grilling (no grill available). Baking was done at 375 degrees for about 1 hour and 15 minutes (Estimate). Ribs were turned over once to brown both sides.

Wow!!! I ran out of food!!  How embarrasing.  People were smacking their fingers to get every last taste.

I made a couple of adjustments that I think really mattered.  First, I boiled the ribs as directed (I did it the the day before) and then I tightly covered them with heavy duty foil and bakeed them at 300 for abaout 3 hours.  The meat literally fell off the bones.  I also added RED WINE VINEGAR to the sauce to cut the sweetness and then a bit of original BBQ sauce. After the sauce came to a rolling boil, I simmered it for a long time.

Thanks for sharing your receipe!

Since the temps were way to hot to BBQ outside, I put the ribs into a 9 x 13 pan, poured the sauce over the ribs, covered with foil and baked at 330 degrees for 2 hours. uncovered for baked for another 30 minutes.  Absolutely the best sauce ever!

This was a great base for a sauce however, I had to make it twice as the first time it was just sweet tasting meat with a pretty glaze. When I added other items, it became a hit. The 1st batch of ribs were only eaten after the 2nd were gone.

I made these ribs on Christmas Eve.  But I didn't read the whole recipe before hand and didn't know the cooking process.  So I ended up boiling the ribs for an hour and then putting them on a sheet pan in the over with the sauce at 375 until they were gooey and brown.  They were to die for!  Everyone loved them and totally pigged out on them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This sauce is very sweet when you first taste it, but not quite as sweet once you're finished cooking the ribs.  I doubled the sauce and baked the ribs in half of the sauce in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 hours, then put them on the grill for 20 minutes.  I only used 1/2 cup of maple syrup and added BBQ sauce to cut the sweetness.  My 9-year old son liked them because he has a sweet tooth!

I followed this recipe exactly except for using the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Dry and not tender. Usually the crock pot is safe....not with this recipe. Maybe adding some water to this recipe would help slow cook the meat.

This recipe was wonderful!!It was a big hit with all my guest. I boiled the ribs in water for an hour but added a little garlic powder,vinegar, and just a touch of salt.  I used an indoor grill and the recipe was absolutely wonderful!!!The glaze is fantastic.

The glaze is good, but a little too sweet. The appearance is appetizing and the flavor is very good. We put ours under the broiler instead of grilling and the result was wonderful (but watch carefully so it doesn't burn!)

Ribs are Dad's favorite, so what better meal to have for Father's Day.  My sister made these and the maple glaze was outstanding.  The sauce was not overpowering and super sticky like other rib sauces.  Finger licking good!!!!

These were pretty good, but a little too sweet for our taste.  I will try again cutting down on the syrup and maybe add some garlic and soy sauce.

These were the best ribs I ever had.  My husband and dinner guests agreed!  I had to make two batches of the sauce and served leftover marinade with the meal; it was great on rice.  I initially thought the cider vinegar was too much but with the meat it was perfect.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Very good recipe.  Ribs were falling off the bone.  The sauce was yummy too.  Husband LOVED it as much as I did.

DELICIOUS.  I'm not sure I can describe these without cursing, they were so good.  I started with 2 large slabs of good quality side ribs.  The only thing I did differently was make a bit more glaze- about half again as much as was called for.  I was glad I had.  It worked out just right for the amount of ribs I had.  I didn't even marinate for as long as it said (just couldn't wait!), but even with just an hour in the sauce these were perfect.  Sweet and tender ribs.  Yes, we ate them ALL.  This was my first try at ribs, and I may have to retire undefeated.  Definitely the way a rib wants to be treated.

Oh my golly!! This was sooooo good. I could've just had rib bones covered in glaze and been happy. We used beef ribs and they turned out really tender and juicy. We ate all of them!!

Neither my husband or son really care for ribs but I decided to make this recipe anyway...and they ate every last one! My son even asked if we had any leftovers so he could have them for lunch today, but of course we didn't. And while I was making them it smelled so wonderful that my neighbors asked about them. I simmered the ribs a day ahead and marinated them over night. They were great!

I added a little bit of chili and they turned out GREAT! I used pork chops this time, but I think it will taste even better with ribs. Definitely try it again.

My husband brought ribs home from the market for the first time.  I'd never prepared them myself before, so went to the web for a quick but interesting looking recipe.  The ribs were the best we've ever had!  Thx.

These are, by far, the best ribs I have ever tasted.  The slight hint of maple flavoring gave them the edge for me--can't wait to try another batch.  Their tenderness is just right, as well.

Speaking as the world's WORST cook, I've made these ribs at least half a dozen times (twice for guests), and not only did they turn out perfect every single time, but they are incredibly delicious!!  I can't wait for the Minnesota snow to melt enough to fire up the grill again!

I actually used this "glaze" as a marinade for boneless chicken breasts and then placed them on the grille using the reserve for basting.  Incredible taste!!  The glaze is easy to make, then let it cool and place washed chix breasts in a zip lock bag with the marinade for several hours.  Big YUM!!

Wonderful!  I used beef ribs and baked them in my clay cooker for 2hrs and threw them on the grill for about 10-15 min a side with more sauce.  They were falling off the bone!  Yummy and gooey!

This is a great recipe if you want decent ribs that are fairly quick and very easy.  Granted they are not as good as slow smoked ribs, but it can satisfy your cravings.  I usually let the ribs sit in the sauce overnight, and I also add a little more Brown sugar and less ketchup.

I've been making these ribs since 1989, when the recipe came out in Canadian Living Bbq cookbook. Lost my book, so happy to find the recipe has been copied here. I boil the ribs in half water and half oil with lots of seasonings added in. It makes them crazy tender and infuses flavour into the meat instead of sucking it out with boiling. Meat does not absorb more fat, so don't worry about adding oil to the water.

I made the recipe as it it written. It was too sweet for my families taste. If you like a sweet glaze, this one is less sweet than most, and the maple syrup adds a nice touch. I used a very high grade of maple syrup. Not for my family, but it might be good for yours.

To be fair I did not have all the ingredients listed (had to substitute white vinegar for the apple cider,  and bottled brown mustard for the dry). I had   6 lbs of ribs so doubled everything except for the maple syrup because  of reviews saying it was too sweet. Glad I did that because withh just half the amount of both, it was still very sweet!  I added a splash of bourbon as another reviewer had. Good movethanks for the hint!

(if you don't have a BBQ) Boil ribs for one hour, marinade for 2 hours in fridge, separate ribs and sauce, put ribs in oven at 350F  for about 30 minutes, cook marinade for about 5 minutes on stove and baste ribs as they are cooking in the oven

Try adding 1/4 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper to the marinade as it simmers- adds a bit of heat that is a good offset to the sweetness of the maple syrup.

Awesome sauce!! I made 3 racks of ribs for a family get together and the ribs were a hit! Instead of boiling them I baked them on 350 for 2 hours (mind you there were 3 racks). Also, I substituted half of the ketchup with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, once I put them back in uncovered for 50 mins on 350, I coated the sauce on about every 10 minutes leaving the meat side up the whole time. Excellent!!! Will be making them again this weekend by request for another BBQ :)

OK BUT THE SAUCE NEEDS TO BE THICKENED. I DID THEM IN THE CROCK POT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THEN ADDED THE SAUCE AND FINISHED THEM IN THE OVEN.

These were great.  In fact my husband said that they were the best ribs he's ever had and he's had tons of them.  Yes they are a bit time consuming but well worth the work.  Thanks so much.

I have a couple of tips for you to make this outstanding.  First remove the membrane on the back of the ribs, it helps it to cook more tenderly.  Next, after you cook it for 2 hours or so in the oven wrapped in foil, grill it on the grill for a half hour, basting it with the sauce until it is sticky and fantastic.  I also used a 1/4 c bourbon in the sauce and it gave it a deeper flavor.  Really good though. My whole family was raving!

very good recipe, I boiled my ribs for about 15 minutes- put them in a pan lined with foil & poured the marinade over the ribs & topped with sliced onion.  Covered it with foil & baked at 300 for 2 hrs.  After they were done in the oven I let them rest covered for about 30 min then tossed them on the grill topped with a little regular bottled bbq sauce and let them go 7-10 min.  They were WONDERFUL! much better than the batch I tossed into my crock pot.  It took a little more work but they fell right off the bone.  Def a superbowl favorite this year!  I added a few things to my taste (garlic, fresh ground black pepper, etc) but it stands strong.  I was concerned it would be far too sweet from testing the marinade alone but I'm SO glad I tried it.  THANKS for sharing & thanks for all the other helpful comments!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I actually bake the ribs instead of boiling them.  My husband and kids love them, this is the only recipe I use for ribs.

I made these yesterday for our cookout, and being my first attempt at making ribs, I was a bit nervous. They turned out great though. The glaze was fantastic and everyone raved about them. After I let them soak in the sauce for a couple hours, I put them in the oven at 275 for 3 hours, instead of boiling them, and just kept coating them with the glaze. They turned out delicious. I'll be making these again.

This is the first thing I have reviewed.  Here goes.  Loved it! Didn't use the crushed red pepper flakes, but kicked up the cayenne a little.  Loved the cinnamon.  My daughter, who never bothers with ribs - too fussy for a large family - asked for the recipe.  So, there you go.

This was by far the best rib recipe I have ever made.  I did boil them for 10 mins and then baked them slowly in the oven with the glaze making sure to turn and coat them every so often.  Then onto the bbq for just a few minutes brushing the sauce on them.  They were fantastic.  Even my 11yr old son who usually doesn't say much about his food was raving about them.  When he tells me I can make them again I know the recipe is a keeper.

This is the best ribs recipe I have ever tried. We made it yesterday for Memorial Day weekend and it boiled for close to two hours, and it still was super delicious, very tender. I had to print out the recipe for two more people. Excellent!

I made these using 6 lbs country style pork ribs. I boiled them as per the recipe, and finished them in the oven, for 30 - 40 minutes at 350 turning once. They were very tender and fell apart. I made the sauce exactly as the recipe states, doubling it. I used grade B (very strong flavor) real maple syrup. Everyone enjoyed these, especially my nine year old. My husband thought they were a little too sweet, but enjoyed them anyway. We will have these again for sure.

A delicious glaze. Preparation is somewhat difficult and time sensitive. Don't use this recipe if you have to be somewhere later. However, if you have the time, it is wonderful.

These ribs were GREAT!! I cooked them for my July 4th BBQ, and got to eat just one!  Everyone gobbled them up so fast and gave me compliments all night. Dying to make again for a family dinner.

These were good but my husband and I both think they didn't have as much flavor as we had hoped. Maybe we are just used to ribs with bbq sauce. We will prob try them again with a couple alterations next time.

This was a very tasty recipe.  It's a nice change from the sticky, heavy BBQ sauce that you usually get on ribs.  The glaze was nice, light and sweet.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this recipe again and again.  Everytime my family visits from Quebec I ask them to bring maple syrup.  Finger licking good!

I used pork chops instead of ribs and baked everything in the oven for about 2 hours. The sauce is sweet with a little bite.

Terrific!

I have always used just the Brown Sugar, adding the maple syrup seemed to give the vinegar less of a bite.  I was surprised when my guests noticed the diffrence.
