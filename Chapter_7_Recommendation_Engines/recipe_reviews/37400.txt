You need to be quick from the caramel to the pretzels otherwise the caramel hardens and the pretzels won't stick.  All in all caramel apples are a mess and a pain to make...this will be my last time.

This is yummy.  It really satisfies a sweet tooth.  It's also good if you use chopped pecans in place of the pretzels.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
