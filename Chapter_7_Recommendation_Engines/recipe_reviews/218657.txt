Was trying to find an easy recipe to make for a tailgate and came across this one. I doubled the recipe right off the bat.  Cookies turned out very well and were very tasty - soft, but also chewy, especially the next day.  This is a keeper recipe for me.

These cookies are good! I tend to use half butter and half shortening for my cookies, and I did so for this recipe as well. I also cut back the sugar by 1/8 cup, as I was using sweetened coconut. (use 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons). Very delicious!

I did not have enough coconut, so I used half a cup of coconut and half a cup of chopped dates.  The cookies are wonderful.  We will eat them up in no time!!  Very sweet, just like the name says.

I really wanted this recipe to turn out great. Maybe I should have made one recipe then the second separately, but doubled it. Using big Oster mixer on #5 (whip) it took about 15-20 min for sugar (Apriva)/veggie shortening/eggs/extract to be light and fluffy. Decreased speed then added sifted flour/baking powder/salt 1/2 cup at a time. By the time it was all in the bowl, dough looked like medium to large crumbs. Added coconut and mixed by hand. Not able to use teaspoon so rolled dough in hand and broke apart to measure about 1 teaspoon. After baking then cooling, cookies tasted powdery. Will leave on plate overnight and see if taste increases. I guess I had visions of coconut maroons on my tastebuds. Question? I've always sifted flour first then measured. This recipe says add flour and dry ingredients then sift. Sifting after measuring creates more volume. Was this my problem? I would have loved giving better review, but at this time I can not. Will update later.

Oh my, I loved this cookie! First batch used ingredients as listed except substituted butter for shortening. Turned out perfectly delicious. 
I like trying new things so for the 2nd batch, added some crushed almonds and dark chocolate chips, plus a 1/4 tsp. of cocoanut extract. These turned out very good, but if you just want the cocoanut taste, go with the original cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful easy cookie recipe!

Turned out perfectly. I was making it for a reception too, so I needed something with a great presentation great taste! The recipe is almost foolproof! The only thing I did differently was use 1/8 cup less sugar, since the coconut was already sweet. I also used a tablespoon measure coated with Pam to make perfect little cookie drop circles. Finally, before putting in the oven, I put some extra coconut shavings on top for a garnish. They turned out so pretty and golden brown!

Amazing. As others, I cut down on the sugar and I used a cube of margarine instead of the shortening but they were great. The only thing I didn't like was NOT being able to stay out of them.

Very easy and quick!  I used rum flavoring instead of vanilla and it tasted great!  Also decreased the sugar by 1/8 cup due to the sweetened coconut and used butter instead of shortening.

These are more like a 3.5 the only thing I did differently was to use unsalted butter (I avoid shortening whenever I can).

They were good but there was a buttery, filmy, residue feeling in my mouth after eating one. The recipe as is made 2.5 dozen cookies.

Overall a good, but not great, recipe. I won't go out of my way to make them but if everything was on hand I might do it again.

I always make a recipe my own.  
I used butter in place of shortening, instead of sugar i did a quarter cup of raw local honey.   
I used a duck egg (as it doesn't indicate what size of egg).
I did 1.5 cups coconut, and 1/2 cup flour

Mine turned out great.   Nice and moist they taste like macaroons.

Baked these yesterday.  They were delicious.  Like others have said, I used butter instead of shortening, cut back sugar by 1/8 of a cup and only used 3-1/2 oz of sweetened coconut.  Trust me there was plenty of coconut and definitely sweet enough just like I wanted them to be. Definitely a keeper. My son in law loved them.  He likes desserts with coconut.

so good.  I used butter flavored shortening and a tad more vanilla.  I also left in the oven for about 7 minutes longer as I like the toasty crispy "macaroon" texture  on the bottom.  A keeper.

For a quick and easy coconut cookie this recipe turned out great! I followed the recipe as close as I could using the ingredients I had on hand. I had only half of the amount needed of vanilla extract so added the difference in almond extract. The coconut I used was a small dry type, not the sweetened angel flake stuff. My batter was a bit drier because of the coconut used so I added just a little milk to get the right consistency. I rolled mine by hand in small equal sized balls. They turned out fab!  This is the kind of recipe that you can play with. Next time I'm going to  add chopped dried cranberries, some chopped macadamia nuts and then press a tiny bit of cold butter in the center of each before baking, yum!

These are an easy basic cookie recipe. I substituted almond extract for vanilla and grated in 6 oz of almond paste. So good!

GO MAKE THESE NOW! I used butter in place of shortening and followed the advice of another reviewer by lessening the amount of sugar (since I used sweetened coconut). There was more than enough dough to make a dozen cookies - so I put the rest into mini muffin pans, which also turned out fantastic.

Excellent! Was quick and easy, texture was great and taste  just how I love  my cookies. I should have double the recipe, my daughter ate quite a few within minutes of taking them out the oven. This  will be in my  oven  very often
