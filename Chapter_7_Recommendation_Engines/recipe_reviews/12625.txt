I've made this many times using the condensed milk.  I got a tip from my Irish friend -- you can boil several cans of the milk and then put them back in the cupboard until you are ready to use them.  One time I gave her back is to buy pre-made caramel in the can.  It's called Dulce de Leche and can be found by the Mexican food at your grocery store.  It's exactly the same (according to my friend from Ireland).  You do have to soften the dulce de leche up a bit to make it spreadable - easy to do in the microwave (out of the can of course!).  Just made it last night - great stuff!

Yummy!...Instead of boiling the can of condensed milk I pour 2 cans into a 9 X 13 dish and cover with tin foil, put that into a larger oven dish, fill it with water half way up the 9 X 13, then bake at 300 degrees for 1 and a half hours---makes a wonderful toffee!

Absolutely AWESOME!!! This is FANTASTIC!! I was worried that one can of condensed milk wouldn't be enough but it was spot-on. (By the way, PLEASE don't worry about the can exploding. I've done it dozens of times, and I've lived to tell the tale... I do, however, make sure that I am around to top up the water as it boils off. Also, be careful when you open the can - the second it is punctured, the boiling hot milk oozes out. I wrap the can and the can-opener in an old towel, thus protecting my hand). Thanks so much, Madeleine!

Definitely put the bananas under the caramel.  Also on  top of the whipped cream you can sprinkle finely grated chocolate, or instant coffee granules and cocoa.  The first time I had it in England, it came with the coffee dusting, and that's the way I'll always remember it best.

Very good pie. I made a few changes, though: I made a graham cracker crust (but I unfortunately forgot to put ginger in it), I boiled two 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk for about 2 3/4 hours. Let stand them for 10 minutes and poured them into a medium bowl, stirred with a fork to make a more spreadable consistency, and poured half of the "toffee" into the bottom of the crust. I garnished the toffeed pie with thinly sliced bananas (about 1/4 inch) dipped in lemon juice, and poured remaining toffee onto bananas. Not oversweet, as I feared it would be. As another reviewer suggested, I flipped cans at mid-boiling time. Very easy, but very good, and can easily be served for company. Thanks for the recipe.

Of the recipes I've found, this one came closest to the Banoffi I had at the Shack Restaurant in Dublin, Ireland.  My friends agreed.

Despite my friend Andy's fear, the can of condensed milk did NOT explode.  But I was careful to keep enough water in the pot. 

I used 1/2 cup of butter as suggested by the last reviewer and this worked very well.  I also used 3 bananas instead of 2 and added about 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the whipped cream.  Next time I might try a deeper dish pie and add even MORE bananas.

I had been searching for a recipe for Banoffee for a while.  When I was in England in 2001, nearly every restaurant had some kind of dessert with this flavor, whether it be ice cream, pie, cake, etc.  It's such a good combination and this recipe is no exception.  You have to follow the recipe for the crust, because the ginger makes the crust.  I took this to several gatherings of family and friends and it is always well received.  It is different, but not so different that people won't try it.  I was nervous about boiling the can too, but I've done it now at least 3 times with no explosions, so it's fine.

okay first of all, I cut down on the butter quite a bit. Only used abt 1/2 cup that I melted in the pie plate in the oven. Then, I added the crumbs with the sugar and mixed it all in and pressed it gently to cover bottom. I omitted the ginger, as I don't like it much. I baked the crust in a 375 oven for a few minutes just to dry it a bit. Then, let it cool. As for the condensed milk, I used a 300ml can and the best and easiest way was to boil it in a big sauce pan filled with water, so I didn't have to watch it as closely. Only added a bit of water each 1 1\2 hours. Boiled it for 4 1/2 hours. I let it rest abt 30 mins. Didn't ooze out much cuz it had cooled. It was nice and firm and creamy and brown in color. I thought it may have been overcooked, but thank goodness, it tasted great! I also added a bit of sugar(1 tbsp) to the whipped cream, and shaved chocolate on top. Beautifu looking and my whole family loved it! They said it was really very delicious! Thanks for the recipe. Easy and delish. Worth the wait!

This pie is still popular in the UK (my husband and I traveled to Ireland in August, 2012). After I came home I had to make this for my husband and his all-Irish family. The first one lasted all of about 2 minutes, which was about the time it took to slice it all into about 12 pieces! I think the pie is too sweet, but everyone else I know LOVES it. Here's a GREAT TIP: Make the toffee by emptying out 2 cans of condensed milk into 8-oz. jelly jars (you'll need 3 jars to 2 cans of condensed milk). Fill to within 1/2 to 3/4-inch from the top of the jar. Place clean seals and lids on jars. Place in 6-qt. or larger slow cooker. Add enough water to cover jars completely. Cook on low 8 to 10 hours overnight. Not only will you not have to worry about letting the water get too low and having exploding toffee all over your kitchen, you can check how caramelized the toffee is before you stop cooking (which you can't when you cook it in the can) and add time if you need to, AND you'll have toffee ready for your next pie, because the jars seal themselves during the cooking!

The pie tasted great.  I made a few adjustments on the recipe, 1 cup of butter made the crust way to "soupy"...so i doubled the graham crackers and filled 2 9 inch pie pans istead (i had planned on making 2 pies anyway).  This was the first I had made this recipe, and had heard about it from my boyfriend whos aunt makes it in England.  I think the next time we make it we will boil the can for 3.5 hours and flipping the can half way through to cook the milk more evenly...as the top half was quite runny.  Anyway..fabulous!! A must try! Its worth the 3 hours cooking the condensed milk!

This was sooo easy.  I used an already made graham cracker pie shell and I used two cans of condensed milk.  The longer you cook the milk the better.  I also always use a plastic knife to cut the bananas - supposedly this lessens the browning of the banana slices.

First off, this pie is insanely delicious!  Don't make this pie if you don't plan to eat it within 24 hours, it doesn't save.  Even 24 hours is pushing it. Don't use lemon juice on the bananas, unless you really like the flavor of lemon in your banoffee pie.  Personally, I think lemon juice distracts from all that delicious banananess.  Use as many bananas as you like, the more the better.  Once the sliced bananas are slathered with whipped cream, they won't brown within the short shelf life of this pie anyway.  Canned Dulce de Leche is an excellent substitute that cuts the prep time dramatically.  If you were really lazy, like me, you can even buy a pre-made graham cracker crust (Keebler is pretty good) sprinkle a little ground ginger (use a light hand!) on the bottom, spread on the caramel, layer on the bananas, top with whipped cream and viola!  You have a pie you can serve right away.  But don't.  Chill it thoroughly no matter how much you want to dig in.  Last, you should really make this pie from scratch at least once, as stated in the recipe so you can decide for yourself which method suits you best.  But either way, quick and easy or not, will yield you a grand pie you can proudly serve to your family or guests.  Don't miss this one!

Got a lot of compliments on this one and loved it myself too!! Boiling the milk in the can is pure genius and worked perfectly! I just brought the water to a boil and then turned down to simmer for the rest of the time. The crust should use only 1/2 to 1/3 cup of butter. I also put the bananas under the toffee to reduce mess and halved the cream as well and garnished with Skor bits on top (available at your local Bulk Barn or you can crush up your own candy bar!). Got rave reviews!

I love Banoffee pie! I have never added ginger before. The recipes I have used add a little instant coffee to the whipped cream. A hint- If you have a deep enough crock pot you can simmer the cans on medium heat for 5 hours and the water doesn't cook down as quickly- you still have to watch it though. I usually only have to top it off once during the time, and it's a lot less scary.

I think the layer of bananas could be thicker, and it's a little rich but it's quite an experience.  Though I was really impressed at first, over the week I have noticed it's not something I will make again.  It's just too much for us, only half of us are eating it and slowly at that.  Thanks for showing me something different though!  Boiling condensed milk is just not my area.  I would probably appreciate it more if I were familiar.

The pie is fantastic exactly as written.  I'm not sure how the nutrition information was tallied though.  Don't know if this matters to everyone but this is what I got using a Keebler Ready Made graham cracker crust.  Whole pie crust = 880 cals and 40 grams fat.  Can of La Lechera Dulce de Leche (same as a can of condensed milk) = 1200 cals and 30 grams fat.  2 medium bananas = 210 cals and .8 grams fat.  1 cup heavy whipping cream (yields 2 cups whipped) = 821 cals and 88 grams fat.  The total of all of these is 3111 cals and 159 grams fat.  This divided by 8 = 389 cals and 20 grams fat.  This is considerably less than what is listed...approximately half.  Now we can enjoy a second piece :)

I was skeptical about the boiling of the condensed milk.  I thought that I would walk by the stove and, any minute, shards of metal would be embedding themselves in my forehead.  I was wrong.  I boiled it for 3 hours and toffee was born!  The only thing I cheated on was using a store bought graham pie crust (all I had).  It seemed the ginger was critical to this recipe, so I sprinkled some ground ginger on the inside of the crust.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  This was heavenly and so easy!  I served this yesterday as my dessert for Easter dinner.  Even my father, Mr. Fussy Sweet Tooth, raved about it.  I'll be making this again for our Royal Wedding food day at work this week.  I must say, jolly good!!  :)

First, ONLY 1/2 CUP BUTTER IS NEEDED.  I think it might be a misprint.  I make my own crumb crusts all the time and went against my instincts by following this recipe, only to find myself blotting butter off the surface of my crust.  A few modifications- I coated the banana slices in melted high quality 70% dark chocolate, placed them on the crust, let it chill in the fridge and then poured the warm toffee over when it was finished simmering.  Wonderful in my opinion, but my tasters gave mixed review.  Thanks

On top of the crust, I added a layer of melted chocolate that I made with 2 squares of bittersweet chocolate (I didn't want to add too much more sweetness).  It was a GREAT addition.  Definitely top the pie with a little ground coffee and cinnamon.  Delish!

I have tried Banoffee twice now. The 2nd time I changed the recipe by adding 2 cans of sweetened
condensed milk and only 1 tea. of ginger. Three teaspoons of ginger was overpowering. I could not taste the toffee. I, like others, used only 1/2 cup of butter also. My wife does not make desserts; but, she and the rest of the family did'nt leave a crumb. She was even bragging about my culinary art to a friend the next day. Thank you.

So great! Definitely agree with the suggestions to cut the butter in half and put the bananas down first with the toffee on top. This would be amazing with just those changes, but I had to take it a little further...
Crust: I used about 1.5 tsps ginger in the crust and also added quite a few shakes of cinnamon and a shake or two of nutmeg. I also added a little bit of sea salt.
Pie: I sprinkled the bananas with a little cinnamon and a pinch or two of sea salt before putting the toffee down.
Whipped cream: I just happened to have a single-serving packet of NesCafe instant caramel latte mix on hand, so when I whipped the cream, I added about half the packet along with a little powdered sugar and some vanilla. After I put the whipped cream on the pie, I sprinkled it with a little more of the latte mix and a dusting of cinnamon. 

...so pretty, and so delicious!

If you're worried about boiling the can you can put it under water in a slow cooker on low for about eight hours.

Oh, so tasty.  I was a little concerned with the timing on the toffee--recipes across the web range the boiling time from three to six hours.  I settled on four and a half, which gave me a nicely firm toffee (I stirred it with a spoon for a minute before adding it to the pie shell to make it more spreadable--it was very thick).  I liked that it wasn't too sweet, and the combination of flavors was excellent.  Thanks a lot!

This is a great simple recipe for banoffee!  My brother begs me for this pie whenever he's in town.

Used ready made crust. Absolutely loved it.  A quick fix for the bananas that are too ripe to eat, but would hate to throw away.  
Word of caution to boiling the can of condensed milk: I did a research, and there have been incidents that the can may explode. Make sure to immerse the can in water, and keep it immersed to keep the pressure inside stable.

I would have given this more stars if the crust recipe had been legitimate.  As it is, the crust recipe ends up being a bunch of graham cracker crumbs floating around in a pool of melted butter.  Just make a normal graham cracker crust recipe and add in some ginger.  I would half the ginger next time I make this.  Next time  I make this I will also add one extra banana.  It is delicious - I love the flavors of the dulce de leche, ginger, bananas and graham crackers.

Turned out pretty well but I would follow the advice of other reviews: less butter, less graham crackers as it turns out quick thick, and less sugar.

It was delicious.  The only issue that I had was that it seemed like WAY too much butter.  I only needed about half of that.  
Like many of you I was afraid to boil the can for fear it would blow up.  It didn't.  However, perhaps I didn't let it cool long enough because when I started to open it with the can opener some of the hot toffee squirted out.  Thankfully it didn't hit any skin!

I spent time in England a couple years ago but the first time I had banoffee was in the British West Indies and I fell in love with this dessert. Since I got home I have been searching for a recipe so i could enjoy it stateside, and this one is delicious and easy! I have also tried it with an oreo crust in place of graham cracker. There is no bad way to make it or eat it :)

My husband is from the UK and grew up on banoffee pie.  His feedback was that the crust made it too sweet and he preferred a standard crust.  Also, he believes that instant coffee should be mixed into the cream, although I thought that cocoa sprinkled on top got the job done.  As a final comment, this is better with a thicker sliced banana to help balance the flavors.

The whipped cream was way too much- around 1 cup would have been enough. Overall, too sweet for me.

Oh so delicious and rich. Try mixing a bit of instant coffee or espresso powder into the cream as you're whipping it for another flavor. **CAUTION** It is extremely important to add more boiling water frequently during the cooking of the sweetened condensed milk. 3 hours is a long time and the saucepan should not be allowed to boil dry.

This was so simple and the end result was so good!  I'm not a big sweets eater, so it was a bit rich for me (a little piece goes a long way), but still good, and my family loved it!  My picky 10 year old daughter proclaimed it the best pie she's ever eaten!  She even ate it first at Thanksgiving so she could make sure she got a piece! We used a pre-made pie crust, and whiped cream.

I was really surprised this turned out the way it was supposed to.  Indeed, the cans did not blow up like I thought they might, but you do need to top up the boiling water - every half hour or so. I agree on less ginger. I love ginger, but I used two teaspoons, and that was still too strong.

I must admit that I used Cool Whip for the topping instead of real whipping cream and it still tasted great (it was the fourth pie I made for Christmas so I needed to hurry things up a bit). I also used two cans of sweetened condensed milk instead of one. If you do this, use three of four bananas instead of two.  The bananas add a fabulous flavor.

So, I'm not one to write many reviews but I think this recipe was great.  My boyfriend has been talking about this dessert for years now and I've never had it before. I'm told it came out amazing by a few friends that tried it. It seems most people that enjoy this had it in Europe, but I'm glad to have found an easy recipe for something so difficult to find. It does take quite a long time to make the toffee but all the rest of it was pretty simple.  It is really sweet, but so addictive. For those complaining about it being too sweet, if you've ever had toffee before, you should know it's supposed to be sweet!

Made baby portions in ramkins instead and turned our fantastic. Substituted hob nobs instead of graham crackers. I'm now asked at every dinner party can I make mini banofees. Great recipe. Well done

It was a rocky road to pie. Learn from my failures:
I cooked the can in my crockpot on high for 5-6 hours, flipping it halfway through. I put it back in the cupboard for another day.
I thought the amounts of butter and sugar in the crust sounded like too much. I used 6 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup sugar. It tasted great and had the right consistency. But then I baked it a little. And that was a terrible idea because I cooked it too long - 10 m @350 and the butter pooled a bit and then hardened into a chewy rock-hard cookie when cooled. I couldn't open the can as cooking the milk in the can caused it to expand and my electric opener wasn't having it. I'm not sure if I could've opened it with a hand opener or not. I had to use a steak knife to slice through it. Caramel goop everywhere in my sink, on the counter, in my hair! As it was not warm or hot I couldn't pour it into anything. I spooned globs into the shell and had to spread it using my fingers. I used the banana slices to push it down and into edges when I put them on the pie. And then I cut the cream to 1-1/2 cup and threw in a few tablespoons powdered sugar and vanilla extract while whipping. It still produced too much cream IMO.  The pie is good and I may make it again (although it is SO rich) but: use caramel day of while still warm, have an old fashioned opener, leave crust raw (still use less butter/sugar), use 3 bananas, use 1 cup heavy cream. I'd also toy with using a regular pastry crust instead.

Unfortunately the measurements for the crust on this pie is way off. There is about 3x more butter than there should be & I don't need so much sugar in the mix either. I alsO found that the filling was very sweet (for me) so I'll add more bananas next time. The filling is a good base recipe to follow with some changes, but I'll stay away from the graham cracker crust.

This is really tasty!  Personally, I don't think I need the crust to be so thick so probably use 2/3rd's of the crust recipe next time. And yes, for sure we'll be having this a next time!

The flavor of this was delicious, although a little rich--a small piece goes a long way. But it was way too much butter for the crust--it was super hard when chilled because of too much butter. I also like the bananas on the bottom and the toffee on top. I'd make it again, but with a lighter crust and more bananas.

This is one of my favorite desserts and I have a few things that I do differently. Instead of ginger I use cinnamon, and I only add two Table spoons of sugar to the crust ( that reduces the sweetness and the calories ). As for cooking the sweetened condensed milk, I have discovered that submerging it in water and cooking it in a pressure cooker takes 45 minutes only!! and you can cook at least two cans together!

I made this recipe once as is and it was good.  I made it again with a couple of tweaks and it was outstanding!  First, I used three bananas instead of two, second while the sweetened condensed milk thing is cool, it is far easier (and taste exactly the same) to just buy a can of dulce de leche.  You can get it in the latin section of the grocery store (at least in Texas you can).  Third, to cut the sweetness a little I made a coffee flavored whipped cream by dissolving 1/2 a teaspoon of instant coffee in the cream. Just let it sit a couple of minutes and it will dissolve, then add 1 teaspoon of sugar and whipped the cream per the directions.  I also put the bananas in first and made it in a cheesecake pan for a pretty presentation. In short, the recipe as is is pretty good, but the changes I made took it to the next level.  I can't take credit for the changes though, I used the original Hungry Monk (where banoffee pie originated) recipe as guidance.

my sweetheart and I made this recipe for the first time and OMG! it turned out to be super delicious. We loved it!!! He sprinkled dark chocolate shavings on top of the cream and it looked irresistible.we used 8 oz cool whip instead of thick whipping cream and it was yummy. we took ebabysmom advice to use Dulce de Leche, it saved alot of time and made it an instant dessert. Dont think twice about adding the ginger to the crust, definitely gives a spin to the flavor. we thought 2 large bananas would be enough but atleast there should be 4 layers of banana to make it a BANoffee.

I learned about this recipe while in England and had to try it once I learned that all you had to do was be brave enough to boil a can of condensed milk.  I to started out with over 3 hrs of boiling but I've experimented by having a large kettle with up to 5 cans boiling and sacraficing a can at 1.5 hrs and the toffee was just fine.  I also like to add sugar and vanilla to the whip cream.  Also I will try nutmeg the next time I make the crust as some people aren't fans of the ginger.  In the end the best part is describing to people how you boil the condensed milk, they're all afraid that it will explode.  Now I can point out that I'm not the only crazy cook doing this.  Hey maybe the Myth Busters on the Discovery channel need to experiment with trying to make a can of condensed milk explode.

I didn't care for this very much.  I did just use the dulce de leche in the can in the spanish section of the grocery, as another poster said was the same thing without all of the work of boiling the can.  I guess the taste was just something to new for me.  I felt it was just way too sweet. I think dulce de leche could be good in a dessert in a much smaller quantity or as a flavoring in a dessert or drink, like coffee, since it is so rich and sweet.  My favorite part was the whipped cream and bananas.  But, I think the point of the dessert was the addition of the thick dulce de leche bottom.

So good! Made it easy by using store bought pie crust. Added more bannana slices than called for. Loved the flavors!

I made this for my daughter's 20th birthday. I did cut the amount of butter in the crust. I also wimped out and only boiled the condensed milk for 2 1/2 hours, my nerves couldn't take any more. My daughter said this was one of the best birthday cakes I've made for her. Thankyou Madeleine.

If you can, buy the condensed milk already caramalised.. (In Australia you can get them at most supermarkets) Much easier.. I lightly cover my bananas in lemon juice to stop them going brown.This is way nice served with vanilla ice cream..

This pie is absolutely delicious and I prefer making it myself, rather than buying it in the shop. I only boiled my tin of milk for two and a half hours, though, and it was a bit runny after slicing the pie. Next time I will definitely boil for at least 3 hours, but I think it wouldn't hurt at all to boil for 3 and a half, or even 4. I've read some recipes where it calls for 4 to 6 (!!) hours of boiling -- so next time I'm definitely going to go beyond 3 hours to avoid runny toffee! Otherwise this recipe was spot on, though I did use Digestives for the crust and omitted the ginger.

This recipe would have gotten all 5's except for the need to make doce de leite.  If you are living in Brazil or another country which eats it by the truck load, then you can find it already made at the grocery store, however, I found when making it with pre-made doce de leite that the pie did not "set" very well, it was very goopy and had to spend a day in the refridgerator.  If you have kids I recommend using premade so they can make it themselves, but if it's for yourself make the doce de leite.  Also, for the crust, since it's hard to find graham crackers, I used frosted flakes (ground up) and nutmeg, and reduced the amount of butter in the pie crust and it turned out REALLY well.

This recipe is delicious, but I made a couple changes:

1. Reduce the butter in the crust to 1/2 cup.  1 cup made the crust too soupy.  2. I mixed crushed graham crackers with crushed ginger snap cookies for the crust and it turned out great.   And 3. definitely put the bananas down first before pouring on the toffee like others have suggested.  

Everything turned out perfectly, I would make this again!

Simply, WOW!  Very good.  Did the 1/2 cup butter suggestion and that was perfect.  Everything else I followed the recipe, andit worked.

Next time I will try the Mexican store suggestion for the basically already boiled canned stuff.  Wasn't hard to boil cans for 3 hours, but a bit of a pain to have to keep checking on it and for it to put all that moisture in the house.

This is so simple to make and delicious. I thought it would be too sweet, but the plain whipped cream on top actually helps to balance it out. Because of that, I do not recommend using Cool Whip or any other pre-made whipped topping.

WITH A TWIST - My first introduction to Banoffee was on a safari in Zimbabwe, and it became one of my favorite souvenirs. It is now my go-to dessert. My twist is to layer the ingredients in a clear plastic drink cup. Top the last layer of whipped cream with a few toasted, chopped pecans or peanuts for dash, and insert teaspoons. It is great for a crowd or on a buffet. Cut down on trash if you are able to use glassware at home. Off I go to the football party.

Love it!!  I was scared of the cans exploding, but after reading how many people do this successfully, I went ahead and gave it a shot.  The toffee turns out so rich and thick!  I was really surprised at how easy it was to turn out such beautiful caramel.   Only change for me:  I'm redubbing this pie "Caranana" pie for my friends and family.  Here in the US South, we think of Toffee as that crunchy candy with nuts covered in chocolate.  Caranana will work better here.  :)

Very tasty. But the whipped cream needs a little sugar and pie needs more bananas! With these additions this banoffee is quite good.

I make this in a cheescake pan.  It is beautiful when finished and taken out of the pan.  The trick is to allow the milk to boil long enough for a thick enough caramel to hold together.  I will make this time and time again.  It is ALWAYS a show stopper!!!

I'm not sure what to really say about this pie! It's so very sweet yet the whipped cream has no flavor to it and it gave me a tummy ache after I had a slice. If you like VERY sweet desserts then this is a great pie but I suggest using ready made whipped topping. I also used a ready made graham cracker crust to save time. The best part of this recipe is the science of how the milk turns into a yummy caramel

This was very good, but I cheated a lot. I used a pre-made crust and cool whip topping. I would have used prepared dulce de leche if I could have found it, but instead I boiled the condensed milk for not quite 3 hours. Next time I will boil the milk for 3 hours or more, but will keep the other cheats!

It's true that this recipe is delicious and simple (though time-consuming), but in my pie shell filled with extra banana, I still had WAY to much room to fill with whipping cream. It turned out almost like a throwing pie for all the whipped cream!  I think that it needs a LOT more banana to fill a regular pie shell.  The pie crust had way too much butter and I had to soak a lot out with a paper towel!  Also the ginger in the crust gave it a mysterious-but-not-really-good flavor.  I think I'll try a graham cracker and nut crust next time, or even a gingersnap/graham cracker mix.  Recipe worth messing with!

Emm,OK, but....A couple of things.  First, I'd never had Banoffee before, never even heard of it. I used 1/2 c. butter and 1 t. ginger for the crust.  I thought the crust was too sweet with 1/2 c. sugar.  I baked the S.C. milk @ 300 in a water bath, as another reviewer suggested, but for 2 hours.  (I guess it turned out like it would have if I boiled the can, but I'm not sure.)  I used 3 bananas, sliced very thin.  I dusted instant coffee (pushed through a sieve to make a powder)and cocoa powder lightly on top of whipped cream.  Like I said, "OK" by me.  People said it was really good.  Don't know if I'll make this again.

I was very anxious to make this because of the unusual combination of ingredients, and I was a little disappointed in it.  I thought the banana flavor overpowered everything else, and when you took a bite of everything together you couldn't even taste the ginger in the crust, and the toffee was more a texture than a taste.  By itself I loved the crust, and would like to try it with something else.  I put the can of condensed milk on its side while simmering it and avoided the noise some have mentioned.  Although the condensed milk had a gelatinous quality when I opened it, after I put it in a bowl and beat it with a spoon it became smooth and easily spreadable.  I would recommend using only 1 cup of heavy cream.  I had a little less than 2 cups and thought it was way too much.  The people I served it to loved it, but this is South Alabama where banana pudding reigns, so I guess the banana flavor wasn't too much for them!

This is yummy, its just the boiled milk I had a bit of trouble with. Mine came out kind of clumpy and didn't pour over the bananas, but I had to spread it, sort of like a peanut butter consistency, but a bit more rubbery. Therefore, the first can didn't cover my bananas, so I had to use the second can I boiled. Now maybe my toffee to banana ratio is off and it will be just too much...Also, be careful when you first open the can, I used a bottle opener and it spurted out onto my hand - hot sugar - ouch!

Absolutely delicious!! Just boiling the sweetened condensed milk was dessert in itself! If you are looking for something to turn heads this one is for you!  If you don't have ginger I think it would be great with a gingersnap crust or just as delicious with plain graham cracker crust.  Awesome thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I first tried this pie in England and I wanted to see if I could recreate it for my English boyfriend. I used crushed gingernuts for the crust and omitted the sugar and extra ginger. I also used three bananas instead of two. I was really worried about the milk exploding because the top was bulging out a bit. But no problems, and I think next time I will take another reviewer's advice and make a couple of cans at a time. All in all a delicious pie that looked fantastic!

While living in Northern Ireland, I would eat this like there was no tomorrow whenever my mother-in-law would make it. Since my in-laws are in town visiting, I wanted to try this out and see how it was received. I slacked a bit on the condensed milk - I substituted (as others have done) the milk with Dulce de Leche, which is easy to find in any store in Texas where I now live.  My only complaint about my dish was that the bananas in the store were not as ripe as they should have been for this dish. I topped it with whipped cream and finely chopped pecans. My mother-in-law seemed to really love it, which made me very happy. I am glad I came across this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Used Ginger Snap biscuits as the crackers in orginal receipe not avaliable, I found the ginger a bit overpowering but my guests loved it. Used 2 cans of Condensed Milk and boiled for 3 1/2 hours (and left in saucepan with lid on - heat off - overnight) toffee was nice and thick.

Too runny, I really had to encourage folks to try it. But those that did loved it. Still, I wish it looked better.
The next time I cooked the condensed milk even longer, it comes out less runny.
This is my variation:
I made a crust with crushed regular salty pretzels, and less butter. Cooked milk alot longer and I sprinkled crushed chocolate covered pretzels on top of the cream. the salt and sweet were awsome together, don't knock it 'till you try it!

This recipe is the best one I have found.  I did change the crust, I only used room temperture butter and baked the crust for 5 minutes on 350*.  The condensed milk makes the pie sweet enough for my family...

This was a very tasty recipe, but after over 3 hours of boiling the condensed milk it was still a bit runny, and i had to put the finished pie into the freezer for a while to be able to cut it without it pouring all over the place. Tasty but not very visual appealing.

As other reviewers said... cut way back on the ginger.  I used 1 1/2 tsp. and I think I'll cut back even more next time.  All in all, it's a tasty dessert, especially dusted with coffee!

This pie tasted really good but looked too unappealing for my youngest to try. The condensed milk gets thick and caramel colored. My husband preferred it without bananas and thought some nuts might have been good. I also used less ginger in the crust.

Made this for my book club - we had an English theme after reading Rebecca.  Everyone loved it!  I didn't have time to make own crust, so I used a ready made graham crust and still tasted great.

The can bounced and clanked around in the pot, but did not explode :)
Slight changes:
1/2 a stick of butter was plenty!
2 tsp. ginger
3 bananas
This pie got good reviews from everyone. However, I'm not sure if it was worth the time to attend to the boiling can for 3 hours. To my tastebuds, it tasted like a very good pudding pie (which, on the contrary, can be whipped up in a few minutes).

I added more bannanas and drizzled with chocolat to accentuate the flavors as well as making a much better presentation. The ginger crust is suprisingly good. This recipe took some "doctoring up" but the end result was good.

I made this recipe for a dinner party this past weekend and got RAVE reviews!  Everyone loved this pie.  I made a couple changes per other reviewers suggestions.  I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk and four bananas.  The combination of the graham cracker crust and the sweetness of the cooked condensed milk was amazing!  Thank you for this great recipe. I'll be using it again.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!  I would make it a thousand times!! I did modify it a bit though.  Instead of 2 cups of heavy whipping cream, I just used one and that was plenty!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe so we could all enjoy it.

I really didn't like this, but, since I've never had Banoffee Pie before, I have no idea whether it's just me or the recipe. First of all, boiling a can of condensed milk for 3 hours is a pain in the butt. When the milk had boiled for 3 hours, I opened it and was horribly disappointed. I was hoping for a sort of Dulce de Leche; instead, it was like a very rubbery jello and didn't taste very good. I continued with the pie making, but it didn't get much better as the pie is dependent on the boiled milk. Whipped cream and bananas can only cover so much. And I had such high hopes!

A Delicious pie.  I only used 1 cup of cream and 1 1/2 bananas and that seemed to be plenty. Next time I make it I will also make sure the water covers the top of the can of sweetened milk or I will boil it with the lid on so the milk gets cooked all the way through.

Sooo good...have already given the recipe to six people. Unique, flavorful, and the ginger in the crust is a MUST, so don't use a ready made one. Boiling the can? Who knew? Definitely a keeper.

Fun recipe. I made a competition version of this recently that worked out well with a couple of variations - (i) used stabilized whipped cream (see "Stabilized Whipped Cream Icing" recipe), (ii) used a springform pan rather than a pie tin so I had structure to really build up the crust and then the whipped cream above that before it set, (iii) used McVitie Digestive biscuits  in place of graham crackers for the crust and (iv) dropped the ginger to 2t (i find 3t a bit aggressive). On the "toffee", if you have time I'd suggest you experiment. I found 3 hours gave it more of a dulche de leche consistency and upping the boil time to 3:30/3:45 gave a darker, more toffeeish flavor.  Topped with grated dark chocolate and espresso powder.

I haven't made this pie but had to comment that it is not a traditional English dessert. I am from the UK and it is not made that much I would say it is more American ? I had to put a star rating as it would not let me put comment !

I made this for my British friend, and she loved it! I only used half cup of butter, as many reviewers recommended, and only half the whipping cream was plenty to cover a 9-inch pie. I added some powdered sugar and vanilla extract to the whipped cream, too. And I personally sprinkles coconut flakes on my slice. What a simple, delicious dessert!!!

Only change I made was buying a pre-made graham cracker crust. It still tasted fine, and got good compliments, but next time I would definitely try making the crust with the ginger, it would balance the flavours more. Overall though very nice and easy.

I have made it twice with some changes:
- use only 1/2 cup butter for crust
- bake crust for 10 minutes at 325F
- let crust cool before adding toffee
- use 2 cans of unsweetened condensed milk
- remove labels before putting in water
- boil water first, then turn to simmer and add 
  cans, simmer for 2h15m for great consistency
- for more even results, turn cans over after 1h
- cut banana slices thick for better taste and mouth feel

I will re-review when I make it again. But I need help!! I boiled that can for 3 hours in a glass sauce pan (only kind I have) I turned it over after 1 hour, but left it in place for the last 2. I filled the pan several times to keep the water up to the top quarter of the can.  

But both the top and the bottom burned and when I poured it out it had dark chunks .  I really want to make this for Thanksgiving but it was pretty itchy

any ideas? just turn every 30 min? place on a rack in the water?

This is so easy and tasty!  I made one addition to the ingredients ~ as my husband (a Brit) loves custard, I added a layer of instant vanilla pudding.  Being a Brit he has to also top his desserts with Birds Custard (it's a bit ticker and sweeter than pudding) ~ he just can't get enough the stuff.

This is such an easy way of making Banoffee pie which is my favourite! I added a layer of bananas on the bottom as well and put it in the fridge as soon as the toffee on top overnight before adding another layer and the cream. I have also seen chocolate sauce or ice-cream sauce put on the base to add some extra chocolate flavor. Thanks so much for this receipe...certainly a keeper!

awesome banoffee! made 2 yesterday following recipe exactly. they were so popular had to make 2 more today. but I felt a bit lazy today and used store bought graham cracker crust, which I sprinkled with a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground ginger and also tried the pre-made dulce de leche instead of boiling the cans for 3 hours...both ways were equally delish!

Very tasty, My mother always boiled condensed milk in a can but for about 5 hours then when cool would open both ends and push it  out we would slice it or just grab a spoon, it was a firm soft caramel

This was really good! And very easy too! I made this as written except that I used a pre made graham cracker crust and I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the cream. Super yum! I could not get a good looking slice out for the life of me, but it still tasted fantastic :)

I'm sorry, but this was way too sweet for our tastes. I also think the crust recipe could have done with about a quarter of the sugar. It was interesting to try, though, and diffewrent from anything I have ever made. Thanks!

This is a wonderfully decadent pie, and is SO easy!  I made one and my hubby and 2 sons wiped it out in a matter of seconds, and demanded I make it again tomorrow!  That's coming from some tough critics, because I make desserts most every night because they won't eat leftovers, even desserts!

I truly had doubts about this and I was really just making it because I thought it was interesting to boil the can of condensed milk...but oh my!  This is amazing!  Kind of like a carmel banana cream pie but oh so much better!  This may be on my top 10 favorite desserts list!  I highly recommend trying this - it's fantastic!!!

1st place winner at our county fair.  Easy to make.  2nd time I made it, I used the crumbs of leftover scones in place of the graham crackers and it worked great.  I also used 1/2 the whipped cream topping, to cut the calories.  Besides it already impressed the judges.  I agree on using the 3 tsp. ginger, it seems to balance the flavors.

QUESTION for you that have tried it, has anyone incorporated chocolate somehow?

Having spent many cofused hours wondering what graham crackers are (someone please tell me!), I ended up using crushed ginger nuts and added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of the ginger. I also found that i didn't need to use the sugar as it was sweet enough without. Many thanks for a fantastic recipe.

This is a very rich pie.  A fun choice for entertaining.  It leaves an impression on people.  (I had it at a pub on the edge of the moores when I was in Scotland.  When I found the recipe here I was over joyed.  I had been looking for over year.)
