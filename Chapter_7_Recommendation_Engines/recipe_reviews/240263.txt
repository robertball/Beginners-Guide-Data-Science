This rissoto is wonderful. The red wine makes this dish stand above other rissoto recipes. I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and sautéed the mushrooms before adding. There was such a rich depth of flavor. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I love red wine risotto! . . . and this is scrumptious! I usually end up adding a smidge more liquid whether it be the chicken broth, wine or even a little light cream. This recipe also tastes yummy with the addition of green peas. Definitely a family fave!

Very good and easy to make. I like using red wine instead of white which is called for in most risotto recipes. Only change I made was adding less chicken broth more often, so I was adding a medium ladle every 2-3 minutes but still finished in about the same cooking time. Also could finish with a little grated Parmesan and parsley on top to make it more pleasing to the eye.    Would make again for sure!

The recipe as it is is a bit salty, omit adding salt in the last step and put less Parmesan cheese and it should be ok.

First time ever making Risotto, the directions were easy to follow, and it turned out great! The wine really gave it a nice flavour.  My guests loved it! I have added it to my favourite recipes!

It's hard not to like something that has all the ingredients that you love!  I made half this recipe and followed the ingredient list with the exception of the parsley, which I substituted with arugula--my favorite sub for parsley.  I do think that making the whole thing would have been better because the cooking time for half the recipe goes a little fast for working the broth into the rice mixture.  It definitely needs the salt and pepper seasoning at the end.  Make it!  You won't be sorry!
