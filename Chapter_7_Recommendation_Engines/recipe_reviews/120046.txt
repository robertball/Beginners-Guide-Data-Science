This went down the disposal I'm afraid. It's my own fault, as I knew the balsamic vinegar didn't belong in this recipe, but I went ahead and tried it anyway.  Balsamic vinegar is good stuff and complements a lot of foods. But not rice.

This was delicious and beautiful!  Used brown basmatic rice and served with Chicken with Asparagus and Roasted Red Peppers from this site.

Really good. I think next time I'll add some cherry tomatoes and top with parmesan.

Suprised that this was really good! Balsamic sounded like it was overpower but it's really mild. This is a very fancy side dish, made it as is and it's really mellow, fancy and tastey.

Being a new cook, this dish was easy (but it doesn't turn out LOOKING easy), and tastes great! This will make it into the rotation for sure.

I really wanted to like this but my husband and I both thought it was quite bland. I will probably try again and do some changes to see if I can enhance the flavors.

Very bland. Had to add more balsamic vinegar, italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and greek seasoning to get it to a palatable level. Won't be making again.

Great - and even better, the perfect fridge clean out for me tonight. I'm trying to get more veggies into my family's meals and this will be a great go to. Added bonus, I can already see how with a few switches around this can go in a lot of flavor directions! (Mexican, Asian, etc) I used rice cooked in stock, extra garlic, and some garlic oil. Just yummy.

Very good and easy to make. I made it with a little extra spinach because we love it so much but changed nothing else. Excellent flavor. We had it with the Easy Tuscan Chicken, which is also really good.

I made this without the rice and oil, plus I steamed it all in the microwave. This has great flavor and is an excellent side dish! Thanks!
