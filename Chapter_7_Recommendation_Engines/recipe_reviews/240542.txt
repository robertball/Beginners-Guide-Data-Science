I made 4 minor changes and loved it. 1.) added 2 tablespoons of Franks Hot sauce to eggs & milk. 2.) used no-salt seasoning salt 3.) omitted oil in baking pan and 4.) placed chop on a rack over a baking sheet.  Got a "Really Good Mom" review!

We need to differentiate between types of parmesan cheese. Powder is what you want to use here. I used some shredded cheese, I'm a higher quality ingredient guy and used the good stuff. The cheese burnt in the oven. I double dunked and breaded the chops. Good recipe. Going into rotation.

VERY good, although I had to make a few adjustments and minor changes. I didn't have the correct bread crumbs, so crushed Italian- flavor croutons. I fried the chops (I only had 2, and adjusted seasoning accordingly)in an oven safe skillet, using bacon grease instead of olive oil. The seasoned salt I used was Slap Ya Mama Cajun spice, and I used it sparingly. I put the skillet in the pre-heated oven and the result was amazing. Plus - only 1 pan to clean!

I have been making these for years and it's a family favorite. Great as written or if you use plain breadcrumbs you can change it up with your own preference of herbs and spices. Thyme, rosemary, paprika, almost anything works well with these. I've even made them using taco seasoning. (Omit the parmesan) I make a sauce by warming some sour cream with a little lemon juice and taco seasoning and serve them with rice and a vegetable. Delish! If you don't have bread crumbs, crushed crackers work well, just cut down the added salt. Depending on the thickness, once you brown the chops, they don't need much time at all to finish in the oven. I place them briefly on paper towels first to soak excess oil and don't use any additional oil on the baking pan. This is pretty much a no fail recipe as long as you don't over-bake them. IF you have any left over...they are great cold the next day! Thanks for posting the recipe!

I found this recipe just last night and since I had the ingredients required and read the reviews which raved I decided to give it a try. needless to say I am not disappointed . these where delicious . I did make some tweaks of my own and used the hot sauce idea as suggested by another user and I'm in love. will be making these again.

I used a pound of pork chops and followed this recipe except for only using way less of the seasoning salt. They were on the dry side.

Very good comfort food.  They come out very tender and tasty.  The Parmesan cheese is the hit.  However the measurements for the herbs seem off.  I just used 1/4 tsp of garlic and salt.  Will definitely make again.

I made these tonight. I have never before succeeded in making boneless pork chops that did not turn out dry. These were moist! the flavor was good, though a tad salty. I will make these again with less or no seasoning salt. thanks for sharing this recipe!

I wanted to make this on Pork chop night, but we needed to have something a little faster. So tonight I made it with boneless chicken breasts... yum!! I used herb-stuffing, but it in the blender with the spices. Also, drizzled the olive oil on top of the chicken for a little crunch. Served with pasta and brocolli.. yum!!

Good recipe. I used bone in chops and baked for 25 minutes, could have taken them out a bit sooner. Pretty easy to whip up too, thanks for the recipe!

I added some aromatics -- thyme, herbs de provence to the baking cycle and left out the salt.  Totally unnecessary with pork.  I also used Panko instead of breadcrumbs.  Try it, you won't be sorry

This recipe was scrumptious! I did everything as the recipe instructed. I will make these pork chops again. The only change that I will make is omit the oil in the bottom of the baking pan.

Delicious!  I agree that less salt is needed. I kept the ratio of salt, onion powder and garlic powder the same. I also used a cast iron skillet so I could transfer that to the oven. I added the cheese with about 12 minutes left to avoid th cheese burning. I used shredded Parmesan. Will definitely make again!

I did cut the seasonings in half.  Powdered seasonings are always stronger and thought it would be too much.  I was right.  With that change, this was one of the most delicious recipes I've ever tried with pork chops.  Will DEFINITELY be having this again!!

I made this with thick bone-in pork chops. I sauteed onions in the same skillet when browning the chops, also tossed in the left over breading and stirred then I added all this to the pan when it went into the oven. This was a great stir in of crunchies for my side of rice. About 10 mins. before done, I added the parmesan and tented with foil.

I did make one substitution.  I did not have bread crumbs handy but had saved crumbs from Cheese Flavored Chex Mix that accumulates at bottom of bowl or bag.  I added some flour and the seasonings to it which made a very tasty coating.

Iâ€™ve found that using dry grits gives a great crunch instead of bread crumbs. Did half grits/half Italian crumbs. Added liquid smoke to eggs along with Greek seasoning & SYM. Agreed, everything tastes better cooked in bacon grease so I fried with that then added a touch of olive oil before placing my cast iron skillet to finish the cooking. Super yummy with homemade mac & cheese or cheesy broccoli rice....yummy!

I used fresh garlic which  sauteed in the olive oil before adding the chops. I also skipped the oil in the baking dish, used pam instead. I love how the breading stayed on these, will make again. Thanks for the share ;)

I've never been a huge fan of pork chops but they're cheap and my husband likes them. I figured I would try this recipe based on the reviews. I didn't have milk or eggs on hand, therefore I skipped the egg wash on the pork chops and instead just rubbed them down with the spice mixture. Due to time (and ALWAYS drying out pork chops) I just stocked to pan frying them until done. Topped them with the parmesan while still hot so it could melt....served and they are AMAZING!! Hands down the BEST pork chops I've ever eaten. 

Being as they were so good I'll continue to make them without the eggs/milk just to save a little money!

WOW!! Thank you for my family's new go to chops recipe!! I had bone in chops, 8 total so I got a bit liberal with the bread crumbs and seasoning. I browned them in 2 cast iron skillets, then just transferred all to the oven. These chops really are amazing. Thank you! 
Here again...making these for the 2nd time in 2 weeks :))

Made these pork chops, but only had somewhat thin ones. Made them as the recipe,but they hardly needed any time in the oven after the frying pan. You are right! Parmesan Che's

I thought this was a great base recipe, though as some said, I made some changes but mostly just more of this, a little less of that.  Will be making it weekly!  Thanks.

This was really good.  I guess I am the only one that assumed thatb1/4 cup of onion, garlic and seasoning salt was a typo so I adjusted it to 1.5tsp of each and they came out great.

I made this as per the recipe and it turned out very well.  The only thing I'd do different next time perhaps pound down the chop so that it's more of a schnitzel.

Turned out yummy.  There was way too much of the bread crumb mix, next time I'll use 1/2 of the suggested amounts.  I used 6 large pork chops as the recipe called for.  Threw more than 1/2 of the bread crumb mix away after all was prepared.  I sprinkled fresh Parmesan on during the last 10 minutes to avoid it burning.  Very good.

This was wonderful!I tend to be heavy handed when seasoning pork chops, so it came out a bit salty. I was kinda on the fence with the topping. However I went ahead and had to used shredded parmesan instead of powdered since that was the only thing I had on hand and didn't have time to pack up 2 screaming babies and run to the store

An easy recipe, I liked the light frying and then baking. My pork chops were very moist and the breading and parmesan made this a filling dinner.  I made as is, cutting the ingredients by half to feed my family of three. It was easy to follow and delicious.

A 1/4 cup of seasoned salt called for in the recipe was way too much for my taste.  I will make it again but  without adding the seasoned salt to bread crumb mixture.

Very good.  Used pinko with great success.  Rather than put the salt in the crumbs, I completely omitted, I sprinkled some salt on the top after frying and before putting Parmesan on, they were nicely seasoned.

Husband didn't like the Parmesan on it , but we both enjoyed them esp. the tenderness and juiciness of the chops. We certainly will be making these again. Also cut ingredients in half for the  chops we had. The other half of the dry ingredients (before chops put in) I put in a ziplock bag for a later use. I also made the mistake of adding ALL ingredients  together instead of separate. It would've helped if step #2 stated wet ingredients and dry ingredients (didn't notice the period. )!!!  So had to dump and start over with separate bowls!

Delicious! Agree this is a very simple dish that many of us may have made in the past, but the extra seasonings and the Parmesan cheese on top lend a different flair, which is much more preferred! Will try the same on chicken tenders or breasts. Perfect for my finicky 4 & 6 year olds!

This was really good. I'm afraid I overcooked them a little but they were very flavorful and still fairly juicy.

I don't like wasting ingredients so I halved the dry ingredients and used one less egg in the wet ingredients. I still had plenty of dry and wet ingredients left over. I'm afraid I forgot about the parmesan when I put them in the oven. I bet that would have been even better. I just stuck my oven proof skillet in the oven to reduce the dirty dishes. We enjoyed them and will make them again.
