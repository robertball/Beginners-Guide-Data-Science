This recipe was great! I was a little scared because I wasn't too sure about the canned gravy but it turned out great! Mine cooked for about 11 hours on low and it was the most tender roast I had ever had before! Great taste

Delicious!  The whole family loved it.  My picky 5 year old even like the carrots for a change.  I used chuck roast- more fat and more flavor.  We don't like onions but want a little of the flavor so I just put in about 2 Tbsp. onion flakes.  Could not find Campbell's gravy so we just used grocery store brand canned gravy and it was terrific.

I usually do the roast in the crock pot with the cream of mushroom soup but the gravy added a great flavor to the roast and veggies. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough liquid because the gravy comes out of the can pretty thick but it thinned out as it cooked and turned out great! I hate to see food go to waste so I also threw in the last of the celery I had on hand, about a half of a can of peas and a few crushed cloves of garlic. Just with I had some mushrooms I could have added too... Mmm Mmm good!

This is a very good, basic pot roast. I like using round as stated in this recipe instead of chuck as chuck is super fatty. Great but greasy. Plus, round is $13/4# at Costco. Cheap!
*****I would like to add that if you change the recipe - by NOT browning the meat (critical!) or adding other mixes like soup or broth - do NOT rate the recipe poorly. YOU HAVE WRITTEN A NEW RECIPE. You made something you didn't like - don't blame the original poster! I can't tell you how many times there will be a recipe with a bunch of 5 stars and then one with 2. Almost always, they will sub chicken for pork, garlic for basil, potatoes for onions and cook it in a crock pot the wonder why they didn't like it. This might be someone's family recipe and is glorious. It doesn't deserve a poor review because you cooked something else. Whew. End of rant. :)

This recipe made my pot roast so tender it just fell apart when poked with a fork! The taste was wonderful. I added celery and sprinkled some mushrooms on top of the pot roast as well since I had these on hand. I will definitely be making pot roast this way from now on. It was a huge hit with my family!

This was very easy and really good for something made with store-bought gravy.  I made it for company and everyone had seconds.  It was also good as left-overs the next day.

Made this on Sunday for my family and they loved it! The meat was very tender and i was pleasantly surprised that the vegetables held their own and didnt turn to mush! I couldnt find campbells beef gravy so i just used knorr stock jelly mixed into 1pt of water then when it was cooked i used some orignal bisto powder (any thickener would do tho) and made gravy from the stock.  Definately recommend and I will definately make this again!!

Got wonderful response to the rather easy meal! Wants to know when we can have it again!! Success!(think it was the fat free beef gravy that really did it! Will look for more Campbell's recipes here. ......INSTEAD of garlic power, I used real garlic and substitued the basil leaves with dried italian mixed seasoning.

Patted 3# pot roast with salt, pepper, garlic salt and dusted with flour, browned in pan with a little olive oil and a little butter. Put carrots, celery, onion, red potatoes and garlic in slow cooker, added browned roast, topped with Campbells gravy (2 cans), splashed in some red wine and added more salt, pepper, and basil. Cooked on low for 8 hours. House smelled awesome while cooking. Everyone enjoyed eating it, leftovers were great too.

This is the second time I have made this pot roast. Ist time made as is and it was cooked in 5 hrs on low. Not enough gravy and seasonings were lacking.So  recipe made as is is only 2 star.  This time I added 1 can cream of mushroom soup ,1/2 cup red wine, dash of worcheshire sauce, rosemary, oregano and salt and pepper. Family licked their fingers when they ate it up. Expected some leftovers but sadley there were none. This makes this recipe deliscious

I think 10 hours is too long. I made a 2.5 lb roast and it was well done in 8 hours. I suggest checking on the roast after 5 hours. After this recipe I will probably stick with onion soup mix.

It was tasty.  Simple and easy for a weeknight meal.  Added some peas to the mix.  Gravy got more broth like as I cooked it- but it still tasted great.  I didn't brown the meat first.  Kiddos liked the potatoes the best. I really liked the addition of the basil.

I've made this twice and both times it came out fantastic.  I followed the recipe, except put in a few less carrots.  I loaded up the crockpot in the morning before going to work, set it on slow-cook, and when I came home at the end of the day it was done.  The meat was super-tender and the carrots and potatoes were cooked perfectly.  One time my meat wasn't fully defrosted, but I put it in anyway, and it still came out great.  I've made pot roast in the crock before, but it's amazing how much better it is by adding 2 cans of beef gravy.  We'll never make pot roast any other way.

I make this as stated but with the addition of a cup of red wine and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I then thicken the gravy at the end with some cornstarch.  My kids'll eat anything, but they proclaim this one 'awesome'.

Like other reviewers, I didn't brown the roast and used Heinz beef gravy.  Didn't peel the potatoes.  The pot roast didn't look particularly appealing -- but the meat was tender and the taste was good.

This is very simple to make. I find that while you CAN make it w/o searing the meat, it's best to make it and sear it first.  See http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/searing-meats-tips-and-tricks/detail.aspx for more information on searing meat.  I only varied the seasonings and added some montreal steak seasoning to the beef.  It was delicious!

So good, was skeptical about the gravy being too thick. Filled up half a gravy can with water and added it at the start of cooking and ended up having to add a little cornstarch to thicken it back up, so I would definatly leave this recipie as is no need to mess with it.

I had a couple of cans of Campbells gravy to use up so I decided to give this a try.  Super easy & turned out pretty good.  My crock pot roasts are always done in less time than this recipe specified so check often and use a meat thermometer.

Good comfort food. I used a 2 lb roast and there's no way it could reasonably have fed 8 people. Also, I think this recipe is for one of the newer crockpots. I have the traditional 3.5 qt size and not everything fit in. The meat was very tender. I think 10 hours might be a bit too long for a 2 lb roast.

I didn't brown the meat before putting it in the crockpot. I seasoned it with garlic powder, seasoning salt, and onion soup mix.  I left out the Beef Gravy and made my own once everything was cooked.  I followed everything else.  The meat was tender and so good!  The vegetables were not mushy but soft.  PERFECT and smelled great!

a few changes: quartered meat trimmed fat fried in  olive oil, added a few strips of celery sliced fairly thin, and 2 cups of mushrooms quartered.   5 stars because of taste and simplicity cooked for 5 hours in a dutch oven - super tender!

We loved this. I don't have a slow cooker, so I did it on the stove. I made 1 mistake, I added the potoatoes and carrots at the beginning so they were mushy after 5 hours of cooking.  It also needs a little bit of pepper.  Otherwise - delicious!!!!

I just made this today and it was wonderful and had a nice flavor.  Only changes I made were I only had one can of gravy so I added that along with 1/2c water.  I also did not use the oil and brown the meat.  I find this is an extra step that for us only adds calories and dishes.  Great recipe to play around with....

This was very good and very easy.  Like others I was leery about the canned gravy but it was good.  The carrots retained their color and they were not mushy.  I didn’t care for the flavor or the texture of the potatoes.

I used 2 cans beef and 1 can mushroom gravy (we like gravy) and also sauteed the onions prior to adding.  Great meal!  My cooking time for a 4 lb chuck roast was only 5 hours.

This is a very good and easy dish to fix. With the left overs I make soup which my family like just as well. I cube up the veggies in to smaller pieces and shredded the meat. In a 3 quart sauce pan I put a can of diced tomatoes and 1 bag of frozen mixed vegetables 2 cup water. Warm this up the add left over in to it. Let it simmer for about 15 minutes to blend flavors. My family ate both meal like there was no tomorrow.

The meat came out really dry and didnt soak up any of the juice... It was the first time a recipe asked me to brown the meat first... i'll not do that next time.

Great easy dinner; started dinner 1st thing in the morning. Substituted my own homemade gravy. Halved the recipe so that it would fit in my smaller crock pot and we were still eating it several days later.

Made the recipe exactly as stated, except added a bit more spice.  Tasted good in the end, however, nothing particularly spectacular. Fine, not great.

I made this last night and it was delicious. The only change I made was using 1 can of gravy and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, other than that I followed everything to a T.   I was a little concerned about the vegetables being mushy since they would be in there for 10 hours along with the meat but they were perfect.   This recipe is definitely a keeper!

After 40+ years of cooking this is my first slow cooker meal.  First I am not a roast fan, steaks are what I crave.  I must say though this is a very good meal.  I seasoned a little more and my gravy was a little thin for me but all in all I enjoyed this alright.  I will tweak it a little next time but not much.

Not bad.  I didn't have the beef gravy so I ended up using a can of cream of mushroom soup, a cup of water and beef bouillon.  Not sure if that was the cause of the more blandness of the meat or not.  It wasn't bad though and VERY eatable!  I didn't have time to put it in the crock pot so I cooked it in a pan like the recipe calls for and then baked it with the gravy and veggies in the oven at 350 degrees for about 2 hours and by that time the veggies were done.  The meat was tender enough, although did not fall apart.  It was, over-all a good, hearty meal.  :)

The best pot roast recipe I've made.  It is the only one I make now.  My cook time is usually 6 hours on high for a 2 lb. roast.  I adjust the amount of vegetables to what we need.  Usually more potatoes and less carrots.  I add celery if I have it on hand.  I also use 2 Tablespoons of basil instead of 2 teaspoons.  It was on accident that I first did that and my family liked it better that way.  This recipe is super easy and it always comes out tender.

This recipe is absoulutely the best pot roast I have tried.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I used sirloin tip instead of chuck roast and I also didn't read it well enough before I put everything in the Crock Pot and did not brown my roast.  I can not imagine it being any better by browning it.  Also could not find Campbell's gravy so used Heinz in a jar.  Thanks so much for this great recipe

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was fantastic.  The gravy thins out while being cooked, so no need to add more liquids like many of the reviews state.  Lastly, I made mine in an 8qt slow cooker, and that was fine too.  I did immerse the meat in the gravy once it thinned out a bit.  Delicious!

This came out really good, which surprised me since after 6 hours it had really not come together yet. After 10 it was perfect. Not a big gravy fan and from the beginning it seemed like way too much gravy for me but it cooked down some in the end. I used root vegetables, parsnips and rutabaga and they came out perfect. I would use a little more salt next time. Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good. I did add more water to make sure that the meat didn't dry out. Next time I will cut the roast into smaller peices before I start cooking to make sure it isn't too dry.

I agree that the time is way too long. I made a 2-pound roast and it was well-done in 5 hours on low. I doubled the veggies. I didn't bother with the gravy; just added some chicken broth before cooking and made my own. The 4-star rating is because I agree with a couple other reviewers that it could use a little more seasoning. I'll probably search around at other recipes for ideas of what else to put in.

This was super easy and the vegetables turned out delicious! The meat was tender, but I thought it lacked something. Maybe more seasoning or garlic salt instead of powder? Idk, but I will try this again.

Good, but still missing flavor in the middle of the meat.

This was very good. I used a 4 pound roast. It was super tender. Husband liked how the gravy turned out.

My family loved this dish.  The perfect easy weeknight comfort food and the smell in the house was awesome.

Pretty good and pretty easy. Cooked on low for 10 hrs, meat was very tender and delicious.

It cooked very nicely, but lacked the flavor I was hoping for.

I used beef broth instead of gravy and it stilled turned out wonderful.
