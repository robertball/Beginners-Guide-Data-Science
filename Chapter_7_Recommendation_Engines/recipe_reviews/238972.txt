This is a great recipe to try if you are on Weight Watchers program. You can add many different veggies (power foods) to this and it's only 6 points. I'm going to take this to share with my group this week.

I am sure I added much more than the recipe called for but it was fabulous. I added cayenne pepper, black olives, dried up French bread cubes, spinach, corn...

Good recipe! Great healthy ingredients and really filling. I added extra vegetables like mushroom and zucchini too. Needed a bit more flavour though, was mild tasting. Hot sauce, BBQ sauce or ranch sauce are a great side!

These were very yummy! I replaced chicken broth with  vegetable broth.  Also , I am new to cooking,  and didn't know to cover the quinoa mix while it was tendering. I added water and covered when there was no liquid and hard quinoa.  Still turned out great! Will make again!

That was sooo good! By far one of my favorite recipes! I made it with a handful of fresh cherry tomatoes instead of the canned and it was perfect

I had too much filling for the amount of peppers to fill.  But it was good and great to heat up later.

This was good but the Quinoa took longer to cook.  I really think  it needs to be precooked before being added to the tomatoes.

So we made this tonight for dinner.  I had a ton of fresh green peppers and zucchini to use up quickly and found this recipe.  I already had all the ingredients on hand so it made it pretty simple.  I made no changes, except to use green peppers and hollowed out "zucchini boats" instead of red peppers.  I also doubled the recipe because I wanted left overs for work the next day.  This was absolutely delicious!  I had to cook the quinoa mixture a little longer than called for to get all the liquid to asorb (I did rinse the quinoa thoroughly in cold water to avoid the bitterness) but honestly this was really good.  This is a very healthy and flavorful meal and even my picky kids ate plenty.   This is a keeper - perfect for garden season!

Great satisfying, filling meatless meal.  I didn't have spinach or Mexican blend cheese, so I substituted chopped mushrooms and mozzarella cheese.  Good blend of flavors, so my meat- loving husband was satisfied.  Made for great leftovers the next day.

I made this last night, and followed the recipe pretty closely. The only thing I did differently was to increase the shredded carrots and put a tad more quinoa in it. Delicious! I will definitely make again and probably add a little heat next time around, since I like spice!

I have made this recipe several times and it is delicious! I have used different colours of peppers which looks great. There is more filling than what can fit in 3 peppers - depending on size of the pepper it could fill 4-5 peppers. I have also enjoyed the extra filling just on its own. One thing to note is that after the quinoa is added it does need to be covered in order for the quinoa to cook!

I used Trappey's black beans which have seasoning and thick sauce and was not really able to drain the beans, and would not want to since that greatly improves the flavor.  I used chicken bouillion and water, which also added more flavor. I will make it again

The only thing to add is sweet Italian sausage during step 3 and cilantro to the mixture before stuffing the peppers. Very nice!

Delicious! Added an extra two splashes of chicken broth cause it seemed to get a little dry, but in retrospect could've only added one and it'd have been fine.

The spinach may look a little big at first but it wilts if you leave the quinoa mixture on low heat. Other than that, we followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out quite delicious.

I used a mixture of RO?TEL original and hot diced tomatoes and Bush's black bean fiesta. I precooked some Vigo yellow rice to do a half quinoa and half rice mixture. I also diced some mushrooms and added them to the recipe. The flavor came out amazing! I used half the amount of spinach and all other specs of this recipe I kept the same.  My peppers that I pre cooked for 22 mins came out done. Which I prefer a nice crunch. So I would do half the time on them. The quinoa took alot longer then expected. I would definitely precook the quinoa as well in the future. Overall I was happy with the flavor and would definitely consider making again!

Pretty tasty, didn't have black beans, so I used chili beans which worked well with the cumin that went into the recipe.  I liked the roasting of the peppers before stuffing rather than baking them filled.  Added a nice flavor to the dish.

I used chopped Kale instead of spinach, added a hot pepper salsa (hot) in addition to the diced tomatoes and  topped it with a smoky, Cajun cheese.  So yummy!

Great stuffed bell pepper recipe, lots of healthy ingredients and good flavor. 

Note: I used kale instead of spinach because that was what was in my fridge. The black beans I used already had seasoning (leftover from another recipe). 
It's important to bake the bell peppers for 30 minutes first. I only baked them for 15 minutes (because they were small peppers) and they were still crunchy. Next time I'll bake them longer.

These were so flavorful and easy to make.  I will totally make them again!  The only change I made was to go a bit lighter on the spinach and cheese, and heavier on the carrots.  Absolutely delicious.

It was a big hit at my house, even for the ones that don't love quinoa.

It was wonderful and flavoursome.  If you like, you could always add ground turkey/beef.  I used different colored peppers, which made it look very appealing as well.

I love this recipe! I stuffed red, green and yellow peppers. I use Vegetable broth vs chicken, and substituted Mexican cheese with Parmesan. So many ways you can play with this recipe. Fabulous!

these came out so good.. i made a few slight modifications and ended up using the final product with some chopped up chicken breast to fill enchiladas so we could have more of a hearty meal.. we enjoyed them both as is and in the enchiladas.. here's what i substituted/did differently: used half an onion, italian seasoned tomatoes, half water/half homemade stock, chopped baby carrots, a blend of baby spinach/baby kale/baby chard, and cheddar cheese.. i'd double the bell peppers next time because you do end up with leftover filling.. and cut the baking time in half with them as they would have been too mushy for the full 30 min's.. i'd also add in all the liquid from the canned tomatoes when adding the tomatoes bc my mixture was on the dry side and i ended up using all the liquid anyway.. this can easily be converted to a vegan dish so i'm looking forward to sharing this with bf's daughter.. ty for the recipe

Very good and easy for a week night. I had lots of stuffing left overs so we ate on the side with the stuffed peppers. I know next time I can use more then 4 peppers especially if they aren't big peppers.

I like to use a recipe as is except to change to a healthier version.  This was perfect.  No changes, and it was healthy, tasted great and will make it often but with larger peppers!

Try stuffing poblano peppers, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Cut an egg plant in half lengthwise, oil the cut side and roast along with the peppers. When done, skin it, slice lengthwise into strips, and place them between the stuffed peppers. Cover with the left over stuffing mix and finish as written. Yum!

Instead of canned tomatoes I used a can of rotelle and one Roma tomato. The chilis in the rotelle gave it some good zip, but not too much! I used less spinach. There was more then I could put onto 7 pepper halves.

Simple and delicious recipe. It calls for 3 red peppers split but I typically use a variety of "colors" and always find that I have enough filling to fill at least 5 medium sized peppers. I was out of carrots this time so I used corn instead. A must try!!

Made this for dinner tonight, was very good.  The only thing I changed was I used feta cheese on top.  I will be making this again for sure.
