This punch is always a hit with everyone...never any left over. However, MY version is slightly different: 1 pkg cherry & 1 pkg strawberry kool-aid, 2 cups of sugar, 3 qts water and 1 qt ginger ale (in place of the lemon-lime beverage). Still use the frozen oj/lemonade.  Disolve sugar and koolaid in water and add remaining ingrediants. Fruity and refreshing and my family & friends love this stuff...worked great for the holidays as it made alot! Would highly recommend!

I made this punch for a bridal shower yesterday. I was worried we would have too much, as the recipe makes quite a bit, but the punch was completely gone by the end of the party!! All the guests commented on how good it was and several asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

We served this during the summer at a party--to say it was a hit was an understatement. It was delicious, and made a lot more sense than downing cola in droves. I'd definitely make it again.

I've made this punch several times and it's always a hit.  The only thing I changed was that I used pink lemonade in place of regular lemonade.

Made this for my son's Kindergarten class and they all loved it.  Even the parents kept going back for seconds.  The only thing I changed was I used a whole 12 oz. can of Orange Juice concentrate and left out the lemonade since I couldn't find the 6 oz. cans.  It was still wonderfully tasty.

I made this for our Library Storyhour party at the end of summer and received great reviews - they said it was the best punch ever - I added a quart of sherbet to the punch bowl as an added ingredient.

This really is the best Punch!!  I have made it numerous times and everyone loved it.  I have also added Orange, lemon and lime round slices to float around in the bowl..looks really pretty. Another option to make this yummy punch adult friendly is to add white wine or Champagne to it, yum yum!!!

OK. Tasted too concentrated. Added 2nd liter of Sprite + 1 liter Perrier lemon- seemed to do the trick.

I made this recipe for my husband's promotion reception and it was very well received.  I had two punch bowls set out.  One bowl had the punch with sherbet added and the other did not have sherbet.  I liked both versions but I had several people approach me for the sherbet recipe.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

I had to make lot of changes to this recipe.  I couldn't find the already sweetened Kool-Aid in the smaller package, and I didn't want to buy a large on.  I used two unsweetened packages (as another reviewer uses), with about a 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I used a calorie/sugar-free version of the lemon-lime soda, and use the entire bottle.  I used the lemonade/orange juice as the recipe suggested.  I also added water to dilute it.  Everyone at the party seemed to like it, but I'm hesitant to give anymore than three stars because it wasn't what I was expecting.

Served this punch at my daughter's 4th birthday party, and I just couldn't get enough of it!!!!  It was so yummy.  This will now be my go-to party punch!  Wonderful!!!!  (Note that one batch of this overflowed my punch bowl, it makes a lot.)

Great Punch for parties!! The kids can have it on ice and the adults can mix it with a tasty adult kicker if they like! I have made it several times this summer for picnics and once by request for a baby shower! Very Refreshing!

I made this for my son's 2nd Birthday party.  It was a small family gathering and there was very little left.  I suppose you could experiment with it if you wanted, but this was  loved by everyone as is!  Thanks for such a kid and adult friendly punch!

This punch was a hit! The only recommendation would be to add a little more sugar than the directions provided on the kool-aid drink package.

This is great! Made it with Canada Dry ginger ale instead of lemon-lime.  Added the vanilla ice cream because the store was out of orange sherbet.  Had lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

Yummy punch! I made the kool-ade as directed on packet, but left out the sugar bc this punch has enough sugar as-is once you add the other ingredients! (I had sugar on-hand if needed, but I would recommend trying w/o first)
