Absolutely perfect.  Only took about ten minutes.  I made one batch with regular cream cheese one with light.  I warmed my cream cheese in the microwave and added vanilla and salt to cream cheese along with actually UNSIFTED powdered sugar.  I used the 3% cornstarch kind that may have helped.  While I was prepared to add butter or milk I used my choclate right off the burner and did not need any added ingredients. By using everything warm and adding the chocolate very last I was putting it in the pan right as it began to firm up. I used the back of a spoon and hot water to smooth the top. I also used seran wrap instead of foil so I could just fold it over and store it as is. It is creamy and easy to work with.  THANK YOU!!!

This is wonderful fudge!  While I was making it, I added a bit of butter with melting the chocolate and also 1/4 cup milk to the mix.  I did this to avoid the stiff mixture problem.  Mine never had the problem.  It turned out nice and creamy.  Will be making this many times again!  Thanks!

Great! I only used 3 cups of sugar and thought that was sweet enough. Also, I added a bit of milk to the final mixture.

This was homemade, and it was yummy, but I'm not so sure it would qualify as traditional fudge... I cooled it just about the whole day and still came up with a mousse consistancy. I put it in wine glasses and served it with a spoon.

YUM!!! I have always wanted an easy fudge recipe that still tastes like real fudge (unlike the ones using Marshmellows etc.) To me this was just right and it made a good amount. I added milk like others suggested and I must have added to much because that batch did not quite set up. But use less milk and it did!!!

This is by far the easiest fudge I have made. For the chocolate purist I added 4 ounces of the semi-sweet baking chocolate, decreased the powder sugar to 3 cups, I took the advise of  other reviews. Softened the cr.cheese with vanilla, kept everything warm blended very nice. If you like a thicker fudge, please double receipe.  Thank you

Way too sweet for my taste.  The consistency is lovely, as is the firmness and whatnot- it's super smooth- but I expected a chocolate fudge to taste like chocolate.  The brown color is deceiving... I'd recommend avoiding this recipe if you're a chocolate lover.

This is an easy and tasty recipe.  We liked it.  The mixture is way too stiff, though.  I thought I was going to burn the motor of my KitchenAid.  I did add 2 tablespoons of milk.  I could have easily used more.  My husband liked the flavor, but felt it was too dry and I agree.  Next time I may add some melted butter and more milk.

This recipe was great.  I made it for a co-worker's going away party and everyone loved it.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it is very sweet... at least for me.  As far as preparing the recipe though, I had no trouble as a beginner.  Also, one thing to keep in mind is that I could still taste the cream cheese in the fudge after it was made.  The cream cheese was not a strong flavor but it was still there.

I just made this along with the Easiest Peanut Butter Fudge to give out for the holidays. It came out great! It does get very tough to mix as you stir in the sugar, but once you press it down in the pan and let it sit for a bit in the fridge, it's great! (I just snitched a piece!) For the person for whom it didn't 'firm up' I don't know how that could be cuz the 'batter' was so tough to mix at the end! But it's worth the effort. YUM!

I just made this for the first time. While the taste is delicious - very creamy and fudgy, the mixture was kind of tough to work with. I left out the walnuts because it was getting to where I was afraid the beaters on my mixer were going to break off or the motor was going to burn out. Maybe the cream cheese wasn't softened enough. I will try one more time, but tastes very good. Thanks for the recipe.

Having read the reviews that said this was not very chocolate-y, and since I was making it for a chocoholic, I decided to add a 5th square of unsweetened chocolate.  Not a bad result, but very dark tasting.  Next time I used the recommended amount and it came out just about perfect.  Both times I also followed the advice of reviewers who said the mixture was very thick, so I softened the cream cheese in the microwave, added 2 T of butter to the chocolate and about 1/4 cup of fat-free half and half.  Had to increase confectioner's sugar by about 1/2 cup to thicken it, which was not a problem.  To those who complained that this recipe is too sweet - maybe fudge is not the dessert for you!

SUPER!SUPER!SUPER!  This recipe was so simple.  I was just looking for a recipe to use up some extra cream cheese!  I made this and took it to work where everyone gobbled it up!  It has such a smooth consistancy and just melts in your mouth!  Thanks for this great addition to my recipes;)

I used to make this fudge all the time.  In 1989 our house was destroyed by fire and I lost all my favorite recipes.  I have been searching for this one since then, with no results until today! THANK YOU SO  MUCH FOR SHARING IT!

This is an okay fudge but I would not make it again.  It is too soft, even after refrigeration, and is messy to eat.

I have made several different fudge recipes from this website, and this was the least 'fudge-like.' You are basically making thick chocolate cake frosting. At no point is it ever in a liquid form that can be poured. If you want a great fudge that you don't need a candy thermometer to make, try the Foolproof Chocolate Fudge.

There wasn't anything special about this fudge recipe.  It doesn't have the quality that you find in a fudge shop.  I agree with another - it's not traditional fudge.  It doesn't have the glossiness and does not set the same.  It doesn't taste bad, and will more than suffice for a chocolate craving.  It's easy for kids to make.

Fairly good fudge recipe, but it is not as firm as some of my other favorites.  The chocolate flavor is not as blinding as some dark chcoolate fudge for those who are more milk chocolate fudge lovers.

After putting all ingredients together, it looked so dry. I added 1/4 cup milk and 2 Tablespoons butter and  kept beating.  I also added 1 more chocolate square. Finally, it came together!  I wish recipes would explain how long to beat together. Oh well, it was not a failure, but not especially attractive. I would not make again.

Hardens quick, so move fast, but good! Also, I added about 1/8 cup milk, although next time I will use evaporated milk.

I've been making this fudge recipe for over 15 years. It's easy to change up by swapping out the walnuts for raisins, pecans, crushed candy canes, etc.  Be creative! Microwaving the cream cheese for a minute, especially on cool days, makes stirring easier. If your mixer still struggles at the task, its time to put a better model on your wish list.

Cream cheese fudge, I've decided, is not my fav. Although it's very easy I prefer the traditional smooth texture. The powdered sugar texture is too evident. And extremely sweet. My husband on the other hand ensures me non will go to waste on his watch!
