My first time making pretzels so I followed the recipe exactly, except at the end I only buttered half of them.  I think I prefer them without butter but they are delicious either way.  What a great way to do something productive with my sourdough starter discards!  Great recipe, thanks!

I substituted malt powder instead of the sugar and topped it with pretzel salt that I purchased on Amazon.

They didnâ€™t come out pretty, but are delicious. I used my own starter and evaporated milk.
