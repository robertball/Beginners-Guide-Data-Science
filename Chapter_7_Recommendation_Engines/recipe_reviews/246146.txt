6.5.16   Caramelized onions are so sweet on their own, I’m not convinced you need this much sugar (but then, I’m not into really sweet food these days).  I’ll start with half the amount next time and add more if necessary. I used light mayo and Greek yogurt.   One thing I love about this dip is that it’s mellow/mild, and it doesn’t smack you in the face with an overpowering onion flavor like that famous soup does.  Chef Sprocket, thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s worth the effort to make.

I also added garlic to the sautéed onions.  Maybe half the sugar is needed, depending on your tastes.  I added fresh parsley and chives to give it some color.

If you are a Miracle Whip family, don't add any sugar.  My mistake was using Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise (which I always do), but forgot that MW has plenty of sugar.  I already reduced the sugar from what the recipe says,  but that wasn't enough with MW.  How I fixed it:  added extra plain yogurt.  Didn't feel like waiting for more onions to cook, so I cooked some garlic in the microwave, added it...not enough flavor...added some garlic powder and onion powder.  Next time I will use no sugar with MW and more onions!  Otherwise, a great recipe!

Update:  Made it again without any sugar.  Added 2 tsp on onion powder to give it a little more flavor.  That's what it needed!

Thank you, Chef Sprocket for this recipe!  I have made this recipe about 5 times now, and have slightly improved it, I believe (not that the original is in any way bad, I just did some fine-tuning!).  As proof, I offer you this:

I brought it for a staff pot luck.  I made a double batch.  It is all gone, and 3 people asked for the recipe.

My changes:
The 2 tbsp. of sugar is just a little much.  I used 1.5 tbsp.
As for salt and pepper, I used 1/2 tsp. each.
Yellow onion is the way to go.  Don't you dare use red!  I have not tested white.

Not sure if it matters, but I used a dutch oven because I needed something big since I was making a double batch.

I was apprehensive bringing the dish because I know that my family adores it, but you never know with things like onion dip at a pot luck.  However, I was blown away by the response.  Make this dish!

This is the only onion dip I will be making from now on. It is so good. Might cut back a smidge in the sugar. Will be making this again very soon.

Made this for Christmas Day buffet. Yummy. This is a crowd pleaser.  I saw the suggestion to reserve a few onions as a garnish and voila.

YUMMY!!!!!
This was better than store bought! Unfortunately, the first time I made it, I overcooked the onions - you MUST cook them LOW and SLOW. I made it a second time and did a much better job with the caramelizing.
Make sure you let the flavors meld as long as possible - overnight. I added garlic, just because I love it. It goes well with veggies or chips!

I've made this dip 4 or 5 times now and I love it!
It can get a little too sweet, depending on how long you caramelize the onions, but it's an easy fix. Just add a little hot sauce, chili powder or jalapenos.

I'm gonna try adding bacon next time
