I actually got to watch my man Vincent make this dish in person. How can you go wrong with bacon eggs parmesan cheese and great bread. Then you go and add spinach too? Love it.

Delicious! I did cut the recipe down just for my hubby and me so I opted to use some beautiful crusty Italian rolls instead of the whole loaf of bread and that worked out great! Really nice combo of flavors and textures and something that I will def be making again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

This is the perfect brunch for a crowd. The spinach bacon egg and cheese combo were so delicious. I love how you cut the bread and everyone gets an egg-in-the-hole sandwich! I will be trying all types of combinations every time I make it!

Vincent your dish is phenomenal! It's incredibly easy to make it's fun to eat and the best thing (as a mom) is the addtion of greens in a breakfast dish. This would be a perfect dish for Christmas morning when the house is full of excited kids! It would turn their attention from gifts to food. You did such a great job in the Dinner Spinner show and the decision between your dish and Cliff's was VERY hard! Your dish is definitely 5star and my guests this morning at our watch party LOVED it. I live at altitude so it took longer to cook in my oven -- almost twice as long. Next time I'll also try this with fresh spinach versus cooked. Definitely making this again and can't wait for my nieces and nephews to come over for it!
