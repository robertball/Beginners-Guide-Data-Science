Having never cooked with bison, I was eager to give it a whirl. I'm an experienced cook so after checking out the leanness of athe bison sirloin steak, I knew to slice it thin and flash fry it and quickly get it off the heat. To no avail, the bison was tough and chewy. The rest of the recipe was tasty and fine. I feel that maybe a different cut may be the answer or possibly marinating the meat in a liquid acid marinade might help. I do thank the Bison Council for the opportunity to explore and promote the healthiness of eating the "other red meat".

Tried this recipe with a couple minor changes....didn't have bison so used beef tenderloin...otherwise everything was as listed until I tasted it before serving.  I added another tablespoon of red curry paste and that didn't help so added a tablespoon of oyster sauce because I didn't want it to taste fishy had I added more fish sauce since it is a beef recipe...while that added a bit of flavor, it still wasn't what I thought it should be.  It did look good but it wasn't a good flavor.  First, it was too sweet so I would eliminate the brown sugar.  Second, it had no salt, so would add that to taste.  In the end, I wouldn't make this again...sorry Bison Council.  I threw the leftovers away.

The curry itself was awesome but I made the mistake of buying expensive meat in Tesco instead of going to a local butcher. Meat was tough even though it wasn't over cooked. But can't fault this recipe for that. Its a keeper. Will try with chicken next time for a change.

Using the sirloin in this dish, you really have to be careful about not overcooking it. Since it has very little fat and the bison has even less fat than beef, it can get dry quickly. I did not use the frozen green beans as I had fresh on hand.  This was a pretty good recipe, but I needed to use more red curry paste to get the zip in our curry that we like.

Note to self, I also added a tablespoon of soy sauce and minced garlic. I didn't have al the veggies, but I made it anyway. Used white sugar instead, didn't have beef broth. I liked the flavor, I never got it thick enough though.
