Instead of cumin, I threw in different spices (chives, onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed, celery salt, fresh ground pepper, a little hot sauce) and I threw in about a cup and a half of diced ham. Instead of regular milk, I used one full can of evaporated milk (it easier to cook with, imo). Very hearty and comforting soup. The whole family enjoyed it.

I found this to have a lot of broth; I like my chowders nice and thick.  Next time I think I'd use less chicken stock.  Maybe use cream instead of milk.  And pureeing just one cup of the chowder didn't add very much body.  Great flavor though.  I wasn't sure about the cumin but it was tasty! I added my potatoes and carrots about 2 hours before we ate dinner and kept it on low.

An easy way to thicken a soup like this is with instant mashed potato flakes. Just keep adding a few tablespoons and stirring until it is where you want it. Go slow, tho, because it takes a little bit for the flakes to work. Thickens without adding a lot of calories. This soup is very tasty, but I can't say I added the cumin. That idea didn't appeal after I tasted a spoon of the soup with a little cumin added. Used parsley and a bit of Mrs. Dash. Very nice.

Yummy yummy flavor, I used ham broth in place of chicken broth. You need more the 45 minutes to get tender vegetables. My dinner was 45 minutes late because of the miss timing. I will make this again and again.

The cumin does not go with the ham.  I can only image that those giving this a good review were very hungry when they ate the results &/or used very old, pre-ground cumin.  I grind my cumin just prior to using it.

Very tasty!  I would hesitate to call it a "chowder" though. Not very creamy.  But it was a big hit just the way it is!

It's wonderful! Very easy, cheap, filling, and delicious! I loved it just how it was!

I sort of wish that the blender part was explained because I did not understand it. 
Also, don't expect to have a super creamy, thick broth because it's not at all. 
Delicious soup but not thick.  
I also used dried parsley instead and it worked just fine.
You'll love it! Happy cooking!

I added an 1 c extra chicken broth to cover the ham bone and 1 1/2 cup diced ham. Had the crock pot set for high for a few hours before I realized it was supposed to be low.  I used peeled, white potatoes and added 1/2 t of the following: onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt. I added 1/4 t dill. Cooked the veggies on high for 1.5 to 2 hrs. I used a stick blender on 1 c of the soup and mixed with milk, then added back in. *This is not my favorite potato soup and will go back to Creamy Slow Cooker Potato Soup.

I made a few changes and it turned out great!!  I only used 3/4 of the broth.  I used a cup of whole milk and a cup of heavy cream.  Veggies also took longer than 45 minutes.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't make any substitutions; cooked exactly as the recipe indicated. Even my picky eater ate the whole bowl and said it was good. HOWEVER, the vegetables take a very long time to cook. I had to cook them over 2 hours, and it is not creamy (if that's what you are looking for).

So good.  I did it just a little differently. I added 1 1/2 cups chopped ham and 3 celery stalks chopped with leaves.  I also put everything but the milk in the crockpot on high all at once for 5 hours.  It came out so yummy.  I love how I creamy it was and I did not have to use heavy cream, I used skim milk!

First off, cumin does not pair well with ham.  And, this is too thin to be called a chowder.  It's thin on depth of flavor and just O.K. if you are really hungry.  Much better recipes for this style of chowder on the web.

Made this exactly as written except made it on the stove top and added some cubed ham because the bone I had wasn’t very meaty. The soup was great, everyone loved it!! Super easy to make. I thought the consistency was great, but I didn’t use a slow cooker.

It takes a lot longer than 45 minutes for the potatoes and carrots to cook in a slow cooker, even on high. Next time I would put them in after 4 -6 hours and let them cook for the remaining 2 hours. It also wasn't as thick as I hoped it would be, but otherwise it tasted pretty good.

This was ok.  The whole chowder was bland tasting and defiantly not thick like a chowder.  We did eat the entire pot;  although we added plenty of S&P

This recipe sounded interesting since I had a ham bone that I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with. We did eat it for dinner but  I’m glad that I halved the garlic and onion and  omitted the cumin, because the onion and garlic overpowered it. I’ll  make it again because surprisingly, the ham and chicken broth went so nice together, but I will definitely omit the garlic (maybe add some garlic powder at the end if needed) and cut back to a very little onion.

Substituted lamb for ham, added chopped fresh mint leaves. It came out well but I substituted almond milk for regular or skim and it did not become a chowder  but a slightly thickened soup. I also used fresh peas not corn and it came out well. I will use a skim milk next time to get the chowder.

I've made this twice. The first by the recipe, the second I had leftover ham and added it to make it more meaty. Also added ham broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the corn. We love our homegrown corn but it made this too sweet for us. The result was perfect for our palates - less sweet and very savory and hardy.

Great base recipe for what I wanted! I doubled the broth for cooking the ham bone since my pot was large and the bone still had lots of meat. I also added 2 cans of corn instead of one, added 2 cans of great northern beans, extra garlic, and I changed up the spices a bit, including adding about a tablespoon of sugar. Added a little cornstarch to thicken but probably didn't need to as the potatoes did a great job with that. Thanks for the recipe!

I'll definitely make this again, but next time I'll include the carrots... mine had gone bad. I also left out the cumin (hubby hates it anyway), had to cook the potatoes for 2 hours on high, and used someone else's suggestion about condensed milk. But it came out deliciously the way I did make it!

So tasty. A few modifications and this recipe is now one we will enjoy again. Cooked the corn for a few minutes in boiling water then browned  bacon drippings and left on paper towels for a few minutes before adding to chowder. Adopted this idea from an Allrecipes corn chowder recipe. Also added a bit of thyme and oregano. The broth definitely needed thickening which I accomplished with two spoons of what I learned is called buerre manie -- equal parts flour and softened butter, mixed together until crumbly. We topped with chopped bacon and some enjoyed a little hot sauce  and a hearty roll.

This is a delicious and very filling soup. I chose to use a pound of cubed ham instead of a ham bone, and added chopped celery, Swiss chard, zucchini, a can of white beans for added fiber and nutrition. This soup will be a regular at house for sure!!

Made this last night and we were really pleased!  Not to pick at an already sore point, but I also did not add cumin.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much meat came off our Honeybaked ham bone!  I sautéed and added some more chopped onions and celery  at the end.  Also allowed more than an hour for the carrots and potatoes to cook.  My gut told me our family would like more corn in it, and I was right--will use 2 cups next time.  The slow cooker made this a flavorful soup, and it didn't over reduce the broth.  Really happy for a change from ham and white beans or ham and potatoes au gratin!

This recipe was good and the kids liked it, but I'm glad I read the reviews first.  I thought cumin sounded weird and omitted it.  I didn't add hot sauce, but it was still good.  The ham bone should have meat on it!

Great soup! Followed the recipe and incorporated other suggestions. Instead of cumin, I used a teaspoon of garlic, dill, parsley, crushed red pepper and a teaspoon of chili powder. Gave it a nice little zing but not  too overpowering. Tasty! Also used some cornstarch to help thicken as I didn't have any instant potatoes. Will definitely make again!

It's not a thick chowder, not all are. If you've had R.I. clam chowder you know this. I worried about the glaze I used, but that added more flavor. Like some I skipped the cumin, it's not a fav of mine. I also put the vegies in earlier. I did thicken it just  a little with tips from other posters and used peas instead of corn. Corn would work fine, it was just a personal preference. My husband raved about it. He ate it 4 times in 1 week. I suggested to him putting a little cheddar on top and he declined. He didn't want the taste to change. That says it all.  lol  I would definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe.

We did not like the cumin taste in the chowder.  At first bite, I thought I would be disposing of the remaining chowder.  It grows on you as you eat it.  Will not be making again :(

It was good on day 1, but the leftovers were phenomenal on day 2.  Super easy.  I should have thickened mine, next time I will :).   I used chopped ham steaks and crumbed bacon.  My ham hock didn't thaw fast enough.  There will be many more times I make this recipe.

excellent flavor! of course we all make our modifications but i tried to keep true to the recipe.  i added three tbsp of butter after slow cooking and also added three tbsp of flour after putting the ham chum back into the soup to thicken it.  i also added a dash of pepper and cooked the veggies for two hours instead of 45 and they came out perfect.  i look forward to making this every time someone throws me a bone!

Loved this dish but have to say I ditched the cumin doesn't go with ham. I added chives and dill and a little parsley halved the broth and used cream instead. Delicious.

I just made this for dinner tonite and my family loved it!    Instead of using a crock pot I put the ham bone in a regular pot, covered it with water, added 3 bay leaves  and let it cook on low for 4 hours.  The juices from the ham and the water became my stock.  I combined 8 cups of the stock and 1 pint of half and half for my broth.  I reserved 1  cup of the stock  to use with cornstarch to thicken the broth as I wanted it thicker like a chowder.  I only added pepper and chili powder (for a little kick) to the broth.  I cooked the potatoes and onion for 30 minutes on low then added the celery and carrots and let it cook on low for another 30 minutes.

A little work, but worth it.  I didn't use my crockpot, just cooked for a couple of hours, real low in stock pot.  Very tasty for left over ham.

I omitted the potatoes and added a whole bunch of peas, some carrots and celery. I also puree the soup. Slow cooking the ham bone down really added flovour to the soup.Tasted great. Nice wholesome soup.

Excellent but you need much longer for the potatoes to cook. I used cream instead of milk, and since I had some ham broth left over I used 1 cup of that and 1 cup less of the chicken broth. I had lots of compliments from my guests on how good it was!

I followed the recipe, except I skipped the milk step because of time.  I had to wait for the bone to cool down.  It was a fine tasting soup.  I was unsure about the cumin, but it worked for me. Good use for leftover ham bone from Easter  dinner. 
I will try the mashed potato flakes suggested by another person to thicken the soup next time.

This was a helpful guide to making my first ham chowder! I left out the cumin, added extra leftover cubed ham, and cooked the veg about an hour. The carrots and celery were perfect, but I think it might have been better if I had put in the potatoes at the very beginning, so they could break down more. Also, cream works wonders! Much better than the sad skim milk we had in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Used ham from Easter. Only thing I'd do differently next time is make it thicker. Maybe using cornstarch and chicken broth. I like my soups ,
Chowders and stews thick.

I made this and it turned out wonderful. I did have to make some adjustments because my husband cannot eat onions , and I used what I had on hand. I added chopped celery and I didn't have cumin. I didn't have fresh parsley,  I substituted dry. I didn't have red potatoes  I just used regular potatoes and peeled them. The substitutions I made were purely out of necessity and it still turned out marvelous. It was even better when I serve the leftovers. What I really liked about it is  now I have another great recipe instead of always making ham and beans with my leftover ham bone.

We made this soup - I wouldn't call it a chowder, not thick enough - and weren't pleased. We agree with some commenters that the cumin is not complementary.

I made the recipe as posted and was very disappointed. It was thin and not at all like a chowder is suppose to be. And the garlic and cumin, just were not meant to be with ham. I feel like the person who posted,  took a basic recipe to use up leftover ham and tried to be creative by adding a couple flavors not usually associated with a ham dish, and came up with this recipe. A total bomb in my opinion.

I did it all except use the crock pot.  The Easter ham was already cut off the bone from the day before, so I put everything  but the ham in a stock pot, cooked it till the potatoes and carrots were soft, used a hand potato masher to break up the chunks, then added the milk and the ham.  I would add some flour to the milk to dissolve it and use a thickener if the soup is too runny next time.  Tasty.
