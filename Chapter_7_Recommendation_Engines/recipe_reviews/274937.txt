Made it exactly as is. Has a nice light orangey flavor. Excellent taste. Will make for the grandkids.

I made them exactly as the recipe called for and they really do remind me of eating an ice cream creamsicle.

It was a good cookie. Too sweet for me, and not enough orange flavor.

These are very good!  And I am really picky about my cookies!  I made them exactly as per the recipe, adding 1 tsp lemon zest (I was out of oranges), and using half the amount of white chocolate.  I got a really nice  crinkly top by baking for five minutes, then flattening with a spatula.  Just flattening before baking produced a smooth top.  The flavor was orange enuf to be evident, but not overpowering.  They were sweet, but not overly so.  These have become my new favorites!
