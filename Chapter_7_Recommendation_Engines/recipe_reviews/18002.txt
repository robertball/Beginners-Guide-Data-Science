I used sugar free orange gelatin and reduced fat sour cream. I actually made these into freezer pops using dixie cups and popsicle sticks. HOLY FRIJOLES, was this SO. FREAKING. GOOD. All of us were "mmmm-ing" over this dessert, even my husband who swears up and down that he hates "dreamsicles". This is one of the best things I've had in a LONG time. NOTE: To make this a little easier to prepare, if you can soften your sherbet as much as you can without it going completely liquid and beat that in with the soft-set gelatin, then fold in the sour cream and fruit, it turns out a lot better. It dosen't get gross that way.

Very good.  It has an unusual taste with the sour cream, but we really liked it.  I have made it several times for different functions and always get praises for it!!!

This has been a huge hit both times I served it.  I've made with and without the pineapple chunks.
Absolutely delicious and very refreshing for spring/summer. Thanks, Susan!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for Christmas and for a birthday celebration for work. I received many requests for the recipe. It makes for a pretty color too. I used boiling water to dissolve the gelatin. I also used a corningware oval dish and worked well in that too. Thanks for the great recipe!

Didn't really gel up like it seems like it's supposed to.

This has great flavor but mine did not gel properly either!  I made it for a shower I am giving tomorrow so I will have to figure out something else now.  Not sure what went wrong...disappointed!

This has a nice flavor (sort of like the old orange-cream ice cream bar), but as with another reviewer, mine did not gel well.  Only change I made was using sugar-free jello, but it was well-gelled before I beat in the sour cream and sherbet.  The instructions were to beat "...until fluffy and well blended."  Maybe I overbeat it, but it almost liquified.  By the time you add together the costs of three cans of fruit, a pint of sherbet, a container of sour cream, and two packages of jello, this was not an inexpensive dessert to make and then fail.  We'll end up drinking this like a smoothie so it won't go to waste, but I won't be making this again.

Very good! Nice cool and refreshing dessert for warm weather. I did use yogurt instead of sour cream. Topped with whipped cream. Yum! I'll be making this again.

This was so yummy!  I left out the pineapple and used 8 oz of Cool Whip instead of sour cream.  My grandkids couldn't get enough.

I made this for 75 people. It was fast and easy to make, and the first item gone at the party. Now itâ€™s requested for every event.

oh my goodness--I already know how wonderful this is-I had lost my recipe book from my mom and this was one of the favorite at all events for us too.  Thank you so much for bringing a great family childhood memory back-I will have to do it this weekend!!
