My husband said "this is the best lasagna ever, not just that you've made - but EVER!" I quite liked it as well. It did not require any extra salt though, the bacon makes it salty enough.

I was skeptical about this lasagna, which traditionally, for me, should be topped with mozzarella and include a ricotta mixture in the layers, but I thought if it has bacon in it, it's gotta be good!  I added a small can of tomato paste to the sauce mixture to help thickening because I was afraid of the dreaded "watery lasagna".  It was excellent!

This was sooo good! I added 26 oz of sauce instead of 15, and used no boil noodles. I also made sure to drain all of the grease from the meat so it would'nt be too greasy.
Delicious! Thank you!

This recipe is delicious.  I pureed the diced tomato because I'm not fond of the diced texture, but otherwise I left it just as the recipe states.  My husband is not a big fan of lasagna, but this one was so different from the traditional lasagna he loved it!

This was extremely cheesy and had a different taste.  It was probably good for Bacon/Cheese Lovers as the title proclaims but it wasn't outstanding to me.  It was just okay.  I also used Maple flavored bacon....maybe that was a mistake?

Hearty, cheesy, was great.  Took quite a long time to make, about 2 hours, but an easy 2 hours.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made just 1 pan.  Even the leftovers were very yummy!  It was not runny but thick and firm.  I will make this again when I have the time.

My family liked this a lot.  I'm going to make more sauce next time, because there wasn't enough of it.  It provided very patchy coverage.

Husband didn't care much for the leftovers, so I'll make a smaller amount next time.

GREAT.  My family loved it.  I did add an extra small can of tomato sauce to thin out the sauce a bit (otherwise it was more like thick chili without beans).  I will make again and use the no boil noodles.  Took a while to make, but well worth the effort.

Not very good ~ didn't taste like lasagna at all ~ but I should have known that when I saw there was no ricotta.  I just didn't like the flavor of this.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband is not a lasagna fan and he loves it! Both kids thoroughly enjoy this also. It's always a hit in our house and one of the few dishes with leftovers that get eaten! The colby cheese has a great taste with the tomato sauce and the bacon adds a distinctly different flavor. Excellent recipe and one of our family favorites!

Made this on a whim one night for the bf and I. Halved the recipe (as it says it's for 24 people) and only used one pan. The real work in this recipe is the prep! Once that's done, it's all downhill! Usually, my bf hates lasagna (the Ricotta cheese) so this was a fun, easy, and delicious alternative! Even our roommate (who hates tomatoes and onions) LOVED this recipe! And, because it makes a whole pan- we have lots of leftovers! yum!!

This is really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I cant think of anything to compare the taste to.  It is a one of a kind dish and will be a regular in my home.  The bacon flavor was very nice, not too much, but enough to make this great. My husband raved about it everytime he ate it (we had lots of leftovers) This is even better reheated.  Excellent.

I used low-sodium bacon and added 2 tablespoons of wheat germ to the sauce for a heart healthy version. I did not substitute the cheese for low-fat though, which was a good choice. Regular colby-jack was perfect. Cooking uncovered for 10 minutes was a good idea because it browned the cheese just a touch. I was a little nervous using a whole onion, but when I added the sauce it made sense. The amount of sauce is perfect for people that don't like too much sauce. This dish cooked well in a glass pan. The recipe can easily be cut in half and will make great leftovers for the two of us!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I did follow some previous review and added one can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce, i also added a little garlic to the meat when browning it. Gave it just a kick, this one will be on my list to use again. Thanx
