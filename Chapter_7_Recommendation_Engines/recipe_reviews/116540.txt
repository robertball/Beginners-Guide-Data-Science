Wonderful!  I had to fudge the recipe amounts since I was using one bundle of asparagus rather than just 10 pieces.  I trimmed them and put them in a ziplock bag along with some olive oil (about a tablespoon) and a dash of salt.  I shook it all up and just poured it out onto a cookie tray.  It took about 18 minutes to cook rather than 12, and I probably could have even gone a few more minutes.  But, my asparagus was slightly thick rather than the really skinny stalks so maybe that's the difference.  Whatever, the taste was phenomenal.  Loved the parmesan and garlic flavors.  Really great, thanks!

So good! I followed another reviewers advice and threw everything into a ziploc bag, mixed it up and dumped it all out onto a cookie sheet. Replaced the garlic salt with fresh minced garlic and kosher salt. Hubby loved it! This is definitely a keeper!

This is how I was originally taught to cook asparagus. Try sprinkling a half teaspoon of sugar over them before cooking - sounds strange but tastes wonderful!

Excellent - and incredibly beautiful on the dinner plate.  Use the cooking time only as a guide - my asparagus was thin and required a few less minutes.

Terrific combo and can be made even better if you add some fresh lemon juice and cracked black pepper!

Awesome flavor, but when I followed the cooking times, it was WAY over-cooked!  2nd attempt, I cut the time to 6 minutes total and, as much as I'm not a fan of asparagus, I have to admit, this was delicious!  
Excellent with the "Blissful Rosemary Chicken"!!!

Eating some of this right now and it's quite good. Read some of the other comments and made some changes accordingly. Firstly, I like to peel the bases of my asparagus so I did that first. Cooked for 10 minutes total would probably do closer to 8 minutes next time. Added fresh cracked white pepper, the juice of a lemon and freshly grated parmesan. Also, though the recipe recommends "brushing" the spears with oil, I just drizzled some in the pan and mixed the spears on top to cover. Far easier than dirtying a brush.

SIMPLY FANTASTIC! This recipe was super easy but amazingly good - Gourmet tasting for sure. I added a larger bunch of spears, and we like garlic alot.  I put three large spoons of the prepared minced garlic in the bag along with black pepper.  Once coated and on the baking sheet, I did sprinkle with some sea salt.  A hit with every family member. Leftovers are good cold too!

I've made this one twice now and am in love with how easy it is. I followed some other reviewers' advice and put everything into a plastic bag to mix it up and then dumped it onto a baking sheet. I baked it about 4-5 minutes on each side, and then sprinkled some extra parmesan on top while it was still warm. Delicious!

Added fresh ground black pepper and used fresh garlic and seasoning salt instead of garlic salt. Nice way to do asparagus.

Had no oil, so I melted butter on the pan while the oven heated. Then used 3 cloves fresh garlic and freshly grated pepper and salt, mixed it all together on the pan. Cooked six minutes then added the parm cheese for the last six minutes. Loved it!!!

I ate every single piece of asparagus myself. No, I did not share. This is absolutely the BEST. I will be making this again tomorrow.

I could easily eat the whole pan and have!!  :O)  This dish is very "user" friendly as you really cannot go wrong with measurement here.  Too much parmesan is not possible and I just lightly sprinkled the garlic salt regardless of how much or how little of spears I am preparing.  I found no use for tossing all within a ziploc bag ... I simply pour the oil into an oven pan and roll the asparagus to coat.  In a pinch when I have not had olive oil on hand, I had lightly oiled with canola oil with equally delicious results.  Adjusting the cooking time is as easy to alter to one's liking as is the ingredient amount.  I use the toaster oven to prepare so  Ican control the heat a bit easier.  Fresh asparagus plays a big part in this tasty dish.  Thanks Sarah for the ONLY asparagus recipe ever needed!!

Delicious and easy! just what I was looking for.  I used olive oil cooking spray on the spears rather than the actual oil since I had no brush.  I figure I used less oil this way too.

Not too into asparagus- we've been burned (literally and figuratively) by past recipes.  I am happy to say that this recipe restores my faith in asparagus!!!  Yum.  I used fresh pressed garlic mixed in with the evoo.

Really good! I baked for about 15 minutes instead of 12, and they were tender, but not mushy. I used olive oil spray and didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and regular salt.

I am not much of an asparagus eater (my husband is) and I must say, we both are impressed.  Using this recipe, I can easily say that I will make this again and again.

Great recipe!

I didn't even like asparagus before cooking this recipe! Cooked it for my husband and son, and loved it myself! We did modify: sprinkled minced garlic all of the asparagus prior to cooking. Yum!

I just made this for dinner and used frozen asparagus spears.  Wasn't quite sure how it would turn out but decided to give it a try bc I have used a similar recipie with fresh asparagus and it is so good.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil (no cleanup afterward), spread the spears on the cookie sheet, drizzled on the olive oil and tossed by hand to coat, then added the cheese and garlic salt and tossed again.  Baked in the oven at 450 F for about 15 minutes....I usually do fresh asparagus for 13 minutes at this temperature but allowed 2 extra minutes bc I used the spears while still frozen...didn't even bother to thaw them out.  This is also very good omitting the cheese and replace with rosemary.  Very good.  I will make again using the frozen asparagus as I do not live near a market and it is hard for me to keep fresh produce on hand.

i tried it by shaking it in ziploc with olive oil. I probably put way too much oil I guess, but I will probably follow the recommendations next time and brush it on instead.  I would also up the parmesan.

I make this recipe all the time. I made it one time for my husband and his friends and they (all big burly Marines who swear they don't like veggies) raved about it. Perfect side dish for just about anything.

DELICIOUS! This recipe was easy and absolutely wonderful! I made it for my husbands birthday dinner along with meatballs and whipped potatoes...we both loved it! I ended up cooking it in the microwave because it was cooking very slowly in the oven, and it still turned out great!

This turned out amazing and was such a nice change from garlic butter. I did use an entire bunch on asparagus so it took a bit longer. I used garlic instead of garlic salt. I'm keeping this one and will serve it to guests. Thank you.

I love this asparagus. I used to make it in a skillet but now this is so fast and easy and I make on foil so no dishes. I like to add garlic powder or crushed pepper on top too.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I did as another reviewer suggested and simply drizzled olive oil over the asparagus and then turned them to coat.  Other changes were that I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic salt.  I sprinkled the asparagus with chopped garlic and salt and also drizzled lemon juice on top as suggested by other reviews.  I then baked them rather than adding the garlic/salt after they were cooked.  I don't really see the sense in adding garlic salt after cooking.  I actually ate the finished product both with and without parmesan cheese.  Delicious either way.  I will make this again since it was so easy.

I have never baked asparagus before...but I liked this.  I did follow the reviews and bake this for a shorter time than the recipe stated (about 8 minutes) and added fresh minced garlic instead.  Delicioius.  Thanks for the post.

Extremely simple and easy.  For me, the perfect way to do asparagus.  I did, however, use 1 1/4 lbs. of thinnish spears (all I could find), meticulously snapped and shaved.  I did not brush on the oil, but rather tossed it with the asparagus and a little freshly ground black pepper.  Mine took only 8 minutes, total, due to the size of the spears; they were perfectly crisp-tender.  I used a bit more Parmesan/garlic salt to sprinkle over because I upped the amount of asparagus used.  This was enjoyed by all.  Thanks.

Tastes good and was very easy. Doesn't work w/ every dish. Made it as a side for a lemon chicken, which didn't seem to pair up well. Thought the lemon in common would've made the pairing work. Novice at work.

This recipe was easy and tasted great.  I added some crushed red pepper to add some heat based on personal preference, but it really didn't need any additional flavor.

This is a great simple way to prepare asparagus. Like previous reviewers, I used a ziploc bag and coated the spears before baking. My variations: I used caramelized garlic olive oil and omitted the garlic itself. I also finished it off with a drizzle of balsamic glaze. My whole family loved it. My husband raved over this method!!

My hubby made this for us last night.  He'd never cooked asparagus before, and found this to be very easy to prepare.  Everyone in the family loved it, and we'll definitely be saving this recipe to make it again.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I really would have like more Parm.  I think next time we'll be either doubling the grated Parm, or shredding some fresh Parm over it.  That being said - my family loves super cheesy dishes, so this probably is great for most people the way it is.

First time cooking asparagus. I missed eating lunch today, so the first batch came out great, and ended up eating the whole bunch! Both times, I cooked them with cherry tomatoes. YUM!!

Easy and delicious. I put asparagus in gallon ziplock with olive oil as others suggested and it makes for even coating of oil and then salt and pepper stick evenly as well.

Not sure what the ratio of garlic:salt in garlic salt. I used granulated garlic and some kosher salt instead. Also used the bag toss method. Spears about 3/8 inch dia. only took about 6 minutes at 400, oven was very well preheated cooking other items. no time for turning. great recipe, will use again and again.

I have always steamed my asparagus, but no longer. The roasting seems to bring out more of the flavor. This recipe is simple and tasty.

My family absolutley loved this side. We had this with a breaded pork chip and it actually complemented quite well. Easy to make with no fuss, which leaves you to focus on the main dish. Will make again and often.

I trimmed and then threw into a ziplock as others suggested.  Measurements were different as I had more than 10 stalks so I just used my best judgment.  I added olive oil, 4 cloves minced fresh garlic, salt and pepper to the bag and let it marinade for a couple of hours.  Poured it all onto a cookie sheet and cooked about as long as it says here, then sprinkled with shaved parmesan.  Yum!  Got rave reviews as well.  Cooked for me to perfection - still a little crispy how I like it.

My first time cooking asparagus and while the Parmesan-Garlic Salt combo was great, the asparagus was chewy and limp.  Upon talking to a great chef-friend of mine, baking asparagus leads to limp and chewy and it should be cooked on a hot skillet like the other Asparagus Parmesan recipe says.  I gave 2 stars because the mixture was good, but the baking process was not there at all.

Love...love...love, but of course we love asparagus. This was tasty. 12 minutes tops and then set aside for 5 minutes. Not soggy and just the right amount of crunch, skip the garlic salt, add fresh slices of garlic and sea salt and pepper, just wonderful.

Easy and delicious! Definitely a do-over. I think the texture was just fine - I think you just need to adjust your cooking time depending on the thickness of your asparagus stalks. But, that's pretty common sense when cooking asparagus. :)

This was so easy and tasted great. I grilled the asparagus and served it alongside BBQ chicken which worked out grest as I could use the chicken to pick up the Parmesan remnants.

This recipe is terrific - even my pickiest kid liked it.  I used the method of using a ziploc bag, and minced garlic, and lemon pepper seasoning.
I even tried it with shrimp added in the bag - superb!

Made this for dinner along with two other recipes from this site (Salmon with a creamy dill sauce and Honey Roasted Red Potatoes). What a delicious, quick and easy meal! Prepared it all when I got home from work :) My asparagus were average thickness and needed to cook longer than the 12 minutes stated, I baked them for approx 16 min and that was perfect. Yummy side dish!!!

LOVE this recipe!!  Tried it out on my roommate who doesn't like veggies and he was amazed with the taste, he couldn't stop saying how great the taste was (neither could I).  I took the advice of some other reviewers and mixed the oil and some garlic salt in a ziplock bag...no mess, worked great. I also added a small "pinch" of sugar to the bag too! Took the asparagus out of the bag and placed them on a cookie sheet.  Cooked for approx 8 min on each side. Them removed the cookie sheet, sprinkled the cheese w/garlic salt over the asparagus and put back in the oven for about 2 minutes to melt the cheese, then removed the sheet.  I then sprinkled some diced Almonds on the top for some added crunch and it was fantastic.....will be making this recipe a lot!!!

Good asparagus, but I think I put too much Parmesan. Personally I think it would be better with just a little salt; the garlic and Parmesan are too strong and overpower the asparagus. However, for someone who doesn't normally like asparagus, this is a great way to try it.

This was just an ok recipe.  I cooked it for longer than the recommended time and it still wasn't as tender as it should be and made it difficult for my kids to eat it.

Perfect! My whole family loved this recipe. I did substitute spinach for the escarole, though. This soup reheats well, so make a big batch.

We did this recipe on the grill (wrapped in foil) as we were grilling steaks. I think my husband left them on a bit too long and the asparagus were a bit too soggy. But overall, a great taste. Just watch the temp and cook time if you grill.

This was de-lish!!! I didn't read all the way through the directions and only baked my asparagus 6 mins, but they were thin so it was perfect. I had two bunch of asparagus and I blanched the rest, but I am thinking of taking them back out to make another batch of this. Thanks for the great recipe.

The only reason I gave this a lower rating was the cooking process...much simpler to just cook in a frying pan..like Asparagus with Sliced almonds and parmesan from this site.

Another way to do this is put your trimmed asparagus in a large zip lock bag, add olive oil and grated (dry) parmesan cheese.  Close the bag and shake it up, grill on the bbq and you will love this recipe.  Every time I see someone buying asparagus in the store I tell them about it.  You will love it!  And yes the author is right I never ate it until I had it this way.  Enjoy!

Very yummy. I just take each asparagus spear and bend it until it snaps naturally, and throw away the bottoms. I drizzled oil instead of brushing, and I put garlic salt, and small pieces of real garlic on while it roasted the first several minutes, and then sprinkled the cheese on the last 2-3 minutes. Everyone loved it!

What a great way to add more flavor to asparagus!  I didn't have garlic salt on hand so I used another garlic seasoning I had as well as some lemon pepper seasoning.  I will definitely keep this in mind the next time I make asparagus or some other type of green vegetable.

this was okay but not stellar.  I liked it, but the rest of my family prefers the other ways that we usually cook asparagus over this one.  Still, it was fun to try something new.  Thanks!

You were right! My boyfriend was very surprised - he said this was the first time he's enjoyed asparagus :) I used pretty thick peices, tossed them in the olive oil and baked on 350 for about 8 minutes, rolling them around on the sheet about halfway through. They were just crispy enough.

Definitely a good recipe.  I also used a bundle of aparagus and drizzled enough olive oil over the aparagus in a baking dish and mixed it together with salt and pepper.  A great addition is to bake it with fresh minced garlic on top.  So good!!  This paired wonderfully with chicken marsala and a baked potato that I made for dinner.  Nice twist on baked aparagus!!

This was my first time making Asparagus. It was super easy to do. I, like the other reviewer, had to increase the recipe amounts. I also put them in a ziplock bag along with the olive oil, shook it, and put it on a baking sheet. I also cooked them longer because they were thicker. They turned out nice and tasty. My sister-in-law loves asparagus and especially enjoyed this recipe!

This is pretty much the only way I eat asparagus now. Except instead of the oven, I just wash and trim the asparagus and put it in the steamer. When it's done I sprinkle and toss with olive oil, then add the garlic salt and parmesan. Yum!

I saw this recipe and then made it without looking back to the recipe. I realize now I did it a little different by accident- I put the garlic salt, parm and oil all together before cooking. It was super easy and tastes so good. I've made it about once a week since!! Oh, I also cut the spears before cooking.. same ingredients, just a little different. The parm gets crunchy yummy on the spears.. the flavor is amazing! My new go-to for Asparagus! Thanks!

The recipe is very unclear about the amount of asparagus.  10 medium spears could mean 1/4 to 1 full pound.  I used 1 pound of very pencil thin spears and the rest of the recipe as written.  Because they were so tiny it only took about 15 minutes to roast at 375 degrees because I had something else in the oven.  They needed more parmesan cheese after baking. It was fairly bland but I put enough cheese and some salt on to be tasty.

Wish I could give this 10 stars!  We always add more garlic but otherwise it's simply amazing!!  We tend to make this as a side when we have guests over and we've had several non-aspagus eaters convert!  BEST way to cook green veggies is to roast them like this.  Broccoli, brussel sprouts, etc.  YUM.

i try to include a good variety of vegetables in our everyday diet, and this is definitely going to be included in my arsenal of recipes. my husband said it was good (without me having to ask if he liked it). he's eating it right now and said, "this is great, this might go down as the best vegetable i've ever had".  i'll be making it again for sure :)

I've made something similar to this before, but with a few more ingredients.  I wish I could take credit for this, but my dad's girlfriend told me about this and had to share since it was so delicious.  In addition to the above I include a half onion chopped (chop it any way you like it), about a spoon of minced garlic, salt and pepper with the asparagus.  Bake this at 325 for about 15-20 minutes.  While that is baking, slice about a cup to a cup and a half of cherry tomatoes in halves.  Once the asparagus is done add the cherry tomatoes and shredded Parmesan. I recommend using fresh Parmesan and shredding it yourself.  Then pop this back into the oven for about 5 minutes or until cheese has melted.  I know this adds calories but calories well worth it!  Enjoy.

Very tasty and exceedingly simple.  Also, instead of baking, try grilling the asparagus for 6-8 minutes over medium heat.  Perfect with grilled salmon!

This was the best way to cook asparagus, my fiance and I loved it!  I followed the recipe except didnt have fresh asparagus, I had frozen, and no garlic salt so I used a little salt and some dried garlic.  I baked it for about 5 mins, tossed, then baked another 5 mins.  It still had a little left to cook so for the last 2-3 mins I put them under the broiler. Very delicious and perfectly done.

Turned out great!  I didn't measure, and I used the whole bunch of asparagus versus only 10 spears as the recipe calls for, and it was awesome.  The freshly grated cheese slightly melted on top of the hot asparagus... yum!

This was really good, the changes I made were garlic powder with salt sprinkled on, some pepper, and cooking time since I had double the amount and they were quite large spears was in increased by another 5 min.

I love these asparagus.  This is a simple and easy way to get nice and crunchy asparagus.  I normally sprinkle them with the garlic salt, pepper and parmesan cheese while they're baking.  They always turn out great!

Very nice dish and easy to prepare.  The cooking time needs to be increased a bit from what is shown in the recipe.  Next time I prepare this, I'm going to substitute butter/lemon juice for the olive oil and see how that turns out.

This is an easy and great way to spice up boring asparagus. The only thing I would change is the amount of parmasan used. I would probably only use 3/4 of the amount called for.

I actually put the cheese mix on *before* putting them in the oven, realized I'd made a mistake that was too late to fix, put *more* cheese on when I turned them... and OMG they came out DELICIOUS.

My family eats green beans, yellow beans, and corn.  I'm trying to branch out and tried this recipe tonight.  We were all amazed that it was good because the last time we tried asparagus, it was from a can-yuck!  The only thing I did different was use 2 cloves of garlic, and I didn't measure out the olive oil, salt, or cheese.  Next time, more garlic and pinch more salt.  I give this five stars because it's quick, easy, healthy, and tasty.

This was excellent.  I took the tips from a few other reviewers.  I had an asparagus bunch.  After I trimmed the spears up, I put them in a bag with olive oil, minced garlic, parmesan cheese, salt and some lemon juice.  I let it sit and marinate for a little bit, and then placed it on a cookie sheet and baked it.  My boyfriend loved it.  Thanks so much!

Love this recipe, even my teenage daughter love this.  I always use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I didn't cook the asparagus too long because I love mine crunchy.

I quadrupled the recipe.  Marinated the asparagus in the oil and garlic salt for 3 hrs.  Cooked as directed.  My only addition was some fresh cracked black pepper.  Really very good.

This was our first go at roasting vs. steaming asparagus, and it was very nice. We did not have garlic salt, but I did have garlic powder and sea salt, so that was the one substitution. We tried it as written with that exception and then spritzed the last portions with lemon juice. Either way, it's a good accompaniment to chicken.

The times that were recommended for the baking of the Aspargus did work for it.  I ended up boiling it to finish the cooking.  But I did all the other things that were in the recipe and it turned out really good.

My family has eaten steamed asparagus (no seasoning) for years, and we really love it. However, this recipe is a nice change. They're always excited to try something new, and I'm happy when it turns out delicious! I did this recipe a little different. The cooking time was about right - my local grocer sells the thicker asparagus spears, but I used far less garlic salt and parmesan than the recipe calls for. I'm going to make this one again some time!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it is simple and oh so yummy.     My husband who I had to fight to take a bite took one bite then ate and ate and ate.

I liked this recipe well enough.  The kids didn't much care for it, but I expected that.  Next time we might change it up with some added flavors.

Love it! Did what others suggested and put it in a bag with olive oil, some McCormick spices and threw some parmeson cheese in. VERY good!

Great!  Very quick and easy but restaurant quality.  I used the zip lock bag method and my kids tossed it around for a few minutes playing catch.  Perfect way to include your kids in the cooking!

Delightful!  I didn't want additional salt, so I substituted garlic salt for garlic pepper and had a delicious result!  This is a very easy & quick way to serve asparagus that not only looks good on your plate, but scents your home while baking, preparing your taste buds for an explosion of flavor!  Thank you for sharing!

When I made this recipe, it was the first time our family had tried asparagus. My very picky ten year old asked me to make it again the next day!
