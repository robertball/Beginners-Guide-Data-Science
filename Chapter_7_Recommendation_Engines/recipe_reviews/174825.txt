Really nice for a change of pace of birthday cakes.  I made this for a coworkers birthday and it was demolished.  I will say it was not one of my prettiest cakes, it gets a bit sticky and dense, but made up for its looks with its taste!   Betty Crocker now makes gluten free cake mixes, so I will still be able to enjoy this now that I am gluten free!
