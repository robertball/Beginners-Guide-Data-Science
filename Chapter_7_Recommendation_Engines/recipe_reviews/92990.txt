You CAN slow cook a turkey at 240 degrees without any problems.  I cook at a resturant and we use an Altosham cook and hold oven.  I agree that opening the oven first doesn't give a consistant temperature, second wastes energy to reheat the oven, but if the bird reaches 175 to 180 degrees internal temp it doesn't matter how the bird is cooked.  Cook and hold ovens that resturants use to cook turkey, prime rib stuff like that cook for longer periods of time at much lower temps.  Most cook and hold ovens only go to 250.  As an example it will take me 10 hours of cooking at 240 for a 25lb turkey.  The oven then goes into a hold cycle of 160 degrees.  The minimum hold time is 3 hours with a max hold time of 10 hours.  So it could take 12-14 hours to fully cook a 25lb turkey.  This is the way resturants are able to make turkey juicy.  Lower temps/longer cooking = juicy!  This can be done in a conventional oven as well.

Great recipe! There is nothing wrong with opening the oven to baste as often as you like.  As long as it cooks to the correct temp and long enough it is fine.

I do my turkey very simular to this, but to save myself a lot of basting I mix some unmelted butter with some salt and pepper and lift the turkey skin by slipping my hands underneath and over the breast and pack the butter mix in underneath the skin so that it cooks into the turkey instead of running off. I then just secure the skin back down over the turkey with a couple of toothpicks. It still gives that crisp, golden brown coloring.

Too much work for too little return. Tried this a couple of weeks ago and wasnt any more moist. Tenting the turkey and basting a couple of times, or cooking it breast side down will give the same results and frustrate the cook less and take less time.

Just made this turkey again today for Thanksgiving. It is the second time I used this recipe. What I did differently was I added half the amount of butter initially, and then rubbed more on with a rubber spatula the first few times I basted until the stick was gone. I must say, basting every ten minutes is too much. By the time your oven reheats itself, you're opening it again to baste. Such a waste of energy and time. I was basting every 20 minutes to a half hour, making sure I doused every inch of the turkey. It was super delicious and really juicy. The juices seeped off of my cutting board and onto the floor lol

I followed the advice of another reviewer and stuffed butter under the skin. I've never had such most turkey. I only had to baste it every half hour or so. I also added garlic powder to the salt and pepper and rubbed it in well.
