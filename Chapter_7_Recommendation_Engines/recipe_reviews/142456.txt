I altered the recipe alot! I added 1 tsp chopped chillies, 1 tbsp of garam masala, an extra tin of tomatoes, fresh cherry tomatoes & I left out the carrots and mushrooms ( I just couldn't add them to a rogan josh!) I don't have a slow cooker so I browned the lamb shank & then added the sauce & veg - simmered it for 4 hours & the meat fell off the bone. I kept the potatoes large and it took this length of time to cook them perfectly. We enjoyed it with these changes.

this was very good, nothing at all like the rogan josh you get at an indian restraunt but the sauce was incredible... 

i used lamb steaks instead of shanks because i didnt have any shanks and the meat itself wasnt that great but thats definitely not because of the recipe.. it was just full of fat and bones... next time i will use either lamb shanks or a big lump of beef.... definitely making this again... great flavor and it smells incredible when its cooking

Just a tip(s) for the person who thought the lamb was too greasy.
--Brown the lamb shanks well before placing in tomato mixture.  Browning helps melt excess fat and enhances the flavor.
--When done cooking, cool and refrigerate overnight.  Skim the excess fat from the surface, then reheat.  
It tastes even better the second day.  Love the spice combo.  It really makes the dish sing.

Confession: I gathered most of the ingredients for this at the grocery store before I arrived at the lamb section and balked at the prices (yes, I'm a lamb newbie). So, I made the recipe with 12 lbs. (triple batch) of beef short ribs instead for my family today (Christmas Eve). They loved it! Amazing how the ingredients still result in a very down-home midwestern beef stew impression. Nice, rich blend of flavors! Good "bad weather trapped indoors" food. :)

Space caveat, though: took me 2 crock pots plus 1 pot on the stove (to accomodate the potatoes) to make the triple batch. Will definitely make this again! Reheats nicely with a little mozzarella and/or provolone on top.

This got 4 stars because my husband gives it 3 1/2 and I give it 4 1/2...

Very easy to prepare provided you have the spices on hand. It was hard for me to imagine how this would taste but it comes together very nicely and you don't end up with any one of the flavors overpowering the others. I have a hard time imagining the person who wouldn't like this. 

The "broth" would also be great with beef, or I could even see it with a heavier fish, like salmon. 

We cooked this in a dutch oven for 3 hours at 350 degrees and it was perfect. We used two concentrated broth pouches instead of the bullion just out of preference. Otherwise we followed the recipe just as it is. 

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

After scanning this recipe I made changes according to what I had in the fridge (no carrots and no mushrooms).  I have to say, this meal tastes fantastic. I think it's because of the spice combination and the slow cooking.  Normally my husband doesn't like slow cooker meals but he rated this A+ - I highly recommend this recipe.

This is an awsome recipe. My 9 year old even loved it. Tasted a lot like beef stew. No "gamey" lamb flavor to it. I used fresh red new potatoes and baby carrots. I also substituted the whole cardamom with 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom since I had none whole. Excellent use of lamb shanks if you don't know what to do with them!!! Thanks!

Very tender meat and savory sauce. I am sensitive to all milk products so I used non-dairy 'sour cream.'

Does this really take 8 hours on HIGH? That's about twice as long as most recipes for lamb shanks, isn't it? Was this an error and it should be 8 hours on LOW?  Hope so.

Wonderful!  I made this on a rainy, cold Sunday and it was perfect.  I would not change a thing.  This recipe is flavorful, but not spicy.  It is well worth the wait- thank you!

What a disappointment!!! Not even close to being an "Indian" dish. Turned into a big pot of grease. I can't believe the reviews. The flavors weren't enough for this much lamb. Also, why use canned carrots and potatoes?

This was good, but I wouldn't say it was worth 5 stars.  I used the seasonings as listed, and the resulting stew just wasn't flavorful enough.  Good seasoning combination together, but just not enough of it.

I've only had Rogan Josh once before at a restaurant. I liked it better there. If you're a more experience RJ eater, then maybe you'll have a different opinion. One reason I didn't like how it tasted from the crock pot is the fatty lamb cuts caused the dish to be extremely greasy. If it weren't for that I think it would've been a lot better because it did have a decent flavor aside from that.

Made this with a cubed pot roast (as I am the only lamb fan in the family) and it was well received.  I also subbed yogurt for the sour cream as it breaks down tough cuts very nicely.  Thanks!

This was delicious-but I had to make a few changes bc my kids don't like lamb. Used  two beef shanks and one porterhouse steak, 2 carrots sliced and 2 stalks of celery sliced and one cubed Idaho potato instead of anything canned. Didn't have cardamom so put in a 1/2 tsp of fennel seed, cumin and turmeric. I added garlic slivers. Browned the meat with two cloves of garlic, slivered, and then followed the steps of the recipe. But when it came time to put the vegies in I added 2 cups of beef broth (better than buillion and water), a bay leaf bc it was beef based and beef shanks are much bigger than lamb shanks. If I were to change anything from my modifications it would be 1 cup of beef broth. Otherwise it was delicious!

This was really tasty, and I loved making it in a crock pot because I could just leave it overnight and it was ready to go!  The sauce was slightly sweet and tangy, which was slightly surprising, but the tangy with the savoury meat was a good combination.  I would make this again.

I was not happy with this recipe. While I made some substitutions and adjusted the quantity, the result was more like a western stew than rogan gosht.

It doesn't have a taste of India, but is good. Will make it again, and maybe try some different ingredients.

What I cooked by following this recipe literally was disappointing, although my wife liked it.
