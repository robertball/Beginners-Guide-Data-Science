I subbed fresh dill for the rosemary. This was quite good. I also simmered for quite awhile to soften everything up :)

I have to say three stars because although I used the basic recipe, I also added my own touches...I like to use less water, maybe 1 1/2 to 2 cups, I also added 28oz can crushed tomatoes instead of the diced,  more garlic of course, and this goes really well with couscous, and chicken breast pieces fried separately in garlic...that way you can also make the meat eaters happy, and bump this up to a meal.

The soup was great but i decided to tweek it a little. I first sauted the oil, garlic, tomatoes,and chickpeas in a non-stick frying pan for 20 minutes to reduce the juices from the tomatoes. I then placed the tomatoes and chickpeas in the sauce pot and added the remaining ingredients. Finnally I added a little shredded roast chicken and i was in heaven.

So it is the new year and I gained too much weight over the holidays.  Found this healthy, low cal soup and decided to give it a try.  I loved it!  Great taste for something so easy.  I used chicken broth instead of water & bouillon and added 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper.  Also threw in a little orzo.  Even with the orzo, it was still very low cal.  A great start to a new year.

I love it.  I replaced the bullion cube with 2 tbs of Minors Vegetarian Consonmme Prep (chicken style) from soupbase.com.  Great flavour and enjoiable hot or cold.  I will add another can of tomatoes next time.

Definitely a base soup.  I made it for myself, and then made it for a party.  I added kidney beans, white beans, brown sugar (the tomatoes were a little bitter to me), and vegetarian stock instead of the water.  I left the party with an empty pot.  I suggest making the soup your own, its one of those kitchen sink recipes where you can add what you like.

Love this soup. I changed it a little. I pureed the tomatoes and chick peas. Instead of rosemary, I added a little ground cloves and ground red pepper. I added flax seed meal to the cup of soup just before eating to make it thicker (and to add fiber).

Very bland.  I had to use 3 bouillon cubes instead of 3 to give it any flavor.  Otherwise it was just like beans and tomatoes floating around in water. I will make it again, but with my changes.

Like another reviewer stated - this recipe is a base recipe - but it does have alot of potential. I too added alot more garlic, a can of corn, a can of kidney beans, a can of tomato paste and more liquid. I used 2 tsp. cuin and 1 tsp. of corriander to give it some life and i sprinkled fresh cilanto on top.

Had no money to go shopping so I used what I had. Added onion, canned chicken, pasta, corn, canned sauce, cumin and used dried Rosemary instead of fresh. Oh yeah, used beef instead of chicken bouillon. It's what I had.

For me, this recipe was missing something, but my husband enjoyed it.
I even tried adding some cumin that one of the reviewers mentioned and added couscous that another reviewer suggested, but it still didn't do it for me. It was just okay!

This was pretty good. I reduced the water to half and served over rice. Next time I would throw in some cumin, but this definitely was super-quick.

I was so pleased with this quick find -- very simple and clean kind of recipe.  I threw in 1/4 c star pasta to grab my kids' attention.  With fresh parmegan or romano, it would be a lovely first course.  I will keep this one close by to use again -- delicious.  Thanks, Lizzie!

I liked this stuff, but it's not good for a big crowd. I don't think too many people like garbanzo beans.

I was really surprised at how good this very basic and quick recipe is. The only changes I made were to use 2 cloves of garlic, cut back to 2 cups of water, blended the entire pot, and then added a bit of milk at the end. A nice thick mild tomato soup! My 3-yr old ate 3 bowls and that is proof enough for me.

I tried using fresh tomatoes and less water.  I would defintely try the canned tomatoes next time because it tasted like tomatoe flavored water with garbanzo beans.

I was looking for a low-fat, quick and tasty soup and this fit the bill.  I only used 1 t of olive oil and substituted 2 cans of chicken broth for the bullion.  I think the fresh rosemary is what really makes this soup.  5 stars for ease of preparation and taste.

This recipe was quick and easy to make.  I love chickpea's, but it just didn't quite fit in this tomato soup.  Boyfriend didn't even touch it.  I like to give recipes another try.  I may try again in a few months.

Great soup for the tomato lover !! Used late season garden tomatoes and 1/2 water (2 cups). Added 1 cup left over pork loin, plus scallion & parsley. Recommend longer simmer, thickening time, but otherwise a fine soup!

Ad written, this soup is edible but BORING!!!  But, it is a FABULOUS base recipe... so much potential in this soup!  I like to use chicken stock (or chicken broth) instead of water, add shredded/roasted chicken or even kielbasa, add different beans, some more seasonings (especially garlic.)  And, I do cook this in the crock on low (stirring occasionally) for at least 6-8 hrs to get a full blending of flavors.  Worth 'playing' with this recipe to get the flavors you want!
