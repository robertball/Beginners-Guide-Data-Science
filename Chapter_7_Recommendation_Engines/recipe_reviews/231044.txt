I wasn't sure how we'd like cheddar mixed with Alfredo but it was good. I made my own Alfredo because I'm not a fan of the jarred stuff so I didn't make it as easy on myself as the recipe intended but to me it's worth it. The reason it doesn't get a full 5 is that the Alfredo and cheese was really thick after being baked...maybe adding a little milk would make it more saucy-I even made sure I didn't make a super thick Alfredo I tried to make it the same consistency as I remember the jarred kind being. Also I wasn't a fan of the cheese on top of the breadcrumbs...it was a little rubbery to me. Other than that a winner! Served for lunch with a salad.

Very good and kids liked it even with spinach added to it and using mediterannean flavoured bread crumbs. I made my own alfredo sauce as well so it was flavoured like we like it and only baked it for 20 minutes bt next time 15 mins should be sufficient since the cheese darked too much.

I love baked Mac and cheese but it's so much work that I barely make it. But this makes it much easier. Everyone loved it. Rich and creamy (not at all dry like someone else said perhaps they did something wrong). Full of flavor. For the purist the flavor does include Alfredo flavor so be warned. I was skeptical but it's actually not a bad combo. Surprisingly. I did add a little more to the recipe though. I used one pound of cheddar and put 3/4 in the sauce and the other 1/4 on top. Then I topped with Italian herb bread crumbs and finally panko. The Italian herb added flavor and the panko added crisp! I didn't measure the bread crumbs but it was certainly more than 1/4 cup. I just sprinkled it on there until there was a good coating over the top. It turned out delicious. People went back for more and there was none left at the end of the night!

It was dry and a waste of time. It came out looking just like the picture. Bread crumbs sat on top and didn't add any taste. Won't make this again.

Normal run of the mill mac n cheese. Super easy love that I didn't have to make a rue. Added rotisserie chicken and broccoli and made it an all in one meal. My two year old LOVED it!

I added bacon bits to the cheese and it was a huge hit. I will be making this regularly.
