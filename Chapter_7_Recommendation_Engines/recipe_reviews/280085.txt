The ginger and garlic sauce was very good. I substituted sliced onion and mushrooms for one bag of stir fry vegetables, but kept the sauce as is. Next time I might make a little more of the sauce so there's more goodness for the rice to soak up.

Delicious.  I used one T sugar instead of the 2 Ts of honey, and it was plenty sweet for me.  Otherwise, made exactly as written (well ok, I did add more garlic and red pepper because yum).

Excellent. Followed as closely as possible, didnâ€™t have powdered honey so whisked in the same amount of regular honey. Even the picky kids liked it. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would. Something has to be pretty mind blowing for me to give 5 stars.

easy and easy too change up with fresh vegetables,  I sliced up any type of freezer beef , let it thaw a tad which makes it easy to slice into very thin strips.
