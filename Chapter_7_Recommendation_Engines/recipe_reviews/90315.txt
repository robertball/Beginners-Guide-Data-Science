Very delicious! I added ground turkey and used 2 zucchini and 2 yellow squash. I added 1 teaspoon of cumin and a little extra chili powder because of my additions. I also used frozen corn instead of the canned. I only used a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste. Thank you for the recipe!

Very wonderful! first off i have never made a chili before, (and i don't like beans). I bought a cornbread mix a couple of weeks ago and realized i needed to do something with it and thought well chili would work, and thus i stumbled onto this. I doubled most all the veggies since i am a veggie.  it made enough left-overs for my boyfriend and I to enjoy for three days! (he even had chili dogs, since he is a meat eatter.) I used chedder cheese, chopped green onions, and even sour cream as toppings! this is a regular for me now!

This recipe was even better than we'd hoped.  I omitted the yellow squash (didn't have any) and added a yellow pepper (along with the green pepper.)  I also added a can of diced tomatoes because that's what I had in the pantry.
Since we aren't vegetarians, we added grated chedder cheese to the top.  I also added LA Gold Hot sauce.  But again, that was post-cooking.  Serve this with some good corn bread and you'll score a home run!  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.

This recipe is VERY GOOD the way it is! Especially if you are looking for a more Vegan diet, this will be on top of your list to prepare from here on out. To add any kind of meat to it would ruin it and take away the taste it was meant to have.
Fix it for what it is.. a VEGGIE Chili!

Great vegetarian dish. It wasn't as difficult to make as I had anticipated. I don't like yellow squash and omitted that and substituted a yellow pepper for the green pepper and also left out the jalapeno. Make sure you stir it occasionally as it's cooking, or else you'll end up scraping a lot of burnt chili from the bottom of the pot. Very filling; will definitely make it again!

Nice vegetarian recipe!  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste.  Use any variety of vegetables you have on hand.  Everybody agreed that they didn't miss the meat!  Thanks, Jen!

This is a pretty good chili recipe. Tasty, vegetarian friendly, and full of vegetables!  My only complaint is that it was a little spaghetti-sauce-tasting.   Next time I make it, I'm going to add one of those "chili spice" packages and I think that will make it perfect!

This was AWESOME!!! I added ground turkey and used an "Italian herb" flavored tomato paste. Thats it! The only hard part is the chopping (I cut myself :( ) After your done, just throw it in the pot and wait! I set my timer in 15 min. increments to stir. Really, this could not have come out any better. Just a dollop of Daisy is all you will need!

I agree with the others.   This can be really spicy especially if you slow cook it in a crock pot.  If you cut down on the spices, it is fantastic!!!

Very beautiful chili.  I added a lot more chili pepper and spices to kick up the flavors a bit.

Pretty good recipe. I substituted the yellow squash with carrots, as I couldn't find any at the store. Used 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp dried parsley and the rest of the spices as written.   The veggies still turned out a bit crunchy, even after sauteing and cooking for 1 hour. Next time I may cook the veggies in oil for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. Also forgot the garlic, but still turned out fine. Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  As a chili lover, I have my own secret recipe and this was my first attempt at a veggie chili.  The second time I made it, I added portobello mushrooms (about 4), chipotle peppers and a habenero pepper.  It added the right amount of heat and brought on a whole new flavor

Awesome!  I actually won a chili cook-off at a co-worker's house with this recipe (with a few modifications).  I did not use the chili beans and added a second can of black bean instead  I added extra chili pepper to make up for the lost spicy sauce.  I also used an poblano pepper in place of the green pepper, which added a little kick.  I used Mexican oregano to give it less of an Italian flavor.  I put it in the fridge over night to let the flavor set in and then reheated it the next day over the stove and added quite a bit more of the cayenne pepper and some crushed red pepper to give it more flavor.  It was perfect in the end!

Yum! What a great base recipe. I totally cheated and just threw this all in a crockpot and cooked on Hi for 4 hours. I didn't quite have everything listed, so I used Rotel instead of crushed tomatoes + 1 fresh tomato, 1 can Pinto beans + hot sauce + 1 8 oz. can tomato sauce, and a bit of cumin. Add some cheddar on top & voila!

Very good! I didn't have chili beans so I used red kidney beans and added some spices instead. I also added celery, cumin, a can of garbanzo beans, and some cheddar cheese on top. I had to add a little water to this because of the extra veggies because it was too thick for me. Makes a very big batch! Can't wait to eat it again though.

The best vegetarian chili recipe I've had. This is a beautiful looking and delicious tasting recipe. For the meat-needers, just stir some browned ground meat of your choice it. But I had meat lovers and vegetarians swooning over this one alike. And cornbread or a cheese bread is an awesome side for this, by the way.

This is delicious! I am on a plant based diet so I am always on the lookout for alternatives to meat dishes and this one is a good one. I followed the recipe with one suggested addition, cumin. I recommend this to anyone as my whole meat loving picky family liked it.  Enjoy!

Even my kids loved this, even without the meat. I substituted 1/2 of the tomatoes with Italian style stewed tomatoes and it added a unique flavor.

I added 1 lb. lean ground turkey (browned before adding veggies) and used 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchini and omitted the jalapeño - followed the recipe pretty closely otherwise. Absolutely delicious. My boyfriend said it's the best chili he's ever had (and he's a huge beef eater).

Honestly if I could give this more stars I would!  We are not vegetarians and my husband was not happy about me making a chili without meat in it but we loved this.  I only made a couple small modifications.  I used a yellow pepper instead of yellow squash and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes.  I also added a little chicken broth as it seemed really thick.  I made the healthy cornbread recipe from this site and let the chili simmer while I got that ready, about 30-40 minutes.  I am trying to cook without meat a couple of times a week and this will certainly go in the rotation.

I'm very new (within a week) to eating a plant based diet and this was really good.  That's quite a compliment considering I'm still REALLY craving bacon cheeseburgers :)  I put WAY too much cayenne in it (totally my fault, not the recipe) and I learned that when you can't add sugar or anything dairy a little sweet basil really helps calm down the spice :)

This was not good per the recipe.  It tasted like spicey tomatoes.  So, to save what I had, I added 1 can of beef broth and 1 pound of ground beef browned and drained and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Making soup with it now to save my ingredients.  I will not make this again.  Thought it would be good to use my fresh veggies from the garden.

This chili is fantastic and I love how beautiful it looks in the bowl!  My husband and I are meat eaters so I added 1 pound of extra lean ground beef and 2 cups of water.  I don't know if we really needed it!

I made this with my boyfriend who is a huge meat eater and we both loved it.  I added a bit more of the cayanne peper to spice it up more and put soy sour cream(tofuti brand) on top and stired it in (after it was in the bowl and almost ready to be eaten) to make it creamier.  It is sure to satisfy and I will make it a lot.  Great recipe.

Filling and healthy! A couple changes: Chili isn't chili w/o Cumin-I added 1 Tbsp. I used a smaller can of corn and there was plenty. It was a bit too thick so I added about a cup of chicken stock. So good!

Looks beautiful! I took a picture of it while it was cooking because it was so colorful. And has brilliant taste.  A wonderfully attractive low calory dinner that tastes as beautiful as it looks. And is super easy to make.

Very good veggie chili.  I altered it a bit to make sure it wouldn't be too spicy for my 9yo.  He loved this chili!  I used only 1/2 jalapeno, omitted the cayenne pepper, and used regular kidney beans (drained) instead of the spicy chili beans.  Since I don't care for canned corn, I substituted frozen.  I also added a little more chili powder too because 1 tbsp just didn't seem enough.

Love this recipe! My partner is allergic to beans, so we joke and call it "vegetarian chili with meat". I substitute ground turkey and a few extra veggies for the beans. It has fantastic flavor, is simple to make, and saves well. I make this at least once a month. And because it is pretty healthy, I can make my heart attack cornbread to go with it... I really should get that recipe on here...

We've tried this a couple of times and absolutely loved it.  Last night I made it again and changed a few things and we loved it even more.  If I could've given it more than 5 I would!  No zucchini, (don't like it) and I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of the crushed.  I also added carrots, celery, parsley, an extra tbsp of chili powder, veggie bouillon cubes, 1 tsp coriander, 1 tsp cumin, 2 cups water and,  believe it or not, 12 oz light beer.  It was absolutely great.  The only thing I will say about this is, that even with the beer and the extra water, it is incredibly thick, which is we really like, but I always cook it in a crockpot instead of on the stove.  I would think it could tend to stick if cooked on the stove and not watched very carefully.

This chili is so delish! I served it to a group of my friends and our kids after an afternoon at the pumpkin farm. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds and thirds! I've always wanted a go-to chili recipe and this will definitely be it. The slight crunch of veggies, perfect amount of spice and richness of tomato make this chili so comforting. The only change I made was adding ground turkey, which I browned and added in with the beans. I will make this for many tailgates and fall meals to come!

Changed things a bit.  Used one lb of ground beef and two leftover brats chopped up, omitted the corn and jalapeno, and just used red beans.  Spices used were 1 tbsp of hot chili powder, 1/2 tsp of cumin, oregano, black pepper, and paprika and one tsp of chipotle seasoning.  Great combination of flavors.

Great easy recipe, my hubby and I love veggies so added extra of all and also added mushrooms for a "meaty" quality and garbanzo beans too. I up the flavors with extra chili powder to taste and some cumin. My husband always raves about this dish and can't wait to eat the leftovers ??

This recipe is the best veggie chili hands down I have  made. The only substitution I made was. I did not know what the canned chili in spicy sauce was so I used a can of Trader Joes organic veggie chili. Recipe came out awesome. No one missed the meat.

I used chili beans in medium sauce and cut back on the cayenne, but this was still a bit too much on the spicy side for us.  I would need to reduce the jalapeno also I think to make this better.  But, I also feel that this recipe gets most of its flavor from the heat; there was not much else exciting going on with it other than that.  I think I will stick with my regular chili recipe.

Really good!  I may have added a bit too much of the spice cause it was quite hot.  The colors were all so pretty and it was yummy.  I'll make again and can't wait to enjoy the leftovers this week.

Very tasty, fills you up and keeps you full with so few calories. I added ground beef to mine and topped it with fresh cornbread. It was the perfect Friday movie night meal!

Great recipe! Although a little bland alone  I added a few extras... I topped it off with reduced fat sour cream, cheddar, and saltines. Which made it wayyyy better.

I made this chili for my boyfriend for his birthday...and it was fantastic!  I added ground turkey and green chillis instead of jalepenos.  I think next time I'll try to make it more spicy...but it was wonderful regardless.

the chili was good but not very spicy... i added extra chili powder and 1/2 cup medium salsa as well as some sliced mushrooms and carrots.  it was great with cheese on top and cornbread on the side.  next time i'll use hot salsa and more spices.  also instead of boiling and simmering one hour i cooked it on low heat for about 5 hours and the flavors really popped!

I needed recipe for zucchini and yellow squash from my garden.  I used salsa and one can black beans and left out the peppers and spices.  Simmered in crock pot.  Had a good kick to it.  Very tasty as a side dish.

I added an orange pepper and an extra can of black beans.  Also, my husband needs meat, so I also added a pound of ground beef.  It was so flavorful and filling.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This is my go to chili recipe. I add carrots, green chilies and other veggies when the mood strikes. Usually freeze half and not only does it freeze beautifully it tastes great at a later date.

This has been my favorite chili recipe lately. It's got lots of veggies perfect for the vegetarians out there, especially if you don't want to use meat substitutes. Most other chili recipes have some kind of meat substitute in them.

I have made this chili multiple times, and my meat-loving husband even loves it too!  We add extra jalapeños for some spice, and double almost all the veggies. It is now a winter staple in our house.

I really like all the veggies in the chili, especially the Jalapeño. But something was off.  I think it was the tomato paste that I didn't like in it.

This review is more so to remind how I tweaked this recipe. I've made this recipe And It's great as is but my husband wanted something with a little more protein for his road biking energy and I like this one so much I use it as my base. My modifications were 1 lb ground Turkey, 14oz can of diced petite tomatoes, Enough chicken broth to keep it slightly liquidy, Frozen corn, 2TBS chili powder, can of plain beans instead of spicy chili.

Really yummy!  Only thing I would do is increase the chili powder, but that's just my personal preference.  My 16-month old gobbled this up too!

Very good.  I added cumin.  I may exchange corn for hominy or forgo grain altogether.  I will definitely skip the tomato paste next round but found it very fresh and flavorful and just spicy enough.

My husband and I are not Vegans, but had been on a voluntary "fast" with our church that had us eating only foods eaten by Vegans, with a few more restrictions. I found this recipe and we both really liked it. Be warned, it is SPICY, but really good. The next time I'd probably cut some of the ingredients that make it so hot, since my kids couldn't eat it, but other than that it's great. I actually served it over brown rice.

I'm sorry, but we did not like this recipe.  Too much tomato, and didn't think the flavor was particularly good.
