I made this for a work pot luck and it came out wonderful.  I followed the recipe to a T, but I also garnished the top with dollops of whipped cream and then sliced up 2 Almond Joy candy bars and placed those in between the dollops of cream.  It looked and tasted beautiful!!

Was a knockout at a birthday party i took it too last night!!  However, I had some difficulty with making it (i'm sure due to my inexperience)I tried this out last night....my cake did crack so i should have put a pan of water in the oven.  I had to cook longer than stated and worried if I took it out too soon, so put it back in cause it didn't seem set.(then it kind of sunk).  But, it tasted WOMDERFUL, everyone wanted the recipe and they commented how "professional it looked).  i filled in the crack with sour cream (sine I used all my cream cheese) and it worked like a charm.  Wished I would have added some vanilla bean to the cream cheese.  definitely a keeper.

This was one of three cheesecakes I made for my boyfriend for his birthday, and it was the BIGGEST hit! I loved it and I do not like cheesecake at all!!!  It was an easy recipe to follow even for a cheesecake novice.

Very easy to make and very pretty.  I think I would like more coconut either in the cheesecake or in the glaze.  But all in all it was a good recipe
