Loved these. Made them for a tailgate and they were a big hit with the college crowd.  They held together well.  Crispy on the outside and chewy chocolate on the inside. I cheated and used egg whites from a carton- no problem. I thought they tasted better on the day after I made them.

These cookies were pretty good although they were a bit sticky and even stuck to the parchment paper I baked them on. I also had to add some water because the dough was very thick. I would make these again with minor adjustments. I loved that these cookies did not become flat after baking!

I've made these cookies a handful of times for my friends with Celiac or gluten allergies and they're always a hit! Super easy. From my experience, I usually need 3 egg whites from large eggs. I leave out the chocolate chips, refrigerate overnight, then knead in the chocolate chips while dough is cold. I usually roll by hand (which is super messy!!) into walnut sized balls and bake for ten minutes. I leave them on the sheet to cool for a few minutes to allow them to firm up then transfer to a cooling rack. Don't skimp on the chocolate chips, they help make them gooey on the inside!!

I made these for a friend who said he missed the flourless chocolate cookies from Starbucks.  Very easy to make, and delicious.  Every time he would take another cookie,  he would OMG.  He told me they could be dangerous for him.  Mission accomplished,  highly recommend this recipe.

These cookies were so good!   I did change the recipe a bit in that I added three tablespoons of butter and about a half teaspoon of salt and used one cup of milk chocolate chips and  a half cup of white chocolate chips.    They definitely needed to bake for 14 minutes in my oven.     When I make them again, I will be adding walnuts or pecans.

Really good, chocolatey and like meringue. But use a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon to drop onto cookie sheet if you want guest-sized cookies. They spread out while baking.

These are incredible! They remind me of the edges of a brownie, very chewy and delicious! I did add one extra egg white to the batter and chose to add walnuts to half the batter. I baked them for 14 minutes and they came out perfect! I loved that I had all of the ingredients on hand. So simple and so easy. I've already recommended them to my friend with Celiac's Disease. She's super excited to try them for herself! Thank you for sharing :)

This is it. My favorite cookie. Rich, chocolatey, crisp, and chewy. Always gone in an hour or two.

I followed the directions and was afraid that it would be too thin but noticed that after it sat a few minutes it thickened up.

Only thing I changed was 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I tried it with one tablespoon and they we not as soft. I also needed 4 egg whites probably because I used less liquid due to decreasing the vanilla.

Makes you wonder why cookies even need flour... These were decedant and scrumptious.  You gotta love chocolate to love these...

These were pretty good and easy. They were more meringue-like than I expected. Definitely chewy and I liked the crunch on the outside. I added little milk instead of an additional egg white to thin it because I only had 2 egg whites. I did refrigerate the batter before baking as suggested and had no problems with sticking.
