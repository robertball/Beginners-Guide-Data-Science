This is an excellent recipe. The light bodied rice noodles are made for this. I used the Thai“extra wide” type noodle which also makes for a nice presentation. I used “hot” sesame oil but will also add hot chilies the next time I make this for extra “bite”. All of the different ingredients in the marinade blend nicely and provide a very unique taste. Leftovers microwave nicely.

This was really yummy!  I made a few changes though:  I used a whole bag of frozen "stir-fry veggies" instead of just snow peas, didn't use any cilantro, and used chow mein noodles instead of rice noodles.  There was plenty of sauce left over (I ended up throwing some away as I didn't want the noodles too wet) even though it was really good.

Overall this recipe was good. I made some modifications like other reviewers had suggested - I increased the peanut butter from 2T to 3T, and I doubled the marinade and used the extra for sauce. I only had linguini noodles on hand, but they were very good with it. My biggest complaint is that it seemed too oily and the vinegar was quite strong. I think in the future I may decrease or eliminate the oil and cut the vinegar in half.

I made this for my family and they loved it (much more than more complicated noodle recipies in the past!)  I doubled the merinade, placed all the chicken in the sauce and then drained and reserved all merinade when ready to cook. I cooked the merinade on the stove and then tossed into the wok with presoaked rice noodles. Will make again.

My boyfriend is really picky, and we both loved this!  I only had linguine noodles, but they worked well.  I quintupled the amound of chili flakes and used fresh ginger.  I added water chestnuts, reb bell pepper, and scallions.  Also, lime and cilantro make it divine!

One of my boyfriend's favourite dishes. I never include snow peas, cilantro, rice vinegar, or honey, because I think the combination of the rest of the ingredients tastes good enough. Instead, I just add 2 tablespoons of Splenda and some extra chili flakes because I love a bit of spice. I also use crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth.

I added red peppers, scallions, chopped cashews and used a bad mix from the produce section that included snow peas, carrots and broccoli.  I also used fettuccine broken in half instead of Asian noodles.  DELICIOUS! Great sauce...

tasty but the directions aren't clear enough. "mix marinade ingredients" - well what are the marinade ingredients? Had to read through couple of times before I understood. Minor point though.

This is awesome. Absolutely awesome.  I added some sliced mushrooms, that's the only change I made.  Even my husband who refuses to eat anything remotely Asian liked it and said I needed to make it again soon.  Thanks!!

This dish was awesome. I made it for my family Sunday dinner, along with some spicy grilled shrimp, and it made an excellent side dish. I couldn't find Asian noodles, so I made it with linguine instead. I added a little more than the recipe called for in the marinade, but it all turned out great! I doubled the amount of garlic used, and I also added some shallots. The cilantro added an amazing touch to this perfect dish. Will defiantly make again and again.

You really need to double up on the sauce for this one!  I did and it was a perfect amount.  I used soba noodles and fresh ginger instead of the ground.  Also added in some red bell pepper and topped with green onions.  Loved this!

This was quick and delicious but I too did not throw away the marinade. I just added it to the wok and let it cook. I also threw in a few more vegies to make it more of a complete meal. My crew loved this!

Made as directed and even my non pasta loving husband liked this one.  I love cilantro so next time I'll add a little more.  I only added enough marinade to coat the chicken so I could have enough for the pasta.  It actually could use a little more sauce.

I have been craving Thai and this recipe sure did satisfy my craving!  I loved the marinade; the only change I made was I left out the fresh cilantro (didn’t have any).  The flavors really seemed to meld perfectly together!

This was amazing!! Fabulous!! I doubled the sauce/marinade per the earlier raters, and I added julienned carrots along with the snow peas to the pasta water. I used Thai rice noodles. I will definitely make this many times. Thanks!!

Wow, very good!  Easy to prepare, and a nice blend of flavours.  I only used 2 Tbsp canola oil (all i had) but just added some sesame seeds to the marinade.  Also added some very thinly sliced carrots and green bell pepper for more vegetables, and tossed it with whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  It all came out very delicious.  My husband agrees!

This was good, and really fast to make.  The most time-consuming part was the marinade, which I did 2 hours before dinner.  I cooked the chicken in all the marinade (what's that business about throwing it away- madness!) and steamed the snow peas separately (for about 45 seconds).  I mixed the chicken, sauce, noodles and snow peas all together (used a little less noodles) in a large skillet and served from the skillet as well.  I didn't bother to rinse the noodles/peas.  There was just enough sauce.  I liked the fresh flavor the snow peas and cilantro added.  I used Japanese soba noodles because I had them on hand.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I slightly reduced the vegetable oil and will probably reduce it even more next time.  I increased the soy sauce, ginger, and crushed pepper and added steamed zucchini and topped with a raw shredded mixture of broccoli, carrots, and cabbage for some added crunch.

LOVE this recipe.  I have made it twice already, and it has been a hit!
I added more snap peas, and doubled the dressing like some other posters suggested.

I made this last night that it was a hit with the family.  'A Keeper' as my husband puts it.  I followed advise from others and made a bit more sauce.  I also had a tube of the ground lemongrass - Gourmet Garden Brand (found in the produce section in the tubes) I squeezed a bit of that into the marinade.  Turned out great!

Pretty easy to make - makes a lot! Served 4 adults for dinner and I made up two lunches with the leftovers.

I doubled the marinade as well, which turned out to be perfect. I will make this again!!!

Very tasty and easy to make, but not at all filling. My husband and I both had growling stomachs just a couple of hours after eating this. Next time we'll add some stir-fry veggies and maybe substitute the chicken for tofu. We loved the sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Like other reviewers I doubled the sauce and might even triple it next time.  I added a lot more red pepper flakes because we like it hot, and also added shredded cabbage with the snow peas.  I prepared a little differently:  1)  Prepare noodles, 2) stir fry marinated chicken (I only used about 1/5 of the sauce to marinate and reserved the rest), once chicken was browned on outside I 3) added snow peas & cabbage and cooked a few minutes longer.  4)  Then I added the noodles and all the rest of the reserved sauce and cooked until heated through.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great dish!  It didn't take a lot of time, & it isn't heavy at all.  The only change I would make next time would be to set aside a bit more marinade for the dressing.  The marinade is excellent!  I will definitely use it in other ways.... a great find!  Thanks!

This was ok. I thought there was way too much rice vinegar though. I halved the recipe but kept the marinade/sauce amount the same. If I were to make it again - which I doubt; there are better Thai noodle recipes - I would add more veggies. Thanks anyway.

Excellent!  I as well, changed the amount of sauce and cut back on the rice vinegar.  I also used precooked chicken and reheated it with the sauce in the pan to coat it as I was very short on time.  This one definately makes the rotation!
