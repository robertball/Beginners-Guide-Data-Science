I didn't use sugar-free preserves so I omitted teh splenda. Next time I will add a bit more horseradish & jalapeno to get a little more bite. We both loved this! The raspberry flavor really complements both the cocktail sauce & the shrimp. I strted off our Valentine's dinner w/ Chambord Spritzers, Deep Fried Camembert w/ Raspberry sauce (from allrecipes) served w/ apple slices. Then for dinner, we had this recipe (served in martini glasses on  little beds of frisee lettuce) Lobster de Jonghe & white wine steamed asparagus w/ Chocolate Cherry Heart Cakes for dessert.  It was a fabulous dinner...very fitting for the holiday.
