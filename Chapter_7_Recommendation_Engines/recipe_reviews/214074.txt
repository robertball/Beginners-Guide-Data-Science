Move over, because this is not your mother's Seabreeze.  This tangy, light drink will have you wishing all year was pool weather but great any time of year.  I love the combination of all the fruit flavors.  Now where is my pear vodka???

WOW. This is amazing!! I was hesitant at first because of all the all of the alcohol, but this IS a martini style drink, so it makes perfect sense!! I am going to be making these again very soon! Thanks for the recipe :)

Breathtaking Indeed!  My first clue should've been only 3 ratings in 3 years. Seemed like too much booze per drink, but made it anyway. Here's the numbers: each person is drinking 3 ounces of hooch to 2 ounces + one tbsp of juice per serving. Why waste the juice - just do shooters. Congrats to all of you out there that were sensible enough to skip this idea.
