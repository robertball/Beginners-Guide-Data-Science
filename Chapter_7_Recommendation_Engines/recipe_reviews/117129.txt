Loved this recipe!  Used small grape tomatoes halved, english cucumbers peeled and seeded and minced 1/4 cup of the red onion, which I think made all the difference as the pieces were not so large that the flavor was overpowering.  Added fresh cracked black pepper and 1/2 container of Feta cheese based on other reviews.  Absolutely wonderful and definitely a staple for summertime BBQ's.

Added feta cheese and walnuts. Used the little mini plum tomatoes. Made the balsamic vinaigrette recipe from this site to top this salad. Everyone absolutely loved this dish!!

This is a fantastic recipe! I just boiled the asparagus for a smaller amoung of time because I like mine to stay a little crispier. Added some fresh mozzarella cheese and a bit of sauted garlic. Thank you for a staple warm weather recipe :)

What a delicious, fresh, healthy salad idea! I wouldn't steam the asparagus quite so long next time... probably 4 minutes would've done the trick for me.

VERY Good! I am not a huge fan of Balsamic and only used half of what was called for but a very good, refreshing salad! Thanks!

OK, so I used this recipe as a base and then changed quite a bit after looking at other tomato salad recipes. I used small vine tomato and quartered them. I used fresh ingredients from my garden with fresh basil, oregano, parsley, green onions, chives, and fresh diced garlic. I made the balsamic vinaigrette on this website instead of bottled. I used fresh ground pepper and sea salt also and mixed everything up and topped it with about 1/4 c. feta cheese. I took this to a picnic and everyone raved about it. The fresh raw asparagus tasted like fresh peas and the freshness of the salad was really attractive and so healthy.

I have made this a couple times, and its best to wait to add the balsamic right before serving this. I also like to add cucumbers. I might try adding basil next time. Its the perfect summer salad (sans pasta)!

I make a version of this and it's always a hit. I quickly sautee the asparagus in olive oil with a generous sprinkling of garlic salt. While still crisp, I wrap in a towel and cool it down in the freezer for a few minutes. Lke others I use halved grape tomatoes. But the real success is in presentation. I pile the tomatoes in the center of a pasta bowl and ring the apsparagus around the tomatoes. Then I make a 3rd ring of crumbled cheese - feta is fine but I usually use blue. I sprinkle the whole salad with toasted pine nuts and chill. Just before serving,  drizzle with a high quality white balsamic.  Cool and crisp.

I made this primarily to use up some asparagus and it turned out to be a good find. I used cherry tomatoes and only steamed the asparagus for 3-4 minutes as I like it fairly crisp. For the vinaigrette I made Simple Sicilian Salad Dressing from this site. Thankyou Lois.

Lovely summer salad.  I grilled the asparagus on the bbq, gives a nice caramelized flavour.  I made my own vinaigrette, very tasty.  I also cut way down on the onion, didn't want it to overpower the other flavours and added a touch of salt.

Pretty simple and tasty. I used cherry tomatoes and added some other veggies I had on hand. A great way to use all the great seasonal asparagus on the market.

This is very quickly becoming one of my favorite summer salads! I've made it 3 times this week (twice for family and once for a company picnic.)  Based on review of others - I dropped my steaming time to 4-5 minutes, depending on the ripeness of the aspargus.  Had some extra cucumbers that were getting ready to go bad, so I threw them in, too.  Very nice!  This is a keeper!

So good. We don't do raw onion, so I skipped that and added some garlic powder. Also seasoned of cracked black pepper and salt. Great side dish. Thanks :)

I love this salad!  I did steam the asparagus until just crisp tender rather than boil.  Also used only half the dressing called for.  Also used a Lite Balsamic dressing.  Great fresh simple recipe.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and used balsamic vinaigrette from this site as suggested by another reviewer.  Loved the asparagus and tomatoes but feel there is a better dressing out there somewhere.  If I try this again it will be with a different dressing.

Good combination of tomatoes with asparagus, but I made a vinaigrette (balsamic vinegar, olive oil, minced garlic and basil)to go with it.  Basil really brings out the flavor of the tomatoes.
