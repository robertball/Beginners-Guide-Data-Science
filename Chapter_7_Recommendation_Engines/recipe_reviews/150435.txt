Excellent in terms of time (it's quick!!), taste needed some work.  Here's what I did: instead of saucepan, I used a deep skillet for preperation.  I sauteed the tuna in melted butter and seasoned w salt and pepper. After adding the milk & cheese, I seasoned the whole thing with garlic salt. For the garnish (to add some crunch)I put some Ritz crackers in a sandwich bag and crushed them (just a bit) then added about 1/2 c shredded cheese, shook it up and spread it on top. Put the pan in the oven on broil for about 1 minute--made it more casserole-y.  Tasted better the next day!

This is one of those dishes that I grew up on (thanks to my best friends mom - which cooked everything like this). Anyhow - 5 Stars for easy peasy and 5 stars for taste! Also - she really never used cheddar but just used sliced cheese; still delish!

Kinda' on the fence with this one.  We ate it, but there was something missing.  I kept adding stuff (not worth mentioning) but just didn't quite do it for us.

Great base/starter recipe.  I thought Id rate this to inform people of easy alterations. I improvised by cooking 1 1/2 c rice 3 c water in my rice cooker. I lowered the milk to only half a soup can since I was cooking the rice. I used one can of peas instead of frozen (I'm sure most frozen or canned veggies would be great) and I added some seasoning and used sour cream and onion potato chips. So if you have to improvise this is a great recipe. P.s I think I'll try it with pasta next time.

Agree this is great base recipe. One of those nights where I had nothing planned and not much in the pantry/fridge.  Cooked regular white rice. Then mixed in white tuna, the mushroom soup, milk, sliced fresh mushrooms, some garlic, onion, salt and pepper.  Melted reduced fat colby cheese on top (less than a cup, though). My kids don't like peas and I left off the fried onions/chips to keep it low fat. Served with green beans on the side. Both kids loved it and said to please make it again!!

Yum!  This was deceptively delicious.  Reminds me of tuna casserole, but so much quicker.  We added some onions, about 1/3 cup.  Such an easy weeknight meal.

This was really good and so easy to make. I think I still prefer egg noodles but this was really good. I only used 1 1/2 cups rice to match the 1 1/2 cups milk and the rice cooked perfectly. I would make this again!

This was pretty good. I did add some dill, seasoning salt and some garlic salt to the mix. I have a two year old so I crushed up some cheddar goldfish crackers for the topping and it was pretty good. That was the first time I got my toddler to eat tuna.

After reading the reviews about this dish being bland I decided to make it with a few adjustments. I cooked it with egg noodles instead of rice, I used broccoli instead of peas and I added onion. It was delicious!!!!

I have been down sick all week so I wanted something easy for the family. PS never cook if you can't taste your food before serving. I think I used too much milk because I opted for egg noodles instead of rice. Husband ate it but said it was lacking flavor. I loved how easy it was but I think adding some seasoning to it may be the trick to a more star rating. Thanks for the recipe.

Used brown minute rice instead of white. Directions to make are exactly the same but it did not get cooked so I added some water and a lot more time. Very bland.

I love this. Very classic tuna casserole flavor not alot of work to get it. Good balance of flavors and really only takes about 15 minutes which is great for those nights when that's all you have and haven't even started to think about what to have. We tried it with the potato chips and I love what that brings to it so probably won't be trying it with the fried onions but that could be good as well.

I did this exactly as the recipe suggested. Came out good however very dry. I think adding the cheese into the blend my have caused this. I would try put it on top next time and adding a little more milk.

This dish was good for a quick and easy meal. I made this on a night where we had just enough time for my husband to get home from work, eat, and then for us to make it to baseball practice.
I did make a few changes. I used cream of chicken, just because I don't like cream of mushroom; and I also used pasta because I had some leftover in the fridge that needed to be used, and I added shredded carrots.
If I make it again, I would do two large cans of tuna instead of the 2 small 5 oz cans. I would also go light on the peas. Our boys refused to even try it because of the peas, even though we told them that you can't even taste them.

Both my  Grandma and Mom made  tuna casseroles similar to this one, and I used to make it for my kids when they were younger. I had forgotten how quick and easy this recipe was.  Because there was more rice than liquid it was quite dry, so after it was cooked I added more milk. It was also more bland than I remember it, so I added some onion and garlic salt, parsley, and a dash of pepper. Next time I will either reduce the amount of rice to 1 1/2 cups, or increase the milk to 2 cups, and season the soup/milk/tuna mixture to taste before adding the rice.  We garnished it with shredded cheese and crushed potato chips. Overall, it was a good recipe that we will make again.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! Just what I needed on a busy work day. I changed the recipe up a bit by baking it with cheese and cracker crumbs on top after cooking it on the stove. It made a world of difference! Definitely will make this again!

This was definitely very easy to make which was a plus on a weekday! However I do agree, this dish was missing something. It was good, don't get me wrong but it definitely could have used something else. Some sort of seasoning maybe? It was kind of bland. That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars.

This is great base to work from. It didn't sound very flavorful and after reading the reviews my thoughts were confirmed. I added garlic and onion powder and used sharp cheddar. I had left over rice so didn't need to use instant. I also cooked it in the oven after mixing everything. I give this three stars but my additions bumped it up a star.

This didn't taste bad, it was more about texture and presentation where it lost me. Tuna along with the rice in the sauce just made mush. I think it would be better with pasta instead of rice. It was difficult to serve, because it really was mushy.

Everything was fine until I let it cool off to put in containers.  At that point it had hardened up and dried out. It tastes great and I would make it again but would add at least another can of soup.

I found and used this recipe because I was trying to use leftover leftover ingredients that I had in my house and it turned out pretty good! - I used mixed vegetables instead of just peas (because I didn't have any on hand). -I added dried chopped onions, garlic salt, garlic powder and pepper to give it flavor.  Quick and easy meal!  Only four stars because of the additions I had to make.
