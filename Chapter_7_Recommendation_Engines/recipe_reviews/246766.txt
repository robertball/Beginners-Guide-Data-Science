2.16.19  The flavor is chocolate-y, fudg-y, and indulgent, but they really break down pretty well nutritionally.  I scaled this recipe down to 12 servings, and since I wanted portion control, I baked in my mini bundt muffin pan for 18 minutes at 350º.  Garnished with a dollop of chocolate whipped cream and Fragola Pazzo strawberries, a recipe from this site.  They baked up beautifully, and they do have a bit of brownie flavor to them.  dutchgirl, some times good things happen, even when you realize you’ve screwed up the recipe, and this is one of them.
