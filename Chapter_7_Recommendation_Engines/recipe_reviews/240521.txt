In my best devilish and descriptive tone on how I feel about these cookies......Austin Powers "yeahhhh bae-bee!!" geez I'm in love! While I followed everything to a T 42 portions in this dough are too big & after about 4 hours in the fridge still slightly sticky (use a little extra flour to douse each portion when wrapping the candies in them). That's the only negative thing I have to say about it. Other then that I bought 2 (8.5oz) bags of Andes Mint Chocolate candy to make sure I had enough as the recipe stated however I thought I was even being liberal with the dough making sure the cookies were perfectly wrapped as possible. My dough worked out giving me 56 little cookies and still had plenty of leftover candies from the 2nd bag I bought to make the drizzle with. I found that next day the cookies were still crisp but not hard bricks and that's a plus in my book. I will note that if you don't drizzle the cookies you can pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds to have the centers extra gooey and become a mint cookie addict. I will be making these again at St. Patrick's Day and at Christmas because they sure are worth being a repeat offender in my house. TY so much. Another added note is when I melted the leftover chocolate mint candies it seizes in the melting process so add a tsp of shortening to loosen it up or a little more if needed to drizzle beautiful trails of minty goodness over the top.

I found the dough was easier to manage when it was patted into place rather than pushing it around the candy. When I tried to push and smoosh it around the candy it would stick to my hands even after chilling. I took 1 T of dough divided it in half and pressed them to the top and bottom of the candy tapping and patting the dough evenly around so that no candy was visible Once I got that figured out it was a breeze. They came out wonderfully.

I made this recipe two years ago at Christmas time with my special needs class of middle schoolers. They are easy to make and are delicious! My middle schoolers weren't excited about peppermint cookies but the staff were so the cookies didn't last long!
