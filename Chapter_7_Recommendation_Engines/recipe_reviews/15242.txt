I made this one with whole wheat pasta and it tasted great. I cut the amount of pasta in half and used 9 oz of fresh spinach. I didn't boil my spinach; instead I sauteed it with the garlic and red pepper flakes. The only other change I made is adding freshly grated parmesan cheese on top. I will make this again.

I rated this recipe a 5 for it's ease in preparation and fabulous flavor. I made some mild variations. I used whole wheat penne pasta instead of the shells. I also added 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes when I added the cooked pasta and spinach to the skillet. Thanks for the great and simple recipe Yakuta!

Pretty good but needs additions.. good starting recipe. I used rotini instead of shells and added to the garlic mixture: onion, green pepper, diced tomatoes, black olives, & fresh basil. I also added Parmesan to the finished product... very good.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I used 3/4 bag of fresh spinach instead of the frozen kind and found out that I should have used the whole bag.  I added some Italian sausage, tbsp butter, and a few shakes of grated parmesan cheese to it.  It looks like it will taste bland but it wasn't bad.  My husband liked it and he's a pretty picky eater.

Quite easy to make, loved the roasted garlic! I think next time I will try using a different type of noodle, the spinach tended to clump into the shell   pasta. I added some parm for more flavor---tastes even better a few days after!

Edited to add: Just made this again and the red pepper flakes really add great (and neccesary) flavor, as well as crumbled feta. So easy and cheap to make!

I was cruising the site today trying to find recipes for my daughter. This was perfect with the exception of the red pepper flakes and the type of pasta. I used pastina and even had some myself. So good with a splash on parm on top. Thank you!!

A solid four star - good hearty dinner. I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, added mushrooms, sauteed an onion along with the garlic and used chili powder instead of pepper flakes. I warned my boyfriend about the spice factor - he laughed in my face and jacked up his plate with red pepper flakes.

To prepare my spinach, I cooked up half a sweet onion in a frying pan with olive oil, then added garlic, then wilted a pound of fresh spinach. I then drained out the excess liquid. Then I tossed this mixture with the pasta, egg mixture, and bread crumbs (I used parmesan herb panko), and proceeded with the recipe as described. I cooked it covered except for the last 15 minutes so that the cheese wouldn't burn. My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much.

Great basic recipe.  I definitely added parmesan to finish it off and it was great.  Next time I'm going to try to add more veggies like asparagus and mushrooms!

Good, but definitely needs some feta cheese on top. Plus, I steamed the spinach for 3 mins after the garlic (with a lid on top). That will keep the nutrients from disapearing when you drain the boiled water.

Made this tonight as a side dish with fish.  Very easy and yummy too!  I didn't change a thing (except to use whole wheat penne pasta), and I will make this again.  I love spinach and am trying to find more recipes that use it.  Thanks for this one!

Not very flavorful. I added lots of extra oil, since it was dry.  But it still tasted weird.  My kids wouldn't eat it at all.  Will not make again.

Yummy! I had a bag of frozen spinach in the freezer and thought I'd search an easy and tasty recipe. I found it here. I used penne instead of shell, because that was what was in my pantry, and I also added a can of diced tomatoes, for taste and color. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was wonderful!

My kids loved this.  I doubled the red pepper. As someone else had suggested, I sautéed the garlic, red pepper and frozen spinach (I defrosted in microwave first).  When the pasta was done cooking, I drained, added to the pan and then added the parmesan.  Simple but super yummy!

What a dissapointment! Thought this was going to be good, after reading a few reviews that had given it to their kids...But it's way too spicy for my 6 & 10 year old to eat!  It's even a little too spicy for me.  I added Parmesan and Romano cheese to it because I felt it was a little bland. Maybe I should have used cayenne pepper instead :(  Had to throw it out.

Great recipe to use for a jump start!  I cut back just a bit on the garlic and added some ricotta cheese.  So yummy.  I also cut back on the red pepper flakes, a little goes a long way with that spice!

This is a keeper.  My family loved it.  Use fresh spinach.  It's not much harder to wash it in a salad spinner and chop it up a little and you gain all the vitamins and freshness.  hmm... I think I might like to make it again tonight....  topped with parmesan cheese.

This recipe was easy to make!  I used red pepper powder instead of red pepper flakes cause my family is not big on spice and seemed to do the trick. I also added shrimp and tomatoes! Its not very flavorful, but its a healthy meal that is satisfying.

This was pretty good.  I made a few changes.  I used rotini pasta instead of shells.  I added smoked sausage to make it more of an all-in-one meal.  I threw in a can of drained diced tomatoes, and topped it all off with a hand full of blended Italian cheeses.  It still seems like something is missing though.  I will try this one again after I figure out what it needs.  Very filling!

Good recipe, very simple and tastey. I added some chopped bell pepper to the garlic to give it a little more body. Was going to add some ragu, but decided it didn't need it. Used fresh spinach from the garden. A great, lunch and ready in 5 minutes.

I made a combination of the original recipe with the recommendations of others and a little extra of my own and it turned out pretty tasty. I made the pasta and drained it. Added a tweak of butter and set aside. On a frying pan I put some oil and sauteed some onion with 3 tbsp of red pepper flakes, then I added the garlic and then the chopped fresh spinach and since I wanted it to have some ¨body¨ I added about 1/4 cup milk to steam the spinach and a dollop of sour cream. At last, I roughly chopped fresh tomatoes and added them to the mixture. Boiled for 2 mins and voilá! It looked yummy and didn´t dissapoint, I served with garlic bread. I would make this again.

I tried this recipe the other night. It was good. I added a few things. I added sausage and some peppers. My family loved it and it made plenty of left overs. Definately something I will make again.

I made this this evening. It was good, but I wouldn't say great. It was more of a starter recipe that you may want to improve on your own. I made it like the recipe said. Too much garlic for our taste, and it was bland. So, I made it a second time tonight and here's what I did. I left out the garlic and cooked the spinach (bag of frozen, thawed and drained) in butter and heavy cream, I added season all, salt and pepper. I cooked the noodles, drained them, put them back in the pot they cooked in (off the burner), then added the spinach, some more butter, salt and pepper, and Parmesan cheese (quite a bit), and stirred often to break up the spinach. Cooking the spinach in butter and then adding some at the end really helped break up the spinach and stopped it from clumping. Turned out really good then.

Quick and simple pasta dish.  I used brown rice pasta shells and one bag of fresh spinach.  I sauteed the spinach with the seasoning and then added it to the drained and seasoned shells. For sides we had steamed broccoli and Italian bread.

This was very delicious!  I did as some other reviewers recommended and cooked spinach with garlic and oil.  I also added parmesan cheese and it came out perfect.  The red pepper flakes do add a little bit to it.

This dish was unbelievable! It was just simply delicious! My kids are picky eaters. They are not fans of pasta. 
They devour it! I just added some fresh broccoli as it boiled with the spinach and pasta. This is a five star! Do 
Not pass this dish it is a must have.

This turned out great and was even better after sitting in the fridge and eating it the next day as leftovers!  I added a bit of heavy cream to make the sauce a bit more creamier.

It was very good. I used garlic/basil linguini pasta. I think I'll use less red pepper next time and more garlic, but I really like garlic. Thanks for posting this recipe. It was quick and easy.

just made this about an hour ago actually! on the plus side, it was fast and easy to make. unfortunately it was a little too bland for my tastes, so i added parmesean cheese and cut up some ham. PARMESEAN MAKES A DIFFERENCE! i served this to my parents, and they said it was pretty good. not the best, but it's a quick and good meal.

This was really easy and really good. I thought 7 cloves of garlic seemed like a lot--but it wasn't. I used a little less than 1/2 lb of pasta and threw a tomato in at the end. Really good and simple.

I added an extra tsp of garlic and doubled or tripled the chili flakes, but I like my food spicy.  This is a delicious, easy to make dish that is satisfying.

This was surprisingly delicious and flavorful. I used Penzey’s Cajun seasoning blend instead of the red pepper flakes, 16 oz of frozen chopped spinach and a different pasta. Added a few grape tomatoes in at the end also. Really yummy !

I added some shrimp to the garlic and sauteed those together for some protein. I put in about three times as much red pepper flakes as recommended because several people in the family (ie. everyone but me)  likes the spicy hot taste.  It was a big hit! My husband seldom eats leftovers, but went right for this the next day for lunch!

Tasty and easy to make! I used gluten free Le Veneziane pasta instead (I have Celiac). I also added a few spoonfuls of light sour cream and light cream cheese to the mix, extra garlic, and a generous splash of Garlic Expressions Classic Vinaigrette Salad Dressing & Marinade for a sweet-tangy-savory kick. It really upped the flavor level. I used left over sauteed spinach from my steak dinner the other night, and I boiled my pasta with the extra garlic and the red pepper flakes to infuse it with flavor. Great recipe, even without my changes!

I doubled the recipe, except I used only 16 oz of frozen chopped spinach and approximately 5 cloves of garlic. I didn't want the spinach to get soggy, so I added it to the pasta during the last minute of boiling. This was a huge hit in my home (my oldest son wished it was saucy, so he wasn't a fan, but my two younger sons wanted seconds). The spice from the red pepper was not overwhelming and added some great flavor. Very good simple recipe!

After seeing this posted on my spiner app I had to try it. As any good cook will tell you. You start off reading the entire thing then you make changes that suits the family. My family loves sea food so shrimp went in. and lots of spinach (that has a way of hiding).  And I am also feeding 5 people (hoping for leftovers for lunch the next day) so lots of pasta. It was very good have to add this to the make again list.

This recipe is very similar to a recipe of my own the difference is this has spinach and mine has parmesan, so I left the spinach in and added a cup of fresh grated parmesan and served it with more parmesan sprinkled on top with no red pepper and used butter rather than olive oil. It was awesome.

I had leftover, buttered shell noodles that I wanted to revamp and this recipe was perfect! I did not have spinach, so I used cooked broccoli and chopped it up really small in a food processor. I simply added the leftover noodles at the same time as the recipe indicates. While most of my kids prefer the plain noodles, my daughter loved these. Perfect amount of spice too! I can't wait to try it with spinach next time. Thank you!

Well, I used way to much pepper flakes, probably 2 spoons, after that we couldn't really recover, when i sauted them it made me and my husband cough and filled the whole house. I liked the spinach, my husband didn't. I also used asparagus but I didn't think the recipe had much flavor. It could be though that I just messed it up.

This was a good recipe.  I used fresh spinach and rotini pasta and added a can of garlic, basil and oregano seasoned tomatoes.  Topped with shredded romano. Really healthy and delicious!

keep in mind people that a 10 oz pack of frozen spin. is more like a 16 oz pkg of fresh because it is already trimmed of all the waste so if you are using fresh go for the large bag

Good base with a lot of possibilities. First try was add a can of hunts fire roasted tomatoes, small can of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup chopped stuffed olives. Put parm cheese on top, and you are good to go.

OUT-FRIKEN-STANDING! I made this for dinner and was amazed. Simplicity, freshness, and most importantly delish!I added about a half a can of diced tomato drained and sprinkled with parmesean.

Okay. Even with fresh parm grated over top, this dish was very bland. I can see why it would be good for a child, but my palate wants more flavor.

A great recipe, very simple to prepare and healthy.  Like other reviewers, I added a can of diced, Italian-seasoned tomatoes.  Next time I'll add a can of chickpeas or white beans for protein.  Delicious!

I used penne pasta b/c that's what I had on hand and fresh spinach. When it was done I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top. It was fabulous. My husband polished of the whole dish.

I will not make this dish again. The flavor was okay.  Nothing special.  My husband and daughter did not eat any of it.  I ended up throwing the food in the trash.  My husband thought it had to much garlic.  I thought it was a bit too unhealthy.

I was looking for a vegan recipe to use up some fresh spinach. I added the chopped fresh spinach to cooking pasta for the last 3 min. It turned out great easy and tasty. I added klamata olives and sundried tomatoes to the leftovers the next day and it was delicious.

It was very dry, needed more moisture and flavor in the sauce. If you make this you really need to add other items.  I had to add many items just to get it to a 4 star for me.  Without them I had to give it a 2.  You could use this as a base for something.

Fantastic and easy dish.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with a diced onion and the garlic after the onion softened rather than boil it.  I also added cayenne and some chili powder as I'm a huge fan of spice.  To fancy it up a little, you can also add a cup of heavy cream when adding the spinach and reduced to get a great cream sauce.  To thicken the sauce, you can add a little corn starch and stir, slowly adding more until the consistency you want is reached; it shouldn't take more than 3 tablespoons.

This would be a great side dish. I accidentally put 3 tbsp of red pepper flakes, which is what I thought the recipe said, but after I realized that was just someone's comment... My mouth is still burning and I couldn't feed this to my kids. Our family doesn't like that much spice/heat. I will make it again using LESS red pepper flakes. Thanks!

This was good and most importantly fast!!! I added a chicken italian sausage and onions. I used farfalle pasta. I added olives and mushrooms (from a pasta sauce - but only a little bit). Finally, I washed it down with a nice shiraz.  It was delicious :)

I did make a few adjustments as per other comments.  I added a small chopped onion with the garlic, and wilted fresh spinach with it.  I added half a can of diced tomatoes, some blanched green beans (cuz I needed to get rid of them), lots of pepper, some salt, along with some kalmata olives and some parm with whole wheat rotini.  I think it's even better leftover :)  The flavors have a chance to mingle together.

Da Wife likes more salt. 10 Minutes was not enough. It should be at least 20 minutes. As for the spinach, place in at least 6 minutes before you drain. Besides that, it was a hit with Da Wife.

I understand it's supposed to be healthy and all, but, a little too bland for my tasting.

In a pinch I would say this is a pretty good recipe.  But nothing to write home about.  The dish is alittle dry.  So if leave alittle water in it, add sauce, more oil olive or something.  More veggies if you have the would be good.   permesan cheese is a must for this recipe.

Very easy, simple, and light.  I love garlic, spinach, and pasta and they were excellent combined.

This was a nice & simple super quick dish to make. I used spaghetti instead and for a slightly asian twist I added a splash of sesame oil to the olive oil, a bit of soy sauce and some toasted sesame seeds and it was delicious! I used fresh spinach and added it to the pan with the garlic and it was ready in minutes! I'll make this again when I need a quick dinner! Oh, I also added salt and pepper, and sprinkled parmesan at the end.. yum!

Didn't have Garlic so used garlic powder and it just didn't do it justice so ended up improvising alot.  Added more seasoning and then used a basic roux to make it creamed and it was very good!  Got me to use some spinach up that I needed to!

My first time cooking and this is the recipe I wanted to try on the wife.  She does not like spinach but she LOVED this! I grilled and cubed some chicken breast and threw it in there as well. I tried this on her this past Friday and she wants it this Monday again.  Thanks! Oh, my 10 year old daughter even tried it too who doesn't like spinich either and said "not bad" Thanks again!

My family enjoyed this dish, however I found it a bit dry. It was a little difficult to keep the spinach from clumping together, but still delicious. I think maybe adding some yummy melted cheese might be a nice touch.

I thought this tasted like it seriously needed salt, so I ended up stirring in 2/3 jar tomato basil pasta sauce. Probably will make it again, but only because I like spinach :)

I disagree with those that said this recipe was bland.  What else do you need when you have 7 cloves of garlic?  I loved the flavor of the garlic, and I used red chili flakes from India, which were very spicy and gave the recipe some zing.  Along with salt, that was all that was needed.  We are a little short on grocery money this week, and my  husband thinks he has to have meat or fish at every meal.  I decided to try this because we had the ingredients and it could feed all 4 of us for just a couple of dollers.  It was great and I will make it again!  I may throw in some tomatoes when we have them, or some different white cheeses, to experiment in the future.

Yum!! Per the other reviewers' suggestions, I used fresh spinach (and entire bag, but could have used more), and added a can of diced tomatoes with onions and green peppers. It was great, with just the right amount of zing. Fresh parmesan added a great touch to the dish. It was so easy, too!

Delicious, everyone loved it. I added a can of tomatoes and parmesan cheese and also used fresh spinach which I added in w/ the pasta in the last 2-3 minutes of ocoking.
