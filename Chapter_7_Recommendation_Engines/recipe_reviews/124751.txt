LOVED this recipe! My one mistake (made in haste) was blindly trusting that the amount of dressing in the recipe would suit my taste, and I ended up with a very soggy salad.  Try starting with half, and work your way up from there!

This recipe rocks! When I made it I didn't have any dijon mustard on hand, so I substituted it with honey mustard and it worked nicely. Since then, I have made it with the dijon and it tasted just as good. Who would have thought blue cheese, blueberries and baby spinach would be such a wonderful combination. I'll be using this recipe for years to come.

This was so yummy!  I didn't have bleu cheese so I used reduced-fat feta.  The pecans were a MUST...made the salad excellent! Everyone asked for the recipe!

This was great!  I added a cup of blueberries instead of a half cup and it was too much.  I'd stick with a half cup instead!

YUMMMMMM!!!!!!!! I've been on a total salad kick, and this recipe was perfect!!!!  I left the recipe at work though, so I made a different dressing- 1/2 cup of veggie or olive oil, 1/4 cup raspberry vinegar, 1/2 onion, 2 garlic cloves, salt, fresh ground pepper, blended in food processor.  DELICIOUS!!!! LOVE the blueberries, I used walnuts instead of pecans, and I used Feta cheese instead of blue cheese.  I also added chopped pears and red onions- can't get enough of it!!!

Perfection! Don't change a thing! Sometimes I'm of a heavy-kitchen-hand (more ingredients = better?), but not in the case of this salad. Simple, sophisticated, and absolutely delicious. I served this at a BBQ, alongside standard grill-out fare, and imagine my surprise to see folks going back for seconds, and thirds, of a SALAD, over the other dishes.

Wow, this was delicious!  We absolutely loved it!  I used walnuts & balsamic vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I also had frozen blueberries, so just thawed some out & they worked just fine.  We will definately be having this again!

Since I am trying to cut out all forms of processed sugar, I cut up 3 dates, softened them in 3 T of boiling water and used an immersion blender.  I also added garlic and used olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  It came out great and plenty sweet.

Well, I’ve been on a fruity salad kick lately.  The berries and melons in the market are exceptional this year, so I can’t help myself.  I made this last night and we enjoyed it very much.  I subbed red leaf lettuce for the spinach, and feta for the blue cheese.  I would suggest adding the sugar to taste.  I found the dressing to be very tart, so I increased the sugar.  That did the trick.  This salad was another nice way to enjoy this summer’s wonderful blueberries.

I used extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil, balsamic pomegranate vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar, dash of salt only & low fat feta cheese swapping out the blue cheese with this recipe. It will become a regular addition to many of my meals now. Excellent!

I LOVED this salad.  I made it for my lunch just about every day for a month!   The flavors are amazing; raspberry vinegar, dijon mustard, fresh sweet blueberries, blue cheese, spinace and toasted pecans....yummy!  I followed the recipe as is, but cheated a bit.  Instead of toasting the pecans myself, I purchased a bag of Pecans from the food store already glazed.

This salad is wonderful!  I made it without substitutions, merely ommitting the salt.  The combination of the sweet, toasted pecans and vinagrette, offsets the bite of the blue cheese and tart blueberries.  Using raspberry vinegar, instead of ubiquitous balsamic, gives this salad an innovative and unique flair.  I think the combination of ingredients as written is what elevates this salad from being just another, run of the mill fruit, nut, balsamic salad interpretaion.

Good salad. I thought the amount of dressing was way too much, as another rater stated.  I used the recipe as stated and to my taste, it had a bit of a bite, however, the guests I served it to really liked it.

My new favorite salad for spinach! I did not have fresh blueberries, but defrosted frozen ones in a water bath for 5 minutes. I am sure it would have been even better with fresh, but frozen were good too, just a little softer. I didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar and added few blueberries to the dressing and used a hand blender for the dressing. I also used toasted almonds because of an allergy. I have no doubt that the original version was as good as my substitutions, which received raves. Start to finish, it took less than 10 minutes. Thank you for the delicious recipe! Even my husband ate the spinach like this. : )

Great salad! I would add honey to the dressing to make it sweeter, or use a HONEY Dijon mustard and it would definitely be a 5 star salad.

Good basic recipe.  I thought the dressing was a bit too sour, though.  Needs a touch of honey to even out the vinegar taste.

This is a good salad, nothing special.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  For the dressing I used olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Since I didn't have raspberry vinegar, I replaced the sugar with raspberry jam.  I thought the dresing was too salty using the recommended amount.  I think a pinch, if any, is all the salt that is needed.

This is a must try! It's a great recipe. My teenage son who eats very few green things asked for me to make it! The recipe is extremely forgiving of substitutions. I had to use red wine vinegar and feta cheese instead of what it asked for and it was fantastic! I'm thinking of trying it with seasonal fruit when the blueberries are gone.

The blueberries worked very well in this salad.  I think I would prefer it with some other changes, although I haven't experimented.  It might be nice with a mixture of crunchier greens in addition to the spinach, and I wasn't thrilled with the dressing.  I used feta cheese instead of blue because I don't like blue cheese, but I'm not sure that was a good substitution.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of raspberry.  I was a little generous with my rating because I don't want to penalize the salad for my substitutions.  I probably would have given it three stars otherwise.

Great flavor combination, perfect for summer. We already had a raspberry vinaigrette, so we used that over spinach, butter crunch lettuce from our garden, and topped it with pecans, blueberries, and crumbled feta. Absolutely delicious and done in 10 minutes. Yum!

Very good and healthy!  I made a few adjustments as always.... I just put 1 teaspoon of Dijon Mustard.  I didn't have raspberry vinegar so I pureed 1/4 cup of blueberries in apple vinegar.  I used 2 teaspoons of sugar substitute and only a pinch of salt. Finally-I used sliced almonds as I didn't have pecans.

This was okay, but nothing special. I didn't care for the dressing at all and ended up using another dressing instead to be able to eat this. This dressing wasn't good at all with this. Sorry for the poor review, but I've made and eaten much better blueberry and spinach salads than this one.

I really liked this salad, but I found the dressing just a little too tart. I added a tablespoon or so of honey and then it was perfect. I also replaced the blue cheese with feta. I'll make this again with the changes I noted above.

oh yum!!! This recipe is great . I made it for a get together and I was a little nervous cause I hadn't tried it before but there was not much left as I was leaving and a lot of people told me they enjoyed it. I used olive oil and balsalmic vineger( couldn't find rasberry)and used walnuts instead of pecans. Very good, healthy, antioxident rich salad. I will be making it many more times.

Great recipe!
I used olive oil and balsamic. Sweetened it with Stevia instead of sugar.  Used feta cheese instead of blue.  Still was GREAT!  Had more of an "adult" flavor - my nine year old twins turned up their noses.  Adults loved it!

I made this salad for a luncheon & everybody loved it. I used pomegranate vinegar instead of the raspberry vinegar. It was delicious. I made the salad that same night for my family & they loved it. Tomorrow I have been asked to make it again for my daughter's birthday dinner. This one is a big hit.

This salad is awesome.  The combination of the blueberries, blue cheese and dressing are fantastic.  I add some diced deli turkey for an absolutely delicious meal. I use chopped romaine instead of spinach and the colors are a beautiful presentation too.

We absolutely love this salad.  Like some others, I cut out the salt.  I also use about 3/4 the amount of vinegar that the recipe calls for...otherwise I find it has a bit too much bite for us (and we like foods with an ouch factor!)

This was A M A Z I N G. I used feta in place of the blue cheese and added some grilled chicken. I made the dressing ahead, so the rest was a breeze to throw together. My husband and I both loved it! This is a keeper for sure!

Surprisingly a really good salad! I don't really like blue cheese and I wasn't sure if it would go with blueberries, but - it did!  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil and it turned out really good!  Will definitely be making this salad over and over again!

Very good.  I also used toasted almonds and my son wanted to crumble up some colby jack cheese and it was delicious.  Oh I also add a squeeze of lemon to the dressing.  Thank you!

I loved this salad! I added strawberries to it, which made it even better. I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts, which was also a good decision. Will definitely make again.

I decided that I need to get some healthy fresh spinach into my life, so I bought my first bag and started looking for recipes on Allrecipes. I had to make some changes due to what was in the house, but the flavor blend of this recipe was great. I omitted the blue cheese to make it healthier and instead of making the dressing I simply added some dijon mustard to some raspberry vinaigrette dressing that I had on hand. This salad was so tasty and healthy. I will make it over and over again.

I thought this was an excellent salad but did not like the blue cheese as it was too strong tasting I will make it again but use feta instead.

This recipe served as great jumping off point.  

I had a lot of spinach, pecans and blueberries.  I made substitutions based on what I had on hand.

I made the dressing with 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup of diet cranraspberry juice, 1 tablespoon of honey and 2 teaspoons of spicy brown mustard.

I used grated Dubliner cheese instead of Bleu.

I also added some marinated artichoke hearts which I probably won't add again.  The recipe doesn't call for them but  just an FYI.

Though I enjoyed the combination of salad elements, I felt the dressing needed a little more zip.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Perhaps my raspberry vinegar is a little underpar, but another raspberry vinaigrette from the site was quite good.
