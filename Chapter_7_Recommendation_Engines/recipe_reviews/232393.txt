This was easy and delicious (and very healthy too)!  The only change I made was to use dill instead of the parsley.  I will definitely make this again!

I added some lemon juice and it was fantastic.  I recommend scooping out the seeds of the cucumber too.  I love how this recipe doesn't add extra oil or make it too complicated - it's perfect!

Thick and creamy, just the way we like tzatziki sauce.  I made this as written and let the flavors blend for a couple of hours.  I really liked the texture of this sauce.  This paired very nicely with 'Greek Lemon Chicken and Potato Bake' from AR.  Thank you Jake Brant, for another delicious recipe.  We've tried two out of your three published recipes.  I will soon be trying your 'Lime Mayo'.

This tastes great and it's easy to make.  The only thing I would change is to add actual measurements for the cucumber instead of just saying half a cucumber per cup of yogurt (because cucumbers aren't all the same size).  I made this last night to go with chicken lula kabob and it was perfect.

Simple, delicious and healthy!  I agree with the other comments, I used dill instead of parsley.  Goes great on a chicken sandwich/wrap, veggie dip etc.   I especially like how this recipe does not ask for oil.  Highly recommend!

I have seen this made by a Greek grandmother.  She used dill as well.  And this sauce is AMAZING.  You must, must, must let it sit for at least an hour.  This is so important, I can't emphasize it enough.  I like to dip my flatbread into this sauce and alternate with chutney.

i didn't have any yogurt (greek or plain).  googled a substitute and sour cream can be used - same amount.  i used dill instead of parsley.  i see that mint is used but didn't want to add mint when i used dill.  i used a squeeze of lemon. this was very good.  i would like to try the mint rather than dill next time just to see the difference.  i put it on chicken kabobs in a pita.  i will make again.

So my store didn’t have it when I wanted to make Gyros. I recalled it was made from Greek yogurt and a cucumber. After browsing some other recipes I added 1/4 cup sour cream. 1/2 tsp bottled lemon juice. Substituted dried dill for the fresh parsley. A little goes a long way. I would not compromise on the fresh cucumber. I grated mine with a micro plane grater with skin on. Discard any skin that doesn’t go through the grater. A sprinkle of Greek seasoning. This was so very easy. Love it!

It is refreshing and tasty. I added dates as a topping and the blend of spicy garlic with the sweetness of the dates is perfect.

I really liked the flavors.  My husband asked me to use half of the garlic next time.  I used dill instead of mint, and made it the night before so the flavors could meld.

I am not familiar with Tzatziki, so have nothing to compare this recipe to.  It was an ingredient in a recipe I wanted to try, and I had to make my own (not available where I am).  I liked it, and thought it worked well in the recipe. Now I have lots left over to try just as a snack with some pita bread.  :)

Dried or fresh mint is the most common herb in  Tzaziki, not parsley.  Some prefer dill.  Remove excess moisture from cucumbers to keep the sauce thick.  Shred the peeled and seeded cucumber and put in a strainer with something like a small weighted plate to apply pressure. I grab shredded cucumbers by the handful and squeeze between my palms to remove juice, which can be used for "cucumber martinis" or just a healthy drink.  After extracting excess juice, chop the shredded cake, most easily done in the food processor.

Made it and we loved it---used  Dill Weed instead of Parsley and I think that makes it perfect and yummy. We had it with the Greek Lemon Chicken recipe and it's a Winner on all counts. Will for sure make many times more. Thanks!

I'm making this again tonight to go with our shwarma. It's so good even my fiancée who doesn't like yogurt loves this. It's also really good as a chip dip...if you have any leftover. I made some alterations to the recipe adding mint, ground black pepper, and a bit of lemon juice. Make ahead a few hours to let the flavors meld.

I made this and it was super easy to do!
I used it with the other recipe I found on here for "spinach and feta turkey burgers" loaded it all on a whole wheat bun, cucumbers, tomatoes and onion! 

Extremely tasty! I highly recommend both recipes!

Little bit too much garlic, but easily fixed next time.  Pretty darn close to restaurant taste.

I also used dill instead of parsley and added a little lemon juice.
