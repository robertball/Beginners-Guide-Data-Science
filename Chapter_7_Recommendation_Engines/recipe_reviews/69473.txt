Thick and rich and delicious! I made a couple of alterations - a leek instead of an onion, fresh celery instead of celery flakes, and veggie brats seasoned with a little liquid smoke in place of the bacon bits. This is a great flexible recipe and one I'll be making often.

Really yummy and filling! I left out the bacon bits and celery salt because I didn't have any, but it still had a lot of flavor. I also subbed Earth Balance for the butter to make it vegan. Thanks!

My boyfriend & I absolutely loved this! I don't eat beans, so I left those out of the recipe but everything still turned out well. I've tried plenty of potato soups,stews,chowders but none have a good flavor until this one. I believe this will be a staple in our house.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Only variation I made was to add additional vegetables & had alder smoked salt as I don't use bacon bits.  House smells wonderful with the aromas! :)  Thanks for this recipe.

I won't use red skin potatoes, so subbed one of the potatoes with a carrot for color.  I had no butter, so only used the flour to thicken the soup.  I would never have thought to use cloves in a bean soup, so found that interesting!
