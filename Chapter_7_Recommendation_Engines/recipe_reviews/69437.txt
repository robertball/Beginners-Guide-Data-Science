I felt like this was more trouble than it was worth.  It wasn't bad, but I like my bread maker's focaccia bread recipe better.

I always make it and all my friend are crazy about it.
i usually add salt and rosmary (or oregan) on the top and extra oil to make the crust crispy.

it's good to serve italian starters with it.
