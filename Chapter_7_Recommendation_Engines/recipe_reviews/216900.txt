'Not too impressed with this one.  I made changes, but not enough to affect the taste - soaked the cereal(didn't crush it), buttermilk for yogurt, added 1/4 c applesauce, 1/4c milk, reduced nutmeg, added some vanilla.  These were very bland.  K said they taste just like bread.  'Guess that's a good thing since she doesn't go for bran too much.  Oh, used white sugar not substitute.  Brown would've been better & definately more of it & more cinnamon.  '
