Listen, the people before me must not love someone with diabetes.  I made these a few times and to tell you the truth, it needed a little work. :)  As far as them being flat? ANY so-called expert would know it needed a little baking powder.  So, add just about 1/4 tsp. no more!  Also, I know carbs also raise blood sugar. BUT! lol I ditch the skim (yuk) use regular milk or 1/2 and 1/2.  FINALLY!! another trick ANY expert ;) would know... If its bitter and you are using cocoa.. use dutch processed cocoa its not bitter.  Hershey's sells it in the silver container.  If you don't have dutch processed cocoa try a little vanilla.  This was a good recipe.  It just needed an expert :)

I made these for my grandma who is a diabetic and she loved them!

Modifications were: 1/4 tsp. baking powder & 1/2 tsp. vanilla; I used 2% milk instead of skim and I did not use the frosting.  

*At first they looked cakelike, but as they cooled they went down and look like brownies.  They smelt sooo good too!  I didn't try them b/c my daughter is allergic to dairy and I nurse her.  So, neither of us can have dairy.  But my grandma gave them 4 stars!*

I am a gourmet baker and cook, and unfortunately diabetic.  Therefore, my baking experience is vast both with sugar and sugar-free recipes.  I prepared this recipe following all directions.  What I got was a bitter, flat pancake.  Horrible!

i think that besides being delicious, these brownies also got a bad rap from the obvious chef nazis out there in cyberland. i think the problem isnt the recipe, folks. if you had read between the lines, you would have seen the missing ingredient in all of your concoctions was LOVE. that's right, you forgot to add the LOVE. & without love, even the sweetest of treats will go down like the bitterest pill.

I am diabetic and this is a GREAT recipe. I made one change. I am not crazy about the tastes of artificial sweeteners, including Splenda. I used one small package of dry chocolate pudding and filled the remainder of the cup with Splenda.  For those that thought the brownies were rubbery, you probably baked them to long.  Great job Judy!

I can not have any sugar so am always looking for a sugar free treat recipe so I can get just a little of my 'chocolate' fix periodically.  After reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical of trying this recipe.  I followed a few of the suggestions and this recipe turned out great.  I did add the baking powder and the vanilla.  I also followed what someone had said and for the splenda, I took the measuring cup and put in the smaller box of s/f chocolate pudding mix in there and then finished filling the remainder of the way with the splenda.  I used only evaporated milk and I did use about 1/4 cup more than it called for.  I did not put the topping on and boy, me and my family loved them.  Oh, I didn't use the nuts either.  I made it a few times and am sitting here eating it as I type!

I made these brownies and had four people to tell me that they were the best ones that they had ever eaten. All were diabetic. I did leave off the topping and I did add 1/4 tsp of baking powder to them.

Expert Shannon's tips are good ones, however, Dutch process cocoa is NO less bitter than natural cocoa, only somewhat less acidic. In fact, the "Dutching" process removes many of the more subtle chocolate flavor components along with the acid, and many people prefer natural's flavor for that reason.

These brownies were really good.  My parents and I are on the South Beach Diet and these were a good sugar-free treat for us.  I followed the suggestions and added 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I also used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 cup dry chocolate pudding mix instead of 1 cup of Splenda.  We all liked them.  It was hard to tell that they were sugar free.

This recipe was perfect for diabetics, but like any recipe, to make it perfect, you have to modify as you see fit. I used in fructose, instead of splenda, sugarfree chocolate syrup instead of unsweetened chocolate, evaporated milk instead of skim, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and a box of sugarfree cheesecake pudding, but I added it to the mix, instead of making frosting.  If anything, mine came out as moist as cake.  I actually made it 4 days ago and it is still as moist.  It was not as thick, but the flour is what makes it thick and being a diabetic myself, more flour is the last thing I need.  

P.S.---Splenda makes things dry anyway, so it is best to use the splenda for baking or only use half the amount; it tells you that on the package.

Un-salvageable!  I tried the recommendations of the other reviewers and still it failed.  And upon review, here's why:

brownie recipes generally do not include a liquid (milk water, etc.)  when the milk vaporizes it will leave a void in the volume of the final brownies (which is why the brownies sunk after baking to a flat object; the volume there at the beginning was not there at the end due to the loss of the water.  Baking soda will NOT help raise the brownies because baking soda leavens recipes when it is involved in a chemical reaction, typically you see it paired with lemon juice, yogurt, or buttermilk, which is not the case here.  The other time you see milk or other liquid in a recipe like this is if there is also a pretty good starch (ie: corn starch or tapioca) involved, which may help a bit with the volume issues and stability of the final texture (for those looking to fix this recipe...) The volume was off in the original and that explains the excessive flour use, which contributes to the bitter flavor.  

But unless you have a lot of time on your hands and patience to fix the errors of this recipe, I wouldn't attempt this.  I think allrecipe.com should remove it entirely!!!!

I tried this recipe for my mom who is trying to be on a diet, and to help her with her sugar cravings I decided to bake these. I used self rising flour and left out the salt. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and left out the frosting. The batter was so good that I had to remind myself that the brownies weren't for me. The only problem was my fault when I forgot to grease and flour the pan. Other than that they were perfect, and my mom loved them. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

I have gestational diabetes and all I've wanted lately is a brownie! Made these and the truth is, a regular brownie is ten times better - but for a sugar-free brownie, these are pretty darn good! I did add a little bit of baking powder to combat flatness.  My opinion: the brownies are better without the pudding on top. They are nice and fudgey and took care of my craving on their own.

SHANNONSPIVEY is correct; there is nothing wrong with this recipe. In addition to 1/4 tsp of baking powder and a dash of vanilla, I used a combination of apple sauce and plain no-fat yogurt in place of margarine. They turned out cake-y but that could be because of my alterations.

I made these the other night when i was craving something chocolate. I thought they tasted very good topped w/ some sugar free cool whip since I didn't have the pudding to make the frosting. One friend said they tasted salty (kinda weird since I used self rising flour)and my fiancee said they were kinda dry, but I thought they were perfectly fine and that's all that matters since Iam the one who's diabetic.  I did add the vanilla as other reviewers suggested. I used regular old hershey's cocoa powder and it wasn't bitter at all. I used the 1c of sweetener as called for and it didn't have a weird taste. Oh, and I didn't have nuts so I didn't put them in there.

The recipe as it is was not very good good.  Actually, not terrible for a sugar free recipe, but even so, not yummy.  What messed it up for me was the chocolate pudding as frosting.  It just tasted funny and took away the chocolate flavor.  I think the brownie part would have been pretty good without it.  Next time I will try the tip recommended by another reviewer of adding the pudding mix inside.  It just didn't taste right on top - what could be less fudgy than a brownie with pudding on top of it.  Wait, I just remembered this cheesecake I made from this site called "brownie chocolate chip cheesecake" back before I knew I had to watch sugar...it has a box of brownies as the crust of the cheesecake.  I'm always trying to think of a good sugar free cheesecake crust, so I think this brownie recipe minus the pudding would be perfect for a sugar free cheesecake crust!  I will have to try that this weekend with a sugar free cheesecake recipe!

I was unsure of this... But they turned out great!! I used a 1t of vanilla, 1/4t of baking powder, butter instead of margarine, I used the sugar free pudding mix with truvia, and I added about 1/4 cup of all natural peanut butter, I also used vanilla soy milk (about 1/2 cup) they puffed up nicely... A little cakey, but great chocolate peanut butter flavor! Now the test will be if the BF likes them :) I didn't think they needed frosting, but yummy with SF ice cream!

I work in the food industry, so I have a little insight to these issues: 1st: It doesn't matter which milk you use if making this for a diabetic because the difference between skim,2%, whole & 1/2-n-1/2 is that they take more of the fat content out of it. It still has the natural sugar in it. 2nd : It is correct about the cocoa..the Dutch is just less acidic not less bitter so just add some vanilla 1/2 - 1tsp should do it and the Baking powder to make it rise a little 1/4 tsp. The dry chocolate pudding is a nice complement but to the diabetics out there please remember to adjust your carbs according to the nutrition label on the pudding box.

I am not diabetic, however I cannot eat sugar. I cooked this recipe as directed and found it to be a little flawed. Firstly, when I took it out, the margarine surfaced and was bubbling on the brownies, and they were too thin for my taste. Also, at 25 minutes, the edges are hard. However I will try to make it like MOM192 suggested, with the baking powder to see if that helps. 

Also I must give a big koodos to the icing cause in 23 years, I've never thought of using pudding as an icing. (5 stars on that)

Very good!  I used whole wheat flour, added 1t of baking powder and increased the Splenda to one and one half cups.  They were nice and fluffy and great tasting.  I did find just a little dry, so next time I will try adding some applesause.  Happy Eating

Not having made this I will still give it a 4.  It looks much better than the one I got from the Splenda web site.  I intend to make these today.  Thanks for the frosting recipe.  Well, I made a batch today & even my spouse likes them.

I thought these were wonderful. I actually took them out 5 min early and baked them in a larger pan so they were thinner. They were so good. I didn't make the frosting. It was just the brownies themselves. I've been eating sugar free for a long time and now my taste only likes sugar free. Sugar stuff makes me seriously ill. So this was just so good. I can't say enough. If you find it not sweet enough, it's probably your taste buds are just used to having too much sugar.

I took the advice of the experts and added the baking powder and vanilla, they turned out really good.  My husband is diabetic and he LOVED them!!  He said they were GREAT!  Said they ranked right up there with hot fudge cake at Shoney's.  He ate them with ice cream and said it was out of this world!! Thanks for the advice!!

Ok - I am not diabetic but do try and eat low carb.  That being said - I made a couple changes that made these pretty good!  I took one packet of SF choc pudding and put it into the 1 cup measuring cup.  I then made up for most of the difference with Splenda but did add .25 cup sugar (for sweetness) I also added mint choc chips and I used a stand mixer with a whip to fluff it up.  I then sprinkled coconut on top.  YUMMY... very dense and cake like.

These brownies were horrible. They were flat and bitter. The pudding tasted like pudding, but did nothing to improve the taste of the inedible "brownies". I have had sugar-free brownies before, I know it is possible for them to taste good. These are not good.

As a diabetic, I was looking for a sugar-free chocolate dessert.  I think this hit the spot!  I read the reviews first, and added 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp vanilla as suggested, and used wheat flour instead of white.  While they weren't perfect (the gooey-factor wasn't quite there), they were tasty and chocolatey! I also didn't have the "flat" factor that other reviews mentioned.  These rose into a good, thick chocolate bar.

I made this for my diabetic stepdad for after a bbq.  It was more like fudge than a brownie (even for fudgey-type brownies) but when it first came out of the oven it was cakier.  I added some peanut butter to the "frosting" and it was really good.  Overall, it was ok.  Very rich and dense.  Probably wouldn't make again unless stepdad was coming over and would take the leftovers home

Ok, I followed the instruction exactly, and added the 1/4 t baking powder and a splash of vanilla. They taste alright, and will probably go well with some sugar free ice cream. But on their own... eh. They are so thin, I can't even call them pancakes. I would love to know how someone got theres as thick as the ones pictured, cause like I said, I followed all the instruction about beating till fluffy, the order, etc, exactly. I will probably play with this again though, since it is extremely low in calories and no sugar.

I tried both the original recipe and the improvements and some tricks of my own, and NOTHING HELPED! They were thick, rubbery, and had little to no taste at all. You'd be better off using a regular brownie recipe and just substituting Splenda and such to make it sugar free.

I was recently diagnosed as Insulin Resistant, so I cannot have sugar at all now.  I was excited to find this recipe because I am a chocholate lover esp. when it comes to brownies.  I amde this recipe and when I finally had some I was so disappointed. I am glad that some people do love it, everyone is entitled to their oppinions.  No one should be put down because they didnt like it.  I just wont be making this again. Except the pudding lol. Yum.  I do appreciate someone making recipes that are suagr free though. SO thank you for helping.

Flat and dense , slightly chewy and I even added the baking powder that was suggested by another baker. They puffed up in the oven and then fell flat upon cooling.  We ended up putting them with ice cream. Good if you have a chocolate craving and are in desperation.

I made this recipe today with the following modifications recommended:  1/4 tsp baking powder, vanilla and 1 packet sugar free chocolate pudding before the splenda.  I only baked for 20 minutes - still kind of rubbery and really, really flat.  Also pretty bland.  I made them for my husband who is diabetic and he said "they're okay, missing something" as he made a face that showed exactly what he thought of them. I might add some sugar free cake frosting to salvage them.  I won't be making them again, now trying to find a way to eat the whole batch.

Though texture/moistness is great (I used the modifications mentioned by SHANNONSPIVEY), I just found it had no flavour.  The walnuts and Splenda just overpowered everything.  I couldn't taste the chocolate at all.  I don't know if adding more cocoa powder would help or not.  If there is a way to make this more flavourful, I would stick with this recipe.

I made these this afternoon, but I changed a couple things. Firstly, I used truvia, not splend. I also used light vanilla soy milk instead of regular skim milk. And substituted the walnuts for pecans. I also did not  the frosting on top. I added about a 1/4 tsp of baking powder, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I thought they were actually pretty good! I don't really like things that are too sweet, so I thought these were pretty spot-on for me. The only thing I didn't really like is that they were more cake like, as opposed to brownies. This could have been an error on my part, however.

First, I loved how they look, nice and fluffy and light(with the baking powder inclusion of course xD). But unfortunately I hate the taste of artificial sweeteners. I tried the recipe with splenda and I felt like I was eating aspartame brownies. But I can see how it would be a pleasant alternative for a diabetic or dieting person.   But as I said before, the texture is PERFECT. So I replaced the splenda with powdered sugar. I know it defeats the purpose, but for anyone that prefers real sugar over sweeteners. C:

These are good! A few changes and it took about 2 weeks to figure out! I added 1/2 cup splenda and a pinch of baking soda instead of powder. I mean a pinch! Also 2 oz. of semisweet bakers chocolate. I skipped the walnuts and used bananna sugar free pudding. (chocolate works too). Also make sure to beat the eggs until frothy. Dad and husband aproved and that is not the norm!

I'll admit that I have never cooked with
splenda and stevia before (I had to use both since my new box of Splenda only had 1/2 c. in it!) The taste is okay, the texture dense, but weirdly, the whole thing sizzled in the pan while baking!
I don't know if it was the butter and sugar substitute? I used a bit of PAM to prevent non-sticking, but I doubt that was the issue. Anyway, it was a good first attempt, and I did follow the adjustments suggested by the earlier posters. Might be worth a second try without the stevia and without the PAM.

I made these with 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 2% milk.  They tasted ok for being sugar free. After they were taken out of the oven they fell, so they ended up being pretty flat

I decided to try making this recipe with pecans instead of walnuts, 2% milk instead of skim and without the pudding frosting.  As I mixed the ingredients, the kitchen filled with a lovely cocoa smell.  As I baked it, the house filled with a wonderful aroma.  As I let it cool, my mouth watered in anticipation.  They looked a little flat, but still beautiful, with a perfect crust.  I cut a small square and took a bite...

UGH!  Oh, these are HORRIBLE! X-p

Its like bland bread with nuts...  hardly any cocoa flavor and only a slight sweet aftertaste.  The one positive thing I have to say about these is that they don't have a greasy feel in one's mouth (though they have an incredibly large amount of fat.  I am diabetic BTW; as per the Canadian Diabetes Association symbols, the recipe as described is ~8 starch, 3 protein and 25 (yes, TWENTY FIVE) fat; ~1850 cal, with nuts).

My wife (not diabetic) found them even worse.

I'm not a 'chef nazi' and I wasn't trying to commit suicide by bad-brownie, this is just a BAD RECIPE.  Look elsewhere for diabetic dessert recipes lest you get disappointed (why not just sick to the 'sugar free, chocolate fudge flavored instant pudding'; those (i.e. Jell-O) are always good by themselves (though I recommend using at least 2% milk, not skim) and have FAR less calories.

I made this three times already. I actually used the Splenda brown sugar. And I did just a little bit less of flour and I added the milk. Very good.

I plan to make these often.  They were perfect and delicious!  I made the  revisions as stated by other reviewers by adding baking powder, adding sugar free pudding mix and filling the cup the rest of the way with Truvia and adding  vanilla extract.  I made some changes of my own that, for my purposes, made them even more wonderful!  Instead of butter or margarine, I used coconut oil and instead of milk I used unsweetened coconut milk.  They were not flat, no bitterness, no aftertaste, and they were completely satisfying!  I just have to convince my husband that he won't like them!  That won't be easy!

Thank you to whoever posted this recipe! I am on a low-carb diet and have not had the pleasure of sweets in quite awhile because I couldn't find anything. I came across these and I am so glad that I did! They are perfect! The only thing I did change in the recipe is the margarine. We don't use that at home so I used unsalted butter instead and they still ended up wonderful. 

I think that the only reason anyone would not like this recipe is because they are to used to enjoying overly sweet chocolates, and this recipe is not that ubber-sweet brownie recipe that makes your children run rampant throughout the household. My in-laws especially don't enjoy overly sweet food so this was perfect for everyone. I recommend giving it a shot!

My husband and I are both diabetics, and I'm always trying to find sugar free recipes that will satisfy our sweet tooth.  This recipe did the trick!  I made some changes just for our own taste. I added a half a bag of sugar free chocolate chips,  made them as cupcakes and added a dollop of peanut butter to the the top before baking. This combination satisfied another weakness that we share.  I may try instant espresso granules the next time.

I did not add the baking powder and mine had some funny bubbles and cracks as they baked but flattened out as they cooled. I did everything just as the recipe called for- when I take some to a meeting this week I will add the baking powder. Pudding frosting is yummy. My diabetic husband says they are great.

Not horrible but not great either.
I read the reviews and added vanilla and baking powder.
It still turned out flat and the flavor was off - not satisfyingly chocolatey, or sweet and cakey.

The search continues.
I think I like recipes with honey, agave and stevia instead of the splenda.  I could takes the chemicals of the splenda.

Pretty good for a sugar free dessert. It could be better, but it is a nice substitute for a diabetic. I used the 1/4 tsp of baking powder and the extra pudding with the sweetener. Good tips; they were successful!

Paper thin, they never did rise. Too chocolate powder tasting. I'm not diabetic, but I watch my sugar intake, so I bake w/o sugar, and this recipe did not work for me. Don't waste your ingredients.

I added about 1/8 cup more cocoa to the brownies and didn't add the "frosting".  My husband, who's diabetic, liked the taste but said they were a bit dry.  Personally I found them dry and thickly solid in texture.  I'll try this recipe again but with some (hopefully) improvements.  For someone wanting a chocolate fix, this is great.  For someone wanting sublime brownies...this isn't quite it yet.

I was really excited about these, but they just didn't have any flavor. They were also only about 1/2 inch thick, too thin for the kind of brownies I like. The "frosting" is more like a pudding pie in a brownie like shell. I won't make these again.
