The recipe is quick and easy.  My first experience with anything like this, so not sure if they are "right" or not.  I am working on making mu shu right now (velveting the chicken currently).  They seem like they will stand up to the filling without ripping, so that is a plus.  I had to cook mine a bit longer, but I think it is my old worn out stove.  Thank you for this recipe!

Easy and fun to do. Cut the recipe down to make only four. I was glad I didnâ€™t have to use flour tortillas for my mu shu. I will definitely make these again.
