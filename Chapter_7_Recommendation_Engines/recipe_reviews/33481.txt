We used to make this often when we were younger. Goes really well with half cranberry and half club soda for a bubbly sensation.

Wow! I thought this would be too sweet. I was so wrong. I think the cranberry juice balances the liqueurs very well. This would make an awesome punch too. Taste like a refreshing jolly rancher cocktail :) Yummy!  Thanks for sharing SAMMYSAM!

Holy frijoles. This DOES taste like a Jolly Rancher! Very tasty. I could see how this could be a good summer drink, poured over fresh cut citrus fruit.

I just made this drink in a 2 quart pitcher and my GOODNESS I'n ready to smack someone's Mamma. This is Good.  Easier to make than the frozen jolly rancher drink I make using jolly rancher candies.
