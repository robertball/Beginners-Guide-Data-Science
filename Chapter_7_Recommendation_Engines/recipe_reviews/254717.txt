Delicious! I subbed quinoa for amaranth (higher protein), dates for cranberries, and skipped the honey to lower the sugar and make it vegan.

I've been making my own granola for 20+ years, but adding the quinoa and chia seeds was a new twist for me.   I left out the chocolate and coconut, but the other ingredients are part of my own recipe.  I like the crunch of the quinoa and chia seeds and I regularly have my granola with kefir milk that I make myself with a little unsulfured molasses as a sweetener.
