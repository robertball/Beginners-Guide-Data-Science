This is a REALLY great side dish - I served them with chicken enchiladas and spanish rice. Based on some of the reviews, I did the following:
*after scooping insides, I salted the tomato boat and turned upside down (salt draws the liquid out and helps give flavor at the same time!). 
*I mixed the corn with tomato insides, eliminated the butter, and added salt, pepper, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. The spices worked SO great with the dish - and helped tie it in with enchiladas.
*When spooning into the tomato boats, I kept mashing it down and draining allowing the excess liquid to come out. If you let the mixture sit for a little while with the salt added, it will help draw out the liquid.
These were flavorful, healthy, and really colorful! I will definitely make again.

I used miniature muffin pans and set the tomatoes on each muffin hole.  This kept the tomatoes in place and allowed for easy removal (since the tomatoes were too large to fit inside the muffin holes). This also allowed extra juice to drain into the muffin cavity.  

The presentation was beautiful and the tomatoes were snatched up quickly at a neighborhood picnic. 

The flavor was bland. Next time I will add herbs or something to give it more flavor.

We love this recipe!!!!  One way to get rid of some of the watery-ness is to drain some of the liquid from the inside of the tomatoes.  When scooping out the inside of the tomato, make sure to flip them upside down and let some of the juice run out.  Very good and very healthy!!!

I made the recipe as it is, and in the end was glad that I didn't add any herbs or spice: the gentle taste is quite balanced to my opinion, corn and butter go very well together, and the tomato 'counterpoint' is more than enough. It makes a great side dish that is colourful, but won't steal the limelight from the main course.

I loved it, it had great presentation, I added a few extra seasonings (as usual) and sprinkled cheese on top. It definately helped to let the tomatoes "drain" after cleaning them out and the I liked the muffin pan idea, it helped for me anyway! Will definately make again!

This was really good.  I changed a couple of things.  I used fresh corn instead of canned and I think that really made the difference.  Also, instead of using muffin cups you can cut a thin slice off the bottom of each tomato so they sit flat.  Would definitely make again!

Good, but needed more zest.  Next time I'll try using Corn with Jalapenos from this site.

These were just okay for us. I added some garlic and onion powders, but we still found these pretty bland. I think cumin would be a nice addition. Honestly, I think we would have liked these better if I hadn't baked them and just left them cold. Thanks for sharing with us! :)

This is a good, solid basic if you need a side veggie dish and you have the ingredients on hand. I added oregano for extra flavor but it still didn't have the 'wow' factor I was hoping for. When hallowing out the tomatoes leave the sides rather think. Thinning them out too much will make a mushy mess. Also, I don't have a muffin pan so placing it on a baking tray worked fine, as long as you pack the corn mixture into the hallowed tomato - this gives it weight and prevents it from toppling over.

I figured I'd try it with a cornucopia of different veggies.  Couple things i tried that I found enhanced the natural flavors.  Add garlic to the stuffing.  I also found it needed a little more salt.  Then again, I'm not exactly a prime example of health...

Great idea! We got a ton of tomatoes from a relative and I was looking for something creative to do with them... I baked them in ramekins instead of a muffin pan so they could just be left in there; it's a good thing because they ended up with a lot of extra liquid and filling! Overall they were pretty tasty, though next time I may add a few more seasonings or maybe some cheddar cheese after they're done.

This wasn't fantastic.  I scaled it back to two servings, and I had way too much corn mixture to fit into my tomatoes.  Maybe my tomatoes were too small, but any larger and they would not have fit into the muffin cups.  As it was, I had to squeeze my spoon in to get one of them out, and ended up ripping it to shreds in the process.  While baking, I heard a sizzling noise in my oven.  When I opened the door, I realized that the juices were running over the pan.  My kitchen was half smoke filled by the time I got a sheet pan underneath them.  This is a great idea, and I love the idea of using the pulp of the tomato in the dish instead of throwing it out, but the flavor is lacking (and I even added some parsley) and there's way too much liquid.  Also, I'm not sure that the muffin pan is the way to go with these.  They're too difficult to remove.  I might make it again, though, as my issues are all easy fixes.

Excellent side dish.  Easy to make, and flavorful!  Good advice on draining the excess liquid from the tomato.

I did not enjoy this dish. It is easy enough to make but there is too much margarine.

Made some of these for dinner. Turned out to be a big watery mess. I left the tomatoes in at the right temp for as long as recipe instructed, but they were mushy and I ended up just dumping the muffin tin upside down onto a plate and eating it like a stew.

I followed the directions exactly, but my tomatoes turned out very *wet*. Very watery and juicy requiring my husband, at one point, to drain the juice off of his plate. I liked the flavor, the texture and the color but would be interested in any tip to avoid that watery result.
