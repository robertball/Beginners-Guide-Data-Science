This is a great recipe. I served it for a light lunch with antipasta.  It was wonderful and so easy to make.  The creamed spinach really adds great flavor and texture.  But you can put anything into it. Thanks!

The flavor combination was great!  The bread got mushy after cooking - maybe the creamed spinach, but we still ate it and enjoyed it. Maybe if you cooked the bread a little before hand?

This recipe is a little different. Not bad, jsut different. I think it might have potential if it was "tweaked" a little
