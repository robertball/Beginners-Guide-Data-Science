Traditionally I do believe Flautas are made with flour tortillas and Taquitos with corn tortillas.  At least in Southern California these would be considered taquitos.  I used cooked left over chicken.  Minced very small.  Minced the onion and bell pepper small.  Cooked the onion, bell pepper - added the chicken and taco seasoning and cooked a bit.  Added about 1/4 cup water and cooked it down - add a little more water if it seems to be drying out.  Take off the heat and stir in the cheese.  For the tortillas  - I heated the oil and dipped each tortilla briefly in the hot oil - remove quickly so they don't start to brown.  Place a spoonful of chicken on to each tortilla roll up and place seam side down on paper towels.  Do NOT overfill.  Once all the tortillas are rolled start frying by placing into the oil seam side DOWN - 3 or 4 at a time - this seals the tortilla.  Once brown and crispy, flip and fry the other side.  Drain on paper towels and serve with salsa on the side.

I just made this recipe because I was tired of the same old chicken recipes.  I used flour tortillas though instead of corn because that's all I had in the house and they were wonderful.  I had some friends stop in and they also loved them and wanted the recipe.

These are excellent. The meat has just enough flavor and the salsa adds a nice touch. The only problem I had with mine was rolling the corn tortillas because they are so thin. My advice is dont buy the cheap ones because they tear really easily. Other than that I will DEFINATELY be making these again

This is the way my Mom used to make them when we were little. I know it's not the healthiest, but hey, when do you usually eat flautas? I eat them with some guacamole and cream on the side. So delish!

I made these using green Enchillada sauce, and some cumin for seasoning, instead of the Taco seasoning and water and they were delicious.I also used flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas  I will definately make this again. They were even better the next day after sitting for a while in the fridge- I just reheated them in the oven to keep them crispy ( don't reheat in the microwave or they will go soggy).  Served with lots of guacamole and they were to die for

Made these and they tasted great. I didn't have boneless chicken breast. I used 2 cans of chunk chicken. It worked fine a little less time cooking chicken. I will be buying better tortillas mine were breaking on the roll. I think if you heat them in microwave for a bit it helps. I'll try the Ortega brand next time. No complaints in this house LOL

Yes. Baking Nana is correct. Flautas Are flour tortillas not corn. So with that said, I too had leftover chicken. I added a couple teaspoon of dried onion, chicken tacos seasoning and some chipotle powder. I didn't bother with toothpicks, just held them together with tongs till they could hold their own shape. Drained and served with guacamole n sour cream. I made Fideo to go with it. Delish!  Thanks KCB

I made these for the first time last night, 3/6/2015. This is a fantastic recipe. The only thing I did differently was fry corn tortillas on each side for a couple of seconds before adding my chicken mixture. I was so surprised how fresh they tasted compared to the ones you get in a restaurant. Also, I made my own taco mixture with 1 tbs of chili powder, 1/2 tbs of onion powder and 1/2 tbs of cumin. Nothing can compare to home cooked, we love these and will use them as an appetizer next time we have a dinner party. 
I made mexican rice as a side and guacamole- 3 avocados, 3-4 chopped onions, 1 Serrano, 1/2 squeezed lime or lemon, and about 1 tbs of my homemade hot sauce, and a chopped tomato. Season with salt, pepper, cumin to taste. If the serrano has too much heat, use a regular jalepeno. So good.

Made these for my family last night and they LOVED them. We didn't make any changes to the recipe except to use flour tortillas. Surprisingly quick to make, a good weekday dinner.

enjoyed the chicken filling, the corn tortillas did not work for me, when I rolled the tortillas were falling apart. I just happened to find flour tortillas and worked much better, will be headed to the store for more.

These were great, didn't use toothpicks and if you find the tortillas are tearing it may be that you are not using them at room temperature.

I used the hatch chili shredded chicken my store carries in the deli to save some time and it came out fabulously.  I serve with guacamole, salsa and sour cream, and a salad with a cilantro, lime dressing and they disappear quickly.

All though this looks good it's more like taquitos than flautas.  I order flautas at my fave Mexican restaurant which uses flour tortillas instead of corn. And I prefer beef over chicken. However I would love to try it with corn. Thanks for posting the recipe.

Made these last night and not a single one was left. I used flour tortillas instead of corn but that was the only thin I changed. Will make again.

This recipe was good, but not outstanding, to me. I didn't care for the cheese in the mix...the ones here don't have cheese. I also used my own homemade seasoning instead of packaged taco seasoning.

We had to turn the temperature down on the fryer to 350 because otherwise the stuff started burning. Also had difficulty the first few times trying to wrap it because the corn tortillas kept tearing (probably user error more than anything :-P). But overall, definitely liked!!!

Loved these. I used my usual mix for the chicken seasoning and added sweet onion and garlic. Also, used a bare minimum of oil to fry, maybe 1/4 c.  and they were nice and crunchy! Thanks for the recipe, may try beef/cheese mix with flour tortillas next time.

Thia is a good recipe. The only thing is that if your tortillas are breaking you may want to heat them up first. They will be easier to roll up. It's a different spin on Mexican flautas. Which in my house are made with a salsa verde on top but this way is really tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

My teenaged boys both *loved* these.  I followed the suggestion of another user to lightly fry the corn tortillas, then fill, roll and fry again.  I wasn't wild about the taste or consistency of the filling.  I think because it was all minced, it was mushy and didn't have a lot of flavor.  Next time, I think I'm going to use shredded roast beef. The only other thing I added was a sprinkle of kosher salt once the taquitos came out of the oil the second time. The salt sticks well if they're still hot!  Like a couple of other commenters, I don't buy the taco seasoning at the store but make my own.  So much better!  Thank you for the recipe Baking Nana!

Excellent!!! My wife's favorite Mexican food is flautas, and she prefers these over her favorite restaurant flautas.
