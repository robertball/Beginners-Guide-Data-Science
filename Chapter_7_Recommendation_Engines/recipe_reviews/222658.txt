I tried this last night and liked it so much I'm making it again tonight!  I did however do some things differently.  I used a combination of fresh and thawed frozen vegetables and added some onion.  I sauteed 1/4 of an onion in the skillet first with 1 teaspoon of garlic power.  Then I tossed in the veggies.  For the sauce I used only a small amount (approximately an 1/8 of a teaspoon) of garlic and I added some black pepper.  When I make this again tonight I'm going to add a small amount of spicy mustard to the sauce.  Though the sauce is good on it's own I personally think it could use a kick.  I also think adding water and cornstarch or flour to the sauce and letting it cook until thickened (rather than adding it before serving) would also add a little something too.

This is perfect pared with jasmine rice, tofu, and an egg roll!

Wow this was a big hit tonight!! I did change it a bit, sauteed chicken in olive oil with garlic and one onion, then added the frozen veggies and sauteed them till tender and stirred in the sauce (used crunchy peanut butter for added crunch).  Put it all over white rice and served!  Just yummy!  Will use brown rice next time!  This is a must try recipe, with almost everything you need in your pantry!  A+++

YUM! I doubled this recipe since I was also using chicken and rice, and it was sooooo good! I didn't have brown sugar, so I used regular white sugar and it still tasted amazing. I got so many compliments on my food. 

At first when I mixed the sauce together It looked disgusting (lol) and I was hesitant to mix it in with the food, but I'm glad I went ahead and did it, because it was fantastic. The dish looked like regular chinese food with the sauce.  'Twas amazing. Give it a try.

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce and added approximately a cup and a half of day old brown rice. I also added a can of drained water chestnuts and crushed red pepper. I think this is going to become a weekly staple! I absolutely loved that I could used frozen veggies and typical household ingredients to make this ethnic-style dish.

Great! I cooked ground beef first, then added it to the vegetables before stirring in the sauce. It tasted amazing and was super easy. What a great recipe that uses ingredients I almost always have on hand! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe came out so good the first time, I had to try it again the next week. I love how easy it was to put together, and that I already had all of the ingredients in the kitchen. Instead of adding it to the vegetables, I mixed it into the chicken. The flavor is phenomenal regardless of whether you add it while the chicken is cooking or off the heat.

This will be a new go-to recipe in our house! I gotta admit- I did change up the ratio of the sauce. More peanut butter and more brown sugar, but only because I favor very sweet asian dishes and sauces. I also added stir fry beef as a protein. The actual ratios in the recipe would have been fine, too. One tip- when you add the frozen veggies there is some moisture that collects at the bottom of the pan. You can either drain that before adding the sauce for a more thickly coated stir fry, or you can leave it and have a more liquidy sauce that soaks nicely into some white rice! This is probably the easiest meal I've ever made. Really, it's easier than hamburger helper or even DRIVING to a restaurant! And for such a simple, affordable recipe that requires several ingredients that I almost always have on hand, its flavors were interesting and quite complex. I will be making this again, 100 times over. Delicious!!!

I was looking for a simple side dish to go along with the Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi that I made (Also on this site and totally awesome). I am usually a bit of an All recipes snob. If it doesn't have at least 100 reviews I pass it up. And no picture?! I won't even glance at it.  I'm so glad I did because this is now a staple in our dinner line up.  It's really easy and full of flavor.  I think next time I may add beef like another reviewer did and make this a main dish!

Very good recipe, quick and easy. Although, I thought the garlic powder was way too much and I love garlic. I will half the g powder next time. Will try adding water chestnuts next time.

Great recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand and it was so simple to do.  Next time I would increase the amount of veggies because there was plenty of flavor and throw in some cooked chicken or shrimp.

I made this recipe for my very picky 81 year old mother who never tries anything new. She actually had seconds! I made the recipe pretty much as directed but added a little more garlic and peanut butter. I like it a little stronger. Next time I might try the sauteed onions that someone suggested and/or chicken and rice. Excellent dish.

after making this, I let the wife taste it...bad idea. she begin adding more peanut butter. I'm not a fan. so I then had to doctor it. then she comes back from bathroom and... the battle was on.I did add more garlic powder. seriously, it does need minor tweaks for taste, but very good stuff.

I cannot stand frozen veggie stir fry.  My husband made it, I rolled my eyes, sat down to dinner without much enthusiasm, and was quite surprised.  I love this sauce so much that we have stir fry almost weekly and since I don't have access to frozen veggies anymore (we live in Costa Rica now) I even go through all the effort to chop fresh veggies for it.  We also serve the stir fried veggies with the sauce over rice.  My husband likes his with chicken so we make that for him to add on the side.  Makes a really easy meal for families that are part vegetarian and part carnivore!  I agree that you need to double the sauce for a family of four.

This recipe was really tasty!  I made no modifications and my 3-year-old gobbled it up.  The leftovers even reheated well.  I served it over white rice.

Followed a few tips & added what we had, but the basic recipe is KILLER!
Doubled the sauce recipe, since I was adding sliced, leftover 'Roasted Pork Loin' (from AR) & some of its jus.
Cooked it in a 'stir-fry pan', after sauteing minced garlic & the leftover pork in EVOO. Then followed the recipe. 
Served it over brown rice & my wife said, "We never need to order Asian delivery food again!"
Can't wait to try it with chicken & shrimp!!!

Tried this tonight for something different and I loved it! Even my family loved it. I will admit, next time I'll cut back on the garlic a little bit. I don't know if it's the brand I use but it was very garlicy. Overall, a good recipe and I will be making it again.

I'm on a kick for peanut butter sauces and man does this nail! So delicious, creamy and was just what I was looking for! ????However, I didn't add the brown sugar as for me and what I wanted didn't feel the need to add it so I left it out

This was pretty good and so easy. I added more soy sauce after tasting it - next time I'll just double the sauce, since I thought it needed more for the rice. Also added a healthy amount of red chili flakes for kick!

This turned out great. I was a bit apprehensive of the peanut butter, but it made for a nice sauce and the consistency seemed just right. My 2 year old even liked it.   In lieu of all frozen vegetables, I used an assortment of fresh and frozen vegetables: assorted bell peppers, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, frozen peas.  I also added some sesame tempeh. All in all, this was a really easy recipe and it took very little time.  I also added crushed peanuts.  As for the rice, I've fallen in love with organic, microwavable rice (ready in 90 seconds), which cuts total time (and effort) significantly.  Cheers!!

This was good.  It was a bit sweet for my taste but easily fixable with a bit less brown sugar. Very good overall!

Easy! I changed it up a bit: started with chopped onions and then added minced garlic. In my sauce, I boosted up the spice with some sriracha sauce (to taste). I also added some chicken I baked with cayenne pepper, paprika, red pepper, and salt/pepper. Yum! I would venture to add less peanut butter next time. I read it as tablespoons! No wonder. Still good though!

This is an amazing recipe for anyone who enjoys Thai food. It is well deserving of the 5 stars. To satisfy my personal taste i added some cayenne pepper for some heat and used fresh vegetables. I would have uploaded a picture but it didn't stay on the plate that long. Amazing!

Awesomely awesome!
I cut up a chicken breast in small cubes and cooked it first. Removed it from the pan and added the frozen vegetables. Cook with garlic salt and pepper then add the chicken and sauce. I also added some ginger and srirachi to the sauce and some of the rice water to thin the sauce a little then added it to the pan. Unexpectedly good!!!

OMG, this was so good!! I don't like vegetables and I will definitely be making this as often as I can get away with. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. I may add onions next time but it's great without it.

Also doubled recipe, added a can of pineapple, chicken, onion, zucchini, cayenne pepper, dijon mustard. Great because of basic on-hand ingredients, ease of prep, and pretty good taste. For me did not come out too sweet or garlicky. My son and I both added some soy sauce at the table.... Would like to try with the cornstarch suggestion. Still needs some zing.

Instead of olive oil, I used sesame seed oil. i sauteed fresh garlic, added fresh broccoli and carrots, and steamed them until tender. I then pushed the veggies to the sides of the pan to make room in the center to quickly scramble a few eggs and add to the mixture. i then added the sauce and leftover turkey breast from thanksgiving and stirred until warm. delicious!

Awesome recipe! Love the flavor AND the simplicity.  I fried up some tofu, doubled the sauce and served over brown rice noodles.  Good stuff!  Going into my regular rotation.

I just so happened to have all of these ingredients on hand, so I whipped this recipe together and was surprised at how delicious and simple it was! Won't take long at all and it tastes amazing. I didn't change a thing.

I just make the sauce from the recipe, but the whole family loves it!  I double everything, substitute 2 fresh cloves of garlic for the garlic powder and add a healthy shake of cayenne for a bit of a kick.  Delicious!

This recipe was very good!! My two small children even liked it (6 yrs old & 2 yrs old). The only thing I did differently was that I doubled the ingredients for the sauce. I didn't think it had enough flavor without doubling it and it was a little dry. VERY TASTY THOUGH!

Quick. Simple and delicious. That's all there is to it! I would make a bit more sauce next time because I like my stir fry coated thickly, but this was just the right amount to taste the flavor without seeing a lot of sauce on the stir fry. I recommend low sodium soy sauce and perhaps a bit less garlic powder, but otherwise this recipe is perfect!

I was excited to try this, since it is made with regular frozen mixed vegetable.  It was very simple, and I thought it was a nice change.  But my husband and daughter were not impressed.  I wonder if anyone has an easy suggestion to liven it up a bit?

This is a very forgiving recipe... I did it all wrong... I put the oil and sauce ingredients in first and then threw the frozen veggies in on top.  It still tastes great.  I added a few shakes of powdered ginger in in too.

This was great!  I can't wait to use it again. I didn't have any soy sauce but was determined to make this. I used the sub of 4 tsp Worcestershire sauce mixed with 1 tsp water (thanks to allrecipes for the suggestion).  I also, I didn't want to use garlic powder, I used 1 heaping tsp of minced garlic.  Great!

I love this!!! We double the sugar and peanut butter but do the rest the same. We add chicken and put it on rice or rice noodles for a quick and delicious dinner. We have also just made the veggies as a side. We eat this at least once a week as I love it so much!!

Delicious! We are a very picky family when it involves veggies. We all loved this. I used a pkg of frozen stir-fry veggies from Sam’s Club. I did double the recipe to feed the four of us, and will probably make it again with veggies, chicken, and rice.

I really liked this recipe! I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I had and it actually may have made it even better. My friend gave it a 4/5 and is picky with his veggies and doesn't really like soy sauce. I'd make them again. A good Asian side dish.

The next day I ate it with rooster garlic and chile sauce and little green onions. That was really good too. I really liked the kick. 

I think this recipe would also be really good with plain chicken mixed in and whole peanuts. I want to try that next time!

Great recipe! Made exactly what was shown for 3 people, but it wasn't quite enough and we were all still a bit hungry after. Next time we'll double the recipe for sure! Worked just fine as a main dish, could probably toss in chicken as well if you miss the meat but it doesn't need it. Goes great with rice and frozen pot stickers.

So quick and easy!! I added cooked and peeled shrimp to the veggies. I doubled the recipe (big family) and also added a tablespoon of orange marmalade to the sauce mixture then mixed everything together with spaghetti noodles. Family absolutely loves it, definitely will be making again soon.

Great sauce. Made it exactly as recipe states. I actually made more because it seemed like a small amount at first but a little goes a long way! You do not need thickly coat the veggies, a light covering is DELISH. Definitely going to make again. A+++

This was really simple and uses ingredients most people have on hand. I’d recommend throwing in a bit of ginger (fresh or ground), sesame oil, and fresh green onions once cooked. But as-is- nice flavor. Use up those tired old bags of frozen veg from the freezer- that’s what I did! ??

this is really good! I doubled the recipe but kept the peanut butter at 2 tbsp. I sauteed an onion first, cooked 2 chicken breast in the onion along with garlic, then dropped in the frozen veggies. it's definitely worth a try

Can it get any easier ?!?! I never made stir fry and this turned out delicious.  I used chicken 1st time around, and set it aside (and dashed it with some soy sauce as it sauted). Very easy to open the bag of stir fry veggies and put them in ... as they warmed up I added the recipe ingredients and made rice in a separate dish.  At the end, I mixed in the chicken and put it on a bed of rice ... YUM! 2nd batch I used pre-cooked salad shrimp along with the chicken as a test ... they do get small when warmed up but what yummy gems!

This recipe is surprisingly delicious as-is (just using a frozen vegetable mix) but the real gem is the sauce.  We've used it in other stir fries, with and without chicken/rice, and it always turns out amazing.  Only modification we sometimes make is to shred some ginger into the sauce, but it's delicious both ways.

I used sesame oil instead of olive.  Like some of the others, I sautéed onions and garlic before adding the vegetables.  Since this was to be a complete meal, I sautéed sliced chicken breast with the onion and garlic.  Added bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and mushrooms to the vegetables.  Great supper!

So easy!  I followed recipe except I added some cut up cooked chicken breast.  Since I made this for myself I had enough 
leftover for 3-4 meals.  Last time I made a stir fry I cut up
Fresh vegetables.. I may make stir fry with frozen veg all
the time.  Good sauce!

So easy! I eyeballed everything and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder in the sauce. And when I was cooking my vegetables I put black pepper, crushed red pepper, and garlic powder on them and then added the sauce.

Very tasty. I used sesame oil instead of olive oil. I used half the sugar & doubled the quantity. .

I used mostly fresh veggies since I had them on hand. I added straw mushrooms,  water chestnuts & a little leftover roasted pork. 

Hubby liked it so will make again.

Dumped a huge bag in my biggest non stick pan.  Cooked about 10 minutes, doubled the sauce.  Perfect.

So good, and so easy!! The whole family loved it. Made it exactly as written and it was perfect. I might add some red pepper flakes next time for a little kick. Thank you, Tracey!

I had intended to make this with the frozen vegetables, but ended up buying fresh vegetables instead. I doubled the sauce recipe and also added chicken. The sauce is really the main point of this dish, so I still felt I could give an honest and fair review. It was absolutely delicious!! This was the best stir fry I've ever made. The sauce was absolutely perfect!! It wasn't overly garlicky, and it was not a heavy sauce. I will definitely use this every time I make stir fry!

This makes a delicious and easy vegan meal!!! I used low-sodium soy sauce and increased the peanut butter to about 2 tablespoons. I will make this quick sauce over and over, it goes great on steamed broccoli, potatoes, almost anything really! Love it!

Quick and easy to make. I added strips of beef to the recipe and added a little olive oil to the sauce to make it more liquid. The peanut butter takes it out of the ordinary.

My husband is super picky about homemade stir fry, and this won the day! I added chicken and served over rice; it was amazing! I would double the recipe if serving more than two people though, but this is going to be a regular on our table!

The sauce is delicious, I quadrupled it because I used a ton of frozen vegetables along with a can each of pineapple, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. I also baked chicken breast with some garlic and soy sauce, sliced it up and mixed it in. Everyone loved it!!

This is my go-to stir fry sauce.  Gives lots of flavour ( I usually use fresh veggies), and it's easy enough for my 11 year old to make while I chop and fry veggies. Love it!

Very good as is!  I kept the sauce separate from the veggies for my picky family, and drizzled it on my peas and carrots.  So good, and my super-picky son even liked dipping his corn-dog in it.  This makes maybe a quarter-cup of sauce, but it's plenty of flavor.

These go perfectly with my fish and chicken. I looked up this recipe last second and had everything on hand. I was able to prepare the sauce while the veggies cooked. The only change I made was using honey instead of brown sugar because I'm not a fan of adding actual sugar to food if it isn't necessary. My boyfriend loved it! He drained the sauce on his vegetable. Whatever works.

Great recipe!  I loved the sauce, simple list of ingredients and fits into my version of healthy.  I used 10 oz of frozen stir fry veg with one package of Quorn's chicken chunks.  For future stir fries, I I've collected my favorite fresh & frozen veggies and packed them into 12 oz bags that are ready to pull out of the freezer.

I tripled the recipe using 2 lbs of frozen vegetables, 1 lb of chicken, added a little powdered ginger, and reduced the garlic powder as some other reviewers suggested. It was super easy, very quick, and tasty. I'll definitely make this again.

Great flavor and sauce.  I think it's closer to 4 servings than 6.  i added chicken to bulk it up and make it more filling.  I will definitely make if more and often.

Trying new dishes. I made the Frozen Vegetable Stir Fry. It's a Thai style side dish. It was really good because the taste of the sauce wasn't overpowering like you get in a Thai restaurant. DH & I both loved it. Will make it again. I used frozen veg.'s. Only change I made was less garlic, and added some fresh green peppers out of our garden. Next time we're going to try it with just all fresh veg.'s and just add the sauce. I think it would be good either way.

Just to add I had the side dish with baked potatoes made in my new pressure cooker and chicken breast. I made the potatoes and the chicken in the pressure cooker and cooked 20 min.'s. Excellent meal. (It would be good over rice also.)

This sauce is excellent. I usually make a lot more of it though so we can really coat everything, including the rice bed I serve it on.

Perfect, but needed some heat for my liking. As many I was hesitate, but thought I'd give it whirl because I love Thai food. Added some shrimp for protein and served over brown rice. I like spicy so added some sriracha, next time I'll add some cayenne pepper. Even without the extra heat has a great flavor as written.

I triple the sauce mixture (except only double the sugar), add two cut up chicken breasts and an extra bag of frozen veggies.  I also substitute with regular garlic and occasionally add fresh ginger.  I serve it with brown rice and it is great!  This is a perfect quick, easy, and healthy meal!  I keep frozen vegetables and cut up frozen chicken on hand so it's great for when you don't plan ahead!  We have been eating it weekly!

I doubled the recipe and added cornstarch, water, spicy mustard to the sauce, sautéed chicken in garlic and served over multi grain rice- so far no complaints even from my picky 6 year old

We really love the sauce for this.  The last time I made it I added red pepper flakes.  I haven't tried with frozen vegetables, just whatever fresh I have on hand at the time.

Pretty good starter recipe. I think it is important to mention that as you are using frozen veggies, you really must drain the extra water before adding the sauce. Speaking of sauce, I doubled recipe ( was needed) and used crunchy peanut butter to give texture. Turned out great. Will do my own personal tweaking but this was a great gateway recipe!! Thank you!

Super quick and totally awesome flavor! This one is a hit for sure! I followed it exactly except I heated the flavor mix on medium low and added pepper. This seasoning would go good on just about anything! I'm going to give it a shot on chicken on the grill this summer! Wow, I'm so glad I ran across this one! Just make it, you won't regret it!

I added a pack of ramen noodles and I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted balsamic vinegar and the chicken flavor packet in the sauce. It turned out GREAT!

I really like the peanut butter adder for flavor and adding the sauces after all veggies  and chicken have been cooked makes them cook better and flavor is more fresh.

Good sauce for ads might with varied taste. My husband doesn't like too spicy...myself? Nothing ever spicy enough. We both added liquid aminos (soy sauce substitute) and I added a dollop of chili garlic sauce to add the needed kick in my bowl:) I'll use less sugar next time and perhaps a hit of rice vinegar....overall solid base to add flavor to according to personal preference.

Very flavorful ingredient combination. Quick and easy to make, which is perfect for busy weeknights.  Will definitely add this to my "make often" list!
Update: I've made this numerous times now, and we always love eating these vegetables. However, as much as we love garlic, tonight I decided to halve the garlic amount. These came out better than ever!  This is one of our favorite recipes for vegetables.

Very tasty and easy as is or just simple enough to change as needed by adding chicken or beef to the mix as well. You can have it on rice, noodles, or even alone! This is going to become a staple in our household.

Perfect easy delicious dish! Great flavor, and super simple. I changed a couple things. I wanted to make this the main dish so I started by sautéing onions & chicken thighs (cut into small pieces), until chicken was cooked thru. And i didn't have frozen veggies so I just used fresh: added yellow orange and red bell peppers and zucchini to the chicken. Also added slivered almonds which was a nice addition! Then once all that was cooked, took off heat and added the sauce, which I did exactly as recipe called for. But I tripled the sauce, and it turned out to be the perfect amount for how much I made. Served over rice. This turned out so good!

I made it with chicken. Cooked frozen chicken in the oil. I then added the frozen veggies. I have a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, so I didn't have to add anything else. Cooked the veggies about 12 mins with the chicken. Took off heat and added the sauce mixture. From previous reviewers I added a touch of garlic but not a ton and a little bit more peanut butter. It came out great you would never think everything came frozen. Serve over Jasmine rice! Yummy! I  will make this one again!

5 Stars! This is gold. This is one of the very few recipes that is good as is (and this is coming from a guy who likes to tweak recipes and go off the books). I was little apprehensive when I saw the peanut butter in the recipe, but this was SO delicious and SO easy to make. 

Instead of using frozen veggies, I used whatever fresh veggies I had in the house (mushrooms, onions, celery, bell peppers, etc.) and added chicken. Yum! The sauce is sweet, but also savory. A few other reviewers have suggested adding spice (like maybe Cayenne pepper) to the recipe if you want to go with a 'sweet and spicy' flavor instead. I might add some barbecue sauce to this next time to go for a BBQ chicken/veggie stir fry! Pro tip: If you have extra sauce, save it and use it as salad dressing the next day!

Wow, this recipes was sooo good. I did change a few things. I doubled the sauce. I used the garlic powder that was called for but, I think it was a little much (and I love garlic). I do not usually cook with frozen veggies so I cut up 2 small heads of broccoli, 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini and 1/2 of a yellow onion. Just before it was done, I added half a can of peas 1/2 can of carrots (just what I happened to have on hand). This came out so delicious, even the kids loved it!

Made this stir-fry tonight with grilled asian chicken and fried rice. It was awsome!!! I did use fresh vegetables however, i.e. broccoli, red bell pepper, onion, celery and water chestnuts. I was going to use fresh garlic but I forgot it (didn't miss it a bit), after stir frying the vegetables I added a small amount of water covered and steamed for a few minutes, added the water chestnuts in the last minute to heat them. This is now my go to stir-fry recipe. I have been looking for a good one for a long time, but the search is over.
Thanks for sharing.

I liked the easy way with which this sauce came together.  If you are looking for a quick and easy recipe, this is it.  Will definitely try this again.  It would be even better with fresh vegetables as the frozen ones are not crisp but rather soft.

Wow! This was my first time making stir-fry. I used a 1 lb bag of Great Value stir-fry vegetables, and added 5 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I substituted the olive oil for vegetable oil and garlic powder for garlic salt, since that was what I had on hand. I also added just a small bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. I served it over white rice, and it turned out phenomenal!! I will be adding this to my quick weeknight go-to recipes! I love how easy and cost efficient this meal is. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Very good, just a little too much garlic for me (woke up in the middle of the night still tasting it). So next time I will only use 1 tsp of garlic powder. Otherwise, this was wonderful with an Asian veggie mix and some tofu fried in coconut oil. Yum!!

Incredibly easy way to make a very healthy meal.  Could use a little more flavor, but still excellent idea.

Yum! New family fav! Used half the peanut butter. Added flour, a little water, and red pepper flakes. Also threw meat and chopped walnuts to the stir fry. Awesomeness.

Great Recipe! It's easy and very few ingredients which I like! I added some pasta to make it more of a meal and adding chicken would make it a great meal too. Great basic sauce though!

So good and so quick! Only changes I made were adding a squirt of spicy dijon to the sauce and adding some leftover cooked chicken breast to the mix! Served with jasmine rice. Super easy supper and tasted amazing!

Followed sauce recipe. It was very good but we did notice a slight bitterness/bite to it. I am not sure what would cause that, based on ingredients. Next time I may try a little more sugar. I did use a 14 oz bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables and served over brown rice. Unless you are serving this to people with very small appetites, it would never feed 6! My wife and I finished this by ourselves. Very easy & quick to prepare.

This was amazing and super easy!  I doubled the recipe since we served it over brown rice and used chunky peanut butter for texture.  We also mixed fresh and frozen veggies.  This dish was a hit with everyone and that's a tough thing to do!
