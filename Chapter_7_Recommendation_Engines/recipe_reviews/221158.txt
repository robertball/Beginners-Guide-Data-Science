These are very cute and easy to make. I use Ghirardelli squares instead of graham cracker cookies. To make it easer to center the peanut butter cup, I place a Ghirardelli square (flat side down) on the table, put a dab of frosting on the bottom of the peanut butter cup and place it in the center of the square, then turn the cap over and place the tassel and candy-coated chocolate piece in the center.
