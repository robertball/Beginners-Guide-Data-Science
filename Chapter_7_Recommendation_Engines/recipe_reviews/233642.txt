I made them again but this time with 1/2 cup of melted butter and 1/2 cup of white sugar. First time I tried this recipe they turned out too sweet to my palate and due to the canola oil - very greasy. They're perfect this time. Thanks for sharing.

I just made these and they are fabulous!! I did use fresh ginger not granulated so it did change the texture I think. They are soft and chewy and very flavorful!! making them again today, going to use the dough for a cheese cake base!! Will let you know how it turns out!!

We loved them. Although next time I think I will add just a bit more molasses.

Rather decent recipe, so thank you for sharing it! I was looking for something to make for this year's cookie exchange, and this fits the bill nicely. I decided to try it out today, and will be making 12 dozen of these two weeks from now, after all. 

My toddler is fully enjoying this cookie with a small glass of milk. 

Having just made the cookies today, I find the crunchy edges and inner chewiness delightfully seasonal and a nice change from other run-of-the-mill cookie exchange fare. I wonder if any will last until tomorrow to see if the texture or taste improves from what impressed me today.

The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use vegetable oil. Oh, I also lightly sprayed the pans and only halfway rolled the cookies in sugar, trying to prevent any from sticking to the pan, in case that was going to happen otherwise.

I did 1/4 c butter and the rest oil.  Added 1/2 tsp cloves as well as some nutmeg, allspice & cayenne.  Did sugar as half brown sug and half white sug. Also reduced baking powder by 1/4 tsp.  I rolled into balls and rolled in sugar, then lightly pressed them with a glass bottom (and slightly  re-sanded tops w sugar), then baked for 10 minutes.  Came out with fab flavor and flatter like I wanted with gently crispy edges and chewy centers.  Perfect!

used butter ib stead of canola oil, after all a little butter makes the batter better.

I agree with other reviewers that this dough is kind of crumbly and a bit hard to work with. But it seems a trade off for much less saturated fat in the cookies. I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 c and they tasted fine. I think I will try freezing the balls before baking them. Maybe the texture will improve. If not then I will try adding butter to the oil and reduce the oil.

This recipe is too dry and way too oily! I will not make this one again. I think the staff were into too much rum and egg nog when they picked this.

I used oat flour and olive oil instead of all-purpose flour and canola oil. I followed the recipe otherwise, and my cookies were very flat.

I just made these cookies to take to my church's social hour tomorrow. They smell and taste great, although they are a little bit oily.
