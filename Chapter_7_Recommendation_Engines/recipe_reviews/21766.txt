I've made this recipe twice so far, and I've made a couple of adjustments to it.  The first time I made it, I made exactly like the directions stated.  Although, I used a meat thermometer, because my loin was perfect in 1 1/2 hrs.

The second time I made this, I pureed 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 of the rosemary, and enough olive oil to bind it together.    I rubbed my pork loin w/ the paste, then put in a ziploc bag in the fridge for a few hours to marinate.  YUM!  I threw in some veggies with my loin (carrots, onions and    celery) and poured about 1/4 cup of wine in the bottom of the pan.  Roasted for about 1.5 hours covered, and everything was perfect!  I scooped out the veggies, and then used a can of chicken stock and some cornstarch to make a gravy out of the pan drippings.  I served with buttered herb rice and the roasted vegetables.  BIG hit!  5 stars!  Thanks!

I've made this twice and I have to tell you the second time I cheated.  I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic, you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too.  I didn't make a paste.  Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt, pepper and accent.  Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top.  Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hrs.  It came out just as good if not better then the first time.  
This is the absolute best pork roast.

I'm not even sure if I used a loin.  I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it.  Not the small loin cut.

Very flavorful, tender and juicy. One note....ALWAYS use a meat thermometer, never trust your oven or a recipe to tell you how long to cook a piece of meat. Mine 2.25lb roast took just over 1 1/2 hours to cook. Also, once the meat is done cooking, cover it with foil and let it rest for at least 10 minutes or it won't be as juicy when you cut it. The roast temp will rise a bit even after you take it out of the oven so account for that in your cooking temp.
I didn't have any white wine so I subbed white wine vinegar and chicken broth for the wine. Still turned out delicious!

My whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  The pork was very tender and the sauce was probably the best part besides the wonderful aroma while cooking.  I too reduced the cooking time to 1 hour and fifteen minutes and I even had a little over three pounds of pork loin.  I also put the garlic/rosemary rub on the meat early in the morning and let it sit covered in the fridge all day. I used very little olive oil, just enough in my mini food processor to hold the rosemary and garlic together, around 2 to 3 tablespoons.  My other recommendation would be to double the amount of rosemary/garlic mixture, especially when using more than 2 pounds of meat.  I served this along with roasted potatoes and sauteed green beans with almonds........yum!

This is a great tasting roast. I used a 2.8-pound pork loin top loin roast for this recipe. I used fresh rosemary from my garden instead of dried, and added just a little onion and olive oil to the paste rub. About 1/4 through the cooking process, I added a little chicken broth and a little wine to the bottom of the roast, and about 20 minutes later, I turned the roast. I cooked the roast for 1 and ½ hours total, covered it with foil for about 10 minutes, and it came out done but very moist.  I recommend using a meat thermometer, cooking time really depends on the cut and size of your meat. I added more chicken broth and wine to the drippings in the pan, a touch of flour to thicken, and everything turned out delicious! I served this with asparagus risotto. Thank you, Kathleen, for sharing this recipe.

This was a superb dish!  I have always hated pork loin, but I think it's because no one ever cooked it like this!  My modifications: 1) Cooked at 300 degrees for 2 hours, 2) Substituted basil for rosemary, 3) Substituted 3/4 c. chicken broth for wine.  I baked this in a covered dish, and the meat was simply falling apart when done.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I couldn't believe how tender this roast came out! I substituted fresh rosemary instead of the dried and increased it to 3 tablespoons.  I also addded a litlle minced onion and lots of pepper.  The wine I added as it cooked and then made a very tasty gravy with a mixture of more wine, beef broth, flour, water and of course those great drippings from the pan.
I did throw some small fingerling potatoes in the pan about 50 minutes before finish time.  Very wonderful, every one loved it. It cooked for about 1 hour 45 minutes for a 3.5 pound roast, but I used a meat thermometer.

I made this recipe tonight using a bone-in Boston Butt pork roast.  It was almost 5 lbs, so I doubled the recipe.  I guessed on the cooking time, but it was about 3 hours.  I cut the slits real deep to put the paste mixture in, then blended the olive oil with the remaining mixture in the same processor to rub on the roast.  I used a roasting pan with a lid and had a ton of juice to baste with.  Oh, I also sliced a sweet onion and layered the bottom of the pan with it and put the roast on top.  And when I put the wine in the drippings, I mixed it with some corn starch first, to thicken the gravy up a little.  It was delicious!  I will most likely be making this again.

This recipe was soooo good.  I too only cooked it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes and I even doubled the recipe using 2 1/2 pound loins.  I used half the rosemary (which was plenty) and doubled the garlic.  I also marinated it overnight.  This was absolutely great and I will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very very good.  I added some red potatoes right into the pot and they came out great.  I used a little extra wine for the sauce and added some diced mushrooms.  Also added some flour to thicken it a little.  Great stuff!!!

I just made this for dinner.  It was great.  I used my prime rib rub - rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  Stuffed sliced garlic pieces into roast (2 1/2 lb).  Heated oven to 450 and placed roast into oven for 20 minutes to get that seared look.  Lowered oven to 350.  Cooked one hour more.  It was perfect.  My husband said he prefers this roast to prime rib!  Add the pan juices to one cup chicken broth and 1 tablespoon */- cornstarch for an excellent gravy.

WONDERFUL recipe, but I've made quite a few changes.  I used an awful lot of rosemary and garlic and I also added thyme, poked a lot of holes, and stuffed the roast as instructed, however- I then heated a pan until it was very hot and put in olive oil.  I seasoned the pork all over with salt and pepper, then seared the pork on all sides to seal in the juices.  I then removed it, let it cool, and rubbed the pork with the remaining garlic-rosemary-thyme.  I find that searing the meat (the pan must be VERY VERY hot to get a lot of nice brown color on it quickly!) helps seal in the juices and makes continuously turning and basting it almost superfluous.  I watched it, keeping to about 20 mins per pound of pork, and checked it with a meat thermometer.  I let the meat rest before cutting into it.  The result was an incredibly juicy, tender, and tasty roast pork.  I patted myself on the back it was so good!  Really lovely- and I'll make it again, but probably on another Sunday- it was a bit of work for a weekday meal.

This recipe only uses one herb, dry rosemary, which by itself is somewhat bland.  The amount of olive oil is excessive too.  You only need 2 to 3 table spoons of oil.  That's why I am giving this recipe 4 out of 5 stars.  My personal recommendation is to not to waste your money buying dry rosemary.  Even the national herb brand you see in every grocery store sells dry rosemary for over $4 for a small container.  However, this has little to no flavor.  Fresh rosemary packs a mean punch, but when it's dry, rosemary has no aroma or taste.  Using a 3.5 pound pork loin, create a paste using 2 to 3 table spoons of olive oil, 3 table spoons each of fresh rosemary, sage, thyme and minced garlic.  Add 1 to 2 table spoon of fresh ground pepper to the mix.  You may want to adjust the quantities of everything according to your amount of pork loin and taste.  For my pork loin, these quantities were perfect.  Place the herbs, garlic, olive oil and pepper in a food processor and mix everything to a fine texture.  This creates your paste.  When the paste is finished, your kitchen will be filled with a wonderful aroma.  Rub the paste all over the pork loin and refrigerate the pork loin a day prior to cooking.  The author is dead on about using a thermometer.  You don't want an undercooked roast.  At the bottom of the pan, I added carrots, diced onions and white wine. I also created a gravy using 2 cups of chicken stock, 2 table spoons of corn starch and the pan drippings.

I have now made this several times and each time I experiment a little -- but it always turns out FABULOUS! First, I ALWAYS use a meat thermometer and take it out when the meat reaches 160 degrees. The other thing I always do is sear the meat before I put it in the oven. That way I don't need to turn it during cooking.

I also have substituted 1 cup of apple juice for the wine and cook it in the bottom of the pan -- it helps keep it moist and the apple juice makes a terrific gravy. (I serve this variation with the Awesome Sausage, Cranberry and Apple Stuffing found on this site -- terrific combination!)  

It also makes a great take-away weekend dish.  I make the rub and liberally place it all over the meat, often adding a little chopped spinach and garlic to stuff inside the roast.  (Take a large sharp knife and pierce the center of the roast at it's end.  Turn over and do the same to the other end, creating a "tunnel."  Stuff the spinach mixture into the center with the back of a wooden spoon.)  Then I wrap in plastic wrap and take it with me on weekend getaways or to family affairs.  It's always a big hit!

This was delicious! I marinated the pork overnight with the olive oil, rosemary, garlic, S&P. I cut slits all aorund the pork,which got all the flavors inside!!
I browned it on all sides then put it in the crock pot with the white wine and a drizzle of Olive oil. I put it on High for 6 hours & it came out perfect!
I made a gravy from the juices using corn starch, cold water, and some chicken stock..whisked it on a high heat until it got thick....it was YUMMY!! My husband loved it and so did everyone else!!! THANKS for this great recipe!

WOW! This was my first attempt at a pork roast and it couldn't have been easier. I had a 3.5lb center cut loin, so I doubled the oil and herb mixture. I also added thyme and basil. I put a little bit of white wine and water into the bottom of the roasting pan and scattered sweet onion slices and baby carrots all over. I placed the loin on the roasting rack and tucked sliced red skin potatoes all around. I sealed the pan with foil and roasted it for two hours without basting. It came out AMAZINGLY moist and perfectly done. I added some salt and pepper to the pan liquids (there was A LOT) and thickened it up to make a delicious gravy. I will most def use this again! Thanks!

Well, Hubs was not at all thrilled last night when I told him we were having roasted pork loin.  He much prefers pork tenderloin.  I used a 2 lb. 4 oz. roast.  I made the paste with the garlic, about 2 T. fresh rosemary, salt and pepper, and just enough olive oil to bind it together.  I did not pierce the roast.  I just rubbed the paste mixture all over it.  I roasted this uncovered, and really didn’t have enough drippings to baste it, so I skipped that.  I used a remote thermometer, which is perfect for this kind of thing.  I roasted this to 145 degrees, which took a little over an hour, tented it, and let it rest for 10 minutes while I made the gravy.  For the gravy I used the little bit of drippings I had (maybe 2 T.), 1/2 cup each chicken broth and white wine, 2 T. of flour, and salt and pepper.   This was perfectly moist and Hubs declared this the BEST pork loin I have ever made.  He even wants to have it again!  That says it all - five stars!!

I thought that this was okay... The rosemary provided some flavor but I didn't feel that there was enough flavor to want to go back for seconds.

I've made this twice for my family, and they absolutely love it.  One caution--I think the cooking time is over stated.  My 4 pound boneless pork loin was ready in an hour and a half--it would have been dry had I left it longer.  Easy, delicious, healthy--I served it with roasted potatoes and fresh broccoli, fruit salad and home made wheat rolls.  Awesome.

Very good if you like rosemary and garlic. We really enjoyed it. For those of you who said it came out dry, you need to remove the roast from the oven when the temperature is around 135 or 140 at the most. Then, tent it with aluminum foil and let it rest for at least ten minutes to let the juices reabsorb. The residual heat will continue to cook the roast and it should reach an internal temp of 145. Anything more than that and it will be dry.

I used a 1.8 lb. loin and I cut down the cooking time to 1:15. I used slightly less rosemary, more gahlic and omitted the wine for health reasons.  I happened to have a nice bottle of garlic infused extra virgin olive oil that I used also.  Put it in a plastic bag and marinate for a few hours.  This is a wonderful recipe!  I thank the original poster.

Wow!  I made a paste out of fresh garlic, fresh rosemary, fresh sage and some sea salt and put that into the pockets of the loin.  Then I added some olive oil to the remaining paste and rubbed that over the loin.  I put some potatoes and rings of onions in the same pot.  I used a LeCreuset dutch oven with the cover on for 1 hour and turned the roast over and kept uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.  I didn't have white wine, and I think because I had kept the cover on for the majority of the cooking time, there were natural juices in the pot, so we put those over our dinner.  This was the best pork loin I have ever eaten.

A handy tip for really tender pork....soak the entire thing in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours beforehand in a deep bowl of extremely salty water (too salty to taste). I add about 1 cup of salt and a cup or 2 of white vinegar and enough water to cover the roast entirely. I also add quartered onions, minced garlic, pepper, bay leaf and rosemary. This 'bath' infuses into the meat and tenderizes it so you will have a gorgeous moist roast as an end result. It makes a lot of tasty pan juices too so you may need to empty some out into a dish to save for making gravy later. A halved onion placed into the roasting dish adds flavour to the juices aswell. The juices will be rather salty though so be sure to add a bland thickener like cornflour (not Gravox) and some water to tone it down and taste/adjust as you go. It's best to buy a boneless roast too because mine had the bone still in and it proved rather difficult to cut...not very elegant slices. This was my first ever attempt at making a pork roast and my dinner guests raved about it and asked for my husband's secret "pork bath" technique. It's not a secret anymore now!

This is soooo tender & juicy.  WOW!  I used chicken broth instead of the wine.  I do have a comment about the cook time, I used my corning ware & on average, whatever I make in a corning ware dish usually takes about an hour longer to cook.  So maybe that is the reason that some had a problem with dryness using the 2 hour cook time.  I also used common sense & stuck a meat thermometer in the roast.  This was a good roast, thanks Kathleen!

Wonderful!  My husband is not a fan of pork and even HE loved it!   
  As suggested by another review, I marinated the pork in the olive oil/rosemary/garlic mixture overnight.  Then I put a layer of thin sliced onions in the bottom of the crock pot.   I added the pork, marinade, a can of chicken broth (in place of the wine) and potato wedges.  It cooked on high while I was at work (mine cooked 10 hours).  The meat was so tender, you didn't need a knife.   
This was wonderful.  I will definitely cook this again!

I made a few changes and it is still great. I first rub olive oil over the entire loin, rubthe loin with rosemary,thyme and garlic, salt and pepper to taste, then sear the rost on all sides. Place the roast in a glass baking dish and add a wine of your taste to the dish. Bake at 350 for 40-45 min. or until the thermoter reads 150 then let the loin rest for 5 min. or until the temp is 160. Turns out great every time and the loin is juicy and very tasty.

Yum! I made this tonight and I thought it was easy and delicious.  I took it out at 155 degrees and let it sit for ten minutes before slicing and it was so moist.  I also skipped the wine and made a gravy out of the pan drippings and some water and flour, and it was wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I wanted to try something new and since my mom came to visit, I thought this would be nice. I was wrong. IT WAS GREAT! I paired it with rice and a veggie and used the same wine I used in the recipe to go along. Mom was impressed, hubby was full and I am a satisfied kitchen-witch!

Very moist & FULL of taste!  Made it for my husband for valentines day! Here's some tips!

1.) Always use your meat thermometer, if your loin is not moist, you probably overcooked it, all ovens and bake times vary...you paid good money for your meat, so cook accordingly!  If you buy a loin that is packaged as one, but opens into two, Seperate them & roast side bey side. Stick the thermometer in the largest lion.  I always take mine out at 165 degrees.
2.)  I used Sherry as my wine.  I poured the sherry in the pan with my loin, and afterwards added a little chicken stock and cornstarch for EXCELLENT gravy!!!
3.)  While you have out the Sherry, reduce some mushrooms in Sherry, YUM!

This is a recipe that is too tasteful and easy to pass up!!!!

We were very anxious to try this recipe considering the quantity of good reviews.  I took it out early so it was not overcooked.  The family was not impressed at all, even my husband did not have seconds.  I ended up making chicken gravy for the kids to cover the flavor to get them to eat the roast!  We are mystified by the rave reviews... now the same recipe with a beef rib roast is to die for!

Followed "andeesings" suggestions: Seared the roast (but on stove-top) in a cast-iron Dutch oven. Followed another & lined the bottom with thin-sliced onions. Still another suggested some sherry in the bottom. I can't resist sherry & onions! Threw it in the oven & turned it every 20 minutes, checking each time with the Thermo-pen. It came out amazingly juicy & flavorful! I didn't bother with gravy, since I was serving it with saffron rice (YUM!), with peas, but I did pull the beautifully browned & flavored onions out, to top the pork slices. The wife said that she doesn't want to go to restaurants anymore... be careful what you wish for!!! Thank you Kathleen Burton & AllRecipes!

12/25/15 - Did this again, with a 1-3/4 lb loin roast, but on the rotisserie, over the grill (78 F, on Christmas Day, in Va. Beach... YAY!) Replaced rosemary with fresh basil, this time (YUM). Grilled 10 min over direct heat, to sear, then 40-50 min over indirect heat, on the rotisserie, 'til it got to 145 F. It came out beautiful! No wine sauce or onions, this time, but the pork was PERFECT!

Made this on the pellet smoker last night and it was awesome!  Loo-oove garlic in my pork roasts!  We bought some of those Costco Pork Sirloin Tip Roasts for $1.99/lb.  Will definitely do this again.  Plan to use the leftovers in a cuban pork pineapple taco (Rachel Ray recipe).

I used chicken stock instead of wine, but this recipe is fantastic!  Can't give it enough stars.  I actually mixed the rosemary, s & p, and garlic together, drizzled a little oil and rubbed the loin down, than rubbed again with garlic mixture and let marinate covered in fridge a couple of hours.

Really, really good.  I used 1 Tbls salt which I think was just a little too much.  I thought the Rosemary was a little strong too.  The garlic was also strong.  So, my husband and I slurped up the whole thing!  I'm kidding.  Well, there was a little left!  Actually, I will ease up on the salt and rosemary next time but everything else will remain the same.  I did a pork tenderloin which was two pieces, each weighting about one lb.  I baked for the first hour covered and removed the foil for the second hour.  I had lots of juices in the pan, so I removed the tenderoins to a platter and covered with foil to rest.  I reduced the juices and added the wine.  I sliced the tenderloins and added them back to the bubbling juices and reduced the heat so it could simmer for about 5 minutes.  Yum.  Anxious to try again.

This is an easy and fabulous recipe. However, 2 hours at 350 is way too long to cook a 2 pound roast. I baked it at 325 for 1.5 hours and it came out moist and delicious. I used a whole can of beef broth instead of wine and I added it from the start instead of at the end.

When I made this the first time I did it in the oven but forgot to do the white wine step. It was ok. The second time I made it, it had do be done in time for 5-o'clock company, so I put it in the crockpot during my lunch hour and cooked it on high all afternoon. With a little vegetable broth (didn't have wine) on the bottom, the result was falling-apart tender and flavorful. The garlic and olive oil rub really made the difference from previous times I've done a loin in the crockpot. Very good and simple!

What a terrific recipe!
First, I've browned the loin on the skillet, until deep golden brown color
2) I used fresh rosemary, finely chopped to mix with garlic, and also left 2 pieces whole to put on top while making it.. be sure to leave 1 fresh stem, to garnish once prepared
3) I used coarse sea salt, fresh ground pepper...first large and fine ground
4) olive oil first cold press
5) i made a 5 pound loin, cut into 2 pieces. cooking time was approx 1h25min @ 350...the last 10 mins were at 375. I used thermometer, and set the meat out to rest for 10 minutes at 160 degrees.
6) gravy, i used yellow tail Riesling, and it turned out great...

served with cubed potatoes, mixed with butter, a tad of olive oil, and freshly chopped parsley - a must have if you haven't already tried!

meat was tender. Both my wife and mother-in-law had seconds, and licked their fingers!

I wouldn't change anything for next time!

enjoy!

DELICIOUS!  I cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low and it was so juicy...I added a little flour after removing the roast and made gravy but it was so moist, we didn't really need it.

I made this tonight w/a couple of adjustments.  My pork loin was 4.5lbs so I browned all sides in a skillet, then made the deep cuts, put the garlic, rosemary (I used fresh fm my yard)added some soft butter and lemon zest.  I doubled the sauce and covered the pork in the remainder and poured olive oil on top.  After 45 minutes in the oven I covered it in white wine and chicken stock.  When the pork was done I took the pan juices, put them in the original browning skillet and added flour to thinken.  Even my 4, 5, and 7 year olds ate it and loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good and moist but reduced cooking time. It only took 45 minutes for it to come to temperatures. The 2 hours seems over kill for a 2lbs roast.

I used fresh chopped rosemary (double the amount), mixed it with crushed garlic and olive oil, then rubbed over tenderloin.  Added salt & pepper and put in crock pot with white wine.  Cooked for 8 hrs., then thickened juices with cornstarch before serving.  Fabulous and so easy!

A hint for stuffing herb paste into the cuts on a roast:  cut little x's instead of just slits - much easier!  I did make some changes.  I added a tsp. of thyme as suggested by several reviewers.  I also put about a tsp of the wine into the paste.  I poured the wine into the pan while it was roasting, and quarted some small onions and set them around the roast.  The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy.

So yummy and full of flavor!! Made the following adjustments for a 4 lb. pork loin: 8 cloves garlic, 3 tablespoons fresh rosemary, 2 tsp. kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. dried thyme (didn't have fresh), and enough olive oil to form a paste. I mashed it all up with a mortar and pestle, rubbed it all over the pork and marinated it in a large plastic bag for 3 hours. It took 2.5 hours (165 degrees internal temp) to cook. FANTASTIC!

My girlfriend Amber and I borrowed a boneless pork loin (2 lbs. trimmed) from her grandmother! So we searched the web and came across this recipe. We critiqued the recipe somewhat and the cooking time according to the cut of pork. The result was fantastic! We used a little bit of bacon grease for the rub and used fresh rosemary not dry. We also basted several times throughout the roasting process and did not turn the meat at all. The result FIVE STARS!!!!!

I used a 4.5 pound double top loin, separated into two pieces side by side.  I doubled the rest of the ingredients accordingly.   At 1 hour and 45 minutes the temperature was already at 160 so I immediately took it out.  The pork was moist and delicious even though I let it cook just a little too long.  I think it was a little heavy on the rosemary and olive oil, but the garlic was just right.  The strong rosemary taste and aroma was fine for the first meal, but it didn't work so well for leftover sandwiches.  Overall this is an easy and quick recipe worth repeating.

Rosemary and garlic was  tasty combo with the pork.  Due to time restrictions i browned the pork on the stove and then placed it in the crock pot on low with the garlic, rosemary, wine, some chicken broth and some chopped onion.   I cooked a 2.5 lb roast for 6.5 hrs, and i over cooked it a bit.   Was probably done about 5- 6hrs.   I made a homemade gray from the crock pot juices to have over the pork and mashed potatoes.  A perfect meal for a cold rainy evening.  (Next time i won't over cook the pork and it will be even better ;)  )

Flavorful and tender!!  Followed the advice from the reviewer who's review was the "most helpful."  Put the garlic, olive oil, rosemary, salt and pepper in the blender to make the paste.  After putting some in roast, rubbed the remaining on roast and marinated it over night.  Also used carrots, onion and celery and put a little wine and chicken stock in bottom of pan.

One of my fave pork recipes. To make a really good paste, try using a mortar & pestle. It will grind everything smooth & combine the herbs with the oil better.

I followed a review, rather than the recipe. What I did was I grated 4 cloves of garlic, added 1-1/2 teaspoons of rosemary and a 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a ziploc bag with the loin. I refridgerated for 2-4 hours and baked at 350 for 1 hour and 45 minutes. No searing was needed. It came out crispy on the outside and was PERFECTLY moist on the inside! Hubby enjoyed it, so it's a keeper.

An easy and tasty pork roast, though I am glad I did listen to the previous reviews and reduced the cooking time--about 1 hr 15 minutes for 2+ pound roast.  Served with rosemary potatoes that I cooked in the same oven as the roast (less time) and green beans.  Made sandwiches with apricot preserve spread with the leftovers.

Quite yummy! I didn't really follow the recipe by the letter. In a blender, I put some olive oil in the bottom of it. I have a large blender, but it was just enough to cover the blades, then I added about 2 tbs of minced garlic and I have fresh rosemary growing in my kitchen window, and I took two long sprigs and removed the leaves and tossed those in to. I used 1/2 tsp of pepper and we don't use salt in this house. I whirred it all up together until it was a green goo. It didn't look great, but it sure smelled great! I have a Deni 45 blade Meat Tenderizer (considerably cheaper than the one Alton Brown recommends), so I used that all over the pork. I thought at the time, "This is a great cut and won't need it." I was right, but the flavor it added! More on that in a minute. I then poured the green goo into a plastic bag, I put the heavily blade-punched pork in, squeezed out the air and kneaded it all over and stuck it in the refrigerator for about two hours. I took it out, placed it in a glass baking dish with only a smidgeon of water in the bottom and did nothing else. My roast was 3 1/2 lbs, and was ready in 1 1/2 hours (this came straight out of the refrigerator too, so the timing in the recipe is definitely off, but the blades could have influenced that change). One taste and WOW! That blade punch thingy spread that flavor throughout the meat. I didn't use the wine and I didn't make any gravy. It simply wasn't needed. My family LOVED it. It's a sure win!

i had a small roast, only about 1.5 lbs and seared it in my dutch oven w/ the olive oil. I used fresh rosemary from my garden and followed the other instructions as written. About 2 hrs in the oven at 350 with the lid on the dutch oven...delicious!!!

This turned out fabulous.  My boys were raving before I even got the last plate dished up.  The only change I made was to mix garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper together and stuff it all into the holes I cut.  OMG!  It was fantastic!

I made this exactly as directed.  The flavor was great.  The meat was fork tender.  10 out of 10 people loved it.  I lined my pan with foil but wish I had not.  I think I would have had tastier drippings if I had not lined the pan.

I usually put the roast on a rack in a shallow pan (about 2" sides).  I preheat the oven to 425 degrees Farenheit, cook the roast for 20 minutes (regardless of size), then add 1" boiling water to the pan, reduce heat to 350 degrees, and cook an hour and 15 minutes longer.  Test with instant read meat thermometer - if it's 153-155 or higher, remove from oven, tent loosely with foil, and let sit for at least 15 minutes.  I don't use a paste, I just sprinkle with granulated garlic and seasoned salt.  This roast is so delicious!

I used a 3 pound pork loin and followed the recipe *almost* exactly (I always hate when people say they followed the recipe exactly and then proceed to tell you that they left out the chicken in the chicken parmesan!).  I covered the roast for most of the cooking time (1 hour 45 minutes) and then  raised the temperature on the oven to 425 and cooked it for another 15 minutes without the covering.  I have a convection oven, which I always use when roasting meats.  

In the end, this was really wonderful.  It is EASY, and the flavor made it seem like it took forever to prepare.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was restaurant quality, we roasted some potatoes in the same pan, for the whole 2 hours, it was soooo good, with steamed broccoli on the side. We also basted it with 1 cup of chicken broth.

Wonderful recipe Kathleen, and the aroma when it was cooking made my guests feel so welcome! I used a bit more of the crushed garlic that is all prepared in a jar, and I didn't have wine, but used apple juice and it was great.Will definately do this one again! Thanks.

Wanted something different for Thanksgiving. This turned out wonderful and got rave reviews from family. The only thing I change was to put the roast is a oven bag. This  recipe will be a permanent in our home. It was a 2 1/2 lb roast and only took 1 1/2 hour to be done.

Great recipe.  Really easy and very good.  Next time I make this, I think I'll double the garlic paste to give the roast that much more flavor.

This was fantastic!  My new favorite way to make pork.  It was so tender and flavorful my guests loved it.  I did let it sit for several hours with the garlic and rosemary, and forgot to do the wine gravy.  It didn't need it!  It was good anyway!  Will definately cook again!

Very nice! I didn't have rosemary, so I left it out...still wonderful! The wine sauce was a pleasant change from a thick gravy. Blended some in the food processor with sweet potatoes and orange juice for my 9-month old...he loved it!

I thought this turned out nicely. It was moist and flavorful. Once I applied the paste, I let it marinate in the fridge for around three hours. I used about a tablespoon of fresh rosemary, but I wish I had used more. My roast was around five pounds, so it did take longer--closer to 1 1/2 hours.

This was absolutely delicious. I had a 2 lb. top loin and roasted it for an hour at 325, then switched over to convection at 350 for 30 minutes to crisp it up. This really was yummy - moist, flavorful - and we'll have leftovers to slice thin with mustard and a slice of onion for sandwiches tomorrow.

I decided to make this for Sunday dinner, and was a little worried about not having the time to marinate in advance, based on other reviews. There was no need for worry. The pork was tender and flavorful and the sauce was delicious. It paired well with roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli and rated a 'thumbs up' from the family. I used fresh rosemary (3 tablespoons based on another reviewer) and less olive oil than called for.

Very good and simple.  Used fresh rosemary.  FYI unlike most herbs, fresh rosemary is very strong and so you use less than what is called for dry.  I threw in some carrots, potatoes and onions into the covered pot as well, coating it with the same oil mix.  The wine sauce at the end really was that extra special touch that made this dish stand out.  I think that next time I'll add the wine to the pot and let it cook in it the whole time.

Excellent Pork Loin recipe! I nuked the olive oil, crushed garlic and fresh minced rosemary for about a minute. The garlic disolved into the oil, which I then separated from the rosemary and injected into the pork. The remaining rosemary/oil was rubbed on the roast and stuffed between the two loins that I tied together with roasting twine. I also dusted the roast with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and fresh ground black pepper. Very moist and flavorful!

We did not like this at all which was surprising because it gets such great reviews. The roast itself tasted good and it was tender however the rosemary was just awful and overpowering.

We will probably try this again but using our own blend of spices.

My mouth is watering! I used the basics of this recipe, but I decided to stuff it with minced garlic, onion and herbs, then added a bed of onions, green beans, red potatoes and carrots to the pan, covered for 2 1/2 hour at 320 degrees. The meat falls apart, and melts in your mouth!

Generally, I don't like a lot of pork and I had never made any until last night.  This recipe was so good, I think I may have changed my mind about pork!

Using the suggestions of others, I made the paste, applied it to the loin, and let it marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours.  When I baked the loin, I added the wine to the pan only because it was really lean and I thought it needed a little liquid.

The finished product was moist, very flavorful, and delicious.  My husband loved it!  Last night, I thought there might be a little too much rosemary for me but I had some for lunch today and didn't notice the extra at all.  Next time I might brown it first before putting it in to roast only because I like the look better.  The taste was fabulous with out the browning.

This is a wonderful recipe, very easy, and I felt great about serving it.

We really enjoyed this!  Served with twice baked sweet potatoes & green beans.  
I ssed 1/2 of the rosemary & olive oil (and added thyme) to "stuff" inside slits in the roast; then salted & peppered the meat, and used the other 1/2 of olive oil/rosemary/thyme mixture and created a paste to rub on the roast.  Also used 1 more garlic clove to stuff in slits on the roast.  Let this sit overnite, then poured the white wine over the pork, and roasted accordingly at 350 until the pork was done.  
Tips -- use a meat thermometer to determine doneness; use fresh herbs (make a huge difference!); and let the meat rest before cutting & serving.
Thanks for sharing!  Super easy & really tasty.

This was fabulous! I am a new cook; learning mostly from reading reviews from allrecipes and trying different things, and this was great! I used a 3lb boneless Rib End Roast (also called a Blade Roast)and tried to increase the other ingredients by 50% since it was a bigger piece of meat. I also baked it covered for 20 extra minutes, and let it sit for 15 minutes before cutting into it. It was really good: my husband who will eat anything but takes alot to be impressed, said it was better than something he'd get in a restaurant. The only thing I'll do different next time is use a little less olive oil.

This was so easy and fantastic tasting.  I used a meat thermometer and it only took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook a two pound roast.  I covered it for the first hour to keep it moist.  Great served with boiled red potatoes.

Easy, quick, and delicious.  PLEASE use a reliable meat thermometer.... my 2.75# roast only took 1.75 hours to cook.... temps and shape of roast affect cooking, and by using the thermometer, my roast was juicy, flavorful, and *not* dried out at all.  I had to use minced garlic from a jar as I was out of fresh, and it was still yummy.

I tweeked this recipe by using leaf marjoram with the garlic and salt/pepper, making enough to accomodate a 2# or so pork loin roast, using a food chopper to incorporate the garlic, marjoram, salt and pepper. I scored both sides of the roast, rubbed in my seasonings and wrapped it in plastic wrap and marinated it in the fridge over night. I browned it and then put it in my pressure cooker/with water, a little more salt and onions for one hour. It turned out great. Marjoram, garlic and pork go very well together as most Polish people will attest to as they use this combo in making Polish sausage. I also rubbed my marjoram before adding it to the garlic to bring out the flavor.

This is a simple and delicious way to make a roast...I prefer thyme to rosemary, which works just as well...the leftovers made great pork fried rice the next day.

Smelled excellent while cooking, but the rosemary was too coarse.  I found myself scraping it off the meat while I ate it because it is bitter to taste and felt like I was eating twigs.

Summary,
Good flavor, but terrible texture.  I would place the rosemary in a mesh bag and place it in the sauce to get the flavor but not the pieces.

Modified a little by using rosemary and tyme along with fresh roasted garlic and rubbing it down with it. I went by a thermometer vs cooking it for 2 hours so that it wouldn't come out dry! Came out very juicy and wonderful!!~

Delicious and easy.  I used a big pork roast that I cut into thirds and used about 2 lbs of it.  Much cheaper and now I can make it two more times!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but used some suggestions from other reviewers.  I rubbed the roast with a salt and pepper mixture then made a paste with the olive oil, fresh rosemary, garlic, and more salt and pepper.  I cut into the top several times and mushed in some paste, then rubbed the rest of it all over.  I put it in a Baggie in the fridge for an hour or two until I was ready to cook it.  I seared all sides in a Dutch oven, put in some homemade turkey stock left over from thanksgiving and popped it in the oven.  It was up to 150 in 1 1/4 hours.  Then I added the wine, a little bit of corn starch, and added some sautéed mushrooms to make a yummy gravy.  Yum yum yum!

Delicious!   Followed recipe exactly - rating it on that (hint to those who make changes, then rate.)
DH loved it, had seconds, but I warned him the rest would be his lunch the next day, so if he polished it off, there would be no lunch.  Ever see a 6'7", 350# tattooed biker pout? 
Boiled cut up small red potatoes, and made corn.
BTW - DH said it was even better the next day!

Tried this recipe last night and it was delicious. Doubled the paste and placed onion rings under the roast while cooking. Added some white wine and apple juice to keep the drippings from burning. Took it out at 145 degrees. It was moist and no pink to be seen. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderfully tender pork loin.  I did not have rosemary but substituted dried ground fennel seed.  I sautéed sliced fennel root and onion until almost caramelized and added them to wine and pan juiced and let them reduce a bit.  It was wonderful.  I even sliced, added sauce and froze- reheated a month later and still wonderful.  Hubby is heating leftovers for breakfast. I think this is going to be a guest dish.

So easy and so delicious!  Only change was 5-6 garlic cloves.  Used fresh ground pepper.  Wife loved it!   Wallet-wise; pork loin was 1.99 a pound!   Why make a hamburger at 5.99 pound when you can have this masterpiece and a good memory!

I cooked this loin in a roaster oven with vegetables. I placed baby carrots (about a pound), chopped potatoes (about 2 pounds), 2 chopped onions, and a couple of chopped garlic cloves tossed with olive oil on the bottom of the roaster and then placed the pork with the rub on top. I had to cook the pork loin 70 minutes, perhaps it took longer because of the extra ingredients, but I used to meat thermometer to check for doneness. I removed everything from the roaster when the meat was at the proper temperature and then made the sauce according to the recipe. The meat came out tender and with a deliciously savory rub, and the vegetables were a wonderful accompaniment. I reheated the meat three times for subsequent meals and it still was tender and savory.

My roast had the bone in and was very thick so my cooking time was increased by 1 hour!! But if you use the thermometer after the first hour, you won't go wrong!! I took it out at 130 degrees ish ( closer to 135) and wrapped it in the foil with the white wine and let it sit for 30 minutes!! EXCELLENTE!!!

I liked this recipe, but next time I would brown the roast in hot oil before putting it in the oven to bake. Browning makes it look a little more appetizing and also adds to the flavor. The flavor of the rosemary was very nice; I think I'd increase both that and the garlic a little bit next time. We put potatoes, onions, and carrots into the roasting pan along with the meat and really loved that combo.

I followed one of the previous reviewers suggestion using crushed fresh garlic 3 cloves, dry rosemary and some Olive Oil, and made a paste letting it rest for a couple of hours.  Next time I will let it sit overnight.  I also put garlic slivers throughout the roast.  I had a 4.20 lb roast and cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  Turned out awesome.  served with mashed potatoes, the gravy from the drippings, and baked carrots.  Fresh carrots sliced put in foil, with some water, butter and sliced onions baked the last 45 minutes, the carrots are sweet and just perfect.

I made this with 2.5 pound pork loin and it came out great. After reading the previous reviews, I actively monitored the temps and it was done closer to 1.5 hours. This will be going into my monthly menu rotation.

My family loved this! Surrounded my 1.97lb. pork loin  roast with 3 red potatoes, 2 parsnips, 1 rutabaga, and 3 carrots. Basted all every 20 mins. Done in 1.5 hours. I thought the 1/4c. olive oil would be too much, but it worked out great. Internal temp was 168 degrees when I pulled it out of the oven. Moist Moist, and did I say MOIST! Definitely use this recipe again.

I placed roughly sliced onions the the bottom of the pan, using them to "prop up" the roast. I poured about 3/4 inch of chicken broth into the pan as well, with the onions. I served the onions with dinner. I skipped the wine step.

This was my very first pork roast that was not dry! It was so tender and juicy. THANK YOU!!! I turned the oven off 15 mins before the end and let it sit for about 30 mins - wonderful!

Nice and easy but takes a while.  Instead of dried rosemary, we used fresh rosemary and sage, and for 2.5 pounds, it only needed an hour and a half to cook.  We also browned the whole outside first, and poured ~1/2 cup of wine in to the skillet while it was in the oven to add some extra flavor.

Overpowering is all that comes to mind of this dish. The rosemary flavor was so strong I still have an aversion to rosemary 2 months after making this.  The meat was very tender on the upside, but my husband agreed this recipe just was not for us.

This dish was great! I had a 2.9 lb roast and nearly doubled the garlic and rosemary. Also added some basil. The amount of herbs/spices used really depends on the person, I used A LOT of garlic! I stuffed the slits with the mixture but also rubbed the whole roast til it was well coated. Added baby carrots and sweet onion slices and covered with wine. I probably used a cup of wine total. The roast cooked for about 1 hr 45 minutes and it came out very moist and tender. I just kept drizzling the wine sauce over the roast about every 20 minutes. My house smelled amazing!! I will definitely be making this again.

This is our favorite recipe for pork. It just doesn't get much better than this. The first time I made this, I forgot the wine.. it was so incredible, I've never bothered to add it since. Other than that, I make it as directed, but I use fresh rosemary, instead of dried. I usually make the paste and insert in the roast (be sure not to skip that step, it makes all the difference), then place in the frig for at least an hour before roasting. Absolutely marvelous.. thanks for sharing!

This truly was an easy and excellent meal. I would recommend marinating the pork for a few hours (just to make the delicious flavors of garlic and rosemary even more, well . . . delicious). Also, I always cook pork until its internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F - then I let it rest for ten minutes - its internal temperature will reach at least 170 degrees F. For a 2.5 lb roast this amounts to one hour and fifteen minutes at 350 degrees F. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making my pork roasts like this for many years except I use parsley instead of rosemary and corn oil instead of olive oil. I also marinate the pork loin in all the ingredients for a least 3 hours or overnight. This is one of my families favorite ways to eat pork!

The roast was full of flavor and very juicy.  Like many others have written, watch the roasting time.  Ours was done in about 75 minutes.

This was very good, but I didn't use enough salt.  "To taste" is so vague, I wish there had been a measurement.  We accompanied this with Roasted Potatoes with Greens from this site and they were perfect go togethers.  I'll likely do the roast pork again, with more generous amounts of salt.

I've made this a few times, once as written and a couple of times with a few minor adjustments... First, I use fresh rosemary and double the amount (if I have it on hand). Second, I combine the olive oil, rosemary and garlic in a glass bowl and gently warm it in the microwave to infuse the flavors and "open" the rosemary a bit. Then I massage it all over the pork loin, pop it in a plastic bag, add the wine and also a little bit or lemon zest. I marinate it for a few hours before cooking. It always turns out delicious. Very yummy and easy and a nice change from chicken.

P.S. Two hours is way, way too long, unless you're aiming to make some kind of jerky. :o)

Outstanding! I followed suggestions of others to add a little wine to the pan as the roast cooked, and basting with pan juices regularly.

I used a whole boneless pork loin (8 lbs) and essentially only doubled the garlic, rosemary , and tripled the wine and had plenty of seasoning and glaze. I also used fresh rosemary, one of the best plants to keep in a pot at home. After the deglazing of the roasting pan with wine, I poured the glaze into a sauce pan and reduced it by half. Amazingly delicious!

This recipe turned out awful. That is unless you like the taste of hay!!! It took far longer to reach temp than stated, the meat was dry, there was far too much rosemary, and the sauce was gross. I followed the recipe perfectly and even thought my husband and I aren't picky eaters, we couldn't stomache the taste! Sorry.

Of all the recipes I've rated here, this is the first one I've given 5 stars to. It's easy, relatively quick (you can go do other things while it's roasting) and comes out delicious. My leftovers were gone by the next morning. I left out the wine, but plain water worked just fine. I added some chopped onions and mushrooms to the roast's casserole dish then reduced the liquid in the pan while the roast rested, then added a little corn starch/water mixture to thicken. Very good.

Very very tender; I omitted the wine sauce and trusted a meat thermometer over just letting the roast sit in the oven for two hours. Mine was cooked through in a little over an hour and fifften minutes.

The seasonings for this were wonderful!!!  I cooked this in a slow cooker instead - on low for 6 hours.  I added cut up red potatoes and baby carrots to the pot - then covered with additional white wine and chicken broth.

This was fantastic!  The garlic was pungent but not overpowering, and the spices were just right.  Note that I did not use rosemary, instead I used oregano, and got many compliments when I served this at a family get-together.  Make sure you don't overcook the pork since it drys out quickly.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was very tender and tasty.  Very good mix of garlic and rosemary.  I made a paste of the oil, garlic,salt,pepper and rosemary then put it on the roast.  I also browned the roast before putting it in the oven to sear it.

This is the 3rd time I have made this.It has been perfect every time. Tonight it is for my best friend and roomate for his birthday. I usually use a larger roast. I always check the time early so it does not overcook. We love rosemary so I always use extra. I don't turn it and it still works fine. I take it out at 140 degrees and tent it. The temp rises a bit more and it is wonderful and very juicy. 160 degrees will dry it out. Guidelines for temp are no longer 160 degrees (unless you like it that way). Great recipe!!!

I made this recipe because it was simple with few ingredients.  I'm a true believer of simplicity in cooking, and this one fit the bill.  What a nice dinner we had-it was a huge hit with my family.  Moist and easy to make, and I will make it again and again.

This was really good. Took the advice of some reviewers and marinated the loin for a few hours in the paste.... But also slit pockets into the meat and added the "paste" in those as well.  Cooked on 325 degrees until 145 degrees internal temp. The gravy was really good... Made a roux from butter and flour, added the drippings along with some beef bouillon.  Was very tasty... Will make again and again.  It's a good pork loin recipe.

So simple, but delicious.  I had to use red wine because it's all I had, but I won't even try it with white wine because it was so good with red

Good flavor - then again, we love garlic & rosemary so I wasn't exactly taking a chance with this recipe.  I marinated the loin in a ziploc bag for a few hours prior to baking as another suggested.

We loved this; however I did alter it a small amount. Instead of poking holes in the pork I simply cut it in an X shape leaving only one side open and closed it with skewers because Pork is a dense meat and hard to add seasoning to if it's not thin, this allowed me to season the entire loin inside and out. I also added a good amount of Royal Hawaiian Seasoning to the recipe and served it with the wine sauce over it.  I did not measure the ingredients. I just used what I thought would cover the size of meat I had. I simply can't have pork anymore without Royal Hawaiian Seasoning. You can make the best grilled pork chops ever just generously adding that seasoning to them and tossing them on the grill. I will definitely add this to my monthly recipes!

I made this recipe tonight and it was good. My husband ate it all so that's a good sign. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the amount of rosemary and garlic. I also added onions, red potatoes, baby carrots, chicken broth and sriracha sauce to add a little kick. I added one tsp of ground pepper and salt. I like my meats a little salty so I felt it needed some more salt. I would make it again.

Absolutely fantastic recipe.  Made it with fresh rosemary and added a little cajun spice.  Put some potatoes and onions in the pan with the white wine and cooked it all together.  Added a little chicken broth about 1 hours in.  Reduced the cooking time as other reviewers stated.  The pork loin was almost 3 lbs and cook perfectly in 1-1/2 hours.  Thanks for the recipe...the flavor was amazing!

I seasoned the pork with the salt & pepper first and then I put the olive oil mixture on top.  I didn't really stuff the paste into the pork -- everything just sat on the surface.  I did poke holes in the pork so some of the olive oil mixture may have dripped through.  I also used  3TBL of fresh rosemary instead of dried.  I poured the wine over the pork and put it in the oven for about 1.5 hours.  Came out nice and juicy.  I bought lean pork so there wasn't any fat drippings -- I wasn't really able to make any gravy to go on top which my dish was definitely lacking.  Otherwise, it was a good dish.

Delicious! I added lemon zest, and cooked two 1 pound loins side by side in a 9 x 13 baking dish. It only took 40 minutes to hit 155, so be careful! I threw them on the grill for 2 minutes/side after they came out of the oven for an extra dose of flavor. Great recipe!

This pork loin turned out excellent.  It looked dry & overcooked when it was finally finished (1.5 hrs. for 2 lb. loin) but it wasn't, it was delicious!  I used about 2 Tbsp. olive oil & added 1 tsp. dried thyme for added flavor.  I also used about 4 Tbsp. minced garlic (in the jar) & pressed it into the slits I pierced all over the loin.  Careful on the salt;  a little goes a long way on this for some reason  & I'm a huge salt lover.  There was only maybe 1/2 C. drippings in the pan - certainly not enough to "baste".  Instead, I flipped it over every 30 minutes.  I mixed the drippings in with a gravy (packet) I made for mashed potatoes.  It really added to the flavor of the gravy.  One last thing:  be sure to let the loin sit for at least 5 minutes before slicing it.  Otherwise, all the juice will pour out & you'll have a big, dry, disappointing piece of meat, regardless of how fabulous the recipe is.  Once bitten, twice shy.

I tripled the garlic, used 1.5 T of rosemary because I had a 4 3/4lb roast.  I didn't have white wine and debated going back to the store to get it but didn't.  I threw this together, rubbed the top with remaining paste mixture then tossed it in the frig to hang out for about 4 hours.  I covered mine with foil and let it cook on 325 (hubby set the temp wrong - ACK!!) for about 2.75 hours.  It was perfect.  My son even commented "Mom, why is this so good???"

My family loves this roast. I made in crock pot and omitted the wine, as the drippings were delicious by itself. (Cooked about 4 hours on high)

I was a little apprehensive about making this recipe because I wasn't entire sure I was going to like it. Boy, was I surprised! This is my new favorite way to roast pork. What's even better is that after the roast is done cooking in the oven, I take chicken or beef broth (whatever I have atm) and take some of the leftover sauce in the pan and make a gravy out of it and it's soooooo amazing. The only thing I did different was not add the wine because I didn't have any at the time and it still came out wonderful.

Way too long to cook a small pork roast.  I cook mine @325 degrees for about an hour and the juices run out of it.  Fully cooked.  Will not make this again.  Was so dry.   Disappointed.

This is a very good recipe for pork loin.  The key is that you MUST use fresh rosemary.  I marinated the pork in garlic/wine/rosemary/olive oil and then put in the oven for about 2 hours, keeping an eye on the internal temp during the last 45 minutes. The meat was very moist and had great flavor.  Definitely a keeper!!

Delicious! I had a 4.5 lb. pork loin that I cut in thirds and browned on all sides. Made the paste with a full bulb of garlic of approx. 12 cloves of varying sizes and fresh rosemary. Probably more than most people would like, but it turned out delicous to me. I put potatoes, carrots, and onions at the bottom of the crock pot and put the roasts on top to marinate overnight. The only problem was the carrots and onions were very mushy after a few hours in the crock pot. I'm guessing from mixing with the olive oil overnight. (I'm still kind of a cooking novice.) Next time I will add those later. Added cut up baby bellas, white wine, chicken broth, and corn starch for a delicious gravy. The roasts turned out very moist and delicious.

I've made this 3 times and it is very good!  I received many compliments from everyone at the table.  I usually let the rub marinate for at least a few hours.  I put a little bit of the white wine in the bottom of the pan as I think that helps it from drying out.  Definitely use a meat thermometer as 2 hrs would be way too long.  Also, cover w/foil for 5-10 min after taking it out of the oven.  That will help it stay moist.  Very good pork roast and will use this recipe in the future!

I would give the pork itself 4 stars, but the sauce was so good that it bumped this dish up to five.  I marinated the pork in the olive oil/garlic/salt and pepper mixture overnight.  As someone suggested, I added about half of the wine to the pan before cooking.  Once it came out of the oven, I added cornstarch, salt and pepper to the pan drippings and the rest of the wine and reduced it by half.  It was great.  I will make it again, but I will probably experiment with different spices .

This was good, but 2 hours is WAY too long - no need to cook the  out of pork the way that our grandmothers used to.  Trichinosis is not an issue anymore the way that pork is farmed. It's very safe to eat pork slightly pink if you'd like.
Definitely use fresh rosemary - the difference is like night and day!

2 hours was definitely too long, even for my roast that was 2.5 pounds. The flavor was good, but the texture of the dry rosemary is a little strange. I think next time I will use fresh rosemary, or throw the garlic and rosemary into a food processor so that it's not as gritty. Overall very good flavor, tonight's dinner was fabulous!

WOW!!! I have never cooked a pork loin properly until this recipe! I took the advice of the others and browned the 2 loins first on the stove after rubbing them with the garlic/rosemary(I did not add oil for this step). I used my Dutch Oven so it was a one pot deal. I then added red cooking wine and a couple Tbsp olive oil (instead of 1/4 cup)to the pot. I checked it every 25 minutes and basted as suggested. I kept it covered the whole time and it took about 1 1/2 hours. It is so flavorful, moist and juicy! I then added a can of veg stock to the drippings while the meat rested and made a very light gravy, thickening with cornstarch. I served this with a shredded brussel sprout dish (from this site), layered with cranberry sauce and long grain rice underneath, gravy on top. Spectacular!!! I was ready to give up on cooking meat until this recipe...thank you so much!

Great recipe.  I actually forgot to buy the wine, so I didn't use it.  I marinated overnight.  Then I put the loin on the grill, for 5 min. on each side, Took it off and wrapped tightly in foil, placed on a sheet and finished up in the oven for 2 hours.  My husband couldn't get enough and even sliced it and ate it cold the next day.  It stays nice and juicy wrapped in the foil while cooking.  Will make this often.  Thanks

My whole family enjoyed this dish.  I put the oil with the spices & minched garlic in my 'mini-blender' to combine everything and just poured in on top of the pork loin which I cooked in my roaster/crock pot  for about 1hr.45min. and it came out great.  The smell is wonderful.  My family likes gravy so after adding the wine to the pan juices my husband added just a little gravy mix and water.  I was a little afraid of the wine over powering the gravy but my kids loved it.  There was a perfect balance of flavors. So easy, few ingredients, no fuss yet delicious.  This recipes stays in my recipe box!

This was delicious!  I roasted some red potatoes (with garlic, rosemary and thyme) in the same pan.  The white wine in the sauce was awesome.  Great flavor!

We used a regular pork loin (not a tenderloin like the picture) & it came out really well.  I used a meat thermometer so didn't follow the 2 hr. baking recommendation (the 2 lb. roast took about 1.5 hrs.).  Will definitely make again.  The pan juices with the white wine were delicious.

This was a wonderful recipe which is now one of my favorites.  The cooking time is only about 1 1/2 hours.  Otherwise it is too dry.

The aroma from the crockpot was unbearable.  Smelled so good, we all couldn't wait to eat.  It wasn't the usual pork smell, thanks to the rosemary and garlic.  We loved it!

Excellent, Tried this with fresh rosemary. I was a bit unsure about cooking pork loin with liquid and was amazed that it didn't dry out. To the contrary, the meat was very tender and moist.

This turned out to be wonderful. I wasn't sure about using rosemary, but it was great. My husband and 5 year old son love it as well. I served it with roasted red potatoes and sauteed spinach. Its is now a family favorite.

I used a whole clove of garlic and we loved the taste.  I did not have wine so we did not make the sauce, but the pork was great even without it.  We will make again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.  :-)

This was really easy, and very good.  I added about two more cloves of garlic, and used garlic flavored olive oil (we like garlic).  Also, I didn't have any white wine, so I used red (merlot) instead, and it was really good.

We had this for dinner tonight and thought it was outstanding!!!!  We grow a lot of fresh herbs and love Rosemary so naturally we loved the tase.  Thanks for sharing Kathleen...and the best part of this recipe was it tasted so great without adding a hint of salt and those are the ones I really look for.

I had 1 1/2 inch slices of pork loin.  Instead of baking, I browned the pork in oil and added all the spices and wine and let simmer for about 20-30 minutes.  The meat was really tender.  I sauteed mushrooms in the leftover sauce.  My husband really enjoyed it!

Beware: the video says to cook for two hours. Don’t! !!!! It will be VERY dry. 

Very tasty. If you don’t have collosal garlic,  it will take more  than 3 cloves to make enough paste.

Delicious! The wine sauce of awesome! I used bone-in pork chops because I didn't have pork loin. Seared in oil for 2 min./side, then baked till temp reached 150.

I couldn't get the garlic and stuff to a "paste" but I rubbed it on, it stayed, and the meat tastes great. Also, I cut a long, shallow slit and stuffed the paste into it. It's so tender ... like a Prime Rib; only a 10th the cost. The white wine to make a sauce is o.k.; it was just liquidy. I'll skip it in the future.

Recipe ingredients are an excellent combo.  I use only a couple tablespoons of olive oil and make a paste with the pepper, rosemary (fresh) and garlic.  Schmeer it all over the roast and marinate in the fridge for several hours.  Mine roasts (no cover) in 1.25 hours @ 350.

Made this tonight with Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe and Easy Homestyle Green Beans, and it was a big hit. Only had a 1 lb pork loin, so adjusted accordingly. Looking forward to trying this again. Thanks to OP and other reviewers:)

Was really good. I used fresh Rosemary, dried thyme, garlic, and olive oil for my paste. And like others, I also used white wine and chicken broth while cooking and also more when I made the gravy. I also browned it 1st on the stove on a couple tbs of veg oil before putting in oven. It had great flavor and hubby and I decided it was great.

perfect, easy and tastes wonderful. using the drippings as gravy is brillant. Makes me want to forego buying tenderloins because this was just as succulent yet, less than half the price p.p.

Used this recipe for tonight's dinner. Very tasty. Pretty moist considering it is a loin which is often dry - at least when I cook it. Read some of the negative comments and have the following input. (1) the "Cook Time" lists 2 hours, yet the recipe itself says 1 hour. My 2 pound loin was ready in just over 1 hour. (2) I used 1 tsp. of rosemary and it was plenty for me (others might like more.) Personally I would never use POWDERED rosemary (which at least one person did). If you use powdered, do NOT use 1 Tablespoon - maybe a teaspoon (or less).

Attention Grillers!!  I chopped up some fresh garlic, added a couple of tablespoons of rosemary, poured about 3 oz of white wine and 1 oz of extra virgin olive oil and mixed.  Then I placed my pork loin into a aluminum foil pocket (tented), cut slits into the top of the meat, and poured the lumpy mixture on top.  I marinated it in the fridge for about 90 minutes.  My husband put it on a hot grill for 45 minutes, and voile!  Delicious and moist.  I did NOT add salt.  I am a salt lover and this dish was naturally salty enough. Enjoy!

OMG. This was sooooo good!  The only change I made was to drizzle just a little olive oil on top instead of the whole 1/4 cup.  I didn't have much juice from my 3 lb roast so I did not baste it. Cooked it with a meat therm until 165 and it was very juicy.  I have already called 3 people and told them to make this.

Tasted very good as written, however it was very dry.  Will have to cover next time to see if that makes the difference.

This was very easy and was absolutely Wonderful...Great flavor...I added Whole Baby Carrots and cut up potatoes to the pan...they were done and had a great flavor also...then when it was done I removed the pork and veggies and poured the drippings in a small sautee pan and added wine..Then i premixed a little corn starch and cold milk and added it to the simmering wine and drippings to thicken...Holy Wonderfulness!!!

I used a boneless pork roast, with thermometer, and let it marinate for an hour or so before. Covered and baked with onions, turnips and carrots. Took it out at 155 degrees and it was good, but not outstanding. It was a little dry, not sure why, and had decent flavor but we did need to add the gravy for more flavor and moisture. Next time I will try a shoulder roast or bone in roast.

***** Such a wonderful recipe.  I too browned the tenderloin first.  I don't cook too often and I don't care for tenderloin too much but this was so great.  Such an easy recipe.  I used 4 gloves of garlic and the directions for perfect.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe said, added mashed potatoes and mixed steamed vegetables.  This recipe was easy and fabulous!

Needs a more balanced spice rub - too heavy on the rosemary.

Really good. The flavor is infused by way of the holes pierced in the meat filled with garlic and herbs.

Lovely... it was a bit salty but I didn't measure the salt either.   Very good!!!  I used regular oil because I didn't have Olive oil and I forgot to do the white wine.   I crushed the everything by hand...   I added a little dried onion and garlic powder to the paste.  I didn't use much oil at all...   I didn't have any extra juices... put on a cookie sheet because I wasn't sure what else to do.   Took a bit less then 1 hour 15 minutes... and decreased the temp to 325 at the end for 20 minutes...

I followed a few of the suggestions of the other reviewers --- changed the rosemary to basil, and replaced the white wine with chicken broth.  Turned out really nice.  Husband said that this was a "keeper".

Too much rosemary, especially if you have leftovers the next day. All I ever tasted was rosemary and I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3. Mine was also done in about an hour and a half.

I marinated  with a paste that included garlic, S&P, olive oil. Soaked it in olive oil and chablis overnight. Cooked 2.98lb pork loin for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Let sit covered with foil for about an hour. Very tender and succulent. I had never made pork loin before. Definitely easy and I will make again with glazed carrots and kale as a side.

We really liked this and I was out of the white wine so I just did with out.  I am sure it will be a 5 star next time I make with the white wine!  Thanks for sharing!
Update:  made again with the white wine and it was fantastic!  I did brown it first on all side in an iron skillet and then baked in the skillet...

The garlic and rosemary were fabulous.  I seared the meat and added 1/2 c beef broth and 1/2 c chicken broth before cooking (didn't have wine on hand).  Carrots and red onions cooked in the broth were amazing.  We love garlic so I doubled the amount.  Served with mixed veggies and twice baked potatoes from this site.  So good!

Easy and flavorful. We  had a small, one-pound roast, so it was even easier, taking only an hour to cook. I brined it for a few hours first, and the result was tender and tasty! Definite keeper.

I thought this recipe was a bit heavy on the rosemary. I added the wine prior to putting the roast in the oven.  This recipe was decent, and the family enjoyed it.

I did not change the recipe, though I did use a pork roast with the bone, did not trim the fat. Then I rubbed the meat with the garlic mix.Put the roast in the pan fat up, poured in the white wine, covered and cooked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Then I turned the oven down to 200 degrees and slow cooked the meat. 1/2 hour before I served it I took the aluminum foil off and turned on my convection oven to brown the top. The meat fell of the bones. My children and husband loved it! I will use this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious!  Super moist and packed with tons of flavor.  I did however add more garlic, at least 2 bulbs of garlic and a handful of fresh rosemary for the paste.  I rubbed the entire roast (4lbs) with the garlic paste.  Also added fresh ground pepper and onion powder.  Didn't have white wine, so used chicken broth instead and baked at 350 for 2 hours with it covered.  The entire house smelled delicious!!!  The pork easily crumbled with a fork.  Thanks for sharing!  Will be making this again and again!!

I made this recipe in the crock pot and I followed it exactly with the exception of the wine...I used 3/4 cup instead 1/2 cup.  I also added chopped potatos.  I cooked on high for 4 hours.  The meat was tender but I didn't care for the Rosemary flavor much.  I personally found it to be overpowering.  My family and I ate it but we weren't raving over the flavor.  Next time I will use the garlic, olive oil, rib rub seasoning and BBQ sauce.  Now that sounds better.  :-D

Very good, simple recipe.  Only change/s I made; (1) assembled in crock pot on low; (2) added ~ 1 tsp fresh lime juice to perk it up a bit.  Also took others advice and when it was done, added a little cornstarch to crock pots contents to make a slightly thickened glaze for mashed potatoes.  Wonderful and so simple.

I guess I am not a rosemary person because I thought the rosemary overpowered everything else and ruined the taste. Luckily I could scrape most of it off and save the pork loin.

This was good aside from the fact that it was SOOOO salty we could barely eat it. I do not remember making any other pork loin that turned out this way. I added only the amount of salt called for, so I don't know why it was so salty. I will try again, but will eliminate the salt entirely.

This was pretty good. I used the same amount of spices, but used a 1.5lb roast. I covered and baked it for about an hour and 15 minutes. It was falling apart and delicious! thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This was really delicious. I cooked this in the oven for only about an hour for 1lb of pork loin and it turned out so juicy and tender. Also, instead of piercing the meat in only a few spots I actually sliced a shallow cut across the entire loin and pressed the garlic mixture in there. The wine was a great final touch, though it probably would have been fine without it!

Very good. I used a new 1/2 drill bit and drilled holes into the roast to get the garlic embedded. Sounds crazy, but try it.  You should double the garlic mix however.

I like Rosemary but it was too over powering in this dish. I wouldn't make it again. The gravy was the only think that saved the meal. I added sliced potatoes, carrots, onion and celery to the dish before putting it in the oven. The veggies we just ok as well.

This is an excellent recipe.  I haven't roasted a pork loin before and I did this for company.  Everyone loved it.  I don't think there's anything you can do wrong with this recipe.  I had a 3 pound bigger loin and used probably 4 or 5 garlic cloves.  I threw them in while my food processor was running and just threw in my rosemary and a few tablespoons of olive oil.  I spread that over the top of the roast and punched a few holes here and there.  I added a bit of wine after it roasted awhile.  Then I scraped the pan with an additional amount of wine and poured that delicous juice over the sliced pork loin.  Extremely delicous and excepionally easy!  Thanks for this recipe!

I loved this recipe! Simple but very delicious. The key for me was to check the internal temperature of the meat and as soon as it reached the proper temp for pork, I removed it from the oven, as a small piece of pork can dry out very quickly. I served it for relatives who were visiting and it got raves. 
Served it with homemade apple butter, whipped butternut squash (roasted first), and cauliflower au gratin.  A great fall meal!!

Very good. I pureed the garlic/oil mixture in the food processor and rubbed on the pork. Smelled and tasted delicious.

This was really good.  Had a small 2 lb. pork loin roast so this was perfect.  Used a meat thermometer and cooked about 1 hour 15 minutes (temp 180).  Use beef broth instead of wine and roasted baby carrots and potatoes with the roast.

I followed another reviewers tip and browned by seasoned roast in garlic and oil, then placed it in the crock pot with white wine and added some celery, carrots and onions, for 8 hours. It was delisoushly moist with a light flavor. I didnt have any rosemary, so as other reviews suggested I substituted with Basil and Thyme. It was a big hit!

I LOVED this recipe!  Instead of using white wine I used a red, and it tasted great.  I also used minced garlic from the jar, and the recipe came out wonderfully!  Even my 7 year old niece loved it!

I made this last night for dinner. My husband and children raved on good this was. If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. It was so moist and seasoned perfect. My husband never takes a lunch to work but as soon as he was done with dinner, he was up and making a dish to take with him to work today and he didn't forget it. He raves on my cooking all the time and I often joke with him that he married me because of my cooking. He requested to have this once a week. Thank you, this is a winner

This was my first pork loin and it turned out wonderful.  It was moist, flavorful and juicy.  It was tender enough to cut with a fork.  I made up the rub, applied it to the loin and then sealed the roast in a food saver bag to get it coated better, left it for about an hour.  I browned it in olive oil and garlic before throwing it into the oven.  It didn't need the full two hours as others have stated.  I did make my own gravy with the pan drippings and wine, I pressed it threw a sieve before serving.

Just made this for dinner.  Added thyme to the spices per other recommendations. Turned out excellent.  Moist and flavorful.  My roast was still slightly frozen in the center so I reduced the temp to 300 and cooked it for 2 hours (internal temp 160)

Oh, this pork roast is to die for, and I usually dont care for pork!  The only change I made was to score the pork and marinate overnight and when I roasted it, I added 1 cup beef stock and onions, carrots and potatoes. The wine was added to the juices and thickened for a fabulous gravy. Yummmmmm!  Even my picky 5 yr old grandson asked for seconds.  There was enough of everything left so I froze them grouped together in labeled ziplock bags for another meal!  This is definately a keeper and big hugs for Kathleen!

This was divine!  From the wonderful aroma as it baked to the very last bite, my husband raved about it.  Instead of stuffing with the herbs and adding the wine to the drippings after the roast was cooked, I combined all the ingredients and marinated the meat in them for about 3 hours.  Then I wrapped it all tightly and baked to 160F.  (My roast had a pop up timer that just happened to pop up at exactly 160F, but I checked just to be sure.)  It was tender, juicy, and oh so tasty.  The drippings were excellent over garlic mashed potatoes.  Can't wait to make it again!

The pork was tender, but the flavor just didn't seem to be there.  Followed the recipe to the "t".  Not sure if I liked the rosemary taste....but won't be making this again.

Great recipe!!!  Did not use the wine - have kids and I don't like the taste in my food, but the garlic, rosemary and olive oil added just the right seasonings.  I did make sure to take the roast out the miunte it hit 160 and it was extremely juicy.  My kids loved it.  This one is a keeper.

I made this roast tonight for dinner and the end result was imo, a pretty boring pork roast.  I don't really have much else to say about it - there are plenty of other pork loin recipes on this site that I prefer...sorry.

Delicious and, best of all, easy!  I didn't have any problem at all with the meat drying out; in fact, it was so tender that it was basically like butter.  Mmm!  The "poke holes in it and then rub/stuff garlic and rosemary all over it" idea never came to me before, and with as good as this came out, it's a wonder.  The sauce was also delicious, if a little bit watery.  Next time I'll probably experiment with butter and/or milk to see if I can thicken it up into a proper gravy with mashed potatoes.  I served the dish with green beans and rice and it was perfect.  Oh, and I only cooked it for an hour and a half, perhaps because the meat was on the lean side, and didn't need the extra cooking time.  Maybe that's why other people's meat turned dry?  Just an idea; watch that oven, people!  I'll definitely be making this again, though.  Mmm!

Awesome flavor in this recipe.  I took the advice of others and put some carrots, potatoes, celery, and onion in the roasting pan.  Turned out terrific.  I even made gravy with the pan drippings and it turned out!!!  (A first in my kitchen!)  I will be making this pork roast recipe again.

Enjoyed very much.  My only change was that my roast was done in 1 -1/2 hours.  I also suggest using a meat thermometer.  Very tender.  Served with mashed potatoes and Family's Creamed Spinach from this site.  Thanks

This turned out really good. Some of the garlic that got in the bottom of the pan burned.  Could be because I used minced garlic from a jar.  I think next time I may use chicken broth instead of wine.  Also, mine only took about an hour to cook

This recipe made a very good pork loin. I had never cooked one before, and this turned out great. I poked about 15-20 holes in it to stuff it with the rosemary/garlic mixture. I may try another version in the future just to see what else it out there, but this recipe is definitely a keeper and will make you happy with the results. I didn't have any wine on hand, and I think that would have made it really fabulous. It was still very good, though.

I followed the directions and was going to cook the roast (a 4.5 lb pork tenderloin) for the stated time.  I checked it at 1 hr and 5 mins and found it done!  Not sure where the disconnect is, but the time seems way off to me.  The roast was delicious!

This was an excellent recipe.  At first I was a little worried that it would be too salty, but it wasn't at all.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect.  The meat was juicy and practically melted in your mouth.  It was only my husband and I eating it, so we had a bit of leftovers, so we made pork fried rice the next day for lunch using the remaining pork..It was even better the next day reheated.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

A very good and very easy recipe. I left out the wine at the end and made regular gravy by adding cornstarch or flour and the water the potatoes were boiled in.  Serve with a vegetable, bread and mashed potatoes.  Doesn't get any better than this!!

This was really good.  My husband loved it.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, and gravy from the drippings and wine was fabulous.  I had a 4 lb. boneless pork sirloin roast, and it was very tender and juicy, but b/c of the weight, I increased the amount rosemary and garlic and the rosemary was a little overpowering.  So next time I will do the exact measurements.

i love this recipe, i have made it about 5 times since i saw it.  once i fell asleep and it overcooked about an hour, my husband still loved it. i increased the salt and pepper a bit and don't usually do the wine sauce. i chop and chop and chop the garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary to make it as close to a paste as possible.  have not tried it in food processor yet.  it is always moist and fantastic.   i do not cut slits, i rub the pasty garlic misture on the roast.  at some point in the future i may try to marinate it first.  i highly recommend this!!!

I have made this several times and it is one of my favorite recipes. I love the flavor combination of garlic, rosemary and pork. What you must do with this, as with most roasts, is use a meat thermometer and cook to a temp of 160. I made this one time (without sauce), sliced it and took to a potluck and everyone loved it. The meat is so moist and good it stands without sauce.

The flavor was absolutely wonderful!  We love garlic and rosemary, so the abundance of these flavors was welcomed.  It did, however, turn out extremely dry following the cook times.  Also, because it was overcooked, maybe the pan juices dried up?  because there certainly was not enough to work with to make the gravy. Will try again, marinading it and cutting down on cook time as other reviewers have suggested.  Definitely worth trying again.

We thought this one was okay.  Watch the cook time.  I followed the recipe, and it came out dry and overcooked.  The flavor was okay, the roast was just really dry and needed a lot of gravy.

This was a good recipe, the pork loin came out very tender. But I think next time I will try chicken broth instead of wine, my kids don't really like the taste of wine. So I didn't give them the sauce.  But it was very good.

I served this for dinner and my whole family raved over this recipe.  One of my children came back to me before bedtime asking if she could have another serving.  Instead, we decided to make her a lunch with the left-overs for school the following day.  My oldest daughter commented that this may become her favorite meat dish.

So many people were saying they extended the cooking time and I strongly encourage people not to do that.  I cooked 4 pounds of pork loin at 350 and it was done at 60 minutes.  Unfortunately, I read too many people's posts about 60 minutes not being long enough so I put my loin in for another 30 minutes. And it was super dry, even with all those juices.  Remember that a piece of meat will continue to cook as it's sitting there resting.  Other than that, the flavor was delightful.

I made this roast according to the receipe. It was delicious.  I did let the roast sit in the refrigerator with the spices for 3-4 hours prior to cooking.  I used a meat thermometer and removed the roast at 145 degrees and let it sit for 15 minutes.  I also cooked red potato, carrot and onion in the same pan for the full time.  I had a 2.5 pound pork loin.  It took 1hour and 15 minutes to reach 145 degrees.  I did add the wine and chicken broth during the cooking phase.  After the roast was removed,  I created a gravy by adding flour to cold water and mixing with the drippings.  Back in the oven stirring occasssionally.  My husband raved about the roast and told me it was the best roast I had ever made.  I will definitely be making this again!

Rub those loins down with the left over herbs you've pierced them with, and then surround with some thin sliced sweet potatoes ( to be done as the same time as the pork), apples and sweet onions.  One dish meal that everyone loves.  Oh, I just splash the wine towards the end so it makes its own sauce.

I will definitely make this again! Instead of wine, I used cooking sherry. I didn't have any rosemary and it tasted great any way. No salt added either.

I used pork tenderloin and it was an easy and my family enjoyed it.  I will try a pork loin next time or purchase a pork roast and cut to make smaller and allow to marinate to ensure the meat is well seasoned.  Love it!!!

So yummy.  Changes I made:  I didn't have rosemary so I used the garlic and other seasonings in my pantry.   I just put in whatever I thought I'd like :)
I poured half a can of chicken broth into bottom of roasting pan and placed sliced onions, sliced mushrooms and green peppers around the roast.   I used a meat thermometer to test for doneness.  I then removed roast,  wrapped in foil and removed vegetables.   I poured drippings into a sauce pan along with 1 tblsp of cornstarch and white wine (I used cooking wine ) and simmered until alcohol burned off.     Sliced roast,  poured gravy over and served with green peppers,  onions and mushrooms.   The roast was very moist and so delicious.  This is a new family favorite.

I seem to be in the minority, but I didn't think this dish was great or even very good.  The pork was flavorful, but it wasn't very tender, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  If I make it again, I will follow some of the suggestions and cook the pork with wine and broth in a covered baker.

I love pork roast and this was the best recipe that I have tried yet.  It was so moist, aromatic and flavorful.  The rosemary definitely makes this dish.  Instead of wine I used chicken broth as I had no white wine in the house, but the sauce was absolutely delicious.  Thanks for a wonderful pork roast recipe.

Fantastic! Only modifications I made were to use five-six sprigs of fresh rosemary in the marinade and to add little potatoes and little onions to the roasting pan. For the last five minutes of roasting i topped the pork with a bit of applesauce and a tiny bit of brown sugar. I also sprinkled flour into the drippings with a dollop of bouillon to make a light gravy. Loved it!

I always do this on the stove top in a pan like pot roast.  I add the evoo to the pan and then brown the roast.  Once it is golden I add the remaining ingredients and cook on low heat for 3 - 4 hours.  It is very tender and flavorful!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Used a 1.25 lb tenderloin and it was a big hit with my husband. I reduced some of the ingredients but not the garlic!

GREAT RECIPE! Followed it exactly. I do always brine my pork in a white wine brine for a few days regardless of the recipe. Also I always stuff some sliced garlic cloves in the slits. This time I also included the paste. Do agree that you've got to watch the meat thermometer. Depending on the cut, your oven, etc it can reach done very quickly. I personally cook to 150. Just a matter of taste. Love the recipe! Thanks!

This was good.  I did not like how the sauce tasted so I added some brown sugar to it and it came out much better.  I will make this again.

Really easy and very tasty. Be careful (obviously) not to overcook or pork will be dry.  I'd definitely say it's worth making.

Another solid 4-star recipe.  Roast came out tender... a lot more tender and juicy than any previous pork loin roast I have cooked.   Had good taste, but the "rub" didn't go very far.  I would double that next time.

I made this per the recipe, and we all loved it.  Great flavor, moist, and EASY to make!  My family would prefer the flavor of the gravy without the wine.  Definitely will make this again.

Tasty!  I used fresh rosemary cause I have it and used a turkey tenderloin which worked out great.  I followed the directions on the package of how long to cook it and 55 minutes was perfect!  Thanks so much!

Love this recipe.  I make it all the time in the autumn and winter.  I even made it for Christmas last year and will probably make it again this year.  I do pretty much everything it says, but I add onion to the marinating process.  Sear the meat and mixture including to onions.  When it is time to heat the wine, I use a fruit dessert wine for the demiglaze.  It adds such a nice dimension to the pork.  I have used the berry wines for this.  Have not tried the white wine yet.

OMG - the combination of seasonings is amazing on the pork!  I'd purchased a "peppercorn" seasoned pork loin to which I added the rosemary, garlic, and other ingredients - left my son & I speechless.  Definitely a keeper.

My loin was 4.77 lbs and cooked within two hours.  I marinated it about 6 hours and it was very flavorful.  I did use fresh rosemary and I think that helped.

I marinated the pork loin with the oil, salt, rosemary, and garlic mixture for about 4hrs. It turned out great. The roast was tender and tasty. The white wine sauce was also very good.

The rosemary was a little strong for my taste, but otherwise this worked very well. It took about 1:45 for my 1 lb loin to cook through at 375 F. This went FANTASTIC with Slow Cooker Stuffing from this site and seasoned green beans. Turned out very attractive.

This was fantastic!  I put some wine in while roasting as other reviewers suggested.  It was juicy.  I used about 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary on a 3 pound roast.  Made gravy with drippings.

This was my first roasted pork loin and found the recipe super user friendly!!! The taste was PERFECT with the pork. I forgot to use the wine – opps – but it still turned out so delicious! Everyone LOVED it! (thank goodness for a few pieces of leftovers) I used my mini food processor to make the paste, I just it all in and added some olive oil to help it along and then rubbed it in and on the loin!!! NOMNOM we will for sure be adding this to our list of good ones!!!

My first attempt at pork loin (I'm just starting to find my way in the kitchen..) and it turned out great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, maybe a bit more garlic because I like it. It didn't need to cook for the full time, turned out perfectly moist and flavorful! I will definitely be making this again.

Made a 3 lb pork roast so I doubled the garlic/rosemary mixture and total cooking time was about 1 hr and 45 min.  Came out delicious and tender.  Made gravy with pan drippings.  YUM!

I made this last week as it was written and it was wonderful! I let it sit in the fridge in a freezer bag for about 5 hours after rubbing the meat with the paste before baking it. Next time I will let it sit overnight. I read the reviews and I cannot see how anyone could say that this was bland! I have to ask myself if they crushed thier rosemary as the recipe stated or not as that would make a difference or if they did not insert the garlic deep enough into the meat as that would make a difference also. At any rate this is one that both my DH & myself went wild over and we will be making it again. And for the record it is "company" good so do not hesitate to make it for guests!

I made this for our New Year's Day dinner and it was FAB-u-lous! Full of flavor and tender. I used 4 gloves of garlic, 1 tbsp. dried rosemary, 1/8 tsp. sea salt & ground pepper and just enough olive oil to make a paste. I had a 3 lb. Pork Loin & roasted for 1.5 hours @350, let stand covered in tinfoil for 10 min b4 slicing ... the wine sauce was the perfect compliment and served with Sunday Dinner Mashed Potatoes (recipe found here) and carrots ... yummy!

I made this today for my New Year's Day meal.  It was wonderful - very moist and very tasty.  I didn't have rosemary or garlic cloves, but I used 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbs of olive oil, 1 tbs of honey, 1 tbs of red wine, salt and pepper.  Made the paste, stuffed it into the slits that I had made and rubbed the rest all over it. I stuffed in dried cranberries wherever I could find a place.  I put it on a rack with 1/2 c of broth in the pan and roasted it at 350 degrees with a foil tent over it for an hour, then removed the foil, lowered to 325, and cooked until it reached 160 internal degrees.  It was 3-1/2 lb roast, so it needed about another hour and a half cooking time.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I will definitely cook again and again.

I made this tonight for guests and it was delicious and beautiful as well.  I substituted basil pesto (which I made fresh from my garden and then froze it) and added a touch more olive oil to the paste and rubbed it into the loin.  I sliced the loin 2/3 down, leaving the 1/3 still unsliced and whole in about one inch increment slices and then rubbed the paste between each slice.  It seemed to get the flavor around the meat better.  Then I put the loin in a gallon zip lock bag and added about 1/2 cup of white wine.  Threw it back in the fridge for 3 hours and then roasted it.  I served it sliced in the middle of a large oval platter with cranberry relish mounded about 2 inches away from the loin and circleing.  The cranberry relish and pork was very complementary and made a stunning presentation.  Also had mashed potatos for a side dish and Caribean blend frozen vegies with cheese sprinkled on top.  Carrot cake for dessert!  I will definately make this pork loin recipe and next time try it with rosemary!

I make mine and marinade it overnight using DRY SHERRY instead of white wine, garlic, rosemary, a little bit of wine vinegar.  The wine vinegar gives it a tangy taste.  You can also add some orange juice with the wine vinegar.  In Cuba we used something called "naranja agria"--bitter orange from these oranges that were not meant for juice but had a tart taste.  That, the sherry, the bitter orange and the garlic plus some rosemary made it deeelicious.

This was fabulous. Such a great combo, the rosemary and garlic. Didn't have white wine on hand but used apple cider and it turned out great! Thanks.

I followed the recipe as written but using fresh rosemary.  Cook covered for an hour then for 1/2 hr. uncovered.   It looked really white so I broiled it for about 10 min.     But the gravy was not what I expected it to be.   too pasty using cornstarch and water. Not the OP's fault , just one of the reviewes I read here  Next time, I'lll just reduce the pan drippings and go with that.

We did not like this recipe at all. I let the meat marinate for at least 3 hours and it still came out SO BLAND.   It smelled so good when it was cooking in the oven - but when I took it out it was so bland. I even made a gravy to go with the meat, but still no flavor.   Will not cook this recipe again. My bf said "you shouldn't cook pork again" after this recipe.

This is a great recipe and hard to mess up! I had never done a pork roast before but this one went beautifully. My food processor is on the fritz so I just used a spoon to mash the paste - it went great.   Can't go wrong with this one! I had TONS of compliments!

I cooked a 2.5 lbs roast for 1 hour, 10 min. It was juicy, but I was confused what I was suppose to cook the roast in so I just put it in a baking dish, uncovered. I thought it was too much rosemary, will definitely try it again with less or with another spice.

I made this recipe with a few revisions. I browned the roast in pan and then cooked in in a slow cooker. I cut up an onion, carrots and celery and put them in the bottom of the slow cooker, browned the meat and then put the garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper rub on the pork. I cut a few holes in the top and pushed the rub inside the pork. It was so moist and delicious. You didn't need a knife to cut it. It fell apart. The family loved it, too.

That was great!  So easy & delicious!!  I did sear it first in a large skillet & then put the entire pan in the oven.  I did 375 degrees on convection & it cooked nice & crispy brown on the outside.  It was like having a holiday meal during the week!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with pork steaks instead of roast. I thankfully omitted the salt. The steaks where salty enough on their own. It was great otherwise, really nice favor and a great change from regular porl steak.

2 hours is way too long.  My roast was 3 lbs and was overcooked after 1 1/2 hours.  The flavor was still great so I will make again with decreased cooking time.  Try adding some other spices too like oregano and  dried parsley. I sliced thin with electric knife and served with gravy made from pan drippings.

The roast was excellent, jucy, lots of flavor and brown. Reviews and comments were helpful. I tented the roast with foil for 10 minuets after the meat was finished cooking.  I also added the wine while the roast was cooking.

Perfectly delicious roast! I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't care for the wine/drippings combo after I tasted it (and I usually love a strong wine flavor in my food), so I served the roast without it.  Will make again & again!

Great recipe - I was in a hurry so I didn't do the part about cutting the holes and stuffing the paste, I just rubbed it onto the pork.  It was great though, very tender and perfect flavor! (I also omitted the wine step but that sounds good too).

I used this recipe last night.  As a newlywed, I had never cooked a pork loin before, so I needed some guidance and this was wonderful.  I butterflied the loin, seasoned it liberally with salt, black pepper and onion powder, and put the paste in the middle, and all over the top, and then closed it (back together).  I had it in the oven (uncovered) for 2 hours, and then I took it out, sprinkled a little grated parmesan in the middle of it and over the top, and a little parsley flakes and put it back in the oven for 15 more minutes.  It was wonderful!  So juicy and moist and my husband and guests loved it.  There was nothing left - everyone cleaned their plates!

This was the best!  My entire family loved it.  Only suggestion, DO watch cooking times.  I only had to cook about 1 1/2 hr not the 2 hrs as states.  We will not regret a moment of this simple, delicious meat.

This was excellent. My husband, who can be quite a critic, loved it.  I added thyme to the rub, based on the suggestions of other reviewers.  I also added the pan drippings to 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 TBS of cornstarch to make gravy.

This was fabulous!  I actually doubled the "rub" ingrediants and added a little olive oil to that..then I butter flied the pork roast and spread half of the mixture in it, closed it and spread the rest of the mixture on top.  Followed the recipe the rest of the way.  VERY GOOD

Very good, prepared almost exactly as described.  I only added 1/2 cup water to the bottom of my baking dish and one additional seasoning from Pampered Chef (crushed peppercorn and garlic) This was very juicy, tender and delicious.  I served it with pork gravy that I made last week and had frozen to keep on hand.

I cooked this last night and it was wonderful.  I did take some short-cuts.  I made the paste as described, using about half of the recommended Rosemary and adding a bit of thyme and chives. Then I put it in a gallon plastic zip lock bag, added the wine and olive oil and put it in the fridge for a couple of hours.  I just poured the entire thing in a shallow baking dish and put it in the oven. I wasn't sure whether to cover in the oven or not, but opted not. It took the full 2 hours as I had a 3lb loin.  Everyone LOVED it.  I can't imagine substituting the rosemary - that makes this recipe.  People with children can feel comfortable adding the wine as the alcohol cooks out leaving only the flavor.

This was great!  And so easy, I had family over for dinner and this came out so good they all raved and best of all was how little effort it took!  One tip...do use a meat thermometer, it's easy to overcook a roast.

I used a pork lion and cut it in half.  I baked it in my Pampered Chef large stoneware bowl uncovered.  Very flavorful. Very good.  My picky eater husband loved it and my kids did too.

I'll give this a full five stars - it is quite good...lots of robust rosemary & garlic flavor and aroma.  I prepared a ~3lb pork loin as per the instructions - it was done in about 1hr 10min (160F when it came out of the oven).

For the sauce, I used Zin, a splash of Vermouth and couple shakes of large grain sea salt - reduced for a few minutes in the drippings.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and makes a great dinner! You can mix it up by using other herbs, like thyme, in addition to the rosemary or adding some cream to the wine sauce. Either way, it is always a favorite!

Even my husband, who didn't want me to make the recipe because he (claims he) doesn't like pork,kept saying he liked this! I did use sherry instead of the white wine, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Good recipe nice moist pork, but may want to pull it before two hours! After 1 hour 20 minutes internal temp was 160. I removed from oven and let it sit for 10 minutes, it was perfect!!!

Awesome recipe.  I took the advice of others.  I made a rub of the garlic/rosemary/pepper & olive oil and then let it marinate for two hours.  I only had red wine in the house, but it was still great.  :)

I made this roast, and my house smelled wonderful while it was cooking! The roast had too many flavors, though, I think. The wine sauce was just too much...if I make it again, I'll go easier on the rosemary, and maybe just serve a brown gravy with it, wine in a glass!

Oh Wow.. This was SOOOOO GOOD! I had a large roast and thought that the spice mixture wouldn't be enough but it was.. and the gravy that it made was AWSOME w/ this roast! The house smelled wonderful and it went perfect w/ the garlic mashed potatoes I made. Even my picky son who doesn't like anything asked for seconds of this roast! THANKS!

Tender and delicious and I agree with other 1 1/2 hours is fine. I took it out and put a thermometer in it and it was just above 160 degrees, but below 170 and it was perfect! Also, I used thyme instead of rosemary and came out great!

I didn't have time to do all of the prep work today, so I just mixed all of the ingredients together as stated (including the wine)last night and basically made a marinade.  I cut several slits in the meat and stuffed a peeled garlic clove in each.  The meat marinated overnight and then I had my husband put it in the oven for me while I was at work. The smell was absolutely incredible, and the taste was equally divine- juicy and very flavorful. Next time I will try making exactly as the recipe says, or maybe even sear the meat as other reviewers have done.  Thank you for the recipe!

This dish turned out delicious and moist for me.  I did rely on my meat thermometer and took it out the second it hit 160.  You have to be quick with pork.  I used previous ideas and browned roast in skillet (oven proof) I added 1/2 cup sherry and 1/2 cup chicken broth to pan and lossened brown bits and then baked.  After I removed the roast I returned the skillet to the stovetop and thickened the juices with cornstarch/water and made a nice gravy to drizzle over top.  Only four stars due to changes.

Wow, I'm really bad at making roats but this one came out good. Used basil instead of rosemary (didn't have any) & only used 1/4 C wine  in the pan juices. Next time I will cut the oil in half. I only had to cook this for 1 1/2 hours, I had a meat thermometer in it. This was the most tender roast. My husband didn't even need a knife to cut his slices at the table. I used the leftover pork on Cuban sandwhiches. Thanks so much!

Solid recipe.  Similar to what you'll find in any American cookbook.  I used fresh rosemary and garlic and marinated a 3 pound loin overnight.  Everyone loved it.  I slightly overcooked it - it was a 3 pounder and still was done in less than an hour and a half.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

As others have suggested definitely only cook it for 1 1/2 hours (not the full 2). The flavor was excellent! I will certainly be making this again. I added a heaping tablespoon of flour to the drippings and wine to make a nice pan gravy. It was outstanding.

This was excellent with a few minor changes. I used a little more garlic, with fresh rosemary and instead of thyme I used Italian Seasoning.  I used a food processor and made the paste, then rubbed it onto the loin that I had already put s/p on.  I cooked at 300 covered with foil for 1 hr then uncovered and kept it moist by basting with the juices.  In the very end I turned on the broiler to brown a little.  I opted not to make a gravy with this.  My husband and I loved it.  Very tender, can't wait to make again.

This was very easy to make, tender and tasty.  I didn't baste it while it was cooking and it still turned out just fine. I cut up some potatoes and roasted them at the same time and they turned out a little dry, but good when you pour the juice over them.

Great taste! I added wine thruout as we love the taste of a great white wine and when I cook my pork roast I roast it in White wine. I changed nothing else! Very tender and the rosemary and garlic tasted great together! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for our first Valentine's Day dinner and it was a huge success.  My husband loved it and it was so easy to put in the oven while I worked on the rest of the meal.  It seemed even better as leftovers the next day!

This was a delicious roast.  This was my first attempt at cooking a pork loin and it was great.  I seasoned it as shown, but let it sit for a few hours before cooking.  My husband could smell it befor he even came in the house.  Do watch the time, though, mine was 2lbs and cooked in just over an hour.

Outstanding recipe!  Very flavorful and moist when cooked with the meat thermometer.  I used fresh rosemary generously and it was wonderful!

This was good, but not something I would make again. I followed the recipe exactly, but there was just something missing. The meat was tender and flavorful near the outside, but really rather bland in the middle. We love rosemary and garlic and this smelled wonderful while it was cooking but it just didn't taste as good as it smelled.

This was a very simple recipe to follow.  I cut back on the rosemary since it can be overpowering.  I had a 2lb loin and it only took about 1.5 hours to cook.  When I took it out of the oven I covered it with foil for about ten minutes for the juices to come out.  The gravy serves nicely with mashed potatoes.

So simple and very tasty.  I also used a thermometer, I personally found it's the only way to go when roasting, you don't want dry pork.  didn't use all the oil (maybe 1/8 c.) Also did make the sauce and it was delish over mashed potatoes and the pork.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Made this last night for dinner.  I added some thyme and used very little salt.  The house smelled wonderful with the roast in the oven.  This recipe will be used for future dinner parties!

Simple, but very good. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried, and omitted the oil entirely. I put this in my oven, which has a slow-cooker feature, on "LO" and it took 2.5 hours for a 2lb. 6 oz. roast. I'll make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

The pork comes out very tender and tasty, but adding this made it great my guest loved the gravy with the pork.

Using the pan juices with 2 cups of beef stock,  1/3 cup of cherry and 2 table spoons of flour heat until thick makes a great gravy with the pork.

This was delicious. You must like rosemary, and be sure not to over cook your pork.

We really liked this. It came out great. I'm not the best cook, but this was easy. It was tender and flavorful, the best pork roast I ever had. Since there was only two of use we had leftovers, but not much, we mixed the left overs with veggies and cream of chicken soup and served over noodles as a meal. The flavor of the meat makes great leftovers, if you have them.

I made it per the ingredient list in my convection oven.  Mixed all ingredients plus olive oil and Lawry's seasoned pepper and spread all over the roast and in pre-cut slits.  Covered and refrigerated overnight.  Brought roast out of fridge 1 hour before roasting at 350 for an hour.  (3# roast was used.)  Also poured about 1/2 cup of Marsala wine in bottom of pan just before roasting.  Made gravy from pan juices, more Marsala, chicken base, added salt and pepper to taste.  Seasonings were nicely infused in the roast.  Delicious!

Followed this simple recipe as written, surprisingly good. Surprisingly because it is so simple. The combination of rosemary and garlic on the roast and the sauce were very tasty. I used a package of two smallish pork tenderloins from Costco, about a pound each, so I should have lowered the  temp on my oven. As it was, I turned the roasts at 30 and 60 minutes as directed, and decided to check internal temp at 60 minutes. They were overcooked at that point. Not terribly, but a bit dry. The sauce saved the day. This was operator error, no stars deducted, and had nothing to do with the recipe. Will make adjustments and enjoy this delicious roast many times again!

I use pork tenderloin when I make this, and make an herb blend with rosemary, thyme, garlic, and a little bit of red chili flakes. It's a huge hit every time.

I cooked a 3 lb. Pork loin for 1hr 20 min.  IT WAS GREAT... I use fresh garlic and fresh rosemarry.  I followed directions except had to wrap in saran wrap for about 2 hr before I cooked it.  Made a gravy with drippings with flour.. Did not use wine because it was great without it... Popped sweet potatoes in oven with meat  ...my husband cooked fried apples.  Brocalli was oue veggy... Family hit!  Thanks for the reciepe!

Absolutely terrible.....flavor of pork totally overpowered by all the rosemary. Not really enough drippings to make a gravy. Tasted like raw wine.
Lastly, cooking to 145 degrees and allowing to rest it will end up at 152 or so. Perfect if you like dried out pork. Pork is so lean these days, i alway pull it off the heat at 130, knowing it will rise to 137 and stay moist.

It was a big hit! This is what I did differently: I used a 3 lbs pork loin and used fresh garlic and fresh rosemary. I cooked the loin uncovered for 40 mins then covered it for another 20 mins. At the one hour point I checked the temp and it was at 145 so I took it out and let it sit for 30 mins. Seriously the key is letting it sit for awhile before cutting it. Huge, huge hit with all the guests!!

After reading all the reviews I cooked it an hour and a half for a 2 pound sirloin roast. It  was too long and ended up dry. I did also take suggestions about adding liquid to the pan which needed to be done because the drippings began to get too dark and burn.  My guests ate it all up because the sauce was fairly good I did use extra broth and wine and used cornstarch to thicken it so we’d have more sauce. I personally felt the whole recipe was a little bland. But also didn’t want to overdo it because of the Tastes of my guests. Next time I’ll use fresh rosemary from the garden Rather than dry. I also put all the seasonings and oil and marinated the roast in that for a couple hours prior to putting in the oven. I’ll give it one more shot and really watch the thermometer this last time after almost an hour it wasn’t even close to 145 but then the next few minutes of just shot right up temperature wise.

Made it exactly except for wine...I used chicken broth instead. The recipe said an hour but the video said 2 hours. It was dry and had to work hard to eat it. How could I have made it moist?

I made this and it was an easy preparation which I liked.  I had a 4.5 lb loin roast, but this recipe was for a smaller roast. I cooked it for 2 hours (covered for 1 1/2 hours), when I checked with my thermometer at that point the internal temp was WAY over  the recommended 145F - mine was 180F, so I removed it right away and put it on a cutting board for 10 min to rest. Made the gravy, and then sliced it to serve. It was well done but not burned on the outside, it may be dry after a few days in the fridge, but at this point it is good enough. I'd recommend checking with the thermometer after an hour at most. Still a good meal with minimum fuss, and I have lots remaining for different dishes in the days to come.  I'll cook this again, but will check the temp sooner. I also put carrots and potatoes in the pan, so my veggies were ready without using another pot. A great recipe for fall/winter meals. It makes the hose smell great while it's cooking.

I made this as-is. I dont know why some of you people continue to rate a recipe that you changed. That would make it your recipe! 

Anyway, I did not care for this. It was juicy, but the flavor was pretty much just rosemary.  Everyone went to the fridge to find some kind of sauce to go with it. 

I wont make it again.

I've made this 3 times so far and it's delicious! Unlike so many people that change this and that then review it, I change nothing. When I chop the garlic and rosemary to make the past, I will drizzle a drop of olive oil to blend it but short of that, make this as is. It's hard to change perfection! You will definitely not be disappointed. It's a huge hit in this household for sure. Thank you for such great recipe - will make this many times in the future!

This was SO GOOD. Easily the best pork roast I've ever made. I'm not a very experienced cook and was skeptical about the wine sauce at the end, but it absolutely made the dish! Thanks to the author for a great dinner!

The best Pork roast ever. I didn't have dried rosemary, but I have plenty of fresh rosemary in the garden and it worked just fine. The sauce from deglazing the pan with white wine was amazing. I had rave reviews from all my guests. I served it with roasted red potatoes and carrots which were also great with the sauce from the pork.

This is an AWESOME recipe! I followed it almost exactly. The only thing I didn't do was turn my roast while it was cooking. I cooked mine for an hour and 50 mins due to it being almost 4 lbs. It was so tender, moist, and flavorful. It got rave reviews at dinnertime. I added a little cornstarch to the white wine/drippings and came up with a delicious gravy. Would definitely make again.

I made this tonight for dinner, and it came out really great! I'm on a low-sodium diet per the doctor, and I thought this would be good dish to make. The recipe was really simple, and the results were just fine. 

Some easy modifications that I did, was add baby carrots (for sweetness), potatoes chunks, celery stalks, and some splashes of white wine and olive oil to the pot. It really added alot of flavor during the cook process. Mashed potatoes or steamed veggies also make a nice compliment dish to this. 

My roast was just slightly overcooked, so I will adjust accordingly next time I make it. Either cook at 300 degrees, or start checking internel temp after 1 hour. I prefer my pork loin at 145 degrees (med rare) to avoid drying out the meat. A meat themometer will advoid this problem. I cant wait to make this again!

This recipe turned out really tasty although i did a couple things differently. I added about a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of Thyme and onion powder to the paste, and i would even add a little more for next time. Remember to turn the pork at least a few times! i only turned it once and it came out a little unevenly cooked. I agree with other reviews that a meat thermometer is really useful with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I'm not usually a big pork fan, but this was really good! I used fresh rosemary with about six cloves of garlic for my two pound loin. I marinated it with some extra olive oil and a bit of lemon juice, and roasted it with some of the wine. It took about an hour and a half to cook through. I served it with rosemary roasted potatoes and roasted carrots and onions. My four year old twins raved about how good it was and gobbled it up. My husband also really liked it. Great recipe!

I used a smaller pork tenderloin, and this was amazing. Afterbrowning it in a dutch oven, I added chicken stock and green beans (and quite a lot of salt on the beans) and baked for 45 minutes. SO good!

My family (including a five year old) loved it! Very easy to make and tasty. I followed the recipe and doubled to make two loins. I ended up with a lot of pan juices! Will surely keep this on heavy rotation.

Awesome receipe. Cooked mine on the grill in a pan. Used a meat thermometer,  cooked until it was a few degrees from done. Let rest while it finished the last couple degrees.  Was delicious! This is a must try.

Great dish! Didn't have white wine, used a full bottle of beer instead and put the pork in a pan with aluminum foil, poured the beer in, added the paste to the top and enclosed it so that the beer was surrounding it as it cooked. Super tender, juicy and delicious!

I cooked this last night for the first time for my Oscar Party guests. I live at high altitude so I roasted it at 355 degrees for 1 hr 20 mins until thermometer read 165 F. I used a lot more freshly chopped rosemary and 4 garlic cloves,and I used stock rather than wine. It turned out perfectly; well done, succulent, tender and tasty. It is a keeper in my home. Everyone loved it. -JACQUILLY, THE HELDENTENOR COOK

The meat came out very dry and taste-less. I think I used the wrong wine for the gravy; I should have gone w/ drier one.

Absolutely fabulous recipe !  And, although the sauce is great, you can add chicken broth and make even more gravy.  We have enjoyed this recipe often.

Great taste, edited a bit.  Used chopped garlic from jar, about 2 TBSP, added 1TBP of basil to mixture.  Cooked for 2 hours (original recipe I had from this page said 2 hrs, which was perfect.  Also used PORK SHOULDER ROAST instead...super juicy and tasty!

Delicious!  I seared the pork with some olive oil in a cast iron skillet before putting in oven.  Used beef broth in place of wine for making gravy.  Served it to company who LOVED it and went back for seconds!  A definite keeper.  Served with wild rice and broccoli slaw for a perfect fall supper.

The roast was juicy and flavourful.  I was careful not to overcook and pulled it out of the oven when the temperature was 150F and let it sit under a tinfoil hat for 10 minutes while I finished the sauce.  I used a combination of white wine and chicken stock for te sauce as I am not sure that I like a lot of wine in cooking.

Just ok. Not enough flavor, and meat wasn't dry, but not moist either. I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled + as my roast was 5lbs. I used a meat probe and this took 2.5 hours.

We tried this tonight and thought it was ok. I followed the recipe and the rosemary was a bit strong for us.  I will probably make again, only use left rosemary and more garlic.

I doubled this recipe for a 4.45# boneless roast.  The flavor was great but this roast was so TOUGH and dry.  There was plenty of liquid and I basted it numerous times during cooking.   Perhaps I should have cooked it at a lower temp. than 350 for a longer period of time?

Didn't care for it. Two stars because it was edible, and we had nothing else to eat. Something was too strong and left a manky taste. No one was very thrilled, and I even made the additional gravy with chicken broth that most reviewers raved about, which was not bad. The coating on the meat itself is what we believe offensive. Not for us.

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out awful.! Not one person in my house finished their portion.  The rosemary gives it a weedy taste...like the loin was rolled in grass before cooking.  Also the cooking time is way too much.  I checked it after an hour and it was completly cooked.

Absolutely the best pork roast I have ever made and/or eaten!  Make sure you cut the pockets deep enough to put the garlic/rosemary/olive oil mixture to permeate the meat.  The flavor of the meat was so succulent...my granddaughter was wanting more and more...(and she is the picky eater)...served it with mashed potatoes, home canned green beans, corn bread from home ground corn meal, and the white wine mixed with the pan juices...I added a pat of butter to the juices to strengthen the sauce.  Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!

I had never cooked pork loin before, and had never eaten it either. Someone gave me a pork loin so I tried this recipe and it was delicious! It was very moist and very flavorful. I will definitely make it again.

Tried this recipe, and boy was it a big hit. Because, my sister is not a big fan of rosemary, I used Italian Herb seasoning instead and she just loved it. I didn't have any olive oil so I used some Italian salad dressing in it place. I didn't right the recipe done so I add the oil and dressing together, poured it all on to the roast then cooked it. Thought this recipe would be good for a turkey breast too.  samhe1

First off, cooking time way too long. 45 minutes is enough time. I know rosemary can be to taste but this was way too much. Stick to my own reipe for this.

Delicious!  Easy easy easy.  Used herbes de provence since I was out of rosemary.  Boil down the juices and wine well to make a light but incredibly flavored "sauce."

This was just ok for me.  I cooked until 160 and let it rest, but thought it was dry.  Flavor was just ok.  Don't think I'd make this one gain.

I'd give the end product 5 starts, but the recipe itself only 4 because I would have liked more direction on the salt and pepper. It's hard to know what "salt and pepper to taste" is when the meat is raw. What is a normal range of salt and pepper for this recipe? I ended up with about 1 tsp of salt and the same in freshly ground pepper. Everything came out amazingly delicious. I also baked for 45 minutes at 375 and pulled it out when it got to 155. It came up to 160 as it rested.

Very tasty combination of the rosemary and garlic - I also added ground cumin which was great. BUT, my pork loin came out very over done at 160°. Next time I make this recipe I’ll take it out of the oven at closer to 135-145° to let it rest and carry over under foil.

I made this last night.  I don't usually eat pork and this was very, very good.  I mixed all the fixings and put it into a plastic bag and let it marinade for about 3 hours.  Then popped it into the oven.  Had it with Risotto with asparagus off this site and steamed broccoli out of the garden. Very good.  Can hardly wait for leftovers tonight.

My boyfriend chose to make this recipe for our Vday dinner this year. To start, we thought it was bland, and tasted of only garlic. The meat was dry. And there was too much oil. I believe the white wine should have went into the oven with the roast at the beginning and not added at the end. I think it was also a bad choice of meat on our part. We had a small  pork tenderloin (not the 2 pound meat required in the recipe).    Overall, a very bad experience.

Excellent! Juicy and delicious. The broth has a great flavor.  I added small red potatoes and carrots (halfway through cooking time), and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  I cooked in a covered dish for about an hour and a half.

I made this following the suggestions by the first reviewer that's listed--roasted w/ veggies, poured the white wine over all; PLUS I wrapped the loin in bacon.  SO good!!!  This is a fantastic basic recipe that you can adjust and play with to suit your tastes!  Plus it's so easy-- Thanks Kathleen!

This has great flavor could cook a little less as it was a bit dry. I had to add broth after about 15 minutes to the pan as there was no juice being produced. The family enjoyed. I placed the leftovers in the crockpot on low for 5 hours, drained used a fork to pull apart and added BBQ Sauce. This made for wonderful pulled pork sandwiches.

Yum!  This was good, however I forgot to turn and baste it, and when I added the wine to the pan juices, the sauce I made just tasted burnt.  I used a 2.2 pound loin and took it out after 2 hours, even though the meat thermometer still showed it was just below 160.  I waited about 20 minutes before cutting into it, but it still was a bit on the dry side.  But for my first time cooking a pork loin it wasn't bad :)  I served it with Onion Roasted Sweet Potatoes from this website.

This recipe was delicious!  My only variation was to let the pork marinate for an hour prior to roasting.  I am not a very experienced cook, and this was so easy and received rave reviews at our Christmas gathering.  I will make this again and again

Have cooked for many years and was told that this was the best roast of pork I have ever cooked.  Definitely will use this recipe again.  Didn't have any white wine so just made regular gravy.  The garlic made it very flavourful.  Wine would have made it that much better.  Used a meat thermometer, removed roast from oven at 160 degrees and let it sit about 20 minutes.  Was really moist.  Cold leftovers have been tasty too.

This turned out delicious so thank you for a great recipe.  I had fresh rosemary on hand so I chopped it very, very fine and mixed it with the garlic, olive oil and panko bread crumbs to make a crust.  When just about done, I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the crust further.  The whole family, including 2 teenagers, really loved it, so thanks again!

Made this tonight and my fiancee really loved it!  I personally don't like pork though, of any nature, so I tweaked the recipe a bit--and glad I did!  I didn't have time to marinate this, so instead I punctured holes every inch and placed a thinly sliced garlic clove inside of the pork tenderloin; then I followed that with a salt/pepper/rosemary rub on the outside (w/ olive oil).  I only had a 1lb tenderloin so I baked it on 350 for 45 minutes.  Came out yummy!!  The garlic inside the pork really added flavor to the meat.  I'm no chef and this turned out great, so 5 stars on easiness (but only gave it 4 since pork is usually yuck) :)

I liked it but I felt that the rosemary flavor was overpowering - I'll use less next time.  I also think it would be good in a slow cooker with golden mushroom soup

Simple and flavorful.  I used my mini food processor and made the garlic rosemary paste and smeared it all over.  I let it sit overnight and then brought to room temperature before roasting it.  Using a meat thermometer helped me gauge exactly when the loin was ready.  Tender, succulent, and so moist.  My husband had to go back for seconds and then thirds.  The only thing is that I did not get a lot of pan drippings, so my wine sauce was a little weak on flavor.  Since I have rosemary plants, I think I will be doing this one often!!!

I usually cut my pork loin into pork chops, so I found this recipe, which looked too simple to taste as heavenly as it did! Anyway to use with pork chops, I just smooshed some of the "paste" (btw I have a rosemary plant so always use fresh and always use more than the recipe calls for :)between each pork chop, set them each one on top of the other in a ziploc bag, let them sit in the fridge for the entire day til dinner time.. When it came time to cook them I fired up the BBQ and set them on the grill, rosemary leaves and all. Everyone, including myself, thought these were hands-down THE BEST PORK CHOPS ever.
I tried using this recipe on a roasted pork loin and it was nowhere near as tasty as the grilled chops were. Thus, I'd sincerely advise, if you have a pork loin, cut it into chops instead of wasting it in the oven :)

I very rarely take the time to write a review but this one was absolutely unbelieveable.!  It only took me about 10 minutes to prep.  My roast only took and hour to cook and my house smelled GREAT!  The meat was sooooo tender and tastely.  This is now a staple for my family.  LOVED IT

My boyfriend made this while I was out for a girl's night.  He said it was so good he couldn't stop eating it and ate nearly the entire two pound roast.  He replaced the white wine with vegetable/chicken broth because we didn't have any wine in the house.  He absolutely loved it!

We thought this pork recipe was wonderful!  I used chicken stock instead of the white wine and it was still great.  Be sure to use lots of thinly chopped garlic.  If you use enough, the pork will be very flavorful!

Fabulous, the meat even had great flavor leftover the next day in a salad.  I used a 4lb bone-in roast and used a meat thermometer and doubled the recipe. Will definately make again!

This turned out nice, but it was not as infused with flavor as I expected.  I would definately poor the juices over the pork more often while it is cooking.  The left overs were great though.  I sliced them into strips and heated them in some butter over the stove, cooking it a second time with onions and peppers.  We used this as fajitas.

I would not recommend stuffing the paste into the meat.  For me it left pockets of really bitter herb-ness in the meat.  Had to scrape it off/out of the slices for it to be edible.  I cooked a 1.4lb loin roast in a covered dish at 320 for about 1hr with a little wine drizzled over the top.  Next time I'm going to try skipping the wine entirely and put apple slices in the bottom of the dish about 15min before the roast is done.  Going to trade thyme for rosemary also.  The only good thing about this as is was that the meat was pretty tender.

This was very tasty and simple to make.  I cut a 2-lb. roast into four sections before rubbing the seasoning mixture on it, then I marinated it overnight in some extra olive oil.  I may do some tweaking in the future but it was perfect for a relatively quick meal.  Oh, and it didn't take even an hour and 15 minutes to cook since it was cut up before cooking.

The cooking time was a little too long.  I forgot about resting time prior to serving.  Next time, I'll take it out of the oven 10-15 minutes earlier and tent it to finish off.  I also used fresh rosemary, rather than crushed, and it was great.

So delicious! This recipe made the best pork loin I have ever had, the rosemary gave it a slightly woodsey flavour that was set off by the garlic and wine sauce. I added some onions ontop of the roast as it cooked, making it even tastier!

This is a great recipe! My family loved it. I altered the recipe just a bit using 3/4 tbl. of rosemary and I only needed to cook the 3-4 lb. pork loin for 1 1/2 hrs. Came out great.  Since we had leftovers, I stored it with the pan dripping mix.  It is still moist and delicious on the second day.

The rosemary flavor was a little strong, so I might suggest using the rosemary/garlic mix just as a rub.  But overall, this was fantastic!

rosemary is good but thats about all this roast was- rosemary.
the wine sauce on the other hand was great. The next day it tasted even better. i'll definitely make this again for the sake o the sauce.

This is yummy. I added the wine before cooking. I also cut up some red potatoes and threw those in with the pork. I cooked my 2lb roast for about and hour and 15 min. I then took the juices added some flour and made a gravy. This is a great dinner.

A very easy and delicious recipe, My husband and I really enjoyed it.  We will probably not use the rosemary again, because we are not fond of the taste, but other than that it was really good.

Lessen the amt of rosemary if it's not your favorite. It can be kinda strong.  I also marinated in fridge for a couple hours and used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done.  Very moist and yummy!

Turned out great following the directions here.  Though our roast did not take 2 hours (at 1.5 hrs was 180 degrees), but still tender.  I recommend checking the internal temp of the meat starting at 1 hour.

I used a 3-4 pound pork shoulder roast with this recipe, and I used roasted garlic instead of minced raw garlic. (I cut an entire head of garlic until the tips of each clove was showing, drizzled with olive oil, wrapped the head in aluminum foil, and stuck it in the oven on 400 for 45 minutes.) Squeezing the roasted garlic out from the head and mashing it up made much more of a "paste" to rub into the cuts in the meat and all over the outside. I went ahead and added the white wine to the pan and let it cook along with the roast. I covered the roast and cooked it for 4.5 hours on 275. It was fall-apart tender and smelled great while cooking. Yum!

My family loved it. I used fresh rosemary and and some thyme as others suggested. The 2nd time I cooked this I used 1/2 wine and 1/2 sherry vinegar. I deglazed the pan with a few more tbsp. of the vinegar and it made a wonderful rich gravy.

I found this recipe very overpowering and dry. The rosemary should be cut in half of what the recipe says. I cooked this pork a little over an hour with checking a meat thermometer to 160 degrees. We cook pork loins a lot and no one in our family cared for this and we are not picky eaters.

I like the combination of rosemary, garlic and pork and it smelled wonderful as it was roasting. My meat was dry however after cooking at 250 for 2 hours and basting throughout. I thought slow roasting it would make it more tender, but not so. Will try again at the recommended temperature and make sure not to overcook.

I used a loin that was 2.5 pounds and the cooking time was way too long. It was dry enough to flake like tuna and had a livery taste to it. No thank you.

I marinated the loin in the seasoning about 2-3 hours beforehand.  I added slightly more wine (and added before baking).  I also threw in some large pieces of onions, mushrooms and garlic cloves that I had on hand.  Very moist and tons of flavor!

Very good.  I also added some thyme, and made mine in the crockpot.  Next time I might try marinating the pork as some reviewers suggested.

I made this dish two weeks ago...it was delicious.  I never attempted a pork roast, just pork chops before, i guess i was a little intimidated...it was so flavorful and wonderful.  My husband and 3 year old also loved it.  I used red wine instead of white, and it worked well.  I am making it again tonight!

The flavor of this roast was delicious....but like most said, ALL ovens are different.  I do not have a meat thermometer, so I overcooked it a bit (and I only cooked it for 1.5 hours on 325!)

My family has loved this! Even my three and one year old have been eating leftovers of this dish! We used rosemary, sage, a bit of thyme and sherry (all I had on hand) instead of white wine. I added potatoes and carrots and it was a huge hit at our house!

Fantastic.  Made this for the holidays, and the who family enjoyed.  Do not make in a pyrex dish.  The glass can shatter when you add the wine.  Found out the hard way once.

Fantastic.  Suggest adding more stuffing (double) to suggested pounds of pork.  Also suggest cutting multiple pockets into pork in order to get more stuffing into every bite.  Was a HUGE hit.

It took 2 1/2 hours for the pork to reach 160 degrees.  So ultimately it came out dry.
I also am not crazy for rosemary.

Pork turned out nicely. Used two loins that were just under a pound each. Only comment from hubby was that it could have used a sauce --> My fault since I was slammed in the kitchen and spaced the step with the wine. I think the flavors were good, though. I roasted covered for about 1.25 turning after 45 minutes and left uncovered to brown the last 15 or 20 minutes. I didn't eat any of this myself, but it was pretty quickly gobbled up at the dinner party for 8 (had roasted rosemary chicken breasts, as well). This would also taste great on the grill with easier cleanup for sure. Simple way to flavor a pork loin. Served with roasted rosemary red potatoes and a couple hearty vegetable casseroles.

I cooked it in the oven the first time, then I followed A Steitz's recommendations and made this in the crock pot and it was even more yummy!  Definitely let the meat cook in the wine, it is sooooo much better.

Delicious!  I cooked this using the convection option on the oven.  It was very juicy and tasty.  Even the kids loved it.  I didn't have the wine so didn't do that part but will try next time.

This was great and tasty and easy. I put the onion and fresh rosemary from my garden in a chopper with a little olive oil and made the paste. I cut slitts in the top and rubbed the in paste. It was easy. Everyone loved it. Its a definate remake for me.

This got mixed reviews at home.  My husband and 16-year-old didn't care for the rosemary flavor.  My 13-year-old couldn't get enough of it!  I thought it was very good, too.  We served it with roasted red potatoes, steamed veggies, and dinner rolls.  Very filling!

Very easy and delicious.  Used 1 teaspoon of oil to make garlic paste.  Instead of rosemary used chives.  Did not add the wine to make a sauce as the cut meat was almost all gone. Thank you for this keeper!

I used this recipe with a 2.75 lb bone-in pork rib roast.  I adjusted the amount of garlic and rosemary to taste.  I used fresh rosemary since I had some.  At first I thought the wine sauce was bitter, but after dipping my meat about 3 times, I couldn't get enough.  I served this with twice baked sweet potatoes and mashed cauliflower.

Awesome! The meat was so juicy, tender and flavorful this is a very welcomed recipe with our family. I made this three times now. First time as written but I personally though 1/2 cup of wine was way too much. The 2nd and 3rd time I only used 1/8 cup wine and what an outstanding flavorful gravy. Thanks for sharing this!

We followed the directions for our 1 kg pork roast and cooked it for 1 hr and 15 min.  Temp was 160 with the thermometer and was a bit dry (the juices in the pan made it perfect).  Next time will check it after 1 hr.  Was great with mashed potates and beans.  Even my picky kids loved it. Wonderful new years 2006 dinner!  Thanks

yum - even my husband can make this (with a meat thermometer). Though lately my pork has been coming in 2 small loins, so I got some butcher's twine--the small ones cook too fast.

HA - here is a p.s. two years later, to the day. We still make this frequently but let the two pieces roast separately - with the meat thermometer in the smaller one. When that one reaches 163 it comes out, rests, and we eat it. The second one is perfect for slicing and reheating the next day.

Wonderfully easy recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving using pork tenderloin fillets  and I also added some fresh sage to the spice paste. It was a huge hit with my guests. The guys devoured it! I will be making this again.

This meal was so easy and delicious!  As others advised I used a meat themometer to determine when the meat was done and it was perfect.  I also used fresh rosemary instead of dried which gave it a bolder flavor.  I will definately add this into my rotation of everyday dinners, although I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.

This was a good way to cook pork loin, which never seems to turn out for me too well.  I, too, used a meat thermometer and lucky that I did.  My roast, which was even bigger than the 2# one called for, took much less than 2 hours.  I think that it would have turned out dry had I kept it in longer.  It was a good taste, even though mine was pre-seasoned (it came from Costco).

Fantastic recipe! I had a precooked pork loin and used more garlic and wine. I rotated and basted the thing every 15 minutes in a covered pan and sliced it immediately after taking it out. Spoon the juice over the top to let it soak in a little... man... great stuff.

This is a great change of pace for pork.  It's great for any night of the week or for dinner parties.  Easy to prepare.  I usually use a smaller roast and adjust cook time.

This is almost the same recipe I've used for years!  Everyone loves it! If you like a thick gravy for mashed potatoes, the garlic, pork juices and rosemary make one of the best gravies I've ever had.  Just add a little arrowroot or flour and thicken it up to desired consistency.  Fabulous recipe!

I made this in the crockpot with potatoes and carrots as someone suggested.  Unfortunately, I used too many potatoes (4 pounds maybe?) and it took forever to cook.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours and realized that it would not be done in 6 hours.  I had to cook it an addtional 3-4 hours on high!  I really like the pork loin by itself and did not think the veggies were that special.  Next time, I will cook the pork loin by itself.

I preheated the oven to 300 degrees, used basil instead of rosemary, used 3/4 c. chicken broth instead of the white wine and baked in a covered dish.  It was delicious!

How can something so easy be SO GOOD!  I used a 4 lb loin and doubled the garlic & rosemary.  I didn't even bother with the wine step.  AWESOME stuff..though, I'm a garlic and a rosemary lover.

This was OK but thought it was a bit overpowering. I think it was because my pork loin was really small and there wasn't enough meat to absorb the extras.

The recipe was easy and pretty good followed as is. However the rosemary was overpowering in my opinion. I’d you less next time or maybe use Herbs d’Provence in place for flavor that didn’t overwhelm the pork. I will probably try searing the pork loin as well.

um, OK, I am not good at cooking meats. I've learned to use a thermometer and I try to go with the recipes as stated. I also read several reviews to capture the nuances. No one told me that pork tenderloin comes with 2 long pieces. Do I treat them separately? Do I twine them together? Did I get the wrong piece of meat? Someone said to throw veggies next to the meat, with the wine. Somehow my meat got too much liquid and I didn't get roasted loin, I got boiled loin! I had put the timer on for 1 hour, to check. The meat was very overdone. Also, do you cover it or not? Some people are covering their roast, the video doesn't. I didn't. I will try this recipe again because I know I did something wrong and I know this can be very good. I will twine the meats together, use very little wine and no veggies, no cover, and start checking the temp of the meat earlier.

Excellent flavour and so easy to make. Will be sure to use meat thermometer next time as it was a bit over done, 2.5 lb @ 350 for just one hour. As we have a gas oven might need to lower temp to 325.

Just made this for the second time in a month! This was amazing, and I didn't even make the wine sauce. We didn't like the sprigs of rosemary (I had to use dried), so next time I am going to try using ground rosemary.

I first had the pork loin in the crockpot for about 2.5 hours and noticed it was not cooking through so I put it in the oven for about 45 minutes and it turned out so moist and tasty.

This is our go to pork roast.  We made a few modifications, I use WAY more than 3 garlic cloves and I don't mince them, I make slits in the roast and shove them down in there all over.  We don't eat them but they give the meat a wonderful flavor.  I use quite a bit of olive oil, a ton of salt and pepper and work that down into the cuts as well.  I skip the wine so it's whole 30 compliant.

For leftovers, we boil potatoes and onions, dump out most of the water, add the pork drippings and diced pork (usually the slightly drier ends) add a few spoonfuls of arrowroot powder to a quarter cup of water and shake, add that to the mix, bring to a boil and let cool, then serve plain or over bread.  So good!  Definitely love this recipe.

I used a spice rub of rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano and parsley (equal parts each).  In my mini food processor, I mixed the spices with three cloves of garlic and a little olive oil.  I then rubbed the paste all over the roast and let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours.  I baked per the directions using a meat thermometer.  It was delicious.

Very good. I like garlic and rosemary. I had fresh rosemary growing in my yard, so I tried to use it. I don’t recommend it. It was very hard to crush with the garlic and oil. I tried using a mortal and passel with limited success. I also didn’t have the wine, had to leave it out. But all things considered, it was very tasty. My advice, follow the directions.

Left out the wine and roasted the pork with potatoes and large cut onion and garlic cloves. Afterward, made gravy with the drippings. My family raved!! Very tender and flavorful and will definitely make this again and again and again.

The roast was moist.  I didn’t make any changes.  The wine sauce was too thin.  If I make it again I would add some flour to make the sauce thicker.

I had vacuum frozen a 1.5 pork loin in sesame ginger sauce with a bit of red pepper. Added a 1/2 cup red wine to the bottom of the pan, then cooked  350 degrees, fat side up for 1  hour 15 minutes. Tented roast 10 minutes to rest and I scraped the pan for gravy. Gravy was 1 cup chicken broth, the pan drippings 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon corn starch and a splash of milk.  The roast was fantastic!  Will definitely always cook loin this way!

My husband and I both thought this was too bland... and it's not like he has to have things spicy.  He prefers meals not spicy...but this was not anything special to us.  In fact there's a lot of leftover pork loin in the fridge that I don't know what to do with.  Sorry.  :(

Very tasty.  I was going to sear the meat in the skillet, but I got lazy and put it directly in the oven. I didn't have just Rosemary so I used Italian seasoning. I probably would have done that anyway. I also put some beef stock in the pan because it's what I had.  I didn't bother making the sauce.  It was delicious and very juicy. I will definitely be putting this into regular rotation.

Came much better than I imagined. Not a huge, huge fan of rosemary.......but proof we loved it, is I didn't even use my traditional applesauce to dip the pork in.  Flavorful to say the least.

Good flavor. Dried out slightly, might cover with tinfoil next time. Meat was 2.2 lbs and took 1 hour to cook. Will make again.

I followed the “most helpful” comments (I ALWAYS do that!) and it turned out fantastic. Sooo good, in fact, that hubby bought another pork loin 3 days later! I’d say this was a HIT!

I really love garlic, added a few extra cloves of garlic, kept everything else as per recipe. It needed about 45 minutes longer to cook than stated in recipe, but worth it, the smell in the house is so good and it tastes like I ordered it at 5 star restaurant. Will definitely make again!

I have made This recipe two times, and this is my new go to recipe/method for pork loin. I used thyme rather than rosemary, only as a taste preference.   Usually do roast in crockpot - never again.

This is DELICIOUS! Followed the recipe to the dot, and then covered the pork with a layer of sliced onion. The gravy I made with a bit of corn starch to make it thicker and a dash of herbes de provence because the wine I used was really strong. Served it with mashed potatoes and sauté buttered carrots and chopped onions. Hubby said it was restaurant quality and I loved it! Almost finished it all by myself.

Made as written except for addition of chicken stock to pan sauce to reduce the acidity.Roasted x 90 min for a 2.5 lb roast. I think I would not make again as the are more interesting recipes on this site. Thank you.

I made this with 2 different changes only because I didn't have the original ingredients.  I substituted basil for rosemary & Peach Schnapps for the wine.  It is an easy recipe & will definitely make it again.

I had to improvise the paste but - 350 for 50 minutes - middle rack- was perfect. I then lit up the cast iron pan and scorched both sides for 2 min to gets some bits in the pan- deglazed with wine and pored over the pork. A+
Timing is critical with this cut- do it right or else...

We loved it!
 I used a meat thermometer 
I also put all ingredients in small Cuisinart with the oil
I used dry and fresh rosemary increasing the overall amt.
Then smeared all over roast
I put wine in the bottom of the Pyrex during cooking
YUM!

Moist & delicious! Didn't have any rosemary on hand, so used my Tastefully Simple Rustic Herb seasoning which has rosemary and a few other herbs in it.  Family loved it, except for a couple of picky kids who had to scrape off the "crust" before they'd eat it (their loss!).

A good sear seems needed. Too dry otherwise in my experience. Love the flavor though.

It was excellent. It was great to cook with a spice I hadn't used before.  I'm not a big fan of pork, but it was on sale for an extremely good price.  It was super easy to make, and since I'm not into cooking, this was perfect.

OK, but I reduced the garlic as I found it to over power the flavor of the meat, and added a hefty grind of black pepper or lemon pepper. Sometimes I roast small red potatoes along side of it. I also like to add a pinch of cornstarch to the pan drippings for  thicker sauce.

This was tasty and easy, the crowd liked it.  It took me turning the oven up to 375 and cooking it for an extra 40 minutes though.  I took a look at many reviews because I had a hunch this large hunk of meat would take longer and none really said they needed extra time.  Had I taken mine out after one hour, it would have been only 90 - 95 degrees.

I've made this twice, not really crazy about. It's very easy to prepare with ingredients I usually have on hand.  If I make it again I will reduce the rosemary and garlic and try some of the other reviewers suggestions.

Thank God your printed recipe indicated only 1 hour for this
roast. Your Video called for two hours for the same roast, and
truly would have been like shoe leather. This aggravates me to no end as someone there in your company is not paying attention to the completion and accuracy of your recipes and videos. Loin of Pork Roast is not cheap and had my eye not
caught the time difference in your video as compared to the
printed recipe, I would have wasted a good deal of time, money and energy.

I hardly ever review recipes because I hardly ever really follow them, I'm usually using them for ideas. I'm just not a recipe follower, but I have to leave this review b/c this "recipe" really surprised me (even though I didn't use fresh garlic, but powder instead. This simple marriage of garlic and rosemary REALLY made the pork pop! I've had such bad luck with (boneless) pork loin roasts, hence the recipe search in the first place. I had a hard time believing 5-stars for such simple seasoning (and such an ordinary, low-maintenance cooking method). But I went ahead and couldn't believe how WOWED I was! There's always the chance my meat quality was higher, but I will definitely make this again, probably going for the fresh garlic next time. This puts  pork loin back on our menu!

Tasty but I wish the meat was browner. It looked pale and unappetising. I'm glad I made the wine gravy which made it look more appealing. I think next time, I'll turn on the broiler to brown it more. I used a 1 1/2 lb. pork loin and it was done in 35 minutes. I did let it sit for 5 minutes. I'll try again.

It did not take anywhere near that long to cook.  I  almost over cooked it but took it out to baste and checked the temp.  Was not a fan of the rosemary inside.  It was too over powering and the sauce was GROSS.  We didn't serve it .

Made this, with a few adjustments.  Instead of Rosemary, I used thyme, and I used a shiraz.  I added cubed potatoes and onions to the pan, and covered with aluminum foil.  Done to perfection after about 2 hours.

This was so delicious! Used my digital thermometer to be sure I wouldn't overcook. moved it when the internal temperature reached 145°F. Let rest for 10 minutes and then served. I confess that I didn't have fresh garlic so I substituted granulated garlic. It still turned out perfectly. This will be one of my new go to recipes!

I went on a whim and made this for a family gathering for the first time and wasn't disappointed.  Easy to make and used 4 pork tenderloins and doubled the "sauce" and it worked out great.

I made this using a rather thick 2.75 pound pork loin, so I cooked it for about 20 minutes at 400°, and then lowered the temperature to 375° for the remaining 40 minutes. I also added another clove of garlic, due to both the size of the pork loin and personal preference. It came out perfect - moist and tender, and mouth wateringly tasty. I cook for my elderly father, who isn't a big fan of pork even though he'll eat it, and he was raving about it. He even has designs on the leftovers for his lunch today! I would highly recommend this recipe, and it's now my new go-to recipe the next time there's a sale on pork loin. Delicious!

I know people are loving this.  I have to say it was just okay.  Maybe an off night for cooking, I don't know.  I have been trying a lot of roast recipes lately and this one just doesn't stack up with the rest of them.  It was fine to try once.  It is not going in my repeat cookbook however.  Give it a try though.

I tried to follow AbsintheMinded0's modifications. It was nice an moist, but even leaving it uncovered for 5" left it looking gray and cadaverous. Reasonable flavor, though too much garlic for my taste. The wine was a good idea. What would have made it look browned and more appetizing?

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to make too many changes that deviated from the original recipe. I used a 2.1lb pork tenderloin, for the rub I used sage, minced garlic, thyme, onion powder, salt, pepper, olive oil and basil. I still pierced the meat and stuffed the holes and rubbed the pork down with the rub. I put mine in for 60 minutes and at 55 minutes checked it, it was already up to 165 degrees! Needless to say, it wasn't tough but it was too dry for my taste. Flavors were incredible though. **TIP** Do not use Cooking White Wine. I thought I could get away with it but it was a tad too salty. It smelled and tasted good but next time I will use an actual white wine.** I will also cut the cooking time down to 45 minutes next time.

Only changes I made was to increase the cloves of garlic (as the entire head of garlic had rather small cloves) to 8 and the rosemary I used half a package. To further release the oil from the rosemary I coarse chopped the leaves and pressed using mortar  with pedestal. Reason the big increase of these 2 ingredients is that any meat from grocery, especially pork cuts truly have no flavor; given mass produced pork isn’t finished fed with corn. So if anyone that was disappointed with lack of flavor from the garlic and rosemary, try this recipe again and increase those 2 key ingredients. Last notation, if cutting slits in roast not your thing, have meat dept cut your boneless pork roast so you can lay it flat, spread your seasoning ingredients (like buttering bread) roll it up and tie off. Happy roasting!

Thoroughly enjoyed my pork roast. Came out tender and juicy. Used a slightly larger roast than the recipe calls for, but used a meat thermometer to make sure it was done and it was delicious, even as leftovers.

Juicy and delicious, i made a few adjustments for this recipe by adding cumin, garlic and onion powder, as well as dried oregano and fresh rosemary to the dry ingredients. I mixed half of the dry mix  with the fresh garlic and the other half I reserved to sprinkle on the roast right before putting in the oven. I also pan seared for 2 minutes on each side to give it a nice golden brown exterior, sprinkled said leftover dry rub mixture and threw it in the oven at the specified temperature and it stayed there until it was around 145 degrees or medium.  I also used half a cup of red wine and half a cup of chicken stock for deglazing the pan. It was a crowd favorite for my family, will make again the next time i see pork loin on sale.

Made this tonight...simple, easy!  The only problem I encountered was that it took 3 hours to cook a 5 lb. roast so we didn't end up eating it until 8 pm.  Other than that, it was delicious!!!  I will make it again but start cooking it earlier.

This might have been the best pork loin I've ever had. I used a citrus wine and added orange slices to the top and it turned out phenomenal.

After reading A Steitz's review I decided to go her way with the crockpot.  I put a frozen 2 1/2 lb loin pork roast in the crockpot.  Added all other ingredients.  Started off on High for 1 hour and then lowered to low for 7 hours.  Temp was well over 145.  But, it  was tender and moist.  Will do this again.

Great recipe. Very simple and basic. Roast comes out lovely and very flavorful. 
I admit, however, that I did not turn the roast over while it was baking...but it still came out perfectly!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband had purchased a 5lb pork loin so we more than doubled the rest of the ingredients.  We did have to cook it an extra 15 minutes, but no big deal.  I don't cook too often, so I was nervous that this might not turn out as well as I had hoped.  But my husband can not stop telling me how good it is and how he can't wait to have his friends and family over for dinner !

Yes , I added Honey & a orange marmalade . It turned out great . I am currently residing in Calgary which is at quite a high altitude so I always cook at a bit higher temp. is this right?

I made the recipe exactly as written. I do agree with other users that it needed to be seared first. It was pretty good, but could have used more garlic in my opinion. The Rosemary is very overwhelming. The searing may have helped with that. Overall, good, but needed a little improvement.

I have made this a couple of times for family dinners. Very easy and comes out great. I might try fresh rosemary, my husband thinks he is eating straw with the dried rosemary.

My wife is not the cook in our family, but I found her this recipe, and my entire family loves it. It makes the pork so tender, juicy and well seasoned. It's one of a handful of recipes she does that we all crave regularly.

It was very tender juicy and flavorful.  If using dried rosemary, I would definitely use less next time.  It was pretty strong, but it did not ruin the flavor.

I was looking for an easy pork loin recipe I could make for my father and me while I was out shoveling snow... (Thank you blizzard Stella). As I was lining up all the ingredients, i realized I didn't have dried rosemary. I did however have it growing in a bright window next to a withering basil plant. (Neither do well indoors in the northeast). So I used a mix of dried basil and fresh rosemary to solve my issue. The pork turned out great. I would totally make this again. I always appreciate other reviews and comments, as they help in either choosing and or tweaking a recipe. Thanks!

The taste was fine, not great. I should have left it covered until closer to the end of the cooking time, and just uncovered for the last 1/2 hour. It was a bit dry, not the fault of the recipe. 
I think I would try something else next time

This recipe is easy to make and delicious. It's hard to beat that combination. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I did not turn over the roast. It took 1:10 for a 2.5# roast to cook.

This was pretty good. I made some modifications, since I didn't have any wine on hand. I added one more garlic clove (since I REALLY like garlic) and in lieu of wine I used 1/3 cup of olive oil instead of 1/4 cup. I was also pretty heavy handed in putting salt and pepper into the mixture. The flavor didn't seem to get into some areas of the roast, but otherwise, it came out pretty good! I think that I will use less oil next time to get the sauce to become more of a paste and less oily so that it will be easier to "focus" the flavor into the meet.

I had a 3.5 lb. roast to use so followed directions for the roast with the rub.  Wonderful flavor !!!  I did not use the wine but made a sauce with raspberry jam, some pan dripppings, and horseradish.  Family raved over the roast.

Marinated it overnight, otherwise followed directions. It was good but kind of dry. Cooked on a bed of sliced onion, alongside potatoes and carrots.

Rolled the pork loin in the foil-lined pan, used jarred minced garlic instead of fresh, and used leftover roasted vegetables instead of making a gravy out of the drippings so I omited the white. Husband thought it was delicious! Will definitely make again.

This was so moist and tasty.  The only thing is it took about 10 minutes longer and I had to turn oven up to 425 degrees for last 10 minutes.  Never got crispy, but tasted really good. I now call it  my "Greek Inspired Tenderloin".  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe even though when I went to make the paste I didn't have any rosemary :( Nonetheless even with the substitution of herbs de provincial it came out pretty darn good! I have a tendency to over cook port loin roasts but this came out perfectly!

I didn't have fresh herbs available this time but it still turned out to be a really easy, tasty recipe.  The meat was perfectly cooked and moist.  Also, love the sauce! Can't wait to try it again with the fresh herbs.

I had only a one-pound loin but I followed the recipe otherwise and the flavor was very good.  My husband liked the flavor also.  I would make this again.  I do have to be careful, though, because the drippings burned onto the pan so I could not make any gravy out of them.  Maybe I'll be lucky next time.

I love that this roast only requires a few staple ingredients, yet it is so delicious!  The roast turns out juicy and flavorful every time I make it.  My husband and I love this roast and will continue to make it in the future.  Highly recommend!

Truly moist and delicious.  I put the wine in roaster at onset.  Didn't even baste.  Made a sauce with chicken broth and pan drippings while the roast was "resting."  So easy and yummy.

Just made this last night did almost exactly as directed except switched the olive oil for butter  without mashing anything up mixed the ingredients and rubbed all over and starting with the fat side up, broiled both sides for 10 minutes each before going to 350 degrees to cook the rest of the way through. Mine took a little longer because it was a very thick cut but was so succulent and mouth watering we eat every last bite!!

I used a no hormone, natural pork loin roast 4.7 lbs,  and organic ingredients for everything else, I replaced the oil with shallot butter (home made), crushed garlic, rosemary, changed the salt with organic seasoned salt.  Cooked in a covered roaster on a bed of sweet onion @350 degrees for 3 hours, until the internal temperature reached 165 degrees.  The roast was very tender and the a jus was amazing.  I served it with sauerkraut, Brussel sprouts, potatoes, Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again.

This was a pretty easy and great tasting roast, however, next time I'll use about half the rosemary.

Was very good, we really enjoyed it. Next time I'll use less oil, and prepare this the night before so it infuses the meat a bit more. As someone else mentioned about cooking time, in my connection oven it took only 90 min to cook 2 1/2 pounds to temp.

I mistakenly bought a pre-cooked pork loin, so this didn't have to cook as long as the recipe says. It was good, but I imagine it would have been better if it had spent longer in the oven or had I marinated the pre-cooked loinovernight.

I love the flavor of Rosemary but my husband hates it.  So I cut the Rosemary in half.  There was so much juice that I couldn't make a sauce out of it.   I wouldn't have used it anyway.  The flavor was perfect.  Meat was tender and moint  I used the meat thermometer and took the roast out at 145 and let it sit for 20 min.  EXCELLENT

Amazing recipe! This was my first roast ever and it turned out perfect. I would highly recommend using an oven-safe meat thermometer to get it cooked just right. The sauce you get from adding white wine to the drippings is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.

Great flavor! My roast turned out somewhat dry so perhaps I will cover it the next time.  I also browned my pork loin in olive oil prior to baking and used chicken broth and fresh rosemary I had on hand leftover from Thanksgiving.

I did not change a thing, although I cooked it a little too long because I could not believe it would cook so fast.  I will definitely make it again, according to the specific degree of temperature on the meat thermometer.  It was very tender and juicy just the same.  Definitely a keeper!

Followed the recipe, and made a quick, easy and tasty dinner for spontaneous get-together with next door neighbors.  Pork came out tender and juicy, but next time will use some of the advice from other reviewers to "pump up" the flavor.

This did not turn out well.  It smelled great baking, but ended up dry.  I only baked it for an hour - 1.5 pound loin.  I made the sauce to go with it and it was not good.  All I could taste was wine.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the meal was a total disappointment.

HOLEY MOLEY this came out AMAZE-BALLS!! I took the advice of the most helpful positive review and marinated my some 2.2lb of pork loin overnight and most of the next day. Though I'll be honest I didn't measure ANYTHING. I put the meat in a ziplock bag with a good dabble of olive oil, salt, pepper, and 6 cloves of chopped garlic. Mixed it all and left it in the fridge. The next morning I added a sprinkle of rosemary and put it back in the fridge after mixing. About 5hrs later I put the lovely smelling loin on a bed of carrots, chopped celery, green beans, and onion (where were also tossed with salt and olive oil)- covered everything with aluminum foil and put it in the oven. It took about 1.5hr to get to temperature using a meat thermometer. I forgot the wine but it tastes amazing without. TRY! /

I followed the directions pretty much spot on except used jarred crushed garlic. Did anyone else have a lot of burnt bits in the pan? And a lot of fat. So when I added the wine, and scraped it produced a burnt tasting sauce. Maybe it was my choice of garlic. Also was a little overcooked at the 145 on my meat thermometer.

I added lemon juice and Dijon mustard to this recipe  and marinated in my refrigerator over night. I browned the roast first on the stove top, then roasted it as instructed. Came out juicy and tender.

I copied the first review. She had made a thick almost paste with the garlic, rosemary and olive oil.  At this point I had no salt or pepper in this and still marinated for about an hour.  Cooked at 350 for an hour and 25 minutes. Let it rest and used the liquid in the roaster for a creamy gravy. Because I had incorporated an acorn squash in the mashed potatoes, I used a little nutmeg with the gravy.  To accomplish this, I brought the pan liquid back to a boil and slowly added flour until it became a roux. I didnt have wine so I used milk and this gravy became a scruptious pale beige. At this point I added the nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Very, very silky and yummy. I hope you try this version. I will make it again for sure!!

I made this and it turned out great. Cook time is really 1 hour 35 minutes and it doesn't say add the olive oil with rosemary, garlic, salt pepper. For the paste. I actually made cuts across and stuffed the loin in stead of knife marks.

11.08.16 ~ A pork loin loaded with flavor. I had a 1# pork loin, so I cut all the ingredients in half. I couldn't baste as it cooked as the juice in the pan dried up, although the pork was very moist. Served this with 'Alyson's Broccoli Salad', 'Chef John's Roasted Butternut Squash' from AR and Brussels Sprouts. We enjoyed a really nice meal.

This was delicious :) I used a lot more fresh rosemary than was asked for a marinated it for a while before putting it in the oven. My 3lbs roast was done in 1.5 hours. Thank you!

Not bad, just not wonderful. We thought it lacked richness of flavor. Perhaps it would be more tasty grilled.

Great results with little time & effort. Use a meat thermometer, left it in a couple of minutes too long (guestimated cook time for a 1.1 lb loin) and turned out a little drier than I had hoped. But the recipe is resilient due to the olive oil, seasons and pan sauce. Will make again and it may become a routine meal.

Great recipe! I didn't have rosemary so I used basil as another review had suggested. I cooked a nearly 3 lb. roast at 325 for 1-1/2 hours and it was absolutely perfect. No more slow cooker for pork roasts, this will be my go-to recipe.

This was amazing.   Followed directions (although may have put a tad more garlic in).   Used 2-1/4 pound loin and cooked for just over an hour.  It was so delicious that there was only a small amount left -- which means 2 adults and 2 kids (9) enjoyed it greatly.   Husband already asked when I was making again.      I did add small potatoes to pan last 40 minutes.

So delicious and moist! I basted it every 15 minutes and it was done in 60 (3 pound roast). It looked great and tasted better. I will definitely make this again!

We was disappointed.  I followed the recipe, except I didn't cook it is long as recommended and it came out dry and not very tasty.  I am glad I took it out early.

Excellent. 3 lb roast, 1 Tbsp dried rosemary & 1Tbsp dried basil, 3 heavy Tbsp jarred diced garlic, salt & pepper, about half teaspoon each. Marinated after poking holes throughout.  Best pork roast i have ever had, much less made. Wine drippings were awesome. Served with baby potatoes, roasted asparagus and cinnamon apples cooked. Worthy of a 5 star restaurant.

My wife does not enjoy rosemary, so I used Herb de Provance.  Use a thermometer and 145 is perfect. The wine sauce at the end is ideal.  Thanks Kathleen.

I've made this twice following the directions exactly. It is delicious. My only caution is that the timing seems to vary wildly, so you should leave extra time just in case, and plan accordingly. Last night, it took 3 hours for a small roast. I've baked plenty of other things in my oven without issue, so it is working fine.

I made this and put it in the crockpot with carrots and mushrooms and a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of white wine.  Or you can use a cup of IPA beer.  So good and my husband and son loved it.  You also can add potatoes or whatever other vegees you like.

I made it exactly as the recipe describes. It just was too bland. Not enough flavor and I let it marinade for a few hours. I probably won't make this again.

This is the absolutely the BEST pork roast I have ever had! My husband even made it one evening when I was sick. I served it with Nanny's green beans made w/ only bacon and sugar and boiled in a small amount of chick broth and water. WE LOVE BOTH RECIPES!

Very good recipe.  My family especially likes to layer the pork on top of mashed potatoes and pour the gravy on top.  I have made this pork loin recipe many times with all excellent reviews from my family.  I do salt to our taste with a mixture of garlic salt and kosher salt.

Great recipe.  Used a 3.5 pound roast.  Seasoned the roast with 1 tsp kosher salt first.  Then for the rub, I smashed together 4 cloves fresh minced garlic and 1 tsp kosher salt with the back of a spoon ( the salt acts as an abrasive as well as seasoning).  Then I added 2 TBS olive oil, and 1 tsp dried sage, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 1 tsp dried thyme all crushed in the mortar and pestle to bring out the flavor, and 1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper and mixed it well.  I rubbed it all over the roast   then baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  Meanwhile I boiled the potatoes and let cool.  I coated with olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.  I put them on the side of my baking dish and added 1/2 a chunked onion and 2 very  thinly sliced carrots seasoned with kosher salt.  I returned to the oven and baked til the internal temp was 150 degrees.  While the roast rested, I left the veg in the oven and I made a pan sauce.  I deglazed the pan using 1/4 C dry white wine and cooked for about 4-5 minutes until the wine reduced by half.  Then I whisked in 2 tsp flour and cooked for about 3 minutes until it was thick and brown,  to cook out the raw flour taste.  Lastly I added 1 1/2 C chicken broth and cooked over medium heat for about 8 minutes until the sauce was a little thickened but not thick.  You still want it to be on the thinner side.  By the time the pan sauce is finished, the roast can be sliced and served.  Delicious!

I forgot to rub with olive oil so i brushed it with olive oil after about 30 mins.  It was still very moist.  I also added chunky vegs: potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and a zucchuni.  These I had shaken in a bag with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and salt and pepper, just like the roast.  Then I put them in the roasting pan with the roast in the center.  When I removed the roast to rest, I just added the wine to the vegs in the pan and returned to the oven to warm.  Everyone loved it.  Simple and quick.  Will make again.

Made this tonight for dinner. It could have cooked less than the hour and a half I had it in, so suggest checking the temperature at one hour. The garlic and rosemary were amazing. Loved this.

Fantastic. Make sure you check the weight and cut of your pork for the appropriate cook time. Otherwise you may overcook. Crushing the garlic with the rosemary is an important step because it releases the flavor of the rosemary and infuses it with the garlic. I did not poke holes, but rubbed the roast with the garlic/rosemary blend and salt/pepper. I added water to the baking dish (did not baste)  throughout baking to ensure it didn't dry out. The roast looked beautifully browned (sorry no picture!), was tender, and very flavorful. The gravy I made with the drippings and wine was also very good-- I added  about 1/2 C water and a couple Tbsp of cornstarch. Tip: Do not add salt to the gravy unless you've tasted it first!  I fed three kids and three adults, and everyone loved it.

My family loved it!  I used chicken broth in place of wine, and used a meat thermometer.  My cooking time was a little longer, but well worth the wait!

This is a very good dish. It is so simple to make and is quite tasty. I did not have Rosemary handy, so I substituted the same amount of basil, and it was good.

The pork was perfect. We cut strips length wise to season the pork and it couldn't have come out any better. This is one that I plan on doing again!

My kids loved this!  I often make the mistake of not cooking pork tenderloin long enough, so I changed the cooking method slightly.  I made the paste & smothered the roast, then let sit at room temperature for 15-20 min.  I cooked at 500 for about 10 min then at 325 for about 1 hr 15 min.  I let stand while making the sauce, then sliced thinly (½" slices) and let rest in juice while finishing the rest of dinner.  My kids LOVED this and we have no leftovers!

Next time I will triple rub and add more into roast. Make sure you drain some oil or it will separate. Cut thin or thick, it makes for great flavor.

I made this for our New Year's Day meal. The only thing I did different was using fresh rosemary instead of the dried. It was excellent! My husband couldn't stop raving about it. I will definitely make again.

made a 4.5 lb tenderloin and it took 2 hours to cook and it was the best pork roast I've ever had.  Was nervous about the wine sauce, but it was amazing.  This will be our New Years Day meal from now on with sweet cabbage and home made perogies..

We seared it before putting it in the oven.  We added onion carrots celery and potato to cook with it.  Pork only needs to be cooked to 145 degrees people!  It was way overdone after 1 hour. The juices needed more flavor. We added more salt and wine, cut up the pork and added everything into the sauce. It was ok but next time I'll cook for less time

I made this for Christmas dinner instead of the usual ham. It was a big hit, and while easy was very festive looking! I used fresh rosemary instead of dried, added some dried sage, olive oil and dry vermouth to the paste, and also took the advice of another cook here and marinated the meat for a few hours in the paste. I used a roasting rack in a pan and threw in some fingerling potatoes tossed in olive oil for the last half hour of cooking, removing the aluminum foil and upping the temp to 375. I removed the potatoes to the serving platter and deglazed the roasting pan with white wine, which I mixed into a roux with a little chicken stock, and I let the meat rest on a grooved cutting board for 10 min and used the accumulated juices in the gravy.  To serve I sliced the roast onto a serving tray with the potatoes arranged around the meat, poured a little gravy over it, served the rest in a boat.  A very elegant yet easy meal!! If you don't care about making the gravy it is really hassle free, but since the meat is resting anyway (and I also steamed some green beans during that time)  you might as well. Looking forward to seeing how the leftovers hold up. NOTE: I don't have a meat thermometer; my roast was just over 3 lbs and I cooked it for a good 2 hours to be safe. Came out perfect. I plan to make this again -- we are cutting out carbs in the new year and this would be just fine without the potatoes, maybe with some brussels sprouts instead :-)

Turned out great. I marinated in garlic and fresh rosemary for a few hours. I added onions and potatoes in the bottom of the roasting pan and baked at 325 for about an hour, added a little bit of Dijon mustard on top of potatoes with salt pepper and rosemary a half cup of chicken broth in the bottom too. Deglazed with dry white wine after I removed the meat and veggies. If tasted like it was missing something, will retry to make again.

Delicious. I baked it in my dutch oven and the meat was so moist we could cut it with our forks. The rosemary wasn't too overpowering for our kids either. This will be our new favorite pork recipe.

Very good; moist (didn't cover with foil but did turn every 15 mins).  Used 3/4 tbsp of rosemary and that was more than enough.  I'll probably reduce to 1/2 tbsp next time as I am not keen on overly potent taste of rosemary.

This was awesome! I used a thermometer that is left in while cooking. Took it out after temperature reached 145, covered it with foil and let sit about 10 minutes. It was juicy and tender. Yummy!

I used Herbes de Provence in place of Rosemary which gave a well rounded flavor.  For an excellent tasty gravy, I added a couple of Tablespoons of Lingonberry jam, in addition to the wine, and cornstarch.

Made it exactly as instructed other than the note below and it was, without question, the best pork loin roast I have ever made. Moist, tender and no doubt will make good pork sandwiches with leftovers. 

The only addition I made was to smoke it with mesquite chips in my smoker prior to baking. 20 minutes per pound provided a subtle smoky flavor.

Just finished up a helping of this and it is delicious!!!! The only thing I did differently was to run all the garlic, Rosemary, salt and pepper through my mini food processor with just enough EVOO to bind... Seared my loin, spread the mixture on then off to the oven, loosely covered...  Added wine and some frozen apple juice concentrate to the bottom of the pan along with some sliced onion.. One hour later it was perfect!!! Definitely use a meat thermometer and don't overcook!!!

This was absolutely amazing.  I made a few changes. I did half rosemary and half sage and then made a paste. When I stuffed the holes in the loin, I added some half cloves of garlic- instead of just going with the minced in the paste. And then after rubbing the loin with the remaining spice mixture, I seared the loin in a pan on all 6 sides. Holy wow. So good. The temp was somewhere around 160 when I pulled it out and I was panicking but then i tried it and it was still juicy and delicious. However, next time, I will definitely watch the temp more closely.

I've made this recipe three times! On the third time I did some changes: I rubbed the pork tender loin with BBQ sauce in addition to the garlic and rosemary. I seared it in a hot pan for 2 min per side to give it a darkened finish before putting it in the oven. At the end instead of white wine I used ale beer. Amazing!

I marinated the pork loin for 3 hrs., but believe that I prefer pork tenderloin to pork loin.  I used a French chardonnay for the sauce, but found it bitter.  I was disappointed with the flavor, and won't be making this again.

This was a delicious recipe! I did use sage instead of Rosemary and followed the recipe otherwise. It was great!

I had pork loin country style ribs. I didn't measure anything, but think I got it pretty spot on. I didn't want to have another dirty dish and step, so after about 45 mins, I added the white wine over the pork in the glass dish, and put it back in the oven for another 15 mins. It tasted just great! My kids ate it even!!!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used a gas oven, Pyrex and no foil. My 3-lb roast was ready in 1 hour or so. Internal temp was 155-160. Thanks for a great recipe !

A trusty family favorite, especially when used with fresh rosemary from the garden. It's all about the KAORI (essential smells). Tender, succulent and pleasing. Luv this dish.

Really good!  Seared in a cast iron skillet and then put in a dutch oven with wine and chicken stock to roast.  400 for 30min and then turned down to 350 for another 30min.  Definitely use a meat thermometer.  Added flour to drippings and made gravy with chicken stock.  Very delicious!

I made this tonight for dinner.  It was very delicious.  I used fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden in combination with the garlic.  I did brown the roast and then stuffed the herbs in the meat slits and on the outside afterward.  Turned out very good.  Oh, I also laid sliced yellow onions under the roast while it was in the oven.  As far as the sauce...not so much.  I did not have white wine so I used chicken stock but could not get it thickened.  Pretty sure it was an error on my part.  I will make this recipe and try again!  Served with roasted garlic potatoes.

the pork roast turned out dry and tasteless - perhaps it got over-cooked, but I probably won't try this one again.

Really great! The ONLY reason it isn't a 4 star is because I didn't have any white wine, so I used dry sherry. I also browned the roast after rubbing it with the remainder to give it more flavor. I ended up cooking it in 350* for 3 hours and it was falling apart.  Delicious!

I made a 4 pound tenderloin so I had to adjust recipe for it. The tenderloin had a fantastic flavor and it was so tender and moist! We will be having this more often. The only mistake I made was not adding enough salt.

This was the best pork loin we've ever made.  As recommended in another review, sliced a sweet onion to lay under the roast and added a chopped carrot to the pan.  Took just about 1.5 hours to finish.  Didn't bother with the wine or making a sauce/gravy; it was excellent just the way it was.  For future variety, I may try adding honey to the garlic/rosemary mixture.

Made this tonight for me and the kids (12 & 8) and we loved it. The only change I had was adding a bit of cornstarch to the pan drippings to thicken it up. The pork was tender and juicy and was excellent with the wine sauce, even the kids ate it.Thumbs up!

Outstanding flavor.  I baked for 2 1/2 hours and substituted 2 tbl of fresh rosemary and 3 cloves of garlic as the weight of the 2 loins was over 2 lbs.

Recipe turned out really well, but next time I would cut back on the rosemary.  I made gravy with the pan dripping wine and a little flour, milk, salt, pepper!!  Served with wild rice and green beans/ripe tomatoes!  Especially declicious!  Will definitely make again.......

I wasn't a fan, way to much rosemary in my opinion but other than that it came out beautifully.

Loved this recipe! It tasted great and was very easy to make! I, too, put the wine in the pan before cooking - it turned out yummy!

This roast smelled delicious the whole time it was cooking.  But the taste just didn't do anything for us.  The meat was dry and tasteless.

The flavor of the pork was great, I marinated in the rosemary/garlic/oil rub overnight...added a little spicy mustard too. I poured the wine over the roast before putting in oven. The roast was a little under 3 lbs and I cooked if for about 1 3/4 hrs and that was too long. Now I know for next time to take it out of the oven earlier. Served with roasted potatoes/carrots/onions. Very good!

We don't need the added calories so instead of oven roasting, I used my rotesserie.  It was delicious!  Served with steamed vegetables and a small baked sweet potato.

Simple, yet delicious.  The only problem I had was when I headed the wine in the pan . . . the sauce wasn't very flavorful.  In fact, I thought it was downright bitter.  My family preferred the pork without the sauce, which was a surprise because we like our sauce!

This was excellent. I did not change a thing. I did put the olive oil and spices in the blender and made it into a paste and spread it on the roast. I added carrots, onion and celery about 45 mins left. The carrots were delicious. I was worried about it being undercooked so i left mine for about 2 1/2 hours and the bottom was falling apart because it was so tender. I would definatly do this again. I made gravy of the leftover pan drippings.

I grow rosemary so I used fresh, and this got 2 goods and an average from my family. I personally liked the taste, so I rated it 4 stars, it was simple to prep and make a tasty au jus.

I was expecting much more from this, especially since there were so many great reviews. I found it to be fairly dry, and not as flavorful as I thought it was going to be. But my family was happy, just not the best meal ive ever made.

Yum, yum, yum, yum.  We loved this.  I used fresh rosemary and a 3 lb boneless pork loin roast.  The house smelled unbelievable while this cooked.  It took just over an hour at 350 so way shorter than expected.  Paired beautifully with  Grandma Jeanette's Amazing German Red Cabbage on this site.

I thought this was decent as written. Hubby was late getting home so I sliced the loin, and warmed it up by browning it in the skillet with some of the juices.... now that made it wonderful! Next time I will add that step and cut out making the gravy.

Make sure you use a thermometer. The taste was good not great. On my plate I used a little of the juice with dijon mustard. That gave it a little more zing.

This was very simple and delicious. I used fresh chopped rosemary and lemon thyme and the herbs went perfect with the wine. I also did this in a slow cooker instead of the oven. It always comes out fork tender that way. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but next time I'll double the garlic and halve the rosemary--just my taste buds!  Hubby liked it as-is.  I also cooked down the wine/drippings a bit, then added a bit of cream for a very nice sauce!

Really good marinade!  We cooked this on the grill rather than in the oven, and used herbes de Provence instead of just rosemary.  Also added a little horseradish mustard (because we like spice!).  That said, this marinade made the pork incredibly tender and flavorful.

This was really good & easy to make! We allowed the garlic, rosemary paste to marinate the meat for hours before cooking.   For just the 2 of us, we only needed 3/4 pound, and it took only 1 hr 15 mins. We ended up using the drippings leftover to make gravy using chicken bouillon powder with some boiling water already used to make mashed potatoes along with cornstarch.

I tried this on a bone in pork roast.  The meat itself was very fatty and tough, but what we could eat was good.  I like the flavor combos in this.  I made a gravy out of the drippings; I guess that wasn't the best idea.  I don't eat gravy and I made it for the bf; forgot he doesn't like wine and apparently there was too much of a wine taste.  But, for those of you out there who like wine gravy, probably not a bad idea!  ;o)  I added fennel seed to the garlic mix just for fun.  My roast was about 4 1/2 lbs and I baked at a lower temp--325--for 3 1/2 hours.  thanks for the recipe.

I put my herbs and garlic in the food processor, added some oil and then slathered it all over the pork loin.  I also poked a few holes with the tip of a knife before placing in fridge for a few hours.  I also used a meat thermometer rather than put it in the oven for whatever time to cook.  The meat was extremely tender!!  I'm not crazy about Rosemary and perhaps I put too much in, but it was well seasoned.  We served it with a side dish of buttered couscous and a salad.

This recipe was very delicious, and I made very minimal changes.  The only things I did differently was let the garlic/rosemary paste sit on the meat for about an hour before cooking it, and putting the wine right in the pan while cooking. Great, thank you for a great dinner option!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was the cooking time on the roast- your best bet is to use a meat thermometer.
Other than that, this was awesome & easy- everyone loved it and had seconds

This was such an awesome pork roast.  Easy and very flavorful.  My husband loved it.  I purchased a bottle of Pomegrante Chipole Sauce and it went well with pork.

Recipe totally rocked!  I had to make minor changes due to lack of wine.  It sucked I was looking forward to white wine, but all I had was red, so I used chicken broth instead and added a whole onion during the deglazing process.  Total hit all the men loved it and I served it was roasted red potates and asparagus.

My favorite!!!  I double the wine so I'll have more gravy and  throw in mushrooms in the pan only because I love mushrooms in gravy.  Then when the roast in done I mix a little flour/water mixture to make the gravy a little thicker.

I didn't use wine...which is probably why it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I mixed up minced garlic, itlalian seasoning, basil and olive oil and let the tenderloins marinate.  Then cut the little slits and tried to add seasoning, a little harder than it sounds!  Then cooked for about an hour.  They were really good and juicy.

My very first pork loin.  Now that I know how easy it is, I will making these more often!  I used 2 3 pound roasts, and it took 2 hours to roast in my roaster.  I used fresh Rosemary.  I may have overseasoned it.  I think I would prefer more of a rub or spicy flavor other than the rosemary, garlic flavor.

This was amazing.  I made 2 different pork roasts for a christmas party.  This one was a hit!  The entire thing was gone at the end of the night.  It smelled great while cooking and tasted even better.

Mine got a little dry even though I used a meat thermometer.  The flavor was good-though i didn't crush the rosemary and I think that would have made it better.

I guess this just wasn't to our taste. It was a bit dry even though I used a meat thermometer, and the flavor was only ok.

I thought this tasted okay, but not spectacular. But that's probably because I don't like garlic or rosemary; I have no idea why I thought I might like it! I'm sure that those who like the spices would appreciate it more.

By following suggested changes, I decrease the rosemary, increased the garlic, and adde wine to the pot.  It was pretty tasty, though still pretty dry.  I think I just cooked it too long...I would definitely try this recipe again!

I totally screwed this up, confusing it with another recipe, so I couldn't make the pan sauce (I had put 1/2 cup of cider vinegar in the roasting pan).  Anyway, I added more garlic/kosher salt to the paste, poked a ton of holes in the roast, and packed them in.  It was absolutely the best pork roast I made.  I may not have run into the dryness issue others did because of the vinegar.  I will skip it next time to try to make the sauce.  Great stuff--thanks.

This was absolutely awesome, and quite tender.  I agree - don't go by the clock to test the doneness of pork - use a meat thermometer.  Typically, people overcook pork, and it ends up dry or stringy.  This one cooked to perfection at the correct temperature is ohhhh sooo tasty.  We loved it!

This was a great marinade.  I couldn't find fresh rosemary, so I used dried.  I also added 1 T Italian Seasonings.  I left off the white wine.  Since I used convection roast, I didn't get much drippings for gravy.  I added chicken broth and the white wine for flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Very good and moist taste! I thought it smelled way too garlicy when it first started cooking, but after it baked a bit, the garlic was great. It also only took about an hour and a half to cook, so don't forget to make good use of your meat thermometer!

I'm only giving this a 3 because I changed it up quite a bit by following other reviewers advice. We don't like rosemary, so I used thyme. I didn't have white wine on hand so I used white wine vinegar, chix broth, and water. I also sliced up some sweet onions, and mushrooms, and threw them in. The roast was moist, and delicious!

This turned out very juicy and flavorful.  I found it to be a bit heavy on the rosemary, but all, in all, very good.  It smelled fantastic cooking in the oven as well.

Excellent!  Used this recipe a second time but used chops in the crock pot and they turned out great (and cut down on cooking time).  Will use again in the future.

I don't really like Rosemary that much, but it really worked with this recipe.  I threw the garlic, salt, pepper, rosemary and a little bit of oil in a food processor to turn into a paste.. which really broke down the rosemary.  The juice with the wine was fantastic.  My boyfriend didn't care for the juice (he doesn't like wine based things) but I adored it.  It was a little dry, but I expected that since it's pork.

Very good.

This roast was excellent!  I followed the directions exactly and it was so flavorful.  As an added bonus our house smelled wonderful, too!  It did not take as long to cook as it said, though.  Next time I will check the roast at an hour and a half.  Enjoy!

This was quite tender and flavorful.  The pork loin used was 2 pieces 1lb each, so it did cook in less time, rely on your thermometer. Barely any leftovers! This is a keeper,

I made this using the convection setting on my oven so that may be the problem but I found the meat to be very dry. I even used my pampered chef stone with a lid and it didn't help. Next time I would definitely add more liquid to the pan and not cook as long.

this recipe is fantastic - the roast was so juicy and tender, and the wine added to the liquids is awesome.  I would suggest cooking less and using a meat thermometer to ensure pork is cooked to right temp.

i really don't like pork at all, but this was pretty good.  my boyfriend misread my handwriting though, and processed the oil w/ the garlic and herbs, but we just poured it over it, and it was pretty good!

This was great, I made it in the crock pot and it just fell apart, very moist and flavorful!

This was great. I added a little more garlic and rosemary. Plus extra salt and pepper. I wanted to make sure that it was seasoned just right. I also added a drop or 2 more of white wine. Everyone liked it. Actually loved it.
