This recipe was one I have used over and over many times. In place of using the white chips, I have subtituted butterscotch chips instead. Of all the cookies I have made this one is requested the most often. May I also present a hint I have used while cooking these-oven temp. set to 350 degrees and cook cookies for 10 minutes. They are delicious...

I thought this recipe was just wonderful!  I did add a few "creative" touches that my husband really enjoyed.  I cut the white chocoloate chips in half (only 1 cup) and added 1 cup of Craisins (great color for the holidays).  I also cut the nuts in half (1/2 cup of nuts) and added 1/2 cup of coconut.  I drizzled the cookies with an orange glaze (just orange juice and confectioners sugar).  They disappeared in 2 days!

WOW - what a cookie!
This cookie is now in high demand, it's so super-delicious!
I recommend using chopped white chocolate bars for a chunkier, more professional look.

OH MY GOODNESS! Honestly the best cookie I've ever had, and I've tried A LOT.  I split the dough in half and did dried cranberry/white chocolate and the other half butterscotch/chocolate chip.  Both were awesome, but the flavor of the butterscotch/chocolate was like an explosion of the best flavor I've ever tasted:)

OUTSTANDING!!! Use real butter for proper texture and incredible taste. I toasted both the pecans and the oats, which made the flavor pop. Line a cookie sheet with foil, shiny side DOWN. Put the pecans in a single layer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Turn the pecans over with pancake turner and bake for another 5 minutes, or until they become fragrant. Do the same for the oats, spreading them out as thinly as possible on the cookie sheet. I then chopped the pecans and oats by pulsing them together in the food processor. Toasting results in a fabulous, toffee-like flavor. Makes these extraordinary. You can toast a pound of pecans on a single 11"X17" cookie sheet, then freeze after cooling so they're ready whenever you want to bake these cookies. Ditto for the oats. Bag them in 1-1/2 cup portions in a zip-lock sandwich baggie for convenience. No need to even thaw them before incorporating them in the dough. Everyone loves these. They will make your reputation as a baker. Thank you!

These cookies are delicious and went very, very fast.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and substituted 1/2 the butter for applesauce to make them a little healthier and they were still amazing.

I made this recipe tonight making some with cinnamon chips, some with M&M's, and some with white chocolate chips. I thought that this recipe sounded familiar, and the words "disappearing cookies" tipped me off. This is almost identical to the Quaker Oats Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe. The main difference is this one has more white sugar, has baking powder, and the flour & oat amounts are reversed. If you don't grease the pan, the cookies won't spread. I think next time I will use the Quaker oat recipe instead. I like cookies with more oats, and one reviewer did comment that these were too sweet, and maybe the cinnamon will add to the flavor.

While there is no question this is a delicious tasting cookie I can't help feel something is incorrect in the directions/ingredients. The dough, without pecans and only 3/4 C. ea of the sugars, was so dry and would not stick together I had to check to be sure I hadn't missed a wet ingredient somewhere. It was so tough I could not use tablespoons but had to roll the dough in my hands to create a round-ish shape. By the end of the second batch I ended up with 2/3 cup oats and chips leftover in the bowl with no dough to hold it together. I could make them again for the taste but I don't feel like trying to figure out what to adjust so I'll just forget this recipe. Thanks anyway.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I added approximately 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, since I believe all oatmeal cookies should be spiced....  They turned out unbelievably good!!!

A definite winner!  To a cookie novice like me this recipe is simple yet failproof enough to yield a batch of impressive cookies that rival store-bought ones.  I have even made a couple w/o the white morsels and they're still terrific.  Not to mention, the cookie dough is great too (smells just like Haagan-Daaz butter pecan ice cream...yumm)  However, I did let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 45 minutes before I shape them out on the cookie sheet.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I'm with everyone else...these are so good!  I will make them a standard in my kitchen, too.  I baked mine at 350 for 12 minutes after chilling the dough.  They held their shape so nicely and have a wonderful chewy texture and nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my!!  Sooooo good!!  I used white choco chips from Trader Joe's, but I only had one cup, so for the rest I chopped up part of a large chunk of Ghiradeli's white chocolate.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  So, so good!  Loved the combo of oats, nuts, and white chocolate.  I didn't find the dough too crumbly or dry at all.  It does get quite stiff but if I can mix it, anyone can!  I only added nuts to half because I'm giving some away.  I'm sure I will make these cookies many more times!

This was the first time I made this recipe and these cookies are awesome! The only things I did differently was to use 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and to chill my dough for about an hour before baking. I did not find them too sweet. The texture is just right, crunchy and chewy. When I removed my test cookie from the oven, I found that it did not spread just as other folks have said. After that, I slightly flattened the dough as I scooped it onto the tray. They came out just right! GREAT RECIPE!! I will be using this one often!

These are the absolute best cookies I've ever made, hands down.  The texture is perfect, especially since I used instant oats and they puffed up to give a nice body to the cookie.  

The problem others have had with texture may be related to their oven temp.  A too-hot oven can cause over-carmelization in a high sugar/butter recipe and result in hard cookies.

Yum! Good recipe! A few changes I made were that I used half butter and half shortening, quick oats instead of rolled, walnuts in place of pecans, and added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. Soft and delicious!

Great cookies!!!!  Yummy.  Do not over cook.  Make sure you follow directions and take out when lightly browned. I followed directions exactly and these were fantastic.

These are delicious!  I did less than a cup of sugar for both brown and white and probably could have even done less - 3/4 cup each would be more than enough.  I also did 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 2 of white and would never have known.  Next time I'll do 2 whole wheat and 1 white.

These cookies rocked my world and everyone else's who had the fortune to taste them.  These are super sweet and great for an outdoor summer party or barbecue because the chocolate doesn't melt.  I used half white chips and half butterscotch, and omitted the nuts.  I also chilled the dough well before making 1.5 ounce dough balls and baking them.  This will be one of my go-to cookie recipes!

These cookies turned out great after I took the advise of some of the other reviewers. I cut the white chocoloate chips to only 1/2 cup, added a 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips, added 1/2 cup of  golden raisins, 1/2 cup of walnuts and 1/2 cup of coconut.

BEWARE: There seemed to be WAY too much flour, the dough was incredibly dry and didn't form the way cookie dough usually does. I didn't even try to fit in the full amount of oats and chocolate chips, and what i DID try to fit in wouldn't mix in all the way. I went against my better judgement and assumed the problem would somehow fix in the oven-the great reviews were a bit misleading. Nope. The cookies didn't spread in the oven, either.  I think the flavor is good, but something is missing in the make up of this recipe!

These cookies turned out perfectly.  My daughters and I love white chocolate and these were a nice change from the usual oatmeal raisin cookies that I typically make.  These were chewy in the middle, a little crisp on the edges and had a nice buttery flavor.  I would have preferred to have added the pecans, but since my kids preferred otherwise, I omitted them this time.  Great recipe that I am sure will be repeated!

Incredible flavor and texture - they are chewy and rich, which is what I look for in a cookie.  Everyone seemed to love them; even my friends who do not eat many sweets.

I added craisins and I think it did a lot for the flavor.  Will make again.

YUM YUM.  AWESOME TEXTURE.  HELD SHAPE WONDERFULLY.   I USE SEMI SWEET CHIPS THOUGH.  TRY SOME CINNAMON FOR FLAVOR.  YOU COULD SUBSITUE RAISINS FOR THE CHIPS.  I OMMITTED THE NUTS AND PUT THE DOUGH IN THE FRIDGE BEFORE COOKING IT. I ALSO ADDED THE OLD FASHIONED OATS, WHICH ARE FLUFFIER THAN THE QUICK OATS.   awesome cookie!!!  try it.  I keep my dough in the fridge and make a pan whenever the mood hits me or my 4 kids!

These are the best oatmeal cookies iv had. They were soft and chewy. I didn't use the full amount of white chocolate, removed about 1/3 cup. I will make these again.

This recipe did NOT disappoint!  Loved the consistnecy of the cookies.  I didn't have pecans so I substituted some orange craisins and cut down on the sugars by 1/3 cup each (i.e.using 2/3c ea).  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the "T" and they came out perfect.  Thank you!

These should be renamed to 'Vanishing White Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies' :-)  They were a hit at work amongst the 3 varieties I brought along.  This makes a pretty good size batch.  I mixed a day ahead and refrigerated.  The day of, I used a 1" cookie scoop.  Good stuff!

I thought this recipe would make great bars. I added 1 cup of dried cranberries and smooshed the dough into a greased 11x17 jelly roll pan. I baked them for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees, until they were golden brown. They were really wonderful! The recipe makes really chewy, 1 inch thick bars, quick and easy!

These are great (and this is coming from a girl who doesn like white chocolate or nuts in baked goods)! I used an entire bag of white choco chips and then chopped another 1/2 bag that had melted. I also used quick oats instead of regular. I Made these extra big, and they didnt spread at all, so I flattened them out a bit 1/2 way through cooking. They reminded me of something you would get in Starbucks.

Had some white chocolate chips and wanted to do something with them before I ate the whole bag alone, haha. A nice twist on the standard cookie. Followed recipe, but omited the nuts. I must've made my cookies a little larger than the recipe suggested, because I only got about 55 cookies. Cooked them about 13 minutes, but they still didn't look golden when I took them out. However, once cooled, they were very chewy and I'm glad I removed the cookies when I did!

These were good cookies, but I think they were a bit crumbly.  I think the sugar ratio should be changed to 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. Otherwise they were very good.

I have never before made cookies that turned out this good. Excellent! I didn't have brown sugar and I only had enough ingredients for half the recipe. I used white sugar with a few tablespoons of molasses. I cooked only 6 minutes at 325 because I think my over is extra hot. Seriously the best cookies I have ever made.

These cookies are to die for!  My family absolutely loves them.  The only thing we do differently is to use 1c. of milk chocolate chips and 1c. of white chocolate chips and omit the nuts.

These were great cookies !  Not as much of an Oatmeal taste, more like a regular Chocolate Chip Cookie and I did use Chocolate instead of White Chocolate.  Definitely a recipe I would use again.

This is a really good cookie. Like another reviewer mentioned it needs some spice ( I choose nutmeg and cinnamon) and it is too sweet, maybe cut the sugar or sub some dark brown sugar to tone it down and offer some depth.  I made these large (18 in all) because I like big fluffy cookies but I think these are the kind of cookies that are better small and flat as the crisp part is good but the bulk in the larger size makes it taste a bit dry( I didn't take the changes into consideration when rating the cookie because it's not fair to give anything other than five stars if you make changes).

This recipe is wonderful as is, no changes. BUT if you want a 5-star cookie, then you need to spice these bad boys. I used ground coriander and ginger, but cinnamon or allspice will work too. Like some other users, I cut the butter to 1/2 c and added 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce. I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 c. I cooked for just 8 - 9 minutes because I like my cookies soft. The flavor is wonderful. Spice them, and you have a 5-star cookie!

Super yummy. I had to sub chocolate chips for the white, but I don't think it made a difference at all.  They are delicious. I cooked mine for 11 minutes at 350.

Wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar, to make them a little more crispy.  WOW! We loved them.  I used an ice cream scoop to make mine and they came out really large, like the ones you buy in the coffee shops.  I cooked them a little longer about 18 mins and only put 6 per cookie sheet so they had plenty of room to spread out. I will absolutley be making these again. I think they would be great for gifts cause they are a definite treat.  Thank you Julie!!

What a delightful blend of pecans and white chocolate morsels.I used flavored butter,and cut the vanilla to only 1/2 tsp to further enhance the taste of the butter.After cooling,they were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.Mmm good.

These are SO yummy - they have become a new favorite in our house!!  I like them with white chips but have experimented with butterscotch and chocolate chips also...or combos of white, butterscotch or chocolate - they are all good.
I do cut both sugars to 3/4 cups. I adjusted the flour and oatmeal proportions to 2.5 cups flour and 2 cups oatmeal. I find 1 1/4 cups of chips is plenty.  I also like adding 1/2 tea. almond flavoring.
I only bake these for 10 minutes... ummm ummm amazing!

The dough was extremely hard to work with I finally gave up and used my hands to try and mix it the best I could. I personally think there was too much flour in the recipe. It turned out to be a pretty good cookie but to much work involved with the dough. Also could not drop the dough into cookies it was to dry rolled into balls.

Very good cookies. You can create variable texture depending on how long they’re cooked. Soft & chewy in the center when cooked 11 minutes. Another batch placed in warm oven (approx. 175° F) for about 5 minutes until spreading out into a thinner cookie, and then cooked about 11 minutes at 350° F to give a crispier version. Both have the same great taste. Used steel cut oats which are in our pantry. Since they’re more dense than rolled oats, cut the amount to 1 cup. Thank you julie.

I would love to give this recipe a 5 star rating, but the first batch I made was WAY too salty! Almost inedible salty.
However, in an effort to save the rest of the dough I added 2TBS of ground Cinnamon, 1tsp of allspice, an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg. After the additions they are my very favorite cookies ever and most of them are gone less than 24 hours after baking! Great recipe, just needs some tweeking. My oven is a piece so the baking time was a little off for me, I baked for 13-14 min, and the cookies are still soft and chewy the next day. YUM!

While these were good, I was expecting more of an oatmeal cookie taste to them.  Next time I would probably cut back significantly on the white chocolate chips.  I used a large bowl in lieu of the medium bowl called for, as there's no way this would work in a medium bowl.  I yielded 4 dozen cookies in lieu of 3.  Mine were done at 12 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are very good, very sweet but we loved them, although I would cut back on the sugar a little next time. They are a heavy cookie, they don't spread out at all when they cook but that didn't matter very much to us.

Just made these today to fill a sweet-tooth craving!  Very good basic recipe that I tweaked a little.  I was a little short on the rolled oats so a supplemented the difference in flour.  I also opted to add some dark chocolate mini-chips (about a half cup) just for contrast.  Turned out perfect!  Will probably make these again.  =)

wonderful ! I used 1 C. each of white chocolate chips , & cinnamon chips , & added chopped walnuts since I was out of pecans . One tip ...do NOT use ungreased parchment paper with these ! I did & they simply didn't spread @ all . That's my fault , the recipe clearly says "lightly grease cookie sheets" . Had I read the reviews more closely I'd have known better .

These were/are wonderful!  I am not much of a cook, but decent (or daring) enough to spin a recipe the first time.  I know I like the sweet and salty tasted so I added another couple pinches of salt.  Also, I have never cooked with flax seed - but hear people adding that to tons of recipes, so I cut the oats by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup flax seed.  Before reading other reviews, I knew I wanted to add dried cranberries, I am glad to see that I am not the only pleased with the result (added 1/2 cup).  I would maybe add 3/4 cup instead the next time.  Also, we have unsalted nut mix on hand in the house, so I took a handful and crushed them with the meat tenderizer - that was about a 3/4 cup.  For the chocolate, I did half white chips and half 60% dark chips.  I absolutely love these cookies! I've eaten 4 before I've been able to store them for my fiance.  I WILL make these again.  The are the prettiest and tastiest cookies I have ever made.  They were not flat at all!  I am very very pleased. Thanks for the help!

Made these to take to my daughter's swim meet, and everyone enjoyed them.  I added some dried cranberries, as suggested by another reviewer.  My kids didn't want me to make these, but they sure gobbled them up!  They were mad that I took all of them to the meet!  Thanks for the recipe!

amazing. I used 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2cup applesauce. I used regular chocolate chips, as the kids like it better. We like it with less sugar, 1.5 cup all together

Great recipe hands down. I substituted 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour & the other half I used all purpose flour.  I also added Craisins because I had no nuts available.  I did not have plain rolled oats, so I used Maple Syrup flavored instant oatmeal.  The cookies taste so good.  Now, the cookie dough is not like your traditional cookie dough, meaning it is not as creamy.  So, you need to use a little arm muscle to mix the rest of the ingredients into the mixture. Overall, the cookies taste great and they are cake like.  I will be making these again in the near future.

A very good recipe, and it turned out beautifully, which I thank you for since I am usually a terrible baker. The dough was extremely messy, which gave me a bit of trouble, but if it turns out like this every time, I say it's worth it!

These are one of my family's favorite cookies!  Nobody in my family likes nuts in baked goods so I omit those.  I usually split the dough in half and do one half with 1 cup white chocolate chips and about 1/2-3/4 cup craisins.  The other half I do 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips and 3/4 cup peanut butter chips.  They are awesome - and totally addicting!

Mmmmm!  I made these because I only had white chocolate chips and pecans on hand to make cookies.  I used steel cut oats instead of rolled oats, because that was also only what I had available.  They turned out SOOOOOO good!  The steel cut oats actually worked great, and gave them a crispy texture.  It is true that they turn out great if you take them out when they are slightly brown on top.  I baked the first batch like that and then thought they weren't done because they were still gooey, but after they sat they were perfectly soft and chewy.  If you cook them longer, they are still great--just crispier depending on your taste.

When I'm in the mood for oatmeal cookies, I'm in the mood for these.  I have made them so many times, and they always come out perfect -- thick and chewy, but not dry or crumbly at all.   I tend to cut the amount of chips that I put in the cookies by about half or thereabouts because I prefer a subtler flavor.

This is a great cookie recipe and I plan on using it many times.  The only change I made was I did not grease the cookie sheets and used a silpat instead.  They were yummy, with a great salty/sweet combo.

As I was combining all the ingredients and the cookie dough got harder and harder to mix AND began to get crumbly I thought "these aren't gonna be good at all!" I was wrong!! The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was that I put only the yolk of the second egg in - not the whole egg. It made the cookies really chewy. I rolled the dough into walnut size balls. Flattened some just a little to see if that worked better than the ones I didn't flatten. They all came out good. This isn't one of those really moist cookies, so get out your glass of milk. Definitely good! Thanks for the recipe!!

These cookies are sooooo yummy! I rarely make cookies and my husband said they were the best cookies he has ever eaten!  The only change I made was that instead of using two cups of white choc chips, I uses 1 cup and one cup of cranraisins.  I am gonna give these away as christmas presents and I am so happy they turned out delicous!!

Delicious, but a little too sweet for me. Next time I will half the white sugar. It was also difficult to form dough. Seemed too dry, but cookie was still good. Thanks!

Made these cookies following the recipe exactly and they were perfect!!  The measurements were so easy and fast.  I can't wait to try this recipe with chocolate chips.  Instead of greasing the pan I lined it with parchment paper.  I have found that cookies turn out so much better baked on parchment paper.  Baked at 350 degrees for 11 minutes.  I froze half of the baked cookies and they are delicious eaten right from the freezer.

DELICIOUS! I didn't use the nuts. And I just used a bit of margarine and substituted the main portion of butter with vanilla yogurt! I also used only brown sugar instead of brown and white sugar. Yummy!!! I used a mix of white and brown chocolate chips. Moist and fluffy cookies that have a great taste!

My 1st bite.. I was in heaven! These cookies are perfect! I did omit the pecans since I'm not a fan of nuts. I also reduced the white chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups and it was sweet enough.

I have to agree with a former reviewer who said that this was "THAT" cookie that her husband raved about. This cookie recipe is fantastic! I've been baking cookies for over 35 years and I think I've finally found "THE ONE"! The texture of the cookies was perfect: very slightly crisp on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. I did make a couple of changes though, as I was actually looking for a CHOCOLATE oatmeal cookie recipe, when I stumbled across this one. I substituted milk chocolate chips for the white, walnuts and a few chopped macadamias for the pecans (just my personal preference) and I used my food processor to give the oats a finer texture. (Just pulse for about a minute or a bit less). Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T". The dough is thick; however, my kitchen aid stand mixer handled it quite well. I used a cookie scoop and the results were perfect cookies... in appearance, as well as taste and texture. Definitely a keeper!
Thanks Julie, for sharing your wonderful cookie recipe with us!

Excellent recipe! These turned out a bit cakelike and break apart in your mouth, which was surprisingly good since I usually prefer chewy. Excellent flavor (I used dark brown sugar). I used 2 c dried tart cherries and 1 c chocolate chips, and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to complement the cherries. I suggest rolling the dough into balls for more uniform shape, as the dough does not 'melt' into itself as it bakes and the first batch ended up extremely gloppy looking.

I had to loose the nuts since I have other plans for my almonds. I think I will cut the salt a bit next time too. But these make many many cookies and be sure to use a BIG bowl, and unless you absolutely don't care about your waistline, or have a huge crowd to please, plastic wrap and put half the dough in the freezer for some other time =) 
Now you can get any texture of cookie you want depending on how you cook them.  If you like cakey, make balls and cook them longer. If you like chewy cook them shorter and cool them in the pan. If you like them doughy go a head and cook them about 10 mins until they just start to change colour and cool them on wire racks. And if you like something in between, experiment with a few cookies until you figure out what you like, then bake them all the same way!

These were great even after I made major changes/substitutions. I used splenda in place of the white sugar, substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the butter, walnuts for the pecans and only used 1 cup mini chocolate chips instead of the 2 cups white chocolate chips. Some of the changes I made because that's what I had, and some because I wanted a "lighter" cookie. I also refrigerated the dough overnight before baking. Next time I'll try using 1/2 whole wheat flour. (Just fyi, for anyone who hasn't done the apple sauce substitution for fat in a recipe: I always take a coffee filter and drain the excess liquid off the apple sauce before using in my baking.) The rest of the family said, "these are really good!".

I really didn't think these cookies were very good at all. I bake very often and have tried many recipes off of this website. I followed this recipe EXACTLY and the cookies were solid, and the actual cookie had a pretty bland flavor. The majority of the flavor came from the chips. I love cookies and sweets, but I could barely even choke one of these down. I will not make this recipe again!

Other than using wheat flour and omitting the pecans because I didn't have them on hand, I followed this recipe exactly. The texture and appearance of the cookies were great but the flavor was somewhat lacking. Everyone ate them but no one raved about them. They were good but not great.

My search for the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe is now over, thanks to Julie Moore.  The only adjustment I made was to use semi-sweet chocolate chips and I only used about 2 cups of them.  I gave some as a gift to my cousin, who called me the next day asking me to “come get these cookies” because she couldn’t stop eating them.  We both agreed that they were the best oatmeal cookies we’ve ever had.  This recipe makes a lot of cookies and the cookies freeze beautifully.  If your batter gets too soft don't continue cooking until you refrigerate the dough.  My last batch spread too much and wouldn't come off the pan.  Thanks for such a grand recipe Julie!

I had alot of mixed reviews over this cookie. Everyone agreed that they liked the texture and it was yummy but some complained that there was no distinctive flavour and it didn't make them want to go for seconds.Think I'll put more chocolate and oatmeal and omit the peacans or vice versa to give it more pronounced taste. Still, its a good recipe nonetheless and will definitely experiment more with it! :)

Very good cookies. I baked them for Christmas and my husband, people at work and my family all thought they were great. The white chocolate chips add a subtle sweetness, but without being overwhelming.

These cookies were very good. A nice change from the standard chocolate chip or oatmeal cookie. The cookies had some difficulty holding together due to the chuckiness of them. Next time I will add less white chocolate chips.

Great recipe!  I used oil instead of butter because I ran out yesterday and I used butterscotch chips rather than the white chips.  MMM mmm good!  I just can't stop eating them.  A little on the sweet side though.  Almost too sweet- so it might be good to scale down the sugar a bit.  Thanks so much !!!

I "doctored" the recipe a bit, exchanging semi-sweet chocolate chips for the white chocolate, and exchanging dried cranberries ("craisins") for the pecans. I thought they came out quite well! Maybe its my oven, but I left them in for closer to 15 minutes rather than the 10-12.

These cookies are incredible!  They are sweet and delicious. They come out looking great too. They don't flatten out a lot, which surprised me being that they are made with all butter and no shortening.  This is my new favorite chip cookie.  I am excited to try them with dried cranberries and also try them with regular chocolate chips!

The only thing I did differently was use quick oats instead of rolled oats. I did also cut the recipe in half to make 18 cookies and still ended up with 24 very large cookies. I baked them for 12 minutes. They turned out great!

These cookies are amazing. I've made them twice now and am astonished at how fabulous this recipe is. I followed the directions exactly, and they bake out into perfectly shaped, chewy, moist cookies every time. My husband described them as "rich, but not overpowering, and the perfect density"

good, but the texture doesn't taste like a traditional oatmeal cookie. Next time, I'll add more oatmeal to help fix the ratio.

These are amazing!! Didn't change a thing about the recipe, and they turned out perfect. Made a bunch too- I baked 30 cookies, and had enough leftover to freeze for at least another dozen! Have already eaten two and they're just out of the oven, these are going to be dangerous!!!

INcredible. I used all ingredients except the nuts. And I did put in an extra tsp of vanilla. It's a very sweet cookie so grab some milke or coffee, but very delicious. My husband says it's a Keeper!

Good cookies.  I used parchment paper and they did not spread out.  Still tasted good, but stayed in a ball.  I also cut the sugars back to about 3/4 c each and it was still plenty sweet.

I make these yummy cookies all of the time.  My littlest daughter likes them plain with no chips or nuts and they are just as tasty baked that way.  The recipe makes a bunch of cookies so I freeze some and have fresh cookies for kid's lunch boxes for a couple of weeks.

I thought this recipe was amazing. I made them per the recipe the first time and they were a hit. However, the second time I made them I made a few adjustments. I put 1/2 cup more oatmeal in (I like more oatmeal flavor) and minused 1/2 cup of the chips. I thought the white chocolate was a little too much so I exchanged it for the Reeses chips and they were delicious. This recipe will stay in my recipe box for a while :)

I liked the taste of the combination of nuts and white chocolate chips.  With that said, these cookies were just average for me.  And although I took them out of the oven right at 10 minutes, the bottoms were burned, so I think there needs to be some tweaking of the time/temperature.

These cookies are wonderful!  My family told me they won't last long and from the number of trips they've made into the kitchen since I started baking them, I'm sure they're right.  I would definitely bake these again.  Thank you for the great recipe.

All I really need to say is YUMMY!  I was looking for a different recipe to use with my white chocolate chips & thought I'd try them.  My kids aren't big oatmeal cookie fans (even with chocolate chips in them) but these are a definite keeper.  The white chocolate blends well with the oatmeal taste to give it a great flavor and texture.

Delicious!!! I cut out the nuts, and substituted dried cranberries for one of the cups of white chocolate chips.  I also reduced the white sugar to 2/3 cup, and they were still plenty sweet.   Everybody loved them!!!

I made these following the recipe exactly (other than cutting it in half) but they still turned out super crunchy - as bad as if I had completely left out the baking soda/powder.  Very disappointed.

These cookies were great!  I couldn't keep my husband out of them and the kids liked them too.  I had to play with the recipe a lot since I wanted to substitute oil for the butter but in the end it turned out great! (I substituted about 1/2 cup butter and added a bit of water to get the right consistency).  I will make these again!

These are an absolute favorite in our house and many have asked for the recipe. I occasionally do half a-p flour and half whole wheat flour. It does change the taste a bit, but my girls barely notice. I also add flax seed meal, too.

YUM!!  I just finished making these and they're very good, but then I'm a fan of oatmeal cookies and a bigger fan of white chocolate chips!  I made half the recipe, exactly as written, and got 31 nice plump cookies using my cookie scoop.  I'm not an accomplished baker and have experienced the "flat cookie syndrome" on many occasions.  I read a while back to make sure your butter is not too soft.  Take the back of a spoon and you should just be able to make an indentation with it.  I did that with these cookies today and they turned out great, certainly not flat.  Hope this helps some of you.

Oh my, well, what's not to love about white chocolate chips and 2 cups of sugar??  Anyway, I did make a few healthier changes by using Diet Parkay Margarine (1/2 fat), Egg Beaters for the eggs.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup Splenda but all real brown sugar.  Instead of the pecans I used dried cranberries.  Excellent, very sweet cookies that satisfy that hunger!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

oh my goodness, yum!  very rich and sweet.  i made mine smaller than recommended and found the best baked ones were rolled into a ball, then slightly smooshed, and cooked for 7 mins.  i cut the recipe in half and ended up with plenty to freeze.  amazing when fresh from the oven and for only 7 mins cook time it's a great quick dessert!

Just made these cookies and they came out really good. Cooking time was perfect as the texture was crisp on the outside but had a chewy centre. Would've gave 5 stars but the flavour could have been improved by more oats I think as you couldn't really taste them. Also I toast the oats before I add them to the cookie dough which adds depth to the flavour and texture!

Perfect mix of sweetness and texture.  Everyone loved them.  Cooked them just until set, about 11 mins.  The white chocolate was a nice change from the everyday chocolate chips.  Have already had requests to make more.

These were really great cookies!  I use Promise spread instead of butter in my cookies, and omitted pecans, and they turned out really well.

Amazing cookies! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  At the end of the batch I added dried cranberries as well.  Either way they taste awesome!  Used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet and it's a much better option.  Will definitely make again :)

I also have to agree that I was initially disappointed with how the dough started to shape up. It was very hard and dry....I still think something is not right with this recipe (may be too much Flour);  But I have to agree they taste good but dry.

Look NO further! This receipe is FAB-U-LOUS! I also decreased the sugar - 3/4 cup for each and lowered the flour to 2.5 cups & used salted butter b/c it was all I had, but kept the original 1 tsp salt and they turned out perfect. 10 min exact was the perfect bake time. They're lightly browned and perfectly moist & chewy inside. They are absolutely amazing!!! :)

this makes a big batch of dough and I have found this to be easy to freeze.  I form the dough into balls and freeze for 45 minutes on a cookie sheet.  I then transfer the dough balls to a freezer storgae bag.  Good for up to 3 months but they won't last that long.  Bake at 350 until browned (about 10-12 minutes)

Excellent little cookie. I cut the recipe in half, ground the oatmeal down in my blender with my ice-crushing feature and added 1/2 c. dried Craisins. (You don't HAVE to grind your oatmeal down, it's just a texture we like the best.) Ten minutes bake time was exact. Very, very good. NOTE: Half a batch made 26 medium sized cookies. These don't flatten much, or they didn't for me. I think that's because I added the Craisins. You might want to let these cookies sit for a minute or two before you take them off the sheet. EDITED: Half a batch of these little jewels were gone in 24 hours. Sweet cookie but with the dried cranberries, it cut the sweet down.

Not that this needs another great review but these cookies really are amazing. I get requests for the recipe every time I make them! You can add any kind of nut/chip to the cookie and it is still delicious. Great recipe.

I had made many different types of cookies and these are among my favorite! I followed the recipe exactly w/o pecans and they turned out perfect. Just enough oatmeal to give it a really nice chewy texture when u bite into it, my husband guessed it was coconut! Not too sweet at all. I usually don't eat what I bake but these looked way too good and they were. Will definitely make again. Registered on this site just so I could review. Highly recommended!

Very good.  Very sweet, too, probably bc of the white chocolate chips, which tend to be sweeter.  I used 1/2 chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips and left out the nuts.  These don't spread much, so if you want them flat, flatten before baking.  All in all, an easy recipe and the baking times are perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fantastic recipe.  I've made serveral variations of this and they come out perfect every time.  Pay attention to cook time as stated.  They look slightly undercooked if you pull them out when told, but they are best this way and cool to perfectly soft and chewy texture.

WOW!  These are super delicious.  I made as directed and they turned out great. In my oven, it only took 9 minutes to get the cookies done. Do not overbake these or you will have a dry cookie.

I baked these cookies today and they came out fantastic! Very chewy, moist and buttery, with that good ol' fashion oatmeal cookie taste in the background.  I added half the morsels that the recipe called for so I can taste more of the oatmeal, and so it would be less sugary and "sweet" since I baked these with my 2 young boys in mind.  Everything else, I followed to the "T"...I took them out about a 1.5 min. early so they can remain soft which is just the way we like our cookies in our house!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

These were very good! I did change a few things... I omitted the nuts because of personal taste. I only added 1.5 cups of white chips per another reviewers recommendations, and they still came out super sweet ( and I LOVE white choc). I added about 1 cup of dried cherries and craisins mixed together, and about a teaspoon of cinnamon (I'm surprised that wasn't listed as an ingredient).  Finally, I added orange zest to the last batch and made a little orange glaze w/ zest, confec. sugar, milk, and vanilla extract that I drizzeled on a few of the cookies right out of the oven. They were moist and fluffy and delicious. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My very picky husband says these are the best cookies he's ever put in his mouth. I divided the dough in half and put nuts in half the batter. I baked two batches of the cookies and froze the remaining dough in individual cookie "balls" to have later. (otherwise we would have eaten the entire batch of cookies in a day or two.) Highly recommend this recipe!!

These were really great cookies! I was craving something sweet and stumbled across this very easy recipe. I didn't have any vanilla extract or baking powder and they still came out fantastic. I was also a little worried about the dough being so crumbly, but they come out fine when you squish the dough in your hands. 

Will definitely make these again!

Loved this recipe!  I added craisins, as well as the white chocolate chips and pecans and they were FAB!!  Very nice chewy texture.  Since I ship them to my friend in Iraq, I did underbake by one minute (or cookies get too hard by the time they get there) but he said they were still very soft and chewy when he got them.  Did not last long, though...he said within 4 minutes of opening the box, his platoon had devoured them!!  :)  My new favorite cookie recipe!!  Thanks for sharing.

I have made several cookies cookies from the recipes on this website.  I have been trying to get my husband to bite into the cookie look at me still with a mouthful and say "wow thith cookieth a great".  This was that cookie!! I did make some changes.  I didn't have real eggs I only had egg beaters and I didn't have any pecans so I used walnuts instead.  For the egg beaters I used 1/4 cup for every egg needed this recipe called for 2 eggs so I used 1/2 cup of egg beaters.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  Usually in other recipes the directions read that you first mix all wet ingredients together and in a seperate bowl mix all dry and then add them all together.  This recipe is different and unlioke all the others this is the only cookie that kept it's shape.  I don't know if that has to do with the order of mixing or not.  All in all a wonderfull cookie.  Thanks for the recipe I will definatley make them again and again!!!

These are fabulous. I just made a small batch and rolled the rest of the dough into 4 clingwrapped rolls for storage in my freezer. The baking mood struck me late tonight after dinner and my folks sat up waiting for me to finish so they could have 2 cookies apiece (that's all I made- they were ready for more!)
Like one reviewer suggested, I decided to chop up white chocolate bars instead of using chips. But the chocolate crumbled into fine shavings when I tried to chop it up so I would recommend keeping the bar out several hours before (mine's stored in the fridge) or perhaps zapping it in the microwave for a few seconds. 
Once the oats were added the dough was pretty hard to work with so I emptied it out onto the table and worked the chocolate chunks into it with my fingers, kind of like kneading bread. Get a big bowl to start with and you shouldn't have a problem-- this in all effect is a one-bowl cookie recipe. Next time I will make these with bits of chopped up white Toblerone to add to the chewiness! Enjoying the yumminess now with some icecream!

Excellent cookie.  These cookies have turned out great each time I made them. The only change I make is not adding pecans.  Otherwise a nice chewy but yet not too chewy cookie.  Great flavor.  Oh I have also combined semi sweet chocolate chipss with the white as my kids prefer the brown to the white.

I used milk chocolate chips in these instead of the white. These were the first cookies on my Christmas cookie trays. Both my husband and boys really liked them! 5 stars! Merry Christmas (:

These cookies were delicious and stayed great for days afterwards (if you can get them to last that long!). I followed the recipe except using splenda instead of white sugar and a mix of white chocolate and peanut butter chips. My only concern was that the batter was dry but it turned out great.

Very good! I couldn't stop eating these, especially when they were all warm and soft form the oven. Yum! I did 2 c. of all purpose flour, with 1 c. of wheat flour. Instead of a full cup of butter, I did a half cup, and added a half c. of canola oil.

I was drawn to this recipe because the amount of reviews, but I made a few changes and everyone ended up loving them.  I switched the volumes of the flour and oats and cut the white sugar by half.

I was disappointed in the way my cookies turned out.  First of all they were very hard in texture. Second the amount of white chocolate chips was way to much for me.  I don't think I'd make them again.  From the other ratings I thought I found a "forever" recipe.  If anyone has some suggestions to make the cookies a little softer, I'd appreciate it.

This was my first ever attempt at baking cookies and they turned out absolutely DELICIOUS! I made a couple of slight adjustments: I only used 1.5 cups of sugar because I wanted to balance out the intense sweetness of the chocolate (I'm glad I did because otherwise they would have been too sweet for my taste). I used milk chocolate in half the cookies because my husband isn't so crazy about white chocolate, and I barely chopped the pecans because I prefer them chunky. I also added an extra egg because the dough seemed a little dry. The result was perfect and I'll definitely be making them again soon! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

These cookies came out absoluely fab last nite!! Instead of pecans, I added walnuts, not too crushed, and it was just awesome! My hubby is such a cookie-lover....and he just couldn't stop eating them. He likes them crunchy, and leaving them extra 5 mins, and turning them over, and putting them back for another 5 was just PERFECT. I love this recipe!
Every cookie recipe from this site, always comes out great, if you follow the recipe! Thanks soo much! :))

Overall, fairly good. I was hoping for chewey and less spreading out. My butter was softened at room temp (which was at least 80 degrees). I will try this again and not let the butter get so soft. 
Also, I used toasted almonds and chocolate chips. The taste is good- I just wish they weren't so flat! 

*But, I will make them again!

Unbelievable!  Thanks so much for sharing.
Instead of using nuts, I added an extra 1/2 C. of oats and only used about 1 3/4 C. white chips.  These are my new favorite cookie!

We found that the cookies came out really hard.  The only modification that I did was half whole-wheat flour and half white.  I do this to most of my cookie recipes and it doesn't usually make them hard, so I don't think that was the reason why they were hard.

The recipe doesn't state this but always use UN-salted butter - otherwise your cookies will taste salty!!  I donned a pair of laytex gloves to do the heavy mixing of the butter/sugar mixture with the flour, etc...Great cookies - you can use any type of nuts you want and you can use any "flavor" of chocolate chips.  Will make again!!

These cookies RULE!! I made them at Christmastime this year and they got scarfed in a couple of days! I've also used semi-sweet choc chips in place of the white chips, and they're also fantastic. The pecans really make a difference, too...They taste great with the white choc chips. Definitely try these cookies - they're wonderful!

Ok, I think I may need some help.  No matter how small I made these cookies, they still spread out and were really thin.. Then, they would cook fast so I burnt a lot of them.  I followed the directions exactly.  Can anyone tell me what I may have done wrong?  

The overall taste of the cookie was very good and the cookie dough was fabulous!!!.. just not please with the thiness.

Excellent.  Made them without nuts for a school Fall PTA Festival and they sold 3 for 75cents at the bake sale.  Sold them all.  Took the full 12 minutes to bake.  Will try them again with butterscotch chips.  Next time I make them with white chocolate chips I may also add so baking M&Ms in half the batch.

This reci[e is EVIL! Beware- these cookies will call out to you while you are sleeping.  Seriously, this rocks! It's quick and easy (though i recommend using walnuts or pecans in place of the almonds), and oh so rich.

The dough was crumbly when I added oats. I think there should be less flour. I didnt have white chips so I put in butterscotch and chocolate. The didnt  rise/spread... tastes ok.

I can't rate this high enough!  These are some of the best cookies I have ever made, and most people think they are store-bought when they try them.  I make them often, and people often ask for the recipe.  They are chewy if you don't bake them for too long.  (You need to take them out of the oven when they seem slightly gooey still.)  The chewy, buttery texture of the dough and the creaminess of the white chocolate chips with a slight oatmeal texture (some people don't even realize there are oats in the cookies), really makes for a great recipe.  I always make extra dough because they go quickly (and because I eat some of the dough from the bowl).  I leave out the pecans, but don't change the recipe other ways.  Thank you for sharing, Julie!

Excellent recipe.  Substituted milk chocolate chips and it was sensational.  Nice and chewy.  It even survived my making two giant cookies and baking them for 14 min. at 350.

The absolute best cookie recipe! I try to only make these for special occasions because I cannot stop eating them!  Try with white chocolate chips and dried cranberries, or white and dark chocolate chips.  Excellent!!

These turned out really well.  I toasted the oats and nuts at 350 for about five minutes to bring out the flavor.  good stuff.  I didn't see a need to refrigerate the dough. I sprayed the cookie sheet lightly with cooking spray and had no problems.  I used white chocolate baking squares roughly chopped, and white chips.

I love these cookies and yes, if you live north of the Mason/Dixon line in the winter your butter will never be soft at room temp! So I nuke it a little on the defrost setting and then I proceed to use a pastry cutter and a wooden spoon, with lots of elbow grease, because the eggs, flour, oats, etc. are all at 68 degrees and the butter will be stiff again as soon as you add them.  But it is so worth it because they are great cookies.  I didn't find them too sweet or too much flour.  I did try using some whole wheat flour for added fiber.  Came out just great a little more brown in color is all. I think you could go with  more oats and less flour and they would still be great.

These cookies came out fairly well.  Mine poofed up a lot and didn't get that oatmeal cookie "look" but the taste is very good.  I used dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, and walnuts in mine.  Overall, a good recipe.

My go to recipe for cookies. Good base that you can easily change whatever fruit, chips or nuts you want. Even change the flour to 2 cups white and 1 cup whole wheat for a little extra fibre.

I really like the flavor and texture of this but I altered the coconut to craisins instead and it is exactly what I was looking for to serve as a party favor for thanksgiving wrapped in plastic and beautiful organza orange fabric with a tie ribbon. Thanks allrecipes!!!

Outstanding! I used walnuts instead of pecans, but they were still one of the best cookies I have made to date! My first batch I made smaller cookies, thinking they would expand quite a bit, but they held their small shape, so the next batch I made, I used bigger spoonfuls and flattened them out a little, turned out much better!

Not bad, but a tad plain tasting. I think maybe some cinnamon might be nice. 3.5 stars but I don't know if I will make them again, I wouldn't mind trying them with butterscotch chips. I baked for exactly 12 minutes and they were the perfect chewy consistency.

This may be my new favorite cookie recipe! I followed some other reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 c white sugar with 1 c whole wheat flour. I added craisins and used sliced almonds instead of pecans. Amazing! I'll probably make another batch tomorrow.

I love this recipe!!!  You are so right they are the disappearing cookies.  I've made batches of these using this recipe several times and brought them into work, and POOF!  They disapear.  Everyone loves these.  One batch I made white chocolate chips with Heath Bar bits, and another time I made them with white chocolate chips and craisins.  Both were incredibly delicious.  They come out perfect, like you bought them at a high end bakery and I receive so many compliments / people asking for the recipe.  Right on!!!

WOW!!! yes, my hips so needed me to find heaven in cookie form. I bake cookies at least twice a week, and these are AMAZING. I can't stay out of them. I did add cinnamon (I feel all oatmeal cookies deserve cinnamon). Thank you for posting this recipe :D

I made this recipe with a few alterations. One of them was involuntary because I ran out of vanilla extract unexpectedly. I used about 1 1/2-3/4t of the extract and I substituted raisins instead of pecans. They tasted wonderful! They froze well too. I made a batch then scooped out the spoonfuls of the rest of the dough, flash froze it, then through the cookies into a freezer bag. I've pulled them out intermittently and cooked them at 350 for about 15-18 minutes from frozen and they are just as delicious!

Awesome cookies.
I added three snack sized boxes of raisins since I think oatmeal cookies and raisins go together like best friends.
I think next time I'll cut back a smidgen on the four to make the batter a little more manageable.

These cookies are delicious!  I'm getting used to a new oven, and found that I could only cook them for 8 minutes.  They came out golden brown on top and I was worried because I HATE crispy cookies, but they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and so chewy, moist, and soft on the inside!!!! Everyone loved them!

Amazing! This is by far the BEST cookie I have ever made - and everyone who has tried them agrees! I followed the recipe exactly as stated and the cookies turned out perfect! They're also great without the pecans.

These cookies are absolutely perfect!!! The only change I made was substituting half the butter for shortening, which resulted in a chewy cookie that didn't spread too much while baking. As recommended by an earlier commenter, I put butterscotch and chocolate chips in half the dough, and dried cranberries/white chips in the other half to make two different varieties....YUM. I've made lots of different cookies, but these rate right up at the top!

These are so good, just the way they are! The only change I made was to use margarine instead of butter since that's all I had in the house. But they were still wonderful! The batter is very dense and a little hard to work with but the end result is so worth it! Thank you so much for a great recipe.

These were really good. It bakes up nicely and they are nice and soft inside. My dad loved them. Next time I think I will add some craisins, although as it stands these are crammed full of good stuff!!

Delicious cookie that stays moist a long time.  I like adding chopped macadamia nuts and about 1/2 cup coconut along with the white chocolate.  These are really hard to resist!

Great recipe.  I'm not a fan of nuts, so I substituted 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the pecans.  They were delicious...especially mixed with the white chocolate chips already in the recipe!

This recipe is ALMOST great.  I made it without any of the white sugar and it was just the right sweetness for me.  If I make them again I will reduce the salt because 1 tsp. was entirely too much.  I would also add more butter and/or another egg because I had to hand knead the dough, it was so dry.  I chose this recipe because it had all of the elements I wanted- white chips, pecans, oatmeal.  It needs a lot of tweaking, though.

My family isn't a big fan of white chocolate, but I had some chips on hand for some odd reason, and we were craving cookies. Oh my goodness, we can't stay out of them! My toddler-age kids never eat cookies with oatmeal, but they LOVE these! The only change I made was that I used almonds, simply because I didn't have any pecans. I bet the pecans would make them even better! We will definitely be making these again,  white chocolate and all!

Yum! I cut the recipe in half (18servings) and made 27 cookies at 1.1oz ea. I used 1/2C white chocolate chips because that's all I had and used 1/2C craisins and 1/2C pecans. The oatmeal flavors the cookie and isn't very visible or affects the cookie texture much. I baked 12 cookies (3x4) at a time on a silicone baking sheet for 11min. The cookies did not brown but they were crispy when cooled. To keep the cookies soft while letting them cool, I left the cookies on the silicone mat and put it on the counter without the hot metal tray.

Wow, these are such yummy cookies! All of my friends who have tried them have commented on how nice they are. I do make sure not to overbake them as they can go hard if left in the oven too long. I think these would also be nice with macadamias in them instead of pecans.

I gave these cookies away to co-workers as Christmas gifts and everyone loved them.  One person told me they were the best cookies they had ever eaten.  I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also refrigerated the dough to keep the cookies from spreading out while baking after rolling them in balls.  They are wonderful cookies.

These were good cookies. I wouldn't necessarily consider them "oatmeal" cookies, however, since they tasted more like chocolate chip cookies. The oatmeal flavour was very subtle. I added semi-sweet chios along with the white chocolate chips and it was tasty! Thanks.

Tried this recipe over the weekend.  I didn't have 2 cups of white chocolate chips so I put in 1 cup white chocolate chips, and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It still turned-out yummy.  The recipe yielded exactly 36 cookies.  I must agree that this recipe should also be called disappearing cookies.  We're down to 6 cookies, in a matter of few days! Thanks for this excellent recipe.

Delicious - crunchy, so if you're looking for a soft cookie, this recipe isn't the one for you.  I substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the white chips, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Took them to a Christmas Cookie Exchange today and they were a huge hit!

These were absolutely delicious.  They taste decadent and bakery quality.  They make a nice big batch of cookies.   I added these to my Christmas cookie plate this year.  The recipe is a keeper and one I'll pass on to friends and family.

HOLY MONKEY!  this recipe is AWESOME.  After i mixed in the oatmeal, white chocolate chips and walnuts (instead of pralines), I was a little worried that they were too chunky, and not enough cookie..but they came out PERFECT.  the texture was great, and everyone's eating them  up!!!  this recipe will be frequently used from now on!  this makes a HUGE batch...so I baked 3 doz, and then the rest I balled up (prob 2 doz?) and froze them on a cookiesheet so I can bake them up late....r

Man, oh man these are good! The perfect "oatmeal cookie" base... can't wait to try it with other combos. It is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I did add 1 tsp cinnamon as suggested. I also used 1 c. wheat flour, 1 1/2 c. white flour and 2 c. oats--instead of what was in the recipe. I also chilled the dough as suggested and had no issues with spreading (I did grease the pan). THANKS!

OH MY WORD!  These cookies are phenomenal!  I substituted chopped macadamia nuts for the pecans and added a 6oz bag of Craisins.  My batch made 4 dozen using a medium size scoop.  There was just enough spread as the cookies baked to keep them chunky and wonderful.  The batter is very stiff, so a big electric mixer is very helpful.  These were by far the BEST cookies I've had in a while!

Awesome!  For the flour, I used wheat for 1/3 of the recipe.  Next time, I will use more than just 1/4 cup of dried cranberries.  SO good!  I think dried apricots diced would be very good also...

These were wonderful, easy to make, and held up well even after being shipped overseas to Iraq. I included a slice of bread to keep them moist, and they arrived in great condition. My boyfriend and his team mates love the cookies and I am already getting ready to make and ship another batch. I left out the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Even with following the recipe exactly, the yield was much more than the recipe stated. This may be because I used a medium Pampered Chef scoop to put the dough balls on the sheets.

Delicious. The dough is very thick once all of the ingredients are added so you need a strong arm to stir them in. I baked mine for just 10 minutes and that was the perfect time for my oven. They are chewy and sweet. Thanks!

Very good cookie. I gave it a 4 because they were not as chewy as I had hoped. Overall a little too sweet. I would cut back the sugar by 1/2 a cup.

Incredible!!!  My 6 yr. old and I made these.  I accidentally stirred the oats (old fashioned) in first and I think she must have added 4 c. flour instead of 3.  The mixture was very dry and crumbly.  To fix it, I added applesauce (about 1/2 - 1 c.) until the mixture was thick and held together.  Instead of nuts, we added shredded raw coconut.  We also added a mix of white and dark chocolate and milk chocolate chips and these cookies were a huge hit!!!  I probably need to write these up with exact measurements as a new recipe.  Sorry about all the modifications, but these were really good cookies.

I had to change the recipe a bit as I did not have all the ingredients on hand.  So I substituted half of the butter, with butter-flavored shortening, used semi-sweet chocolate chips (in lieu of white chocolate) and omitted the nuts, only because I didn't have them on hand.  With these changes they were delicious, so I can only imagine how yummy the recipe is as stated.  My teenage son didn't even recognize the rolled oats!!

These cookies are really awesome!  I made them just as the recipe reads minus the nuts.  Also, I added some dried cranberries in about 1/4 of the batch.  Both kinds were delicious!  I'll definitely be making these again.

These are the BEST cookies I've ever had!  I crushed a white chocolate bar and added butterschotch chips, but really the cookie would taste good with anything mixed in!  My brother-in-law comes from a long line of bakers and even he said, "Wow!".

I was looking for a recipe to use for butterscotch chip cookies. So I tried this one, substituting butterscotch chips for the white chocolate chips (of course), and subbing 1 cup of toffee bits for the pecans. These were the best! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I follow the recipe exactly, but I put in dried cranberries instead of the nuts.  The flavor of the cookie is outstanding!!  Family, friends, and co-workers love these!

Chose this recipe for a cookie party invitation I received and this was my very first attempt at cookie baking. These cookies were excellent and a huge hit both at the party and home with my family. A tad sweet so if that's not your thing be warned.

-This is Diana's 14-yr-old daughter-

These cookies were amazing! I made them for drama class at school and followed the recipe exactly. They were a hit!! All of my friends were raving about them. Even my friend who absolutely HATES oatmeal fell in love with them. These are cookies that will be loved by everyone, indeed.

I was looking for a great recipe that I could tweak a little bit.  I had tasted a phenomenal cookie on vacation that had white chocolate chips, oatmeal, almonds, and big juicy cranberries in it.  So....I added a cup of coarsely chopped almonds instead of the pecans, and a cup of reconstituted dried cranberries to the mix, and they are the new favorite around this house.  My husband LOVES cookies, and usually wants only oatmeal raisin (Beth's spicy oatmeal raisin to be exact,) but he said this is his new all time favorite cookie.  It's a terrific recipe! Thank you!!

I really like this recipe-the cookies turned out delicious. The cookies turned out pretty soft with a slightly crunchy texture. The pecans were a nice addition and not too overwhelming. My only qualm is that there was not a lot of oatmeal taste to a supposedly oatmeal cookie. Next time I think I will omit the pecans and add more oatmeal.

AMAZING!! Had to use dark brown sugar as I was out of light brown, and didn't quite have enough sugar to fill 1 cup, but they still came out FANTASTIC!  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

Really rich, sweet cookie. These stayed pretty much the same shape when cooked, barely any spread. For time's sake, I used a  butter flavor crisco stick. The dough was so dry and crumbly I thought I had made an error and checked my directions several times. I baked these anyway and they turned out great! Fat Tuesday may take on new meaning with these diet busters. Definitely a do over once lent is over, sure wish I'd found this recipe sooner! Thanks Julie, these are wonderfully delicious cookies.

Yum!  I just had to put a piece of gum in my mouth so that I would stop eating these cookies.  I substituted 1 c. of craisins for the nuts and they are perfect.  They hold their shape nice, and they have this great texture...even today, and I made them yesterday.  Try this recipe!  It is well worth it.

Very yummy!!  A HUGE hit at the Christmas party.  Love how they are still slightly chewy.  They are VERY addicting.  

I used a small scoop and yielded about 72 cookies.  I also baked on parchment paper.  These were a success at 5500 feet (high altitude)

These were SUPER!  I followed the recipe to a "t" except omitted the pecans as my roommate doesn't like them.  I would like to try them with the cookies though, as these were great.  I had 8 right after making them.  Did not have any problems with the dough being too dry-it was just right.  This recipe definitely does not have that much oatmeal in it, so if you like really oatmeal-y cookies you may try adding more.  I love non-flat cookies, and these were perfect!  Cooked for exactly 10 minutes and they were soft and yummy.

Yummy cookies!  The only thing I needed to change was the addition of some water to the mix to get it moist enough to spoon onto the pan.  I also found that a I could use a smaller drop amount per cookie and that allowed ALOT of cookies to go around!!  Will make again for sure!

Best oatmeal cookies I've tasted, I am getting rid of other recipes - esp. b/c these cookies actually rise well, it must be baking powder.  Also, dried cherries are a great addition instead of or along with pecans.

The batter WAS sticky, as stated by a previous reviewer. As a result, I wound up rolling them into balls then flattening them into the size I wanted.   You can certainly use a melon baller   to get a uniform size - the dough does not spread, so no worries there. I  reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and the amount of white chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups. I opted not to use nuts, although I'm sure they'd be a great addition. At first, when I took them out of the oven, based on their appearance, I didn't think I would like these cookies.  Once completely cooled, they were perfect; a nice chewy cookie. I took them to work today and my coworkers were yelling at me for bringing them in!  Not because they were bad, but because they couldn't stop eating them.  I made half as recipe stated, and the remaining half I added Craisins and those were the ones that went the quickest.

I LOVE this recipe!  I did change one thing, I exchanged the pecans for dried cranberries and took them to a christmas cookie exchange, at least  5 people asked for the recipe that night and I've gotten 2 more calls since.  I'm making them again today to take to my family christmas celebration, I'm sure they'll be a hit there too!

Just made these today and they were awesome! They didnt spread out much so I lightly pressed down each rounded ball of dough before baking. You do have to watch very carefully during the last 3 minutes because they can burn quickly! Thanks for sharing this one! I now have a new fave cookie recipe added to my collection.

These were yummy! I undercooked them on purpose because I like cookies almost  raw in the middle and omited the nuts.  Could have used less flour because the dough was on the dry and crumbly side. The oatmeal and white chocolate combo is complementary. Will make again!

Tried twice with both white(didn't have chips) and chocolate chunks. I think it tasted better with milk chocolate chunks. Maybe I should try with white chocolate chips next time.

I toasted the pecans before adding them to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cookies were thick, chewy and delicious and people raved about them at my Super Bowl party. I will definitely make these again, maybe with regular chocolate chips next time.

These cookies were really good. Instead of 2 cups chocolate chips i did 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup white chocolate chips. Instead of the pecans or nuts i added rice crispie treats. I cooked them for 15 minutes . They turned out amazing!!

WOW! I just made these cookies and they are disappearing like crazy. I have 4.5 yo triplets and 12yo girl and they are MAD about these. I love them too. EASY to make and i made almost 80 cookies dropping them by tsp fulls. They are so chewy just yummy. I joined just so i could rave about this recipe. I baked them 9 minutes in my convection oven just perfect.

These cookies were pretty yummy!  I always like to add a little whole wheat flour into anything I make that calls for flour, so I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of regular flour.  I also increased the vanilla to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  The only thing I didn't like about the cookies was that they didn't flatten out while baking (my family likes flat cookies!)  (Also, I used regular chocolate chips instead of white chocolate and they still tasted great!)

Cookies were delicious except like others I found that the batter was too dry and wouldn't hold together so I had to add some milk.  Mommies from my playgroup are still talking about them!

Best cookies I have ever had. I made 4 batches and mixed raisins in with one of them. I also mixed semisweet milk choc chips  with the white and they are DELICIOUS. Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I first made these cookies for a meeting, and everyone ate them up in no time.  My boyfriend and family also agree that these are my best chocolate chip cookies.  Because I have a lot of chocolate fans, I added regular chocolate chips instead of the white ones.  You have to try this recipe--not only are the cookies yummy, but they come out pretty also!

These cookies were delicious!  They did mix up very dry but baked up nicely.  Next time, I'll use half the white chocolate chips - as some cookies were on the verge of being too sweet because of the amount of chips.

These cookies were absolutely fabulous!! would not change a thing. I took them over to a friend's house for dinner and there were none left.  Her hubby begged me to show his wife how to make them. Great nutty flavor and extremely moist.  THESE ARE THE BEST!!! Thanks for sharing Julie =)

I would have given this recipe a 5 star rating, however, I think its just a little too dry. There is too much flour and/or oats. I had to add an egg and some butter to get it to a consistancy that would hold together. Perhaps there was a mistake in the recipe.

First I halved the recipe.  Due to comments read, I used just 1/3 cup of each of the sugars.  I used 1/2 cup olive oil (light tasting, NOT extra virgin) instead of butter.  Added a splash of milk.  Used only 1/2 cup of chips (plenty).  Forgot to add cinnamon someone suggested.  Cut salt in half, still okay.  Probably could cut soda in half or leave out.  I thought cookies were a little salty.  Good recipe!  Recommend!

Wow these were a hit!  My 15 yr old son is smuggling them to school - and he isn't even a big sweet eater.  My husband can't stop raving about them.  I, myself find them a little sweet, but very good.

Thought these turned out tasting really great. I was a little worried because the dough seemed really dry, but I was pleasantly surprised. I usually don't add nuts, but I found the pecans really added a wonderful flavor.  These were a great alternative to the typical choc chip cookie.

Excellent cookie! The only change I made was to put in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans instead of a cup. They were delicious!!

Although I am not a big fan of white chocolate, I thought this cookie was very good.  Brought it to a meeting and people who weren't on a diet snatched it up.  If requested, I would make this recipe again.

These are so good, I am not done baking them yet and we have already ate a couple dozen.  I  made them fairly small for a teacher appreciation lunch, so there is enough to go around, I know they will be a big hit.

This was a pretty good cookie recipe. I used 1 C white chips and 1 C milk chocolate chips. My cookies were a little flat but it could have been the low-fat margarine I used. I would make these again.

Really did turn out great. Very Yummy and will make again. 12 minutes is truly tops on the oven or 14 maybe if your scoop sizes are slightly bigger like mine. Even if they dont look too browned they will be done and chewy

wow.  I have found my go-to oatmeal base cookie recipe right here, and I've been baking for over 40 yrs.  Let me first say that the 3 cups of flour sort of set my antenna up, as I usually don't see that much flour in a recipe that also has oatmeal but I proceeded as directed.  To note, I use the old fashioned rolled oats.  The dough was very very stiff, and it took a couple of minutes of grunt to get the flour mixed in, then I had to add the nuts and chips.   The dough will appear very 'dry' but not to worry, and don't tinker.  don't add milk or anything else.  Just proceed.  I used a large size pampered chef cookie scoop and did not press down, just placed the scoops on the cookie sheet.  10 minutes was perfect for my oven.  The finished result?  a cookie that is thick, slightly crispy on the outside, but moist and chewy on the inside, and they looked gourmet-like in appearance. These are absolutely wonderful, and will disappear quick, quick.  Texture, flavor, appearance...this cookie has it all.  I did not refrigerate the dough, as I saw no need d/t the stiffness of it when mixed together.  perfect, perfect.  I love the versatility of the recipe.  The possibilities are endless with chips, dried fruit, nuts.  This made 4 dozen using the large size pampered chef cookie scoop.

I really don't like giving a negative review, but I have to agree with other reviewers who stated the dough was rather dry and difficult to handle.  also, this is a very sweet cookie.  (And I love sweet!)

YUM!!! Hands down, these rock!!! This is my go to recipe for cookies now. I don't have any special mixer, i just used my immersion blender with the whisk attachments for the steps up to adding the flour. For the rest, I had to knead by hand. It was def. a dry dough, I had my doubts, but, I kneaded until everything came together. I made rough balls, 1 inch apart, they do not flatten much when they bake, but that's exactly why I like these. I only had 3 mini semi sweet chocolate bars that i chopped up and threw in - I skipped the nuts. 11 min. Perfect. Great recipe!

I added  salted 
macadamia nuts instead of pecans.  Also, you need to watch carefully because they will burn easily.  Take out as soon as you see a little brown starting.

Excellent as written.  Did half with white chips and pecans and the other with chocolate chips.  My family thought they were better the second day than when they first came out of the oven.

I substitute one of the cups of flour for oat flour. It gives it a nice oat flavor. Use real butter for best texture and taste. I make balls and freeze them. Then just pop them on a tray and bake for an extra minute or two.

This is my second time making these.  I agree that toasting the oatmeal and pecans makes a flavorful difference.  I also put the oats and nuts in the food processor to chop them.  I am not sure how I made them the first time but after reading the reviews I decided to use 1 cup oatmeal and the dough held together.  Very tasty,  I will keep this one in my recipe box!

These cookies turned out dry and hard.  Many like this recipe, but I don't.  Great ingredients, great taste, but bad consistency. I'm going to try the trick of storing the cookies with a piece of soft white bread for a day to see if they soften up.

These ended up being very good cookies but like another reviewer I had to add some liquid to make it moist enough to form into balls. I used about 1/4 cup milk. The only change I made was to use 1 tsp orange extract and 1 tsp vanilla. The orange flavour really adds to these cookies! I also used macadamia nuts because I wanted a white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie. The texture and taste were awesome in the end!

Way too sweet, way to crumbly for my taste.  These did not spread at all for me.  I did try to flatten them about half way through the baking time, not too effective.  I had hoped to take these to a luncheon but will have to make something else.  I did follow directions as written.  I won’t be making these again.

Im sorry but I dont know why people are saying this is the best cookie they have ever had. It seems like they juat took an oatmeal cookie recipe and a chocolate chip cookie recipe and mashed them together. The taste is good but just taking the oatmeal cookie recipe off the back of the quaker oats package and adding mixins from there would have been better or just taking a chocolate chip cookie recipe and going from there. Either would have turned out better. The dough was too crumbly and I had to mush the dough by hand to get it to form any shape which made them too dense. So like I said next time I will just take a clasic oatmeal cookie recipe and go from there.

I made it and they were very good. I used half wheat flour and half white flour, and use Crisco for the butter. Will make these again.

Cut white sugar to half cup.
Used all butter.
Stirred in half cup each of coconut, golden raisins, dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips.
Added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts. 
Refrigerated so I could bake them just before the kids got home from school.

These were good, but SOOOO sweet (and I like sweet things!)  Used craisins instead of nuts, and I liked the tang of the craisin against the super sweet cookie.  Will make again, but I'll cut down on the sugar, you really don't need 2 cups.

I have made this plenty of times, I can say I sometimes go heavy on the chips and the nuts, sometimes I also substitute nuts for whatever I have handy. Sometimes to finish them off I drizzle them with dark chocolate.

I had self rising flour so I used the called for 3 cups flour plus 1 teaspoon baking powder. I replaced the white chocolate chips with a 4 oz bar of Bakers white chocolate, grated. Baked for 11 minutes. So good and soft yet crunchy. Super good. I will definitely make this recipe again!

End result was tasted. I followed the recipe as written, but found half way through mixing in the flour to the creamed butter the product was really dry (burned up my hand mixer). So I added roughly a 1/2 cup of applesauce and was back in business! I skipped the nuts and went easy on the chips and came up with a great tasting cookie!

These are soooo yummy! I did add less sugar on both the white and brown, still plenty sweet. And I cut the white chocolate chips to 1 cup instead of 2, and no salt.

These cookies turned out much better than expected.  Next time, I will make them with less white chocolate chips.  Probably 1.5 cups, not 2 cups.  They were just a little overpowering and hard to mix in that many chips.  I'll add a bit more flour as they spread out too much.  (this is a perpetual cookie issue with me, I always add more flour).

I followed the recipe but omitted the nuts as my toddler can’t chew them. 
I feel like the white chocolate chip was a bit too much. 1 cup would have been perfect.  ANyways every one loved it. Good recipe

Given the pictures and the worry that there was too much flour, I used only 2 cups of flour instead of 3. I baked them for 11 minutes (after flattening them with a spoon a bit), and they came out flat and chewy, just the way I like them! Next time I'll cut the white sugar by at least half a cup, and I'll add cranberries as well. Cinnamon was a great addition too! Will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  Even both of my kids loved these! They do not have a typical oatmeal cookie flavor or texture (or at least not enough for him to detect.) I used higher-quality Ghiradelli white chocolate chips, toasted pecans and Oates as another taster suggested. I think this helps develop the flavors a bit. I might use fewer pecans next time. Thanks for an easy, great-tasting cookie recipe!

The taste is pretty good, however mine didn’t flatten out. Not sure what I did different than what the recipe called for other than not sifting the dry ingredients and I also used unbleached flour. The batter was very dry so I had to mould it into round balls. Still taste good.

These were making coming out of the oven and the next day. They didn't flatten out as much as I'd like and they turned into rocks after about 2 or 3 days, even in tupperware.

Wow!  This is one of the best recipes for cookies I have ever made.  If I wouldn't have had a stand mixer it would have been hard to mix.  The dough is thick.  The cookie doesn't spread a lot and stands up nicely.  Absolutely delicious.

I made a half batch.  The dough seemed a little dry, even before adding the oatmeal/chips/nuts.  I added 2 T. of applesauce for moisture.  I also added about 1/4 c. of dried cranberries.  I baked the cookies (on parchment paper) for ten minutes, then allowed then to rest on the cookie sheet for another two minutes before moving to a cooling rack.  Great flavor, perfect chewy texture.

These are amazing!! Soft and chewy with the perfect amount of sweetness. They puffed up beautifully while cooking then settled to a nice bumpy appearance after cooling. I highly recommend them and so does my family.

Great recipe!Like one review suggested to bake Oatmeal in the oven and then blend it .Instead I used the pan on top stove  (for time saving), blended the Oatmeal afterwords. I used whole wheat flour and because my dough was too dry I added 3 Tb. Spoons of unsweetened apple sauce. My family gobbled them up .I will make them again tomorrow but will add lemon zest and lemon juice as per my daughters request .

Great texture!  Cookies didn't flatten out.  I did cool dough a bit and I added 1/4 cup shredded coconut.  Definitely a keeper.

Excellent.  Even the picky chocolate hating husband loved them.  At first, I thought I did something wrong as they seemed to dry, but they cooked up perfectly in exactly 12 minutes.  Love this recipe.

I cut the amount of sugar in half and added pumpkin pie spice. I also put 1 cup of white chocolate chips and 1 cup of cranberries.  They were yummy!

It's a very stiff dough.  Just keep working it.  I had to have my boyfriend take over with the mixing because it is really hard to stir.  I had to work the dough with my hands just a bit in the end.  With that said, there a lot less moisture in this dough, which in the long run, is a good thing because the texture becomes amazing.  However... the trick is DO NOT OVERBAKE.  10 minutes only and better to take out too early than too late because they will get tough.  My first batch was so delicious.  I thought I undercooked them, but once they cooled, they firmed up nicely.  Like those great bakery cookies in which  I've been looking for. The taste of the cookie is so good.  (The only change was 1/2ing the chips which I found plenty sweet.)  I would say the biggest challenge in this cookie is getting the strength and patience to mix this stiff dough to get the dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl to mix in, but if you do, you will have an amazing cookie!

Just made 1/2 a batch. Used 3/4 cup white chocolate holiday chips, 1/4 cup butterscotch chips ,1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp speculaas spice mix from King Arthur flour website. I only had the old fashioned oats so I used 3/4 cup. Baked at 12 minutes then let it sit to cool on tray for about 5 minutes. Came out great-- even the kids liked it and they usually don't like oatmeal.

Fabulous! The cookies didn't spread much in the oven, so I made balls of dough and pressed them into 1/4 inch thick discs on the cookie sheet.  12 minutes later - heaven.

A great recipe!
I  cut the ingredients in half  and ended up with 30 mid sized beautiful cookies :)
Will definitely do again but next time with maybe 3/4 of the sugar quantity... it was way too sweet.

I found this recipe to be a lot of trouble.  The only change I made was to use dried cranberries instead of nuts, but I was surprised by how thick the batter was even before adding the oats, chips, and fruit.  In fact I broke my cookie scoop trying to portion these onto the "lightly greased" tray to which they stuck after being baked.  While the taste was fine these are just not worth the work.

The perfect oatmeal cookie base! Add dried cherries with the white chocolate chips and left out the nuts. Baking time was about 14 minutes in my oven. Yummy! Will definitely make these cookies again and again.

Super tasty! I did what one reviewer suggested and toasted and ground the oats and pecans. They don't spread much on a siplat mat so you could squash then down if you wanted but they are perfect with all white chocolate. Carmel-y flavor.

Delicious recipe!  I only had wheat flour on hand which may have been the reason my dough came out dry.  By adding 1 extra egg and an additional 1/4 cup of butter, the cookies were awesome!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe "to the T"! Soooo glad I had all the ingredients on hand... Omgg these are hands down the best cookies I've ever baked. I mean, wow! Because I had chocolate chip cookies in the oven at the time, I refrigerated the dough until I had the oven cleared. I wonder if that helped with the shape.. I rolled the dough into tablespoon sized balls and placed them on foil (that I prepared with butter and flour for non stick). Pulled them out at 11 minutes. Let them cool for 5 mins on the baking sheet. They were perfect. Not cakey, not flat, but nice and round with light golden brown bottoms. The oatmeal gave them that "old fashioned/ hand me down recipe taste", the pecans took it to a whole new level... And the white chocolate was perfect! i thought it would be too sweet, but it was perfection.. Slight butterscotch taste... But without being overwhelming. Yumm

These cookies are  very tasty, my family enjoyed them very much.  I found the dough very dry and difficult to form into cookies. I had to flattening them with a fork halfway through the baking time. I think there is too much flour in the recipe… I will try these again reducing the flour  to 2 cups.

The only changes I made were: I halved the recipe, I used 1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup dried cherries.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla.  This made 22 medium-sized cookies.  My husband and I both love fresh baked cookies and these are a favorite!

This cookie is really tasty, and i'm sure will be a hit at my school event.  However i did have the problem that some of the other reviewers listed, after adding in flour mixture it was so dry and crumbly.  I ended up adding a little water, and that resulted in me having to bake them about 4 mins longer.  They turned out great, but I will probably use less flour next time.

The oatmeal was not prominent in this recipe. I added an extra cup of oats and some cinnamon. They were tasty, but not a traditional oatmeal cookie. It would be more accurately described as a sugar cookie with oats, choc, and pecan.

I was looking for something specific and couldn't find it so this was a great starter. I added 1 egg and subtracted 1/2 cup of oatmeal. I then added 1 C. Cranberries. 1 C. Shredded coconut, and substituted macadamia nuts for the pecans! DELISH!!

Really yummy cookie. Only reason I rated 4 stars is because I think they could stand a bit less sugar (and I love me some sugar). So next time I'll reduce the white sugar to maybe half the amount since the sweetness of the white chocolate chips and pecans help sweeten the cookie as well. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, but can cut back sugar, and use applesauce instead of the butter....or use half butter and half applesauce

PERFECT cookie! Soft on the inside with a crispy outside. I reduced the serving size in half and only used sucanat for the 1 cup sugar. I also omitted the pecans (personal preference). The only thing I would do different next time is reduce the sugar to 1/2 - 3/4 cup for a half batch because the white chocolate chips are so sweet in and of themselves that the addition of a full cup of sugar made these overly sweet.

I absolutely love this recipe! I doubled it for making it at work..if you make med. sized cookies you get about 15-20. I also put coconut extract in it and it's amazing! I jus used half vanilla and half coconut. I recommend! I used a little less oats and tiny bit less chips. I was very satisfied with the way they came out..perfect! Will be making many more in the future! : )

I loved these! I took the advice of another and toasted the pecans and oats prior to adding to the dough. Placed the pecans on the dull side of foil and baked at 350 for 5 minutes. Flip them and bake another 5 min. Same instructions for the oats. This brought out a toasty flavor in the cookies in an amazing way. I will definitely add this recipe to my favorite list!

These are good. Hubby liked. I thought they were to chocolatee he didn't. I threw in about 3/4cup of dried cranberries as I really wanted to make the white chocolate cranberry cookie recipe on this site but needed more cookies that that one had and not enough cranberries. It was a good addition. Used walnuts, my preference over pecans. Took 12 minutes on a light cookie sheet. Still chewy which we prefer over crunchy.

Great recipe yes you can change it, and use different nuts or add cranberries. But I love the recipe the way it is. A nice change from your typical milk chocolate cookie.

I decided to add a little "Christmas" to this cookie! Instead of pecans, I added 1 cup of peppermint pieces (I used crushed candy canes). The cookies were SO delicious!!! I took them into work and my fellow teachers went crazy over them. I will definitely make them again this season.

I have made these several times & they are always a hit!  I also add dried cranberries  (after substituting some of the white chocolate chips).

Here is my question:  Can you make the dough ahead of time & either freeze it or refrigerate it?  Will the cookies still come out soft & delicious?  I have never tried this.

Fun cookie for non-chocolate lovers. I added flaxseed, cut the nuts, dashed with pink sea salt before putting in the oven - & the big hit was a dried cranberry atop each. Plopped Em on the sheet heavy so they almost looked like scones. ??

These were absolutely fabulous!  They stayed thick and chewy and wonderful.  I did make a couple substitutions just because I was out of a few things.  I used half butter, half coconut oil.  Also half regular flour and half whole wheat flour to try to make it a little less guilty of a pleasure.  I didn't have any white chocolate so I chopped up some left over almond bark.  It was soooo good!

Great recipe.  The best cookie recipe I have tried.  I don't use Ghiradelli chips. I cook for 8 minutes in my oven.  Good eating.  PS I leave out the pecans cuz never know who has a nut allergy.

I think the ratio of dry ingredients to wet ingredients in this is WAY too high, after baking even after greasing the sheet the cookies did not spread.

I just made these and they're great! They are a bit difficult for old arthritic hands to mix, but I persisted. I don't like nuts in anything, so just used 1 cup of white choc chips and 1 cup of dark choc chips (for my hubby). My question is about the calorie count - is it really 230 per cookie?! Yikes!

I was more than a little surprised with these cookies.  They were very, very tasty.  Good chew with a little crunch on the bottom.  The only thing off to me was so little oatmeal and a bit to much on the white chocolate chips.  Not that I don't love white chocolate chips!!  One other small thing is I use walnuts instead of Pecans.  I love them both also but had walnuts at the time.  Very much worth the time and effort to make.  I made 3 dozen big cookies out of the batch.

I made the recipe from instruction and my batter/cookies were a little dry. I added roughly 2-3 tbls of milk to make the batter gooey and creamy, this made the cookies soooo good. I live in the northern/dry region. I often have to add more wet ingredients to keep from having overly dry cakes, cookies, bread, etc.

I agree with the review that said there is something incorrect with the ingredients. I followed the recipe to the letter, but the dough became so stiff that I broke my heavy-duty spoon trying to stir in the chips and pecans. I could have built a wall with the dough. The cookies are good, but not worth the exercise trying to stir it. (maybe needs more liquid of some sort?)

I'm a bit finicky, and this is probably the best base cookie recipe I've found.  I added cranberries for Christmas, but it would make a fanstastic white choco macadamia cookie.  Or anything else mixed in!  A keeper for sure!

These are fabulous! Yes, the dough is a little crumbly...use your hands to mix it up if you have to! They bake up beautifully, holding their shape pretty well. Nice mounds of deliciousness :)

This has got to be the very best cookie recipe in the entire world!!! I made these exactly how the recipe calls, and took some to my nephews game they were such a hit I know make them twice a week and sell cookies, people give them 10 stars but I'm only allowed to give five, what a shame! Any ways thanks a huge amount for such a fantastic recipe.

This was a good recipe with a lot of potential. I think 3 cups of flour is probably ok if you use the stir-lightly spoon-level method like you would for a cake. I don't usually do that for cookies, so I came out with almost too crumbly dough like others here experienced, so I added 2 additional tablespoons of softened butter. I toasted 1 1/2 cups of pecans and also added 1 cup of white chocolate chips to the dough and made the first 2 dozen. In the remaining dough went an additional 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips for a loaded cookie. The dough is quite stiff, so I pressed each dough ball down to about 2/3" thick, and they came out great. All four dozen were gone in no time!

Excellent cookie. I did half with white chocolate and half with butterscotch. Both were very good.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I did make some adjustments as per several of the reviews.  I deceased the white sugar to 3/4 C. and may reduce it more in the future.  Used 1/2 C butter & 1/2 C butter flavored Crisco.  Used 1 1/2 C. flour and 3 C. oats.  Decreased baking powder to 1/2 t. as I'd never used that in cookies before. Also only used 1 C. white chips and added 1 C. craisens.  The end result is incredible.  Will definitely make again!  Connie S.

Theses cookies were very good.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the way the recipe is written you cannot really taste that there is any oatmeal in the cookies.  They were awesome cookies though!

Amazing! Similar to some of the other users, I cut the sugar and brown sugar in half and that was plenty sweet! I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour. Although it was hard to work with b/c it seemed dry, the cookies came out awesome.

This is my new favorite cookie. The only change I made was reducing the chocolate chips to 1-1/2 cups. I did not find them to be too sweet as others have. I did not pack the brown sugar and my dough consistency was perfect. The cookies have a slightly crunchy outside with a soft middle, which is my favorite kind.  I used a medium cookie scooper so my cookies were smaller and I got 64 cookies instead of 36.

I tried these cookies today and they came out great. I followed the recipe verbatim. The only adjustment I made was making the cookies nut free and substituting with extra chocolate chips for some of the dough and adding the pecans to the rest. Great recipe.

After reading other reviews, I made a couple of changes.  I decreased the flour by 1/2 cup and increased the oatmeal by the same amount.  I removed a third of the dough before adding the pecans, and added 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/3 teaspoon of cinnamon to that part  My husband loved both variations.  I will probably add the raisins and cinnamon each time I make it.  The cinnamon especially added to the goodness of the cookie to me.

I really liked the texture of these cookies. However, I think they need a little more flavor. They are mostly just sweet. Next time I make them I will take the suggestion to put a little cinnamon in them. I would also like to try nutmeg or perhaps chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips. It is a good basic recipe that could be tweaked in many ways with a little imagination.

I baked these cookies about 11-12 minutes on 350 and they were still a little doughy in the center and quite puffy. I tried flattening them and that helped some. The flavor was good, but not our favorite oatmeal cookie. I did milk chocolate chips and found 2 cups was far too much to add--about 1/3 of them just crumbled out when I formed the cookie balls because there were so many.

These were very good!  I subbed chocolate chips in for half of the white chips.  I didn't have the problem some other reviewers claimed about the ingredients not mixing well.  I just added the oatmeal in along with the flour mixture.  I did have a few chips and nuts left at the end of the cookie dough; so next time, I will probably decrease the chips by half a cup.  I made mine pretty large, and ended up with about 5 1/2 dozen cookies.

These cookies are amazing. I used walnuts because I didn't have pecans on hand. I also cut down the sugar by 1-2 tbsp and cut down white choc by almost half. I used small OXO cookie scoop and I found baking for 8-9 mins gave these cookies really thick and chewy texture. I happened to refrigerate the dough overnight so I am not entirely sure whether that contributed to the nice texture. Next time, I am going to try white choc and cranberry combo...can't wait! 
Overall, this recipe is a keeper!! Thanks so much :)

The dough was very dense and almost dried out by the time I got to the 3rd pan. Mine didn't spread like some other reviewers, but I did use parchment paper rather than greasing the pan. I think I would cut back the flour, but I hate to adapt recipes, so I would probably just as well not make this recipe again.

I'm a cook at a camp.  I make these by the hundreds.  I do substitute the raisins for Craisins.

  I also freeze the lumps of scooped cookie dough then bake the frozen dough for a more concentrated flavor. 

 I was told, ''These cookies are like a party in my mouth.''

I don't even like white chocolate, but I LOVE these cookies.  A friend of mine made them for my daughter's wedding, and we packaged them up and put them in cute bags for party favors.  Everyone loved them.  There are three things that make them even better. Add an extra cup of the white chips, toast the pecans first, and slightly mash the cookie dough down before baking.  Also, bake only till slightly golden brown on places on the top of the cookie and no more, or the bottoms get burned where the chips were on the bottom. Pull them out when they are more white in color than golden.

These were really delicious!  I did not add the pecans (didn't have any in the cupboard), but they were still delicious.  I measured the cookies out with a tablespoon and let them cook in a rounded shape.  I pressed them with a fork after they cooked for 10 minutes on 350.  They were excellent!

These were amazing!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I used chopped macadamia nuts & less than 2 cups of the white choc chips b/c I thought 2 C were plenty!  Plus I made large cookies by using the large scooper and baked approx 3 mins longer.  Yummm!!  Da kine!!!!

Wow, really sweet the way it's written. Half way threw the batter I added another 1/2 cup of oats. Made a huge difference in cutting the sugar down.  I also used almonds instead of pecans. Otherwise delicious.

I made these cookies for the first time in December 2009 for a friend to take home for Christmas to his family.  He said his mom loved them and wanted the recipe.  I had forgotten what I had made until the other day when I pulled out this recipe to make for a trip to Six Flags.  I always take "cookie bars".  I made them with some chips I can get at a bakery in Belvedere, TN called butter pecan mix.  I added walnuts this time.  We couldn't make the trip due to weather so I brought them into work and everyone has raved about them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the most requested cookie in my house. A few changes I've made are to use Macadamia nuts, 1 cup dried blueberries or cranberries, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg.

Yummy cookies with a few substitutions/changes: 1) decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup, 2) increased the vanilla extract to 1 TBSP., 3) swapped out 1 cup of the white chocolate for dried cranberries (Craisins). I've baked with dried cranberries before and found them to be quite bland, so that's why I upped the amount of vanilla extract. And two cups of sugar just sounded like a lot. I would make it again.

Wow.. yummy!  While I love pecans, I didn't have any on hand, so I added 1/2 cup of toasted coconut and  reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup.  These remind me of something Mrs. Fields would sell.. excellent!

OH MY GOSH. this was some stiff dough to try and mix up!!  Followed recipe as written, but only used 1 cup White Chocolate chips, and added 1 cup of Craisens for a holiday look, and 1/2 cup pecans, as per another reviewer.  I baked these at 350 degrees for 10 minute, on parchemnt paper, and let cool on pans for another cpl minutes, and this was perfect.  Cookies are a little too sweet, so next time I make these, will cut back on the sugars. Thanks for a real tasty Oatmeal cookie!!

These are a very sweet cookie. I will make these again as an alternate to choc. chip cookies. I like having the oats in them, be aware the dough is pretty stiff by the end of adding all of the ingredients.

Every one who ate these raved about them.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They raised nicely, were not too crisp and not too cake-like. I try so many cookie recipes that if they aren't fabulous I don't make them a 2nd time.  I will make these again for sure.

I just made these cookies for the first time. I used milk chocolate/peanut butter chips instead of white, and chopped walnuts instead of pecans. They turned out FABULOUS ! ! ! If I could give them six stars I would.

These cookies are the best! I've made then about a dozen times and they are alwasys a huge hit! I don't use pecans and add extra vanilla to the dough. I also cook them for only 9 minutes so they are gooey on the inside. So good!

These are really buttery and delicious, although there aren't enough oats for my taste.  Next time I'll try adding more oats and less flour.  I did not use pecans.

Yum! This recipe was good, we gobbled them up. I used all brown sugar and it still tasted amazing. Why 4 stars? The came out rather flat and I would have liked some more volume to them.

I made these strictly to the recipe . . . except I had half white chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips, so thats what I used. :) Turned out fantastic!!! I took the majority of them to the fire station, where my husband is a fire fighter, they were a huge huge hit!! Thank you for this recipe!

I added about a cup of coconut and used 1/2 butterscotch and half white chocolate chips.  That probably changed the recipe's flavor quite a bit, but they turned out great! Never had a better oatmeal cookie!

This is a tender, tasty, and quick to make.  Add some dried cranberries to the dough for a tart kick that makes a beautiful Christmas cookie too.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe, especially for those who are allergic to real chocolate.

These are really good, but a lot of the remaining batter was unusable because it was all chips, oats and pecans, it wouldn't hold together.

The perfect chocolate chip oatmeal cookie!    I did not have white chips so I used semi sweet chips.  My husband does not like nuts in his cookies so I substituted fine shredded coconut instead.

I just made these for the first time and forgot the baking powder -- whoops! But I don't know how they could have been any better. They're soft, chewy and delicious.

DS Loves White Chocolate and these did not disappoint.  He grabbed a few warm ones on his way out the door, and made a special phone call a few minutes later to tell me that these cookies were great! Thanks for the recipe.

I like this recipe but will make some minor alterations. First I did cut the sugars to 3/4 c each and it is still a very sweet cookie. I think that I will also cut back on the salt and even the flour maybe to 2 1/2 c as they were quite dense. Also, I used a cookie scoop and the cookies stayed very high - not sure why. Any ideas?

These were just OK.  I thought the white chocolate was just too sweet for my tastes.

Updated review: first, a confession. This is my favorite cookie recipe EVER. However, I'm trying to be on a more sensible diet, so I made these modifications and they still turned out great! I used 1/2 cup light butter and 1/2 cup Country Crock light margarine; 1/2 cup Splenda baking blend instead of the white sugar; 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar blend instead of light brown sugar; 1.5 cups whole-wheat flour and 1.5 cups regular flour; 1 egg and 1/4 cup eggbeaters; and I used only one cup white chocolate chips. Next time I am going to try substituting some applesauce for half the butter, if it works out, I'll let y'all know. As I said, these were still extremely yummy and a liiiittle bit better for you, I estimated it cut about 75 calories per cookie using the nutrition info provided.

I made these cookies twice.  My grown son demands them and doesn't want to share them with his wife.  I did follow some of the other reviews and cut down on the butter.  Great cookies.

Excellent, very sweet cookies. The dough is pretty dry and gave me a good arm workout! But it was worth it. I'll make it with chocolate chips next time.

Cookies were good! They remained very moist and chewy. The consistancy was good. I didn't add the pecons, which I think would have added additional flavor. Will try again.

I was completely weirded out by the texture of the cookie dough.  It looked more like sand with chinks than cookie dough.  I warmed up the dough in the microwave for about 1 minute and added 3 tbls. milk.  That helped along with a lot of kneading.  I pressed the dough inot cookie shapes and considering how weired this dough was to start out with the cookies looked and tasted really good!!!

These cookies were great! I do like my oatmeal cookies with a bit more oatmeal so I used 2 1/2 c. oatmeal, 1 c. white flour and 1 c. wheat flour. I split the dough into thirds and made one batch with chocolate chips, one with white chocolate chips and pecans, and one with white chocolate chips and dried cranberries. All of them turned out delicious, and a nice variety for everyone.

Yum, these are soooo good!  I halved the recipe (though still got 28 cookies), slightly increased the vanilla and left out the nuts.  I'd definitely make these again!

OMG! Theese are SO GOOD! I did not have any pecans, so I had to omitt them this time. The only wird thing about this recipe was that I felt I needed to add water. One cup of butter and the two eggs was not enough liquid for me.Other than that, and the fact that this recipe makes so many cookies I had to share with just about everybody I know, the recipe is great!

Awesome chewy cookie.  I use a Pampered Chef baking stone 'n have to start cooking them at about 12 min till the stone is staying hot then 10.  I'd rather undercook than overcook though.

Excellent cookies.  The look beautiful and have a nice flavor.  I made them white chocolate, macadamia nut, coconut cookies.  Next time I will use pecans because I think they add more flavor.  Regular chocolate chips would be great too.

Very easy and crowd pleasing - I used walnuts instead of pecans, and only 1/2 the chips about 3/4 cup dried cranberries.  Yum!  Great base recipe.

So far so good. Of course I made changes since I always have to for some reason.  I omittted 1/2 C white sugar and added 2 tbls corn syrup, added 1 tbls 1/2 & 1/2 (cream or milk will do fine).  This is a thick dough.  I added 1 cup of dried cranberries and omitted the nuts and lastly, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Next time I will add more cinnamon, these are really delicious!

This recipe was great!  I used macadamia nuts instead of pecans because my husband has been bugging me for some white chocolate/macadamia cookies.  The only thing was that they took around 16 minutes to bake.  I know that the directions say they are best when lightly browned, but they were still dough after only 12 minutes.

This is my first review after being on this site for years now.. but this is the one recipe I use over and over again. I change nothing but add up to a cup of chopped dried apricots..the combination of the white chocolate and fruit is just amazing! I have never had anyone turn down seconds, t hirds, on and on! Great cookie.

Pretty good, crisp on the outside & soft & chewy on the inside...although a bit "cakey". I did not find the dough sticky at all & I followed the recipe to a tee (except i used semi sweet choco chips). I baked them for 10 mins exactly. 
I don't see baking powder much in cookie recipes...is that what makes them have the cake consistency?

These are fabulous!  My 10 year old daughter and I are eating them straight out of the oven.  I left out the nuts because my kids don't care for them, but I am looking forward to trying this recipe with cranberries.  Yum!

These are delicious, but they're a bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll make with less sugar. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon sugar (was out of cinnamon) which added a nice hint of the flavor to the cookies.

This cookie was soooo good. I made it twice.  The first time I thought it was a little too sweet so in attempt to make it "healthier", I mixed the 2 cups of sugar and scooped out about 1/4 cup. It came out PERFECT that way.

I found this recipe yesterday and couldn't WAIT to try it! I was certainly not disappointed!! We are HUGE cookie fans in our house, and everyone (including the dog, with whom our 21 month old was kind enough to share with) loved them! We omitted the nuts because of the little ones, but followed the rest of the recipe. The cookies are soft, chewy, and sweet. They held their shape very well through the baking, too. I think we might make some mini ice-cream sandwiches with these cookies (if there are any left!). Thanks for the perfect recipe!

Everyone says I am the best cookie baker since I started using this recipe.  My advice is to also use the airbake cookie sheets and they come out like heaven.  I don't share this one much because I like the attention when I make them!

I chose this recipe to use the bag of white chocolate chips lurking in my cupboard. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 unbleached flour and added an additional 1/2 c. oatmeal. The cookies have the ultimate taste and texture. Changing chips, I will use this recipe rather than Toll House the next time I need a chocolate chip fix.

This recipe is a keeper.  I did some minor adjusting to it.  I reduced the amount of salt by half since I was using salted butter and I added almond and butter extracts.

I couldn't wait to eat these cookies as they were baking, and they were worth it...white chocolate is a perfect sweet for these! I used chopped walnuts in place of the pecans and those were good so maybe macadamia nuts next time! Addicting cookies...

This was really really good! I used regular semisweet choc. chips (because that's what i had) and only half of the required pecans (because i dont like too many nuts). They were easy to make and I'll probably make them again.

Very good cookies.  They didn't melt down flat, but came out cake-like.  Thanks! I'll make these again.

Delicious!  And u don't have to add as much sugar as the recipe states and it still tastes great!  I'm always looking for great ways to cut down on sugar.

This dough was great, but it was SO dry. And I added just under 3 cups of flour and omitted the oats and still I had to add a third egg and a splash of oil. Still, the dough came out with a great consistency afterwards and they're in the oven now. I've got a cup of milk waiting for them!

Great Cookie. I cut white sugar to 3/4 cup and would only use 1 cup of white chocolate chips (2 cups is to sweet) also added a half cup more pecans....they make the cookie. Almost forgot, used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shorting so that cookie would not get thin and they didn't.  Don't let mix scare you, it may see like its not going to stay together but press it together JUST A LITTLE  when making your cookie ball and it works great.  I used the metal cookie scoop from TARGET. Yum,Yum.

I've made these cookies several times, they are yummy!  I have also substituted 1 1/2 cups raisins and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon for the chocolate chips and pecans.  They were very good too.  Thank you Julie!!

YUM! Very, very good recipe.  I made three dozen yesterday, and they're already gone!  Not sure what went wrong with the person saying they weren't sweet enough?? They were plenty sweet, moist, chewy and just YUM!  Thanks!

I was very dissappointed with these cookies.  I thought they were too dry and not sweet enough.  I will not make these again.

This was a really fun change from plain chocolate chip cookies. They were very good, but didn't seem very sweet. I used rolled oats and this could have caused the flavor to change a bit. I would suggest using instant oats if you try this one!

These are great! I made them for a bake sale for the first time and was unsure how they would turn out, but they were a hit! I usually don't care for nuts in my cookies, but the pecans were the best part!

These cookies are yummy!  The only thing I disliked was they were a bit cakey however this could be fixed by deleting the Baking Soda and making sure the cookies are not too big.
