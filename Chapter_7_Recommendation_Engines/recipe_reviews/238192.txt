I had trouble with the dough being too sticky even though I tried to use a small amount of the milk.  I tried refrigerating the dough. I ended up rolling the dough between two sheets of waxed paper sprinkled with powdered sugar. When I baked the shortbread, even though I used parchment paper the bottom was very brown. After tasting the shortbread, it was like a biscuit.

This is a cross between a shortBREAD COOKIE and a shortCAKE BISCUIT.  I would have assumed this were a cookie recipe had it not been for the other review and the description mentioning "for strawberry shortcake or even peach shortcake."  So I made this for strawberry shortcakes.  The dough was so wet and sticky to work with that I just dropped it onto the bakesheet and formed it into circles.  Cooked up to little puffed, cakey cookies and tasted fine as well, but I think I'll stick with my usual shortbread recipe for cookies and usual biscuit recipe for shortcakes. Thanks for the try.

This is NOT a shortbread, but more of a biscuit.  Still, it was quite good; I added some lemon zest and juice and it gave them a bit more flavor. The dough is pretty sticky so you can't shape it all that much. Other than that and the naming of the recipe, nothing wrong with these biscuits.
