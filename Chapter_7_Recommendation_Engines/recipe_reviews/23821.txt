I liked the idea of the bell peppers, and particularly the suggestion to use a medley of colored peppers.  I chose not  to cook them first, and quite honestly, I don't think I'd have liked them cooked.  I didn't include the corn  out of consideration for Hubs' sensitive innards and, quite honestly, I think they were better for that omission anyway.  I reduced the amount of salt by half and since it was just right, I can only imagine these would have been too salty had I used the full amount.   I found I had to use a far greater amount of milk to get the dough to the correct consistency.  I have no idea why this was so far off.  Finally, 350 degrees is a little too moderate for biscuits.  I increased the temperature to the more conventional 425 degrees, and baked them about 12-15 minutes. (Time, of course, will depend on your oven and the size of the biscuits.  I dropped the dough by quarter cupfuls)  Once out of the oven I brushed them with melted butter to which I had added California garlic salt.  The biscuits baked up  nice and plump with a golden and somewhat crispy exterior.  You really do need that higher heat!  The mixed colors of the bell peppers made these confetti-like pretty, and the melted butter gave them a glossy  sheen and  a nice flavor from the garlic salt.  I liked  them a lot.  The ultimate result was that the bell pepper was a tasty and interesting addition but unfortunately that was not enough to redeem the recipe from the issues I've outlined.

Very tasty but way too salty. I did add a half teaspoon of sugar (I made a half batch) and used frozen corn. Next time I'll try them with about half or less of the salt. Also, took almost double the stated time to bake. Update: much better with half the salt! I added the sugar again this time, and when cooking the peppers, I threw the corn in there too. Turned the heat up and got a nice char on the veggies, it was very good :)

Instead of bell peppers try canned green chiles.  Mmmmm...  Since they are already cooked you don't even need to sautee them unless you want to do it quickly (to help incorporate the butter).

These southwest style biscuits are very good.  I added a teaspoon of sugar and they came out great.  Quite an odd name, but good nonetheless.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure if I made these right, but they came out ok. I had to add more milk, because the peppers and corn weren't mixing in. Then is was too sticky, so I had to add more flour. I used lactose free milk and cheese and they still tasted pretty good. My husband really likes them and suggested they need bits of cooked bacon and some tomato sauce. I would probably make these again, as they are a pretty easy biscuit recipe. Maybe, I was supposed to add spicy peppers.

I subbed spelt flour for the all-purpose flour, and added 1 tsp. poultry seasoning.  More milk was added due to the change in flour.  My family really liked these!

It is very delicious and a pretty simple and easy recipe, but the reason I am giving it four stars is because the recipe is wrong you need to cook it for more like twenty minutes.

These were fine as-is, but I wish I'd halved the recipe and subbed green chiles for the bell pepper as other reviewers had.  That would have taken these biscuits to a solid 4 stars.

These are truly delicious! I used gruyere cheese and a bit more corn-- also a little more milk to keep the mixture sticky enough. The cooking time is more like 18-20 minutes; just keep an eye on them and be sure you let them cook until golden.  They are so good with chili plus, you can store them in tupperware and reheat within three days.
