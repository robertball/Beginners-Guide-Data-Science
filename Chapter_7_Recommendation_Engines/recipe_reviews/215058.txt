No Mayo needed for this to be the BEST tzatziki sauce I swear!!! plus who needs the extra calories.  I added a bit of dill along w/ some lemon juice and a tiny bit of olive oil...maybe that was to make up for the mayo omission...either way worked GREAT! my bf cant wait for Gyros again!!!!

I grew up in Oceanside, Cali. where we would head to the boardwalk alot to get gyros. Moving to Ohio we have no greek deli close by. I've been searching for a long time to find a recipe for the cucumber sauce that is almost spot on to what I grew up on...I finally found it!...I recently grilled a beef brisket that I had rubbed in Greek seasoning to marinate all day. I had no idea what to do with leftovers and Gyros popped in my head. I finally found this recipe which I was sure might not be right. I read the other reviews and decided to try it...OMG!...I am in heaven!!...Only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of dried dill and that sealed the deal. I might not add the mayo next time and maybe add more sour cream in place of the mayo. Mayo didn't do much for me....I am so Happy to have found this recipe even if it's not the real thing. Sure tastes like it. I'm addicted now and I find myself adding it to everything.

Delicious and authentic tasting! As most others did, I too, omitted the mayo. I used low-fat Greek yogurt and light sour cream and you never would have known. The addition of dill is a necessity. I used a paper towel to strain the cucumber and then I squeezed some of the juice back into the mixture because the towel certainly soaks up a majority. Added a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, lemon juice and olive oil. It had a strong yogurt odor so I was afraid the taste would lack, but boy was I wrong! I do recommend refrigerating several hours prior to serving in order for the minced garlic to permeate the yogurt. FYI- it will appear curdled even though it is not. This is due to the cucumber being processed. For a more aesthetically pleasing sauce, shred the cucumber with a cheese grater. Fabulous find, thank you!

This sauce is wonderful - I used a 2% greek yogurt, grated my cucumber by hand, strained it by wrapping the pulp in a simple paper towel squeezing a little.  Used a little less garlic, but everything came out really well.  It good with the falafel, and would make a great gyro sauce too!

My cuke was really big. I cut it in half and scooped out all the innards before chunking it up. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a tablespoon of lemon juice and a good handful of a good quality feta cheese. This was okay--I think the mayo was out of place but it was still tasty.

This is an awesome recipe to start from. I omitted the mayo and added dill, lemon and cavender's greek seasoning. I also used fat free yogurt that I drained using a strainer and a coffee filter. It's a great way to pinch a few pennies and calories off of this great sauce. This is excellent paired up with pepperocini beef (on this site). I changed that recipe by piercing a london broil and sticking sliced garlic inside. I also rubbed with Cavender's and let it sit overnight before cooking.
btw- the sauce is sooo much better when you allow it to sit overnight. So prepare the sauce when you rub the broil and start the crockpot first thing in the morning. It is worth every minute of prep.
Speaking of prep... I couldn't find the lid of my food processor so I just chopped the cucumber as fine as possible. I think I like the texture more than when I used the FP.

This is very tastey!  I made it with fat free yogurt, fat free sour cream, and fat free mayo and it still turned out delicious. I am planning on using it tonight on feta turkey burgers.

I skipped the mayo, excluded salt and added dill, garlic powder and onion powder instead.  This was soooo good, and very easy.  I used it on chicken pitas.  Everyone loved it!

I made this last night to drizzle onto lamb kabobs tonight. I deseeded my cucumber, then shredded it, added my minced garlic, 2 cups of the best Greek yogurt on the market in the US, omitted the sour cream and the mayo (never had it in Greece), salt & pepper.  Then tasted it, my adjustments were; the juice of two small lemons that were languishing in the fridge, 1 teaspoon Greek Seasoning (Penzeys), 1 TBS dried dill, 1 TBS fresh minced mint. Then since I didn't care for the consistency of the shredded cucumber, I dumped the whole thing in my processor and processed for about a minute, tasted it again, I was almost there!  So I turned on the processor another minute and drizzled my favorite peppery olive oil while running.  It was perfect and the consistency was more to my liking.

I made this recipe almost to the letter except I left out the mayo to save on the extra calories that I thought might not be necessary.  It was FANTASTIC!  So good!  There are two keys to this recipe: First, getting step #1 right.  You want to drain off the moisture without losing all the flavor, as it says.  I used a handheld strainer and pressed the liquid into a bowl.  Good thing I did because I did end up draining out too much flavor.  I just poured a little of the juice back into my sauce to get that fresh cucumber flavor.  The other key is to get your salt/pepper right.  It will probably require a little more salt than you might think, so add a little until it tastes just right!

very good, tastes pretty close to the resturants tzatziki sauce. I did what others did and didn't add the mayo but after tasting it, it really just tasted like sour cream, after adding the mayo the flavor was spot on..I wouldn't change a thing about this except for the serving size, I scaled it to 10 ( but I'm only feeding 4 people) and I added chives for some color. Excellent recipe, thanks!!

So good! I don't have a food processor, so I grated the cucumber with the fine side of my grater. I also thought I had garlic, but I did not, so I used garlic powder. Omitted the mayo as per previous reviews and added some dried dill. Still came out restaurant worthy.

OH NO! I rated it with a 1, not the 5 I intended. Here is my correct rating.

Oh my lord this was FANTASTIC! I had to force myself to stop eating it before I served dinner so that we had enough for dinner!

I read through the reviews and really didn't change that much. I strained my cucumber through a paper towel, I added garlic powder not raw garlic, I used the mayo (but really didn't need to), I also added a generous helping of dried dill (I love this stuff), and an extra splash of lemon juice. My husband, who doesn't care for cucumbers at all..gobbled this up. I'm ready to make more and use it in a chicken wrap now! Thanks for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

Hi, I made this recipe and I just wanted to say that I wasn't intending to replicate or copy authentic Tzatziki. I wanted a creamier version of Tzatziki, that is what this is. I also wanted to amend how much mayo I put in it, it is more like a tsp. to a tbsp., if mayo isn't your thing then just don't put it in and maybe add a tad more salt. Otherwise, try it with the mayo, you just might be pleasantly surprised:)

This was really good. I omitted the mayo and added some fresh dill. I also squeezed as much liquid out of the cucumbers as I could. I would definitely recommend doing that because a lot of  liquid came out of it.

This is a good recipe, and really doesnt need mayo. I always add some dill and a little mint, and just a hint of lemon to achieve a true tzatziki.

Great recipe, but I added an extra clove of garlic and omitted the mayo.  As another reviewer says, you need a significant amount of salt.  Next time, I may add some pulsed carrots too for color.

Made this as written and it was pretty good.  I halved the recipe and used only one heaping teaspoon of mayo.  It was good, but lacked the depth I was looking for, so I added the juice of 1/2 lemon and finely grated the peel - then added 1/4t. crushed seasoning called "Deliciously Dill" (dried mix of onion, dill, lemon peel, ginger, garlic, chives) and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!  I was looking for something authentic and this is as close as I found.  Not 100% on the mayo yet though, but we'll see after another night in the fridge.

Yum in a huge way! I've made this a number of times now, and though I am a mayo lover, I leave it out of this recipe now. It tastes much more fresh and light without it. I have also taken to adding some lemon juice and a touch of olive oil. Grating versus food processor for the cucumber - the processor seems to result in a finer texture so it depends on what you like for texture. Lastly, I place the prepared cucumber in a mesh strainer, and let it rest over a bowl. Sometimes I press the cucumber lightly, but most of the time it is just right without having to add any of the cucumber juice back into the mixture. Thanks for the recipe – it’s a keeper!

I think this is the best tzatziki I've tasted.  The Greek yogurt makes it very creamy and smooth.  it seems curdled, but that is just the cucumber.  Yummy!

Really good and thick, delicious sauce made as written, but makes a really great base recipe as well. I like it with lots and lots of extra garlic and dill while omitting the mayo, personally.

This was REALLY good. I left out the mayonnaise because I felt it was unnecessary (hence the deduction of one star, as I think it's quite good without the extra fat and sodium). It reminded me of Indian raita and tasted similar to the tzatziki served at my favorite Greek restaurant.

Great recipe, I make it very similar to this, I don't use mayo, but I do add dill and a squeeze of lemon juice, which adds a nice burst of freshness.

I made this, not looking for a Tzatziki sauce, but something light and refreshing to pair with seasoned chicken breast on a wrap. I omitted both the mayo and the sour cream as they really rack in the calories. What I ended up with was a delicious, different sauce that I will continue to make for dipping veggies and chicken wraps.

I made this recipe this evening.  It only took me 10 min as I had already peeled, cut and chilled the cukes. After processing them and mixing them with the other ingredients I put them back in the fridge to marry the flavors before dinner.  After 2 hrs .yummmm

I made this to go on homemade gyros and it was an absolute hit. Added about 4 cloves of garlic (2 just seemed too few and mine was starting to dry out) and it turned out perfect. I recommend a healthy serving of fresh dill as well to make it the best tzatziki I've ever had.

Amazing sauce!!  I omitted mayo but no other changes.  Just a tip, I just dumped the cucumber onto some layered paper towels and let it sit for maybe 5 minutes and it drained just fine.  I used this sauce with the kafta recipe on here to make "gyros" with pitas, spinach and tomato.  Very yummy!

Loved this basic recipe.  Didn't follow it exactly, so can't really give it 5 stars.  Did not use mayo and added dried dill and garlic.  Delish on meat, as dip, even added a dollop on my chili.  Very good and fresh tasting.

DELICIOUS. Like many others, I left out the mayo, and I used slightly less than a cup of Greek Yogurt (it's what I had on hand...) and light Sour Cream. I didn't add dill because we're eating these with chickpea and red pepper patties, so I'm leaving it a bit plain so the patties will shine in whole wheat pitas. Next time I make true falafel, though, I will be adding dill. Super easy to make and YUMMY!!

This is a great base recipe and I am so grateful that it was posted because I didn't have a clue as to how to get started.  I gave it 4 stars just as it is.  But I realize that tzatziki has many variations and I then attempted to replicate my favorite restaurant's tzatziki using Molly's recipe.  I  did as the recipe suggests and then just added some seasonings: 2 T fresh squeezed lemon juice,  2t  dried dill weed, 1/4 t salt, 2 dashes black pepper, 1 to 1.5t Greek seasoning, 1/2 t onion powder, and 2-3 cloves of fresh garlic (minced).    I am beyond thrilled with the outcome.

I've made this quite a few times. I add dill and some lemon. I usually add about half the mayo if any. Sometimes a little olive oil instead.

So I had some gyro flavored hotdogs and I needed a good tzatziki sauce. I'm glad I found this one. I did make some changes due to the fact that I didnt have Greek yogurt so no to that and added half a lemon a tbsp of olive oil & 3 garlic cloves. Delicious!

A solid tzatziki that is easy to make. Can be taken to the next level by adding a bit of dill, bit more garlic, ditching the mayo and adding olive oil and a bit of lemon juice. Will definitely make it again!

I used this as a base.  I did not add mayo or sour cream. Because I did not have cheesecloth,I just dumped the whole thing in.   It tasted pretty good  to me.

I will not use the mayo next time. It overpowered to the point I had to add more sour cream. Also, a "large cucumber" means different things to different people. I used a thick, 11 inch cucumber and since didn't have cheesecloth used a 4-sided gater to shred the solid parts of the cumber. I drained off some but not all the juice.

I made it exactly as described. Some people mention skipping the mayo but I think the mayo helps thicken it up. I cubed the cucumber and blended it in my nutri bullet, I did not have to strain it. Came out perfect, better than what I've tried at Greek restaurants.

With a recipe that starts with Molly's ......., how could I not try this recipe?  This was a very flavorful tzatziki recipe to use on our meatball pita's tonight.  I made as written, only making a half batch.  I drained the cucumber for about 30 minutes before adding it to the other ingredients.  The flavor was there, I just wish my consistency was a little thicker.  Served this with - 'Mediterranean Beef Meatball Kabob', 'Mediterranean Snow Peas' and 'Grilled Corn Salad' - all from AR.

This was ok, especially after sitting in the fridge for two days, but it needed more cucumber, less mayo, and a bit of dill.

Followed recipe exactly with the exception of adding 1/2 more cucumber. When first making it I added everything together EXCEPT for the garlic. I tasted it and it didn't taste right. I thought maybe some more salt and pepper but that didn't do it either. I asked my husband to taste it and he said it needed the garlic. I kind of rolled my eyes thinking the garlic wasn't going to make that much of a difference. HOLY SMOKES was I wrong. The 2 cloves garlic made EVERY bit of difference. I think this would be better too if made the day before so the flavors have time to blend. Already made up a recipe card for this! Thank you!

This sauce was really good and will be great for sandwiches! I used a blendtec to make the sauce and it made it perfectly. It's much better if its cold and I wouldn't leave it at room temperature for too long.

Very good, and a much creamier tzatziki than my old recipe. Think I'll be sticking with this one though. First thing, this one is super easy. My old recipe called for the yogurt to be strained through cheesecloth and the cucumber to be shredded by hand. Simple changes make a difference in the ease, and I don't feel like I lost any flavor by taking this easier route. I had also never considered using another dairy other than just the yogurt. I used the greek yogurt and light sour cream and it worked perfectly. Skipped the mayo, used garlic powder instead of minced, and added dried dill & fresh lemon juice. Will definitely make this tzatziki again, we thought it was great.

I used the mayo once, but didn't use it ever again (not because I didn't like it, but because I didn't notice much of an improvement).  I use a bit more sour cream to make up for it.  I also don't put the cucumber in the food processor.  I peel it, cut it lengthwise and then scoop out the seeds.  Then I dice it up into small chunks.  I LOVE this tzatziki.  It is GREAT!  Better than most gyro places I go to.  I pair it up on some flour tortillas with the Haitian Voodoo Sticks (from this site).

This came out great very flavorful. Best if left to sit in fridge overnight develops much more flavor. We ate this with fish tacos

This was a very good sauce. The only thing I did was add dill. They do not sell Greek yogurt in Peru so I used Gloria fat free yogurt instead came out really good. I will be using this sauce a lot.

This was a good base recipe...but I thought something was missing so I added white vinegar & lemon juice and it turned out very good! It could have been thicker but I used regular plain yogurt instead of Greek yogurt which has a thicker consistency. Will make again.  And I used the cups that come with the Magic Bullet & it was full so this makes ALOT. Next time I will only make 1/4 of this.
