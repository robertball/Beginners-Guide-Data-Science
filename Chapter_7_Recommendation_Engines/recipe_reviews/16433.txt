Very tasty and easy to make! I did,however,added my own touches after reading the reviews. While browning the ground beef,I added a clove of chopped garlic and generous dashes of fresh ground pepper.  I also added garlic salt and a dash of milk,in addition to the sour cream to ensure creaminess.  Not a gourmet meal, but delicious for a quick and economical meal on those nights you don't want to do the usual with ground beef! Thank you!

This recipe was well received by my family. However, I have some comments. I see no need for the flour as we are not trying to thicken anything,(the soup is condensed and quite thick enough.) I also see no need to wait 20 minutes for it to heat up,5 maybe. If you cook the noodles at the same time there is no need to set aside and wait- just eat!

I thought this was a good base, and with the changes I made would give it 4 stars.  First, I added a small can of mushrooms to the last few minutes of frying the beef.  I drained the beef/onion mixture of the grease to lower the fat content.  I skipped the flour as it seemed like it would probably be think enough.  Along with the salt, I probably added a half tsp of pepper and a half tsp of garlic powder. When I added the soup, I also added a cup of beef broth and about a tbs of worchestshire.  The leftovers still look thick, so I think I'll add some milk to thin them out.  Thanks for a great start!

Wow!  My 4 yr old had FOURTHS of this!  This is the kid who has never had more than seconds of ANYthing!  My 2 1/2 yr old actually ate some - another first!  My 11 mo. old twins chowed down on this - they couldn't get enough!  And ... get this - my teenager COMPLIMENTED me on it! Even my husband insisted that we have it again - soon! I would rate this 12 stars if I could.  I made a few changes, though.  I cooked 2 1/2 lbs ground beef with 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic, minced. While that simmered, I mixed 3 cans of cream of mushroom with 1 16 oz container of sour cream, 1 can milk, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 1/2 tsp salt in a bowl.  When the ground beef was done, I mixed the sauce in and simmered for 10 - 15 min or so.  I served it over rice.

This has the beginnings of a great meal. If I hadn't had to adjust it, I would have given a higher rating. I had to add 1 c water and a beef bouillon cube as the sauce was too thick and then added another 1/2 c milk for the same reason. I cooked the meat with 2T dried minced onion plus 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/4 tsp garlic salt, then left the rest of the salt out. I let this cook on simmer/lo for thirty min and it turned very very creamy and had a nice flavor. The extra liquid was necessary though or this is just simply too thick. Nice dish overall after thinning the sauce. I served this over buttered parsley egg noodles. Hubby loved this, it's his favorite dish. Thanks, this turned out very nice after all.

This was very good! I didn't use flour and I added some milk to thin it out a bit. What a yummy dish on a night without much time.

I am sorry but this is not a recipe I would ever make again. The sauce turns out like a glue paste and doesn't have much flavor. Let alone the fact that my fiance' thought it looked like cow brains!  
I will give it this: it is very in expensive.
Thanks Anyways

I loved this recipe.  I tweeked it a bit after trying the original recipe which was good but I wanted a little more spice.  the thing I did was change the beef to sweet Italian sausage (bob evans), added onions and a half tsp minced garlic.  Then I omitted the soup because it was too fattening and too salty.  I used the sour cream and added flour for thickening.  (this worked well).  I used the paprika and added a tsp of basil.  This was tastier than the original recipe.  I omited all the sausage/onion grease except for one tbs.  This added additional flavor without the fat.  My family ate both recipes and preferred the second version.  It was a big hit.  I made a caesar salad withh it and dinner was complete.

I made this for dinner tonight for my picky family. I didn't add the paprika, since I didn't have any and instead of hamburger I used pre-cooked meatballs ( that I already had in the freezer) I heated up the meatballs and then sauteed a tiny bit of fresh onion with them before I added them to the sauce. I also added a tiny dash of salt and pepper and 5 drops of worstershire sauce. I mixed it with egg noodles, kind of like a swedish meatball/stroganoff type meal. Every one just loved it. :)

Made this tonight for dinner and loved it. I did do a few things different. I doubled the recipe and added 2 cans of mushrooms to the meat and onions when they were almost done. I also added black pepper to the sauce and milk to thin it out. I used egg noodles instead as well.

Yum!  I only had cream of chicken soup on hand (no cream of mushroom) so I used that - gave it kind of a strange flavor with the beef at first, but next day was delicious!  Can't wait to try as written!

This has a good taste, but dry. (You can't pour it- you just have to place it on the noodles.) Next time I will add milk to loosen it up. Like the other reviewer said, no need to cook 20 min. Mine started to burn a little on the bottom after 10 min on med heat. We also used bowties instead of macaroni.

Made a few adjustments, but a great base. 
I used chicken instead of beef, added green onions instead, some Riesling and more paprika and chopped Portobello mushrooms.    And it turned out excellent for me, thanks for sharing your recipe. :)

Here is what I did. I added garlic powder to the meat while cooking like most other reviews, drained the meat, added a little water and flour to make a roux, added two cans of cream of mushroom soup, and 1 cup of sour cream. 
Once I cooked the noodles I needed to add a little more milk to make it creamy.

This is cheap, easy and good. It doesn't look great, but it is filling, and if you double the recipe, you can eat leftovers for a few days (reheats in the microwave very well). Hubby gives it a big thumbs up, too, and requests it :) Edit: Just made this for about the 5th time, and should add that if it's just two of you, no need to double the recipe - it makes plenty! Also, like others, I don't use the flour, it's thick enough without it :D

This was really good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added garlic, and worchestshire.  I am not a fan of sour cream, so I did half a cup, and then added half a cup of milk.  It was very quick and easy which I love.  I did use the flour, which I think was necessary because I think it would have been too thin without it.  I will definately make again!

Changes I made. Used a bag of frozen swedish meatballs instead of ground beef, 6 oz. can of sliced mushrooms. 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, some evap milk to thin out some, and chopped 2 cloves of garlic. Made this in under 30 min. after a hard day at wok. Delicious. Especially with a salad and some crusty bread.

For something quick and easy this is a winner, I'm a garlic addict so of course extra garlic added.

Great recipe if you want something fast and simple.  I started the water cooking and then started frying the meat and onions.  I followed the recipe but had a few changes.  My kids do not like sour cream so I used cream instead.  when the noodles were cooked I just added the sauce to the noodles for easy service. We had to add more salt and since I love pepper I had to add pepper.  For a crunch my kids added fried onions.

I usually don't rate recipes unless I prepare them exactly as written but I had to comment on this one. First of all, I was disturbed by the amount of grease this produced and you don't drain it off. I couldn't help myself... I was scooping it off (and this was AFTER the soup, flour, and seasonings were added). Like other reviewers I added some garlic powder and also some beef base. When the sour cream was added I was relieved because the grease was gone and it looked and tasted like stroganoff should. I don't think I'll make this one again but thanks for submitting it!

Killer!  Everything is better with garlic, so of course I add some minced garlic when browning the beef, but that is the only change I made, other than omitting the onions and mushrooms as per my husband's request.  Definitely a keeper!

This simple recipe has a great base to work with.  After reading several reviews, I took the advice of Not adding flour to avoid over thickening the sauce.  I also added fresh minced garlic to the browning meat and milk to give the sauce a more creamy texture. I Buttered the noodles and tossed in fresh chopped parsley.  I sprinkled fresh parmesan over the top before serving, the kids all had seconds!

This had a great flavor to it and was very quick to make. I added some extra sour cream and stirred in uncooked rice instead of the pasta. And it definitely needed pepper!

Loved this cause it was fast. Family likes it. I did change it up a little like the rest. The onion soup mix is a 
MUST!!! and just touch it up with garlic and worcestershire cooked with the meat is a M{UST!!! I also added some season salt. It was great!!!!!

I didn't have sour cream so I did what I could with what I had...I thickened 1 cup of milk with about 1 tbsp of cornstarch in place of the sour cream.  I omitted the flour and added some worcestershire and a bit of garlic powder.  Pretty tasty.  Will make again.

We didn't care for this recipe the hamburger helper is much better. All I could taste was sour cream. I added milk also because it was to thick.

I didn't give it 5 stars because as is it is very bland.  But I followed advice of other reviewers and added garlic and onion when I was cooking the meat, and added worshister (sp?) sauce, beef broth and a little cooking wine to the sauce.  It was awesome!  My 9 yr old kept raving about how great it was!  Super easy and super fast.

I was convinced my kids would take one look at this and refuse to eat it, but they actually liked it. I had a bigger soup-to-beef ratio, and I added a little red wine and black pepper. I served it over radiatore (because that's my youngest picked at the store). I also omitted the flour and cut the time more than in half. I don't like investing a lot of time into recipes when it's just the kids and me, in case they don't like it, but this wass both easy and tasty.

Not too shabby.  I peppered it quite a bit during the eating process, because I'm a pepper fiend, and it seemed like it could use a bit of a kick.  We'll probably end up eating it again, but I don't see this one becoming a weekly menu item.

This recipe was super simple and pretty darn tasty!  Everyone at the table loved it (which is VERY unusual at my house!) the only comment was that it was a bit too creamy.  I reduced the amount of sour cream a little, I think next time I will use only about half that is called for and substutute some milk in it's place.

I knew that I wanted a quick & easy stroganoff recipe for dinner tonight.  This was the first recipe that popped in my search and I'm glad that it did.  I added a little milk and made a roux before adding the ground beef back in, and then added more milk after adding the meat and cream of mushroom soup to get it to the consistency that I wanted.  This was absolutely yummilicious!  My family said that I could add it into the regular rotation, which is high praise. I served it over egg noodles. Next time, I think I'll use sherry in the roux then add milk to add a little more depth of flavor.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I thought this was a really good recipe. My family asked what I did differently and they all said they really like it. I used golden cream of mushroom soup and smoked paprika and didn't use any flour.

Very good! My husband and I were both impressed with the great taste! I add a little mustard and garlic powder along with the paprika suggested here and it turns out just wonderfully! I also use light sour cream and sometimes I don't use the flour, I just drain the fat from the beef after cooking. Overall really good though!

This was a good basic recipe.  I went pretty much exactly as the recipe said and added 1/4 tsp of fresh ground black pepper and about 1/2 tsp of fresh minced rosemary.  My little girl gobbled it up.  I did use 85/15 ground turkey instead of beef.  Will try again with maybe freshly sauteed mushrooms.  Yum!

very good basic recipe that is easy to "bounce off of".  Having said that, I actually didn't stray too far!  Didn't have cream of  anything soup on hand, so i followed another recipe for cream of mushroom soup http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13096/cream-of-mushroom-soup-i/   
. I needed to disguise a can of mushrooms from my phobic 10 year old, so put them along with half an onion in the blender, then made my roux, etc.. for the soup. Back to this recipe: added thyme, celery flakes, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt, and chopped fresh carrot for color.  very happy with the results.  My son will be thrilled and never know what he's eating ;)  !!! Thanks for posting this!

As is, this recipe is 1 star, but with adjustments it could be a 4 star, thus the 2 star rating.  I started making as written, but realized that the sauce wouldn't have worked out the way it is.  In the end I couldn't tell you how much milk I added to the sauce, I just kept adding it as the sauce thickened.  My family enjoyed it, but I think I'll look for another stroganoff recipe that doesn't need tweeking so much.

It's big hit in my house hold. Especially for my picky eater. It's super easy to make. Which is a plus, also a mom to a mobile 9 month old. Instead of using macaroni like the recipe requests. I used bow tie noodles-which worked even better. Again super easy and highly recommend.

I really liked this.  It was quick and easy.  I only had 1/4 cup sour cream so I added some half n half and about 2 oz of cream cheese.  It was a little thick with the changes but it tasted really good.

The first time i made this i followed the recipe exactly and it came out WAY too thick  this time I followed other reviews and added minced garlic while browning the meat, 1/2 cup milk and 3/4 cup beef broth added when I put in the soup. Came out creamy and not to thick. I omitted the flour all together.

Not too bad, I dont think the flour is needed, it made it taste a little funny. Also needs a little more seasoning, something in addition to the paprika - not sure what yet.

I tweeked this a little bit. I used a lean ground beef, fat free sour cream and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. I also used scallions instead of onions and it turned out wonderful. 

We also used organic noodles

The recipe had to be modified.  I made a vegetarian version.  My onions were rotten so I skipped the onion(regrettably).  In a pan I sautéed about 1/3 cup fresh dill chopped coarsely, sliced mushrooms, in some coconut oil.  I added a few table spoons of both garlic and onion powder it made a kinda paste.  I then added the soup.  Simmered for a few until I realized it was glue.  Then I added morning star crumbles.  It was still glue so I added 1 cup pasta water and transferred the whole mixture into a medium sized soup pot. I let it simmer till I liked the texture( like a thick soup).  Then I added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire and 1/2 cup minced mushroom.  Then I cooled it a bit and folded in the sour cream.  It was great.  I think it needs that onion to be awesome.

Very easy and simple.  I did add some garlic salt, black pepper and a touch of Italian seasoning but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Other reviewers mentioned a gluey/pastey sauce but the only time mine got that way was when it cooled, which is to be expected.  Upon reheating some milk may need to be added to help "freshen and soften the sauce" but other than that I thought this was great and so did my 4 yr. old.

I knew my husband would like this but did not expect such rave reviews from my 6 year old daughter. She loved it and I was so pleased! I made it pretty much as is, but I realized as I was cooking that I was out of paprika. I will be sure to add that next time. (I didn't eat it, as I am a vegetarian, but am rating based on my family's responses.)

This is such an easy, tasty stroganoff recipe! I didn't have any mushroom soup on hand, so I used Cream of Chicken instead. It turned out very well! I also cut the sour cream down to 3/4 cup...the full cup seemed a bit excessive. The stroganoff was still very creamy and tasty...no one noticed that there was less sour cream! Thanks so much for sharing, my family really liked this!

This was pretty good for a quick and easy stroganoff, and I only made a couple changes. I added 2 cream of mushrooms soups and a can of mushrooms, and while I was cooking the beef I added some seasongs, garlic and onion powder and a dash of red pepper, and I didn't add paprika, I didn't have any. Thanks Sal! I will make this again.

Loved this recipe.  I took some of the suggestions from the other reviews and added worchester and garlic to the beef and onion mix and added a few beef bouillon cubes and some milk to the sauce once I added the soup and sour cream.  Very easy and flavorful.  My husband who hates pasta even loved it.

I hate giving mediocre reviews but..

That's what this recipe was to me. It was good but more work than a box of hamburger helper and IMO not that much better. I will keep this recipe around in case I have these ingredients on hand I dont want to cook something complicated.

During browning, I seasoned the beef with worcestershire sauce.  I was out of sour cream so I used french onion dip and left out the onion from the recipe.  I also left out the flour and added milk for creaminess.  Excellent recipe, my husband loved it!

Ok, but not great. A very basic recipe. I added some mushrooms, extra spices and a couple of beef boullion cubes to liven it up a bit. Will keep searching.

this recipe produced pretty edible food, but it was a litle bland, and a little dry.  i like my stroganoff saucy, so i would maybe add some milk, ground black pepper, and garlic and mushrooms.

Not a bad topping for noodles, but not what I think of when I think of Stroganoff.  It's very messy so that explains the low kid friendly rating.  I might try this again but I will spice it up and make sure to add some tomatoes.

My hubby scarfed this one down!  I thought it was really good also.  Not as creamy as I would have liked it, but next time (and there will be a next time!) I will add more sour cream and Cream of mushroom soup.  This will become a regular on our table!

I sautéed onion and mushrooms with my ground beef and added a few splashes of Worcestershire. I had one knorrs home style beef bouillon left, so tossed that in with the soup and sour cream.  Forgot paprika. Tossed frozen peas in at the end. Served over rice. Very easy and quick for a week night meal! Thanks Sal!

Good recipe but needs more seasoning. To me it’s bland as listed but a good start. I added real sliced mushrooms as well. More salt and lots of pepper. Probably triple the amount of paprika. And a teaspoon of garlic powder. Added water as needed to keep it a bit loose to be more saucelike over the pasta. Oh and some parsley. Then it had lots of flavor. Will make again!

My husband loves beef stroganoff and since I don't eat mammals he rarely gets it.  This was easy for me to make and even easier for him to eat.  If this was a regular menu item in our home, I would substitute healthier / more low fat options, but as is, this was a great tasting part of his dinner and really quick for me to whip up for him.

There is no way you can add flour to the condensed cream of mushroom soup and simmer for 20 minutes. It’s so thick, you will scorch it. I added water to keep the moisture in the pan. Also added fresh garlic and pepper.

I used the flour but I didn't drain the beef. I think that's the trick if you're going to use the flour. I also added some garlic powder and onion powder to help boost the flavor. It's pretty tasty

Replaced ground beef with cubed beef (chuck) and fresh mushrooms and of course some fresh chopped garlic. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley. Try with cubed veal for a decadent change.!

This is absolutely delicious! It reminds me of the Stroganoff my mom made as a kid.  The only thing I did different is I add about 1/4 pkg of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of water, and 2 beef bouillon cubes. Definitely a keeper and will be making this again soon.

Good recipe, have made this for years! My family loves it and it’s easy and quick to make! We add rice instead of noodles, just our preference!

Admittedly, I made quite a few changes based on the others' reviews before I tried it and was quite happy.  It was primarily from scratch hamburger helper with some more flavor!  Added worcestershire, some marsala cooking wine (unsure amount on those two, sorry), fresh garlic, pepper, full can of beef broth.  (I did not need milk/flour, but I assume that amount of broth solved the others' problems there).  It was still the right cream/texture with this change. Had bowtie pasta on hand.  My recommendation is to use as a base, and add your own touch when tasting as you go.

I used freeze dried beef and it turned out good. I usually do my own sauce but I had to use what I had so this recipe was perfect.

This is meant to be a quick easy recipe and with that said I can say I only made a couple changes.  I did drain off the liquid fat from the beef and I didn't add a full cup of sour cream (not a mega fan of that much sour cream).  I added some garlic powder to add a bit of garlic flavor.  The rest was followed to a T including the flour.  The taste was great.  It was quick and easy.  I did cook the noodles at the end of the cooking process of the beef mixture and the timing was perfect.  Great taste and eating within half an hour which is great for this working woman!   Definitely will make again!

This is really yummy. I made 3 edits:

1) adding 1/2 cup of
milk when I add the soup
2) put it over brown rice instead of macaroni for some fiber and
3) I used ground turkey instead of beef. 

It comes out great.

I used egg noodles with a little butter and bread crumbs. Then I doubled the recipe excluding the flour adding some milk, extra salt, pepper, paprika, and another can of mushroom soup. I fried up a whole package of sausage and sliced it up and mixed it in. Everyone loved it!

In the 1970's I worked at a restaurant in the Marshall Field's Store in Chicago. They originated the recipe for Hamburger Stroganoff. You use cream of chicken soup, not cream of mushroom and need to include sliced fresh mushrooms. Also season with salt, pepper and garlic. I also add a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Cook your ground beef first, drain grease and set aside. In butter, cook your mushrooms and onions, then add a little flour to absorb the juices. Add soup and add back ground beef, cover and simmer 5-10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream or it will separate. Also great as an open face sandwich over hamburger buns.

Great recipe! Slight changes I made: add pepper, salt & garlic to meat while browning, then drain. I added 2 cans of soup with about 1/2C water, beef bouillon cube & 1/2C milk. I like more sauce than meat, personal preference. Thanks for what I'm sure will be a new favorite!!

Very very tasty! Cooked it for my pot luck at work and had a few compliments. Instead of using cream though I would suggest using sour cream mixed with small curd cottage cheese. Sounds a little crazy but itll give it a smoother and more creamy taste. Also I like using a half stick of butter to mix in with it, itll keep if from making that glue like paste. If you want to spice it up a bit a used tomato bisque soup mixed with franks hot sauce since I put that  on everything, the tomato bisque will tenderize the meat to perfection and you cant even taste it in the end result. Another thing I would like to add is packing some artichoke hearts in there then baking the stroganoff for 15 min on 450, itll give it a very tasty crust which makes the meal a ton better! Happy cooking, this recipe is a family recipe passed on by my grandmother, its very tasty!

Made some changes of course.  Sautéed beef tips in small amount of olive oil and did not drain.  After adding flour and other ingredients had to add touch of milk and it really made a nice gravy.  Added less sour cream.  Also added small amount of fresh  mushrooms.  Really good and quick!

This was a good basic recipe. I prefer chicken stroganoff but this was a nice change. I added a spoonful of cream cheese for an extra punch of flavor. Also took other suggestions and added Worcestershire sauce to the beef while it was cooking. I also did need a splash of milk to thin it out. Good, simple dinner that I will make again.

I've been making this since I first learned to cook.  I'm not telling how long ago that was.  I usually add garlic and don't add the flour.  It's not needed.  You can also add dill weed, which gives it a nice flavor.

This recipe is AWESOME! I made a double batch, added equal onion amounts of bell pepper and celery. I also substituted 1 can cream of celery soup. This is a hubby approved KEEPER! for my recipe box. He loved it with his favorite noodles but did however suggest that the next time I make it, to replace the noodles with an equal amount of small sliced potatoes.

Easy, fast and delicious!  I added Worchestershire sauce and used ground pork.  Hubby loved it!  1000x better than hamburger helper, lol!  I agree with some of the reviews, the sauce can be a little too thick so using a little milk would be best.

I made this without the four and mushroom sauce. Instead of mushroom sauce I used beef gravy. Everything else I kept exactly the same. Yum!!

Great to make in a crock pot! On high for 3-4 hours. But make noodles separate and add sour cream right before serving. Everyone liked it, except my tween who didn't eat because of the look of it.

Turned out Great! I did not add flour and it was not missed. I did add 1/2 a can of milk because it seemed too thick.My husband had 2nds and that never happens. This will go on our quick meal list.

This recipe was pretty bland.  I tried spicing it up a bit with some garlic and Worcestershire sauce, but it still lacked in flavor.  Maybe a step up from Hamburger Helper, but not much.  Husband liked it okay, as did my son, but I was not impressed.

I thought this was wonderful even though I made some changes. I always make changes since I don't always like some of the spices or ingredients. Doesn't mean the recipe's bad, just that i prefer something else. I added chopped mushrooms to the onions and cooked them before adding vegetarian burger crumbles. Left out the flour and used the usual spices (garlic salt,oregeno and pepper)and added the soup and sour cream. Used elbow macaroni and added to the mixture and let sit so the macaroni would absorb the flavor. Easy and very tasty. Thank you.

This was a simple, quick recipe that my one year old and I really enjoyed.  This comforting recipe reminded me of the stroganoff my grandmother used to make.  Thank you for sharing!  The only changes I made was to add about a 1/4 cup milk to thin it out a little and I used egg noodles.

Love how easy this is, but do leave the flour out, and definitely add fresh minced garlic and worshershire (sp?). I actually also added about a 1/4 of a cup of white wine which I think really helped. I served it over rice. If you want something quick and easy, this is it!

I make a similar version with just the beef, onion and mushroom soup, but I use Kraft mac-n-cheese and stir the cheese in with the soup to make the sauce.

This one is a good family staple. My husband and two year old both really liked it. I added a little over a teaspoon of beef bouillon granules to boost the flavor, as well as a few dashes of pepper. A good busy night recipe.

I thought the base of this recipe was good.  I used 2 cans of soup, because I thought there was too much meat.  I didn't have worcestershire sause so I added red wine to the meat after the soup, and that turned out very good.  Overall a good recipe, I would definately make this again!

Very easy to put together but very lacking in flavour. Had to add heaps of worchestershire sauce to the finished product to inject some flavour. Won't be making again.

I accidentally opened cream of chicken soup and went ahead and used it.  I omitted the flour and added garlic powder and black pepper.  It was quite good and I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks!

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used more than a pound of hamburger, so needed to double the mushroom soup.  Also, added worcestershire sauce.  It was still a little bland even adding that for some flavor.  I added some canned mushrooms, also, because I don't think the cream of mushroom soup adds enough to get that stroganoff feel.  I would make this again, maybe spice it up a little more.  Thanks for giving me a base recipe to go from!

My entire family loved this.  The ingredient list was simple-enough and even my toddler loved every part of it!

I made this recipe last night and my family loved. I added extra soup and sour cream to make it more creamier. I will be making this one again. Yvette

This is a great week day dinner for those who want dinner quick but don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen after a long day! It's easy and delicious! I added 2 small cans of mushrooms to give it a little more texture. Enjoy!

I loved this recipe! I have always made stroganoff the long way with my mothers recipe and didn't think that any recipe could be as good.  But this was not only delicious but my son who eats nothing but peanut butter actually ate some and liked it!!
