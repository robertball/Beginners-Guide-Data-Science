Made this according to directions and it was excellent! Made slaw and had BBQ sliders. Excellent ! Instead of throwing the broth away, I froze it for future use.

This was so yummy!  I cooked a 6.5 lb. pork loin roast for 12 hours in the slow cooker exactly as the recipe specifies.  It was fall-apart tender.  Didn't make bbq sauce, although it sounds really good. But I didn't have time for that, so I used KC Masterpiece Original. We did a taste test between that and Sweet Baby Rays original, and KC won out hands down.  I served this to 10 guests and several went back for seconds (and thirds) and I still had a good bit left over. But no one seemed to object to taking a little home for a snack later.  Thanks for this recipe!  Will no doubt make again.

Very good.  Family loved it.  I used a 2 1/2 lb. Pork loin and didn't have any celery, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Served with buttered buns and seasoned Curly Fries.

The first thing that did not make sense to me about this recipe is to discard all the juices the pork was cooking in. I was not about to toss all that goodness away, so I separated it from the meat, pureed it and reduced it before adding it into the sauce. I will continue to search for the ULTIMATE pulled pork recipe.

Served it to about 40 people and it had rave reviews! I added about 1/3 C HP sauce in place of 1/3 C of ketchup, and a few other personal preferences like more fresh garlic and added no celery. With our own farm grown pork, it was super tasty! Served it on homemade white dinner buns. Will definitely make it again!

**One thing to note - I used the Original Crock Pot to cook mine.  You should know that the "Low" setting only means it takes longer to heat up to the cooking temperature. Once it reaches cooking temp, "Low" is equal to "high" so watch it carefully once you mix the sauce with the shredded pork or the sugars will burn.

I was disappointed.  The roast had no BBQ flavor without sauce. I did use a good commercial sauce, but in the south, the meat is primary.  I will not make this again.

Made exactly as recipe is written and it was awesome!  My husband said it reminded him of pulled pork his Grandmother used to make.  Trying again w/sweet baby rays just to try as quicker option.

Why discard the vegetables? I just diced the apple, onion and celery at the start. At the 8 hour mark, I shredded the pork aside, drained the slow cooker liner and saved the broth for a future meal, and moved the veggies (was about two cups) to a pan with only half the butter and straight to simmer with half the water and ketchup called for. Turned out fabulous this way and no waste.  Guests were in awe. If I were going more closer to this recipe, I'd readily go with only a cup of water to get to a thicker sauce faster. I also dry rubbed my pork and had it overnight in the fridge before slow cooking. Simmering a homemade sauce and adding it for more slow cooking and draining juices is awesome here and will do all my future BBQ this way. Tangy sauce recipe, really good here.

I made this recipe as stated with a bit more liquid smoke, served it on toasted brioche buns with crunchy apple coleslaw for 160 people. Great success with 7 slow cookers. Many people asked for the recipe. 
For large numbers allow 10% shrinkage for the pork and 120 grams pp which was plenty.

I love the pulled pork recipe for the crockpot but I use Scott's Savory Barbeque Sauce (here on Allrecipes) instead of the one given in this recipe.

That was pretty awesome. Unfortunately at 6:00 am I didn't have the apple but I did taste the flavor with the apple cider vinegar. It was really good

Cut the sauce recipe in half and it was still more than needed for a 5 lb loin.  Also added a little "heat" to the sauce.  Will make it again.

Have made 2 or 3 times.  Really like it, pork is super tender.  It's not a quick recipe, only reason for a 4, otherwise would be a 5 ??.  I use the pork broth/juices instead of water.  I also pur√©e the bbq sauce with my hand blender before adding to the shredded pork.

This is the second time I have made this recipe and it was even better the second time around. The family was tired of traditional Christmas dinner, I served this instead and it was a huge hit. Served on slider buns and sweet Hawaiian rolls. 

This time I followed the recipe exactly for the pork roast. 

For the sauce I made three slight adjustments:
1. I eliminated the celery from the sauce. This is just a preference for the family.
2. Instead of water in the sauce I used the drippings from the roast (ran through cheese cloth to get rid of any bits and pieces)
3. Added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar to sweeten the sauce a bit more. 

Don't be scared of the vinegar. The sauce is not bitter. 

I used an 8 pound roast, this served 8 adults with enough left overs for everyone to take a little home. 

This is now my number one pulled pork recipe.

We loved this!!  Although the broth is delicious, there is no need to keep it for this recipe specifically since you are making BBQ sauce to mix into the pork.  It is nice to mix some into the meat though before adding the BBQ sauce to add a little more of a savory flavor.  But hey, if you want to keep the broth for another use, go right ahead, but I don't think you should knock the recipe for it.  We enjoyed this so much and it is also great on potatoes!!

I basically quartered the amount of ingredients, omitted the celelery and cooked  my Pork in the sauce.
If you don't cook your Pork in the sauce you will not have a flavourful pulled pork out of the crock pot. If you have a smoker, this sauce would be good for a smoked pork after it is cooked.

This is such a great and tasty recipe!  I've made this basically most of my life on my own by "dumping" stuff together;)  But I needed a recipe for a crowd of 30 so of course I perused AllRecipes.com!  This was perfect except I did not put in the celery, butter or liquid smoke. Also, I cooked the pork in my crockpot with only water added, none of the other stuff in.  Everyone loved the pork bbq.  I did not make the whole amount of sauce however - about 2/3 for my 13 lbs of meat(I changed the servings amount).  It would've been too much sauce had I made the full amount but otherwise - DELICIOUS!

I made this according to directions and it was amazing. Everyone that ate agreed wholeheartedly.  If you taste the sauce by itself and feel it's not quite what you expected, put it on the meat and you will be pleasantly surprised by the end result!!!  The only minor change I made was after I sauteed the onions and celery in the butter, I put them in the blender because I knew some people would not like the chunks. Because it became watery (and looked nasty, btw), I did omit the water from the recipe.  It was perfect!

This was a great pulled pork recipe.  The only change I made was to eliminate the celery in the sauce.  Celery can make things bitter so......  Still turned out fantastic.  Made it for Mothers Day and received many compliments.

Prepared this to the letter.... except for using fresh pressed garlic instead of powder in the sauce. This makes an excellent pulled pork, served with slaw on a kaiser roll. Mm-mmmm!

Very tender!  Will probable leave the celery out of the sauce next time to make the kids happy. (Or use celery seed)
.
2nd time making I used celery seed instead of celery, piled on bottom of a sub bun, topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled until cheese was melted.  Yummy again!

This was good.  I did everything as written, only I didnt have an apple. I also used some of the cooking juice in place of water in the BBQ sauce. Next time I might use slightly less vingear, but it was still yummy! Thanks! P.S This would go great with some homemade slaw!

We had friends over for dinner, and everyone liked this. I did need to adjust the BBQ sauce a bit after following the recipe, but I'm sure this was just our own personal tastes. For me, the mustard overpowered the sauce a bit. Played around a bit to get it to suite my taste. I really liked the pork portion of the recipe, and might use that again with my favorite bottled BBQ sauce.
