I made these for my daughters' Halloween party at gymnastics.  Everyone loved them!  I did mess them up, and they were still great!  I got a little distracted and forgot to turn the oven off after an hour, so they baked at 225 degrees for close to 90 minutes.  I thought I had ruined them so I didn't wait for them to cool with the oven door closed.  They were nicely toasted and tasted like crisp, airy toasted marshmellows.  Next time I will set the timer and try to do it correctly!!!  Kudos!

I made these super fun treats for a themed movie night with my kids.  I think I should have beaten the egg whites a little longer for more stiffness, but overall, these turned out pretty cute and they were really tasty!  My kids were so excited to eat these "bones" and loved them!

Amazing but a little labor intensive.

Way sweeter than I like and I'm a sweets eater. Made them before but with Betty Crocker's  recipe  and really enjoyed those. If I do again will cut sugar way down. I had stiff glossy peaks about half way through sugar so will stop at that next time.
