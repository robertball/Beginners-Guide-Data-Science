I'm from Indiana, so when i found this recipie to be very similar to the one my grandmother used to make, i was so excited! It was so good! One suggestion-make sure that when you're cooking the cabbage to wait untill at least some of it is brown or nearly black to take it off the heat because this is when the cabbage has the most flavor. Also, try to use a cast iron skillet if you have one, that's how it's traditionally made.

I liked this, but the grease was a little much.  Once I remade it with alterations it was great.  Try, instead of cooking raw bacon, starting with the butter and either cooked bacon pieces (but still soft) or packaged bacon bits (the kind that is real bacon and still chewy).  This provides enough grease for the flavor, without all of the calories.  If you end up short on liquid, just add olive oil.

I found no grease problem with this recipe. [Cook bacon over medium-high heat until crisp, drain, crumble, set aside. Combine butter, cabbage, celery, green pepper, salt, pepper and onions. Cover, steam 15-20 minutes. Stir in crisp bacon just before serving.]

I omitted the mushrooms and did not add any liquid (other than what was clinging to the vegetables).  I only add about one tablespoon of butter.  I Used about 1/2 cup of celery and one yellow, not green bell pepper.  This should be glistening - if that seems greasy to you, then don't book with bacon grease!  This is down-home cooking for sure.  The best thing to do is fryt he bacon up whole, then save it to crumble over the cabbage at the end of cooking.  This recipe needs a lot of salt, crushed red pepper, and maybe a dash of vinegar to make it sing.

This recipe is very flavorful, but I did make some changes. I didn't have the celery and canned mushrooms, so I used about 6 ounces of chicken broth along with the remaining ingredients. It reminded me of ham and cabbage!!!!! Excellent!!!!!!!!

I was very disapointed with the results of this recipe. My family loves cabbage, but this was nothing like I hoped. Very greesey! I gave 2 stars because I like the ingredients, and I'm hoping to play around with it in the future to make better.

Very nice dish with a lot more going on than the sauteed cabbage with bacon and garlic I'm accustomed to making.  I added garlic to this as well and helped the mixture simmer along with a little chicken broth.  I also used fresh rather than canned mushrooms. This is both interesting and flavorful.  I suggest using the recipe as a guide rather than following the measurements precisely (using more or less bacon than called for comes to mind for example) - cooking "to taste" is always a good idea in my book.

Gosh - the taste IS great but it got kind of greasy! I too omitted the mushrooms but added 1/8c water to compensate for their missing "juice." Still - we really did like the taste if it just wasn't so greasy - I felt guilty for eating it.

Loved this recipe!  I must admit, however, that I did not use bacon grease--couldn't do it.  I just used a little extra butter with the cooked bacon.  I also used fresh mushrooms with about 1/3 cup water.  This was a wonderful way to serve lots of different vegetables.  A big hit with the boys.

I was looking for something different to share at a potluck and did I find gold in this recipe! It's terrific!  I didn't think it was greasy at all even though I was expecting it to be with the ingredients but I didn't use all of the fat the bacon left behind either.  Thanks for sharing, YUMMY!

This was delicious! I used 5 strips of bacon and omitted the butter to make it a little healthier.  My husband wanted to know if there was more.  I will have to make double next time.

I make this all the time. We don't add the mushrooms but we do add one can of diced tomatoes. My Grandmother taught me this recipe and called it German Cabbage. Never understood the name, but it is wonderful!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  That being said, I did change a couple of things.

I did not add the butter but did not drain the bacon (there was only about a tablespoon and a half of drippings...maybe we used lean bacon??).  

When I added the veggies, I did not cover it, but fried it on medium heat, uncovered--stirring every 2 minutes or so--for about 12 minutes.  This gave it a bit of a brown or "fried" taste.  THEN I covered it and turned it down to low and let it steam for another 10 minutes or so.

I added a minced clove of garlic and only half of a pepper (as we aren't huge pepper fans).  Otherwise, we followed the recipe. 

Again, REALLY good.

This recipe is Fantastic! My granny used to make fried cabbage, I couldn't remember how, so I looked and found this one. Awesome! I like to add what i call the "Justin Wilson" touch, and add sliced smoked sausage and pepper sauce to taste, goes great with broccoli cornbread!

I made this recipe a bit healthier with olive oil about 2 tbsp.  I also used fresh mushroom and added a tbsp of water to make up for the juice from the can.  This was outstanding.  I used seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper.  I never expected it to taste soooo good!!

this was great!! Even my picky/non-veggie eating 3 year old ate it (have to give it 5 stars just because of that!!).  Made it from memory cause I did not have my computer at the time and made it a bit different.  I cut up the bacon first then fried it semi crisp. then sauted all ingredients (except for the cabbage) for about 15 minutes in a cast iron skillet, then added the cabbage.  My husband and myself loved it and it is a definate keeper.  Next time I will make it by the cooking directions just to see if it is any better.

Excellent recipe.  I'd never heard of Fried Cabbage before.  For those who prefer a less greasy taste (and maybe cut calories as well)...it will help to partially cook the bacon first, then pour off the grease and continue cooking the chopped bacon until it is crisp.  It does make a difference.

This recipe was excellent!  I omitted the butter and just used the bacon drippings.  I used a mixture of green, orange & yellow peppers and added a bit of onion powder.  It gave it a festive color.  A family favorite.

Disappointed it did not turn out the way I had expected based on the previous rave reviews.  I found it much too wet and the mushrooms, onions, peppers should have been cooked beforehand so that it would not have "boiled" in liquids.  However, I did like the smoky flavour imparted from the bacon which made the dish rich and satisfying.  I ended up throwing some cooked rice into the pan in order to soak up the excess liquid.  Overall, I thought it was a good homecooking-type dish.

Great Comfort Food!!!! Never had fried cabbage before and it is awesome and easy to make.  I didn't change a thing - yes, it is a little greasy (although I think I may have used a little too much bacon) - I served it with grilled pork chops, mashed potatos and apple sauce.  The cabbage and mashed potatos are a great combination.  Thanks Gail.
Update!!!  We had some of this cabbage left over and some mashed potatoes too.  I saw a recipe on this site call "Stuffed Kielbasa" - since I had half of a kielbasa in the freezer I ended up cooking that as the recipe stated and stuffed it with the cabbage and left over mashed potatoes.  It was great and a good way to use up the leftovers.  Try it Gail!

Had cabbage in our garden that needed to be used, I made this for my husband and he just loved it.  He has told several people about how good it was.
I will be making it again real soon.

i chose this recipe b/c it said indiana and that's where my dad's from.. he never cooked when i was growing up so this wasn't something familiar to me.. i wanted to give it a try even though i was worried it was going to be kind of bland and greasy.. i figured i'd correct that by cooking the veggies and bacon separately and adding chicken bouillon instead of just S&P.. i used fresh mushrooms and halved the onion.. the bouillon didn't cut it so i experimented until i was satisfied with the final product.. i added a splash of apple cider vinegar, a bit of sugar, some dried thyme, chili powder, cumin, lime juice, and some lemon juice.. once i realized i wasn't going to be happy with it tasting so plain i figured i'd reach out to the other side of the family (guatemala) and give that a try.. it's tasty but nowhere near what the intention was.. i also plan on adding some chopped cilantro before serving.. at least this is a somewhat healthy side for dinner as i never added in the bacon.. that'll go into something else

I loved this!  We have cabbage usually once a week, so I was looking for something different.  I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed everything in some bacon fat then added store-bought bacon bits.  I didn't use any butter and didn't think the dish was missing it. We had this with some pork tenderloin for a delicious low calorie, low carb meal!

I was surprised I liked this so much. I left out the mushrooms, used a high-quality bacon, and red pepper instead of green for an extra splash of color. What was especially good was the leftovers though. I used the leftover cabbage in a roast beef panini, topped with a slice of muester. Yum!

Totally da'Bomb!  Made a big pile of this stuff the other night. Didn't know if I or anyone would like it...we ate every bite.  Of course, anything with this much bacon is bound to be good. Definitely adding this to my repertoire of tasty meals.

Very good recipe, but I took suggestions from other reviewers: used 1 tsp. of seasoned salt instead of regular salt, added a pinch of sugar and 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper.  Tips: Cut the thick cabbage leaf spines in half or they'll be crunchier than the rest of the cabbage. Use a dutch oven - my 12" large skillet wasn't big enough and I had to switch to a dutch oven midway.

Great recipe!  I do south beach so I had to make small changes--fried the cabbage with a little olive oil and then with each individual serving i fried turkey bacon and then tossed the cabbage on top--it was fantastic!! (i bet with real bacon it would be even better!) thanks for the recipe.

Wow!!!  I've always loved fried cabbage and this recipe looked interesting.  I didn't green bell pepper so used red bell pepper instead with excellent results.  I decided to forego the mushrooms and didn't miss them a bit.  I'm thrilled to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Yum!

This was just above average in taste and texture. I looked for shortcuts to time spent in preparing the dish so I used pre-cut cabbage.  I also did not like all the grease and butter, so drained the bacon grease and used less butter.  I would make it again, if time permits.  Most often I look for something with less prep time.

This recipe is a winner in my book. I did drain most of the bacon drippings off because I thought it would be too greasey.  I served this with a St. Patrick's day meal and it was a hit.  Thanks for the recipe.

After reading rave reviews on this recipe, I was very disappointed in the results.  The grease in this recipe coats your mouth and overpowers the flavors of all the other ingredients.  I will not be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing Gail.  Sorry I didn't like it.

This was great! I did omit the mushrooms but added about 1/4 cup water since I didn't have the
liquid from the mushrooms. I don't care for celery
so I omitted that also. I will serve this again
without a doubt!

Delicious dish! I made a half-recipe and had it as a one-dish meal for dinner....so good! I used a small amount of bacon grease that I had on had (so no fried bacon pieces), and also added a little butter and EVOO.  For the bell pepper and onion, I added a handful of frozen multi-colored peppers and onions that I briefly microwaved. I love cabbage and usually saute it, but this was very different with all of the extra ingredients. I'll definitely make this again, and thanks for the recipe!

It was great. I used red bell pepper instead of green and added carrots.

The only changes is that I put pork instead of beacon and I put a touch of Sazon  and Adobo in it. This is the second time that I made this and my family loved it the first time.

I followed the recipe except, I didn't have any onions so, instead I used onion powder, added cooked turkey bacon and I added a 1/4 bone broth. DELICIOUS!!!

We tried this--WOW!  I did follow what some of the other folks said, and after cooking the bacon, I set it aside for later just before serving.  I also removed a lot of the grease from the pan to lower the calories, and added NO butter.  The cabbage ends up steaming in the juices of itself and the other veggies.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED it.... We are now officially HOOKED on this!!!!

Being from Indiana, I'm all about trying the Indiana recipes.  This fried cabbage did not disappoint.  We liked the addition of the celery and the green peppers in the mix.  I did omit the mushrooms due to personal taste.  A great recipe that I would make again.

This was a great side dish that I ended up eating as a main dish the next day. Mostly followed directions as written except for a few personal preferences-- no mushrooms, added chicken stock, cooked a little longer. Will definitely use this receipe from now on to make cabbage.

Based on others views of being to greasy I drained about 1/2 of the grease and removed the bacon. I added the bacon back at the end of cooking time.  It was very tasty.  I made sure that the cooking liquid had evaporated and the cabbage was browning/caramelizing which made it have more of a fried taste rather than steamed.  Yummy.   Next time I might try to sneak in some julianned  zucchini to hide another veggie.

The flavor of this dish was awesome.  For me however it was a bit greasy and I only used 2 slices of bacon.  I will omit the bacon next time (maybe add spicy sausage browned and then drained).  Very good side dish me and "my other" ate the whole thing in one meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent taste!  Quick and Easy!  The only changes I made were I drained the bacon and omitted the butter since there was already some bacon fat in the pan.
