Great recipe but I got nearly double the amount of jars.. more like 20 pint jars.  I might cut back a bit on the sugar next time, but it is very tasty.

Made this recipe today.  Would never know when tasting that this recipe was made with green tomatoes.  Very tasty with a little zip.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, as I have no experience making relish. So I was delightfully surprised when it was easy to follow and tasty! I found the majority of the salt went down the drain with the excess water, I notices one user was afraid of all the salt use, however the salt draws the excess liquid out. I too like another user, used less sugar. The calculation for 130 servings made exactly 7 and 1/2 pints and calls for 4 and 3/4 cups of sugar, so I reduced it to 3 cups. The relish is so amazing!!! Zesty, delicious and the majority of it came from our own garden. Thank you Suzy!!! Its a keeper for future green tomatoes that don't turn by mid-fall.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!!!
I rinsed and rinsed and soaked and rinsed and squeezed to get out some of the salt!!!!  Most recipes this size call for 4 or 5 tablespoons of salt, not a cup.  One tablespoon of relish, following the recipe, would contain as much salt as a human needs in a day.  Also, this is an awful lot of vinegar.  The quantity and mix of vegies is perfect, but it needs to be modified to be edible.

This is the second year I have made this relish using the last of the tomatoes we grow in the greenhouse.  This year I had seven pounds of green tomatoes and found that this recipe scales down very easy.  It is tasty, sweet and compliments the food its used on.  Thank you.

This was my first attempt at a green tomato relish.  The mix of spices is fantastic! I will now look forward to my extra green tomatoes each year!

Seems like a lot of relish...until you taste it.  Then, you'll wish you'd doubled the batch!  Excellent with pork, chicken and--believe it or not--mac and cheese.  Has replaced all our store-bought hot-dog & hamburger relishes.  A photo of this should appear In the dictionary, under the word "yum."

I used 3 pounds of sugar for 11 pints of relish. I also reduced the salt.   It is still is too sweet. If I make it again next year I will reduce the sugar to 1 pound.
