I cook brisket 2-3 times per year and have tried several different recipes. This one came out so tender that if it had been on a bone it would have fallen off! I'll definitely do it again.

Made this dish over the weekend and it was a complete hit.  I reduced and thickened the braising liquid, cut the brisket and put it back in the roasting pan to serve.  It was tender, tasty and all around wonderful.  I'm surprised more folks haven't reviewed it.

Omg!! Thank you for this recipe! I was looking for a brisket and came across this one.  The reviews were great.  I usually don't go with recipes with only 12 reviews but I was intrigued.  I followed recipe exact and it was wonderful!  It brought back memories of my great grandma's cooking.  This is a keeper!

Wowza ... I don't ever review but felt compelled to because this was delish! Threw in about a quarter cup extra cab, minced garlic, white onion and chicken broth (that is what I had on hand) and the last hour cooked fusilli noodles (half bag for 3 pd cut of meat). Added water through out basting. Tender meat, great sauce with the noodles, amazing taste! Thanks for the recipe :)

BRISKET SHOWDOWN!  

Wine-Braised Beef Brisket vs. Nana Lara's Brisket (both 5 star ratings but which did we like better?)

Both turned out tender.  

Flavor wise - Nana Lara's is the winner in our family.  The rub makes a huge difference which encrusts the brisket and gives it a slightly more tender edge. The soy/pineapple combo brings a yummy flavor. 

For this wine-braised recipe the tomato/wine flavor didn't really permeate into the flavor of the meat. So if you prefer a less sweet brisket, you'd probably like this one better.

Absolutely delicious.  I was out of thyme so I used an italian blend of spices. I think I added some garlic powder too.  Not hard to make either.

I loved this recipe! I did alter it a little bit. I could only find a 4lb brisket. It had quite a bit of fat so it probably ended up being a 3 lb piece. I added a little more of each spice and maybe a quarter more of wine. I used the wine Lambrusco. My husband and I love this wine. My husband loved the brisket and took the left overs to work the next day, he said it was even better the next day. I didnt get to taste it, because he took it all but I will definitely be making this again.

When I read the recipe, I thought the cooking temperature was high for a moist, tender brisket. Wrong! The meat was fork-tender and delicious. I had to substitute tomato paste for the sauce, and chicken broth for the beef broth because that was what was in the house. Then, because I fiddle with all recipes, I added about 1/4th teaspoon of liquid smoke, tamari, and garlic powder. They weren't necessary, because the beef was delicious anyway. My family will be on my case to make this again - soon! It's a delicious, simple recipe.

I had never made brisket before so I followed this recipe exactly. It was delicious!  I used our homemade beef stock in place of broth, which I personally think put this over the top.  Instead of basting, I turned the brisket over every 45 min or so (total 4 times). There was no need to reduce gravy as it cooked down to a a perfect consistency; just enough to flavor the buttered noodles I served this with. I honestly wish I could have rated it higher, and my family agrees.  lol

Made this last night. Followed the recipe exactly and we absolutely loved it. I used a red merlot as I'm not really familiar with cooking with red wines. The sauce turned out amazing. I served with basmati rice and steamed cauliflower, zucchini and asparagus. This recipe stays in my arsenal. Thanks so much for posting it.

This recipe was absolutely delightful. There wasn't much left, but the leftovers the next day were better than the first day. I cooked it a full three hours and it was falling apart. YUM. would add a photo but we were too busy eating!

This was very simple and good.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a can of diced tomatoes and it was delicious.  I too was afraid that 350 would be too hot for the meat but it was perfect.

Very good!  I didn't realize I was out of onions until I started the recipe, so I threw in some minced dried onion to make up for it.  We really enjoyed this brisket!  Flavorful, very tender, and yummy.  Thanks!

I made this to night and it was fabulous.  I wasn't sure if it would work with a bottom round roast since that is what I had, it didn't disappoint me.  The cooking liquid made all the difference the meat was so tender it melted in your mouth.

Can't say I loved it, but can't say I didn't love it either.  Maybe it was the wine I used or the use of the tomato sauce...just couldn't figure out what it was about the flavor that seemed a little "off" to me.  Anyway, thanks RickyBobby for submitting this.  From all the rave reviews I'm sure it's me and not the recipe.

Excellent! Tender, flavorful brisket. Smartest brisket I know...It Makes it's own gravy! I saved some time, by slicing the onions the night before making the dish. Easy to prepare this meal, just time consuming on cooking. Well worth the wait! Will make again.

I followed the recipe for the most part, although I never meaure exactly.  I also added garlic powder.  The sauce got too salty overnight, so be careful with the salt.  This recipe was easy to make and turned out very tender.  It made excellent sandwiches on potato rolls with some cheese and mayo.

This was very easy and delicious! Brisket is very fatty, so keep that in mind before you start. I had to use a larger brisket to feed my crew!

I had never made a brisket before, and this looked like a good recipe to try and I'm glad I did.  While cooking, I was worried it was going to be overdone, as every time I checked it to turn the meat, the sauce was boiling, but it turned out very good and not over cooked at all.  After cooking, I sliced it up and returned the meat to the pan to soak up the 'gravy' while I finished up the mashed potatoes. I will certainly make this again.

This is a delicious recipe. My family really liked it. I added some sauteed mushrooms with garlic to the sauce at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe.
It would make a great 'special occasion' meal! 
Thank you RickyBobby!

Comes out so tender every time. I thicken the gravy a little. My family loves it.

I have never submitted a review but this was incredible!  It was super easy. I followed the directions to the letter. It was as good if not better the next day. People came to my office the next when I reheated it at work because it smelled so good!  Definite keeper!

The cut of beef I used was labeled London broil.  Not sure if hunting for brisket would have made much difference.  It made way more gravy than needed for mashed potatoes. I'd cut back on the liquids next time & hope that they would thicken up better. Used fresh thyme & rosemary & button mushrooms. Everyone liked the taste & tenderness of this meat.

This was really good....I'm always afraid of beef because where I live it's free range and usually very tough...I made this cook it 2 1/2 hours and it came out really delicious and soft.  The only thing I would change is use low sodium beef broth next time because the combination of the rub and that made the sauce that reduced down a little salty.  Oh I also sautéed in 2 cloves of garlic with the onions which gave a nice aroma....thanks for this recipe!

Okay, I made an almost 7 lb brisket for a dinner party of 5 and didnt have as much left over as I expected. I used Tempranillo Merlot for the wine and yellow onion and also sprinkled it with a “Burgundy Pepper” seasoning I bought at the farmers market. I seared it as they suggested and then started it in my 200 degree roaster for an hour or a little less (bc I was baking a pie in my oven) before transferring it to a large double grill pan, covered it in aluminum foil and baked it at 350  for another 2 hours and 15 min then let it rest a half hour before peeling off the foil and slicing it on my cutting board and placing it back into the juices and recovering w foil and served it about 40 minutes later. It was the best brisket I have ever made and all my guests raved about it. I normally do brisket a little more BBQ in style but this is much more sophisticated than that and more tender. Leftovers have been incredible also. I give this high marks,  but definitely use a high end merlot or merlot blend!

My very first beef brisket- mainly because our family eats little to no red meat- but I had tasted someone’s brisket at a party and wanted to try it- what a smashing success- wouldn’t even think of looking for a different recipe- easily made and perfect outcome- had to tell my grandsons it was a different kind of chicken ( as they didn’t want to ‘try’ meat!) and they gave me two thumbs up! Added sautéed mushrooms to gravy just because....I will likely serve it over the holidays as something different!

My first time cooking brisket and we loved it. I had two smaller pieces that made 3 lbs. I cooked this in my trusty cast iron casserole. The flavour was simple and rich.  The meat was tender and just right. We had fries with it but next time mashed potatoes for sure. I added 1/2 teaspoon msg, any will try salt free broth as it was almost too salty.

My husband made this and it was absolutely delicious. The only change was he used a yellow onion instead of red because that's what we had on hand, and he added garlic. It's a great recipe for a dutch oven. We'll be making this again.

I am very critical of my own cooking and thus somewhat, kind of, maybe a lot particular about other's cooking.  However, regardless of that observation;I found this recipe to produce spectacular results!!

The silky seasoned broth had a relaxing long-time in the oven in order to meld as one with the meat and vegetables (which becomes the most delicately-softened roasted potatoes, carrots and previously sautéed onions and tender brisket.) 

As a whole, the dish was savory, creamy, melt-in -your-mouth goodness.  The beef was juicy and perfectly done, "almost falls apart but keeps it together" brisket.  Beef at it's best when cooked with patience, appreciation and love.

Considering I only had 1.10 oz. of brisket, (about 1/3 of the brisket called for, which was 3 oz.)  I did not reduce the amount any of the other ingredients except for the wine.  I reduced that amount from 1/2 c. to 1/4 of a cup.  I did however need a little more olive oil than the 1 T. added after the brisket was browned, while sautéing the onions to keep my crappy pan from burning it all.   I also added chunks of potato and carrots.  I peeled and chopped about 4 medium red pots along with 3 large carrots, washed and thickly sliced.

I baked it at 350 in my little old toaster oven for 1 hr, then basted as directed.  I did baste at the half hour from then on for another 2 hrs.

In conclusion, I used 1/3 of the poundage of beef but cooked it basically the same way and for roughly the same amount of time.  (A bit

Very good! I’m glad I read through some reviews because I was thinking 2.5 hours at 350 seemed wrong, but it does work beautifully! I added a few extra spices to our taste, but for the most part followed the recipe as directed. Solid brisket recipe. My husband went back for seconds. Looking forward to the leftovers.

Did not use the onion due to dietary restrictions.  We all liked it, the beef was tender.  I could only find a 2.15 lb. brisket, after browning it in my dutch oven I put it in the oven for 2.5 hours.

I added minced garlic, a lot as per other reviews. It had good flavor, but wasn't as tender as I expected. I will try it again.

Tender and tasted, so amazing, my son inlaw wanted to drink the sauce! I will definitely keep this recipe. I made just as is, served it up with a baguette (to soak up the tasty juices)and garlic mash. Dan

I will definitely prepare this again. Turned out tender and delicious, made it the night before serving, sliced it and placed meat back in the gravy filled pan overnight. I might use a little less wine next time, just personal preference. I followed recipe without any changes.

This was better than I thought it would be. Instead of brisket, I used 1 1/2  pounds of chuck roast (since it was all I had). Also, I substituted vegetable broth for the red wine. I seared the meat and made the gravy in a deep dish skillet on the stove. Then I poured the contents into a roasting pan and put it in the oven for 50 minutes. After basting, I returned the meat to the oven for one hour.  My roast was tender and delicious. The tomato sauce added that extra flavor that made this dinner really good. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The gravy tasted great on potatoes.

I made this with a lean cut of chuck roast cut into portions, and slashed the tops to rub in garlic mixture, reduced the red wine by 1/3 cup and cooked in a slow cooker 6 hours.  Served over Parmesan creamy polenta and though quite peppery, wonderful flavor. Served with sliced carrots which I had added in the last 30 minutes to the crockpot.  I think sliced mushrooms would also add to this dish. Will definitely make again!

Delicious and fork tender. A go to recipe for brisket. For 5 lb brisket I substituted small can tomato paste for tomato sauce and used 1 14 1/2 ounce can of chicken broth as that was what I had on hand. I increased the wine to 3/4 cup, increased the seasoning slightly and added an extra onion to compensate for the larger size.

WOW!! So good - the only regret I have is, I bought a 4 pound briskit and cut off about a pound to store in the freezer.  I should have just cooked all of it, I don't have nearly the leftovers I was hoping for!! I suggest preparing it exactly as written, it is really delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe said.  It was tender but not falling apart, so it was easy to slice.  I took a test taste and said OMG, this is sooo good! This is a keeper.

Totally void of flavor. I thought a long braise would infuse some but was wrong. Only did this as a trial run for the upcoming holidays. Will not be on any menu.

I followed the recipe as listed.  I have not had a veggie burger in years; however, the reason why I rated only a three is because the texture was good but had to cook a little longer maybe because I used a Nutri bullet to chop veggie ingredients.  Also, although I like cumin it was slightly taken over the other flavors in the burger.  I did add swiss cheese and toped with Dijon mustard and a little sweet chili sauce.  I do recommend to top veggie burger just like you would any other burger in order I believe to get a nice flavor and I did not use bread but I would take a sesame bun and place it in a skillet to get a slight buttery flavor which I believe will make this recipe a 5 star.  If someone tries it with the bun and other stuff please let me know your opinion.

This recipe was utterly delicious.  I used this for a 9 lb whole brisket on sale from Costco for $2 a pound and just tripled the recipe.  I didn't have beef broth so I used vegetable broth and added two packets of onion soup mix.  I also substituted tomato paste with more broth and more wine in place of the tomato sauce.  I added garlic because that's a flavor we really love in our household.

Despite the size of the brisket, it came out amazingly tender, with plenty of delicious sauce.  I sliced up the whole brisket, packaged it with sauce, and shared with friends.  Everyone is loving it and asking for me to make it again.

Oh so tender and good flavor! We had a small, lean brisket so laid bacon over top and put in the slow cooker instead of the oven about 5 hours on low. Made it a day ahead so it was easy to slice when cold and reheat with a gravy made from the remaining juices. I did saute the onion and de-glazed the pan with the broth, added the tomato sauce and wine and poured all over the brisket in the crock pot.

I live in a Asian country where finding a not rubber like beef is quite a task, so when I found some brisket on the market I didn't have any expectations. 
I chose this recipe cause I had wine at home and I like wine sauce with beef. Did change the recipe a little, was too lazy to saute the onions so added them raw to the baking pan, used tomato paste instead and found a lonely carrot in the fridge so I throw it in too....
When I took it out from the oven and tried it...Oh my , my, my...! it was so tender! I had not had a tender bite of beef in such  a long time that I almost cried :). Perfect recipe! I will definitely do it again.

This was incredibly delicious. I read every where that if you want a tender brisket you have to smoke it for 12 hours or have it in the oven at low heat for 6 hours. I made this one in about three and half hours. When I took it out of the oven, I reduced the juices by half and poured a good amount to each serving. Served it  with a side of cole slaw and mix of small potatoes. I did make a small change only because I forgot to buy the thyme so I replaced it with oregano and I added seasoned salt to the onions when I was cooking them. The red wine I used was Pinot noire. Everyone loved it, my aunt even suggested that we replace the ham at Christmas dinner with this wine braised brisket recipe. This recipe was easily doubled to accommodate a 7 1/2 pound brisket.

I made this dish for dinner last night, following the ingredients exactly. Not having a baking dish that could be used on top of the stove as well, I used a large, heavy non-stick skillet. I browned the meat, put it into a foil-lined baking dish, and then did the onions and added the other ingredients. I poured this into the baking dish, covered everything with foil, and put it in the oven for an hour, then basted the meat and put it back in the oven for 2 more hours. I had some concern about the temperature, but relied on the reviews. The meat was absolutely delicious, moist and cut-with-a-fork tender. Surprisingly, the union was outstanding too. My husband said it was as delicious a meat dish as he had ever had, and far surpassed any brisket he had ever been served. We had leftover brisket for lunch today, and it was excellent heated up. My husband says we'll be having brisket again soon now that "we" know such a great recipe. I'm fine with that since it was so good and so easy to make.

This is the BEST brisket I have ever tasted.  So simple but the flavors give the dish such depth.  The only thing I changed is I put my oven on 320 and cooked it for 3.5 hours.  Thank you!

Made this weekend and it was awesome.   I used a red cooking wine which was a little mild.  Recommend something with a bit more kick.  It was even better day two are marinating overnight.

This is a delicious recipe with great aroma that fulls the house, comfort food. I used sweet onion and red onion and 3 cloves of fresh crush garlic that i added to the onions as they cooked in my cast iron pot and used convection @350 for 2.5 hrs.

First time making beef brisket. Instructions were easy to follow, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved it and so did all my guests. I bought a 4lb brisket and ended up with about 3lbs after removing the fat. My 8 year old who is so picky loved it as well. Definitely adding this to my dinner rotation.

This is AMAZING! Try this with Aimee's Mashed Cauliflower 'Potatoes', found here on Allrecipes for a healthier option that pairs wonderfully. Definitely my new favorite meal; hearty & super easy to make in the crock pot too! Sauté a clove of garlic & mushrooms too, if thats your thing!

I made this for Christmas.  Larger slice of meat so had to double the recipie.  It was amazing and a huge hit.   The meat was tender flavorful and needless to say not much left for leftovers.  I highly recommend this.

Delicious and super easy. My sauce never thickened but still great.  Based on ingredients, not sure why this would ever thicken so curious about that. Thx for sharing.

Turned out as described.  I cooked it in Le Creuset at 190 degrees F  for 6 hours rather than higher temp for shorter time.  I love doing that when braising.  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that we were hoping for a tangier taste and should have picked a different recipe for  that.

We love this! I make it just like he says but I do use a pot roast vs a brisket. The sauce is so flavorful. I make noodles or spaetzle to go with it, and we drizzle the sauce over that. I do it in a slow cooker on low for 10 hours. I have made this 5 times now and it will forever be in my stable of go-to recipes. Even my 4- year old and 2-year olds love it!

This is fantastic and easy.  I had a larger brisket then what's listed, a 5 lb vs the 3.  So I doubled the ingredients, except for the onion (I used white instead of red).  I also added a half hour cooking time, so 3 hours total basting every hour.  It was excellent, also added a little flour at the end to make the sauce a bit more of a gravy.

This brisket was very good.  I normally smoke mine, but decided to try this way since I was short on time.  A little on the salty side, but will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written except that I used white onions since I didn't have red in the house. My brisket was just under two pounds so I put in a little less beef stock. In other words, I only changed the recipe out of necessity. The recipe is perfect as is--tender and flavorful. The juice thickens up nicely while the brisket is roasting. A delicious and easy entree! Just add egg noodles or mashed potatoes and a salad and you're done.

This was my first time making brisket.  I made it in the crock pot, set it to low when I left the house in the morning for work and it was super tender and juicy by dinner time.

Easy, smelled good, excellent for holiday meals. Made the whole thing in a large oven safe.frying pan. For a 2 lb brisket, cooked it only 2 hours but would probably do a little less next time

I made this a day ahead of time because I knew I would be pressed for time the next day.  I used a 2 lb. brisket, but used the full amount of the other ingredients.  I seared it on both sides as directed and  removed it from the pan.  Then I sautéed the onions for a couple of minutes and deglazed the pan with the beef broth, then stirred in the tomato sauce and wine.  I returned the brisket to the pan on top of the onions and put it in the over at 350 degrees.  After an hour I spooned some of the liquid and a lot of the onions over the top and returned it to a 300 degree oven.  It seemed to have a lot of liquid at that point, but it does simmer down quite a bit.  After a total of three hours I removed it from the oven and allowed it to cool somewhat, transferred it to another container and refrigerated it.  The next morning I sliced the brisket and returned it to the refrig.  Then, at dinnertime, I only had to reheat it and serve.  Hubs liked this a lot, but I found it to be pretty greasy.  It was probably my brisket, even though I sliced off a lot of fat from the bottom.  I can see trying this with a pot roast next time.  And I’ll add more onions.  They seemed to disintegrate over the long cooking time.

Made this two years in a row for Christmas.  This year had the butcher cut a seven pound brisket in half for me, trim it down nicely into a 3.4 pound roast.  Only alterationto the recipe was that I used cranberry wine instead.  Everyone loved it and will definitely make this again.

The flavor was exceptional, I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder to the salt/thyme mixture. The house filled with a wonderful aroma while the brisket was roasting. I was, however, pretty disappointed when I cut and tasted it. The brisket was fairly tough. My husband, the great guy he is, raved about how good it was, but said it was a little tough to chew. To summarize: Good flavor, simple to make, very tough meat. I won't be making this again.

This recipe is very easy to make, and it's delicious. The brisket comes out almost fork tender. I did change the herb from thyme to rosemary simply because I prefer the flavor of rosemary. I will make it again.

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and used different cuts of beef. As other reviewers have, I've changed it up a few times. Added more wine, garlic or used cooking onions. This is great basic recipe and a pretty good base to start and experiment.  It's very tender regardless of the cut of beef you're using.

Good enough to serve guests at Sunday dinner! I roasted this in a slow cooker for 6 hours, then let it stand for a while before slicing. The aroma filled the house with hints of wine and thyme.

This was divine!!!  I usually make brisket every few months, but this recipe turned it into an addiction to cook at least once a month!!!  I was out of thyme so I used PENZEY'S bouquet Garni which is a blend of thyme, oregano, rosemary and other mild spices.   As I love a hint of mild currie, I added a 1/4 tsp, as well.  I was also out of red wine, so I used Paris Winery's gold medal BlackBerry wine from Paris, TN.

This is one of the best recipes for a roast whether it be brisket or a chuck roast.  It can also be cooked in a slow cooker.  My husband told me that I could do anything and as long as I made this for him, it was fine.

Great recipe, but I added garlic and onion powder to the dry rub, 1/2 cup more red wine, and an extra onion

Great dish. The only thing I will do different next time would be adding a little more wine at the end. It cooked most of it off

I bought a 2.5 lb brisket and cooked it in my 4 quart braising pan.  It was very easy to make and came out pretty well.  Served with Honey Maple Roasted Carrots and French bread to soak up all the brisket sauce.

This was delicious! The wine gave the meat just enough flavor without overpowering it. Instead of a roast I used a shoulder London broil. Same ingredients just cooked 30 minutes on 350, and it was perfect! He's also right, it does taste even better the next day! Will be making this again. The only downside using a shoulder london broil is that the juice was very thin and not thick but it still worked out great. I just made sure I basted the meat 1/2 way through and once again after I took it out of the oven.

The acid from the red onion seemed to permeate the sauce to a degree that it was overpowering. I like onion, but I would use half of what is called for. Don't think I'll make this again though.

Good flavor. I will definitely try again. I followed all instructions and recipe but used an eye of the round cut and cooked it in the slow cooker for the final part.

This was absolutely delicious and had so much flavor!  I love a meat that falls apart when you cut it.  The only thing I might do next time is use LS beef broth.  Definitely making this again!

Easy and very tasty.  I was concerned that the brisket was starting to look very dry during the thickening process, but all turned out moist, tender and yummy in the end.
