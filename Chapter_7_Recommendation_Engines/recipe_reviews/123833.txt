I've been making this for years.  Another way to add the mixture to the eggs is to put the mixture into a ziplock bag and squeeze the contents to a corner.  Cut the corner off and squeeze into the eggs.  It's just a cheap version of a pastry bag, makes the presentation a bit nicer.  Enjoy!

I made three different types of deviled eggs. My 1st favorite, these!! Bacon & cheddar-2nd favorite (1ST FAVORITE FOR EVERYONE I KNOW-they love love love these!) and horseradish--special deviled eggs 3rd! The only thing I did differently was added a little garlic powder and 1 small clove of garlic and no onion. Great!!!  Everytime I have an event I make deviled eggs (much requested) I have found that the MAJORITY of the people PREFER the BACON AND CHEDDAR. I always make extra and they are gone fast fast fast!!!!

Unfortunately, I used medium size eggs and the mayo ended up being quite excessive mixed with the punier yolks.  The taste was pretty nice, but of course it can be doctored up with condiments of your liking such as horseradish, rice wine vinegar, hot sauce, etc.  A good basic recipe, but make sure to add the mayo in increments :)

I normally HATE deviled eggs but these I can actually eat.  My husband LOVES them and requests them all the time.  I have taken them to playgroups and they are ALWAYS gone within minutes no matter how many I bring!

I've never even boiled eggs before let alone attempted deviled eggs but these were pretty easy to make.  I served them as an appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner and they were a hit.  I think next time I may try using garlic powder instead of a garlic clove.  Thanks!

This is the only way I make deviled eggs now. We like the bite from the garlic. I still slice up olives to put on top of each egg. I do add a bit of worchestershire. I use my emersion blender to mix the yolks. Very easy to clean up with little waste.

Excellent. I did make minor changes. Instead of prepared mustard I used Bookbinder's Horseradish mustard, instead of salt I used celery salt and cayene pepper to taste. My family loved them.

Tasty deviled eggs.  However, I strongly recommend to cut the amount of mayonnaise in half.  Other than that, the garlic deviled eggs were delicious!  A real keeper.

Added a little more mustard than called for, along with some freshly cracked black pepper and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  Also, only used one green onion.  Delicious.

Wonderful! Looking for an easy recipe for deviled eggs on Easter. Am not a fan of bacon (in addition to celery and peppers of any kind), so that cut the available recipes down. Normally I would just stick in some mayo and paprika, but mustard was requested. I came across this this recipe fitting my guidelines. It was absolutely wonderful. Will be keeping this recipe on file!

i added some pickle relish since my little girl insisted all stuffed eggs have relish 2 teaspoons. i liked these with the green onion! my eggs must have been small because the mayo was too much but i was prepared and added it a little at a time.

Yummy! These were super tasty and a huge hit. I made them using regular mustard though. I'm not the biggest fan of biting into fresh garlic (I chopped in into really small pieces too) so the next time I make these I'm going to mash the garlic up in my mortar and pestle then add it or just use roasted garlic. But overall a super delish snack for sure.

These were a hit at my holiday party.  Everyone enjoyed the garlic flavor.  I used ANASHA's tip and made a makeshift pastry bag with a ziplock bag and piped the filling in.  Wonderful suggestion.  Thanks Eva!

Seriously, can I add stars!!! Way... way so yummy for my tummy! I did not have the green onion on hand, so I used very finely minced yellow onion. I also added some fresh ground black pepper and used smoked paprika instead of the usual sweet. It was a party in my mouth. Oh, yeah :)

Perfect! I didn't measure anything out, however I did it pretty true to reciept. Instead did it by taste as I could tell yoke size might throw off the measurings. They turned out perfect. Awesome mix!

These taste quite different than the recipes I have always had at home and elsewhere. This is my first attempt at deviled eggs and they turned out great. The garlic is a wonderful touch. I wonder if most deviled egg recipes include sugar, because these have no hint of sweetness, and in retrospect, I think most deviled eggs I've eaten have at least a hint of sweetness. I did learn that floating eggs should be considered old and discarded. Besides being old, the yoke sinks to the bottom of the shell and will not be in the middle when you cut it, as you would want the yoke in boiled eggs which are going to become deviled eggs to be. My wife loved these, as did I. Easter, 2012.

These are yummy!  Thought I would add these to my Easter brunch  can't wait to have my guests try them.  I didn't add the onions, I think I'll just top the eggs with them.  And since I love garlic I added just a little more.

I too do not like pickle relish so these are the deviled eggs I make all the time. Every pot luck, birthday party, holiday dinner, this is what I am requested to make. There are NEVER any left overs. So good! I use german ground mustard and smoked paprika to make them a little extra. :)

Delicious! The only change I made was a quick saute of  the onions and garlic before putting them in the eggs. I felt it helped the flavers meld together.  Great recipe!
