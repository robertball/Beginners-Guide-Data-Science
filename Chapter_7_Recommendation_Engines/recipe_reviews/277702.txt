An incredible soup. Only changed broth to a combination of vegetable and chicken because that’s what I had (six cups). Believe I would be happy to have this for many days in a row.

Recipe made as written with one exception. I used red potato instead of yellow because it holds its shape better. Delicious base hamburger soup to mix and match all the veggies in the drawer, as alievanleuven said. Nice. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I made this last evening and had it for dinner and it was ok. I brought it with me for lunch today and it was great. The flavors had time to meld together. I had it again for dinner tonight it was so good.

Loved this recipe as is.  Very similar in taste to O.G. minestrone soup!  In fact, one could add kidney beans, spinach and a few items easily to replicate minestrone.  The quantities listed for cabbage, potatoes and carrots could easily be increased.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes, they held together fine
