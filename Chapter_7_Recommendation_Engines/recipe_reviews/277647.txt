Using the chocolate:cream weight calculation vs volumetric measurements was perfect. I wanted to do a test run of this recipe, so I just grabbed the tail end of a big bag of chips, poured out a pleasingly round number of grams, added the correct amount of hot cream, whisked, boom. Perfect ganache. The whole thing came out perfect (including the spice addition). I used a pair of plastic forks with the center tines snapped out as dipping tools, as seen in someone else's video, and those worked a treat.

Made this today to give for holiday gifts for the staff.  The truffles turned out very well, but when I dipped them in the melted chocolate the truffles started to melt too!  I think I managed to salvage the truffles, hope they taste as good as they look!

I have made these three times so far and every time it has been a hit! It's very easy to make different flavors by replacing the spices with some extract. So fat I have made the spiced version in this recipe, mint, coconut and orange. If you divide the ingredients it's very easy to make 2 or 3 kinds at the same time. With minimal added time.

I made this twice and both times it was unusable. I used milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate. I didn’t see anywhere that it had to be dark, the recipe said we could make substitutions, and we prefer milk chocolate.  The ganache was not very thick. I had to keep them in the freezer all night and I was able to roll them into balls, but they soon flattened and started softening. I’m going to put everything back into the bowl and remelt the ganache and use it like a fondu. If the milk chocolate is the reason this didn’t work for me, should I be using a different percentage of cream or does it have to be dark chocolate? I really want this to work for me.

I've never made truffles before today.  I watched the video, measured out my chocolate, heated the heavy cream and bam, made the truffles.  I couldn't be more pleased with how easy this was.  The flavor is outstanding, the texture is perfect.  I'll be making these again.

Made this twice with a slightly lower % of cacao dark chocolate but worked perfectly.
Chef John says you can make subs but try not to use milk chocolate as that will mean you need to use different amounts of heavy cream.

Also ganache CAN melt when you're applying the outer layer of chocolate and you are impatient; once it melts, it is an absolute mess to deal with. So be patient.

My 15yo daughter made these for presents. She did 2 batches after the 1st didn't work as well. Inspiring Baker.
