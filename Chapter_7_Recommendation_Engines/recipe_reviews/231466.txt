Tried these last night.  Four people devoured them all in 5 minutes!   DELICIOUS!!   So simple and they look like you picked them up at the bakery.  I found that if I lightly sprayed the parchment paper with Pam, they did not stick.  Also, did not use cardamom.  I will buy several boxes of frozen puff pastry and keep it on hand to make this simple dessert anytime I am in a pinch or just feel like giving my family a scrumptious treat!

These are to die for! I just inhaled three in less than 5 minutes lol I had an extra box of frozen puff pastry sheets from a savory recipe that I made a week ago and I was craving something sweet. Thank goodness I stumbled across this recipe. I added some brown sugar to the cinnamon sugar mix because I like the stickiness that it adds to baked goods and excluded the cardamom simply because I didn't have any handy. I also sliced the roll using string because I couldn't imagine murdering that delicate pastry dough with a knife lol I had to distract myself during the cooling time or else I would have just snatched them up right off of the baking sheet because they smelled AMAZING. I'm definitely keeping puff pastry in my freezer at all times now for this amazing recipe. Thanks for changing my life haha

Exactly the recipe I was looking for.  These are my favorite cookie, but I never could get the taste as the ones from the local bakery.  My batch of cookies did not puff up like your picture (I struggle with puff pastry for some reason), but they tasted wonderful.  My husband's co-worker bought me more pastry and sent it home with my hubby for another batch.  Thanks!

This is so easy, and so good! Crispy and sweet, with a satisfying chewiness.  I was surprised how much these expand in the oven so leave lots of room around them.

Super simple.  I put the entire fold back in fridge for 15-30 minutes before cutting, made it a lot easier.  I cooked for 15 minutes at 365. Perfect!

Everyone else stated how easy it was to make these.  Well, I must suck then because they were really hard.   They were hard to roll out without sticking to everything; they were hard to roll up when they were too soft; I rolled to softly and they fell apart ; they stuck to the pan like glue.  I did get one set to come out edible although they were not win any visual prizes - they were delicious so they got a 5!  However, never again.

It just does not get any easier. Followed instructions exactly and results were delectable! Parchment paper makes for easy removal and cleaning. I use it all the time! Kept these uncovered in the microwave, (my breadbox), and they were still good 3 days later.

Love them make sure to get them off the pan right out of the oven it's a lot easier to recurl them a little than to try to get the hardened sugar off without them falling apart also putting the roll back in fridge for a few minutes helps in cutting

I think I found heaven. The easiest thing there is to bake and so so so delicious! But be aware these are addictive and by no means diet friendly.

These little pastries are so adorable and so delicious!!!! My only problem with it was that the puff pastry didn't fluff up. I blame this on myself though because the puff pastry had expired quite a few years ago!!!!! How embarrassing!! 
They turned out delicious though. Thanks!!!

PARCHMENT PAPER!
And cold. The puff pastry should be thawed but cold. I sprinkled sugar on parchment paper and then rolled it out. Refrigerate a little while before rolling and then again after rolling. Set the cookies onto new parchment paper for baking. 

The cookies stayed small and did not stay in the nice V shape I'd formed in the middle like the bakery cookies. They were yummy.

Made per recipe. no changes. absolutely delicious. Mine puffed up just like picture. challenge to roll them not too loose not too tight used a dab of water to hold together. As I sliced each one, I did have to do repair work to hold before placing on baking sheet. Worth the effort. Delicious, elegant.
Yield for me was 24 palmiers. WILL make again.

Tastes good. Crispy and fancy looking. It was still a little challenging to squeeze the two sides together so that they will stay together. But I will probably make these again.

Really simple and tasty.  Be careful to make a tight spiral before you cut them, so that the final cookies keep their shape better.

These are right up my street!  Had to put them away before I scarfed them all.  Super easy. I had a little trouble getting the centers to stick together but they still turned out fab! LOVE LOVE LOVE. Will be freezing some of these.

Delicious. Served with French Vanilla pudding and sliced strawberries. I guess you can call it deconstructed strawberry napoleons.

Working with the rolled up pastry isn’t THAT easy, but after several attempts, was pleased with results.  I used some brown sugar,and sprayed Pam on parchment paper. These are addictive and heavenly!!

These cookies were a hit at my husband’s work Christmas party. They’re delicate and crisp right out of the oven; however, after cooling and storing them air tight I found them to be a little softer. Either way, a true treat!

Yum! I ran out of cardamom and used nutmeg in its place and they turned out delicious!

Really very good and super easy as written.  The second time I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and when I placed the palmiers on the parchment I scooped up the remaining sugar on the table and sprinkled some on top of the uncooked palmiers .  Everyone loved them

Easy, tasty, only trick to roll it tight enough for that professional look. I did add allspice and nutmeg to the cinnamon and cardamom- I also mixed white sugar and brown sugar- I live at altitude baked for 14 minutes . Thanks for the recipe and the helpful comments.

I found some puff pastry that came with parchment paper so that was a plus. Made these with ease.  And finished them off even faster. Very tasty and super easy to make. (I also did not use cardamon, subbed nutmeg and it was wonderful)

I  had puff pastry sheets left over from another dessert I made so I made these. They were a hit at my HOA meeting! I didn't have cardamon so I used 3/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons. So tasty!

Crazy good and super easy! Just sliced into pinwheels and accidentally sliced too thin- but they're bite-size and scrumptious. Between my husband, my dog and I, they're almost all gone!

Delicious! Instead of weighing 2g of cinnamon, I did about 1 1/4 tsp. These would also be nice with raisins in as well! You could also drizzle some icing over the top. 
To make the outer layer of the pastry crispy, you could sprinkle sugar over the top or brush the top with egg wash. Ensure that you roll it tightly or it will come undone when cooked.

These get 5 stars but are horrible. Yup, horribly smell good when baking, taste great, but because of using the puff pastry are very greasy from the butter in the dough. They are basically the elephant ears you can buy but better.  Hubs made them & said they can't be made often or eat them all. He also suggested we try using a pie crust so maybe it wouldn't be as greasy tasting.  I suppose then I'd fight him so I could eat more. I don't think there is a good solution cause they just make the house smell sooooo good while baking. Since you cut them so small so they'll be crispy you tell yourself you can have more. Nice change from cinnamon rolls is a added bonus in trying these.

I didn't use the cardamom because I didn't have any- but these came out really nice! And they are pretty too!
