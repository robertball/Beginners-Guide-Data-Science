Great black beans!  Very easy to make, and smells up the house nicely. I would use a little less pepper next time - was a tad too spicy for me. Make ahead - these were SO much better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

totally worth five stars, and i don't usually like black beans! But my boyfriend wanted to try some because we have been doing weight training and black beans have so much fiber without the load of carbs in bread. we both don't like peppers or pimentos, so i just left them out, and i used canned beans instead of dry. The trick to canned beans is to pick the low-sodium variety with the most spices already in it. (More flavorful beans, the usual is salt sugar and dehydrated onion, but if you can find canned beans with more than that they're even better!) I used two cans, drained, and DIDN'T ADD THE 5 CUPS OF WATER!!!! this is very important, as a few reviers have mentioned their beans came out watery. The water is to soak the dry beans in, and then to be drained off. If you need some extra liquid while cooking the beans, add a little chicken broth. (Or vegetable if you're vegetarian) :) It turned out -so- good, i'll be making them often! Thanks :)

First off: this recipe does NOT work as written with canned beans.  I used three 15-oz. cans of beans and only 4 c. of water, and it was still way too watery.  I had to simmer it forever to even get it close to not looking like soup.  Now, perhaps this isn't the case when you use regular beans, and/or perhaps this is how soupy it's supposed to be.  Regardless, next time I'll use at the most 2 c. of water, if not less.  Also, this could use a few more spices; I increased the black pepper and added cayenne pepper.

These beans were a perfect side to Tinga poblana de pollo. They have just a hint of sweetness and complemented the spicy chicken dish beautifully.  I made them a day ahead because I think that beans, like chili, always taste better the next day.  For those who had issues using canned beans, dried beans are healthier, tastier, and have a much better texture than canned.  You do not need to soak overnight.  Boil the beans in water for two minutes and then let them sit for one hour.  Drain, rinse, and continue on with the recipe.  I will use these as a vegetarian filling for tortillas, as well as a side.

Very good. Based on other reviews & what I ate a cuban restaurant, I left out the tomato paste and sugar. Even my picky 7 year old liked them. I'm not a fan of green bell peppers, but they blend well once cooked in this recipe. Different than our normal black beans & rice with cumin/cilantro from Allrecipes.

I'm not a picky person.  These don't taste like the black beans I had all the time when I lived in Miami.  These are very sweet, which I don't like when it comes to black beans.  I don't like throwing food away, so I'm going to add hot sausage to it and hope that makes the taste better.

8/12/06 - UPDATE: I crumbled up some Jimmy Dean Hot sausage, browned it, and added it to these beans.  WOW.  huge difference in taste.  It was actually good after that.

These beans were tasty, but definately not "Cuban".  No bonafide Cuban would ever put tomato sauce/paste in their beans.  I added a large bay leaf, some cumin, used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar and added about a tablespoon of sugar and of course, NO TOMATO paste.

This is totally awesome!!  I warmed some up at the office one day.  The aroma made EVERYONE request a copy of the recipe!!  We've had it over rice, with fresh bread, over pasta...even my 5-year old loved it!  Scrump-dilly!

Good basic recipe, definitely not spicy enough for my family.  If I make again, would have to add some chili powder, hot peppers, hot sauce, etc.

We love this recipe.  The smell is intoxicating while its cooking. My husband and I have made ourselves sick because we couldn't stop eating it one night. As far as modifications, I have never actually added the pimentos, we never have them.  Sometimes I'll sub with roasted red pepper, but I usually don't worry about it.  I also cook this in a pressure cooker for about 25 minutes. We never have added the toppings, and we like it on brown rice.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thanks for the great recipe!  This was pretty easy to make and very cheap as well.  Everything I needed was found easily at the Mexican grocery three blocks away, which saved me a trip to the supermarket.  I may make it again in the future with some spicy sausage and omitting some of the oil to compensate.  I didn't have a problem with the vinegar making the beans hard because I soaked the beans for about 18 hours.  However, the beans were tender but not as smooth as they would be if I had used canned beans, so I will probably stir in the vinegar toward the end of cooking next time.

I believe that lady that made these beans every wednesday was Mexican  but nt Cuban .  We do not make our Black beans with sugar, pimentos or tomatoe sauce. Nor, do we serve them with sour cream and cheese heeped on top...That sounds very Tex Mex...soryy!!

Great recipe but need modifications.
As other reviewers said, vinegar, sugar, and salt prevent beans from cooking. So here is what I did:
I soaked dried beans for five hours, then pressure cooked them for 12 minutes on high. Meanwhile, fry the onion, garlic and green bell peppers. I added chipotle chile powder and cumin at the end of frying (I like it spciy). When the beans are done, check how much liquid is left...if there is too much, pour it out until beans are only half covered with cooking liquid. Add the onion mixture to the pot with tomato paste and salt, vinegar and other seasonings. Simmer for twenty minutes and serve with chedder cheese sprinkled on it!

DELICIOUS!  I used 3 cans of black beans and 3 cups of water as suggested.  I didn't have tomato paste so I used a can of tomatoes with green chilies.  My hubby couldn't stop raving about them.  The next day we had black bean burritos with the leftovers. YUM!!

Not very tasty but doesn't taste bad either. Very mild. I can't imagine what it would taste like without the garlic. DON"T skip the garlic. My family enjoyed these beans - I put it in a bun to serve and told them it was Cuban Sloppy Joe's. I will add a few dashes of red pepper seeds next time.

If you use canned beans, don't add that much water. 1 cup at the most or non at all - depending on how long you cook the dish. you need 5 cups of water if you cook fresh beans as they need to get soft. It also could use some more spices, but other than that this is pretty good.

Great but needed adjusting when using canned black beans.  Use 2 cans of beans, use only 1/4 can of tomato paste or else it's too tomatoey, add a little water, add hot pepper sauce.

Way to doctor up black beans!  I was too lazy to start from scratch with dried beans, so I scaled the recipe down to two servings, the equivalent of one can of beans. I kind of winged it on the measurements, added very little water, and simmered it only briefly, maybe 5-10 minutes.  Lots of flavor, and went great with yellow rice and Cuban Shredded Pork, recipe also from this site.

I did a pressure cooker quick soak on dry beans, drained and rinsed and then proceeded and this turned out perfect.  The tomatoes, vinegar, etc. had no effect on the cooking time for me.  These beans were tender and flavorful.  Only change I made was to add a whole chopped jalapeno and instead of tomato paste, I used a small can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes (undrained).  Served over rice.  Very good and will make this meatless meal again soon.

This is a new family favorite!! I did tweak the recipe to fit what I had on hand and my family's finicky tastes but it still turned out delicious!  I spent all of $5 on this meal and was able to use my kitchen staples for the rest - what a bargain for a delicious dish!

I omitted the pimentos, tomato paste and vinegar and added 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp tsp cayenne and a handful of chopped cilantro (I had some on hand - but next time I'll be sure to pick some up just for this dish).  About 30 minutes from the end, I added 1 tsp cocoa powder to take the bite off the spice. 

This was so filling and yummy, and we have left overs for burritos tomorrow. Oh - and just for the record - I used dried beans, soaked over night - it was worth it to save my family from the sodium.

Delicious!  I held off on adding the vinegar, salt and tomato paste until the beans were almost done because I read that any of those could prevent them from getting soft.  They are delicious and I'll be making them again for sure.

We loved these...  The only modification I made was adding 1 small bay leaf and some chopped cilantro. I noticed that the beans were looking more "soupy" than I wanted them to be, so I removed the lid and simmered them uncovered for the last 30-40 mins to cook them down a bit.  This might just be a matter of personal preference, though.  This was my first time cooking dried beans, and they came out great. I will definitely make these again.

I halved this recipe and used 1 can of canned black beans. So I omitted the water and boiling time -- you just need to heat it at that point, cooking canned beans for an hour and a half is ridiculous and is not what the author intended when she suggested you use canned beans. That the user who said it "doesn't work with canned beans" got "highly helpful" points does this recipe a grave disservice, because it came out quite tasty and was simple to do with canned beans. (It'd be simple with dry beans, too, just not as fast.) Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was great.  Very easy and after soaking beans overnight, I put it all in a 6 qt crockpot and let it simmer all day.  Didn't use the olive oil or the pimentos and it was great.  Sriracha on top makes it even nicer.

Mywhole family loved this!  I made it exactly as written, except I added a jalapeno, and a little more salt.  It was delicious!  I like beans really well done though so i did cook it longer, close to 4 hours.  Will definitely make again.

These were fantastic!  I used 2 cans of black beans, no water, no tomato paste, but I did use 1/2 can of diced tomatoes.  Simmered until they were perfect.  Even my kids ate these.

Boy, did I love this! We served it as a side dish to chicken and steak soaked in Mojo Grilling Marinade (from this site), rice, mango and avocado salad...all washed down with Mojitos (also from this site). Outstanding meal!

I listened to some previous advice about using canned beans, which helped tremendously.  Instead I used 2 cans of black beans and reduced the water to 15 ounces (tomato paste can filled two and a half times) and they turned out fantastic!  We served the beans over a cilantro rice with ropa vieja and it was a perfect dinner.

My family loves this recipe!  A favorite of my husband and my four year old son.  Even my one year old likes it!  They request it often!  I serve it over bowtie pasta topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese, as suggested.

didn't have pimentos so I used dry red chiles and fried them with the garlic and added a whole lot of black pepper and garlic salt. I also left out the sugar, Used a lot more water and simmered for hours while doing chores. everyone LOVED them and they were so easy.

These were the BEST black beans I have ever had!  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato paste and I added a bit of fresh chopped cilantro.  My brother-in-law, who doesn't eat anything but meat and potatoes, went back for seconds and asked me when I had learned how to cook (I hadn't seen him in more than 10 years).  I served these with a pork roast, yellow rice and asparagus.  YUMMY!!

This was great. My changes: 3 cans of beans, 3 cups of water, a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes, and no pimientos. I served this with sour cream and cheese, and no one used them- the beans were great on their own over yellow rice. A great, easy, low-fat meal, I'll make it again and again.

We love these beans!  I cooked the beans for much longer.  I notice some batches of beans do not soften as quickly, so allow extra time just in case.  Also, I added the vinegar towards the end of cooking and it didn't absorb well, but the next day, it had soaked in and was very tasty.  Today I am making again and will add the vinegar in at first.

Tasty.  I'd be happy (and not surprised) to get this as a side dish at a
(say, Mexican) restaurant.  However, while tasty, the traditional
way of cooking it did not work for me -- the beans didn't get soft all the
way through, even after I simmered it for an *extra* hour and a half.
(This could be because the vinegar gets added before cooking the beans.
According to the AllRecipes page on beans, using vinegar or other acids
before cooking can prevent beans from ever getting soft.)   I'm giving
this recipe four stars under the assumption that I'll find a good
alternative way of cooking it; if so, I'll try to update this review.
(The current way, with the beans still keeping a snap to them, was good
enough to eat but I'd definitely prefer entirely cooked beans.)

What can I say, but WOW!  I used this recipe Friday night when hubby dropped a BBQ on me last minute.  The commissary was closed and all I had was canned black beans.  Everyone ate these up!!  I plan to make these again very soon, but I want to try it with the dried beans just to see if it can get any better, though I doubt that's possible, since this was amazing!!

My husband liked them, but my daughter and I did not. To me they're rather bland, and just tasted like a bland, meatless chili. I don't really know what the point of the pimentos is, as you can't taste them at all. And one teaspoon of sugar was not enough, as the tomato paste left them pretty sour.

This is very good, especially after the first day.  But I checked out Cuban Black Beans and added cumin and paprika as that recipe suggests.  I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! My husband can't stop talking about how good these beans are. He's right! They're really great.  I made a batch of them today to bring to a pot-luck at a friend's house (and served them along with a pot of plain white rice). They were a big hit at the dinner.  I was a little apprehensive about adding tomato paste, but think about it - one little 6 oz. can of tomato paste in a pound of black beans isn't really that much. I hardly noticed it. I didn't have a green bell pepper, but I did have some small red, orange, and yellow peppers so I threw them in instead. I was also frying bacon for some potato salad and didn't know what to do with the leftover grease... so I added it to the beans - WHOA! That really works. I didn't measure how much bacon grease I added, but I'd guess around 1/4 cup.  Oh yeah, one more change. I didn't have time to soak the beans overnight before cooking so I ended up adding an extra six cups water and cooked the beans about 4 hours. Whenever the beans looked like they had absorbed almost all the water, I added two more cups. I ended up doing this three times.

These beans are delicious and easily modified to suit your preferences.  I was already sauteing the onions, bell pepper and garlic tonight when I realized I didn't have tomato paste.  Too lazy to go to the store, I used the closest thing I had-- red enchilada sauce.  The beans turned out great!  Don't be afraid to modify this recipe--I've followed it as written and it's remarkable, but it's never turned out less than really good when I increase and substitute ingredients. I like this recipe best when I use two CANS of black beans (rinsed), 1/2 onion, three cloves garlic, one cup water, omit the pimentos, and double the vinegar and salt,--follow the rest as written.

With all the back and forth over the addition of water to the recipe I honestly wasn't very comfortable with it. Most reviews seemed to indicate the water should be left out and that it was possibly only meant for soaking the beans and left in the recipe by mistake. Others said there was no need for the water, but I should add some broth.  I dropped the water but did use a can of chicken broth, however the whole time I was wondering if I was making a mistake in not cooking the beans first. I don't see how canned beans could be substituted for raw(soaked) beans when canned beans are cleary fully cooked.  In the end, the beans came out ok, but even after cooking longer than instructed the beans were tougher than they should be. I told myself, and the other eaters(heh) that it was just the way black beans were eaten.  Anyway, the beans were rather easy to make and they were really good over rice. If I make these again I might try some canned beans to see the difference in texture.

The best beans ever! Had to make some modifications - I used 3 cans of black beans so I reduced the water to 2 cups.  I also had to omit the green pepper and pimento because I didn't have them on hand. Reduced simmer time to about an hour! These were wonderful and very versatile - they could be served with many things.  The whole family agreed that this will become a staple recipe in our house! By the way, I also reduced the oil to 2 Tbsp. - much healthier and didn't seem to affect the taste or texture.

These beans were fantastic. I read quite a few reviews before starting these beans. I decided that I would make them straight from the recipe given. I made the right decision. With my expierence at cooking raw beans, I knew that they would not cook in a couple of hours. They need to cook most of the day. The results are wonderful. I just added a little more salt at the end.  p.s. spoon them over some brown rice and you have a wonderful low fat healthy meal.

I always loved black beans.  Whenever I am in Miami I get them.  There are no Cuban restaurants where I live, so it is nice to know how to make them your self.  Very authentic and delicious!

I only used about 2 tbsp. of oil to save calories & fat. I cooked these almost 2 hours and did not use pimentos. We had this over white rice, it was a yummy, inexpensive, healthy dinner.

Served with BBQ chicken and basmanti rice.  I used 3 cans of black beans and omitted all the water.  However I did dilute the paste with 1 c or so of water to get a consistency that I liked. Next time I will use less tomato paste.  Also added 1 1/2 t cumin and added 1/2 t more cidar vinegar, plus I doubled the sugar.  Omitted the pimentos and cut the salt to 1t.  Absolutely wonderful with the rice.

When I made this, I used 3 cans of black beans, drained and rinsed.  I also put in a HUGE tablespoonful of Biryani curry paste.  I decreased the water by 1 cup, and served this dish over Basmati rice, with a pork tenderloin.  The combination of the beans, rice and pork was a great compliment to one another

Flavorful and easy.  I served it over brown rice with shredded Monterrey Jack cheese.  Next time I'll reduce the water by 1 cup.

The flavor is good made exactly as written.  It did take the beans longer than stated to be tender.  I was afraid that maybe there would be too much salt and pepper, but that was not the case.  If one used canned beans, it would be way too salty.  A really good meatless dish.

So yummy! I halved the recipe (only had 1/2 pound of black beans!), it turned out wonderful!! Didnt have pimentos on hand. Served over white rice and added some baked chicken breast. VERY GOOD!!

This recipe is simple to follow and absolutely delicious. I did not stray from the original recipe and I am very happy with how it turned out. I mix the beans with rice and put an egg on top with some Salsa Lizano. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Halfway through the recipe I realized that I was out of tomato paste so I had to substitute a can of condensed tomato soup (not the same but I had no choice).  I cut back a little on the chicken broth that I used to replace the water because of that and left out the sugar all together.  My family loved this.

I followed the recipe and the beans were pretty darn bland.  I had to add a lot more spices to give this some flavor.  It came out tasty but I think you need to double or even triple the spices for this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe - cheap, easy, healthy and vegetarian. 

I used dried beans and soaked them over night, which worked fine. I found I had to cook the beans a little longer than suggested to get them tender, but otherwise, I made no changes. Next time, I may add some spices to give it more kick. 

This is a recipe that is worth making ahead. You need some time to soak and cook the beans anyway, plus a few days in the fridge really enhances the flavor. I'll be making this again!

Beans were very tasty, however, took much longer to cook than recipe called for.  Next time I will put them in the slow cooker for the day.  We did add some creole seasoning to spice it up a bit as was a bit bland for ouf family.

I attemptd fresh cooked beans on several occasions and it always ended the same...in the GARBAGE!  I was really hesitant to give it another shot but I figured why not.  It was a bit time consuming but worth it.  I cooked them for over 4 hours on a low fire.  If you follow the cook time your beans will be somewhat hard.  I like my beans really tender.  It was a really good recipe.  I did not give it 5 stars because I did feel the need to tweek it a bit after tasting it.  I decided to add an additional 1/2 tspn of Salt as I found it just a bit bland...I am not big on salt so 1/2 tspn did the trick.  Also, I found the flavor to be quite good but it was missing something...so I figured I'de add Cilantro, because that's the way my family cooks beans...and low and behold...IT WAS PERFECT!!!!  Everyone at dinner was amazed by the taste and my son ate 3 servings.  This is my worst critic people.  Remember the beans that ended up in the Garbage earlier?  He hated them that much and for him to eat 3 servings is unheard of.  My entire family competes for his approval in the beans department and Mommie went from the bottom of the list to the top with this recipe!!!!  You have got to try this!

these were just OK to me.  I love black beans, and I guess I'm just not used to them with the tomato sauce.  I prefer a more lime-based mexican black bean.

I found this recipe really bland, and it took about three times as long to cook as it should have.  I soaked the beans overnight, cooked them on high in a crockpot for 3 hours, and it still took 3-4 more hours on the stovetop for them to cook.  The results were unremarkable, but they were pretty good on top of nachos.

Oh lordy this was good! I used canned beans, undrained and served over rice. My fiance loved it! It's going in my file! I added a bit more garlic, cayenne, and onion just to suit our taste better.

I didn't find this recipe until my beans were almost cooked.  Due to scarce ingredients, I didn't add pimentos and used two chopped small brown onions and 1/2 red bell pepper instead of a green pepper.  Delicious on corn tortillas with chopped lettuce and sour cream.

Decent recipe, but NOT Cuban style.  Cuban black beans are very simply seasoned and served over hot white rice--maybe with some chopped onions/cilantro/parsley but never with salsa, cheese and sour cream! This sounds more like a Mexican style way of serving beans!

Although I didn't have the means to make these exact, they were delicious!  I would not take out the paste as others suggested.  It is part of the uniquness of this recipe.  Also, if you are a huge garlic fan like me, add extra!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has quickly become an absolute favorite in my house!  I made a few changes , mostly based on the ingredients I had in my house.  I used three 15 oz cans of black beans, NO water, NO oil (alot of unecessary  fat), and one 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also used balsamic vinegar and added red peppers and frozen corn.  YUM!  I serve it with fried plantains.

This was SO GOOD.  I made this for some friends and it was a definite hit.  I used 1/2 bell pepper and 1/2 onion instead of whole ones, and by accident I bought a 2oz. jar of pimentos instead of 4oz. and it still came out very flavourful.  Not spicy and definitely a little sweet--very tasty!  I definitely want to make them again.  Oh, and it is good to use either salsa or sour cream as a garnish.

Wonderful and easy.  I cook the beans for 1 1/2 hours or until soft, then add all the other ingredients and cook for 45 minutes to an hour more.  Instead of pimentoes I use chopped green olives.  Instead of suger I use Splenda. Thank you for a great recipe!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I always forget to soak beans overnight, so I covered the beans with water and brought them almost to a boil, then turned off the heat and let them soak for about 2 hours. Then drained the beans and continued with the recipe. I used only half the oil and only 4 cups of water, added a bit more onion and let it simmer most of the afternoon. Served over quinoa, instead of rice, with a salad made a hearty vegetarian meal. I will definitely add this to my list of "keeper" vegetarian recipes that I'm working into my repertoire.

I love this recipe.  My husband is cuban, so I figured I would try to make some of his favorite foods.  It is great!  I altered the recipe a little bit.  I used the 3 cans of black beans and only used about 3 cans of water.  I dont like them to be soupy.  I also used olives instead of the pimentos.  It seemed to be a hit.

Wow, very good! I had a bag of red kidney beans, so I used them instead of black beans. Other than that I did not change anything, and it was so good over rice. Just right amount of seasoning. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy Yummy Yummy.  I served these with a green salad and fried plantains, and everyone raved.  I even served them to some friends who describe themselves as carnivores and they had no problem with a vegetarian meal once they tasted these beans.  Both of them wanted the recipe.  Thanks!

Very good, BUT the water is not 5 cups for already cooked/soaked beans. That’s only for dry beans.

phenomenal. first time with making black beans without blowing off the jackets.  did so in a stove top pressure cooker with 5c water and timed for 20 minutes and air cooled. fantastic with some salt, aromatics ( 5 cloves garlic,  1 tablespoon oil, 3 bay leaf, one onion quartered.)  Perfectly cooked as it came out with lots of stock left over. I simmered Cuban sauce independently of beans as I was leery of  over cooking perfectly done beans.  as I simmered sauce I kept adding bean stock for flavor.  When peppers almost cooked, I added beans and simmered 10 more min. FAB!  don't know if this is Cuban or no, but it is a keeper recipe AND I learned new skill.  win win

These beans were delicious. The flavor was deep and rich, but not heavy. The spice level was perfect for me and my family. And the aroma filled the whole house. The scent wafting out of the windows made the UPS driver sad that he didn't get to have dinner at my house.  I made them as a side for "Cuban Pork Roast I".  With the left overs, I chopped up some of the meat and added it to the beans  and froze flat in zip-locks.  Everything froze, thawed, and reheated well.  I'm excited to add a new recipe to the mix, and have something that I can put in the deep freeze for a quick meal when I'm feeling lazy!

we really enjoy this! I follow the recipe exactly, but you have to remember to adjust the water if using canned beans - I just add enough until it looks about the consistency I want. And, I'd keep the sugar. Generally I don't cook with sugar, but it adds a certain umpf to the dish in this one and plays really well with the vinegar.

This recipe was amazing (and cheap)! I used 2 cans of beans, drained and rinsed, and 2 cups of water. I omitted the pimento and added extra veggies - 1 green bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, 1 jalapeno, 1 white onion, and 1 vidalia onion. I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and added some cumin and smoked paprika. I simmered it for 2 hours and served over leftover brown rice and topped with shredded cheddar. Next time I might add a dash of cayenne.my husband and I finished this off in 2 days!

This is a really good soup, and my husband really loves it. I didn't have pimentos so I substituted with paprika. Turned out awesome!  I already made this recipe twice, and it tastes even better if you add sour cream and cheese on top, with some chopped green onion :)))

I thought this was the best dish i ever had. Though there really was no need for the tomato paste, sugar, or that much pepper.  I would give this a good 5 stars. a good reminder for making this dish it tastes better with canned black beans [:

Great basic recipe. Fry one chopped onion, one chopped pepper, four stalks chopped celery, and 12 cloves garlic (don't be afraid). Add to 2# rinsed dried beans, a couple bay leaves, and water to cover in the crockpot. No soaking necessary. Add vinegar at the end. No tomato paste or sugar. Delish. Once I also threw in a ham steak and a couple leftover grilled chopped chicken breasts for my hungry teens. This is a low cost, low effort meal everyone will love. This is one of a few slow cooker bean dishes in regular Sunday rotation in my home.

Used 3 cans pre-prepared beans in place of dried beans and eliminated the water.  Used half a 6oz can tomoato paste and it turned out really nicely.

Served it for a crowd for a Cuban themed dinner.  My only issue was that due to the tomato base, most people thought it was chili--I don't know why that bothered me, but it did. It was pretty tomato-y, so I might use less tomato paste next time.  I was informed that "real" Cubans would never add tomato paste to their beans.

Added jalapeno and some hot sauce, too, because that's just how I roll. I'm sure "real" Cubans would take issue with that, too.  
I used 2 cans of rinsed and drained black beans and skipped step 1 altogether.  About 2 cups of chicken broth for the water.

The people I served it for are wimps when it comes to spice, and no one thought it was too spicy, even with the jalapenos and hot sauce.  None left over, and everyone said they liked it.

I messed up and only got about 6 hours of soak time - these still turned out delicious. Since the vinegar type wasn't specified, I used cider. The girlfriend wants me to make these weekly now, and I am willing to oblige.

Outstanding!!! Originally, I planned on making them for myself, but after smelling them cook my husband and kids wanted to eat them too. I'm a picky eater, but I loved these. They were very filling, and the leftovers kept well in the fridge.  My new favorite recipe! This is the only recipe I could serve where my husband wouldn't ask where the meat was.

This particular recipe comes the closest to the traditional Cuban black bean soup, but no sugar should be used. make sure the olive oil is the best you can get your hands on, it will definitely make a difference. And instead of using canned beans, use a pressure cooker if you're in a hurry. Again, the difference in flavor will be like night and day.

As far as bean dishes go, this is pretty amazing. I used canned black beans and it worked out great.  I found it to be really flavorful and I definitely wouldn't add any extra spice.

I made this with canned beans and because of this it was more saucy than it probably should have been. Next time I will follow the other tips of using less water. I also omitted the bell pepper and pimentos (only because I didn't have any) Regardless I thought this was delicious and would definitly make again.

This was one of the first recipes that I tried on this site quite a few years ago and I've made it many times since. It has great flavor, which is surprising since there are not many spices. I never add the pimentos, but otherwise always make the recipe just like it says.

I prepared this dish last evening with a few alterations to suit my diet restrictions & personal tastes.  The green pepper was replaced by a red pepper, the garlic by 3 large seeded japaleno peppers & low sodum beef broth was substituted for the water.  The salt was omitted & the pepper doubled up.  This dish was great & tasty and still not too spicy.  I did find that it need longer cookinng so it was simmered for 3 hours instead of the suggested 1 1/2.  It was served over brown rice and we are happy that there is some left over to go with our supper tonight.

One of our favorite recipes.  I make it at least once a month and serve leftovers with sauteed veggies as fajitas.  One important note: Cook the beans COMPLETELY before adding tomatoes or vinegar.  Other than that, it's awesome without any changes.

My family loved this dish.  I had to cook the beans longer than the recipe stated because they were still a bit crunchy.  Also, everything turned black, so next time, I think I'll cook the beans with the five cups of water, then rinse them and continue with the recipe.

I messed this up when I cooked it - I didn't make the beans tender enough - but the flavoring was just right. I just need to cook it properly next time!

Very good!  Used dried beans & the texture is much better.  Cooked for about 2 hours & used a bit less sugar & sliced a jalapeno to put in it.  Great for burritos with some cheese for healthy low carb work meal (using low carb or high fiber tortillas.

Very good. I used half the recipe and cooked for 1 1/2 hours. It was still hard so next time I'll cook for longer. Only modification I made was to use tomato sauce and not tomato paste because I had an open can of sauce already. Served with "Cuban Ropa Vieja."

This recipe is great! I used less oil (about 2 T total), and added a little hot sauce for a kick. I also added about a 1 T each of garlic powder and onion powder. Turned out delicious. My 2 year old ate all of hers and asked for more! Oh, and I only had to simmer it for about an hour, which was a nice surprise because I expected it to take longer.

Wonderful flavor and so easy, I planned on using fresh beans but forgot to soak them the night before. I used canned beans and I don't see how they could be any better with fresh, they were delicious.

I made these beans for some vegetarian friends we had over for dinner. This was an awesome and easy recipe. The beans came out perfect. My family loves meat, but they have now requested these beans in our dinner rotation

My family loves black beans.  I will try this recipe since it looks very basic and similar to the one my mother in law made.  Using extra virgin Spanish olive oil is a must to get the correct flavor.  Cuban beans are not suppose to be hot, just very garlickly/savory. A tsp of oregano and a bay leaf also works in these beans.  Nothing hot or too spicy.

Yum!  I followed the recipe without changing a thing (used the dry beans).  Absolutely wonderful over a bed of steamed, long-grain white rice!  I had no problem with the amount of water as the beans soaked it right in -- you have to let this dish cook for the amount of time that the recipes calls for.

Good, but i had to add more salt. I also added cumin and oregano for some more flavor. Not exactly authentic, but close.

These garnered mixed reviews in our house. My partner liked them, but I found them pretty flavorless. If you doctor them up with some more spices, they'd be OK, but then again, if you do that, why bother with a recipe in the first place? I rather wish I hadn't -- could have made better beans using my own improvisational cooking skills!

Great recipe! I didn't have any black beans so I used a mixture of kidney and pinto beans. Instead of cooking it on a stove, I assembled all the ingredients (minus the tomatoes and vinegar) in a crockpot and left it on while I was at work. I mixed in the rest of the ingredients after the beans were cooked. I froze the leftovers and re-heated them later and they were still delicious. I think this will be even better next time when I actually use black beans!

Very good. Just what I was looking for as a side dish with a Cuban flair. Thanks for sharing!
