This recipe is wonderful! I'm not really a very good cook and even I couldn't screw this one up. :) I think the level of taste really depends on what kind of curry you use, and you could definitely spice it up with spicier curry. But, as is, it made for a great, light, tasty dinner. The sauce was delicious, I felt like I was in a restaurant. Put it over a bed of jasmine rice and you'd have a great dinner.

The first time I made this recipe I found it to be bland.  I added Cumin and cilantro to taste.  I reserved some of the fresh cilantro to sprinkle when I plated the dish, Also gave a sprinkle of fresh coconut as well.  Used Jasmatti rice and it was delicious.  Went from 3 stars to 5 stars!

This dish was VERY bland and colorless. I believe it needs a lot of tweaking to be a keeper.

I was hoping for a new curry recipe.  This is very bland and tasteless.  I won't make it again.

I loved this with the following changes:
I cooked the onions with (a lot more than it called for) curry and a pinch of salt in a 50-50 mix of peanut and olive oil. While the chicken was cooking in the resulting liquid, the onions were moved to a small glass dish and mixed with about a cup of shredded coconut flakes (I had no coconut milk). When the chicken was nearly ready to reintroduce the onion mixture, I added about a half cup of Smuckers natural peanut butter, stirred to coat, liquifying the pb and thickening the sauce. I returned the onions to the pan, tossed on a healthy sprinkle of garlic powder, a chunk of cinnamon stick, and a fair bit of cayenne pepper for zip, then added some Progresso chix stock to allow for some simmering activity. As an after thought, I tossed in some frozen peas to break up the monotonous curry color (also cooled it down to eat faster!). It thickened up over the next half hour or so and we ate it over rice.

This is nice if you're looking for something simple and not overwelming in taste. My boyfriend and I didn't love or hate it, but I probably wont make it again.

Thanks LisaMB.  Quick and Easy! I made no changes and it's simply great.  Served it with whole grained rice then again with egg noodles and a green veggie for color.  My wife loved it!

We loved this and could not stop eating it. I made the following changes: Doubled the amount of curry and added 2 t. cumin, salted chicken chunks before adding to pan. While cooking onions and toasting spices, I added chicken stock as the pan got dry.  I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce and a handful of raisins with the coconut milk -so good. The final 5 minutes I added 1 generous teaspoon of cayenne pepper-perfect!  Served it on rice and topped with peanuts and cilantro. Definitely had a THAI twist. YUM

I don't cook often, so the simplicity of this recipe was appealing to me. It turned out well and tasted great- subtle but not at all bland. Enjoyed it with jasmine rice. Thanks for posting this recipe!
