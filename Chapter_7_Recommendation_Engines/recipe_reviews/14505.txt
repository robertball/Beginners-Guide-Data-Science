I went ahead and put the onions directly on the grill - I sliced them on the thick side so I wouldn't have to hover too much. I also sliced a head of garlic and threw it on as well and it was delicious. I started with olive oil and put a bit of butter on before serving.

This is a great complement to any meal on the grill!  I tend to use olive oil to lighten it up, sprinkle with salt and fresh pepper, all in a simple foil packet.  TIP:  Put the packet on the grill when you light it.  It will have a good head start from the rest of your meal, which it needs since they take longer to cook through and caramelize!

I cut my sweet onions in half, peeled them,  cut a piece off the bottom so they would sit flat & then cut an X in them, not quite cutting them through. Placed them on the foil, dotted them w/ butter & sprinkled them w/ parmesan cheese & salt & pepper. While they cooked, they fanned out some & the butter was able to reach the inner layers.  When removing them from the foil, I was careful in lifting them so that they retained their shape. These were a great side for Grilled Fusion Pork Chops (from this site)...thanks for the recipe!

We slice these thick drizzle with a little olive oil, some garlic powder and paprika and place them directly on the grill.  No packet necessary.  The go great with steak.

Great, especially if you are a onion lover, which I am.. I have also done this in the oven and they are really good too. Also whenI want them in a hurry and very tender I will put them in a plastic cooking bag, and they get so tender so quick.  Perfect as a side for a good steak.  thanks for the recipe.

Great easy recipe.  We did find out cooking it for a bit more than an hour is what is needed.  Next time I'll add some herbs or lemon pepper to the butter.

We use this recipe camping, all the time.  Great with steaks.  The onions can be cooked right on the coals, as well (just make sure they're securly wrapped)  I find that just a pinch of sugar in the packet brings out the onion's natural sweetness.

Cooking anything in foil on a grill is steaming, not grilling.  I agree with the previous comments about either slicing them thick, or cutting them in wedges, then brushing with butter or olive oil.  I like to add just a touch of tarragon to give hem a little extra sweetness..

Only giving it a four because I made a few changes. I halved my onions and then scored them into eighths not going all the way through the bottoms. I also used canola oil not butter. But they were delicious! Very sweet amd carmelized we had them on top of italian sausage sandwiches that we grilled

Delicious.  Could eat them straight off the grill!  I used 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter to make them a little lighter.  Love the charred grilled taste.
