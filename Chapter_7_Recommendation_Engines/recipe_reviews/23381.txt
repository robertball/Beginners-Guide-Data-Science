It's an ok recipe, but it's a bit dry which overpowers the peanut butter taste.  I would make them again, but I would probably increase the peanut butter by a 1/4 cup.

pretty good, not too sweet, I did roll balls into chopped cocktail peanuts which added a salty note...I'll make them again for sure, maybe add sugar to the chopped nuts

These get a middling rating because, like another reviewer, I found them to be way too crumbly - fragile, in fact.
The taste was pretty good, but somewhat mild. I did give a few of the best ones to The Woman I Love, and she thought they were great.
On the plus side, these are quick and easy to make. I was in a hurry and didn't mix the wet and dry ingredients exactly as given, so hopefully that didn't affect my results; I did use all the correct ingredients and amounts, though.
This made two batches for me. For the second batch, I used a greased (with butter-flavored cooking spray) cookie sheet, which was a mistake, as the cookies burned a bit. The ungreased, non-stick cookie sheet I used for my first batch worked best.

I did add 1/4 cup more PB as a previous reviewer stated they would do. The recipe was a little confusing because it says to beat IN the egg, etc, and then add it to the bowl of creamy PB mixture. I slowly added the dry into the wet and also did add just a splash of vanilla. I thought these were GREAT. They had that softness but at the same time a little crunchy and the texture was just what I like in a PB cookie. Melt in your mouth. Thumbs up.

Not bad, but too crumbly. I rolled mine in sugar, and still too plain.

I was very disappointed with these cookies. I saw them and thought wow this would be so much fun to make and they were, but just as most of the previous reviews state, the cookies are extremely dry! In fact, in my opinion they were nearly inedible... Quit sad but true
