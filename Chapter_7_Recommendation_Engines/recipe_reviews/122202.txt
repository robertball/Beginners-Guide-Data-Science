This stew is fabulous.  I add about 4 diced red potatoes & let it simmer & it becomes a nice thick broth.  Love it! Have already made it over & over again. Thanks!

I have been looking for a tasty way to use leftover brats and this is very good.  My husband really loved it.  We both added more garlic...I will add a full teaspoon of garlic powder to the stew the next time I make it.

I sort of winged this recipe after I forgot to pick up cabbage at the store.  I added Yukon Gold potatoes and my boyfriend is still raving about it.  Definitely something nice to eat on a chilly evening in front of the fire.

I used turkey bratwurst instead of the regular kind.  It turned out great.  My husband, who doesn't usually like turkey bratwurst couldn't tell and he loved the soup.  After the soup was cooked, in a small pan, I sauted some fresh minced garlic in some butter, added some "better than bullion" soup base (~tsp), and ~1TBS flour.  After cooking a minute, I added a little broth from the soup to smooth it out, and added it to the soup for a tad more flavor and thickness.  It's not necessary, but I like it that way.  By the way, I'm not a bratwurst fan, but I liked the soup as well.

This was pretty yummo, and very easy to fix.  I did not have cabbage, so I used canned sauerkraut and only left it in 5 minutes before adding beans, and brats.

This recipe was bland to my taste as written; so I added a can of chopped tomatoes, more garlic, tsp. of ground pepper and a pinch of cayenne.  Maybe it's the cold weather, but this seemed a bit better!

This soup was wonderful! I didn't use the beans but instead used 5 medium red skin potatoes. It reminded me of the soup from olive garden. Zuppa. Will definitely be making this again. Will be a great winter recipe. Thanks!

I'm sure it would be great as written, but  I substituted collard greens for the cabbage and cannellini beans for the great northerns, because that's what I had at hand. I also used plenty of fresh basil and 2 garlic cloves.  Hubby loved it.  I threw it all in a pot and simmered about an hour because collards take longer to cook than cabbage.  It would also be fine in the crockpot.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for the first time today.  My picky son and husband love it.  The recipe called for cabbage but I did not have any on hand so I subsituted with potatoes.  It still turned out great.  Who would have thought to use Brats in a stew.  I will make this again.

I used spinach rather than cabbage b/c we don't like cabbage. Turned out very well and was great for a cold day.

Fresh green beans were a nice addition to this stew - and I used navy beans instead of great northern.  Probably did add more seasoning (not different, just more).  I added additional water as I thought the veggies needed more liquid to cook in; then I was afraid the stew would be to liquid-y, but after simmering for at least 20 minutes if not more it was a just-right consistency.  It was really good served with cornbread.

Two cans of chicken broth was not enough, more like 4 cans. Also, I had to bring it back up to a boil for the cabbage to cook. I used fresh basil, and went heavy on the other spices and added black pepper. Other than that, this was very good. Like a boiled dinner without the potatoes.

Delicious, added some red potatoes too! I am a seasoning freak so I added a lot more seasonings and even some creole seasoning which went well.

Wow, this was really really good! I pretty much followed the recipe except that I used a 32 oz box of chicken broth and I added a bit more garlic powder and also some chopped garlic.  I thought I would need more broth but I did not.   The timing on the recipe was perfect. The only thing is, if you're on the fence about beans add one can at a time ... you might not want that second can (I did use two cans and it was good).  Definitely a keeper and I would think it would be good for company, too!  Served with homemade cornbread.

I only used four bratwursts as that is all I had but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and my husband and I both loved.  He muttered under his breath a few times "this soup is really good".  I've never been successful at making great soup on my own so this recipe is very appreciated.  I used large organic, grass fed bratwurst so just using four was plenty for us.

I love all these ingredients so I thought this would be great.  I didn't think it was very good.  It did taste a little better on the 2nd day.

This was really good! I didn't have cabbage so I used swiss chard from my garden instead and that worked really well. I also added 1 tsp of italian seasoning (because it seemed like a good idea - and it was!). My brats were "uber garlic brats" from a local meat shop and since they were super garlicy I didn't add more garlic. They were delicious in this. If I were using regular brats I would have bumped up the garlic.

Super YUMMY!!  I cut the vegetables and bratwurst into bit-sized pieces and used potatoes as we didn't have any cabbage on hand.  I will definitely be making this again!  Great for left-overs after grilling brats!

Excellent recipe, this has now been added to our recipe rotation! I added Yukon Gold potatoes to the mix, no celery, and only one can of beans. I used crushed rosemary and cayenne over thyme and basil to really bring out the flavor and the bratwurst were cooked just beforehand in a skillet, beer flavored. I cooked this longer than the recipe calls for, gives the flavors a lot more time to mix together and softens the carrots and potatoes nicely.

We softened the celery, onion and minced real garlic in a bit of oil, and added home canned tomatoes along with some V8 juice, as it was kind of lacking in liquid. I thought it was just OK that night.     Let it sit in the fridge overnight, and wow, I couldn't stop eating it. Like a lot of soups and stews, it was much better the second day.    It cries out for more black pepper!

This was really good & easy! I used  Johnsonville smoked bratwurst links & subbed some skin-on baby red potatoes for half of the beans, and let sit overnight. Both my husband & I were very pleased, it's a keeper & we'll be making it many times again. This will be great on chilly fall or winter nights, thanks for sharing this recipe!

I'm a soup lover and I love bratwursts, I also like putting cabbage in my soups... I can't believe I never thought of doing this on my own! This was really good, I will definitely make this again. I also used potatoes instead of beans, which worked really well.

I made this recipe for the guys at work and man did they eat it up.  I too did not add cabbage but did add red potato's; instead of basil I added Italian Seasoning. What a delicious recipe!!  I also made this in a crock-pot on slow over night and into the afternoon the next day.  Was it ever good.

used twice as much meat. punctured holes in and boiled bratwurst in GMD for about 10 minutes then added the remaining juice into the soup. added amazing flavor and thickened the soup with 1/4 cup flour. super nummy for those cold nights

Exceptional stew.  Everyone loved it.  I did use about a tablespoon of the seasonings because it seemed like it would be too bland as written.  Would be great even without the sausage.

I used a 48 oz. jar of beans, since that's what I had and I didn't feel like scooping 18 oz. out for another use... ha ha  I also needed 16 oz. more chicken broth, perhaps because of the extra beans.  I added perhaps one more clove of garlic.  All that said, this was a fantabulous recipe!  My family loved it, even those who don't like beans or cabbage!  It was even better the second day, and that's all it lasted -- 2 days.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I was pretty skeptical at how few ingredients were included, but the stew was great!  I hate bratwurst but my husband loves them, so this gave me a great meal for him to enjoy the meat and I was satisfied with the vegetables and soup.

We made this in the crock pot. It cooked all day and was delicious. We used pre-cooked brats and a package of frozen carrots instead of fresh ones. We also put Spicy mustard in our bowls and it was amazing! Next time we are kicking it up with Horseradish.

This was an easy, tasty stew.  I did substitute potatoes for the cabbage, due to family's preference, and added 1 can of northern beans and 1 can of kidney beans.

Delicious!!!  I wanted to prepare this ahead of time so after I simmered everything for 15 minutes, I transferred to the crockpot for 2 hours on low.  I used 4 red potatoes instead of cabbage as suggested by others.  You can use just about any kind of meat... we used chicken sausage.  YUM!

Delicious - the combination of veggies, legumes, spices and brats makes a meal the whole family can enjoy.  I substituted one of the cans of great northern beans with a can of dark red kidney beans for some extra color.

One of the best recipes I've made from this site.  The changes I made were very few.  I browned the brats, then removed and sauteed the carrots, onions and celery.  Also added about a tsp. of minced garlic.  I also added 2 small Yukon Gold potatoes chopped up.  It was a very yummy soup.  I will definitely make it again.  I think it would be good with Kielbasa.  Next time I think I might try using boneless skinless chicken breast as the meat base.

Yum!   I made this in the crockpot using canned carrots and kielbasa since i couldn't find bratwurst.   had to add an extra can of broth (probably cuz i added too much cabbage and freeze dried beans) but it was SO AWESOME!

I had some leftover brats and didn't know what to do with them until I came upon this.  I came out great and I am serving it for supper tonight.  I wouldn't call it a stew as it was not thickened with anything.  Maybe that is why others added potato.  I liked it just the way it was written.

I was skeptical that this would be flavorful because of its simplicity, but it was truly tasty.  Very Easy to prepare and I didn't change anything (very unlike me) so, as is, this is a nice recipe.  I will make this again.

I would give this a 3.5 stars if I could.  This was easy to do and came together quickly.  It is a pretty economical meal to boot.  I'm just not a big fan of brats, but the family liked it.  Thanks for sharing.

LOVED IT! I boiled my brats in beer beforehand for extra flavor and used italian seasoning in place of the thyme and basil. I also did not cut my veggies into chunks, but instead into thick slices, which made it easier to eat in the end. This smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted even better! I will be making this often, I'm sure! Thanks for posting. :)

lol I have to chuckle at some of these comments.  This STEW is delicious as is!  First of all, it's not a soup, so there's no need to add extra broth.  And secondly, you can call it a stew, because all stew means is solid ingredients that have been cooked in liquid.  And thirdly, all those people who are saying it lacks seasoning have clearly had their taste buds destroyed by over-processed salty food.  A half tsp. salt plus the brats = PLENTY of salt and the other seasonings are just right! (okay, I admit I cut the thyme in half, but only b/c I hate dried thyme and I didn't want to go out to the garden at 11 pm to cut fresh).  This recipe needs no changes except a turn of the pepper mill over your bowl.  Next time I may use someone else's idea of browning the sliced brats first and then briefly sauteing the veggies in the fat--that's a good idea.  Of all the homemade soups and stews I've made, this is the only one that tasted good right out of the pot.  I can't imagine what it'll taste like after a night spent in the fridge!!!!  So delicious!  Forget the tomatoes, forget the potatoes, make it as written and enjoy!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Really delicious. Repalced cabbage for 6-8 small potatoes, 1 tsp of garlic powder, pepper and salted to taste (needed more).

This was a hearty and filling stew. I used light polish kielbasa instead of brats which reduced the fat but it really changed the flavor of the stew. I have to try it again using brats.

This was okay and I will probably not make again.  The flavor of the bratwurst was okay in the soup but the actual pieces of brats seemed not to mix very well with the stew. I thought this was going to be better, kinda' disappointed =/

Great stew, but I used chicken brats and let's just say, when eating brats, you want the real deal.  Yes, the real deal has a lot more fat, but what the heck...sometimes you just gotta live a little.

Followed one suggestion and added a pint of homecanned tomatoes.  Used venison bratwurst, browned first and grease removed and upped the garlic.  Very tasty, filling and healthy.  I'm glad cool weather is beginning to filter in because recipes like this one beg for a chill in the air.

This recipe was very disappointing.  The dish was bland and lacked flavor.  I even went back to confirm I hadn't missed a key ingredient. I'm surprised because this is the first recipe I found that I would never prepare again.

When I went to the grocery I thought I had chicken broth, so I substituted 2 cans of cream of chicken soup with 3 cans of water.  I was nervous of the outcome, but my husband and I both thought it was good.  He said, "Actually this is really good!".  He is accustomed to my experiments.

Easy to prepare, I browned the brats a little then pulled them out of the pan and then sweat the veggies. I always have a way of making more than what I should so I added two large boxes of chicken broth. The thyme and basil really add flavor and I used a little Cavenders Greek seasoning to it. Can't wait til tomorrow after it has marinated all night. It is an outstanding and simple recipe... Delicious... Good job!
