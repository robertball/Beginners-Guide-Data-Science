The very best minestrone ever!  A huge success with the family and guests.  Add more tomato paste for a thicker, more stewlike minestrone. I also added a can of green beans, used kidney instead of cannellini beans, and used shredded spinach instead of cabbage.  If you can find flavored macaroni, such as garlic or roasted pepper, it will inhance the flavor.  Also, the parmesan truly inhances the flavor, and is not to be left out!  Enjoy!

Delicious and so easy!  I used Swanson's organic chicken broth and a tomato paste w/ italian seasoning.  I also used a good 2 T of the tomato paste.  My husband wanted twice the noodles so against my better judgement I added 1 c and as I suspected the soup ended up pretty thick by the time the noodles were done - it's kind of like a chowder now!  Also, the noodles are a bit overcooked and gluey.  Next time I'll cook the noodles separately and add them to the soup so the soup maintains more of its liquid.  Will definitely make this again. UPDATE:  I froze about a quart of this for about 6 mos and it held up great and still tasted good!

FANTASTIC!! Instead of using regular chicken broth, I first roasted the Christmas day turkey bones, then boiled them in water for an hour with a couple of carrots, an onion, a few bay leaves and some pepper corns, to make a rich delicious broth. I also added some left-over turkey meat, and used a can of kidney beans. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter. The result was amazing - a rich, tasty hearty soup, just perfect for a Winter day. I will definitely be making this again! (3.17.06 This recipe has gradually evolved into an 'Everything but the kitchen sink' kind of soup - it's great for using up all those sad-looking veggies that take up fridge space, those 90% empty boxes of pasta in the cupboard, and the half can of whatever beans you didn't use. It doesn't matter what you use, it always tastes great!)

I made this recipe and admittedly tweaked it quite a lot.  However, I do think I came up with something very similar to the submitter’s version.  I used olive oil instead of margarine and only one T. not four.  I increased the celery to a generous 1/2 cup and bumped the carrots up to about 3/4 cup.  I thought the amount of cabbage was negligible, and I didn’t have it anyway, so I left that out.  I used diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, and instead of potatoes, I used a combination of zucchini and yellow squash.  Lastly I subbed ditalini pasta for the elbows.  As for the process, I tweaked that a bit as well.  I sautéed the onion, celery and carrots for about 5 minutes, adding the garlic during the final 30 seconds.  I then added the other ingredients, except for the beans and pasta.  I gently simmered for 30 minutes, which was probably a bit too long.  I would cut that back to 10-15 minutes next time, so the zucchini won’t be overcooked.  I cooked my pasta separately and added it along with the beans and some fresh basil and just heated it through.  Garnished with fresh parsley.  My result was a delicious, veggie-packed soup that was low in fat and calories, but very satisfying!!  We loved it!!  UPDATE 3/26/13: I made this again as before but this time threw in some coarsely chopped fresh spinach at the very end, which was a very nice addition.

This is very good. I subsituted kidney beans for cannelini beans and a tablespoon of ketchup for the tomato paste. The sprinkling of parmesan is important; I thought the plain soup needed more salt, but that is okay. I will definitely make this again.

This soup is the best!  A big time saver is to chop the carrots, celery and onions in a food mill and then sautee.  I added one teaspoon of basil and one of origano and Italian stewed tomatoes already seasoned with herbs.  I cut back on the potatoes and pasta, added one zuccinni and some fresh string beans.  Had it for dinner with freshly made garlic bread, toasted.  Don't forget the parmison cheese.  My husband really loved it and so did I.

This recipe is delicious!  I sauteed some chopped bacon first until it was a little crispy, drained off all but 2 tbsp. of bacon fat and sauteed the vegetables in that and added the bacon back into the soup at the end.  Thanks for submitting the recipe, it's DELICIOUS!!!!!

Pretty good. I missed the green beans, zucchini, and kidney beans I usually see in minestrone, so next time I'd add them. I'd also add other Italian herbs in addition to parsley. This recipe is versatile enough to handle some subs and still come out great. My subs were navy beans instead of cannellini, celery root instead of celery, and chard instead of cabbage. I also used only half the salt called for, and used whole wheat shells instead of elbow macaroni. I find that whole wheat pasta holds up better in the leftover soup.

My husband asked for Minestroni soup for dinner and I found this recipe.  Wonderful.  I had everything on hand except I used fresh parsley and petite diced tomatoes.  My kids ate it all up hence, the 5 star rating.
Thanks!

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!
I used organic chicken Better then Bouillon for the stock, added zucchini, used a half a head of cabbage, doubled the pasta and added a full quart more water (the pasta soaks up a lot). I also didnt add the extra salt as the Better then Bouillon is pretty salty. This makes a ton of soup and it is soooo good- i will be putting this recipe in my regular rotation. I served it with an organic garlic baguette for the dippin'!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love this recipe. I used butter, vegetable broth, Barilla wheat pasta (more than noted, probably about a cup) and added a lot more cabbage (I got a small bag of shredded cole slaw cabbage and added about half of that). It was a hearty, filling soup and very easy - a keeper for sure.

Yumm, made this morning...and just tasted it in the afternoon. it is sooo good, i used 200 grams of tomato sauce instead of the paste. garbanzo beans, more broth (1.5 quarts, the pasta absorbs water so it is still thick). i used spinach instead of cabbage.. added a bit of oregano and dry basil. very very good cheap soup! oh, i omitted the potatoes and added zucchini, more celery and carrots.. this made about 8 servings (240 calories each!)

I used this recipe as a guide, being that I didn't quite have everything on hand. I shredded leftover Thanksgiving turkey and added it to the soup. I used beef bouillon cubes and water in lieu of the chicken broth. I subbed garlic chili sauce and medium taco sauce for the tomato paste. I used black beans, corn, carrots, parsnips, celery, diced tomatoes, onions, red potatoes, and added some extra spices, such as a bay leaf and some adobo. This made an excellent spicier version of minestrone. I served this with a side of fresh baked cornbread.

I used seashell pasta because I had a half a box leftover from another meal.  I cooked it separately from the soup and let people add as much or as little as they wanted to avoid the pasta soaking up all the broth.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato paste.  I used fresh white beans from a friends garden, added a few green beans and about a handful of baby spinach I had in my fridge that needed using.  As for seasonings, I added a pinch of dried oregano, 2 tablespoons fresh parsley and about 1 tablespoon fresh basil.  Really tasty meal, great accompaniment for the chilly weather outside.

This is so good! I realized too late that I'm out of onions, so I chopped up a red bell pepper. I had a small squash & zucchini that needed to be used so I also added them. I used petite diced tomatoes and added black pepper. I left out the cabbage & pasta. Very flavorful & easy to play around with.

very, very good! Husband kept talking about it. Perfect on a cold night, with a slice of good bread with butter. I used spinach instead of cabbage (more traditional), and tomatoes with basil and garlic. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I changed it a bit though....I substituted kidney beans for the cannellini beans. I also used fresh garlic instead of minced, and spinach instead of cabbage. I also included green beans, and a couple dashes of tabasco for a little more flavor. I also included more chicken broth than called for and even with that it was still much closer to a stew than a soup. I like my minestrone to be a bit more soupy so next time I will increase the broth ( and seasonings accordingly ) even more. All in all a great soup!

Very good minestrone. I particularly liked it because it is simple and there is not an overload of seasoning. I did change some things 1. I added green beans and zucchini 2. I added to extra cups of water and bullion 3. I added dried basil

Next time I make this recipe, I will cut the macaroni in half and add more beans.

This was the best minestrone recipe I've come across. It was excellent. The only thing I changed was that I used extra virgin olive oil rather than the margarine.  I was truly amazed at the flavor of this soup.

This is a big hit with my family. I'm the oldest daughter so I'm always asked to cook something for my 4 other siblings and my parents when we all have chaotic days. I manage my time quite well so I always find a way to cook something up. One night I decided to make Minestrone, and I came across this recipe. I usually follow recipes verbatim, but with this one, I added extra vegetables and used more broth to add flavor. I used different kinds of beans instead of just one. In the end, it came out great, and I even made some garlic bread to put on the side. It makes for one great meal because the vegetables added fill you up -- a healthy and hearty soup, it's terrific.

This soup was great. I did prepareit a little differently than it originally called for. I added tons more carrots - I love carrots in soup - I also added fresh green beans and zucchini. In addition to the stewed tomatoes and chicken broth, I also added tomato sauce and a whole can of tomato paste. I also added a can of red kidney beans, fresh spinach, the potatoes and fresh parsley - along with salt, pepper, oregano, basil and a small amount of crushed red pepper just to give it a little kick. I cooked the elbow macaroni seperately and added them after cooking to the soup (so they would not absorb all the liquid) and it is still really thick and delicious. We grated fresh parmesan on top and ate it with a salad and bread - what a great fall dinner!!!!Thanks for the great recipe!

A very filling and delicious soup! I altered it a bit, adding shallots from the garden, 1/2 cup of barley, and a pound of the leanest ground beef, browned. I think meatballs would also be good. A great dinner on a cold winter evening.

This soup is so easy and so good!  I tossed the stewed tomatoes into my food processor because my family does not care for chunky tomatoes in soup and I used ditalini pasta instead of elbows.  I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used spinich instead of cabbage.  The broth is so flavorful and the soup is so hearty - it made a great meal with crusty french.  The leftovers were even better (if that's possible).

This was really good and simple. The only changes I made was using half homemade stock (it needed to be used up), no cabbage (picky eaters), and ditalini pasta per another users suggestions. This was really good. Even our picky eaters had a big bowl. It has a nice tomato flavor, but not enough to turn off anyone who doesn't like tomatoes. Good stuff. Added a bit of Italian seasoning while the pasta was cooking in the soup for a little added flavor, but that was purely personal preference.

This is a great soup and very easy to make. The only change I made was add some oregano and basil. Had a lot left over for another meal for me and my husband, so I froze the left overs.

Great recipe! Some changes for preference/items on hand:  I didn't have an onion so I added extra carrots/celery (ground up in food processor) and added some frozen cubes of bacon (lardon) while sauteeing. I doubled the tomatoes (used coarse ground instead of stewed) and didn't add cabbage b/c I didn't have any (boo!). Since I had doubled the tomatoes, I added about a cup of water w/ a bouillon cube and doubled the pasta too. In effect, this doubled the recipe. The bacon added a fabulous smokiness and the bits of potatoes, pasta and veggies were perfect- not too chunky. Can't wait to eat again tomorrow!

The only variations I made to this soup were: no cabbage used, 3 fresh tomatoes chopped, 1 large zuchini chopped, 1 cup macaroni, 3 1/2 cups potatoes, and fresh parsley.... YUM! My husband is a chef very well known for his soups and he said that this was fantastic. The parm really added a ton of flavor so I would definately recommend using it. So easy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I have never made soup in my life! This turned out really good. I did change it some though. I added extra celery and carrots. Used one tablespoon of Olive oil instead of butter. A whole small can of tomato paste (only because I read it wrong, lol). Added extra garlic and salt. Added pepper and dried basil. Used fat free broth and added a packet of dry boullion too (sodium free). I put the cheese in the pot with the soup instead of the bowls...(next time I will try it before adding the cheese). I also added a pound of cubed stew meat. Turned out awesome and my boyfriend loved it as well. I counted all the calories and it was approx 255 per cup of soup. Not putting cheese in the soup and useing whole wheat pasta would lighten the calorie load.

Very tasty soup.  I like the fact that it wasn't overpowered with Italian seasonings like some minestrone recipes are.  Just simple and delicious.  The only changes I made were that I used fresh parsley in place of the dried, and spiral pasta instead of the elbow.  Very healthy too!  Thanks.

I didn't have any cabbage, so I used green beans and a handful of frozen edamame. I also used a can of petite diced tomatoes. It's really good if you add dried basil. Cooked it in the slow cooker for about 4 hours and the vegetables got tender, but not mushy. If you plan on eating this soup over several days, it's good to cook the pasta separately, and just add it before warming the soup, so it doesn't soak up all the broth and get mushy. Great, veggie-loaded soup for the lunch box!

What a delicious soup! I only used about a tbsp of butter to saute the veggies. I added a red pepper, a medium sized zucchini and half a head of cabbage. I also used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and instead of parsley, I used 2 tsps of Italian seasoning. i added salt to taste, used kidney beans and added a small can of tomato paste. I didn't measure the veggies so this made A LOT of soup. I'm sure this will freeze well, too!

This was pure comfort food! I used 1 tbsp. olive oil instead of margarine. Used great northern beans. Skipped the cabbage, used one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, used zucchini instead of potatoes, and cooked the macaroni separately from the soup. Delicious with hot fresh Parmesan Knots from this site. Thank you!

This recipe is wonderful.  I cooked pasta before putting it in the soup, used Italian Stewed tomatoes 1 extra garlic clove and fresh parsley from my garden.  I deleted potatoes just because I am not a huge fan.  We will make this again and again!

Awesome recipe although I modified a few things.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  I added a diced zucchini, used a vegetable boullion cube boiled in water instead of chicken broth (to make it vegetarian for my boyfriend).  I also used orzo instead of elbows and added fresh chopped parsley and basil from my garden.  I also substituted fresh baby spinach instead of cabbage.  Absolutely fantastic!  Served with garlic bread.  Hearty and filling.  Way better than Minestrone I have eaten in a restaurant!

Holy cow!  This is the best minestrone I've ever tasted and I've tasted a lot!  My husband is Italian and his aunt is known throughout the county for her minestrone soup...among other dishes and this tastes so close to hers it's crazy!

I'd rate this a 3.5 I think.  It's a good, hearty, filling soup.  But I don't know why it says to cook everything so long.  I only simmered the beans, pots, etc, for about 30 minutes and the potatoes were getting mushy and once I put the pasta in I only cooked it for another 15 minutes until the pasta was done.  I used more of nearly all the ingredients (onion, celery, carrot, garlic, cabbage, tom paste, pots), and enjoyed the taste well enough.  Like some other reviewers I tossed a couple bay leaves in and I added more mixed italian seasoning.  I also used a whole wheat rotini instead of elbow mac and did not add any salt but I added a lil fresh ground pepper and used olive oil instead of butter.  If I make this again I will probably use the italian tomatoes.  Not sure yet if I will make this again.  If you make it, I would suggest not cooking it as long as the recipe indicates.

It is wonderful!  I made a double batch for a luncheon and only made a few changes; no cabbage, and I used Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  Delicious!  Gets better as it sits too, so the leftovers were yummy!  Thanks!

I used water instead of chicken broth to make a vegetarian version. I left out the macaroni until the next day, when I planned to serve the soup to guests after church. In the morning I added the macaroni, then placed in a 170-degree oven before leaving the house at 8:30 a.m.  When we returned in the early afternoon, the soup was the perfect temperature and the noodles were done perfectly, too. Don't forget the Parmesan--it really lends depth of flavor.  Serve with bruschetta and you've got a healthy, filling meal! Thank you A. Hatton!

My brother took over this recipe and perfected it. We left out the cabbage and potatoes and served it as a starter for 8 adults, and had just enough. He added some fresh thyme, a touch of sherry, and a shot of balsamic vinegar. He also recommends leaving out the salt because the broth has plenty. I will definitely make this again, it was excellent!

DELICIOUS !!!!!!! Just made this for the first time and we all are devouring it :) .I first changed the servings to 10 and updated the proportions on ingredients for I wanted a large pot of soup and some to freeze.Since we love veggies, I did add a few extra such as  fresh chopped parsnips for sweetness instead of potatoes,fresh spinach,sliced mushrooms,corn kernels & diced zuccini .I also used Ditalini pasta instead of elbows.It was one of the heartiest , most delicious soups I've ever made !!So many wonderful flavors, and my home smells great now!!!!A keeper for sure ;)
Served it with parmesan cheese on top and fresh crusty italian bread. YUMMMMMMO !!!!!!!!

I made this for a party and it was a big hit. I skipped the potatoes and upped the other veggies in its place. My only other change was making and serving the pasta on the side because some of my guests have wheat/gluten allergies.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for and it was a hit with my family!  I made only a couple of minor changes: used olive oil instead of butter to saute veggies, low-salt vegetable broth (to make it 100% vegetarian), added 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, used ditalini (small, tubular) pasta instead of elbows, used chopped tomatoes with Italian seasoning and 2 heaping tablespoons of tomato paste.  Served with a green salad and crusty bread - yum!

Yummy hearty soup on a cold winter night! Even my little kids enjoyed it! I added chopped green beans, much more salt garlic, black pepper basil and oregano....it was very tasty!

I've tried a number of minestrone recipes from Allrecipes and this one struck me as slightly odd.  I think the beans left a sweet after taste that was unexpected and not desired.  I can't quite figure it out, but if you like a slightly sweet after taste, go for it!

Perfect recipe 'as is.' You could substitute kidney or pinto beans for cannellini; you could sub other vegies for the ones listed. The two things I do differently are: a) use fresh tomatoes and b) boil the pasta separately, rinse and drain in the pot before starting the soup (why dirty an extra pot?), so it isn't cloudy and starchy. I also use the rinds of parmesan cheese blocks, chopping them up in small pieces and throwing them into the broth for added flavor. You could fish them out, but they're edible and add texture if they haven't dissolved. Why waste?

This soup was so delicious! I used olive oil instead of margarine and since I didn't have a can of stewed tomato, I used tomato sauce instead.

Made this for my family and it was a hit!!  I changed the quantity of vegestables a bit adding more onions, celery, and used red potatoes.  I also mixed the broth by using 1/2 chicken and 1/2 vegetable broth.  It was delicous!

The flavor of this soup was great, although it came out VERY thick when I made it. More like chili or stew than soup. Next time I make it I will try doubling the broth. Besides that, it was very good, and healthy!

This was delicious!!! I added half a cup of frozen green beans (at the same time as the potatoes) and sauteed the cabbage along with the onion and carrots to give it that sweet flavor. I also doubled the tomato paste. Incredible.  My sister's boyfriend didn't leave any leftovers, so we're making it again only two days later!

This soup was soooo good!  I love that this recipe uses humble winter veggies and canned goods...I almost always have these ingredients on hand.  I just made a few changes from the original recipe.  I used 1T olive oil in place of all of that butter.  I also used 1tsp basil and 1tsp oregano in place of the parsley.  Also, for the pasta I used 1/2C of alphabet pasta which was a real hit with my three kids.  Overall a great and versatile recipe!

Delish. Changes: added bell peppers, zucchini, and a tablespoon of dried basil; I also simmered about a pound of frozen chicken tenders, used that broth plus some water, and shredded the chicken for the soup; crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, red kidney beans, not cannelini, baby spinach instead of cabbage, and I skipped the potatoes.

The soup had a nice flavour. I used kidney beans and veggie broth. I didn't have any tomato paste, so I used a small can of tomato sauce. I also added peas and corn. Delicious!

I love soup.  I could eat it every day if my husband would let me.  Anyway, he's gone on a trip so I made this last night.  It was very very good!  I did add a can of dark red kidney beans (because I always think of minestrone having them).  I'll be taking my leftovers for lunch all week.  (I didn't measure anything, I usually just make my soups by sight-measuring).

This soup was very good.  I made a few substitutions -- added kidney beans, frozen spinach, beef bouillon, and a entire small can of tomato paste.  (I left out the cabbage and other beans.)  I also sauteed the carrots and onions in olive oil rather than butter for more flavor.

I have made this a few times and it always turns out thick and delicious.  Instead of the cannellini beans I use red kidney beans & instead of cabbage I add 2 zucchini squash.  This is great comfort food indeed!!

I made this today and was FLOORED! It was absolutely delicious!! I am no where near an expert cook, but I felt like one today. My husband just raved.  I followed the recipe - only used fresh spinach instead of cabbage. I also added light red kidney beans and some green beans.  It was FAR better than I expected and will definitely make this again!

I made a few adjustments based on what I had:  1 cup frozen chopped spinach, a few handfuls of frozen green beans, only one zucchini (it was huge), star-shaped pasta, only 1 onion, and dried spices instead of fresh.  I also added a pound of browned ground beef to satisfy my hubby. But basically, it was the same combination as this recipe, and it was really good.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a good, traditional minestrone.

A delicious, hearty soup- and rather simple to make! I added Northern beans instead of Cannellini(its all I had). I took the advice of the readers and added half a cup of both corn and chopped zucchini, and one extra can of Italian diced tomatoes as well. One reader was right though, the cabbage and parmessan cheese didn't complement very well, but it's still a keeper!

Great soup for a cold day.  Thickens nicely w/cooking. Added extra tomato paste & 1 zucchini chopped. I also like to add the pasta separately, keeps it from overcooking. Enjoy!

I rated this 3 stars because of mixed reviews.  I thought it was OK but husband said to throw out the recipe.  Seemed a little bland at first, second time around was better for me.  But probably won't make again.

Excellent! Very flavorful. I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used 2 tsp. ground garlic. I also used zucchini instead of celery because it's what I had. I loved it! And so did my husband!

This was an excellent recipe.  I ommited the cabbage (because I don't like it) and added, a sprig of thyme and two bay leaves while simmering.  I also added a dash of garlic powder and oregano and used Ditalini instead of elbow macaroni.  I did also add another half cup stock/half cup water at the end because it got so thick. My husband ate almost all of it before I could even get it to that table!

Great starter recipe to personalize a minestrone.  I like a more tomato base, so I added one 28oz can of tomato puree.  Also good if you can add some zucchini squash and red beans.

Nothing I cook ever tastes good, but this soup tasted AMAZING! Even my picky eater husband loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not add salt, because the broth was high in sodium. I also used olive oil instead of butter to sautee the vegetables. I served it with shredded mozzarella and some crutons. I'm hanging on to this recipe! Thank YOU!

This is a keeper! This family really likes soup and this is right up there with our favorites. I did have to make a few changes due to what I had available in the pantry. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken, kidney beans and green beans instead of cannellini and cabbage and a bit of basil for good measure. Try it today!

I chose to substitute escarole in place of the cabbage and added the beans later because I felt that they were a little overcooked.  I also added some fresh ground pepper.  I think that it would be delicious with zucchini.  I served it with homemade garlic bread. It was a delicious hearty winter meal.

This was a fun recipe to make and very tasty.  There's is a lot of cutting, chopping and mincing involved, so be prepared for that.  I used three, not four cloves of garlic and the soup was still plenty garlic flavored for my taste.  I also followed an earlier suggestion to add more tomato paste for a thicker consistency.  Since this is the first time I've made the recipe, I don't know how much of a difference it made, by I was starting to have the sense that the soup would be to watery, so I added another couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.  I doubled the recipe and had way more than enough for a small family.  I just had it for lunch again today.  I've got to learn more about mincing garlic efficiently.  It took me forever.  As other reviewers have suggested, the parmesan cheese is a must - it's truly a superb garnish.

It was original to use chicken broth in place of water.  It was pleasant and satisfying to my mother, boyfriend, and myself.

I make a pot of this soup every week, since it's become my favorite soup! I've made some changes since I first started making it, which I think has made a great recipe even better. I use olive oil instead of butter, and I add in zucchini, chopped spinach and extra celery. I also add some Italian seasoning, pepper, and a few tablespoons of bouillon, which gives the broth a richer flavor. I also add a couple of cups of water, or another small box of broth to make more soup. Delicious!!

Yummy, hearty and easy to make.  Just substituted "No Chicken Broth" by Imagine and followed the rest of the recipe.

I usually make Jamie's Minestrone from this site, but I had a handful of potatoes I needed to use, so I found this recipe. I made a few small changes...such as using diced tomatoes instead of stewed (I would actually use crushed next time), and only used 1.5 tsp of dried basil with 1/2 tsp of dried italian seasoning (2 TBS sounds like a LOT of dried herbs). I also cooked the noodles separately and added to the soup upon servings. It turned out quite good. More like a pasta e fagioli than a minestrone, but my 5 and almost-2-year-old ate it with no complaints.

Outstanding! Very flavorful. I made one small change and added a few extras. I didn't want the potatoes so I removed them and replaced them with a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano and then I added some zucchini, summer squash and green beans. With my additions, next time I will also add a bit extra broth.

This was so easy & so very yummy!  The only changes I made were the type of beans.  I used red kidney, northern & black beans because I didn't have any cannelini beans.  I also used whole wheat shell macaroni.  Again, because I had it on hand...

ONe of the best soups I have made, and I have made a lot of soups. I also added some zuccini and doubled the recipe and added some water. The key is to start with good chicken broth!
This is a keeper for sure.

This is such a great recipe!!  Like others have said, I added more tomato paste & garlic, carrots & celery.  I added in frozen green beans, fresh zucchini & green peppers.  amazing without the noodles, but I would cook them separately so that if you double the recipe (which I always do)they don't get overly soggy, and decrease the liquid content of the soup.   like more liquid, so adding in more chicken broth, or just water is a good idea!  Parmesan cheese is delicious on top!  ENJOY!!!

Everyone agrees this is the best minestrone ever, but with these minor modifications: Added a small zucchini, doubled the pasta, quadrupled the tomato paste, and added a little dried oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. I'm not a huge soup person, but I could eat this every day.

Incredible! I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out GREAT. (i did use butter rather than margarine though)  I have tried many different minestrone recipes trying to find one that tasted half this good- this one tastes like a good minestrone you would get t a itailan restaurant, and it is so healthy!

This soup was delicious!!! I made just a few slight adjustments. I didn't use cabbage, used only 1 tbsp of parsley, and only cooked the macaroni for 8 minutes but other than that it was a winner: )

I used water instead of oil, no butter, more salt (3 tsp), 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, 1 tsp creole seasoning. A can of green beans, cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, basically anything that was in the kitchen that needed to be used up. Always turns out great.

Good, tasty soup.  We used red potatoes since they are SO GOOD.  We'll make it again for sure.  I don't know if margarine is somehow better than butter or olive oil for this one... but as a rule i don't allow the stuff in my kitchen.  I mean it's vegetable oil that has been chemically altered to stay solid... no thanks.  Anyhow, if you care about trans fats I used butter and it was delicious.

YUMMY!!
I've made this for my parents twice. It gets better each time I've made it. When I added the pasta (which ever kind I had on-hand) I ended up having to add roughly one to two cups of broth. I skipped the cabbage just because I don't care for it. 
After it had been simmering about 30 minutes I added: 
1 tbs chopped oregano
1 tsp garlic salt
1 tsp chopped thyme
2 tsp chopped basil
It was absolutely delicious, and SO easy!!

This is good soup.  I omitted the margarine and added crumbled bacon and italian sausage, cooking the onion, celery and carrots in the bacon drippings. Then, when I added the other veggies, I also added a small chopped zucchini. This will make it more of a main dish and not just a light starter. MMM, good;-)

This was wonderful. I did change the recipe just based on what I needed to use up & to fit our family. I added fresh, chopped green beans, more cabbage, a whole med onion, 3/4 cup of whole wheat macaroni and omitted the cheese. I ended up using more garlic, doubled the tomatoes, and used water and bouillon (2 ckn bouillon and 1 beef) instead of stock.  It came out great and the recipe is a wonderful base.

So easy and delicious!  My first time making minestrone and I loved this recipe.  I omitted the cheese and had it with a teaspoon of sour cream instead.  It was perfect.  I also added one teaspoon each of oregano and basil and a pinch of red pepper flakes and ancho chilli pepper.

THIS IS A GREAT BASIC FOR MINESTRONE SOUP, BUT WE LIKE LOTS MORE CABBAGE, ONION, MACARONI, AND I USE LEFT OVER PINTO BEANS INSTEAD OF CANNED BEANS.  I ALWAYS KEEP A FREEZER CONTAINER IN THE FREEZER SO THAT WHEN WE HAVE DABS OF CORN, SQUASH, GREEN BEANS, OR OTHER VEGGIES LEFT OVER I JUST KEEP ADDING TO THE CONTAINER AND THEN THAW THIS AND ADD TO MY MINESTRONE SOUP AND IT COMES OUT GREAT.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE

Excellent soup as written! I used olive oil in place of butter, increased veggies about 50% (carrots, celery, cabbage/coleslaw, garlic), added 1 can kidney beans instead of potato, and used 1/3 cup tomato sauce instead of paste for lighter tomato flavor. Added crushed red pepper and 2 cooked chicken/turkey sausages to liven it up.  Also held off on cheese and added at the table to taste. Used 1 cup medium paste shells.

This was excellent!  The only change I made was using 2T olive oil instead of the margarine.  I loved the broth, next time I will only add half the macaroni noodles so it is a little more brothy (is that even a word ?!?)  Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING! I swapped the cabbage out for some corn, and put half as much parsley, it was delicious!

Great flavor!  I substituted ketchup for tomatoe paste, used lt red kidney instead of cannellini, added zucchini and spinach, left out the celery (only cause husband doesn't like it), used fresh parsley, a bay leaf, and Italian Seasoning. I like lemon pepper so I used plenty, and the short macaroni instead of elbow.  My 10 yr old son whose usually pretty picky, loved it.  His only request was more potatoes and beans next time.  I was just happy he ate healthy!

Very good recipe and super flexible. I used 1 can red kidney beans and 1/2 can of white beans instead of potatoes. I also used shredded spinach instead of cabbage. Fantastic! Healthy, hearty and delicious! Definitely a keeper.

This is a great minestrone. The only reason I knocked off a star is because I needed more liquid to the soup than it asked for. I added about a cup or two of water to the soup and used several different beans which were garbanzo and kidney.

I swapped cabbage for spinach.  Didn't have celery so I used broccoli and some cauliflower.  I also included some vegetable broth, and used whole wheat rotini pasta.  Delicious!  Next time I'll add shredded chicken.

Will make again.  Very good flavor.  I didn't find it bland at all - just adjust the seasoning to your taste.  I used kidney beans because that is what I had on hand.  Nice, warm your tummy, soup!

Enjoyed this soup this evening.   I used kidney beans instead of cannellini.  Also used a box of chopped tomatoes instead of stewed ones.  Added the pasta to the bowl instead of the pot so that it wouldn't get soggy later on for leftovers.  I'll just add a fresh batch when I serve it up again.    To beef things up a bit I cut some sirlion steak in to small thin pieces then sauted them in a little olive oil and salt.  Added the meat to the bowl.  I'm think of adding some shrimp next time.  Last but not least I left out the cabbage and threw some fresh baby spinach into the bowl and let the hot soup wilt it.    I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  May make some cornbread to serve on the side.

I got rave reviews for this soup and was asked by many for the recipe.  The changes I made were: I used chicken broth vice beef broth.  I used tomato sauce instead of ketsup.  and I used fresh tortellini instead of frozen.  I used chicken jalapeno sausage links, sliced without the casing.  It give the soup just a little kick to warm the tummy on a cold winter day.  Will definitely make again.

This soup was great. I didn't have shell pasta so I used macaroni. I added about a cup of water and some kale. I toasted some sourdough bread and put garlic salt and butter on it. I will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  When I checked it after an hour of simmering, I decided to add 2 c. water and 1 more cup of chicken broth.  I then added the noodles and cooked for 20 minutes.

It was good, but with my additions of 1/2 ts of oregano and 1/2 ts of basil. And you don't need to simmer it for 1.5 hour. Just 30 min and 15 min(after pasta), if you cook veggies to long they loose the vitamins...

Great as is but prefer it made with kale and kidney beans instead of cabbage and cannellini beans. I look forward to making this soup in the fall every year.

LOVE this recipe. I'm just a simple college kid but when I'm home I like to cook once in a while for my family. The soup came out AMAZING but of course I made some changes like everyone else. I used fresh parsley (and very little), chopped baby spinach instead of cabbage, I added chick peas and red kidney beans, and used probably triple the tomato paste. Even when I doubled the recipe, I added more chicken stock to have enough broth to go with all the beans, veggies, and pasta! The stewed tomatoes I had to chop up a little bit and I bought them with oregano and garlic flavor so that helped the soup. Everything came out great! Everyone raved and I will be making it again soon! Give it a try!

This is a great recipe for a nice thick minestrone!  I think the recipe would be good as-is, but I did make a few changes that I will keep the next time I make this.  I doubled the celery and tomato paste because the amounts seemed small, and I was happy with the results.  I also used ditalini pasta instead of elbow macaroni because I had some in the cupboard, and it was perfect with this soup.  I did find that the cooking times were a little off, although that could have something to do with how small you slice and dice the veggies.  I found they were tender in about 40 minutes, and the pasta only took another 10 minutes to cook.  So just be aware it may not take the full hour and a half of simmering the recipe calls for.

I dumped all the cheese in at the end and wished that I'd just served it on the side.  The soup was quite tasty before adding the cheese, but after adding it, I could only taste the cheese.

This was sooo flavorful!  I cooked 1 lb ground beef seasoned with worcestershire, garlic salt & pepper.  I removed the beef and sauteed the veggies in the drippings and added the butter a few min. later.  Add the beef back in when you add the pasta.  I added a can of corn, undrained, and used Knorr chicken bullion powder for stock.  When the broth soaked away, I just added 2 or more cups of water mixed with the bullion and didn't lose any flavor.  I will make this many more times!  Thanks!

This is really good, and doesn't use meat, have extra fat, or call for prepared ingredients.  Ingenious!  I used the whole can of tomato paste (I never get around to using the rest before it gets moldy, so in it goes), extra water, and left it in the oven at 250 for 5 hours while we were out skating.  what a heavenly aroma to come back to!  I also substituted celery root for the cabbage.  Thanks!!

This was OK, but not thrilling to us.  It is probably very healthy, however.  I have a lot of ideas of things I'd add next time, like turkey sausage, more garlic and cayenne.  Good start though.

Very good recipe overall.  I agree with another review that said this is the answer to using the old, sad veggies dying in your crisper, the random cans of beans, and leftover pasta in your pantry.  I used what I had, no celery, white beets instead of potatoes, added a link of veggie italian sausage, black and garbanzo beans instead of white, and it turned out very good indeed.  The parmesan was a really yummy addition. I would recommend using a little tomato paste or sauce to make the broth a little richer.  Will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this!  I doubled the recipe and pureed a couple of cups of it for baby food for my 9 month old twins.  They loved it as much as I did!  I sauted the veggies in olive oil and I used 1 can of cannelini beans and one can of kidney beans.  I omitted the cabbage.  The flavors were wonderful!  Didn't even need to add salt to it.  Very delish!

I modified this recipe a little...left out the potatoes, cabbage, and cooked the veggies in a little broth instead of margarine. Also used fresh tomatoes (seeded & peeled) along with the tomato paste & added 1/4 tsp celery seed & 1/4 tsp tumeric. Precooked (to cut down on fat) one large spicy Italian sausage. Chopped it up and added to soup. Yum!

YUM!!!  This is sooo good.  Due to some of the previous reviews, I used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes (oregano and basil).  I didn't have to tweak anything.  I made a double recipe and I have no doubt that by tomorrow night it'll all be gone.  I LOVE all the veggies in it... it feels healthy making it.  Thank you for the great minestrone recipe!

This was quite bland so added some oregano and basil which greatly helped the flavor.

A great base for any vegetable soup, though you need to be careful about absorbing your broth with starchy ingredients.

Absolutely delicious.  I added a half cup of a rich red wine and let it simmer for a long time - just perfect.  The flavors blend beautifully.  I can't wait to make it again - I'll add zucchini next time, as well.

A new family favorite! I made this especially for my toddler so made a few minor changes:  olive oil instead of margarine, 1 cup carrots, 1 15oz can cannelini beans and 1 15oz can kidney beans (thoroughly washed and drained), 1 can chopped tomatoes in garlic (all my store had), no cabbage, an extra 4 cups chicken stock, and small seashells instead of macaroni.  Since it was already so thick, I cooked the noodles separately and added at the end of the hour, did not simmer for the extra 30 mins. We were unexpectedly out of parmesan so I used cheddar on mine and it was great.  Inexpensive, healthy, lowfat and the 2 year old will eat it!! He excitedly ate all the vegetables and left the noodles.  This will become a new regular rotation, even something I will serve to company.

Had to add water and olive oil because it was too thick and burning the bottom of my pot. Otherwise it turned out pretty well. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful basic recipe.  I did all sorts of other crazy things with it.  I added tukey bones, a can of corn, two fresh tomatoes and one small can of tomato sauce instead of the tomato ingredients called for in the recipe.  I omitted the cheese (to make it parve).  I used pinto beans instead of cannelini beans.  I had no celery so I omitted that.  I added much more water and a sprinkle of freshly ground pepper. I didn't have cabbage so I omitted that.  

Come to think of it, I guess I didn't make this recipe at all but created my own instead!  :-)

This recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC!!  I did make a few of my own changes by eliminating the potatoes and adding fresh zucchini and green beans.  I also seasoned the soup with lots of oregano and basil in addition to the seasonings called for in the recipe.  I also doubled the recipe so we have plenty of leftovers to freeze.  Thanks so much for what has already become a family favorite.

I substituted olive oil for the margarine & crushed tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes, as I prefer a smoother base.  I also substituted small white beans for the potatoes as white potatoes are a "bad" carb on my current eating plan.  Using 2 different types of beans was fine.  Finally I added whole wheat pasta to the soup separately at the table so it wouldn't get too mushy.

This was a great soup! I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning (basil and oregano for the most part) and it added a nice Italian flavor to it. I also substituted garbanzo beans and used olive oil instead of butter and it was great. I did find it quite salty when finished; maybe my chicken broth is just saltier than usual since some other reviewers thought it wasn't salty enough but I think next time I will only add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and let the family add salt as they wish.

I thought this was great.  I didn't have the right kind of beans so I used Romano beans and it turned out just as well.  I also didn't use the parmesan cheese and I don't think we missed out on anything, the only thing we added was pepper but that is up to each person, i think.

mmm mmm good!  this is a delicious soup recipe!! this is the first soup that ive ever made and i found it very easy.  I also added kidney beans, finely crushed ginger (which i add to practically everything), mushrooms, basil and oregano.  I didnt have celery, but it turned out just fine!  i should have added more broth bc it was a bit chunky with the added mushrooms, but still a hit!  im definetly going to make this again, and am going to share the recipe with my favorite cook, my mom!

Wow. This recipe I loosely followed to use up all my veggies in the fridge and some frozen (thawed). Then used leftover chicken that was grilled, a quart of canned tomatoes, leftover homemade spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato paste, but left the noodles out. May add some tomorrow to leftovers to make it stretch but I’m undecided. With how I made it it relied heavily on the veggies seasoning it. It was made into a clean eating very healthy meal. Even my diabetic boyfriend can eat what he wants with no worries (hence me not wanting to add noodles tonight). I will use this recipe over and over. Thank you so much. Full happy bellies all around.

This is a keeper. The whole family put dibs on leftovers! I added a few ingredients; Shredded Fresh Baby Spinach, Garbanzo Beans, Red Kidney Beans, and Red Pepper Flakes.

When you want to clean out your fridge  this is the soup to make, it’s hearty and tasty and makes a lot.  I stuck to the instructions and added four carrots, four celery stalks, one large onion  sautéed in olive oil. Made a hot spot and threw down the tomato paste to enhance the flavor and let it cook a minute before adding the rest of the veggies - in my fridge I had a piece of yellow squash, a quarter of a small cabbage and three small russet potatoes and a red bell pepper  so they got cubed up and thrown in.  I added a big can of plum tomatoes in purée (chopped up) and two boxes of chicken broth.  For the beans I added a can of Goya Red Kidney beans in sauce which adds a lot of flavor base to the soup.  Seasoning-wise I used fresh parsley, red pepper flakes, dried basil, oregano , a little garlic powder even tho I had already added minced garlic earlier, and two spoonfuls of beef bouillon in place of the salt.  Cooked small soup shells separately since the last time I made this soup the shells really absorbed the broth and made it more stew like.
Made Melissa d’Arabian’s foolproof popovers with some sweet butter to go with the soup.  Perfect meal for a dreary day in the Northeast and it made the house smell wonderfully  of comfort food.  Tomorrow it will be even better.

I thought this was a great recipe. I made this minus the pasta and put it in the crock pot on low for 7 hours instead of cooking it on the stove.  Then I just cooked the pasta separately and mixed it in before serving. I'm sure cooking the noodles in the broth itself would have been better, but I work 10 hour days, so I live by my crockpot. I will be making this again

Delicious! I made substitutions but kept proportions. Used garden fresh green beans 3/4 cups,  1 heaping cup of Zucchini, Used fresh parley and oregano.  No beans Used two large seeded peeled heirloom tomatoes instead of canned and 2 tablespoons of paste. Kale instead of cabbage. Added chicken broth since liquid was absorbed after refrigerated.

This is delicious but does need more flavor.  As others did-  I added a jar of tomato sauce and added more broth when adding pasta.  Endless possibilities and veggies!

Excellent soup which will surely be better in a day or two. I used half olive oil and half butter to saute the veggies. I skipped the potato but did add a small chopped zucchini and half a can of green beans, drained and chopped smaller. I also added about a tblsp of brown sugar to cut the tomatoes' acidity, extra tomato paste and a little Italian seasoning. I cooked the macaroni (small shells) separately and will add to bowl of soup. I did let it simmer about 45 min because I didn't want too mushy. Topped bowl of soup with a drizzle of olive oil and romano cheese that I already had opened. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

I'm sure my husband would rate it 2 stars but I'll give it 3 because it wasn't "too" bad. I liked all the vegetables but it was bland. Also, I put in the beans when the soup was almost done and after I turned off the stove burner I then put in the macaroni (small shells). I had to add more seasoning to it, I think I'll look around on here for another recipe.

Best Minestrone soup we have ever eaten!  I accidentally used half a box of old sprial pasta I had around instead of reading the directions that said only 1/2 cup (lol) made it the consistency of a stew but man...but was it good and much welcomed with toasted bagels on a day that was -40 outside!  We loved it, in my favorites!

Easy and delicious! I used kidney beans instead and substituted the cabbage for spinach. I added 2tbsp of paste, which others recommended. I also added zucchini to the recipe and used more of the other veggies than the recipe called for. In order to balance it out I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and 1.5c water. Will definitely make again!

This was delicious.  I didn't have any cabbage but that was okay.  I put in a parmesan rind and served it with cheddar and bacon scones. os
Why does the picture have a rosemary sprig in it?  There is no rosemary in the recipe lol!

This is my go to minestrone soup. Tried others and this has been a real hit. If my wife likes something she raves to other coworkers and may even share. They also loved it and I printed out the recipe for them. So let’s recap a simple to follow ingredients, cost is minimal ( big on saving money) most people have these items as staples to there pantry. I added to my soup was a can of red kidney beans. Also added my own dried herbs. As for adding noodles ,I cooked them separate to allow people to add as much or as little to their bowl.    Add to taste oregano a pinch to start. Dried basil ( red ) or (green) I grow both. There is a difference in taste use what you like. Dried thyme a pinch. As this soup cooks down flavor is intensified so add to your personal likes. From Mr Finger Bakes

I love this soup.  It is such a yummy way to eat extra vegetables!
I followed the recipe.  Added a little extra seasoning to taste.  I also added chopped zucchini which was really good.  I followed the suggestion of another rater and added extra tomato paste to perk up the flavor.  This is a keeper recipe - thank you!  I make it for dinner on Sunday and pack the left overs for work week lunches.  This freezes well to save for a quick meal later.

This is a great basic recipe. I did make a lot of changes, as I always do with soup. I eliminated the potatoes, added zucchini and Italian seasoning. I also adjusted the quantities of the other vegetables to taste.

Wow. This is a really amazing soup. I didn’t measure anything but pretty much followed the recipe to a T. I used chickpeas instead of white beans and bag leaves during the simmering. This is a very good and simple recipe. Will make again!

All around great recipe, did a few teaks added chicken stock and extra tomato paste to make it thicker. Also next time I think I'll cook the pasta separately just because it soaks up the liquid.

My family went CRAZY over this soup.  The only changes I made were to eliminate the potato and add fresh spinach leaves, zucchini and green beans.  DELICOUS!  Yes, I would definitely make this soup again.  I was lucky enough to bring some for lunch today.

This recipe was okay as a reference point for making minestrone, but really it was lacking in a few ingredients. I added zuchinni and green beans, and left out the potatoes, and found I needed more broth than one quart of chicken broth (I think I used larger portions of veggies than called for.) I also added some Italian seasoning because I thought it needed more flavor.

Very good! Didn't make much changes and it turned out well :)

Needs more soup for it though, we ran out towards the end as there were too many items in the soup and the proportions were off. All in all, good!

This soup is delicious however, if you like to have a soup with some broth do not add the pasta!  If you add the pasta it will soak up all the broth and you will end up with something more like a stew.  Still very tasty but just a very thick consistency.

It was okay, but I thought the potato, along with the macaroni, was a little odd.  The soup seemed a little bland, too.  Nothing special here; I won't be making it again.

Easily one of the best soups I've made. So flavorful and packed with veggies. I doubled the recipe and added a chopped zucchini. Plus I used one can of white beans and one can of red kidney beans. Perfection.

was quite good, but should have zucchini.  i recommend making the pasta seperate and puting it in the bottom of the bowl so that it doesn't get mushy.

Simmering the soup for an hour made the cannelini beans mushy. I would add the beans later.  Cooking the pasta by simmering for 30 mins made it gummy. After the veggies are cooked, bring everything to a boil, add pasta, and cook for 8 mins instead.

Although there are Minestrone Soup recipes that have been here longer, and therefore, acquired more stars, THIS is the recipe I use....I love it. I pretty much follow it to the "T", but I add corn to it and that makes it PERFECT for my taste. Minestrone has so many variations, particular to everyone's taste, but this is a very good base for whatever you want to add.

Great soup for a cold evening.  I made as written, adding more garlic, omitting the potato and using black beans as I realized too late that was all I had.  Husband thought it was great.  Would definitely make again.

4 stars only because I made a few changes. I added a few other vegetables but I think that's what is great about this recipe. You can really do anything with it.  

I put green beans, arugala, and potatoes. 

I think it's all about the touch you put on it! I posted a photo of it as well :)

I love to cook and wanted to try soups this fall.  This soup is hearty and delicious just like it is.  But as in all recipies I will experiment next time.

What do I love about this soup? 1. Ingredients are all on-hand. 2. It's very forgiving - add more veggies if you like, or more broth if you like a thinner soup. I added kidney beans and a small zucchini. 3. YUMMO!

I thought this was okay. I followed the recipe exactly, except for not having the small amount of cabbage. I ended up having to add a cup of water. It was still rather thick for this type of soup as it cooled down. Some people may like that though. I had recently made this type of soup from another Italian recipe, and think I may have been spoiled. This didn't have quite that same fresh taste. I am sure it will be eaten, but it is just a little salty and slightly canned soup tasting, to me, for some reason.

I actually forgot to add Parmesan as garnish but will do so tomorrow! I doubled the recipe, added extra tomato paste to thicken, some black pepper and italian seasoning and boiled pasta separately, adding afterwards. It tasted great and I've got plenty left. Will definitely be holding onto this recipe!

Looooove minestrone all year round. Great recipe. I add chick peas and replace macaroni with gluten free fusilli, adds thickness to broth and already hearty soup. Yummmm.

Good recipe. Almost exactly how my Italian family makes it. Like some reviews recommended, I also added zucchini to it and used kidney beans. Also, I wanted some meat in it so I separately cooked 2 chicken breasts, shredded them, and thew them in the soup along with the noodles. It turned out great.

Very nice soup. I'm not sure I added enough chicken broth because my soup came out pretty thick. Make sure you put enough broth in so it will cook the vegetables and still leave you with a soup instead of a stew.

Mmm. I added some fresh rosemary and thyme. The beans come in 15 oz size but I added 2 cans.  I like beans. I like the taste of tomatoes but not whole mouth full so I used the hand blender to purée them, flavor but not chunky. My father is not fond of carrots so I used less of them and more cabbage and celery.  Over all a very good recipe.

This was a very good soup! I only made a few changes: I doubled the cabbage, double the garlic, and doubled the tomato paste (used 2 tbsp). I also only used 1 1/2 tsp parsley, but added 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano, along with 1/4 cup of red wine. I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of stewed. Finally, I added 1 1/2 tsp black pepper and a few dashes of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit more. I also only simmered for an extra 15 minutes after adding the pasta.

Truly easy to fix.  We like the recipe as is,  but the other suggestions and variations look equally wonderful to try.  Easy and quick preparation.  I'll report back later as to taste.  Oh,  we used orzo instead of macaroni. Also, broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. Doubled the recipe and it worked just fine. Also substituted condensed chicken base instead of prepared stock. Really delicious!

Really great. First time, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out good but missing something. I've experimented a few times and found a good couple of changes. First, I don't add salt (we need a reduced sodium diet in our home). I also add about a tablespoon of black pepper and garlic powder. Finally, while melting the butter at the start I add the first clove of minced garlic and saute it with the carrots, celery and onion so that its flavor can be added as a base. This has become a treat for everyone when I make it. Great dish!

This was the best minestrone I've ever had anywhere. I did use spinach instead of cabbage and threw in a parmesan cheese rind while cooking for extra flavor. Thank you for the great recipe.

One of the few recipes I've ever tried on here which is great as written. I did use a can of red kidney beans but only because I like them, not because this recipe needed it. This is one of the best soup recipes I've ever tried.

I also tweaked this recipe, I add the rind of really good parm cheese and it makes all the difference in the world!! The soup becomes almost creamy... I also add a little home made beef stock which I keep in the freezer.

Very good soup chock full of veggies.  I used tiny meatballs (1 inch or smaller) in my soup and it made it awesome.  I also chose to throw in fresh spinach at the end, which wilts in very easily.  I used gluten free orzo for the pasta (all my ingredients were GF)

Delicious, but I made some changes. I left out the cabbage and potato and used yellow and green zucchini squash, diced canned tomatoes, spinach and  organic vegetable broth. I also used red kidney beans and Garbanzo beans instead of the Cannellini beans. I used one tablespoon of Olive oil instead of margarine to make the veggies and added some basil. This was the best Minestrone soup!

Excellent but my husband said it was too salty. Will not add salt next time- there's plenty in the other ingredients.  Will add green beans too, as suggested above. Also, I substituted olive oil for 3 Tbsp of butter for health reasons.

Delicious!  I didn't have cabbage and used more tomato paste and broth than called for since mine turned out a little less soupy than I'd like.  I also added in lots more garlic and tossed in rosemary, thyme, basil, and oregano since it wasn't quite as seasoned as I'd like when I tried it.  I also used penne instead of elbow macaroni since I don't have macaroni.  All that aside, though, this soup completely rocks and takes well to changes.  I totally had been craving soup for a week or two but just didn't have time to make it until now.  This was a wonderful cold fall evening meal with soup and some crackers.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup turned out really nice.  I doubled everything but added kidney beans, squash, zucchini and string beans.  I also used a whole small can of tomato paste.  I omitted cabbage and Parmesan cheese.  I have so much of it I do plan on freezing a large quantity of it.  This Minestrone will be great once it really does get cold.

I have been making this recipe for years and years - and years. I use green beans or zucchini instead of the cabbage and swap out veggie broth for the chicken broth to keep it vegetarian. It is our GO TO meal when we need something homey and comfy. Today is my son's first day home from camp and this is the meal he asked for. Served w/ parm on top and crusty bread and ... YUM. This thank you is years in coming!

This is my all-time favorite minestrone soup. I substitute the same amount of chopped fresh spinach for the cabbage to add some dark green vegetables and it is delicious. My son loves the taste of the broth. I make this at least once a month and feel righteous about serving such a healthy meal.

Amazing! and so easy to assemble!!  It tasted like a soup you would have in Italy.......I omitted the potatoes and used ditalini macaroni instead of elbows.  I also threw in a bunch of Swiss Chard, to give it a little sweetness..... YUMMMMMMMMMMM    :)

We all love this (not an easy task with four young children!) I make a couple changes, using spinach instead of cabbage most of the time (though the cabbage is also wonderful), vegetable broth instead of chicken and using gluten-free noodles. If you get the timing right you can't even tell they're GF!

So flavorful!  So glad I added 3 TBS of tomato paste, it created the PERFECT consistency.  I only used 2TBS of margarine.  Great Northern White Beans.  3-4TBS of fresh parsley.  Made my own stewed tomatoes.  Added 1 chicken breast seasoned with Italian seasoning.

No need to look any further for a yummy minestrone soup recipe. I made as directed except for cooking time when adding elbow noodles. They were done after 15 minutes of simmering. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was an extremely easy to make soup!  I used low sodium chicken broth(70mg per serving), and it turned out great.  The sodium content in most soups is outrageously high, but this one came to about 200 mg. sodium per serving after using low-sodium broth and no salt added tomatoes and paste. I cannot find cannellini beans in Central Texas so the next best thing were navy beans and northern beans, they were terrific! I highly recommend this recipe if you are looking for a quick, but pleasing meal for lunch or dinner paired with a salad. Thanks for the recipe, great job!

Nice soup. I used leftover sausage skillet ~ smoked sausage, potatoes, carrots, onion and cabbage ~ I used a can of diced tomatoes with the juices no tomato paste and no chicken broth, just used the water the pasta was boiled in and as always left out the celery. Would make again!!

This recipe was great!  Definitely the best minestrone recipe I have tried.  I omitted the potatoes, but the soup was still very thick and full of veggies without them.  I also added a little bit of Emeril's Essence seasoning (which I put in just about everything!) and it really enhanced the flavor.  Would definitely make again.

very yummy! i did make a few modifications in order to healthy it up and adapt for vegetarians. used maybe a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead of all that margarine and it worked great. omitted the potatoes and instead threw in about the same amount of mixed frozen veg. used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and whole wheat shell pasta instead of macaroni. turned out awesome!

Absolutely amazing.  I never thought I could make a soup this good.  No need to change anything.  It's perfect as is.  I only left out the Parmesan cheese because I don't like it.

love it. First time made it according to directions, and it was amazing, but next time I think I'll leave out the cabbage since it is kind of rough on my children's digestion. Still, great version of minestrone!

This was ok.  My sister made it and loved it just like all the other reviews. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or it just wasn't my thing.  I did add some extra broth like others suggested.  I don't know that I would make this again.  Sorry

This is really 4 1/2 stars but you get the basic idea; this is one easy and tasty soup! At first I thought that it was going to be a bit boring or bland but I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor is smooth and creamy - who knew?! Now I'm not one to change and/or adapt recipes however I did for this soup and it still came out great! Switched spinach for cabbage and chunks of squash for the potatoe. It worked! Will definitely have this again!

I absolutely loved this soup. The only thing I did differently is I added some fresh green beans towards the end of the simmering. I will use this one a lot!

I have to admit the reason I gave this recipe 4 stars rather than 5 is because I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I am the sort of cook that my great-great-grandmother was... a handful of this, a bunch of that, substitute cannellini for kidney beans, etc.  My measurements were far from exact, and I made a few substitutions where I had different (but similar) ingredients on hand, but the results were phenomenal. It reminded me of a minestrone I remember having once when I was a little girl, so rich and such a velvety smooth textured broth. Nostalgic and a wonderful crowd pleaser!

Delicious! I've made this soup twice now and have yet to be disappointed. I haven't used cabbage either time (partially because we didn't have any and partially because our family isn't too crazy about it). We added zucchini the first time and green beans from the garden the second time and both were fabulous additions! A great, filling soup that is great for a cool day :)

I added one lb. of browned ground beef and a little more of the veggies called for except the potatoes and about 2 cups more broth because of all the extras. It was sooo good! Thank you for the only minestrone recipe I will ever use!

I used kidney beans instead of the other beans, added a little red pepper flakes, and instead of parsley I used a tiny bit of basil, and added one zucchini. The soup turned out so amazing. the only thing is mine turned out a little on the salty side. so i would use a teaspoon of salt first, then add a little more at the end.

This is great!  I added some basil and oregano.  I also used red kidney beans.  Must serve with the parm cheese - it makes the soup!  Double for a big family.

I usually skip the cabbage and just add extra celery and carrots.  I also add in chick peas and use farfalle (bow-tie) pasta.  I make a huge pot of this and separate it into 2-serving sized tupperware containers and store in the freezer for nights and afternoons when I don't feel like cooking.  A little tabasco sauce and buttered toast and it fills me up!

This is a great soup. A few changes I made were; I added 2 cans of beans and used 1/2 and 1/2 chicken and beef broth. I also had coleslaw mix on hand so I used a handful of that instead of buying a head of cabbage. I will definately make it again!

This was my first time making minestrone soup. It was delicious!!With other soups, I usually have to add salt or other spices right before serving. I didn't have to with this one! The only thing I did was boil the pasta separately and added it right before serving. I'm rating this 5 stars because my children ate this and gave it a thumbs up! In this house, it's difficult to get everyone to agree on a recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Outstanding! As recommended by others, I doubled the tomato paste and used spinach rather than cabbage. I also threw in some green beans and extra pasta, and used Better than Bouillion rather than veggie stock. A keeper for sure!

Yummy! I used kidney beans instead of cannelli, and added a can of garbanzo beans. I also must've chopped the vegetables finer than the author, because my cooking time was only 30minutes simmer/ plus 20minutes after adding the macaroni. I also added more chicken stock, tomatoe paste, carrots and celery than the recipe called for, because I like it thick and chunky! It turned out delicious! The possibilities are endless...

10/02/08  I made this soup today just as directed.  Not only was it super easy---it was absolutely delicious.  My husband and I were so happily surprised at how good it was.  I am already planning of another batch---but doubled.  Thanks A Hatton for a great recipe.

This recipe has so much flavor.  I had a red and green pepper that i diced up.  Anytime I make a soup I slice the veggies and meats bite size.  Makes it easy to get   a taste of all the ingredients.

Husband can't have beans or veggies (has crohns) but he loved this soupy concoction as well as my 5 yr old! Maybe I should just write my own recipe since I pretty much didn't follow this one posted. :D

This was great--even my 2 year old daughter loves it and has eaten the leftovers for several lunches.  I left out the cabbage and potatoes and added zucchini.

I made this soup last week and it was very good. I did change a few things to "veganize" it as I am a vegan (no meat, dairy or eggs). I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and vegan Parmesan cheese. I also sauted the veggies in olive oil instead of butter.  Since I was out of potatoes and cabbage I omitted them and added extra pasta, 14 oz. crushed tomatoes and a can of kidney beans.

I gave it 4 stars because I felt it needed a little more flavor. I added seasoning salt, 2 fresh bay leaves and some more garlic which really enhanced the flavor.

This is a delicious, hearty soup. I used olive oil instead of butter, fresh basil, and added some extra pasta to it to make it really thick. Great for a cold night, I'll definitely be making this one again.

This is a delicious and easy soup! I doubled the recipe and used vegetable stock instead of chicken to make a vegan version.  I also omitted the cabbage, used dried minced garlic, some oregano, whole wheat penne pasta, and a whole can of tomato paste for a double recipe.  I would use less salt next time--maybe half.

The broth thickened up really nicely after the soup cooled a little.  I will make this again and again!  I think I'll try adding some greens next time like spinach or chard, mostly for some color variety.  Good stuff!

Thank you for the recipe!  I really liked this soup.  I think the only change I might make, just for my own personal taste, is a different type of bean in it.  I didn't realize this kind was a bit on the hard side.  But that's just personal preference.  A wonderful flavor to this soup, especially with the parmesan cheese on it!   Yum!!!

This got raves.  I had a lot of left over veggies and extra people to feed.  I used beef broth because that is what I had on had.  Cleaned out the fridge for the veggies.  Also added a bit of Italian seasoning. You won't be sorry you tried this recipe.

I really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes as others do, because I didn't have all of the same ingredients.  Substituted kale for cabbage and real tomato instead of tomato sauce.  Added garlic and onion powder, thyme, basil, black pepper.  Deeeelicious.  Tastes like it came from a restaurant!  Thanks!!

This recipe is definitely a 'keeper' - it turned out very, very flavourful.  The soup was filling, yet not heavy. I substituted 3/4 of a zucchini for the cabbage (for no other reason than I didn't have any cabbage on hand).  Will be making this again and again.

I mixed it up a bit, but it the base was awesome! I made it in the slow cooker, and used kidney and garbonzo beans instead of the cannellini beans, added a 1/2 cup of green beans, and used spinach instead of cabbage.  I also threw in some italian seasoning. Definitely a do again!

This recipe is delicious. It takes a while to chop all the veggies, but it freezes well and makes great leftovers. We like it with lots of cheese. My family raved. We've made it several times... a great recipe to use if you're cooking for a vegitarian.

In my version, I used spinach instead of cabbage. I used a can of kidney beans and a can of small white beans (not cannellini), which worked really well. I left out the cheese as well. I thought the broth was bland, so next time I'll add something to spice it up - probably some basil and red pepper flakes. My family liked it! Will make again.

My hubby says my best soup yet.  The only changes I made were no potatoes or tomato paste. I added 1 tsp.oregeno, 1 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. rosemary, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp. fennel seeds and the addition of 1 lb. of ground meat. I cooked up some Ditalini pasta seperately to add to the soup so that I had plenty of broth.

Great soup!  I switched potatoes for beans and added soup peppers to spice things up a bit but the whole family liked it.

Excellent soup! Everyone in the house love it, but I would suggest cutting the amount of salt in half or getting rid of it alltogether if you decide to use kielbasa or chorizo:-)

Wonderful recipe, thank you!  The recipe is great the way it is, I followed some of my previous reviewers by omitting the cabbage, and substituting kidney beans for the potatoes.  Next time around I will make my own chicken broth for that extra richness, and add zucchini as well.  Lovely soup, thanks again.

Easy and good!  I omitted the cabbage and used Rotelle pasta instead.  It came out great!
