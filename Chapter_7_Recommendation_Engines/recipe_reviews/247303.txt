Make this your smoothie summer, and pledge to enjoy all the luscious fruits of the season.  The perfect proportions are here: so go have fun!

I used half a banana and half an avocado, homemade Greek (strained) yogurt and a big,  Boba-tea straw (which you can clean with a pipe cleaner and use forever). Left out the mint.
