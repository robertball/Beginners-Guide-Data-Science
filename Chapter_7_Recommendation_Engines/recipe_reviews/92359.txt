HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I thought I'd mention the problems I've had the first time around, so they can turn out perfect for you :)  Like, use a sharp knife in a sawing motion along the whole width of cookie while cutting.  Go SLOWLY! That way you don't run out or waste any cookies because they weren't cut down the middle correctly!  Make sure you don't get the generic brand cookies either b/c they don't have a hole in the middle making the shape you need!  Also, it helps to have the hersheys unwrapped and cookies cut for the 24 cupcakes (or however many - that's just the amount a normal cake batter makes).  That way you can do them all at once, which means less handling (messing up your wings), and you can stick in the fridge!  I also like sticking the wings INTO the cupcake and straight up, followed by the hershey kiss in front of it so the kiss doesn't rise up (tips tends to rise up if you angle it at all instead of putting them flat)!  Everyone at my husband's office loved them and thought I was sooo creative. hehehehe  Such a great idea that doesn't take too much work.  Made these along with the spider cupcakes on this site!

THESE CUPCAKES WERE A BIG HIT AT MY SON'S KINDERGARTEN HALLOWEEN PARTY.  I WILL USE A YELLOW CAKE BATTER NEXT TIME AS MY WHOLE CUPCAKE WAS CHOCOLATE.  THIS RECIPE WAS VERY EASY AND NOT VERY TIME CONSUMING.

I made these for my daughters Halloween party at school and they were a big hit!  I bought white icing and colored it orange to make them look more Halloween-y.  They were sooo easy to make and came out so cute.  I made the mistake of buying Wal-Mart brand cookies instead of Keebler and when I got them home I realized they didn't have the hole in the middle which gives the wings their bat shape.

I made these for my ten year old daughter's class Halloween party... when her older sister saw them, she begged me to make them for her class, too!  They were so easy to make and so cute -- the teachers and office staff at the schools raved about how cute they were!  I bought plain chocolate wafer cookies (Nabisco) for the wings, but did use the Hersey's kiss for the head/face and red gel for the eyes.  The gel can be dotted on much easier than tube icing plus the gel has a glow which makes the eyes appear "scary".  This recipe will be a Halloween tradition from now on.

I agree that there needs to be a picture or better instructions.  I tried everything to make these look like bats.  Several people told me they looked like turkeys so maybe I'll make them for Thanksgiving.

This was a great and cute recipe. I took some to my daughter's preschool Halloween party and they were a big hit! I didnt have the red gel, so I used red tic-tacs for the eyes.

Cute and popular at our bake sale event. If you make them the day before be aware that the moisture from the cupcakes softens the cookie "wings" and causes them to break off at the level of the icing.  The next time I make these, I'll hold off on positioning the "wings" until just before serving.

Well this is the first time that I have reviewed a recipe.  These were a hit at my 8yr old sons Halloween party!!  And they were so easy to make, the only problem that I encountered was trying to cut the short bread cookies in half.  But great we will be making these again.

I made many halloween items for my daughter's party ... and this was the BIGGEST hit.  The only difficulty was cutting the cookings without breaking them, but I eventually found that using a sharp serated knife and applying gentle pressure worked well.  Definitely would bake these again!

Very easy dessert even though I didn't do them perfectly.  I think these are great and easy for Hallowe'en.  I just didn't want to take the time to put the eyes on!

These are too cute! I made them for a Halloween party at work and EVERYBODY commented on them. Some of the cookies didn't break apart perfectly but you honestly don't even notice once you stick them in the cupcake. These are ADORABLE. I will be making them again for sure!

I made these for the girls at work and they were a HUGE hit with everyone. I followed the receipe to the Tee, with the exception of the frosting. I made a Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting and that just made them perfect. These were "MMM MMM Good!!"

The only thing I changed was that I used yellow mix and colored it green.  They were so good and a huge hit with the kids and adults.  They turned out so great.  I will be making these every Halloween!  I'll add a picture.

These were adorable and the hit of the Halloween party. I made them first using a generic cookie (Shurfine brand) that had the necessary hole in the middle (makes the bat wing shape on the bottom of the wing). They were so popular, my daughter asked me to make them the following week for her class. This time I picked up the name brand cookie at Walmart. It was a mistake! The cookies kept breaking, no matter how gently I sawed them with a serated knife. It was very annoying and time consuming. I will make these again and again but I will not buy the name brand cookie with the holes in the middle. Definitely not worth it. Also, it looks super cute to use the striped kisses (Hugs). The black and white stripes look great. I put the red gel directly on the white stripe so they stood out much better. The translucensy of the red eyes was perfect against the white background. You definitely have to use red gel to get the best look. Also, be sure to put the cookies straight in at a 90 degree angle. A couple of times, I accidently slanted the cookie at a more upward angle  and it made a huge gap between the head and the wings. Didn't look very good. Other than that, these cookies looked great. Thanks for the great idea!

wicked cute!! i prepared them as the cake package said. I let them cool then decorated one at a time; much easier so the frosting wouldn't harden. I used chocolate frosting w/chocolate sprinkles, cut the fudge stripe cookies in half, put the hershey kiss, and dotted the bat eye. My students loved them-and they were high schoolers! will be making these every year.

So easy to make & what a hit at school!! I made these for my daughter's 2nd grade class party and the kids loved them. The moms wondered when I had time to do anything other than cook these but they were so simple! I used chocolate cake mix for the muffins but white/vanilla frosting so the bats stood out.  The hardest part of this recipe was cutting/breaking the cookies in 1/2 and not have them be lop-sided. I went through an entire pkg of fudge stripes for just 24 cupcakes but got enough perfect 'wings' in the end.  Super-yummy too :)

These were a hit at my sister's annual October Chilifest.  Everyone loved the way they looked and they loved the creativity!  I used boxed cake batter and regular chocolate fudge icing but decorated them exactly the same.  Def. makes an impression!

great recipe, however, I have to believe that I am not the only one that had difficulty getting the cookies to break evenly. So, I got out a cutting board and my butcher knife, and poof!! much easier...I hope this helps.

So easy to decorate, the kids had a blast helping out.  When making the bat wings, the kids found it easier to saw the cookies in half vs pressing down on them to split them in half. When they pressed down on them, the cookie tended to break apart not necessarily in half.  Otherwise, this was a fun project.

Since this whole recipe is the bat thing, I am rating it low. I will claim to be a good cook, but I don't have an artistic bone in my body and I could not get my 2 cookie halves and a hershey kiss to resemble a bat in any way shape or form. This recipe definitely needs a picture AND more specific instructions. (Point facing "forward." What is that???) Sorry but I just couldn't get it to work.

Also, if I ever do get something that looks like a bat, I'd probably use white or orange frosting so you can actually see it, instead of the dark background of chocolate.

So cute!  I made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit!  I tinted vanilla frosting yellow to look like the moon for these bats.  I also used a red velvet cake mix, which really was cool for the Halloween/bat effect!  Except the red does stain fingers!  The only frustrating part was getting the cookie to break in half.  I followed a suggestion of "sawing" the cookie in half, only to have some of them crumble.  I found it quicker to just carefully break them in half.  And it's ok if they are not perfect halves!!  Even bats aren't perfect!  Great idea for a quick and cute Halloween cupcake presentation!

These looked sooooo cool!  Not hard to make either.  I used yellow cake mix as another had suggested, just because of all the chocolate already in the recipe.  Very fun - a real conversation piece at the party!

These cupcakes were really easy and fun to make. The ingredients were easy to find, and kids can help too. Mine came out great. Just be careful cutting your "cookie wings", they may break while your cutting them, so be sure to have plenty of extra cookies.

These came out so darn cute!!  Thanks for the photos - I never would have figured out how to assemble them.  As it was, I first laid the cookies on top of the cupcake instead of inserting them vertically - DUH!  Much less time consuming than the spider cupcakes I've made in the past.  Thanks for sharing!!!

A big hit with the kids and so easy to do.  The only problem I had was with the eyes.  The store was out of red gel icing, so I bought a tube of red decorating icing and put the bat's eyes on with toothpicks.  It worked, but was a little time consuming.

Big hit at party.  I didn't use red eyes, only had white.  I had to cut the wings smaller so they would stay on the cupcake.  Cute idea.

These are beyond cute and adorable. Looked exactly like flying bats with glowing red, beady eyes - perfect for the Halloween bake sale at my son's middle school. They were easy to do. What I did, however, was use a butter knife to make slits in the cupcake for where the cookie wings were going to go in. This way I didn't smoosh the cupcakes when I pressed the wings in. I had everything unwrapped, cut and iced before I did the bats; saved on time and the bats were done in no time. I also made a different chocolate icing. It's one from this site which produces a very light chocolate color, which was better in my mind as the bats really stood out! Thanks for sharing these adorable bats!

I made this for my son's 1st grade Halloween party.  Big hit with the kids and adults!  So easy - and what was even better:  My son had a great time helping and was able to do a few cupcakes himself.  We made an assembly line, and were done quickly.  Note - the Keebler package have enough for 24-26 cupcakes with room for a couple of cutting mistakes (breaking apart) and sampling!   Thanks for making a very happy kid and non stressed mom!

These were a hit at the Halloween party I went to this year! I used dark chocolate frosting and for the cookies I used chocolate doughnut cookies with white frosting stripes.

These super-cute cupcakes were so easy to make!!
I baked the cupcakes one night, then my son's 3rd grade Scout troop assembled their "bats" at our meeting the next day.  
If 8-year-old boys can do it, anyone can. They were a huge hit. I know that we'll do this again next year!

Fun and easy to make!!! I made these five minutes ago, and didn't have any problem putting them together.  My son's school is having a carnival tonight, so let's hope they are a hit. (He chose these from other recipes on the site, and is very excited).

it was great.  the bats were so neat looking.  one word of caution, you have to be careful when you break the cookies for the wings, we had a few lopsided and others just had to be eaten... too small for wings.. haha  other than that this is a fun recipe

I had so much fun making these Batty cakes!  I used dark chocolate cake mix (and dark chocolate kisses too) and creamy white icing.  My only problem was the red gel did not want to stick so I stuck it in the freezer for awhile.   Everyone enjoyed them and was impressed.

They actually looked more like elephants to me than bats, because I saw in the picture a tiny trumpet. On the texture, they looked good and perfect, and on the flavor was an excellent job. For a little bit more flavor I added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Great job. (They looked like elephants.)

I made these with a friend of mine, and they are very good! We made some goofy bats, and some regular. They were very chocolatey and very good. definitely going to make these again, as well as other halloween recipes!
