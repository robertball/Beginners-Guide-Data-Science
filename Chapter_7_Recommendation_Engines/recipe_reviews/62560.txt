I made this tonight for dinner and it was very good. I used two zucchini, added 3 minced cloves of garlic, only two tomatoes, used 1/4 tsp. basil and 1/4 tsp. oregano for the Italian seasoning and also added about 1/2 tsp. salt. I mixed the seasonings in with all the vegetables, instead of just on top. I think it tasted better incorporating the seasoning throughout the dish. I also sprinkled a tad bit of Parmesan along with the mozzarella, and also used only about half the amount of cheese. 8 oz seemed a little much... maybe if you used a larger casserole dish you would use more cheese. Anyway, it was really a wonderful side dish and my sister, who has hated zucchini forever said it was actually very good and that she meant it. I think that says a lot! Everyone enjoyed this dish and it was a great combination of vegetables. Yummy!

I love this dish, but I also had a problem with sogginess. I solved it by using a carton of chopped tomatos, & simply drained them. YUM!

I made this for dinner tonight and I found that the tomatoes were really just far too wet, possibly because of the ones I used, and the green peppers didn't seem to get cooked enough. I think the next time I try this I'll only use the zucchini, onions, and cheese as well as putting some sliced mushrooms in with the zucchini and onion when it's in the skillit. MMMM now that sounds good.

We loved this! I had an abundance of zucchini and peppers from my garden, but no tomatoes. I used a 15 oz cn aof petite diced tomatoes which I drained. I have fresh herbs growing right outside my kitchen, so I used parsley, thyme, and oregano in place of Italian seasoning.  This took about 45 minutes to be done (cheese bubbly and slightly browned.) My husband loved this and had three helpings. This will definitely be made again!

I gave this recipe 5 stars for flavor.  I did make some changes...used cheddar because I didn't have mozzarella, and lined the bottom of the casserole dish with bread crumbs...The crumbs absorbed any extra liquid and they tasted good as well.  I stirred them into the casserole before serving it with  freshly grated parmesan cheese on the side, which I believe enhanced its flavor.

I made this as a side dish...wow! Was I surprised! I too used 2 zucchinis and half the tomtatoes.  In addition, I "layered" the veggies, starting w/ the zucchini, then onions, green peppers, and tomatoes - sprinkling a little italian seasoning on each layer. I didn't think something so simple would turn out so good but we all enjoyed this and I'll be sure to make again when the garden is full of these goodies!! Thanks Juzella!

Had a great first attempt. Loved the cheese and Italian seasonings. Wish I had read the reviews first as I did experience the wateriness. I will drain the tomatoes next time. Maybe add some more peppers. Great summer meal. My wife loved it!

Its a great way to eat your veggies.  Like the others, I thought the dish was a little wet in the bottom.  I used some parmesan cheese with the mozarella, cooked the peppers with the zucchini and tossed the seasoning with all the ingredients.  I used two medium zucchini, one large tomato, and 1/3 of an onion.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I did tweak it a little. I added one extra zucchini, 3 cloves of garlic and only used 2 tomatoes. Mixed all the ingrediants together instead of as a topping and added a little parmesan. Everyone loved it. I'm going to double my recipe next time as this is JUST enough for 4 people.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was very good. I added garlic. I used bread crumbs on the bottom to absorb the juice that others complain about and its a true keeper

I've been making this for 30 years, only I use Cheddar Cheese.  As it turns out similar to stewed tomatoes, I add some toasted croutons to soak up juicieness of the tomatoes.  I also add garlic, Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper, worchestershire sauce and a pinch of sugar to counteract the acidity of the tomatoes.

Very disappointing. Soggy and the cheese end up in clumps when it cools. It was so bland even after adding salt and pepper as per other reviews. I will not make this again.

I love all the ingredients in this dish and thought it would become one of my favorites. I was disappointed. The end result was rather wet, which I found unappetizing. Not sure if I did something wrong? I wouldn't make again.

Excellent and easy dish.  Just make sure you drain off the water during baking to avoid sogginess.  It was really delicious. Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't sure if it was a typo or not, so I went ahead and sauteed the green pepper with the zucchini and onion. Now that I think about it, it would have probably been fine follow the directions. I'm still learning, so I tend to do whats comfortable. We really enjoyed this for dinner and the next day for lunch, but the casserole dish was a little wet in the bottom.  Maybe I just had some real juicy tomatoes! (I only used 2)

I used olive oil for the squash(6 smaller ones), loose Italian sausage (1.5 lbs) and peppers(2), and added added onion(1) and 2 cloves of garlic after cooking on low to mid heat for 8 minutes. Before putting in the oven added 1 can diced tomatoes w/Italian seasoning, fresh basil(6 leaves) and oregano and mixed. I placed in a 9x13 glass baking dish, sprinkled with parmesan and shredded Italian cheese and baked at 350° for 35 minutes, covered. Made a yummy main dish with the addition of the sausage! Pretty quick to prep too!

The tomatoes seemed overwhelming, but I didn't remove the core or seeds (and they left a lot of water in the bottom).  The onion/zucchini took a lot longer than five minutes (in a large stainless steel pan), yet I think I should've cut the onion smaller (I cut out slices instead of dice).  The cheese kept stringing together so it wouldn't mix evenly with the vegetables while eating it.  Mine fit in a 3 quart baking dish (for those curious about what size "medium casserole dish" is).  I definitely want to give this dish another chance, just with small alterations to how I prepared and cooked it (especially longer baking time, as that may explain why the cheese didn't mix well).

I made this using several of the modifications suggested by other reviewers. It was soggy with only 1 tomato but the taste was good. I did use garlic, Parmesan and incorporated the spices. I liked the bread crumb idea and may try that next time to decrease the liquid. Good use for zucchini.

I didn’t exactly follow the recipe, but it gave me a good start.  After reading the reviews, I used my cast iron skillet.  I had yellow squash that I needed to use, so first, I heated the skillet, added a small amount of olive oil, sautéed onions and bell peppers, put those aside in a bowl, then sautéed yellow & zucchini squash, added garlic, put the onions & peppers back in the skillet, added the drained tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, fresh ground pepper, mixed in bread crumbs & shredded Parmesan cheese, then added more Parmesan to the top and baked at 375 for about 30 minutes, until the top browned.  It was delicious!

My entire family loved this dish. I am the weird one among us in that I could probably eat my weight in zucchini, there's something about it which is just magical. Anyway, I was nervous and all that dissipated once they took their first bite. I think the word "magical!" was used multiple times, something that I rarely get when making food, I made a few adjustments.The first was to address the sogginess. I saw many people talk about adding croutons. Well, didn't have those but used to regularly make a dish involving zucchini that had me adding Special K. So that's what I did here, I simply put a decent layer on the bottom and again on the top. This really soaked up any extra juices and holy  did it just add so much flavour. Beyond that, I found a big can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning. I saw others suggesting these, but suggesting to drain them. This can was I believe a 28oz can, so quite sizeable. I'm fairly sure I bumped up the zucchini and other ingredients as well. Lastly, spices/frying. I tossed in some of my Italian seasoning along with oregano, but I think what MADE the dish was the prep of the various ingredients. I decided to try something different and use a similar distribution of butter in place of my standard EVOO. All I can say is WOW, it has brought so much more flavour to the fried ingredients, I never expected it but just WOW!

Have made this recipe twice now, the first time quite a lot of juice as stated. The second time I made it I put a layer of orzo on the bottom of the dish to soak up all those lovely juices (could probably use couscous ) and de-seeded the tomatoes. I used garlic, basil,parsley,oregano, a crumbled stock cube and diced yellow pepper, also  2 balls of mozzarella, sliced, on top.  No need to grease the casserole dish and bake uncovered!  Tried a combination of olive oil and chilli oil  and used that not butter to sauté veg. Definitely a five star recipe!!

This was a good sidedish but not anything real special.

I'm vegetarian and this has become a favorite of mine, but my daughters, who are not vegetarian, also love it as a side-dish.  (My zucchini-hating husband won't rry it, so he doesn't get a vote in rating it!)
