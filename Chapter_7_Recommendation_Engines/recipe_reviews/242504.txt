This was so good. I did cook the potatoes a bit before hand because I like them in small cubes. Kale phobes, you can't really taste it as the smoked salmon has quite a strong flavor.

I will admit I first read the ingredients and knew I had them on hand, but I was SO afraid to make this because of the potato. I was trying to figure out if I needed to cook the potato first, or if it was meant to be raw. I proceeded and cut the potato into thin slices and assembled the frittata. Oh WOW! This seems like it could have come out of a gourmet kitchen!!! Certainly a keeper and a delicious frittata at that!!!

The potatoes did not cook. I tried to make half the recipe, and that called for one potato. It was way too much and didn't cook all the way through.

Made it exactly as directed. I was a little worried that the potatoes wouldn't cook but they worked out perfectly. Felt it was missing a little something - maybe next time I'll squeeze some lemon slices on when serving. I'll definitely make it again
