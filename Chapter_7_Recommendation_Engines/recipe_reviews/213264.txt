Amazing! Can't believe how easy this is to make and my whole family just loved this meal. Super easy. Just drop in the ingredients and turn on the pot. I didn't do the 1 hr high setting followed by 4 low. Instead, I put everything in the pot the night before and put it in the fridge. Pulled the pot out in the morning and cranked the dial to low. Left it in 8+ hours. Fantastic!

Made this chili today and my husband and I loved it! We are snowed in and it made a perfect comfort-food dinner! I made a few changes, however. I added a bit more brown sugar (another TBSP or so), added a small can of Hunt's diced tomatos, and because I did not have the black bean chili sauce on hand, I used a TBSP + a few pinches more of chili powder as a substitute. Served it topped with shredded, marbled cheddar cheese and a little sour cream on top. Really, really yummy...

Cookin Fool, I just love you!  This dish was my first of many that I have tried of yours.  I am not that great of a cook...many would agree, but you make me look sooooo good!  I just started a foodie website because I love food and try out a ton of recipes.  I put your recipe (all credit going to you) on my website.  I just posted it today, so I don't have any reactions yet, but I'm sure my readers will love it as much as I do!  Perhaps you should start a cooking blog for all your recipes!!!  Oh yeah, about the dish, it's super yummy, I would recommend this dish for the pickiest kids, the veggies just blend in, they'll never know!  Thanks,  Chrysta

This was really good. I did not have the Asian Chili Black Bean Sauce and could not find it after going to 3 grocery stores so I just added a can of Rotel diced Tomatoes with Green chili's. It gave it that Hot Sweet taste that the Asian Black Bean Sauce would of added. We really enjoyed this with some Frito's on top and a fresh loaf of French Bread. Yum, Thanks for the Recipe.

AWESOME !  Based on suggestions, I mixed all ingredients together the night before (minus the chicken), put it in the crock pot in the morning with frozen chicken breasts and when we got home, we had the most wonderful dinner !  No leftovers at all!  Thanks so much !

This was SO tasty - who knew that the chicken would shred so well and taste so delicious in a chili, and loved the flavouring of all the beans!

So easy and tasty! My  16 year old loves this and he is the definition of a picky eater. Making it tonight and added a small can of green chilies instead of bell pepper.

super easy, and tasty...still, it seemed like something was missing...but once it was topped with cheese, crumpled tortilla chips and sour cream, that did the trick! i didnt have green peppers, so i left that out...and i had to add garlic....because, well...one should always add garlic :)  i will definitely make this again...and i think diced tomatoes would be a great addition as well.  thanks

I have made this twice. The second time by accident. It always sounds so good but my kids will not eat it. I am not sure if it is the thick consistency or what but I won't make it again. I think our family must lean more toward liking savory over sweet. I prepared it exactly as written.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  We had this for dinner tonight and the family just demolished it!  I didn't have a can of black beans so I only used a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans and it still turned out delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I sprinkled some dried crushed chili flakes on top. The house smelled soooo good while it was cooking.  Thanks for submitting this fabulous recipe.

I won a chili cook off recipe with this- there were at least 25 other chilis.  I couldn't find the Asian chili black bean sauce so I used sweet chili sauce instead. I ended up putting approx 3 tbsp of it in. I think it helped sweeten it a little more. Delicious!!

Husband really liked it. I found the sweetness to be a little to much after a few bites. Next time I'll cut the sugar back a bit

I didn't have the black bean chili sauce but I did have a jar of black bean and garlic sauce and a jar of Thai chili sauce so I added a tablespoon of each.  I thought the sauce needed something, so I added some garlic. We ate the chili with rice.  Nice winter meal.

This was okay. Just my preference I guess, but I didnt really care for it. Neither did hubby. Maybe if I could have had it with tortilla chips or rice I would have liked it better. We served it over cornbread as another reviewer suggested. Probably wont make this again.

I'm giving this 5...but more of a 4 1/2 (I'm tough on ratings). So easy to make...family loved it. I couldnt find asian chili sauce so I used asian black bean garlic sauce and added 2 tbs chili powder. Subbed kidney for the pintos (we like them better) and added a can of diced tomatoes. Delish. Serverd with cheese, sour cream and corn bread. Family ate it up

Love it! The first chili recipe I've made the the whole family likes! Thank you for sharing. I didn't change or add to the recipe like I usually do and I didn't need to. Used the Splenda brown sugar blend and it tasted great!

This recipe was outstanding! Took about 15 minutes including chopping the veggies at the beginning and shredding the chicken at the end. I only used 3 chicken breasts and put them on top of the bean mixture. I drained, but didn't rinse the beans; added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with chili seasonings; couldn't find the Asian chili black bean sauce, so I used plain Asian black bean sauce and added 2 Tbsp of chili powder. Cooked on low for 8 hours, shredded the chicken and put the chicken back into the sauce to mix it all up.I served it with Frito scoops, but not the sour cream and cheese

This recipe smelled and tasted like baked beans.  No one in my family liked this meal and I would not make this again.  I will have to find another use for the asian chilli black bean sauce.

This chili was SO good. I was looking for something to make with my Black Bean Sauce that I had on hand and this fit the bill - I had everything in my kitchen except the onion and green peppers. I omitted the peppers and used some Onion! Onion! from Tastefully Simple.  I doubt either of those affected the flavor much, if at all.  This was a fantastic blend of savory and sweet, and my husband even asked for leftovers of it the next night.

This was very good! As suggested by others I added a can of diced green chilis and some garlic. and please for the love of all things holy--rinse your beans and toss the liquid they come with, just sub the same amt in water. If not, your beans will create a lot of gas in your diners! This is a trick I always employ. 

The chili was not cooked after 1 high and 4 low so next time I will go all day on low.

I didn't have the asian black bean stuff, so I used hoisin sauce.  I added  a smidge more brown sugar and vinegar at the end because it seemed to need something.  I also put salt and pepper on the chicken while pre-heating the rest of the ingredients to help cut an hour off the recipie.  YUMMMM.

Very little flavor and recipe calls for entirely too much chicken, creating a very unpalatable texture.  Ended up adding Tobasco sauce and chili powder upon serving to get any taste at all.  If I used this recipe again, I would cut the chicken amount in half, subsitute or add seasoned chili beans with the recommended beans and add all the seasonings that are normally applied to a traditional chili recipe.

I have been looking for a better chili recipe for years.  My family complains about how often I serve chili.  Finally, I have found the chili recipe I have been looking for - even though the family (and I) feel that without chili powder it isn't really chili.  This is a winner.  It is delicious!

Flavor was good - I would definitely NOT call this a chili though.  Maybe Asian chili?  When people tried, they were expecting that chili flavor  - and I think were surprised when there was none. Got mix reactions, 6 breasts make A LOT.

Very easy and tasty! I was worried about my Crock-Pot not being large enough for all of these ingredients but it worked out fine. I did not have Asian chili black bean sauce but added some Sriracha hot sauce because we like our chili with some kick. I also added about 2/3 cup of chicken stock.

We are expecting 10-15" snow in our city tomorrow so I am looking forward to these leftovers when we are stuck inside.

Wow. Just...wow. Followed recipe, except added fresh garlic and a bit of chili powder. MAKE SURE TO GET THE BLACK BEAN SAUCE. It was well worth it, and I can tell how much it added to the flavor. Thank you for sharing something so simple yet wonderful.

Delicious!  Only change was subbing kidney beans for a can of hot chili beans, adding a couple tablespoons of my homemade chili powder, and adding a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  (~2lbs of chicken breast was perfect)

I was looking for a slow cooker chili recipe for a school event.  This was great. I doubled the recipe and it filed my crock pot.  Many folks raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I did not make any changes to it. The chicken shredded super easy.  Cooked on low for 8 hours.  It was even better the next day. Thanks.

Very easy and good.  I do not like things too sweet so I cut the sugar in half as I generally do.  It probably was not a necessary adjustment in this recipe.  The Asian chili black bean sauce added a lovely complexity to the recipe.

I loved it but next time I will use half the chicken and double the beans... the chicken kind of took over the chili.

Easy to make.  Very easy to shred the chicken, but there was too much chicken and I only used 5 breasts.  I didn't think it was sweet.  There was hardly any liquid in the "chili."  We had it on torillas.  It wasn't spicy enough for us even with my modifications.  I followed alot of ideas from other reviewers.  I drained and rinsed the beans.  I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes (UNdrained).  I also added 2 T chili powder, 2 cloves of garlic minced.  Next time I would use 3 T of garlic powder and add green chilies.

I WON A CHILI COOK OFF WITH THIS RECIPE! It is so good and so easy.  I didn't have the Chinese chili powder (or any chili powder) so I added a little chipotle powder for some spice and followed everything else exactly. It is delicious!

I love this recipe!!!  Everyone I have cooked it for loves it as well.  I made it once when I didn't have the tomato paste on hand and actually liked it better.  I'm a cheese freak and without the tomato paste, the sharp cheddar cheese flavor was more prevalent.  This is a keeper!!!

This was great. So easy & so good. I added a second can of tomato paste & an extra helping of Asian Black Bean Sauce. Didn't hurt either.I had to because the chickens I used were really big. Get a good loaf of Italian bread as a side. My wife was really impressed as were all 3 dogs. That ain't easy in this house. Best enjoyed while watching football all day.

This was uh-mazing! My husband loved it! The chicken was so so tender! I did not add the brown sugar because I didn't have any, and I didn't add the rice vinegar because I didn't think I'd use it again if I bought a bottle, and I couldn't find the black bean sauce. With all those omissions, it still turned out terrific! I added a can of tomatoes and green chilies and it gave it a mild spice that was to die for! Will definitely make this again!

It smelled great and it was very satisfying in my belly and lasted for a long time, but it was disappointing in that it seemed to be lacking in any truly distinguishing flavour.  I was hoping for something a bit more.

Wow!  This was excellent; however, I'm giving it 4 stars because of changes I made--just a couple of minor ones, though.  I added a can of Northern beans to the mix because the chicken breasts I had were huge, and with all that chicken, I knew another can of beans would be necessary.  I also didn't have any tomato paste on hand, so I used curry paste, instead. YUM! (and the smell was heavenly).  I'll have to try it with just the tomato paste and see what the difference is, but my husband said, "When are you going to make this again?"  DELICIOUS!

Delicious. My friend doesn't like beans so I substituted white onions, red onions, diced tomatoes, and green bell peppers for beans and it turned out great.

This recipe shows how different people have different tastes.  Everyone in my family LOVED this, but I thought it lacked flavor.  Of course their "lovin' it" came AFTER I made some changes at the end of cooking time because of the "something's missing" feeling.  Even though I only used 4 chicken breasts, it was very thick (thick enough to put on tortillas -- hmm, that might be something to try next time).  I added some salsa I had on hand and some extra water to help this.  It also needed more salt.  I added sour cream and tortilla chips to mine, but everyone else liked it the way it was.  Personally, I prefer the Southwestern White Bean Soup from this site, but the thought of keeping it thick and putting it on tortillas might inspire me to work on the recipe a bit and serve it that way instead of like a stew/chili.

We thought this chili had excellent taste. But, I didn't read the recipe very well. I drained and rinsed the beans; then realized that I did wrong! I added two cans of diced tomatoes (UNdrained). Also, I couldn't find the Black Bean Sauce in our small town, so substituted with 1 Tablespoon chili powder.   I'm anxious to try the recipe the correct way. But even with my screw up, it was delicious. I served it over rice with sour cream and extra grated cheese and tortilla chips.

Loved it! I didn't realize until it was too late, but I'd actually gotten pork chops out of the freezer instead of chicken breasts. No matter, I just gave it an extra hour and it still shredded nicely and tasted terrific.

Oh, I also used BBQ sauce instead of tomato paste. Yum!

This recipe is top drawer because it's deliciousness is matched with the ease in making it!  Instead of throwin in chicken breasts, I just used the remainder of the whole chicken we had from last night's feast. About halfway into the cooking, I picked out the bones, which had already parted with the meat. I added some garlic and rice to enhance flavors and make it more filling.

We love this recipe! Even my picky kids eat it. I follow the recipe exactly, only cooking it on low 8 hours while I'm at work. It comes out perfect every time. I serve it over white sticky rice and it's the perfect meal! I made this for my extended family's chili cookout and it was gone in a matter of minutes, everyone loved it.

This is yummy! I like to do things the hard way (apparently), so I boiled a whole chicken and shredded the meat and used the stock to cook dried beans in the crockpot.  I am excited to find a recipe to use my black bean sauce!  That said, here are my notes: I may have put too much brown sugar or maybe it is a bit sweet for my taste.  Next time I will taste as I add it in.  I feel like it needs more vinegar.  Green Tabasco sauce and sour cream on top before serving would probably make this amazing.  I put some sriracha in mine and it was pretty good as well...

I absolutely LOVE this Chicken Chili! Although I did some adjustments and believe they were great ones. Instead of green pepper I put one of each orange, yellow and red and only one onion. I also added more brown sugar, 1tsp of regular chili sauce, hoisin sauce(incase you can't find Asian black bean chili). 2 cans each of the beans and a can of diced tomatoes. Also for a little spice I added 3 habaneros!  Cooking it as I type! Mmmmmm!

We loved it. At first I thought it would be too much chicken but it shredded beautifully. I couldn't find Asian  black bean chili sauce so I bought an Asian black bean sauce  (more for stir fry) and added a can of green chilis. I used 2TBSP of the Black Bean Sauce and 3TBSP of the Rice Vinegar. Served with cornbread

Delicious! Perfect for a snowy day like today, but I'll be making this even in the summer! I made it exactly as written - wouldn't change a thing. Definitely add the grated cheese and sour cream when you serve it.

It was too sweet and otherwise bland. Had to add more tomato paste, water, cumin, blackening cayenne pepper and red pepper to make it the least bit palatable. Won't be doing this one again!

This is one of our family favorites. We've gone vegan now, but this is a dish I really miss! You can make it without the sugar and it's fine. Shredding the chicken and putting it back in the crock pot for a little more cooking time makes it just perfect.

I used only 4 chicken breasts, cannellini beans instead of kidney beans (that's what I had), a can of tomatoes with green chilis (because I had them),no black bean paste, and didn't add the sea salt. It was very easy and delicious!  Will definitely make it again and again. Yummmmm!

This was awesome.  I added some celery and carrots, and an 8 oz can of pasta sauce because I wanted more liquid in the dish.  In lieu of the Asian bean sauce, I used Sriracha.  I also reduced the brown sugar from 1/3 cup to 1/4 cup.  For the rice vinegar, I substituted apple cider vinegar.   Will definitely make this again.
