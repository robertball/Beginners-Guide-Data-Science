This was a fabulous recipe. We used this for our very first meatless Monday. We certainly didn't feel deprived! Very filling and rich. I would recommend you dish the vegetables out instead of pouring the pan over the rice. It made the rice a little too moist again.

This was flat out awesome!  I thought it might be a little bland, so I added some adobo (the magic spice).  It was filling & super healthy!

Perhaps it's because we didn't use "Campbell's" broth ;-), but this wasn't as "flavorful" as we had hoped. It did help us use up a bunch of random extra food in the fridge, which was our goal!

I did not have all of the vegetables called for, but the green onions, yellow squash, and asparagus were plenty. I added some leftover pieces of glazed ham. Yum! We will definitely make this again!

Very good flavor.  Cook time is too long; done in less than 40 minutes.

Love this! Full of veggies.  More veggies than risotto, but nice, fresh flavor.

I followed the recipe pretty strictly, and this was very filling and tasty. However, it took me much longer than 20 minutes to chop all the vegetables (maybe I am just slow), and some of them were still pretty crunchy after cooking. I had to feed my family something else quickly because this was not done cooking when I anticipated. The risotto turned out beautifully; thanks for showing us how to actually cook risotto properly. I would try this again, when I have more of a cushion with time.

This was really good!
I had to make a few modifications.  I didn't have green onions, so I sauteed 1 chopped onion with the chopped bell peppers.  Then I added them to the pan with the rest of the veggies and roasted for 25-30 minutes.
I also used chicken broth instead of veggie because it's what I had on hand.
I used 1/2 tsp. of ground dried rosemary but am sure that fresh would have been a lot better.
I used brown rice instead of white and cooked it the regular way (sauteed it in some ghee before adding all the chicken broth).  A brown rice risotto would have been excellent, but I didn't want to take the time to make it that way.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. I liked how colorful the dish was. I did have to add extra vegetable broth to get the rice cooked though.
