My husband just said "this is like a cinnamon roll, but not the outside, the yummy inside that I love"

Yep, I doubled the cinnamon and added a sugar glaze. Its seriously so good! I used sourdough and french bread mix that I had left over and man they were good! 

The reason that some of you say that it tastes like scrambled egg is that you mixed the hot milk and the egg together too quickly. If you add hot milk to egg, it instantly scrambles. You shouold add a little bit of the hot milk at a time while using a whisk to keep it from scrambling. Once you get most of the hot milk in, you can dump the rest in, but make sure you keep whisking. This helps incorporate the milk and the egg without cooking the egg. Dump immediately into the bread and throw into the oven!

I've made this twice now.  The first time was really runny, but the second time was much better.  I learned a few things.  One is to let the brown sugar and hot water sit long enough to dissolve the brown sugar.  Two, instead of pouring the sugar and water over, drizzle it so the syrup soaks into the bread.  When I poured it, it mostly collected on the bottom.
I did not add the 1/2 cup sugar either time and it was still really sweet!

I made this tonight using Pain Au Levain (Country French bread) and doubled the recipe except I did not double the water/brown sugar mixture and the regular sugar.  Other reviewers said it was too sweet so I made that adjustment.  I also added a little extra cinnamon because I like the flavor.  I used a glass 13x9 pan and baked for an hour.  I will always make this bread pudding in a 13x9.  It came out perfect!

Absolutely excellent bread pudding.  The family loved it and I loved the fact that it was so easy to make.  This is something that could be thrown together easily when unannounced guests show up.  Thanks, Tammie!

Will someone please help me? I made this and it tasted soooooooo good on top, but was so soggy and watery on the bottom. I used 1% milk, and I'm thinking maybe this gave it the watery consistency? I think next time, I will omit the water and just mix the brown sugar with milk, instead of adding the milk as the extra topping. This was my first time tasting bread pudding, so I'm not even sure what it's supposed to be like, but this was like scrambled eggs on the bottom. I had so much hope for this recipe, so if anyone can think of anything I might have done wrong, please tell!

So EASY & DELISH! The only thing I did different was use some (soft) stuffing cubes I had leftover from the holidays. I did put a  few dabs of butter on top and sprinkle the top (VERY sparingly!) with a bit more cinnamon and sugar. It was very sweet, but I intended it for a dessert! Served it warm with some cinnamon ice cream...kids gobbled it up and thought they were in heaven!

I just made this for a Bunko party last night. Since I'm 15-20 years younger than most of the ladies I was trying to make a good impression. I used Cinnabon bread. I only used 1/2 the sugar so it wasn't too sweet. Then I topped it fresh from the oven with Vanilla Bean ice cream. They were amazed that such a "young girl" (HA I'm 34!) would make such a delicious bread pudding. I sent them all to the website! I love it! Thanks!

Tastes like french toast with the syrup on.  I plan on making it when we have overnight guests as it's easier to make than individual french toasts.  The key is using a good, crusty bread and not the typical sandwich bread that is very soft.

This is such a simple, yummy recipe that makes the whole house smell wonderful! I also made a caramel sauce that I served warm on top: 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and 2 tbsp corn syrup - combine ingredients in small sauce pan and stir over high heat for one minute.  Delicious!

This was very good, however I made a few changes after reading some of the reviews. I let the brown sugar dissolve in the hot water before pouring it over the bread, I doubled the amount of bread and cinnamon and added an extra cup of milk. To prevent the eggs from scrambling, I gradually added the hot milk to the egg mixture, while using a whisk. I used a 9X13 pan and baked it for 45 minutes. With changes the bread pudding turned out great - not too sweet and not too soggy.

Nice, comforting bread pudding recipe.  I made no changes, except to add some additional caramel sauce when serving.  We thought this was best served warm with whipped cream and the caramel sauce.

Pretty darn yummy!

I made the following changes:
My bread was not day old, and I used two different kinds: Cinnamon swirl bread and croissants. I used 8 mini croissants and about 6 slices of the bread, purchased from Albertsons, and I halved the recipe below. I also replaced half of the water with melted butter (I replace as much water with as much butter as possible in all recipes.. water is flavorless =( ) and I also did not use the cinnamon because it was already in the bread. 

I changed the procedure a bit as well. Poured the water brown sugar mixture over the bread in a large bowl. Mixed the eggs with the sugar, vanilla, and salt, then tempered in the hot milk. I then poured that mixture over the bread and mixed it up, then filled 4 custard ramicans (two had raisins, two did not.) Baked them for 24 mins.

I covered my bread puddings with my "Cheater's Crème Anglaise" (Melted vanilla ice cream.. shhhhh!!!)

Very small modifications, one VERY delicious dessert!

I originally started with this as my base recipe but made a few modifications as it always came out runny and soggy as is. I now use 1 whole loaf of Peppridge Farm Cinnamon Swirl Bread - discard end pieces and cut off crust. 1/2 cut hot water and 1 cup brown sugar for caramel part. Sugar has to dissolve before drizzling over bread. Also, instead of milk, I use heavy whipping cream. Be sure that it is just warm and not hot... otherwise it tastes like a sweet egg bake when you're done.   Normally I wouldn't give a recipe so many stars after making this many modifications, but this gave me a great start to my own recipe that everyone seems to enjoy.

Mine was a little runny.  It did have a good flavor, similar to a cinnamon roll but not my favorite bread pudding recipe.  The pineapple bread pudding recipe on this site is still my favorite.

Easy and tasty.  I used bread crusts that were set aside from another brunch recipe.  I prepped the recipe the night before and baked in the morning.  It really rises in the oven, so be sure to give it space.

Good stuff, I would make it again.  I used a package of hot dog buns that needed using.  I think next time I would use a 9x13 pan instead of the deep casserole dish I used, it took much longer to bake.

This recipe is great, but a bit too runny. I use 1/3 cup of water and 1 cup of brown sugar for the drizzle. Also, I use only 1 3/4 cup of warm milk instead of 2.

Great recipe - my family LOVES it and has requested it over and over!  I doubled the recipe, and used 18 hot dog rolls (cubed) for the bread.  I sprayed a deep 13 x 9 dish with pam, and baked for 1 hour. I also added some extra cinnamon and pats of butter on top before baking. I did find that to prevent the liquid from pooling at the bottom, just stir in the water/brown sugar gradually to the cubed bread, then let it sit and soak it up a bit and toss the bread cubes again before adding the rest of the ingredients, and it works beautifully! Served warm with whipped cream, DELICIOUS!

This turned out really good.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and waited awhile for the hot water to really dissolve the brown sugar before slowly pouring it over the bread (not just dumping it).  I made sure that the bread soaked-up all of the sugar water.  I also slowly whisked the hot milk into the eggs to make sure the milk didn't cook the eggs.  Then before putting it into the oven I sprinkled some chocolate chips over the top.

I got this recipe quite a while back but never made it until today.  I had absolutely no milk in the house but thought I would try it without the milk.  The water mixture moistened the bread and I then put on the egg mixture (sugar etc.) and I quadrupled the cinnamon and added raisins.  This is great if somebody is lactose intolerant.  I will make it again as I am a great lover of bread pudding.

I made just made this recipe. It was so easy. I substituded the white bread with brown and added some raisins and omitted an egg. I served it with vanilla yogurt. It was to die for. My kids loved it and want me to make it all the time. It is also a little bit healthier.

It tastes like soggy french toast.  Was not impressed.  There was so much bread in it, you could hardly tell there is pudding.

I agree with some of the other reviews.  The middle was extremely mushy and egg-y, to the point I thought I did something wrong.  I did not use whole milk, but the recipe does not specify.  I chopped it up and put it back in the oven.  I'm waiting for it now, so we'll see if that helps at all, but will not make it again.

This was just OK.  I LOVE bread pudding.  Took a few tips and made sure brown sugar was completely dissolved, and let it sit for a moment to absorb liquid before putting in oven.  Plus even  added a couple TB of butter.  But, it lacked flavor, and the texture was pretty light.  I usually like a very rich and creamy bread pudding, and this was not it.  It wasn't a waste of ingredients, but I won't make it again.  Sorry.

This a huge favorite of mine! I've used oat-nut bread, raisin bread, multi-grain bread. They all bring something new and delicious to it, though it's excellent with plain ol' white bread too. Definitely let the brown sugar mixture soak into the bread, well before adding the warm (not hot!!!) milk/egg mixture, and maybe even toss the moistened bread up a little bit to get even coverage. Fantastic warm, great from the fridge the next day for breakfast.

I made this tonight for my husband.  It was so runny, and soggy.  I can't figure out if I did something wrong.  I went back after pouring it down the drain, and carefully read the reccipe over again.  Can see nothing I deviated from at all.  I notice a couple other peole commented it was soggy.

I threw together a halved portion of this recipe to use up just a few pieces of several day old rustic french bread.  This is the first time I've made bread pudding and one of the few times I've eaten it.  My husband had never tried it.  We both enjoyed the subtle cinnamon roll kind of flavor and especially liked the crispy top.  I think the inside turned out just right - somewhat custardy, but not soggy or runny.  I'm not positive about the results because I don't have much to compare it to!  But we enjoyed this for a different, very homey dessert and might try it again with ice cream & caramel sauce.

I have never made bread pudding before.  I had a stack of leftover waffles in the freezer and used them instead of bread. Delicious. Served the pudding warm with a scoop of ice cream.

I agree with the other reviewer who said this tasted like french toast. We are big fans of bread pudding but did not enjoy this. I added chocolate chips to give it more flavor and it was still blah. Will not make it again.

This recipe has many rave reviews, but i beg to differ. It was a sickeningly sweet disappointment. Waaaay too much sugar! And the addition of the cup of water made it soggy and mushy.

This is beautiful.  It doesn't have that yeasty-alcohol flavor of which so many bread puddings are guilty.  Easy and perfectly turned out.  I think next time I will try omitting an egg as another reviewer suggested.

I don't know what JSM was talking about...being too much bread?  It's called "BREAD" pudding.  :)  Anyway, I'm giving it 5 stars.  It was delicious, moist, and I didn't change anything except the kind of bread I used.  I had some leftover Irish soda bread with raisins in it from St.Paddy's Day that I didn't want to go to waste.  It made wonderful bread pudding because it was a rather sweet bread to begin with.  The soda bread was homemade, not store bought stuff, so it was a truly homemade bread pudding.  I will definitely do this again and may make soda bread specifically for this recipe and not wait until after St. Paddy's Day to make the bread pudding.  Thanks for posting this great recipe.  My hubby loved it too!

Just the smell of this as it neared the end of baking was enough to make you want to eat the whole pan by yourself. The easy and quick prep time just adds to this being one of our favorite weekly desserts. Yummy.

Very sweet, would cut down the sugar next time. Also made with Cinnamon coffee bread which didn't help the sweetness. But definitely would make again if we have an urge for bread pudding. First time making one. Easy.

really yummy. i made it for my coworkers for thanksgiving. im not familiar with bread pudding so i did not know what it was supposed to taste like.  everybody loved it and wanted the recipe.  i  used one less egg than called for.  i used whole wheat bread.  i have a  love affair with cinnamon so i used alot. i also added more bread on the top to give a crispy texture on top and soft in the middle.  put little pats of butter on top in addition to extra cinnamon and sugar on top. twas delightful for my first attempt.  thanx.

This was a good "basic" recipe for a thicker "eggy" bread pudding.  I enjoyed it for the simple flavor and for the collaboration of very few ingredients.  Would taste better, in my opinion, with a home made bourbon, lemon, or cream sauce.

Ok, initially, I thought it tasted like french toast. It was too eggy...until I refridgerated it overnight. OMG, it was so good the next morning! I also made a thin buttercream frosting (powdered sugar, milk, butter and vanilla) and poured it on top of it...delish! I used white sandwich rolls...worked out great! Very good recipe if you folow the directions and refridgerate it!

My kids and I loved this recipe.  I did drizzle caramel ice cream topping over it when it came out of the oven, but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  We liked it better cold than warm.

I used a 12 x 9 pan and i used 8 slices of bread. It was first time having any type of bread pudding but my ma says it was really great and how its supposed to taste. To me it was good and tasted similar to french toast. I followed the recipe but sprinkled some more cinnamon on top before I put it in the oven.

I love caramel and anything with caramel in it. I also love bread pudding. Great combination. My husband love it too. He isn't a big dessert eater. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy flavorful, and if you can save any it's even better the next day.  It's become a favorit for brunch in our house.  I like it made with old wheat bread.

I had left over hamburger buns (gourmet style) and had never made bread pudding before. I cut the suger in half and it was more than sweet enough. Served warm with vanilla icecream as others suggested and it went like wild fire. I also increased the cinnamon as recomended. Easy and delish!

This bread pudding was very good.  It set up very nicely and had a wonderful brown sugar taste.  The only thing I did different was I used leftover rolls instead of the bread (southern butter rolls from this site) and then topped the pudding with a custard sauce.

So good!  This is a comforting and yummy traditional dessert.  I love the fact that it is made with ingredients that we usually have on hand.  I used left over raisin bread - although any bread would do.  I also served it with whipped cream.

I've made much better bread pudding from other recipes.  This calls for way too much sugar.  My husband said he didn't care for it.  He said it reminded him of mushy undercooked french bread.  It certainly doesn't taste like caramel either!  I did follow this recipe exactly, no variations in case you are wondering.  I would recommend trying a different recipe for bread pudding.

Wonderful recipe.  Very quick & easy.  Served warm & drizzled with warm milk chocolate.  Served to guests & they raved over it.

I used a 2 qt casserole and the end result was a very thin layered pudding.  Next time I will use a smaller dish to get a higher standing pudding.

Thanks for sharing
