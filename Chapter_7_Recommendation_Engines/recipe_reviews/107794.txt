I really enjoyed this recipe, but had to make some changes. I used orange juice to replace the apple juice and cucumber to replace the celery. Also added some yoghurt. It came out really great twice already :)

I screwed around with the recipe since i didnt have pineapple, celery, ginger, nor a juicer, so i used a blender and added in some orange juice in place of what i was missing. The results came out pretty tasty and sweet enough to leave out the sugar.

There is no need for sugar.  If you want it sweeter add an extra apple or two

I didn't add beets because we don't like them. The flavor was really good but couldn't get past the texture. Doing it in a blender just doesn't work. We don't like to chew our drinks. I did blend for a long time, but just didn't smooth out enough for us.

I also tweaked this recipe a bit.  I used a small beet because they are sweeter.  I left out the ginger and the sugar.  If you want it sweeter I would just add more pineapple!  Very good.

This is a very easy juice to whip up in the blender!  I love the ginger, it adds zing to my typical breakfast smoothie!  I'll be making this again!

I just made this. Substituted cucumber for celery. The only thing I regret doing was using the ginger. It overpowers the whole drink. If you must use it. I recommend halfing it.

I did not have beets and I used Stevia instead of sugar and I love it itâ€™s more like a smoothie and juice though depending on how much water you use

Pretty good. The ginger was a little strong, but I just cut off a piece, so it could be my guesstimate of 2 tsp was too much. Will make again.

I couldn't find beets in my grocery store (I know, crazy!) but I had a spare pear and some spinach so I threw that in instead and I must say, it turned out amazing!

Tried this after trying a couple we weren't fond of. I did not add any sugar and liked it just as it was. My very picky 12yr old daughter loved it, she wanted more!

Love it.  I added 10 seedless green grapes, omitted the sugar, and it tastes great

this is a good juice.  To the person who wanted to know if she should cook the beets and carrots, the answer is no.  This is supposed to be a fresh juice made with a juicer.

Does the beet and/or the carrots need to be cooked first?
And all I have is a blender...?  Is that workable?
