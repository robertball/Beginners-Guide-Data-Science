Added some cornmeal to the bottom of the dutch oven because I was concerned about sticking. It came out beautifully! Itâ€™s definitely a type of bread to be eaten with some yummy topping ( as was expected, because of reduced salt). I think I may come back to this recipe to see if I could add some herbs to see how it goes. Good recipe, thanks! :)

I baked it on baking paper;  it was "resting" and rising those minutes while the pan was heating, it was on the paper, so it was easy to transfer it to the Dutch oven.
I loved it, and will definitely make it again.

The bread is a bit dense but toasts like a dream and has a mild flavour.
