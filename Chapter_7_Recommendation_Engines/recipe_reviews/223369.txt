I added jalapenos and chili peppers to make it spicier then mixed the relish with cream cheese to dip nachos in!

This exact recipe is in "The complete book of small batch preserving" its called Sun Relish and uses yellow peppers instead of red. I just made a batch using yellow peppers and my relish turned out a beautiful sunny yellow colour not a dark brown like the picture for this recipe. It's an excellent easy relish that goes wonderful with cream cheese or cheddar. I used two yellow habanero peppers instead of the banana pepper just because that was what I had. I got 6 x 1 c jars. Super easy although I found I had to cook it about 20 mins longer than the 30 mins listed to get it to a thickness appropriate for relish.  The book also says the relish goes very nicely with omelets.

I enjoyed making this jelly but i roasted the red peppers first. I also added jalapenos to spice it up. Next time, less sugar.

Didn't follow the recipe exactly, but turned out great. I used significantly less sugar and still found it to be a little too sweet, but delicious nonetheless. Fabulous on a turkey melt.

I always double this to make 16 8 ounce jars. I use jalepeno peppers for the banana peppers. I also like to use half vinegar and half lemon juice. I like to use my immersion blender to puree. Great poured over cream cheese or to make sweet and sour chicken I pound chicken breasts thinly, saute then pour this over it to glaze.

I made half & used 3/4 banana pepper & 1/3 cup sugar. It turned out great. Next time I shall make it using the entire recipe to share with my family & friends. Thanks Loretta!
