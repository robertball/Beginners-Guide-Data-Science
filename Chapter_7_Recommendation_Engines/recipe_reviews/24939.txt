easy to prepare and very delicious.  The apples that are used make a big difference.  I like Jonathan.

I made it with granola instead of bread crumbs and it was great.

I must have gone wrong somewhere. It was very dry, it never bubbled. Very bland with the primary taste being the breadcrumbs. I would like to try it again as it was easy to make. Any suggestions?

I added pecan pieces, topped it with more melted butter (it looked dry), and cooked it longer.  Everyone loved it.

Sorry, didn't like this recipe.  Breadcrumbs were dry and crumbly or became balls of mush when cooked.  Applesauce added nothing but more mush on the top.  Best part was the apples and cinnamon.

Super easy and tasty.  I added chopped pecans to the bread crumb mix.  My family would enjoy a little more spice to it.  Good basic recipe.  Thanks.

It's good but could be better.  I suggest peeling the apples and using more butter!!
