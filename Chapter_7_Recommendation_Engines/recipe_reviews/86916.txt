I made this for our office "salad Wednesday", they loved it.  I don't know where I saw this but thought it had lettuce, I used chopped romaine.  I also added shredded cheese and tortilla chips to the top.  It's so pretty and tastes even better!

This salad is so good!  I used half the mayo and more veggies than it asked for.  I also used the Taco Seasoning I mix from this site.  Make sure you let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour or it might be too salty.  I served it with tortilla chips and my guests and I couldn't get enough of this salad!

This was simple and tasty. I added black beans and almost doubled the veggies, and still had enough dressing to coat it well. If I was making it as directed I would definitely not need all the dressing.  
     I had it on a bed of lettuce with tortilla chips and made an excellent light dinner. 
    I can't wait to make it for the barbeque I'm headed to next weekend.

I used two ears of fresh corn, cut off the cob, instead of canned plus some extra carrots. jicima and peppers. We spooned it on to romaine lettuce leaves and topped with some shredded chipotle cheddar cheese and some black olives. My son ate his with tortilla chips. It was so good; there were no leftovers!

I was attracted to this salad because it is chock full of power veggies! The high calories and sodium are the only reason I gave it 3 stars.  I tweaked the base recipe a little to reduce the fat and salt.  I used Hellman's canola mayo instead of regular mayo and low fat sour cream.  I also only used 1 avocado - it was plenty for our tastes.  Instead of high sodium taco seasoning, I combined 1 full tsp of cumin, 1 full tsp black pepper,  1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp smoked paprika & 1/8 tsp ground mustard.  Omitted the hot pepper sauce entirely.  The spices added enough kick.     Super yummy & perfect over salad greens!!  I will be making this all summer long!  Thanks, Kiki!

We would probably give this a 4 1/2.  According to what I had available, I used no jicama and used Taco Seasoning I (which I keep in my pantry ready for use).  For my partial batch of this recipe I cut the corn from a raw cob, and its sweetness was so delicious!  There is definitely too much of the mayo/sour cream mix for our taste, so next time I'll cut the mayo back to half and add a little more taco seasoning.  This is a great way to use up some of those fresh veggies that are so yummy in the summertime!  Thanks, Kiki!  We'll have this again!

Loved it! My kids ate it without knowing all that was in and didn't complain once and I have a couple picky eaters.....
They ate their veggies and Mom was happy  ;-)   P.S. I never use taco seasoning.... it has a lot of salt in it. I used chili powder instead and a little more of the pepper and cumin.
