Don't give a recipe a bad review when you jack it up with your own substitutions!!! I have made this several times as written and they turn out great with requests for the recipe ...

I made a few changes. Drained crushed pineapple ( I put in the big can of crushed pineapple ) & baked it in a 13 x 9. It came out really good...dense and moist. You might want to serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Yum. AND I doubled the batch. The picture looks good right? That is the 1st photo I have submitted.

I tripled this recipe for a dessert for a Jamaican party.  I used 2 -20 oz cans of drained crushed pineapple.  I baked it in a very large sheet cake pan. I saved some of the pineapple juice and mixed it with powdered sugar and piped it over the bars like a strudel effect. There were only crumbs left.  I agree that vanilla ice cream would be wonderful with the bars, and macadamia nuts might be good in them as well.

I rated this four stars only because I made a few changes: I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter; I used vanilla-NOT rum-and with the absence of coconut, used oats. The pineapple was in chunks, so I chopped them smaller to make 2 cups (Resembling more of pineapple bits). Since I made a 9x13‚Äù pan, it had to bake 30-50 minutes. It was very moist, very pine-apply (I used Dole), and very yummy! Everyone loved it!

I made this dish for a graduation party and it was a rave! People loved the light, refreshing taste on a warm summer day. I would certainly top it with vanilla bean ice cream next time I serve it in a smaller setting.

It was way too sweet for us. But I used coconut oil and it worked good, just need to reduce the sugar in the recipe next time.

I used fresh pineapple and it was a disaster. Too wet to get out of the pan. So heavy. One fork full was eaten.

This was good, but left out the coconut and put in walnuts, after I took it out of the oven I drizzled some icing on top that i made with powdered sugar, milk and vanilla it was almost like an upside down pineapple cake

I made this because I happened to have some crushed pineapple left over from another recipe.  I really liked this!  It is more of a cake than what I would consider a bar.  I added a little more coconut, a little more pineapple, and added 1 cup of flour rather than 3/4 c.  I would make this again if I happened to have the ingredients on hand.

Delicious! I didn't have shortening so used butter which seemed fine. As well, I cut the brown sugar in half for the batter and later sprinkled a handful of it on top before baking. Yum! I also used about a cup and a half of pineapple and a half a cup of the juice. Then used 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of flaked coconut to help thicken the batter because of the extra fluid. I substituted vanilla extract for the rum. Lol it sounds like I didn't follow the recipe at all but I think the essence of it was retained. Will definitely keep making.

Top the warm bar with vanilla ice cream and it makes it all the better.

I made these in mini cup cake pans.  I didn't have shortening so I used butter instead.  Also had 20 oz can of crushed pineapple & used the entire can (squeeze juice out really good).

I'm attending a tropical-themed party and decided to try this recipe as a take-along.  Very disappointed in the texture and the overall flavor.  Would not make again.

Doubled the recipe in a 10x14 pan. True it doesn't cut beautifully for presentation but tastes delicious.

Great basic recipe. I made substitutions based on what I had on hand and reading reviews. Here goes:  melted coconut oil instead of shortening; Truvia brown sugar; 15-oz can of crushed pineapple, drained; and half the amount of coconut plus half oats (because the coconut oil imparts a whole lot of coconut flavor). I will make this again!

I made this for a Luau party and it was a big hit.  I did not change anything.  I thought they didn't look very appealing because they were hard to cut cleanly because of the coconut and moistness.  They didn't look horrible but not as presentable as I like my dishes.  Looks aside, everyone said "those are really yummy" after the 1st bite and there were none left.

Just okay. Nothing special.  Won't do again.
