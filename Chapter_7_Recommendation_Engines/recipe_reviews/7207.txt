I LOVED it!  But, I love Molasses.  I used applesauce instead of oil, splenda instead of sugar, and whole wheat flour.
Excellent Recipe!!

This is great oatmeal bread.  I like it even better when using mostly honey instead of other sweeteners.

This bread was a deep disappointment. I love oatmeal bread and expected the wonderful taste of oatmeal to shine in this recipe. However, the major flavor is the molasses. I followed the recipe exactly and was a little worried about the amount of molasses, but I read all the shining reviews I thought I would take a chance. Sorry, but this bread should maybe be named "Molasses Oatmeal" bread. In other words, molasses bread made with oatmeal. Sorry!

Smells amazing while baking! I mix/bake bread at work all day so at home I cheat and use my Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook for bread. I mixed it for four minutes on medium low instead of hand kneading. Left the ingredients in tact, as I always do when making a recipe for the first time. I did, however, do a third rising as I usually do with most breads.

But my second batch! WOW! Wanted to experiment, so I added half a cup of raisins, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and a tablespoon of cinnamon. Best cinnamon raisin bread I have made. Sprinkled some oats and sugar on top as well for presentation (and the sugar makes a nice crispness on top.)

Thank you! Excellent bread recipe.

This is a very good recipe tho I do agree with other reviewers that it is TOO much molasses.  I cut the amount of molasses down to a little less than half, substituted honey for the remaining amount and then cut the sugar down to 1 tablespoon.  I also found that the bread/buns dry out very fast, so I doubled the oil.

Now this is good oatmeal bread! My last one was a disaster. TIP: Sprinkle oatmeal on top before baking, it looks really pretty and authentic! I followed the recipe exactly except for using reduced fat milk and quick cooking oats and that made no difference at all. The dough was very sticky so I think that it wouldn't hurt if you added extra oatmeal. I also want to try it with the addition of eggs as well as well as adding ginger and cinnamon. I even had the idea that it would be good if I used orange or apple juice in place of the water, with the sugar omiited. Granted, I haven't tried any of these variations yet but I can't wait to!:D

I was alitle short on molasses, so I used some honey as well. I'm glad I did. I'm afraid it would have been to strong of molasses flavor if I had used the full amount.  I also had to use about an extra cup of flour, and it was still very sticky. It did make a nice moist bread though!

Granny knows best, this bread is great. I thought my arms would die before it was kneaded though! I added 2 beaten eggs to the batter and reduced the milk to 1/2 cup to compensate. The molasses flavor is terrific and the texture of the bread is chewy and tender.

This was my favorite homemade bread I have ever made.  It has such a rich flavor- everyone loved it.  Be sure to have lots of flour handy for the kneading process as this is a sticky dough.  Also- watch the bread closely- mine was done cooking in 45 minutes.  Otherwise- I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  Thank you and I will post a picture soon!

This recipe is actually from the cookbook "Vegetarian Planet" by Didi Emmons. I know because I gave the recipe to Didi. It's my grandmother's recipe. As many other commenters note, this is a molasses-rich, sweet bread. It is wonderful toasted with butter or jam. If you don't like molasses, don't make this recipe.

The original recipe from my grandmother was slightly different from the recipe above. It used 3/4 cup molasses, 1/2 cup sugar, and shortening rather than oil. It makes a sweeter and richer bread. 

This is my absolute favorite bread to bake. When I make it these days I use the original amount of molasses and shortening instead of oil. Use a light molasses (like Grandmas) for a lighter bread. A medium molasses (e.g. Br'er Rabbit) makes a mellow, rich bread. A dark molasses (e.g. - organic blackstrap) makes a dark dangerous and yummy bread with a delicious tang. This is a very forgiving recipe - try adding a cup of cornmeal with the oatmeal and reducing the flour a bit, or making it with two cups of whole wheat instead of white flour. I think you'll love it no matter what you do!

Had to substitute honey for the molasses, due to availability; however, honey is listed as an acceptable substitute in equal amounts, and it worked well. With just two here and running low on flour, I opted to half the recipe, and got one huge loaf out of the halved recipe. This is a very nice sweet bread. Great for toasting and adding butter or butter and jam.

I had company and made this bread to have with dinner, it was a hit.  It was still warm from the oven and the butter just melted right into it.  It was just as good with out butter too.  We even have some for breakfast the next morning.  I used old fashion oats instead of rolled oats and this still turned out great.

This is my new favorite bread recipe. The flavor is great - and it has just the right amount of sweetness. I did not scald the milk because I didn't feel I needed to.  I used half white flour and half wheat flour.

I cut the recipe in half and it still made a wonderful size loaf and I also cut back the molasses to 1/3 and it was heaven . It also smells so good baking as well . I will definately make this again . I used what ever oats I had in the cabinet and it came out just as good . This will be a favorite at my house .

I could not find my tried and true recipe for oatmeal bread and so I took a chance on this new recipe. It was wonderful, I did add 1/4 cup of honey as I usually do with my other recipe, but did not change any other ingredients. My family liked it even better than my old recipe.

The best bread I have ever made.  Did not change the recipe at all.  I did however use King Arthur bread flour and I really think that made it so much better.

The first time I made this bread it was very good but I thought it was a little dry. Second time , I made sure the dough was just a little sticky and I got more rise to the loaf. Everyone who tried this bread commented on how good it was. It makes real good toast also. I even used two cups of wheat flour in this recipe and it was very good. It just plain turns out to be a very enjoyable bread for any occasion.

I substituted maple syrup for the molasses, and brown sugar for white sugar because I don't care for molasses. My kids and I loved it. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and sprinkled oatmeal and white sugar on top.

Thought this was a good loaf of bread. Made beef stew with it for dinner one night and it sure was good dipped in the broth. Did use whole wheat flour in the recipe In stead of all purpose. Would like to find another bread that has a stronger oatmeal taste to it.

We loved this bread. More moist than some oatmeal recipes and we didn't think the molasses was too much at all. One issue: the recipe says to bake for 1 hour!?  The usual 25 minutes was good in my oven, glad I didn't follow the directions.
