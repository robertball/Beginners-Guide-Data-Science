So so so bad, yet so so so good. Love em. Just mix up some pancake batter with water until the consistency is enough to coat the cookie, you don't need egg or milk.

I surprised everyone by making this recipe and they loved them. I also sprinkled a little powder sugar for the presentation.

I fixed these last night and they were pretty good. They had a funnel cake taste to them. One thing is they have to be eaten right away when they are still warm.  They were not very good once they cooled. I would still fix them again.

They do taste good right after coming out of the oil.  However, are terribly greasy and unappetizing if they sit for too long and definitely not good at all for the next day.

Oh my, how delicious! I left out the egg and milk, and just used the pancake mix. Not the prettiest end result, but that doesn't matter because they disappear FAST. Thanks for this sinful, fabulous treat!

Awesome recipe for a sweet tooth!  Make the batter thick enough that when you allow it to drip off the spoon, a good amount will stick.  Place in the frig for a couple of hours.  As well, put the cookies in the freezer for the same amount of time.  When the cookies are done and you take them out of the hot oil, place them on a cooling rack to allow for the extra grease to drain off.  When cool, sprinkle with powdered sugar or drizzle with chocolate or syrup.  .........AND I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH MANY OTHER REVIEWS, ours kept very well and were just as good the second day!

SOOOO yummy, sounded gross and I never wanted to try them at the boardwalk but they were delicious!!! I used complete pancake mix instead of adding all the other stuff and just made a thick batter no measuring.

Simply delicious! I changed a bit this recipe. Instead of mixing egg,milk, etc..I  bought the Add water only Pancake Mix and that was it! You gotta try it!! Leave the mix a bit on the thicker side to get that right fluffyness. 
I have been doing them for my church fundraiser and its been a hit! Don't forget your glass of milk ; )

I used butter instead of oil for the pancake batter mixture. Its better to fry these longer on a low temp than short on a super high temp. And they taste good right after made but not after several hours.

I was surprised how fast these cooked. It really only took me like 30 seconds on each side, but they were still soft and warm inside.   Delicious!

We had a deep fried party horribly bad for you, but great fun.  I made the deep fried oreos and they were just as good as if I was at the fair.  The only thing I suggest is get the batter good and cold in the freezer so the oreos still better otherwise it's a little messy!

this batter sucks! this is pooh writing and goo and i tried this batter and it completely failed, epically. the batter was way too thin and one sideof the oreos was never covered enough after frying, even though we follwed he recipe correctly. we then tried a different recipe from emeril on the food network involving flour, and they rock our world!

I reccomend this to anyone. It's soo good! I just used pancake batter though. Also, I didn't want to pull out my deep fryer, (It's new and it takes a LOT of of oil to fry something) so instead, I heated oil on high heat in a pan on the stove and fried it that way. Delicious!!!!

I probably shouldn't rate this as I only used pancake mix, oreos and oil.  I simply made a think pancake mix, coated the oreos and fried them (in a pan with oil.  It only takes a minute or so for each side.  I had these at Mermaid Casino in Las Vegas and were hooked.  So bad, yet so good.

Love this idea. I took the advice of other readers and just used pancake batter and milk and made the batter a bit thicker. I added a little more than 1/2 c. milk and 1/2 Tbs. Vanilla extract, then refrigerated for two hours. It fried beautifully and tasted fabulous, especially when it was slow cooked for longer on a lower temp. All I had on hand was chocolate chip pancake batter and my brother and I loved the extra chocolatey taste. Perfect when served warm with ice cream

Yum! If you like fried food and Oreos, then you will find this a treat. I can't say that I used exact measurements because I didn't have measuring cups handy so I just made it until I thought it was the right consistency. But if you read the recipe, some thought it was too runny, but mine turned out puffy and delicious. Add more pancake mix to thicken it out and you should be fine.

I love deep fried oreos, but this recipe wasn't that good. When I fried them, the batter ran off and didn't stay. I doubled the pancake mix but left the egg and milk and oil the same. Turned out okay.

This is a heart attack on a plate, folks....but you might as well die happy.  I NEVER thought I would EVER make anything like this, figuring it was just junk.  But the deep fryer was out, the oil was clean, and I had all the ingredients.  So....anyhow.  I tasted the first one, then ate it.  Then ate another one.  Gosh.  It was good.  Now, the funny thing is I cook for a living and one of my snootiest clients tried one and is bound and determined that we will serve these, with homemade ice cream, as dessert at her next dinner party.  I love it!  The best things are the simplest, oldest and most Southern-inspired.  I bet this came out of GA or AL or one of those wonderful-food places, where everything is truly yummy, full of flavor and not covered with some kind of reduction or deconstruction.  Paula Dean rocks!!!  Fry that Oreo!  Next, I'm going to do Golden Oreos, fried, with chocolate ice cream.

these were awesome...wayy better than u even get at fairs or anything 2 people who said they had them at fairs and did not like them actually tried them and changed their tune...u do need to add a little more pancake mix to the mix to thicken it up otherwise u won't have much of a "breading" around the oreos...also put powdered sugar on them and they are great!

Just amazing! I had never had these before (yes, I know now what I've been missing), but I had heard how good they were. Made them for my family and every single one was devoured in minutes! It's unbelievable how simple this recipe is and how incredibly delicious they taste! I may never have the need to get a carnival fried oreo...these were just too good!!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe and was pleased.   The end result didn't look like the picture for my batter was not nearly as thick.  I will thicken the batter next time and see what the results are.   Serve with ice cream and it's even better!

VERY yummy! ALthough I would recommend using more pancake mix to make the batter more thick so it is easier to coat the oreos. Also we tried mint oreos which was VERY good! enjoy :)

Oh wow were these good!  Extremely bad for you but were fun to make.  I had to limit myself to one which was super hard to do!  I had to just walk away and let everyone else finish them:)

If you make the batter thicker it is so much better.  We added an extra cup of the pancake mix, and they were perfect.  Enjoy!

These are so easy to make and people love them. Make the pancake batter in advance, a little on the thick side, and refrigerate it. Decorate the plate with chocolate syrup and serve 2 fried oreos with confectioner's sugar sprinkled on them next to a dip of vanilla ice cream.

I have never eaten a deep fried Oreo® before so I really had no idea what to expect.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to omit the egg, milk and 2 teaspoons of oil and instead used 2 cups of complete pancake mix, 1 cup of water, 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar. Stirred this together and placed in the refrigerator overnight. I thought I had a package of chocolate Oreos® but discovered they were lemon. I placed the package in the freezer. Next morning, I poured 1 quart of canola oil into my deep fryer and heated to 350 degrees. I dipped five frozen Oreos® at a time into the chilled batter and fried for 2-3 minutes until they were a beautiful golden color.  I allowed them to drain inside the fryer basket and then placed on paper towels to finish draining. As a final touch, I dusted with powdered sugar.  I did not experience the problem of greasiness as others mentioned. Also, the thick batter adhered to the frozen cookies without any problems. These were very rich, very addictive and a very "special" treat which I plan on making again using different flavors of Oreos®. Thank you for sharing your recipe, Olivia C!

Delicious! use the egg in the pancake batter as the recipe states, it makes for thicker batter. Also folks, this is meant to be eaten right away; Ever had funnel cake? NOT GOOD THE NEXT DAY! & Not the fault of the recipe!!! You fry it, you eat it. That's the way it was meant to be. You do not save it for later!!!

This was quick, and easy. The batter was a little runny I thought. I added about 3/4 cup more of batter and an extra egg to get the batter much thicker. I also used a frying pan ad less oil. This was great. We sprinkled confectioner's sugar on them. They came out similar to New Orleans beignets! This was fantastic. Very rich.

Cooked these up using just add water pancake mix according to the box. Used 375 degree heat, discovered it is best not to use the fry basket, just drop them in the vat and they cook very fast take out when golden.

I made these this morning for my husband to take to work. They were really good. I did a couple of things different. I bought funnel cake mix and used it for the batter. I also freezed the oreos for 2 hrs before I fried them.

Just tried it.  Really yummy, but I had to add more pancake mix to make a thicker batter.  Also, lower temp and longer fry.

As is the recipe is 3 stars because the cookie will fall apart if you deep fry it right away. Also the mixture is too thin and the temperature is too high. To make this recipe 5 stars, freeze the cookies for at least 2 hours beforehand, add about 1/2 cup extra pancake mix, and cook at around 350 degrees for about 3-4 min (to get that gooey center)

Amazing, of course.  We just substituted the batter mix in this recipe with a pancake batter recipe on the side of a Bisquik box. We sprinkled them with confectioners' sugar at the end.  Can't beat these.

These are awesome! My husband had them and told me how great they were, so I had to take a shot and make them at home. They turned out great! I used a different batter (recipe: chocolate chip pancakes) w/out the chocolate chips, of course. I will be making these often.

These treats are the best! I serve them whenever I have family or friends over and I always get great feedback on them! They're great for kids and adults. However, as stated before, once cold, they're not very good. So enjoy them while they are hot!

I've heard many good things about fried Oreos, that they're a big thing at carnivals in the US. Not something they serve at the ones we have here! I was disappointed with the result. Having never tried these, I wasn't sure what to expect. The batter was definitely too thin, as it barely stuck the cookie. Also, I don't think mine were cooked long enough. Maybe if the batter was thicker the two minutes in the oil would be good, but being it was thin these were in the oil for just barely thirty seconds. They taste like a warm version of Oreos dipped in milk without the milk (if that makes sense) with a hint of pancake because of the little bit of batter that stuck to it. Giving this three stars for ease but I really feel these were a waste of oil and time in general... Just dip your cookies in warm milk, less fat and mess!

These were very tasty, but the batter is very thin as written. I had to add extra pancake mix to thicken it. My son loved them.

Made this recipe in an air fryer at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes, the double batter batch turned out great! Basically dipped once, fried, and dipped again for a second fry. Delicious! And not greasy!

I didn't have a deep frier or milk or eggs... so instead I did half an inch of oil in the bottom of a pan over low heat, and I used half cup Krusteez pancake mix with 1/3 cup water. They turned out perfect.

These are a fun - albeit indulgent treat. The Oreo completely changes texture, but is still very delicious.

It was so simple. Instead, we used pancake batter (with water) and skipped milk eggs and whatnot. The first batch stuck to the bottom of the deep fryer basket. After that we just put the basket down and kinda plopped them in, they didn't stick, they floated, and when time to take them out we either used a fork or just lifted the basket out. Sooo good. We used golden oreo's, also. Definitely something to try.

Delicious!! I followed the directions on the pancake mix box and made the batter extra thick and left it in the fridge for a couple of hours. I used two forks to whip it around in the batter and get it covered nicely. Will never pay for these at a carnival again!!

A favorite at our hometown's annual Trail Days Festival each May. Was my breakfast the day of my wedding, actually....I omitted the egg, milk and vegetable oil and opted for Hungry Jack pancake mix with water. Always....always top with powder sugar. Great in the winter when Oreo has their Pepermint Oreos! Can use the same method to deep fry Twinkies, too- but don't forget a stick when doing those!

As other had said just use pancake batter alone and make it thick. Tip: Fry them at a lower tempature also double stuff works best. YUMMY YUMMY

There is no reason to have oil in the batter and it needs be a lot thicker than the recipie calls for, but other than that, so amazingly simple and good.  We also just fried the batter and that was good.  The only thing I would add to the batter (besides making it thicker) is vanilla extract to make it sweeter.

Good start, but the batter needs to be thicker so I had to add  more mix...also the don’t forget the powdered sugar. I looked at the recipe really quick while I was at the store and bought what was on there and totally forgot about the powdered sugar.

My family likes this recipe, minus the cayenne and hot sauce, but I also add dill and onion powder to the dry batter and use finely ground corn meal and a bit of baking powder. You can also make it a wet batter and add Sprite, to puff them up a little. I then make homemade Ranch and add some cayenne and hot sauce to some of that, for those who like a little heat.

1 Cup of pancake mix wasn't enough. It was still kind of watery. Added maybe a half of cup more to thicken it and it came out perfectly.

This was great!! It was easy enough for my 12 year old daughter to make and now she does this all the time.. we buy different flavors of Oreos and they are amazing .. My hubby and daughter brought these from a mini dessert bar and now they make their own. I never tried a fried Oreo until now and the vanillas ones are my favorite .. hubby red velvet and my daughter (chocolate). O

Tastes just like the carnival, but batter way to thin.  Ended up doing 1 1/2 cups pancake mix.

Came out really bad.  Should use less milk.  The 1 cup of pancake mix was not enough in 1 cup of milk.  Too runny.  And when I put them in the 375 degree heat it was way too hot.  Only kept in for a few seconds and it burnt.  Lower temp and use less mix.  They didn't taste like Carnival Deep Fried Oreos anyway.

I took the easy way out and used the pancake mix where all you all is water, they came out great.  I also tried making some deep fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, I froze the candy like you're supposed to, but OMG!!!!  DID I EVER HAVE A MESS ON MY HANDS WITH THAT ONE!!!

Oh my gosh!!! My kids wait for the day to make these.  I myself can only eat obe bite, too much for me.  They turn out great and are a big hit.  
We do “fry” night and do cookies first and then french fries and then fish or chicken.  Pretty great...

Skip the egg and use soy/almond milk instead of milk. It makes it vegan because Oreos are vegan.

Added a little vanilla extract to the batter, and a little extra pancake mix as I found it too thin. Also used mega stuffed Oreos. Came out great!

It was super yummy! This was definitely a family favorite. The batter was pretty thin and didnt cover the oreo as much as I would have liked it to. But it was so good that that doesnt even matter. Ill definitely be making this many more times!

Not impressed.  It was ok, but not worth the hassle of frying oil.  And they were only tasty within the first few minutes.

Perfect easy recipe!! Who knew it was so easy to make this awesome treat!!! I changed nothing. Didn’t use a deep fryer. Used a very small heavy duty saucepan with about an inch of hot oil at the recommended temperature. Worked great.

These were really simple to make and everybody liked them. Sprinkled with powdered sugar while still warm. I thought the batter was on the thin side and so I added more pancake mix half way through but turns out they were just as good with the batter I thought was too thin. They get dark pretty quickly, so don't take your eyes off of them!

Essentially a doughnut (ok, fritter) stuffed with a cookie. Too much. Either a cookie OR a fritter by itself would be better. Waste of time, money, and ingredients.

Follow the recipe EXACTLY step by step and it came out AMAZING. So easy to make and they tasted just like the ones we buy at carnivals. I'm in big trouble because now my kids are gonna ask for some everyday.  Would not change a thing about is recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  My husband and I thought they were okay, but not worth making again.  However, our 8 and 9 year old grandsons thought they were "AWESOME - just like at the State Fair!!!"

I found the batter to be really runny, so I added about 1/2 Cup more of pancake mix. The Oreos looked just like the picture after my change.

I used Aunt Jemima pancake mix with water to make a slightly thick batter. Then I fried it in semi-hot grease and omg! I used oreo thins b/c I'm not a big fan of the creme. But this was an amazing and simple recipe that will be loved forever!

These are pretty awesome I tried vegatable oil first time round used canola oil the second time and seemed to work better. I also suggest playing around and getting the seasonal Oreos as well I tried the smores Oreos and there were mouth watering plan on trying the cinnamon bun Oreos next

It was very good!! However you must be be sure that the batter is thicker than the recipe calls for or your Oreo won't be covered completely and the batter around it won't be thick enough for taste.

Everyone who tried it loved it! I tried using both a batter with the called-for eggs, milk, etc, and premixed batter that only required water. My family preferred the complete batter that only required water (possibly because I used the eggs and milk with the already premixed batter). I love icing so I'll probably go for the double -stuffed or mega stuffed oreos next time.

I loved this recipe so much. They tasted just like the ones I had at the state fair. If you want to make deep fried Oreos this recipe is the way to go.

These were a last minute decision and they were amazing!!  I used bisquick mix and made the ultimate pancake recipe.  Holy delish.  My daughters friends (9), sons friends (6), and my 4 year old also approved.  My husby came back for seconds and thirds!!!  lol  Not the healthiest but great for a special treat and this is definitely a crowd pleaser.

I added more pancake mix to thicken the batter. Other than that everything was the same. My family enjoyed these. Add powdered sugar to the top to give them that State Fair like taste! Nutter butters also work for this.

If you use complete pancake mix (with eggs and milk already in it) just use one cup mix and one cup water.  I put in a teaspoon of sugar also.  they came out amazing.  the don't even need powdered sugar.

I would rather make my own batter...won't be using this recipe again! Also, don't use vegetable oil...makes the fried oreos taste terrible! I used canola oil the second time and didn't get that nasty flavor.

I absolutely love this recipe, I tried it tonight with a few changes. I only had golden oreos on hand but still delicious. I used a buttermilk pancake mix with milk and a little bit of vanilla. I like my batter thick with buttercream glaze and powdered sugar for presentation. These will definitely be made many times in our house.

Double D. Decadent, and delicious!  So sweet you can't eat them often. Must be eaten hot or the deliciousness is minimized...

There were awesome and just like the ones at the fair! Just follow the instructions for the batter on whatever pancake mix you purchase. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Super amazing! I love it. We made the pancake batter like the box said. Don't have the oil too hot, or they heat up too fast. The powdered sugar adds a lot. Super easy and really fun to make! The batter is messy, so be wary. It didn't bother me much, though.

Recipe was really good.  I used the box mix where you only add water.  It was really warm and gooey delicious on the inside.

I'm not really a fan of Oreos, but man these are good! We just got a deep fryer so we wanted to try something different. Mine definitely didn't look as "pretty" as the main photo, but the taste made up for it.  Best served warm!

I feel in love with this tantalizing desert while on vacation in Gatlinburg. $8 got you just 3 cookies and I was determined to make these on my own. I first started out with funnelcake batter but it is only available during the summer months here. So I came across this recipe. I've since altered it using only water, pancake mix and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. The outcome is a crispy outside and chewy inside. Eat them right away otherwise it looses the warm goodness!!!

Pretty good but it didn't quite pop like the fried Oreos I had in Vegas at Nathan's on Fremont Street. I added a half cup of sugar to the batter and bam! That is what it was missing. Really brings out the flavor of the oreo.

So I love the recipe - I would just add about a half cup of sugar to the batter.

I made these for my family and a few friends, all of which who where very skeptical of it. I told my mom that I was going to make them.. I asked her if she wanted one and she said, umm no I will just try yours I guess. So I made one, put a little vanilla ice cream on top and let her try it, after she tried it she said, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THIS BACK! AND I WANT 2 MORE! LOL yea they are good!

I have not done this exact recipe. The only difference between this one and mine is that I use 3 teaspoons of oil, and a teaspoon or two of vanilla. I believe that the batter best forms on the cookie when you let it sit in the fridge for a day or two. I mastered the recipe at a pizza shop i had worked at, and we sold them by the dozenes.

This was my first time making deep fried Oreos, and I liked them. It was a very fun and different treat. I'd experiment with other recipes next time though. This recipe is basically an Oreo in a pancake, which is not necessarily bad, but it's not what I was envisioning.

I don't even care for oreos! We have an annual family carnival and my sister-in-law insisted on fried oreos much to my objections (as I'm the cook and didn't want to deal with them). I used Sam's Club pancake mix (only add water), made it a little thicker and these were sooooo good. I loved them!!! Everybody loved them. This is a keeper for the next family event!
