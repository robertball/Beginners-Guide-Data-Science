This recipe tastes delicious, but allow me to clarify something.  It is a latte, if that.  Generally, one would call this Mint Hot Chocolate - it does not actually fall into an espresso drink category.

After my nice relaxing "girls" weekend away in the Wisconsin Dells (the Kalahari Resort rocks), I was looking for something to continue my spoiledness, and unfortunatlly this didn't do it.  This, in my opinion is minty hot chocolate, it wasn't horrible, but it didn't float my boat.

I personally think it's "ok" but my husband really likes it a lot.  He doesn't microwave it like the recipe suggests.  He pours hot coffee over the broken up patty and keeps stirring until it's dissolved then he adds cream instead of milk.  He doesn't call it a cappuccino but a mint coffee.

'Cappuccino'??! Clean your teeth, then have a cup of coffee; that's pretty much what this tastes like.
