I have been making this receipe for 5 years...when I was first introduced to bear meat! It is fantastic!!  I have also altered the water ingrediant and used a can of cream of mushroom so that there is some "gravy" to pour all over.  On occassion, I have seen some people wrinkle their nose at the thought of eating bear meat but when I serve this, they change their minds! Many times, they can't even tell the difference!  A stomach doesn't care as long as it's good and this is one of the best.  Add/subtract you favorite veggies and enjoy!!

Good recipe.  Although I didn't have access to bear meat, I used stew meat.  I also placed everything in a crock-pot and needless to say it was great!! This stew also freezes well!! I will make this again!!

This was great!  I only used 2 quarts of water.  I also added 3 stalks celery, sliced, and a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Daughter followed essence of the recipe... substituted corn for turnips as she didn't have any turnips. Came out extremely tender. Flavors are subtle. Will use for the rest of the bear meat in the freezer and will try with turnips. Also might add tomatoes to next batch. This recipe goes straight to my recipe box!!

we liked this stew, I fried the meat in a pot, so when I added water, it would get all the brown bits stuck in the pan. Since we were given this meat, not harvested by us, I was unsure how old it was and how it was prepared, so I added 1 T of vinegar to the water. This tenderizes the meat while cooking and does not leave a vinegary taste. Also added the salt at the end.

My son caught his first bear with a bow and arrow.Your recipe is great thank you very much.Last year a friend gave us some bearmeat. I soaked it in the fridge overnight in a large bowl of milk.Takes the wild ness out of it for people who don't like the wildness. Works with deer too.

I added Guinness beer to the slow cooker. My husband loved it- I think I'm just not into bear meat, though I want to because we have over ten pounds in the freezer!

I'm sorry but I din't care for this!  It was sooooo bland even after adding other spices. I added hot sauce to my bowl but my honey didn't and thought it was okay. I may make another attempt and add the cream of mushroom soup like some others did but I doubt it.

Sorry guys, I don't eat bear meat, but did replace it with stew meat.  This turned out wonderful even without bear meat.  Thanks for sharing. Yummy Yummy Yummy.

I didn't have any bear, but beef stew meat.  I needed a recipe for turnips and this is very good.  I also added some whole allspice and parsnip, as well as whole pepper kernels instead of ground.  I'd only suggest to add the turnips and mushrooms about 1/2hr before the end as they got rather soft.  Otherwise it's very tasty, even my 15mo old enjoyed it!

I made this stew for supper tonight in my pressure cooker. This is seriously fantastic stew!!  I made it as written, except I added the can of mushroom soup as someone recommended, added some frozen peas and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and thickened it at the end with a little flour.   It was my first time eating bear and I was expecting it to be tough and maybe strong tasting.  It was tender and completely delicious.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it often.  My husband gives it 5 stars too. Thanks for the recipe!

I tried the recipe and used a few ideas from the previous comments including adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and some cut up celery. I added 8 ounces of water after cooking about 1-1/2 hrs. We had some fellow hunters and huntresses over for bear stew and the folks loved it. Several said it tasted lime the best beef stew they ever had. I killed my first bear last year and mostly cooked it in a crock pot with great success. Bear stew is now my favorite.

I made this stew for 2 servings, and it still made a lot. I never had bear meat before, so I didn't know what to do with it. The overtone of the flavors reminded me of a beef stew (which I don't like). This stew was good, however. It got me to want to try a different recipe with bear meat.

Nothing wrong with the recipe at all.  The bear on the other hand ... definitely not my thing for sure
