These muffins are absolutely fabulas! I did, however, make a few changes.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so for the flour mixture I used 1 cup all-purpose and 3/4 cup wheat, which turned out really well.  I also used 1.5 cups raspberries that were frozen and I thawed in warm water.  After I patted the berries dry, I tossed them in about 1 tablespoon powdered sugar before folding them into the mixture.  Finally, in my second go-round of making these delicious muffins, I added 1 teaspoon vanilla to make them just a tad sweeter. Superb!  Will definitely make again and again.

The muffins were very good, i do agree that they stuck to the sides of the paper cups too much.  I replaced the sugar with splenda and one large egg with egg alternative and they still turned out fine!

Really really good muffins, and also one of the most healthy recipes I have tried.  However because there is absolutely no butter in this recipe, the muffins really stick even to the paper baking cups.  Next time I might just grease the muffin cups.  I also added a little bit of vanilla as my only change to the recipe.

oh my gosh!  this may be one of my new favorite muffin recipes, and i am a huge fan of muffins!  These really are melt-in-your-mouth muffins, and the lemony topping is the perfect finishing touch!  I will make these over and over and over.....well, you get the point.  Your taste buds will definitely thank you for this one.

The first time I made these I wasn't impressed - they stuck to the papers and I thought they tasted rather bland.  My husband convinced me to make them again and what do you know, they tasted better!  Instead of papers I just sprayed the muffin tins w/ Pam and the muffins came out of the pans great.

The only problem I had with these muffins was that they collapsed after I took them out of the oven - which made them rather flat and very dense. But they were still delicous! Everyone who tried them raved about them, and they were gone in no time! I omitted the pecan/sugar/wheat germ topping, but I did use the glaze. Yummy.

I made these muffins this morning for breakfast and they were excellent. I used the vanilla suggested by a few of the reviews here and think it worked very well. The only draw back to this recipe is I use a jumbo muffin pan to make my muffins and so I did not get 12 out of it. I think when I make them again(and I definately will) I will double the recipe and fill the muffin cups fuller.
