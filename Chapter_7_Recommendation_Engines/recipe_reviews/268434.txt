Maybe if you're a mac 'n cheese master this will turn out well. But, for me, it wasn't anything to write home about. The roux takes way longer than indicated to thicken, the bread crumbs take a little longer to brown (I had to turn on the broiler), and the pumpkin just doesn't come through. I added paprika, cayenne, and onion powder and would up the levels even more as an experiment for my next mac and cheese exploit.
