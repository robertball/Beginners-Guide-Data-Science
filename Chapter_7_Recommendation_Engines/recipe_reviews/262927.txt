For our taste, there was a tablespoon too much of horseradish, so I added a tablespoon or so of extra mayo to tone it down.  Then I added about a teaspoon of sugar.  Didn't have fresh dill, so used about an 1/8 teaspoon of dill seed.  Yummy!  Will definitely make it again.

These were just OK for me. I felt like it needed something else; I only had dried dill, so maybe fresh would have given them more oomph. I felt like there was too much salt and pepper--you may want to just shake in some of each instead of measuring. Thanks anyway.

Made as written and I loved the simplicity of these. Horseradish and dill are always a plus for deviled eggs in my book. Great recipe!
