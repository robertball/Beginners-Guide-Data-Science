Definatley an amazing recipe, as for changes I added a bit more white wine total of 1 1/2 cup. Other than that it's one of the best octopus dishes I've done.

Simple and delicious recipe! I condensed the time frame to 3 hrs instead of waiting until the next day. It was so tender and flavorful. Thank you for sharing this!

Pretty good.  I'll add more salt and get a larger octopus next time. 2.2 lb was too small.
