Good general recipe, however, I did not feel that chicken stock was appropriate for french onion soup. I used beef stock instead and also added a bit of sugar to the onions to help carmalize. Soup turned out very tasty and the family loved it. Thanks!

This was amazing. I subbed beef stock for the chicken. Also used some sliced swiss in addition to the cheese called for. I didn't have any port so I subbed more of the white wine. I am a vegetarian, but I made an exception for this soup since my grandpa requested it. I'll try it again with veggie stock soon. Superior to restaurant quality.

Absolutely delicious...worth the time.  (It took me at least twice as long to cook the onions.)  I loved the addition of bay and fresh thyme, which I had not put into french onion soup before.  It's worth splurging on a very good cheese for this recipe.

On to the inevitable substitutions.  I did not have the port so I increased the amount on white wine.  I wasn't confident my bowls could be put under the broiler, so I baked mine at 375 degrees for 15 minutes with fabulous results.

Thanks, Phil!

Excellent! I was a little worried about using chicken broth instead of beef, but was really happy with the way this turned out. I used a combination of mozzerella and parmesan as I didn't have Gruyere. I also added a little fresh parsley. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  If you are looking for a rich, beefy, salty french onion, STOP, this is not your soup.  This is light, fresh and very delicious.  Followed the directins to a "T".  I used prepared croutons on top, love getting that easy bite of bread with every bite.  Thanks for an easy and delicious potage d' oignon!

This recipe was wonderful! I followed the directions and cook times exactly, the only substitution was that I used 1 quart vegetable stock and 1 quart chicken stock, which complimented the flavor I thought. I have never made any kind of soup before, but since my bf and I both love French Onion soup, and this seemed so easy I decided to give it a shot. So glad I did, it was the highlight of the meal.

Delicious soup!  I've made it twice now.  One time as called for with chicken stock and the other with beef stock.  We preferred it with beef stock but it's good both ways.  Also, the second time we made it we added a little more port and it was sensational.  Thanks for the recipe.  Easy and tasty!

A really good recipe and easy to make your own!  I use a little less than 2 quarts stock to keep the flavor really rich.
