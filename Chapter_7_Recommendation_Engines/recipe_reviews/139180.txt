Very nice sandwich.  I made one sandwich just for myself for lunch, and it was the perfect amount for me.  I'm not a huge fan of ham (don't like it very much at all actually), but I really like the spiciness of the chutney with the ham and cheese. Very quick and easy, so that's good too.  I know bf wouldn't like the combo, but for me it's a nice lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Now this is a twist I love.   Of course I like anything with chutney.   Highly recommended.

This was a fun twist-- I dipped it in a spicy ranch dressing, which added some extra kick.  Next time I might substitute it with a spicy chutney or add crushed red peppers.

Yum!  I used Swiss cheese instead of cheddar and raspberry jam instead of chutney.  I cooked it in a skillet and finished it off in the oven for a few minutes to ensure that the ham was hot enough.  I will make this again!!

Fantastic flavor. A little messy though as the chutney dripped out while eating. I used sharp cheddar and white sandwich bread. Although I liked the flavor very much I doubt I would make this again. It was a sticky mess eating and the ham kept sliding. Too much slipping in the middle. Thanks for something different for lunch. I enjoyed this.

Yummy!  I scaled this down to 1 serving but only had 2 slices of thin sliced ham...so I added a slice of prosciutto as well.  I love jams or chutney's on savory sandwiches!  This was delicious :)
