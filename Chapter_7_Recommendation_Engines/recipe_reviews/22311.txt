excellent! I cut the recipe in half & used 2 cranberry sauce cans since there are only 2 of us..... covered each can with foil & secured with an elastic & steamed for 55 mins..... perfect! Don't forget to grease the cans. thanks,  Michele

This is very much like my grandmothers recipe- and we do it the same way, in cans, set in a large stock pot.
The BEST thing to eat with baked beans!

Excellent recipe, moist and delicious! I added a cup of raisins to mine. Fantastic with hot dogs and baked beans as a Saturday night meal!

This turned out great.  I was shocked when my 13 yr old asked where the leftovers were the next day.  I did half the recipe and used 2 chicken broth cans.  I also used a veggie steamer until set (about 50 minutes).  AWESOME with Baked Beans.  I will definitely make this again.

I finally figured out how I could make this without the cans. I used a large round Pyrex bowl. I wasn't sure it was done because the middle looked wet and shiny but it wasn't sticky so I removed it from the steamer. This is rich, moist, dense and sweet. The corn meal gives a nice texture. I did not think it would come out of my bowl even though I greased it, but I tried turning over on a tray and it came out nicely. This is a little sweeter than I was hoping but absolutely delish.

I made this bread today and it was great! I searched for this recipe because my father-in-law been talking about it and how he would like to have it again. Growing up we could purchase it at any store, not today.  Thanks

I didn't have any whole wheat flour so I used 1 and a half cups all purpose and 1/2 cup rolled oats.  I boiled the oats and corn meal before adding other ingredients to soften them up a bit.  Makes a very delicious open faced peanut butter sandwich.  Also I used a double boiler not the cans--still very good though.

The flavor was good, but it took much longer for the bread to cook than expected (30+ minutes longer). However the flavor was very good.

All-metal coffee cans are getting hard to find, so you might substitute two 28-oz. BPA-free tomato cans (such as those used for whole peeled, crushed or diced tomatoes, or pur√©e) or two larger 46-oz., 7" tall, BPA-free pineapple juice cans (such as Dole) or tomato juice cans (such as Sacramento). The cans should be empty and clean, with one end removed. When using the taller 46-oz. cans, you'll need a tall pot in which to steam them, such as a 10-quart or larger pot, with a lid, plus something low on which to set the cans in the pot, such as a very low steamer rack or a cooling rack that can fit inside the pot. Or set each can on a canning ring (a.k.a. lid band). Before starting, make sure the can and its support fit inside the pot with its lid on! Canning jar tongs are also handy for removing the hot cans from the pot, and a wide-mouth canning funnel for filling the cans.

I made this and it came out perfect!  I always thought that it was too complicated to make from scratch, but it is so simple.  The hardest thing for me was finding a can to cook it in.  I ended up using a can from pineapple juice.  It worked great!

What a great recipe! So easy and it tastes just like I remember. I added raisins and divided the batter into 4 small cans and steamed in a tamale pot for 55 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this!

cut the ingredients in half since there are only two of us. Used two chicken broth cans.  Turned out perfect..much better than the canned bread we used to buy in the grocery store.  This recipe is a keeper.

Moist & Delicious! Just like the canned brown bread I loved as a kid! I added 1/4 cup of raisins and used a small,  antique bundt pan with a  lid that latches on tightly. I steamed it for 90 minutes  Next time  I'd steam 85 minutes. (The bundt  pan cooks faster due to the hole in the middle)
