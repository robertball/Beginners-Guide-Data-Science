Everyone loved this.  I combined the honey and orange juice and poured it over the ham and then let it cook.  I didn't have any whole cloves, so I just ommitted them completely.

i think it would be better if you reduced the honey and orange juice in a sauce pan before coating the ham it would give a better consistency and you would not need to baste the ham and score the rind of the ham allowing the honey and orange juice to got into the flesh of the ham

This was pretty good but found it could have used more honey and more zip.  Next time I will use this recipe but add Worchestershire sauce.

I make this ham every year. Instead of honey I use 1 cup of maple syrup which gives a thicker glaze. Instead of frozen orange juice I use ready to drink orange juice. It is a hit in our family!

I've made this 3 or 4 times, and am surprised to find that I forgot to review it until now. It's not a fabulous recipe, but still pretty tasty. I started with a "Cure 81" boneless half ham. And I've never seen a 6 oz. can of frozen orange juice concentrate, so I just measured half of a 12 oz. can. After basting every 10 minutes for the full hour, the "glaze" is still mostly in the roasting pan and not on the ham, although it does thicken up later and is better on the leftovers. The ease of making this recipe, and the fact that so few ingredients add such great flavors, are the major pluses of this recipe.

I liked the ham, but not so much the orange juice and honey.  I'd do away with the whole cloves too.  If I make this again, I'll make my own minor adjustments.  I think this recipe can be a good recipe if it is made to your taste.

We really liked this and the ham was very moist. I cooked a bone in butt portion ham since they were so cheap and I think they have better flavor anyway.   After reading reviews, I reduced the sauce before pouring it on the ham, which I cooked in an oven bag.  I did add some brown sugar, dry mustard and worcheshire sauce after tasting the sauce-it just needed a little somethin' somethin'. I do think this could be improved with some orange zest maybe, some marmalade or?  The orange flavor was not really prevelant, just sweetness.  A very nice Easter ham overall.

Got rave reviews of this at Christmas! I had to up the recipe to feed 6. I used orange blossom honey to add even more orange flavor.

Didn't really follow recipe....but my ham was delish!  I also used a bone-in butt ham and I always use a roasting bag...makes the ham soooo moist....but you can't baste.  I also added brown sugar and fresh grated ginger to the orange juice and honey...needed something.  I agree the glaze was too thin but that in part was most likely the roasting bag.  Took the juice out and thickened with cornstarch and served on the side.

01-17-16 ~ Loved it.  This simple three ingredient glaze offers a lot of flavor to a ham.  I basted every 15 minutes for one hour and it stuck nicely to ham.  I saved the leftover glaze to put on the ham when we reheat leftovers.  Definitely would make this again.
