This is an awsome recipe, every place I take it, I am asked for the recipe, and it freezes well, so I can have it when I want it!

This is similar to my recipe for basil butter except that I add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or a little lemon zest and use either white pepper or sometimes red pepper flakes.  The butter really is delicious served with fresh corn on the cob.

This butter is absolutely delicious!  We made it for our 4th of July picnic to use on our corn on the cob, and everyone loved it!  I think I may become addicted to this!  I put it on my baked potato last night and practically inhaled it!  I'm sure it would be delicious on bread too.

I made batches of this butter when my Basil was in season, and gave it out to my friends. They all loved it. You can use it to put under the skin of a chicken roaster, over veggies, over pasta, and on bread.

Love this!  Great way to make good use of my huge basil plant!  I put tablespoonfulls on a cookie sheet & freeze - then transfer to freezer bag for future use.  We add to corn, pasta, Texas toast, etc.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was really good!  I halved the recipe, and used it to make garlic bread. I spread it on some split Kaiser rolls and baked at 375 until it was nicely browned, it was fabulous!

THE best!  It was stellar on fresh roasted corn on the cob!  I then grated fresh Pecorino Romano cheese over the corn.  A-mazing!  I separated the recipe out and froze the butter in small cubes.  The possibilities are endless!  Thanks for sharing!

mmmmm basil butter! This is absolutely deelish! I roll into a log in plastic wrap and freeze. In the middle of winter when I want a taste of summer I pop it out the freezer cut off a slice or two and add it to veggies, garlic bread, on top of steak. It's also wonderful on corn on the cob!

Delicous on corn on the cob.  We grilled it with the husk on to seal in the flavor and then loaded it up with the Basil Butter....awesome.  Thanks for a new idea to an old stand-by.

I had a ton of basil in the garden and didn't know what to do with it besides making pesto.  Found this recipe, tried it, and found it so good!  We  make garlic bread with it and put it on baked potatoes.  Soooo good!

Yum! So easy and delicious! I made a half batch and didn't feel like dragging out the food processor so I just chopped the basil really fine and made a paste out of the garlic by adding a bit of kosher salt and pressing the cloves into a paste.  Had some on our corn on the cob last night, and tonight I'm using it on whatever is ripe from the garden - green beans, zucchini or baby carrots.

I have made basil and pesto butters before with varying success, I found this one the best. The only thing I did different was that I added more basil and more garlic.

My husband made this for the second time recently with our left over basil from another recipe. We had it on steaks...so awesome. Then we froze in the rest and just thawed it tonight, spread it on french bread and made the MOST fantastic garlic bread! We didn't have 15 leaves of basil, we probably halved that, I thought that was enough to make it subtly basil-tastic.

I had some leftover basil the other day after making pesto, so I thought I would try this recipe. I put it on some bread the night I made it, and it was pretty good. On impulse, I just put a couple of tablespoons into a pan of squash I was cooking, and it smelled so good I burned my mouth because I couldn't wait to eat it! Now that it's cooled off some, it's the best squash I've ever had. I'm going to put this in EVERYTHING :)

the basil butter is very good and i use it in alot of my cooking.when i made it i used a little bit more basil.the recipe calls for 4 cloves of garlic and when making this recipe keep in mind that some garlic is stronger than others depending on the freshness.what i did was i used a garlic press to mince the garlic and i set it aside and mixed the butter and basil.i gradually added the garlic so that it wouldnt be too strong because the first time i made it i went by the directions and the butter ended up being to strong and i had to add more butter but over all this is a very good recipe that i will make again and again.

LOVE this on grilled corn on the cob.  I didn't use pepper...I think I just forgot about it.  But I have used garlic salt, garlic powder, fresh chopped garlic, etc.  They are all delicious.  I've always used the windowsill basil...just LOVE it.

Awesome flavor!  Can be used for anything and great thing is you can store it to use later.  Great way to use up all the basil I had in my garden.  The smell is soooo good!!!

Delicious! I have started growing basil plants and was looking for great ways to use it. This was awesome! I cut the recipe in 1/2 and I buttered ciabatta bread and baked it in the oven- Delicious! We had the left overs on corn on the cob tonight and it was perfect! I know I will be making this a lot this summer!

Made as written.  It is quite garlicky so next time may reduce garlic to 3 cloves.

Tasty recipe. Try roasting or sautéing the garlic before mixing it to cut the strength of the raw garlic. Good on corn, pasta, and probably lots of other things.

Love it! I was looking for something to do with my massive basil plant and decided to try this. Used it on corn, and tossed in in a pasta with some fresh tomato. It was great! I'll use again!

Good to have in the fridge for veggies. It has a unique taste, so make one small batch before deciding if you like it.

Love it! I'm always looking for ways to use my abundant basil, and this was wonderful.  I used unsalted butter, then added salt to taste.  Would have been great even without the salt.

Easy to make, very delicious.  I used a magic bullet to crop up basil and garlic and then to mix in butter used my kitchenaid mixer.

This recipe is so easy and very flavorful.  I have basil in my garden and I have found the fresh basil is better than dried for the recipe.  If you have other fresh herbs (thyme, oregano, marjoram, dill or garlic), they make an awesome butter for seasoning my Thanksgiving turkey.  Thanks for the baseline recipe!

I put this on top of my fish when it got done, and had a little left over and put it on my fries also.  I added a little lemon zest to it and tasted it which did not seam like enough for me so added about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. rolled it up in parchment paper, label a zip lock bag and put it in the freeze for later.  All I have to do is cut what I want off next time.

This is a great recipe.  Like other reviewers, I have an abundance of basil in my garden.  This is a perfect use for it.  I'm getting ready to make my second batch.  I loved the garlic  flavor of the first batch, but felt it overpowered the basil, so will add more basil this time.

I made this butter just as the recipe stated. It is so good on fresh corn, grilled steaks, a good Tuscan bread. I will probably add a bit of kosher salt the next time I make it, but it will definitely be a constant in my refrigerator.

I made this several times over the summer with my fresh basil.  Loved it on corn on the cob!  Also used it as a spread on french bread with spaghetti.  This is fabulous and I have even mixed it up and frozen it to use this winter for a taste of summer.

If you put the basil in the food processor it turns the butter green and is pureed into the butter instead of bits of herbs.  Our butter tasted and looked like pesto which wasn't exactly that appealing to put on muffins.  I don't think we are basil butter fans.

Delicious!  I spread the butter onto slices of fresh bread, and then I cooked them in the over for 10  minutes to warm up the bread.  It was a big hit at the family dinner table!

I used this as a garlic butter spread on French bread, also added it to a can of corn cooking on the stove, it was delish!
Can't wait to try it on Corn on the Cob.
